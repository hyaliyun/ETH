It is made up of a fulling mill, a press house, a water tower, a chimney, and various worker dwellings. History In 1769, Fulcard Van Nordstrand advertised the sale of the gristmill possibly after its completion. This is the oldest documentation of a mill in Milltown. The mill was sold eight years later by Ferdinand Schuurman. He died a year later and the mill was given to his wife, Eleanor Schuurman, and his son, Abraham Schuurman. In 1789, Abraham sold the mill to Tunis Quick of Hunterdon County, which was then sold four years later to Nicholas Van Bundt, who built the fulling mill. Van Brundt sold the mill to John Bennett the following year, who sold it to Christian Van Nortwick a year later, who leased it to Timothy Enixon the following year. The water tower and the towering smokestack of the mill. The mill was then acquired by Jacob Bergen in 1811, who named it Bergen's Mill. In 1812, Bergen constructed a new fulling mill and a press house, which he advertised for his services. In his advertisement, he became the first to call the surrounding settlement \\"Milltown.\\" He died 24 years later, after which his family oversaw the mill's production. In 1843, a fire caused the mill to cease operation. It was subsequently acquired by Christopher Meyer who formed the Meyer Rubber Company and converted the mill into a factory. The structure received repairs, but another fire destroyed the factory and Meyer's home two years later. The factory then became financed by John R. Ford and was renamed Ford & Co. In 1851, another fire destroyed the factory. The factory was again rebuilt the following year and named the Ford Rubber Company after the issuance of stocks. Six years later, the factory was renamed the Meyer Rubber Company again, with Christopher Meyer as the president. In 1896, the factory stopped production. The India Rubber Company operated the factory from 1897‚Äì1906; it was succeeded by the International Rubber Company. The factory was then taken over by Michelin Tire Company in 1907. Many of the buildings which are currently part of the mill were made during that year.https://www.nytimes.com/2004/06/20/realestate/in-the-region- new-jersey-a-plan-to-make-over-an-eyesore.html In 1919, Michelin built 53 homes (which would soon expand to 200) in Milltown. During the company's peak year, Michelin would employ over 2000 workers. Michelin left in 1930 due to the Great Depression, and a few companies (Heidingsfield Printing Company, Algro Knitting Mills, and Alphaduct Wire) subsequently used the factory during this time. Shortly afterward, the factory permanently retired.

AllMusic noted their change of genre from retro-thrash to groove metal, but praised it as an equally effective blend of music. While a lack of originality is suggested, the catchiness and slowed down riffs are both praised. Blabbermouth praised their change in style as making every song stand out without any evident weakness, particularly commenting on their \\"bigger hooks and every ounce of the aggression\\". As with other reviews, Exclaim! was appreciative of the new style, , suggesting hints of Metallica, Pantera, Death Angel and Ozzy making the \\"album ride a strangely attractive line between sounding entirely new yet being eerily familiar and aged\\".

Plot  Nawuth Keat was the fifth of eight children in a Cambodian village known as Salatrave. His father is a prosperous rice farmer, owning both a motorcycle and tractor. This wealth places Nawuth and his family in particular danger from the Khmer Rouge. After the dictator Pol Pot overruns the government with the aid of the Khmer Rouge, Nawuth's life is completely transformed. Without warning, Salatrave is attacked and Nawuth's mother, grandmother, sister, aunt, and uncle are massacred. Nawuth himself is shot three times. Nawuth survives his attack and is sent by his father to live in the town of Battambang with his older sister, Chantha. Nawuth's father remains in Salatrave. Eventually, the Khmer Rouge invade Battambang and Nawuth is forced to flee with his brothers (Hackly, Bunna, and Chanty), Chantha, and Chantha's fiance (Van Lan). They return to the ruins of Salatrave, where Chantha and Van Lan are soon married. Nawuth's father flees to the jungle to escape certain death, while Nawuth and the rest of the family are forced into labor by the Khmer Rouge. Food is scarce and they suffer from malnutrition. The family is further separated when Bunna is forced to join a chat, a team of teenagers forced to build dams and huts. Nawuth eventually escapes from the labor camp and joins his father in the jungle, where he stays for many months. While in the Jungle, Nawuth is forced to eat monkey, turtle snake and whatever animals he can kill. Nawuth later rejoins Van Lan, only to find nothing has changed for the better. There is less food and the murders have gotten worse. At this time Nawuth witnesses an old man's murder and realizes how truly evil the Khmer Rouge are. After some time back, food is too scarce to survive on. During that year, more people died from starvation than from bullets. Then one morning, Van Lan left to visit his parents. During this time, Nawuth stole some rice from neighboring farms. He also stole squash and made traps for fish. Nawuth and his brothers suffer from starvation and their bellies become bloated. Due to this, he and his brother, Chanty, head again into the neighboring farms to steal more rice, and they are caught. The Khmer Rouge let them go. Due to lack of food, Nawuth gets infected. Most people had died from this infection, so Van Lan takes him to a doctor, and the doctor saves his life by giving Nawuth an enema. Afterward, Nawuth is told to guard a large building filled with corn. Monkeys steal the corn, and Nawuth is yelled at by the soldier that assigned him the task. He survives and once again guards the corn. Using traps his father taught him how to make, he catches a few monkeys that try to steal the corn and eats them. Afterward, he takes some of the corn and hides in the jungle; and he is caught, but his life is spared. The weeks that followed were harsh: people blamed stolen food products on him, but the guards did not believe them. A while later, his father was killed. Some time passed before the world gave any help. The Vietnamese started to attack the Khmer Rouge and a war started. The Vietnamese began to attack the cities. Chantha gave birth to a baby named Vibol during this time. Nawuth is caught in the cross-fire shortly after. It was a small skirmish, but many people were injured. They did not get away though: the Khmer Rouge made them march further inland, away from the Vietnamese-protected zones. A few weeks later, they left the Khmer Rouge area for the city. About thirty people left with them at night. They ate what they could. When they finally got to the cities, they met up with Van Lan's family. When there, Nawuth met a child named Ang. They became best friends. The Vietnamese were \\"an improvement\\" over the Khmer Rouge, but they were still ruthless. Along in the city, Nawuth got his palm read, and it turned out to be an accurate statement. During this time, Van Lan had a talk with Nawuth about leaving. The Vietnamese have taken what the Khmer Rouge have not destroyed. A few days later they say goodbye and leave. They walked more than they had ever. The Vietnamese did not want the world to know that they were not saviors, so they classified the wanderers as enemies. They had to drink from a pond with dead bodies in it, and the Khmer Rouge changed their names to Angka, or \\"The Organization of Saviors\\". Finally, they slipped across the border to sneak into a Thai refugee camp, where life was almost as bad: it was run by the United Nations. They got one chicken every two weeks and a bag of rice a month. Some of the Thai refugee camps would deport thousands of refugees back into Cambodia. The Cambodians shot the old and the weak, and the people in the front were killed by landmines. The United Nations got involved. Chantha gave a woman one hundred dollars worth of gold, and Nawuth split up with his family and friends. The woman took him in, only to treat him like trash. The family that Nawuth is staying with has a sponsor in Paris, who is willing to pay for the airplane trip. Nawuth is supposed to meet Van Lan and the rest of his family in Paris. Nawuth and his \\"family\\" leave to go to another camp. There, they got a chicken a week, but Nawuth would steal religious offerings given to Buddhist monks anyway. A few weeks later, his \\"mom\\" tells him they aren't going to Paris after all: their sponsor had been unable to buy the tickets, but instead, there would be a chance they would be able to go to the United States. They had a sponsor in the United States, but they had to wait an entire year to go. When they were allowed to leave, they got medical examinations, but the doctor misread the bullet wound on Nawuth's arm as infection and pronounced Nawuth to be sick. They had to stay. The family shunned Nawuth. Over the following months, the doctor was convinced that the scars on Nawuth were not infections, he signed the papers for qualification. They were moved to another camp. This camp was more crowded than the others. They spent two weeks there, and then they got sponsored and were told: \\"in two days, you leave to the United States\\". There, the bus that took him was larger than any bus he had ever seen, and the actual airport was the same, the largest building he had ever seen. They landed in San Francisco, after nine years of suffering, Nawuth was free. Afterword Shortly after, Nawuth left to Portland, Oregon. This is where he would split up with the family. This was because he was forced to work, while the other kids got to play. He got a job, being paid $3.17 an hour, and a monthly welfare check of $300, which he gave to his \\"mom\\". When he found out that Van Lan, Chantha, Vibol, and Bunna lived in a refugee camp in Indonesia, he asked \\"mom\\" for ten dollars. She refused. He left to go live with his great aunt who lived not too far away from Portland. He later married his high school sweetheart, Rany Prak, who was also a Cambodian immigrant. They had three children: Brian, Anthony, and Stephanie. Van Lan, Chantha, Vibol, and Bunna all live in Lyons, France. Ang also made it to France. Hackly lives with Nawuth, and Nawuth's oldest sister Chanya, and works in a military hospital in Pursat.

Instances of these class templates are C++ classes that define a function call operator, and the instances of these classes can be called as if they were functions. It is possible to perform very sophisticated operations without writing a new function object, simply by combining predefined function objects and function object adaptors. The class template \`std::function\` provided by C++11 is a general-purpose polymorphic function wrapper. Instances of \`std::function\` can store, copy, and invoke any callable target‚Äîfunctions, lambda expressions (expressions defining anonymous functions), bind expressions (instances of function adapters that transform functions to other functions of smaller arity by providing values for some of the arguments), or other function objects. The algorithms provided by the C++ Standard Library do not require function objects of more than two arguments. Function objects that return Boolean values are an important special case. A unary function whose return type is is called a predicate, and a binary function whose return type is is called a binary predicate. Adaptable function objects In general, a function object has restrictions on the type of its argument. The type restrictions need not be simple, though: may be overloaded or may be a member template. Similarly, there need be no way for a program to determine what those restrictions are. An adaptable function object, however, does specify what the argument and return types are, and provides nested s so that those types can be named and used in programs. If a type is a model of an adaptable generator, then it must define . Similarly, if is a model of the adaptable unary function, it must define and , and if is a model of the adaptable binary function, it must define , , and . The C++ Standard Library provides base classes and to simplify the definition of adaptable unary functions and adaptable binary functions. Adaptable function objects are important, because they can be used by function object adaptors: function objects that transform or manipulate other function objects. The C++ Standard Library provides many different function object adaptors, including (that returns the logical complement of the value returned by a particular adaptable predicate), and and , which perform composition of function object. Predefined function objects The C++ Standard Library includes in the header file \`functional\` many different predefined function objects, including arithmetic operations (, , , , , and ), comparisons (, , , , , and ), and logical operations (, , and ).  Examples  Function wrappers can be used to make calls to ordinary functions or to functions objects created by lambda expressions. #include #include /* Define a template function */ template void PrintValue(T value) { std::cout << value << std::endl; } int main(void) { /* A function wrapper to a function */ std::function func_a = PrintValue; func_a(2015); /* A function wrapper to a function pointer */ std::function func_b = &PrintValue;; func_b(2016); /* A function wrapper to a lambda function. */ std::function func_c = [](int value) { std::cout << value << std::endl; }; func_c(2017); /* A function wrapper generated by std::bind(). * Pass a pre-defined parameter when binding. */ std::function func_d = std::bind(PrintValue, \\"PI is\\"); func_d(); /* A function wrapper generated by std::bind(). * Pass a parameter when calling the function. */ std::function func_e = std::bind(PrintValue, std::placeholders::_1); func_e(3.14159); } Function wrappers also can be used to access member variables and member functions of classes. #include #include template class CAnyData { public: CAnyData(T value) : m_value{value} {} void Print(void) { std::cout << m_value << std::endl; } void PrintAfterAdd(T value) { std::cout << (m_value + value) << std::endl; } T m_value; }; int main() { /* A function wrapper to a member variable of a class */ CAnyData data_a{2016}; std::function &)> func_a = &CAnyData;::m_value; std::cout << func_a(data_a) << std::endl; /* A function wrapper to member function without parameter passing */ CAnyData data_b{2016.1}; std::function &)> func_b = &CAnyData;::Print; func_b(data_b); /* A function wrapper to member function with passing a parameter */ std::function &, float)> func_c = &CAnyData;::PrintAfterAdd; func_c(data_b, 0.1); /* A function wrapper to member function generated by std::bind */ std::function func_d = std::bind(&CAnyData;::PrintAfterAdd, &data;_b, std::placeholders::_1); func_d(0.2); }  References  External links * C++ reference for standard function objects Category:C++ Category:C++ Standard Library Category:Articles with example C++ code ","title":"Functional (C++)"},{"id":"29958770","text":"Sara Holmgren (born 1979) is a Swedish handball player.

Listed at and , he batted and threw right-handed. Biography Fulghum played college baseball at Auburn University, where he was selected to the 1921 College Baseball All- Southern Team. He was signed by the Philadelphia Athletics in late April 1921. He was assigned to the minor league Augusta Georgians of the South Atlantic League, where he batted .279 in 75 games during the 1921 season. Fulghum made two appearances for the Athletics during September 1921, his only major league games. He was hitless in two at bats, and drew one walk. His first appearance came against the Cleveland Indians on September 15, in the first game of a home doubleheader at Shibe Park. With the Indians leading in the eighth inning, 15‚Äì3, Fulghum pinch hit for pitcher Ray Miner and drew a walk; he was then forced out at second base when the next hitter, Whitey Witt, hit a ground ball. Fulghum did not play defensive, as he was replaced by reliever Lefty Wolf for the ninth inning. Fulghum's second appearance came on September 24, in the second game of a home doubleheader versus the Chicago White Sox. In the fifth inning, with the White Sox leading, 12‚Äì0, Fulghum pinch hit for second baseman Jimmy Dykes and struck out. Fulghum stayed in the game defensively, at shortstop. Fulghum batted once more, grounding into a double play in the seventh inning. In the field, he committed an error in his only defensive chance. After his time with the Athletics, Fulghum played semi-professional baseball during 1922 in Andalusia, Alabama, and during 1923 in Pensacola, Florida.

The female Hedruris spinigera attaches itself onto the epithelium of the fishes' stomach using a hook at the curved tail. Meanwhile, the male swims freely until it finds a female that has already attached to a host, then the male curls around the body of that female so that sexual reproduction occurs within the host. Most fishes consume Paracorophium excavatum, the intermediate host for Hedruris spinigera; however, the prevalences of Hedruris spinigera are restricted to certain host range.  Morphology  Hedruris spinigera have 4 complex lips consisting of two lateral pseudolabia and two median lips. The oesophagus is not clearly divided into muscular and glandular portions. The body of Hedruris spinigera is covered by non-living cuticles. The female Hedruris spinigera has a prehensic hook at the posterior end. Immature adults within the intermediate host are similar to mature adults, except for the smaller size and absence of eggs.  Geographic distribution  Hedruris spinigera are widely distributed within New Zealand, scientists found that the distribution appears to be limited within the coastal area, especially in brackish waters.The prevalence of Hedruris spinigera depends on species of fishes. The prevalence in intermediate host was found infected with one worm, but sometimes two or three worms could also be found in intermediate host.  Life cycle  The intermediate host for Hedruris spinigera is the amphipod crustacean Paracorophium excavatum. Hedruris spinigera has limited host range because some fishes failed to establish Hedruris spinigera due to lack of the proper attachment site on epithelium of fish stomach. Although most fishes consume Paracorophium excavatum, Hedruris spinigera actually distribute in only a limited host range. Scientists have found that Aldrichetta forsteri and Retropinna retropinna fish species are the truly suitable hosts for Hedruris spinigera. The infection site in the adult worm occurs at the stomach where the female attaches to, but parasite could also be free-living as found in rectum and intestine of fishes. As for immature Hedruris spinigera, the site of infection occurs at hemocoelomic cavity, where the worms are coiled but not encysted.

A long-time loyalist of president Laurent Gbagbo, he had served in the government for a time as Minister of the Interior. Political and legal career Born at Gogobro in Divo Department, Yao N'Dr√© is a member of the Dida ethnic group.\\"Un conseil constitutionnel impartial ?\\", La Lettre du Continent N¬∞598, 28 October 2010 . He worked as a law professor and was active in Gbagbo's political party, the Ivorian Popular Front (FPI), for years.Cheikh Yerim Seck, \\"Paul Yao-N'Dr√©, la derni√®re carte de Gbagbo\\", Jeune Afrique, 13 August 2009 . During Gbagbo's presidency, he was elected to the National Assembly as an FPI candidate in the December 2000-January 2001 parliamentary election and served in the government as Minister of the Interior. In the immediate aftermath of the September 2002-January 2003 civil war, he was no longer a minister in the government, but he remained influential and was considered part of Gbagbo's personal circle of advisers.\\"Hard-core Gbagbo\\", Africa Confidential, volume 44, number 7, 4 April 2003. He eventually became the FPI's National Secretary for Justice and Human Rights. On 8 August 2009, upon the expiry of Yanon Yapo's six-year term as president of the Constitutional Council, president Gbagbo appointed Yao N'Dr√© to succeed Yapo. His appointment concerned the opposition, who worried that the Council might not be an impartial body if headed by Yao N'Dr√©. Denouncing the appointment, the opposition paper Le Nouveau R√©veil said that it was impossible to imagine that Yao N'Dr√© would ever approve election results showing that Gbagbo had lost the election. Jeune Afrique noted that Gbagbo lacked control over the Independent Electoral Commission (CEI) and the electoral preparations, and that his power to appoint a staunch political loyalist to head the Constitutional Council offered him another way to influence the outcome of the forthcoming presidential election. 2010 election controversy The presidential election was finally held, after many delays, in October 2010. No candidate received a majority of the vote, necessitating a run-off between opposition leader Alassane Ouattara, who placed second, and President Gbagbo, who placed first. The second round was held on 28 November 2010, and a tense wait for results followed. Results were expected and then postponed for days, beyond the deadline for the announcement of results.David Lewis and Loucoumane Coulibaly, \\"Ivory Coast's Ouattara wins vote - election chief\\", Reuters, 2 December 2010. On 2 December 2010, Youssouf Bakayoko, the president of the Independent Electoral Commission (CEI), went to the United Nations-guarded hotel where Ouattara was staying and announced provisional election results showing that Ouattara had won the election in the second round with 54.1% of the vote, against 45.9% for Laurent Gbagbo. Yao N'Dre, the president of the Constitutional Council, promptly took to the airwaves to say that the CEI had no authority left to announce any results, because it had already missed its deadline to announce them, and consequently the results given by Bakayoko were invalid. According to Yao N'Dre, the passing of the deadline meant that only the Constitutional Council was \\"authorised to announce decisions on the contested results.\\" It was widely presumed that the council would issue a ruling favoring Gbagbo, although the CEI's results indicated that Gbagbo could only be credited with victory if hundreds of thousands of votes were invalidated.David Lewis and Tim Cocks, \\"Ivory Coast seals borders after opposition win\\", Reuters, 2 December 2010. Yao N'Dre announced the final election results from the Constitutional Council on 3 December 2010; as expected, the council's results were sufficiently different from the CEI's results to alter the outcome and hand victory to Gbagbo. The results from seven northern regions were cancelled by the Council due to irregularities, thereby swinging the outcome narrowly in favor of Gbagbo, who was credited with 51.45% of the vote while Ouattara had 48.55%.\\"Constitutional body names Gbagbo I.Coast election winner\\", AFP, 3 December 2010. The council's decision produced a political crisis, as both Gbagbo and Ouattara claimed to have been rightfully elected president. Gbagbo was sworn in for a second term on 4 December.Tim Cocks and Loucoumane Coulibaly, \\"Ivory Coast's Gbagbo sworn in despite poll row\\", Reuters, 4 December 2010. The political dispute between Gbagbo and Ouattara eventually turned into an armed conflict, and there was heavy fighting in Abidjan in March-April 2011. Ouattara's forces captured Gbagbo and effectively took control of the city on 11 April 2011. Having fled to Ghana,\\"C√¥te d'Ivoire : Paul Yao N'Dr√© en p√©nitence au Golf H√¥tel\\", Jeune Afrique, 21 April 2011 . Yao N'Dr√© returned and met with Ouattara on 21 April 2011; after the meeting, he said that Ivorians were collectively responsible for the turmoil, rejecting the notion of individual responsibility, and he spoke of the need to rebuild and cooperate. Although he was said to be \\"visibly tense\\", it was clear that he had accepted that Ouattara was the president, and he referred to Gbagbo as a former president.\\"Ivory Coast court chief Yao N'Dre rejects blame\\", BBC News, 21 April 2011. Because it was a legal necessity for the Constitutional Council to legitimize Ouattara's rule, it was expected that Yao N'Dre would have to play his part in the process of formally installing Ouattara as president. Accordingly, Yao N'Dr√© announced on 5 May 2011 that the Constitutional Council proclaimed Ouattara to be president of C√¥te d'Ivoire. Explaining what appeared to be a reversal of its decision a few months prior, he said that the council had accepted the decision of the African Union, which had endorsed Ouattara's claim to have won the election. Yao N'Dr√© also said that Ouattara would be sworn in as president on 6 May, with an inauguration ceremony to be held separately due to the circumstances on 21 May 2011.\\"Constitutional Council declares Ouattara I.Coast president\\" AFP, 5 May 2011. Yao N'Dr√© swore Ouattara in as president on 6 May 2011.

Ouattara was at least superficially respectful towards Yao N'Dr√©, although one observer noted that Ouattara's body language suggested \\"contempt\\" for the magistrate. Ouattara subsequently appointed another politician, Francis Wodi√©‚Äîwho had supported Ouattara in the 2010 election‚Äîto replace Yao N'Dr√© on 25 July 2011.\\"Pro-Gbagbo head of Ivorian constitutional council replaced\\", AFP, 25 July 2011.

He wrote an article for Sunset on author Jack London.\\"The Sailing of the Snark\\", Sunset, May 1907. The two became friends. In 1913, Dunn was a frequent visitor to London's Beauty Ranch in Glen Ellen, California.

The southwest end of the trail in Sherman will be along East Andrew Road between Bahr Road and Pine Drive (). The northeast end of the trail in Williamsville will be on Conrey Street east of Elm Street (). The right-of-way occupies part of what was once an electric interurban line operated by the Illinois Terminal Railroad (ITR) from 1906 until 1956. The right-of-way, which generally parallels Interstate 55, has passed into the hands of the electrical utility holding company Ameren, the current owner, and is used as a high-tension power corridor. Construction and operation of the proposed rail trail will be carried out by the village of Williamsville. Current events On 6 December 2010, the Sherman-Williamsville rail-trail project received a $269,000 state/federal grant for engineering planning purposes. The money will be used to survey the route and do test borings to determine if the ITR's railroad ballast remains in place underneath the land surface of the overgrown right- of-way. As of 2011, the Sherman and Williamsville municipalities are among the fastest-growing areas in Central Illinois by population. The total cost of the Sherman-Williamsville trail project was estimated in December 2010 at $2.38 million. On 27 May 2011, Williamsville announced that engineering and design work, to be carried out under the December 2010 grant, would start in summer 2011.

Undercurrent and BournemouthAID In February 2005 Henson started pop-punk band Undercurrent with school friend Adam Scholey. The group disbanded in 2008 after three years of gigging, shortly before Henson left the UK to travel around Western Europe and North America. Following his travels, Henson moved to Reading, Berkshire to commence a course in robotics at the University of Reading. There he met and studied under the experimental scientist and cyberneticist, Kevin Warwick. In his first year of study at Reading, Henson also participated as a 'hidden human' in the 2008 Loebner Prize and Turing Test, which was held at his school. Henson and Scholey were reunited in March 2009 when Scholey invited Henson to sing on the BournemouthAID project CD in which local artists collaboratively recorded a cover of Slade's \\"Mama Weer All Crazee Now\\". Solo career After BournemouthAID, Henson went on to record his debut single \\"I Love You And I Miss You\\" and released it in March 2010 on Scholey's independent label \\"Plastic Parrot\\". To promote the single release, Henson toured the UK in summer 2010 and had originally planned to tour in the US for the summer of 2011, but instead he toured in Western Europe for the duration of August. In addition to his prolific approach to live performances overseas, Henson continues to gig in the south of England and it was announced at the 2011 Bournemouth Unplugged Final that Henson had been awarded the ITG Songwriter's Award for original content and high-quality songcraft. As of 2012, Henson has shared bills with artists from a diverse list of genres including alt-country singer Michael Weston King, a cappella quartet The Blanks (as seen on American hit comedy-drama TV series, Scrubs), and at least two number one charting artists including; Scrumpy and Western band The Wurzels, and BRIT Award- winning Scottish singer-songwriter KT Tunstall. He is also reported to have (on separate occasions) jammed live on stage with Steve Ryan from British pop punk group Trucks, and Huw Lloyd-Langton from English space rock band Hawkwind, among others. In April 2013, Ant Henson was featured on the BBC1 flagship entertainment show, The Voice UK. For his blind audition he sang All These Things That I've Done by The Killers but did not make it through to the 'battle rounds' of the competition. Other projects Ant Henson and Si Genaro playing live with Ever The Animal In June 2010, the play \\"Sandman's Fee\\" was performed for two nights at The Lighthouse, Poole for which Henson co-wrote some of the music with the primary script writer, Gavin Dutot. Henson is also involved in other musical endeavours, including playing electric guitar and providing both song-writing talents and joint lead vocals for psychedelic post-rock jam band, Ever The Animal. In 2012, Adam Scholey released an album of his own tracks under the moniker \\"Sounds Like Adam\\", featuring several studio collaborations with Henson on both lead and rhythm guitar. Henson and Scholey have also been known to collaborate live since the break-up of Undercurrent, with Henson often playing acoustic guitar and singing harmonies to Scholey's lead vocal and keyboard work. In these performances, they have been known to reprise Undercurrent songs as well as performing tracks from each of their solo catalogues. Acting Henson also has an active acting career, having played the role of Jesus in a 2009 production of Andrew Lloyd Webber's Jesus Christ Superstar in Reading, Berkshire, and as Schlomo Metzenbaum in a 2010 production of Fame ‚Äì The Musical. In 2010, again in Reading, Henson played Prince Hamlet in a Reading University Drama Society production of Shakespeare's Hamlet. Following his trend towards open air Shakespeare, Henson again starred with RUDS as Peter Quince in a production of A Midsummer Night's Dream in 2011, and also appeared as Lord Longaville in a 2012 production of Love's Labours Lost with the Brownsea Open Air Theatre to positive reviews. In October 2012, Henson starred as Tom Wingfield in a Bournemouth Little Theatre club production of Tennessee Williams' autobiographically inspired The Glass Menagerie.

The organization exists to both ameliorate the life of persons living with HIV and AIDS, and to prevent the spread of HIV by educational initiatives. Based in Vancouver, it is Canada's oldest and Vancouver's largest HIV and AIDS service organization. With the help of 200 volunteers, AIDS Vancouver provides free and confidential services to one in three people living with HIV in British Columbia. Among the services provided by the organization are case management, support programs, grocery distribution and nutritional advice, financial assistance, helpline access, community resource centre, and education. Background Of the 33 million people with HIV worldwide, more than 60,000 reside in Canada. British Columbia has a disproportionately high prevalence rate of HIV for Canada, with over a fifth of the HIV positive population found in BC. Increases in the prevalence of HIV in Vancouver can be attributed to high incidence among Men who have sex with Men (MSM) and Injection Drug Users (IDU), which occurred in the 1980s and 1990s, respectively. AIDS Vancouver was created in 1983 to support those persons diagnosed with HIV (at the time referred to as Gay-Related Immune Deficiency), and to create a community with no new HIV infections. By providing free services to those living with HIV and educating people about HIV, AIDS Vancouver is helping lower the incidence of the disease. History AIDS Vancouver was founded in 1983 with the goal of information dissemination, when there were only six known cases of AIDS in Vancouver. Initially, the organization's efforts were concentrated towards producing posters, newsletters and brochures in an awareness campaign. The organization was first based out of the founders' homes with monthly public meetings being held at the Lotus Hotel. With government funding secured in 1984, AIDS Vancouver moved to a Davie St. location and established an Emergency Assistance Fund for persons with AIDS. By 1998, AIDS Vancouver reached a new milestone, with nearly 16,000 clients served, and the helpline receiving 1600 calls. In 2001, AIDS Vancouver partnered with the Mexican Persons With AIDS Society, to exchange assistance, ideas and advocacy. The Case Management model was updated to its current form ‚Äì the access and intensive streams. Today, the agency has 25 paid staff and 200 volunteers providing health promotion, education, and support services. Services include case management grocery program, resource centre, helpline and support programs. Funding and Volunteerism The services provided by AIDS Vancouver rely on both paid staff and 200 volunteers. Volunteers donate 20,000 person-hours each year, amounting to roughly $400,000 worth of work. Currently, 80% of funding comes from federal and provincial sources. Donors supply an additional 12% of the funds, with the remaining 8% coming from fund development activities. Notable funders include the Vancouver Coastal Health Authority, Public Health Agency of Canada and the BC Gaming Commission. In 2009, they partnered with U.S. nonprofit TeachAIDS to provide state-of-the-art educational materials developed at Stanford University to their constituent groups. Client Services Client services are central to AIDS Vancouver's work. Over 146 new clients were added last year (2009) and made use of numerous different services such as Case Management, Grocery and Nutritional Advice and the Helpline. In 2014, a new service was added - the Health Promotion Case Management (HPCM) - which is focused on prevention of new cases of HIV. Case Management The Case management team consists of 10 staff working out of four sites, to provide support to over 2000 clients in living with the HIV infection and linking them to appropriate levels of health care and social services. Sites are located in the Seymour St. office and in the Downtown Eastside, which cater specifically to the Aboriginal community and gay men. Most commonly, support is provided with income, housing or financial assistance. The case management program consists of two streams ‚Äì the access (short term or drop-in) and intensive (long term) streams. Roughly 150 new clients are added each year from all demographics ‚Äì First Nations, women, men, children, and others. Community Resource Centre The Community Resource Centre provides information about HIV and AIDS. Computers can be used by anyone to get more information on the Internet. Materials from the resource centre can also be ordered, to help in sharing knowledge. Grocery In 2009 the AIDS Vancouver grocery program supplied roughly 16,000 bags of grocery to roughly 700 clients, working with 16 volunteers. The program offers a variety of supplemental nutrition items, such as fresh produce, cereals and grains, canned protein and hygiene items, in addition to bottled water. The grocery is open twice a week, for two weeks a month. Help Line The helpline and reception service provides anonymous and confidential information to over 11,000 inquiries in 2009 via walk-in, email, forums and telephone. Trained volunteers can answer queries pertaining to testing, safer sex, treatment and transmission of HIV. Health Promotion Case Management (HPCM) The HPCM program uses acomprehensive approach to health which positions HIV prevention within a broad and inclusive health framework. This program offers clients the opportunity to connect with a professional that can help them address the barriers that can impact their health and well-being. Special Events AIDS Vancouver participates in the Scotiabank AIDS Walk for Life, the We Care Red Ribbon Campaign and World AIDS Day. On September 27, AIDS Vancouver held the popular Celebrity Dim Sum fund- raiser. The seventh annual event garnered an unprecedented $21,670, surpassing its 2013 goal by almost $3500. Every year, AIDS Vancouver hosts the Holiday Grocery which happens in December, providing festive groceries for up to 800 people in one day. Governance AIDS Vancouver, incorporated as the Vancouver AIDS Society, is a non-profit (cannot generate money) volunteer-led organization guided by the Society's 12-member Board of Directors. The Board ensures responsible policy development and meeting the mission statement and strategic direction. Four positions on the Board are reserved for those persons living with HIV. The 25 paid staff are led by an Executive Director who reports to and works closely with the Board. AIDS Vancouver members participate by electing the board of directors at the society's Annual General Meeting and by participating occasionally in committees established by the Board. Prevention & Education The HIV Prevention & Awareness Programs aim to educate communities in the fight against HIV/AIDS, and to overcome stigma and stereotyping. The organization views information and knowledge as keys toward understanding and acceptance of HIV and AIDS. Workshops are offered by AIDS Vancouver's Prevention and Awareness Program to educate and give out trusted and accurate materials. AIDS Vancouver aims to provide a professional and interactive learning environment for its clients.

History In October 2009, Boyle announced online that he would be leaving BBC panel show Mock the Week after seven series to focus on his tour and \\"some other funny things I'm writing\\". Later that month, he told The Daily Mirror that his new material would include a comedy sketch show for Channel 4, without censoring any of the black humour he had become known for. An appearance on Friday Night with Jonathan Ross followed, when Boyle revealed that the show was originally called Deal with This, Retards, but had to be changed to avoid offence. The show was consequently renamed Frankie Boyle's Tramadol Nights (a reference to the opioid drug Tramadol and the J. G. Ballard novel Cocaine Nights), with a broadcast date of November‚ÄìDecember 2010. Content The show mixed pre- recorded comedy sketches with stand-up routines before a studio audience who were \\"gleefully abused\\" by Boyle. Critical reception The show received a mixed critical reception. The first episode, broadcast on 30 November 2010 after an advertising campaign on London buses, attracted a \\"modest\\" audience (1.54 million viewers including the time-shifted repeat the same evening). The free daily newspaper Metro applauded the first episode's blend of stand-up and sketches, that \\"cantered gleefully ‚Äì but never gratuitously - past the boundaries of taste and decency\\" with \\"some fantastically acerbic rants about religious people and the mentally ill.\\" The Independent's Rhiannon Harries felt \\"the best of the sketches were those that satirised the bland inanity of TV culture\\" but was \\"less comfortable with the jokes about mental illness\\" that more or less \\"conflated religion and autism\\", concluding that there was \\"something very brittle about the laughter. The world seems a meaner place after listening to Boyle.\\" The Liverpool Echo observed that \\"in a former life, not so long ago, Boyle was the best thing about Mock the Week\\" but thought the new series' uncompromising material \\"was, somehow, over the top and below the belt at the same time,\\" culminating in a parody of Knight Rider that was \\"one of the most tedious and unfunny sketches in the history of tedious and unfunny sketches.\\" In The Guardian, John Crace, noting that the absence of previews was usually PR speak for \\"We don't think it's much good and we want to avoid it getting a kicking,\\" implied that Boyle's standup sequences were re-hashed from his recent \\"least exciting\\" tour. The conclusion that Boyle ‚Äì known for \\"heartless sensitivity-baiting and not much else\\" ‚Äì has been given \\"enough rope to hang himself\\" is difficult to resist. But \\"there are flashes of the caustic wit that make him great\\" and \\"even to those who've heard his jokes before, there are laugh-out-loud moments.\\" Writing in The Scotsman, Aidan Smith said he didn't find any of the jokes very funny and the filmed sketches \\"showed up Boyle's limitations as a comic actor.\\" MSN's Stuart Bak wondered whether Frankie Boyle was still funny. In sketch form, his material is \\"neither particularly offensive nor particularly funny, but a bit run-of-the- mill and even, at times, embarrassingly awful\\" so Boyle should \\"stick to the stand-up.\\" The British Comedy Guide branded the show \\"disappointing\\", citing \\"over-long sketches\\" and an \\"almost childish fixation on sex\\". On 7 December the second episode (including the time-shifted repeat) reached 1.14 million viewers, down 26% on week one. Metro withdrew its support, claiming \\"laughs were thin on the ground\\" in the second week and that in the third episode \\"almost without exception, the sketches were wholly unfunny and the in-house audience seemed to be struggling to raise even the smallest of titters.\\" The final episode was broadcast on 29 December and averaged an audience of 575,000. Controversy Harvey Price In December 2010, both Katie Price and Peter Andre were said to have been left \\"absolutely disgusted and sickened\\" by a joke in the 7 December 2010 broadcast about Price's disabled son, Harvey (then years old). On the show, Boyle said: \\"Apparently Jordan [Katie Price] and Peter Andre are fighting each other over custody of Harvey - well eventually one of them'll lose and have to keep him. I have a theory that Jordan married a cage fighter cause she needed someone strong enough to stop Harvey from fucking her.\\" https://metro.co.uk/2013/03/07/frankie-boyles- top-10-controversial-gags-from-katie-price-to-madeleine-mccann-3530889/ In a response, Katie Price said: \\"If Mr Boyle had a 10th of his courage and decency he would know that to suggest, let alone think funny, that Harvey may sexually attack me is vile and deeply unfair. To bully this unbelievably brave child is despicable, to broadcast it on television is to show a complete and utter lack of judgment.\\"https://www.independent.co.uk/news/people/news/katie-price-seeks- legal-advice-over-frankie-boyle-joke-about-her-son-2155543.html Peter Andre's representative also responded to the comments made by Boyle and said \\"We're all disgusted by these comments. Peter is angry and very upset at Harvey being mocked in this way. Children, especially a disabled youngster, should be off- limits.\\" Both have confirmed that they are seeking legal action and have written a complaint to Channel 4 regarding Boyle's jokes with Katie saying \\"To bully this unbelievably brave child is despicable; to broadcast it is to show a complete and utter lack of judgement. I have asked my lawyers to write to Channel 4.\\" The charity Mencap described Boyle's joke as a \\"disgusting\\" attack on a disabled child. In April 2011 Ofcom upheld 500 complaints about the incident and censured Boyle and Channel 4 for broadcasting the jokes, which had been personally cleared by Channel 4's Chief Executive David Abraham, ruling that the material appeared to directly target and mock the mental and physical disabilities of a known eight-year-old child who had not himself chosen to be in the public eye. \\"As such, Ofcom found that the comments had considerable potential to be highly offensive to the audience.\\" Racism In a later episode, Boyle was criticised by some media outlets for using racially offensive terms. A character played by Boyle used the term 'Pakis' during a joke criticising prioritisation of British and western war casualties over others in UK news media. In July 2011, the Daily Mirror published an article which strongly criticised Boyle, describing him as a 'racist comedian'. In response, he sued the Mirror for libel, and was awarded ¬£54,650 damages after a High Court jury found he had been libelled. Boyle said after the case that he intended to donate the money to charity.https://www.theguardian.com/media/2012/oct/22/frankie-boyle-libel- damages-daily-mirror DVD release The series was released on DVD on 21 November 2011.

Philippines national football team Through Chris Greatwich, one of his former players at club Lewes, McMenemy heard about the vacant coaching job in the Philippines. Five weeks after applying, he received an offer from the Philippine Football Federation, the governing body of football in the country. After an undefeated group campaign, one win and two draws, the Philippines qualified second in the group to face the Indonesia national football team in the semi-finals. The team was eventually defeated 2‚Äì0 on aggregate with Indonesia's Cristian Gonz√°les scoring a goal in each leg of the semi-final. Both the home and away legs were held in Indonesia as the Philippines didn't have a stadium that met the international standard set by AFF.

When the Air Board was formed in 1919 to manage Canadian aviation, one of its responsibilities was air defence; the CAF was formed to meet this responsibility.Roberts 1959, p. 33. The CAF would exist until 1924 when the prefix \\"Royal\\" was added, and the Royal Canadian Air Force (RCAF) was officially created. History Prior to 1920, Canadian airmen flew with the Royal Flying Corps and the Royal Naval Air Service. Canada had tried to implement two other relatively independent \\"air forces\\" before 1920. The Canadian Aviation Corps, consisting of one aircraft, was formed in 1914 to provide service in Europe during the First World War. In 1918, a contingent of two squadrons known as the Canadian Air Force was formed as another attempt to provide a Canadian military aviation presence in Europe during the First World War. This new CAF began as a small non-permanent air militia set up and managed by the Air Board. Its purpose was to give refresher air and ground courses to veterans and operated at Camp Borden. The courses were to be 28 days long and were meant to be given every two years. The training scheme was short-lived, however, and training was stopped in 1922. Between 1920 and 1922, 1,271 airmen and 550 officers completed training at Camp Borden.Roberts 1959, p. 37. When the Air Board became the responsibility of the Department of National Defence in 1922, along with the Department of Militia and Defence and the Department of Naval Service, the CAF became responsible for all flying operations in Canada, including civil aviation.Milberry 1984, p. 21 The first Air Officer Commanding of the Canadian Air Force was Arthur Kellam Tylee with the formation authorised an initial provisional strength of one Wing Commander, one Flight Lieutenant, one Warrant Officer, one Flight Sergeant and one Sergeant. In June 1920 the provisional strength of 1.340 officers and 3905 airmen (non commissioned officers and other ranks) was authorised.p.10 Shaw, S. Bernard Photographing Canada from Flying Canoes General Store Publishing House, 2001 In 1922, the CAF's Inspector-General Sir Willoughby Gwatkin began advocating for the \\"Royal\\" prefix. In 1923, after the CAF was reorganized when the Department of National Defence was formed, formal application was made and the title was granted in February 1923.Roberts 1959, p. 54. The Canadian government finally approved of the title thirteen months later, and on April 1, 1924, The Royal Canadian Air Force became official. Uniform The original uniform was a dark blue serge cut in army style with white shirts worn by officers. Army metal rank insignia and chevrons were worn but used Royal Air Force titles. Insignia Cap and collars There were 10 major varieties of metal insignia - six cap and four collar types. These types consisted of styles for officers and NCOs. For both cap and collar badges, the officers' issue consisted of a copper base overlaid with a copper maple leaf and silver wings. A silver \\"CAF\\" monogram overlaid the maple leaf and was attached to the copper base.Carroll, Warren. \\"Eagles Recalled\\". Schiffer Publishing, 1997, p.48,71 Except for the silver CAF overlay, the NCO issue was cast as a single component in silver gilded metal. A feature of all officers' badges is red woven silk in the crown. Cap and collars were issued with or without the motto (Sic Itur Ad Astra). The initial issue of these badges, designed and available in late 1918 or early 1919, was without the motto. In early 1920, dress regulations were revised and the insignia began incorporating the motto into a scroll at the bottom of both cap and collar badges. The collar insignia mirror the construction of the cap badges (with or without motto). Cap badges were designed for either the wedge (field service) cap or the peaked cap for service dress. The first issue (type 1) for both officers' and NCO's cap badges (without motto) had a crown that was mounted to the top of the maple leaf at a single point. The second issue (type 2) for the smaller wedge/field cap for both officers and NCOs had the crown attached to the wings for additional support. For the larger peaked cap versions, the crown was again attached at one point and attached to the back copper plate. All officers' cap and collar insignia were initially backed in black felt. Cap badges were fastened with double loops which were held in place with a cotter pin. Officers' models for the peaked cap used a brass metal support strip under the crown wire to strengthen the badge and to keep it flush against the cap. Both 1st and 2nd issue officer's collars had a single screw post to fasten onto the uniform, whereas the NCO versions were manufactured with double loops. Pilot's wings First authorized and issued in late 1918 or early 1919, this pilots' double wing was made in a style similar to the officer's cap and collar badges. It consisted of a copper back with overlays of two silver wings with a silver \\"CAF\\" monogram superimposed over a copper maple leaf. Black felt covered the back and a brass metal support strip was added under the fasteners. The design of the wings made the structure fragile. While there appears to be two die sets of the most common version of these wings, an uncommon and distinct variety has drooped wings relative to the central portion. Some versions are marked with the name of the manufacturer, \\"CaronBros\\" on one wing tip of the back copper plate. Two examples are illustrated, neither with any maker marks, and both 2nd issue from the collection of AVM A.E. Godfrey during his tenure with the CAF. He had one set gold- and silver-plated, probably to be worn on a dress uniform at the time. A replica set of several of the early 1920s insignia patterns were manufactured in 1967. The strike quality does not match the originals, but to the untrained eye, they can appear to have originated from the 1920s production. The pilots wing in this replica set retains the hallmark.

It is a vermiform mesozoan parasite that infects the renal appendages of the cephalopod Octopus sasakii. The name is derived from the Shimanto River, which is the longest river in Shikoku, and flows into Tosa Bay. A study from 2000-06 used 59 specimens obtained from fishermen at Tosa Bay and Kii Strait Japan. O. sasakii is a cephalopod found mainly in the shallow-water of Southern Japan. Research found that only those of certain sizes and geographical locations can be infected by D.shimantoense. There are many species of dicyemids. Examination of the calotte (the anterior ends of dicyemids ) is required to distinguish them. D. shimantoense inserts the conical calottes into intracellular folds of renal appendages. Characteristics The body length of D. shimantoense can reach up to 3000Œºm. Peripheral cells consist of 4 propolars, 5 metapolars, 2-4 parapolars, and 10-12 trunk cells. There are infusoriform embryos of up to 37 cells. There are 2 nuclei in each cell, and 22 peripheral cells. Life cycle The Dicyemids have three stages of life. 1\\\\. The nematogen is the asexual stage of dicyemids which produce vermiform larvae in the axial cells 2\\\\. Nematogens continue to reproduce in the kidneys until the vermiform matures into rhombogens 3\\\\. Rhombogens contain hermaphroditic gonads within the axial cell called the infusorigens (gonads which produce gametes of various sizes) Transmission The infection of the parasite are found in the kidneys (there is an independent infection of each kidney). In O. sasakii, however, the mode of transmission is currently unknown.

This document consists of 6 Principles. For the full text see Principles of Medical Ethics relevant to the Role of Health Personnel, particularly Physicians, in the Protection of Prisoners and Detainees against Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman or Degrading Treatment or Punishment adopted by General Assembly resolution 37/194 of 18 December 1982, UN Information Office, Ref: A/Res/37/194. See IRCT, International Declarations and Conventions, updated in December 1996, p. 16. In the preamble, the General Assembly warns that ‚Äúnot infrequently members of medical profession or other health personnel are engaged in activities which are difficult to reconcile with medical ethics.‚Äù Quoted from the Office of the UN High Commissioner for Human Rights, Combating Torture, Fact Sheet, No. 4 (Rev. 1), New York Office, May 2002, p. 7. Principle 1 of the above instrument has made it the duty of the medical personnel, particularly physicians, not to discriminate against those who are ‚Äúimprisoned or detained.‚Äù It is a ‚Äúgross contravention of medical ethics‚Äù for them ‚Äúto engage, actively or passively, in acts which constitute participation in, complicity in, incitement to or attempts to commit torture or other cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment.‚Äù (Principle 2) They must not apply ‚Äútheir knowledge and skills in order to assist in the interrogation of prisoners‚Äù or to certify their fitness for punishment. (Principle 4) They should not participate in ‚Äúrestraining a prisoner‚Äù unless it is necessary on medical grounds. (Principle 5) The widespread use of torture and other inhuman and usual treatment as an aftereffect of the terrorist incident of 11 September 11 2001, has made the UN Principles of Medical Ethics more relevant. What follows is an excerpt from an article by American author and psychiatrist Dr. Robert J. Lifton: ‚ÄúThere is increasing evidence that US doctors, nurses and medics have been complicit in torture and other illegal procedures in Iraq, Afghanistan and Guantanamo Bay. Such medical complicity suggests still another disturbing dimension of this broadening scandal. We know that medical personnel have failed to report to higher authorities wounds that were clearly caused by torture and that they have neglected to take steps to interrupt this torture. In addition, they have turned over prisoners' medical records to interrogators who could use them to exploit the prisoners' weaknesses or vulnerabilities. We have not yet learned the extent of medical involvement in delaying and possibly falsifying the death certificates of prisoners who have been killed by torturers.‚Äù Robert J. Lifton, ‚ÄúDoctors and Torture,‚Äù New England Journal of Medicine, Volume 351, No 5, July 29, 2004, pp. 415-416. While condemning the practice of torture in jails, the Executive Director of the Physicians for Human Rights has referred to the lack of effective guidelines for medical professionals dealing with prisoners. He has reiterated that efforts must include ‚Äúa robust examination of guidance provided to health professionals who work in settings where interrogations occur, since it appears that guidance for medical personnel is almost entirely lacking.‚Äù As quoted by Ken Agar-Newman in American Journal of Nurses, Vol. 105, No. 4, April 2005, pp. 15-17. Also see Statement of Leonard Rubenstein, Executive Director, Physicians for Human Rights, in American Civil Liberties Union, International Human Rights, July 2, 2004. It is an urgent necessity today for the international community to scrutinize the present legal instruments on the question of ethics on behalf of medical professionals on the one hand and their protection against forceful involvement in torture on the other. The 1982 Un Principles of Medical Ethics is non-binding and impotent. There is no effective international body to monitor the implementation of this international legal instrument. There is an immediate need for its promotion to a binding treaty among nations and an effective monitoring body to this effect. Mossallanejad, E. (2005). Torture in the Age of Fear.

Today Herbert has his own practice, DREISEITLconsulting, to advice cities and regions and is teaching at NUS in Singapore. His particular expertise is in combining artistic aspects with environmental planning and implementation with regards to water in an urban setting. His work is considered to be at the leading edge in urban hydrology and the treatment of waste and stormwater, realizing sustainable infrastructure, which combines city resource needs with space for nature and people. To irrigate topics related to sustainable infrastructure he founded the Liveable Cities Lab in the Danish Ramboll Group, focusing on research and consultation. His rich experience is in great demand by cities around the world. Herbert Dreiseitl has been described as \\"the international doyen of landscape design with water\\".Richardson, Tim (2012).

His approach focuses more attention on water and its natural flow, not only as an aesthetic element, but by designing to incorporate effective water-management infrastructure and heeding its role as an important ecological and social tool. The humanistic aspect of his approach is recognised and respected by his peers because of its visible results. Dreiseitl's philosophy has particularly come of age at the present time, where climate change and water supply have been put high on the agenda of key institutions such as the IMF, World Bank, Asian Development Bank and world governmentshttp://www.wri.org/event/2013/04/fostering-growth-and-poverty- reduction-world-immense-risk (video) accessed: 06.06.13http://www.adb.org/about/policies-and-strategies accessed: 06.06.13 and are named as two of the top five global risks facing companies today. accessed: 06.06.13 Life and career Potsdamer Platz: Atelier Dreiseitl developed the scheme for rainwater harvest, circulation and display. Dreiseitl was born in Ulm, Germany, where he attended the Ulm Waldorf School.http://www.anthromedia.net/en/news-details/article/herbert-dreiseitl- appointed-loeb-fellow-at-harvard-university/ accessed: 07.05.13 He trained as an artist and did apprenticeships in England, Norway and Germany.http://www.gardenvisit.com/biography/herbert_dreiseitl accessed: 29.05.13 He was highly influenced by the philosophies of Rudolf Steiner, Hugo K√ºkelhaus and Joseph Beuys. During his period of civil service, Dreiseitl initiated an art therapy program for young drug addicts, which was so successful that he continued for four years. Whilst there, he recognised that for young people, the urban environment is very important for liveability and public health. So he decided to work in public space to improve the conditions in cities. His first major public work was an award-winning fountain for a new garden for the blind, designed by landscape architects Eppinger + Schmid. In preparation for his design, Dreiseitl met regularly with a group of interested blind people to better understand how they experience the world without sight. After founding his studio Atelier Dreiseitl, Dreiseitl worked on his first stormwater management plan in 1981, celebrating and bringing water to the surface in a new suburb in Lausanne, Switzerland.Brown, Brenda J (2001). Harvesting What You Can't Hold Tight. Landscape Architecture Magazine, page 98. Over the past 30 years, he has completed numerous projects with Atelier Dreiseitl, ranging from modest water features to large-scale water management systems, including Renzo Piano's Potsdamer Platz in Berlin, Norman Foster's McLaren Technology Centre in London and the SolarCity Linz, Austria. In 2011, Dreiseitl was appointed Loeb Fellow at the Graduate School of Design at Harvard University, becoming one of the few non-US citizens to have been accepted on the programme. As a Loeb Fellow, Herbert explored the history of water and society, the changing exogenous water security environments, and design tools for managing global water-related risks.http://www.gsd.harvard.edu/#/people/herbertdreiseitl.html accessed: 07.05.13 In April 2013, Dreiseitl merged Atelier Dreiseitl with the Ramboll Group.http://www.ramboll.com/news/viewnews?newsid=87BDE1F3-1D7C-4049-B628-514078A0CF5B accessed: 29.05.13 Dreiseitl is helping to shape cities in many parts of the world to become more resilient by integrating blue and green structures even in dense urban spaces. Herbert is a visiting professor at the National University of Singapore focusing on teaching and research. With his consultancy DREISEITLconsulting Herbert runs workshops and pilot projects to encourage cities to implement better solutions to current urban challenges.

She initially patrolled around Woods Hole, Massachusetts, speaking to various vessels to determine their identities. She spent the summer of 1918 on outward patrol, working with the patrol boats USS Patrol No. 6 (SP-54), USS Rhebal (SP-1195), and USS Felicia (SP-642), the submarine chaser , and a patrol boat with the section patrol number SP-50 of which no records have been found.

Cayley died of heart disease while making the arduous trip to London. The Farmer‚Äôs Magazine gave Caley a glowing obituary as a \\"farmers' friend\\", who \\"stood with the farmers, by the farmers, and for the farmers.\\" Family Cayley was born at Newbold Hall near Market Weighton. He died at Dean's Yard, Westminster. His parents John Cayley (1786‚Äì1846) and Elizabeth Sarah Stillingfleet (1787‚Äì1867) were both deaf and dumb. His mother was descended from Edward Stillingfleet, Bishop of Worcester. He was a fine cricketer. On 30 August 1823 he married a cousin, Emma Cayley (c.1797‚Äì1848), daughter of Sir George Cayley, the aeronautical baronet. They had three sons: * Edward Stillingfleet Cayley (1824‚Äì84), an author, barrister and landowner educated at Eton and Trinity College, Cambridge. He wrote on the European revolutions of 1848 and the Franco-German war of 1870. In 1872 he married Ellen Louisa Awdry (1845‚Äì1903), daughter of Ambrose Awdry of Seend, Wiltshire *George John Cayley (1826‚Äì78), a barrister educated at Eton and Trinity College, Cambridge (though he never took his degree). He had left-wing tendencies and in 1868 stood as the Working Man's candidate for Scarborough in the general election. He published several pieces of light verse, a book on electoral reform and the working classes, and a popular book about travels in Spain. The frontispiece of this book shows him with a magnificent mid-Victorian beard. He had a reputation as an accomplished metal-worker; in 1862 he and the painter George Frederick Watts designed the challenge shield for a national shooting championship at Wimbledon. He also was an accomplished tennis-player; he helped to develop several types of tennis racket, and wrote an article on the game for the Edinburgh Review in 1875. He had homes at Wydale Hall, Snainton, North Yorkshire and in Westminster. In 1860 he married Mary Anne Frances Wilmot (c.1843‚Äì1908); they had three children: ** Hugh Cayley (1861‚Äì1924), educated at Trinity College, Cambridge, who lived at Wydale and married Rosa Louisa Violet (d. 1915), daughter of Johann Seelig of Hanover **Arthur Cayley (1862‚Äì68) **Violet Cayley (b. 1865), who took part in amateur theatricals at public theatres in Norfolk *Charles Digby Cayley (1827‚Äì44), educated at Eton, who became a midshipman in the Royal Navy, was awarded a medal for his part in activities in the Levant, and drowned with a companion when a squall hit the sailing-boat they were in off Largs, Scotland.

The show was broadcast nationally across Australia from 2002 to 2013 and is partly available as a podcast. The program described itself as ‚Äúradio abstraction for listening pleasure‚Äù, and was labelled by others as ‚Äúaudio collage‚Äù, ‚Äúhybrid radio‚Äù, and an ‚Äúaural equivalent of the avant-garde cut-up‚Äù.Night Air - About.

Retrieved 2010-12-07 The themes changed with each episode, and these were the driving force for the content of the show.  History and format  The Night Air began production in 2002. It was conceived by Tony Barrell, Diane Dean, Brent Clough and John Jacobs. It was a remix program that focused on recontextualising other audio material, including radio drama and documentary, news, interviews, talkback, short stories, poetry, music and film. Most of the programs were locally produced for the series, with content sourced both from the Radio National archives and external sources, although some episodes were programs sourced from overseas producers, such as a short series of programs from the like-minded American radio program Radiolab. The format built on those established in previous montage and cut-up programs that Barrell had worked on at Triple J in the 1970s and 1980s, such as Sunday Afternoon at the Movies and Watching the Radio with the TV Off. Clough said the program made ‚Äúmusic out of talk‚Äù, while Jacobs described the process as one of ‚Äúdistillation and subtractive synthesis‚Äù. Forming part of Radio National‚Äôs arts and music programming, The Night Air was a pre-recorded show divided into two parts. Both parts were broadcast and streamed on Sundays from 8.30 pm to 10.00 pm AEST. Part 1 is then repeated at 9.30 pm Friday, and Part 2 at 12.00 am Sunday. The show began partial podcasting in 2005 when the station first commenced the practice, with Part 1 available for four weeks after the initial airing time. Cancellation In late 2012 Radio National manager Michael Mason announced that several long-running arts programs would be cancelled and that some staff would be laid off. The official reason given was the combination of budget restrictions and dwindling audiences for these kinds of programs, which Mason said were expensive to produce, with the ABC seeking to save $1 million by axing the programs. The series decommissioned at the end of 2012 included The Night Air, the radio drama series Airplay, the book-reading programs The Book Reading and Sunday Story, the arts magazine program Creative Instinct, the language program Lingua Franca and the film review program MovieTime, (which concluded shortly after the retirement of its long-serving presenter Julie Rigg in late 2012). The Night Air ceased production in November 2012. A short season of \\"best of\\" programs was broadcast during December 2012-January 2013. The final episode of the series aired on Sunday 27 January 2013. Brent Clough left the ABC in late April 2013, after 25 years with the national broadcaster. The Night Air is now an archived program that is no longer broadcast. Podcast episodes of the series remain available for download from the Night Air page on the Radio National website.

It organizes and promotes permanent and temporary exhibitions of documents and items that portray the activities of Civil Police in the history of Rio de Janeiro since colonial times. It was founded in 1912 and was initially used only for the instruction of police academy students, but opened to the public in the 1930s. The museum is headquartered in a French eclectic style building constructed in 1910 by the architect Heitor de Mello. It is registered under the International Council of Museums as a scientific museum. Collections The museum is divided into collections related to: *the establishment of the police force and its history *uniformed police in the former federal capital *technical police *the former political police *initial communications *\\"forbidden games\\" *firearms and armament The museum also contains materials confiscated from the fascist Brazilian Integralism movement; items related to the Nazi movement in Brazil, specifically flags, streamers, and \\"children's shoes with a swastika cross design\\"; and printed materials confiscated from the Brazilian Communist Party. Museum Collection of Black Magic The Museum Collection of Black Magic () was formed at the Civil Police Museum in the 1920s to house religious objects related to Afro- Brazilian religions, specifically those of Candombl√© and Umbanda traditions. The police were charged with the suppression of baixo espiritismo, or low spiritism under the revised penal code of the First Republic; anti-sorcery and witchcraft statutes were issued on 11 October 1890. Items were confiscated from Candombl√© terreiros, which were viewed variously as disruptive, sinister, or grotesque. The terreiros were also viewed as sympathetic to Communism. Mario de Andrade, the creator of SPHAN, now the National Institute of Historic and Artistic Heritage, added the collection to the initial list of national heritage monuments in 1938. As a result, the Museum Collection of Black Magic was the first protected ethnographic collection in Brazil. The Museum Collection of Black Magic has not been exhibited to the public since 1999.

By 1970, Time decided to sell its broadcasting operations and to concentrate in cable development. Eventually Time Life joined Sterling Manhattan Cable, owned by Charles Dolan and launched Home Box Office, which eventually became the largest premium television service in the United States. (Due to an early financial loss, Dolan eventually sold his stake of HBO to Time Inc. Time merged with Warner Communications, Inc. in 1989, as HBO became part of Time Warner (now WarnerMedia).)

WOOD-TV is owned today by Nexstar Media Group. Except for KERO-TV, each of these television stations also had AM and FM radio operations; when most of its television stations were sold to McGraw-Hill in 1972, FCC regulations at the time required Time-Life to sell its radio stations to different parties. (KERO's then-owners sold off its radio station in 1955, years before Time-Life acquired KERO-TV.) International operations Time Life was also a financial backer for commercial TV broadcasting outside the United States, mostly in Middle and South America. With a joint venture between CBS and Goar Mestre they backed in Argentina, PROVENTEL in Venezuela (now VTV) and Panamericana Televisi√≥n in Peru. In Brazil, they backed Rede Globo, owned by the Marinho family. Time Life's investments in the United States, Middle and South America in the 1950s and 1960s were largely unsuccessful, due to the stations' owners unhappy with their agreements. The only exception was TV Globo in Brazil, owned by the Marinho family, which was financially backed by Time Life until 1970. Television Syndication Time Life Television was most notable as the U.S. distributor of television programming produced by the BBC, including Doctor Who and Monty Python's Flying Circus. Time-Life's deal with the BBC expired on April 30, 1981. The U.S. rights to Monty Python's Flying Circus would be transferred to Devillier Donegan Enterprises (in a deal that followed the Monty Python troupe gaining ownership of the series months before), while the rest of BBC's output would be spun off to Lionheart Television, a distributor that would later be absorbed by BBC Worldwide. Non- BBC-related programming distributed or produced by Time Life Television, including most of the Talent Associates library, would later be transferred to HBO; these programs today would be owned by HBO Entertainment and Warner Bros.

Reason, c. 1890s Patrick Henry Reason, first named Patrice Rison (March 17, 1816 ‚Äì August 12, 1898), was one of the earliest African-American engravers and lithographers in the United States. He was active as an abolitionist (along with his brother Charles Lewis Reason). He was a leader in a fraternal order, gaining recognition for Hamilton Lodge No. 710, New York, as part of the Grand United Order of Odd Fellows in America. Early life and education Reason was born in 1816 in New York City as one of four children. His father, Michel Rison, was native to St. Anne Island, Guadeloupe, and his mother, Elizabeth Melville, was native to Saint- Domingue, the former French colony that achieved independence as Haiti. He was baptized Patrice Rison in April 1816. His sister Policarpe died at age four in 1818. With his two brothers Elver and Charles L. Reason, Patrick attended New York's African Free School. At the age of 13, his drawing of the school building was engraved for the frontispiece of Charles C. Andrews's history of the school published in 1830. He was apprenticed to Stephen Henry Gimber (1806-1862), an English engraver and lithographer in the city.Porter, Dorothy B., \\"Patrick H. Reason\\", Dictionary of American Negro Biography, edited by Rayford W. Logan and Michael R. Winston, 1982. Career Engraving of a kneeling slave, 1835, Patrick H. Reason Reason set up his own shop, where he engraved portraits and other images for anti-slavery and other books and journals, as well as for individuals. His engravings include an 1835 version of the kneeling female slave, an 1840 portrait of United States Senator Benjamin Tappan (R-Ohio), and the frontispiece portrait for the 1849 autobiography of Henry Bibb, a fugitive from slavery who became an abolitionist lecturer. An 1840 lithograph portrait of Bibb has also been attributed to Reason. As a member of the New York Philomathean Society, Reason and others petitioned but were refused inclusion in an American fraternal organization, the Independent Order of Odd Fellows. They won recognition from the British-based Grand United Order of Odd Fellows as Philomathean Lodge No. 646 (which in turn instituted Hamilton Lodge No. 710), New York. Reason designed the membership certificate, at one point served as the lodge's grand master, and in 1858 composed the Ruth degree, the first to be conferred upon female members. In 1869, Reason moved with his family to Cleveland, Ohio. There he joined the firm of Sylvester Hogan, where he created jewelry and made plate engravings until his death in 1898. Marriage and family In 1862, Reason married Esther Cunningham (1835-1920) of Leeds, England. Their son, Charles Lewis Reason (named for Patrick's brother), was born in 1867. He became a doctor and practiced medicine in Cleveland, Ohio. His wife died before they had children. Charles Reason died a widower in Elyria, southwest of Cleveland. He had no descendants.Death Certificate for Charles Reason, M.D.,dated February 18, 1931, Certificate no. 40723, State of Ohio, Department of Health, Bureau of Vital Statistics, Columbus, Ohio.

The tournament itself was a two-stage, single-elimination tournament of 118-pounders ‚Äì which began with two semifinal bouts on Saturday, Dec. 11, 2010, in the Battle at the Boat series from the Emerald Queen Casino in Tacoma, Wash. In the opening bout, undefeated, world-ranked rising star Abner Mares of Guadalajara Jalisco, Mexico, faced two-division world champion Vic Darchinyan of Sydney, Australia, by way of Armenia. In the main event, Perez and Agbeko squared off against each other for the second time. They had fought a Fight of the Year candidate the previous October.  Build up  Rather than an immediate rematch with Perez and Mares, Perez faced Joseph Agbeko for the second time in the first round for his IBF, which he won from him, in Showtime's upcoming bantamweight tournament while Mares faces Vic Darchinyan. The winners of both fights will face each other sometime in early 2011. They are barely unknown outside of boxing circles, fighting in a 118-pound division that rarely gets any attention. But they've all signed on for a single- elimination tournament in hopes of not only making a name for themselves, but also providing boxing fans with some exciting fights. The tournament originally was scheduled for Leon, Mexico, but Showtime did a site survey and realized that the cost for staging the event there - including security in a region that has been besieged by violence among the drug cartels - would be prohibitive. When no venue could be secured in Los Angeles, the event was moved to Tacoma, Wash. Perez was the only current champion, (Vic Darchinyan was the IBO champion, but that organization lacks real recognition by the International Boxing Hall of Fame, other organizations, boxing magazines and fans) while Agbeko had held world titles and Mares was a top contender.

New York Graphic Society, 287 N.Y. 302 (1942), was a case decided by the New York Court of Appeals that held that, while the copyright in a work of authorship is distinct from the tangible embodiment of the work, if the only tangible embodiment of the work is transferred the copyright is also presumptively transferred.Pushman v. New York Graphic Society, 287 N.Y. 302, 308 (1942) Factual background The plaintiff Hovsep Pushman was an artist that finished a work entitled When Autumn is Here in 1930. That same year, Pushman gave the painting to Grand Central Art Galleries to arrange a sale of the work. Upon giving the painting to Grand Central Art Galleries, Pushman did not negotiate any reservation reproduction rights. Grand Central Art Galleries sold the painting to the University of Illinois for $3,600.Pushman, 287 N.Y. at 305 The painting remained with the University until it sold reproduction rights to the defendant, New York Graphic Society. Pushman sued for an injunction against reproduction of the painting. The defendant moved to dismiss the complaint, and the motion was granted by the trial court and affirmed by the New York Supreme Court, Appellate Division.Pushman, 287 N.Y. at 306 Decision The court first recognized that the copyright in a work exists separately from the tangible embodiment of the work. But on the authority of the case Parton v. Prang, the court held that to reserve the copyright when the sole tangible embodiment of the work is transferred, the author must make an express reservation at the time of the transfer. The court held that Pushman's sale was unconditional because he did not expressly reserve any rights at the time of the transfer.Pushman, 287 N.Y. at 308 Impact The holding in Pushman created what was subsequently termed the Pushman presumption, which required an author to expressly reserve rights when transferring the chattel that embodied a work or risk transferring the rights as well. The holding in Pushman was criticized and subject to various statutory and judicial limitations.Forward v. Thorogood, 985 F.2d 604 (1st Cir. 1993) Pushman was abrogated by ¬ß 202 of the Copyright Act of 1976, which establishes that the transfer of a tangible embodiment of a copyrighted work does not of itself transfer the copyright.Robert A.

She was appointed parliamentary secretary for industry, research and innovation to the Minister of Jobs, Tourism and Innovation on March 14, 2011. She served as Minister of Advanced Education and Labour Market Development in the government of B.C. from June 2009 to October 2010 when she was appointed Minister of Regional Economic and Skills Development. She resigned her cabinet post in November 2010 to stand for election as the leader of the British Columbia Liberal Party, but withdrew from the campaign on February 16, 2011. The election subsequently occurred on February 26, 2011 and was won by Christy Clark, the current premier of British Columbia. She was formerly the Minister of Social Development (2012). Biography Stilwell graduated from the University of Calgary Medical School, and received further training in nuclear medicine at the University of British Columbia and in radiology at the University of Toronto. She served for several years as the head of nuclear medicine at St. Paul's Hospital, Surrey Memorial Hospital, and Abbotsford Regional Hospital and Cancer Clinic, but left all those positions in 2009 to run for public office. Prior to that, she worked at BC Women's Hospital, where she served as co-medical director of the Breast Health Program as well as being the staff radiologist. Along with serving as a practicing physician and administrator, she was the clinical assistant professor in the Department of Radiology at the University of British Columbia. In addition to her professional capacities, Stilwell also served as the co-chair of the Canadian Breast Cancer Foundation 2020 Task Force, and was past chair of the Canadian Breast Cancer Foundation/BC Yukon Chapter. She has also served on the board of the Canadian Breast Cancer Research Alliance and on the BC Women's Hospital Foundation Board. Campaign for the BC Liberal Party leadership After entering the BC Liberal Party's 2011 leadership campaign, Stilwell focused her attention firmly on the importance of building a knowledge-based economy to ensure BC‚Äôs future prosperity;‚ÄúMoira Stilwell: BC needs right leader for knowledge economy‚Äù. The Georgia Straight, November 30, 2010. increasing the minimum wage in BC from $8/hour to $10/hour; and reducing the interest rate that students in BC pay for loans to finance their studies ‚ÄúBC postsecondary student loan interest rate should be lowered, says Moira Stilwell‚Äù. The Georgia Straight, November 29, 2010. Stilwell dropped out of the campaign on February 16, 2011, announcing her support for George Abbott.\\"Stilwell backs Abbott, Mayne to follow\\". The Province, February 17, 2011. Action Plan for Repatriating B.C. Medical Students Studying Abroad and Conflict of Interests In 2012, Moira wrote a letter and report titled \\"Action Plan for Repatriating B.C. Medical Students Studying Abroad\\" to Mike de Jong, the Minister of Health Services, on the subject of British Columbians who wanted to return to Canada for their medical residency. In her report, she admits \\"The Ministry of Health Services and the UBC Faculty of Medicine maintain that BC medical students studying abroad must be treated the same as immigrant physicians applying to the BC IMG program because to do otherwise would be a violation of human rights and the Canadian Charter of Rights\\" but Moira argued that Canadians Studying Abroad (CSAs) should be treated the same as Canadian and American trained medical school graduates i.e. preferentially treated over International Medical Graduates (IMGs). International Medical Graduates often have a very difficult time obtaining very limited residency positions in Canada. As reported in Maclean's and The Tyee, Moira had an apparent and undisclosed personal stake and conflict of interest in this issue, as her son, Kevin Lichtenstein, was studying medicine at an international university, and thus would benefit from an easier residency process. Allegations of Corruption in Son's Medical Residency Selection On February 6 2015, The Tyee reported that, \\"Cardiac surgeons on a selection committee at St. Paul's Hospital manipulated the hiring process for a training position so they could hire a student who was the son of their boss and of a provincial cabinet minister [Stilwell], documents show.\\" During the selection process for residency, Dr. Cook at the University of British Columbia created an irregularity in the residency matching process where they left a spot open in during the first iteration of the matching process. Dr. Cook stated they had a candidate in mind who is a Canadian [who] studied medicine abroad and did an elective rotation with them. This candidate would not be eligible for 1st iteration but would be eligible for 2nd iteration. Dr. Wong, also with UBC, stated that the process followed was not \\"fair or transparent or equitable for the other CaRMS candidates,\\" and further that \\"the Program's actions were not compliant with the CaRMS rules and procedures and that this irregularity could be contested to CaRMS in the future by a candidate and/or a medical school.\\" Ultimately, the Cardiac Surgery residency slot was opened for a 2nd iteration, a CaRMS irregularity. In that 2nd iteration, over 96 applicants applied, and Kevin Lichtenstein, the son of Sam Lichtenstein and Moira Stilwell, was selected as the successful candidate. As Kevin Lichtenstein was an international medical graduate, he was not eligible to apply to the 1st iteration of the Cardiac Surgery program at UBC. However, because of the irregularity that occurred (which notably was not compliant with the CaRMS rules), Kevin Lichtenstein was able to apply and gain entrance into the program.

Plot summary In Egg of the Phoenix, the player characters (PCs) start off investigating a slaver ring, and must ultimately work to save the entire land of New Empyrea from destruction by the lords of Elemental Evil. The module includes dungeons, wilderness adventures, time travel, and extraplanar journeys. Publication history I12 Egg of the Phoenix was designed by Frank Mentzer, with additional design, development, and editing by Paul Jaquays. The module's cover is by Keith Parkinson, and was published by TSR in 1987 as an eighty- page book, a twenty-page booklet, and an unattached outer folder. The booklet contains a map and pre-generated PCs. This module was a linkage of three formerly unlinked scenarios originally published in the RPGA modules R1 through R4. Reception Ken Rolston reviewed Egg of the Phoenix for Dragon magazine No. 133. He felt that the first three scenarios were \\"original, challenging, and entertaining, particularly in their exploitation of the peculiar logic of the AD&D; game universe\\", but had reservations about the final scenario, which \\"despite having a plausible game rationale and logical self-consistency, strikes me as gross and overly busy rather than lean and elegant\\". He felt that assembling these tournament scenarios into an epic campaign was not very successful, because Mentzer had not designed them as a sequence, and they originally had nothing to do with one another. He said, \\"the narrative frame isn't particularly persuasive, nor do the supplemental encounters or transitions match the tone and theme of Mentzer's original tournament designs\\", and \\"the introductory motivations for involving the PCs in the epic quest are rather arbitrary\\". Rolston also noted some careless production errors, such as a number of typos in the first few pages, and that the text refers to the map book as a twenty-page center pullout. Despite his complaints that the campaign frame and the production quality were not satisfactory, Rolston concluded by saying: \\"There's some very good stuff in here: nine sessions or more of solid and occasionally brilliant material.

According to witnesses, an undisclosed number of tribal citizens, police officers and at least two journalists were amongst those killed. Eyewitnesses claimed that a deafening sound occurred followed by clouds of dust and smoke, with dozens of people on the ground, who were bleeding and crying, with reports of body parts scattered within the compound. A local administration later confirmed to the media that a suicide bomber on a motorbike had detonated his explosives, after he had driven up to a sitting area at the meeting. Whereas the second suicide attacker, also on a motorcycle had detonated his explosive device at the gate to this government compound. It was reported that both bombers were disguised in police uniforms. A possible target for these suicide attacks was Mohmand's top political official, Amjad Ali Khan, who was not killed or injured in the attacks. Khan later confirmed that the suicide bombers had packed their suicide vests with ball-bearings, thus increasing the number of casualties.

It contains a variety of adventure scenarios written by different authors, and received mostly positive reviews. Plot summary Adventure Pack I is a collection of eight scenarios and three mini-scenarios, including a mystery at a magical circus (written by Warren Spector), a war between assassins (written by Steve Perrin), and a mission to the spinning sky castle of a dying storm giant (written by Paul Jaquays). The adventures average 8-10 pages in length, and are intended for character levels 4-10. The individual scenarios are titled \\"Blood and Laurels\\", \\"The Circus of Gandolfo\\", \\"The House of Long Knives\\", \\"The Lauros Road Bandits\\", \\"Reign of Triumph\\", \\"Scavenger Hunt\\", \\"Sharla's Zoo\\", \\"Steaks\\", \\"Terror in Skytumble Tor\\", \\"To Kill A Kraken\\" and \\"The Weird Woods of Baron Orchid\\". Publication history Adventure Pack I was edited by Deborah Christian with cover art by Jeff Easley; it was published by TSR in 1987 as a 96-page book. The list of authors includes: Steve Perrin, Anne Gray McCready, Warren Spector and Paul Jaquays. Reception In his review for Adventure Pack I for White Dwarf No. 92, Graeme Davis said, \\"I'm confused over why this product is called I13 rather than REF5; it certainly has more in common with the two Books of Lairs than with any of the Desert of Desolation adventures\\". Of the adventures, he said that \\"some are thinly-disguised monster bashes, whilst others rely on thought and subtlety. Some look like Book of Lairs ideas which grew in the writing, and some are not so easily classified.\\" Davis concluded by noting that the adventures were designed to be used at any point in a game, and were generally long enough for a single evening of play. He added that the styles of the scenarios were so varied that they might not all suit a group's play style, but said, \\"However, even so I13 is worth a look if you play a lot of AD&D; and like to have fill-in adventures handy.\\" Ken Rolston briefly reviewed Adventure Pack I for Dragon magazine No. 129 (January 1988). Rolston called it \\"a good collection of short, stand-alone AD&D; game adventures by a number of established and promising designers\\". He felt the plots, tones, and flavors of the adventures were particularly original and offbeat. His favorites were \\"Steaks\\" by Allen Varney (\\"a compact, charming, nicely staged gaming vignette with a clever central plot device\\") and \\"Terror in Skytumble Tor\\" by Paul Jaquays (\\"a sharp little adventure with clever plot devices and vivid NPCs in a derelict sky castle that is ponderously tumbling end-over-end toward the earth\\"). Rolston felt that while reading long modules could be rather dull, these short adventures were a good length. He considered them long enough to present an idea, but short enough to read straight through without getting bored, and \\"the varied tones ‚Äî some light and clever, some earnest and heroic ‚Äî make for a more pleasant reading experience\\". He concluded that \\"the adventures here are comfortably conventional in their AD&D; game feel, and can easily be slipped into a typical house campaign\\". Lawrence Schick, in his 1991 book Heroic Worlds, calls the storm giant scenario by Paul Jaquays \\"a gem\\".

Sadly, in 1996 Lee died in a car crash. In English, his most famous work is The Other Side of Dark Remembrance, which was originally published in 1979 as a shorter story titled Division. From 1986 until his early death, Lee was an editor of Historical Criticism published by Research Institute for Historical Problems. Lee primarily focused on the Korean independence movement. His work on Singanhoe, an independence group, which culminated in Study of Singanhoe (Singanhoe yeongu, 1993), earned Lee the 8th Danjae Scholastic Award. Study of Singanhoe is considered to be the first research text that provides an unbiased view of Singanhoe. In 1993, he published a full-length novel The Country of Laozi and Zhuangzi (Nojawa jangjaui nara). Another novel The Leaves Make Lights of Longing (Namunipdeureun grieun bulbiteul mandeunda), appeared in the 1997 Spring issue of World Literature, after Lee's death.

Disgusted by how the record company managed the group, bassist Fr√©d√©ric Vitani left and gave his place to Damien Lef√®vre. Still animated by the same energy, the group worked on its new repertory, dedicating itself to concerts until December (the Fl√®che d'Or, the Blueser, the P√©niche Makara, the Kiosque Flottant, the squat at the Grange aux Belles...) and then undertook to record the EP L'Affaire in a cellar in Paris, in Saint-Michel. Romain Humeau dedicated himself completely to the recording and production: > \\"We were determined not to record the instruments in a crude way but rather > to perfect the sound. Unfortunately, many engineers don't take the time to > do this. We didn't want a flat, sterile sound, but rather an acid one, even > if that was disturbing to the ear.\\" In January 1999, the EP was commercially distributed and the group then began a tedious tour throughout France, alternating between festivals, bars and caf√©s. The group was then completely independent: Nicolas Courret handled the CD artwork, Damien Lef√®vre concerts, Estelle Humeau fanzines and Romain Humeau relations with the press. Romain also arranged some pieces at this time for 1, 2, 3 Soleils and Helena Noguerra. In May 1999, the group was noticed by Peter Von Poehl and Bertrand Burgalat, who were looking for musicians to back Michel Houellebecq:Biography, Eiffel, Allmusic. Accessed on line 11 December 2010. \\"Bertrand Burgalat discovered us like that. We managed to do a concert at MCM Caf√©, and he came to see us. He spoke about us to some record companies. We were indebted to him a fair amount then. \\" (Romain Humeau, March 2006) In July, after a few concerts with Michel Houellebecq (The Aquaplanning festival and La Route du Rock), Roman and Damien Nicolas worked on Houellebecq's album Pr√©sence Humaine, including writing the music for the title track on the album, as well as for another track, \\"Plein √©t√©\\". Eiffel set out again for nearly a year, almost always remaining sequestered and recording various pieces that began to circulate through the musical world. They were contacted by the record label Labels, with which they signed in May 2000. They went on tour again, alongside Dionysos and Papas Fritas. In July, the band recorded a series of pieces in a cellar and a barn, songs that give rise to the EP Abricotine & Quality Street, which was released in August. The piece \\"Te revoir\\" had some success and allowed them to shoot a music video directed by Henri-Jean Debon. Romain Humeau: \\"What we liked about him was that he knew how to expand sounds and words with images without necessarily sticking a story onto them.\\" During the next six months, the group polished the pieces that give birth to their first album. Abricotine and Le Quart d'heure des ahuris Eiffel's first album, Abricotine, was released on 9 January 2001. The acid sound and surrealist lyrics, already present on their EPs, were the hallmarks of this album, which included, among other pieces, \\"Te revoir\\", \\"Hype\\", and also \\"Je voudrais pas crever\\", a poem written by Boris Vian which the group set to music. Also, in the same year, Romain Humeau arranged the strings for the Noir D√©sir song \\"Des visages, des figures\\", on the album of the same name. An extensive tour of around a hundred dates across France followed, including Printemps de Bourges and the F√™te de l'Humanit√© but also the Boule Noire, Le Trabendo and the Elys√©e-Montmartre. The group took a break in December before starting the recording of their second album, Le Quart d'heure des ahuris (again written, composed, arranged, recorded and mixed by Roman Humeau) in February 2002 at Arconques. In August the departure of drummer Nicolas Courret was announced; he was replaced by Xavier Bray. The album was released on 10 September. The sound was more direct, saturated with guitars, the mood dark and hypnotic; its theme was the loss of direction as well as Death. Even if the music was less harmonically rich than previous productions, the lyrics were still good. Notable singles were \\"Au n√©ant\\", \\"Tu vois loin\\" and \\"T'as tout, tu profites de rien\\". The group set out again on what should have been a small breaking-in tour for their new album; this tour eventually included 32 dates, some of which were shared with Nada Surf. In March 2003 a clip was filmed for \\"Tu vois loin\\" by Mathieu Amalric at the Gare de l'Est. In April, Xavier Bray left the group, who then engaged Emiliano Turi, Italian-born jazz drummer. The group then decided to select a few dates between July and December 2003 to record a DVD and a live double album. They took advantage of three concerts at the Maroquinerie (9, 10 and 11 December) to record one of the two discs of the album, accompanied by a string quartet as well as two oboists. Les Yeux ferm√©s and L'√âternit√© de l'instant In March 2004, the double album Les Yeux ferm√©s as well as a DVD of their 2003 concert at Eurock√©ennes were available for sale. The members of Eiffel were exhausted and decided to take a break before going back to work. Romain Humeau took the opportunity to release a solo album,L'√âternit√© De L'Instant, while Damien Lef√®vre left to record the bass on the second album by Luke. In 2005, in the middle of his tour for his solo album, Romain Humeau announced the final departure from Eiffel of Damien Lefevre (who, as of now, is still bassist for Luke.) Tandoori Emiliano Turi, Estelle and Romain Humeau met during the summer of 2006, accompanied by Hugo Cechosz (bassist during the solo tour of Romain Humeau) to record the third album by Eiffel, Tandoori. Scarcely after the recording was finished, Emiliano Turi announced his departure to participate in Jeanne Cherhal's next tour. Christophe Gratien, a friend of Hugo, was recruited for the emergency to provide the drum part throughout the upcoming tour. The album release was preceded by that of a digital EP (released 20 November) which gave its name to the first single from the album, \\"Ma part d'ombre\\". Again, the emphasis is on lyrics, more and more committed, violent and incisive, calling for fundamental changes, in lifestyle, values and the political system. The album was recorded quickly, and the sound was plainer than in their previous productions, though still very rock. Tandoori included 16 tracks whose length did not exceed an average of three minutes, with the exception of the bravura piece \\"Bigger Than the Biggest\\". The group gave a warm-up mini-tour late 2006 before starting the official tour, which began after the album was in stores, on 15 January 2007. During the next six months, Eiffel appeared at some dates before having conflicts with their record label (Virgin Music, which was bought by EMI), concerning the promotion of the album. Eiffel had to honor a fourth studio album for EMI, but given the number of album sales (about 10,000 at the time), Philippe Ascoli (new boss of EMI France since April 2007) offered them a choice of either having him listen to new demos, or breaking their contract. The group chose the second option and ended their tour on 22 November 2007 with a concert in Le Bikini in Toulouse, after a memorable concert at the Olympia on 19 November, and then plunged into almost complete silence for the next eight months. √Ä tout moment On 12 November 2008, a song was announced on the Eiffel website as available to Internet users for free download. This song, \\"Le Temps des cerises\\", recorded in one night, was the result of a collaboration between Romain Humeau (drums), Estelle Humeau (bass), Serge Teyssot-Gay (guitar) and Bertrand Cantat (vocals), the last two from the group Noir D√©sir. Romain Humeau described the experience in these terms: \\"'Le Temps des cerises' comes first and foremost from a deep friendship. From a shared excitement for music as well. Instinct and urgency naturally flourished in the short space-time, hardly 24 hours long, in which we were transported and captured the piece ...live on the spot and without a net.\\" Bertrand Cantat was also found as a guest on the fourth studio album by Eiffel, where he provided backing vocals. Entitled √Ä tout moment, the album was released 5 October 2009, preceded by the single \\"√Ä tout moment la rue\\", released on the official site and broadcast on the radio. The recording was done without Christophe Hugo and Cechosz Gratian, who had left the group to concentrate on their blues/rock duo, the Twinsisters. Nicolas Courret, original drummer of the band, returned to his post, with Estelle Humeau as bassist. To complete the group for concerts, guitarist Nicolas Bonni√®re, former member of Dolly, was recruited. After a concert on 12 September at the Chant du Gros festival in Switzerland, the group launched itself on a tour, starting 29 October at Saint-√âtienne.

Matrix Metalloproteinase  Matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs) are zinc endopeptidases, commonly called metzincins. MMP enzymes represent an ancient family of proteins with major similarities in genetic make-up that are present in a range of diverse organisms from unicellular bacteria to multicellular vertebrates and invertebrates. The superfamily is distinguished due to its motif consisting of three histidines bonded to zinc at the catalytic site. The metzincins are divided into four smaller families: seralysins, astacins, adamalysins (ADAMs), and MMPs. The MMP family is formed by twenty related zinc-dependent enzymes. They are noted for having the ability to degrade extracellular matrix proteins, such as collagens, laminin, and proteoglycans. These calcium- and zinc-dependent proteases are activated at neutral pH and twenty-three have been found present in mammalian cells. Plant MMPs show structural similarity to MMPs found in mammals, such as the presence of an auto-regulatory cysteine switch domain and a zinc-binding catalytic domain.Cao, J. & Zucker, S. (n.d.). Introduction to the MMP and TIMP families (structures, substrates) and an overview of diseases where MMPs have been incriminated. Biology and chemistry of matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs). Retrieved from http://www.abcam.com/index.html?pageconfig=resource&rid;=11034 MMPs are synthesized primarily by connective tissues and have a large contribution to the initial events of tissue degradation. There are three major groups of the MMP family and each group has more than one distinct gene product that distinguishes them apart from one another on the immunological and biochemical criteria. Similar to that of induced fit by enzyme-substrate interactions, MMPs in the first group, called collagenases, have interstitial collagens. The second group, called gelatinases, degrade denatured collagens catalytically. The third group, called stromelysins, have the broadest proteolytic action and were originally confused as proteoglyconases. A less clearly described group of MMPs is the PUMP. Its RNA was taken from stromal cells in human breast carcinomas. Based on the PUMP sequence and functionality of carcinomas in the progression of malignancy, a new branch of the MMP family could have been discovered.Murphy, G., Murphy, G., & Reynolds, J. (1991). The origin of matrix metalloproteinases and their familial relationships. Federation of European Biochemical Societies, 289 (1), 4-7.  Extracellular Matrix  The most basic description of the plant extracellular matrix (ECM) is the cell wall, but it is actually the cell surface continuum that includes a variety of proteins with major roles in plant growth, development, and response. The ECM is composed of the primary and secondary cell walls, along with the intercellular gap between its neighboring cells. The ECM has a functional structure, along with aid in the regulation of turgor, which acts as a protective barrier and communicates with other cells using signaling pathways. In mammalian animals, extracellular matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs) modify the ECM to play significant roles in biological processes. The important role of MMP function in the extracellular matrix modification and subsequent mammalian development and signaling suggests that further study on the structure and function of these extracellular metalloproteinases may reveal new aspects of ECM modification in plant development.Flinn, B. (2008). Review: Plant extracellular matrix metalloproteinases. Functional Plant Biology, 35, 1183-1193.  Plant MMPs  All known MMPs have been studied in vertebrates; it is hypothesized that they are involved in remodeling connective tissue during development and healing. Current advances are being made in the field of Biochemistry, which will further analyze MMP-ECM interaction and their effects during plant development, stress induction, and xylem-phloem differences. SMEP1, soybean metalloendoproteinase 1, has been sequenced and characterized. It is noted that several unique divergences are in SMEP1 from that of the normal MMP family. For example, SMEP1 is said to have a free cysteine at position 94, a non-homologous insert from V103 to S121, a free sulfhydryl group, and the complete lack of the aspartate that is found in all of the other MMPs.McGeehan, G., Burkhart, W., Anderegg, R., Becherer, J. D., Gillikin, J. W., & Graham, J. S. (1992). Sequencing and Characterization of the Soybean Leaf Metalloproteinase. Plant Physiol., 99, 1179-1183.  Studies of plant MMPs  Protein inhibitors of proteases, are present in plants, animals, and microorganisms. They are ubiquitous in nature and have a small molecular mass ranging from four to twenty-five kilo-Daltons. Different types of protease inhibition are directed toward a single class of protease. There are few reports on natural inhibitors of metalloproteinases. The metalloproteinase inhibitors (MPIs) can prevent unwanted proteolysis by denaturing their target proteases through non-competitive inhibition at an allosteric site. Five novel Lupinus albus MPIs were found and constitute the first reported protein inhibitors of metalloproteinases in plants and the first reported plant peptide inhibitors against a matrixin proteinase.Carrilho, D., Duarte, I., Francisco, R., Ricardo, C., & Duque- Magalhaes, M. (2009). Discovery of Novel Plant Peptides as Strong Inhibitors of Metalloproteinases. Protein & Peptide Letters, 16, 543-551. MtMMPL1, a Medicago truncatula nodulin gene identified by transcriptomics, is said to represent a novel and specific marker for root and nodule infection by Sinorhizobium meliloti. The possible role in the nitrogen-fixing symbiosis of a nodulin gene was investigated. The immune response of the plant to the alterations in the exopolysaccharides (EPSs) and lipopolysaccharides (LPSs) of various rhizobia led to the formation of enlarged infection threads (ITs) with thickened cell walls, which is often associated with plant defense reactions, and to the production of ineffective nodules in their plant host. Even though its precise role is classified as unknown, MTMMPL1 is noted as the first member of this biologically important protein family with a clear function in plant-microbe symbiotic associations.Combier, J., Vernie, T., Billy, F., Yahyaoui, F., Mathis, R., & Gamas, P. (2007). The MtMMPL1 Early Nodulin is a novel member of the matrix metalloproteinase family with a role in Medicago truncatula infection by Sinorhizobium meliloti. Plan Physiology, 144, 703-716. At2-MMP from arabidopsis was found in leaves and roots of young arabidopsis and leaves, roots, and inflorescences of mature flowering plants showing strong increase of transcript abundance with aging. In the leaves, the MMP gene was expressed in the phloem, developing xylem elements, neighboring mesophyll cell layers, and epidermal cells. The flowers were noted as having the gene in pistils, ovules, and receptacles. It was concluded that the At2-MMP has a physiological role in mature aging tissue and the possibility of being involved in plant senescence.Golldack, D., Popova, O., & Dietz, K. (2002). Mutation of the Matrix Metalloproteinase At2-MMP Inhibits Growth and Causes Late Flowering and Early Senescence in Arabidopsis. The Journal of Biological Chemistry, 277 (7) 5541-5547. The fungus Chondrostereum purpureum, the causal agent of silver leaf, was grown in liquid culture and agar, which caused it to secrete extracellular proteinases into the medium. The fluid dialysed by the activation of metal ions, which confirmed the presence of metalloproteinases. The silverleaf disease is a basidiomycete pathogenic on a wide range of host plants. The most notable host plant species include pomaceous and stone fruit species which are substantial for New Zealand‚Äôs economy. Cations, such as copper, zinc, and cobalt, are all inhibitory for the control of extract and stimulatory for EDTA-dialysed extract, which could possibly make the processes native cofactors. The amount of proteinases could be variable to the duration of the infection‚Äôs presence. Activity was found throughout the infected zone and not just the wound site; therefore, fungal growth and proteinase activity have a direct relationship. Even though zinc- binding metalloproteinases have been found to aid processes such as protein turnover and embryogenesis, it is still unclear as to the role they play in plants. To try to better understand MMPs‚Äô role in plant tissue, the SMEP1 is cloned and analyzed using a polymerase chain reaction (PCR) and the rapid amplification of cDNA ends (RACE) reaction. It was found only to be present in mature leaves, which suggest that SEMP1 may play an important role in tissue modeling.. Graham, J. S., Xiong, J., & Gillikin, J. W. (1991).

It has been dated to 2220 BC with a time window of 80 years on either side. It comprises three houses, several fields surrounded by walls, and a cairn. A sign by the Scord of Brouster states that the climate of Shetland became wetter towards 1500 BC, and that peat forming near the fields eventually forced the farmers to permanently abandon the site.  Site  The Scord of Brouster has three oval-shaped houses. The first house is oriented so that its long axis is parallel to the northwest-southeast axis, and it is around long and wide. It has an entrance at its southeastern end and six recesses. The second house is around long and wide. It is more kidney-shaped than the first house, and it has only two recesses rather than six, of which one, long, may be a sleeping area. Like the second house, the third house is around long and wide.  Artefacts  In all, nearly ten thousand pieces of quartz were found at the Scord of Brouster. 5688 stone artefacts were found in house one, 3772 stone artefacts were found in house two, and only 227 stone artefacts were found in house three. Of the 227 items found in house three, 225 are merely quartz flakes and chips. These pieces were found in what appears to be three phases: prior to the construction of the buildings, during active use, and during abandonment.  House one  Before this house was built, most of the artefacts were scattered across the southern portion of the building's area. After the construction of the house, the centre of the building had far fewer quartz artefacts. Instead, the artefacts were concentrated in places inside the house beside the walls. In the final phase, most stone pieces were found by the walls of the house.  House two  Both prior to construction and during its use, the artefacts were mostly concentrated on the western side and near the central fireplace. The eastern side had very few artefacts, and a recess in the northeast corner had even fewer, which led the archaeologists to believe that it may have been a sleeping area. After abandonment, the artefacts were scattered relatively evenly across the entire area. The second house contained only about three- fourths the number of tool artefacts that the first house did. However, they had nearly identical percentages of types of tools found. For example, house one contained 91 scrapers compared to the 69 found in house two, but that corresponds to 75% of the artefacts found in house one and 77% of the artefacts found in house two.  House three  Relatively few artefacts were found in the third house, so there was no real way for the researchers to discover any concentrations of artefacts.

Lake Vermont covers the area of the Champlain Sea, prior to its opening to the North Atlantic.Lake Vermont, also called Glacial Lake Vermont, was a temporary lake created by the retreating glaciers during the close of the last ice age. The lake once included land in the Canadian province of Quebec and the American states Vermont and New York. It was a geographical predecessor of Lake Champlain. Once the glacier retreated far enough north, it drained into Glacial Lake Candona, the geologic predecessor of the St. Lawrence River. At one time, Lake Vermont may have reached nearly as far south as to what is now Albany, New York. The surface of the lake was about above present day Lake Champlain, and was up to deep. The lake contained muddy water, and the sediment of Lake Vermont contains silt/clay varves, with silt being deposited during summer and clay during the less-energetic flow of winter. The Laurentide Ice Sheet retreated north of what is now Burlington, Vermont, about 13,500 years ago, marking the beginning of Lake Vermont. The ice damming the water at the north end, at what is now Warwick, Quebec, failed catastrophically about 12,000 years ago. The lake dropped within hours or days.

Funding was not allocated for the program and the project was cancelled in 1967. Background The Department of Defense began the STRAT-X study on 1 November 1966 to evaluate a new ballistic missile proposal from the Air Force,Friedman 1994, p.202. which was designated the Advanced Intercontinental Ballistic Missile (AICBM). The project was intended to provide a successor to the LGM-30 Minuteman ICBM then in United States Air Force service.Parsch 2003 The program was officially launched in April 1966, and in June the project received the designation ZBGM-75, the \\"Z\\" prefix indicating a project in the planning stage.Parsch 2009 The specifications for the ZBGM-75 called for a large solid- fuel-powered missile,Tammen 1973, p.88. which would be fitted with between 10 and 20 multiple independently targetable reentry vehicles (MIRVs). The missiles would be based in silo launchers, which were specified to be hardened by a factor of 10 over the existing silos used by Minuteman missiles.Hartunian 2003 In addition, there was also a plan to develop a railroad-based deployment system for the AICBM. Improvements in accuracy over existing missiles, combined with penetration aids under development to enhance the effectiveness of each missile, were expected to make the AICBM capable of defeating existing and projected Soviet anti-ballistic missile systems.Auten 2008, pp.42‚Äì43. Cancellation Ultimately, the Navy won the STRAT-X competition with the design that would become the ballistic missile submarines. Nevertheless, the final report, issued in August 1967, recommended that the ZBGM-75 also be developed.Friedman 1994, p.204. Accordingly, the Joint Chiefs of Staff recommended to Secretary of Defense Robert McNamara that the ZBGM-75 be funded starting in Fiscal Year (FY) 1969, with a projected entry into service by 1973. This recommendation came after the Air Force had completed the preliminary studies on the missiles and the new, hardened silos. McNamara instead kept the missile in \\"advanced development\\", which stopped all work on the project. Only development of the new super-hardened silos was approved for funding; these would be used by the Minuteman missiles. As a result, the missile's development was cancelled. McNamara's rationale for cancelling the program was the destabilizing influence of the new missile, which could have rendered existing Soviet anti-ballistic missile defenses ineffective. McNamara saw relative parity between the two powers--the strategic basis for mutually assured destruction--as the best method to keep the Soviet Union in a position where it must negotiate with the United States.Auten 2008, p.43. After the cancellation of WS-120A, the Air Force made no further development of new ICBMs until 1972. In that year the M-X project was begun, which resulted in the development of the LGM-118 Peacekeeper. The Peacekeeper entered service in the mid-1980s and served until 2005;Edwards 2005 the Minuteman III is still in service, and has outlasted both of its planned replacements.

Jogging path in the park In the 1930s, the area became open to the public as a park and today, Viveros receives anywhere from 2,500 to 3,000 visitors each day, many of whom come to exercise, especially along its jogging paths. Another popular pastime is the feeding of the park‚Äôs very tame squirrels. Squirrel overpopulation is a serious problem at the park, provoked both by the feeding and by the fact that there are almost no predators. Only four wild falcons are known to live in the area. The squirrels cause damage to mature trees and more so to the young plants in the seed beds, as they scurry between them looking for a place to hide. To combat this problem, feeding is not permitted in the nursery areas but is still allowed in other areas of the park. While most of the park‚Äôs area is green space, 1.7 hectares are developed and used for a number of federal and local government offices. These include the offices of the Obras, Services y Desarrollo Urbano, Instituto Nacional de Investigaciones Forestales, Centro Cultural Ambiental, Secretar√≠a de Medio Ambiente y Recursos Naturales, Comisi√≥n Nacional Forestal, Urbano de la Delegaci√≥n Coyoac√°n, Servicio Nacional de Sanidad and Inocuidad y Calidad Agroalimentaria. The park contains a popular plant market, and hosts five exhibitions each year. The first is for azaleas in February, followed by the Rose Exhibition in May, dahlias in August, houseplants in October and nativity scenes in December. History Bust of Miguel Angel de Quevedo In the colonial period, this land was part of a very large ranch called Panzacola, whose main house can still be seen on Salvador Novo Street. The establishment of a large scale nursery was the work of Miguel Angel de Quevedo. Quevedo made his fortune building a number of public and privates works in Mexico City and Veracruz, but he also saw the environmental damage and the consequences that these projects caused. In Quevedo‚Äôs time, there were neither governmental nor private conservation agencies, nor were there laws regulating the use of forests. By the early 20th century massive deforestation was causing problems such as desertification, erosion, flooding from unimpeded runoff and more. Quevedo was the director of public works of Mexico City in the early 20th century and designed the roads extending Colonia Condesa and Colonia Roma, so that they would be wide and lined with trees, minimizing the loss of green space. He also traced out Avenida Insurgentes. In 1904, he founded the Junta Central de Bosques y Arbolados (Central Committee of Forests and Tree Areas), which was the first environmental protection institution in Mexico. This eventually gave rise to SEMARNAT. In 1921, he also founded the Sociedad Forestal Mexicana (Mexicana Forest Society), a civil association which survived intact until 1978, publishing a magazine called M√©xico Forestal for much of that time. However, Quevedo‚Äôs major environmental project was to create a system to produce and plant trees to reforest much of Mexico City‚Äôs damaged landscape. Quevedo‚Äôs plan was to produce enough trees to form a ten-km ring of forests around the city to restore the landscape, regulate surface water flow and provide other benefits. Seven years after its creation, the Viveros was the centerpiece of a system of nurseries which produced 2.5 million trees in the very early 20th century and allowed 140,000 trees to be planted from between July 1913 to February 1914 alone. Other facilities associated with Viveros were Bosque de Nativitas, Bosque de Arag√≥n and the now disappeared parks of Santa Fe and Balbuena. The first hectare of Viveros was donated by Quevedo in 1901. Originally the area had desert type plants but Quevedo planted it with trees, and began a nursery. Later, he acquired a portion of the San Pedro Mart√¨r Hacienda, called Potrero del Altillo, with a surface of 301,452m2 and it was annexed to the original land. Viveros gained official recognition of existence and function by the government of Venustiano Carranza in 1917. Other portions of the park were acquired by federal authorities such as lands which formerly belonged to Angela Ramirez, Refugio Zamora and Maria de Jes√πs de Mej√≠a, which totaled about another 3 km2. The final expanse bordered a ranch named Oxtopulco, which today is the Ciudad Universitaria. This participation is considered to be one of the first expressions of a government environmental policy in Mexico. The primary function of the area from its conception has been that of a tree nursery, to grow and acclimate seedlings to be planted in reforestation projects. It was the first of its kind in Mexico and the first large-scale tree nursery in Latin America. Quevedo also established here the Escuela Forestal (Forestry School) in 1934. This school became the Department of Forestry under the Secrtaria of Agriculture. The area was declared a national park in 1938, and opened to the public to allow it to see the nursery work and to allow recreational activities. path with instructional panels on ecology The importance of the park has grown, especially since the 1970s, when schools began to bring class outings here. In the 1980s, Viveros began to offer exhibitions in floriculture as well as various sporting activities, especially jogging with the installation of tracks. By 1995, the park was clocking about 1,000 visitors who were coming just to exercise. By the 2000s, the number of visitors had grown to between 2,500 and 3,000, which has led to some problems, mostly problems with rodents. The feeding of squirrels is a popular pastime in the park, which has led to overpopulation damaging plants. In 2005, city authorities estimated that there were also 10,000 rats in the park. The rats are attracted and sustained by food brought into the park by people, either for themselves or for the squirrels. Although the city does not consider them to be a health threat and the rats do not leave the park and invade neighboring homes, a program for their extermination was put into place because the concentration was considered to be the highest in the city. Extermination efforts mostly have consisted in the placing of environmentally friendly poisoned bait in areas where the rats congregate, repeating every two years. From 2007 to 2009, the government allowed a small alternative circus called ‚ÄúOtro‚Äù (Other) to operate on the grounds as a form of culture. The circus had been giving workshops in juggling and other arts in the park since 2000. One distinctive feature of the circus was that it combined traditional circus acts with theatrical performances. It practiced during the week and gave performances on weekends in the Parque Gorostiza section of the park. The circus was not allowed to charge admission but it could solicit donations after shows. It also offered workshops as well. It was forced to close by city and borough authorities who cited a number of reasons for the action. Today the park/nursery is managed by Secretariat of Environment and Natural Resources, and it along with a number of other environmental organizations have had offices in the park. In 2010, The Secretariat of Agriculture announced plans to build a six-story structure and 360-space parking facility in the park, to cover 2,450m2. However, due to strong opposition from the borough, as well as the descendants of Quevedo who stated they would sue for the land if the original donation stipulations were not honored, the proposal for construction was rescinded. In addition, in 2010, the offices of Obras, Services y Desarrollo Urbano (Works, Services and Urban Development) will be taken out of the Viveros, freeing 2,691m2 to be returned to green space. The offices will be vacated and the building demolished in 2011.

W. Clark & Co., a prominent financial firm based in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, that helped the U.S. government finance the Mexican‚ÄìAmerican War. In 1857, Clark was listed as one of Philadelphia's 25 millionaires. There is obviously some confusion by the source; Clark died in 1856. But the passage was directly about fellow financier Francis Drexel. Clark also launched the financial career of Jay Cooke, who helped finance the Union's war effort in the Civil War and establish a true national currency. Biography Clark was born in November 16, 1802, in Easthampton, Massachusetts, a descendant of Captain William Clark (1609‚Äì1690), who emigrated from England aboard the ship Mary and John and landed at Plymouth, Massachusetts, in 1630, and moved to the town of Easthampton in 1639. Enoch traced his descent from William as follows: John (1651-1704), John (1679-1768), Eliakim (1707-1781), Lt. Asahel (1737-1822), to his father, Bohan (1772-1846), a merchant and miller who married Mary White (1777-?) on February 11, 1802. Memorials of Elder John White, One of the First Settlers of Hartford, Conn., and of His Descendants, 1860Proceedings of the New England Historic Genealogical Society Enoch Clark got his start in finance by working as an office boy at S. & M. Allen & Company, a prominent Philadelphia bank. In 1823, he was made a partner of a new branch of the bank in Providence, Rhode Island. On February 1, 1826, Clark married Sarah Crawford Dodge (1806-1878), a daughter of Nehemiah Dodge. (After she died, her son Edward White Clark commissioned a stained-glass window in her memory in the First Unitarian Church of Philadelphia.Census of Stained Glass Windows in America Window: First Unitarian Church - Window L1) In 1832, Clark launched his own bank in Boston, Massachusetts; it failed four years later, whereupon he headed back to Philadelphia. In 1837, he created the E. W. Clark & Co. financial house with his two brothers, Luther Clapp Clark (July 4, 1815 - 1877) and Joseph Washington Clark (1810-1892); and brother-in-law, Edward Dodge. It was described as a \\"general banking, commission, and exchange business.\\" Clark's Philadelphia firm did well, earning enough to pay off his debts in seven years, then to propel the Clarks to a place among the city's wealthiest families. The firm opened branches in New York City, St. Louis, New Orleans, and Burlington, Iowa, and made considerable money performing domestic exchanges in the wake of the 1836 revocation of the charter of the Second Bank of the United States and the Panic of 1837. Moody's magazine, a monthly publication of the Moody's credit rating agency, later wrote: > During the first ten years of its development the firm gained wide > recognition and public confidence, owing to the indomitable energy of Enoch > W. Clark. The drafts of this house drawn between the various branches, were > regarded as the very best circulating medium in the West. There were more > than $2,000,000 worth of these drafts in circulation within a short time > after the establishment of the western branch offices and they were > considered everywhere as the equivalent of gold. Along the way, Clark hired a clerk who would one day shape the American financial system: 16-year-old Jay Cooke of Sandusky, Ohio. \\"Enoch W. Clark liked the boy's looks and he gave him a job. Cooke was assigned to the clerical department where his devotion to his work and his exceptional abilities in financial matters caused Mr. Clark to push him along,\\" a 1914 history of the firm recounted. At the outbreak of the Mexican‚ÄìAmerican War (1846‚Äì1848), the U.S. government borrowed about $50 million (about $ today) from the firm, then recognized as \\"the leading domestic exchange house\\" in the country. In 1849, Enoch's oldest son, Edward White Clark, became a member of the firm. That same year, Cooke was made a partner. (Cooke retired from the firm in 1854, and went on to help to sell the bonds that financed the U.S. Civil War and push the cash-strapped American government to form a true national currency.) Enoch Clark \\"withdrew from the really active management\\" of his firm in 1850. He died on August 4, 1856, of nicotine poisoning.

A talented soprano, she actively performed in musicals, operettas, and operas in the United States, both on stage and on television and radio, from the 1930s through the 1950s. She is best known for her portrayal of Nina Hagerup in the original Broadway production of Robert Wright and George Forrest's Song of Norway. She also appeared successfully in a few productions on London's West End.  Life and career  Helena Bliss was born as Helena Louise Lipp in St. Louis, Missouri on December 31, 1917. Her parents were Albert Lipp and Augusta Clemens. She was educated at Washington University in St. Louis. In 1947 she married actor and singer John Tyers who starred opposite her is several productions and performed with several notable opera companies; including the Metropolitan Opera. He died in 2007 after 60 years of marriage. The couple had two sons together: John and Michael Tyers. Bliss began her career in the late 1930s singing opera on radio and television. She made her stage debut in November 1939 in the role of Helen in a production of Very Warm for May at the Alvin Theatre. During the early 1940s she appeared in several musical and opera entertainments presented to American troops by the United Service Organizations. In July 1943 she performed the title role in Rudolf Friml's Rose-Marie with the St. Louis Municipal Opera. In 1943-1944 she performed in the final season of Sylvan Levin's Philadelphia Opera Company, where she sang Marguerite in Charles Gounod's Faust, Micaela in Georges Bizet's Carmen, Mimi in Giacomo Puccini's La boh√®me, and Rosalinde in Johann Strauss II's Die Fledermaus.Free Library of Philadelphia: Folder: Philadelphia Opera Company 1938-1944 After Levin's opera company folded, Bliss went to California to join the roster of artists at the Los Angeles Civic Light Opera (LACLO).

In August 1944 Bliss made her Broadway debut as Nina Hagerup at the Imperial Theatre to enthusiastic reviews. The show ran for more than 800 performances, and its cast recording was listed as one of Billboard's most popular releases of March 1945.

This resulted in unsanitary conditions and increased abuse at the hands of the prison guards. The protest borrowed tactics previously used by male Irish republican prisoners in Long Kesh Prison (informally known as the Maze Prison), that had started in 1978. Special Category Status Since a hunger strike of 40 IRA prisoners in 1972, prisoners convicted as members of the Irish Republican Army (IRA) had been given Special Category Status by the British government.Beresford, David. \\"Ten Men Dead: the Story of the 1981 Irish Hunger Strike\\". New York: Atlantic Monthly, 1997. This Special Category Status, which classified them as political prisoners rather than as members of the general population, entitled them to certain privileges. These benefits, including the right to wear one's own clothes, to be exempt from prison work, and to gather with other political prisoners for free discourse, allowed the IRA and other paramilitary groups to distinguish themselves from other prisoners and to maintain their command structure in prison. Beginning in 1976, however, the British government introduced its policy of \\"criminalization‚Äù, which aimed to portray the prisoners as criminals rather than political activists. As part of this policy the Special Category Status was rescinded for all prisoners convicted after 1 March 1976. This withdrawal of special treatment for IRA prisoners caused an uproar both inside and outside the prison system, who now found themselves forced to wear prison uniforms, engage in prison labour, restrict their visits both with fellow prisoners and with visitors from the outside, and deal with prison authorities individually rather than through their command structure. As a result, violence between prisoners and prison officials escalated, tensions within the prison rose, and a long string of protests aiming at a reinstatement of Special Category Status began. Blanket protests The first in a long line of Long Kesh prison protests, the blanket protest was begun on 14 September 1976 by a prisoner named Kieran Nugent. Nugent was the first political prisoner to be convicted after the removal of Special Category Status. Upon entrance to prison, he refused to wear the standard uniform and instead chose to wear his blanket as a garment and, at times, go naked.\\"A Chronology of the Conflict ‚Äì 1976\\". CAIN. Retrieved 12 November 2010. During this protest, members of the IRA and Irish National Liberation Army (INLA) followed suit, donning blankets rather than wearing prison uniform and thus protesting their treatment. This protest resulted in further punishment. The prison rules stated that prisoners had to be clothed in a uniform for all visits with family members and friends and that, if one wanted to leave his cell at any point in time, he was to be wearing his prisoner's outfit. As a result of their refusal to wear any issued prison clothing, those prisoners who protested \\"on the blanket\\" forfeited their four monthly visits with the outside world, were confined to their cells 24 hours a day, were forced to sleep in rooms with no furniture, and were fed insufficient food. Throughout this protest, tension between prisoners and wardens/guards continued to increase, resulting in the targeted assassinations of prison guards by members of the IRA. Long Kesh dirty protests As tensions grew within the prison between guards and prisoners, the number of attacks by guards increased, especially during the prisoners' daily trips to the lavatory or showers.Benjamin, Bret. \\"Dirty Politics and Dirty Protest: Resistance and the Trope of Sanitation in Northern Ireland.\\" Lit: Literature Interpretation Theory 10.1 (1999): 63‚Äì86. In March 1978, these attacks eventually led to prisoners refusing to leave their cells for fear of being brutally beaten, yet being refused basins to wash themselves in.Bishop, Patrick, and Eamonn Mallie. The Provisional IRA. London: Corgi, 1988 A few months later, a brutal attack on a fellow prisoner led to a mass revolt within Long Kesh, as prisoners destroyed their cells and furniture, refusing to leave after the damage was done. Unable to clear the cells, wardens left the prisoners trapped in the small rooms and, as a result, what had previously been only a blanket protest morphed into the first of the dirty protests. In the dirty protests, prisoners who were suddenly unable to empty their chamber pots began smearing their own excrement on the walls of their cells (to mitigate the build-up of vermin) and dumping their urine down cracks in the floor and out windows. Prison officials cleaned the cells sporadically after temporarily removing the protesting prisoners. After a few months, the numbers of prisoners involved in the dirty protest was between 250 and 300. After two years of protest, the prisoners decided to issue what they called the \\"Five Demands\\". These demands, were: # The right not to wear a prison uniform # The right not to do prison work # The right of free association with other prisoners, and to organise educational and recreational pursuits # The right to one visit, one letter and one parcel per week # Full restoration of remission lost through the protest. Armagh protest The only women's prison in Northern Ireland, Armagh Prison was built in the late eighteenth century and had served as a holding place for Irish republican prisoners.Loughran, Christina. \\"Armagh and Feminist Strategy: Campaigns around Republican Women Prisoners in Armagh Jail.\\" Feminist Review 23 (1986): 59‚Äì79. JSTOR. Web. 9 November 2010. In 1975, the population of Irish republican women prisoners reached a high of 120; but a population between 60 and 70 was more common, usually women under the age of 25. Unlike the male prisoners, female republicans were allowed to wear their own clothing and, as such, were never forced to go \\"on the blanket\\" in protest of prison uniforms. They did, however, hold their own \\"no work\\" protest, during which they refused to engage in any of the tasks which were set to them by wardens, in protest of the removal of Special Category Status and the corresponding loss of privileges similar to that of the men in Long Kesh. In addition, three female prisoners in Armagh participated in the Long Kesh hunger strike of 1980, which ended unsuccessfully. 7 February 1980 While the women of Armagh prison had been operating under a \\"no work\\" protest for quite a while to no avail, the events of 7 February 1980 served as a catalyst that would escalate their protest into a \\"dirty\\" one, mirroring the actions of their male counterparts in Long Kesh. After weeks of being served poor food, the women were told that their lunch would be chicken and apple pie. As they arrived to begin eating, the warden informed them that their cells were to be searched during their meal; this warning was largely ignored due to the unusually good food they were being served, and the searches went on unimpeded. During the meal, however, an increased number of guards, some rumoured to have been brought over from Long Kesh for extra reinforcement, entered the room, causing panic and an uprising among the women. This panic led to a prisoners' rebellion, during which the women were locked into two mass cells as their own cells were torn apart looking for clothing which could be identified as military-like uniforms. After the search was completed, the women were returned to their cells but were also informed that they were to be \\"Adjudicated\\" for their roles in the riot; they were subsequently beaten by guards in riot gear and confined to their cells for 24 hours, during which time they were denied access to the bathroom and given little food to eat. Over the course of their confinement, their chamber pots began to fill, forcing the women to dump the urine out of spy holes in their doors (these were subsequently nailed shut) and to throw the excrement out their windows (which were then boarded up). By 12 February 1980, it was official: Armagh Dirty Protest had begun.Coogan, Tim Pat. On the Blanket: the H Block Story. Dublin: Ward River, 1980. Prison Conditions Once underway, the dirty protest changed the conditions within the prison from bad to worse, adding filth and stench to the already nearly insurmountable obstacles to daily life within the walls of Armagh. In a letter smuggled out to family members, one protester described the conditions as follows: > Our walls are covered in excrement. There was nothing else to do with it. > You can‚Äôt pile it up in the corner ‚Äì that would be unbearable. This way it‚Äôs > not half as bad. It dries and the smell isn‚Äôt so bad after an hour or so. > The urine is the worst smell. You‚Äôll probably find that hard to believe. But > the stench of it just seems to cling to the air. It‚Äôs dark in the cell. This letter, and many others like it, raised public awareness about the day- to-day goings on inside Armagh as the 32 protesting women were subjected to increasingly poor food, little to no interaction with fellow prisoners, unpleasant temperatures, violence at the hands of their guards, and an accumulation of stress due to the worsening conditions of their surroundings.Aretxaga, Begona. \\"Dirty Protest: Symbolic Overdetermination and Gender in Northern Ireland Ethnic Violence.\\" Ethos 23.2 (1995): 123‚Äì48. JSTOR. Web. 11 November 2010. The defining condition for the women's dirty protest, however, had not to do with bathing or using the toilet, but with the menstrual cycle. While Ireland and the world was appalled at how the men at Long Kesh were living day in and day out, the presence of such an intimate and inherently sexual bodily fluid direct contrasted with the pure, model Irish women which Irish Republican activists were intended to illustrate. Indeed, even the mention of menstruation caused outrage in the guards and other men who came into contact with the issue, whether in person or in passing: > \\"I‚Äôve taken my period‚Äô she said simply. ‚ÄúI need some sanitary napkins and a > wash.‚Äù He looked at her with disgust. ‚ÄúHave you no shame? I‚Äôve been married > twenty years and my wife wouldn‚Äôt mention things like that.‚Äù What is the > color of shame? All she could see was red as it trickled down her legs.‚Äù When the public was made aware that the women were being forced to smear their blood on the walls along with their excrement and urine because of a lack of sanitary napkins being provided to them, most reacted in disgust and disbelief, pointing to this as further proof that women did not belong in prison because they were obviously, naturally more ‚Äúdelicate.‚Äù In addition, the presence of blood was believed to provide more opportunity for health risks and disease transmission than the other bodily waste. Pauline McLoughlin One of the notable figures of the dirty protest, Pauline McLoughlin, a 19-year-old from Derry. She was arrested and held on remand in Armagh before being sentenced in 1978 for being complicit in the murder of a British soldier.Weinstein, Laura. \\"The Significance of the Armagh Dirty Protest.\\" √âire-Ireland 41.3 (2006): 11‚Äì41. As an initial member of the protest, Pauline lived in the unsanitary conditions from the first days and, because of a previously existing stomach condition, became increasingly ill as time went on. After having lost all of her prison privileges as a member of the dirty protest, Pauline was suddenly unable to receive the packages of food which had kept her sustained and began to vomit continuously after every prison meal. Between the poor food and the conditions she found herself living in, Pauline's weight quickly dropped from 9.5 stone to around 6 stone. On 18 March, a prison doctor cautioned that, should she not be given medical attention immediately, she would most likely die and she was subsequently declared unfit for punishment and sent to the hospital to recover. After an incomplete recovery, Pauline was returned to Armagh where her condition worsened again, causing her to be sent back to the hospital; this was a pattern that would continue for multiple trips. Upon hearing of Pauline's condition, the public immediately began to protest the treatment of her poor health, which was blamed on her ‚Äúvoluntary‚Äù involvement in the dirty protest by prison officials and doctors. The activists group called the Women of Imperialism issued a pamphlet advocating for Pauline's return to health and an improvement of prison conditions by juxtaposing a picture of a healthy Pauline pre-arrest with the following description of her condition: > She landed in the hospital so dehydrated that eight bags of special fluid > had to be drip fed into her to stop her heart [from] collapsing. Yet one > week later Pauline was back in her cell in Armagh prison. Her condition was > still undiagnosed and untreated‚Ä¶ At the age of 23 her hair is grey, her > teeth rotting and falling out. She has dizzy spells and blackouts if she > tries to walk. Weighing just over 5 stone, she looks like the victim of a > famine‚Äîtoo thin even to sit in one position for any length of time.\\" Eventually, Pauline was convinced by her fellow dirty protesters to cease her role in the protest to save her dangerously failing health. According to secret government papers released thirty years later, > \\"There has been some talk, at least among the campaign organisers, of the > women in Armagh joining the hunger strike. In fact the [IRA] leadership have > never shown much interest in what the women are up to but have left them to > the feminist movement. However, they may consider it worth bringing in the > women at a later stage and it is also quite possible that the women will > take the decision themselves precipitately. the death of Pauline McLoughlin > (sic] or indeed her release, would give the women a new emphasis.\\" Public Opinion General Like all other prison protests, a large aspect of the women's dirty protest centred on their ability to raise public awareness of their situation and to recruit the public's support in their mission to change and improve prison conditions. In general, public support was behind the protesting women, most significantly by virtue of their position as women. At this time, Irish women were perceived by their fellow countrymen to be the bastions of virtue and goodness that was commonly recognised as \\"Mother Ireland\\" and, as a result of this, were generally thought to not belong in prison, despite their active nature in armed republican operations in increasing numbers since 1972. This disapproving attitude toward female imprisonment only grew when the public was made aware of the conditions that the women were living in, especially when it came to the presence of menstrual blood in the cells. The idealistic impression of Irish women required that their sexuality be pushed into the background of their identity, viewed only as pure beings rather than as humans with desires and urges. With the presence of such a sexualised object, however, the \\"little girls\\" were transformed into women, an idea that the public (especially the Irish public) was uncomfortable with and which they blamed upon the prison system and the conditions it kept the women in. Feminist Initially, feminists were divided on the issue of whether or not to support the protesting women of Armagh. While it couldn't be denied that these women were suffering incredibly at the hands of a mostly male police force, the fact that these women belonged to a very particular political group, one which was in strict opposition to beliefs held by a significant number of feminist activists in Ireland at that time, complicated the issue. The defining question of the feminist response was this: Was this protest being held as a republican protest act, or was it more accurately to be described as a female- driven reaction against the oppression of a certain group of women against their mistreatment at the hands of a patriarchal penal system and the male guards who surrounded them? It was generally accepted that while the women identified themselves as part of the larger Long Kesh dirty protest because they all claimed membership in the IRA and worked for the Irish Republican cause, they were instead a direct reaction to the sexist abuse suffered in prison. To this effect, many feminists found themselves supporting the Armagh women in their protest, especially convinced by a letter smuggled out from the prisoners on the issue of the feminist nature of the protest: > It is a feminist issue in so far as we are women, even though we are treated > like criminals. It is a feminist issue when the network of this jail is > completely geared to male domination. The governor, the assistant governor, > and the doctor are all males. We are subject to physical and mental abuse > from the male screws [prison guards] who patrol our wing daily, continually > peeping into our cells. If this is not a feminist issue, then we feel that > the word feminist needs to be redefined to suit these people who feel that > \\"feminist\\" applies to a certain section of women rather than encompassing > women everywhere, regardless of politically held views. Groups such as the Women Against Imperialism and the Belfast Women's Liberation Group united to support these women, defining their mistreatment as an essentially feminist issue, while other groups refused to endorse the women as a reaction against both the political nature of their crimes and as a refusal to endorse the ways in which they chose to protest their conditions Irish Republican The attitudes towards women within the Irish republican movement were only beginning their transformation from conservatism towards a more accepting, liberal gender-equal view when the Armagh dirty protest began in 1980. At the time of the protest the IRA, where few women were considered actual members of the rebel group, were faced with issues of gender equality, and the generally accepted belief of Irish society indicated that women should be relegated to their \\"fitting\\" role within the household, where they were to properly raise their children and support their husbands' efforts within the IRA. It was for these reasons that the IRA and its political wing Sinn F√©in initially acted to discourage a dirty protest among the Irish republican women. Once the protest began, however, the IRA and Sinn F√©in acted to support the women in any way possible, using their publications and media powers to propagandise for the women's rights, portraying women as a vital and large part of Irish republicanism and activist history, and encouraging the women to stay strong in their difficult protest. It is important to note, however, that the support given by the IRA and other Irish republicans was often portrayed in a sexist, male-centered way, from describing the protesting women as \\"very pretty\\" and \\"stylish\\" to depicting their actions as forced upon them, with the women as victims, rather than as an act of free will and rabid determinism. In addition, the constant referral to the protesters as \\"girls\\" rather than \\"women\\" diminished their portrayed power within both the protest and the movement; rather than being autonomous adults, they were being depicted as small children, not only asexual, but without a powerful will. Catholic Church At a time when the Catholic Church was viewed as a significant player in the Northern Ireland conflict, it became necessary that Church officials offer their opinions on the women and their unconventional activism. Like conventional Irish society, the Catholic Church viewed women as necessarily and naturally \\"weaker\\" than their male counterparts and, as a result of this weakness, unfit for life within prison walls. In addition, the Church advocated for the proper placement of women within the home where they were to care for their children and their husbands. Clearly, their detainment at Armagh removed these women from their homes, a travesty according to the Church, and one which, should the British government have any sense of humanity, could only be solved with the women's release from prison. While publicly supporting the efforts of these \\"helpless\\" women and speaking out against their living conditions, the Catholic Church issued several pamphlets which contained statements from priests who had personally visited with the women as well as statements from the protesting women themselves. In late February 1980, Father Denis Faul issued a pamphlet declaring the following: > To deliberately organise a large group of men to beat a group of helpless > women who are imprisoned and helpless is would appear to be an action of > peculiar heinousness. To do this on women who are imprisoned and helpless is > worse, to misrepresent the truth about it is worse still, and to punish > further the unfortunate women who have been beaten severely and indecently > is the worst of all. After the Protest Ending of the Protest The Armagh dirty protest came to an end in February 1981, a full year after the protest had begun. While a hunger strike had commenced and been called off prematurely in December 1980 (three Armagh women being actively involved in the strike) due to the believed fulfilment of the Long Kesh prisoners' \\"Five Demands,‚Äù it was soon realised that these demands has, in fact, not been met. As a result, a new hunger strike was planned for the beginning on March 1981. To help with the prioritisation of and directing attention to this protest, the women of Armagh called off their dirty protest. After the dirty protest ended, the women continued their no-work protest and were still denied the Special Category Status. Indeed, some conditions within the prison worsened, as the use of strip searching the prisoners became an increasingly frequent occurrence, especially when prisoners were travelling to or from the prison itself. This invasive technique, meant to prevent prisoners from smuggling illegal goods into the prison and correspondence out of it, also served as a demoralising tactic, robbing the women of their most intimate privacy and dignity at the hands of both male and female wardens.

Later it was changed to be the Chen Clan's Industry College, and then middle schools afterward. Now it houses the Guangdong Folk Art Museum. Located at Zhongshan 7th Road, the Chen Clan Ancestral Hall is a symmetric complex consist of 19 buildings with nine halls and six courtyards. Facing south, the complex forms around a north-south axis. A large collection of southern China art pieces, for example, wood carvings and pottery, can be found in the structure. The Chen Clan Ancestral Hall complex exemplifies traditional Chinese architecture and decoration style, and has influenced cultural and architectural developments worldwide. It was added in the list of \\"Cultural Relics of National Importance under the Protection of the State\\" in 1988. Name From its former purpose, the Chen Clan Ancestral Hall is also known as the Chen Clan Academy. From the Cantonese pronunciation of the name, its Chinese name was formerly romanized as ..  History  Chen Ruinan and Zhaonan, Cantonese returning from America, first proposed raising money from the various Chen lineages to build a temple for worship of their ancestors and an academy to train their clansmen for the imperial examination during the late Qing Dynasty. With money donated by Chens abroad and in 72 of Guangdong's counties, the hall was finished in 1894. When the imperial exam was abolished in 1905, the academy became a practical school for members of the clan. The Guangzhou municipal government approved the hall's status as a special preserve in 1957 and introduced a folk arts and crafts gallery in 1959. During the Cultural Revolution, the artwork of the hall was saved from destruction by \\"clever local officials\\" who installed a printshop for publishing works by Mao Zedong. The hall now serves as the Guangdong Folk Art Museum.  Structure  The Chen Clan Ancestral Hall is a traditional Chinese academic complex covering 13200 square meters. The complex consists of 19 buildings with nine halls and six courtyards which are connected by corridors and ride north to south in a symmetric pattern. On the main axis lie the Head-entrance (), the Gathering Hall () and the Back Hall (). These three main buildings are separated with courtyards. Tablet of the Chen Clan Ancestral Hall The Head-entrance is 27.56 meters wide and 14.91 meters deep with 17 columns, all decorated with flowers and figures. On the top of the gate of the Head-entrance hangs a tablet with words Èô≥Ê∞èÊõ∏Èô¢, meaning \\"Chen Clan Academy\\". On the sides of the gate sit stone mats and a pair of stone drums. River gods are painted in color on the gate. Inside the gate there are four double-side engraved screen. The main beams are decorated with birds, flowers, human figures plasters, bats and lions. The Gathering Hall was once a place for meeting and worship of the Chen clansmen and now it is used as an ancestral hall. It is 27.84 meters wide and 16.7 meters deep with 21 main beams and 6 carved stone columns. In front of the hall lies a stone gazebo surrounded by stone balustrades. Inside the hall sit twelve engraved folding screens. The pottery sculpture on the beams was renovated in 1981. Memorial tablets of ancestors were placed on a 21-step wooden shelves in the Back Hall, which was once used for worship of ancestors. In the rooms sit 7-meter-high wooden-carved niche covers. Buildings are separated with \\"Qingyun alleys\\" () and connected with corridors. The buildings in the Chen Clan Ancestral Hall are fully decorated with wood carving, stone carving, brick carving, pottery, plaster and iron engraving. The content of these decoration are mostly flowers, birds, Cantonese fruits and scenes in traditional dramas.  Art works  The Chen Clan Ancestral Hall is notable for the rich decoration which exist inside, outside the halls and in almost every beams, ridges, walls and columns. This make the Chen Clan Ancestral Hall a large collection of wood carving, stone carving, brick carving, pottery, plaster and iron engraving.  Pottery  Pottery flying cod on the ridge Pottery on the ridge One of the most distinguished features of the Chen Clan Ancestral Hall is the 11 pottery ridge crest, which was installed on the nine great halls of the academy. Each ridge crest has a theme taken from famous traditional dramas. Some are figures of characters in a play, some have series of more than ten scenes in a drama. With summering and exaggerating, the pottery ridge crests show the featured drama scene in comic series. The pottery ridge crest on the roof of the Gathering Hall has the largest scale and most delicate manufacture among all. This ridge crest spans 27 meters, 2.9 meters in height, 4.26 meters high with the plaster base and contains a total of 224 figures. The scenes in this ridge crest are \\"Celebrating the birth of gods\\", \\"Qilin giving people offspring\\", \\"The bearded man and Li Jing\\" and some others. Along with the figures are patterns of Yutang birds and peony, which represent wealth and glamour, and shapes of melons and fruits, which represent flourish of offspring. Moreover, the tip of the ridge crests are flying cods, which were believed to be a half-dragon half-fish creature. These flying cod figures have tentacles reaching out from the roof to the sky, which make the profile of the building more elegant.  Wood carving  Wood carvings on screen doors (close up) The Chen Clan Ancestral Hall has a large collection of wood carvings, which can be seen everywhere in the halls at the corners of the beams, walls, and doors. On the beams in the Head entrance sit eight pieces of exquisite wood carvings describing historical stories like Tongque Tai (), Celebrating the birth of the God Mother () and The alliance of Goujian, the king of Yue (). The most prominent wood carvings work in Chen Clan Academy is the sixteen double-sided wood carving screen doors in the back of the Gathering Hall, each describing a classic drama scene in old story books like the Romance of the Three Kingdoms and The biography of Yue Fei. These wood carvings have abundant high resolution figures as each facial expression can be clearly distinguished. Also, wood carvings work from Guangdong can be found in the folk art and craft gallery.  Plaster carvings The plaster carvings in the Chen Clan Ancestral Hall lie mostly on the bases of ridges and the roofs of corridors and have a total length of 1800 meter in the temple. The theme of the plaster sculptures are similar to those of pottery crests: scenes in traditional dramas, birds and flowers, pavilions, and landscapes. Plaster in old Cantonese houses were called \\"grass tails\\" since the pattern are often shaped like curling grass and placed on the end of walls. In wealthy families, larger scaled and more delicate plaster were used in the house decorating. Since plaster has to be made on site, artists can bring their talent to play according to the surrounding. The plaster carvings in the Chen Clan Ancestral Hall were example of exquisite plaster art: some were made as they go through the wall; some come out up to 60 centimeter from the wall, giving a three-dimensional effect.  Brick carving  Brick Carving \\"Liu Qing taming 'the Wolf'\\" Brick carvings in the Chen Clan Ancestral Hall lie on the inner walls of each great halls. The one on the east wall features the old story \\"Liu Qing taming 'the Wolf'\\", with more than 40 figures in the picture, describing the lively scene of the man Liu Qing taming the wild horse from the west named \\"the wolf\\" in the time of Northern Song. Each figure has a distinguished facial expression and pose.  Engraving  The iron engravings in the Chen Clan Ancestral Hall are mainly used on the platform railings.

Ortmayer was inspired to become an artist by her father, Rudolph Ortmayer, who worked as a lithographer. In 1926, Ortmayer began studying under Austrian born sculptor Franz Plunder. She graduated from the Royal Academy in Vienna, Austria and studied Master School of the Royal Academy. Upon returning to the United States in 1932, Ortmayer found difficulty gaining employment. With the assistance of her friend, a tutor of Treasury secretary Henry Morgenthau, Jr. Ortmayer became employed with the Section of Painting and Sculpture, coordinating design contests for federal buildings. In 1937, she ended her employment with the Section. Soon after, she was recruited as a sculpture instructor at Rollins College in Winter Park, Florida by the current president, Hamilton Holt. Ortmayer was awarded commissions to design and create two bas reliefs for post offices in Arcadia, Florida and Scottsboro, Alabama as a result of her entering a national design competition. The Arcadia relief, completed in 1939, is titled Arcadia. It features five people (two men, a woman and two children) with a cow and her calf. The second relief, completed in 1940, is titled Alabama Agriculture. It features three separate panels, each depicting different stages of crop harvest. In 1941, Ortmayer was promoted to assistant professor of sculpture in 1941. In 1945, she was further promoted to associate professor. She reached the status of professor of sculpture in 1947. During her career at Rollins, Ortmayer created a number of award‚Äìwinning medals. Ortmayer retired in 1968. She died on May 15, 1988. Early life and employment at the Section of Painting and Sculpture Constance Ortmayer was born July 19, 1902 in New York.Starck, Jeff (29 March 2010). \\"Cincinnati Music Center Coin Designer Has Varied Career\\". Coin World. p. 58. Her interest in art was inspired by her father, who worked as a lithographer. However, according to an article in the November 15, 1957 edition of the Rollins College Sandspur, Ortmayer became interested in sculpting due to her tutor. In 1926, Ortmayer began studying under Austrian‚Äìborn sculptor Franz Plunder. Ortmayer spent five years in Europe, graduating from the Royal Academy in Vienna. While in Europe, she also studied under Josef M√ºllner at the Master School of the Royal Academy. In 1932, Ortmayer returned to the United States. After returning, she found difficulty attaining steady employment. Upon discovering Ortmayer's predicament, her friend, tutor of Secretary of the Treasury Henry Morgenthau and his wife, recommended her for a position in the Section of Painting and Sculpture. Ortmayer secured employment in the Section coordinating design contests that were established to help young artists compete with more well known figures in securing government commissions. In 1937, Ortmayer resigned her position in order to teach at Rollins College because she was interested creating her own sculptures, something she couldn't do during her time at the Section due to time restrictions. Time at Rollins College and retirement In 1937, Ortmayer was hired as instructor of sculpture at Rollins College by the president of the college, Hamilton Holt. As she was no longer employed by the government, Ortmayer was once again free to submit designs for approval. Ortmayer proceeded to enter a national competition for artists, receiving a runner-up position. As such, she was commissioned to design two bas reliefs for federal post offices; one in Arcadia, Florida, which she completed in 1939, and one for Scottsboro, Alabama, completed in 1940. The relief created for the Arcadia post office depicts a group of three adults (two men, one woman) and two children (a boy and a girl), along with a cow and her calf. The relief is entitled Arcadia The second relief, created for the post office in Scottsboro, is a group of three different panels entitled Alabama Agriculture. The left panel depicts a man and a woman examining ears of corn. The middle and largest panel depicts cotton being harvested. The right panel depicts corn being harvested. In 1941, Ortmayer was promoted from her original position as instructor of sculpture to assistant professor of sculpture. She was once again promoted, this time to associate professor, in 1945. In 1947, she was promoted to professor of sculpture. During her time at Rollins, Ortmayer created a number of medals, most of which depicted then current and former members of the teaching staff at the college.Starck, Jeff (29 March 2010). \\"Cincinnati Music Center Coin Designer Has Varied Career\\".

Cincinnati Musical Center half dollar Cincinnati Music Center commemorative half dollar In the mid-1930s, Cincinnati businessman Thomas G. Melish formed a group calling itself the Cincinnati Musical Center Commemorative Coin Association in order to secure the minting of a half dollar commemorating the \\"50th anniversary of Cincinnati, Ohio as a center of music, and its contributions to the art of music for the past 50 years.\\"Starck, Jeff (29 March 2010). \\"Cincinnati Music Center Coin Designer Has Varied Career\\". Coin World. p. 56. The obverse of the coin was to depict Stephen Foster, and the reverse a design emblematic of the goddess of music. The coin was to be dated 1886‚Äì1936. Despite the facts that there was no music-related celebration occurring in Cincinnati during that year, that Stephen Foster's connection to Cincinnati was dubious (he had worked for his brother as a bookkeeper for three years in the 1840s), that the year of 1886 did not seem to hold any special relevance to Cincinnati music and that the Cincinnati Musical Center was unknown to any of the established Cincinnati musical groups of the time, the mintage of 15,000 coins was authorized by the act of March 31, 1936.Public‚ÄîNo. 485‚Äî74th Congress, S. 3699, An Act, US Mint, Approved, March 31, 1936Swiatek, p. 140 The coins were to be sold at $7.75 per three coin set consisting of one coin from each mint; Philadelphia, Denver and San Francisco.

He was one of the five American pilots to score victories that day. Brown was awarded a Silver Star for his actions, and was the first Texan decorated for valor in the war. By the war's end, he was a flying ace. Early life Brown was born in Amarillo, Texas, and entered the Army Air Corps in September 1940. He was commissioned at Kelly Field, Texas on August 15, 1941 and was immediately assigned to the 47th Pursuit Group at Wheeler Field, Hawaii. World War II Attack on Pearl Harbor Brown and another pilot, Johnny Dains, watched as the first wave of Japanese planes flew over. Quickly they decided to head for Haleiwa Field, assuming that the raiders had missed that auxiliary field. They took Brown's car and picked up Lt. Bob Rogers along the way, dodging a Japanese pilot intent on strafing the convertible. Dains was shot down and killed by friendly anti-aircraft fire later that day. Brown took off in a Curtiss P-36 fighter dressed in pajama tops, tuxedo trousers, house-shoes, flight helmet and goggles. (But for the goggles, his \\"uniform\\" can be seen today at the USAF Museum, at Wright-Patterson Field in Dayton, Ohio.) After he took off, he found that only one .30 caliber machine gun would function. Brown formed as the lead ship with 2nd Lt. Malcolm \\"Mike\\" Moore, from the 46th Pursuit Squadron from Wheeler Field. Together they flew north and engaged two Nakajima B5N2 \\"Kate\\" torpedo bombers from the Japanese aircraft carrier S≈çry≈´. Brown hit one of the planes piloted by PO1c Takeshi Atsumi. Brown later wrote that he saw a \\"big fire\\" in Atsumi's plane, but lost track of it and assumed it had escaped. Brown last saw it headed west off Kaena Point. The plane was found where it crashed, in the channel between Kauai and Niihau islands, in 2002. Brown managed to shoot down another Kate before the raid was over, though he was not officially credited with the second victory until March 1942. Combat over the Pacific In August 1942 he was assigned to the 9th Fighter Squadron, 49th Fighter Group based in Australia flying Curtiss P-40s. Brown scored his third victory, an Oscar, over Lae, New Guinea during the Battle of the Bismarck Sea on March 4, 1943. Brown, by then promoted to captain, was assigned as a flight leader with the 475th Fighter Group (\\"Satan's Angels\\") 431st Fighter Squadron, flying the Lockheed P-38. Brown scored the group's first three victories, downing three A6M Zeros over New Guinea on August 16, 1943, and his seventh victory, a Zeke, over Rabaul on October 24. Post-war Brown served as base commander of McGuire AFB, New Jersey prior to leaving the service in August 1948. Remaining in the Air Force Reserve, he earned undergraduate and master's degrees at the University of Denver and was subsequently promoted to lieutenant colonel. Brown served as personnel manager for the Bechtel Company in San Francisco for 10 years and commanded a Reserve air-sea rescue squadron at Lowry AFB, Colorado. Brown died on October 7, 1991 in Walnut Creek, California.

Retrieved 2010-12-7. It is characterized by balance- and friction-dependent moves on very small holds.\\" Climbing Glossary\\" Mountainzone. Retrieved 2010-12-7. It is often not leadable, or climbable from the ground up, unless it has pre-drilled bolts to protect the climb, making most slab climbs either top rope climbing or sport climbing. Special techniques such as smearing are necessary to climb slab. It is a type of face climbing and is distinctly different from crack climbing. Slab climbing is a relatively new area of climbing, having become more popular in the last 30 years, and some of the highest graded routes are currently being realized.  History  The first routes put up on new cliffs almost always follow cracks, due to the ease of placing protection, or pieces of equipment which arrest a fall, while on lead. Slab climbs rarely have cracks or other features that can be protected. Therefore, slab climbs are usually discovered well after the cracks are all climbed, since easier routes to the summit exist. Slab climbs can be dangerous to lead climb using traditional protection, or removable gear that fits into rock features, since the scarcity of natural features where protection can be placed results in long sections where the climber is exposed to long falls‚Äîover on some routes. As a result, it was not until the introduction of bolting routes that hard slab lines could be climbed. In 1927, Laurent Grivel designed the first rock drill and expansion bolt, which paved the way for protecting climbs such as slab.Middendorf, John. \\"The Mechanical Advantage\\" Retrieved 2010-12-7. The next advancement for slab climbing did not come until 1980 when Boreal marketed the first \\"sticky rubber\\" shoe, making friction climbing more feasible. Before this, most climbing was done in boots or thick-soled shoes, which prevents the climber from making the balance dependent moves required on slab walls. Slab climbing saw a dramatic increase in the number of new routes with the introduction of lightweight, electric drills in the 1980s, but slowed as criticism of permanent bolting grew, and electric drills became illegal in many National Parks and Wilderness Areas. A new generation of climbers has begun to revive slab climbing, putting up some of the hardest routes in the world.  Techniques  Slab climbing is one of the most technically demanding styles of climbing. Unlike overhanging or vertical routes, where strong muscles are very important, slab climbing demands intense concentration and precise foot placement. Smearing A central technique used on slab walls is smearing: placing a foot directly on smooth rock where no feature exists. Pressure is applied and the friction between the shoe and the rock allows the climber to move on the wall. Smearing performance depends on a climber's shoe and the type of rock. Sticky rubber shoes increase friction. Smooth rock, such as quartzite, is difficult to smear on, while sandstone or granite is much easier. The angle of the slab also plays a large part in the difficulty of the move. A 60 degree slab is easier to smear on than an 80 degree slab. A good smear also puts as much shoe in contact with the rock as possible. The foot should be kept flat, instead of using just the points of the toes to smear.Cox, Steven M. and Kris Fulsaas, ed., ed (2003-09). Mountaineering: The Freedom of the Hills (7 ed.). Seattle: The Mountaineers. . A climber smearing on the rock, near Moab, Utah. Body placement Climbers must keep their center of gravity directly above their feet in slab climbing. A climber that keeps their weight too close to the wall risks pushing their feet off the wall. This means a climber will often have their hips away from the rock, which is the opposite of traditional climbing technique.\\"Climbing Technique \\" Rockandice. Retrieved 2010-12-7. A climber‚Äôs hands are often used to assist in this positioning by pushing out against the wall. Movement Slab climbing requires smooth movement over the rock, instead of long, jerky moves. Short steps should be taken to maintain balance, and the arms should be kept in contact with the rock. Slab climbing almost never has dynamic moves.Cahall, Fitz. \\"Tech Tip - Technique - HEELS OF STEEL \\" Climbing. Retrieved 2010-12-7. Falls Falling is usually dangerous on slab because of poor protection and the nature of the rock. The climber will often slide or tumble down the rock, instead of dropping through the air. This can cause serious skin injuries. When falling, climbers try to stay upright and slide instead of tumbling.  Types of rock  Rough rock is excellent for slab climbing. Sandstone and granite are both excellent for slab climbing, because the rock provides much friction, making smearing easier. Limestone slab climbs are more difficult, due to the smoothness of the rock, and quartzite slab climbs are even rarer due to the polished nature of the rock.

The race benefits the San Francisco Food Bank by tasking racers to collect both food and financial donations. The race is an Alleycat-style race that features specific tasks and checkpoints along the route for racers to complete.  History  The Supermarket Street Sweep, or \\"SMSW\\", was organized in 2006 by an all-volunteer group of friends headed by Jenny Oh Hatfield. Inspired by the Cranksgiving Race in New York City - where she had lived for 13 years - Jenny spearheaded the effort to launch the Bay Area's version of a charity bicycle race that benefitted families in need. The name of the event is a comic reference to the former television game show, Supermarket Sweep. The SMSW has established itself with an annual presence in the city of San Francisco with racers coming from all parts of California to participate. It has made a positive impact on the city's public battle with hunger and homelessness. Additionally, the 2010 event introduced a fund raising program for those unable to participate in the actual race (see categories below). The SMSW is a San Francisco Food Bank-sanctioned event that is often mentioned in its press releases, upcoming events and used as an example of how local action can result in a positive impact on poverty.  Rules and categories  Each year, racers congregate at noon at the \\"Bow and Arrow\\", or the Cupid's Span sculpture located in Rincon Park along the Embarcadero. Racers are given \\"manifests\\" - a list of checkpoints - that they must visit in order to complete the race. The checkpoints are supermarkets located in the city and are kept secret until minutes before the start of the race. There are two types of categories in the Supermarket Street Sweep: Speed and Cargo. Speed Race With the Speed Race, competitors must visit 5 supermarkets that are listed on the manifest and bring back specific items that are required from each location. The top prizes in the Speed Race are awarded to the first individuals who return to the finish with all of the required items from every location in the shortest amount of time. Both road bikes and single-speed / fixed gears qualify for prizes. The top placings are 1st Male (Road Bike); 1st Female (Road Bike); 1st Male (Fixed Gear / SS); 1st Female (Fixed Gear / SS). In 2012, this format was amended and incorporated a points strategy to the race. Fixed-gear categories were also eliminated in 2011 and prizes are now based on gender and not bicycle type. Cargo Race The Cargo Race also requires racers with cargo-style bikes or bikes that can carry heavy loads to visit 5 supermarkets with a mandatory shopping list, but racers are encouraged to bring back as much additional food as possible for bonus points. The top prizes in the Cargo Race are awarded to the first man and woman who return with the most food. In 2006‚Äì2008, this was determined by the number of items brought back. Some food items were worth more bonus points. in 2009 and 2010, the winning totals were determined by overall weight. In 2009, there were additional categories for prizes based on the type of bike you rode and whether you pulled a trailer. No perishables or any food packaged in glass are allowed for either category. Racers must also bring back receipts for the items listed on the manifest as proof of purchase. Fundraising Category In 2010, a new Fundraising category was introduced through a partnership with Firstgiving.com, where individuals :could solicit financial donations that would directly go to the San Francisco Food Bank.  Results  The 1st annual SMSW, held in 2006, debuted with 80 racers bringing in 1,172 lbs of food. That year also had a \\"turkey ham\\" category, the only time perishable food was allowed to be brought in by racers. The finish and after party was located at the Gestalt Bar on 16th Street in the Mission District of San Francisco. In 2007, the 2nd annual SMSW had an increase in attendance, with 110 racers bringing in 1,595 lbs of food. The finish and after party was also located at the Gestalt Bar that year. 150 racers brought in a 5,266 lbs of food at the 3rd annual SMSW in 2008. The finish and after party was located at Rickshaw Bagworks, a local bag manufacturing company in the Dogpatch neighborhood of San Francisco. The 4th annual SMSW held in 2009 attracted 198 bicycle racers, who brought in of food. The winner of the cargo race, Jeremiah Ducate, single-handedly pedaled in of food.San Francisco Food Bank - \\"THOUSANDS RALLY TO MEET INCREASED NEED\\" The finish was moved to the San Francisco Food Bank, and the after-party was held at the Bryant Street location of the Sports Basement, a local sporting goods store.

Sponsors  Over the years, the SMSW race has attracted both high profile and local sponsors from both the Cycling and Non-Cycling World. These companies donate all the prizes for the race to act as incentives for the racers. Some of these sponsors include larger corporations like flickr, RVCA, The North Face, cycling companies such as Phil Wood, Thomson, White Industries and Cane Creek. Smaller local companies such as De La Paz Coffee, Rickshaw Bagworks and Sheila Moon clothing also donate prizes as well as local artists such as Mike Giant who donates limited edition artwork. In 2010, the sponsor list included over 50 supporters.

It was ported to the Wii U in 2012, where it was a system launch title in North America. Players control their respective tanks and must destroy opponents and giant mechanical monsters with a variety of weapons, such as machine guns and rocket launchers. Its gameplay has been compared to titles such as the Earth Defense Force series, through its usage of B-movie tropes and parodying. Designed by producer Makoto Ishii, Tank! Tank! Tank! is a spiritual successor to Tokyo Wars (1996), an older Namco arcade game that shared many of the same mechanics and ideas. Ishii wanted to create an arcade game that allowed players to express themselves through its fast-paced gameplay and visuals. He designed it around a vertical-oriented monitor, a concept borrowed from the popularity of Japanese mobile games. As these were often played with a vertical screen, Ishii believed it would automatically make players familiar with the gameplay of Tank! Tank! Tank!. The game underwent a reportedly troubled development cycle. The arcade version of Tank! Tank! Tank! was well-received, with critics applauding its exhilarating gameplay and wide array of weapons. By comparison, the Wii U version received largely negative reviews, being criticized for its lackluster gamemodes, shallow content, and difficult controls. Several believed that the Wii U port was evident that the game should have been exclusive to arcades. However, it was praised for its concept and graphical style, and was a moderate commercial success in Japan. Gameplay The player fighting a swarm of enemy bees in the Wii U version. The player controls a tank and shoots monsters with ammunition. A player's photo is taken with a nearby camera (dubbed the NamCam) and is used as an avatar to identify each player's tank. Each level contains destructible elements and weapons range from a plasma bolt to a machine gun. Accessories can be added to the avatars, such as military helmets and wrestling masks. Collateral damage against the city background is encouraged in addition to dealing damage to the monsters that inhabit the game. Players can either divide themselves into two rival teams, team up to fight the monsters in a cooperative manner, or fight against each other. Development and release Tank! Tank! Tank! was produced by Makoto Ishii, an employee of Namco Bandai Games. Ishii wanted to create an arcade game that allowed players to express themselves through its fast-paced gameplay and visuals. He designed the game around a vertical-oriented monitor, a concept he borrowed from cell phones. As mobile users were familiar with playing games with a vertical screen, Ishii believed that a vertical monitor would automatically make its players familiar with how the game is played. Ishii also felt that the vertical screen tapped into his goal of allowing players to \\"express\\" themselves, with its enemies and level geometry being designed to provide a sense of \\"overwhelming power\\" for its players. Publications believe that the Earth Defense Force series, published by Namco Bandai subsidiary D3 Publisher, also served as inspiration for the game. The soundtrack was composed by Hiroki Hashimoto, who went on to compose the music for Pac-Man & Galaga Dimensions (2011) and several tracks for Super Smash Bros. for 3DS (2014). Tank! Tank! Tank! is a spiritual successor to Tokyo Wars (1996), an older Namco arcade game that also involved tanks shooting enemies. It was programmed for the Namco System ES1, a Linux-powered arcade system board. According to Radio Nikkei, the game underwent a troubled development cycle. Namco Bandai Games demonstrated Tank! Tank! Tank! at the 2009 Japan Amusement Machine Show exposition in Tokyo, presented alongside the lightgun shooter Deadstorm Pirates. It was released in Japan in October 2009, and in North America and Europe later that year; all three releases were published under the original Namco label. In September 2012, a port of Tank! Tank! Tank! was announced for the Wii U as a launch title for the system in North America, which was released on November 18, 2012. It was later released in Europe on November 30 and in Japan on December 26. The Japanese version was originally released as a downloadable free-to-play game on the Nintendo eShop, where the player was able to play through the single-player campaign for free and could buy the other game modes as downloadable content. A physical retail version was later released on February 21, 2013. In Europe and North America, the game became free-to-play on February 14, 2013 and May 2, 2013 respectively. Reception The arcade version of Tank! Tank! Tank! was well-received. 1UP.com writer Justin Epperson enjoyed its general absurdity and its gameplay for being fun and full of frantic, fast-paced action. Staff from Radio Nikkei showed their enthusiasm towards the game's selection of powerful weapons and exhilarating action, writing that it would definitely keep players coming back for more. Game Watchs Toyotomi Kazutaka was particularily fond of the arcade cabinet and its vibrating seats, and liked the gameplay for its exhilerating feel and aresnal of weapons. The Wii U version sold 40,243 units in Japan, and is one of the top 50 best-selling games for the platform in the country. However, it received largely negative reviews, holding a 45/100 on review aggregator Metacritic. Critics focused primarily on the game's limited amount of gamemodes and content. GameSpots Britton Pelee described it as being \\"hours of boredom spent playing a game that was never intended to be stretched out for so long.\\" Both Casey Lynch of IGN and Kevin Knezevic of GamesRadar+ disliked the repetition of missions found in the story mode, with Knezevic claiming that the co-operative play only barely alleviated this. Patrick Barnett of Nintendo World Report disliked the story campaign in general for its lack of replay value and variety, as did Pelee. The controls were also a source of criticism; Barnett felt they made the game unnecessarily difficult because of the way they were designed. Most publications agreed that Tank! Tank! Tank! was a shallow port of an arcade game that was simply too low on content to justify a console release.

Construction of the Business Instructional Facility was completed in the summer of 2008 and the building was open for classes in August 2008.  Description  The Business Instructional Facility architecture can be described as \\"adding a sympathetic and fresh flavor to the campus's rich fabric of Georgian architecture while including sustainable features.\\"Projects: Sustainable Design: Business Instructional Facility, University of Illinois: Description, Pelli Clarke Pelli Architects , accessed November 26, 2010 According to worldarchitecturenews.com, the geometry of the Business Instructional Facility is defined by \\"three perimeter bar buildings\\" composed of native brick and natural stone forming a 'U'-shape. The opening of the 'U' faces south which encompasses the landscaped courtyard. The commons, located at the base of the 'U', is adorned with wood finishes and is flooded with natural light provided by the glass curtain wall facing the courtyard. The commons \\"provides grandness and warmth\\" to the Business Instructional Facility. Furthermore, Craig Copeland, a senior associate of Pelli Clarke Pelli Architects, characterized the daylight provided by the glass curtain wall as \\"a part of the architectural expression\\" of the Business Instructional Facility.\\" Rafael Pelli described the commons as \\"the central space, not only physically central, but it's central to the functioning and the use of the space.\\" C√©sar Pelli, a renowned Argentinian architect and partner of Pelli Clark Pelli Architects, described the Business Instructional Facility as \\"a family of its own character, its own quality.\\" Wolff Landscape Architects, Inc. described the garden courtyard as an entity defined on three sides by the building and thus creates a \\"continuous indoor/outdoor space\\" between the commons and the courtyard. The courtyard is arranged with linear pieces of pavement which elongates the building geometry. A raised trough serves as the base of the linear fountain that runs from one end of the courtyard to the other. A linear native prairie plant section and sedge meadow area, split by a path for surface drainage, provides stormwater retention and is adjacent to the fountain. The landscaping contributed to the LEED platinum rating through use of \\"native plants, on-site stormwater retention, green roofs, and no potable water use.\\" In 2009, the landscape architecture received recognition through the Illinois Chapter American Society of Landscape Architects Merit Award for their design of the garden courtyard at the Business Instructional Facility.Business Instructional Facility Landscape Architecture, Wolf Landscape Architects, Inc., accessed November 23, 2010.

The third floor is also home to the Illinois Makerlab, the world's first business school 3D printing lab. Also, the fourth floor, located on the east side of BIF, has many meeting spaces and faculty offices.  Green roof  According to Rob Kanter, the green roof on the Business Instructional Facility is composed of two different sections, a section located on the fourth floor roof and a smaller area over the auditorium. The green roof contains low maintenance plants growing in a layer of substrate that captures water allowing much less stormwater runoff. Rob Kanter adds that green roofs \\"discharge cleaner water, thanks to the filtering effect of the substrate and the ... runoff doesn't pick up additional pollutants from the roof itself.\\" Furthermore, the green roof provides better heat reflection in warm weather and insulation in cooler weather. Also, the Department of Civil Engineering at UIUC has placed monitoring equipment on both sections to study the water quality runoff and insulating capacity in comparison to conventional roofs.Green roof on new Business Instructional Facility an example of UI campus as living, learning laboratory for sustainability, Environmental Almanac, August 7, 2008, accessed November 24, 2010  Sustainable design elements  The LEED rating system criteria is divided into 5 categories: sustainable site, energy and atmosphere, water efficiency, materials and resources, and indoor environmental quality.LEED 2009 for New Construction and Major Renovations, October 2010, U.S. Green Building Council, accessed November 24, 2010 Rafael Pelli admitted that the \\"biggest challenge is designing a good green building is making the early commitment early on in the process and then incorporating suggestions from various members of the design team.\\"  Sustainable site  According to LEED design standards and \\"Green Building Facts\\", an erosion and sedimentation control plan was developed to limit pollution caused by stormwater runoff. Also, a stormwater management plan was instilled to prevent pollution and disruption of natural water flows. The site of the Business Instructional Facility, formerly a parking lot, was reused and improved limiting the development footprint of the project. Also, the Business Instructional Facility is located near public transportation, Champaign-Urbana Mass Transit District, mitigating land development due to automobiles.Green Building Facts, University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign College of Business, accessed November 24, 2010  Energy and atmosphere  According to LEED design standards and \\"Green Building Facts\\", the fundamental commissioning of building's energy systems verified that these items were installed and calibrated as established by the project. Automatic light dimmers were installed to detect natural light and adjust synthetic light sources accordingly to reduce energy consumption. Motion sensors power light fixtures off when rooms are empty to also limit energy use. Triple pane windows that comprise the glass curtain wall provide \\"phenomenal thermal and acoustical insulation\\" in addition to high performance insulation. The zinc roof reflects solar radiation away from the building reducing cooling costs. Zero employment of CFC-based refrigerants in heating, air conditioning, ventilating, and refrigeration systems reduces ozone depletion. The Business Instructional Facility receives approximately 8% of its electricity demand from of solar panels on the auditorium roof.  Water efficiency  Water use reduction was accomplished with low volume shower heads, toilets, and facets. Also, potable water consumption was eliminated through low maintenance and drought resistant landscaping.  Materials and resources  A construction waste management plan was implemented in order to reduce landfill waste from job site.  Indoor environmental quality  A displacement air system has been installed to efficiently transport warm and cool air throughout the building. This system provides \\"filtered, humidity controlled, low velocity air\\" to the entire building. Also, monitoring equipment ensures that the \\"ventilation systems maintain minimum design requirements\\", especially carbon dioxide levels, \\"help promote occupant comfort and well- being\\".

Protein phosphatase 1 (PP1) belongs to a certain class of phosphatases known as protein serine/threonine phosphatases. This type of phosphatase includes metal-dependent protein phosphatases (PPMs) and aspartate-based phosphatases. PP1 has been found to be important in the control of glycogen metabolism, muscle contraction, cell progression, neuronal activities, splicing of RNA, mitosis, cell division, apoptosis, protein synthesis, and regulation of membrane receptors and channels.  Structure  Each PP1 enzyme contains both a catalytic subunit and at least one regulatory subunit. The catalytic subunit consists of a 30-kD single-domain protein that can form complexes with other regulatory subunits. The catalytic subunit is highly conserved among all eukaryotes, thus suggesting a common catalytic mechanism. The catalytic subunit can form complexes with various regulatory subunits. These regulatory subunits play an important role in substrate specificity as well as compartmentalization. Some common regulatory subunits include GM (PPP1R3A) and GL (PPP1R3B), which are named after their locations of action within the body (Muscle and Liver respectively). While the yeast S. cerevisiae only encodes one catalytic subunit, mammals have four isozymes encoded by three genes, each attracting a different set of regulatory subunits. X-ray crystallographic structural data is available for PP1 catalytic subunit. The catalytic subunit of PP1 forms an Œ±/Œ≤ fold with a central Œ≤-sandwich arranged between two Œ±-helical domains. The interaction of the three Œ≤-sheets of the Œ≤-sandwich creates a channel for catalytic activity, as it is the site of coordination of metal ions. These metal ions have been identified as Mn and Fe and their coordination is provided by three histidines, two aspartic acids, and one asparagine. The PP1 mechanism involves the use of a di-metal ion and activating water.  Mechanism  The mechanism involves two metal ions binding and activating water, which initiates a nucleophilic attack on the phosphorus atom.  Regulation  Regulation of these different processes is performed by distinct PP1 holoenzymes that facilitate the complexation of the PP1 catalytic subunit to various regulatory subunits. Potential inhibitors include a variety of naturally occurring toxins including okadaic acid, a diarrhetic shellfish poison, strong tumor promoter, and microcystin. Microcystin is a liver toxin produced by blue-green algae and contains a cyclic heptapeptide structure that interacts with three distinct regions of the surface of the catalytic subunit of PP1. The structure of MCLR does not change when complexed with PP1, but the catalytic subunit of PP1 does in order to avoid steric effects of Tyr 276 of PP1 and Mdha side chain of MCLR.  Biological function  PP1 plays a crucial role in the regulation of blood- glucose levels in the liver and glycogen metabolism. PP1 is important to the reciprocal regulation of glycogen metabolism by ensuring the opposite regulation of glycogen breakdown and glycogen synthesis. Phosphorylase a serves as a glucose sensor in liver cells. When glucose levels are low, phosphorylase a in its active R state has PP1 bound tightly. This binding to phosphorylase a prevents any phosphatase activity of PP1 and maintains the glycogen phosphorylase in its active phosphorylated configuration. Therefore, there phosphorylase a will accelerate glycogen breakdown until adequate levels of glucose are achieved. When glucose concentrations get too high, phosphorylase a is converted to its inactive, T state. By shifting phosphorylase a to its T state, PP1 dissociates from the complex. This dissociation activates glycogen synthase and converts phosphorylase a to phosphorylase b. Phosphorylase b does not bind PP1 allowing PP1 to remain activated. When the muscles of the body signal for the need for glycogen degradation and increased glucose concentration, PP1 will be regulated accordingly. Protein kinase A can reduce the activity of PP1. The glycogen binding region, GM, becomes phosphorylated, which causes its dissociation from the catalytic PP1 unit. This separation of the catalytic PP1 unit, glycogen, and other substrates causes a significant decrease in dephosphorylation. Also, when other substrates become phosphorylated by protein kinase A, they can bind to the catalytic subunit of PP1 and directly inhibit it. In the end, phosphorylase is kept in its active form and glycogen synthase in its inactive form.  Disease relevance  In Alzheimer‚Äôs, hyperphosphorylation of the microtubule-associated protein inhibits the assembly of microtubules in neurons. Researchers at the New York State Institute for Basic Research in Developmental Disabilities showed that there is significantly lower type 1 phosphatase activity in both gray and white matters in Alzheimer disease brains. This suggests that dysfunctional phosphatases play a role in Alzheimer's disease. Regulation of HIV-1 transcription by Protein Phosphatase 1 (PP1). It has been recognized that protein phosphatase-1 (PP1) serves as an important regulator of HIV-1 transcription. Researchers at Howard University showed that Tat protein targets PP1 to the nucleus and the consequent interaction is important for HIV-1 transcription. The protein also contributes to ebolavirus pathogenesis by dephosphorylating the viral transcription activator VP30, allowing it to produce viral mRNAs. Inhibition of PP1 prevents VP30 dephosphorylation, thus preventing manufacture of viral mRNA, and thus viral protein. The viral L polymerase is, however, still capable of replicating viral genomes without VP30 dephosphorylation by PP1. The herpes simplex virus protein ICP34.5 also activates protein phosphatase 1, which overcomes the cellular stress response to viral infection; protein kinase R is activated by the virus' double-stranded RNA, and protein kinase R then phosphorylates a protein called eukaryotic initiation factor-2A (eIF-2A), which inactivates eIF-2A. EIF-2A is required for translation so by shutting down eIF-2A, the cell prevents the virus from hijacking its own protein-making machinery. Herpesviruses in turn evolved ICP34.5 to defeat the defense; ICP34.5 activates protein phosphatase-1A which dephosphorylates eIF-2A, allowing translation to occur again. ICP34.5 shares the C-terminal regulatory domain () with protein phosphatase 1 subunit 15A/B.  Subunits  Protein phosphatase 1 is a multimeric enzyme that may contain the following subunits: * catalytic subunit: PPP1CA, PPP1CB, PPP1CC * regulatory subunit 1: PPP1R1A, PPP1R1B, PPP1R1C * regulatory subunit 2: PPP1R2 * regulatory subunit 3: PPP1R3A, PPP1R3B, PPP1R3C, PPP1R3D, PPP1R3E, PPP1R3F, PPP1R3G * regulatory subunit 7: PPP1R7 * regulatory subunit 8: PPP1R8 * regulatory subunit 9: PPP1R9A, PPP1R9B * regulatory subunit 10: PPP1R10 * regulatory subunit 11: PPP1R11 * regulatory subunit 12: PPP1R12A, PPP1R12B, PPP1R12C * regulatory subunit 13: PPP1R13B * regulatory subunit 14: PPP1R14A, PPP1R14B, PPP1R14C, PPP1R14D * regulatory subunit 15: PPP1R15A, PPP1R15B * regulatory subunit 16: PPP1R16A, PPP1R16B As described earlier, a catalytic subunit is always paired with one or more regulatory subunits. The core sequence motif for binding to the catalytic subunit is \\"RVxF\\", but additional motifs allow for extra sites to be used. Some complexes with two regulatory subunits attached have been reported in 2002 and 2007.

The tree was first described as Sersalisia obovata by Robert Brown in his 1810 work Prodromus Florae Novae Hollandiae, before being moved to its current binomial name by Baehni in 1942. The specific epithet obovata refers to the reverse ovate shape of the leaf. There is discussion whether this plant should remain named as Planchonella obovata, with the Queensland herbarium supporting this. A genetic analysis of material found that material from Papua New Guinea was isolated and was a sister to a group comprising material from Australia and Indonesia. Indumentum was present on the leaf surface of the Australian and Indonesian samples, and absent in material from Papua New Guinea. Pouteria obovata grows as a bushy- crowned tree reaching a maximum height of . The leaves hairy when young, with upper surfaces becoming smooth and shiny. They are roughly oval- to spear- shaped and measure long, and wide. Appearing from August to October, the tiny greenish-white flowers grow in clusters. Flowering is followed by round red or blue berries in diameter. Each berry contains one to five seeds which are yellow when ripe. It can be grown in conditions with good drainage with sunny aspect, and can be propagated by seed. The wood is used for turning and cabinet-making.

Early life Richard, born April 1780, was the son of William Meares of Killinboy, County Westmeath, and Elizabeth Goldsmith; his family's background was Anglo-Irish, his father's businesses were concerned with wine. He attended the Royal Academy to pursue an early interest in art, but a career as an officer in the British Army began after the outbreak of war with France. Meares commissions began as ensign with the North Yorkshire militia in 1803, a promotion to the regular 7th Fusiliers followed soon after that; he eventually acquired the rank of cornet and sub-lieutenant in July 1810 with the 2nd Life Guards. His service included participating the Peninsula War, and a significant involvement in the Battle of Waterloo. He retired from his last position as a lieutenant while with the 8th Regiment of Foot in 1818, and occupied himself with art and horticulture. sources: J. E. Deacon, thesis and paper He left England aboard , a ship of colonists bound for the new colony in Western Australia, arriving with his family and servants in December 1829. Western Australia In 1829 Meares travelled to Western Australia to join the new colony on the Swan River, its later capital, initially in makeshift arrangements at Rockingham beach, then at The Rocks, Clarence, while awaiting the realisation of his ¬£500 investment with Thomas Peel. After seeking assistance from Sir George Arthur, 1st Baronet, he was offered a generous parcel at Van Diemen's Land, but moved instead to the upper reaches of the Swan in 1832. He was appointed to the position of police superintendent of Guildford, Western Australia on 22 August 1834, shortly after the government's formation of ex-servicemen into a mounted police force. Meare's name, and that of his son, Seymour, is recorded in the diary of George Fletcher Moore as part of the expedition engaged in the Pinjarra massacre in October of the same year.Moore, G. F., Diary of ten years eventful life of an early settler in Western Australia‚Ä¶ p. 239 His position as a law enforcement officer ended when the Mounted Corps was disbanded the following year, and he took the role of Justice of the Peace then Government Resident for the Murray district in 1837. After acquiring land in the Avon region, he became Resident Magistrate for the York district until he retired in 1859. The region was beset with disputes between local people and those of neighbouring districts while under his administration, his nature and correspondence being described as quirky or quarrelsome; the publicity generated by these was a source of concern to the establishment at Perth.

Meare's wife was Ellen, or Eleanor, n√©e Seymour, born at Newcastle upon Tyne, whom he had married in 1808; she died at the colony in 1854. Their eldest son was Seymour Meares, who later settled at Pinjarra; of the earlier incident there he reported seeing eighteen graves, the subject of ongoing discourse in Western Australian history. He died 9 January 1862, and is buried in the town's cemetery. Legacy Richard Goldsmith Meares last years were in the Avon River valley. His role as the government's Resident was extended to the collection of taxes and statistician, and the foundation of local governance and societies. Meares helped establish the York Fair, and served on other committees, his equestrian interests helped conceive the York Race Club and another for the importation of thoroughbreds. Having brought his interest in horticulture to gardens at Guildford, he also introduced vineyards and a novel barley crop to York. Brief notices are given on Meares' able draughtsmanship, his sketches, and other works. The well-appointed house at Guildford was named \\"Bower\\". A single artwork by Meares remains, a drawing of a mill at York, though records of others, since destroyed, include one of his residence at York.

It comprises a range of stepped travertine terrace formations that have been created over thousands of years as flowing water from two mineral hot springs cooled and deposited carbonate minerals on the mountainside. Etymology Badab is a Persian compound of BƒÅd \\"gas\\" + ƒÅb \\"water\\", translating to \\"gassed water\\", referring to the springs' waters being carbonated mineral waters. Soort is an old name for the Orost village and a Persian word meaning intensity. Geology Yellow travertine terraces, seen from above Badab Soort's springs are two distinct mineral springs with different natural characteristics, located at above sea level. The first spring contains very salty water that gathers in a small natural pool; its water is considered to have medicinal properties, especially as a cure for rheumatism and some types of skin diseases and skin conditions. The second spring has a sour taste and is predominately orange mainly due to the large iron oxide sediments at its outlet. Badab Soort's terraces are made of travertine, a sedimentary rock deposited by flowing water from the two distinct mineral springs; they were formed during Pleistocene and Pliocene geological periods. When the water, supersaturated with calcium carbonate and iron carbonate, reaches the surface, carbon dioxide degases from it, and mineral carbonates are deposited. The depositing continues until the carbon dioxide in the water balances the carbon dioxide in the air. Iron carbonate and calcium carbonate are deposited by the water as soft jellies, but they eventually harden into travertine. As a result, over the course of thousands of years the water from these two springs emanating from the mountain range have combined and resulted in a number of orange-, red- and yellow-colored pools shaped as a naturally formed staircase. The surrounding vegetation to the north consists of pine forests while to the east it mainly consists of short trees and shrubs; and rock quarries can be seen to the west of the site.

The list's release was met with strong criticism from the US and British governments, while media and other countries have reacted less strongly saying that the entries are not secret and easily identified. Overview According to the Department of Homeland Security (DHS), it \\"Developed and executed the Critical Foreign Dependencies Initiative (CFDI) which extends our protection strategy overseas to include important foreign infrastructure that if attacked or destroyed would critically impact the U.S. The prioritized National Critical Foreign Dependencies List (NCFDL) currently contains over 300 assets and systems in over 50 countries.\\" According to the 2009 National Infrastructure Protection Plan, the CFDI was launched by the federal government \\"working in close coordination and cooperation with the private sector\\" in 2007 \\"to identify assets and systems located outside the United States, which, if disrupted or destroyed, would critically affect public health and safety, the economy, or national security. The resulting strategic compendium guides engagement with foreign countries in the CIKR [critical infrastructure and key resources] protection mission area\\". Using an initial inventory of infrastructure located outside the United States created by the federal government, DHS and the Department of State (DOS) developed the CFDI, \\"a process designed to ensure that the resulting classified list of critical foreign dependencies is representative and leveraged in a coordinated and inclusive manner.\\" Development of the CFDI was planned in three phases, on an annual and ongoing basis. The first phase was identification, beginning with \\"the first-ever National Critical Foreign Dependencies List in FY2008\\". This was done by the DHS working with \\"other Federal partners\\", in a process that \\"includes input from public and private sector CIKR community partners.\\" Next comes prioritization, in which \\"DHS, in collaboration with other CIKR community partners and, in particular, DOS, prioritized the National Critical Foreign Dependencies List based on factors such as the overall criticality of the CIKR to the United States and the willingness and capability of foreign partners to engage in collaborative risk management activities.\\" The third \\"involves leveraging the prioritized list to guide current and future U.S. bilateral and multilateral incident and risk management activities with foreign partners. DHS and DOS established mechanisms to ensure coordinated engagement and collaboration by public entities, in partnership with the private sector.\\" Disclosure The \\"2008 Critical Foreign Dependencies Initiative (CFDI) list\\" was contained in a February 2009 diplomatic cable to the U.S. Secretary of State, Hillary Clinton, which was leaked, redacted and released in the United States diplomatic cables leak by WikiLeaks in 2010. The BBC described it as \\"one of the most sensitive\\" leaks as of 6 December 2010. In its redaction process, WikiLeaks removed only a minority of the details of names and locations, and left the rest uncensored; details of the exact location of the assets were not included in the list. The list did not include any military facilities, but rather facilities important for the global supply chain, global communications, and economically important goods and services. In the cable the State Department asked American diplomats to identify installations overseas \\"whose loss could critically impact the public health, economic security, and/or national and homeland security of the United States.\\" The order was under the direction of the Department for Homeland Security in co- ordination with the Department of State. In summary the list consists of Submarine communications cables, major port hubs, critical sea lanes, oil pipelines, mines, dams, and pharmaceutical facilities. A major emphasis on European pharmaceutical facilities was said by the BBC to suggest a fear of biological warfare or global pandemic. Responses to disclosure The cable had been classified secret and not for review by non-U.S. personnel,. The publication of the cable was followed by strong criticism from the US government and the British government, but a tepid response from news outlets and other foreign nations. WikiLeaks spokesman Kristinn Hrafnsson said with reference to the cable: \\"This further undermines claims made by the US Government that its embassy officials do not play an intelligence-gathering role. Part of the cable read: \\"Posts are not/not being asked to consult with host governments with respect to this request.\\" Hrafnsson later explained to The Times that the list itself \\"had been made available to 2.5 million people including military personnel and private contractors by the U.S. government\\". He went on to say: \\"in terms of security issues, while this cable details the strategic importance of assets across the world, it does not give any information as to their exact locations, security measures, vulnerabilities or any similar factors, though it does reveal the U.S. asked its diplomats to report back on these matters.\\" United States US State Department spokesman P.J. Crowley denounced the disclosure saying it \\"gives a group like al-Qaeda a targeting list.\\" Anthony Cordesman, a 'national security analyst for the Center for Strategic and International Studies', said: \\"this has given a global map ‚Äì a menu, if not a recipe book ‚Äì to every extremist group in the world. To me it would be amazing to see how WikiLeaks could rationalize this.\\" However, Alistair Millar, 'director of the Center on Global Counterterrorism Cooperation', said: \\"it's a little different...than with diplomatic cable leaks...in this case, this is largely information available to everyone if they really wanted to look.\\" Janet Napolitano, the Secretary of Homeland Security, said the list \\"could jeopardize our national security\\". Nations other than the United States A spokesman for British prime minister David Cameron said: \\"The leaks and their publication are damaging to national security in the United States, Britain and elsewhere. It is vital that governments are able to operate on the basis of confidentiality of information.\\" Vic Toews, the Public Safety Minister of Canada, seemed \\"unconcerned or unaware\\" of the release of the list. He said: \\"I don't follow gossip very much so I don't really know the impact of WikiLeaks, but I can assure you that the security agencies in Canada are following it very closely and to the extent that I need to be involved and address those issues, they will brief me on the issues.\\" Lin Yu-fang, a politician in Taiwan, stated, in regards to the revealing of the six undersea telecommunications cables in China, there are \\"actually no secrets concerning the cables\\", but he said there \\"could be certain thorny political or military issues involving Taiwan, the U.S. or Japan if more sensitive secrets were exposed\\". News outlets A CBS article elaborating on the release stated that \\"although much of the information contained [in the list] was already in the public domain, officials in Washington and London have been quick to condemn WikiLeaks for publishing it, calling the act evidence of the organization's willingness to potentially aid terror groups in its mission to reveal U.S. secrets.\\" The New York Times stated that the list \\"appears largely limited to sites that any would-be terrorist with Internet access and a bit of ingenuity might quickly have identified.\\" The Lancashire Evening Post pointed out in an article that the list \\"contains information on defence sites in Lancashire which is more than five years out of date.\\" The article specifically pointed out that the \\"Royal Ordnance (RO) site at Chorley...has been developed as Buckshaw Village for the past five years\\" and the \\"BAE facility in Plymouth, Devon...[was] sold as part of a deal three years ago.\\" Companies Mayne Pharma told the Herald-Sun that \\"its entry on a classified diplomatic cable is out-of-date and full of errors\\", since the drug listed on the cable as its resource, a snake anti-venom, hasn't been made by the company for \\"more than ten years\\". Roger Aston, the chief executive of Mayne Pharma, said: \\"I can only go on what I can see now in the media (about WikiLeaks) but judging from what I've seen about what they've said about Mayne Pharma and Faulding, a lot of it (the information) is old, out of date stuff that's not relevant.\\" Dean Veverka of Southern Cross concurred, saying, \\"(Roger Aston's comments) that the information in the WikiLeaks document was ten years out of date could be accurate. To only list Southern Cross as the only internet cable network here might have been relevant 10 years ago (when only coaxial cables were available), but Australia now has seven cables going out of country. Australia has a very resilient network nowadays.\\" Bill Gorman, sales director of David Brown Ltd., said: \\"We make gearboxes for our platinum and gold mines. We have supplied equipment via the US for other countries, but have only once exported directly to the States, for a copper mine seven years ago. I have no idea why we're on the list.\\" A BAE Systems spokeswoman said: \\"The information in the list was incorrect. The site in Plymouth was sold in 2007, and in Chorley, there are no longer any weapons manufacturing, although there is still an office there. The information about Preston was correct. The safety and security of our people and facilities is of highest priority.\\" List of critical foreign dependencies The 2008 CFDI list, as redacted by WikiLeaks, listed the following infrastructures: (English)  Sea ports  A number of sea ports were listed, including several Chinese ports (Shanghai Port, Guangzhou Port, Hong Kong Port, Ningbo Port, Tianjin Port) as well as one Taiwanese port (Kaohsiung Port) and several European ports (Port of Antwerp, Port of Hamburg, Rotterdam Port).

He wrote thousands of articles popularising science as well as several books. Life Early life Vijaygupta Maurya was born Vijayshankar Murarji Vasu in Porbandar (now in Gujarat, India) in 1909. He completed his high school education at Bhavsingh High School in Porbandar. He studied law in Bombay (now Mumbai) and returned Porbandar in 1933 to start his legal practice. Four years later, he was elevated to the position of a judge. Due to his passion for bird watching, he wrote articles on birds for ' magazine. In 1944, Indian independence activist Vasant Avsare came to Porbandar and asked Vijaygupta Maurya to fight his case. However, as Vijaygupta Maurya was already at the position of judge, he could not do so. This prompted Vijaygupta Maurya to resign from his position and took Avsare's case as a lawyer. This ended Vijaygupta Maurya's career as judge and he decided to stay in Mumbai.

Early life William Morton Grinnell was born in New York City on February 28, 1857, the son of William F. Grinnell and Mary (Morton) Grinnell (sister of Levi P. Morton). Another uncle, Daniel Oliver Morton (1815‚Äì59), served as the Mayor of Toledo, Ohio from 1849 to 1850. He was educated in Stuttgart and at Phillips Exeter Academy. He then studied at Harvard College, but left without taking a degree because of health problems, traveling to France, where his father had recently been appointed U.S. Consul at Saint-√âtienne. William Morton Grinnell worked for a while for the United States Consulate in Lyon. He then attended Columbia Law School. Career After he was admitted to the bar, Grinnell practiced law briefly in New York City. In 1881, he traveled to Paris, becoming Counsel of the U.S. Embassy there, a post he held until 1886. While in France, he received degrees of bachelier √®s lettres and bachelier en droit. He returned to the United States and resumed his practice of law there in 1886. In 1892, President of the United States Benjamin Harrison (whose vice president was Grinnell's uncle Levi P. Morton) appointed Grinnell Third Assistant Secretary of State, with Grinnell holding this office from February 15, 1892 until April 16, 1893. Grinnell then returned to New York City to practice law. In 1894, he joined the banking house of Morton, Bliss & Co. (run by his mother's family), and remained there following its incorporation into the Morton Trust. His work there was interrupted by the outbreak of the Spanish‚ÄìAmerican War in 1898, at which time he joined the United States Army with the rank of Major. He returned to banking after the war. In addition to his work, Grinnell was a director of the Illinois Central Railroad, the Gunly Mountain Coal Company, the Mount Morris Bank, the Rio Grande, Sierra Madre & Pacific Railway, and the Sea Beach Land Company. He also published several books on contemporaneous social and economic questions. Personal life On December 8, 1898, Grinnell married Elizabeth Lee Ernst (1871‚Äì1944), daughter of Oswald Herbert Ernst, the superintendent of the United States Military Academy. Together, they would have two children: * Elizabeth Lee Grinnell (1900‚Äì1993), who married Henry L. Abbott. She later married second to David Munroe. * George Morton Grinnell (1902‚Äì1953) Grinnell died of pneumonia in New York City on February 9, 1906.

NLRP proteins are part of the innate immunity and detect conserved pathogen characteristics such as peptidoglycan. It is thought that NLRP proteins sense inherent danger, and link this with microbial products, creating a response under the concept of the inflammasome including K+ efflux and caspase 1 activation. NLRP is also known to be associated with a number of hereditary diseases. Research suggests NLRP proteins may be involved in combating retroviruses in gametes. Currently there are at least 13 known human NALP genes named as NALP1 through NALP13.  Function  NLRP plays a key role in inflammation and fevers. It is a scaffolding protein and is crucial for aggregating other proteins that form the inflammasome. It activates caspase-1 and assists in the maturation of the proinflammatory cytokines IL-1Œ≤ and IL-18. As with other NOD-like receptors, NLRP functions to recognize danger signals. NALP3 for instance has been observed to play a significant role propagating immune response to aluminum in adjuvants.  Structure  NLRP protein structure has a N-terminal PYD domain followed by NACHT domain and several leucine-rich repeats (LRR). These PYD domains can interact with other PYD domains to allow for interaction between NRLP and other proteins also containing a PYD domain.  Expression  NLRP1 is highly expressed in neutrophils, monocytes, dendritic cells, B and T cells. NLRP was found in high density in T-cell region of the spleen, but not found in B cell regions. Both the brain and the testis expressed NLRP1 but not NLRP3. NLRP1 was found in the neurons of the brain.  NALP gene  In humans, NRLP genes are found on the following chromosomal localizations: 17p13, 19q13.42, 1q44, 19q13.43, 11p15.5, and 11p15.4. Most NRLP genes are found on chromosome 19 and 11, however, the most abundant NLRPs (NLRP1 and NLRP3) are found on 17p13 and 1q44. NLRP has been frequently observed to undergo gene duplication events.  Associated hereditary diseases  Mutations in the NLRP3 is responsible for a number of hereditary diseases: MWS (Muckle-Wells Syndrome), FCAS (Familial Cold Autoinflammatory Syndrome) and CINCA (Chronic Infantile Neurological Cutaneous Articular syndrome). All of which involve periodic fever, joint inflammation, rashes and amyloidosis. Mutations in NLRP genes that cause hereditary diseases is much more common than that of other PAMP receptors for unknown reasons. Experiments have suggested that Muckle-Wells syndrome is closely tied to IL-1 signaling, as when IL-1 receptor antagonists are introduced to patients, their inflammatory symptoms are no longer observed.  Role in plants  In plants, danger signal sensors have been identified to contain many NALPs and therefore it is proposed that NALPs can also serve as danger signal sensors.  Genes  Some NLRP genes code for a series of NACHT, LRR and PYD domains-containing proteins, including: * NLRP1, a human gene that encodes the NACHT, LRR and PYD domains-containing protein 1 * NLRP2, a human gene that encodes the NACHT, LRR and PYD domains-containing protein 2 * NLRP3, a human gene that encodes the NACHT, LRR and PYD domains-containing protein 3 * NLRP4, a human gene that encodes the NACHT, LRR and PYD domains-containing protein 4 * NLRP7, a human gene that encodes the NACHT, LRR and PYD domains-containing protein 7 * NLRP12, a human gene that encodes the NACHT, LRR and PYD domains-containing protein 12 Some NLRP genes encode a series of NOD-like receptor family pyrin domains, including: * NLRP5, a human gene that encodes the NOD-like receptor family pyrin domain containing 5 * NLRP6, a human gene that encodes the NOD- like receptor family pyrin domain containing 6 * NLRP8, a human gene that encodes the NOD-like receptor family pyrin domain containing 8 * NLRP9, a human gene that encodes the NOD-like receptor family pyrin domain containing 9 * NLRP10, a human gene that encodes the NOD-like receptor family pyrin domain containing 10 * NLRP11, a human gene that encodes the NOD-like receptor family pyrin domain containing 11 * NLRP13, a human gene that encodes the NOD-like receptor family pyrin domain containing 13 * NLRP14, a human gene that encodes the NOD-like receptor family pyrin domain containing 14  References  Category:Intracellular receptors Category:NOD-like receptors ","title":"NLRP"},{"id":"29963194","text":"Vivek Mishra (born 8 September 1986) is an Indian gymnast from Allahabad, Uttar Pradesh.

A variety of images appeared from the early to mid 1930s, and by the late 1930s negative images briefly dominated Westerns. But in 1950, the watershed movie Broken Arrow appeared that many credit as the first postwar Western to depict Native Americans sympathetically. Starting in the 1990s, Native American filmmakers have attempted to make independent films that work to represent the depth and complexity of indigenous peoples as people and provide a realistic account of their culture.

Singer, \\"Despite the fact that a diversity of indigenous peoples had a legal and historical significance in the formation of every new country founded in the Western Hemisphere, in the United States and Canada the term 'Indians' became a hegemonic designation implying that they were all the same in regards to culture, behavior, language, and social organization. Some critics viewed 'Indians' as savage and uncivilized in early films while others argued these movies showed a wide range of depictions of Native people from noble to sympathetic.Beverly R.

Early films featuring Native characters varied in their depictions. Some of these characters were often shown wearing leather clothing with feathers in their hair or with elaborate feather headdresses. Authors have argued that Native communities were often depicted as cruel societies that sought out constant warfare and vengeance against white characters. But while some individual Native characters appeared as drunkards,cruel, or unintelligent, others were friends or allies to white settlers. A few successful Indian/white marriages did occur in film during these early years. Other depictions were generalized stereotypes and used largely for aesthetic purposes and many tribes were represented. Feather headdresses were culturally and historically correct for approximately two dozen Plains tribes, and those of the American southwest were often wearing traditional clothing.

Revisionist Western The Revisionist Western, also known as a Modern Western or an Anti-Western, is a subgenre of Western films that began around the mid 1960s and early 1970s. This subgenre is characterized by a darker and more cynical tone that was generally not present in earlier Western films.  Revisionist Westerns featuring Native characters  *Two Rode Together (1961) *The Deadly Companions (1961) *Hombre (1967) *Tell Them Willie Boy is Here (1969) *Soldier Blue (1970) *Little Big Man (1970) *Chato‚Äôs Land (1972) *Buffalo Bill and the Indians (1976) *The Missouri Breaks (1976) *Dances With Wolves (1990) *Thunderheart (1992) *Dead Man (1995) *The Missing (2003) *The Only Good Indian (2009) *The Lone Ranger (2013) In the 1970s, Revisionist Westerns like Little Big Man and Soldier Blue often portrayed Native Americans as victims and white people as the frontier's aggressive intruders. While the studio comedy Little Big Man still centers on a white protagonist, Dustin Hoffman, the Native Americans are depicted sympathetically while members of the United States Cavalry are depicted as villains. The Cheyenne in the film are living harmoniously and peacefully at the start of the film, and it's the encroachment of the violent white men who are the harmful, disruptive influence on their culture and landscape. The film is also noted for including a Two-Spirit character as well as showing Lt. Colonel George Armstrong Custer as a lunatic ‚Äì a fool and a fop ‚Äì whom the white protagonist betrays for the sake of his adopted Indian family. The 1980s saw the emergence of an independent film with contemporary Native content such as Powwow Highway, a British road movie and buddy film where one protagonist, an angry young activist, namechecks the American Indian Movement while the other visits sacred sites to greet the dawn. Both are on their way to free a friend from jail.Ebert, Roger, \\"Powwow Highway\\" for the Chicago Sun-Times. 28 April 1989. Archived at Digital Chicago, Inc. George Harrison was the movie's executive producer. 1990's Dances with Wolves, while hailed by mainstream audiences and providing jobs for many Lakota actors, has also been cited as a return to the White savior narrative in film. In the film U.S. soldiers capture John Dunbar (Kevin Costner) and take him as a prisoner. Native Americans race onto the scene and kill all of the U.S. soldiers while none of the Native Americans appear to have been killed. Some of them receive injuries, but they are portrayed as strong and immune to the pain. However, Dunbar then becomes part of the tribe and leads the Sioux against their rivals, the Pawnee, and later helps them escape the same army he once served. The final credits of the film suggest that Sioux people are now extinct, which a few criticized.Dances with Wolves. Dir. Kevin Costner. Tig Productions. Orion Pictures, 1990. Film. Also in the 1990s, a few Native American filmmakers wrote, produced, and directed their own projects such as Chris Eyre's 1998 film, Smoke Signals, which has been selected for preservation in the National Film Registry for being \\"culturally, historically, or aesthetically significant\\". It is one of few films featuring Native American characters and directed by a Native filmmaker (along with Edwin Carewe's early movies) that received theatrical distribution. Smoke Signals was written, directed, and acted in by Native Americans. Like Powwow Highway, it is also a road movie and buddy film that examines friendship, fatherhood, and the roles of tradition versus modernity in Indian Country. The New World offers a largely fictionalized retelling of the relationship between John Smith and Pocahontas. John Smith arrives to the Americas with the Pilgrims and is immediately captured by a Native American tribe. The movie did offer several myths about Pocahontas, changing her into an adult so the film can be made into a love story. In reality, Pocahontas was a child of about ten she met John Smith, and most scholars agree that some of the events in the movie ever took place.The New World. Dir. Terrence Malick.

In 1104 (possibly in 1219 as well) Seljuk-Turks attacked the fortress and the nearby monastery of Vorotnavank northwest. Ivane Zakaryan liberated the structures from enemy hands and gave control of Vorotnavank and Vorotnaberd to Liparit Orbelian of the Orbelyan family. Repairs were made to the nearby monastery during this time to make it functionable once again. Other foreign invasions included the Mongol-Tatars (in 1236?) and later Timur Lenk in 1386 where his army lay siege to the fortress. An underground passageway connected to Vorotnavank and the Vorotan River was used during sieges by invading armies. In 1724 Davit Bek took control of Vorotnaberd from Melik Baghri. This incident led people living in the region to call the fortress by the name \\"Davit Bek's Castle\\".  Architecture  The fortress is in ruin.

He sought the party's leadership two years later, following the resignation of R√©al Caouette. Long received thirty- one votes out of 1,143 on the first ballot and withdrew from the contest before the second round. A Montreal Gazette article from this period described him as manufacturer based in Cambridge, Ontario.Mary Trueman, \\"Socreds to pick leader at weekend convention,\\" Globe and Mail, 5 November 1976, p. 3. He ran for Cambridge in the 1977 Ontario provincial election, appearing on the ballot as an independent candidate. He was presumably still aligned at this time with the federal Social Credit Party, which did not have a provincial affiliate in Ontario. (The official provincial wing of the party had previously been taken over by a group of neo-Nazis, to which Long had no connection.) Long joined the Liberal Party of Canada in the 1980s and ran for delegate status at the party's 1984 leadership convention. The Cambridge branch of the party subsequently expelled him, saying that he had tried to recruit new members to support a \\"fusion\\" candidate who would be supported by both the Liberals and the New Democratic Party. (This initiative was undertaken without support from either party.)Ross Howard, \\"Liberal group ordered to reinstate member,\\" Globe and Mail, 27 June 1984, M3. Long later sought the Progressive Conservative nomination in Cambridge for the 1988 federal election.\\"Tory contender,\\" Globe and Mail, 1 April 1993, A5. Long also ran mayor of Cambridge in 1985.Gary Webb-Proctor, \\"Fancy footwork from Waterloo candidates,\\" Globe and Mail, 11 November 1985, A18. 1990s campaigns Long campaigned for the leadership of the Progressive Conservative Party of Canada in 1993, following the resignation of Brian Mulroney. He promoted monetary reform, called for an end to official bilingualism in Canada, and said that he wanted to succeed John Crow as governor of the Bank of Canada.Andre Picard, \\"Scrap bilingualism, Tories told,\\" Globe and Mail, 22 April 1993, A1; Edison Stewart, \\"Catholic bishops, Campbell agree on 'demon' truce,\\" Toronto Star, 22 May 1993, A10. Considered a fringe candidate, he nonetheless appeared at a public debate in Montreal with Kim Campbell, Jean Charest, and other contenders.Graham Fraser, \\"Charest reigns in French debate,\\" Globe and Mail, 22 April 1993, A4. He received no delegate support and withdrew from the contest before the party's convention.Kevin Crowley, \\"8 of 9 Guelph candidates make for busy meeting,\\" Kitchener-Waterloo Record, 25 September 1993, A4. He later sought the Progressive Conservative nomination in Waterloo for the 1993 federal election but received only two votes.Barry Ries, \\"Tories in Waterloo pick Woolstencroft,\\" Kitchener-Waterloo Record, 18 August 1993, B1. Long then ran for Guelph‚ÄîWellington in the 1993 election as a candidate of the Canada Party, an ideological successor to Social Credit. He was sixty years old at the time and lived in Guelph.Kevin Crowley, \\"12 running in Guelph-Wellington,\\" Kitchener-Waterloo Record, 1 October 1993, B1. He wanted to seek the Reform Party nomination for a 1995 by-election in Brome‚ÄîMissisquoi, Quebec but his candidacy was rejected by the party.Peter O'Neil, \\"Reform party chooses its first Quebec candidate,\\" Toronto Star, 8 January 1995, A7. He instead ran as a candidate of John Turmel's Abolitionist Party (another ideological successor to Social Credit) and finished a distant last in a field of ten candidates. He later ran as an independent candidate in Cambridge in the 1997 federal election. Long supported the Progressive Conservative Party of Ontario in the 1995 provincial election.Paula Schuck, \\"Hundreds come out to meet top Tory,\\" Kitchener Record, 5 June 1995, A1. This article indicates that he had previously supported the New Democratic Party of Ontario. See Christian Aagaard, \\"Cambridge riding one to watch,\\" Kitchener Record, 6 May 1997, A4. He later criticized party leader Mike Harris and described the party's \\"Common Sense Revolution\\" as having been a \\"big bank revolution.\\"Eric Volmers, \\"Colourful character hopes to lead Canadian Alliance,\\" Cambridge Reporter, 20 April 2000, A1. Long was the first declared candidate in the Progressive Conservative Party of Canada's 1998 leadership election. He supported a merger of the Progressive Conservative and Reform parties, favoured bank mergers, and said that the Bank of Canada should set up reserve banks that would leave one hundred per cent of their deposit liabilities with the central bank.\\"Former Cambridge man seeks Tory leadership,\\" Kitchener Record, 5 May 1998, A4. He also opposed the Canada-United States Free Trade Agreement and sought to peg the Canadian dollar at sixty-eight cents relative to the American dollar.\\"Long shot,\\" Ottawa Citizen, 6 July 1998, A9. During this contest, Long described himself as a \\"product developer, mechanical engineer, environmentalist and homespun economist.\\"\\"Tory contender emerges,\\" Globe and Mail, 5 May 1998, A7. He withdrew from the campaign in July 1998, before voting took place.Sean Durkan, \\"Baldasaro still wants to lead Tories,\\" 23 September 1998, E12. Long later sought the leadership of the Canadian Alliance in 2000, describing himself as a populist and calling for more plebiscites on controversial issues. Describing right wing and left wing labels as pass√©, he referred to himself as \\"an ultra-right-wing libertarian with a great, big, bushy socialist tail.\\"Eric Volmers, \\"Colourful character hopes to lead Canadian Alliance,\\" Cambridge Reporter, 20 April 2000, A1. He once again withdrew from the contest before voting took place. He sought the Progressive Conservative nomination in Bruce‚ÄîGrey‚ÄîOwen Sound for the 2000 federal election, but was not given a response by the party.Jim Algie, \\"Wilford running for local Tories,\\" Owen Sound Sun Times, 31 October 2000, A1. Long reserved the rights to the name, \\"The Common Sense People's Party of Ontario,\\" with Elections Ontario in 2002, but he did not seek election under the party name.Stacey Ash, \\"Waiting: Does ballot beckon?\\", Kitchener-Waterloo Record, 30 August 2003, A1. He does not appear to have been active in politics since this time. IMICO and Kanmet controversies In 1992, Long purchased an abandoned IMICO foundry in Guelph for one dollar. The foundry's previous owners had fled the country, leaving behind a company that was over one million dollars in debt. One year after buying the property, Long was informed by the Ontario Ministry of Environment and Energy that he would be required to clean up toxic wastes at the site. The cost was estimated at half a million dollars. Long described the charge as politically motivated, said that the site was not producing new contaminants, and refused to pay.\\"Owner of derelict foundry says cleanup order unfair,\\" Kitchener-Waterloo Record, 28 December 1993, B1. On December 31, 1993, Long transferred ownership of the site to the Assembly of the Church of the Universe, a religious sect based in Hamilton devoted to nudism and sacramental marijuana use. He argued that he was no longer responsible for the property after the transfer, although the ministry disagreed.John Roe, \\"Church given bankrupt foundry : Environment ministry demands cleanup of controversial site,\\" Kitchener-Waterloo Record, 5 January 1994, B4. In 1997, he was fined ten thousand dollars for an environmental offense.\\"Independent candidate faces jail,\\" Kitchener Record, 28 May 1997, B2. Long also purchased an abandoned Kanmet Castings foundry in Cambridge for one dollar during the same period. In January 1996, he was sentenced to three months in jail and fined seventy-two thousand dollars for the improper storage of PCBs on the site.\\"Ex-candidate in jail for PCBs violation,\\" Kitchener Record, 12 June 1997, B2; Bob Burtt, \\"Church founders say city consultants messed up property,\\" Kitchener Record, 20 April 1998, B2. Some newspaper articles confuse the Guelph and Cambridge cases This controversy took place during the 1997 election. The Assembly of the Church of the Universe moved its headquarters from the IMICO foundry in Guelph to the Kanmet foundry in Cambridge in 1998, with Long's permission.Tony Reinhart, \\"Pot-smoking 'priests' move to empty Cambridge foundry,\\" Kitchener Record, 22 January 1998, B3; \\"Church members can stay, foundry/home owner says,\\" Kitchener Record, 28 January 1998, B2. The city of Cambridge later tried to evict the church from the foundry, without success. In late 1998, the city reluctantly purchased the foundry from Long for fifty-eight thousand dollars and forgave him nine hundred thousand dollars in back taxes and hydro expenses.Curtis Gloade, \\"Tucker-ed out Cambridge taxpayers give Long a golden handshake and Tucker the boot,\\" Kitchener Record, 9 October 1998, A19. The church was forced to leave the Cambridge area shortly thereafter. Long has also served time in prison for infractions of Ontario's Highway Traffic Act and for refusing to pay a fine for improper labour practices, and he has been fined for evading payment of the retail sales tax.Kevin Crowley, \\"Long takes shot at Tory leadership,\\" Kitchener-Waterloo Record, 20 March 1993, B4; Agnes Bongers, \\"Winter in the Church of the Universe,\\" Hamilton Spectator, 16 November 1994, B1; Philip Jalsevac, \\"Eccentric entrepreneur John Long fined for not filing tax returns,\\" Kitchener Record, 3 March 1999, B3.

History The club was officially founded on 1 May 1946 by members of the Yugoslav Communist Party and was named \\"Boda Radonjiƒá\\" in memory of the Partisan fighter in the World War II that was killed in the Battle of Srem. But in 1955, because of the new football regulations, the club had to change its name, and after having been named shortly simply as \\"FK Boda\\" a new name had to be chosen. Since the club members were all supporters of the two major Serbian clubs, Belgrade's Red Star and FK Partizan, the decision was made to go to a poll, and the majority of the votes went to Partizan, and since then the club has been competing under the name that still carries today. The club has experiences difficulties in many periods, but it survived thanks to a number of influential people from the region that supported the club. The main company that helped financially the club was the local Agroprodukt, but the municipality of Kniƒá, to which Bumbarevo Brdo belongs, has also helped with the competing expenses during the seasons of the 2000s.

Its primary activity is interactive, engineering based workshops for girls aged between 8-18 (depending on location). Robogals has chapters at 31 universities across Australia, Canada, the United Kingdom, the United States, Japan, Kenya, South Africa, New Zealand, and the Philippines. These chapters fall into three regions - Robogals Asia Pacific, Robogals EMEA (Europe, Middle East, & Africa), and Robogals North America.http://www.robogals.org/our- network/chapter-locations Robogals also run a range of other activities around this central theme. Past events have included a robotics competition (2008), a mass robot dance that attracted significant media coverage (2009), a robot artwork exhibition, science fair (2010), the Robogals Science Challenge (2012-) and the Robogals Challenge in the UK (2015-). The organisation is predominately run by university student volunteers, including at the global headquarters in Melbourne, Australia with the Leadership Team of Robogals based around the world. Robogals is funded through the support and partnerships with key engineering related companies around the world such as: Beck Engineering, Telstra, Modern Teaching Aids, Worley Parsons, ACA, Department of Defence (Australia) and Abigroup. Robogals' achievements have been recognised on an international level with the awarding of an Anita Borg Change Agent Award by the Anita Borg Institute for Women and Technology. Robogals founder Marita Cheng was named the 2012 Young Australian of the Year. History Robogals was founded as a student club at the University of Melbourne in July 2008 by mechatronics engineering undergraduate student Marita Cheng, together with software engineering student Mark Parncutt and three other engineering and science students, Kelly Chiu, Ann Chee Lim and Vi Vu. The idea initially came from efforts by one of Cheng's professors, Jamie Evans, to teach robotics at Lauriston Girls' School as a way to encourage more girls to study engineering. Following its initial successes in Melbourne, the organisation was expanded throughout Australia in 2009 by inviting female engineering students from four more universities around Australia to a three- day \\"Bootcamp\\" at the University of Melbourne where they learned how to run a Robogals chapter back at their home university. It is also helpful if the students have support from their faculty for establishing a Robogals chapter on their campus. This process has been repeated several times since then Robogals has expanded to 31 universities worldwide as of 2015. Activities Engineering workshops Robogals' primary activity is running engineering based workshops, either in schools or by having the schools visit the uni; the workshops are aim to inspire gender diversity in engineering by engaging girls and guys in a range engineering topics. These topics are selected by the volunteers running the sessions to reflect their own interest in the field. Robogals volunteers are university students, including male and female, who teach school girls the basics of engineering; an example of this is through the use of robotics and programming using LEGO Mindstorms EV3 and NXT kits. Lessons can range between 1 hour to a full day and can consist of multiple types of workshops.the robot to move, use the sensors and perform specific tasks. The workshops are run by the local university chapter, which liaises with schools to arrange visits, and arranges for trained volunteers to run the workshops. Community events Robogals Melbourne held a Science and Engineering Expo in August 2010, partnered with National Science Week, attended by girls schools and a few individual families. In 2010, Robogals Perth went on an excursion to Kalgoorlie to demonstrate to school students as part of the seventh annual Science Awareness Festival by Scitech. In March 2011, Robogals London had a stall at the Big Bang Fair.p. 27, In 2009, Robogals' Guinness World Record attempt for the 'largest robot dance' received coverage on national television.The 7pm Project, Channel 10, 29 September 2009 Over 300 dancers/students turned up at the event on 29 September 2009 at the University of Melbourne. The Robots Are Coming was an exhibition built by art and design students, held from 6‚Äì11 September 2010 of 5 life-size robots at a transportation hub in central Sydney.The Robots Are Coming The event functioned as street art, inviting pedestrians to reflect on 'the impact of technology in today's society'. Over hundreds of thousands of pedestrians had lunch alongside the robots, or stopped to admire them. 2015 also saw the Robogals EMEA region join the BBC Tour across the UK http://www.robogals- emea.org/?page_id=54 SINE The annual conference in each region, known as a SINE (Seminars Inducting New Executive-committees) brings together the organisation's executive committee members in a region, focussing mainly on training the new committee members; it is the primary means of expanding Robogals to new universities. The meetings during the early Robogals expansion stages (in 2009 and early 2010) were called \\"Bootcamps\\", but since late 2010 have been called SINEs.

compiler of the controversial book The Tiananmen Papers. Zhang has refused to reveal his true identity for fear of repression and retaliation by the Chinese Communist Party against him, his family, and his friends.Zhang Liang, comp. Andrew Nathan and Perry Link, eds. The Tiananmen Papers: The Chinese Leadership's Decision to Use Force Against Their Own People ‚Äì In Their Own Words. New York: PublicAffairs, 2001. xxxix. .Chinoy, Mike. \\"'The Tiananmen Papers' Compiler Discusses his Actions.\\" CNN, June 3, 2001. Moreover, Zhang contends that he wants to remain anonymous to avoid being seen as a figurehead or a saviour. He believes that the Chinese government is the only entity which can reverse the damaged system One of the only known facts about Zhang is that he is a former high-ranking cadre within the Chinese Communist Party.Calmes, Ben. \\"Are the Tiananmen Papers Real or Fake?\\" Sinomania!, 2002. CNN. \\"China Government says Tiananmen Papers are Fake.\\" CNN, January 8, 2001. McKinnon, Rebecca. \\"Release of 'Tiananmen Papers' Could Stimulate Chinese Reform.\\" CNN, January 7, 2001. Some people within China and abroad believe that his unwillingness to reveal his identity immediately discredits the documents and accusations presented in The Tiananmen Papers.PBS. \\"The Tiananmen Papers.\\" PBS, April 11, 2006. https://www.pbs.org/wgbh/pages/frontline/tankman/cron/papers.html.  Motivations for Writing  Zhang and some of his pro-reform colleagues had petitioned the Chinese Communist Party to own up to, what they viewed as, its mistakes on June 4, 1989. However, because of the government‚Äôs unwillingness to change its position regarding its actions during the protests, Zhang felt he had no option but to collect the documents and release them publicly.Zhang, Nathan and Link. viii. Following the publishing of his book, Zhang met with CNN for an interview where he divulged that he felt it was his national duty to publish the secret documents and that ‚Äúwhat I did, I did for history and for the people.\\" Andrew Nathan and Perry Link, The Tiananmen Papers editors, write that Zhang had further hopes when publishing the material: In 2002, China had its 16th National Congress of the Communist Party of China. At this Congress, China would experience a political leadership overhaul and Zhang hoped that more progressive future leaders would lead China to a more democratic future.Lam, Willy. \\"Tiananmen Author Optimistic on Future Leaders.\\" CNN, June 3, 2001. By publishing the book a year in advance of the Congress, Zhang wanted to spark the memories of the Chinese public as well as other international support groups; and restore the spirit of the Tiananmen Square protests of 1989.  Authenticity  After arriving in the U.S., Zhang began looking for the most strategic way to publish the documents. He contacted Andrew Nathan and Perry Link, who later brought in Orville Schell, to help assemble the book. In order to authenticate the documents, Nathan, Link, and Schell all describe meeting with Zhang on multiple occasions and corroborating his accounts with documents and other historical interpretations of events around the time of the protests.Zhang, Nathan and Link. x-xiii, xxxviii-xli, lx-lxv, 469-474Lindsey, Daryl. \\"Vetting the 'Tiananmen Papers.'\\" Salon Media, February 2, 2001. http://www.salon.com/news/feature/2001/02/02/schell.Schell, Orville. \\"Analyzing the Tiananmen Papers: An American Sinologist Explains Why he Believes the Documents are Real.\\" TIME Asia, January 15, 2001. http://www.time.com/time/asia/magazine/2001/0115/tiananmen.view.html. They also offer detailed arguments about why they consider Zhang‚Äôs research and collection methods as correct and fair. Perhaps the most convincing reason that supporters of The Tiananmen Papers point to is the Chinese government‚Äôs reaction to the release of the documents. After the release of the book, the Chinese Communist Party heightened its security by ‚Äú[cracking down] on dissent,‚Äù and ‚Äú[tightening its] surveillance on liberal intellectuals as well as Chinese-American scholars doing research on China.\\" Further, the government began censoring all forms of media (print, internet, audio, etc.) related to the book.Zhang, Nathan and Link. xvii.Lam, Willy. \\"Tiananmen Book Sequel Likely: Editor.\\" CNN, March 21, 2001. Another government reaction was President Jiang Zemin reportedly stating ‚Äúthat [The Tiananmen Papers] amounted to ‚Äòthe worse case ever of the leakage of state secrets.'\\" This purported admittance and search for the leak only corroborates Zhang‚Äôs argument. Due to the contentious nature of the material in The Tiananmen Papers, many have refuted its claims and the authenticity of the documents presented. As could be expected, the main opposition comes from the Chinese Communist Party. It claims to have knowledge of one of Zhang‚Äôs colleagues, who alleges that he and Zhang collected some readily accessible materials from a news agency; followed by Zhang fleeing with the documents, incorrectly labelling them as Party reports, and finally fabricating further materials culminating in the book, The Tiananmen Papers. Further, the government accuses Zhang and his colleagues as being under foreign influence and aiming to extinguish the economic progress China has made over the past decade. Not only the government is contesting the accuracy of the book, but prominent China experts, as well as citizens who had been present during the protests of 1989, feel the documents and conversations discussed in The Tiananmen Papers are factually erroneous and ‚Äú[overly]-dramatic.‚Äù Also, critics argue that some expressions used in discussions between elders and other political players are inconsistent with the language of the elders, and more relative to Hong Kong and Taiwan.  Since Tiananmen Papers  After the book‚Äôs success, Zhang published several articles on current affairs in China for the Hong Kong Chinese press. During the publication of The Tiananmen Papers in 2001, Zhang resided in the U.S. Since then, his whereabouts are unknown.

Despite having only one arm, he also made four appearances for the Wales national side. Football career Lea was born in Wrexham and started his football career at the age of 15 when he helped launch the Wrexham Grosvenor club. He started out playing at full-back although he could play on the left wing when required. Despite only having one arm, he possessed \\"a natural flair with the ball\\" and his \\"all-round skill on the field\\" compensated for his disability, being noted for his \\"tremendous and powerful kick\\". By 1883, he had joined Wrexham, initially as a reserve player but was quickly promoted to the first team, signing as a professional for a weekly wage of 5 shillings, with bonuses enabling this to reach 10 shillings; this made him reputedly the highest paid player in Wales. Lea made his international debut for Wales on 23 February 1889, when he played at inside-left in the 4‚Äì1 defeat by England. In 1889‚Äì90, Lea was a member of the Wrexham team that reached the final of the Welsh Cup, going down 1‚Äì0 to Chirk. Later that year, Wrexham joined The Combination league. Their first game was played on 6 September 1890 against Gorton Villa, with Lea scoring Wrexham's only goal in a 5‚Äì1 defeat. Like Lea, his team-mated James Roberts also had only one arm. Although they only finished their inaugural league season in the penultimate position, Wrexham again reached the Welsh Cup Final, losing 5‚Äì2 to Shrewsbury Town. Lea received three further international caps, at left-half against Ireland on 7 February 1891 (lost 7‚Äì2), at right-half against Scotland on 21 March 1891 (lost 4‚Äì3) and at right- half against Ireland on 8 April 1893 (lost 4‚Äì3), when he was team captain; thus, he was on the losing side in all four of his international appearances. In his FAW assessment in 1891, he was described as \\"a good, hard-working player ‚Äì called upon at the last moment and had to play in the wrong position, appeared nervous. Played a good game against Ireland at left-half.\\" Shortly before his final international appearance, Lea captained Wrexham to victory in the Welsh Cup Final, defeating Chirk 2‚Äì1 on 3 April. Later that year, Lea became seriously ill and was at one point threatened with the loss of a leg. He eventually recovered and re-commenced his playing career in 1895, helping Wrexham reach the final of the Welsh Cup when they were defeated 3‚Äì2 by Newtown. Shortly afterwards, he was involved in an ill-tempered match against Druids in the Soames Charity Cup Final; Wrexham won the match with the only goal scored. At the end of the match, the Wrexham players were so roughly handled by some of the spectators that they had to flee from the pitch and make their way back to Wrexham as best they could. Lea later stated that \\"if that was what football was all about, it was the end for him\\". True to his word, that was his final appearance for the Wrexham first team, although he made a few appearances for the reserves. In December 1895, he was the beneficiary of a testimonial match between a Wrexham & District XI and Liverpool, won 5‚Äì0 by the visitors. Career outside football Lea combined his football career with working as a postman ‚Äì he sometimes started work at 5.30 a.m., did an 18-mile round on foot, and then caught the 9.20 train to an away match. After the match, he would return to Chester after the last train to Wrexham had departed, so had to walk home and be back on duty next morning. By 1900, he was reckoned to have walked over 80,000 miles in the service of the Post Office. After retiring from the Post Office, he became the landlord of the Wrest Hotel at Marchwiel, where he died on 23 March 1945, aged 78. Lea also played for Wrexham Cricket Club, principally as a bowler, but was also a useful batsman, making several half-centuries.

It is native from Senegal east to Sudan and Tanzania, south to Angola; and naturalized in China, Bangladesh, different ranges of Himalayan and Puerto Rico.Kew World Checklist of Selected Plant Families The plant contains a number of compounds of interest to the pharmaceutical industry and is widely used in traditional medicine. Description Rauvolfia vomitoria is a small tree or large shrub, growing to high. The branches grow in whorls, and the leaves grow from swollen nodes in groups of three. The leaf blades are broadly lanceolate or elliptical, tapering to a long point. The small, fragrant flowers are followed by globular red fruit. All parts of the plant, except the mature wood, contain latex. Ecology This is a fast-growing tree that produces large quantities of seeds which are dispersed by birds. The seedlings and saplings are tolerant of shade and the tree regenerates after cutting or burning, soon forming dense thickets. Uses Rauvolfia vomitoria has been used across its range in traditional medicine. A decoction or extract of the roots is extensively used to treat diarrhoea, jaundice, venereal disease, rheumatism and snake-bites, and is also used to reduce colic or fever, to calm people with anxiety or epilepsy, and to lower blood pressure. The macerated root, or sometimes the pulped fruit, is used to treat a variety of skin conditions, and the bark, twigs and leaves are used as a purgative and emetic. The plant contains a number of compounds used by the pharmaceutical industry; these include reserpine, reserpinine, deserpidine, ajmalicine and ajmaline. In the 1970s the bark from stems and roots was harvested and the reserpine extracted and sold for human use. It is still available, but has largely been replaced by less toxic products. 2,6-Dimethoxybenzoquinone is a benzoquinone found in R. vomitoria which is active against tumour cells. Every part of the tree is toxic, and this is put to use with a paste made from the pulverized root being coated on arrow tips and spears for hunting, and by being mixed with cassava meal to make rat poison. It has been identified as an invasive species in the Hawaiian island of Oahu.

The system can be applied to communities, buildings and villas, with different requirements for each. The pearl rating system is divided into Buildings, villa, and community. Each with the scale of 1 to 3 pearls. Similar to LEED, the Pearl Rating System has various levels of certification. ranging from one to three pearls. For all new development projects within the emirate of Abu Dhabi, a minimum certification of one pearl is required (two pearls for government buildings). This certification requirement was mandated by the Executive Council of Abu DhabiExecutive Council Order and went into effect Autumn 2010. There are three stages of certification associated with the Pearl Rating System. The first stage is the Pearl Design Rating, success of which is tied to the building permit. The second stage is the Pearl Construction Rating, success of which is tied to the certificate of completion. The third, and yet to be developed stage, is the Pearl Operations Rating. Training seminars of various lengths and technical depths are available for all of the Pearl Rating Systems. Training seminars are currently being delivered by the WSP GroupWSP Group and Oger InternationalOger International (Abu Dhabi) on behalf of the Urban Planning Council,Urban Planning Council Abu Dhabi. Individuals interested in working on Pearl Rated projects should become Pearl Qualified Professionals (PQPs); at least one PQP is required per project planned for development within the emirate of Abu Dhabi. The PQP test was developed by Prometric and is administered at the CERT center in Abu Dhabi and the AMIDEASTAMIDEAST testing center in Dubai. Based on review by Abu Dhabi‚Äôs Urban Planning Council (UPC), up to five pearls can be awarded. One pearl is mandatory for all developments and is based on the building code.

It can include body language, facial expressions, and other bodily gestures in order to communicate with others without the need of verbal communication. Body-to-body communication accounts for postures, body language, positioning in the environment, nonverbal language, gestures, movements and in general the people as a whole. This form of communication accounts for roughly up to sixty percent of human conversationZimmerman, Constance, and Luecke, Richard A.. Asserting Yourself At Work. Saranac Lake, NY, USA: Amacom, 2010. ProQuest ebrary. Web. 30 November 2015. and can be expressed in many different forms. Body-to-body communication can be used in collaboration with, as well as in replacement of verbal communication to emphasize the point being made.Guye- Vuilleme, A., T. K. Capin, S. Pandzic, N. Magnenat Thalmann, and D. Thalmann. \\"Nonverbal Communication Interface For Collaborative Virtual Environments.\\" Virtual Reality: Print. Substitution of nonverbal for verbal communication is often used when verbal communication does not allow the message to be conveyed or when it is not possible to communicate verbally. This includes over long distances or when there is an interruption verbal communication such as a noise or a distraction. Nonverbal communication can also be used to express a quick message that would otherwise take time to explain if expressed verbally. Human communication consists of both verbal and nonverbal interaction between each other. Nonverbal contributes to human communication in a variety of ways and is an important aspect of social interactions between humans. Nonverbal responses are known to be immediate and honest. Based on studies, body movement is the dominant behavior that defines nonverbal communication. Non- verbal Communication Non-verbal cues are just as important as the verbal cues. Even though one is not talking, one can still continue to communicate through bodily expressions. From the tone of voice, to the way people cross arms these all convey a message. Verbal communication expresses thoughts but, nonverbal communication expresses inner feelings and thoughts more realistically. Body Language gives very important hints of people's feelings and thoughts at a moment of making a decision. Gesture is not only communicative but it is an integral part of humans beings. This is endorsed by observations of those blind from birth, who gesture in a similar manner as people with sight, even if the other person is also blind. Clues of nonverbal language are controlled and activated by the limbic system in the brain. This is the part of the brain that reacts instantaneously, automatically and in real time. Because this is the part of the brain in charge of survival, it never rests and always remains on. This is the control center of emotions in which signals are shot to other parts of the brain, which assembles groups of behaviors that can be observed and decoded as they manifest into nonverbal language. These reactions occur without thinking and due to this, it is believed that these reactions are truly genuine. Because limbic responses of survival are intertwined in the autonomous nervous system, it is very difficult to hide them.  People With Disabilities  Nonverbal communication gives people who lack the ability to communicate verbally the ability to express things that otherwise could not be expressed verbally, which makes it easier to identify and understand their disorder. People with autism often have difficulty with both verbal and nonverbal communication. Autistic people have trouble reading social cues and are often unresponsive to bodily messages and to their environment.Coats, Erik J., Feldman, Robert S., and Philoppot, Pierre, eds. Nonverbal Behavior in Clinical Settings. Cary, NC, USA: Oxford University Press, 2003. ProQuest ebrary. Web. 30 November 2015. Major depression give messages of distress such as loss of energy, sleep disturbances, difficulty concentrating, and lack of motivation to signify their mental situation.  Sports  Body-to-body communication is utilized in sports and other cooperative games by creating rules as to how to use the body during the game and regulating bodily actions in regards to these rules. Body- to-body communication can be used to express emotion and physical well being as well as by people on the same team communicating plays and cooperative action. Athletes use bodily communication with their adversaries and audiences to convey a message of physical and mental confidence.  Professional Settings  Most work places have either written or understood rules about what body-to-body communication is appropriate and what is not. Nonverbal communication is utilized in a professional setting by adding assertion what is said verbally or by replacing verbal communication when it is not possible to verbalize something.Mcintosh, Perry, and Luecke, Richard A.. Interpersonal Communication Skills in the Workplace (2nd Edition). Saranac Lake, NY, USA: Amacom, 2008. ProQuest ebrary. Web. 30 November 2015. Visual communication in the workplace, such as bodily cues and facial expressions, paired with verbal communication and knowledge vocalization can create an attitude of assertion and improve professional behavior. Humans have many ways to express non- verbally. For example, with posture, clothes, make-up, and colors. Image Counsellors take this into account when transforming a client's appearance, with the purpose of transmitting a message. For this reason, in a professional setting, one is advised to dress a certain way. Dressing properly can communicate: professionalism, and experience. Sometimes humans will give off signs that will highlight confirmatory facts that otherwise can remain unapparent through the use of body communication. If an individual wishes for his message to be conveyed, he must mobilize his activity so that his message can be expressed during the interaction. For example, if an individual wishes to give the impression of being sure of their judgement, they will forgo the moment of thought. Instead, this individual will give an immediate decision which will demonstrate the audience that he is sure of his judgement. This is a practice that is used by many professionals such as lawyers, policemen, and doctors use in their work settings.  Disadvantages  Nonverbal communication is not as precise and explanatory as verbal communication and thus can be vague or misleading to those who are receiving the communication. Because this way of communicating is so varied and has so many ways of being expressed, some meanings can become lost or misunderstood. It can become difficult to focus on the message being conveyed if more than one gesture is being expressed at the same time and some signals can be missed if one is focusing on another at the same time, causing confusion in the message. This type of communication also makes it difficult to change subjects or to go into detail about a subject without the use of verbal indication.  NLD (Nonverbal Learning Disorder)  Body-to-body communication is only helpful to those with the ability to read and understand another person's body language and communication. Nonverbal communication is not possible to use for those who lack the ability understand bodily communication, specifically people with a nonverbal learning disorder.Mamen, Maggie. Understanding Nonverbal Learning Disabilities : A Common-Sense Guide for Parents and Professionals. London, GBR: Jessica Kingsley Publishers, 2007. ProQuest ebrary. Web. 1 December 2015.  Culture  Culture has a very significant impact on how people communicate, and this influences both verbal and nonverbal communication across cultures. The same way that people of different cultures speak in different languages, the use body language and nonverbal communication is very different across cultures and ethnic groups and only few nonverbal gestures have the same or a similar meaning universally. For example, bowing to a person indicates rank and status in Japan, but has little to no meaning in the United States. As for facial expressions, Asian cultures tend to suppress any facial expression whereas Mediterranean cultures exaggerate facial expressions when expressing sadness or anger. Although nonverbal communication is expressed differently across cultures, some is thought to be universal across cultures. This universal nonverbal language is thought to encompass human emotions, such as sadness, grief, anger, happiness, etc. A culture is a shared system of socially transmitted behavior passed on from previous generations that describes, defines, and guides people's ways of life. Culture can influence nonverbal communication in many ways. The same gestures in different countries can have distinct meaning. For example, the American A-OK sign can have an obscene meaning in many nations in Europe, having sexual implications. Facial expression is another mean of nonverbal communication that culture affects. Humans have the ability to express emotions through facial expressions. Cultural display rules are learned during childhood and plays a big part on how people from different cultures manage and modify their emotional expressions depending on the social situation that they are in. In an experiment done my Ekman and Friesen; results showed that Japanese people are more likely to disguise their negative emotions in the presence of other people, where Americans will not.

It was released in North America on November 18, 2008. It is the first video game to exclusively feature Chrysler automobiles for the Wii and the Nintendo DS. The game focuses on a story mode, in which the player, a nerd, attempts to become the coolest person in town by winning races with classic Chrysler vehicles. Chrysler Classic Racing garnered mediocre reviews from critics, who felt it had below average gameplay and excessively blatant advertising. As of 2010, Chrysler Classic Racing has received a 40.20% for its Wii version and a 33% for its DS version from review aggregation website GameRankings. Gameplay The player drives a car on a dirt path in the Wii version. In Chrysler Classic Racing, the player races classic Chrysler cars on various tracks. The main portion of the game is found in the story mode, where the player selects from one of four nerds, and after seeing a cool person driving a Chrysler car, decides to race to the top and become cool themselves. The car selection features Chrysler cars from the 1950s through the 1970s. Races mostly feature standard Wii controls, and require use of the Wii Remote nunchuk attachment. The Nintendo DS version uses the D-Pad and not the touch screen in order to control movement. Once a player has completed a track in story mode, they can then replay the track as many times as they want to outside the story mode; the game allows the player to set a \\"mirror mode\\", which reverses the track to give the player a new experience. After completing races, players must play one of three different minigames: \\"Be my Baby\\", \\"Gauntlet Challenges\\", and \\"Kings Challenges\\". In \\"Be my Baby\\", the player must collect teddy bears from a top-down perspective in order to impress women, while in the other two challenges, the player must race rivals in order to collect cool points and cash. Reception Chrysler Classic Racing garnered mediocre reviews from critics, who felt it had below average gameplay and excessively blatant advertising; it has received a 40.20% for its Wii version and a 33% for its DS version from review aggregation website GameRankings. IGN's Adam Ballard stated, \\"... Chrysler Classic Racing is basically one giant, terrible commercial.\\" He criticized most aspects of the game, feeling that it was lazily put together. In his review of the Nintendo DS version of the game, Adam Ballard described it as a \\"weak driving experience with shoddy artwork.\\" GameZone described the vehicle designs as \\"terrible\\", and lambasted the laziness that had gone into the game's control scheme.

The OTC has gone through several distinct changes since forming over 50 years ago. History Emerald Empire Athletic Association Formed by Bill Bowerman, the Emerald Empire Athletic Association (EEAA) was the predecessor to the Oregon Track Club. In 1948, Bill Bowerman became the assistant track coach at the University of Oregon, in Eugene, Oregon. In order to spur interest in running with the local community, Bowerman formed an all comers meet for grade schoolers in 1949. The next year the meet was expanded to include high school and college athletes. The low turnout of the all comers meet caused Bowerman to want to increase his efforts in promoting track and field in Eugene. In 1958, with the help of Ray Hendrickson and Bob Newland, Bowerman established the Emerald Empire Athletic Association. Ralph Christensen became the first president of the EEAA, and along with the other leaders established the goals for the EEAA:\\"Oregon Track Club History\\", retrieved 23 November 2010 #To promote youth program for youngsters in track and field. #To provide training assistance and facilities for track and field athletes of all ages. #To sponsor one big track meet each summer as a fundraising event to support the other goals. Change to Oregon Track Club In 1965 the Emerald Empire Athletic Association changed its name to the Oregon Track Club. This was in part due to the leadership's desire to concentrate mainly on track and field. Beginning in the late 1960s, the OTC started to become a dominant force in American Track and Field. Due to the relationship between the University of Oregon and the Oregon Track Club (both in Eugene, same coaches), many athletes from the University of Oregon's strong cross country and track and field programs decided to remain in Eugene to compete with the Oregon Track Club. The most notable of these athletes are Steve Prefontaine, who while running with the OTC placed fourth in the 1972 Summer Olympics in the men's 5000 meters race,GoPre.com retrieved 23 November 2010 and Mac Wilkins, who received the gold medal in the discus throw at the 1976 Summer Olympics. During this period of dominance, the OTC sent dozens of athletes to the Olympics, won several medals, and would have even more success had it not been for the 1980 Summer Olympics boycott that the American athletes participated in. Branches The Oregon Track Club is made up of three branches: the general club, the elite club, and the masters club. General Club Hayward Field in Eugene, Oregon The general part of the OTC is the largest subgroup in the OTC. It is made up of athletes under the age of 30 who pursue running for enjoyment. Many of these runners had no or little NCAA running experience, but are still running everyday and competing in organized meets because of the passion they exhibit for the sport. Throughout the years, the dedicated members of the OTC have been instrumental in advancing Track and Field in the United States. This has come in several different ways, including but not limited to, helping to design the legendary Hayward Field, hosting a number of major meets such as the 2008 US Olympic Trials, and inspiring thousands to enjoy the sport of running. Elite OTC Elite is the professional branch of the OTC and is based in Eugene, Oregon. The current format of the club was created in 2006 and originally coached by Frank Gagliano. In 2008 Mark Rowland became the Head Coach of OTC. For a time there were three groups of athletes who wore the OTC Elite uniform, one coached by Alberto Salazar and one coached by Jerry Schumacher. Alberto Salazar went on to coach the Nike Oregon Project, while Jerry Schumacher went on to coach Nike's Bowerman Track Club. The team has had great success in recent years, culminating at the 2011 IAAF World Championships with High Jumper Jesse Williams winning Gold, Ashton Eaton winning Silver in the Decathlon and Sally Kipyego winning Silver in the 10,000 meters. retrieved 1 March 2012 Masters The masters and submasters division of the OTC is a subgroup of the OTC designed for older members to stay competitive. The masters and submasters divisions have age restrictions to provide fair competition between athletes: 40 years old and older for the masters division and 30 to 39 years old for the submasters division. The OTC's masters division hosts the Hayward Classic, which is one of the premier masters track meets in the country.\\"OTC Masters\\" retrieved 6 December 2010 Youth In 2019, the club added a youth cross country program. This club is designed to fuel kids' excitement and love for running by giving them the opportunity to participate in this historic club, and be a part of Eugene's worldwide fame as TrackTown USA. A particularly unique aspect of the program is that the youth athletes receive encouragement and coaching from OTC elite runners, Olympians, and other local celebrities.

This relationship is due mostly to the fact that one of Nike's founders was OTC founder Bill Bowerman. It is also because Nike's main founder Phil Knight was a middle distance runner for the University of OregonKrentzman, Jackie. \\"The Force Behind the Nike Empire\\", Stanford Magazine, retrieved 7 December 2010 and had a close relationship with many of the athletes in the OTC. Throughout the years, Nike has contributed strongly to the OTC by supplying equipment and sponsoring competitions for athletes to compete against other track clubs across the nation. This relationship has greatly increased with the re- establishment of the OTC Elite.

He helped design the Bank in Naples, called the second Monte di Piet√†, started in 1539 with goal, according to Sasso, of liberating citizens from the supposed usury of the Jews. By 1597, the building was completed and unified all the banks in the city. In this project, he was aided by Giovanni Giacomo Di Conforto and Giovanni Cola di Franco. After leaving Naples for Rome, he worked in the studio of Federico Zuccari and performed numerous frescoes. He returned to Naples in 1590 to design several transition edifices from the Renaissance. For example, he helped complete the Muscettola chapel in the church of Santa Maria della Stella, now no longer extant. In 1591, he helped reconstruct the nave and apse of the church of Sant'Anna dei Lombardi. He also succeeded Francesco Grimaldi in the direction of the construction of San Paolo Maggiore. From 1598 to 1599 he helped design the Cappella del Tesoro in the Basilica of the Santissima Annunziata Maggiore. In these years, he accused the foreign rival in Naples, Domenico Fontana, of selecting a poor site for construction the Royal Palace. In 1601‚Äì1602, he was also entrusted the construction of the grain stores. In 1607, he participated in a contest to design the Reale Cappella del Tesoro di San Gennaro, competing against Ceccardo Bernucci, Giulio Cesare Fontana, Francesco Grimaldi, Giovanni Cola di Franco, Michelangelo Naccherino, Dionisio Nencioni di Bartolomeo, and Giovan Giacomo Di Conforto. The architects Grimaldi e Giovanni Cola di Franco submitted the winning design. In 1610, he was active in Ascoli Piceno, and provided designs for the oratorian church of San Pietro in Valle in the town of Fano in the Marche. He died and is buried in Loreto. Dionisio di Bartolomeo was one of his pupils. It is unclear if there is an architect from Rome (died 1623) with the same name was involved in the renovation of Santa Caterina in Fabriano.

He graduated with a bachelor of arts degree in 1930.1929 Michiganensian, page 337.1930 Michiganensian, page 108. Professional baseball At six feet, two inches, McAfee was considered \\"a giant\\" in the early 1930s. The tall right-handed pitcher began his Major League Baseball career with the Chicago Cubs. He made his major league debut on May 12, 1930, two weeks after graduating from the University of Michigan. McAfee pitched only one inning for the Cubs over the course of two games. In one inning of work for the Cubs, he faced 10 batters and allowed three hits, two bases on balls, one wild pitch, and five unearned runs. Despite the rocky start, he did not allow an earned run and compiled a 0-0 record and 0.00 ERA with the Cubs. After his brief stint with the Cubs, McAfee spent most of the 1930 season with the Reading Keystones in the International League. He appeared in 21 games for the Keystones and compiled a 7-8 record with a 6.22 ERA. In October 1930, the Cubs traded McAfee to the Boston Braves in exchange for Bobby Smith. In April 1930, The Sporting News reported on the expectations for McAfee: \\"McAfee did not show much promise in the conditioning search at St. Pete, but before the team left he was going along on high, [Bill] McKechnie spoke glowingly of his fast ball, curve, control and his pitching sagacity. It's almost too much to expect McAfee to fill Bobby Smith's shoes, but McKechnie will be a bit disappointed if McAfee does not step in as a regular starter.\\" McAfee appeared in 18 games for the Braves during the 1931 season, all but one as a relief pitcher. He compiled a 0-1 records with a 6.37 ERA. McAfee spent most of the 1932 season as the property of the Boston Braves, but playing under option with the Montreal Royals in the International League. He appeared in 23 games for the Royals, compiling an 8-9 record with a 4.70 ERA. McAfee joined the Washington Senators in August 1932. A trade had been announced to send McAfee and two other players to the Baltimore Orioles for Baxter Jordan, but Senators' owner Clark Griffith noted that McAfee had been optioned three times and claimed McAfee by the waiver route. In two months with the team, he compiled a 6-1 record with a 3.92 earned run average (ERA) in eight game (five as starter). During the 1933 season, Washington Senators manager Joe Cronin used McAfee to replace Firpo Marberry \\"as chief of the relief pitching brigade.\\" However, McAfee's ERA soared to 6.62, the highest of his major league career, in 61-2/3 innings with the Senators in 1933. Even so, he compiled a 3-2 record in 1933. In June 1933, McAfee punched a spectator in Cleveland after being pulled from a game; McAfee had been \\"razzed\\" throughout the game by the \\"leather-lunged rooter.\\" At the beginning of August 1933, McAfee was sent to the Rochester Red Wings in a deal for Ed Chapman. He appeared in 17 games for the Red Wings, compiling a 1-4 record with a 5.37 ERA. At the end of the 1933 season, the Red Wings sent McAfee to the Columbus Red Birds in the American Association. On February 15, 1934, the St. Louis Browns acquired him from Columbus. During the 1934 season, McAfee appeared in 28 games for the Browns, all as a relief pitcher. He compiled a 1-0 record with a 5.84 ERA.

A person's ability to deliver oxygen to the working muscles is affected by many physiological parameters, including heart rate, stroke volume, cardiac output, and maximal oxygen consumption. Understanding the relationship between cardiorespiratory fitness and other categories of conditioning requires a review of changes that occur with increased aerobic, or anaerobic capacity. As aerobic/anaerobic capacity increases, general metabolism rises, muscle metabolism is enhanced, haemoglobin rises, buffers in the bloodstream increase, venous return is improved, stroke volume is improved, and the blood bed becomes more able to adapt readily to varying demands. Each of these results of cardiovascular fitness/cardiorespiratory conditioning will have a direct positive effect on muscular endurance, and an indirect effect on strength and flexibility. To facilitate optimal delivery of oxygen to the working muscles, the person needs to train or participate in activities that will build up the energy stores needed for sport. This is referred to as metabolic training. Metabolic training is generally divided into two types: aerobic and anaerobic. A 2005 Cochrane review demonstrated that physical activity interventions are effective for increasing cardiovascular fitness.

In 2008 it expanded its activities to include a photographic unit, and it is now a centre which actively works with many different kinds of collections, developing curatorship as a creative site of knowledge. Projects, publications and courses aim, through practice, to open up novel combinations of the historically separated domains of the creative arts and the truth-claiming discourses of history and the social and natural sciences. The CCA is located in the Old Medical School Building on the Hiddingh Campus in the city of Cape Town. It neighbours the Iziko South African Museum and South African National Gallery, the Company Gardens of Cape Town, The Labia Theatre and the Drama Department of UCT. The CCA includes spaces for conservation, digital workstations, photographic reproduction, storage, documentation, the planning and constructing of exhibitions, research and teaching. Fundamental to the work of the CCA is the recognised need to both conserve and make collections accessible to artists, scholars and students. This is achieved through careful curatorship and high-quality digital documentation of collections; developing web-access, publications and the staging of exhibitions and public events. At the heart of the Centre is the understanding of collections and archives as important sites of knowledge, as products of traditions of art, ideas and values, as well as of the social and political circumstances of both their making and reception. The CCA works with several institutions in the realisation of its projects and curates exhibitions both in South Africa and abroad.

Annunziata, Cappella Rabatta) The Annunziata Polyptych is a painting cycle started by Filippino Lippi and finished by Pietro Perugino, whose central panel is now divided between the Galleria dell'Accademia (Deposition from the Cross) and the Basilica dell'Annunziata, both in Florence, Italy. The polyptych had other six panels, which are housed in the Lindenau-Museum of Altenburg, the Metropolitan Museum of New York City, the Galleria Nazionale d'Arte Antica in Rome and in a private collection in South Africa. Saint Lucy from the side panels of the polyptych . History The work was originally commissioned to Filippino Lippi for the high altar of the Annunziata Basilica in Florence. Lippi had already ceded the same commission to Leonardo da Vinci, who had executed a cartoon with St. Anne, the Virgin and the Child, before abandoning the work when he followed Cesare Borgia (1502). The work was thus reassigned to Lippi, who changed completely the theme. At his death in 1504 the painting, already completed in the central part, was assigned to Pietro Perugino, who completed it, including the secondary panels, in 1507. Once finished, the painting was sharply criticized by the Florentines, due to the alleged lack of originality of the composition. At the time, Perugino was often re-using the same cartoons, due to big number of commissions. The Annunciation altarpiece was thus Perugino's last work in Florence. Description The work was originally painted on two sides: the Assumption of the Virgin facing the faithful, and the Deposition from the Cross facing the choir. After the panel was split in two, the latter was moved in the Grand Duke's collections, and then to the Gallerie dell'Accademia; the Assumption remained in the church, and was later moved to the Rabatta Chapel. The polyptych had a frame designed by Baccio d'Agnolo. The Deposition shows the moment in which Jesus Christ is taken down from the cross after his death. Four men are carrying out the task by using ladders. On the ground, at the left, is the Virgin, fainting in the Swoon of the Virgin, and supported by the other Pious Women. The person praying at the foot of the cross is Mary Magdalene, regarding reverently the feet that she had so recently washed and anointed. On the right, caught in a surprised posture, is St. John the Apostle; in front of him, on the ground, are the nails of the crucifixion. It could also be that he is advising the men to be careful with their task, to handle the body of the Lord with ultimate care. According to Giorgio Vasari, Lippi executed the upper part of the painting. Jesus, left unfinished, was completed by Perugino concerning the face. The latter also painted the lower part of the work, characterized by his typical serene faces and the distant landscape. Perugino's assistants painted a great number of details, especially in the side panels. The polyptych was completed by a predella, now divided between several American museums. It included: *Nativity, 26.7x42.6 cm, Art Institute of Chicago *Baptism of Christ, 26.7x42.6 cm, Art Institute of Chicago *The Samaritan Girl at the Pit, 26,7x42.6 cm, Art Institute of Chicago *Noli me tangere, 26.7x42.6 cm, Art Institute of Chicago *Resurrection of Christ, 27x45.7 cm, New York, Metropolitan Museum 103px 100px 103px 104px 100px Predella of the Annunziata Polyptych Sources  External links *Page at Florence's Museums website Category:1507 paintings Category:Paintings by Filippino Lippi Category:Paintings by Pietro Perugino Category:Paintings of the Galleria dell'Accademia Category:Paintings depicting Jesus Category:Paintings of the Virgin Mary Category:Paintings of the Metropolitan Museum of Art Category:Musical instruments in art Category:Altarpieces Category:Paintings depicting Mary Magdalene ","title":"Annunziata Polyptych"},{"id":"29964255","text":"Melinda Vincze (born 12 November 1983) is a former Hungarian handballer who played for Duna√∫jv√°rosi KKA and the Hungarian national team.

It summarises the most important statistical findings on Switzerland's population, society, government, economy and environment. It serves not only as a reference book, but also provides in a series of overview articles a comprehensive picture of the social and economic situation of Switzerland.  History  The desirability of having a statistical yearbook was expressed for the first time on 29 June 1887. The Federal Council agreed to consider implementing this proposal, but before publishing the Yearbook it wanted to wait until the results of the 1888 census were available so they could be included in it (which subsequently proved to be only partially possible). Two years later, on 22 July 1889, the Director of the Statistical Bureau, Dr. Guillaume, presented a yearbook proposal divided into six theses to the Conference of Swiss statisticians in Aarau, which was adopted after a short discussion. The first thesis described the purpose of the publication: the Yearbook was supposed to inform the general public about the main results of Swiss statistics in easy-to-understand tables and comparable time series. Guillaume indicated that he had modelled the Statistical Yearbook of Switzerland on the Statistical Yearbook of Finland (a thin bilingual booklet) and the Statistical Yearbook of the German Reich (a more comprehensive volume with coloured maps). On 18 October 1890, Guillaume presented an outline of the Yearbook's chapters as well as a draft chapter to the Conference of Swiss statisticians for consultation. The first Statistical Yearbook of Switzerland, weighing in at 270 pages, was published on 8 April 1891. Apparently the response was mostly positive and the first edition seemed to live up to the expectations that might be made upon such a publication.  Development over 100 years  The concept adopted in the early days of the Statistical Yearbook, which aimed to make information available not just to specialists but to the public at large, corresponds to modern principles of statistical dissemination. This explains a certain similarity in the way information has been presented for more than 100 years: for example, the first edition already contained a visualisation of statistics in a series of thematic maps; and the 1897 edition was a graphic volume. By 1892, the \\"text\\" element also featured more prominently in the Yearbook. Statistical Yearbooks of Switzerland But not all editions of the Yearbook were modern in the sense described above: for several decades, volumes consisting purely of tables were published; text and graphs were dispensed with, not least for cost considerations. It was only for the 96th edition in 1989 that clear steps were taken to make the Yearbook more easily comprehensible and user-friendly again. As Federal Councillor Cotti put it in the foreword, the new design aimed \\"to bring statistics closer to the citizen\\".Federal Statistical Office, eds., Statistical Yearbook of Switzerland 1989, Zurich 1988, p. 6 (German) In 2001, the Statistical Yearbook was redesigned again: the current edition is a 900-page four-colour volume with an integrated CD-ROM which includes not only data, but (since 2003), an interactive atlas as well.  Current concept  The chapters of today's Yearbook, which correspond to the topics covered by official statistics, are divided into four parts: # \\"Overview\\". Each overview text presents a summary of key findings, analyses long-term trends and explains links between various indicators. This section, which also contains numerous graphics, is aimed at a wide audience, but is also intended to provide a useful overview for more specialised groups such as media people and politicians. # The \\"Surveys, Sources\\" section briefly describes the most important data sources. # The \\"Glossary\\" defines key terms. # Finally, the \\"Data\\" section corresponds to a classical statistical yearbook and remains the largest section. It mainly contains tables as well as some graphics and thematic maps.  CD-ROM  The Statistical Yearbook CD-ROM (which is not sold separately) contains: # The \\"digital Statistical Yearbook of Switzerland\\" ‚Äì an interactive application that allows easy navigation and searching of the electronic versions of all texts, tables, graphs and maps of the printed yearbook. These are complemented by a considerable number of tables ‚Äì notably with cantonal and communal-level data. # Two interactive atlases: the \\"Statistical Atlas of Switzerland\\" and (\\"as of the 2011 edition\\") the \\"Statistical Atlas of Europe\\" A full description and instructions on how to use all applications can be found on the CD-ROM.  Yearbook archive  Thanks to close cooperation with the Federal Office of Information Technology, Systems and Telecommunication (FOITT), the FSO also makes available an \\"electronic version of all editions of the Yearbook from 1891 to 1957\\" ‚Äì a useful and interesting source for historians, students and all other interested persons. The files are in PDF format and show the original typography, but electronic search options make it possible to consult the texts as easily as in a modern electronic publication. The files are quite large (between 16 and 50 MB!), but with a high-speed internet connection downloading them should not cause any problems.  Statistical Data on Switzerland  \\"Statistical Data on Switzerland\\" is a clearly presented booklet which is updated every year and is intended to provide an \\"iron ration\\" of the most important key figures for Switzerland. This 50-page free publication in A5 format fits in a coat pocket and includes the most important information on Switzerland's geography, population, employment and income, economy, transport, social security, education and science. The \\"Statistical Data on Switzerland\\" is published in five languages: German, French, Italian, Romansh and English.

He founded Farmer's Savings Bank, and was the president until he died in 1917. He was also a member of the board of directors of First National Bank. In addition to his involvement with the bank system, Winans was a clerk in several locations throughout the region, and so is personally responsible for the majority of the records of the Colville Indians and others in the region, as well as the records of the financial dealings in the late 19th century and the early 20th century. Winans played an important role in keeping records of Indians because he was named Industrial Instructor for Indians in 1869 and Superintendent of Indian Affairs in 1870. In addition to those offices, Winans took multiple censuses of Indian populations, including the Okanagans, Calispels, San Poils, Nespelems, Senijexsees, Wenatchees, Isle d'Pierres, Mishouies, Spokanes, and the Swielpees. He was a historian himself, and wrote several histories of the region, including a book, Stevens County, Washington, its creation, addition, subtraction and division. Several of his works were given to institutions such as Harvard University and Washington State University. Eastern Washington, particularly Stevens County and Walla Walla, would not be the same if William Parkhurst Winans had not been there with his business and record-keeping skills. As the Old Walla Walla County, Washington records, \\"No history of Walla Walla would be complete without extended reference to William Parkhurst Winans, who was an octogenarian at the time of his demise. He had long been identified with the northwest, and his life was one of great usefulness and activity.\\" By the end of his life, Winans was an essential part of the Walla Walla community due to his hard work and involvement in the fields of business, education, Indian affairs, and the church. Biography William Parkhurst Winans was born in Elizabeth, New Jersey on January 28, 1836. He was one of eight children born to Jonas Wood Winans and Sarah Stiles. Winans arrived in Umatilla River, Oregon in September 1859, and he worked as a warehouseman and a school teacher there until 1861. In July of that year, Winans headed north from Oregon to Fort Colville in Washington. There, he was appointed deputy auditor of Spokane County. The following year he was promoted from deputy auditor to auditor. It was during his time in Colville that Winans began involvement in business in addition to his positions in government. He opened a small general store in Colville with the money he had made in government. His next government appointment was as the clerk for the United States district court which included Spokane County and Missoula County. His first elected government position was in 1866 as superintendent of schools in Spokane County. He represented Stevens County in meetings of the Washington Territorial Legislature in 1867, 1868 and 1870. On October 6, 1869, Winans was married to Lida Moore. They had three sons together-Gilbert Park, Phillip Moore, and Allan Lida. Lida died on December 4, 1876. On November 20, 1879, Winans remarried to Christine McRae. They had two surviving children together- Freeman Earl and Sarah Jean. Winans was named Sub-Indian Agent in 1870 for six tribes residing near Colville that had refused to make treaties with the federal government. He successfully argued against the directive by President Grant to give these tribes rights to lands in Stevens County on which white settlers had already established their homes. Business Ventures In 1874 Winans moved from Colville to Walla Walla, Washington. He joined the mercantile firm Johnson, Rees & Co., which was the largest store in Walla Walla at that time. While in Walla Walla, he diversified his business ventures, investing in farming, merchandising, freighting and banking. As he became wealthier, he travelled to the east coast and throughout Europe. He was a very active member of the Walla Walla community, involved in church and business matters. Winans was an elder in Walla Walla Presbyterian Church, and acted as a temporary pastor when the active pastor died until a new pastor arrived. He was on the board of directors for First National Bank of Walla Walla and was President of Farmer's Savings Bank from 1890 until his death in 1917. William Parkhurst was known as a great business man. During his life he had many accounts with several companies for his business ventures. He started out his career working for the Spokane County Treasurer, and then went in all different directions from there. Winans had many accounts while working for the Spokane County Treasurer, including accounts with Big Bend Mining District, Olf Fort Store notes and accounts, and with the Indian office. From there he went on to deal with Abrams and Co. business, where he dealt with their business trial accounts. Winans was also a lawyer and dealt with the law side of business when he needed to. Winans started a business called Brown and Winans, which gave him more people and accounts to work with. Despite occasional difficulties, Winans did well overall throughout his business career, and was known to all as an astute and hardworking businessman. Writings Personal life Winans spent much of his life documenting the world around him. He applied his love for details to all of his business positions as well as to his personal life, thereby leaving us with wonderfully specific records of all of the agencies he worked for. The Washington State University Manuscripts, Archives, and Special Collections has nearly 1000 documents from Winans, most of which include business records and professional correspondence. These documents are a wellspring of information for anyone interested in the Pacific Northwest at the time of Winans' life. Winans was an amateur historian. He wrote everything down, which proved invaluable for historians following him. Many of the surviving documents include his personal diaries. Winans kept meticulous records of everything he did, including expenditure of funds and day-to-day accounts of his actions. His diaries were incredibly specific, and often contained bits of history that he learned about his surroundings, (even including bits of dried flowers and plants pressed between the pages). One example of his specificity was his trip to Egypt. He spent several weeks in Egypt in 1892, and wrote down everything that he did and learned. On Monday, March 21, 1892, after a trip to an ancient temple, Winans wrote: Capitals as varied as the vegetation of the land and are even now dazzling bright in the many colored hues as when the painter left them, the ceiling is blue with golden stars. But we go farther into the shadowy recesses of the Temple no windows to light, a small opening into each of the three most sacred rooms. This diary entry shows his flair for the dramatic, but also highlights his fascination with history and other cultures. The details are useful for those who wish to learn about the time period in which he lived, because he wrote about the little things that would seem too insignificant to be put in an official record, but that historians later on would still find interesting. In addition to his personal writings, Winans also wrote for other people. He recorded a biography of Edward Marsden, an Indian of the tribe Metlakatla in Alaska. Winans also wrote a history of Lewis and Clark and of the trappers in the Pacific Northwest. His goal was to bring to light that which had been previously neglected. He says: And in the settlement of this country, we hear of Parker, Whitman, and others, but no mention of those explorers who first beheld our valley and made it known to the civilized world. My subject will be in relation to them, to Lewis and Clark, who made this country known to the Pioneers about 25 years ago. Winans wanted to ensure that the whole country was aware of the history of the Pacific Northwest, and that credit was given where it was due for settling it. His histories of Northwestern people are valuable for modern day folk because they show the opinions of the time, which differ from the opinions of our own. Along with the shorter writings, Winans wrote an extensive history of Stevens County. He eventually wrote a book, Stevens County, Washington, its creation, addition, subtraction and division, which gives the entire history of Stevens County as Winans could find it. He cites many resources for his book, including his personal diary. In a note he wrote to the Chairman of the Historical Society of the Women's Reading Club in Walla Walla, Winans emphasizes the usefulness of his journal in writing the history of Stevens County. He says, \\"In [the preparation of historical notes,] I am indebted to Thomas W. Prosch... and lastly to my journal, which I kept during my thirteen years residence in Colville Valley. \\" He used his journals as a resource in writing his histories, because he was alive during many of the big, important changes that occurred in the region. As The Old Walla Walla, Washington put it,\\"he lived to witness the remarkable transformation of the county as it emerged from pioneer conditions.\\" Winans was able to document much of the rapid changes in the Pacific Northwest during his lifetime, which is so useful for people following him. Indian Affairs Some of Winans most significant official work was as Sub-Indian Agent for the six non-treaty tribes in the Fort Colville region. In a letter to the secretary of the Interior entitled \\"Proposed Indian Reservations in Idaho and Washington Territories,\\" Winans successfully argued against a directive to make lands that whites had already settled into Indian Reservations. Instead of regaining their lands, the Indians were paid for the lands that whites had already settled according to a determined \\"fair cash value.\\" Like many whites at the time, Winans believed that Native Americans should be assimilated into western culture whenever possible, in order to \\"civilize\\" them. He advocated education for Native Americans along with helping them develop farming techniques and abandonment of their hunter-gatherer ways. One Indian with whom Winans was particularly involved was Edward Marsden. Winans travelled to Alaska to meet and speak with Marsden, and wrote several drafts of a biography of Marsden before sending it to the Historical Society. Winans wrote \\"We came to teach the Indian, but he is now teaching us, by giving us a practical example of 'Leaving all and following Christ.'\\" Winans initially seemed to share the opinions held by many White people about the barbaric nature of Indians, but he was willing to change that opinion when there was good reason to do so. Because of his high status in society, Winans' positive writings about Marsden would have helped to improve his peers' opinions on Indians. One of his duties as Sub-Indian Agent was to take censuses of the Indians. Winans took censuses of the Okanagans, Calispels, San Poils, Nespelems, Senijexsees, Wenatchees, Isle d'Pierres, Mishouies, Spokanes, and the Swielpees. These censuses were valuable at the time, and also contain much valuable information for modern- day historians. Winans also kept records of transactions with the Indians, including gifts given to chiefs and needy Indians, and several listings of property amounts. He also wrote dozens of vouchers for dozens of different people. Death On April 22, 1917, Winans went on a trip to pick wildflowers, and died suddenly. His funeral and memorial services were well attended by the entire community, and business in Walla Walla nearly stopped for respect of him. The funeral was held at Walla Walla Presbyterian Church, and his body was placed in Mountain View Cemetery in Walla Walla. The town's Sunday school children placed wildflowers on his grave in memory of his love for them. He was remembered by the whole town as a hard working, upstanding citizen who impacted everyone he encountered. Legacy William Parkhurst Winans was an important figure in Pacific Northwest History. He was responsible for the development of Stevens County, Walla Walla, and Fort Colville. He was extremely devoted to the banking system. He personally established a banking system for farmers named Farmer's Savings Bank and remained as president until his death in 1917. He also established himself in other divisions of banking where he was a member of First National Bank. He was a clerk for banks and government agencies across the region. He was responsible for the majority of the records for Native Americans and financial dealings in the late 19th and early 20th century. His devotion to keep the records for indigenous peoples made it possible for historians and anthropologists to learn and understand Native American affairs and their history. Winans also created a census for Native Americans and document their populations in the Pacific Northwest. His work paid off when he was made superintendent of Indian Affairs in 1870. In his personal life, he was an amateur historian and wrote several history books, providing secondary sources on eastern Washington. The documents about his life have been preserved and are on file with Washington State University and Harvard University. His devotion in establishing a banking system, his influence on American Indian affairs, and eastern Washington may have never been developed as successfully as it has, and its history may have never been recorded quite so well.

The mountain is on the borders of the municipalities of Hachimantai, Takizawa, and Shizukuishi, west of the prefectural capital of Morioka. Much of the mountain is within the borders of the Towada-Hachimantai National Park. The mountain is also referred to as the \\"Nanbu Fuji\\" for its resemblance to Mount Fuji. Geology Aerial photographs of Mount Iwate from the NNW Relief Map Mount Iwate consists of a younger eastern symmetrical stratovolcano (Higashi- Iwate, \\"East Iwate\\") overlapping an older western stratovolcano (Nishi-Iwate, \\"West Iwate\\") which has collapsed to form a caldera. Nishi-Iwate was formed approximately 700,000 years ago, and forms two-thirds of the mountain body. Nishi-Iwate was a later (300,000 years ago) parasitic volcano, which now forms the summit of the mountain. The oval-shaped, 1.8 x 3 km caldera of Nishi-Iwate has a 0.5 km wide crater, partially filled by a crater lake called Lake Onawashiro. Several somma including Yakushidake, the largest, surround the more recent Higashi Iwate crater rim. During the historical period, Mount Iwate erupted in 1686-1687 with a pyroclastic surge; however, the eruption of 1732 was much larger and resulted in a substantial lava flow on the northeast slopes of the mountain. This four-kilometre long lava flow (\\"Yakebashiri Lava Flow\\") has been designated a Natural Monument by the Japanese government. Mount Iwate has largely been quiet since 1732, with a small emission of steam and ash in 1919 and a series of volcanic earthquakes from 1998 to 2003.

The work was painted for the church of St. Peter Martyr of Udine. It was acquired by the Austrians after the Napoleonic Wars, and assigned to the Hofmuseum in Vienna in 1838. It was given back to Italy in 1919. Description The work is signed and dated VICTORIS CHARPATJO / VENETI OPVS / 1496 on a cartouche attached to the basement. It is contemporary of Carpaccio's cycle of the Legend of Saint Ursula and shows some influences of Giovanni Bellini. It depicts Christ standing on a double basement, keeping the Cross. Behind him is a damask cloth held by two angels and, at the sides, a landscape inspired to the Venetian hills; the castle on the right is similar to that of Udine. In the foreground are four angels with the Instruments of the Passion: from the left, the Holy Lance, the nails from the cross, the sticks of the Flagellation and the Holy Sponge.

History of the society and museum The society started as a gentleman's club that met in the Haarlem City Hall to discuss science topics and promote the study of the arts and sciences. They pooled resources to purchase books and specimens for study, which were kept in the town hall until they purchased a building on the Grote Houtstraat (nr. 51, since unrecognizably rebuilt), where the curator of the collection lived. Under the direction of Martin van Marum a proper museum was established with zoological specimens located there on display for the public, as a forerunner of the modern Naturalis in Leiden.Johannes Abraham Bierens de Haan, De geschiedenis van een verdwenen Haarlemsch museum van natuurlijke historie.

It was originally called Hazelwood House when first built in the early 19th century. The original house was destroyed in 1908 and completely rebuilt. It is now a hotel owned by the Ruparelia family. History A wealthy Londoner Henry Botham built the first Hazelwood House from around 1810 as a country residence. Between 1810 and 1826 he acquired some of surrounding land as a park. The ownership of Hazelwood House stayed in the Botham family for many years. It later passed around 1850 to Sir Henry Robinson Montagu, the 6th Lord Rokeby, a soldier who had fought at Waterloo as a 16-year-old Ensign and later commanded a division of the British army in the Crimean War. Other notable owners include Admiral Ralph Cator from 1886 and the Vicar of Honingham, Henry Stewart Gladstone in the early 20th century. Gladstone made a thousand pounds worth of improvements to the property, but a fire on 8 March 1908 completely destroyed the house, and it had to be demolished. Assisted by an insurance compensation of ¬£10,500, Gladstone rebuilt the second Hazelwood House, similar in appearance to the first, but sited at a different angle to the ornamental grounds. In 1930, the house was sold to Francis Edwin Fisher, a substantial landowner, farmer, meat wholesaler and businessman who frequently travelled the world with his wife, the explorer and journalist Violet Cressy-Marcks. During their absences the house was left empty or rented out. Among the short-term occupants of this period was the Emperor Haile Selassie of Ethiopia, an exile from his country after the invasion by Italy in 1936. From 1939 until 1971 the house went through various uses and often stood empty. Part of the estate was taken over by the Ministry of Defence for aircraft manufacture, later becoming the Rolls- Royce aircraft factory, and in the 1990s Leavesden Film Studios. In the 1970s, the cinema industry became interested in the house as a location, and a number of the Hammer House of Horror Productions were filmed there as well as The Executioner directed by Sam Wanamaker, and The Raging Moon (1971) by director Bryan Forbes. Shortly after this period Paul Edwin Hember, the owner of several small businesses, bought the house and changed its name to Hunton Park.

Background During the post- Seljuk era in the second half of the middle ages, numerous Turkoman principalities, which are collectively known as the Anatolian beyliks, emerged in Anatolia. Initially the Karamanids, centered on the modern provinces of Karaman and Konya, were the most important power in Anatolia. But towards the end of the 14th century the Ottomans began to dominate most of Anatolia, reducing Karamanid influence and prestige. Thus the campaign of Timur to Anatolia and the ensuing Ottoman Interregnum gave the Karamanids a chance for revival. However the Karamanids also experienced a period of interregnum during Ottoman interregnum, so they were unable to end Ottoman domination in Anatolia. Ibrahim Bey and the Ottomans Ibrahim Bey was Mehmet Bey's son. He fought against his uncle Ali Bey, and with Ottoman support he ascended to throne in 1424. Nevertheless, their help did not ensure his fidelity to the Ottomans.Halil Ibrahim ƒ∞nal: Osmanlƒ± Tarihi, Nokta Kitap ,2008,ƒ∞stanbul, P.128 He secretly allied himself with Kingdom of Hungary against them. During the Ottoman wars in Europe, he was able to capture the city of Bey≈üehir from the Ottomans. However, in 1433, Ottoman Sultan Murat II returned to Anatolia and Ibrahim sued for peace in 1435.Prof. Ya≈üar Y√ºce-Prof. Ali Sevim: T√ºrkiye Tarihi Cilt I', AKDTYKTTK Yayƒ±nlarƒ±, ƒ∞stanbul, 1991 p 252 Nevertheless, shortly after the peace, Ibrahim laid a siege on Amasya an important Ottoman city to which Murat reacted by supporting the Dulkadirids to capture the city of Kayseri and ƒ∞sa, Ibrahim's brother, to capture Ak≈üehir from Karamanids. Ibrahim was forced to lift the siege in 1437. During the following seven years peace prevailed in Anatolia. But in 1444 when a great crusader army began marching on the Ottoman capital, Ibrahim saw his chance and plundered Ottoman cities in Anatolia including Ankara and K√ºtahya. Murat, caught between two fires, had to sign the Treaty of Szeged with the crusaders and then returned to Anatolia and retaliated. Ibrahim was forced to sign a treaty with unfavarable terms (called sevgendname). Although after Murat's death Ibrahim allied himself with Venice, he didn't fight against the Ottomans. Ibrahim Bey and the other powers Although Mamluks in Egypt supported ƒ∞sa, Ibrahim's brother against Ibrahim during the early years, Ibrahim and the Mamluks were usually on good terms. However competition over √áukurova (ancient Cilicia) destroyed the friendship. Ibrahim captured the important castle of Corycus in Mediterranean coast (modern Kƒ±zkalesi) from the kingdom of Cyprus in 1448. This enabled him to conquer the rest of √áukurova. But Mamluks together with Turkmen beylik of Ramazan which was their vassal attacked on Karamanids in 1456. So Ibrahim gave up hopes to conquer √áukurova.Online history Last years During his last years, his sons began struggling for the throne. His heir apparent was ƒ∞shak, the governor of Silifke. But, Pir Ahmet, a younger son declared himself as the bey of Karaman in Konya. Ibrahim escaped to a small city in western territories where he died in 1464. In popular media In the 2012 film Fetih 1453, Ibrahim of Karaman is played by Arslan ƒ∞zmirli. He is depicted as a bey provoked by Emperor Constantine XI (Recep Aktuƒü) to rebel against the Ottoman Empire. Later, he decides to make a peace agreement with Mehmed II (Devrim Evin).

I.E.E 1964, TK1.I22. and in 1937/38 he was the inventor of a high stability crystal-controlled variant of the Colpitts oscillator. With the outbreak of war imminent, his circuit was put to immediate use by the BBC to drive its Medium Wave broadcast transmitters, allowing the implementation of Britain's wartime single-frequency synchronised radio services from multiple transmitters. This was a technique adopted to try to prevent the Luftwaffe conducting air raids on British cities using BBC transmitters for navigation. Due to wartime security measures, Gouriet's oscillator design was kept secret until after World War II. Meanwhile, the same circuit was independently discovered by James Kilton Clapp of the USA, and published by him in 1948. Gouriet's oscillator is usually known as the Clapp oscillator as a result, although newer books use the term Gouriet-Clapp oscillator. In 1943, Gouriet transferred to the BBC's Research Department, and in 1950 he became Head of the Television Section of the Research Department. Gouriet presented the Fleming Memorial Lecture for the Royal Television Society twice in February 1954, on the subject of Colour Television.

He was a banker, businessman, real estate developer, and a philanthropist; and was involved in a number of the area's iron mining- related businesses, including acting as a director the Cleveland Iron Company. White served in many local and state public offices, including postmaster, county clerk, school board member, state representative and senator, and as a member of the state library commission and a Regent of the University of Michigan. Poet William Henry Drummond said of White, \\"the trail Peter White has cut through life is blessed by acts of private charity and deeds of public devotion that will serve as a guide to those who follow in the footsteps of a truly great, and above all, good man.\\" Early life (1830‚Äì1848) Peter White was born on October 31, 1830 in Rome, New York, the son of Peter Quintard White and Harriet Tubbs White.Williams, page 30 Peter's grandparents were Captain Stephan White, who commanded Fort Stanwix in 1777 during the American Revolutionary War and Mary Quintard White, from whom Peter received his middle name. Peter White's mother, Harriet, died when he was a young boy. Soon after, when Peter was nine, his family moved to Green Bay, Wisconsin.Williams, page 31 White attended school in Green Bay, and his father remarried. In 1842, White became dissatisfied with his family life, and left home to fend for himself at the age of 13. White travelled to Mackinac Island, doing odd jobs until he found steady employment tending a store. After a time, White drifted to Sault Ste. Marie, and from there hired on to crew a schooner sailing between Detroit and the Sault. During one of the voyages, the schooner sank, and the sailors took passage on another ship.Williams, page 32 While in port in Bay City, Michigan, White fell while boarding the ship and broke his arm. The arm was badly set and swelled; on arrival in Detroit, local doctors thought it required amputation. However, Dr. Zina Pitcher, invited to observe the operation, recommended waiting;Williams, page 33 the swelling subsided, Pitcher reset the arm, and White's arm was saved. It took White's arm four months to heal, but as soon as he was able he began work as a clerk at Freeman & Bro., a store on Jefferson Avenue in Detroit.Williams, page 34 He stayed on as a clerk for a year, then shipped out, hoping to be an assistant lighthouse keeper at the Waugoshance Light. This position fell through, and White worked that summer building the crib pier at Waugoshance. When not working on the lighthouse, White worked as a store clerk and attended school on Mackinac Island. He remained on the island for two years.Williams, page 35 The iron fields and the founding of Marquette (1849‚Äì1850) In 1849, Robert J. Graveraet arrived on Mackinac Island, looking for men to accompany him to prospect in the newly discovered iron fields of the Upper Peninsula, on behalf of what would become the Marquette Iron Company.Williams, page 36 A friend, customs inspector Samuel K. Haring, urged White to join the party. Sensing an opportunity, White joined, despite taking a pay cut. The party set sail from Mackinac Island, through Sault Ste. Marie, and eventually landed where Marquette, Michigan is now located. The party moved inland, and took possession of the land west of the Jackson Mine, near what is now Ishpeming, Michigan and the Cleveland Mines. After marking the site and spending a month clearing the area and prospecting for iron there, on June 10, 1849 they returned to the shore, expecting a shipment of machinery and more men from Worcester, Massachusetts.Williams, page 38 The ship had arrived, and the party cleared the ground in the area to locate a town. The settlement was first called Worcester, but the name was soon changed to \\"Marquette\\" in honor of Jacques Marquette. More men arrived on a second ship, and the party cleared land and erected buildings in Marquette to house a machine shop, forge, saw mill, and other industrial efforts. White worked as a fireman with the steam boiler, then as a mechanic in the machine shop.Williams, page 42 Although still young, White was much in the confidence of Graveraet, the party's leader, due in part to White's nimble mind and facility with languages.Williams, page 43 In particular, White could speak both French and Chippewa, and Graveraet would task White with some delicate missions requiring one versed in language. In the spring of 1850, the forge of the Marquette Iron Company was commissioned, and White was put in charge of the company store.Williams, page 47 By the fall, the town of Marquette had swelled in size, with workers for the Carp River Forge rolling into town.Williams, page 50 White took a job carrying mail between Marquette and L'Anse, but the pay never materialized, and he returned to his job at the company store.Williams, page 51 Public service in Marquette (1851‚Äì1857) In the summer of 1851, the county of Marquette was organized, splitting off from Houghton County.Williams, page 54 White was elected county clerk and register of deeds, despite not being of the requisite age. As county clerk, White was also a member of the school board; he was elected treasurer of the board, a position he held until his death over 50 years later. In 1852, W. H. Bruce of Green Bay, who had the responsibility of distributing mail to all of the Upper Peninsula, received Philo Everett's resignation as the postmaster of Carp River.Williams, page 57 Bruce knew Peter White's father Stephen, and apparently did not know that the Carp River settlement was growing moribund as its forge failed, and so appointed Peter White as the new postmaster of Carp River. White ran the Carp River post office out of the store he clerked at, which was indeed next door to the house of the Marquette postmaster.Williams, page 60 Because White's store was more convenient, more citizens began sending mail through the Carp River post office than the next-door Marquette post office, and the postal service, whose officials were in far-away Washington, D.C., soon closed the Marquette office. After some time, White formally changed the name of his post office to \\"Marquette,\\" and he continued as the town's postmaster for a total of 12 years. In May 1853, the Marquette Iron Company folded, in part due to concerns that its claims on the iron fields west of Jackson Mine would be superseded by a previous claim made by the Cleveland Iron Company.Williams, page 65 The Cleveland Company purchased the assets of the Marquette, including the company store where White worked. White continued working for the Cleveland Company for some time, but resigned in 1854 and opened his own store.Williams, page 83 In 1855, Peter White assumed the management of 64 acres of land in Marquette, which the Cleveland Company had received from the Marquette Iron Company.Williams, page 144 This was White's first taste of real estate dealings, a career which he expanded later. The area around Marquette was growing, and in 1857 the state legislature was due to distribute lands granted to the state by the United States Congress.Williams, page 145 White ran for a seat in the legislature, hoping to represent Marquette while the land distribution was debated. He won, and that winter attended the legislative session in Lansing, taking 15 days to arrive after snowshoeing from Marquette to Escanaba. By accounts, he did an admirable job in the legislature, but he did not run for re-election. Also in 1857, the land office was transferred from Sault Ste. Marie to Marquette, and Marquette was made the port of entry in place of the Sault.Williams, page 147 White then took over the position of land register and collector of customs for the port. Around this time White also began studying law, eventually forming the firm of White & Maynard, where he practiced for ten years.Williams, page 148 He also began the firm of Peter White & Co. in 1853, for the purpose of conducting banking business. In fact, 1857 was a busy year for White. He still ran his store and worked as a lawyer, while simultaneously acting as county clerk, registrar of deeds, school board treasurer, postmaster, land registrar, and collector of customs. In addition, he served as a state representative, and he got married. On September 29, 1857, White married Ellen S. Hewitt, the daughter of Dr. Morgan L. Hewitt, the first president of the Cleveland Company. The couple had six children, four of whom died young. (Saint Paul's Episcopal Church in Marquette contains stained glass windows dedicated to his children and a chapel built by Peter White in memory of his 12-year-old son Morgan.) Of the remaining two, one daughter married A. O. Jopling and had two children, before she also died, preceding White in death. White's lone remaining daughter, the only one of his children to outlive him, married George Shiras III, son of United States Supreme Court Justice George Shiras, Jr.Williams, page 278 Peter White the businessman (1858‚Äì1880s) Peter White in the 1860s In addition to his earlier real estate dealings, White began contracting to supply materials for construction. He supplied Norway pine for the Marquette ore docks. White also tried his hand at banking through Peter White & Co., lending out money to some entrepreneurs such as Stephen Gay and his Bancroft Furnace.Williams, page 168 In 1862, White incorporated, starting the First National Bank of Marquette and serving as its first cashier.Williams, page 172 White was also in the business of selling iron, usually piecemeal to schooners returning to more southern ports. He was able to obtain the iron from his contacts with the Bancroft Furnace. Near the end of the Civil War, White realized that once the war was over, American industry would want more iron than could be immediately supplied.Williams, page 173 Acting on that notion, White went on a buying spree, traveling to other ports such as Detroit and buying up iron warehoused there, often the same iron he himself had sold earlier. He quickly resold the iron in Cleveland for double what he paid for it, clearing $35,000. This money was the foundation of his personal fortune. In 1869, White became president of the First National Bank,Williams, page 181 an office he held until his death. In addition to his banking and real estate business, he invested in other businesses. He at one time owned The Mining Journal, selling it in 1868 to Alfred P. Swineford, and owned the Upper Peninsula Brewing Company.Kim Hoyum, \\"Brewery gone but not forgotten,\\" Mining Journal, July 4, 2007 Mining-related business opportunities abounded in the Marquette area; White was a director of the Cleveland Iron Company, and tried his hand at organizing both the Carp River Forge. and the Munising Furnace. He also began an insurance company, was a director of the People's State Savings Bank of Detroit, and owned large tracts of timbered land. Somewhat later the town of Marquette was incorporated, and White ran for mayor.Williams, page 183 He was naturally a Democrat, although he broke with the party later over certain monetary positions. White did no campaigning, and lost the election. Four years later, he was unanimously elected to the position; however, he declined to serve.Williams, page 184 In 1875, White was elected to the Michigan Senate, and was particularly successful in getting aid for a railroad between St. Ignace and Marquette.Williams, page 186 He also introduced a bill to establish a state-supported school in Marquette. Although unsuccessful then, White fought for 25 years for the establishment of such a school, and finally the Northern State Normal School (now Northern Michigan University) was opened in 1899. Although White again declined to run for re- election, he did campaign for Democratic presidential nominee Samuel J. Tilden,Williams, page 189 ran unsuccessfully for Congress in 1882, and in 1884 campaigned for Grover Cleveland.Williams, page 195 Peter White the philanthropist (1880s‚Äì1908) Front Street entrance, 1904 Peter White Public Library White served as the Park and Cemetery Commissioner for Marquette for over forty years. In that capacity, he personally lobbied Congress to turn over Presque Isle, then reserved for a lighthouse, to the City of Marquette to turn into a public park.Williams, page 235 With that accomplished, he convinced the city council to accept the gift, and used his own fortune to improve the park and maintain it for five years. In 1893, White was appointed one of the commissioners of the 1893 World's Fair. At around the same time, he began serving as president of the Mackinac Island State Park Commission, a position he kept until his death.Williams, page 241 He provided the city of Marquette with a bronze statue of its namesake, Jacques Marquette, which was unveiled in 1897.Williams, page 236 In 1899, after many years of advocacy by White and others, the Northern State Normal School (now Northern Michigan University) was opened. White gave the school's art department; in 1902, the school built the Peter White Science Hall. One of White's most enduring philanthropies was the sponsorship of the Marquette public library.Williams, page 238 He began the library in 1872, constructing its first building and donating 10,000 books from his personal library to the city. Over time, the library grew, needing more space, and eventually White set aside space in his own bank building to house the library. Even that was not enough, and in 1904, White and other leading Marquette citizens erected the Peter White Public Library at a cost of $47,000. He was appointed a member of the State Board of Library Commissioners in 1903, a post he held until his death. The University of Michigan conferred an honorary Master of Arts degree on White in 1900.Williams, page 237 White endowed followships at the university in history and classical studies, and in 1903, he was elected to the Board of Regents of the University of Michigan, a position he held until his death. Peter White c. 1900 White's wife, Ellen, died in June 1905. On the morning of June 6, 1908, White complained of indigestion while visiting Detroit, and began a walk from City Hall back to the Ponchartrain Hotel. He fell on the street and died almost instantly. He was survived by one daughter and two grandchildren.

It produces more accurate results than traditional software sizing methodologiesCapers Jones (October 2009) \\"Software Engineering Best Practices\\": pages 318‚Äì320 , while requiring less configuration and knowledge from the end user, as most of the estimation is based on automatic measurements of an existing source code. As many ancestor measurement methods use source lines of code (SLOC) to measure software size, WMFP uses a parser to understand the source code breaking it down into micro functions and derive several code complexity and volume metrics, which are then dynamically interpolated into a final effort score. In addition to compatibility with the waterfall software development life cycle methodology, WMFP is also compatible with newer methodologies, such as Six Sigma, Boehm spiral, and Agile (AUP/Lean/XP/DSDM) methodologies, due to its differential analysis capability made possible by its higher-precision measurement elements.TickIT Quarterly publication (2009) \\"Quarter 1, 2009\\": page 13 Measured elements The WMFP measured elements are several different software metrics deduced from the source code by the WMFP algorithm analysis. They are represented as percentage of the whole unit (project or file) effort, and are translated into time. :Flow complexity (FC) ‚Äì Measures the complexity of a programs' flow control path in a similar way to the traditional cyclomatic complexity, with higher accuracy by using weights and relations calculation. :Object vocabulary (OV) ‚Äì Measures the quantity of unique information contained by the programs' source code, similar to the traditional Halstead vocabulary with dynamic language compensation. :Object conjuration (OC) ‚Äì Measures the quantity of usage done by information contained by the programs' source code. :Arithmetic intricacy (AI) ‚Äì Measures the complexity of arithmetic calculations across the program :Data transfer (DT) ‚Äì Measures the manipulation of data structures inside the program :Code structure (CS) ‚Äì Measures the amount of effort spent on the program structure such as separating code into classes and functions :Inline data (ID) ‚Äì Measures the amount of effort spent on the embedding hard coded data :Comments (CM) ‚Äì Measures the amount of effort spent on writing program comments Calculation The WMFP algorithm uses a three-stage process: function analysis, APPW transform, and result translation. A dynamic algorithm balances and sums the measured elements and produces a total effort score. The basic formula is: :‚àë(WiMi)‚àèDq :M = the source metrics value measured by the WMFP analysis stage :W = the adjusted weight assigned to metric M by the APPW model :N = the count of metric types :i = the current metric type index (iteration) :D = the cost drivers factor supplied by the user input :q = the current cost driver index (iteration) :K = the count of cost drivers This score is then transformed into time by applying a statistical model called average programmer profile weights (APPW) which is a proprietary successor to COCOMO II 2000 and COSYSMO. The resulting time in programmer work hours is then multiplied by a user defined cost per hour of an average programmer, to produce an average project cost, translated to the user currency. Downsides The basic elements of WMFP, when compared to traditional sizing models such as COCOMO, are more complex to a degree that they cannot realistically be evaluated by hand, even on smaller projects, and require a software to analyze the source code. As a result, it can only be used with analogy based cost predictions, and not theoretical educated guesses.

She was managing editor and one of the founders of Tehelka, an investigative public interest newsmagazine. She is currently director and co-founder of Algebra, an organisation that conducts public interviews with prominent Indians. Chaudhury recently started her news show on YouTube called ‚ÄòEnquiry With Shoma Chaudhury‚Äô. Biography Chaudhury was born and grew up in Darjeeling, where both her parents were doctors. She studied in St Helen‚Äôs Convent in Kurseong; La Martiniere School in Kolkata; and in Lady Shri Ram College, New Delhi. Views on Indian media Chaudhury has criticised the current state of the Indian media. Speaking on a panel on investigative journalism at the 16th World Editors Forum, she remarked on the state of journalism in India as \\"pathetic\\" as it had become \\"a corporate rather than a political act\\". She was critical of the \\"focus on advertisement revenue\\" rather than public interest, adding that \\"journalism has thus been undervalued, and this needs to change.Tehelka's Shoma Chaudhury on the 'pathetic' state of investigative journalism in India ‚Äì Editors Weblog On another occasion she was quoted as saying: > India's political, corporate and media establishment sounds like a mobile > cocktail party, gliding, champagne glasses in hand, in and out of each > others' drawing rooms, television studios, boardrooms and award ceremonies > like actors in an elaborate charade. She was critical of the nature of the recent Radia tapes controversy calling it a \\"mistake\\", noting that the tapes \\"end abruptly or seem to be missing bits of the conversations (which means)... Someone has carefully edited the tapes\\". She was also critical of the nature of the debate of the controversy that followed, observing that it had \\"distracted from the larger question of journalistic ethics... to.. just become a misogynistic, medieval witch hunt.\\" Awards In 2011, Newsweek (USA) picked Shoma Chaudhury as one of ‚Äú150 power women who shake the world‚Äù. The other Indian women on the list that year were Sonia Gandhi and Arundhati Roy. She has also been awarded the prestigious Sabbiadoro Ernest Hemingway Award for Political Journalism (2013), the Mumbai Press Club award for political journalism (2012), the Ramnath Goenka award and the Chameli Devi Jain Award for Outstanding Women Mediaperson (2009) for \\"going where angels fear to tread‚Äù. She was honoured by her alma mater Lady Shri Ram College, Delhi, with the alumni of the year award in 2013.  Algebra conversations  Algebra ‚Äì the Arts and Ideas Club was started by Chaudhury in September 2016. Since then, it has hosted myriad conversations presenting mainstream public figures in new light or highlighting counter-narratives. This includes grassroot social transformers, dispossessed voices whoa re often ignored by the mainstream media, including sewage workers, farmers, tribals, environmental activists and Muslims falsely accused of terror. Controversies In 2013, Shoma resigned from Tehelka following a controversy surrounding her handling of a sexual assault complaint by a colleague against Tehelka editor and founder, Tarun Tejpal. Chaudhury, who is a prominent voice on women issues, was criticised by the media and some colleagues for possibly underplaying the case at her own magazine.

The fire broke out at 5:30am Chile Daylight Time (8:30am GMT) on the fourth floor during a fight between rival gangs. An improvised flamethrower was reportedly used, setting mattresses and other flammable material alight. Those killed were trapped behind closed gates. Local firefighters took around three hours to bring the fire under control. At least 81 inmates were reported killed, and 14 suffered life-threatening burns, according to the Health Minister Jaime Ma√±alich. One firefighter and two prison guards also suffered lesser injuries. According to Chile's Fundacion Paz Ciudadana, the prison's capacity is 892, but was heavily overcrowded with 1,654 inmates. An investigation found out there was not a suitable emergency procedure in place. During the fire at a prison in Santiago, Chile, though the fire occurred at 5:30, the firefighters were not informed until 5:48 when they received an emergency call from inside the prison. Once they were notified, 60 inmates had to be evacuated immediately to ensure the firefighters could quickly be in control of the fire. The situation was difficult, since the prison held 1,900 prisoners, which is double the number that the prison was originally designed to hold. Chile‚Äôs prison system is more than seventy percent over its maximum capacity. The fire occurred on visiting day, so about 5,000 relatives were gathered outside when word of the deaths spread. When the prison police director began to read survivors‚Äô names over a megaphone, the relatives thought he was identifying the dead and some began to burst into tears or screaming, some fainting, and others throwing stones. Many family members waited for hours before receiving an update on their loved ones. Some visitors pressed their faces up against the fence and called out to inmates still inside. Some of the inmates managed to put their hands though the bars of their cell windows and waved T-shirts and bedsheets to show their relatives that they were still alive. Along with the 81 inmates injured, and the 14 that suffered from injuries, 11 prison guards and 1 firefighter were also injured as a result from this tragedy. Inside the prison there were only 6 guards, 26 of the guards remained outside. It was reported that many of the prison guards had prevented firefighters from entering the prison once they had arrived. The incident prompted Chile's president Sebasti√°n Pi√±era to launch an investigation and he called for an end to the overcrowding in the country's prison system, saying: \\"We cannot keep living with a prison system which is absolutely inhumane. We are going to speed up the process to ensure our country has a humane, dignified prison system that befits a civilised country.\\" See also *Comayagua prison fire References Category:2010 in Chile Category:2010 fires Category:Fires in Chile Category:Arson in South America Category:Mass murder in 2010 Category:History of Santiago, Chile Category:Prisons in Chile Category:December 2010 events in South America Category:2010s in Santiago, Chile Category:Residential building fires ","title":"2010 Santiago prison fire"},{"id":"29965493","text":"The Dangerous Game (Norwegian:Den farlige liken) is a 1942 Norwegian comedy film directed by Tancred Ibsen, starring Lauritz Falk, Nanna Stenersen and Per Aabel.

(1997) and in Forsythia suspensa. It is also found in the caterpillar of the cabbage butterfly, Pieris rapae where it serves as a defence against ants. In food, it is found in sesame seed, in Brassica vegetables and in olive oil.  Biosynthesis  A first dirigent protein was discovered in Forsythia intermedia. This protein has been found to direct the stereoselective biosynthesis of (+)-pinoresinol from coniferyl alcohol monomers. Recently, a second, enantiocomplementary dirigent protein was identified in Arabidopsis thaliana, which directs enantioselective synthesis of (-)-pinoresinol. Reaction of monolignol radicals in the presence of dirigent protein to form (+)-pinoresinol In the presence of dirigent protein from Forsythia intermedia, production of (+)-pinoresinol is greatly enriched while production of other products of dimerization is inhibited. Pharmacology Pinoresinol inhibits the enzyme Œ±-glucosidase in vitro and may therefore act as a hypoglycemic agent. A study involving extra virgin olive oil showed that pinoresinol possess in vitro chemoprevention properties. Increased apoptosis and cellular arrest at the G2/M stage in p53-proficient cells occurred. Metabolism into enterolignans Pinoresinol, along with other plant lignans, are converted into enterolignans by intestinal microflora in the human body.

It was originally executed for the Franciscan hermitage of Valle Romita near Gentile's birthplace, Fabriano. History There is no information about the Valle Romita Polyptych's origins; however, it may have been commissioned by the lord of Fabriano, Chiavello Chiavelli, when in 1406 he had the local convent restored to house his future tomb. The painting would thus date from 1406 to 1414, when Gentile left the Marche and moved to Brescia under Pandolfo III Malatesta. The presence of elements of the International Gothic style, in particular as practiced by Michelino da Besozzo (such as the accurate rendering of natural details) has led some to narrow the dates to 1410-1412, when the two artists met in Venice. The polyptych was disassembled as early as the 18th century. In 1811 the Pinacoteca di Brera acquired the central panel and the lower ones from the hermitage, which had been suppressed. The upper panels were bought from a private collection in 1901. The neo-Gothic frame dates to 1925. Detail of the lawn. Description The polyptych measures 280 x 250 cm, the panels measuring 157.20x79.6 (central one), 117.50x40 (side lower panels) and 48.9x37.8 (upper panels). Saint John Praying in the Desert. The central panel depicts the Incoronation of the Virgin and, in the lower part, a Trinity and a choir of musician angels. This scene was inspired to the Byzantine mosaics that Gentile had seen at Venice in St. Mark's Basilica, as shown by the figures floating in the air and the shining gold background. The latter is very finely worked. Jesus' garment is drawn over a silver sheet. The four side panels show figures of saints: from the left are Saint Jerome, with a model of the church in his hands, Saint Francis of Assisi, Saint Dominic and Mary Magdalene. The figures are located in a garden whose botanic species are painted in deep detail. Details include the ampulla (not painted, but engraved in gold) held by Mary Magdalene in her fingers' tips: later, influenced by Masaccio's realism, Gentile would paint the same subject as firmly hold in Mary's hands in the Quaratesi Polyptych. The smaller panels in the upper cusps depict Saint John the Baptist Praying in the Desert, the Martyrdom of Saint Peter of Verona, a Franciscan Saint Reading and Saint Francis Receiving the Stigmata. The scenes include further examples of Gentile's attention to details, such as the quasi-pointillism technique used to render the wool of the figure in Peter's scene, or the fine hair of Saint John's cloth. It is likely that the central cusp originally housed a panel with the Crucifizion, housed in the Pinacoteca's same room. Other small panels with saints, divided among several collections, have been also thought to be once in the side piers of the polyptych, now lost.

Biography Guillaume Thomas Rapha√´l Taraval was born in France, the son of Fran√ßois Taraval and Chatherine Masson. He became orphaned early in life and was raised by his foster-father Henry Guillemard (1665-1728) who also gave him the first lessons in painting and drawing. He continued his education with the artist Claude Audran (1658‚Äì1734). Together with other French artists, Taraval arrived in Stockholm in 1732. Taraval was mainly active in the Stockholm Palace. He produced a series of elegant ceiling paintings and introduced the Rococo decorative style to Sweden. He also painted portraits, altarpieces and still lives, and prepared sketches for a chandelier in the chapel, which was then completed by his disciple Johan Pasch. He also played a major part in the Royal Swedish Academy of Arts, becoming its first director on its foundation in 1735. In 1739, he was granted leave to travel to Paris to study the new latest developments in French art, returning to Sweden in 1740. He died during 1750 in Stockholm. Personal life In 1727 married his foster-father's daughter Marie-Anne Fran√ßois Guillemard (b. ca 1705). He had two sons, the French painter Hugues Taraval (1729-1785) and the French architect and engraver Louis Gustave Taraval (1738-1794). The latter's son, Jean-Gustave Taraval (1765-1784) was also a French painter.

These parks were White Cross Bay, Limefitt, Fallbarrow, Todber, Ocean Edge, Regent, Gatebeck, Marina, and Hawthorne. South Lakeland Parks specialised in developing and operating holiday parks with caravans and timber lodge accommodation. The parks included holiday home hire and holiday home sales, while the Fallbarrow site had two holiday cottages on site. In 2013 management of the sites was taken over by Park Resorts.  History  The company was established in 1988 as South Lakeland Caravans. The parks promoted three different styles of holiday - lakeside (parks based in the Lake District), countryside (parks based in the Troutbeck Valley) and seaside (parks based in the Morecambe Bay areas). In June 2006, LGV acquired South Lakeland Caravans Limited, which was rebranded as South Lakeland Parks.http://www.lgvcapital.com/portfolio/south-lakeland- parks.html South Lakeland Parks predominantly operated the owner-occupier model, generating most of its revenue from the sale of caravans and lodges and was one of the country's leading providers of timber-lodge units, a market which demonstrated high growth in the 2000s. LGV had a strong management team led by CEO, Graham Hodgson and LGV supplemented the team with the appointments of a Finance Director and Martin Leppard as Non-Executive Chairman. After LGV took over the group, South Lakeland Parks embarked on a ¬£3 million investment programme to upgrade the quality of the parks. Improvements across the nine parks included new timber lodge developments, new internet caf√© facilities, an indoor swimming pool and better facilities for disabled guests. In November 2007, LGV successfully sold South Lakeland to White Ocean Leisure for ¬£125 million, generating a return of more than twice its money in 17 months. White Ocean Leisure sold South Lakeland Parks to Electra Partners for ¬£47 million in 2013. Electra Partners merged the business into its existing holiday park company, Park Resorts.  Locations  South Lakeland Parks consisted of nine different locations across the Lake District and Morecambe Bay area. These parks included White Cross Bay and Fallbarrow in lakeside locations, both overlooking Lake Windermere; Limefitt, Gatebeck and Todber in countryside locations, and Regent, Ocean Edge, Marina and Hawthorne in seaside locations. In 2011 Fallbarrow opened 'The Lakeside', its latest lodge development,Fallbarrow Lakeside consisting of 25 high specification luxury lodges, with many benefiting from beautiful views of Windermere.  Conservation  South Lakeland Parks was a member of Nurture Lakeland, a Cumbrian conservation charity, raising money for local conservation work and improving its own environmental practices. South Lakeland Parks worked with Nurture Lakeland to raise ¬£50,000 for the ‚ÄòMiles without Stiles‚Äô project which aimed to provide 39 accessible walking routes.

Metodology of work  The system provides each team with 12 officers, divided into three shifts of eight hours. The team is composed by three policemen in each eight-hour shift, two of them traveling in a Hilux SW4 SUV and a motorcycle rider giving support. The SUV and the motorcycle move together during the day. Overnight, the component of the motorcycle adds to the team that travels in the Hilux. The car's patrolling area is limited to a perimeter of 1.5 km to 3 km square. This small perimeter coverage for each team is to allow a response time of no more than 5 minutes. As the vehicles are equipped with GPS, they are restricted to that area delimited by the operational command, an \\"electronic fence\\" to register the car out of its perimeter.

It can be accessed from 4350 Riverview Drive, or 4307 Briggs Street. It was the first kiln-fired brick building built in Riverside County, and is the oldest non-adobe structure in the Inland Empire. History The Danish sea captain Cornelius Jensen settled in Agua Mansa around 1854 where he ran a store, and he married Californio Mercedes Alvarado soon thereafter. After the Great Flood of 1862, most of the town was destroyed with the exception of the cemetery, the chapel, and Jensen's store. Some years later, Jensen bought a part of the Rubidoux ranch. Jensen and Alvarado bought land in Agua Mansa in 1865. They built their Danish vernacular style home between 1868 and 1870 on a ranch of . Jensen built his home on this land using traditional bricks, having learned from the 1862 flood that adobe bricks dissolve in water. Their home, which served as the area's general store, post office, and stage stop, was built next to the town's chapel. The ranch, valued at one time at approximately $30,000, was the second-most valuable in Riverside County. Architecture The home's architectural style, Danish vernacular, reflected Jensen's Sylt birthplace, while also incorporating a front porch, which reflected Mercedes' influence as a Californio. The house was the first kiln-fired brick building in the county. It was also one of California's first clay brick buildings, and it used clay found on the ranch itself. The rock foundation and the lime used in the mortar were from a Jensen's quarry north of the house. The wood for the house beams came from the San Bernardino Mountains. The house has high ceilings, but only one closet. There are several other brick buildings on the ranch, including a winery, which now serves as a museum. Agriculture In addition to apricot and orange orchards, growing wheat, and raising sheep on the Agua Mansa ranch, the Jensens had another in Temecula. While Riverside was a temperance city, the Jensen's Agua Mansa ranch, on the other side of the Santa Ana River, had a vineyard; of wine were produced and sold each year. Landmark The ranch and home are part of the Jensen Alvarado Ranch Historic Park and Museum, an 1880s living history interpretive museum administered by Riverside County Parks. Tourists are led by interpreters, dressed in period clothing, who demonstrate butter churning and cooking tortillas. The property is a registered California Historical Landmark (Cornelius and Mercedes Jensen Ranch, No. 943) and was listed on the National Register of Historic Places on September 6, 1979. It is notable for the architecture, and agricultural development of the time, as well as Jensen's settlement here, and his career in government.

This species is part of the genus Xanthium that encompasses 25 different species of flowering plants of the daisy family, Asteraceae, and sunflower tribe. Distribution It is known worldwide as a noxious weed that grows in many types of disturbed habitats such as pastures, crops, waterways, grasslands, flood plains, waste areas, and sometimes tropical and arid environments. Its original native range is not known but it may have come from South America,Flora of North America possibly from Chile.Washington State Noxious Weed Control Board The plant is found in various regions across the world including Canada, the US, Central America, parts of Africa and the Middle East, China, Russia and Australia. Description Burs of Xanthium spinosum Xanthium spinosum is an upright, highly branched, dichotomous, annual herb producing a slender stem up to tall or slightly taller. It is lined at intervals with very long, sharp, yellowish, three pronged spines which may exceed three centimeters in length. These spines are typically found at the base of each leaf fork. The leaves are irregularly lobed or lance-shaped lobed, the middle is much longer than the others, and have white veins down the center. They are arranged spirally or alternately along the stem. Each is up to 10 or 12 centimeters long and are dark green or grayish on top, pale green or whitish underneath and are covered in downy hairs. Xanthium spinosum flowers between summer and late fall, typically from July to October in the northern hemisphere. The plant produces male and female flower heads that are monoecious and form greenish axillary or solitary inflorescence clusters. The male flowers are bulbous and found in dense clusters at the tips of stems near the topmost leaves. Female flowers are found at the leaf forks on lower leaves and develop into burs. The burs are one or 1.5 centimeters long and covered in small hook-like spines. Each bur has two seeds inside it that are flattened and have a thick coat. The spiny burs are easily dispersed to new areas when they become attached to animals, people, and objects, or float on water. Xanthium spinosum plant with lobed leaves and white stripe down the middle  Uses  Xanthium spinosum, as well as others within the genus, are used in many traditional medicinal treatments. The chloroform extracts found in the plant are used to treat numerous ailments such as hydrophobia, rabies, fevers, diarrhea, and cancer. In Chinese medicinal practices, the methanol extracts found in the leaves and fruits are used to treat inflammatory diseases such as rheumatoid arthritis. This species can also be toxic to humans, as it produces toxins that cause nephrotoxic effects, causing damage to the kidneys.  Agricultural & Ecological Effects  Xanthium spinosum is classified as an invasive weed of many crops. This plant negatively impacts crops such as: cotton, maize, sunflowers, tomatoes, soybeans, sugarcane, and other annual or perennial crops. It decreases the health of the ecosystem it takes over and threatens the loss of the native species that inhabit the area as well as lowers the biodiversity. It also threatens the health and well being of the animals that inhabit the areas where it is found. If livestock ingests Xanthium spinosum, the livestock will become poisoned and could potentially make its way into a human. The plants, especially new seedlings, are toxic to livestock. This plant is also toxic to humans. Bur damage to sheep's wool reduces its value.

This technology can also be used in buses and trucks. The technology was developed by KPIT Technologies and the product will be manufactured through a joint venture between Bharat Forge and KPIT. As part of the joint venture, KPIT will license the hybrid technology while Bharat Forge will provide manufacturing, assembly, and integration. Pre-compliance tests conducted at the Automotive research Association of India (ARAI), Pune have confirmed that the technology provides fuel efficiency improvements by over 40 percent and reduction in green house gas (GHG) emissions by over 30%. The technology is to be marketed to OEMs and individual vehicle owners through a network of dealerships. Background Planning and concept The idea of Revolo first occurred to Tejas Kshatriya in 2008 when he was stuck in Mumbai traffic en route to Pune. KPIT sanctioned a team of four engineers for the project, which was kept separate from CREST, the research and development center at KPIT. It took 2 years of research and a budget under US$2 million to evolve the idea through trial and error and several failures, including the inability of the system to withstand sudden surge in power when brakes were applied. The research and development team studied the firing pattern of internal combustion engines and identified the weak spots that lead to fuel waste and created a technology that can convert a passenger car to a hybrid that is environmentally friendly, cheap, fuel-efficient and at the same time offers good performance. Revolo is designed to work in typical stop-and-go city traffic and allows cars to cruise at about 30 km/h in the third gear without straining the engine. Latest developments KPIT continues the road tests of pilot vehicles as well as consumer trials with results so far having validated the pre-announced performance results. The team has further reduced the overall weight of the solution, improved on the durability and standardized many components across multiple vehicle platforms. Construction at the assembly and manufacturing plants continues. It is expected to be operational by March 2014. The company will test various vehicles, including passenger cars, with engines sizes between 800 cc and 2,500 cc. Production of limited hybrid kits is planned to start by first half of 2012. The commercial production would begin in 2012‚Äì13. Technology Revolo technology details The Revolo kit is similar to a retrofit compressed natural gas (CNG) kit which contains all required mechanical and electrical components in the package. The kit can be installed in both petrol and diesel vehicles within 4‚Äì6 hours by trained technicians who will be trained by a joint venture that KPIT has formed with Bharat Forge. The Revolo kit comprises a 7.5 to 10 horsepower electric motor developed and patented by KPIT, an electronic motor controller, lead‚Äìacid battery pack, mechanical assembly and coupling, proprietary software for control algorithms of the motor and batteries, and battery management system. As a parallel hybrid the motor and engine will work simultaneously and as a plug-in, the vehicle can be charged through a standard external electricity source such as a domestic power outlet. Unlike an electric vehicle, the vehicle will operate as a conventional fuel vehicle even if the batteries are completely drained. Plug-in parallel hybrid conversion kit The conversion kit is a lot less complex and light in weight in context of the moving engine components which effectively enhances the fuel efficiency to twice as compared to existing solutions. Battery specifications: The solution is battery agnostic. It can be adopted to work with various types of batteries such as lead‚Äìacid batteries or Lithium-ion batteries. The solution typically produces 60 volts from five valve-regulated, lead‚Äìacid batteries, and can be recharged from the standard Indian household current of 230 volts in 4 to 6 hours. Revolo also consists of an in-built device that recognizes driving patterns and self-adjusts to provide optimum efficiency in stop-and-go traffic situations. Pricing Revolo is said to be 80 percent cheaper as compared to the after-market hybrid car kits available in the United States which cost around US$20,000. It can be retrofitted into any vehicle at an average cost of Rs. 100,000.

Life  She was born in North Erpingham, Norfolk, England, to parents Martin Bernye (Barney), Esquire of Gunton, Norfolk, and Margaret Flint. She was the fifth child in the family, with a younger sister Margaret. Elizabeth's father, a prominent lawyer, was the owner of a large amount of land in Gunton, Norfolk, including Gunton Hall and St. Andrew's Church in Gunton., 1. Hughey, Ruth, and Philip Hereford (1934). \\"Elizabeth Grymeston and her Miscellanea\\". Oxford Journals. 4(XV), p. 61-89. She married Christopher, the youngest son of Thomas Grimston of Grimston, Yorkshire. Her married life appears to have been rendered miserable by the cruelty of her mother, whereby she became a chronic invalid. Reduced, as she described it, to the condition of 'a dead woman among the living,' she 'resolved to break the barren soil of her fruitless brain,' and devoted herself to the compilation of a moral guide-book for the benefit of her son Bernye Grymeston, the only survivor of her nine children. She died in 1603 before the publication of her work, which appeared under the title of 'Miscelanea : Meditations : Memoratives,' by Elizabeth Grymeston, London, 1604, 4to.  Marriage  In 1584, when Elizabeth was about 21, she married Christopher Grymeston, son of Thomas Grymeston and Dorothy Thwaytes of Smeeton, Yorkshire. Elizabeth and Christopher's marriage was a struggling one that seemed to be subject to much scandal. On 17 December 1578, at the age of fourteen, Christopher Grymeston had been admitted as a pensioner to the Bachelor's table at Caius College in Cambridge. Christopher received his Bachelor's in 1582‚Äì83, and was admitted as a fellow-commoner in 1584 at the school. After he received his masters in 1586, he became a fellow of the college (1587‚Äì92), and held the office of bursar in 1588. While Christopher was clearly very successful at the college, his role paid a toll on his marriage to Elizabeth. Fellows at Caius were not allowed to maintain their fellowships after marriage. Residence at the college was required of all fellows, especially for the office of bursar. Christopher's upholding of these requirements and his prolonged place as a fellow at the school implies that his marriage to Elizabeth was kept a secret for almost ten years. Difficulties within the marriage, as well as the fact that their entire relationship was kept a secret from the school, may have led to Christopher's severing ties with Caius in 1592. On 21 January 1592, Christopher joined Gray's Inn, one of the four Inns of Court in London, to practice as a barrister. The couple's hidden relationship was not the only scandal that Elizabeth and Christopher struggled with during their marriage. In the book written for her son, Elizabeth revealed that she suffered under her mother's wrath and feared for her husband's life, stating that Christopher had been threatened with numerous attempts of violence. The sole purpose of Elizabeth's book was to advise her son, should she die before she could teach him how to live as a proper, pious man. Margaret Flint's hostility toward her daughter resulted from a dispute over Martin Bernye's will. Under normal circumstances, Bernye's numerous estates would pass to Elizabeth's eldest brother Marmaduke. Bernye, however, ultimately changed his will, making Elizabeth and Christopher the ultimate heirs to the Bernye lands, which included Gunton Hall, Netherhall, and various pieces of land in Gunton, as well as Thorpe Market, Suffield, Antingham, Hanworth Abbey, and Bradfield. This greatly angered Elizabeth's mother, who was completely removed from any rights to the wealth and power. Ultimately, however, it was Margaret Flint who prospered; she outlived her daughter and all the property was placed in her name. Elizabeth and Christopher Grymeston's religious beliefs were also a cause of strife and tension within the family, and may also have been the cause for disputes with her mother. Both Elizabeth and her husband were labelled as recusants ‚Äî those who chose Catholic leanings over the Church of England. In her book, Elizabeth uses a decidedly Catholic- inspired curriculum for her son to learn from; many of the poems and teachings that inspired her work came from the Catholic tradition. Historians have also found evidence that Elizabeth's kinsman, Robert Southwell, S.J., was hanged, drawn, and quartered at Tyburn for his Catholic beliefs in 1594. Elizabeth was most likely in London at this time, as Christopher had just begun his time at Gray's Inn; she quotes him many times throughout her book, and it is clear that his Catholic sympathies were used as inspiration for her writings. Throughout her work, Elizabeth also frequently quoted a contemporary Catholic poet, Richard Rowlands (Verstegan), who fled from the continent as a recusant. Her clearly Catholic leanings became a main issue in the book for her son, and would most likely have been a point of conflict between the author and her socially prominent mother, who held the state religion. Christopher may also have been a practising Catholic. In the book, Elizabeth references her fear for her husband's life, and the attempts that have made to harm him. This also may have led to conflict with Caius, which led to his departure from the school.  Work  Elizabeth Grymeston's only work, Miscellanea. Meditations. Memoratives, was released posthumously in 1604, to much popularity, enough so that four editions of the book were published in the span of fourteen years. The first edition of the book held fourteen chapters, while the last three included an additional six essays. Miscellanea was written as an address to Elizabeth's only living son Bernye as a form of guidance, should she be dead before she had time to raise him. Elizabeth drew on her sense of maternal solitude to address both her son and her readers with \\"directness and simplicity [with] her frequent use of arresting, concrete images, and her ability to assimilate and even to alter quotations from many sources for her own purposes\\".Travitsky, Betty. The Paradise of Women: Writings by Englishwomen of the Renaissance. New York: Columbia University Press, 1981. P. 51-55. The book is divided into fourteen so-called chapters, most of which are brief essays on religious topics. The eleventh chapter is headed 'Morning Meditation, with sixteen sobs of a sorrowful spirit, which she used for a mentall prayer, as also an addition of sixteen staves taken out of \\"Peter's Complaint\\" (Southwell's), which she usually played on the winde instrument,' and the twelfth is 'a Madrigall made by Bernye Grymestone upon the conceit of his mother's play to the former ditties.' The thirteenth chapter consists of 'Odes in imitation of the seven p≈ìnitentiall psalms in seven severall kindes of verse.' The 'Memoratives' are a number of moral maxims, which, if not original, are at least pointed and well chosen. The dedication, addressed to the author's son, is a quaint piece of composition, containing good advice for moral guidance and on the choice of a wife; it is reprinted in W. C. Hazlitt's 'Prefaces, Dedications, and Epistles,' 1874. Two later and undated editions of the 'Miscelanea' were published, enlarged by the addition of six other short essays. One of the many noticeable features of Elizabeth's writing was her use of quotations and concepts from fellow writers, both past and contemporary. While many of her sources were widely recognised, at many points throughout her advice book she failed to reference who she is quoting or borrowing from. In many passages, she paraphrased ideas to suit her own needs, making other's work her own. Numerous sections of her essays contain poetry, and while some scholars call her a poetess, none of the verses were her own. While she combined many poems, and altered lines and stanzas, she always conserved the overall meaning of the work. One of the main sources of Elizabeth's passages was England's Parnassus, which many quotes and ideas had been derived from. Grymeston's method of borrowing others' work and making it her own not only made her work more successful and convincing, but also proved her high level of education. Her knowledge of the Bible, as well as Latin, Italian, and Greek become quite clear as readers encounter the numerous quotes and passages she derives from various works she would have been familiar with during her time. \\"Parallel sentiment\\" in the two parts of her book, as well as continued proof of knowledge and familiarity with religion, are evidence that Elizabeth wrote the book in its entirety herself.  Death  Little is known about the death of Elizabeth Grymeston. There are no death records or cause of death for Elizabeth, but she was not alive when her book was published in 1604; she most likely died in 1602‚Äì1603. Scholars propose that the editor of the first two editions of her work was Christopher, as the second edition has an authentic coat of arms, implying that a member of her family was closely involved with and authorised its publication.

It runs from Nuremberg via Lauf an der Pegnitz, Hersbruck, Pegnitz, Kirchenlaibach, Marktredwitz and Schirnding to Cheb in the Czech Republic. The route is also known as the Right (bank of the) Pegnitz line ( or the Pegnitz Valley Railway (Pegnitztalbahn). It was built as the Fichtel Range Railway (Fichtelgebirgsbahn).Landesamt f√ºr Denkmalpflege The Nuremberg‚ÄìSchnabelwaid section of it is part of the Saxon-Franconian trunk line (Sachsen-Franken-Magistrale). History  The line was originally intended to provide a direct link between Nuremberg and Bayreuth, adding to the Bayreuth‚ÄìNeuenmarkt-Wirsberg branch line opened in 1853 from the Bamberg‚ÄìHof section of the Ludwig South-North Railway. Since the route via Bamberg was not a satisfactory solution, planning began on a direct connection to Nuremberg. Several variants were considered, running via: Forchheim‚ÄìEbermannstadt, Gr√§fenberg‚ÄìPegnitz, Schnaittach‚ÄìBetzenstein and Neuhaus‚ÄìPegnitz, with the last selected. A direct connection from Nuremberg to Bohemia was developed in three stages from Schnabelwaid to Cheb (then a mainly German-speaking city in the Austrian Empire, called Eger). First, a year after the opening of the Bayreuth route on 15 May 1878, the section was opened from Schnabelwaid via Kirchenlaibach and Laibach to Marktredwitz. The next section from Marktredwitz to Schirnding followed on 20 November 1879 and the gap from Schirnding to Cheb was closed on 1 November 1883. The originally single-track line was duplicated in 1898 and 1899 between Nuremberg and Marktredwitz, with traffic cleared to use both tracks in 1901. Opening dates  *Nuremberg‚ÄìSchnabelwaid: 15 July 1877 *Schnabelwaid‚ÄìMarktredwitz: 15 May 1878 *Marktredwitz‚ÄìSchirnding: 20 November 1879 *Schirnding‚ÄìCheb: 1 November 1883 Line In the Nuremberg area, the line is called the Right Pegnitz line (rechte Pegnitzstrecke) is used to distinguish it from the Nuremberg‚ÄìSchwandorf line, which is known as the Left Pegnitz line (linke Pegnitzstrecke), since both lines run parallel with each other between Nuremberg and Hersbruck and on each side of the Pegnitz river. The section of the line that runs from Nuremberg to Pegnitz along the course of the Pegnitz River, with many crossings of it between Hohenstadt and Pegnitz is known as the Pegnitz Valley Railway (Pegnitztalbahn). The entire construction project was known as the Fichtel Range Railway (Fichtelgebirgsbahn) as the central section of the line passes through the Fichtel mountains (Fichtelgebirge). Route  The line leaves the Nuremberg station to the east, turns to the left after D√ºrrenhof S-Bahn station and passes under the lines to Regensburg and to Schwandorf. After crossing the W√∂hrder See (lake) the line runs through the southern part of the Nuremberg suburbs of St. Jobst and Erlenstegen, continuing between the Sebald Reichwald (forest) and the Pegnitz through Behringersdorf and R√ºckersdorf. On the eastern edge of Lauf the line crosses the A 9 to reach Neunkirchen station where the Schnaittach Valley Railway (Schnaittachtalbahn) branches off to Simmelsdorf-H√ºttenbach and runs through Reichenschwand to Hersbruck. Before Hohenstadt the line turns to the left and continues to follow the Pegnitz through Franconian Switzerland and Veldensteiner Forst national park to Pegnitz. In this section, the line crosses the Pegnitz 25 times and runs between Vorra and Neuhaus through a 7 km section with seven tunnels. After Pegnitz station the line runs next to federal highway B 2 and B 85 to Schnabelwaid station, where the line to Bayreuth branches off. The line runs to the east to Kirchenlaibach, where it meets the Weiden‚ÄìBayreuth line. This once important railway junction, which included a rail workshop, is now reduced to a six-track through station with a large area of gravel to its south, which once had rail installations. After the station, the line turns northeast and runs from now on along the southern edge of the Fichtelgebirge. In Lenau the line turns to the right to run around a spur of the Fichtelgebirge, and then runs through Armannsberg tunnel under the village of Oberwappen√∂st and continues to Neusorg station where until 1984 the branch line to Fichtelberg branched off. Then the line runs further to the northwest through the Langentheilener Tunnel, where it crosses the Danube-Main watershed, and continues to Waldershof and Marktredwitz. The route leaves Marktredwitz station to the northeast, crossing under highway B 93 and then runs to the Czech border next to highway B 303. It runs north of Seussen along the R√∂slau river near the Kohlberg and Lindenberg mountains to Arzberg. After the line passes through the border station of Schirnding, it continues to the east to Cheb, connecting with the line from the south, originating in Plze≈à and then runs around the edge of the inner city to Cheb station. Line engineering  three track section at Hersbruck The line is a double track from Nuremberg to Marktredwitz and a single track from Marktredwitz to Cheb and is not electrified for its whole length. The line has three tracks from the 27.7 km mark (Hersbruck (rechts Pegnitz) station) to the 29.5 km mark, where the Hersbruck‚ÄìPommelsbrunn line branches off. This section has bi- directional signalling. In addition, bi-directional signaling is installed between R√ºckersdorf and Neunkirchen am Sand and between Vorra and Neuhaus. 612 (RegioSwinger) diesel tilting trains are used on the winding line, operating at a maximum speed of 160 km/h. Transport authority  The Nuremberg‚ÄìHaidenaab-G√∂ppmannsb√ºhl section is integrated in the Greater Nuremberg Transport Association (Verkehrsverbund Gro√üraum N√ºrnberg, VGN) and served by R3 and R33 trains. Services  Class 612, running as the Franken- Sachsen-Express to Dresden near Velden Since the timetable change on 10 December 2006, the Franken-Sachsen-Express Interregio-Express service operates on the line, using class 612 diesel multiple units (DMUs), from Nuremberg via Bayreuth or Marktredwitz to Hof, continuing via Chemnitz to Dresden, replacing an InterCity service. This connection was discontinued at the timetable change in December 2014. Thus, the Nuremberg‚ÄìDresden route is now divided at Hof and since then Regional-Express services (RE) run from Nuremberg to Hof and from Hof to Dresden, requiring a change in Hof. In addition, Regional-Express services run on the Nuremberg‚ÄìPegnitz‚ÄìBayreuth / Marktredwitz‚ÄìHof / Cheb routes with class 612 DMUs. The various Regional-Express services are operated with train portions separating or merging at Hersbruck and Pegnitz stations. Since 9 December 2012, there have been no long-distance passenger services on the route. DB Regio Mittelfranken has operated Regionalbahn services on the Nuremberg‚ÄìNeunkirchen‚ÄìNeuhaus route since the timetable change on 14 December 2008 under the brand name of Mittelfrankenbahn, using class 648 DMUs. Before the timetable change, class 614 DMUs or class 218 diesel locomotives with n-coach sets were used. Vogtlandbahn operates regionalbahn services from Marktredwitz to Cheb using Siemens Desiro DMUs. Voith Maxima 30 CC in Hersbruck running to Pegnitz Future  Electrification  The track is listed in the Federal Transport Infrastructure Plan as Project No. 16 (Nuremberg‚ÄìMarktredwitz‚ÄìReichenbach/German Czech border) to be electrified by 2018. The cost of the project to the German government is estimated at ‚Ç¨467 million. Electrification is particularly difficult in the tunnels between Vorra and Neuhaus. The railway line would have to be closed for several months, moreover several bridges would have to be renewed.

There are six generally recognized hydrological continental divides which divide the continent into seven principal drainage basins spanning three oceans (Arctic, Atlantic and Pacific) and one endorheic basin. The basins are the Atlantic Seaboard basin, the Gulf of Mexico basin, the Great Lakes-St. Lawrence basin, the Pacific basin, the Arctic basin, the Hudson Bay basin, and the Great Basin. Together, the principal basins span the continent with the exception of numerous smaller endorheic basins. The Atlantic Seaboard basin in eastern North America drains to the Atlantic Ocean; the Great Lakes-St. Lawrence basin in central and eastern North America drains to the Gulf of St. Lawrence on the Atlantic Ocean or to the Labrador Sea; the Gulf of Mexico basin in the southern United States drains to the Gulf of Mexico, a basin of the Atlantic Ocean; the Pacific basin in western North America drains to the Pacific Ocean or the Gulf of California on the Pacific Ocean; the Arctic basin in northwestern North America drains to the Beaufort Sea of the Arctic Ocean or directly to the Arctic Ocean; the Hudson Bay basin in central northern North America drains to Hudson Bay on the Labrador Sea (which may be considered part of either the Arctic Ocean or Atlantic Ocean), or to the Arctic Sea via Foxe Basin and Fury and Hecla Strait; the Great Basin in western United States is an endorheic basin which does not drain to any ocean. The Atlantic Seaboard basin is bounded by the Atlantic Ocean to the east, the Eastern Continental Divide to the west, the Great Lakes-St. Lawrence Divide to the north, and the Lake Okeechobee endorheic basin to the south. The Gulf of Mexico basin is bounded by the Gulf of Mexico to the south, the Eastern Continental Divide to the east, the Great Lakes-St. Lawrence Divide to the northeast, the Laurentian Divide to the North, and the Continental Divide to the west. The Pacific Basin is bounded by the Continental divide to the east and Pacific Ocean to the west; the basin excludes the endorheic Great Basin in the west. The Great Basin has a closed loop boundary encompassing substantially all of Nevada, the western half of Utah and parts of Oregon, California, Idaho, and Wyoming. Endorheic basins Most lakes are actually endorheic, but endorheic basins may not have standing water, or have water only seasonally. The most significant endorheic basins are these: *Great Basin covering most of Nevada, the western part of Utah, and smaller amounts of other U.S. states *Great Divide Basin on the Continental Divide in Wyoming *Guzm√°n Basin *Badwater Basin, Death Valley, California (no standing water) *Bols√≥n de Mapim√≠ *Llanos el Salado Boundary landforms The western boundary (Eastern Continental Divide) of the Atlantic Seaboard basin and western boundary of the Gulf of Mexico basin is formed by the Appalachian Mountains to the North, the Piedmont Plateau and lowland ridges of the Atlantic Coastal plain to the south.

Now a ghost town, only the cemetery remains, it once was the largest settlement in San Bernardino County. The town was established in 1845 in Mexican Alta California. It was on the Santa Ana River, across from the Mexican era settlement of La Placita. Agua Mansa and La Placita were the first non-native settlements in the San Bernardino Valley. Together known as \\"San Salvador\\", they were also the largest settlements between Santa Fe de Nuevo M√©xico and the Pueblo de Los √Ångeles in the 1840s. Geography The Agua Mansa Valley is located on the south side of Slover Mountain. The valley was in length; its width varied between and , the variance depending on the river that flowed through the valley. The area was used as farmland, divided into at least one hundred fields, owned by separate farmers. The valley's lower end included a Fr√©mont's cottonwoods (Populus fremontii) riparian forest owned by Rubidoux, while the upper end was a sandy plain that extended to the borders of present- day San Bernardino. History In 1845, Don Juan Bandini donated parts of his land grant Rancho Jurupa to a group of Mexican colonists from Abiqui√∫ in Santa Fe de Nuevo M√©xico ‚Äî on the condition that they would assist in protecting his stock from local Indian raids. Ten of these families moved to on the \\"Bandini Donation\\" on the east side of the Santa Ana River, forming the village of La Placita, while a second group colonized the west side of the river, forming the town of Agua Mansa. The group that formed Agua Mansa was led by Don Jose Tomas Salajar, and included Cristobal Slover and Louis Rubidoux. After the adobe church built in La Placita in 1852 collapsed in quicksand, a new church was built in Agua Mansa. Completed in 1853 and dedicated to San Salvador, the church survived through the Great Flood of 1862. The parish, which included Agua Mansa and La Placita, became known as San Salvador de Jurupa, and was the first non-mission parish in Southern California. The chapel's bell now hangs at the Glenwood Mission Inn. The town prospered for almost 20 years until the 1862 flooding swept away many of the adobe buildings, leaving the area strewn with sand and gravel. Though the town was rebuilt on higher ground, its prosperity did not return. Built in 1870 in Agua Mansa, the Jensen Alvarado Ranch is a California Historical Landmark and is listed on the National Register of Historical Places. Its vineyard produced and sold thousands of gallons of wine each year. Agua Mansa Pioneer Cemetery A grave marker at the Agua Mansa cemetery. Agua Mansa is designated California Historical Landmark (No. 121). The marker is located at Agua Mansa Pioneer Cemetery, the only site that remains of the once flourishing town. The first burial occurred in 1852, and the last occurred 111 years later in 1963. In 1955, a descendant of the original Agua Mansa families established \\"Friends for the Preservation of the Agua Mansa Pioneer Cemetery\\" and the volunteers of this group refurbished the cemetery, fenced it off and added a gate. In 1967, the cemetery became a branch of the San Bernardino County Museum after its acquisition by San Bernardino County. It has a museum and chapel, and tours are available. Records of who is buried in the cemetery are incomplete but about 1,400 (as of October 2018) names have been identified out of a total of 2,000 estimated burials.Find a Grave.

The earliest known interment was that of Louis Rubidoux, who came to California in 1844 and bought the Jurupa Rancho near today's City of Riverside. Another burial was that of Cornelius Jensen in 1886; Jensen was a Danish sea captain who established a store at Agua Mansa before moving to part of the Robidoux ranch. Jensen's wife, Mercedes Alvarado, is also buried in the cemetery along with other members of her family. Lorenzo Trujillo, the original patriarch of the community, is also believed to rest somewhere in a grave that long ago lost its marker.

Grimston was the second and only one of the six sons of Sir Harbottle Grimston, 2nd Baronet, a leading Presbyterian lawyer, who survived him. His mother was Sir Harbottle's first wife, Mary Croke, daughter of Sir George Croke, a Justice of the King's Bench. Career He was elected Member of Parliament for St Albans at a by-election in May 1668. He was not returned to the parliament of 1678, but was re-elected in 1679 and 1680. During the reign of James II he remained in private life, being, it is said, much disliked by the king, who expressly excepted him from pardon in the manifesto he issued when he contemplated landing in England (1692). Grimston succeeded to his father's baronetcy and estates, including Gorhambury, in 1683, and was returned a member of the Convention Parliament of 22 January 1689. From that time till May 1699 he sat continuously for his old borough of St Albans. Personal life Hon.

By her he had a son and daughter, but both died young, and on his death, which occurred in October 1700, the Grimston baronetcy became extinct. Grimston left the family estates, which he had increased by the purchase of the manor of Windridge from Henry Osbaston, to his great-nephew, William Luckyn Grimston (later the 1st Viscount Grimston), second son of Sir William Luckyn of Messing Hall. Descendants Through his daughter Lady Elizabeth, he was a grandfather of Lady Anne Savile (1691‚Äì1717), who married Charles Bruce, 4th Earl of Elgin.

Method ELP gives a series expansion of the orbital elements and the coordinates of the Moon. The authors refer to it as a \\"semi-analytical\\" theory because they developed their expressions not purely symbolically, but introduced numerical values for orbital constants from the outset; but they also constructed partial derivatives of all terms with respect to these constants, so they could make corrections afterwards to reach the final solution. ELP has been fitted not directly to observations, but to the numerical integrations known as the Jet Propulsion Laboratory Development Ephemeris (which includes the Lunar Ephemerides), that in their turn have been fitted to actual astronomical observations. ELP was fitted initially to the DE200, but improved parameters have been published up to DE405. Even though ELP contains more than 20,000 periodic terms, it is not sufficiently accurate to predict the Moon's position to the centimeter accuracy with which that can be measured by LLR. An attempt was made to improve the planetary terms with the ELP/MPP02 lunar theory, but heuristic corrections remained necessary. Advantages A theory like the ELP has two advantages over numerical integration: * It can be truncated to a lower level of accuracy for faster computation, which made it suitable for implementing in programs for micro computers. * It can be evaluated for an unlimited period of time, unlike the results of a numerical integration which has specific moments of begin and end; however the accuracy deteriorates into the remote past or future, depending on the quality of the polynomials that model the so-called secular (long-term) changes in the orbital parameters. For the Moon, the main secular factor is tidal acceleration: The magnitude of that effect has become better known after the initial version of the ELP was published, due to a longer base line of LLR observations. Availability and use Upon popular demand, the Chapronts also published ELP2000-85 and a book, Lunar Programs and Tables See with a truncated version of their theory and with programs, that could be used by historians and amateur astronomers to compute the position of the Moon themselves. Jean Meeus used the ELP in his popular book Astronomical Algorithms (1991, 1998). See The ELP was also used to compute NASA's 5000-year canon of eclipses.

Christina Magdalena was described as a \\"somewhat pretty and pleasing woman\\" and was reportedly a friend of the queen, Maria Eleonora of Brandenburg.Anteckningar om svenska qvinnor / She accompanied Maria Eleonora to the King in Germany in 1631, and returned to Sweden with her in 1633.Moa Matthis: Maria Eleonora - drottningen som sa nej, Bonniers 2010, The last mentioned year, there was unsuccessful negotiations about a marriage to Bernard of Saxe-Weimar.Erik Gustaf Geijer, Fredrik Ferdinand Carlson, Ludvig Vilhelm Albert Stavenow: Geschichte Schwedens, Band 3, F. Perthes, 1836, S. 248 After the death of her mother in 1638, Christina Magdalena was asked by the Swedish parliament to contribute to the education of Maria Eleonora's daughter, the later Queen Christina. She did this until her marriage in 1642. Negotiations for her marriage began in 1637, and included \\"a young and rich Marquess of Huntly\\" in 1641. The same year, Frederick VI, Margrave of Baden- Durlach visited Sweden. After having befriended her brother, he was accepted as her suitor.Anteckningar om svenska qvinnor / (in Swedish) The wedding, held in Stockholm, was postponed until 30 November 1642 after a fire broke out at the ball before their designated wedding date on 26 November. Her spouse applied for a position in the Swedish army, but the Swedish military did not wish to employ foreign princes, and therefore, the couple moved to Germany.Anteckningar om svenska qvinnor In 1654, her brother succeeded as king of Sweden, and in 1656, he granted her to estate Kutzenhausen, which provided her with an income.Daniel Ludwig Wundt, Johann Ludwig Christian Rheinwald: Magazin f√ºr die pf√§lzische Geschichte, Band 1, 1793, S. 27 Christina Magdalena became Margavine consort of Baden-Durlach when her spouse became Margrave in 1659. She was widowed in 1662. In Germany, Christina Magdalena was given a good judgement by her contemporaries and described as an \\"excellent\\" character.Eduard Vehse: Geschichte der deutschen H√∂fe seit der Reformation, Band 28-29, S. 16 Issue All Swedish kings from Adolf Frederick to Charles XIII descend from Christina Magdalena.

The presence of two or more cell populations is known as chimerism. Mixed-field agglutination is an important cause of ABO typing and genotype discrepancies. The cause of mixed field agglutinations should be sought prior to setting up blood for transfusion. Causes False chimerism By far the most common cause of mixed-field agglutination is false chimerism. There are several causes of false chimerism; 1) Transfusion of donor red cells. For example, a blood group B individual who has received a transfusion of group O donor red cells may show mixed field agglutination with anti-B sera. His own group B red cells are agglutinated by the anti-B sera while the group O donor red cells in his circulation are unagglutinated 2) After an ABO mismatched stem cell transplant for example a blood group O stem cell donor and a blood group A stem cell recipient.Roback, JD; Combs, MR; Grossman, BJ; Hillyer, CD. Technical Manual. AABB. 2008. pp353, 356.Bluth MH, Reid ME, Manny N. Chimerism in the immunohematology laboratory in the molecular bioplogy era. Transfus Med Rev 2007;21:134-46. 3) Weak expression of the A or B blood group antigen 4) In some diseases, for example leukaemia True chimerism A true chimerism is a rare sporadic phenomenon whereby an individual has a dual cell population derived from more than one zygote. This may result from intrauterine exchange of erythrocyte precursors between twins (twin chimerism) or two fertilized eggs fuse into one individual. Twin chimerism results from mixing of blood between two twin fetuses through placental blood vessel anastomoses, leading to engraftment of hematopoietic stem cells from one twin within the marrow of the other. Each twin ends up with two distinct cell populations of varying proportions.

It was released on 22 December 2000, by Universal Music Taiwan. Tsai surprised many listeners with the album, which positioned her as a more mature and seductive songstress. However, not everyone liked the change of pace and the album fared poorly. The sales of the album were not as good as her previous two studio albums, with only more than 260,000 copies sold in Taiwan alone, and made her the eleventh best-selling singer of the year in Taiwan. The third track, \\"Do You Still Love Me\\", reached number 30 on the Hit FM Top 100 Singles of the Year. The music video of the seventh track, \\"Fall in Love with a Street\\", won an MTV Video Music Award for International Viewer's Choice.

Grisaunt as a young man taught philosophy at Oxford University, and in 1299 was either fellow or student of Merton College. He incurred the suspicion of having practised magic, and when of mature age left England and studied medicine at Montpelier. He afterwards settled at Marseilles, where he acquired great fame as a physician; he is said in his practice to have paid special attention to the nature and cause of the disease and to the constitution of the patient. Grisaunt is commonly stated to have been the father of Grimoald or Grimoard (1309-1370), abbot of St. Victor at Marseilles, who became pope as Urban V in 1362. In a contemporary chronicle (Chr. Angli√¶ ab anno 1328 usque ad annum 1388, p. 52, Rolls Ser.) Urban, who is there called Gillerinus, is said to have been the son of an Englishman. But his latest biographer (Magnan, Histoire d'Urbain V see also Bower, Lives of the Popes, vii. 3, and Fleury, Hist. Eccl. xx. 201) makes him son of William Grimoard, lord of Grisac in Gevaudin, who died in 1366, aged 99, and there are extant grants of John II and Charles V of France to this William Grimoard in which he is styled father of the pope (see Albanes, La Famille de Grimoard, p. 53). Anglic Grimoard, Urban's brother, whom Godwin called Grimoaldus de Grisant, was made by him bishop of Avignon and cardinal bishop of Albano (Bower, vii. 3, and Chron. Angli√¶, p. 53). According to Godwin, Anglic Grimoard is the cardinal John Anglicus, who was admitted dean of York 11 November 1366, and was deprived by the pope 1 May 1381 (Le Neve, Fasti, iii. 123). Bale and Pits, following Boston of Bury, ascribe the following works to Grisaunt: * ‚ÄòSpeculum Astrologi√¶.‚Äô *‚ÄòDe Qualitatibus Astrorum.‚Äô *‚ÄòDe Magnitudine Solis.‚Äô *‚ÄòDe Quadratura Circuli.‚Äô *‚ÄòDe Motu Capitis.‚Äô Of all these they give the first words, but they are not now known to exist. They also add: *‚ÄòDe Significatione Astrorum.‚Äô *‚ÄòDe Causa Ignoranti√¶.‚Äô *‚ÄòDe Judicio Patientis.‚Äô *‚ÄòDe Urina non Visa,‚Äô inc. ‚ÄòNe ignoranti√¶ vel potius invidi√¶;‚Äô a treatise with this title is extant in manuscript at Hertford College, Oxford (Coxe, Cat.

It was established in August 1881, in Ruma, by Pavle Jovanoviƒá and other affluent Serbs. In 1903 Svetozar Pribiƒáeviƒá (1875‚Äì1936) became the party leader. They published Srbobran, which was the party organ. The party advocated for the unification of Lika, Kordun, Banija, Dalmatia, Slavonia and Bosnia and Herzegovina with Serbia to form a Greater Serbia. It was later one of the key members of the Croat-Serb coalition (formed in 1905). It was formed by the Serbs of Croatia in response to the merging of the Military Frontier, inhabited by the Serbs, back into the Kingdom of Croatia. The party at first worked in concert with the Hungarian interests in Croatia, led by ban K√°roly Khuen-H√©derv√°ry. In 1903, however, under its new leader Svetozar Pribiƒáeviƒá it started to collaborate with Croatian parties. It eventually merged into the Croat-Serb Coalition in 1905. After the 1908 Austro-Hungarian annexation of Bosnia, a lesser known Bosnian party of the same name was formed, which participated in the Diet of Bosnia. In 1909 it was involved in the scandalous Agram Trial. After World War I, in 1919 its members mostly joined the Yugoslav Democratic Party in the Kingdom of Serbs, Croats and Slovenes, created by a merger of a wide range of political parties and coalitions, the one from Croatia being the Croato-Serb coalition. The individualism of the SNSS members, though, was never fully erased, and in 1924 most of the former members left JDS and formed the Independent Democratic Party, under the same leadership of the SNSS (president Svetozar Pribicevic).

The Montana Department of Fish, Wildlife and Parks has identified a number of crustacean species as Species of Concern. Crustaceans Crustaceans (Crustacea) form a very large group of arthropods, usually treated as a subphylum, which includes such familiar animals as crabs, lobsters, crayfish, shrimp, krill and barnacles. The 50,000 described species range in size from Stygotantulus stocki at , to the Japanese spider crab with a leg span of up to and a mass of . Like other arthropods, crustaceans have an exoskeleton, which they moult to grow. They are distinguished from other groups of arthropods, such as insects, myriapods and chelicerates by the possession of biramous (two-parted) limbs, and by the nauplius form of the larvae. Most crustaceans are free-living aquatic animals, but some are terrestrial (e.g. woodlice), some are parasitic (e.g. fish lice, tongue worms) and some are sessile (e.g. barnacles). The group has an extensive fossil record, reaching back to the Cambrian, and includes living fossils such as Triops cancriformis, which has existed apparently unchanged since the Triassic period. More than 10 million tons of crustaceans are produced by fishery or farming for human consumption, the majority of it being shrimp and prawns.

History The abbots of Kilwinning Abbey Kilwinning Abbey ruins in the 19th centuryBillings, Plate 41. The Tironensian monks of Kilwinning Abbey held a Grange or farmland at Beith, given to the abbey by Sir William de Cunninghame in the early 14th century.Metcalfe, Page 122 This ownership involved the monks in extensive agricultural activities and details of the rents from their farms show a considerable annual production of cheese in particular, 268 recorded for one year alone.Paterson, Page 480 The Barony of Beith had been given to the Kilwinning monks by Richard de Morville's wife towards the end of the 12th century and the monks as ecclesiastical barons, with the feudal right of 'pit and gallows', had a court hill where they delivered local justice. This artificial earth mound is still in existence, standing close to Boghall House. The abbey's farm or Grange was most likely at Grangehill, a small estate nearby.Hall, Page 135 The abbot may have stayed at the Hill of Beith castle when in the locality as this tower may have been the main residential building of the monks' grange, becoming secularised upon the dissolution of the monastery and passing into the hands of the aristocracy. The site is prominent, commanding a fine view of the surrounding countryside and being well defended by the natural slopes, overlooking the old Loch Brand site that protected its north-westerly boundary. The lairds of the Barony of Beith The abbot of Kilwinning feued out the 'Lands of Hill of Beith' to a cadet branch of the Cuninghames of Kilmaurs, Earls of Glencairn, in the person of John Cuninghame, son of Sir William Cuninghame of Caddel, near Giffordland outside Dalry. At the Reformation, James Hamilton, son of Gavin Hamilton the last abbot of Kilwinning, obtained the twenty-four shilling land of old extent with the teinds of the same of Overhill (Easter) Hill of Beith and then in around 1579 he sold them to Lord Robert Boyd.Dobie, Page 264 The Cunninghames however once again held the castle and lands in the early 1600s at the time of Timothy Pont's famous survey of Cunninghame. Records show that the title 'Beith', 'Hill of Beith' or 'Gudeman of Beith' was applied to John Cuninghame, who was also the ruling elder for the parish of Beith in 1647 and 1649. John was the defender in the process of setting the stipend of the Rev. James Fullarton. Minister of Beith. In 1662 John Cuninghame was heavily fined, the amount being ¬£626 13s 4d, for his support of the religious zealots Colonel StrachanArchibald Strachan Retrieved : 2010-12-08 and Colonel Ker who as members of the Covenanter Army had in 1650 caused considerable damage to the lands of the Earl of Queensberry. The fact that John Cuninghame was recorded as the 'Gudeman of Beith' suggests that he held his lands from the 'true' laird, possibly Lord Boyd as previously mentioned. A feudal laird held land from the King, however a proprietor who held lands from the laird by purchase or otherwise was referred to as the Gudeman of that Ilk; also a man of equal rank or the head of a household. The Cuninghames had sold the castle and lands of Hill of Beith by the end of the 17th century and in around 1798 Hugh Brown of Broadstone purchased Easter Hill of Beith and his son, also Hugh, purchased the farm and lands of Nether Hill of Beith circa 1808.Dobie, Page 134 Easter and Nether Hill of Beith Hugh Brown of Broadstone and Hill of Beith Castle {style=\\"float:left; margin:1em 1em 1em 1em; width:25em; border: 1px solid #a0a0a0; padding: 20px; background-color: #F5F5F5; text-align:left;\\" |- style=\\"text-align:center;\\" |Etymology |- style=\\"text-align:left; font- size:x-medium;\\" |The name Hill of Beith derives from the old barony Court Hill.

The monks also held Loch Brand or Boghall Loch. The shortened version, 'Hill o'Beith' was often used. 'Nether' suggests a building lying below another property, in this case one lying to the west, and marked on Armstrong's 1775 map as 'Mains', the name that was used for a farm attached to a proprietor's dwelling. The Mains farm is shown with a ruined building standing close by. Easter Hill of Beith is also recorded as Overhill of Beith and even West Hill of Beith.Blaeu's map Retrieved : 2010-12-11 Nether was the farm and Easter Hill of Beith was the fortified dwelling of the laird and his family as indicated by the relative size of the buildings and presence of a walled enclosure. In 1832 only a single farm named 'Hill of Beith' is marked, with the original curving entrance lane that survives as a hedge boundary following the later creation of a new direct entrance from Wardrop Street.John Thomson's Map Retrieved : 2010-12-08Porterfield, Page 13.

Hill of Beith Castle The old entrance lane to the castle Castle site with foundations McJannet records that De Morville had a moated hillock at Beith.McJannet, Page 91 This may have later been used as the Court Hill. Easter Hill of Beith was probably a castellated building such as a fortalice or tower house, close to Nether or Hill of Beith Mains, half a mile south-west of the Grange, the monks farm where the abbot of Kilwinning may have stayed when in the locality if not at the castle site itself, overlooking their loch and their court hill. In the early 1600s the fortified dwelling is referred to as Easter-Hill of Byith a pretty building, veill planted belonging to Johne Cuninghame.Dobie, Page 133 Blaeu's map of 1654, originating in the 1600s, shows a castellated tower named 'Hill of Beith.'Blaeu's Map Retrieved : 2010-12-08 General Roy's Military Survey of Scotland (1747‚Äì55) map shows two groups of buildings at 'Hill of Bieth' (sic), the easterly group being enclosed within a boundary wall and having one substantial 'L' shaped building as well as two smaller outbuildings.

It is not marked as a ruin, however the identical image as for the ruined Giffin Castle is used.

Some of these stones are clearly worked or dressed building remnants. The 1845 Statistical Account states that the square castle stood close to the Court Hill and was removed in the middle of the 18th century.Statistical Account, Page 580 Porterfield in 1925 states that 'Johnnie Cunningham's' home, the tower castle, stood at Easter Hill of Beith in the field at top of the old grassy lane that runs up from Netherhill Toll.Porterfield, Page 13 The quote from Love's work is - \\"Their farm is clearly indicated by the name \\"Grangehill\\" (NS 356 546) and \\"The Maynes\\". Blaeu's map indicates a castellated mansion or tower house on part of the Maynes, half a mile SW of the Grange, where the abbot may have stayed when in the locality.\\"Love (1876), Page 283 The castle may have been converted and the buildings used as a farm dwelling before its final demise as a dwelling in the 18th century. The Court Hill Court Hill of Beith Court Hill of Beith from the site of Hill of Beith Castle The placename 'Hill of Beith' itself refers not to the hill, but instead to that rare survival of feudal power, the 'Court Hill' or Moot hill, that sits close to Boghall House, beside the burn that runs down from the site of the old Loch Brand to eventually reach its confluence with the Powgree Burn. The hill is composed of soil and boulders and measures 17 paces in diameter at the bottom, and 6 feet 8 inches high. The flat top, which is flat is not totally circular, and is 8 paces in diameter. As feudal lords, the abbots of Kilwinning Abbey and their secular successors held and presided over courts of law on this hill, it being the 'Caput of the Barony of Beith', the site where the legal entity of the barony was physically located. The dissolution of the monasteries ended the abbots involvement in the mid 16th century. Such court hills were sometimes built from soil deliberately brought to the site from all the different parts of the lands of the barony. The small copse next to the castle site is known as the 'Hangman's Wood' locally, suggesting that this was the site of the barony gallows. Loch Brand or Boghall Loch The site of the old castle in 1850. 'Lane to Old Houses' is marked on this map. The site of Loch Brand from Hill of Beith Castle site The small Loch Brand was once held by the monastery of Kilwinning Abbey and it is recorded that in 1482 the monks had to take legal action against the Montgomeries of Giffin Castle and a James Ker, who were accused of dangerous destruction and down-casting of the fosses and dikes of the loch called Loch Brand.Dobie, Page 95 Although shown on a map of 1654 it no longer appears on Roy's map of circa 1747. Despite this cartographic evidence it is said to have been finally drained in 1780 at which time oak and elm stakes were uncovered which may have been evidence of a crannog once existing here.Ayrshire Roots Retrieved : 2010-12-08 The new lands were used for agriculture and are discernible today (2010) as poorly drained wetlands. Boghall Bog Hall was acquired by Hew Montgomerie of Braidstone (sic) in 1691, succeeded by his son Mathew who died childless. Mathew Pollock of Boghouse acquired the lands in 1734 and was succeeded by his son Mathew in 1771. In turn Matthews son, also Mathew, succeeded in 1790 and in 1826 by his son, another Mathew. Margaret Shedden purchased Bog Hall in 1833 and, after the death of her husband John Shedden Dobie, the property was sold to Charles Greenshields Reid of Grangehill House, a neighbouring property. In 1858 Boghall was sold to William Ross JP, who probably built the present house. In the 20th century the Knox family of Beith were owners.British Listed Buildings Retrieved : 2011-01-16 This old habitation, marked as Boighall on a 1654 map, sits next to the site of the old loch, and was the home to the mother, Janet Pollock, of Robert Tannahill the 'Weaver Poet'.Tannahill Club, Page iii. The Mill of Beith The Mill of Beith Caddell Farm. The water-mill of the Barony of Hill of Beith stood on the Muir or Roebank Burn at Mill of Beith (NS 366 559) where there is a linn or waterfall, called the 'Warlock Linn' or 'Warlock Craigie'.Love, Page 297 The present day Mill of Beith dates from the late 18th to early 19th century, being a small rectangular rubble built building with an offset square kiln. The lower part of the wheel splash wall is faced with ashlar. The wheel was mid breast, about 3 ft (0.91m) wide by 16 ft (4.88m) diameter, and was fed from a dam on the burn which ran through a lade under the road running to the mill.Hume, Page 49 The ruins of the Davies o'the Mill, once home to Dugald Semple, stand nearby down the old lane that has now been blocked off. A glacial erratic stands in the Roebank Burn, used in the past as a diving platform by local youths.Porterfield, Page 12 Micro-history Beith Ladies Walking Group at the castle site Netherhill Toll in 1850. The town of Beith itself was once officially known as 'Hill of Beith' and only later became known by its shortened name.

Contents  Bestiary of Dragons and Giants is a supplement to Dungeons & Dragons (D&D;) which describes all the D&D; dragons and giants with a mini-scenario for each type. The anthology describes how these high-powered monsters live, work, and relax. It begins with an overview of the lifestyles of dragons and giants, followed by short adventures that take place in different locations, written for a wide variety of character levels. The supplement includes 14 mini-scenarios for all levels of characters, as well as a random spell generation table for dragons. The inside of the cover folder shows the relative sizes of the various monsters. The Dragon Spell Generator can be used to determine which spells the various normal dragons and the powerful dragon rulers prefer. It also includes the statistics for each type of dragon.  Publication history  AC10 Bestiary of Dragons and Giants was edited by Deborah Christian, with a cover by Larry Elmore, and was published by TSR in 1987 as a 64-page booklet with an outer folder. Also included was a Dragon Spell Generator. The supplement featured design by James Ward, Warren Spector, Caroline Spector, Steve Perrin, John Nephew, Thomas Kane, Gary Thomas, John Terra, Deborah Christian, Ray Winninger, Rick Swan, Vince Garcia, Bob Blake, Scott Bennie, and Bruce Heard. Interior illustrations are by Wanda Lybarger and Roger Raupp, with cartography by Dennis Kauth and Ron Kauth.  Reception  Jim Bambra reviewed Bestiary of Dragons and Giants for Dragon magazine #148 (August 1989). Bambra felt that the Bestiary of Dragons and Giants adds little to our knowledge of dragon and giant lore. It does not greatly expand the information already available concerning dragons and giants, but redefines it slightly and provides a ready source of adventures that can either be played as stand-alones or dropped into an ongoing campaign.\\" He found the game aids that come with this product to be of special interest; he thought the monsters on the inside cover were artfully rendered and found them to be a great aid when describing the creatures to the players. He called the Dragon Spell Generator a \\"nifty device\\" which comes complete with the statistics of each type of dragon, making it \\"a great bonus when you consider that the D&D; game rules are spread across a total of nine books\\". Bambra concluded his review by saying, \\"As an anthology, the Bestiary of Dragons and Giants is quite bitty. But since its major role is to make available a wide variety of adventures about monsters, this is less of a problem. This is a book to dip into for ideas or to find a suitable adventure at short notice, and less a work to be read from cover to cover. If your prime concern is to have a ready source of adventures available, then the Bestiary of Dragons and Giants is a useful product.\\"  References  Category:Dungeons & Dragons sourcebooks ","title":"Bestiary of Dragons and Giants"},{"id":"29966531","text":"Jorge L√≥pez Caballero (born 15 August 1981) is a Colombian footballer.

Wolfgang Schnell (1984) F. Wolfgang Schnell (* 18 May 1913 in Bad Oeynhausen; ‚Ä† 29 December 2006 in Stuttgart) was a German professor of applied genetics and plant breeding. He belonged to the most prominent scientists in his field during the second half of the 20th century. Curriculum vitae F. Wolfgang Schnell attended high school (Gymnasium) in Celle, Halle, and Leipzig. After having passed the final examinations (Abitur) in 1931 he served his apprenticeship in agriculture on a farm near Hamburg (1932‚Äì1934). Thereafter he studied agricultural sciences in Berlin, Munich, and G√∂ttingen (1935‚Äì1939). Military service (1939‚Äì1945) and captivity (1945‚Äì1948) interrupted his scientific career for almost ten years. In 1949 he received a doctoral degree in agricultural economics at the University of G√∂ttingen. He then changed the subject and attended a two-year training course in plant breeding at the Max-Planck-Institute (MPIZ) in Voldagsen (later Cologne). In 1952 he got an appointment at an MPIZ branch station in Scharnhorst close to Hannover. There he was responsible for the cross-pollinated cereals maize (Zea mays) and rye (Secale cereale). He focussed upon the general principles of plant breeding methodology and the genetic foundations of heterosis. In 1958 he spent six months at the North Carolina State University in Raleigh (hosted by CC Cockerham, RE Comstock, and HF Robinson) and visited several other leading US universities. These visits greatly stimulated his research since he became acquainted with cutting edge research in statistics, quantitative genetics, and breeding methodology. Five years later, he earned his Habilitation degree at the University of G√∂ttingen, qualifying him to work as a university professor. In the same year (1963) he was appointed full professor and director of the newly established Institute of Plant Breeding at the University of Hohenheim (Stuttgart, Germany). There he headed the Chair of Applied Genetics and Plant Breeding until his retirement in 1981. During most of this time he also acted as director, later as a major scientific advisor, of the Hohenheim State Plant Breeding Institute (Landessaatzuchtanstalt). Research achievements Already Schnell's early research at Scharnhorst received great national and international recognition. He significantly contributed to progress in the biometrical, population genetic, and quantitative genetic foundations of modern plant breeding. His greatest achievements were an extension of the linkage theory to an arbitrary number of loci and the derivation of formulae for the genetic covariance between relatives in the presence of arbitrary linkage and epistasis. The genuine impact of these two breakthroughs only became apparent about five decades later with the advent of affordable high-throughput genotyping and sequencing technologies. In addition, Schnell extended the theory of selection for quantitative traits to multiple stages and developed models for assessing the influence of epistasis on heterosis. Last but not least, he modernized the design and analysis of plant breeding field experiments by implementing new statistical tools and electronic data processing technologies. Schnell's breeding activities were mainly directed to the two open-pollinated cereals rye and maize. In rye he started a systematic search for cytoplasmic male sterility in backcross generations of crosses between European and exotic rye accessions. This program was continued by HH Geiger and in 1984 lead to the first listed hybrid rye varieties worldwide. In maize Schnell developed early- maturing flint and dent line gene pools and in 1965 released the first German double-cross hybrid 'Velox' (FAO 210). At the University of Hohenheim Schnell focused on the development of a comprehensive theory of plant breeding. Major research topics of his group included * modelling epistasis in the presence of linkage, * quantitative genetic interpretation of heterosis, * expected response to multi-stage and multi-trait selection, * optimal breeding plans and * genetic correlation between testcross and per se performance of inbred lines. All theoretical studies were accompanied by extensive field experiments, many of which were conducted in collaboration with breeding companies. After his retirement (1981) Schnell concentrated his research on the development of a unified quantitative genetic theory of heterosis. In several papers and scientific talks he made valuable contributions to this topic. In one of his last papers (together with C.C. Cockerham, Genetics 1992) he clarified the influence of multiplicative gene action versus other types of epistasis in heterosis. Schnell excelled in intellectual power, clear research concepts, and a strong mission towards promoting plant breeding. His creative power resulted from his enthusiasm for gaining scientific knowledge and for developing superior breeding strategies. He once compared his scientific enthusiasm with a stampeder‚Äôs frenetic search for gold. Teaching When Schnell was appointed professor of Applied Genetics and Plant Breeding at Hohenheim, no adequate course program existed in this field. During the first years of his employment he therefore spent most of his energy on developing an up-to-date teaching program covering all relevant basic and applied areas. According to his research interests he put particular emphasis on the theoretical foundations and the general principles of plant breeding. He classified the breeding methods into four breeding categories viz. line, population, hybrid, and clone breeding. These categories are unambiguously defined by the reproductive characteristics and the genetic structure of the resulting varieties as well as by the mode of reproduction of the respective species. This classification system proved highly useful not only in teaching but also in research. In the course of time the system was adopted by many colleagues in Germany and abroad. Schnell also built up first courses in biometry and population genetics. To strengthen these subjects, the University of Hohenheim followed his proposal to install a new chair for each of these fields (1971). Thereby Hohenheim became one of the most attractive places for studying plant breeding in Germany. Furthermore, he suggested a fundamental reform of the study course in Agricultural Sciences and, together with D Fewson (animal breeding), he initiated a new study course in Agricultural Biology. Schnell mentored 26 Ph.D. students, many of whom reached leading positions in research institutions and breeding companies.

His earlier books, written in French, have been translated into English, Chinese,, Swedish,, among other languages. A PhD from the University of Edinburgh, he previously graduated in philosophy at Pantheon-Sorbonne University and in economics at HEC Paris. Since 2018, Luis de Miranda is a philosophical practitioner and member of the Swedish Society for Philosophical Practice, and an academic researcher in Sweden. Between 2005-2012 he gathered his literary and philosophical projects under the name of \\"Crealism\\"). Arsenal du Midi, his virtual writing laboratory from 2004 to 2007, used one of two anagrammatic signatures \\"Arsenal du Midi\\" and \\"Animal du D√©sir\\" to explore the triple dimension of creation: natural, egotistic and idealistic. His philosophical essays develop a specific interest for societal issues, historical methods, technological devices, and the cosmological concept of continuous creation via process philosophy (Deleuze, Bergson, Heraclitus, Alfred North Whitehead, Hegel). He has written a cultural and philosophical history of neon signs published by MIT Press (Being & Neonness), a philosophical history of digital devices and automata (L'art d'√™tre libres au temps des automates), presented by the French magazine Sciences Humaines as \\"a new utopia\\", \\"both philosophical, literary, artistic and scientific, an analysis of the Lacanian concept of jouissance in its relation with capitalism, and a study on Deleuze which was translated and published by Edinburgh University Press (Deleuze Studies). In all of these he developed his concept of \\"Creal\\" or \\"creative Real\\".  Oeuvre  He was awarded his Doctor of Philosophy (PhD) from the University of Edinburgh in 2017 and soon after came out his book Ensemblance, based on his doctoral work and published by Edinburgh University Press. While researching and teaching at the University of Edinburgh he founded the CRAG (Creation of Reality Group) and the Anthrobotics Cluster. From September 2014 to March 2017 Luis de Miranda conducted his PhD research on the concept of esprit de corps. at the University of Edinburgh He explored the ideas of collective existence and the hive mind from a discourse analysis and conceptual history perspective: \\"Beyond well-being, ‚Äúwell-belonging‚Äù is a fundamental human aspiration. But so is individual autonomy.\\" His research is multidisciplinary, focused on diverse questions such as What is Life?, process philosophy, social creation, discourse analysis, cultural and conceptual history and French philosophy, intellectual history, with, in his publications until 2020, an emphasis on Deleuze (and Guattari), Lacan, Bergson, Foucault. De Miranda's core concept of 'Creal' explores a form of post- or pre- anthropocentric creativity and notions as (collective) agency, autonomy, subjectivity, social creation, empiricism, biotechnologies, philosophy as care, and esprit de corps. Along with the Creation of Reality Group, he was the founder of the Anthrobotics Cluster, \\"a platform of cross-disciplinary research\\" working on the relationship between humans, robots and artificial intelligence: \\"partial automation is part of the definition of what humans have always been\\", \\"a hybrid unity made of flesh and protocols, creation and creature\\". Since 2019, Luis de Miranda is working both empirically and theoretically on the concept of \\"philosophical health\\". In a talk at the UNESCO headquarters,, de Miranda said: \\"‚ÄúPhilosophical health will be in the 21st century what physical and psychological health were in the 20th century. At the beginning of the century, it is a luxury for the happy few. By the end of the century, it is a necessity for all.\\"  The Creal and Crealectics  His philosophical essay \\"Is a new life possible?\\", published by Edinburgh University Press, and one of the most downloaded Deleuze Studies articles between 2013 and 2015, is an attempt to present an overview of Deleuze's philosophy through the concept of lines of life and the Creal. In his dialogues with Claire Parnet, Deleuze asserts that: \\"Whether we are individuals or groups, we are made of lines\\" (Deleuze and Parnet 2007: 124). Luis de Miranda explains how a singular individual or group may arise from the play of the lines of life; eventually, he introduces the concept of 'Creal' to develop the Deleuzian figure of the 'Anomal', the so(u)rcerer, the active rather than reactive Nietzschean creator. \\"The relationship between crealism and digitalism [num√©risme] is the dialectic of the 21st century\\". Partly born out of his readings of Jacques Lacan, Karl Marx, Gilles Deleuze and Martin Heidegger between 2003-2007, The Creal (Cr√©el in French), crealism or more recently crealectics is Luis de Miranda's proposed answer to the philosophical problem of the Real: \\"Creal is obviously a portmanteau compound of created- real. At the same time, in an essay on Deleuze (Is a New Life Possible?), in my novels Paridaiza and Who Killed the Poet? and in the essay Being & Neonness, a Creal-cosmology is proposed. A philosophical concept answers a question and Creal is my answer to the question What is more real than the Real?\\". Since 2017, Luis de Miranda seems to be systematically using the concept of \\"crealectics\\" instead of crealism: \\"crealectics integrates but supersedes the analytical and dialectical modes of thinking into a practice of prognosis, a meta-anticipation of what is likely to be actualised. A crealectical intelligence integrates and unifies the pluridimensionality and pluridirectionality of living and spiritual processes. It corresponds perhaps to what Spinoza called the third kind of knowledge.\\"  Who Killed The Poet?  In Spring 2017 to coincide with the imminent publication of the English translation of Qui a tu√© le po√®te? Luis de Miranda launched a world literature project to disseminate several translations of his novella. Its aim is to explore the \\"transnational existential grammar of the book and its universal themes, which although written in differing languages and using their own poetry describe the same human emotions\\". In an interview with World Literature Today, Luis de Miranda described this collective project, performed with the collaboration of a network of translators, as \\"reawakening a sort of universal reader\\". Who Killed The Poet? was translated by Tina Kover and joins the already published Turkish edition with Chinese and Swedish translations.

VISS provide physical evidence of vegetation's fundamental role in mediating sediment accumulation and erosion in clastic depositional environments.Rygel, M.C., Gibling, B.C. and Calder, J.H. (2004) Vegetation-induced sedimentary structures from fossil forests in the Pennsylvanian, Joggins Formation, Nova Scotia; Sedimentology, v. 51, p. 531-552. VISS can be broken into seven types, five being hydrodynamic and two being decay-related. The simple hydrodynamic VISS are categorized by centroclinal cross strata, scratch semicircles and upturned beds. The complex hydrodynamic VISS are categorized by coalesced scour fills and scour-and-mound beds. The decay-related VISS are categorized by mudstone-filled hollows and downturned beds.  Hydrodynamic structures  Sediment shadow,Rygel,M.C Upturned beds (vegetation shadow) Upturned beds are mounds of elongated sediment that are deposited on the lee (downflow) side of an obstruction, containing form-concordant stratification.Karcz, I. (1968) Fluviatile obstacle marks from the wadis of the Negev (southern Israel). J. Sed. Petrol., 38, 1000‚Äì1012. These may also be described as tongue shaped.Clemmensen, L.B. (1986) Storm-generated eolian sand shadows and their sedimentary structures, Vejers strand, Denmark, Journal of Sedimentary Research, v. 56, p. 520‚Äì527. These beds are formed where plants were once standing and caused a decrease in bed shear, allowing sediment to deposit near their base. This commonly occurs with meandering flow that deposits sediment on the lee side of a plant. Sediment is also accumulated on the front and sides of an obstruction when deposition is high. The presence of upturned beds in cross-section is consistent with modern vegetation shadows. Scratch circle, Rygel,M.C Scratch circles Sets of concentric grooves that form in sand or mud by the action of sharp objects anchored at the center of a curvature set. Most likely formed from some sort of free moving plant under water.Allen, J.R.L. (1982) Sedimentary Structures: Their Character and Physical Basis, 2. Elsevier, Amsterdam, 663 pp. Plants are bent by the current, causing them to scratch concentric grooves into the adjacent substrate. The grooves are most likely formed in a muddy substrate, which preserved them during deposition of the overlying sediment. These scratch semicircles can record currents in wind or water during ancient deposition. Centroclinal-cross-strata, Rygel,M.C Centroclinal cross strata Bodies of fine to very fine grained sand that fill symmetrical, cone shaped, depressions centered on tree trunks by swirling flood water. The fill is generally organized into form-concordant, concentric laminae that dip towards the tree.Underwood, J.R. and Lambert, W. (1974) Centroclinal cross strata, a distinctive sedimentary structure. J. Sed. Petrol., 44, 1111‚Äì1113. Centroclinal cross strata form from the infilling of scours created around trees by swirling flood water. Studies and piers show us just how the scouring process works. In front of these piers, decelerating flow and friction with the bed material causes a downward pressure gradient that leads to erosive downflow. Downflow is accompanied by horseshoe shaped sediment deposits that generate a U-shaped scour around the front and sides of the obstruction. Scour-and-mound beds Diffuse sandy lenses associated with standing vegetation at numerous horizons, within the poorly drained floodplain assemblage containing heterolithic bedding. These typically occur above rooted horizons. Scour-and-mound beds that are between sand and heterolithic bedding would suggests that they are formed in forested areas with standing water. Where sand charged flows rapidly decelerated and deposited large amounts of sediment with only minimal scour.Gastaldo, R.A. (1986) Implications on the paleoecology of autochthonous lycopsids in clastic sedimentary environments of the Early Pennsylvanian of Alabama. Palaeogeogr. Palaeoclimatol. Palaeoecol., 53, 191‚Äì212. Tree scour,Rygel,M.C Coalesced scour fills Large, internally complex sandstone bodies in well-drained floodplain strata, which superficially resemble small channel bodies. These discrete, locally thickened accumulations are laterally equivalent to thin sheet (crevasse splay) sandstones and are strongly incised into red mudstones. Coalesced scour fills are strongly erosional structures formed where interconnected scours between trees are infilled with sandy sediment during waning flow. Strong incision into underlying strata and downflow tapering suggests that the precursor scours formed in response to vigorous floods across the well-drained floodplain. These essentially are unconstrained by channels and vegetation. The current flow carried only enough sand to fill the scour and blanket the floodplain with a thin sand layer. Decay-related structures Downturned beds and mudstone-filled hollows Sedimentary structures that appear to \\"protrude\\" into underlying strata. Most likely from the decay of entombed plants. These may have a \\"pothole-like\\" form. They reflect a prominent component of soft-sediment deformation in overlying and adjacent strata, but may also represent hydrodynamic activity around a plant that was not preserved.

The railway was opened in several stages between 1847 and 1856, when the final section through Lyon was opened. The opening of the LGV Sud-Est high speed line from Paris to Lyon in 1981, the LGV Rh√¥ne-Alpes in 1992 and the LGV M√©diterran√©e in 2001 has decreased its importance for passenger traffic. RouteThe Paris‚ÄìMarseille railway leaves the Gare de Lyon in Paris in southeastern direction. It crosses the river Marne at Charenton-le-Pont, and follows the right Seine bank upstream until Crosne, where it follows a course east of the Forest of S√©nart. It crosses the Seine near Melun and follows the left Seine bank upstream, along the Forest of Fontainebleau. Beyond Montereau-Fault-Yonne, the railway follows the left Yonne bank upstream. At Migennes the Yonne is crossed, and the small rivers Arman√ßon, Brenne and Oze are followed upstream. Beyond Blaisy-Bas the railway enters the watershed of the Mediterranean Sea, descending the Ouche river valley to central Dijon. At Dijon the railway turns south, running along the east side of the C√¥te d'Or escarpment with its famous vineyards. At Chalon-sur-Sa√¥ne the railway reaches the river Sa√¥ne, and follows its right bank downstream until the city centre of Lyon. Before and after the Gare de Lyon-Perrache it crosses the Sa√¥ne and the Rh√¥ne respectively, and continues downstream along the left Rh√¥ne bank. Between Collonges-au-Mont-d'Or (north of Lyon) and La Guilloti√®re (a southern quarter of Lyon) there is a parallel line to its east, on which the other main station of Lyon, Part-Dieu, is situated. There is also a long parallel line on the right bank of the Rh√¥ne between Lyon and N√Æmes, which is mainly used for freight transport. The railway passes through Valence, Avignon and Arles, where it leaves the Rh√¥ne and turns east. It passes along the northern shore of the √âtang de Berre. After a total length of 862 km, it reaches its terminus Gare de Marseille-Saint-Charles. Main stations The main stations on the Paris‚ÄìMarseille railway are: * Gare de Lyon (Paris) * Gare de Dijon-Ville * Gare de Lyon-Perrache * Gare d'Avignon-Centre * Gare de Marseille-Saint-Charles History The sections Paris‚ÄìLyon, Lyon‚ÄìAvignon and Avignon‚ÄìMarseille were built and exploited by three different companies, that became part of Chemins de fer de Paris √† Lyon et √† la M√©diterran√©e in 1857. The concessions Lyon‚ÄìAvignon and Avignon‚ÄìMarseille had already been united in 1852 of the Chemin de fer de Lyon √† la M√©diterran√©e. The first section that was opened in 1847 led from Rognonas near Avignon to Pas-des-Lanciers near Marseille. Marseille was connected in 1848. In 1849 a line from Paris to Tonnerre (Yonne) and a line from Dijon to Chalon-sur-Sa√¥ne were built, and Avignon was connected with Rognonas. Tonnerre and Dijon were connected in 1851. In 1854 the line from Marseille to Avignon was extended to Valence, and the line from Paris to Chalon was extended to Lyon-Vaise. In 1855 Valence was connected with La Guilloti√®re, a southern quarter of Lyon. Finally in 1856 the passage through Lyon from La Guilloti√®re to Vaise was opened. Together with existing railways north of Paris, this enabled for the first time railway travel between the North Sea or the English Channel and the Mediterranean Sea. It is also known as the \\"Imperial Line\\" as it was used by Napoleon III, who saw it as a way to connect all regions over which he reigned. France at the time had a 50-year delay on industrialisation when compared to England; the railway would help speed along this progress. Coal was carried to all regions of the country, Beaujolais could be sampled far beyond its native area, with wines from the Midi, the C√¥tes-du-Rh√¥ne and even the Bourgognes using the line. The PLM became a sort of \\"wine highway\\", with up to 10% of the company's freight profits in 1909 coming from the wine trade. Services The Paris‚ÄìMarseille railway is used by the following passenger services: *TGV on most of its length, except the section between Combs-la-Ville and Montbard *Intercit√©s from Paris to Nevers and from Paris to Clermont-Ferrand (on the section between Paris and Moret ‚Äì Veneux-les-Sablons) and from Bordeaux to Marseille (on the section between Tarascon and Marseille) *TER Bourgogne, TER Rh√¥ne-Alpes and TER Provence-Alpes-C√¥te-d'Azur regional services on the whole line *Transilien regional services on the section between Paris and Montereau *RER D Paris rapid transit on the section between Paris and Melun References External links Transilien railway map Category:Railway lines in France ","title":"Paris‚ÄìMarseille railway"},{"id":"29966677","text":"Montclair Elementary School may refer to: * Montclair Elementary School - Oakland Unified School District - Oakland, California * Montclair Elementary School - Clay County School District - Orange Park, Florida * Montclair Elementary School - Escambia County School District - Pensacola, Florida * Montclair Elementary School - Beaverton School District - Portland, Oregon * Montclair Elementary School - Garland Independent School District - Garland, Texas ","title":"Montclair Elementary School"},{"id":"29966686","text":"The 83rd Indiana Infantry Regiment, sometimes called 83rd Indiana Volunteer Infantry Regiment, was an infantry regiment that served in the Union Army during the American Civil War.

The sugar alcohol form of mannoheptulose is known as perseitol. Inhibition of hexokinases Mannoheptulose is a competitive and non-competitive inhibitor of both hexokinase and the related liver isozyme glucokinase. By blocking the enzyme hexokinase, it prevents glucose phosphorylation, the first step in the fundamental biochemical pathway of glycolysis. As a result, the breakdown of glucose is inhibited. Because of its inhibition of glycolysis in vitro, it has been investigated as a novel nutraceuticals for weight management for dogs. However, while mannoheptulose is suggested to affect the energy balance of adult dogs, independent of dosage and physical activity, research disagrees whether it significantly alters energy expenditure in dogs. Inhibition of insulin secretion Mannoheptulose has been reported to inhibit insulin secretion from pancreas. This inhibition occurs because when mannoheptulose is present the glycolysis is inhibited (because there is no production of glucose-6-P) therefore no increase in ATP concentration which is required to close the KATP channel in the beta cells of the pancreas causing a diminution of calcium entry and insulin secretion. Natural occurrence Mannoheptulose is naturally occurring in alfalfa, avocados. fig, and the primrose. Heptoses can make up over a tenth of the tissue dry weight of the avocado tree. Though the carbohydrate is thought to be produced during photosynthesis the precise biological pathway for the synthesis of mannoheptulose was unknown as of 2002.

United States Capitol in the background. In the United States, evangelicalism is a set of spiritual principles practiced by Protestant Christians who believe in the necessity of being born again, emphasize the importance of evangelism, and affirm traditional Protestant teachings on the authority as well as the historicity of the Bible. Comprising nearly a quarter of the US population, evangelicals are diverse group drawn from a variety of denominational backgrounds, including Baptist, Mennonite, Methodist, Holiness, Pentecostal, Reformed and nondenominational churches. Evangelicalism has played an important role in shaping American religion and culture. The First Great Awakening of the 18th century marked the rise of evangelical religion in colonial America. As the revival spread throughout the Thirteen Colonies, evangelicalism united Americans around a common faith. The Second Great Awakening of the 19th century led to what historian Martin Marty called the \\"Evangelical Empire\\", a period in which evangelicals dominated US cultural institutions, including schools and universities. Evangelicals in the northern United States were strong advocates of reform. They were involved in the temperance movement and supported the abolition of slavery in addition to working towards education and criminal justice reform. In the southern United States, evangelicals split from their northern counterparts on the issue of slavery, establishing new denominations that did not call for abolition of slavery. (For example, the Southern Baptist Convention was founded over the issue of slaveholders serving as foreign missionaries.) By the end of the 19th century, the old evangelical consensus that had united American Protestantism no longer existed. Protestant churches became divided over new intellectual and theological ideas, such as Darwinian evolution and historical criticism of the Bible. Those who embraced these liberal ideas became known as modernists, while those who rejected them became known as fundamentalists. Fundamentalists defended the doctrine of biblical inerrancy and adopted a dispensationalist theological system for interpreting the Bible. As a result of the Fundamentalist‚ÄìModernist Controversy of the 1920s and 1930s, fundamentalists lost control of the Mainline Protestant churches and separated themselves from non-fundamentalist churches and cultural institutions. After World War II, a new generation of conservative Protestants rejected the separatist stance of fundamentalism and began calling themselves evangelicals. Popular evangelist Billy Graham was at the forefront of reviving use of the term. During this time period, a number of evangelical institutions were established, including the National Association of Evangelicals, Christianity Today magazine and a number of educational institutions, such as Fuller Theological Seminary. As a reaction to the 1960s counterculture, many evangelicals became politically active and involved in the Christian right, which became an important voting bloc of the Republican Party. Observers such as Frances FitzGerald have noted that since 2005 the influence of the Christian right among evangelicals has been in decline. Though less visible, some evangelicals identify as Progressive evangelicals. The annual growth rate of Evangelicalism in the United States is 0.8% according to Operation World, which is higher than the growth rate of the general population (0.59% in 2020). However, the United States ranks 30th in the list of countries where Evangelical growth is least. Definition National Association of Evangelicals, a part of World Evangelical Alliance, works to foster cooperation between evangelical churches in the United States Many scholars have adopted historian David Bebbington's definition of evangelicalism. According to Bebbington, evangelicalism has four major characteristics. These are conversionism (an emphasis on the new birth), biblicism (an emphasis on the Bible as the supreme religious authority), activism (an emphasis on individual engagement in spreading the gospel), and crucicentrism (an emphasis on Christ's sacrifice on the cross as the heart of true religion). This definition, however, has been criticized for being so broad as to include all Christians.. Historian Molly Worthen writes that \\"History‚Äîrather than theology or politics‚Äîis the most useful tool for pinning down today‚Äôs evangelicals.\\" She finds that evangelicals share common origins in the religious revivals and moral crusades of the 18th and 19th centuries. She writes that \\"Evangelical catchphrases like 'Bible-believing' and 'born again' are modern translations of the Reformers' slogan sola scriptura and Pietists' emphasis on internal spiritual transformation.\\" Evangelicals are often defined in opposition to Mainline Protestants. According to sociologist Brian Steensland and colleagues, \\"Evangelical denominations have typically sought more separation from the broader culture, emphasized missionary activity and individual conversion, and taught strict adherence to particular religious doctrines.\\" Mainline Protestants are described as having \\"an accommodating stance toward modernity, a proactive view on issues of social and economic justice, and pluralism in their tolerance of varied individual beliefs.\\" Historian George Marsden writes that during the 1950s and 1960s the simplest definition of an evangelical was \\"anyone who likes Billy Graham\\". During that period, most people who self-identified with the evangelical movement were affiliated with organizations with some connection to Graham. It can also be defined narrowly as a movement centered around organizations such as the National Association of Evangelicals and Youth for Christ. The news media often conflates evangelicalism with \\"conservative Protestantism\\" or the Christian right. However, not every conservative Protestant identifies as evangelical nor are all evangelicals political conservatives. Types Scholars have found it useful to distinguish between the different types of evangelicals. One scheme by sociologist James Davison Hunter identifies four major types: the Baptist tradition, the Holiness and Pentecostal tradition, the Anabaptist tradition, and the Confessional tradition (evangelical Anglicans, pietistic Lutherans and those evangelicals within the Reformed churches). Ethicist Max Stackhouse and historians Donald W. Dayton and Timothy P. Weber divide evangelicalism into three main historical groupings. The first, called \\"Puritan\\" or classical evangelicalism, seeks to preserve the doctrinal heritage of the 16th century Protestant Reformation, especially the Reformed tradition. Classical evangelicals emphasize absolute divine sovereignty, forensic justification, and \\"literalistic\\" inerrancy. The second, pietistic evangelicalism, originates from the 18th-century pietist movements in Europe and the Great Awakenings in America. Pietistic evangelicals embrace revivalism and a more experiential faith, emphasizing conversion, sanctification, regeneration and healing. The third, fundamentalist evangelicalism, results from the Fundamentalist-Modernist split of the early 20th century. Fundamentalists always emphasize certain \\"fundamental\\" beliefs against modernist criticism and sometimes utilize an apocalyptic, premillennialist interpretation of the Bible. These three categories are more fluid than Hunter's, so an individual could identify with only one or all three. John C. Green, a senior fellow at the Pew Forum on Religion and Public Life, used polling data to separate evangelicals into three broad camps, which he labels as traditionalist, centrist and modernist: # Traditionalist evangelicals, characterized by high affinity for certain Protestant beliefs, (especially penal substitutionary atonement, justification by faith, the authority of scripture, the priesthood of all believers, etc.) which, when fused with the highly political milieu of Western culture (especially American culture), has resulted in the political disposition that has been labeled the Christian right, with figures like Jerry Falwell and the television evangelist Pat Robertson as its most visible spokesmen. # Centrist evangelicals, described as socially conservative, mostly avoiding politics, who still support much of traditional Christian theology. # Modernist evangelicals, a small minority in the movement, have lower levels of church-attendance and \\"have much more diversity in their beliefs\\". History 18th century Jonathan Edwards was the most influential evangelical theologian in America during the 18th century The roots of American evangelicalism lie in the merger of three older Protestant traditions: New England Puritanism, Continental Pietism and Scotch-Irish Presbyterianism. Within their Congregational churches, Puritans promoted experimental or experiential religion, arguing that saving faith required an inward transformation. This led Puritans to demand evidence of a conversion experience (in the form of a conversion narrative) before a convert was admitted to full church membership. In the 1670s and 1680s, Puritan clergy began to promote religious revival in response to a perceived decline in religiosity. The Ulster Scots who immigrated to the American colonies in the 1700s brought with them their own revival tradition, specifically the practice of communion seasons. Pietism was a movement within the Lutheran and Reformed churches in Europe that emphasized a \\"religion of the heart\\": the ideal that faith was not simply acceptance of propositional truth but was an emotional \\"commitment of one's whole being to God\\" in which one's life became dedicated to self-sacrificial ministry. Pietists promoted the formation of cell groups for Bible study, prayer and accountability. These three traditions were brought together with the First Great Awakening, a series of revivals occurring in both Britain and its American Colonies during the 1730s and 1740s. The Awakening began within the Congregational churches of New England. In 1734, Jonathan Edwards' preaching on justification by faith instigated a revival in Northampton, Massachusetts. Earlier Puritan revivals had been brief, local affairs, but the Northampton revival was part of a larger wave of revival that affected the Presbyterian and Dutch Reformed churches in the Middle Colonies as well. There the Reformed minister Theodore Frelinghuysen and Presbyterian minister Gilbert Tennent led revivals. The English evangelist George Whitefield was responsible for spreading the revivals through all the colonies. An Anglican priest, Whitefield had studied at Oxford University prior to ordination and there befriended John Wesley and his brother Charles, the founders of a pietistic movement within the Church of England called Methodism. Whitefield's dramatic preaching style and ability to simplify doctrine made him a popular preacher in England, and in 1739 he arrived in America preaching up and down the Atlantic coastline. Thousands flocked to open-air meetings to hear him preach, and he became a celebrity throughout the colonies. The Great Awakening hit its peak by 1740, but it shaped a new form of Protestantism that emphasized, according to historian Thomas S. Kidd, \\"seasons of revival, or outpourings of the Holy Spirit, and on converted sinners experiencing God's love personally\\" [emphasis in original]. Evangelicals believed in the \\"new birth\\"‚Äîa discernible moment of conversion‚Äîand that it was normal for a Christian to have assurance of faith. While the Puritans had also believed in the necessity of conversion, they \\"had held that assurance is rare, late and the fruit of struggle in the experience of believers\\". Its emphasis on the individual's relationship to God gave it an egalitarian streak as well, which was perceived by anti-revivalists as undermining social order. Radical evangelicals ordained uneducated ministers (sometimes nonwhite men) and sometimes allowed nonwhites and women to serve as deacons and elders. They also supported laypeople's right to dissent from their pastors and form new churches. The Awakening split the Congregational and Presbyterian churches over support for the revival between Old and New Lights (see also the Old Side‚ÄìNew Side Controversy). Ultimately, the evangelical New Lights became the larger faction among both Congregationalists and Presbyterians. The New England theology, based on Jonathan Edwards' work, would become the dominant theological outlook within the Congregational churches. In New England, radical New Lights broke away from the established churches and formed Separate Baptist congregations. In the 1740s and 1750s, New Side Presbyterians and Separate Baptists began moving to the Southern colonies and establishing churches. There they challenged the Anglican religious establishment, which was identified with the planter elite. In contrast, evangelicals tended to be neither very rich nor very poor but hardworking farmers and tradesmen who disapproved of the worldliness of the planter class. In the 1760s, the first Methodist missionaries came to America and focused their ministry in the South as well. By 1776, evangelicals outnumbered Anglicans in the South. During and after the American Revolution, the Anglican Church (now known as the Episcopal Church) experienced much disruption and lost its special legal status and privileges. The four largest denominations were now the Congregationalists, Presbyterians, Baptists and Methodists. In the 1770s and 1780s, the Baptists and Methodists had experienced dramatic growth. In 1770, there were only 150 Baptist and 20 Methodist churches, but in 1790 there were 858 Baptist and 712 Methodist churches. These two evangelical denominations were still most successful in the southern states and along the western frontier. They also appealed to African slaves; on the Delmarva Peninsula, for example, over a third of Methodists were black. In the 1790s, evangelical influence on smaller groups such as Quakers, Lutherans, and the Dutch and German Reformed was still limited. Because of cultural and language barriers, the Dutch and German churches were not a major part of the evangelical revivals. 19th century Depiction of a camp meeting In the 19th century, evangelicalism expanded as a result of the Second Great Awakening (1790s‚Äì1840s). The revivals influenced all the major Protestant denominations and turned most Protestants into evangelicals. From the 1790s until the Civil War, evangelicals were the most influential religious leaders in the United States. There were three major centers of revival. In New England, a major revival began among the Congregationalists by the 1820s, led by Edwardsian preachers such as Timothy Dwight, Lyman Beecher, Nathaniel Taylor and Asahel Nettleton. In western New York‚Äîthe so-called \\"burned-over district\\"‚Äîthe revival was mainly led by Congregationalists and Presbyterians, but there was also some Baptist and Methodist involvement. The third major region of revival was the Cumberland River Valley in Tennessee and Kentucky. Unlike the East Coast, where revivals tended to be quieter and more solemn, western revivals tended to be more emotional and dramatic. Kentucky was the location of the Revival of 1800 led by Presbyterian minister James McGready. It was here that the traditional Scottish communion season began to evolve into the American camp meeting. A year later, the Cane Ridge Revival led by Barton Stone lasted a week and drew crowds of 20,000 people from the thinly populated frontier. At Cane Ridge, many converts experienced religious ecstasy and \\"bodily agitations\\". Some worshipers caught holy laughter, barked like dogs, experienced convulsions, fell into trances, danced, shouted or were slain in the Spirit. Similar things had occurred in other revivals, but they were more intense at Cane Ridge. This revival was the origin of the Stone-Campbell Movement, from which the Churches of Christ and Disciples of Christ denominations originate. During the Second Great Awakening, the Methodist Episcopal Church was the most successful at gaining converts. It enthusiastically adopted camp meetings as a regular part of church life and devoted resources to evangelizing the western frontier. Itinerant ministers known as circuit riders traveled hundreds of miles each year to preach and serve scattered congregations. The Methodists took a democratic and egalitarian approach to ministry, allowing poor and uneducated young men to become circuit riders. The Baptists also expanded rapidly. Like the Methodists, Baptists also sent out itinerant ministers, often with little education. Charles Grandison Finney, the most prominent revivalist of the Second Great Awakening The theology behind the First Great Awakening was largely Calvinist. Calvinists taught predestination and that God only gives salvation to a small group of the elect and condemns everyone else to hell. The Calvinist doctrine of irresistible grace denied to humans free will or any role in their own salvation. The Second Great Awakening was heavily influenced by Arminianism, a theology that allows for free will and gives humans a greater role in their own conversion. The Methodists were Arminians and taught that all people could choose salvation. They also taught that Christians could lose their salvation by backsliding or returning to sin. The most influential evangelical of the Second Great Awakening was Charles Grandison Finney. Though ordained by the Presbyterian Church, Finney deviated from traditional Calvinism. Finney taught that neither revivals nor conversion occurred without human effort. While divine grace is necessary to persuade people of the truth of Christianity, God does not force salvation upon people. Unlike Edwards, who described revival as a \\"surprising work of God\\", Finney taught that \\"revival is not a miracle\\" but \\"the result of the right use of the appropriate means.\\" Finney emphasized several methods to promote revival that have become known as the \\"new measures\\" (even though they were not new but had already been in use among the Methodists): mass advertising, protracted revival meetings, allowing women to speak and testify in revival meetings, and the mourner's bench where potential converts sat to pray for conversion. Evangelical views on eschatology (the doctrine of the end times) have changed over time. The Puritans were premillennialists, which means they believed that Christ would return before the Millennium (a thousand years of godly rule on earth). The First Great Awakening, however, convinced many evangelicals that the millennial kingdom was already being established before Christ returned, a belief known as postmillennialism. During the Second Great Awakening, postmillennialism (with its expectation that society would become progressively more Christianized) became the dominant view since it complemented the Arminian emphasis on self-determination and the Enlightenment's positive view of human potential. This postmillennial optimism inspired a number of social reform movements among northern evangelicals, including temperance (teetotalism became \\"a badge of honor\\" for evangelicals), abolitionism, prison and educational reform. They launched a campaign to end dueling. They built asylums for the physically disabled and mentally ill, schools for the deaf, and hospitals for treating tuberculosis. They formed organizations to provide food, clothing, money, and job placement to immigrants and the poor. In order to \\"impress the new nation with an indelibly Protestant character\\", evangelicals founded Sunday schools, colleges and seminaries. They published millions of books, tracts and Christian periodicals through organizations such as the American Tract Society and the American Bible Society. This network of social reform organizations is referred to as the Benevolent Empire. Postmillennialism also led to an increase in missionary work. Many of the major missionary societies were founded around this time (see Timeline of Christian missions). John Nelson Darby was a 19th-century Irish Anglican minister who devised modern dispensationalism, an innovative Protestant theological interpretation of the Bible that was incorporated in the development of modern evangelicalism. Cyrus Scofield further promoted the influence of dispensationalism through the explanatory notes to his Scofield Reference Bible. According to scholar Mark S. Sweetnam, who takes a cultural studies perspective, dispensationalism can be defined in terms of its Evangelicalism, its insistence on the literal interpretation of Scripture, its recognition of stages in God's dealings with humanity, its expectation of the imminent return of Christ to rapture His saints, and its focus on both apocalypticism and premillennialism.. In the late 19th century, the revivalist Holiness movement, based on the doctrine of \\"entire sanctification,\\" took a more extreme form in rural America and Canada, where it ultimately broke away from institutional Methodism. In urban Britain the Holiness message was less exclusive and censorious.. In the latter half of the 19th century, Dwight L. Moody of Chicago became a notable evangelical figure. His powerful preaching reached very large audiences.. An advanced theological perspective came from the Princeton Theologians from the 1850s to the 1920s, such as Charles Hodge, Archibald Alexander and B.B. Warfield., v. 20th century The evangelical revivalist Billy Graham in Duisburg, Germany, 1954 By the 1890s, most American Protestants belonged to evangelical denominations, except for the high church Episcopalians and German Lutherans. In the early 20th century, a divide opened up between the fundamentalists and the mainline Protestant denominations, chiefly over the inerrancy of the Bible. The fundamentalists were those evangelicals who sought to defend their religious traditions, and feared that modern scientific leanings were leading away from the truth. After 1910, evangelicalism was dominated by the fundamentalists, who rejected liberal theology and emphasized the inerrancy of the Scriptures. Evangelicals held the view that the modernist and liberal parties in the Protestant churches had surrendered their heritage as Evangelicals by accommodating the views and values of secularism. At the same time, the modernists criticized fundamentalists for their separatism and their rejection of the Social Gospel. A favored mode of fighting back against liberalism was to prohibit the teaching of Darwinism or macro-evolution as fact in the public schools, a movement that reached its peak in the Scopes Trial of 1925, and resumed in the 1980s. The more modernistic Protestants largely abandoned the term \\"evangelical\\" and tolerated evolutionary theories in modern science and even in Biblical studies. Following the Welsh Methodist revival, the Azusa Street Revival in 1906 began the spread of Pentecostalism in North America. During and after World War II, evangelicals increasingly organized, and expanded their vision to include the entire world. There was a great expansion of Evangelical activity within the United States, \\"a revival of revivalism.\\" Youth for Christ was formed; it later became the base for Billy Graham's revivals. At the same time, a split developed between evangelicals, as they disagreed among themselves about how a Christian ought to respond to an unbelieving world. Many evangelicals urged that Christians must engage the culture directly and constructively,. and they began to express reservations about being known to the world as fundamentalists. As Kenneth Kantzer put it at the time, the name fundamentalist had become \\"an embarrassment instead of a badge of honor\\".. The National Association of Evangelicals formed in 1942 as a counterpoise to the mainline Federal Council of Churches. In 1942‚Äì43, the Old- Fashioned Revival Hour had a record-setting national radio audience.Services at the Pentecostal Church of God in Lejunior, Kentucky, 1946 The fundamentalists saw the evangelicals as often being too concerned about social acceptance and intellectual respectability, and being too accommodating to a perverse generation that needed correction. In addition, they saw the efforts of evangelist Billy Graham, who worked with non-evangelical denominations, such as the Catholic Church (which they claimed to be heretical), as a mistake. The post-war period also saw growth of the ecumenical movement and the founding of the World Council of Churches, which was generally regarded with suspicion by the evangelical community. The term neo-evangelicalism was coined by Harold Ockenga in 1947 to identify a distinct movement within self- identified fundamentalist Christianity at the time, especially in the English- speaking world. It described the mood of positivism and non-militancy that characterized that generation. The new generation of evangelicals set as their goal to abandon a militant Bible stance. Instead, they would pursue dialogue, intellectualism, non-judgmentalism, and appeasement. They further called for an increased application of the gospel to the sociological, political, and economic areas. The self-identified fundamentalists also cooperated in separating their \\"neo-Evangelical\\" opponents from the fundamentalist name, by increasingly seeking to distinguish themselves from the more open group, whom they often characterized derogatorily by Ockenga's term, \\"neo-Evangelical\\" or just evangelical.Congregation at Angelus Temple during 14-hour Holy Ghost service led by Aimee Semple McPherson in Los Angeles, California in 1942. More dramatic than the divisions and newfound organization within Evangelicalism was its expansion of international missionary activity. They had enthusiasm and self-confidence after the national victory in the world war. Many evangelicals came from poor rural districts, but wartime and postwar prosperity dramatically increased the funding resources available for missionary work. While mainline Protestant denominations cut back on their missionary activities, from 7000 to 3000 overseas workers between 1935 and 1980, the evangelicals increased their career foreign missionary force from 12,000 in 1935 to 35,000 in 1980. Meanwhile, Europe was falling behind, as North Americans comprised 41% of all the world's Protestant missionaries in 1936, rising to 52% in 1952 and 72% in 1969. The most active denominations were the Assemblies of God, which nearly tripled from 230 missionaries in 1935 to 626 in 1952, and the United Pentecostal Church International, formed in 1945. The Southern Baptists more than doubled from 405 to 855, as did the Church of the Nazarene from 88 to 200.. Overseas missionaries began to prepare for the postwar challenge, most notably the Far Eastern Gospel Crusade (FEGC; now named \\"Send International\\"). After Nazi Germany and fascist Japan had been destroyed, the newly mobilized evangelicals were now prepared to combat atheistic communism, secularism, Darwinism, liberalism, Catholicism, and (in overseas missions) paganism. The Charismatic Movement began in the 1960s and resulted in Pentecostal theology and practice being introduced into many mainline denominations. New Charismatic groups such as the Association of Vineyard Churches and Newfrontiers trace their roots to this period (see also British New Church Movement). The closing years of the 20th century saw controversial postmodern influences entering some parts of evangelicalism, particularly with the emerging church movement. Demographics Socially conservative evangelical Protestantism has a major cultural influence in the Bible Belt, an area covering almost all of the Southern United States. Anywhere from 6 percent to 35 percent of the United States population is evangelical, depending on definition. A 2014 Pew Research Center survey of religious life in the United States identified the evangelical percentage of the population at 25.4 percent while Roman Catholics were 20.8 percent and mainline Protestants were 14.7 percent. A 2008 study showed that in the year 2000 about 9 percent of Americans attended an evangelical service on any given Sunday.. The Barna Group reported that 8 percent of Americans in 2006 were born-again evangelicals, defined as those who answered yes to these nine questions: *\\"Have you made a personal commitment to Jesus Christ that is still important in your life today?\\" *\\"Do you believe that when you die you will go to Heaven because you have confessed your sins and have accepted Jesus Christ as your savior?\\" *\\"Is your faith very important in your life today?\\" *\\"Do you have a personal responsibility to share your religious beliefs about Christ with non-Christians?\\" *\\"Does Satan exist?\\" *\\"Is eternal salvation possible only through grace, not works?\\" *\\"Did Jesus Christ live a sinless life on earth?\\" *\\"Is the Bible accurate in all that it teaches?\\" *\\"Is God the all- knowing, all-powerful, perfect deity who created the universe and still rules it today?\\"Gateway Church's 114 Southlake Campus Sometimes members of historically black churches are counted as evangelicals, and other times they are not. When analyzing political trends, pollsters often distinguish between white evangelicals (who tend to vote for the Republican Party) and African American Protestants (who share beliefs in common with white evangelicals but tend to vote for the Democratic Party). In 2012, The Economist estimated that \\"over one-third of Americans, more than 100 M, can be considered evangelical,\\" arguing that the percentage is often undercounted because many African Americans espouse evangelical theology but refer to themselves as \\"born again Christians\\" rather than \\"evangelical.\\" As of 2017, according to The Economist, white evangelicals overall account for about 17 percent of Americans, while white evangelicals under the age of 30 represent about 8 percent of Americans in that age group. Wheaton College's Institute for the Studies of American Evangelicals estimates that about 30 to 35 percent (90 to 100 million people) of the US population is evangelical. These figures include white and black \\"cultural evangelicals\\" (Americans who do not regularly attend church but identify as evangelicals). Politics and social issues Jerry Falwell, whose founding of the Moral Majority was a key step in the formation of the New Christian Right Evangelical political influence in America was first evident in the 1830s with movements such as the prohibition movement, which closed saloons and taverns in state after state until it succeeded nationally in 1919.. The Christian right is a coalition of numerous groups of traditionalist and observant church-goers of every kind: especially Catholics on issues such as birth control and abortion, Southern Baptists, Missouri Synod Lutherans, and others.\\"The Triumph of the Religious Right\\", The Economist November 11, 2004. Since the early 1980s, the Christian right has been associated with several nonprofit political and issue-oriented organizations including the Moral Majority, the Christian Coalition, Focus on the Family and the Family Research Council... In the 2016 presidential election, 81% of white evangelicals voted for Donald Trump according to exit polls.Goldberg, Michelle. \\"Donald Trump, the Religious Right‚Äôs Trojan Horse.\\" New York Times. January 27, 2017. January 27, 2017. Evangelical political activists are not all on the right. There is a small group of liberal white Evangelicals.. Most African Americans belong to Baptist, Methodist or other denominations that share evangelical beliefs; they are firmly in the Democratic coalition and (with the possible exception of issues involving abortion and homosexuality) are generally liberal in politics.Heineman, God is a Conservative, pp 71‚Äì2, 173 Evolution Evangelicals are often stereotyped as Christians who reject mainstream scientific views out of concern that they contradict the Bible. This is true for some evangelicals, such as those who reject evolution in favor of creation science and flood geology (both of which contradict the scientific consensus). There have been a variety of court cases over whether public schools can teach creationism or intelligent design (the position that the complexity and diversity of life is best explained by the intervention of God or another active intelligence).. However, not all evangelicals believe that evolution is incompatible with Christianity. Prominent evangelicals such as B.B. Warfield, Billy Graham and John Stott believed the theory could be reconciled with Christian teaching. The Biologos Foundation is an evangelical organization that advocates for evolutionary creation. The American Scientific Affiliation is an organization for evangelical professional scientists. Abortion Since 1980, a central issue motivating conservative evangelicals' political activism is abortion. The 1973 decision in Roe v. Wade by the Supreme Court, which legalized abortion, proved decisive in bringing together Catholics and evangelicals in a political coalition, which became known as the Religious Right when it successfully mobilized its voters behind presidential candidate Ronald Reagan in 1980.. Church and state In the United States, Supreme Court decisions that outlawed organized prayer in school and restricted church-related schools (for example, preventing them from engaging in racial discrimination while also receiving a tax exemption) also played a role in mobilizing the Religious Right.Heineman, Kenneth J. (1998). God is a Conservative: Religion, Politics and Morality in Contemporary America. pp. 44‚Äì123. . Opponents criticize the Evangelicals, who they say actually want a Christian America‚Äîin other words, for America to be a nation in which Christianity is given a privileged position.. Survey data shows that \\"between 64 and 75 percent do not favor a 'Christian Nation' amendment\\", though between 60 and 75 percent also believe that Christianity and Political Liberalism are incompatible.Smith, Christian (2002). Christian America?: What Evangelicals Really Want. p. 207. Evangelical leaders, in turn, counter that they merely seek freedom from the imposition by national elites of an equally subjective secular worldview, and feel that it is their opponents who are violating their rights. Other issues According to recent reports in the New York Times, some evangelicals have sought to expand their movement's social agenda to include poverty, combating AIDS in the Third World, and protecting the environment. This is highly contentious within the evangelical community, since more conservative evangelicals believe that this trend is compromising important issues and prioritizing popularity and consensus too highly. Personifying this division were the evangelical leaders James Dobson and Rick Warren, the former who warned of the dangers of a Barack Obama victory in 2008 from his point of view, in contrast with the latter who declined to endorse either major candidate on the grounds that he wanted the church to be less politically divisive and that he agreed substantially with both men.

Its themes are the role of women in society, marriage, morals and the early feminist movement. Title The novel's title is derived ostensibly from the notion that there was an excess of one million women over men in Victorian England. This meant there were \\"odd\\" women left over at the end of the equation when the other men and women had paired off in marriage. A cross- section of women dealing with this problem are described in the book and it can be inferred that their lifestyles also set them apart as odd in the sense of strange. Plot summary The novel begins with the Madden sisters and their childhood friend in Clevedon. After various travails, the adult Alice and Virginia Madden move to London and renew their friendship with Rhoda, an unmarried bluestocking. She is living with the also unmarried Mary Barfoot, and together they run an establishment teaching secretarial skills to young middle-class women remaindered in the marriage equation. Monica Madden, the youngest and prettiest sister, is living-in above a shop in London. She is, in modern parlance, \\"stalked\\" by a middle-aged bachelor Edmund Widdowson, and he eventually brow-beats her into marriage. His ardent love turns into jealous obsession suffocating Monica's life. Meanwhile Mary Barfoot's rakish cousin Everard decides to court Rhoda initially as a challenge to her avowed dislike of love and marriage, but he later falls in love with her for her intellectual independence, which he finds preferable to the average uneducated woman's inanity. Despite being virulently anti-marriage, she decides to indulge him with a view to turning down any marriage proposal to show her solidarity with her \\"odd women\\". Ironically, she in turn falls for him. Married Monica meets Bevis, a young, middle-class man who pursues her and represents for her the romantic ideal from popular novels. Crucially, Bevis lives in the same building as Everard Barfoot. Monica, determined to elope with Bevis, goes there. Unbeknownst to her, her husband has hired a detective to follow her. She hears someone follow her up the stairs and, to appear innocent, she knocks on Barfoot's door. This is reported back to Widdowson, and he feels his suspicion has been justified and informs Mary Barfoot of her cousin's blackguardly ways. Rhoda, on the other hand, is on a holiday in The Lake District, and Everard goes to see her there. He woos her and at first suggests they enter a free-union (i.e. live together out of wedlock), which would appear to be consistent with her principles. However, she gives him a conventional \\"womanly\\" response and agrees to be with him only in a legal union; Barfoot, somewhat disappointed in her surprising conventionality, proposes marriage, which she accepts. She then receives a letter from Mary telling of Everard's supposed affair with Monica. Rhoda then breaks off the engagement, after Everard proudly refuses to give an explanation but insists he is innocent. After Widdowson confronts Monica over her infidelity, she leaves him but lives at his expense and even moves, together with her sisters, to his rented house in Clevedon. Virginia has become an alcoholic (her way of dealing with being an 'odd woman'). Monica is pregnant by her husband, but her pride will not let her reunite with him. To salve her conscience, she visits Rhoda and shows her a love letter from Beavis and also exonerates Everard over the alleged affair. Then, months after they last saw each other, Everard visits Rhoda, asks her if she still believes him to be guilty, and repeats his offer of marriage. Even though Rhoda assures him that she believes him innocent, she refuses his proposal, intimating that in his professions of love he was \\"not quite serious,\\" but was partially testing her principles. It is too late for them to reunite. Barfoot soon marries a conventionally educated young woman. Monica gives birth to a girl, then dies soon after. The novel ends with Rhoda holding the baby, crying and murmuring, \\"Poor little child!\\" Criticism George Orwell admired the book and thought it illustrated well one of the major themes of all Gissing's works‚Äîthe \\"self-torture that goes by the name of respectability\\". \\"In The Odd Women there is not a single major character whose life is not ruined by having too little money, or by getting it too late in life, or by the pressure of social conventions which are obviously absurd but which cannot be questioned ‚Ä¶ in each case the ultimate reason for disaster lies in obeying the accepted social code, or in not having enough money to circumvent it.\\" References Further reading * Chase, Karen (1984). \\"The Literal Heroine: A Study of Gissing's 'The Odd Women',\\" Criticism, Vol. XXVI, No. 3, pp. 231‚Äì244. * Comitini, Patricia (1995). \\"A Feminist Fantasy: Conflicting Ideologies in 'The Odd Women',\\" Studies in the Novel, Vol. XXVII, No. 4, pp. 529‚Äì543. * Harrison, Austin (1925). \\"Signposts in Fiction,\\" The Contemporary Review, Vol. CXXVIII, pp. 82‚Äì89. * Lesser, Wendy (1984). \\"Even-Handed Oddness: George Gissing's 'The Odd Women',\\" The Hudson Review, Vol. XXXVII, No. 2, pp. 209‚Äì220. * March, Constance (2001). \\"Women with Ideas: Gissing's The Odd Women and the New Woman Novel.\\" In: A Garland for Gissing.

Early life Born in either Waterford or Ardmore in Ireland,1851 Census (Class: HO107; Piece: 1635; Folio: 650; Page: 30; GSU roll: 193538.) by 1881 he gives his place of birth as Ramsgate in Kent;1881 Census (Class: RG11; Piece: 23; Folio: 54; Page: 11; GSU roll: 1341005) this was either done for social reasons or represents a genuine error. His father John Capel was a Chief Boatman with the Coast Guard. In 1854 he helped to establish St Mary's Training College in Hammersmith and became its vice-principal where he remained until 1858 when ill health forced him to resign and go to France to recover. While in France he established the English Catholic Mission at Pau.  The Apostle to the Genteel  On his return to England he received into the Catholic Church the Marquis of Bute and many high-profile Anglicans. This led to Capel being satirised by Disraeli in his novel Lothair where he appears as Mgr Catesby. The identification of Thomas Capel as Catesby was fairly widespread as a letter of John Cashel Hoey to Archbishop Manning of 2 May 1870, the day of the book's publication, shows.Westminster Diocesan Archive: Letter Regarding Political Issues, 2 May 1870: Ma.2/25/22 In 1873, possibly as a result of this and other conversions, he was created Domestic Prelate to the Pope.  Catholic University College  In 1874 Archbishop Manning established a Catholic University College in KensingtonWestminster Diocesan Archive: Open Letter 21 November 1873: Ma.2/5/30 and Mgr Capel was appointed Rector. The College was established to provide higher education to Catholics who were forbidden by Papal Decree to attend Oxford or Cambridge. The College faced problems from the outset, the principle one being that of finance; the theory was that the rich Catholic families who would benefit from the College would help to fund it during the first few years.Westminster Diocesan Archive: Acta of the Bishops' Meetings, 9 April 1875: 34.5 In practice however these families preferred to send their sons to Oxford or Cambridge and seek a dispensation for doing so. This situation was worsened by Mgr Capel's financial mismanagementWestminster Diocesan Archive: Papers on the Catholic University College in the Manning Collection: Ma.2/5 which left the College in debt and Mgr Capel bankrupt.  Diocesan Investigation  On 27 January 1879 a Commission of Investigation was set upWestminster Diocesan Archive: Minutes of a Commission of Enquiry, 1879: Ma.2/3/166 to investigate the following charges: : :1. To acts of criminal intercourse alleged to have taken place periodically between you (Capel) and Mrs Bellew from 1875 to September 1878 :2. To indecent liberties offered to Mrs Bellew's servant girl in the autumn of 1878 :3. To acts of criminal intercourse with Miss Mary Stourton in 1875, soon afterwards related by her to the Cardinal Archbishop. This relation she was believed to have subsequently retracted. But she had repeatedly since then affirmed ... that the letter which was supposed to be a retraction was written at your dictation and was untrue :4. At the time when you took liberties, as alleged, with Mrs Bellew's servant, you were, as it is asserted, under the influence of liquorWestminster Diocesan Archive: Minutes of a Commission of Enquiry, 1879: Ma.2/3/166 The Commission met in February 1879 and began an exhaustive series of interviews with just about everyone involved however slightly with the case, the exception being Mrs Bellew who declined to attend. Mgr Capel's defence attacked the character of Mrs BellewWestminster Diocesan Archive: Mgr Capel's Defence: Ma.2/3/167 describing her as drunken, immoral and with a character that was \\"tarnished in no small degree\\".Westminster Diocesan Archive: Mgr Capel's Defence: Ma.2/3/167 However the Commission found against Mgr Capel on the first three counts. Following this verdict Manning suspended Capel; he responded by appealing to Rome.  Kensington Confession Case  In August 1880 Mr Rutherford-Smith received an anonymous letter that said: :\\"I caution you as I have had to caution others against allowing your wife to go to luncheon so often at Monsignor Capel‚Äôs. Her friendship with Monsignor Capel is more than of an ordinary character and you had better come to London to sever the acquaintance. Cardinal Manning is already aware of it\\"Westminster Diocesan Archive: Letter to Mgr Capel 26/3/1881: Ma.2/32/36 He ignored this letter and a subsequent anonymous postcard, however on returning to London in November, and hearing a Catholic friend disparage Mgr Capel, Mr Rutherford-Smith decided to go to confession at the Pro-Cathedral of Our Lady of Victories in London. He made his confession to Fr Walter Robinson and during the confession mentioned the anonymous letters and his concerns regarding Mgr Capel. Fr Robinson asked to meet him outside of the confessional and they agreed to meet on the next MondayWestminster Diocesan Archive: Statement of Fr Robinson: Ma.2/32/6 at Fr Robinson's lodgings at 79 Abingdon Road. Up to this point the statements of Fr Robinson and Mr Rutherford-Smith agree, however in his statement of 26 March 1881 Mr Rutherford-Smith states that he believed that this conversation was also covered under the rules of the confessional whereas Fr Robinson said that he was given permission to discuss the matter with \\"any person or persons whom I might think fit for the sake of council\\".Westminster Diocesan Archive: Statement of Fr Robinson: Ma.2/32/6 In March Mr Rutherford-Smith formally charged Fr Robinson with breach of the confessional and in April the matter was placed into the hands of the Holy Office of the Inquisition and the Sacred Congregation Propaganda Fide. Mgr Capel added further charges in a statement of 30 AprilWestminster Diocesan Archive: Accusation of Mgr Capel: Ma.2/32/43 including accusing Fr Robinson of defamation of Mgr Capel, disobedience when Mgr Capel was Rector of the CUC and Fr Robinson its Censor, fabricating with the Mother Superior of the Convent of the Assumption Kensington Square accusations of Mgr Capel's drunkenness, encouraging the accusations of Lucy Stevens (c.f. the Diocesan Commission), and encouraging the resignation of Margaret Plues (Superintendent of St Anne‚Äôs Home) by suggesting that the Cardinal had \\"judged (Mgr Capel) guilty of serious faults against morality extending over many years\\" and that he was determined to \\"suspend (Mgr Capel) absolutely and that within a few weeks\\".Westminster Diocesan Archive: Accusation of Mgr Capel: Ma.2/32/43 However, in May Mr Rutherford-Smith made a statement to Cardinal ManningWestminster Diocesan Archive: Statement of Mr Rutherford-Smith: Ma.2/32/48 in which he not only retracted his complaint against Fr Robinson but also stated that it was Mgr Capel who had persuaded him to make the complaint. Furthermore, he suggested that the letter from Mrs Rutherford-Smith sent to Cardinal Manning was not written in her style although it was in her hand; he suggests that she copied something written by another. This accusation is supported by a letter of Fr Robinson to Cardinal Manning of 22 May.Westminster Diocesan Archive: Letter of Fr Robinson: Ma.2/32/49 By July a pamphlet had appeared giving the version of the case that condemned Fr Robinson; a copy was sent to the editor of the Weekly Register (an ultramontane Catholic paper based at 44 Catherine Street, Strand).Westminster Diocesan Archive: Pamphlet regarding the Rutherford-Smith Case: Ma.2/32/51 The increase in public interest in the case was of great concern to Manning.  Mgr Capel's Defence in Rome  Mgr Capel had appealed his condemnation in England to Propaganda Fide in Rome; this gave him advantages over Cardinal Manning. A letter received by Manning from Archbishop Michael Corrigan,Westminster Diocesan Archive: Letter Regarding Priestly Behaviour November 1883: Ma.2/31/27 Archbishop of New York, which contains a letter to Corrigan by Archbishop John Lynch of Toronto highlights the problem. In the letter the Archbishop complained that any attempt to discipline a priest is foiled if that priest appeals to Rome; there, the letter continues, as he is the man on the spot his evidence has far more weight than that of his Bishop, who by the nature of his job is forced to remain in his diocese and can communicate with the authorities only by letter. Despite Manning's influence in Rome and the work of his agents there it was not possible to secure a conviction, although, despite Mgr Capel's various protestations to friends and supporters, he was not found innocent either. Manning informed Propaganda Fide and the Pope through Cardinal Howard that he would never grant to Mgr Capel faculties in England. As a compromise it was decided that Mgr Capel should go to the United States; he was permitted to return to England to wind up his affairs and then must leave. Mgr Capel returned and Manning provided a large sum to settle his debts; the New York Times reports on the auction at Cedar Villas.  Mgr Capel in America  On 30 July 1883 Mgr Capel arrived in New York where he was feted and received much popular attention. By 1886 however things had started to go wrong for Mgr Capel; the New York Times of 4 October of that year published an article entitled \\"Mgr Capel's Downfall\\" detailing accusations of drunkenness, inappropriate behaviour with women and an affair with the wife of Count Valesin a wealthy California rancher. A later article suggests that the American clerical authorities had believed that Mgr Capel's problems in England were a result of financial mismanagement with the possibility of peculation but that they had \\"never before heard of his being connected with a woman\\". Cardinal Manning was informed on 10 July 1886Westminster Diocesan Archive: Letter Regarding Mgr Capel: Ma.2/3/540 that the Pope had suspended Mgr Capel a divinis; this decree was never cancelled. Mgr Capel lived out the rest of his life at the McAulay Ranch in Sacramento California as tutor to Pio Valesin the son of Count Valesin. His death was announced in the New York Times 23 October 1911.  Mgr Capel's guilt or innocence  Among the papers of the Westminster Diocesan Archive there are many records relating to the accusations directed at Mgr Capel;Westminster Diocesan Archive: Manning Papers: Ma.2/3/1ff, Ma.2/32/1ff these accusations are not limited to those that were examined by the Diocesan Commission or by Propaganda Fide. Mgr Capel is repeatedly accused of sexual irregularities some of which date back many years, although the accusations are made much later after rumours of the investigation have leaked, there are also many accusations of financial irregularity. The suggestion that Mgr Capel borrowed monies without any immediate possibility of repayment is clearly established but there are also reports of his offers to \\"invest\\" money for womenWestminster Diocesan Archive: Letter Regarding Mgr Capel 7 March 1881: Ma.2/3/338 and failing to provide any return on this investment. Some of the cases against him are hampered by the changing stories of the women involved; Mary Stourton repeatedly changed her version of events although she did eventually support the accusation against Capel. This is entirely understandable; the social repercussions upon an unmarried woman of an admission of unchastity were dreadful and in some of Miss Stourton's later letters to Cardinal Manning it would appear that she had suffered a degree of social and familial ostracism.

He was elected at the 1832 general election as the Member of Parliament (MP) for the newly enfranchised borough of Wakefield in the West Riding of Yorkshire. He claimed to have attached himself to no party and often voted with Radical and Irish MPs. This prompted joint Whig Conservative opposition at subsequent elections. He was re-elected in 1835, at the same election that returned his nephew, James Milnes Gaskell as M.P. for Wenlock. He held the seat until his defeat at the 1837 general election by the Conservative Party candidate William Lascelles. Gaskell, whose home was at Lupset Hall, Yorkshire, was a generous benefactor to the local area. In 1842 he purchased land in the nearby village of Horbury and built a school to ensure that the children of Horbury's poor were provided with elementary education free of charge. He contributed ¬£3,000 towards new premises for the Wakefield Mechanics' Institute in 1855 and in 1865 donated ¬£1,000 to assist poorer Unitarian congregations in the north of England. He died in 1875 aged ninety-three. There is a monument to him in the Unitarian Chapel on Westgate, in Wakefield. He bequeathed the school in Horbury, together with ¬£1,000 LNER railway stock to be used for its upkeep to the trustees of Westgate Unitarian Chapel. The school was to have no particular religious opinions and was to provide education for 'those poor children in Horbury whose parents....could afford to pay only a small sum for their education'. The school provided elementary education until 1887 when it could no longer be adapted to meet the Board of Education requirements and Horbury had four other elementary schools established under the 1870 Education Act, providing secular education. The eventual sale of the school and land provided assets for the Daniel Gaskell Foundation, a charity which has evolved with changes in education provision and continues to this day. Its purpose since 1986 is to promote the education of persons under the age of 25 who are resident in the area of the former Urban District of Horbury. To this end it contributes to the provision of prizes in the local schools, makes grants towards the costs of Outward Bound courses and make grants to local students attending university.

It is operated by Swisscom. The original tower was built in 1955, but due to the extreme weather at such a high altitude, it had to be repeatedly rebuilt. Finally in 1997, a completely new tower has been built which is specifically suited to the icy temperatures. Coverage Because of the extremely exposed location, signals from the S√§ntis transmitter cover not only Switzerland but reach far into the German mainland, as well as parts of Austria and the French Alsace region. During the times of analog television, it was usual to watch Swiss television with a roof antenna even in the far away cities of Stuttgart and Munich.

Description The cuplike to convex fruit bodies of the fungus are in diameter, and grayish-blue to grayish-black in color. The dry cap surface is covered with small, fine hairs. The mushrooms have no stem, and have a firm but gelatinous flesh. The mushrooms produce a white spore print. Habitat and distribution The fungus is saprobic, and grows on decaying wood. It is widely distributed in North America, Europe, and Australia.
