Many 20th-century composers like Kagel, Ligeti, Xenakis, Penderecki and Zimmermann wrote music for him. He was also Rektor of the Hochschule f√ºr Musik K√∂ln and Intendant of the Deutsche Oper Berlin.  Biography  Siegfried Palm was born in Barmen (now Wuppertal). At the age of 8 he started to learn playing the cello from his father; later he studied with Enrico Mainardi in master classes in Salzburg and Lucerne. He played as principal cellist in various orchestras, among others in L√ºbeck since 1945, in the NDR Symphony Orchestra, Hamburg under Hans Schmidt-Isserstedt since 1947, and the WDR Symphony Orchestra Cologne 1962‚Äì1968. Siegfried Palm premiered cello concertos as well as contemporary chamber music. He was a member of the Hamann-Quartett 1951‚Äì1962. He played in a duo with the pianist Aloys Kontarsky 1962‚Äì1983, and since 1967 he was a member of the piano trio Rostal/Schr√∂ter/Palm, replacing Gaspar Cassad√≥. In 1962 he became teacher of a master class for violoncello at the Hochschule f√ºr Musik K√∂ln (then called Staatliche Hochschule f√ºr Musik), and from 1972 until 1976 head of this institute. He started teaching at the Internationale Ferienkurse f√ºr Neue Musik in Darmstadt in 1962. From 1976 until 1981 he was Intendant of the Deutsche Oper Berlin. He was president of the International Society for Contemporary Music (ISCM) 1982‚Äì1988, and president of the Deutsch-Franz√∂sischer Kulturrat 1988‚Äì2000. He conducted master classes and workshops around the world, as at the Carl-Flesch-Akademie in Baden-Baden, the Banff Centre for the Arts, Canada, at the Royal Conservatory in Stockholm 1966, Dartmouth College 1969, Marlboro College several times between 1970 and 1990, the Sibelius Academy in Helsinki 1971, and in Los Angeles 1983. He also served in the juries of international competitions. Palm appeared as the music teacher Wendell Kretzschmar in the 1982 German film Doktor Faustus. Siegfried Palm influenced the music of his century considerably, comparable to the cellists Gregor Piatigorsky and Mstislav Rostropovich. He suggested composers to write new works for his instrument, and it is partly due to him that the cello advanced to one of the most important solo instruments in contemporary music. Siegfried Palm played a cello built 1708 by Gianbattista Grancino that Julius Klengel had played before. He died in Frechen.  Music for Siegfried Palm  Siegfried Palm premiered new music, many composers wrote new works for him, some dedicated to him, music for cello and orchestra as well as chamber music and music for cello solo.

It is a state-recognised spa, is classed as one of the mountain villages in the borough and, at just under 800 m. above NN, is also the highest village in the Sauerland. The Astenkrone mountain hotel in Altastenberg.  Geography  Altastenberg lies in the Hochsauerland district about 2 km northwest of the Kahler Asten (841,9 m) and only a little west of the Bremberg (809 m), about 5 km (as the crow flies) west of Winterberg and between the sources and upper reaches of the river Lenne to the south and the Neger to the northwest. It is located near the crest of the Rothaargebirge mountain range, along which part of the Rhine-Weser watershed runs.  History  The village, originally called Lichtenscheid according to early descriptions of land ownership, was established around 1540 by Johann von Hanxleden, when he settled charcoal burners and herdsmen there. This resulted in conflict with the townsfolk of Winterberg who had a claim to the land. Right up to the end of the Electorate of Cologne, which ruled the region, the Count of Waldeck claimed the right at least to levy taxes in the Lichtenscheid area, if not to rule it directly, because he had rented the land to Hanxleden. Around 1600 the village fell within the jurisdiction of the court at Oberkirchen, whose presiding judge was Kaspar von F√ºrstenberg at that time. Around 1563 the village probably had three farms. This number steadily increased to six in 1600, ten in 1630 and fourteen in 1720. In 1630 four witches were prosecuted and executed by burning. Up to 1785 the village was within the parish of Winterberg St James (St. Jakobus). Their dead were buried in the churchyard of the Winterberg parish church. In 1729 it is noted in the parish records of Winterberg St James that every farmer had to provide a sled load of wood to the vicar annually. On delivery they would receive a mug of beer, a little bread and butter and hay for the horses. Since the 18th century there had only been a chapel at Altastenberg until a new church was built in 1971/72. From the 18th century the village was called Altastenberg (\\"Old Astenberg\\") to distinguish it from a newly established village south of the Kahler Asten which was named Neuastenberg (\\"New Astenberg\\"). The early inhabitants of the Altastenberg were herdsmen, charcoal burners and cart drivers. The manufacture and sale of wooden articles for itinerant tradesmen and work in the slate mines in the neighbouring village of Nordenau offered modest secondary income for the poor farmers.  Tourism  Today tourism is the main source of income in Altastenberg. The village is well known for its winter sport facilities. It is only a few hundred metres to the nearby skiing complex known as the Skiliftkarussell Winterberg. Immediately at the entrance to the village there are ski lifts, a langlauf trail (Loipe) and a ski jump (the Westfalenschanze). The so-called Sahnehang slopes are used in winter by skiers, snowboarders and tobogganists. In summer, too, the village is popular because it offers other sport and leisure facilities. The surrounding area is ideal for walking and hiking. Altastenberg lies on the Rothaarsteig long- distance hiking trail which runs over the Kahler Asten. There is also a one kilometre-long mountain bike arena for cyclists which has routes with various degrees of difficulty.

It recounts the adventures of an eponymous Russian soldier, who passes between the world of the living, Heaven and Hell, on a quest for immortality. In the beginning of the story, God rewards Ivan's charitable nature with a pouch with which he can trap all things in existence, and used by the soldier to subdue Satan and the multitude of devils, and eventually serve his purpose of cheating Death. The text also includes a portrayal of Saint Peter as the gatekeeper of Heaven, a reference to the miraculous powers of Saint Nicholas, as well as humorous references to the lifestyle of local aristocrats, or boyars. The protagonist himself is shown to be devoted and intelligent, but is primarily motivated by partying and drinking, activities which he engages in for eternity. One of CreangƒÉ's celebrated contributions to Romanian literature, \\"Ivan TurbincƒÉ\\" has become a familiar point of reference for the reading public and critics in both Romania and Moldova. It has notably inspired a short story by Moldovan author Vlad Iovi≈£ƒÉ and the 1967 Moldovan film Se cautƒÉ un paznic. Plot Early adventures The \\"Ivan TurbincƒÉ\\" storyBased on \\"Ivan TurbincƒÉ\\" (Wikisource) opens with a brief overview of the protagonist's life in the Imperial Russian Army, which had been his home from childhood. Having survived over the age limit, Ivan is given his weapons and two rubles, and released from service. While traveling down a country road, he ends up walking behind God and Saint Peter, who are visiting the world of humans incognito. When Saint Peter expresses alarm at the sight of a soldier who might be prone to mistreating civilians, God informs him that Ivan is a kind man of outstanding generosity, and urges Peter to test that himself. They transform themselves into beggars, and wait at each end of a bridge for Ivan to pass through. The soldier proceeds to give them both of his rubles, stating that \\"God will again render onto me, for there's more of his to give.\\" As Ivan leaves the scene, the moved Peter urges his divine companion to reward the soldier. They both catch up with him, whereupon God reveals himself and lets the astonished Ivan have his money back. The soldier kneels and prays God to bless his army issue pouch (turbincƒÉ), \\"so that I may be able to pack inside of it anybody I may wish; and so that they could never get out without my approval.\\" The amused God grants him this wish, and, before leaving, informs Ivan that, should he ever feel tired of roaming the land, he'll be welcomed to knock on the gate of Heaven. The old soldier continues his aimless travel, determined to put his pouch to the test. That evening, he reaches the house of a boyar, and, profiting from his \\"Imperial man\\" status, demands and receives lodging. The reluctant and stingy boyar decides to trick the unwelcome guest by making him sleep inside the only one of his houses where devils are supposed to be roaming. The soldier falls asleep on a divan, only to be rudely awakened when his pillow is thrown away by invisible hands, and again when the entire room is animated by loud, onomatopoeic sounds. Ivan puts a stop to this when he yells Pa»ôol na turbinca! (an approximate Romanian rendition of the Russian for \\"Get into the pouch!\\"), and all devils throughout the boyar's house are absorbed into his small container. He falls back to sleep, but is again woken up by Satan himself (referred to with the popular etymology Scaraoschi), who is infuriated by the loss of his servants, and slaps the soldier over the face. Ivan is much annoyed by this, and promptly orders his aggressor into the pouch, with the other devils. At daybreak, Ivan takes his revenge on the boyar by awaking his entire household, and claiming that he has spent the night trapping rabbits in his bag, and asks the host to provide him with ramrods so that he may peel the skin off the animals. The boyar, understanding of what Ivan means, hands him \\"a cartload\\" of sticks, whereupon the protagonist drags the devils out one by one and gives each of them a severe beating, making them promise never to return. The emotional boyar embraces the rescuer of his property and offers him permanent lodging, but Ivan declines, stating that his task is to defend God, \\"every man's emperor\\". As he leaves the premises, the narrator notes: \\"It seems to me that the boyar himself [...] had come to fear the pouch, so he did not feel too sorry at seeing Ivan leave\\". Cheating Death Russian icon Back on the road, Ivan states his new purpose, that of finding out where God dwells, and invokes the help of Saint Nicholas. Immediately after kissing an icon of the saint, he finds himself transported to the gate of Heaven. He repeatedly bangs on it, until Saint Peter, the gatekeeper, asks him to state his name and purpose. Still on the other side of the door, Ivan inquires about the essentials of Heaven, being informed that the place does not hold tobacco, vodka, women or lƒÉutari, but that he will find all of these in Hell. He rushes there, and has a similar conversation with one of the devils, whose report is to Ivan's satisfaction. Once the gate is opened, the devils find themselves perplexed and, recalling their earlier encounter with the soldier, decide to service him and tolerate his whims. They are left despondent by their new master's drunken partying and exploitative demands, until the creature known as Talpa iadului (\\"The Foundation of Hell\\"), portrayed as the cleverest demon, promises to overturn the situation: she creates a drum, and bangs on it the rhythm of march, tricking the inebriated soldier into believing that war has started. He takes hold of his belongings and rushes out of Hell, leaving the devils to lock the gate behind him. Ivan then falls back on his original plan of serving God, and returns to the entrance of Heaven, which he obstinately guards for days on end. He is there as a self-appointed guard when Death herself attempts to report back to God for instructions, and, as she insists on getting past him, traps her in the pouch. Leaving the item to hang on a tree, the soldier again bangs on the door, and is allowed inside Heaven for an audience with God. He proceeds to inform divinity that Death is at the gate, but without specifying that she is his prisoner, and asks what orders he should relay. Amused by Ivan's behavior, God asks him to tell the visitor that, for the following three years, she should only kidnap the old folk \\"such as yourself\\". The soldier returns, releases his prisoners, and tweaks the original order to say that Death must roam the forests and consume the old trees within the space of three years. This she does and, when the term expires and she runs back to Heaven, she is shocked to find the soldier is still by the gate. A heated exchange follows, at the end of which Ivan sends Death back into the pouch and leaves for another audience with God. The latter, the narrator informs, is aware of Ivan's ruse, but decides to play along: he lets his guest know that he should tell Death to capture the young for three years, and then misbehaved children for another three. Ivan again misinterprets the command, forcing Death to eat first young trees, then twigs, for a total of six years. Once her ordeal is over, she is back at Heaven's entrance, and again in front of Ivan. He again traps her, telling her that this is revenge for people she has killed \\"since Adam\\", and informing her that she will no longer be allowed out of the bag. The episode is interrupted by God, who lets Ivan know that he should hand in his pouch and prepare for his own timely death, leaving him three days to prepare. The man uses this interval to reflect on his adventures and fashion himself a coffin. When newly released Death returns to him, Ivan claims not to be aware of how people are supposed to be laid to rest. He exasperates his adversary by dropping himself into the coffin every which way but the proper one, until she decides to teach him by personal example. Once Death is on her back, eyes closed and hands crossed on her chest, Ivan seals the coffin lid and traps her inside. God again intervenes, and is shown to be upset about the soldier's tricks: while he resigns in front of Ivan's determination to live, he punishes him to spend eternity as an old man. The story ends with the indication that Ivan went on to party for ever, boozing and attending a succession of guleaiuri (banquets or wedding parties), and that \\"he may still be alive now, if he did not die in the meantime.\\" Critical reception and legacy Ion CreangƒÉ's version of the story probably incorporates an old theme in Romanian folklore and is believed to be an echo of themes shared by several European traditions. Writing early in the 20th century, researcher Tudor Pamfile integrated \\"Ivan TurbincƒÉ\\" within a large framework of Eastern European folkloric accounts in which Death or Samodiva are the antagonists.Tudor Pamfile, \\"Enemies and Friends of Man II\\" (excerpts), in the Romanian Cultural Institute's Plural Magazine , Nr. 24/2004 Also according to Pamfile, the story of a soldier escaping fatality in a fashion similar to Ivan's is present in Ukrainian folklore. The interest in uncovering the links between CreangƒÉ's stories and oral literature was later pursued by other commentators. Focusing on the episode in which Ivan plays stupid in front of Death, Romanian researcher of children's literature Mugura≈ü Constantinescu described the similarity between CreangƒÉ's character and Till Eulenspiegel, a popular character in German folklore.Mugura≈ü Constantinescu, \\"Figures et repr√©sentations du vieillir et de la vieillesse dans les contes de Ion CreangƒÉ\\", in Alain Montandon (ed.), Figures du vieillir, Presses Universitaires Blaise Pascal, Clermont-Ferrand, 2005, p.70. Constantinescu, who analyzed the manner in which old age is depicted in the 19th-century writer's work, saw \\"Ivan TurbincƒÉ\\" as standing for a \\"well-adjusted, cheerful, jovial side\\" of man's final years, concluding: \\"Even if [Ivan's] eternal old age is located on the border between boredom and entertainment, it allows room for games, pranks, mischief, which may yet become characteristic for old age, too commonly associated with disease, powerlessness, sadness.\\" Literary historian Mircea Braga, who discussed the presence of folkloric narrative motifs in CreangƒÉ's main stories, noted that such texts are usually introduced by a \\"perturbing situation\\"‚Äîin the case of \\"Ivan TurbincƒÉ\\", the acquisition of \\"an item with miraculous qualities.\\"Braga, p.207-208 Another such omnipresent element, Braga argues, is the series of \\"trials\\" which are imposed on the various protagonists, and which, in this case, are found \\"in the haunted house episode, in that of hellish partying or in Death's successive pressures.\\"Braga, p.211 Essayist and literary chronicler Gheorghe Grigurcu comments on the manner in which protagonist defies Death, seeing it as \\"probably an archaic manner of conjuration, the residue of a magic ritual.\\" Gheorghe Grigurcu, \\"Un cimitir vesel\\", in Rom√¢nia LiterarƒÉ, Nr. 39/2008 A controversial reinterpretation of the story was publicized during the final stages of Romania's communist regime, when the official national communist ideology came to endorse radically nationalist claims such as Protochronism. At that stage, retrospectively called \\"cultural megalomania\\" by historian Lucian Boia, Protochronist ideologue Dan Zamfirescu claimed that Ion CreangƒÉ was equal or superior to world classics Homer, William Shakespeare and Johann Wolfgang von Goethe, and found Ivan TurbincƒÉ, \\"the character who dominates world history in our century\\", to be \\"more contemporary than Hamlet, Faust, Don Quixote, and Alyosha Karamazov\\".Lucian Boia, History and Myth in Romanian Consciousness, Central European University Press, Budapest, 2001, p.80. Outside of this context, the story served to inspire the Timi»ôoara-based writer ≈ûerban Foar≈£ƒÉ, who used it as the basis for a 1983 adaptation for the Romanian stage. Sanda Diaconescu, \\"Cronica dramaticƒÉ: Ivan TurbincƒÉ de ≈ûerban Foar≈£ƒÉ, dupƒÉ Ion CreangƒÉ (Teatrul de PƒÉpu≈üi din Timi»ôoara)\\", in Teatru, Vol. XXVIII, Nr. 7-8, July-August 1983; text facsimile republished by the Institute for Cultural Memory ; retrieved September 10, 2009 According to theater chronicler Sanda Diaconescu, the text was fused with fragments from CreangƒÉ's other works, and, in general, with \\"gems from the archaic treasures of Romanian folklore.\\" The \\"Ivan TurbincƒÉ\\" story is also popular in Romania's neighboring state of Moldova, which, as the Moldavian SSR, has been part of the Soviet Union and is historically included in the region of Bessarabia. The 1967 film Se cautƒÉ un paznic, made by writer Vlad Iovi≈£ƒÉ and director Gheorghe VodƒÉ, was loosely based on the CreangƒÉ narrative, and constituted an early sample of Moldovan cinema. Ana-Maria PlƒÉmƒÉdealƒÉ, \\"Spa≈£iul fascinant √Æn care muzica se √Ænt√Ælne≈üte cu filmul\\" , in Revista Sud-Est, 4/2002 Structured around a similarly titled experimental prose work by Iovi≈£ƒÉ, Aliona Grati, \\"Un hectar de umbrƒÉ pentru Sahara\\" , in Contrafort, Nr. 11-12/2005 it received special notice for its musical score, the work of composer Eugen Doga: Moldovan film critic Ana-Maria PlƒÉmƒÉdealƒÉ found it in harmony with the film's \\"symbiosis of the comedic and the philosophical\\". PlƒÉmƒÉdealƒÉ also believes that the music and film both created a discreet satire of Soviet pressures on the local population: \\"The synthetic style of the melodic structure helps the young filmmakers to transfer CreangƒÉ's ideas into a world of totalitarian oppression, highlighting the eternal aspiration of a nation haunted by the atrocities of history toward spiritual emancipation.\\" A similar verdict was passed on Iovi≈£ƒÉ's original text by literary critic Viorica Stamati-Zaharia, who detected possible ironies aimed at the guidelines of socialist realism. A version of the play was staged in 2009 by Moldovan actor-director Ion Sapdaru, and was notably hosted by the National Theater Bucharest. Roxana Lupu, \\"Ion Sapdaru: 'Corneliu Porumboiu m-a ajutat enorm' \\", in AdevƒÉrul, November 28, 2009 The story is among those of Ion CreangƒÉ's that have been known to an English-speaking audience since the interwar period, when they were first circulate din translation. Marius Chivu, \\" 'O, ≈£arƒÉ tristƒÉ, plinƒÉ de humor! De asta iubesc Rom√¢nia' \\" (interview with Paul Bailey) , in Dilema Veche, Vol. III, Nr. 110, March 2006 According to British author Paul Bailey, the versions rely on archaisms and are unsatisfactory; he recommended new translations, in particular one of the \\"terribly amusing\\" \\"Ivan TurbincƒÉ\\".

Born in Pennsylvania, he came to New Zealand after spending time in Australia, where he was a farmer and US Consul. He farmed in Canterbury, where he was known as \\"Yankee\\" Brown. Three of his brothers in law, through his first wife, served as his fellow Members of Parliament. He married a second time, as his first wife died young, and moved back to the United States. On his father's land in Asheville, he came to considerable wealth due to the mining of mica. Early life Brown was born in Lewistown, Pennsylvania, the son of Major William J. Brown (1803‚Äì84) and Ann Marshall Evans. His siblings were William Caleb Brown and Samuel S. Brown. He went to California in 1849 where he worked as a surveyor for a few years, before moving to New South Wales in Australia. There he ran a sheep and cattle farm and served as US Consul. On 11 October 1859 in Sydney, he married Theresa Australia Brown (n√©e Peacock), the daughter of John Jenkins Peacock (d. 1866) and Maria Peacock (1804‚Äì1884). Life in New Zealand The Browns moved to New Zealand and settled in a farming community on the Eyre River near Christchurch. Brown gave the area a Cherokee name, Swannanoa, and was known in the district as \\"Yankee Brown\\". He was a main benefactor of the Swannanoa Methodist Church, which opened in 1874. He moved to Papanui in 1877, having bought property in what became Brown's Road but is now spelt Browns Road. He was the first general manager of the Christchurch Tramway Board. The residence was called Chippenham Lodge and still stands today. Political career Brown contested the Ashley electorate in the 1871 general election against Gray and William Miles Maskell. On election day on 18 February, Brown achieved an absolute majority, with 171 votes, and 82 and 67 votes for Gray and Maskell, respectively. The nominations for the 1876 general election took place in Leithfield on 30 December 1875. Brown and Maskell were put forward. Both reflected on their experience; Brown had by now been in parliament for five years, and Maskell had held the Sefton seat on the Canterbury Provincial Council for ten years (since 1866). The election was held on 11 January 1876, and Brown and Maskell received 266 and 197 votes respectively. Brown announced several months before the 1879 general election that he would not stand again for Ashley, but that he may consider contesting another electorate. In response to several deputations urging him to stand again, Brown announced in mid August that his situation had now changed, and he would not stand at all. His friends would have to \\"release him from his promise not to stand\\", but he would consider putting his name forward if they did release him. Brown did not contest any electorate in 1879, but William Sefton Moorhouse, Walpole Cheshire Fendall and Cunningham contested the Ashley seat, with Moorhouse winning with a majority of 65 votes. Brown contested the St Albans electorate in the 9 December 1881 general election with J. L. Wilson and A. W. O'Neill. They received 218, 168 and 85 votes, respectively. Brown was declared elected. He did not stand for re-election in the 22 July 1884 general election. Family His son William Vance Brown (b. 1864) was one of the first Lincoln College students. He managed the Wai-iti run for his uncle John Thomas Peacock. His second daughter Kate (Katy) Elizabeth Brown was born on 4 September 1867. His daughter Maria Theresa later married Reverend H. Fields. Hubert Evans was another son. The eldest son was John Peacock Brown. He was educated at Christ's College during 1873‚Äì74 and died on 5 February 1877. John Evans Brown, the youngest son, died only five days later on 10 February 1877, aged 11 months. At least three of Brown's children were buried in Christchurch's Barbadoes Street Cemetery. His wife Theresa never recovered from this loss and died on 11 February 1880, aged 42. Through his wife Theresa, Brown had three brothers in law as fellow Members of Parliament. John Thomas Peacock, Theresa's brother, was elected unopposed to Parliament at the 1868 by-election in the Lyttelton electorate He was confirmed in the 1871 election for Lyttelton, again elected unopposed. In early April 1873, Peacock was promoted to the Legislative Council (the upper house) and resigned from Parliament on 5 April 1873. Henry Richard Webb married one of the Peacock sisters in 1857 in Sydney and emigrated to New Zealand in 1868. He succeeded John Thomas Peacock in the Lyttelton electorate in 1873, and held the seat until the end of 1875. Francis James Garrick (1833‚Äì1890), from Sydney, married Theresa's oldest sister, Elizabeth. He came to New Zealand in 1864, and succeeded Brown in the St Albans electorate from 1884-87. Return to America Brown remarried on 20 December 1883, to Jane (Emily) Martin, at St Peter's Church in Wellington. Brown left Parliament and the parents emigrated to America with four of their children (Maria Theresa, Kate Elizabeth, Potter Maclay, and Sydney Hubert; William Vance Brown followed the next year). They left Lyttelton on 30 August 1884 (the same year as his father died) on board the Tongariro, sailing for Rio de Janeiro. They went to Asheville in North Carolina, as his father (1803‚Äì84) owned large areas of land there. The land was considered to be worthless, but the Browns found mica deposits. They built a factory and gained considerable wealth. Brown built a homestead that he called Zealandia Castle. His daughter Kate Elizabeth married at Asheville on 18 November 1892, had three children and died in New York. Brown died on 9 July 1895 in Asheville.

Originally an actress by profession, Hatoyama later worked as a stylist, interior designer and cookbook author. In an interview, then Prime Minister-designate Yukio Hatoyama credited Miyuki with his professional success and praised her enthusiasm. Hatoyama indicated that Miyuki would take an unusually prominent role for the wife of a Japanese prime minister during his administration.  Biography   Early life  Hatoyama was born on 28 June 1943 in Shanghai, China, to devout Protestant parents while the city was under Japanese occupation during World War II. She was raised in the Japanese city of Kobe.  Career  Hatoyama was an actress in the all-female Takarazuka Revue during the 1960s.

Life and career He was born in 1946, the son of Augusto da Silva Hunguana and Am√©lia Abudo Hunguana. He graduated with a Law Degree from the University of Lisbon (Universidade Cl√°ssica de Lisboa) in 1972, becoming one of the very few black Mozambican lawyers. He became National Director of Labour in 1975 following Mozambique's independence from Portuguese rule on 25 June 1975. He was then appointed Minister of Justice in 1978 by President Samora Machel and held that post until being appointed as Deputy Minister of the Interior in 1983. In that role, he helped resettle unemployed urban residents to rural areas. In 1986, President Machel appointed him Minister of Information. Hunguana's appointment occurred a couple of months before Machel and thirty three others were killed in a tragic plane crash in Mbuzini, South Africa. While Hunguana was Minister of Information, several journalists were either expelled from Mozambique, dismissed from their positions, arrested, or resigned after harassment from the ministry. After the death of Machel, he remained Minister of Information until being appointed as Minister of Labour by President Joaquim Chissano in 1991, a post he had previously held concurrently with Minister of Justice following the death of Alberto Cassimo in 1980. Hunguana remained in government until the formation of a new government resulting from the first multiparty general elections in 1994. Alongside his ministerial duties he was member of the government's delegation that negotiated the Peace Accord with RENAMO in October 1992 after two years of negotiations in Rome. Hunguana was a member of the Assembly of the Republic of Mozambique from the early 1980s until 2003 as part of the Frelimo Party. In 2003, he was appointed by Parliament to fill one of the Judge vacancies in the newly formed Constitutional Council in 2003 and was in that position for one five-year term before requesting to step down. He is the author of Nwamatibjana, published in 1997 (LC 97980602). From June 2010, he is the chairman of the board of directors of M-Cel, a publicly owned cell phone company. In March 2011, he was appointed the chairman of the board of Telecomunica√ß√µes de Mo√ßambique (Mozambique Telecom).

He won the Canadian Juvenile Singles championship in 1950 then the Canadian Juniors and the 10,000 metres Open in 1951. Stringer failed to make the 1952 Olympic team due to overturning his boat in the Ottawa trials. However, he broke Frank Amyot's 1936 record when he won the senior 1,000 metre singles at the Canadian national championships in 1952. The next year he beat the Olympic gold medallist Frank Havens at a competition in Washington. He was named to the 1956 Olympic team and finished seventh in the C-1 10,000m, which was the best Canadian result in canoe-kayak at those games. He moved to Montreal after those games, but still made the 1960 canoe team. He again finished seventh, this time in C-1 1000m. Stringer retired from the sport in 1962, and died 16 years later. He was survived by three sons. He was inducted into the Greater Sudbury Sports Hall of Fame in 2019. The Canadian national championship trophy for U17 Men's C-1 is named for him.

Prior to this, lead compounds had been used as the pigment and drying agent in different types of paint, for example brick and some tile paints. Lead-based paint has been an important cause of lead poisoning. White lead paint Until the early 1960s white lead (lead carbonate/lead sulphate) was added in substantial quantities as the main white pigment in some paint products intended for use as a primer or top coat over metal and wood, both internally and externally. Examples of where this type of paint may have been used are skirting boards, doors, door frames, stairs, banisters, window frames and sills, wooden flooring, radiators, and pipes, though it could also have been applied to any other surface at this time e.g. plaster walls. Prior to this the concentration of white lead in paint rose to its highest levels between the years 1930 and 1955, as much as half the volume in some paints, meaning many post-war UK houses have significant amounts of lead in original paint layers. In the 1950s, alternative white pigments, such as titanium dioxide, were introduced. In 1963 a voluntary agreement was made between the then Paintmakers' Association, now the British Coatings Federation, and the UK Government that resulted in labeling of paint that contained more than 1% of lead in dry film, with a warning that it should not be applied to surfaces accessible to children. However white lead-based paints remained in the supply chain and were therefore still in use for some time. Following this, white lead continued to be added to some paint available to professional decorators for specialist use. Additionally, paint with low white lead levels was applied as a thin primer coat to some pre-fabricated domestic wooden windows until the early 1980s. In 1992 European Union legislation\\"Council Directive 89/677/EEC\\", The Council of the European Communities, 21 December 1989.

Red lead The lead- based pigments (lead tetroxide/calcium plumbate, or \\"red lead\\") were widely used as an anti-corrosive primer coating over exterior steelwork. This type of paint might have been applied to garden gates and railings, guttering and downpipes and other external iron and steelwork. Similar red lead-based compounds were also widely used as a jointing compound in engineering, to form steam- or oil-tight flanged joints in pipework.

In practice however it has been replaced by safer alternatives (such as red oxide\\"Technical Issues: Red Oxide\\" , Highland Colour Coaters Ltd.

Retrieved on 2015-07-20. Coloured lead paint Until the early 1970s red, yellow, orange and green lead-based pigments (lead chromate) were added to a limited number of decorative coloured gloss and wall paints. Following this non-lead alternatives were used as pigments. However lead chromate continued to be used in yellow road markings up to the present day.\\"Comment: End of the road for lead chromate pigments?\\", Highways Magazine, Sevenoaks, England, November 2014.

Lead drying agent Lead (lead naphthenate) was added as a drying agent to some types of paint to ensure the paint surface hardened. In the 1960s this practice was phased out for ordinary paint available to the general public, however its use has not (so far) been banned by legislation. Advocacy The Lead Paint Safety Association (LiPSA) is a not-for-profit UK organisation that aims to promote awareness and best practice in lead paint safety and compliance. LiPSA's objective is to prevent and ultimately to eliminate childhood and occupational lead poisoning. LiPSA was founded by Tristan Olivier. LiPSA's members include individuals and organisations, especially those in the area of lead paint testing and removal and offers web- based, email and telephone advice in relation to lead paint, including testing strategies. LiPSA also offers an emergency telephone support line for child lead poisoning and/or occupational exposure concerns.

He was also a lawyer in Cleveland for 73 years. Biography College George attended Denison University where he earned all-Ohio Conference honors in football. He also lettered in basketball, baseball, and tennis. He graduated in 1915 with a Bachelor of Philosophy degree, followed by a Bachelor of Laws degree from the University of Cincinnati. Forward pass While Knute Rockne and Gus Dorais are credited as the first team to develop and use the forward pass, it upset the heavily favored Army team. The first forward pass was thrown by Roudebush a year earlier in 1912 to Dave Reese in a 3-3 tie against Wooster College and a 60-3 Denison victory over Otterbein College. George later stated that he used his experience of throwing stones and corncobs at hogs and chickens on his family farm to inspire his passing technique. Prior to 1912, a forward pass could only be thrown 5 yards behind the line of scrimmage and travel no more than 20 yards; noted by football rules 6 and 12. Denison, under coach Walter Livingston, relied heavily on the pass after the rules were changed to allow the ball travel an unlimited amount of distance and be thrown any distance behind the line of scrimmage. This allowed for teams to easily use the pass. The forward pass was used as far back as 1906 by Peggy Parratt of the Massillon Tigers, however it was used more as a gimmick. Roudebush's use of the pass, changed the way the pass was used. It was now a legitimate football strategy. World War I During World War I George served as a captain in the Army. He spent 18 months in France during the war. Pro football George started as a pro with the Cincinnati Celts in 1915. He also played for the Canton Bulldogs while Jim Thorpe was away playing baseball in 1916. When Thorpe returned to the team, George returned to playing for the Cincinnati Celts that same year. By this time George was working in a law office in Cleveland throughout the week. By Friday he would jump aboard a train for a weekend football game, taking along his own equipment in a duffel bag. Sometimes, to make the kickoff, he had to change into his football duds on the train. George's two seasons with the Dayton Triangles in 1920 and 1921 made him the oldest living NFL player from 1988 until his death in 1992. He also lined-up for the Triangles against the Columbus Panhandles in what may have been the very first NFL game. 1916 Pine Village game Probably the greatest moment in the Cincinnati Celts early existence came against a team from Pine Village, Indiana, team 1916. Pine Village consisted of only 300 residents, however it was the top team in Indiana before World War I, compiling a record of undefeated for 13 seasons. In 117 games, they‚Äôd only once been tied. Pine Village faced the Celts before a crowd of 2,500 people in Lafayette. With Pine Village leading the Cincinnati 6-2, the Celts forced to punt. Roudebush then lined up behind the punter. Under the rules of the time, anyone lining up behind the punter was eligible to recover the kick as a free ball. After the ball was kicked, Roudebush, ran down the field. Pine Village not wanting to touch the ball, was unaware that Roudebush was eligible to recover it. Roudebush recovered the ball in the Pine Village endzone, giving the Celts a 9-6 victory. Law practice Roudebush returned to Ohio in 1919 and began his law practice with Snyder, Henry Thomsen, Ford, & Seagrave. He became a specialist in public finance and taxation. Later he was senior partner in Roudebush, Brown, Corlett & Ulrich which merged with Arter & Hadden in 1986. As chairman of the Chamber of Commerce committee on taxation in the 1930s, he favored repealing the enabling act which allowed cities to vote taxes for relief purposes. Other sports Roudebush also played professional basketball in Dayton during the 1920s and officiated college football and baseball games. In 1929 he and Harold Lowe won Cleveland's tennis doubles championship. In 1975, he was inducted into the Denison University Athletic Hall of Fame. Family Roudebush lived in the Shaker Heights neighborhood of Cleveland and was the son of George Milton and Rose Patchel Roudebush. On June 28, 1924 he married Harriette McCann in Dayton. The couple had three children, Jane R. Daganhardt, George M. III, and Thomas. George died in Chardon, Ohio in 1992 and was buried at Maple Grove Cemetery located in Licking County, Ohio.

His surname is sometimes spelt Vivian. Vyvyan was born in 1598 and baptised on 11 July 1598, the fourth son of Hannibal Vyvyan, also an MP, of Trelowarren, Cornwall, and his wife Philippe, daughter of Roger Tremayne of Collacombe, Devon. Hannibal matriculated at Exeter College, Oxford in 1605 and graduated BA in 1609. He married Anne Munday, daughter of Richard Munday of St Columb Minor, Cornwall, on 1 March 1622. The couple had five sons and a daughter together before Anne's death. She was buried on 3 January 1636. The Vyvyan family were prominent in local politics, with Hannibal's father and his older brothers Michael and Francis sitting in Parliament for Cornish constituencies. Francis Vyvyan became captain of St Mawes Castle, and arranged for the post to pass to Hannibal in July 1620. Hannibal also purchased the post of comptroller of Tin Coinage for the Cornish stannaries, and settled in Lostwithiel, becoming a member of the borough's corporation and keeper of Lostwithiel gaol. While keeper of Lostwithiel gaol Vyvyan became involved in a feud with John Mohun, vice-warden of the Stannaries. He sought to be returned for Parliament using the influence of his brother Francis, in order to avail himself of Parliamentary privilege. He was duly returned as the representative for St Mawes in the Parliament of 1628. Whilst in Parliament he sided with Mohun's enemies, Sir John Eliot and William Coryton, in calling for investigations into Mohun's conduct. Vyvyan also sat on a few committees, but otherwise made little impact on parliament before its dissolution in 1629. Thereafter King Charles ruled for the next eleven years without parliament. Vyvyan was mayor of Lostwithiel in 1632‚Äì33, 1636‚Äì1638 and 1640‚Äì41. He supported Parliament during the English Civil War and was probably present at the Battle of Lostwithiel in mid-1644 with the Earl of Essex's army. He held the post of comptroller of tin coinage until the abolition of the coinage in 1650, and by 1653 had settled in Plymouth. He died sometime between then and 22 April 1657.

It is followed by the genocide of between 500,000 and 1 million Algerians by the French forces, which destroyed one third of the population. In 1827, an argument between Hussein Dey, the ruler of the Ottoman Regency of Algiers, and the French consul escalated into a naval blockade, following which France invaded and quickly seized Algiers in 1830, and seized other coastal communities. Amid internal political strife in France, decisions were repeatedly taken to retain control of the territory, and additional military forces were brought in over the following years to quell resistance in the interior of the country. Algerian resistance forces were divided between forces under Ahmed Bey ben Mohamed Ch√©rif at Constantine, primarily in the east, and nationalist forces in Kabylie and the west. Treaties with the nationalists under \`Abd al-QƒÅdir enabled the French to first focus on the elimination of the remaining Ottoman threat, achieved with the 1837 capture of Constantine. Abd Al-QƒÅdir continued to give stiff resistance in the west. Finally driven into Morocco in 1842, by large-scale and heavy-handed French military action, he continued to wage a guerrilla war until the Moroccan government, under French diplomatic pressure following its defeat in the First Franco-Moroccan War, drove him out of Morocco. He surrendered to French forces in 1847.  Background information  The territory now known as Algeria was only partially under the Ottoman Empire's control in 1830. The dey ruled the entire Regency of Algiers, but only exercised direct control in and around Algiers, with Beyliks established in a few outlying areas, including Oran and Constantine. The remainder of the territory (including much of the interior), while nominally Ottoman, was effectively under the control of local Berber and a couple of Arab leaders. The dey acted largely independently of the Ottoman Emperor, although he was supported by (or controlled by, depending on historical perspective) Turkish Janissary troops stationed in Algiers. The territory was bordered to the west by the Sultanate of Morocco and to the east by the Ottoman Regency of Tunis. The western border, the River, was particularly porous since there were shared tribal connections that crossed it. The Regency of Algiers was one of the main bases of the Barbary pirates and Barbary Slave Traders who attacked Christian ships and coastal settlements in the Mediterranean and North Atlantic. Like the rest of the Barbary Coast, the Regency of Algiers lived from the trade of slaves or goods captured from Europe, America and sub-Saharan Africa. The European powers bombarded Algiers on different occasions in retaliation and the United States provoked the Barbary Wars in order to put an end to Algerian privateering against Christian shipping. The conquest of Algeria began in the last days of the Bourbon Restoration by Charles X of France. It aimed to put a definite end to Barbary privateering and increase the king's popularity among the French people, particularly in Paris, where many veterans of the Napoleonic Wars lived. Algerian slave trade and piracy immediately ceased after the French conquered Algiers.  Fan Affair  In 1795‚Äì96, the French Republic contracted to purchase wheat for the French army from two Jewish merchants in Algiers. The merchants, who had debts to Hussein Dey, the Ottoman ruler of Algiers, claimed inability to pay those debts until France paid its debts to them. The dey unsuccessfully negotiated with Pierre Deval, the French consul, to rectify this situation, and suspected Deval of collaborating with the merchants against him, especially since the French government made no provision to pay the merchants in 1820. Deval's nephew Alexandre, the consul in B√¥ne, further angered the dey by fortifying French storehouses in B√¥ne and La Calle despite prior agreements. The \\"Fan Affair\\", which escalated into the invasion. After a contentious meeting on 29 April 1827 in which Deval refused to provide satisfactory answers, the dey struck Deval with his fly-whisk (then called a fan). Charles X used this slight against his diplomatic representative to first demand an apology from the dey, and then to initiate a blockade against the port of Algiers. The blockade lasted for three years, and was primarily to the detriment of French merchants who were unable to do business with Algiers, while Barbary pirates were still able to evade the blockade. When France in 1829 sent an ambassador to the dey with a proposal for negotiations, he responded with cannon fire directed toward one of the blockading ships. The French then decided that more forceful action was required. Following the failure of the ambassador's visit, Charles appointed as President Jules, Prince de Polignac, a hardline conservative. This outraged the liberal French opposition, which then had a majority in the Chamber of Deputies. Polignac opened negotiations with Muhammad Ali of Egypt to essentially divide up North Africa. Ali, although nominally a vassal of the Ottomans, eventually rejected this idea. As popular opinion continued to rise against Polignac and the King, they decided that a foreign policy victory such as the capture of Algiers would turn opinion in their favour again.

Admiral Duperr√© took command in Toulon of an armada of 600 ships and then headed for Algiers. Following a plan for the invasion of Algeria originally developed under Napoleon in 1808, General de Bourmont then landed 34,000 soldiers west of Algiers, at Sidi Ferruch, on 14 June 1830. To face the French, the dey sent 7,000 janissaries, 19,000 troops from the beys of Constantine and Oran, and about 17,000 Kabyles. The French established a strong beachhead and pushed toward Algiers, thanks in part to superior artillery and better organization. On 19 June the French defeated the dey's army at the battle of Staou√©li, and entered Algiers on 5 July after a three-week campaign. The dey accepted capitulation in exchange for his freedom and the offer to retain possession of his personal wealth. Five days later, he went into exile in Naples with his family. The Turkish Janissaries also quit the territory, leaving for Turkey. The dey's departure ended 313 years of Ottoman rule of the territory. While the French command had nominally agreed to preserve the liberties, properties, and religious freedoms of the inhabitants, French troops immediately began plundering the city, arresting and killing people for arbitrary reasons, seizing property, and desecrating religious sites. By mid-August, the last remnants of Turkish authority were summarily deported without opportunity to liquidate significant assets. One estimate indicates that more than fifty million francs in assets were diverted into private hands during the plunder. This activity had a profound effect on future relations between the French occupiers and the natives. In 1833 a French commission wrote that \\"we have sent to their deaths on simple suspicion and without trial people whose guilt was always doubtful ... we massacred people carrying safe conducts ... we have outdone in barbarity the barbarians\\". The expulsion of the Turks created a power vacuum in significant parts of the territory, from which resistance to French occupation immediately arose. The methods used to establish French hegemony reached genocidal proportions and war, famine and disease led to the death of between 500,000 and 1 million of an estimated 3 million Algerians. The news of the capture of Algiers had hardly reached Paris when Charles X was deposed during the Three Glorious Days of July 1830, and his cousin Louis- Philippe, the \\"citizen king\\", was named to preside over a constitutional monarchy. The new government, composed of liberal opponents of the Algiers expedition, was reluctant to pursue the conquest begun by the old regime. However, the victory was enormously popular, and the new government of Louis- Philippe only withdrew a portion of the invasion force. General Bourmont, who had sent troops to occupy B√¥ne and Oran, withdrew them from those places with the idea of returning to France to restore Charles to the throne. When it was clear that his troops were not supportive of this effort, he resigned and went into exile in Spain. Louis-Philippe replaced him with Bertrand Clauzel in September 1830. The bey of Titteri, who had participated in the battle at Staou√©li, attempted to coordinate resistance against the French with the beys of Oran and Constantine, but they were unable to agree on leadership. Clauzel in November led a French column of 8,000 to M√©d√©a, Titteri's capital, losing 200 men in skirmishes. After leaving 500 men at Blida he occupied M√©d√©a without resistance, as the bey had retreated. Colonization begins 1877 map of the three French departments of Alger, Oran and Constantine Chronological map of the French conquest. Clauzel introduced a formal civil administration in Algiers, and began recruiting zouaves, or native auxiliaries to the French forces, with the goal of establishing a proper colonial presence. He and others formed a company to acquire agricultural land and to subsidize its settlement by European farmers, triggering a land rush. Clauzel recognized the farming potential of the Mitidja Plain and envisioned the production there of cotton on a large scale. During his second term as governor general (1835-36), he used his office to make private investments in land and encouraged army officers and bureaucrats in his administration to do the same. This development created a vested interest among government officials in greater French involvement in Algeria. Commercial interests with influence in the government also began to recognize the prospects for profitable land speculation in expanding the French zone of occupation. Over a ten-year period they created large agricultural tracts, built factories and businesses, and bought cheap local labor. Clauzel also attempted to extend French influence into Oran and Constantine by negotiating with the bey of Tunis to supply \\"local\\" rulers that would operate under French administration. The bey refused, seeing the obvious conflicts inherent in the idea. The French foreign ministry objected to negotiations Clauzel conducted with Morocco over the establishment of a Moroccan bey in Oran, and in early 1831 replaced him with Baron Berthez√®ne. Berthez√®ne was a weak administrator opposed to colonisation. His worst military failure came when he was called to support the bey at M√©d√©a, whose support for the French and corruption had turned the population there against him. Berthez√®ne led troops to M√©d√©a in June 1831 to extract the bey and the French garrison. On their way back to Algiers they were continually harassed by Kabyle resistance, and driven into a panicked retreat that Berthez√®ne failed to control. French casualties during this retreat were significant (nearly 300), and the victory fanned the flames of resistance, leading to attacks on colonial settlements. The growing colonial financial interests began insisting on a stronger hand, which Louis-Philippe provided in Duke Rovigo at the end of 1831. Rovigo regained control of B√¥ne and Bougie (present-day B√©ja√Øa), cities that Clauzel had taken and then lost due to resistance by the Kabyle people. He continued policies of colonisation of the land and expropriation of properties. His suppression of resistance in Algiers was brutal, with the military presence extended into its neighborhoods. He was recalled in 1833 due to the overtly violent nature of the repression, and replaced by Baron Voirol. Voirol established French occupation in Oran, and another French general, Louis Alexis Desmichels, was given an independent command that gained control over Arzew and Mostaganem. On 22 June 1834, France formally annexed the occupied areas of Algeria, which had an estimated Muslim population of about two million, as a military colony. The colony was run by a military governor who had both civilian and military authority, including the power of executive decree. His authority was nominally over an area of \\"limited occupation\\" near the coast, but the realities of French colonial expansion beyond those areas ensured continued resistance from the local population. The policy of limited occupation was formally abandoned in 1840 for one of complete control. Voirol was replaced in 1834 by Jean-Baptiste Drouet, Comte d'Erlon, who became the first governor of the colony, and who was given the task of dealing with the rising threat of \`Abd al-QƒÅdir and continuing French failures to subdue Ahmed Bey, Constantine's ruler.  Minor Algerian resistances (1830s)   Blida  In the first battle of Blida, the Berber-Algerian forces led by Mohamed Ben Zaamoum defeated the French army with minimal casualties. In the Second Battle of Blida, through ambushes, Algerian forces effected a French retreat. Both battles were fought in 1830 and France was only able to capture Blida in 1839.  B√©ja√Øa (Bougie)  B√©jaia experienced constant conflicts with the French until its capture. After the fall of the Dey, the tribes of M√©zza√Øa took over the city. In 1831 they defeated a minor French expedition against them. Nevertheless in 1833 France captured the city with minimal losses, from Kabyle and Kouloughli forces. The Algerian Kabyles tried to recapture the city in 1835, but failed against the better equipped French defenders..  Mitidja  In 1834 the French under the lead of Maximilien Joseph Schauenburg, attacked the city of Hadjout. Resistance used Guerilla tactics against France but was crushed by August 1835. On 23 February 1837 the French continued their campaign against the Algerian resistance in the Mitidja plains. On 24 February the French met Algerian resistance on the Mitidja plains, and pushed towards the city of Larbaa, which at the time was still under the rule of Algerian tribes. The city was captured two days later.  Zwawas  On 8 May Kabyles from the cities of Isser and Amraoua raided the farm of R√©ghaia under French rule. This motivated the French to start an attack against the Zwawa Kabyles, and the Kabyles of Isser. On the 17 May the French pushed back the Zwawas from Th√©nia. Meanwhile the French were ambushed by the tribes of Isser and Amraoua, but they were quickly repelled. On 18 and 19 May the French 2nd Light Infrantry division defeated a few hundred Algerian defenders at B√©ni A√Øcha. The French lost three soldiers, while the Algerians lost 18. The same day a few hundred Kabyles tried to ambush the French army but were easily defeated by them. The Kabyles suffered considerable losses. Rise of Abdul Kader The superior of a religious brotherhood, Muhyi ad Din, who had spent time in Ottoman jails for opposing the bey's rule, launched attacks against the French and their makhzen allies at Oran in 1832. In the same year, tribal elders in the territories near Mascara chose Muhyi ad Din's son, twenty-five-year-old \`Abd al-QƒÅdir, to take his place leading the jihad. Abd al-QƒÅdir, who was recognized as Amir al- Muminin (commander of the faithful), quickly gained the support of tribes in the western territories. In 1834 he concluded a treaty with General Desmichels, who was then military commander of the province of Oran. In the treaty, which was reluctantly accepted by the French administration, France recognized Abd al-QƒÅdir as the sovereign of territories in Oran province not under French control, and authorized Abd al-QƒÅdir to send consuls to French- held cities. The treaty did not require Abd al-QƒÅdir to recognize French rule, something glossed over in its French text. Abd al-QƒÅdir used the peace provided by this treaty to widen his influence with tribes throughout western and central Algeria. While d'Erlon was apparently unaware of the danger posed by Abd al-QƒÅdir's activities, General Camille Alphonse Tr√©zel, then in command at Oran, did see it, and attempted to separate some of the tribes from Abd al- QƒÅdir. When he succeeded in convincing two tribes near Oran to acknowledge French supremacy, Abd al-QƒÅdir dispatched troops to move those tribes to the interior, away from French influence. Tr√©zel countered by marching a column of troops out from Oran to protect the territory of those tribes on 16 June 1835. After exchanging threats, Abd al-QƒÅdir withdrew his consul from Oran and ejected the French consul from Mascara, a de facto declaration of war. The two forces clashed in a bloody but inconclusive engagement near the Sig River. However, when the French, who were short on provisions, began withdrawing toward Arzew, Abd al-QƒÅdir led 20,000 men against the beleaguered column, and in the Battle of Macta routed the force, killing 500 men. The debacle led to the recall of Comte d'Erlon. General Clausel was appointed a second time to replace d'Erlon. He led an attack against Mascara in December of that year, which Abd al-QƒÅdir, with advance warning, had evacuated. In January 1836 Clausel occupied Tlemcen, and established a garrison there before return to Algiers to plan an attack against Constantine. Abd al-QƒÅdir continued to harry the French at Tlemcen, so additional troops under Thomas Robert Bugeaud, a veteran of the Napoleonic Wars who was experienced in irregular warfare, were sent from Oran to secure control up to the Tafna River and to resupply the garrison. Abd al-QƒÅdir retreated before Bugeaud, but decided to make a stand on the banks of the Sikkak River. On July 6, 1836, Bugeaud decisively defeated al-QƒÅdir in the Battle of Sikkak, losing less than fifty men to more than 1,000 casualties suffered by Abd al-QƒÅdir. The battle was one of the few formal battles al-QƒÅdir engaged in; after this defeat he restricted his actions as much as possible to guerrilla-style attacks. Constantine Battle of Constantine in November 1836 Ahmed Bey had continuously resisted any attempts by the French or others to subjugate Constantine, and continued to play a role in resistance against French rule, in part because he hoped to eventually become the next dey. Clausel and Ahmed had tangled diplomatically over Ahmed's refusal to recognize French authority over B√¥ne, which he considered to still be Ottoman territory, and Clausel decided to move against him. In November 1836 Clausel led 8,700 men into the Constantine beylik, but was repulsed in the Battle of Constantine; the failure led to Clausel's recall. He was replaced by the Comte de Damr√©mont, who led an expedition which captured Constantine the following year, although he was killed during the siege and replaced by Sylvain Charles, comte Val√©e. Abd Al-QƒÅdir's resistance renewed Battle of Mazagran in 1840 Battle of Sidi Brahim in 1845 In May 1837, General Thomas Robert Bugeaud, then in command of Oran, negotiated the Treaty of Tafna with Abd al-QƒÅdir, in which he effectively recognized Abd al-QƒÅdir's control over much of the interior of what is now Algeria. Abd Al-QƒÅdir used the treaty to consolidate his power over tribes throughout the interior, establishing new cities far from French control. He worked to motivate the population under French control to resist by peaceful and military means. Seeking to again face the French, he laid claim under the treaty to territory that included the main route between Algiers and Constantine. When French troops contested this claim in late 1839 by marching through a mountain defile known as the Iron Gates, Abd al-QƒÅdir claimed a breach of the treaty, and renewed calls for jihad. Throughout 1840 he waged guerrilla war against the French in the provinces of Algiers and Oran. Val√©e's failures to end the war led to his replacement in December 1840 by General Bugeaud. Bugeaud instituted a strategy of scorched earth, combined with fast- moving cavalry columns not unlike those used by Abd al-QƒÅdir to progressively take territory from Abd al-QƒÅdir. The troops' tactics were heavy-handed, and the population suffered significantly. Abd Al-QƒÅdir was eventually forced to establish a mobile headquarters that was known as a smala or zmelah. In 1843 French forces raided this camp while he was away from it, capturing more than 5,000 fighters and Abd al-QƒÅdir's warchest. Abd Al-QƒÅdir was forced to retreat into Morocco, from which he had been receiving some support, especially from tribes in the border areas. When French diplomatic efforts to convince Morocco to expel Abd al-QƒÅdir failed, the French resorted to military means with the First Franco-Moroccan War in 1844 to compel the sultan to change his policy. A French force was destroyed at the Battle of Sidi Brahim in 1845, but eventually hemmed between French and Moroccan troops on the border in December 1847, Abd al-QƒÅdir chose to surrender to the French, under terms that he be allowed to enter exile in the Middle East. The French violated these terms, holding him in France until 1852, when he was allowed to go to Damascus. The Ottomans lodged a formal protest over the invasion of Algeria, but they never conceded the loss of the province. A map of \\"Ottoman Africa\\" from 1905 still shows the empire as possessing a border with Morocco to the west of the \\"region\\" (hitta, a term for a territory with vague borders) of Algeria. 1871 Kabyle revolt The most serious native insurrection since the time of Abd al- Qadir broke out in 1871 in the Kabylie and spread through much of Algeria. By April 1871, 250 tribes had risen, or nearly a third of Algeria's population.Bernard Droz, ¬´ Insurrection de 1871: la r√©volte de Mokrani ¬ª, dans Jeannine Verd√®s-Leroux (dir.), L'Alg√©rie et la France, Paris, Robert Laffont 2009, Conquest of the Sahara Annihilated French expedition (1881) in first french attempt to conquer the Algerian Sahara (Army museum of Algiers).

The conquest of the Saharan lands in Algeria finished in 1903 when France conquered the kingdom of Kel Ahaggar. In that regard, the conquest of the entirety of Algeria finished in 1903.

After a three-year joint investigation by Dumfries and Galloway Constabulary and the US Federal Bureau of Investigation, Megrahi, a Libyan intelligence officer and the head of security for Libyan Arab Airlines (LAA), and Al Amin Khalifa Fhimah, a station manager for LAA, were indicted for the bombing in November 1991. Libya refused to hand them over. After UN sanctions prompted negotiations, Libya agreed to bench trial in the Netherlands before a Scottish court. The United States was given what the then British ambassador, speaking in a personal capacity in August 2009, characterised as a \\"clear political and diplomatic understanding\\" that Megrahi would serve his full sentence in Scotland. At the trial at the Scottish Court in the Netherlands, witnesses, two of whom were paid millions of dollars apiece for their testimony, were heard. Megrahi was convicted of involvement in the bombing and sentenced to life imprisonment; however, Fhimah had an air-tight alibi and was found not guilty. The trial judges recommended that Megrahi should serve at least 20 years before being eligible for parole. One witness later recanted. Release application and decision to release On 24 July 2009, Al Megrahi's legal team made a request for him to be released from prison on compassionate grounds. Although it was not a precondition for compassionate release, his defence counsel lodged a request to abandon his second appeal on 12 August 2009, shortly after his private meeting with the Justice Secretary in Greenock jail on 4 August 2009. The abandonment of Megrahi's appeal was accepted by the High Court of Justiciary on 18 August 2009. Megrahi had developed prostate cancer, which is usually survivable but can be deadly. The Scottish Secretary of Justice at the time, Kenny MacAskill ordered his release under a 1993 Scottish statute enabling the release from prison of anyone deemed by competent medical authority to have three months or less to live. MacAskill has said repeatedly that he bears sole responsibility for the decision. In addition to the Scottish government's own medical examinations which were the only ones contributing to the release decision, the Libyan government arranged for extra examinations, which involved, among others, Dr Karol Sikora of the University of Buckingham, who examined Megrahi in prison early in July, and requested an \\"urgent\\" decision on returning him to Libya because he believed Megrahi had only a very short period of time to live. Flight to Libya An Afriqiyah Airways aircraft (registration 5A-IAY) ‚Äì the personal aircraft of Colonel Gaddafi ‚Äì was flown to Glasgow Airport on 20 August 2009 to collect Megrahi. The aircraft then flew Megrahi directly to Tripoli. The aircraft was subsequently destroyed in 2011 during fighting to overthrow Gaddafi's regime. Reactions to release Scottish reaction The release divided opinions across Scotland and the Scottish Parliament was recalled from its summer break to receive a statement from and question MacAskill, for only the third time in its ten-year history.the previous two occasions being necessitated by the deaths of Donald Dewar and the Queen Mother. A BBC/ICM poll found that 60% of Scots thought the Scottish Government was wrong to release Megrahi, although 56% said MacAskill should not resign. The poll also found that 74% of those polled believed that, \\"the affair had damaged Scotland's reputation.\\"Majority 'oppose' Megrahi release, BBC News, 28 August 2009. A Ipsos Mori poll of Scots published on 29 August 2009 showed a narrow plurality of 47% to 40% opposed to MacAskill's decision. Views representing the faith communities were generally supportive. Rev. Ian Galloway, the convener of the Church of Scotland's Church and Society Council, said that \\"justice is not lost in acting in mercy.\\" Similarly, the Archbishop of Glasgow, Mario Conti, voiced his personal support for the decision, describing compassion as \\"one of the principles inscribed on the mace of the Scottish Parliament by which Scotland's government should operate\\".FBI chief's attack 'out of order' ‚Äì Conti, BBC News, 24 August 2009. Political opponents of the SNP government attacked the decision. Iain Gray, the Scottish Labour leader, said that \\"The SNP's handling of this case has let down Scotland. Kenny MacAskill's conduct has damaged the Scottish Justice system and, in turn, Scotland's international reputation.\\" Richard Baker, the Scottish Labour shadow justice minister, said the decision was \\"an act of unpardonable folly\\" and called for MacAskill's resignation. Former Scottish Labour First Minister Jack McConnell said that MacAskill had \\"damaged Scotland in a way 'that will take years to recover.\\" Writing in the Telegraph, former Labour MP and Scottish Office minister Brian Wilson wrote that the decision \\"shamed\\" Scotland, and co-opted an anti-war slogan to sum up his anger: \\"Not in our name, Mr MacAskill.\\" However, former Labour MP Tam Dalyell, who has long believed in Megrahi's innocence, said that MacAskill \\"had arrived at the right decision on compassionate grounds\\" and former Labour First Minister Henry McLeish described FBI director Robert Mueller's attack on the decision as 'out of order' saying it was \\"an unfair slur on the Scots justice system\\". UK reaction A poll commissioned by The Times newspaper found that 61% of Britons thought that MacAskill had made the wrong decision, and 45% thought that the release had more to do with oil than Megrahi's terminal illness. Richard Dalton, a former British ambassador to Libya, said while he understood public anger about the release, \\"there are not good reasons why anybody convicted of that crime should be excepted from normal rules which apply for considering release on compassionate grounds.\\" John Mosey, a priest who lost a daughter on Pan Am Flight 103, expressed his disappointment that halting Megrahi's appeal before it went to court meant that the public would never hear \\"this important evidence ‚Äì the six separate grounds for appeal that the SCCRC felt were important enough to put forward, that could show that there's been a miscarriage of justice.\\" The British Government has so far declined to express an opinion on the decision, but has denied that it gave succour to terrorists, and condemned the scenes at Tripoli airport.Lockerbie move 'not terror boost', BBC News, 24 August 2009. Alistair Darling pointed out that as a question of criminal justice, and thus a devolved matter, it would be inappropriate for Westminster to comment on it.Cameron condemns Megrahi release, BBC News, 20 August 2009. Conservative leader and future prime minister David Cameron called the decision \\"the product of some completely nonsensical thinking\\", and \\"wrong,\\" stating; \\"I see no justice in affording mercy to someone who showed no mercy to his victims.\\" He wrote to then prime minister Gordon Brown, calling on him to express an opinion.So why is Brown silent on release of Megrahi?, The Scotsman, 22 August 2009. Local priest Patrick Keegans, who served the Lockerbie community for five and a half years, commented on the general feeling of the community, \\"There's mixed reactions and mixed views. The majority of people are uncertain but a great number are of the same mind as myself. An innocent man has been convicted and they're happy to see him released.\\" Martin Cadman, whose son Bill was killed, said \\"I'm very pleased he has been released on compassionate grounds because I don't think he was the right person to be there anyway. It is just righting a wrong...I think he was innocent and he was not involved. I don't believe he should have been in prison and I'm very pleased he will be back home with his family very soon.\\" Doctor Jim Swire, whose 23-year-old daughter Flora was killed in the Lockerbie bombing, said \\"I don't believe for a moment that this man was involved in the way that he was found to have been involved. I feel despondent that The West and Scotland didn't have the guts to allow this man's second appeal to continue because I am convinced had they done so it would have overturned the verdict against him.\\" British media reaction The Times, the English edition of The Daily Telegraph, and The Economist condemned Megrahi's release. By contrast, The Scotsman, The Herald, The Independent, and the Scottish edition of the Telegraph called it controversial, but the right decision. Kenneth Roy, a former BBC broadcaster and editor of the Scottish Review, accused the BBC of bias in its reporting of Megrahi's release, arguing that it had overplayed public hostility and understated public support for MacAskill's decision. U.S. reaction In the United States, where 189 of the 270 Lockerbie victims came from, the decision was generally greeted with hostility. Most families of the victims were \\"outraged and dismayed\\" by the decision, calling it \\"despicable,\\" \\"ludicrous,\\" \\"appalling,\\" \\"heartbreaking,\\" an \\"absolutely horrible decision,\\" and \\"an absolutely disgusting disgrace.\\" Susan Cohen told The Daily Telegraph: \\"You want to feel sorry for anyone, please feel sorry for me, feel sorry for my poor daughter, her body falling a mile through the air\\". Very few American relatives offered public support for MacAskill's decision, although in May 2010 a sister of one of the victims expressed her desire to visit and forgive Megrahi, saying \\"I want to look him in the eye and make sure he knows our pain... God will judge him\\". She said the decision to release him was \\"more than we could ever expect from Libya if the tables were turned.\\". Polling taken the following week found that 82% of Americans opposed the decision, and 10% supported it. A campaign to \\"Boycott Scotland\\" emerged on the internet, encouraging Americans to halt tourism and boycott Scottish products. The decision was called \\"absolutely wrong\\" by Secretary of State Hillary Clinton, and \\"an outrage\\" and a \\"caving in\\" by Senator Frank Lautenberg. President Barack Obama denounced the decision and Attorney General Eric Holder said that there was \\"no justification for releasing this convicted terrorist whose actions took the lives of 270 individuals.\\" Senator John Kerry, the former Democratic Presidential candidate, said that the decision \\"turn[s] the word ‚Äôcompassion‚Äô on its head.\\" FBI director Robert Mueller, who had been a lead investigator in the 1988 bombing, was \\"outraged at [the] decision, blithely defended on the grounds of 'compassion'\\" and called it \\"as inexplicable as it is detrimental to the cause of justice\\" in an open letter to MacAskill. Independent Senator Joe Lieberman and Democratic Senator Ben Cardin called for an inquiry into the decision. The New York Times opined that \\"for many Americans, his release rekindled the agony and anguish of loss and provoked questions about the notions of compassion and justice used by Scotland to justify its decision.\\" The Chicago Tribune said that \\"MacAskill's self-praising paean to his own mercy ... mocked [the] victims\\" and was \\"feckless.\\" The Los Angeles Times said that \\"MacAskill's blinkered interpretation of 'compassion' took no account of the enormity of Megrahi's crime or his refusal to acknowledge his guilt,\\" and showed \\"no compassion for relatives of the 270 people killed when the jet exploded over Lockerbie.\\" The bombing of Flight 103 was the worst act of terrorism waged against the United States until the attacks on 11 September 2001. Other reactions Saif al-Islam Gaddafi said that MacAskill was \\"a great man\\". Reiterating his belief in Megrahi's innocence, he added that the Justice Secretary had \\"made the right decision\\" and that \\"history will prove this\\". The Libyan English language newspaper Tripoli Post claimed however that MacAskill's statement proved that the Scottish authorities did not take care of Megrahi while he was imprisoned. A letter in support of MacAskill's decision was sent to the Scottish Government on behalf of former South African President Nelson Mandela. Editorials in the leading German language newspapers Frankfurter Allgemeine Zeitung (in Germany) and Die Presse (in Austria), lauded the humanity shown by MacAskill's decision.Families brand release ‚Äòsickening‚Äô and call for boycott of Scotland , The Herald, 22 August 2009. Aftermath ‚Äì claims and counterclaims Immediately following Megrahi's release there were claims and counterclaims concerning alleged commercial deals which had been struck to effect the release. According to some Western press, Colonel Muammar Gaddafi's son, Saif al-Islam Gaddafi, had claimed that the release of Megrahi was linked to trade deals between Britain and Libya, but when interviewed by The Herald shortly after Megrahi's arrival in Libya, Saif al-Islam Gaddafi stated that Megrahi's release was not tied to any oil deals but was an entirely separate issue. Referring to the Prisoner Transfer Agreement (PTA), he continued, \\"People should not get angry because we were talking about commerce or oil. We signed an oil deal at the same time. The commerce and politics and deals were all with the PTA. This was one animal and the other was the compassionate release. They are two completely different animals.\\" It was later discovered that Libyan officials had warned the United Kingdom that consequences for the UK-Libya bilateral relationship would be 'dire' were al-Megrahi to die in Scottish prison, including the cessation of all UK commercial activity in Libya. It was also revealed that Adam Ingram, who stood down as the UK armed forces minister in 2007, received up to ¬£25,000 a year from Argus Libya UK Limited, described as a firm that \\"sniffs out\\" commercial opportunities in the North African country. In the days following Megrahi's release and return to Libya, speculation began to mount as to the possible involvement of the Westminster Government in the Scottish Government's decision, particularly after Saif Gaddafi claimed that Megrahi's case had been discussed during business talks with the UK, and after Colonel Gaddafi thanked Gordon Brown for \\"encouraging\\" the release. This prompted Downing Street to confirm that Brown had discussed a possible release with Gaddafi during the G8 summit in Italy in July 2009, but that a letter sent by Brown to the Libyan leader had stated, \\"When we met I stressed that, should the Scottish Executive decide that Megrahi can return to Libya, this should be a purely private, family occasion.\\" It was also claimed that Business Secretary, Peter Mandelson, had met with Saif Gaddafi on at least two occasions at which a possible release had been discussed. Mandelson confirmed this, but said that he had told Gaddafi that any release was entirely a matter for the Scottish Justice Secretary. He went on to describe as \\"offensive\\" any suggestions that a release had been linked to a trade deal with Libya. On 20 August 2009, the United States government issued an official press release condemning the decision of the Scottish Executive to release Abdel Basset Mohamed al-Megrahi and stated, \\"Megrahi was convicted and sentenced to life in prison for his role in the bombing of Pan Am Flight 103, which blew up over Scotland on 21 December 1988. As we have expressed repeatedly to officials of the government of the United Kingdom and to Scottish authorities, we continue to believe that Megrahi should serve out his sentence in Scotland.\\" On 23 August 2009, ex-CIA analyst, Robert Baer, claimed that the CIA had known throughout that the bombing of Flight 103 had been orchestrated by Iran, and that a secret dossier was to be presented as evidence in Megrahi's final appeal which was to prove this, suggesting that the withdrawal of the appeal to allow release on compassionate grounds was encouraged to prevent this information from being presented in court. The First Minister of Scotland, Alex Salmond, told BBC Radio 4, \\"I think it was the right decision. I also absolutely know it was for the right reasons.\\" Scottish Parliament On 20 August 2009, it was announced that the Scottish Parliament would be recalled the following Monday so MSPs could hear a statement from the Justice Secretary, Kenny MacAskill, and ask him questions. An earlier call for it to be reconvened had been dismissed. Former First Minister Jack McConnell said, \\"The Scottish Parliament has a responsibility to take action to repair some of the damage done. I believe that the Scottish Parliament should make clear that this decision was not made by the people of Scotland and that it does not have the endorsement of the Scottish people. The special sitting of the Scottish Parliament took place on 24 August 2009. The Scottish Justice Minister was strongly criticised by opposition Parties for his decision throughout the session, but maintained he had made the right one, telling the parliament, \\"It was my decision and my decision alone. I stand by it and I'll live by the consequences.\\" He was supported in this by several members of his own party. The Scottish Justice Minister also claimed that sending Megrahi to a hospice in Scotland, would have created a \\"travelling circus\\" with such a high-profile patient. Many MSPs questioned the reasons behind the decision; the Scottish Conservative Party justice spokesman Bill Aitken MSP stated, \\"The SNP government has demonstrated a degree of amateurishness which has caused us embarrassment. Scotland's international reputation has taken a real hit in this respect...the UK government doesn't come out of this too well either.\\" He further added that there were inconsistencies between what Lord Mandelson and Colonel Gaddafi's son had said concerning the decision. On 25 August 2009, Strathclyde Police told The Times that \\"We were asked how many [officers] it would take in our opinion. In terms of guidance we were not asked whether we could do this,\\" about the possibility of keeping Megrahi in a safe house in Scotland. The police comments apparently contradicted those made by the Justice Minister. The police later issued a second statement, after being contacted by the Justice Department stating that there was, \\"absolutely no difference between the position of Strathclyde Police and the information communicated by the Justice Secretary to Parliament. We informed government that the policing operation required for compassionate release of Mr al- Megrahi in Scotland, and the security implications, would have been highly substantial.\\" A Scottish government spokesperson later reiterated that cost was not a factor in deciding to send Megrahi back to Libya as they would have borne the cost of any safe house provided in Glasgow. A full debate on the decision was held in the Scottish Parliament on 2 September, the first full day of the Parliament's return from its summer recess. On 11 January 2010, it was announced that Scottish MPs were due to question Alex Salmond and Kenny MacAskill about the release of al-Megrahi. The Scottish Affairs Committee held the hearing at Westminster as part of an investigation into communication between the Scottish and British governments; in particular, how such communication worked in the case of the decision to release al-Megrahi. According to Salmond, applicable protocols were followed, and both the US and UK governments were informed prior to the release. UK Government The British Prime Minister, Gordon Brown, faced mounting criticism over his silence on the issue, particularly after he took time to send a letter of congratulations to the England Cricket team on their victory in the 2009 Ashes series while failing to comment on the Megrahi release. On 25 August 2009, he told a press conference at Downing Street that he was \\"angry\\" and \\"repulsed\\" by the reception Megrahi had received in Libya. He refused to comment on the Scottish government's decision to release Megrahi but stressed that the UK Government had played \\"no role\\" in the matter. Documents released in September showed that Jack Straw, the justice secretary did initially agree with the Scottish Executive that Abdelbaset al-Megrahi should be excluded from a prisoner transfer agreement with the Libyans. Then three months later, Straw decided that such an exclusion was not worth the risk of \\"damaging our wide- ranging and beneficial relationship with Libya.\\" A letter dated 19 December 2007 stated that the decision to include Megrahi in the scope of the agreement reflected the \\"overwhelming interests\\" of the UK at a \\"critical stage\\" in the \\"wider negotiations with the Libyans\\". In a subsequent letter to Alex Salmond, the Scottish first minister, in February 2008, Straw wrote: ‚ÄúYou ask what I meant by ‚Äònational interests‚Äô. Developing a strong relationship with Libya ‚Ä¶ is good for the UK.‚Äù Allegations of BP lobbying In July 2010, in response to suggestions that BP may have been involved in lobbying for the release of Abdelbaset al-Megrahi, Scotland's First Minister Alex Salmond wrote to Senator Kerry saying: \\"I can say unequivocally that the Scottish Government has never, at any point, received any representations from BP in relation to AI-Megrahi. That is to say we had no submissions or lobbying of any kind from BP, either oral or written, and, to my knowledge, the subject of AIMegrahi was never raised by any BP representative to any Scottish Government Minister. That includes the Justice Minister to whom it fell to make the decisions on prisoner transfer and compassionate release on a quasi-judicial basis. Where BP has admitted that it played a role is in encouraging the UK Government to conclude a Prisoner Transfer Agreement (PTA) with the Libyan Government. I must make clear that the Scottish Government strongly opposed the PTA and the memorandum that led to it was agreed without our knowledge and against our wishes.\\"Alex Salmond‚Äôs letter to Senator Kerry Caledonian Mercury, 23 July 2010  2011 Scottish Parliament election  Despite speculation that this would affect the re-election prospects of politicians involved, at the time of the Scottish Parliament general election, 2011, a Scottish National party (SNP) supporter said that the decision had been mentioned by very few voters during the election campaign. Subsequently, MacAskill won election to a redrawn constituency of Edinburgh Eastern in the 2011 Scottish Parliament election. Despite notionally facing a deficit of 550 votes, MacAskill won by over 2000 votes., while his party, in a surprise landslide, increased from 47 seats to win 69 out of a possible 129 seats to become Scotland's first majority government, and the only majority government in the United Kingdom at that time. Party leader Alex Salmond who had rebuffed demands from US senators to travel to America to explain the decision to a US Senate committee, was re- elected with an increased majority to his Aberdeenshire East constituency, to remain as First Minister for a further five years. The Labour Party, who repeatedly attacked the SNP on the Megrahi release in the run-up to the election, performed less well in the Scottish election, falling from 46 to 37 seats. Death On 20 May 2012, Abdelbaset al-Megrahi died at home aged 60, his brother Abdulhakim told Reuters on Sunday. His health had deteriorated quickly, Abdulhakim said, and he died at 13:00 local time (11:00 GMT). Megrahi's sister told the Libyan Wal news agency that his funeral would take place at Tripoli's main cemetery on Monday, following early afternoon prayers.

History The MVCC proper was founded on 18 July 1861. The club is recognised as the oldest sports club of Uruguay, having been the pioneer in the practise of cricket, field hockey, association football, rugby union and tennis. In 1868, the MVCC played its first international cricket game against Argentine Buenos Aires Cricket Club. It is the oldest international match registered in South America and was played on MVCC's ground in La Blanqueda.El Origen Brit√°nico del Deporte Argentino by V√≠ctor Raffo, Gr√°fica MPS (2004) - The MVCC played its first association football match in 1878, between MVCC and a visiting ship. This was the first organised match in Uruguay. In 1881, the MVCC played its first club match against the Montevideo Rowing Club. MVCC also took part of the first international match involving an Uruguayan football squad, when faced the \\"Buenos Aires Team\\" at Montevideo in 1889.\\"Museo del MVCC\\" on MVCC website In 1983, the MVCC first played the Club Universitario de Buenos Aires (C.U.B.A.), and has played them annually ever since. In 1974 and 1975, the MVCC swimming teams won the summer championships in swimming and diving. The ladies' field hockey team won the local championships in 1987, 1989, 1993 and 1997, and men's team won its first championship in 2000. The club also competes in athletics, cycling and tennis. Ground Its original ground was known as \\"La Blanqueada\\" or the \\"English ground\\", but in 1889, it moved from its original location to make way for a military hospital to a new site nearby. This was also known as \\"La Blanqueada\\" or the \\"New Ground\\" to distinguish it from the original site. The new site was purchased by debentures that members bought. The MVCC moved a third time in 1945 to near the town of Sayago. It moved for a fourth time to Carrasco, in 1955, where fields were shared by The British Schools of Montevideo. In 1996, the MVCC moved yet again to Solymar on the outskirts of Montevideo. Montevideo Cricket Club in history , p4, retrieved 31 August 2009 Rugby English cricket clubs were the incubators of rugby in South America, although rugby has survived much better in these countries than cricket has.Richards, p54, Chapter 2 Practising the Games of the Anglo-Saxon... It has been claimed that MVCC played rugby football as early as 1865, but the first certain match was between Uruguayans and British members of the MVCC in 1880. One observer, apparently disdainful of the Britons mixing with the \\"natives\\", found it: :\\"...at the same time sublime and ridiculous... [that the] young sons of distinguished families practising the games of the Anglo-Saxon in their youth and young Englishmen of blond Albion, face to face ... and on all sides [were] people strangely dressed who ran and shouted, pushed, fell, rose and finished by joining to form now a circle, now a pyramid, now a compact mass in which one could only distinguish heads without shoulders, legs without bodies and hands without arms.\\" Carlos E. Cat, also known as \\"Charlie\\", was a member of the MVCC, and was also president of the club in 1946. In 1950, the Campeonato Uruguayo de Rugby was inaugurated and continues today. The first game was between the MVCC, and Carrasco Polo Club. MVCC had some success in the 1950s, winning the national title 3 times. In recent years however, the club has had to live in the shadows of Montevideo's two powerhouses: Carrasco Polo Club and Old Christians Club.

As of 2006 the Hamburger Morgenpost was the second-largest newspaper in Hamburg after Bild Zeitung. History and profile Building of the publishing company in Bahrenfeld in 2005 The Hamburger Morgenpost was founded in 1949 by the Hamburg section of the Social Democratic Party (SPD) with a circulation of 6,000 copies. Until the late 1950s, the circulation increased to 450,000 copies. When Bild Zeitung was brought out by the Axel Springer publishing house as a second tabloid serving Hamburg, the circulation of the Hamburger Morgenpost declined steadily. Due to the existing competition with other newspapers, such as the 1948 re-founded Hamburger Abendblatt, there was a decline in interest in political party-owned newspapers in Hamburg. The SPD sold the newspaper following financial problems in the mid-1970s. After having several owners, the Gruner + Jahr publishing company bought it in 1986. In 1989, its circulation had fallen to 135,000. In 1999, Gruner + Jahr sold the newspaper in to Frank Otto and Hans Barlach. In 2006, the BV Deutsche Zeitungsholding, a company of David Montgomery's Mecom Group and Veronis Suhler Stevenson International, bought the newspaper. In 2009, Mecom Group sold it to the Cologne-based private publishing company DuMont Schauberg.

The Hamburger Morgenpost included Charlie Hebdo cartoons on its front cover on January 8 and other publications such as Germany's Berliner Kurier and Poland's Gazeta Wyborcza reprinted cartoons from Charlie Hebdo the day after the attack; the former depicted Muhammad reading Charlie Hebdo whilst bathing in blood. At least three Danish newspapers featured Charlie Hebdo cartoons, and the tabloid BT used a Charlie Hebdo image depicting Muhammad lamenting being loved by \\"idiots\\" on its cover. The newspaper was attacked by an arsonist on January 11, possibly relating to the cartoons.

He belonged to a dynasty that claimed descent from the Majapahit Empire of Java, and kept residence in Gelgel, close to Bali's south coast. Reign Dalem Di Made was one of the fourteen sons of the ruler Dalem Seganing. After the death of the former, dated 1623 in one source, he succeeded to the throne of Gelgel. The main source for his reign, the Babad Dalem, is a work from the 18th century, and the account of his reign is not entirely coherent. The Babad Dalem praises the royal splendour of his court in glowing terms, and provides a wealth of details about the noblemen tied to his court.I Wayan Warna et al. (tr.) Babad Dalem; Teks dan Terjemahan. Dinas Pendidikan dan Kebudayaan Daerah Tingkat I Bali 1986, pp. 94‚Äì5. Another historical text, Babad Ratu Tabanan, provides details about a military expedition to Java in his reign. The Balinese army, led by the vassal lord Gusti Wayahan Pamedekan, was met by Sultan Agung of Mataram (r. 1613‚Äì1646) and was decisively defeated.A.A. Gde Darta et al. (tr.), Babad Arya Tabanan dan Ratu Tabanan. Denpasar: Upada Sastra 1996, pp. 100-1. Loss of power The last section of the Babad Dalem relates that the powers of the king eventually declined, and that various noblemen left Gelgel. The chief minister of the king, Anglurah Agung (d. 1686), usurped power, and the old ruler was forced to flee to the highland village Guliang in the modern Bangli regency, where he finally died. Loyal aristocrats were later on able to support his two sons and defeat Anglurah Agung. A new royal palace was built in Klungkung (Semarapura), four kilometers north of the old Gelgel residence.Margaret J. Wiener, Visible and invisible realms. Power, magic, and colonial conquest in Bali. Chicago & London: The University of Chicago Press 1995, pp. 128-9. The eldest son of the deceased king, Dewa Agung Jambe I, was established as ruler, but unlike his predecessors he was unable to wield power over entire Bali.Helen Creese, \\"Sri Surawirya, Dewa Agung of Klungkung (c. 1722-1736): The historical context for dating the Kakawin Parthayana\\", Bijdragen tot de Taal-, Land- en Volkenkunde 147 1991. The island was in effect split up in nine autonomous kingdoms, a situation that would endure until the 19th century.A. Vickers, Bali, a paradise created. Singapore: Periplus 1989, p. 56‚Äì8. External accounts of reign From non-Balinese sources it is known that the Gelgel kingdom still made claims over Blambangan in East Java, Lombok, and Sumbawa (including its eastern part, Bima), in the 1630s.Hans H√§gerdal, \\"‚ÄòFrom Batuparang to Ayudhya; Bali and the Outside World, 1636-1656\\", Bijdragen tot de Taal-, Land en Volkenkunde 154 1998, pp. 70-1. The Dutch East Indies Company (Vereenigde Oost-Indische Compagnie or VOC) tried to gain Gelgel as a political ally against the Muslim Mataram kingdom in 1633, which failed. Later, Bali fought a series of wars on its own with Mataram over the possession of Blambangan, in 1635-1647. In the end, the Balinese influence over Blambangan prevailed. According to VOC sources, the death of a Gelgel ruler in 1651 led to internal conflicts on Bali.J.K.J. de Jonge, De opkomst van het Nederlandsch gezag in Oost-Indi√´, Vol. VI. 's-Gravenhage: Nijhoff 1872, p. 94. Later on, from 1665, the Dutch entertained contacts with a new lord of Gelgel, Anglurah Agung of the Balinese accounts. This Anglurah Agung is mentioned by both Balinese and Dutch texts as having been killed in battle in 1686.H.J. de Graaf, \\"Goesti Pandji Sakti, vorst van Boeleleng\\", Tijdschrift voor Indische Taal-, Land- en Volkenkunde 83. The actual date of death of Dalem Di Made is in doubt. A number of Balinese sources give the date 1642. It has also been suggested that he was the ruler who died in 1651, or that his reign ended as late as c. 1665.H. Creese, 'Balinese Babad as Historical Sources; A Reinterpretation of the Fall of Gelgel', Bijdragen tot de Taal-, Land- en Volkenkunde 147 1991. He is the first Gelgel ruler who is mentioned by name in a Dutch source, since the Balinese prince Raja Sangsit, who settled in Batavia in 1687, claimed to be his nephew.H. H√§gerdal, 'Bali in the Sixteenth and Seventeenth Centuries; Suggestions for a Chronology of the Gelgel Period', Bijdragen tot de Taal-, Land- en Volkenkunde 151 1995, p. 118. Family Dalem Di Made had seven consorts: 1-2. Ni Gusti Peling (being two twin sisters); 3. Ni Gusti Pacekan, daughter of Kiyayi di Ler; 4. Ni Gusti Tangkeban, daughter of Gusti Agung; 5. Ni Gusti Selat, daughter of Gusti Kamasan; 6. a daughter of Ki Dukuh Suladri; and 7. a daughter of Gusti Jambe Pule of Badung. He sired nine sons; eight of these are enumerated in the Babad Dalem.

Their song 'Gold' was featured in the hit indie movie Once (film).http://www.interference.ie/about_interference_and_fergus_ofarrell-2/ History Fergus O'Farrell (vocals, piano & guitar) and James O'Leary (guitars) formed Interference during their time in Clongowes Wood College from 1983 to 1986. While in Clongowes they auditioned various friends and referrals to fill out the remaining positions in the band. Maurice Culligan from Ennis joined on piano and keyboard, Kevin Murphy from Cork took up the bass guitar and cello and Cal MacCarthy also from Cork became the band's first drummer. Malcolm MacClancy became Fergus' song-writing partner and the journey began. In 1986 on leaving college the band moved to Dublin and took up residence in the old Winstanley shoe factory (presently Mother Redcaps Tavern & Market) alongside two other promising new outfits, The Hothouse Flowers and The Black Velvet Band. During this time based on the promise of a 'demo' they were selected to perform on the debut edition of 'Borderline' RT√â's (Ireland's National TV station) first youth friendly magazine show. On the strength of that performance, Fergus and the lads were commissioned by RT√â to make an original video to be directed by Gerry Stembridge, one of Ireland's leading filmmakers. The resulting video of 'The Doll' was selected as one of the finest Irish made pop videos of the decade.https://docs.google.com/document/d/1DpFFYJM-A7e0lQJk0p0QByRxnqbADhnApgH4e6-rSYA/edit By early 1987 the band had actually performed more on television than in live venues; one main reason for this was the lack of a full time competent fiddle player, Kevin's brother stepping in when the need arose. On a recommendation from The Waterboys' Steve Wickham, Colm McCaughey joined up...the band was now complete. Now with a completed line-up the band rehearsed, developed and wrote new material with the goal of creating a unique sound to compete with their contemporaries on the Irish music scene, during a period of very high quality home grown musical talent. From 1987 to 1988 they were being touted by the music press as the next breakthrough act with several awe inspiring showcases and support slots including some with their old housemates, The Hothouse Flowers. After one such show in City Hall in Cork (with the Flowers) one reviewer wrote, '...the support act was so powerful you almost forgot who you were there for...I witnessed the auspicious performance in Cork when they played with the Hothouse Flowers . Though some might describe them as a little rough around the edges, Interference positively bewitched the audience' (Cork Tribune, July 1988). Then due to overwork and over-stress, Fergus, who suffers from Muscular Dystrophy developed nodules on his vocal cords. He was forced to stop singing in early 1988 for fear of further damaging his voice. It was an indefinite stop, nobody being able to place a timeframe on when he might be able to perform live again. To keep themselves busy, some of the members of Interference loaned their musical talent to some of the other bands doing the rounds. Maurice joined up with the Black Velvet Band and Vinnie Kilduffs' Rocking Chairs, Colm became Niall Toners fiddle man in Hank HalfHead and the Rambling Turkeys. Colm and Kevin became a string duo (violin & cello) and sessioned with just about everybody making a record in Dublin, as well as appearing as guest musicians for several travelling bands. James went back to college to study architecture (and became one) but Cal decided his path led elsewhere. He left the band in the summer of 1988 to pursue other avenues. Late in 1988, after months of inactivity for Interference as a working unit, events began to take shape, once more drawing the lads together again. Fergus's voice was practically back to normal, he had been moonlighting with Colm and Kevin as a three-piece calling themselves 'The Back Lane Boys' and as with the first few outings with Interference they were making waves, this time on the acoustic circuit. After some guest appearances from James and Maurice at Back Lane Boy's gigs it was decided to reform the full band and a nationwide search began for a new drummer. Several drummers were tried out including Willie Walsh, who after only a few gigs decided his path lay elsewhere. For a one-off showcase in Mother Redcaps Tavern, their former home, it seemed only right that they were joined for the evening by old cronies Jerry Fehily and Leo Barnes from the Hothouse Flowers for a memorable gig. A newfound enthusiasm existed, months of rehearsals were endured along with 35 auditions for a new drummer, new material was tried out, and eventually in early 1990 when Ray McCann, a Londoner (and Jazz drummer by trade) came along, everyone knew the hard work had been worth it. The Band decamped to Schull in west Cork (Fergus's hometown) for a month to develop a new set with Ray, away from all the distractions of the big cities and returned to Dublin with something they had never previously tried...they were going to hit the road. Their schedule took them all over the country for most of the next year, from Kerry and Cork to Limerick, Clare and Galway to Northern Ireland and even across to The UK for a show-stopping performance in London's' Mean Fiddler Club at the request of Dave Fanning who was putting on several Showcase gigs of unsigned Irish Bands for the music industry. On returning to their old stomping grounds in Dublin they played a brace of gigs in Dublin's Trinity College where their new sound and electrifying performance received not one but two standing ovations on each night. They followed this up with slots at both the Trinity and UCD Freshers Balls winning the accolade in the reviews of both as 'Best band of the night'. On foot of these performances they were asked to play the 1990 Trinity Ball, a very coveted engagement. The review from this show read \\"...thus they have an image amongst the music intelligentsia as being something of a supergroup. An image compounded by the fact their music is a mix of virtually everything the boys listen to. Interference play with such energy and confidence and musical obsessiveness that they throw most of their comtempories to shame...\\" (Entertainment TCD, College review 1990). Next up was the New York Music seminar and the Festirock festival in Dijon, France. The next couple of years were spent trying for the elusive record deal, eventually realising if you want something done...Interference embarked on a project of financing and installing their own recording studio. Much of the expense for this was dealt with from intense gigging around the country, the balance was begged borrowed and donated, bringing along with them on several trips two wide eyed teenagers, Glen Hansard and Mic Christopher who would open for them as the 'Blotto Brothers'. These two went on to create The Frames and Mary Janes respectively. In 1992 Ray left; it would seem that Interference' achilles heel is drummers, and were joined by Billy Gegarthy formerly of the Swinging Swine on Drums and Ronan Gleeson on second guitar. Studio In 1993, having converted Fergus' house into a 16 track recording studio with bedrooms and a kitchen, the band embarked on their recording career. Creating their own record label 'Shack' they recorded and released 'Looking For Someone' as part of a 4 track EP. Billy had decided he wanted to do live work, not studio, so again Interference found themselves drummerless. Binzer, the Frames' drummer stepped in to record the single and John Huxton toured with the band promoting it. The song reached number 15 in the charts and received great critical acclaim, being cited as one of the records of the year by Larry Gogan in his yearly roundup that Christmas. Fergus, who was now a wheelchair user due to the slowly progressing MD, was becoming less convinced that a record deal was ever going to come his way. Once again it was decided to do it themselves and the task of making the debut album began. Their album From a starting point of some 100 songs a short list of 30 and a final selection of twelve songs were chosen for the record. The next twelve months or so was spent working on this music, drawing in an extraordinary collection of international musicians to complement their own skills including D√≥nal Lunny, Fred Parcell, Liam O'Maonlai and Jerry Fehily, Katell Keineg and Maria McKee along with some local 'senior' musicians like Maurice Roycroft (Maurice Seezer), Honor Heffernan, Maria Doyle Kennedy, James Blennerhassett, Glen Hansard, Conor Brady, Robbie Casserly, Dave McCune and Paul Moore, to name but a few. The result, a beautifully crafted work justly placing Interference in the 'wow' section of your local HMV. At this point Whelan's, the live music venue were dipping their toes into the record label world and decided that they could do worse than make the Interference album their first release (after all, the work was all done, right down to the artwork). The album 'Interference' was released to fantastic reviews and sizeable airplay in 1995. The band continued to gig, albeit with yet another lineup change; Ronan had moved on and was replaced by Cian Roche and released another single 'Vinegar Girl' a collaboration with Frames frontman Glen Hansard. Again the single did well, the reviews were good, the coverage on TV and radio more than fair, but alas there was still no interest from an international record company. They all came and had a look but for whatever reason they all left empty handed. In 1994 Joey Pleass joined the band, having previously been with both Hank Halfhead and The Dixons. He was no stranger, it was however just to keep the gigs going while Interference searched for the permanent drummer they still needed. When Joey couldn't sit in the band could always call on Jerry Fehily, longtime collaborator and honorary Interference person. The following couple of years were bittersweet for the band, a couple of nuptials, a new permanent drummer was found in the shoes of one Justin Healy, ex Forget Me Nots and Golden Horde sticksman, some amazing residencies, Whelan's in particular, a few country roadtrips, and Paul Tiernan also joined the live line-up to take some of the pressure of Fergus playing guitar and singing harmonies and backing vocals. Great fun was also had in the studio working with other bands, and learning more about production and engineering from the likes of Kieran Kennedy, Maurice Roycroft and Gavin Friday and Dan Dan Fitzgerald, but in the end Interference called it a day. Late summer of 1996, Interference played their last live gig in Dublin's Redbox, some new material was aired and as usual well received. Since then the lads have continued to be part of the music scene, playing as session musicians, guesting with others, and getting involved with other projects. Fergus moved his studio down to Schull and continued writing and recording for himself, working with the likes of Maria Doyle and Kieran Kennedy, Paul Tiernan and Maurice Roycroft. Kevin has toured the world with Gavin Friday and formed a new band 'Igloo' with Cian. Colm became a television news cameraman but continues to play fiddle, doing a 5-year residency with the Blades frontman Paul Clery in the Cajun Kings in Whelan's, until they decided they wanted their Sundays back. James went back to architecture and builds stuff and Justin continues to be a session drummer while still working away with various pop and rock combos, Lir being one regular gig. Paul returned to solo work and is dividing his time between Ireland, Wales and France. Comeback That is until early summer in 2002...Gavin and Marc, the long suffering backroom 'staff' had a desire to put the band back together again. Each member was approached and asked what they thought of a reunion gig. The overwhelming response was yes. A plan was then hatched and the result was a return to live performance in Schull on 14 September. A full house, an Indian summer's night (the gig was transferred to outdoors due to ticket demand) and a buzz amongst the gathered crowd not seen by the Interference gang for many years. They brought the house down. The line up was a true Interference collective, Paul, Colm, Kevin, James, Cian, Justin and Fergus were joined for the night by Dan Fitzgerald (previously the band's producer) on percussion and Cal MacCarthy returned on drums. This appears to have kick started a renewed interest in the band with several radio shows picking up on the band, in particular Philip King and Tom Dunne. Having just played as special guests to The Frames during their set on Mic Christopher's anniversary concert in late November, there were further rumours of more gigs to come. Other voices December 2002 brings a new lease of life for the band with an invitation from Phillip King to join a line up of new talent he intended showcasing in early 2003 in a 13-part television series entitled 'Other Voices: Songs from a room'. Frames frontman Glen Hansard hosted a week of concerts in Dingle, all of which were recorded for television. Interference joined up with the assembled musicians including The Frames, Maria Doyle Kennedy, Nina Hynes, Damien Rice and Mundy and performed a memorable acoustic set. Everyone involved agreed that it was one of the week's highlights. Fergus joined Maria Doyle Kennedy for a couple of songs during her performance and Paul Tiernan even managed to squeeze in a solo set for himself. Over the Christmas period Band Producer DanDan Fitzgerald and Fergus decided the time was right to re-release the cult 'Interference' album. New up to date artwork was arranged and a fresh faced CD of the near impossible to get album was produced. A radio edit of the song Public Address has also been released for radio only, a blatant anti war song with strong reference to the first Gulf War, it seemed a suitably ironic message for the current climate as we approach another conflict in the Middle East. Fergus gave an in-depth interview to national newspaper The Examiner, his first for a number of years in January 2003 and they responded by printing a full page spread on the band, Fergus and plans for the future. Work began on new songs for possible single release and Fergus and the boys continue to pop up for the odd guest appearance, most recently as guests of old friends The Frames during their gigs in Whelan's in Dublin. An appearance on Pat Kenny's radio show during Valentine's week drew an enormous response and has led to even more interest in the band with Pat inviting the band to perform on The Late Late Show, Ireland's premier television show. The Phillip King inspired 'Other Voices' series is to be launched in late February and will be aired in early March for a thirteen-week run.

Set in 'Electronic City', its protagonist is a superhero far from the 'classic' hero profile: a short, chubby and not-powered Spanish man ('aspa√±ol' as is called in the series). He risks his life time and again to save the city, using gadgets picked up at the Electronicaweb store. A chapter usually develops this way: a monster or a criminal attacks the city, C√°lico tries to stop it (always unsuccessfully), goes to Electronicaweb, gets a new gadget and saves the day. Some \\"bloopers\\" are displayed during the credits, at the end of the episode. Although the series displays many humorous events, the episodes include much Spanish foul language, so viewer discretion is advised. Even though C√°lico is the main character, many side series have run with it, featuring many characters from the original series.

It was first introduced to the public at the 2001 North American International Auto Show. If the car had gone into full production, the C7 would have represented one of the most expensive performance vehicles ever produced in America and the world at the time.  The beginning  Within four years of the end of World War II, Italian car makers such as Ferrari, Maserati, and Germany's Mercedes Benz were already offering Grand Touring cars and sports cars. Despite the fact that American machinery had won the war, America had little in the way of automotive offerings at the time that was comparable to certain vehicles and segments of the mentioned car makers of Europe. Briggs Swift Cunningham II of Greens Farms, Connecticut was convinced that America should build Grand Touring cars and American sports cars that could effortlessly compete with the very best that Europe had to offer. Cunningham's family had funded the founding of Procter and Gamble, the Baltimore and Ohio Railroad and the Bank of Ohio and he could afford such ambitions. West Palm Beach Working from a factory established in West Palm Beach, Florida, Briggs Weaver (former chief engineer of Indian Motorcycles), Phil Walters (race car driver and chassis designer), and John (Jack) Donaldson led a team which developed a line of automobiles. Together, they would produce a series of \\"firsts\\". The first modern American sports car, the C-1, was an aluminum-bodied, front-engined, V-8 powerhouse, a design that became the template for subsequent American manufacturers. The first modern American Grand Touring car, the C-3, was seen as the equal of Europe's best, but with a distinctive American approach. The Ultimate American Sportscar In 1952, the Cunningham C-4R was released in both coupe and roadster configurations. Powered by the original Chrysler 331 Hemi V-8, the 400 horsepower car weighed 2400 pounds. It would be ten years before another American sports car could challenge the C-4R for performance. That car, the Shelby Cobra, now an American performance icon, was directly inspired by the Cunningham C-4R. Carroll Shelby knew about Cunningham when he introduced the Cobra. In 1952, Shelby was driving for Aston Martin at Le Mans against the C-4R and lost to them. Shelby even copied Cunningham's paint scheme, which was white cars with two blue racing stripes, which Shelby reversed. Cunningham's efforts were big news in America. At one point Briggs and his cars appeared on the front cover of Time Magazine (April 26, 1954). The Time Magazine writer, thinking that the operation was financially successful, remarked to Briggs that he seemed to have made a small fortune from his motorsports efforts and asked him how he had done this. Briggs answered by saying \\"start with a large fortune\\". Closing of the factory In 1955, Briggs closed the factory after producing just 37 cars; he had been unable to turn a profit. Briggs then established a successful race car team and Jaguar cars made him their eastern US distributor. Briggs also pursued his love of competitive sailing. He won the America's Cup in 1958. Modern Cunningham In 1993, writer and former racer Lawrence (Larry) Black recognized that America lacked a Grand Touring car and decided to attach the Cunningham identity to a modern Grand Touring car. Black approached Stephen Norman, owner of the BMW dealership in downtown Seattle. Norman provided the initial capital for Black's efforts to resurrect Cunningham as an American auto manufacturer. Briggs Swift Cunningham II was elderly and in poor health, but his only son, Briggs Swift Cunningham III, was so interested that he bought out Steve Norman's interest in the firm. Virtually Integrated Manufacturing In 1993, Larry Black had come up with a novel idea for organizing and reducing the costs of operating a new car company. Called V.I.M. or virtually integrated manufacturing, this approach was the reverse of Henry Ford's Vertically Integrated Manufacturing, which sought to own and control the entire process of manufacturing, from raw materials to distribution of finished product. Since there was a significant degree of unused manufacturing capacity in the automobile industry, it would be possible to create a \\"virtual\\" car company, where Cunningham Motor Cars would be a design, engineering and marketing firm while other firms with excess capacity would be willing to manufacture and build the major components as subcontractors. It might even be possible to enlist the support of one of America's big three auto manufacturers as the source of power-trains for the project. Black sought advice from American automotive journalist David E. Davis, the founder of Automobile Magazine. Black asked Davis about Bob Lutz, who was well thought of in the enthusiast community. Davis advised Black about contacting Lutz, who was then President of Chrysler Corporation. Chrysler had been the second engine supplier to Cunningham (after Cadillac) in the 1950s. The reception was positive. Lutz was a Cunningham enthusiast and even had a signed C-4RK race photograph in his office. Cunningham and Chrysler By order of Lutz, Chrysler engineers developed and produced a prototype engine, a V-12 331 c.i. By some accounts the Cunningham project also contributed to a re-kindled interest within Chrysler for their famed \\"Hemi\\" engines so that work began to bring \\"the Hemi\\", a modern line-up of the well known, accomplished and famed engine architecture back into mass production and to market. Cunningham's efforts continued on other fronts as well. Black, the managing partner of Cunningham, thought it crucial to establish creditability for the \\"new\\" Cunningham by once again building 1952 Cunningham C-4Rs. An operation to build continuation C-4Rs was formed in Lime Rock, CT, at the race track designed and built by one of the original Cunningham team drivers, John Fitch. Media Attention The role of the continuation operation, which was hand building C4Rs for the first time in almost half a century, was to gain favorable press attention and remind the potential customer base what Cunningham had represented to American automotive history. Many auto and general interest publications sent correspondents to test the C4Rs being built in Lime Rock, including Car and Driver, Automobile Magazine, Road and Track, Forbes, London's Sunday Times, the New York Times and a number of European car publications. The coverage generated great interest in the upcoming modern Cunningham, now being called the C7. Interest was gathering for the \\"virtual car company\\" idea as well. Forbes Magazine would later put Bob Lutz on their cover under the words \\"Bob Lutz's Secret\\", the business model that Larry Black had first shared with Lutz in 1995. The real secret was how little money would have to be raised to launch the new company. Careful financial research predicted that an 80% savings would be realized over a conventional automobile start-up. Daimler/Chrysler No one involved could have predicted the consequences of Mercedes merging with Chrysler, which was in the offing. The Germans saw the new C7 Cunningham as a threat to their Maybach, much like they later would also thwart Chrysler's Supercar project,http://www.allpar.com/cars/me412.html the ME Four-Twelve which was well into development and intended to be brought to production as a Halo car for the Chrysler brand as a testament to their engineering prowess.http://www.thecarconnection.com/tips-article/1005564_chrysler-stuns- with-me-four-twelvehttp://jalopnik.com/the-chrysler-me-four-twelve-could-have- been-one-of-amer-1412737412 Subsequently the C7 project and support within the new Daimler/Chrysler evaporated. Lutz left Chrysler and became the CEO of Exide Batteries and Cunningham lost their automaker ally. Cunningham needed a \\"Big Three\\" sponsor again. Efforts to develop the modern Cunningham continued, since the basic idea of having a \\"virtual\\" car company build an American Grand Touring car and market it under the Cunningham brand was inherently strong. Cunningham/GM Once again, David E. Davis intervened. Since the first Cunningham race cars were Cadillac powered, Davis suggested that the partners approach General Motors. Lutz said that he didn't know anyone at General Motors, so Davis arranged for Black and Lutz to meet with GM executives Rick Waggoner (CEO) Wayne Cherry (head of design) and Arv Mueller (GM Powertrain). This meeting served to remind GM that in 1950 Cunningham raced Cadillac based cars at Le Mans and the 50th anniversary of that event was approaching. Black was now consulting with Arv Mueller, the head of GM Powertrain, on what would be the GM approach to a Cunningham power plant. Once again, a V-12 configuration was selected as the market demanded an exotic engine in an exotic car. The precise layout came from Black, who requested a 60 degree angle between the two banks of cylinders. The reason for the request was simple: Black recalled hearing the stirring exhaust notes of Ferrari race cars in his youth, all of which used 60 degree V-12s. Despite there being a design proposal that Black and Cunningham had presented to Lutz, he selected a retired designer from Chrysler to draw the Cunningham C7 exterior. As Brock Yates would later write in Car and Driver, this was a missed opportunity. None of the Chrysler designer's submissions appealed to Briggs or Black, so once again David E. Davis came to the rescue. When asked by Black who was the best independent designer in Detroit, Davis' immediate answer was Stewart Reed. Unknown to Black or Davis, Lutz was already asking the same thing of his people and they gave the same answer: Stewart Reed. Stewart Reed design The initial Stewart Reed design submission was approved by Black, Lutz and Cunningham and the refinement process began. What emerged was stunning; a broad shouldered, muscular and very American Grand Touring car. The debut was just six months away and there are few fabrication firms that could handle such a deadline for a show car. Reed suggested Special Projects in Plymouth, Michigan and he and Black met with their principal, Kenny Yanez. Yanez agreed. In the interim, Lutz had chosen another fabrication firm, but despite having been paid $750,000 in advance, they produced nothing. As a result, Reed and Black had to go back to Yanez and see if he could still do the project. Yanez again agreed and just days before the show, it was finished. Cunningham today The debut at the 2001 Detroit show was a triumph for the concept of the modern Cunningham, but internal politics halted any further progress. The car's striking design and the low cost of the project so impressed GM that they made Bob Lutz Vice-Chairman of GM. Larry Black and Briggs Cunningham III were forced out of the firm by Lutz, eventually leading to a lawsuit. Both the original Cunningham cars and the continuation cars are highly valuable, benefiting from Briggs' racing legacy and are investment grade vehicles. The \\"Lime Rock\\" cars (the continuation C4Rs built in Lime Rock, CT) are worth some multiple of their original purchase price. The Cunningham family maintains involvement in high performance automobiles, with Brian Cunningham having enjoyed many years as a professional race car driver while his father Briggs Cunningham III is a racing team owner and is both Jack Roush and Roger Penske's driver development team owner. Stewart Reed Design proposed a convertible C7 which was well received by media and design professionals, and while plans exist, both the coupe and convertible designs remain unrealized. The cars were never built.

Wendy was first monitored on August 29, 1999, and was designated as a tropical depression by PAGASA the next day. Soon afterwards, the JTWC issued a Tropical Cyclone Formation Alert on the strengthening disturbance. On the first day of September, the JTWC designated the disturbance as Tropical Depression 20W. The storm reached its peak intensity late on September 2 and made landfall on China the next night dissipating not long afterward. Wendy caused 133 deaths and 309.3 million dollars (1999 USD) in damage. Despite this, the name Wendy was not retired. Meteorological history On August 29, 1999, the JTWC began to monitor an area of thunderstorm activity northeast of Yap. By the next day, a broad Lower-Level-Circulation-Center (LLC) had formed with the upper-level environment in the region favorable for additional strengthening. That night, PAGASA began to issue warnings on the disturbance designating it as Tropical Depression Mameng while the system was 400 miles (645 km) northwest of Palau. The system had two primary clusters of strong thunderstorm activity with the highest winds at the edge of the circulation center. The next morning, the JTWC issued a Tropical Cyclone Formation Alert on the developing disturbance because satellite imagery had suggested that a separate LLC was forming in one of the clusters of thunderstorm activity. Early on September 1, the JTWC upgraded the disturbance to a tropical depression designating it \\"20W\\". At the time of the upgrade, the depression had winds of 30 mph (55 km/h) while 175 miles (280 km) east-southeast of Catanduanes Island in the Philippines. Late on September 1, PAGASA upgraded Tropical Depression Mameng (20W) to a tropical storm. Early the next morning, the JTWC relocated the circulation center 200 miles (320 km) to the north as the depression began to approach the island of Luzon. Soon after the storm began to move away from Luzon after its closest approach, the JTWC upgraded Tropical Depression 20W to a tropical storm and assigned it the name Wendy. At 0000 UTC on September 3, the JTWC, PAGASA, and the JMA, the official warning center for the region reported that Wendy (Mameng) had reached its peak intensity with PAGASA issuing its final advisory as it moved out of its area of responsibility. The JTWC reported that peak intensity was 45 mph (70 km/h) (1-min winds), PAGASA reported that peak intensity was 50 mph (80 km/h) (10-min winds), and the JMA reported that peak intensity was 40 mph (65 km.h) (10-min winds). Twelve hours later, the JMA downgraded the tropical storm to a depression. Tropical Storm Wendy continued to move towards the Chinese coast for the next day. As it was nearing land, a Central Dense Overcast, an area of very strong thunderstorms, formed and the tropical storm made landfall about 140 miles (225 km) east-northeast of Hong Kong, and promptly weakened into a tropical depression. The tropical depression dissipated early on September 4 while over the mountains of China. Impact and aftermath Tropical Storm Wendy killed at least 133 people in Wenzhou, China, left 59 missing, and injured 2600 more. The storm was labeled \\"the most serious storm of the century\\" by the local government. 2.21 million people were effected and 277 million dollars (1999 USD) in direct economic losses due to the storm. The tropical storm flooded over 20,000 hectares of farmland, killed 38,000 livestock and caused 35 million dollars (1999 USD) of direct economic losses in agriculture, forestry, fishing and livestock husbandry. The storm also flooded 54 large companies, causing losses of 4.3 million dollars (1999 USD). Rains from the storm destroyed 2000 houses and damaged 8326 more, and disrupting electric power, communication and traffic in some areas of the region.

Captain James Cook named this area to include the bay itself, but also some surrounding locations, stretching north to WhangƒÅrei and south to Mangawhai. However, 'Bream Bay' is loosely used as a collaboration of the three major towns that satellite the main metropolitan area which are RuakƒÅkƒÅ, One Tree Point and Waipu. The physical bay itself geographically spreads from the mouth of WhangƒÅrei Harbour (Bream Head), 22 kilometers south, to the southernmost point of Waipu Cove (Bream Tail). The area also inhabits 3 native reserve islands, located just off the coast of Bream Bay: the Hen and Chicken Islands and Sail Rock Island. Geography Naming Bream Bay was named by Captain James Cook after noticing that the bay's waters were populated with a vast number of bream, although it is now thought he was mistaken with snapper. He also named, in the same vein, Bream Head and Bream Tail which are the areas at the very top and bottom of the bay itself. Districts RuakƒÅkƒÅ RuakƒÅkƒÅ area is made up of RuakƒÅkƒÅ Beach, RuakƒÅkƒÅ Township and Marsden Point. RuakƒÅkƒÅ has seen development due to its proximity to the expansion of the country's only oil refinery at Marsden Point during the 1980s. A recently established timber processing plant at Marsden Point has further stimulated growth. One Tree Point One Tree Point, once considered part of RuakƒÅkƒÅ, has peeled away from the RuakƒÅkƒÅ township as it begins to grow. Along with its off-spring area of Takahiwai, they are positioned along WhangƒÅrei Harbour. One Tree Point is a fast-growing community catering to the lifestyle blocks of the northern Bream Bay area. One Tree Point is made up of One Tree Point, Marsden Cove, Takahiwai and the Eastern blocks of Marsden Point. Access is gained through Port Marsden Motorway via Ruakaka or by marine access. Waipu Waipu is the south-most and largest township community in the Tri-Bream Bay area. Waipu features a variety of attractions ranging from surf beaches, caves, waterfalls to memorable dining. Waipu is fast gaining international immigrants and is seen to be Bream Bay's only chance at a kept rural community, with the socioeconomic growth been delivered by Ruakaka and One Tree Point. Access is gained from State Highway 1 or through back roads via Mangatoroto via Wellsford. Waipu is situated up the river from the coast, at the last navigable place for larger boats. The Waipu Boat Club is now situated at the place where boats used to unload when the coast and river were the main transport links. However it has strong coastal links with Waipu Cove 8 km away and Uretiti Beach 5 km away. Settled by Highland Scots immigrants under the charismatic Rev Norman McLeod in the 1850s, it still has a strong Scottish tradition with its own pipe band, and the Waipu Museum telling the story of the migration. The Islands The Hen & Chicken Islands and Sail Rock Island are the nature reserve islands located just off the coast of Bream Bay. There is no human population on any of the three islands. Demographics The statistical area of Bream Bay, which covers 235 square kilometres between Waipu and WhangƒÅrei Harbour but excludes the settlements of Waipu, Ruakaka, Marsden Point and One Tree Point, had a population of 2,073 at the 2018 New Zealand census, an increase of 432 people (26.3%) since the 2013 census, and an increase of 579 people (38.8%) since the 2006 census. There were 738 households. There were 1,080 males and 990 females, giving a sex ratio of 1.09 males per female. Of the total population, 441 people (21.3%) were aged up to 15 years, 294 (14.2%) were 15 to 29, 996 (48.0%) were 30 to 64, and 342 (16.5%) were 65 or older. Figures may not add up to the total due to rounding. Ethnicities were 87.6% European/PƒÅkehƒÅ, 21.3% MƒÅori, 3.0% Pacific peoples, 2.5% Asian, and 1.7% other ethnicities. People may identify with more than one ethnicity. The percentage of people born overseas was 13.9, compared with 27.1% nationally. Although some people objected to giving their religion, 60.6% had no religion, 27.8% were Christian, and 3.3% had other religions. Of those at least 15 years old, 267 (16.4%) people had a bachelor or higher degree, and 315 (19.3%) people had no formal qualifications. The median income was $30,300. The employment status of those at least 15 was that 768 (47.1%) people were employed full-time, 279 (17.1%) were part-time, and 57 (3.5%) were unemployed. Climate The region's geographical location results in warm humid summers and mild winters. Typical summer temperatures range from 22 ¬∞C to 26 ¬∞C (72 ¬∞F to 79 ¬∞F). Ground frosts are virtually unknown. The hottest months are January and February. Typical annual rainfall for the region is 1500 - 2000 mm. Winds year-round are predominantly from the southwest.

Franklin bells (also known as Gordon's Bells or lightning bells) are an early demonstration of electric charge designed to work with a Leyden jar. Franklin bells are only a qualitative indicator of electric charge and were used for simple demonstrations rather than research. This was the first device that converted electrical energy into mechanical energy in the form of continuous mechanical motion, in this case, the moving of a bell clapper back and forth between two oppositely charged bells.  History  This device is named for Benjamin Franklin, an early adopter who used it during his experimentation with electricity. It was discovered by the Scottish inventor Andrew Gordon, Professor of Natural Philosophy at the University of Erfurt, Germany. About 1742 he invented a device known as the \\"electric chimes\\", which was widely described in textbooks of electricity. Franklin made use of Gordon's idea by connecting one bell to his pointed lightning rod, attached to a chimney, and a second bell to the ground. One of his papers contains the following description: > In September 1752, I erected an Iron Rod to draw the Lightning down into my > House, in order to make some Experiments on it, with two Bells to give > Notice when the Rod should be electrified.  Design and operation  The bells consist of a metal stand with a crossbar, from which hang three bells. The outer two bells hang from conductive metal chains, while the central bell hangs from a nonconductive thread. In the spaces between these bells hang two metal clappers, small pendulums, on nonconductive threads. A short metal chain hangs from the central bell. The central bell's chain is put in contact with the inner surface of a Leyden jar, while the outside surface of the jar is put in contact with the metal stand. Thus, the central bell takes its charge from the inner surface of the jar, while the outer surface charges the two bells on the conductive chains. This causes the bells to have a difference in electrical potential equal to that between the inner and outer surfaces of the jar. The hanging metal clappers will be attracted to one bell, will touch it, pick up its charge, and be repelled; they will then swing across to the other bell, and do the same there. Each time the clappers touch a bell, charge is transferred between the inner and outer surfaces of the Leyden jar. When the jar is completely discharged, the bells will stop ringing.

For service at the Battle of the Alamo and the Goliad massacre, the heirs were eligible to file for the land grants. Researchers on the defenders of the Alamo sometimes relied on the military land grants, but did not always check through the muster lists.Lindley (2003), pp. 52, 57 Although the claim was filed in 1861, it was never registered due to a lack of filing fee.

Football career In the 1880s Sutcliffe played for Burnley. One of the more notable matches he played in was an 1885 FA Cup tie against Darwen Old Wanderers. The match finished 11‚Äì0 to Darwen, a club record defeat for Burnley which still stands in the 21st century. He finished playing in the mid-1880s, after finding himself unable to compete with England international Joe Lofthouse in a match against Blackburn Rovers.. He retained a role at the club, joining the committee. After encouragement by Preston North End's William Sudell, Sutcliffe took up refereeing, and became eligible to officiate League matches from 1891. He soon gained a reputation for obstinacy,. and did not shy from controversy. In one match between Blackburn Rovers and Liverpool he disallowed six goals. After provoking the ire of the crowd in a match at Sunderland, he reputedly had to sneak out of the ground disguised as a policeman. He stopped refereeing League matches in 1898, though he continued as a linesman for a further decade.. For a period of four years at the end of the 19th century, he refereed a number of Home Internationals. In 1908 he was a founder and the first president of the Referees' Association. Sutcliffe became a Burnley director in 1897, and joined the Football League Management Committee the following year. He immediately proposed that the League should discontinue the test matches, which were used to determine promotion and relegation. The test matches were contested in a round-robin league format comprising four teams ‚Äì the bottom two from the First Division and the top two from the Second Division. The two teams with the best test match record gained (or retained) First Division status, the other two were demoted. In 1898 Burnley had just gained promotion through the test matches in dubious circumstances. The final test match was between Burnley and Stoke. Other results meant both clubs knew a draw would be sufficient to give them First Division football. Neither team attempted to score, in what the Staffordshire Advertiser called a \\"fiasco\\".. Sutcliffe proposed that the First Division be expanded by two clubs, thus giving space for Blackburn Rovers and Newcastle United, the two clubs adversely affected by the arranged test match. In 1905 Sutcliffe, along with Roger Charnley (son of Tom Charnley, the FA President), formed Wigan Town A.F.C. who played in the English Combination and the Lancashire Combination. The club, who played at Springfield Park, folded in 1908. In 1912, Charles Sutcliffe helped establish the legality of the league's retain-and-transfer system when he successfully represented the club Aston Villa during the Kingaby case. Former Villa player Herbert Kingaby had brought legal proceedings against his old club for preventing him from playing. Erroneous strategy by Kingaby's counsel resulted in the suit being dismissed.David McArdle, LLB PhD, The Football League's player registration scheme and the Kingaby case, accessed 16 December 2012 From 1915 until his death in 1939 Sutcliffe was responsible for devising the schedule of fixtures for Football League matches. Using a closely guarded system featuring red and white squares in the manner of a chessboard, Sutcliffe's method created a durable fixture list, the first draft of which usually required only the most minor revisions. For providing the fixture list, the league paid him 150 guineas. Sutcliffe's method, taken on by his son, continued to provide fixtures until 1967, when the process was computerised. After 38 years on the Football League's Management Committee, Sutcliffe became League President in 1936. This coincided with the League taking a firm stance against football-based gambling, of which the most common type was the football pools. First, advertisement for pools were banned from football grounds, then the League took further action, sparking what became known as the \\"Pools War\\".. In February 1936, the League announced that the existing fixture schedule was to be abandoned. Fixtures would be announced 48 hours in advance, in an attempt to make it more difficult for pools companies to produce coupons. Sutcliffe, as both a senior League administrator and the man responsible for devising fixtures, was central to the plan. Though Sutcliffe was determined to see the pools companies defeated, the chaos caused by the uncertainty over fixtures meant the scheme lasted just two weeks.. In August 1922 Sutcliffe, in his capacity as a representative of the Football League, opened Doncaster Rovers' Belle Vue ground. Sutcliffe strongly believed that British football was superior to that played elsewhere, and took an isolationist stance on related issues. When the Home Nations withdrew from FIFA in 1928, Sutcliffe was among those who voted for withdrawal.. In response to overseas tours by the Home Nations, he declared \\"I don't care a brass farthing about the improvement of the game in France, Belgium, Austria or Germany\\" and accused FIFA's one member one vote system of \\"magnifying the midgets\\". Six years later he branded the 1934 World Cup \\"a joke\\". His antipathy extended to English clubs who attempted to sign foreign players. When Arsenal attempted to sign Rudy Hiden from Wiener AC in 1930, Sutcliffe wrote \\"The idea of bringing foreigners to play in league football is repulsive to the clubs, offensive to British players and a terrible confession of weakness in the management of a club\\". The FA agreed, and introduced legislation the following year which in essence banned foreign players from playing in England. The ruling remained in place until 1978. Personal life Sutcliffe was born in Burnley on 8 July 1864 to John Sutcliffe, who worked as a solicitor, and Jane Pollard Brown. One of four sons, he trained as a solicitor and joined his father's practice. His legal qualification came around the same time as his retirement from playing football. With his first wife, Annie, he had two sons and a daughter. Annie died in 1924, and in 1926 Sutcliffe married Sarah Pickup. He died at home on 11 January 1939. At the next Burnley match a silence was held, and the crowd sang Abide with Me..

It was also known since 1959 that, for every k and l there exist k-chromatic graphs with girth l.. In connection with these two results and several examples including the Chv√°tal graph, Branko Gr√ºnbaum conjectured in 1970 that for every k and l there exist k-chromatic k-regular graphs with girth l.. The Chv√°tal graph solves the case k = l = 4 of this conjecture and the Brinkmann graph solves the case k = 4, l = 5\\\\. Gr√ºnbaum's conjecture was disproved for sufficiently large k by Johannsen, who showed that the chromatic number of a triangle-free graph is O(Œî/log Œî) where Œî is the maximum vertex degree and the O introduces big O notation..

The name derived from the Roman goddess Diana. During the analysis of the mineral tantalite and niobite he concluded that it does contain an element similar to niobium and tantalum. The symbol was Di. Following the rediscovery of niobium in 1846 by the German chemist Heinrich Rose, Friedrich W√∂hler, Heinrich Rose, R. Hermann and Kobell analysed the minerals tantalite and columbite to better understand the chemistry of niobium and tantalum. The similar reactivity of niobium and tantalum hindered preparation of pure samples and therefore several new elements were proposed, which were later found to be mixtures of niobium and tantalum. Rose discovered pelopium in 1846, while Hermann announced the discovery of ilmenium in 1847. In 1860 Kobell published the results on the tantalite from a quarry near Kimito a village in Finland and columbite from Bodenmais a village in Germany. He concluded that the element he found was different from tantalum, niobium, pelopium and ilmenium. The differences between tantalum and niobium and the fact that no other similar element was present were unequivocally demonstrated in 1864 by Christian Wilhelm Blomstrand, and Henri Etienne Sainte-Claire Deville, as well as by Louis J. Troost, who determined the formulas of some of the compounds in 1865 and finally by the Swiss chemist Jean Charles Galissard de Marignac Both tantalum and niobium react with chlorine and traces of oxygen, including atmospheric concentrations, with niobium forming two compounds: the white volatile niobium pentachloride (NbCl5) and the non-volatile niobium oxychloride (NbOCl3).

In 1984 Fox donated a painting Sunlight Effect painted by his uncle (ca. 1889) to the National Gallery of Australia, in memory of his mother. Fox studied science at the University of Melbourne, concurrently earning a Diploma of Education. He taught at Scotch College from 1928‚Äì32, then spent four years in Europe where he witnessed the rise of Fascism. On returning to Melbourne, he joined the Movement Against War and Fascism and the Communist Party of Australia. He was to remain a member until 1970, long after most 'comrades' had quit as a reaction to the Stalinist purges. Career His career as a journalist began in 1936 with a pamphlet entitled Spain!. He moved to Sydney in 1940, and immediately started writing for left-wing weeklies, starting with The Voice of State Labor. He took up painting, producing an array of left-wing propagandist posters, and covers for his many booklets, such as Australia's Guilty Men, a 32-page diatribe against (inter alia) Prime Minister Robert Menzies for his dealings with Axis countries in the early days of WWII. When the State Labor Party collapsed in 1944, he took up with The Tribune where he worked from 1946 to 1955. In 1955 he married Mona Brand, a fellow Communist and idealist, who was to become a respected playwright.

Named in memory of the Dutch designer Piet Zwart, it was inaugurated in 2001. The current postgraduate study program structure had been introduced earlier in 1999. Overview The Piet Zwart Institute is the center for postgraduate study and research of the Willem de Kooning Academy, Rotterdam's art school. The de Kooning Academy is a part of Hogeschool Rotterdam, a university of applied sciences. The Piet Zwart Institute currently includes five Master study programs and one research program: Masters in Fine Art, Retail Design, Interior Architecture, Media (with the specializations Networked Media and Lens-Based Media) and Education in Art, and a research program Communication in a Digital Age. The Fine Art and Networked Media programs are housed in a building separate from the main Academy building on the Karel Doormanhof 45 in central Rotterdam. It is also the main location for in-house public lectures. The main academy building houses the study programs in Interior Architecture, Retail Design, Education in Art and Lens-Based Digital Media, and the research programs. Study programs All Master study programs are two year full-time courses. They are based on the premise that contemporary art, design and media only exist in a wider social and cultural context, and connect artistic production and research with the public realm of discourse and display. With the exception of the Master of Education in Art which is jointly organized with the CodArts conservatory and whose degree is specific to the Dutch education system, all programs are held in English and have a highly international and multidisciplinary body of students and teachers. The programs are regarded as rigorous. The institute is highly selective with each of the programs only admitting up to 12 students annually. Since 2000, the study and research programs of the Piet Zwart Institute have published books on contemporary art, media and design in collaboration with publishing houses like Revolver Books, The MIT Press and OpenMUTE. The institute also collaborates with local organizations such as TENT/Centrum voor Beeldende Kunst, Witte de With, V2 Institute for the Unstable Media, Boijmans van Beuningen Museum, WORM, Duende, Het Wilde Weten and Goethe-Institut Rotterdam. The academic degree of Masters is validated by the NVAO, the joint accreditation organization of the Dutch and Flemish ministries of education. Research programs Since 2002, the Piet Zwart Institute initiated three research programs, Media Design Research (2002‚Äì2006, led by Matthew Fuller) and Communication in a Digital Age (since 2008, led by Florian Cramer) and Cultural Diversity (since 2010, led by Hugo Bongers). Research fellows included Lev Manovich, Bureau of Inverse Technology, jodi, Simon Yuill and Alessandro Ludovico. Among the publications were an early handbook on open content licenses written by Lawrence Liang and the anthology Software Studies (ed. by Matthew Fuller, The MIT Press, 2008). Location The Piet Zwart Institute is spread over two locations in the center of the port town of Rotterdam, Netherlands, on the Karel Doormanhof 45 and the main building of the Willem de Kooning Academy, Blaak 10. International talent The Institute is regarded as selective with rigorously intensive and highly international study programs. Students get the chance to develop, present and exhibit their work and research nationally and internationally during their time of study, and are exposed to meetings and opportunities with prominent international practitioners and theoreticians in their respective field of study. Students also get the opportunity to visit international events relevant to their study and work, such as art biennials, media and design festivals and cultural studies conferences. The Fine Art and Networked Media programs also hold annual graduation shows at major art venues in Rotterdam; in the past, they included the Boijmans van Beuningen museum, TENT, Centrum voor Beeldende Kunst Rotterdam and WORM. Recent exhibition titles include: Never Odd or Even and Global/Positions/Systems, 2009, My Travels with Barry and YOU ARE PWNED, 2008. Staff All study and research programs are based on a small core staff and a great number of visiting tutors. Course directors have been Anke Bangma (1999‚Äì2007) and Vanessa Ohlraun (since 2007) for Fine Art, Raphael van Amerongen (2001‚Äì2007) and Margaret Wijnands (since 2008) for Retail Design, Alex Suarez (since 2010) for Interior Architecture, Matthew Fuller (2002‚Äì2006), Florian Cramer (2006‚Äì2010) and Renee Turner (since 2010) for Networked Media, Simon Pummell (since 2009) for Lens-Based Digital Media, Robin Punt (2006‚Äì2010), Mirjam van Tilburg (since 2010) and Jojanneke Gijsen for Education in Art.

Julius's Hoff is also recorded. Hoff and Huif (cf. Scandinavian hov: throne) are Scots for a house or hall. It has been suggested that the name 'Arthur is probably derived from the old Gaelic words Art, a house, and Om, solitary-meaning a retired dwelling or hermitage.

Scottish Monastic Landscapes. Stroud : Tempus. . P. 61  Setting  A road to Alloa and Airth passed by the back of the Forge Row and through the Stenhouse estate; Arthur's O'on stood on the north-east side of this road. Early historian often discuss it along with the Roman fort at Camelon. The building was on the declivity of rising ground, supported by a basement of stones, projecting out from below the lowest course of the building; it was so far from being upon a level area, that a great part of the basement, and four courses of the stones on the south side, were hidden in the earth. The marks of three or four steps, which may have formerly led from the ground to the entrance of the building, were visible at one time. The traces of a broad ditch could be seen at one time on the northern side; suggesting that a regular vallum (rampart) and fosse (ditch) had once surrounded the building.  Description of the building  The interior of Arthur's O'on. The O'on was built of dressed freestones which were not mortised into each other and no mortar was used. Each stone had a lewis hole in it to allow secure lifting with a hinged pair of metal callipers. In appearance the O'on was shaped like a beehive, being circular on plan with a domed roof. The perpendicular height, from the bottom to the top of the aperture, was 22 feet; the external circumference at the base, 88 feet; internal circumference, 61 feet; external diameter at the base, 28 feet; internal diameter, 19 feet 6 inches; circumference of the aperture, 86 feet 1 inch; diameter of the aperture, 11 feet 6 inches; height of the door from its basis to the top of the arch 9 feet; breadth of the East facing door at the base, 6 feet inches; height, from the ground to the top of the key-stone of the door, 10 feet 6 inches breadth of the wall at the base, measuring at the door, 4 feet 3 inches; thickness of the wall where the arch springs, 3 feet 7 inches; and height of the basement on which the building stands, 4 feet 6 inches. The door is said to have had an iron gate, the removal of which by the Monteiths of Cars brought a curse upon the family. Round the interior of the building there were two string courses at distances of 4 ft. and 6 ft. respectively above the paved stone floor, and in several places, notably over the door, there may have been much weathered carvings in which eagles and the goddess Victory are said to have been represented.Inventory of Ancient Monuments A huge stone stood in the interior, possibly an altar or the base of a bronze statue. The O'on may date to the period of occupation of the Antonine Wall. Carvings The figure of a Roman eagle was at one time visible, chiselled upon the pavement. Other insignia of the Romans are said to have formerly ornamented its walls, but when Edward I was destroying all important Scottish antiquities, he was only induced to spare the 'temple beside Camelon', after the inhabitants of the neighbourhood had already destroyed all the Roman sculptures, and inscriptions which existed upon it. The initial letters J. A. M. P. M. P. T., were recorded by Sir Robert Sibbald, engraved on a stone inside the building, under a figure of Victory, with the head and part of the handle of a javelin. The following reading was suggested :- Julius Agricola Magnae Pictatis Monumentumn Posuit Templum. The holes in some of the blocks may have only related to the method of raising the blocks into position during construction.The History of Scotland. George Buchanan, James Aikman. Archaeology at the site Various remains of antiquity have been discovered near its site, such as the stones of querns or handmills, made of a type of lava resembling that now obtained from the mill-stone quarries of Andernach on the Rhine; fragments of pottery, and the vestiges of what was supposed to have been a potter's kiln. The horns of 'great cows' were found, suggesting deliberate burials of religious significance. The antiquarian Edward Lhwyd presented the Revd Patrick Wodrow in 1699 with a 'patera' or pottery libation bole that had been found near the O'on.Keppie, Lawrence (2012). The Antiquarian Rediscovery of the Antonine Wall. Edinburgh : Society of Antiquaries of Scotland. . P. 56  Purpose  Interior ground plan of the temple. The discovery in a chink of the masonry of a brass finger from a statue, suggested that the O'on was primarily a triumphal monument, or tropaeum, erected to commemorate a victory. The quality of the structure bears the stamp of legionary workmanship, being too elaborate for a purely local masons and it appears to have been deliberately sited to be visible from the Antonine Wall. The building was, it seems, unique in Britain and, as suggested, most likely a temple as it was located too far from a fort or road to have been a bathhouse or mausoleum. Its proximity to a spring has resulted in the suggestion that it was dedicated to a water goddess. At the time of its destruction it was one of the best preserved Roman buildings in Britain. A broken relief from Rose Hill on Hadrian's Wall depicts Victory, an eagle, and a round domed building under a tree, which may represent a structure like Arthur's O'on. Victory was normally worshipped in the forts, but the easiest interpretation is that the O'on was a tropaeum, an official monument dedicated to Victory, and also commemorating the campaign, led by Quintus Lollius Urbicus, that led to the establishment of the Antonine Wall.  Destruction  It was demolished to line a mill dam on the River Carron by Sir Michael Bruce of Stenhouse in 1743, an act of vandalism that was reported to the Society of Antiquaries in London and led to paroxysms of rage in the correspondence of leading antiquarians. In the summer of 1748 the stones were swept away in a flood.Keppie, Lawrence (2012). The Antiquarian Rediscovery of the Antonine Wall. Edinburgh : Society of Antiquaries of Scotland. . P. 89 In the late 1980s an American researcher, Robert Mitchell, claimed that the stones of the O'on were not scattered beneath the Carron waters at all but lay beneath the grounds of the former Carron Iron Works, a renowned Industrial Age factory. Historians agree that Sir Michael Bruce of Stenhouse had dismantled Arthur's O'on in 1743 and used almost all of the stones as a facing on a dam which fed water from the Carron River to a mill, with the water exiting further downstream. He later sold this mill property to the developers of the eventual Carron Iron Works. Although historians of the time claimed that the dam, and the rather heavy O'on stones, were somehow washed away in a flood as would a tree or common organic debris, Robert Mitchell uncovered substantial documentary evidence that the dam (and the O'on stones) actually remained intact, due to the Carron Iron Works covering the dam and incorporating the mill race into a system to feed the factory's furnaces. As a byproduct of covering the dam, the Carron Iron Works actually altered the course of the rather narrow Carron River to a modest degree. On-site investigation by Robert Mitchell in the late 1980s lead to a discovery of an entry point into the former mill race in the exact area where his documented evidence had pointed. Upon entry into the system, he encountered a heavily silted system of brick construction. When these findings of the likely site of the stones of Artur's O'on were announced by Burke's Peerage in the late 1980s, he held up the possibility of recovery and reconstruction. However, since Scottish antiquities authorities do not consider the possible site of a buried mill dam as a \\"scheduled\\" site, and since the overall site is covered with thick concrete foundations, the prospects for actual recovery do not appear high. Of course, the suggestion that the Carron has changed course in this area has been questioned by other researchers.Falkirk History Society Sir Walter Scott remarked, with respect to the destruction of this 'great glory of the Roman remains in Scotland,' that, had not the worthy proprietor thought fit to demolish it, it would have turned the heads of half the antiquaries in Scotland. Several members of the Society of Antiquaries tried to find out the foundation of the building in the 1870s, but without success. Its site, however, was thought to be a few yards to the north-east of the Forge Row, at the corner of an enclosure, about fifty feet square, on the estate of Stenhouse. The ground was then used as a washing-green.  The Penicuik House replica  Penicuik House stable block, with domed dovecote replicating Arthur's O'on. The deliberate destruction of Arthur's O'on had so appalled Sir James Clerk, that in 1767 his son, also Sir James Clerk, decided to have a dovecote built, as an exact replica of the temple, on his stable block at Penicuik House. The dovecote still exists.Keppie, Lawrence (2012). The Antiquarian Rediscovery of the Antonine Wall. Edinburgh : Society of Antiquaries of Scotland. .

It is shown on Timothy Pont's map, on that of John Adair and of Sir Robert Sibbald, who in the 16th century recorded it as a 'temple'.Keppie, Lawrence (2012).

With a fortune inherited from her grandfather, maritime trader John Bertram, Emmerton carried on her family's tradition of endowing and supporting charitable good works, including the Bertram Home for Aged Men, the Salem public library, the Seaman‚Äôs Widow and Orphan Society, the Family Service Association, the Salem Fraternity Boys Club and the city's Public Welfare Society, as well as the Society for the Preservation of New England Antiquities (now Historic New England), of which she was a founding member.\\"Mrs. Emmerton Died Early Today\\", Salem Evening News, August 15, 1912 By the age of twenty eight she was a board of director for the Charter St. Home now the North Shore Medical Center/Salem Hospital. In 1907, she joined with a group of women to explore forming a settlement house in Salem and to do \\"experimental work\\". By the following year, these women had begun to offer classes in sewing and other crafts and activities in an old Seaman's Bethel next to the historic Turner-Ingersoll Mansion, which was also known as the house that Nathaniel Hawthorne had written about in his novel The House of the Seven Gables. In 1908, she bought the Turner-Ingersoll house, and in 1910 the organization opened in its hybrid form.Register of Historic Places nomination, 2005 She hired Joesph Everett Chandler as the architect. Like many American settlement house founders and workers, Emmerton saw exposure to historic environments and stories as a way for new immigrants to absorb democratic values and practices. \\"If, as is generally conceded, the settlements do the best Americanization work,\\" she wrote, \\"should not this settlement excel whose home is the ancient House of Seven Gables, the foundations of which were laid by the first immigrants who came here long ago, strangers in a strange land?\\"National Register of Historic Places nomination , 2005, p. 28 Over time, Emmerton continued to expand and reorganize the compound, eventually moving four additional colonial-era buildings to the site and working with the colonial revival architect Joseph Everett Chandler to restore them.Stevenson, Edward M. 1979.

After the wreck of the schooner Shark the characteristic was changed to fixed red because the captain of the Shark was said to have confused it with Long Island Head Light in Boston Harbor. Following a fire in 1897 it was rebuilt with a square tower attached to the house. The light was operated at reduced intensity during World War I because of concerns over German submarines. It was automated in 1919 when a gas beacon replaced the oil light. The structure was sold for $160 with a clause requiring the purchaser to remove it from the island. While moving the house down to the water, a cable snapped and the house slid into the water. The tower was destroyed in 1927. The island is now a bird sanctuary.

It is the most frequently occurring type of cave. It can also form in other rocks, including chalk, dolomite, marble, salt beds, and gypsum.https://www.nps.gov/subjects/caves/solution-caves.htm  Process  Bedrock is dissolved by natural acid in groundwater that seeps through bedding-planes, faults, joints and so on. Over geological epochs these openings expand as the walls are dissolved to become caves or cave systems. The portions of a solutional cave that are below the water table or the local level of the groundwater will be flooded.  Limestone caves  The largest and most abundant solutional caves are located in limestone. Limestone caves are often adorned with calcium carbonate formations produced through slow precipitation. These include flowstones, stalactites, stalagmites, helictites, soda straws, calcite rafts and columns. These secondary mineral deposits in caves are called speleothems.  Carbonic acid dissolution  Limestone dissolves under the action of rainwater and groundwater charged with H2CO3 (carbonic acid) and naturally occurring organic acids. The dissolution process produces a distinctive landform known as karst, characterized by sinkholes and underground drainage. Solutional caves in this landform‚Äîtopography are often called karst caves.  Sulfuric acid dissolution  Lechuguilla Cave in New Mexico and nearby Carlsbad Cavern are now believed to be examples of another type of solutional cave. They were formed by H2S (hydrogen sulfide) gas rising from below, where reservoirs of petroleum give off sulfurous fumes. This gas mixes with ground water and forms H2SO4 (sulfuric acid). The acid then dissolves the limestone from below, rather than from above, by acidic water percolating from the surface.

The white, pavilion-like building, designed by architect John B. Parkin and completed in 1965 was considered by many as an example of the Modern Movement in architecture. Located atop a hill on Wynford Drive, by the major intersection of Eglinton Avenue and the Don Mills Road in the district of North York, its architecture and location made it a well-known landmark in the city. It was identified by the Toronto Society of Architects as one of 96 significant buildings and public spaces in Toronto built between 1953 and 2003. It became the centre of debate when, in November 2002, the Aga Khan Foundation acquired the site and announced plans to demolish the building in order to construct a $300 million Ismaili centre, a museum of rare Islamic art and a public park. Toronto Star architecture critic Christopher Hume lauded the building prior to its demolition: > Situated on a height of land in Toronto's north end, the simple, modular > edifice exemplifies the ideal of the building in a park.

Launched at the 1956 Earl's Court Motorcycle Show, the Valiant had a 192 cc (11.7cu in) flat-twin engine but was expensive and criticized for its underpowered engine. Development In the mid-1950s Velocette had two very different lines of motorcycles. Alongside the larger and more conventional M series, they produced a series of enclosed small capacity four-stroke flat twins for the commuter market, when most of their competitors were producing two-stroke singles. Launched at the Earls Court Show in November 1956 the Velocette Valiant was a development of the Velocette LE. It had a two piece cover that enclosed most of the crankcase and gearbox. The engine was based on the LE engine but differed from it considerably, with the engine converted to air cooling for simplicity and lightness. Revised cylinder heads with overhead valves were used, with the compression ratio increased to 8.5:1 from the LE's 7.0:1. A stronger crankshaft with larger bearings was used to handle the increased power, to the LE's . The engine also featured a bigger crankcase and cast iron cylinders with steel pushrod tubes and alloy heads. It was mounted in a duplex frame with a single top tube. The clutch and four-speed gearbox were the same as those fitted to the MK3 LE but the final drive was through a cast aluminium pivoted fork, with a universal joint to the drive shaft. Front suspension was the same as the LE but rear suspension used Woodhead-Monroe springs with hydraulic damping. Two Amal 363 monobloc carburettors fitted to stub inlet manifolds were linked by a balancing tube. The recommended top speed was . Reception With the 250 cc class being popular in the UK, few enthusiasts were interested in an expensive 200 cc motorcycle, especially one with a four-stroke flat-twin instead of the more familiar four-stroke single or two-stroke twin. 1,600 Valiants were made between 1957 and 1963. Valiant Veeline The 1959 Valiant Veeline (also known as the Vee Line) was the same as a standard Valiant with a 'dolphin' full fairing made of fibre glass that had big windscreen, a fascia panel housing the speedometer and ammeter, as well as a small glove box. The headlamp was mounted on brackets fixed into the fairing allowing adjustment but it did not turn with the forks. Developed as competition for the emerging scooter market, the Veeline still had the underpowered engine of the Valiant and did not sell in sufficient numbers. The big fairing also added to the weight and ¬£21 to the cost and after poor sales Velocette decided to stop production of the version in 1961.

Pythagorean augmented seventh on C (531441/262144 = 1223.46), a Pythagorean comma above the perfect octave. In classical music from Western culture, an augmented seventh is an interval produced by widening a major seventh by a chromatic semitone. For instance, the interval from C to B is a major seventh, eleven semitones wide, and both the intervals from C to B, and from C to B are augmented sevenths, spanning twelve semitones. Being augmented, it is classified as a dissonant interval.Benward & Saker (2003), p.92. However, it is enharmonically equivalent to the perfect octave. Since an octave can be described as a major seventh augmented by a diatonic semitone, the augmented seventh is the sum of an octave, plus the difference between the chromatic and diatonic semitones, which makes it a highly variable quantity between one meantone tuning and the next. In standard equal temperament, in fact, it is identical to the perfect octave (), because both semitones have the same size. In 19 equal temperament, on the other hand, the interval is 63 cents short of an octave, i.e. 1137 cents. More typical meantone tunings fall between these extremes, giving it an intermediate size. In just intonation, three major thirds in succession make up an augmented seventh, which is just short of an octave by 41.05 cents. Adding a diesis to this makes up an octave. Hence, this interval's complement, the diminished second, is often referred to as a diesis.

It was their most successful album thus far, breaking into the Top 30. The album grew out of a theatrical project the band undertook, a version of Robert Louis Stevenson's 1886 novel Kidnapped, staged in Edinburgh. The book and play were set against the backdrop of the Scottish Jacobite movement, and in the course of developing the play, the band came across a considerable amount of 18th- century Scottish poetry that they mined for the album. If the album has a theme, it is change and the tension between old and new. \\"The Weaver and the Factory Maid\\" is about the tension of early industrialization, with a young man celebrating the factory because there are plenty of women for him to pursue, while an old man denounces the factory because of its economic effects. There is a very sharp contrast between the sweet acoustically-driven \\"The Ups and Downs\\" followed immediately by the funky distorted loud guitar in \\"Robbery with Violins\\". \\"Cam Ye O'er Frae France\\" explores this tension in a different way, both in its lyric denouncement of political changes and in the contrast between the poem's traditional Scots language and its sharp electronic guitars. \\"Alison Gross\\" is about a literal change, as an evil witch transforms a man who rejects her into a worm. \\"Robbery with Violins\\" is better known as \\"The Bank of Ireland\\" (in O'Neill's book). A version of this tune was played in the film Titanic. \\"The Ups and Downs\\" is also known as \\"The Maid of Tottenham\\". The satirical \\"Cam Ye O'er Frae France\\" refers to King George I and the Jacobite rising of 1715. Two of the songs on this album originate in Hogg's Jacobite Reliques, while \\"Rogues in a Nation\\" is an adaptation of Robert Burns' poem denouncing the Act of Union in 1707 that united England and Scotland. The title of the album derives from a line in the song \\"Rogues in a Nation\\", here sung a cappella. The sleeve shows a milkmaid on decorated tiles, possibly alluding to the recording venue: \\"Sound Techniques\\" studio, a former dairy, which still has a statue of a cow on the wall. The album uses more overdubbing than any previous album by Steeleye Span. On \\"Hares on the Mountain\\" there are two channels for Peter Knight's mandolins, two for recorders and one for him playing harmonium. On \\"The Weaver and the Factory Maid\\" Maddy Prior is heard on three channels, counterpointing herself. The album saw the band re-introduce the use of drums, driven in part by Rick Kemp's background in rock. After the album was released, the band undertook a US tour, opening for Jethro Tull.

A computer card punch is a computer output device that punches holes in cards. Sometimes computer punch card readers were combined with computer card punches and, later, other devices to form multifunction machines. It is a input device and also an output device. Most early computers, such as the ENIAC, and the IBM NORC, provided for punched card input/output. Card readers and punches, either connected to computers or in off-line card to/from magnetic tape configurations, were ubiquitous through the mid-1970s. Punched cards had been in use since the 1890s; their technology was mature and reliable. Card readers and punches developed for punched card machines were readily adaptable for computer use.The IBM 711 Punched Card Reader's card-feeding mechanism was similar to the IBM 402's card-feeding mechanism Businesses were familiar with storing data on punched cards and keypunch machines were widely employed. Punched cards were a better fit than other 1950s technologies, such as magnetic tape, for some computer applications as individual cards could easily be updated without having to access a computer. Operation The standard measure of speed is cards per minute, abbreviated CPM: The number of cards which can be read or punched in one minute. Card reader models vary from 300 to around 2,000 CPM. If all columns of an 80 column card encode information this translates to approximately 2,500 characters per second (CPS). Cards may be read using mechanical brushes that make an electrical contact for a hole, and no contact if no punch, or photoelectric sensors that function similarly. Timing relates the signals to the position on the card. Cards may be read serially, column by column, or in parallel, row by row. Card punches necessarily run more slowly to allow for the mechanical action of punching, up to around 300 CPM or 400 characters per second. Some card devices offer the ability to interpret, or print a line on the card displaying the data that is punched. Typically this slows down the punch operation. Many punches read the card just punched and compare its actual contents to the original data punched, to protect against punch errors. Some devices allow data to be read from a card and additional information to be punched into the same card. Readers and punches include a hopper for input cards and one or more stackers for cards read or punched. A function called stacker select allows the controlling computer to choose which stacker a card just read or punched will be placed into.

Binary format Binary punched card. For some computer applications, binary formats were used, where each hole represented a single binary digit (or \\"bit\\"), every column (or row) is treated as a simple bitfield, and every combination of holes is permitted. For example, the IBM 711 card reader used with the 704/709/7090/7094 series scientific computers treated every row as two 36-bit words, ignoring 8 columns. (The specific 72 columns used were selectable using a plugboard control panel, which is almost always wired to select columns 1‚Äì72.) Sometimes the ignored columns (usually 73‚Äì80) were used to contain a sequence number for each card, so the card deck could be sorted to the correct order in case it was dropped. An alternative format, used by the IBM 704's IBM 714 native card reader, is referred to as Column Binary or Chinese Binary, and used 3 columns for each 36-bit word. Later computers, such as the IBM 1130 or System/360, used every column. The IBM 1401's card reader could be used in Column Binary mode, which stored two characters in every column, or one 36-bit word in three columns when used as input device for other computers. However, most of the older card punches were not intended to punch more than 3 holes in a column. The multipunch key is used to produce binary cards, or other characters not on the keyboard. Invalid \\"lace cards\\" such as these pose mechanical problems for card readers. As a prank, in binary mode, cards could be punched where every possible punch position had a hole. Such \\"lace cards\\" lacked structural strength, and would frequently buckle and jam inside the machine.

This process led to the permanent division of Bali into several minor kingdoms by the late 17th century. Background and rise Anglurah Agung belonged to a hereditary line of chief ministers in the Balinese kingdom, the Agung family, which claimed descent from the ancient kings of Kediri on Java. He was the son of Gusti Agung Kalanganyar, and was adopted as an infant by his uncle Gusti Agung Kedung, whom he succeeded as minister. He is also known by the names Gusti Agung Di Made or Gusti Agung Maruti. He governed in the age of the Gelgel king Dalem Di Made. Certain Balinese texts indicate that he was involved in warfare on Lombok in 1645; this island was a bone of contention between Bali and the Makassar kingdom of South Sulawesi.H. H√§gerdal, 'From Batuparang to Ayudhya; Bali and the Outside World, 1636-1656', Bijdragen tot de Taal-, Land- en Volkenkunde 154 1998, pp. 70-5. After the death of a Balinese king in 1651, internal wars flared up on Bali. Eventually Anglurah Agung usurped power in Gelgel, and is documented as ruler from 1665. According to Balinese sources he took command at a point when the old king had lost his grip on state affairs and was deserted by his grandees; \\"Kyayi (Anglurah) Agung's statemanship had captured the hearts of many people with his sweet voice and fine words\\".P. Worsley, Babad Buleleng; A Balinese Dynastic Genealogy. The Hague: M. Nijhoff 1972, p. 169. He briefly entertained contacts with the Dutch East Indies Company (Vereenigde Oost-Indische Compagnie or VOC) in 1665-1667. Balinese historiography holds a negative view of Anglurah Agung and portrays him as a power-hungry usurper. Death in battle It seems that he was unable to maintain authority over entire Bali, since other small kingdoms arose at the time, foremost among them Buleleng. In the 1680s a number of aristocrats loyal to the old dynasty of Gelgel, including Gusti Panji Sakti of Buleleng and Gusti Jambe Pule of Badung, attacked the rule of Anglurah Agung. According to Balinese as well as Dutch sources, his end came in 1686, when he fought a battle in Gelgel against the nobleman Batu Lepang. In the heat of the battle, both combatants fell.H.J. de Graaf, 'Goesti Pandji Sakti, vorst van Boeleleng', Tijdschrift voor Indische Taal-, Land- en Volkenkunde 83 1949; A. Vickers, Bali, A Paradise Created. Singapore: Periplus 1989, pp. 56-8. After his death, the scion of the old Gelgel line, Dewa Agung Jambe I (r. 1686-c. 1722), was established as Balinese paramount king in Klungkung, north of Gelgel. However, the new Klungkung kingdom proved unable to wield power over Bali in the way that its predecessor in Gelgel had done.H. Creese, 'Sri Surawirya, Dewa Agung of Klungkung', Bijdragen tot de Taal-, Land- en Volkenkunde 147 1991. Bali therefore remained split in a number of princedoms (Karangasem, Buleleng, Badung, etc.). One of these new dynasties, that of Mengwi, claimed descent from Anglurah Agung.H.

It features a soundtrack by Chris Huelsbeck of Turrican fame. The PlayStation and Sega Saturn ports were released in Japan as . Gameplay The player character travels through a set of precarious tunnels in a high-tech hovercraft. The tunnels are filled with enemy vehicles, choppers and sentry guns which the player has to take out or avoid. Many sections require the player to clear them in a given time limit. The player can upgrade their weaponry. A complete map of each level can be accessed at any time. Development NEON Software began by working on a game which alternated between segments in a hovercraft and segments in a helicopter, both running on the same game engine. Publisher Ocean Software felt the two play styles did not work well together and suggested that they split them into two separate games. The helicopter segments became Viper, while the hovercraft segments became Tunnel B1. A demonstration at the April 1996 European Computer Trade Show impressed crowds, and Sony Computer Entertainment subsequently purchased the rights to publish Tunnel B1 and Viper for the PlayStation in North America. Ocean later sold the North American publishing rights for all versions of the game to Acclaim Entertainment, stating that they wanted to focus more on development. Reception Most reviews for Tunnel B1 highly praised the game's visuals, especially the lighting effects. However, most also remarked that the gameplay, while fast-paced and competently designed, is too simplistic and lacking in variety to maintain the player's interest. Some also criticized the low-to-the-ground perspective. A reviewer for Next Generation felt the game could still be worthwhile so long as the buyer didn't expect much from the gameplay, while Scary Larry and Dr. Zombie of GamePro both contended that \\"a weekend rental\\" would be sufficient to exhaust what enjoyment the game has to offer, and GameSpots Jeff Kitts found it too relentlessly boring to merit attention. The four reviewers of Electronic Gaming Monthly instead contended that Tunnel B1 does manage to combine its impressive visuals with flawed but overall fun gameplay. Shawn Smith and Crispin Boyer elaborated that while it does seem repetitious in the early levels, those who persevere will find the game has a satisfying amount of variety. Rich Leadbetter of Sega Saturn Magazine was pleased that, apart from the replacement of the transparencies with meshes, the Saturn conversion is nearly identical to the PlayStation original, and includes some exclusive content to somewhat make up for the loss of transparencies.

In 2007 he was the Singaporean winner of the S.E.A. Write Award. Critics have responded positively to his writing, noting its \\"passionate, humane\\" style, and observing how his breadth of life experience gave rise to a talent for characterisation plus an ability to blend \\"a sharp sense of observed commentary with historical detail\\".. Early life and education Rex Shelley was born on 27 October 1930. in Singapore, and was of mixed English, Portuguese, Malay and Buginese ancestry.. His father was a shipyard worker and his mother a teacher. Shelley was educated at St. Anthony's Catholic School, and at a Japanese language school for a year during the Japanese occupation of Singapore (1942‚Äì1945). Shelley's first employment was as a carpenter's apprentice, in a shipyard. Following World War II, he graduated from the University of Malaya in Singapore in 1952 with an honours degree in chemistry, which he completed on a university scholarship. He later read engineering and economics at the University of Cambridge, where he was involved in left-wing student politics for a time. Career After graduating, Shelley worked in Seremban in Negeri Sembilan, Malaysia, until May 1965. He then returned to Singapore and began working for a company manufacturing pipes, subsequently starting his own machinery-importing business. He also served on the Public Service Commission (PSC) for over three decades, from 1976 to 2007.. The PSC is a body created by the Constitution of Singapore that appoints, promotes, dismisses and exercises disciplinary control over public officers in Singapore. It has additional responsibility for planning and administering scholarships provided by the Government of Singapore. Shelley was involved in interviewing civil servants as well as students seeking scholarships; he wrote a book entitled How to Interview Well and Get that Job! (2004). For service to the people of Singapore, the Government conferred the Bintang Bakti Masyarakat (Public Service Star) on him in 1978, awarding an additional Bar the following year.. Shelley taught himself to speak Japanese, and edited Words mean Business: A Basic Japanese Business Glossary (1984), a new version of a book first published the year before.. Subsequently, he wrote Japan (Cultures of the World series, 1990) and Culture Shock!: Japan (1993). He was also a self-taught painter and piano accordion player. Fiction writing Shelley began writing fiction late in life, publishing his first novel The Shrimp People. in 1991 at the age of sixty one. The first substantial novel by a Singaporean writer about the Eurasian community in Singapore, it was the best-selling local paperback at the Times bookshop for three consecutive weeks between 22 August and 5 September 1991, and remained in the top five until 11 December that year.\\"Weekend guide\\", The Straits Times, 31 August; 7, 14, 21, 28 September; 5, 26 October; 9, 16, 23, 30 November; 7, 14 December 1991. The work won the National Book Development Council of Singapore Award for works in English the following year despite being up against books by established writers such as Gopal Baratham and Suchen Christine Lim.; ; . He wrote three more books, People of the Pear Tree (1993),. Island in the Centre (1995) and A River of Roses (1998),; . on the same theme within a decade.

According to poet Edwin Thumboo, an emeritus professor of the National University of Singapore, Shelley \\"was a sensitive and acute observer of life. Because he started writing late, the material that generated his fiction was well digested. He brought to bear on it all the insights of an engineer, businessman, administrator, public servant and a person who loved life. His character analysis was therefore penetrating, and his range of characters are fully reflective of the society he wrote about.\\" Associate Professor Kirpal Singh of the Singapore Management University, himself a writer and literary editor, has commented that although Shelley's impact on the Singapore literary scene had been \\"much less than it ought to be\\", his body of work was significant for both the Eurasian community and the wider Singapore society: Shelley was the 2007 Singaporean winner of the S.E.A. Write Award. In August 2009, Marshall Cavendish, a subsidiary of the Times Publishing Group, reissued Shelley's books The Shrimp People and a non-fiction work first published in 1995, Sounds and Sins of Singlish.See ; . In 2015, The Shrimp People was selected by The Business Times as one of the Top 10 English Singapore books from 1965‚Äì2015, alongside titles by Arthur Yap and Daren Shiau.

He graduated from the Tokyo Kaisei School in 1875. He was selected for a government-sponsored study abroad program and attended Columbia University (B.L., 1877) and Yale University Law School (M.L., 1878; D.C.L., 1880). Career When he returned to Tokyo in 1880, Hatoyama opened a law practice, while simultaneously lecturing at the University of Tokyo. He thereafter joined the Rikken Kaishint≈ç political party founded by ≈åkuma Shigenobu and became active in politics. In 1890, at Okuma's urging, he was appointed president of the Tokyo Semmon Gakko, which shortly thereafter became Waseda University. He headed this institution until 1907, although his title was largely honorary in nature. In 1901, he was invited to Yale for its 200th anniversary celebration, and awarded an honorary doctorate in law. He was elected to the House of Representatives in the 1892 general election and was re-elected eight times thereafter. He became House Speaker in 1896. However, a rift developed between Hatoyama and Okuma. Although Hatoyama angled to become foreign minister in Okuma's first cabinet, he was passed over for the post and only served as Vice Minister in 1898. In April 1907, he was removed from his post at Waseda and demoted to board member status. He left the Rikken Kaishinto in January 1908 to join the rival Rikken Seiyukai party. He was elected to the Tokyo Municipal Assembly in 1908. In 1910, he was elected President of the Tokyo Bar Association.

His older great-grandson Yukio Hatoyama is the leader of the Democratic Party of Japan (DPJ) and represents the 9th district of Hokkaid≈ç in the House of Representatives. Yukio became Prime Minister on September 16, 2009, following a win by the opposition coalition in the 2009 elections. His son-in-law was Suzuki Kisabur≈ç, a judge, prosecutor, procurator and Minister of Justice and Home Minister. Family tree  Residence  Hatoyama and his family resided in the Otowa neighborhood of Bunkyo, Tokyo in 1891.

Very soon thereafter it was renamed Greenleaf's Point ‚Äî or Greenleaf Point ‚Äî after James Greenleaf, a land speculator and purchaser of numerous lots in the new city, many of which were located in the vicinity of the Point.

In 1791, he and Pierre (Peter) Charles L'Enfant chose the site for the emplacement of a redoubt of some sort.L'Enfant identified himself as \\"Peter Charles L'Enfant\\" during most of his life, while residing in the United States. He wrote this name on his \\"Plan of the city intended for the permanent seat of the government of t(he) United States ....\\" (Washington, D.C.) and on other legal documents. However, during the early 1900s, a French ambassador to the U.S., Jean Jules Jusserand, popularized the use of L'Enfant's birth name, \\"Pierre Charles L'Enfant\\". (See: Bowling (2002).) The National Park Service identifies L'Enfant as Major Peter Charles L'Enfant and as Major Pierre (Peter) Charles L'Enfant on its website. The United States Code states in 40 U.S.C. 3309: \\"(a) In General.--The purposes of this chapter shall be carried out in the District of Columbia as nearly as may be practicable in harmony with the plan of Peter Charles L'Enfant.\\" They acquired approximately by a deed of trust during that year and confirmed it in a July 25, 1798 executive order. Apparently, L'Enfant intended for a fortification to be placed there, according to his city plan, setting it aside as \\"Military District No. 5\\", because, as one author wrote, the \\"peninsula where the Potomac and Anacostia Rivers met was an obvious, natural military site.\\" This site, sported a \\"one-gun battery mounted behind earth breastworks,\\" possibly as early as 1791 but, at any rate, definitely by 1794. Within a few years, \\"The U.S. Arsenal at Greenleaf Point\\" grew from 28 to more than . By 1803, the \\"Fort\\" was first referred to as an \\"Arsenal\\" and Congress provided money for the construction of additional buildings. During the American Civil War, experiments on new weaponry were performed both at the nearby Washington Navy Yard and at the Washington Arsenal as the Army installation had come to be named. Breechloaders, the Spencer carbine, and the Gatling gun were among the weapons tested on the peninsula. In 1908, the tip of the peninsula had the name Arsenal Point because of its military use at the time. Washington Arsenal was renamed Fort Lesley J. McNair in 1948. From its earliest times the Point was largely ignored by the larger population of the District, much as in a larger sense all of Southwest Washington (referred to as ‚ÄúThe Island‚Äù for its isolation) remained somewhat distinct. L‚ÄôEnfant's and Washington's hopes for bustling river traffic at Buzzard Point wharves never came to be; instead, the area south of Q Street SW and between South Capitol and the Fort retained a largely rural aspect. Wrote an early resident of this period: ‚ÄúFrom the Navy Yard westward along the Eastern Branch [the Anacostia] to Greenleaf‚Äôs Point was a wild stretch of land with here and there a hovel or a house, and a stouring of brick kilns.‚ÄùSunderland, Bryan, ‚ÄúWashington As I Knew It‚Äù, in Records of the Columbian Historical Society, vol. 5. CHS, Washington DC. 1902.) The marshy James Creek, flowing alongside the Arsenal (canalized in 1866 as the James Creek Canal but never connected to the existing Washington Canal) served only as a source of disease, used often for trash dumping. An 1875 survey of Buzzard Point (below Q) found only 36 residences, eight ‚Äúshanties‚Äù and six businesses, and these numbers barely increased over the years.Kraft, Brian D., Old Southwest: A History of a Vanished Neighborhood. MS. 2006 (at Washingtoniana Div of MLK Library, Washington DC). Census numbers show the population peaking at 323 in 1894 (this from the Police Census for that year, found in the Metropolitan Police Annual Report) and then decreasing gradually: 231 in 1900; 185 in 1920; 19 in 1940. The area generally had proportions matched almost perfectly of black and white residents, living largely intermingled and all being of the working class. ‚ÄúFarmer‚Äù was the most common profession until about 1920, when ‚Äúdriver‚Äù replaced it. The few accounts of this 1880-1920 period describe a modest community dominated by tidy truck gardens to the south and west and workers‚Äô houses and some small businesses along the eastern border (South Capitol to First St SW). ‚ÄùIt is bordered on either side by true market gardens in the highest state of cultivation. The fields are interspaced with orchards of small fruit trees and occasionally these miniature farms have buildings set back from the road and profusely surrounded with chickens, stables and farm implements.‚ÄùWash Post, 21 Nov 1886, p. 7. The neighborhood was visited seldom by outsiders: ‚ÄúA stranger is a very strange thing on Buzzard Point.‚ÄùEvening Star, 30 July 1916, p. 48. Deterioration was evident by the 1910s as fields were abandoned and the trash-strewn James Creek Canal was progressively filled in. Unpleasant semi-industrial uses crept down South Capitol Street, most notably trash removal - refuse was hauled (legally or otherwise) to various points along that street and the River Anacostia, and also dumped into the river through the District's new sewage system. As the population decreased District planners tried to plan other uses for this neglected area. (Note that there was no bridge crossing from Buzzard Point across the Anacostia until 1950.) Buzzard Point Pepco Plant. The District's new zoning system of 1920 optimistically implemented industrial zoning in the area of the Point, followed by the 1929 National Capitol Parks and Planning Commission's development planning report intending the area to be covered with railroad spurs and new large-scale manufacturing and utility uses that were unwelcome in other parts of the city. This effort destroyed what little was left of the old rural area without bringing in more than the railroad lines, the 1933 power plant of the Potomac Electric Power Company (PEPCO), and an oil/gas storage facility. During the mid- and late-twentieth century these two major facilities and adjoining smaller ones were mostly closed as new development began from the nearby Navy Yard area. Some boat yards and marinas maintained themselves on National Park Service-owned land along the Anacostia River. Buzzard Point today Audi Field. New residential construction in Buzzard Point. The United States Geological Survey's (USGS) most recent topographic maps identify the tip of the peninsula that contains Fort McNair as \\"Greenleaf Point\\".United States Geological Survey topographic map with locations of Greenleaf Point and Buzzard Point in website of TopoQuest. Retrieved 2009-11-17. The USGS maps also identify a lesser point to the northeast of Greenleaf Point as \\"Buzzard Point\\". (James Creek, which was excavated during the 19th century to become a branch of the [now defunct] Washington City Canal, once separated these two points. Its name persists in the present day James Creek Marina, located between the two named points. In early times, James Creek was also known as St. James Creek.) Although officially the name of only a tip of the peninsula, the term \\"Buzzard Point\\" now serves to identify much or all of an urbanized area south of M Street SW and west of South Capitol Street SW, excluding Fort McNair. The area has long been known as an industrial part of the city. Buzzard Point is close to Nationals Park, and not far from the Waterfront and Navy Yard ‚Äì Ballpark Metro stations. The Buzzard Point waterfront extends from the Fort along the west bank of the Anacostia River as far as South Capitol Street at the Frederick Douglass Memorial Bridge. From west to east along it from the Fort are the James Creek Marina, the former headquarters of the U.S. Coast Guard, Buzzard Point Marina and Buzzard Point Park.

He was trained by his father, the master clockmaker Vinzenz Beha (1764-1868), in his workshop where he built around 365 clocks between 1839 and 1845. At that time V. Beha was already known for the quality of his clocks, he made the so-called Shield cuckoo clocks. In 1845 Johann B. Beha founded his own clockshop in Eisenbach, beginning the manufacturing of his celebrated clocks. Contributions to the construction of cuckoo clocks Model 509 with matching shelf. The clockmaker introduced the following innovations into the construction of cuckoo clocks:Wilhelm Schneider & Monika Schneider. Black Forest Cuckoo Clocks at the Exhibitions in Philadelphia 1876 and Chicago 1893. In NAWCC Bulletin, April 1988, p. 116 * He was the first to equip a Bahnh√§usle style clock case with a cuckoo mechanism in 1854. A milestone in the Black Forest clock history, after this cuckoo clocks became popular and marketed worldwide. Indeed, although the Bahnh√§usle style creator, Friedrich Eisenlohr, had proposed a cuckoo clock in his 1850 original design, however it was not until 1854 when J. B. Beha became the first clockmaker who take it from drawing to reality. * He was also the first to make Black Forest wall and shelf cuckoo clocks with spring-wound movements. Between 1845 and 1850 the first 8-day cuckoos with fusee movements were built. At that time, without exception, the clocks had wooden plate movements. By adopting the English fusse system in his clocks he expanded the export market of cuckoo clocks to the U.K. The main importers of his clocks were Camerer, Kuss & Co., London; Morath Brothers, Liverpool; and Bohringer, Belfast. Camerer Kuss was also the main exporters of Beha clocks to India. * About 1850 Beha made the first oil painted picture frame cuckoo clocks, where the cuckoo was not integrated in the picture. Also about that time, the first cuckoo clocks with moving eyes came into use. * The first one who made cuckoo clocks fitted with musical movements. The cases for Beha clocks came from case/woodcarvers shops located in different towns of the Black Forest such as Waldkirch, Furtwangen, Villingen, V√∂hrenbach and Dittishausen.Kochmann, Karl (2005): Black Forest Clockmaker and the Cuckoo Clock, p. 238 When signed, the Beha clocks bore two types of identifications; either a stick-on label which would be on the case back-board on the inside of the case or the name \\"Beha\\" engraved on one of the two brass fuse√© drum ends. However, it is necessary to emphasize that most of the Beha timepieces were not signed and it is almost impossible to identify a Beha based on the case alone. The case makers that supplied Beha with their cases, sold identical cases to other manufacturers too. So today we can find identical cases, but in fact they were not made by the Beha enterprise. For example, Aaron Ketterer and Theodor Ketterer frequently used the Beha designed and their cases are nearly identical. That is why the mechanism is the crucial part to give a positive attribution. After the Philadelphia Centennial Exhibition of 1876, Johann B. Beha took his two sons, Lorenz and Engelbert, into his firm as partners and the company was refounded as \\"Johann Baptist Beha und S√∂hne\\". While the big factories - Junghans, Kienzle, Philipp Haas und S√∂hne and Werner, and the smaller firms like Dold, Hilser, Gordian Hettich Sohn, Rombach and Maier- developed their cuckoo clock production in response to the growing demand of the new middle- class for a cheaper clock, especially cheaper carvings, the Behas followed a contrary strategy. They did not believe in the success of the mass-produced cuckoo clock. A similar strategy was followed by other Black Forest clock manufacturers such as Emilian Wehrle, Winterhalder & Hofmeier, Maurer und H√∂fler, etc. When Johann Baptist Beha died in 1898, his sons Lorenz (1865 - 1941) and Engelbert (1866 - 1949) continued with the company in Eisenbach. The manufacturing program consisted of; cuckoo/quail clocks, cuckoo clocks with echo, weight operated clocks, spring powered clocks, trumpeter clocks, monk ringing a monastery bell, calendar clocks, etc. The largest export market of Beha clocks was to the United Kingdom and Russia. In Saint Petersburg Beha even operated their own warehouse, from there the clocks were marketed to different countries, but with the outbreak of World War I, the St. Petersburg warehouse was closed.Kochmann, Karl (2005): Black Forest Clockmaker and the Cuckoo Clock, p. 239 The Beha enterprise struggled during the 1920s to recover the lost export market facing extremely difficult economic times and during the 1930s, with the onset of the economic dictatorship of the \\"Hitler Regime\\" in the year 1933, the use of brass and copper was strictly rationed, although the production continued on a very limited scale until 1938. But finally after the World War II the production was stopped forever in 1956.  Awards and recognitions  The company won several awards as well as gold and silver medals for the quality in workmanship and design in different countries, like the Gold Medal of the Vienna World Trade Exhibition of 1873. He was the only Black Forest cuckoo clock maker who was honored in such a way.Wilhelm & Monika Schneider. Black Forest Cuckoo Clocks at the Exhibitions in Philadelphia 1876 and Chicago 1893. In NAWCC Bulletin, April 1988, p. 116 Former honors at the International exhibition in London 1862, and Paris 1867 and at regional exhibitions in Villingen 1858 and Karlsruhe 1861, had also testified to the excellent quality of the cuckoo clocks of Johann B. Beha. For the clocks shown in Philadelphia in 1876, the firm was honored with the meritory medal by the United States Centennial Commission. Further honors followed at the exhibitions in Karlsruhe 1877, London 1885, Freiburg 1877, Chicago 1893 and Strasbourg 1895. Johann Baptist Beha represented the typical Black Forest clockmaker of the 18th and 19th century: experimenting, inventing, self- educated, always seeking solutions with limited theoretical knowledge, creating technical miracles beyond any comparison today.Kochmann, Karl (2005): Black Forest Clockmaker and the Cuckoo Clock, p. 10  Beha clocks as collector pieces  The clocks made by the Beha company are sought-after collector pieces and are part of both private collections and the most reputed museums in the world such as the British Museum,British Museum.

It is a provisional unit assigned to the United States Air Forces in Europe. The current status of this unit is undetermined. The group's World War II predecessor unit, the 406th Fighter Group was assigned to Ninth Air Force in Western Europe. It was awarded two Distinguished Unit Citations for its actions in combat during the Battle of Normandy and the Battle of the Bulge. History : For additional history and lineage, see 406th Air Expeditionary Wing World War II Emblem of the World War II 406th Fighter Group Republic P-47D Thunderbolts including P-47D-28-RA 42-28887 L3-G of the 512th Fighter Squadron, 406th Fighter Group at Y-29 in Asch, Belgium in April 1945 Established as a dive- bomber attack group at Key Field, Mississippi on 1 March 1943, Trained with numerous attack aircraft both at Key Field and at Congree Army Airfield, South Carolina until May 1944. Converted to a Fighter-Bomber group and deployed to European Theater in March 1944. Assigned to Ninth Air Force. Entered combat with P-47 Thunderbolts in May when the Allies were preparing for the invasion of the Continent. Provided area cover during the landings in June, and afterward flew armed-reconnaissance and dive-bombing missions against the enemy, attacking such targets as motor transports, gun emplacements, ammunition dumps, rail lines, marshalling yards, and bridges during the campaign in Normandy. Helped prepare the way for the Allied breakthrough at St Lo on 25 July Moved to the Continent early in August 1944 and continued to provide tactical air support for ground forces. Participated in the reduction of St Malo and Brest. Aided the Allied drive across France, receiving a Distinguished Unit Citation for operations on 7 September 1944 when the group destroyed a large column of armored vehicles and military transports that were attempting to escape from southeastern France through the Belfort Gap. Operated closely with ground forces and flew interdiction missions during the drive to the Moselle-Saar region. Shifted operations from the Saar basin to the Ardennes and assisted the beleaguered garrison at Bastogne after the Germans had launched the counteroffensive that precipitated the Battle of the Bulge. Operated almost exclusively within a ten-mile radius of Bastogne from 23‚Äì27 December 1944, a period for which the group received a second DUC for its at¬¨tacks on tanks, vehicles, defended buildings, and gun positions. Flew escort, interdiction, and close-support missions in the Ruhr Valley early in 1945 and thus assisted Allied ground forces in their drive to and across the Rhine. Remained in Europe after V-E Day, being assigned to United States Air Forces in Europe for duty in Bremen, Germany (AAF Station Nordholz) with the army of occupation. Inactivated on 20 August 1946, personnel and equipment being assigned to 86th Fighter Group keeping with Air Force policy of having low-numbered units active as much as possible. From the 1950s North American F-86D-45-NA Sabre Serial 52-4063 of the 513th Fighter Interceptor Squadron The 406th was reactivated in England as the 406th Fighter-Bomber Group on 10 July 1952 and assigned to the United States Air Forces in Europe Third Air Force. It replaced the federalized 123d Fighter-Bomber Group which was returned to Kentucky Air National Guard control. The group was composed of the 512th, 513th and 514th Fighter Squadrons and equipped with F-84G Thunderjets. From activation until August 1953, the 406th was tasked with both fighter-bomber and air defense roles in the United Kingdom. In the fall of 1953, the group was re-equipped with F-86F Sabres which were returned from action in Korea. In 1956, the unit was upgraded to the F-86D Sabre interceptor version and the group's mission was changed to assist RAF Fighter Command with air defense of the United Kingdom. The group was inactivated on 1 May 1956 when 406th FIW converted to Tri-Deputate organization, assigning operational squadrons directly to the wing. The group was reactivated as an Air Expeditionary unit in 2001. Was active in Turkey before Turkey refused to allow its territory to be used as part of the March 2003 invasion of Iraq. It seems likely the 406 AEG was inactivated shortly afterwards.

Film and stunt work During the end of his college career, he appeared in The Wizard of Oz (1939) as a Winkie guard and as Jack Haley's Tin Man stunt double. At the time of his death, Schindler was one of the last surviving living people working on the film classic. He also appeared in Sailor's Lady (1940). Later sport career and honours Although selected by the Green Bay Packers in the 1940 draft, Schindler did not play in the National Football League. At the time, coaching at high school and college offered more financial security than the low pay NFL of the early 1940s; he would later admit that he had lifelong doubts about his decision. His first offer out of college was to coach at Glendale High School, so chose it over a professional career. He served in the Navy during World War II and returned to move into a long career as coach and instructor at El Camino College in Torrance, California. In addition, Schindler also was a longtime football game official, working for years in the American Football League and later officiating high school and college games. He was inducted into the San Diego Hall of Champions Breitbard Hall of Fame in 1973.Breitbard Hall of Fame , San Diego Hall of Champions, June 25, 2008, accessed July 12, 2011. He was inducted into the USC Athletic Hall of Fame in 1997, and the Rose Bowl Hall of Fame in 2002.USC'S Ambrose Schindler Named to Rose Bowl Hall Of Fame, USCTrojans.com, November 1, 2002, accessed July 12, 2011. Personal life Schindler was one of three children born to Charles Anthony Schindler (1880‚Äì1961) and Nellie Ethel Parks (1880‚Äì1957). Schindler married his wife, Lucille Frances West (1917‚Äì1984), on August 29, 1943, and they together had two children. He did occasionally think about what his life would have been like if he played professional football, but part of his decision to select a more, at the time, stable career was because of his wife. His descendants noted that Schindler had suffered several concussions during his college career and that his short-term memory during his 90s had deteriorated rapidly compared to his sister's at a similar age; thus not going professional as a football player may have spared him from worse chronic traumatic encephalopathy. Schindler loved surfing and bicycling and was an active surfer until age 75. He drove a Jaguar with a vanity license plate reading \\"X USC QB.\\" He turned 100 in April 2017 and died in December 2018 of undisclosed causes at the age of 101.

The wasps most often nest in open areas of hard-packed sandy soil surrounded by woody habitat suitable for their buprestid beetle prey. Known C. fumipennis colonies in Ontario, Canada  Identification  Female C. fumipennis Male C. Fumipennis Cerceris fumipennis is distinguished by five conspicuous characteristics: *It is large, about the size of common yellow jacket wasps. *It has dark smoky, blue/black wings. *The wasp's body is predominantly black except for a few yellow markings. *It has a conspicuous, single broad creamy yellow abdominal band. *Females have three creamy patches between the eyes; while males are marked with two yellow triangles abutting their eyes.  Biology  Entrance of a C. fumipennis nest Cerceris fumipennis is a solitary ground-nesting wasp. Each lone female constructs and attempts to maintain a single subterranean nest for the duration of the flight season. Her solitary nest is in close proximity to others, forming a neighborhood or informal colony of nests. The nest's entrance is easily visible, marked by a small circular mound of earth. Each nest is composed of a single entrance hole which leads to subterranean cells. Like many crabronid and sphecid wasps, C. fumipennis females mass provision for their cells before laying an egg in them. Adult females provision their cells with beetles of the family Buprestidae. When hunting for buprestid prey, the maximum foraging range of the wasp is estimated at 2 km with an estimated average flight distance of 750 meters from the nest. Once prey has been found, a female wasp will typically attack a target beetle by alighting on it, climbing over it, and grabbing it by the thorax with her mandibles before inserting her stinger into the base of the beetle's leg (in the membrane of the coxal joint, a gap in the buprestid's armour) and injecting a paralytic venom. Once at the nest entrance or in the burrow, the female wasp will sometimes re-sting poorly paralyzed prey in the same joint. Within minutes of placing the final paralyzed beetle into its subterranean cell the adult wasp lays a single hotdog-shaped egg along the beetle's mesosternum. Prey beetles are paralyzed, not killed, ensuring that each beetle will remain fresh until the wasp larva can begin feeding upon it. After the egg is laid, the completed cell is detached from the burrow as the female wasp backfills the access with 3 ‚Äì 6 cm of soil. Once one cell is completed the wasp begins work on the next cell by excavating in a new direction off the main burrow. Most cells (approximately 5 ‚Äì 12, but up to 24) are constructed 7 ‚Äì 20 cm below grade with the egg, larva and pupal stages all developing within the confines of the single nest. In Ontario, the duration of time spent in the brood cell is about 10 months. Emergence dates and speed of the life cycle vary across the wasp's broad distribution. In Ontario, the flight season typically begins the last week of June and continues until early September. Emergence dates and duration of flight season can be influenced by droughts, which could postpone emergence or shorten the flight season. Ontario colonies are associated with somewhat disturbed sites compacted by human activity such as baseball diamonds, parking areas, infrequently used roads, roadsides, footpaths and the soil around campfire pits.  Value for biosurveillance  A C. fumipennis entering a nest with two buprestid prey In collecting buprestid prey, C. fumipennis has also been recorded collecting Emerald Ash Borer (EAB; Agrilus planipennis), a pest insect known for killing North American species of ash trees. EAB has proven difficult to detect using traditional methods of ground/visual surveys and sticky traps, both of which are costly, labour-intensive and at times destructive or impractical. Biosurveillance, using another species to survey for a pest species, offers an alternative approach for the detection and survey of EAB populations. Preliminary studies have shown that the wasp's EAB detection skills far surpass any comparable human technology. C. fumipennis has become a novel ally in efforts to monitor for EAB in Canada and the United States. Researchers have unofficially nicknamed C. fumipennis the \\"Smokey Winged Beetle Bandit‚Äù. This name has now been submitted to the Entomological Society of America's committee on common names. By transporting mobile populations of this wasp, biosurveillance could facilitate an early warning system for the Emerald Ash Borer across the United States & Canada. By using trained wasp watchers to look for what C. fumipennis brings back to its ground nest entrance, this could augment an early warning system that currently only utilizes \\"Purple Barney traps\\" that mimic the same color spectrum as Fraxinus ash tree leaves, to attract the EAB bug.

According to Balinese historiography he was the second son of king Dalem Di Made, who may have died in 1642. In Dutch sources from the 1630s, he appears to be mentioned as 'Patiekan' or 'Paadjakan', son of the current ruler.H.

He was the heir apparent of Savoy from his birth and as such was styled as the Prince of Piedmont. He acted as Regent of Savoy from September 1713 till September 1714 in the absences of his father. He died of smallpox at the age of 15. Biography The Prince of Piedmont was born in Turin on 6 May 1699. He was the fifth child and first son of his parents, Victor Amadeus II of Savoy and Anne Marie d'Orl√©ans, and was baptised with the names Victor Amadeus John Philip. He remained close to his father all his life. Though his parents were not close he also had a close relationship with his mother, a niece of Louis XIV of France. From birth he was styled as the Prince of Piedmont, the typical style for the heir apparent to the Duke of Savoy. Victor Amadeus was born at a time when the House of Savoy was in need of a male heir to succeed as the duchy observed Salic law which forbade females to inherit the throne. His birth was greeted with great celebration and throughout his life, his health required constant attention. During the Battle of Turin, he, his mother, grandmother and younger brother, Charles Emmanuel, had to flee Turin for their safety and go to Genoa. His father took part in the battle which was played out to west of the city. The prince was moved from female care in 1708. In 1713, at the end of the War of the Spanish Succession, by the Treaty of Utrecht, Sicily was ceded to the Duke of Savoy, Victor Amadeus's father. As such, Victor Amadeus became the heir to a kingdom rather than just a duchy. In September his parents set off for Palermo in Sicily in order to be crowned officially. Victor Amadeus II asked his mother, Marie Jeanne of Savoy, to maintain a regency in his absence but she declined and the younger Victor Amadeus was given the post. Victor Amadeus's regency ended when his father returned in September 1714. Strained relations between Savoy and Austria caused plans for the Prince of Piedmont to wed Maria Amalia, a daughter of the late Emperor Joseph I, but plans were ignored by his father. There were also negotiations for Victor Amadeus to wed Infanta Francisca Josefa of Portugal or Elisabeth Farnese. Victor Amadeus died in Turin on 22 March 1715 having caught smallpox. He was buried at the Turin Cathedral and later moved to the Basilica of Superga outside Turin. His body is located in the Sala degli Infanti (Hall of the Infantes [children]). He was succeeded as Prince of Piedmont by his younger brother, Charles Emmanuel.

He was the founder and leader of the Patsy Conroy Gang, a gang of river pirates active on the New York waterfront in the old Fourth Ward and Corlears' Hook districts during the post-American Civil War era. Two fellow members of his gang, Denny Brady and Larry Griffin, later assumed control but he participated in their raiding towns in Westchester County. He and Larry Griffin were eventually convicted of robbing the home of Robert Emmet in White Plains in 1874, as well as Denny Brady in Catskill the same year, resulting in the gang's breakup. Biography Conroy was described in Philip Farley's Criminals of America, Or, Tales of the Lives of Thieves: Enabling Every One to be His Own Detective (1876) as being \\"..of Irish origin and a burglar.

(pg. 73-76) In or around 1858, Conroy boarded a brigantine anchored at the foot of Jefferson Street with Bill Cummings and two other men. Capturing the watchman, whom they bound and gagged, Conroy led his companions to the main cabin where they subdued the 16-man crew and successfully looted the ship.Moss, Frank. The American Metropolis from Knickerbocker Days to the Present Time. London: The Authors' Syndicate, 1897. (pg. 104-108) Ten years later, he was implicated with Larry Griffin and Tommy Shea of the murder of a first mate during the robbery a ship anchored of Ryker's Island.Sutton, Charles; James B. Mix and Samuel A. Mackeever, ed. The New York Tombs: Its Secrets and Its Mysteries. Being a History of Noted Criminals, with Narratives of Their Crimes. San Francisco: A. Roman & Co., 1874. (pg. 474-476, 479) On one occasion, Conroy entered a Bowery saloon one night with Cummings, Boiled Oysters Malloy and Charley Mosher. Each of the four had been wounded, Conroy having been shot in the arm and Cummings in the chest. Jim McGuire, a Bowery thief, arrived shortly after with a bundle of stolen goods. Upon seeing the gangsters, McGuire ordered them a round of drinks. When Cummings complained about the whiskey they had been served, saying \\"they ought to be served champaigne\\", McGuire \\"good-naturedly\\" changed their order. Conroy then turned to McGuire and demanded a share of the young thief's merchandise. McGuire offered the men $10 each but Cummings scoffed at what he called \\"chicken-feed\\" and \\"unworthy of being offered to companions in distress\\". McGuire then walked away but was stopped by the men, received a punch in the stomach, and his goods stolen. Before leaving, Conroy told police \\"Officer, there's a man who has fallen off a car; better take him up\\". Conroy ran a basement dive bar in the Bowery which was advertised as a restaurant but, in actuality, was a front for his gang's headquarters. The building, reputed to be \\"an arsenal and always garrisoned\\", was avoided by police. Only one officer, detective Holly Lyons, had \\"dared to make an arrest there\\" and police usually waited outside to arrest a suspect instead of entering the basement bar. In the early 1870s, Conroy moved his gang to the Corlears' Hook district. Shortly after his arrival, Conroy started recruiting many of the area'a infamous waterfront thieves and criminals including Socco the Bracer, Scotchy Lavelle, Johnny Dobbs, Kid Shanahan, Pugsey Hurley, Wreck Donovan, Tom The Mick, Beeny Kane, Piggy Noles, Billy Woods, Bum Mahoney, Denny Brady and Larry Griffin. Brady and Griffin would later become joint leaders of the gang. Under his leadership, the Patsy Conroys dominated the New York waterfront district during the post-American Civil War era and remained one of the last active gangs of river pirates prior to the formation of the Steamboat Squad. Over time, Denny Brady and Larry Griffin gradually took over running the gang and may not have been actively involved some of the Patsy Conroys' more infamous crimes such as the Elizabeth or Mattan robberies during 1873. The failed robbery of the brig Elizabeth ended in the death of his chief lieutenant Socco the Bracer. Conroy was named as a suspect in the latter robbery, one which resulted in the wrongful imprisonment of fellow river pirates Tommy Dagan and Billy Carroll,Walling, George W.

New York: Caxton Book Concern, 1887. and he and the others began relying more heavily on raiding isolated towns in Westchester County along Long Island Sound and occasionally the island itself. During the last two years of his criminal career, the Patsy Conroys \\"kept these hamlets in a chronic condition of terror\\" until 1874 when he and Griffin were arrested by famed detectives Richard King and Holly Lyons for robbing the home of Robert Emmett in White Plains (or New Rochelle). Brady was also convicted of a similar charge against Abraham Post in Catskill that same year. Held at the White Plains jail, both men were eventually convicted and sentenced to 20 years imprisonment in New York State Prison; \\\\- however a news article published by The New York Times five years later claimed he and his gang were in Sing Sing.

Life  Torniello was born between 1488 and 1491 in Barengo, which was part of the Duchy of Milan. He came from a noble family of the area. He studied geometry and mathematics. In 1519 he joined the Order of Friars Minor as a preacher. In 1525 Torniello and his brother, Giovanni Antonio gained Milanese citizenship. He died in 1589 in the monastery of Treviglio in the Duchy of Milan.  Works  Torniello's works were focused on adopting the Latin alphabet inscriptions as original as possible, while simultaneously improving their geometric conditions. His works were influenced by Luca Pacioli's Divine Proportione (Divine Proportions) and Sigismondo Fanti. These fonts were not then designed for usage in the printing press, but as a model for artistic inscriptions. Torniello designed a 18X18 grid which served as a coordinate system for his geometrical fonts, which were designed for printing press usage. In his work Opera del modo de fare le littere maiuscole antique, which was printed in 1517, Torniello enriched, calligraphically and geometrically, previously-existing fonts. Geometrical conditions were added to the letters \\"M\\", \\"R\\", \\"S\\" and \\"T\\". The letters \\"S\\" and \\"T\\" were also enriched calligraphically.

Patsy Conroy the founder and leader of the Patsey Conroy Gang The Patsey Conroy Gang or Patsy Conroys were a group of river pirates active along the New York City waterfront of the old Fourth Ward during the post-American Civil War era. For nearly twenty years the Patsy Conroys dominated the area of Corlears' Hook and were one of the last major waterfront gangs to remain in the district prior to the formation of the George Gastlin's Steamboat Squad of New York City Police Department. The Patsey Conroy Gang abruptly disappeared when their leaders Patsy Conroy, Larry Griffin and Denny Brady were imprisoned in 1874. Early history The gang was originally formed by Patsy Conroy, an experienced river pirate who had previously \\"operated with great success\\" along the old Fourth Ward water front, and relocated his gang to the Corlears' Hook district in the early 1870s. Once establishing himself in the area, Conroy began recruiting many of infamous waterfront thieves and criminals including Socco the Bracer, Scotchy Lavelle, Johnny Dobbs, Kid Shanahan, Pugsey Hurley, Wreck Donovan, Tom The Mick, Beeny Kane, Piggy Noles, Billy Woods, Bum Mahoney, Denny Brady and Larry Griffin. Brady and Griffin would later become joint leaders of the gang. Its headquarters was located at a basement dive bar in the Bowery.Asbury, Herbert.

Being a History of Noted Criminals, with Narratives of Their Crimes. San Francisco: A. Roman & Co., 1874. (pg. 474-476) Death of Socco the Bracer On the night of May 29, 1873, gang members Billy Woods, Bum Mahoney and Conroy's chief lieutenant Socco the Bracer stole a small boat from Jackson Street and sailed downstream along the East River to Pier 27 where the brig Margaret was docked and waiting to be loaded with cargo. The three men boarded the ship and, while searching a sea chest, they woke up the captain and his mate. A fight then occurred with the crew and \\"the gangsters severely beaten and driven over the side into their boat\\". The skipper had fired several pistol shots into the air to alert police and Patrolmen Musgrave and Kelly, patrolling the river in a rowboat, attempted to catch up with the fleeing pirates but lost them in the fog and darkness. Musgrave flashed a dark lantern out over the water, searching for any sign of the pirates, and saw a boat slowly pull out from underneath a nearby pier. Mahoney and Woods were both rowing while Socco the Bracer was \\"standing in the stern with a cocked revolver in his hand\\". Socco fired at the officer as soon as Musgrave shined his lantern at the pirates. When he missed his target, Mahoney and Woods stopped rowing and also began firing. A brief shootout ensued when police returned fire, Musgrave's first shot hitting Socco below the heart, and Mahoney and Woods \\"seized their oars and pulled rapidly mid-stream\\". They then tossed Socco overboard, hoping to lighten the weight of the small boat, but Socco was not yet dead and clung to the side. Through seriously wounded, the shock of the cold water had revived him. He tried to climb back into the boat, holding onto the gunwale, and the pursuing officers could hear Socco begging his companions to take him back aboard. Woods suggested \\"they crack him on the knuckles and leave him to drown\\" but Mahoney relented and dragged him back into the boat. Socco died \\"before the craft had gone fifty feet\\" and Mohoney tossed his body overboard once more. The two men managed to escape but Socco's body turned up floating at the foot of Stanton Street \\"within sight of the dead gangster's home\\". Mattan robbery Though the death of Socco the Bracer had \\"frightened the Corlears' Hook thugs\\", six months later the gang made another outing. This time they targeted the Mattan, a brig carrying petroleum, and preparing to sail for Liverpool, England the following day. The Mattan, after receiving its cargo, had sailed down the East River to the Battery where it set anchor off Castle Garden on the afternoon of November 30. The ship was manned by a skeleton crew as Captain T.H. Connauton expected to take on additional men prior to leaving New York. Shortly after midnight however, seven masked men approached the ship in a small boat and boarded the ship by using a rope which had been left hanging over the side. Once aboard, the river pirates headed aft but one of them tripped over a coil of rope and fell onto the deck alerting the ship's first mate. When he went to investigate the noise, the mate was hit with a slung-shot then bound and gagged. The second mate and the steward were similarly captured. The pirates then went to the captain's cabin where Connauton, his wife and three children were sleeping. Connauton was awoken by knocking at his door and the pirates, claiming they were members of the harbor police, wished to talk to him. The captain slowly opened the door, but seeing the masked men armed with slung- shots and crowbars, quickly shut the door. One of the pirates fired his revolver at the door which passed through the panel and hit Connauton in the leg. Connauton fell to the floor, and although his wife and children briefly stalled the pirates by barricading the door with furniture, the invaders eventually broke their way inside the cabin. Confronting Connauton, the men demanded $4,000 in cash which they believed was on board. When the captain refused, the pirates grabbed his wife and threatened to kill her if he did not tell them where the money was hidden. Connauton eventually convinced them that the ship was not carrying $4,000 and, offering $45 instead, the pirates released his wife and began ransacking the cabin. In all, the men had spent an hour on the brig and left having looted a diamond ring, two watches, three gold chains, a ruby ring, and three silk dresses. The dresses had been bought by Mrs. Connauton during her last visit to Liverpool. The robbery of the Mattan was widely reported in the news. Two days following the robbery, the harbor police arrested two well-known river pirates, Tommy Dagan and Billy Carroll, who wrongly convicted and imprisoned for the crime.Walling, George W. Recollections of a New York Chief of Police: An Official Record of Thirty- eight Years as Patrolman, Detective, Captain, Inspector and Chief of the New York Police. New York: Caxton Book Concern, 1887. (pg. 148) Six months later, police found out that Dagan and Carroll had spent the night at a Water Street dive bar and could not have participated. They were later pardoned. Final years Patsy Conroy and his gang were eventually named as suspects in the Mattan robbery, although it was Denny Brady and Larry Griffin who led the group of masked men. As well as the waterfront, the gang also turned to raiding isolated suburban villages in Westchester County along Long Island Sound and occasionally the island itself. The Patsy Conroys relied on these raids more and more as business on the waterfront slowed and for two years \\"they kept these hamlets in a chronic condition of terror\\". In 1874, Brady was caught robbing a house in Catskill. That same year, Griffin and Patsy Conroy were also arrested for robbing the home of Robert Emmett in White Plains. All three were sentenced to twenty years' imprisonment. With their leaders in jail, the gang quickly disappeared from the New York underworld.

This combination of interactive adventure game and haunted house was pioneered by Richard Garriott at his Britannia Manor haunted attraction which began in 1988 and ran every two years until 1994. The torch was passed to Keith Ewing, former Britannia Manor construction manager, and continued in Wild Basin's Haunted Trails every year from 1996 to 2005.Austin Chronicle Review of Haunted Trails 1997Wild Basin's Haunted Trails 1998 Commercial What makes these three haunts a unique performance medium is the emphasis on script and story similar to a play, but with an emphasis on interactive elements including making the audience play the role of the main character.Richard Garriott interview on the history of Britannia Manor It also requires a significant physical contribution from the guests, not simply walking through, but running, climbing, crawling, sliding, and occasionally swimming and/or rowing. As their website puts it, SCARE is \\"a story-driven, theatrical horror experience presented across 26 stages.\\"http://www.austinchronicle.com/gyrobase/Design/Blogs/?oid=oid:696713&blog;= Volunteers from all over Austin and the surrounding area come together for this elaborate performance that generally runs during the last two weeks of October. High school drama troupes and Britannia Manor and Haunted Trails veterans continue to make up a significant portion of the volunteer pool, but they have been joined through the years by many members of the Elk's Lodge, as well as general theatre and Halloween enthusiasts from the Austin area. The significant presence of movie, video game, and stage industries in Austin provides a large pool of talented individuals. Local fiction writers, video game companies, and the Texas school for the blind are frequent contributors as well. General history SCARE for a CURE has two separate historical roots which came together in 2007. Much of the original concept of a story- based, full touch interactive theatre style of haunted attraction came from Britannia Manor and was carried on by a core group of dedicated volunteers for a decade in Wild Basin's Haunted Trails, before that group of volunteers combined efforts with Jarrett Crippen and SCARE for a CURE. The other beginning was in Jarrett \\"The Defuser\\" Crippen's back yard charity haunt that he did for several years before SCARE for a CURE officially began. Jarrett Crippen, a detective in the Austin Police Department, and winner of the second season of reality show, \\"Who Wants to be a Superhero?,\\" put on an elaborate haunt in his home and yard asking for donations to various charities, such as cans of food for the Austin Food Bank, as admission. Local high school drama troupes provided much of the acting talent. 2005 2005 was both the last year of Wild Basin's Haunted Trails and also the last year that Jarrett Crippen put on a haunted house in his back yard. More than 1000 people went through Crippen's house and yard in the three-day run of his charity haunted house, which had been dubbed Scare for a Cure by then. This caused major difficulties with traffic in his neighborhood which necessitated the intervention of traffic control officers.2005 Video Walk-Through of the Haunt 2006 Both the Wild Basin Haunted Trails volunteer group and Jarrett Crippen took a year off. 2007 Wild Basin donated all the props, flats and other materials that had been stored from Haunted Trails to Crippen for use in his new haunted attraction. The experienced floating volunteer pool, many of whom had been doing haunts for more than ten years, beginning at Britannia Manor, transferred their energy to Crippen's effort.About Austin Blog Entry Crippen, and many of the key volunteers belonged to the BPOE (Benevolent and Protective Order of the Elks). The Austin Elk's Lodge #201 provided SCARE for a CURE a prime location for a large scale haunt that could handle the traffic levels and other demands. Half the proceeds of SCARE were donated to Elk's Lodge scholarships, with the other half going to the Austin Breast Cancer Resource Centers.http://weareaustin.com/content/fulltext/?cid=18460 Crippen's fame as a recent reality show winner undoubtedly contributed to the level of media coverage.Coverage of The Defuser supporting SCARE2007 SCARE for a CURE Media coverage More than $12,000 was raised for SCARE sponsored charities. The show was dubbed \\"Phobia Asylum\\" that year and the premise was that guests would be cured of their phobias, regardless of their nature by a radical new treatment which involved special chemically altered spider venom, and repeated exposure to the object of fear.2007 SCARE for a CURE walk-through There was an odd challenge involved from \\"Lord Vile\\" local Austin self-styled super-villain who was also running a haunted house in Austin. If his haunted house got more customers than SCARE on nights when they both ran, half of his proceeds would go to SCARE charities. If Lord Vile's haunt got more customers, he would donate half of his proceeds to NORML.Interview with The Defuser at ComicCon following 2007 SCARE 2008 In 2008, a board of directors was elected, and the process of incorporating into a non-profit organization began. The Elks Lodge again hosted the performance, and half of the proceeds went to the Elks Lodge scholarship fund. The other half of the proceeds went to four $2500 scholarships awarded to Austin area high school students whose lives had been adversely affected by cancer, either by losing a close family member, or in one case, by being diagnosed with cancer, themselves.Award Ceremony for SCARE for a CURE Scholarship Winners In 2008, volunteer hours were tracked for the first time resulting in totals of over 8000 hours from more than 200 volunteers.SCARE Blog The SCARE theme was \\"video games gone wrong\\" and the sub-title was \\"World of Horrorcraft.\\"http://www.austin360.com/event/events2/etc/userEventDisplay.jspd?eventStatus=Approved&eventid;=206074 The basic premise was that a new technology had been invented that allowed players to upload their consciousness into video games so they could play directly, rather than through pushing buttons on a controller. Naturally, things go horribly wrong from there, thanks to an evil artificial intelligence named A.L.I.C.E. and the dastardly behind-the-scenes shenanigans of the technology creator, Dunstan Interactive Entertainment (DIE).http://austinlivetheatre.blogspot.com/2008/10/world-of-horrorcraft- scare-for-cure-at.html 2009 In 2009, SCARE announced that they are moving to a new location. Richard Garriott has become a sponsor, and allowed them to build this year's haunt on the location of his partially completed mansion, which he refers to as Britannia Manor Mark 2.Horrorblips Posts Press Release of New Location This is being hinted at as a return of the famous haunt, Britannia Manor, but Garriott's level of involvement may be minimal, aside from providing a venue. Jarrett Crippen is still listed as the director. SCARE has returned to the 2007 charity of Austin Breast Cancer Resource Centers for the full amount of the proceeds, with a general intention of having Austin BCRC as their primary ongoing charity. 501-C non-profit papers have been filed, and regular monthly board meetings are now held in conjunction with the haunt script and planning meetings. The sub-title for this year is \\"Blood Ritual\\" with a general vampire related theme. The premise is that the guests have come to interview for the chance to join the Researchers In the Paranormal (RIP), a paranormal investigation organization. As rookie RIPpers, they will have a chance to prove themselves in a genuine investigation of the possible reappearance of Britannia Manor. Unbeknownst to the RIPpers, they are being used by a cabal of vampires in their attempt to raise an all powerful demon and rule the world. It's up to the guests to find a way to foil their evil plot, and get out alive.2009 SCARE for a CURE Teaser Video 2010 Zombie Apocalypse 2011 The theme for the 2011 Haunted House was \\"Carnival of Lost Souls\\" in which participants meet the ringmaster of a carnival who sends them into a field of ruins to find his lost talisman. Players must watch out for Chuckles, a man-eating clown, and Ivo, the evil brother of the ringmaster. 2012 Summer Camp Massacre 2013 The theme for 2013 was Fairy Tale Nightmare. Fairy tale archaeologists had visited their subjects of study and brought back artifacts from the fictitious world to showcase in their museum. But their excursions also brought about a change in the stories themselves. Now guests must travel into this other realm to put the stories right - but the new and twisted fairy tale characters may have other plans... In addition to the haunt, this year featured 2 new attractions: an interactive ghost town murder mystery and a maze, also known as the Boneyard. The murder mystery consisted of groups of guests traveling from one vignette to another, attempting to unravel the secret of the ghost town by talking to its dearly departed residents. The boneyard was a wooden maze where guests must find a way out, but beware: your group may not be the only ones trapped within the walls - and the denizens of the boneyard only get to hunt once a year... 2014 Due to popular demand, the haunt is doing its first ever sequel: Return to Zombie Wasteland. It's been 40 years since the zombie virus devastated humanity. No more grocery stores, no more gas stations. No more reality TV. But if you can make it to the City of Prosper, you might have a chance of surviving the Return to Zombie Wasteland. There will also be another high octane maze experience, the Slaughterhouse.

For the Dartmouth Conference's 50th anniversary, the Kettering Foundation published an additional volume to commemorate and chronicle all five decades. Inter- Tajik Dialogue The Inter-Tajik Dialogue developed out of Saunders's work with the Dartmouth Conference Regional Conflicts Task Force as a series of unofficial, Track II dialogues between warring factions in the Tajik civil war. The dialogues took place in Moscow, beginning in 1993 and lasting until 2003, during which 35 meetings took place. Sustained Dialogue Institute The Sustained Dialogue Institute is an independent tax-exempt 501 (c)(3) organization formed in collaboration with the Kettering Foundation. Saunders served as president of the institute from its founding in 2002 until June 2013 and remained Board Chair until his passing in 2016.http://sustaineddialogue.org/about-us/ The Institute helps citizens around the world to transform their conflictual or destructive relationships and to design and implement sustainable change processes. Domestic and Global Influence In 1991, Saunders facilitated Israeli and Palestinian citizen-leaders who forged and signed the historic document, \\"Framework for a Public Peace Process\\" .Stanford Center on International Conflict and Negotiation, Beyond War Foundation, FRAMEWORK FOR A PUBLIC PEACE PROCESS: Toward a Peaceful Israeli-Palestinian Relationship, 1991. PDF This inspired the 1992 birth of the Jewish-Palestinian Living Room Dialogue in California, a model of Saunders' citizen-to-citizen Sustained Dialogue with domestic and global impact. The Sustained Dialogue process itself is now used on college campuses throughout the world to facilitate better community relations, under the work of the Sustained Dialogue Campus Network. His legacy endures for negotiators and citizens equally: \\"There are some things only governments can do, such as negotiating binding agreements. But there are some things that only citizens outside government can do, such as changing human relationships.\\"Saunders, Harold H. (2005). Politics is about relationship : a blueprint for the citizens' century (1st ed.). New York: Palgrave Macmillan. Saunders' legacy was reflected in the 2017 Commencement Address of Notre Dame de Namur University,Notre Dame de Namur University\\"STORIES OF CHANGE: Creating a Culture of Connection in The Citizens‚Äô Century.\\"http://traubman.igc.org/ndnu2017address.pdf Books   Awards *The Walter and Leonore Annenberg Award for Excellence in Diplomacy from the American Academy of Diplomacy, \\"November 30, 3010\\" *Lifetime Achievement Award from Search for Common Ground, March, 2004, to honor outstanding accomplishments in conflict resolution, community building, and peacemaking.

It is the largest incorporated municipality of the Laurentides region. The village is located on the shores of the Du Li√®vre River and Journalists Lake, and along Quebec Route 309, about north of Mont-Laurier. History In the 19th century, the area began attracting loggers because of its rich red and white pine stands. In 1850, the James MacLaren logging company built a large tree farm called \\"La Ferme de la Montagne\\" that was used as a supply camp for loggers. It was sold in 1888 to Cyrille Lafontaine and inhabited by his son L√©onard who became the first settler and farmer of Ferme- Neuve. In 1898, the Ferme-Neuve Post Office opened. In 1902, a group of 8 Montreal journalists, under direction from Lomer Gouin, Minister of Colonization, built a model farm in order to attract more settlers. They also launched a public subscription to build a school. In recognition, the lake adjacent to the settlement was called Lac des Journalistes (\\"Lake of Journalists\\"). Also in 1902, the United Township Municipality of W√ºrtele- Moreau-et-Gravel was formed, with Toussaint Cloutier as first mayor. In 1917, the Ferme-Neuve settlement separated from the united township and became an incorporated village, with Henri Berthiaume as its first mayor. In 1930, the United Township Municipality of W√ºrtele-Moreau-et-Gravel changed statutes and was renamed to the Parish Municipality of Ferme-Neuve. On December 24, 1997, both entities were merged again into the new Municipality of Ferme-Neuve.

Trelawny was the posthumous younger son of John Trelawny of Pool (who had been High Sheriff of the county); his elder brother died in infancy and he inherited the estate. He entered Parliament as member for Liskeard, representing that borough in three parliaments, and subsequently also represented Cornwall in the Parliaments of 1597 and 1604. On one occasion he was sent to the Tower of London for losing his temper during a parliamentary debate where he \\"dealt his opponent, Mr Ashe, a thundering box to his ear\\" and \\"flashed his sword\\". He was High Sheriff of Cornwall in 1595 and was knighted in 1597; he was also Recorder of Liskeard and Steward of the borough of West Looe. He died on 22 June 1604, while Parliament was in session. The Journal of the House of Commons records that the House was informed of his death the following day: he \\"being suddenly suffocated with a flux of blood, which came by breaking a vein with vehement coughing, and was said to found sick and dead within quarter of an hour\\"; the House of Commons voted to attend his funeral at St Clement Danes, an unusual mark of respect. In 1600, Sir Jonathan purchased the manor of Trelawney or Trelawn in Pelynt from the Crown, and moved his residence there from Pool. (This was not the same Trelawney from which the family originally took its name, which was in the parish Altarnun, a dozen miles away, and where they had not lived for some centuries.) He had married Elizabeth Killigrew, daughter of Sir Henry Killigrew, which made him a distant connection of Sir Robert Cecil, whose aunt Catherine Cooke was Killigrew's first wife, and Trelawny ensured that the Parliamentary seats he controlled at Liskeard were at Cecil's disposal in 1597 and 1601. Their eldest son, John (1592‚Äì1664), was created a baronet in 1628. To his second son, Edward, he left the estate of Coldrenick.

He briefly held brigade command at the Battle of Gettysburg. Prior to the Civil War, Williams attended the University of Alabama and lived in Mansfield, Louisiana. The 2nd Louisiana Infantry was organized in 1861, being mustered into the Confederate service on May 11 of that year. Jesse M. Williams was named captain of the Pelican Rifles, a company recruited in DeSoto Parish and Natchitoches Parish. The original officers of the 2nd Louisiana earned a reputation for drunkenness.Jones, p. 37. Perhaps for this reason, the regiment was reorganized in May 1862 with J. T. Norwood as colonel and Williams as lieutenant colonel. By then the regiment, led by Col William Levy, had seen combat under the command of BG Howell Cobb in the 1862 Battle of Yorktown and the Battle of Seven Pines in the division of MG John B. Magruder. When Col Norwood was mortally wounded at the Battle of Malvern Hill during an assault by Magruder's division,Sears, p. 332, says the 2nd Louisiana lost 182 casualties that day. Williams was named his successor. He led the regiment in the Army's Second Louisiana Brigade at the Battle of Cedar Mountain, the Second Battle of Bull Run and the Battle of Antietam in the brigade of BG William E. Starke in Stonewall Jackson‚Äôs command. Williams was wounded in the chest at Antietam in the fighting along the Hagerstown Road.Jones, p. 131. Col Williams did not return to his regiment in time for the Battle of Fredericksburg.Sibley, p. 39 lists Maj Michael A. Grogan as leading 2nd Louisiana. Williams returned to active duty in 1863. The regiment fought under BG Francis T. Nicholls at the Battle of Chancellorsville. When Nicholls was wounded on May 2, 1862, eventually losing a foot, Williams became acting brigade commander.Jones, p. 147. The brigade served on the left flank of the Confederate line on May 3, eventually running low on ammunition. Jesse Williams remained acting brigade commander in the Gettysburg Campaign under MG Edward Johnson. In that role, Williams led the attack on Stephenson‚Äôs Depot on June 15, 1863, cutting off the retreat of many of the federal troops of Gen Robert Milroy defeated in the Second Battle of Winchester.Jones, p. 162. At Gettysburg on July 2, Williams‚Äô brigade was involved in Johnson‚Äôs attack on Culp's Hill. In his report, Williams complained that he was not supported on the right by the brigade of BG John M. Jones. That Louisiana brigade was involved in a renewed assault on July 3. The battle cost Williams 291 of 1,104 troops engaged.Jones, p. 176. Williams later forwarded a petition of his officers asking to be permitted to refill their ranks or go onto garrison duty. This may have helped cost Williams any chance at promotion.Jones, p. 178. Command of the Second Louisiana Brigade was given to BG Alfred Iverson for the Bristoe Campaign, but it passed eventually to BG Leroy A. Stafford.Sibley, pp. 56, 62. Williams led his regiment through 1863 under these commanders and at the beginning of 1864 under Stafford. Williams led his regiment at the Battle of the Wilderness, in which Gen Stafford lost his life. Col Zebulon York was Stafford‚Äôs immediate successor, but Williams seems to have succeeded to command in time for the Battle of Spotsylvania Courthouse.Jones, pp. 203, 205; Sibley, pp. 69. 288. Williams was killed on May 12, 1864, during the attack of the federal II Corps on the Confederate lines. Ltc Ross E. Burke succeeded to command of the regiment.

The Company preserves and distributes human tissues and develops, manufactures, and commercializes medical devices for cardiac and vascular transplant applications. The human tissues distributed by CryoLife include the CryoValve¬Æ SG pulmonary human heart valve and the CryoPatch¬Æ SG pulmonary cardiac patch tissue, both processed using CryoLife‚Äôs proprietary SynerGraft¬Æ technology. CryoLife‚Äôs medical devices consist of surgical adhesives, sealants, and hemostats including BioGlue¬Æ Surgical Adhesive, PerClot¬Æ, which the Company began distributing for Starch Medical, Inc. in October 2010, as well as On-X¬Æ Heart Valves, which they acquired in 2016, and aortic stent grafts manufactured by JOTEC¬Æ GmbH, which they acquired in 2017. In 2019, CryoLife entered a distribution agreement with Endospan.The agreement gives CryoLife exclusive European distribution rights to Nexus, an endovascular stent graft system approved for the repair of aneurysms and dissections in the aortic arch. The Company preserves small diameter human saphenous vein conduits (3mm to 6mm) for use in peripheral vascular reconstructions and coronary bypass surgery. Failure to achieve revascularization of an obstructed vessel may result in the loss of a limb or even death of the patient. When patients require bypass surgery, the surgeon‚Äôs first choice generally is the patient‚Äôs own vein tissue. However, in cases of advanced vascular disease, 30% of patients have unsuitable vein tissue for transplantation, and the surgeon must consider using synthetic grafts or preserved human vascular tissue. Small diameter synthetic vascular grafts are generally not optimal for below-the- knee surgeries because they have a tendency to obstruct over time. Preserved human vascular tissues tend to remain open longer and as such are used in indications where synthetics typically fail. In addition, synthetic grafts are not suitable for use in infected areas since they may harbor bacteria and are difficult to treat with antibiotics. Preserved human vascular tissues are ideal grafts for patients with previously infected graft sites. The Company also preserves femoral veins and arteries and aortoiliac arteries for bypass or reconstruction within infected surgical areas. In December 2017, CryoLife acquired JOTEC AG, A German-based company developer of medical devices for aortic and peripheral vascular diseases, for $225 million.

Clerkships After his graduation from Law School, Hoffman served as a law clerk for Judge Dennis G. Jacobs, Hoffman also clerked for Supreme Court Chief Justice William Rehnquist. Hoffman, in response to questions about his experience clerking for conservative jurists has been quoted as saying, ‚ÄúIf you‚Äôre lucky enough in Law School to be in a position to apply for a supreme court clerkship what the law professors will tell you is that you apply to all nine.

The IGO is a watchdog for the taxpayers of the City, and has jurisdiction to conduct investigations and audits over most aspects of City government. Hoffman directed a 55-person staff of attorneys, investigators, and auditors that exposed bribery, fraud and theft schemes, contracting corruption, illegal employment practices, ethics violations, and extensive waste.

As Finland had become independent, on March 1, 1918, during the Finnish Civil War, in a friendship treaty the Finnish Red Guards' Edvard Gylling and Oskari Tokoi in the name of the Finnish Socialist Workers' Republic ceded the fortress to Soviet Russia in exchange for the city of Petsamo.–î–æ–≥–æ–≤–æ—Ä –û–± —É–∫—Ä–µ–ø–ª–µ–Ω–∏–∏ –¥—Ä—É–∂–±—ã –∏ –±—Ä–∞—Ç—Å—Ç–≤–∞ –º–µ–∂–¥—É –†–°–§–°–† –∏ –§–∏–Ω–ª—è–Ω–¥—Å–∫–æ–π –°–æ—Ü–∏–∞–ª–∏—Å—Ç–∏—á–µ—Å–∫–æ–π –†–∞–±–æ—á–µ–π –†–µ—Å–ø—É–±–ª–∏–∫–æ–π However, the Finnish White Guards, who ultimately came out victorious in the civil war, demanded the fortress back, without offering a similar return of Petsamo, and on April 24 the 5th Jaeger Regiment under Major Hugo Viktor √ñsterman laid siege to it. On May 8 Germany demanded Soviet Russia return the fort to Finland, and the Soviet government for fear of violating the Treaty of Brest-Litovsk withdrew its support to the crew. On May 14, 1918, the Soviet crew destroyed the batteries and evacuated to Kronstadt aboard the battleship Respublika. With the Treaty of Tartu in 1920, Finland undertook to disarm it completely within a year. Mid 20th century Following the start of the Winter War in 1939, the advancing Soviets examined Fort Ino and found it damaged beyond repair. After World War II there was a Soviet Navy installation researching radiological weapons.

He belonged to a dynasty that claimed descent from the Hindu-Javanese Majapahit Empire, and kept its palace (puri) in Gelgel near Bali's south coast. Assistant to Dalem Di Made According to Balinese historiography, written much later, he was one of the fourteen sons of the king Dalem Seganing, and born from a co-wife (penawing).I Wayan Warna et al. (tr.), Babad Dalem; Teks dan Terjemahan. Denpasar: Dinas Pendidikan dan Kebudayaan Daerah Tengkat I Bali 1986, p. 94. He seems to have held a high position during the reign of his brother Dalem Di Made (1623?-1642?). Dutch sources from the 1630s mention a brother of the current ruler called 'T'jouw' or 'Tchau' who negotiated with the Dutch East Indies Company on the ruler's behalf.H.T. Colenbrander, Dagh-Register, gehouden int Casteel Batavia. 's-Gravenhage: Departement van Koloni√´n 1898, p. 177-82. According to an annual entry in the Balinese text Pawawatekan the Gelgel kingdom fell apart in 1651, at the same time as Dewa Cawu was enthroned as king. The outbreak of internal fighting on Bali in 1651 is likewise mentioned in Dutch sources.H. H√§gerdal, 'From Batuparang to Ayudhya; Bali and the Outside World, 1636-1656', Bijdragen tot de Taal-, Land- en Volkenkunde 154 1998, p. 90. Exile and death Dewa Cawu is not mentioned as ruler in his own right in later Balinese historiography. Also, his time as ruler or pretender-ruler was apparently short and hampered by the ongoing internal warfare. By 1665 the old chief minister of the kingdom, Anglurah Agung, had usurped power, which he retained until his death in 1686. An annal entry states that Dewa Cawu died in Guliang in the present Bangli regency, in 1673.http://vxu.diva-portal.org/smash/get/diva2:206791/FULLTEXT01 p. 34. The 18th-century chronicle Babad Dalem likewise speaks of a ruler who died in exile in Guliang, although this ruler is identified with his elder brother Dalem Di Made.H. H√§gerdal, 'Bali in the Sixteenth and Seventeenth Centuries; Suggestions for a Chronology of the Gelgel Period', Bijdragen tot de Taal-, Land- en Volkenkunde 151 1995, p. 119-20. The dynastic conditions on Bali at this time are therefore partly obscure, with largely contradictive sources.H.

He served for almost 22 years at the Neuendettelsau Mission Station in the Finschhafen District of New Guinea, which had been founded in 1892 by Johann Flierl. He controversially proposed the evangelization of tribes, rather than individuals, the concept known as Volkskirche (Congregation Church). An avid linguist, he compiled one of the first dictionaries of a Guinean dialects: Dictionary of the K√¢te Language, a Papuan community (W√∂rterbuch der K√¢te-Sprache; Eine Papuagemeinde). He also maintained a regular correspondence with the German Geographical Society in Berlin, reporting on his naturalist findings in New Guinea.Erwin L. Lueker, Luther Poellot, Paul Jackson, Christian Cyclopedia, Concordia Publishing House, 2002. . He published his memoirs (1929), Christian Keyser, Das bin bloss ich. Lebenserinnerungen. (It is merely me: Memoirs.) Neuendettelsau, Freimund-Verlag, (1929) 1966. as well as over 300 essays and pamphlets and ten books. An intrepid explorer, he ascended the Saruwaged Range massif in 1913. Career In 1899, the Neuendettelsau Missionary Society sent Christian Keyser to the Sattelberg Mission Station in New Guinea. There, he worked under the tutelage of the station's founder, Johann Flierl, for several years; he also married the governess of Flierl's four children, Emilie Heumann (b. 14 February 1873 in Strasbourg), in 1903. Keyser proved a gifted and diligent linguist, and he also developed a critical understanding of the K√¢te people that Flierl did not have: in this corporatist society, it would not be possible to bring people to Christ one at a time, through individual acceptance of God. Instead, he sought tribal conversions. The sort of mass conversions Keyser had in mind were not what Flierl envisioned for the mission, but he recognized that Keyser's new energy was indeed what Sattelberg needed at the time. Keyser drew on community norms of the K√¢te to develop an idea of the Volkskirche, a church of people. In 1903, he performed the first group baptism; although it was only ten people, it was a start, and laid the groundwork for the mass conversions of 1905 and 1906 (the latter being helped somewhat by a rough earthquake in September 1906). Keyser returned to Germany in 1921, leaving Adelaide in 1920 on the ship Nestor with his wife and three daughters, and arriving in Germany via London in the spring of 1921.UK Incoming Passenger Lists, 1878-1960 [database on-line]. Provo, UT, USA: The Generations Network, Inc., 2008. Original data: Board of Trade: Commercial and Statistical Department and successors: Inwards Passenger Lists. Kew, Surrey, England: The National Archives of the UK (TNA). From 1922-1939, he taught missions and was missionary inspector at the Neuendettelsau Missionary College. He taught missions at the Neuendettelsau Seminary, and the University of Erlangen granted him a PhD in 1929 and he taught theology there until 1939. More than 30 of his students went to Papua New Guinea, and more went to other mission sites.Donald McGavran, A People Reborn: Foundation Insights on People Movements. ; Writings and discoveries Keyser wrote 10 long works and over 300 small books and essays. His dictionary of the K√¢te language includes more than 10,000 words and phrases. During his years at the Sattelberg, he undertook frequent scientific journeys, and was a regular correspondent of the German Geographical Society of Berlin. He discovered hundreds of plants, insects and animals‚Äîdiscovered to Europeans, that is, and several are reported named for him. He was among the first Europeans to ascend the Saruwaged Range, which he did in 1913.

The name dollaseite-(Ce) was chosen in honor of Wayne Dollase, who performed broad research on the epidote-group minerals. The original confusion of the mineral's composition was because of a complex atomic composition where an exchange of cations leads to a form of dollaseite-(Ce) that at first glimpse resembles an Mg analogue of allanite, now known as dissakisite-(Ce). Dollaseite-(Ce), although not very well known is part of a broad group of minerals, the epidote group which are primarily silicates, the most abundant type of minerals on earth. Dollaseite-(Ce) forms as dark-brown subhedral crystals primarily in Swedish mines.

After further analysis were made it was determined that dollaseite-(Ce) was not the magnesium analogue of allanite as originally believed by Gaijer and was renamed. Geijer however, was not the only one to have had reported minerals with compositions that would be similar to a magnesium analogue of allanite. Enami and Zang, Meyer, Hanson and Pearce also reported minerals that resembled the composition of a Mg analogue of allanite but none had sufficient data, or exact composition to be declared as a Mg analogue of allanite. It was not until 1991 that Edward S. Grew established dissakisite as the actual Mg dominant allanite mineral with formula .Grew, E.S., Essene, E.J., Peacor D.R., Su, S. and Asami, M.

Dollaseite-(Ce) can generally be found in mineralized dolomite-tremolite rocks in the form of dark brown and subhedral crystals Geologic occurrence Dollaseite-(Ce) can occur in a number of locations, but the most prominent is at Ostanmossa, Sweden. The type of dollaseite-(Ce) that can generally be found at this location tends to be iron-poor and occurs in tremolite skarn. The fact that dollaseite-(Ce) can be prominently found in Sweden comes as no surprise since Sweden has been known to host many REE epidote-group minerals such as dissakisite-(Ce) and allanite-(Ce). Another dollaseite-(Ce) specimen with composition slightly similar to that of dissakisite-(Ce) can be found in rock composed of fluorite and fluorian phlogopite.

Occupying a prominent site opposite the Hanover Gate entrance to Regent's Park, the 11 storey block of flats has 18 two bedroom, 18 one bedroom, four penthouse and one caretaker's flat. Three quarters of the 41 flats have views over the park. The block was one of the first funded and built on the co-ownership principle made possible by the formation of the Housing Corporation in 1964. Lessees contributed to a group mortgage and received a premium payment when they left. This was designed to reflect the increase in the value of the flat during their stay.  Architects  125 Park Road was designed in the late 1960s by the architects Farrell/Grimshaw Partnership for the Mercury Housing Society. Both Sir Terry Farrell and Sir Nicholas Grimshaw were members of the society and lived in the block. It was their second scheme and, when listed in 2001, was commended for pioneering the High-Tech movement in British architecture. The block was completed in June 1970 at a contract cost of ¬£227,000.  Design  The building is widely known for its corrugated aluminium cladding, radiused corners and sloping glazed roof. The exterior belies the light and spacious interiors of the flats. Living space is maximised by concentrating bathrooms, lifts and stairs in a central structural core. Natural light is maximised by placing the freestanding perimeter columns behind continuous window glazing. Curved corners add the sensation of panoramic views over London. Most internal walls are non-loadbearing which allows flats to be combined as larger units. This shows the benefits of designing residential accommodation on the same principles as commercial offices where habitable space is freed by concentrating services in a central core.  Recognition & reputation  In 1973, the flats were highly commended in the Housing Design Awards sponsored by the Secretary of State for the Environment. Increasingly, features about the building and individual flats started to appear in Sunday colour supplements and architectural magazines such as Building Design and Architectural Design. One of the penthouses was used as a film location, other flats were used for magazine and advertisement shoots.

An old chapel which was built in 1812 was renovated and transformed into a brothers' residence and a secondary and primary school. From 1824 to 1930 the primary school and secondary school were all located in the same room. A primary school was built in the rear in the 1930s; it closed in the early 2000s and the building is now part of the secondary school, who use it as Technical Graphics and Woodwork rooms. The original school building was used up to 1974, when the school's Superior, Br. Sheehan, had the hill above the monastery cleared and a new secondary school and playing field built. Until 1972 the school operated totally through the medium of Irish. The school's original name was Mount St. Joseph's Secondary and Primary School or Meanscoil na mBr√°ithre.

It concerns the possibility of predicting whether a song will be a hit, before its distribution using automated means such as machine learning software.

Early studies claimed that using machine learning techniques could capture some information from audio signals and lyrics that would explainDhanaraj, R., and Logan, B. Automatic Prediction of Hit Songs, Proc. of Ismir 2005, London, UK popularity. However, a larger- scale evaluationPachet, F. and Roy, P. (2008) Hit Song Science is Not Yet a Science. Proceedings of Ismir 2008, pages 355-360, Philadelphia, USA contradicts the claims of ‚ÄúHit Song Science‚Äù, i.e. that the popularity of a music title can be learned effectively from known audio features. Many other reasons, including the well known \\"cumulative advantage\\" or preferential attachment effects deeply contradictsPachet, F. (2011) Hit Song Science. In Tao, Tzanetakis & Ogihara, editor, Music Data Mining, CRC Press/Chapman Hall the possibility of practical applications. Nevertheless, automatic prediction techniques are the basis of hit counseling businesses (HSS Technology). Recent work by Herremans et al. has shown that audio features can indeed be used to outperform a random oracle when predicting top 10 versus top 30-40 hits Vice Magazine: A Machine Successfully Predicted the Hit Dance Songs of 2015 . Commercial applications A technology proposing to exploit Hit Song Science was introduced in 2003 by an artificial intelligence company out of Barcelona, Spain, called Polyphonic HMI. Polyphonic HMI has since spun off a new Delaware C corporation, Music Intelligence Solutions, Inc., which used to run uPlaya, a site geared toward music professionals. In 2006 however one of the company's founders, Mike McCready left to pursue another direction in the digital music space. The idea of Hit Song Science has generated response from many in the music industry, including Chuck D,XXLmag.com: Chuck D and uPlaya Analyze Hit Songs Robert Lamm, Stratton Leopold,Stratton Leopold to Advisory Board Gregg Scholl of The Orchard,Music Intelligence Solutions Partners with The Orchard and officials at The Sync AgencyMusic Intelligence Solutions Partners with The Sync Agency as well as Blue Infinity Music.

The system is designed to make overtaking easier and hence make the sport more exciting to watch. At the present time all racing associations except drag racing ban nitrous oxide for use in boosting engines. Mechanism Several racing series have implemented push-to-pass systems, including the former Champ Car series, the A1GP series (who refer to their system as PowerBoost), Audi Sport TT Cup (since 2015), DTM (since 2019), Indy Lights (since 2015) and the IndyCar Series (who refer to the system as an overtake button). There is no requirement that the system be used only when attempting to overtake another car. For example, a driver may choose to operate the system in order to defend a position. The amount of extra power, the amount of boost time and the number of boost activations available during the race varies from series to series. Formula E features the Fanboost, where fans can vote for their favourite driver via various social media channels to give them an extra power boost at each race. For the 2018‚Äì19 season, an \\"Attack Mode\\" was also introduced, where drivers receive a boost by driving through a designated area of the circuit off the racing line, rather by pressing a button. In Formula One, the kinetic energy recovery system (KERS) functions in a similar manner; however, it relies on regenerative braking to store energy for later use, rather than simply increasing the engine's power, as is the case in some other systems. The drag reduction system (DRS), by contrast, increases acceleration and top speed by moving an element of the rear wing to reduce drag rather than by boosting power; its use in races is more restricted.

It is endemic to Southwest Australia. Description Franklandias are heathland shrubs found on white or grey sands. They possess a lignotuber, allowing them to recover from bushfire. Several erect branches emerge from an upright stem. The flowers are medium to large and composed of four parts, the colour of which may by creamy, white, golden or red. The appearance of the outer parts is petal-like. Several of these are arranged in racemes on an elongated scape. The anthers are found within the floral tube, distinguishing the genus from many other Proteaceae. The foliage is fleshy or leathery, glabrous, large, bluish green leaves whose structure is narrow and tapering, it repeatedly bifurcates at the tip. The cavities of the leaves give a rough appearance. Species A description of Franklandia fucifolia was published in Robert Brown's 1810 paper On the Proteaceae of Jussieu, naming the genus after the botanist Thomas Frankland. Brown collected flowering specimens and seeds \\"In moist heaths near the shores\\" of King George Sound in 1801. The distribution of the species is recorded in the southern regions of the botanical province, along the coast to the eastern Esperance Plains. This species is sometimes found on sand over laterite. The height is between 300 mm to 1.3 metres. The long flowering period is from January to October. A second species, Franklandia triaristata, was described by George Bentham in 1870. This is a rarer population, recorded in a smaller distribution range at the south-western corner of the state. A smaller shrub than F. triaristata, up to a metre in height, the shorter flowering period is from August to October.

His philosophy of \\"life is art, art is life\\" inspired and influenced many of his students. Early life and family Admondo Dondes Rubbo was born in New Haven, Connecticut. In February 1945, at the age of eighteen, he enlisted in the army where he received three medals for his service to his country. After the war, he settled in New York City, and in 1952 he married Maria Fontanes. They had seven children, Edmund, Linda, Donald, Robert, George, Thomas and Diana. Don and Maria divorced in 1967. He then married Cathy Palermo in 1970, and they had one child, Michael. \\"Life is art, art is life\\" In 1962 Rubbo started a small Manhattan arts studio with friend Tom Daly and Daly's friend from the Art Students League of New York, Peter Max. They named it The Daly & Max Studio. Although his name was not on the business, Rubbo played a major part and the three worked as a group on books and advertising; Rubbo was known as the ampersand in \\"Daly & Max\\". In 1963, Daly, Max and Rubbo did the illustration, design and color for Helga Sandburg's (the daughter of poet Carl Sandburg) children's book Joel and the Wild Goose. In the mid-sixties, Rubbo was hired by Dr. Robert Jastrow, founder of the Goddard Institute for Space Studies, to draw maps for NASA. At the Goddard Institute for Space Studies, he became good friends with George Goodstadt, who later went on to found Bank Street Atelier, a lithography printing studio, and George Goodstadt, Inc. At the advertising giant Diener, Hauser, & Greenthal, Rubbo was the creative force behind the iconic images on movie posters for The Godfather (1972), The Endless Summer (1968), A Clockwork Orange (1971), and Chitty Chitty Bang Bang (1968), among others. Rubbo designed the distinctive font for Dove soap, which is still used today in their advertising. In 1967 Rubbo shared a studio with Max Menikoff, designing ads and package design. The studio was located in midtown Manhattan, on the east side. In the fall of 1967 Rubbo accepted twelve students from the High School of Art and Design in an apprenticeship program. According to one of the students, Fred Gerlach (F. August Gerlach), when the group showed up at the studio for their first meeting, Rubbo said, \\"Hello, what a motley crew. Let me introduce myself, they call me big balls Rubbo because I have a lot of tough nuts to crack in my life.\\" Rubbo with his sculpture at Max's Kansas City restaurant and nightclub, New York. Owner Mickey Ruskin purchased the sculpture for the restaurant. In 1968, Rubbo moved his family into 365 Canal Street, the former Canal Street Lumber Company building, and with the help of his students and children he ripped out the lumber racks and built one of the earliest artist's lofts in New York City's SoHo district. It became the center of life for many artists and creative spirits as well as some down-on-their luck acquaintances. Rubbo presided over the large kitchen table, and fed everyone who walked in the door. He filled this huge space with his multi-media sculptures, some of which were large styrofoam structures that he and his students and children carved, coated with clear acrylic and then painted with colors that seemed to breathe and pulsate under changing lights, creating the illusion of \\"living art\\". Rubbo working on a styrofoam sculpture in front of 365 Canal Street, New York, 1971 Don and his son Donald Rubbo planted one of the first community gardens in Manhattan's Lower West Side, in the weed-filled sidewalk plot next to the former Mead Paper site in Tribeca at Canal and Varick Streets. On the brick wall of the building, Rubbo created a \\"string painting\\", a spiderweb shape of string upon which morning glories grew up along the spiderweb design. In 1973 Rubbo moved to San Juan, Puerto Rico, for several years, and taught many young Puerto Rican artists at the Centro Nacional de las Artes (National Arts Center) in old San Juan. The Centro was housed in an old building that the Franciscan priests had made available to artists to use as studios, and was run at the beginning by Carlos Irizarry. Rubbo's students included Alex Chin (deceased), F. August Gerlach (Fred Gerlach), Carlos \\"Sue√±os\\" Ortiz, Peter Gaztambide, Dennis Mario Rivera, Ceferino D√≠az Ruiz, El√≠ Barreto, Maritza D√°vila, and Gloria Florit. Rubbo suffered from heart disease, and had his first heart attack in 1968. Another heart attack in 1969 limited his ability to work, and he underwent open heart surgery in 1973. He never fully recovered his health, and he died in January 1979, aged 52.About the artist, donrubbo.com References  External links  Category:Artists from New Haven, Connecticut Category:1926 births Category:1979 deaths Category:Pop artists Category:SoHo, Manhattan ","title":"Don Rubbo"},{"id":"24179324","text":"The Platinum Collection is a compilation album by German hard rock band Scorpions, released in 2005.

The series was published in Shogakukan's Weekly Sh≈çnen Sunday from August 2006 to February 2009, with its chapters compiled in twelve tank≈çbon volumes. Cirque du Freak follows the story of Darren Shan, a young boy turned into a half-vampire. He joins Cirque du Freak with his guardian, Larten Crepsley, who had turned him into a half-vampire. They share an uneasy relationship, often becoming confused about each others feelings and concerns, and Darren disliking Crepsley for taking away his human life. Steve Leonard, Darren's best friend while he was human, feels betrayed by Darren becoming a half-vampire and decides to become a vampire hunter in order to kill him. Cirque du Freak was licensed for release in North America by Yen Press and in the United Kingdom by HarperCollins. Yen Press was able to acquire the license because of their sister company, Little, Brown and Company, which publishes the original novels. The Yen Press edition also contained an excerpt from the original book series. The series has received relatively positive reviews from Western critics, with praise about its tone and story. The art and character designs were commended by critics, though noted as being awkward and over-the-top at times. Plot After attending a showing of a freak show known as \\"Cirque du Freak\\", a boy named Darren Shan feels inclined to steal a large tarantula from the spider-tamer and revealed vampire, Larten Crepsley. He learns how to control her through telepathy, but while practicing with his best friend, Steve Leonard, the spider is startled and bites Steve's neck. Though the bite doesn't kill him, Steve is left paralyzed and Darren seeks out Crepsely for an antidote. Crepsley agrees to give it to him, on the condition that Darren becomes a vampire; Darren accepts, and is turned into a half-vampire, and Steve is healed. Immediately after, Darren flees from Crepsley, afraid to lose his lifestyle, friends, and family. However, Darren soon realizes that he cannot handle his new strength and thirst for blood and returns to Crepsley. They stage Darren's death, but before departing from the town, Darren encounters Steve, who vows to become a strong vampire hunter and kill him, feeling betrayed. Despite needing human blood, Darren only drinks animal blood, and hates Crespley for changing him. He also feels alone, having no family or friends; he tries to blend in with other children, but his lack of control with his strength caused another boy to become injured. He confides to Crepsley about his situation and Crepsley decides to bring him to Cirque du Freak, knowing that Darren would be able to have friends and be himself when surrounded by other strange beings. Characters ;Darren Shan : is a young boy with an interest and love for spiders. Darren was drawn to the Cirque du Freak show because of the spider tamer, and was deeply amazed by the performance; enough so that he stole the spider. He is content living with his family, but decides to become a half- vampire and join Larten Crepsley to save the life of his friend, as he felt it was his responsibility. Even after Steve vows to kill him one day after becoming a strong vampire hunter, Darren does not tell Crepsley about the threat in order to keep Steve safe, believing that he is still his best friend. He and Steve then fight in the 12th manga. ;Steve Leonard : is Darren's best friend who has a deep interest in vampires. He discovered that Larten was a vampire, and begged him to turn him into one. Larten tests his blood, and tells him that the blood is \\"bad\\", and that Steve is wicked and evil. Steve is the first to realize that Darren is no longer human, and leaves to become a strong vampire hunter able to kill Darren. Steve has remarked that his father no longer lives with him and that he feels his mother doesn't love him; he had felt that Darren was the only person he would truly miss if he had become a vampire. ;Larten Crepsley : is a vampire who works as a spider-tamer at Cirque du Freak and Darren's guardian. He sees great potential in Darren and bloods him so that he can train him. Though Crepsley has acted cold towards Darren and tests him under a guise of friendliness, he also shows concern for him and regrets changing him after seeing Darren's unhappiness. It was his idea to bring Darren to the Cirque, as well, to try and better Darren's situation. Despite being a vampire, Crepsley believes that they are not monsters until they kill humans, and refuses to turn someone who is evil into a vampire. Production The manga series was based on a series of 12 books by author Darren Shan. Arai received a call from his editor in 2006, and was informed about a contest in which an artist would make a manga rendition of Cirque du Freak. Shan would act as the \\"final judge\\", who decided out of the applicants who would be chosen. Arai \\"drew up a chapter or two\\", and in April 2006, he was accepted as the contest winner. Arai used a \\"touch\\" of his brother's version in a scene where Darren catches Cirque du Freak tickets. His brother also designed backgrounds and the characters Hans Hands, Alexander Ribs, and Gertha Teeth. Arai mentions that during the production of volume two was when he \\"truly learned the difference in depiction between a novel and a manga.\\" He noted that manga \\"has a tendency\\" to be more \\"straightforward than a novel\\", due to its use of art. Altogether, Arai felt that depiction was \\"very fun\\", but still an \\"exasperating process\\". Cirque du Freak was serialized weekly as well, so Arai had \\"to cram a hook and climax into an eighteen-page every single week\\". In order \\"to make the story fit\\", Arai was forced to remove scenes. Arai expressed that he would have liked to have spent more time on the Trials of Death and the Festival of the Undead during volume five, but was forced to condense the original novel to fit into one volume of manga. To create background art, Arai gathered references from photographs taken during his childhood in Scotland. In addition, Darren's house is based on his Scotland home. Manga Cirque du Freak is illustrated by Takahiro Arai and based on The Saga of Darren Shan, a book series by Darren Shan. It originally ran in Shogakukan's magazine Weekly Sh≈çnen Sunday from August 23, 2006 to February 18, 2009. Shogakukan compiled its individual chapters into twelve tank≈çbon volumes. The first volume was released on November 17, 2006, under the title Darren Shan. The final volume was published on April 17, 2009. At the 2008 San Diego Comic-Con International, Yen Press announced that they had acquired rights to translate and publish the series in English. The first three volumes were set to be released to coincide with the film Cirque du Freak: The Vampire's Assistant. It was Yen Press' first title from Shogakukan, a \\"feat\\" in that Shogakukan is a co-owner of another manga publisher in North America, Viz Media. Little, Brown and Company, a sister company to Yen Press, helped Yen Press obtain the license because it publishes the original novel series. Yen Press' edition of the first volume was released on June 9, 2009 in North America under the name Cirque du Freak and contained an excerpt from the book series in the back of the volume. ' Cirque du Freak has been licensed for release in the United Kingdom by HarperCollins under their HarperCollin's Children's Books imprint. HarperCollins released the first volume on May 28, 2009, with the series entitled as The Saga of Darren Shan. Cirque du Freak was also licensed and released in France by Pika √âdition and in Taiwan by Sharp Point Press. Reception The first volume of Cirque du Freak was listed on the American Library Association's \\"2010 Great Graphic Novels for Teens\\", a list compiling graphic novels that \\"meet the criteria of both good quality literature and appealing reading for teens\\". Cirque du Freak has received relatively positive reviews from Western critics. Cirque du Freak was listed by GraphicNovelReporter as a top pick in graphic novels for the summer of 2009. references In GraphicNovelReporter's John Hogan's review for the first volume, Arai's art was praised, with Hogan noting that he did \\"a superb job of creating a manga that feels like a healthy mix of styles, both American and Japanese.\\" Writing for School Library Journal, Snow Wildsmith reviewed the first volume positively, noting the emotion and introspection present in it, but commented that though its \\"strong and holds together well\\", it \\"felt like it was just set up for the later volumes.\\" PopCulture Shock's Grant Goodman graded the first volume with an \\"A\\", calling the character designs \\"strange- but-lovely\\" and that pace of the \\"second half\\", which \\"rushes forward at a breakneck pace\\", causes \\"Darren Shan's tale [to be] a standout title among the glut of standard shonen manga.\\" The second volume was reviewed by Goodman in July 27, 2009's \\"Manga Minis\\" review segment. Goodman also rated the volume with an \\"A\\" and commended the pacing, as well as saying that the darkness allowed for it to be \\"accessible to an older audience\\". Deb Aoki, writing for the website About.com, rated the first volume with 3 and a half stars out of 5, commending its character designs, appeal to fans, and story. However, she also noted that the gore \\"might disturb sensitive readers\\", and pointed out some scenes as being too \\"over-the-top\\" emotionally and that the art was prone to \\"awkwardly-drawn moments\\" that distract readers. Manga Life's Joy Kim criticized that the first volume was \\"extremely predictable\\" and the art as \\"occasionally awkward\\", but felt it was \\"a good alternative\\" to sh≈çjo series focusing on vampires \\"with the emotional maturity and tortured love lives of emo high school students\\". Grant Goodman rated the fifth volume with an \\"A\\", concluding that it is \\"brimming with action, mystery, and betrayal‚Äîall of which add up to a create a manga you do not want to miss.\\" References External links *Yen Press' page for Cirque du Freak *The Saga of Darren Shan's official website *The Saga of Darren Shan's Manga Cover Listing * Category:2006 manga Category:Action anime and manga Category:Comics based on fiction Category:Horror anime and manga Category:Sharp Point Press titles Category:Shogakukan manga Category:Sh≈çnen manga Category:Supernatural anime and manga Category:The Saga of Darren Shan Category:Vampires in anime and manga Category:Yen Press titles ","title":"Cirque du Freak (manga)"},{"id":"24179355","text":"Dudenville (also Chambersville, or Chambersburg) Nelson, Betty, page 6, \\"Dudenville nee Chambersville also known as Chambersburg,\\" Dade County Genealogical Society, 2002, (P.O.

Above is an image of Raonaid which was widely circulated in the aftermath. Raonaid Murray (6 January 1982 ‚Äì 4 September 1999) was an Irish murder victim, stabbed to death at the age of 17 in the early hours of Saturday morning, 4 September 1999. , this case remains unsolved.RT√â.ie 3 Sep., 2015 The murder weapon has not been located either. Each year her family and the Garda S√≠och√°na issue new appeals for fresh information. In 2009, a tribute website was set up but was targeted by vandals and naysayers who posted upsetting messages. By 2008, Raonaid was said to have \\"achieved iconic status\\", according to Kim Bielenberg of the Irish Independent, who remarked in one article that her image was still to be seen on the front pages of Ireland's newspapers on a regular basis. The case has been compared in the media to other unsolved incidents such as the disappearance of schoolboy Philip Cairns in 1986. Background of victim Raonaid Murray was born on 1 January 1982 to parents Jim and Deirdre Murray and lived in Glenageary, South Dublin. Raonaid is the Irish name for Rachel. She had two siblings, an older brother and an older sister. She attended St Joseph of Cluny secondary school in Killiney where she achieved highly in her Junior Certificate before completing her Leaving Certificate examinations in June 1999. On finishing school she worked part-time in a fashion boutique in D√∫n Laoghaire but intended to re-sit her Leaving Cert at the Institute of Education in Leeson Street and hoped to attend the arts faculty in University College Dublin upon completion. She liked reading and poetry, with her favourite play being \\"Under Milk Wood\\" by Dylan Thomas, and hoped to one day be a success as a professional writer. She wore a blue stud in her nose, was known for dressing in bright colours and pursued an active social life. Murder Raonaid spent the evening of 3 September 1999 socialising in Scotts pub on Georges Street, D√∫n Laoghaire, a place she knew well. She had just finished her shift in the boutique at 9:00pm. It was to be the place where she was last seen alive. She left at approximately 11.20pm, planning to meet friends again later, and started the 15-minute walk home. It is believed that she argued with a man described as being in his mid 20s an estimated 25 minutes after leaving the pub in the laneway between Silchester Road and her home in Silchester Park. Witnesses heard a female voice expressing a cry of \\"leave me alone\\", \\"go away\\" or something similar. \\"Fuck off\\" was also heard. This was followed by a scream. Raonaid was stabbed four times in the side, chest and shoulder with a one-and-a-half-inch sharp knife while in Silchester Crescent. Her murderer escaped and Raonaid staggered 200 feet before she collapsed and died from her injuries. Her body was found by her sister Sarah 50 yards from her home, at 12:20am on the morning of Saturday 4 September. Raonaid was not sexually assaulted nor were her possessions stolen. Investigation An investigation was launched; however, a motive has never been found. More than 100 Garda√≠ were assigned to the case at its peak. By 2008, more than 8,000 people were interviewed and almost 3,000 statements taken. There were 12 arrests. The knife used to murder Raonaid has never been found. In the build-up to the first anniversary of Raonaid's murder in 2000, there were fresh appeals for information by Garda√≠ and Detective Inspector Eamon O'Reilly appealed to listeners of Morning Ireland for assistance. Each year, Raonaid's family issue an appeal for more information. They have offered a reward of ‚Ç¨190,000. These appeals for information have been renewed, particularly with authorities suspecting that any young people who may have witnessed the crime may now have reached the correct level of maturity to discuss what they saw. On the tenth anniversary of Raonaid's murder in 2009, garda√≠ issued descriptions of a male and female who they wanted to interview on the matter. Profile of killer A forensic profile of the killer suggested that it would be a young man, in his mid- to late twenties, single, living either alone or with his mother. He would have been a loner, possibly with a drug problem, and may have been in psychiatric care at some point. He would also have had a history of anti-social behaviour and would be unlikely to have had any intimate relationships. The profile indicated a likelihood he would kill again. Suspects There have been suspects for the murder since it took place: * The earliest suspect was a man in his mid-twenties, five foot ten in height, with sandy-coloured Oasis-style hair like that of Noel Gallagher, who was wearing light coloured combat trousers and a beige top seen arguing with her less than an hour before she was killed. * A taxi-driver reported picking up a young man with blood on his trousers in the early hours of that Saturday morning and taking him to Granville Road at the top of Newtownpark Avenue, Blackrock. He dropped the man at a house there and felt he did not see him go inside. House-to-house inquiries carried out at the time did not find anyone fitting the description living on the road. Later in the investigation, a suspect was found to have been living at the time on the other side of Newtownpark Avenue. He was arrested and questioned, but there was no evidence.http://archives.tcm.ie/irishexaminer/2000/02/17/current/ipage_2.htm# Irish Examiner 17/02/00. Retrieved 31 August 2009 * A cook was arrested and questioned but later released without charge. * A young man seen dancing with Raonaid at a nightclub and then \\"hassling\\" her in an Abrakebabra fast food restaurant on 29 July 1999. *Farah Swaleh Noor, a Kenyan immigrant who was killed and dismembered in March 2005 by Linda and Charlotte Mulhall, two sisters from Dublin. He allegedly threatened their mother, Kathleen Mulhall saying \\"I'm going to fucking kill you, just like I did with Raonaid Murray\\", although he was allegedly drunk at the time. Noor, who was questioned during the initial investigation, has since been ruled out; Garda√≠ believe he claimed responsibility to upset Mulhall. Cold case investigation A unit of experienced Garda√≠ called The Garda Serious Crime Review Team under detective superintendent Christy Mangan began a review of the case in July 2008. They identified a number of mistakes and oversights in the original investigation. It recommended renewed searches for the murder weapon and found areas of failings: * It determined that some potential witnesses who came forward with information at the time were followed up on incorrectly. * There was tension between Garda units during the original investigation which meant that communication was not as effective as it could have been. * Irregularities in a statement by one witness including an allegation of forgery which was referred to the Garda S√≠och√°na Ombudsman Commission. The review team suggested new theories: * It was not the work of a random killer, that Raonaid knew her killer as there was no record of a similar attack happening before or after this particular crime anywhere in the Dublin region. * The nature of the attack would suggest that whoever killed the victim held some sort of personal grudge. Raonaid was killed by a female. The woman may have been known to Raonaid and she was killed after a personal disagreement caused the schoolgirl to break off contact with her. They identified a woman in her 30s who had a reputation for violence against women. She left the country a year after the murder and still lives abroad. Tribute website On 28 August 2009, a website was launched by Jim and Deirdre Murray as a tribute to Raonaid and to generate awareness of the case. It received 50,000 hits in its first two days. However, the website was taken down due to the posting of a large proportion of abusive messages, necessitating a further Garda investigation into the matter.

Following the ship's disappearance there had been rumours that her wooden superstructure was rotten, or that her boilers had blown up. Those at the scene found what timbers that remained to be sound, and there was no sign that the hull had been damaged by an internal explosion. Other parts of the ship have been recovered over the years. A hull which is thought to be that of Waubuno can be found in waters 15 ft (4.5 metres) deep at , near Wreck Island. though the identification is disputed. Its rudder can be found on display at Midland Ontario's Huronia Museum. Its anchor was recovered in 1959.  Notes  Further reading *Hunter, Douglas.

Her studies have concentrated on the demography, behavior, social organization, and population dynamics of the African elephants of Amboseli. She is the director of the Amboseli Elephant Research Project, and is the program director and trustee for the Amboseli Trust for Elephants (ATE). Life and work Early life and education Cynthia Jane Moss was born in Ossining (town), New York on July 24, 1940. Her father, Julian, was a publisher of several small-town newspapers, and her mother, Lillian, left her work as a legal secretary to raise Cynthia and her older sister, Carolyn. Moss‚Äôs appreciation for nature began early as her love for horseback riding allowed her to explore and observe the outdoors. She began riding horses at the age of 7, and by age 12, she had her own horse, Kelly. Her passion for horseback riding led her to attend Southern Seminary, a private boarding school with a distinguished riding program during her junior and senior years. She attended Smith College where she took many classes in arts and literature, and where she earned her B.A. in philosophy in 1962. Career In 1964, she was hired as a news researcher and reporter for Newsweek, where she did interviews on religion and theater. In 1967, Moss took a leave of absence so she could see the African continent herself, which had been described to her in letters by her college friend, Penny Naylor, who had recently moved to Africa. It was on this trip that Moss visited British elephant researcher Dr. Iain Douglas-Hamilton‚Äôs camp in Lake Manyara National Park in northern Tanzania, which is where she ‚Äúbecame completely hooked on elephants.‚Äù While she enjoyed working for Newsweek, the following year, she quit her job and moved to Africa to become a research assistant for Douglas-Hamilton, because \\"the pull of Africa was stronger\\". In these studies, they discovered that elephants could be identified by their ears because no two elephant‚Äôs ear shapes, or combinations of markings and veins, were alike, which Moss describes in her first book Portraits in the Wild. She continued to work with Douglas-Hamilton until the fall of 1968, when his project ended and he returned to England. Although her work with Douglas- Hamilton had ended, Moss was determined to stay in Africa and continue studying and working with the wildlife. To gain the experience and credentials she needed to begin her own study of elephants, she worked with Sue and Tony Harthoorn in Nairobi, Kenya as a veterinary assistant, assisted in research on plains animals and elephant feeding behavior in Tsavo National Park, and became an editor for the newsletter of the African Wildlife Foundation (AWF), Wildlife News. In 1972, Moss was encouraged by ecologist David Jonah Western to consider studying the last undisturbed elephant herd in Africa, in the Amboseli National Park in Kenya. So in September, Moss teamed up with Harvey Croze, and they began the Amboseli Elephant Research Project (AERP). Their first step they took was to catalog pictures of the elephants which would aid them in keeping track of and recognizing different elephants. In 1974, their budget was scarce and Harvey Croze left for other work. In 1975, Moss published her book Portraits in the Wild, which gave her respect in the field, and aided her in receiving a $5,000 grant from the AWF, thus allowing her to devote nearly all of her time to the study of the elephants of Amboseli. That year, Moss set up camp in the park and began to gather information on the elephant‚Äôs behavior, daily movements, and relationships. The TC and TD family units are the main subjects of her book Elephant Memories: Thirteen Years in the Life of an Elephant Family (1988). 1975 also marked the beginning of a period of very low rainfall in the Amboseli region, which took a significant toll on the elephants, but also gave Moss a clear view of elephant behavior in times of drought. Moss focused on elephant conservation in the late 1980s as she saw the elephant population halved by poaching for ivory and loss of habitat. And thanks to her work combined with many others and conservation groups, the African Elephant was placed on the Endangered species list in October of 1989 and in January of 1990, the sale of ivory was prohibited. In 2001, she created the Amboseli Trust for Elephants (ATE), which is a non- profit trust, which focuses on elephant conservation, management, and policy- setting. Moss is most famous for her study of Echo, an elephant matriarch who has been the subject of Moss‚Äôs book Echo of the Elephants: The Story of an Elephant Family and Little Big Ears (1993) along with several documentaries. Moss's studies have given a remarkable insight into the way elephants live, showing that they live in a highly organized, multi-tiered society that is led by a matriarch. The studies and findings of Moss and her team are reported and summarized in The Amboseli Elephants: A Long-Term Perspective on a Long-Lived Mammal.  Awards  Moss has received many awards in recognition of her dedication to the study of elephants in Amboseli including the Smith College Medal for Alumnae Achievement (1985), MacArthur Genius Fellowship (2001), and the Conservation Award from the Friends of the National Zoo and the Audubon Society. In addition, she has made four award-winning documentaries about elephants including An Apology to Elephants (2013) ‚Äì HBO, Echo: An Elephant to Remember (2010) ‚Äì PBS, Nature, Echo and Other Elephants (2008) ‚Äì BBC, David Attenborough, and Echo of the Elephants (2005) ‚Äì PBS, Nature. In 2019 she received an honorary doctorate from Yale University.

Between September and October the army fought in defensive operations around the region southwest of Bely on the Rzhev axis. On 17 October 1941 army was incorporated to the Kalinin Front and took part in the Kalinin Defensive Operation (5 December 1941 ‚Äì 7 January 1942). On 18 November army was again included into Western Front. As its army fought in the Klin-Solnechnogorsk Defensive Operation (15 November-5 December) and from 6 December on in the Klin‚ÄìSolnechnogorsk Offensive Operation (6‚Äì25 December). During the operation 30th Army together with 1st Shock Army liberated Klin (15 December) and destroyed large German units. As a part of Kalinin Front (from 17 December 1941) during January‚ÄìApril 1942 army participated in Rzhev-Vyazma Strategic Operation (8 January-20 April) In the end of operation army troops reached nearly to Rzhev and went on to the defence.

Craven at his desk, July, 1937, while he was still Chief Engineer of the FCC. Tunis Augustus Macdonough Craven (January 31, 1893 - 1972) (known by his initials T.A.M.) was a United States Navy officer in the first half of the 20th century involved in the development of radio and communications. Biography and Military Career Born in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, Craven was given the name of the Union U.S. Navy Commander Tunis Augustus Macdonough Craven (January 11, 1813 to August 5, 1864) who famously went down with his ship, the USS Tecumseh (1863), during the American Civil War at the Battle of Mobile Bay. The younger Craven graduated from the United States Naval Academy in 1913. He was a Navy engineer involved in the early history of radio and a close friend of Stanford C. Hooper. His first cruise was aboard the USS Delaware, a battleship in the Atlantic Fleet, where he served as the radio officer, moving in 1915 to the staff of the Commander in Chief, U.S. Asiatic Fleet as the fleet radio officer and fleet intelligence officer. In 1917 he was ordered to the Office of Director of Naval Communications, where he oversaw the organization and operation of the Navy's trans-Atlantic radio communications system during the war. In 1927 he served as a technical adviser to the U.S. delegation to Washington international communications conference, and subsequently served as executive officer aboard the oil tanker USS Sapelo. He resigned from active duty in 1930, immediately taking a reserve commission. He remained a commander in the reserves until 1944. Federal Communication Commission Craven served as Chief Engineer to the Federal Communications Commission between 1935 and 1937 before being appointed to the commission by President Franklin D. Roosevelt in 1937 (serving from 25 August 1937 to 30 June 1944).Gerald V. Flannery, Commissioners of the FCC, 1927-1994 (University Press of America, 1995), p. 51-55. A Democrat by party, he was frequently at odds with chairman (and fellow Democrat) James Lawrence Fly. He declined reappointment at the end of his term in 1944, choosing instead to return to private industry as the vice-president of Iowa Broadcasting Company, owned by the Cowles interests. After a long delay, FCC general counsel Charles R. Denny was nominated to succeed Craven in March, 1945.

The special was written by Theodor Geisel, based on his 1971 book of the same name.  Plot  One night, a young boy living in a polluted, grim ghost town wanders down 'The Street of the Lifted Lorax.' Along the dark street, he comes to the residence of a man named The Once-ler, a man in dark green- colored gloves whose face is never seen. He takes up an audience with the boy, and begins to explain the tale regarding the Lorax. The land once thrived with Truffula trees when the Once-ler first came to the area in a horse-drawn cart. Living among the foliage were the brown Bar-ba-Loots, who ate Truffula fruit from the local trees. In the nearby pond lived the Humming Fish, and the Swomee Swans flew overhead. The trees amazed the Once-ler with their texture and scent, and he soon built a small shop in the area. After cutting down a Truffula tree, the Lorax popped out of its stump. The Lorax claims to speak for the trees, and demanded to know what the Once-ler was doing. The Once-ler explained that he was using the Truffula tree's tufts to make something called a \\"Thneed... a fine something that all people need.\\" He insisted that he was only cutting one tree down and causing no harm, but when the Thneed sold quickly, the Once-ler began cutting down Truffula trees en masse to make more Thneeds. (It is also noted that the Truffula tree grows extremely slowly‚Äîten years before the seed even becomes a sapling and at least ten years after that to grow to maturity‚Äîmaking farming the tree impractical.) Soon, he called his relatives to help him grow his thriving business into a boomtown. As the Lorax protested against the Once-ler's actions, a bulldozer picked up the Truffula tree where he stood and the Lorax was thrown into a truck with the Truffula tree and caught in an assembly line. Some time later, at a major celebration, everybody reminisced about how Thneeds, Inc. started and how famous the Once- ler had become and how it had diversified, showing \\"Once-ler Cones\\", \\"Once-ler Burgers\\", a \\"Once-lermobile\\" and a blimp advertising Thneeds, then a stone with the word \\"Thneed\\" carved in it. Shortly after Thneeds, Inc. had produced its millionth product, the Lorax got out of the box and, despite his protests, fell back into the box to be shipped off with more finished Thneeds. All the while, the air was becoming increasingly polluted and darker as the industrialization progressed, the countless accumulated garbage was being dumped in rivers, and the few remaining Truffula trees were wilting. The Lorax continued to fight the Once-Ler. By this point the Lorax had to send the starving Brown Bar-ba-loots out of the area in search of food. After this, the Once-ler had his first bout with a guilty conscience; he justified his doubts by remarking \\"But if I didn't do them, then someone else would.\\" The Lorax then protested that the smog was suffocating the Swomee Swans, preventing them from singing, and thus the Lorax also had to send them away. The Once-ler protested that closing the factory would put countless employees out of work; the Lorax conceded that he had no answer to that. Finally, the pond that was home to the Humming Fish was filled with viscous toxic waste clogging the fish's gills and rivaling Lake Erie; they too were sent away over dry land. Confronted by the Lorax, the Once-ler appeared to be ready to act, until his secretary announced that the company's stock had shot upward. The elated Once- ler flipped from empathy to defiance, vowing to ramp up production even further‚Äîuntil at that moment, with the sound of an ax, the last remaining tree was cut down. With no raw materials, the factory was forced to close anyway, and the Once-ler's relatives all sadly departed. The Lorax glared at the Once- ler before he lifted himself by the seat of his pants, and disappeared through a tiny hole in the smog. On the spot where the Lorax last stood sits a small pile of rocks, with a word carved into one: \\"Unless.\\" The tale then switches back to the Once-ler talking to the boy, who is given the last Truffula seed by the Once-ler, encouraging the boy to help revitalize the long-dead trees by growing a brand new forest, with the possibility that the Lorax and all of his friends may then come back. The final scene shows the hole in the smog has grown larger, a sign of hope as the special ends.

These include the chemistry at Earth's surface, the rate of cooling of the planet's interior, the gravitational interactions with other objects in the Solar System, and a steady increase in the Sun's luminosity. An uncertain factor in this extrapolation is the continuous influence of technology introduced by humans, such as climate engineering, which could cause significant changes to the planet. The current Holocene extinction is being caused by technology and the effects may last for up to five million years. In turn, technology may result in the extinction of humanity, leaving the planet to gradually return to a slower evolutionary pace resulting solely from long-term natural processes. Over time intervals of hundreds of millions of years, random celestial events pose a global risk to the biosphere, which can result in mass extinctions. These include impacts by comets or asteroids, and the possibility of a massive stellar explosion, called a supernova, within a 100-light-year radius of the Sun. Other large- scale geological events are more predictable. Milankovitch theory predicts that the planet will continue to undergo glacial periods at least until the Quaternary glaciation comes to an end. These periods are caused by the variations in eccentricity, axial tilt, and precession of the Earth's orbit. As part of the ongoing supercontinent cycle, plate tectonics will probably result in a supercontinent in 250‚Äì350 million years. Some time in the next 1.5‚Äì4.5 billion years, the axial tilt of the Earth may begin to undergo chaotic variations, with changes in the axial tilt of up to 90¬∞. The luminosity of the Sun will steadily increase, resulting in a rise in the solar radiation reaching the Earth. This will result in a higher rate of weathering of silicate minerals, which will cause a decrease in the level of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere. In about 600 million years from now, the level of carbon dioxide will fall below the level needed to sustain C3 carbon fixation photosynthesis used by trees. Some plants use the C4 carbon fixation method, allowing them to persist at carbon dioxide concentrations as low as 10 parts per million. However, the long-term trend is for plant life to die off altogether. The extinction of plants will be the demise of almost all animal life, since plants are the base of the food chain on Earth. In about one billion years, the solar luminosity will be 10% higher than at present. This will cause the atmosphere to become a \\"moist greenhouse\\", resulting in a runaway evaporation of the oceans. As a likely consequence, plate tectonics will come to an end, and with them the entire carbon cycle. Following this event, in about 2‚Äì3 billion years, the planet's magnetic dynamo may cease, causing the magnetosphere to decay and leading to an accelerated loss of volatiles from the outer atmosphere. Four billion years from now, the increase in the Earth's surface temperature will cause a runaway greenhouse effect, heating the surface enough to melt it. By that point, all life on the Earth will be extinct. The most probable fate of the planet is absorption by the Sun in about 7.5 billion years, after the star has entered the red giant phase and expanded beyond the planet's current orbit. Human influence Anti-nuclear weapons protest march in Oxford, 1980 Humans play a key role in the biosphere, with the large human population dominating many of Earth's ecosystems. This has resulted in a widespread, ongoing mass extinction of other species during the present geological epoch, now known as the Holocene extinction. The large-scale loss of species caused by human influence since the 1950s has been called a biotic crisis, with an estimated 10% of the total species lost as of 2007. At current rates, about 30% of species are at risk of extinction in the next hundred years. The Holocene extinction event is the result of habitat destruction, the widespread distribution of invasive species, hunting, and climate change. In the present day, human activity has had a significant impact on the surface of the planet. More than a third of the land surface has been modified by human actions, and humans use about 20% of global primary production. The concentration of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere has increased by close to 30% since the start of the Industrial Revolution. The consequences of a persistent biotic crisis have been predicted to last for at least five million years. It could result in a decline in biodiversity and homogenization of biotas, accompanied by a proliferation of species that are opportunistic, such as pests and weeds. Novel species may also emerge; in particular taxa that prosper in human-dominated ecosystems may rapidly diversify into many new species. Microbes are likely to benefit from the increase in nutrient-enriched environmental niches. No new species of existing large vertebrates are likely to arise and food chains will probably be shortened. There are multiple scenarios for known risks that can have a global impact on the planet. From the perspective of humanity, these can be subdivided into survivable risks and terminal risks. Risks that humanity pose to itself include climate change, the misuse of nanotechnology, a nuclear holocaust, warfare with a programmed superintelligence, a genetically engineered disease, or a disaster caused by a physics experiment. Similarly, several natural events may pose a doomsday threat, including a highly virulent disease, the impact of an asteroid or comet, runaway greenhouse effect, and resource depletion. There may also be the possibility of an infestation by an extraterrestrial lifeform. The actual odds of these scenarios occurring are difficult if not impossible to deduce. Should the human species become extinct, then the various features assembled by humanity will begin to decay. The largest structures have an estimated decay half-life of about 1,000 years. The last surviving structures would most likely be open pit mines, large landfills, major highways, wide canal cuts, and earth-fill flank dams. A few massive stone monuments like the pyramids at the Giza Necropolis or the sculptures at Mount Rushmore may still survive in some form after a million years. Potential events The Barringer Meteorite Crater in Flagstaff, Arizona, showing evidence of the impact of celestial objects upon the Earth As the Sun orbits the Milky Way, wandering stars may approach close enough to have a disruptive influence on the Solar System. A close stellar encounter may cause a significant reduction in the perihelion distances of comets in the Oort cloud‚Äîa spherical region of icy bodies orbiting within half a light year of the Sun. Such an encounter can trigger a 40-fold increase in the number of comets reaching the inner Solar System. Impacts from these comets can trigger a mass extinction of life on Earth. These disruptive encounters occur at an average of once every 45 million years. The mean time for the Sun to collide with another star in the solar neighborhood is approximately , which is much longer than the estimated age of the Universe, at . This can be taken as an indication of the low likelihood of such an event occurring during the lifetime of the Earth. The energy release from the impact of an asteroid or comet with a diameter of or larger is sufficient to create a global environmental disaster and cause a statistically significant increase in the number of species extinctions. Among the deleterious effects resulting from a major impact event is a cloud of fine dust ejecta blanketing the planet, blocking some direct sunlight from reaching the Earth's surface thus lowering land temperatures by about within a week and halting photosynthesis for several months (similar to a nuclear winter). The mean time between major impacts is estimated to be at least 100 million years. During the last 540 million years, simulations demonstrated that such an impact rate is sufficient to cause 5‚Äì6 mass extinctions and 20‚Äì30 lower severity events. This matches the geologic record of significant extinctions during the Phanerozoic Eon. Such events can be expected to continue into the future. A supernova is a cataclysmic explosion of a star. Within the Milky Way galaxy, supernova explosions occur on average once every 40 years. During the history of the Earth, multiple such events have likely occurred within a distance of 100 light years; known as a near-Earth supernova. Explosions inside this distance can contaminate the planet with radioisotopes and possibly impact the biosphere. Gamma rays emitted by a supernova react with nitrogen in the atmosphere, producing nitrous oxides. These molecules cause a depletion of the ozone layer that protects the surface from ultraviolet (UV) radiation from the Sun. An increase in UV-B radiation of only 10‚Äì30% is sufficient to cause a significant impact to life; particularly to the phytoplankton that form the base of the oceanic food chain. A supernova explosion at a distance of 26 light years will reduce the ozone column density by half. On average, a supernova explosion occurs within 32 light years once every few hundred million years, resulting in a depletion of the ozone layer lasting several centuries. Over the next two billion years, there will be about 20 supernova explosions and one gamma ray burst that will have a significant impact on the planet's biosphere. The incremental effect of gravitational perturbations between the planets causes the inner Solar System as a whole to behave chaotically over long time periods. This does not significantly affect the stability of the Solar System over intervals of a few million years or less, but over billions of years the orbits of the planets become unpredictable. Computer simulations of the Solar System's evolution over the next five billion years suggest that there is a small (less than 1%) chance that a collision could occur between Earth and either Mercury, Venus, or Mars. During the same interval, the odds that the Earth will be scattered out of the Solar System by a passing star are on the order of one part in 105. In such a scenario, the oceans would freeze solid within several million years, leaving only a few pockets of liquid water about underground. There is a remote chance that the Earth will instead be captured by a passing binary star system, allowing the planet's biosphere to remain intact. The odds of this happening are about one chance in three million. Orbit and rotation The gravitational perturbations of the other planets in the Solar System combine to modify the orbit of the Earth and the orientation of its rotation axis. These changes can influence the planetary climate. Despite such interactions, highly accurate simulations show that overall, Earth's orbit is likely to remain dynamically stable for billions of years into the future. In all 1,600 simulations, the planet's semimajor axis, eccentricity, and inclination remained nearly constant. Glaciation Historically, there have been cyclical ice ages in which glacial sheets periodically covered the higher latitudes of the continents. Ice ages may occur because of changes in ocean circulation and continentality induced by plate tectonics. The Milankovitch theory predicts that glacial periods occur during ice ages because of astronomical factors in combination with climate feedback mechanisms. The primary astronomical drivers are a higher than normal orbital eccentricity, a low axial tilt (or obliquity), and the alignment of summer solstice with the aphelion. Each of these effects occur cyclically. For example, the eccentricity changes over time cycles of about 100,000 and 400,000 years, with the value ranging from less than 0.01 up to 0.05. This is equivalent to a change of the semiminor axis of the planet's orbit from 99.95% of the semimajor axis to 99.88%, respectively. The Earth is passing through an ice age known as the quaternary glaciation, and is presently in the Holocene interglacial period. This period would normally be expected to end in about 25,000 years. However, the increased rate of carbon dioxide release into the atmosphere by humans may delay the onset of the next glacial period until at least 50,000‚Äì130,000 years from now. On the other hand, a global warming period of finite duration (based on the assumption that fossil fuel use will cease by the year 2200) will probably only impact the glacial period for about 5,000 years. Thus, a brief period of global warming induced through a few centuries' worth of greenhouse gas emission would only have a limited impact in the long term. Obliquity The rotational offset of the tidal bulge exerts a net torque on the Moon, boosting it while slowing the Earth's rotation (not to scale). The tidal acceleration of the Moon slows the rotation rate of the Earth and increases the Earth-Moon distance. Friction effects‚Äîbetween the core and mantle and between the atmosphere and surface‚Äîcan dissipate the Earth's rotational energy. These combined effects are expected to increase the length of the day by more than 1.5 hours over the next 250 million years, and to increase the obliquity by about a half degree. The distance to the Moon will increase by about 1.5 Earth radii during the same period. Based on computer models, the presence of the Moon appears to stabilize the obliquity of the Earth, which may help the planet to avoid dramatic climate changes. This stability is achieved because the Moon increases the precession rate of the Earth's rotation axis, thereby avoiding resonances between the precession of the rotation and precession of the planet's orbital plane (that is, the precession motion of the ecliptic). However, as the semimajor axis of the Moon's orbit continues to increase, this stabilizing effect will diminish. At some point, perturbation effects will probably cause chaotic variations in the obliquity of the Earth, and the axial tilt may change by angles as high as 90¬∞ from the plane of the orbit. This is expected to occur between 1.5 and 4.5 billion years from now. A high obliquity would probably result in dramatic changes in the climate and may destroy the planet's habitability. When the axial tilt of the Earth exceeds 54¬∞, the yearly insolation at the equator is less than that at the poles. The planet could remain at an obliquity of 60¬∞ to 90¬∞ for periods as long as 10 million years. Geodynamics Pangaea was the last supercontinent to form before the present. Tectonics-based events will continue to occur well into the future and the surface will be steadily reshaped by tectonic uplift, extrusions, and erosion. Mount Vesuvius can be expected to erupt about 40 times over the next 1,000 years. During the same period, about five to seven earthquakes of magnitude 8 or greater should occur along the San Andreas Fault, while about 50 magnitude 9 events may be expected worldwide. Mauna Loa should experience about 200 eruptions over the next 1,000 years, and the Old Faithful Geyser will likely cease to operate. The Niagara Falls will continue to retreat upstream, reaching Buffalo in about 30,000‚Äì50,000 years. In 10,000 years, the post-glacial rebound of the Baltic Sea will have reduced the depth by about . The Hudson Bay will decrease in depth by 100 m over the same period. After 100,000 years, the island of Hawaii will have shifted about to the northwest. The planet may be entering another glacial period by this time. Continental drift The theory of plate tectonics demonstrates that the continents of the Earth are moving across the surface at the rate of a few centimeters per year. This is expected to continue, causing the plates to relocate and collide. Continental drift is facilitated by two factors: the energy generation within the planet and the presence of a hydrosphere. With the loss of either of these, continental drift will come to a halt. The production of heat through radiogenic processes is sufficient to maintain mantle convection and plate subduction for at least the next 1.1 billion years. At present, the continents of North and South America are moving westward from Africa and Europe. Researchers have produced several scenarios about how this will continue in the future. These geodynamic models can be distinguished by the subduction flux, whereby the oceanic crust moves under a continent. In the introversion model, the younger, interior, Atlantic Ocean becomes preferentially subducted and the current migration of North and South America is reversed. In the extroversion model, the older, exterior, Pacific Ocean remains preferentially subducted and North and South America migrate toward eastern Asia. As the understanding of geodynamics improves, these models will be subject to revision. In 2008, for example, a computer simulation was used to predict that a reorganization of the mantle convection will occur over the next 100 million years, creating a new supercontinent composed of Africa, Eurasia, Australia, Antarctica and South America to form around Antarctica. Regardless of the outcome of the continental migration, the continued subduction process causes water to be transported to the mantle. After a billion years from the present, a geophysical model gives an estimate that 27% of the current ocean mass will have been subducted. If this process were to continue unmodified into the future, the subduction and release would reach an equilibrium after 65% of the current ocean mass has been subducted. Introversion A rough approximation of Pangaea Ultima, one of the three models for a future supercontinent Christopher Scotese and his colleagues have mapped out the predicted motions several hundred million years into the future as part of the Paleomap Project. In their scenario, 50 million years from now the Mediterranean Sea may vanish, and the collision between Europe and Africa will create a long mountain range extending to the current location of the Persian Gulf. Australia will merge with Indonesia, and Baja California will slide northward along the coast. New subduction zones may appear off the eastern coast of North and South America, and mountain chains will form along those coastlines. The migration of Antarctica to the north will cause all of its ice sheets to melt. This, along with the melting of the Greenland ice sheets, will raise the average ocean level by . The inland flooding of the continents will result in climate changes. As this scenario continues, by 100 million years from the present, the continental spreading will have reached its maximum extent and the continents will then begin to coalesce. In 250 million years, North America will collide with Africa. South America will wrap around the southern tip of Africa. The result will be the formation of a new supercontinent (sometimes called Pangaea Ultima), with the Pacific Ocean stretching across half the planet. Antarctica will reverse direction and return to the South Pole, building up a new ice cap. Extroversion The first scientist to extrapolate the current motions of the continents was Canadian geologist Paul F. Hoffman of Harvard University. In 1992, Hoffman predicted that the continents of North and South America would continue to advance across the Pacific Ocean, pivoting about Siberia until they begin to merge with Asia. He dubbed the resulting supercontinent, Amasia. Later, in the 1990s, Roy Livermore calculated a similar scenario. He predicted that Antarctica would start to migrate northward, and east Africa and Madagascar would move across the Indian Ocean to collide with Asia. In an extroversion model, the closure of the Pacific Ocean would be complete in about 350 million years. This marks the completion of the current supercontinent cycle, wherein the continents split apart and then rejoin each other about every 400‚Äì500 million years. Once the supercontinent is built, plate tectonics may enter a period of inactivity as the rate of subduction drops by an order of magnitude. This period of stability could cause an increase in the mantle temperature at the rate of every 100 million years, which is the minimum lifetime of past supercontinents. As a consequence, volcanic activity may increase. Supercontinent The formation of a supercontinent can dramatically affect the environment. The collision of plates will result in mountain building, thereby shifting weather patterns. Sea levels may fall because of increased glaciation. The rate of surface weathering can rise, resulting in an increase in the rate that organic material is buried. Supercontinents can cause a drop in global temperatures and an increase in atmospheric oxygen. This, in turn, can affect the climate, further lowering temperatures. All of these changes can result in more rapid biological evolution as new niches emerge. The formation of a supercontinent insulates the mantle. The flow of heat will be concentrated, resulting in volcanism and the flooding of large areas with basalt. Rifts will form and the supercontinent will split up once more. The planet may then experience a warming period as occurred during the Cretaceous period, which marked the split-up of the previous Pangaea supercontinent. Solidification of the outer core The iron-rich core region of the Earth is divided into a radius solid inner core and a radius liquid outer core. The rotation of the Earth creates convective eddies in the outer core region that cause it to function as a dynamo. This generates a magnetosphere about the Earth that deflects particles from the solar wind, which prevents significant erosion of the atmosphere from sputtering. As heat from the core is transferred outward toward the mantle, the net trend is for the inner boundary of the liquid outer core region to freeze, thereby releasing thermal energy and causing the solid inner core to grow. This iron crystallization process has been ongoing for about a billion years. In the modern era, the radius of the inner core is expanding at an average rate of roughly per year, at the expense of the outer core. Nearly all of the energy needed to power the dynamo is being supplied by this process of inner core formation. The growth of the inner core may be expected to consume most of the outer core by some 3‚Äì4 billion years from now, resulting in a nearly solid core composed of iron and other heavy elements. The surviving liquid envelope will mainly consist of lighter elements that will undergo less mixing. Alternatively, if at some point plate tectonics comes to an end, the interior will cool less efficiently, which may end the growth of the inner core. In either case, this can result in the loss of the magnetic dynamo. Without a functioning dynamo, the magnetic field of the Earth will decay in a geologically short time period of roughly 10,000 years. The loss of the magnetosphere will cause an increase in erosion of light elements, particularly hydrogen, from the Earth's outer atmosphere into space, resulting in less favorable conditions for life. Solar evolution The energy generation of the Sun is based upon thermonuclear fusion of hydrogen into helium. This occurs in the core region of the star using the proton‚Äìproton chain reaction process. Because there is no convection in the solar core, the helium concentration builds up in that region without being distributed throughout the star. The temperature at the core of the Sun is too low for nuclear fusion of helium atoms through the triple-alpha process, so these atoms do not contribute to the net energy generation that is needed to maintain hydrostatic equilibrium of the Sun. At present, nearly half the hydrogen at the core has been consumed, with the remainder of the atoms consisting primarily of helium. As the number of hydrogen atoms per unit mass decreases, so too does their energy output provided through nuclear fusion. This results in a decrease in pressure support, which causes the core to contract until the increased density and temperature bring the core pressure into equilibrium with the layers above. The higher temperature causes the remaining hydrogen to undergo fusion at a more rapid rate, thereby generating the energy needed to maintain the equilibrium. luminosity, radius and effective temperature compared to the present Sun. After Ribas (2010). The result of this process has been a steady increase in the energy output of the Sun. When the Sun first became a main sequence star, it radiated only 70% of the current luminosity. The luminosity has increased in a nearly linear fashion to the present, rising by 1% every 110 million years. Likewise, in three billion years the Sun is expected to be 33% more luminous. The hydrogen fuel at the core will finally be exhausted in five billion years, when the Sun will be 67% more luminous than at present. Thereafter the Sun will continue to burn hydrogen in a shell surrounding its core, until the luminosity reaches 121% above the present value. This marks the end of the Sun's main sequence lifetime, and thereafter it will pass through the subgiant stage and evolve into a red giant. By this time, the collision of the Milky Way and Andromeda galaxies should be underway. Although this could result in the Solar System being ejected from the newly combined galaxy, it is considered unlikely to have any adverse effect on the Sun or its planets. Climate impact The rate of weathering of silicate minerals will increase as rising temperatures speed up chemical processes. This in turn will decrease the level of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere, as these weathering processes convert carbon dioxide gas into solid carbonates. Within the next 600 million years from the present, the concentration of carbon dioxide will fall below the critical threshold needed to sustain C3 photosynthesis: about 50 parts per million. At this point, trees and forests in their current forms will no longer be able to survive. the last living trees being evergreen conifers. This decline in plant life is likely to be a long term decline rather than a sharp drop. It is likely that plant groups will die one by one well before the 50 parts per million level is reached. The first plants to disappear will be C3 herbaceous plants, followed by deciduous forests, evergreen broad-leaf forests and finally evergreen conifers. However, C4 carbon fixation can continue at much lower concentrations, down to above 10 parts per million. Thus plants using photosynthesis may be able to survive for at least 0.8 billion years and possibly as long as 1.2 billion years from now, after which rising temperatures will make the biosphere unsustainable. Currently, plants represent about 5% of Earth's plant biomass and 1% of its known plant species. For example, about 50% of all grass species (Poaceae) use the photosynthetic pathway, as do many species in the herbaceous family Amaranthaceae. When the levels of carbon dioxide fall to the limit where photosynthesis is barely sustainable, the proportion of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere is expected to oscillate up and down. This will allow land vegetation to flourish each time the level of carbon dioxide rises due to tectonic activity and respiration from animal life. However, the long-term trend is for the plant life on land to die off altogether as most of the remaining carbon in the atmosphere becomes sequestered in the Earth. Some microbes are capable of photosynthesis at concentrations of carbon dioxide as low as 1 part per million, so these life forms would probably disappear only because of rising temperatures and the loss of the biosphere. Plants‚Äîand, by extension, animals‚Äîcould survive longer by evolving other strategies such as requiring less carbon dioxide for photosynthetic processes, becoming carnivorous, adapting to desiccation, or associating with fungi. These adaptations are likely to appear near the beginning of the moist greenhouse (see further). The loss of higher plant life will also result in the eventual loss of oxygen as well as ozone due to the respiration of animals, chemical reactions in the atmosphere, and volcanic eruptions. This will result in less attenuation of DNA-damaging UV, as well as the death of animals; the first animals to disappear would be large mammals, followed by small mammals, birds, amphibians and large fish, reptiles and small fish, and finally invertebrates. Before this happens, it's expected that life would concentrate at refugia of lower temperature such as high elevations where less land surface area is available, thus restricting population sizes. Smaller animals would survive better than larger ones because of lesser oxygen requirements, while birds would fare better than mammals thanks to their ability to travel large distances looking for colder temperatures. Based on oxygen half-life in the atmosphere, animal life would last at most 100 million years after the loss of higher plants. However, animal life may last much longer since more than 50% of oxygen is currently produced by phytoplankton. In their work The Life and Death of Planet Earth, authors Peter D. Ward and Donald Brownlee have argued that some form of animal life may continue even after most of the Earth's plant life has disappeared. Ward and Brownlee use fossil evidence from the Burgess Shale in British Columbia, Canada, to determine the climate of the Cambrian Explosion, and use it to predict the climate of the future when rising global temperatures caused by a warming Sun and declining oxygen levels result in the final extinction of animal life. Initially, they expect that some insects, lizards, birds and small mammals may persist, along with sea life. However, without oxygen replenishment by plant life, they believe that animals would probably die off from asphyxiation within a few million years. Even if sufficient oxygen were to remain in the atmosphere through the persistence of some form of photosynthesis, the steady rise in global temperature would result in a gradual loss of biodiversity. As temperatures continue to rise, the last of animal life will be driven toward the poles, and possibly underground. They would become primarily active during the polar night, aestivating during the polar day due to the intense heat. Much of the surface would become a barren desert and life would primarily be found in the oceans. However, due to a decrease in the amount of organic matter entering the oceans from land as well as a decrease in dissolved oxygen, sea life would disappear too following a similar path to that on Earth's surface. This process would start with the loss of freshwater species and conclude with invertebrates, particularly those that do not depend on living plants such as termites or those near hydrothermal vents such as worms of the genus Riftia. As a result of these processes, multicellular life forms may be extinct in about 800 million years, and eukaryotes in 1.3 billion years, leaving only the prokaryotes. Loss of oceans The atmosphere of Venus is in a \\"super-greenhouse\\" state One billion years from now, about 27% of the modern ocean will have been subducted into the mantle. If this process were allowed to continue uninterrupted, it would reach an equilibrium state where 65% of the current surface reservoir would remain at the surface. Once the solar luminosity is 10% higher than its current value, the average global surface temperature will rise to . The atmosphere will become a \\"moist greenhouse\\" leading to a runaway evaporation of the oceans. At this point, models of the Earth's future environment demonstrate that the stratosphere would contain increasing levels of water. These water molecules will be broken down through photodissociation by solar UV, allowing hydrogen to escape the atmosphere. The net result would be a loss of the world's seawater by about 1.1 billion years from the present. There will be two variations of this future warming feedback: the \\"moist greenhouse\\" where water vapor dominates the troposphere while water vapor starts to accumulate in the stratosphere (if the oceans evaporate very quickly), and the \\"runaway greenhouse\\" where water vapor becomes a dominant component of the atmosphere (if the oceans evaporate too slowly). In this ocean-free era, there will continue to be surface reservoirs as water is steadily released from the deep crust and mantle, where it is estimated that there is an amount of water equivalent to several times that currently present in the Earth's oceans. Some water may be retained at the poles and there may be occasional rainstorms, but for the most part the planet would be a dry desert with large dunefields covering its equator, and a few salt flats on what was once the ocean floor, similar to the ones in the Atacama Desert in Chile. With no water to serve as a lubricant, plate tectonics would very likely stop and the most visible signs of geological activity would be shield volcanoes located above mantle hotspots. In these arid conditions the planet may retain some microbial and possibly even multicellular life. Most of these microbes will be halophiles and life could find refuge in the atmosphere as has been proposed to have happened on Venus. However, the increasingly extreme conditions will likely lead to the extinction of the prokaryotes between 1.6 billion years and 2.8 billion years from now, with the last of them living in residual ponds of water at high latitudes and heights or in caverns with trapped ice. However, underground life could last longer. What proceeds after this depends on the level of tectonic activity. A steady release of carbon dioxide by volcanic eruption could cause the atmosphere to enter a \\"super-greenhouse\\" state like that of the planet Venus. But, as stated above, without surface water, plate tectonics would probably come to a halt and most of the carbonates would remain securely buried until the Sun becomes a red giant and its increased luminosity heats the rock to the point of releasing the carbon dioxide. The loss of the oceans could be delayed until 2 billion years in the future if the atmospheric pressure were to decline. A lower atmospheric pressure would reduce the greenhouse effect, thereby lowering the surface temperature. This could occur if natural processes were to remove the nitrogen from the atmosphere. Studies of organic sediments has shown that at least of nitrogen has been removed from the atmosphere over the past four billion years; enough to effectively double the current atmospheric pressure if it were to be released. This rate of removal would be sufficient to counter the effects of increasing solar luminosity for the next two billion years. By 2.8 billion years from now, the surface temperature of the Earth will have reached , even at the poles. At this point, any remaining life will be extinguished due to the extreme conditions. If all of the water on Earth has evaporated by this point, the planet will stay in the same conditions with a steady increase in the surface temperature until the Sun becomes a red giant. If not, then in about 3‚Äì4 billion years the amount of water vapour in the lower atmosphere will rise to 40% and a \\"moist greenhouse\\" effect will commence once the luminosity from the Sun reaches 35‚Äì40% more than its present-day value. A \\"runaway greenhouse\\" effect will ensue, causing the atmosphere to heat up and raising the surface temperature to around . This is sufficient to melt the surface of the planet. However, most of the atmosphere will be retained until the Sun has entered the red giant stage. With the extinction of life, 2.8 billion years from now it is also expected that Earth biosignatures will disappear, to be replaced by signatures caused by non-biological processes. Red giant stage The size of the current Sun (now in the main sequence) compared to its estimated size during its red giant phase Once the Sun changes from burning hydrogen within its core to burning hydrogen in a shell around its core, the core will start to contract and the outer envelope will expand. The total luminosity will steadily increase over the following billion years until it reaches 2,730 times the Sun's current luminosity at the age of 12.167 billion years. Most of Earth's atmosphere will be lost to space and its surface will consist of a lava ocean with floating continents of metals and metal oxides as well as icebergs of refractory materials, with its surface temperature reaching more than . The Sun will experience more rapid mass loss, with about 33% of its total mass shed with the solar wind. The loss of mass will mean that the orbits of the planets will expand. The orbital distance of the Earth will increase to at most 150% of its current value. The most rapid part of the Sun's expansion into a red giant will occur during the final stages, when the Sun will be about 12 billion years old. It is likely to expand to swallow both Mercury and Venus, reaching a maximum radius of . The Earth will interact tidally with the Sun's outer atmosphere, which would serve to decrease Earth's orbital radius. Drag from the chromosphere of the Sun would also reduce the Earth's orbit. These effects will act to counterbalance the effect of mass loss by the Sun, and the Earth will probably be engulfed by the Sun. The drag from the solar atmosphere may cause the orbit of the Moon to decay. Once the orbit of the Moon closes to a distance of , it will cross the Earth's Roche limit. This means that tidal interaction with the Earth would break apart the Moon, turning it into a ring system. Most of the orbiting ring will then begin to decay, and the debris will impact the Earth. Hence, even if the Earth is not swallowed up by the Sun, the planet may be left moonless. The ablation and vaporization caused by its fall on a decaying trajectory towards the Sun may remove Earth's mantle, leaving just its core, which will finally be destroyed after at most 200 years. Following this event, Earth's sole legacy will be a very slight increase (0.01%) of the solar metallicity.¬ßIIC Post-red giant stage The Helix nebula, a planetary nebula similar to what the Sun will produce in 8 billion years After fusing helium in its core to carbon, the Sun will begin to collapse again, evolving into a compact white dwarf star after ejecting its outer atmosphere as a planetary nebula. The predicted final mass is 54.1% of the present value, most likely consisting primarily of carbon and oxygen. Currently, the Moon is moving away from Earth at a rate of 4 cm (1.5 inches) per year. In 50 billion years, if the Earth and Moon are not engulfed by the Sun, they will become tidelocked into a larger, stable orbit, with each showing only one face to the other. Thereafter, the tidal action of the Sun will extract angular momentum from the system, causing the orbit of the Moon to decay and the Earth's rotation to accelerate. In about 65 billion years, it is estimated that the Moon may end up colliding with the Earth, due to the remaining energy of the Earth‚ÄìMoon system being sapped by the remnant Sun, causing the Moon to slowly move inwards toward the Earth. On a time scale of 1019 (10 quintillion) years the remaining planets in the Solar System will be ejected from the system by violent relaxation. If Earth is not destroyed by the expanding red giant Sun and the Earth is not ejected from the Solar System by violent relaxation, the ultimate fate of the planet will be that it collides with the black dwarf Sun due to the decay of its orbit via gravitational radiation, in 1020 (Short Scale: 100 quintillion, Long Scale: 100 trillion) years.

Gaining commission in the Royal Indian Navy, he participated in World War II on behalf of Great Britain before joining the Pakistan Navy in 1947 as one of the senior staff officers. In 1969, he was appointed the Flag Officer Commanding of the Eastern Naval Command in East Pakistan during the civil war there, followed by the foreign intervention by India in 1971. After the war, he was taken as a war prisoner along with Lieutenant-General A.A.K Niazi, the commander of Pakistan Army's Eastern Command after conceding the surrender of the Pakistan Armed Forces personnel to the Indian Army. He resumed his active military service in the Navy after his repatriation from India and was appointed the Chief of Naval Staff in 1975 after the sudden death of Vice-Admiral Hasan Ahmed. He had the distinction of being the first four-star admiral in the navy and was the first admiral to be appointed as Chairman joint chiefs committee in 1978 until 1980. As the Chairman Joint Chiefs Committee, he continued to advocate for an aggressive foreign policy and a strong nuclear deterrent against the foreign intervention. After retiring from the military in 1980, Shariff was appointed as chairman of Federal Public Service Commission while he continued his role as military adviser to President Zia-ul-Haq until 1988 when he retired from public service. After living a quiet life in Islamabad, he announced the publishing of his memoirs, \\"Admiral's Diary\\", providing further accounts, causes, and failure of military crackdown in East Pakistan. Biography World War II and RIN career Mohammad Shariff was born in Gujrat, Punjab, British India, into an Kashmiri-Punjabi family in 1920. As many of his contemporaries, he was educated at the Rashtriya Indian Military College and joined the Royal Indian Navy (RIN) in 1936 as a sailor in the Communications Branch. He was trained as telegraphist with initially holding the rank as petty officer in the Royal Indian Navy 1937 and gained commission as Sub-Lieutenant in 1938 before participating in the World War II in 1940. One of his close colleagues at this time was Gautum Singh, whom he would fight against in 1971. He participated in the World War II as a signalist in the Royal Indian Navy on behalf of Great Britain and took part in military action in the Atlantic, Mediterranean, Red sea, and Bay of Bengal. In 1945, he went to the United Kingdom to attend the Britannia Royal Naval College in Dartmouth, England where he graduated with a staff course degree. Upon returning to India, he was promoted in the Royal Indian Navy as Lieutenant and took up an officer assignment in Bombay Dockyard to continue his career as leading telegraphist. In 1946, he formed the secret \\"Strike Committee\\" against the Royal Navy's appointment and had kept close contacts with Lieutenant Suresh Nanda at the start of the RIN mutiny against the Royal Navy. During the course of the mutiny, he coordinated secret messages among the mutineers who were seen to be moving across ships and establishments, in official vehicles, to speak to ratings at the behest of British naval authorities. Despite his role, he avoided the dismissal from his military service by the British inquiries when the mutiny was suppressed by the British Army and the Royal Navy. Amongst his Royal Indian Navy officers, he was described as a \\"smart and intelligent\\" officer. War and staff appointments in Pakistan Navy In 1947, the United Kingdom announced the partition of India after the failure of the cabinet mission sent in 1946. After the creation of Pakistan on 14 August 1947, Lieutenant Shariff decided to opt for Pakistan and joined the newly established Pakistan Navy. He was among the first twenty naval officers who joined the Royal Pakistan Navy (RPN) as a Lieutenant with a service number PN. 138. He was the 20th most senior Lieutenant in the navy in terms of seniority list provided by the Royal Indian Navy to the Ministry of Defense (MoD) in 1947. He proceeded his education at the Joint Services Defence College in Latimer in Buckinghamshire, England and graduated with the joint staff degree. In 1950s, he served on various assignments in the Pakistan military and served as a senior staff officer at the Navy NHQ from 1953‚Äì56 as Lieutenant- Commander. In 1960, he was promoted as Commander in the Navy and went to the United States where he attended the Naval War College in Newport, Rhode Island, and graduated with a master's degree in War studies in 1962. Upon returning to Pakistan in 1962, he was appointed as Deputy Chief of Naval Staff (Personnel) with a promoting rank of Captain at the NHQ. In 1965, Captain Shariff continued his staff appointment role as DCNS (Personnel) at the NHQ and participated in the second war with India in 1965. He participated in planning of the naval assault against the Indian Navy and provided his analysis based on personnel preparation for the operation. In 1966, he was promoted as Commodore and posted as DCNS (Operations) by the Commander in Chief Admiral Syed Mohammad Ahsan where he continued his role until 1969. In 1968, Commodore Shariff paid a goodwill visit to China alongside and held defence talks with the senior leadership of People's Liberation Army. Pakistan Eastern Naval Command Military map of East Pakistan, with Indian Army encircling the India-East Pakistan border. In 1969, Commodore Shariff was promoted as Rear-Admiral, a two-star rank, and posted in East Pakistan as Flag Officer Commanding (FOC) at the Eastern Naval Command HQ. His naval command was coordinated with the army's Eastern Command. During the same time, President General Yahya Khan appointed Admiral Syed Mohammad Ahsan as the Governor of East Pakistan and Lt.

Yaqub Khan as the commander of the army's Eastern Command, and the activities, momentum, and magnitude of the Pakistan Navy in East Pakistan increased at a maximum level, and more military and naval exercises began to take place in East Pakistan that initially focused on gathering intelligence on Indian infiltration in East. East Pakistan, under the martial law administration of Admiral Ahsan, saw the period of stability and the civil control and law and order situation was effectively under control. In 2010, Admiral Shariff authored his memories and concluded: In 1970, the Election Commission held the general elections in the country that resulted in Awami League securing the supermajority in the East while Pakistan Peoples Party claiming the mandate in Pakistan. When the agitations in East Pakistan began to gain momentum, President Yahya held meeting with Governor Vice-Admiral Syed Mohammad Ahsan and army's Eastern Command's commander Lieutenant-General Yaqub Ali Khan over their mission outcomes where both objected the brute force against the Bengali rebels. Despite opposition, President Yahya Khan authorized the Operation Searchlight and accepted the resignations from Governor Admiral Ahsan and General Yaqub, only to be appointed Lieutenant-General Tikka Khan as their capacity. The Searchlight resulted in quick success, but it had created a temporary momentum on Bengali rebels who started their insurgency from Barisal, a riverine city which the Army had failed to infiltrated. Therefore, Rear-Admiral Shariff's command was put in test when he authorized the launch of Barisal which resulted in immediate success, but it had no long-lasting effects. As the war progressed, he insisted on deployment of the combat warships to mount a serious pressure on the Indian Navy's Eastern Naval Command but the Navy NHQ did not grant his wishes in fear of losing the warships into the hands of the enemy. He personally led many operations undertaken after the deployment of the Marines and SSG(N) against the Eastern Command of the Indian Army despite logistical disadvantages. Overall, the Pakistan Navy performed its mission task well and diligently by providing support to the army until the end. However, while the Navy was successful by performing its task, Pakistan Army's Eastern Military Commands were unsuccessful to achieve their objectives. In the East, he earned his reputation as an effective commander within the military circles whose efforts had partially made the strategic shores of East Pakistan safe from the Indian Navy. Rear-Admiral Shariff was in attendance of every war meeting called by Lieutenant-General Niazi where he was presented every coordination mission led by the Army and the Navy. Liberation war and surrender The Indian Air Force's aerial campaign resulted in taking Sq. Ldr PQ Mehdi as war prisoner and dismantling the only No. 14 Squadron active in the East. Admiral Shariff authorized Lieutenant-Colonel Liaquat Asrar Bukhari to evacuate the Aviation Corps and take refuge to neighbouring Burma. When Air Commodore Inamul Haq, commander of Eastern Air Command, argued against the evacuation, Shariff strongly lobbied for the evacuation by convincing Lieutenant-General Niazi that Colonel Liaqat Bukhari should be allowed to give it a try, as several helicopters would be prevented from falling into enemy hands. General Niazi agreed with Rear-Admiral Shariff and ordered Colonel Liaqat to launch an evacuation operation immediately. Over several nights, the army aviators, large number of PAF pilots and personnel successfully left for Akyab in Burma. About the deployment of US Taskforce 74 in support to the Pakistani military, Admiral Shariff had notified General Niazi that \\"if the American Fleet had been coming to help them [Eastern Command], it would have established contacts with his HQ.\\" During the entire military conflict, insurgency was widely spread to entire provincial state, the East-Pakistan. The Indian Military had intervened in East-Pakistan, the Eastern Air Command and Eastern Military Command forced Lieutenant-General A. A. K. Niazi to surrender the Pakistan Eastern Command Forces to his counterpart Jagjit Singh Arora. In spite of Eastern Naval Command paying a heavy price, Admiral Shariff continued to keep the morale of Pakistan Navy personnel on high who were later pushed back to the wall by Mukti Bahni and the animosity of public that pounded the Pakistan Naval assets. As Indian Armed Forces entered in East-Pakistan, Shariff planned an immediate evacuation operation. He commanded and oversaw the maximum evacuation of Pakistan Naval assets from East Pakistan to Burma in a limited time. However, the night Pakistan Eastern Military High Command were surrendered, Shariff with a small number of military officers planned to leave as the Pakistan naval vessel was waiting for their evacuation. As the East-Pakistan fell, all the naval routes were closed by Indian Navy, forcing Shariff to remain in East-Pakistan. On 16 December, Rear-Admiral Mohammad Shariff surrendered his TT pistol to Vice- Admiral Nilakanta Krishnan, the Flag Officer Commanding-in-Chief Eastern Naval Command at 4:31pm (16:31hrs). His TT Pistol is still placed in \\"covered glass\\" display at the Indian Military Academy's Museum. Later, he joined General Niazi where he was presented at the time when the Instrument of Surrender was signed. Shariff was the only Admiral at that particular event, with thirty brigadiers, and four Major-Generals, and thousands of soldiers and personnel witnessed the event and instrument that Niazi signed. War prisoner and return Upon surrendering of the Eastern Command, Rear-Admiral Shariff was taken as prisoner of war (POW) and was taken adjacent Camp No. 77A, where many of the senior military officials were held, including Lieutenant-General Niazi, in 1971. In 1972, he was later shifted to Fort William in Calcutta where the U.S. Navy naval chief Admiral Elmo Zumwalt paid him a visit, followed by a visit of Indian naval chief Admiral S.M. Nanda. Later, Admiral Nanda transferred him to Jabalpur, to Rear-Admiral Gautum Singh who had done communications operations and specialization under Admiral Shariff in HMS Mercury during World War II. He also requested a copy of the Quran which he recited during his time of his imprisonment. On March 1973, the Indian government handed over Rear-Admiral Shariff to Pakistan government at the Wagha border. He was allowed to resume his military service and testified in the War Enquiry Commission, where he noted that: \\"the foundation for the defeat in East Pakistan could be traced back to the military coup d'√©tat in 1958 where senior officers became greedy self-serving politicians rather than soldiers.\\" In 1974, he was promoted as Vice-Admiral and appointed as Vice- Chief of Naval Staff under Vice-Admiral H.H. Ahmed despite the latter being junior to Vice-Admiral Shariff. Chief of Naval Staff On 23 March 1975, Vice-Admiral Shariff's appointment as Chief of Naval Staff was approved by Prime Minister Zulfikar Ali Bhutto after Vice-Admiral Hasan Hafeez Ahmed died of heart complications on 8 March 1975. At the time of his appointment, he was the most senior admiral and superseded no one. In 1976, Vice-Admiral Shariff was promoted to four-star rank Admiral by President Fazal Ilahi Chaudhry‚Äî the first four-star appointment in the history of the Navy since its establishment in 1947. Chairman Joint Chiefs of Staff On 22 January 1977, he was appointed acting Chairman Joint Chiefs of Staff Committee in the absence of General Muhammad Shariff and led the delegation to meet with Vice Chairman Li Xiannian when he paid a state visit to Pakistan. In 1977, Admiral Shariff supported the martial law enforced by Chief of Army Staff General Zia-ul-Haq after the popular civil unrest sparked after the general elections held in 1977. He was named deputy CMLA in the Military Council that is viewed to assist President Fazal Ilahi. In 1977, he was appointed acting Chairman Joint Chiefs of Staff Committee in the absence of General Muhammad Shariff who later resigned amid disagreement of the decision of the martial law on 22 January 1977. To sustain the presidency, the military staff appointments in the Navy and the Air Force were highly important for President Zia-ul-Haq to keep the inter-services loyal to General Zia-ul-Haq. In 1978, his appointment to the chairman joint chiefs was officially confirmed by President Ilahi after the involuntary resignation of General Muhammad Sharif. He was the second Chairman joint chiefs and the first admiral to have been appointed chairman joint chiefs. With Admiral Shariff appointed as Chairman joint chiefs, he invited Admiral Karamat Rahman Niazi to be appointed as Chief of Naval Staff in his capacity who was also promoted to the four-star rank. His experience as Deputy MLA in East Pakistan highly benefitted General Zia-ul-Haq to consolidate and stabilize the presidency of President Zia-ul-Haq in 1978. Soviet‚ÄìAfghan War On 25 December 1979, the Soviet Union officially intervened in Afghanistan and President Zia called for a national security meeting that was attended by the Chairman joint chiefs, chiefs of staff of army, navy, and air force. At this meeting, he made no intentions against Soviet involvement in East Pakistan's crises after witnessing the Soviet support to India and Mukti Bahini. After this meeting, Zia authorized this operation under General Rahman, and it was later merged with Operation Cyclone, a programme funded by the United States and the CIA. At this meeting, President Zia had asked Admiral Shariff and his army chief of staff General Khalid Mahmud Arif to lead a geo-strategic civil-military team to formulate a geostrategy to counter Soviet aggression. He played a crucial role in President Zia's policy on nuclear weapons and was a strong proponent for the implementation of the nuclear deterrent with a view to prevention of foreign intervention. He advised an aggressive policy towards supporting the Afghan mujahideen and supporting a covert but aggressive nuclear option to prevent the military infiltration from India and the Soviet Union. Later life and post- retirement In 1980, Admiral Shariff's retirement was due and decided not to seek an extension as he was succeeded by General Iqbal Khan. He was given an honorary guard of honour, and a monument under his name was built in Navy NHQ and the Joint Staff HQ. Upon retirement, he was appointed as Chairman of the Federal Public Service Commission and continued his role as military adviser to President Zia. However, he was given criticism for leading the appointment of those civil bureaucrats who were loyal to his government and his chairmanship, while those who were not were subsequently moved. He continued his role as military adviser and the chairmanship until the death of President Zia-ul-Haq in 1988 and took retirement from public service and his role as the military adviser to the Government of Pakistan. Admiral Shariff was a recipient of Hilal-i-Jurat, which was awarded to him after the 1971 war and the \\"Nishan-e-Imtiaz by Bhutto after coming back from India. After his retirement, he lived a quiet life in Islamabad surrounded and supported by close friends and family, and served as President of Elaf Club of Pakistan, a political and military think tank based in Islamabad. On 23 September 2010, Admiral Shariff wrote and launched his first autobiography \\"Admiral's Diary\\", in English. The ceremony was held at the Bahria University Auditorium. Chief of Naval Staff Admiral Noman Bashir was chief guest on the occasion. The book launching was attended by seasoned retired military officers and serving bureaucrats, senior retired and serving officers of the three services, family members and friends of the author, notable literary personalities, press and media. Shariff died on 27 April 2020.

It is one of 10 Anglican dioceses in the Province of Niger within the Church of Nigeria. The diocese was created in 1864 as the Diocese of Western Equatorial Africa. In 1920 the Diocese of Equatorial West Africa was divided into two: an eastern part (the continuing Diocese, now named the Diocese on the Niger) and a western part (a new Diocese, named the Diocese of Lagos). A part of the Diocese on the Niger was subsequently carved out in 1946 to create the Niger Delta Diocese. Originally part of Province Two of the Church of Nigeria when the church was divided into three provinces in 1997, Diocese on the Niger became a diocese in the Province of Niger when the Church was reorganised in 2002. The cathedral church of the diocese is the Cathedral Church of All Saints, Ozala, Onitsha. Started in 1949, the completed cathedral was dedicated for worship on 1 November 1992. The Bishop on the Niger is the Ordinary of the Diocese. The current (2017) bishop is the Right Revd Owen Chidozie Nwokolo. History The history of the Diocese on the Niger dates back to the Niger expeditions of 1830 ‚Äì 1857. After the 1841 expedition, the white missionaries realized that Africa was best evangelized by Africans. This realization led to Samuel Ajayi Crowther being given the privilege of playing a prominent role in the mission team to West Africa especially, the Igbo mission. The mission train under the leadership Dr. William Baikie arrived Onitsha on Sunday, 26 July 1857. On 27 July 1857 the King of Onitsha, Obi Akazua and his elders-in-council gave the party a warm official welcome. Hence, 27 July came to be regarded as the beginning of the Church Missionary Society (CMS) mission in Igbo land. It is important to note that J.C Taylor of Igbo origin played a vital role in the early mission activities in Igbo land. Rev J.C Taylor laid the foundation of the first Church in Igbo land in 1867, which was dedicated on 16 November 1870. Samuel Crowther was ordained for the Niger mission on Trinity Sunday in 1844, and consecrated as the first ever black Anglican bishop on the Feast of St Peter, 29 June 1864, by Charles Longley, the Archbishop of Canterbury at the Canterbury Cathedral. By this consecration, he became the bishop of the Diocese of Equatorial West Africa, with its headquarters in Onitsha. The Diocese of Equatorial West Africa is the forerunner of the Diocese on the Niger.

The design of the main building is largely rectangular in structure with semi-parabolic arches constructed from concrete and ironstone. The first building to be completed was the Lady Chapel in 1952 and consecrated by Leslie Vining. The other structures built included a rectangular transeptal tower oblong in shape, a nave of four bays and a narthex porch. Planning of the cathedral began in 1946 after World War II, a site was chosen overlooking the Niger River and close to the river market in the city. Construction of the cathedral began when the foundation stone was laid by then colonial Governor John McPherson.

Discovered in 1964 during reservoir construction, it is a primary historical attraction to the Ivaylovgrad area. It is classified as a monument of culture of national importance. Villa Armira lies some southwest of Ivaylovgrad. It was named after the Armira River, a minor tributary of the Arda. Villa Armira, a sumptuous palace villa, is one of the largest and most richly decorated Ancient Roman villas excavated in Bulgaria. It features rich marble decoration and complex floor mosaics, some geometric and some depicting animals and plants. The villa dates to the second half of the 1st century AD and originally belonged to a noble of Roman Thrace who is thought to have been the governor of the surrounding area. The two-storey U-shaped villa spreads over amidst a garden, with an impluvium in the middle. Villa Armira had 22 separate rooms on the ground floor alone in addition to a panorama terrace. The entire ground floor was covered in elaborately decorated white marble. The villa's floor mosaics display features typical of Ancient Roman art. The mosaics in the master's chamber depict the 2nd century AD owner with his two children: these are the only Roman-era mosaic portraits to be discovered in Bulgaria. A common theme in the villa's decoration is the gorgon Medusa. In the 3rd century AD, Villa Armira was expanded eastward with a triclinium and a hypocaust. Villa Armira is thought to have been destroyed in the late 4th century, possibly by the Goths some time around the Battle of Adrianople of 378. Today, the 2nd-century mosaic portraits of the owner and his children can be seen in the National Historical Museum in Sofia, the ceramic findings are exhibited in the National Archaeological Museum, while copies of the marble decoration are part of the Kardzhali Regional Historical Museum's fund. The villa itself, with many of the floor mosaics intact, underwent Phare-funded reconstruction and anastylosis and was opened for visitors in 2008.

History Although US Patent No.3,766,997 covering Mud Cleaner was issued on October 23, 1973 granted to J.K. Heilhecker and L.H. Robinson and assigned to Exxon Production Research Company, it was found invalid and efforts for re-issue was unsuccessful because of the existence of prior art filed at the British Patent Office by a German Inventor in the late 1800s. Nowadays, mud cleaner used in oilfield means the equipment processing drilling mud. It is combined with desander cone and desilter cone as well as bottom shaker. It is called 2nd and 3rd phase solids control equipment. Description A mud cleaner is a combination of desanders and/or desilters mounted over a shaker with a fine mesh screen. A mud is fed to the inlet of the hydrocyclone (desander and/or desilter) to separate particles and the underflow passes to the fine screen mesh where in particles larger than barite are discarded and thrown away. In most drilling operations, a mud cleaner is installed in its mud systems. It is usually located in a mud tank in the same location as with the desilters. Process flow The weighted mud flows to the inlet head section of the desander and/or desilter entering the hydrocyclones for separation of particles. Mud leaving the underflow is further screened with fine mesh to separate larger particles allowing only barite size particles to pass through the screen returning and recovering then the clean mud. Purpose The purpose of the mud cleaner is to remove drilled solids larger than barite. Solids larger than 74‚Äì105 micrometres can be removed by the mud cleaner before the viscosity builds up. Mud cleaner can effectively control weighted drilling fluid solid content. Prevent differential pressure sticking, adhesion stuck drill accident, reduce the drill string and the filter cake thickness on bond issues.

Assembly  Cellulose insulating material plants essentially exist of a feeding unit with primary reduction of the raw material, a dosing system for adding flame retarding agent, a defibration unit, a dedusting unit and the packaging unit.  Function  The raw material is given loose or in bales into the primary reduction unit (for example a shredder). After this reduction, the flame retardant is added. The core of the cellulose insulating material plant is a Whirlwind Mill. This mill is able to fray out the material, what leads to fluffy, optimally defibrated flocks that contain only very small amounts of dust. Furthermore the flame retardant is stuck to the flocks during the defibration process. After the mill the material is conveyed pneumatically to the dedusting unit, where the dusty air and the cellulose fibers get separated. The finished fibers come to the packaging station, where they will be weight and packaged.  Applications  Cellulose insulating material plants are used for the production of naturally insulating material out of raw material like newspapers, hemp, field grass and so forth. The insulating materials which are produced with this systems, are characterized by low energy input during the production compared to the conventional insulating materials such as mineral wool etc. References  External links  * Pictures and explanations Category:Industrial equipment ","title":"Cellulose insulating material plant"},{"id":"24179742","text":"Leon Bili≈Ñski Chevalier Leon de Bili≈Ñski (15 June 1846 in Zalischyky, Galicia, now Ukraine ‚Äì 14 June 1923 in Vienna) was a Polish-Austrian statesman of the Bili≈Ñski family.

In 1983, he was promoted to two-star rank, Rear-Admiral, and assumed his duties as Commander Karachi coast (COMKAR). In 1984, he was appointed as Commander Pakistan Fleet and promoted as Vice-Admiral in the Navy. In 1985, Vice-Admiral Sirohey was appointed as VCNS under Chief of Naval Staff Admiral Tariq Kamal Khan. Chief of Naval Staff On 8 April 1986, President Zia-ul-Haq announced to appoint Vice-Admiral Sirohey as a four star rank admiral and as the new Chief of Naval Staff in a place of retiring Admiral Tariq Kamal Khan. On 9 April 1986, Admiral Sirohey took over the command of the Navy from Admiral TK Khan. Before his four-star appointment was confirmed, he was in race with Vice-Admiral Ahmad Zamir who was initially appointed for the post but suddenly died of a heart attack before Vice-Admiral Zamir was notified about the promotion. He was the most senior admiral in the Navy; therefore, he supersedes no one in the Navy. His tenure as naval chief saw the enhancement of Navy in terms of both manpower and military procurement from the United States. As naval chief, Admiral Sirohey entered in complicated and expensive military procurement deal with the United States Navy in 1986. For that purpose in 1987, he went and visited United States and Pentagon to hold defence procurement talks with the United States military. In 1987, the United States agreed on transferring of eight Brooke-Garcia class surface warships and repair ship to the Pakistan Navy on a five-year lease under a Foreign Military Sales programme in 1988. Admiral Sirohey also oversaw the introduction of installing imported Harpoon missiles on its frigates as early as 1988. He also engaged in procuring the P-3C Orion aircraft for Navy but they weren't delivered until 1996. In 1988, he also visited China to strengthened military ties with China and Pakistan. Admiral Sirohey had backed decision of General Mirza Aslam Beg, the Chief of Army Staff, to restore the democratic rule after the death and state of President Zia-ul-Haq in 1988. He endorsed Chairman Senate Ghulam Ishaq Khan's bid for Acting President and witnessed the general elections held in 1988 that saw Benazir Bhutto becoming the Prime Minister while forming the government in 1988. Chairman Joint Chiefs In 1988, Prime Minister Benazir Bhutto appointed Admiral Sirohey as the next Chairman Joint Chiefs of Staff Committee to fill the vacancy caused by the death of General Akhtar Abdur-Rahman. Admiral Sirohey was the most senior four-star officer in the military and supersedes no one. At the military science circles, Admiral Sirohey was said to be fascinated with the latest technology made him look at the possibilities of procuring a nuclear submarine from China to counter India's acquisition Charlie-class nuclear submarine. On multiple occasions, Admiral Sirohey lobbied for procuring the nuclear submarine from China on a short-term lease and had been a strongly advised for maintaining a strong nuclear deterrence. As Chairman joint chiefs, Admiral Sirohey consolidated the nuclear arsenals development under the patronage of Joint Chiefs of Staff Committee as its policy enforcement institution while tightening the security around the program. In 1988, he worked with Prime Minister Benazir Bhutto on reaching with an agreement with India to exchange information on each other's nuclear facilities to avoid unintentional accidents and contingency plans to attack each other's facilities. In 1989, he held meetings with Brigadier-General Ali Shamkhani, the Commander of the Iranian Revolution Guard, to hold talks on mutual defence interests. However, it was recently revealed by historian that Shamkhani directly demanded the \\"hand over of the nuclear bombs\\" as part of the promised made by former president. Upon hearing this demands, Admiral Sirohey demurred and General Shamkhani became irate. However, the claim of this meeting cannot be verified as Razaei later confessed that Admiral Sirohey did not recall the meeting \\"or ever hearing about a deal to sell nuclear weapons to Iran.\\" Admiral Sirohey, acting as military adviser to Prime Minister Benazir Bhutto and President Ghulam Ishaq Khan, supported the government's decision to support the Soviet Union's withdrawal from Afghanistan in 1989. After Prime Minister Benazir Bhutto paid her first state visit to the United States, Admiral Sirohey caught between the political rivalry between President Ghulam Ishaq and Prime Minister Benazir. In 1989, Prime Minister Benazir Bhutto controversially signed retirement papers and relieved him from the command of the military in order to bring up army chief General Beg in his place. This move was seen as a political move and Benazir Bhutto's attempt to control the military through army and loyalist officers and was said to be a direct attack on military by the political leader. The retirement papers were deemed null and ineffective when President Ghulam Ishaq confirmed that Admiral Sirohey completing his term until 1991 and handled the matters very efficiently. After the matter became public, Chairman joint chief Admiral Sirohey and army chief General Beg fell out with Prime Minister Benazir Bhutto as both suspected that the Prime Minister wanted to get rid of them. Admiral Sirohey became supportive of President Ghulam Ishaq dismissal of Prime Minister Benazir Bhutto in 1990, and witnessed the inauguration of Nawaz Sharif becoming the Prime Minister. In 1990, Admiral Sirohey arranged and held state dinner for United States Central Command's commander General Norman Schwarzkopf where, together with army chief General Beg, brief the USCENTCOM on Pakistan Armed Forces battle preparations and military operational capabilities of Pakistan armed forces in Saudi contingent. Retirement On 8 November 1991, Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif nominated General Shamim Alam as the next Chairman Joint Chiefs of Staff Committee and was confirmed by President Ghulam Ishaq. On 9 November 1991, Admiral Sirohey retired from his forty-year long military service when his term as Chairman ended and was given a guard of honour by General Shamim Alam. Following his retirement, he also founded the Foundation for the Advancement of Engineering Sciences and Advanced Technologies‚Äî a think tank dedicated for promoting science and technology in the country where he is its Chief Executive. In 1992, one year into his retirement, Sirohey joined Sustainable Development Policy Institute and later affiliated himself with The Institute of Strategic Studies in 1995 which he currently works there as a strategist. He is also the author of his autobiography, Truth Never Retires (1996) Jang Publishers, Lahore. Personal life Sirohey is married, and has four sons, Saad, Asad, Samad & Fahd.

The song was released by EMI Latin in 1992, as the album's second single. Its lyrics explore a friendship built on the strong, unrequited feelings of the male narrator. Torres composed \\"Buenos Amigos\\" after attending a showcase event at which Selena was performing. Critics praised the song for being Selena's first number one, while others complimented its ballad-like feeling. According to Billboard, the recording began Selena's career as a dominant Latin chart artist. It was credited for the increased airplay Selena received on regional Mexican and Tejano radio stations, which had previously dismissed her recordings. Selena and Torres were nominated at the 1992 Billboard Music Video Awards and the 1992 Tejano Music Awards. \\"Buenos Amigos\\" peaked at number one on the US Billboard Hot Latin Songs chart; it was Torres' second number one in his career, and Selena's first. The single's accompanying music video featured Torres and Selena backed by an orchestra. Cover versions of the song were recordings by Mariana Seoane and Pablo Montero, Tairon and Ana√≠s, and Lucero Terrazas. Background and release \\"Buenos Amigos\\" was written by Salvadoran recording artist √Ålvaro Torres and produced by Enrique Elizondo. Originally the song was intended to be sung with Ver√≥nica Castro, but then Torres left his previous record company. After seeing American Tejano pop singer Selena perform at a showcase event, Torres immediately wanted to record a duet with her. He said in Selena Remembered; a documentary about her career, \\" ... she had an attractive way about her that was always present. We got along very well and a friendship developed from that point on. Several months later I wrote a song which I thought would be good to record a duet with Selena.\\" \\"Buenos Amigos\\" was recorded for Torres' tenth studio album Nada Se Compara Contigo (1991). \\"Buenos Amigos\\" has been included on several compilation albums released by Torres and Selena. Following Selena's death in 1995, the track has been included on Ones (2002), Momentos Intimos (2004), and La Leyenda (2010). Torres included the track on Mis Mejores Canciones: 12 Super Exitos (1993), El Angel de la Ternura (1997), Solo Para Enamorados: 16 Exitos (2000), Solo Lo Mejor: 20 Exitos (2001), 30 Exitos Insuperables (2003), 15 de Coleccion (2004), Romanticos Por Siempre (2005), and Lo Esencial De Alvaro Torres (2006). During an interview with La Prensa, Torres said, \\"I invited her to sing with me when she was not well-known, and I wrote the song \\"Bueno amigos\\"; that song brings back memories. People will never forget Selena and that tune is one of my favorites.\\"  Composition  \\"Buenos Amigos\\" is a Spanish-language, down-tempo pop ballad. It makes use of orchestra instruments including strings, flute, French horn, percussion, a brass section, and bass drum performed in a rhythmical beat. Torres sings the first verse, telling his friend she is an unreachable dream and that he loves her. His friend Selena replies, telling him how she does not feel the same way. During the bridge, both narrators say that if they shared the same feelings their love would be an ecstasy, but because their feelings are different they believe being friends is better than losing each other. Torres sings the second verse, telling Selena that he will wait for her, reasoning that he likes having an illusion and believing that she loves him. He then tells her he does not care how long he has to wait. Selena replies, telling him how beautiful his responses are, which makes her feel she is falling in love. Selena states that she stops herself from making a mistake that could hurt her. Torres and Selena repeat the song's chorus before the song concludes.  Critical response  \\"Buenos Amigos\\" received a positive response from music critics. In his book Latin Sensations, Her√≥n M√°rquez said the commercial success of \\"Buenos Amigos\\" helped Selena become a household name among Latinos in the United States. Angie Chabram-Dernersesian said \\"Buenos Amigos\\" was a \\"hit single\\", while writing about Selena's collaborations in her book The Chicana/o Cultural Studies Reader. Suzanne Michele Bourgoin said the track was a \\"breakthrough hit\\" for Selena, in her book Encyclopedia of World Biography: Supplement A Z. Lorena Flores of The Dallas Morning News called \\"Buenos Amigos\\" a \\"classic\\". An editor from El Diario de Hoy said \\"Buenos Amigos\\" is a \\"romantic track\\". An editor from Onet.pl named \\"Buenos Amigos\\" as one of Selena's biggest hits. Billboard magazine called it a \\"pop ballad\\" and said it became her first big hit single. Joe Nick Patoski called the recording \\"a pretty if somewhat insipid ballad\\" in his book about Selena's life. It was recognized as one of the best-performing songs of the year at the 1994 BMI Latin Awards.  Music video and legacy  Dominican singer Ana√≠s recorded the song with Tairon in 2005. The music video for \\"Buenos Amigos\\" was filmed in San Antonio, Texas in August 1991. It features both artists, who are shown walking around, singing the song with an orchestra playing in the background. \\"Buenos Amigos\\" was Selena's first music video. It was included on the DVD set of Selena's 2005 compilation album Unforgettable. Deborah Par√©dez said the music video was \\"sophisticated\\". The music video for \\"Buenos Amigos\\" earned Selena and Torres two nominations at the 1992 Billboard Music Video Awards. The track was nominated for \\"Duo of the Year\\" at the 1992 Tejano Music Awards. Par√©dez said the track enabled Selena to tour the west and east coasts of the United States. John Lannert of Billboard magazine said \\"Buenos Amigos\\" began Selena's career as a dominating Latin chart artist. According to John Lannert, the song was helped by increased airplay on regional Mexican and Tejano radio stations, which had previously dismissed Selena's recordings. Mariana Seoane and Pablo Montero performed \\"Buenos Amigos\\" as part of the Selena ¬°VIVE! tribute concert in 2005. Tairon recorded the song with Dominican singer Ana√≠s for the compilation album Con Un Sue√±a...Objetivo Fama (2005). Mexican singer Lucero Terrazas, recorded the track for her album Cada Vez Que Me Ves (2007).  Chart performance  \\"Buenos Amigos\\" debuted at number 30 on the US Billboard Hot Latin Songs (formerly Hot Latin Tracks) on the issue dated April 11, 1992. It entered the top 10 three weeks later. It peaked at number one nine weeks later on the issue dated June 6, 1992, replacing \\"No S√© T√∫\\" by Luis Miguel and was succeeded by Jos√© Luis Rodr√≠guez and Julio Iglesias's song \\"Torero\\" a week later. \\"Buenos Amigos\\" remained at number two for three consecutive weeks. This gave Torres his second number one single after \\"Nada Se Compara Contigo\\" which peaked at number one the same year. \\"Buenos Amigos\\" gave Selena her first number-one song in their career. \\"Buenos Amigos\\" remained on the charts for 17 consecutive weeks, exiting on the issue dated August 1, 1992. \\"Buenos Amigos\\" received more airplay when it fell to number two than it did when it was at number one. According to Billboard magazine, this was not enough for the recording to remain at number one.

Pages: 362-363 Prelude During World War II Pidkamin, (), was a shelter for Poles from the neighbouring province of Volhynia, who had escaped the Massacres of Poles in Volhynia and sought refuge in the local Dominican monastery. The complex was surrounded by walls and was located on a hill that dominated the surrounding area and as a result provided a relatively safe haven for refugees. Around 2,000 people were living at Podkamin town and the monastery when it was attacked in March 1944, by the UIA in cooperation with 14th SS Division. The massacre On the first day of the attack it was repelled by a small self-defence group, and that night some of the inhabitants managed to escape. The next day the UIA promised to spare the inhabitants lives in exchange for the surrender of the monastery. While the monastery was being evacuated the UIA opened fire and entered the monastery complex, and massacred a number of people, including the clergy. The bodies of the dead were then thrown into the well. Afterwards the UIA camped in the nearby town of Pidkamin, and between the 12‚Äì16 March repeatedly attacked people hiding in the villages. On 16 March, as the Soviet Red Army approached, the UIA withdrew from the area. Aftermath Approximately 100 ethnic Poles were murdered in the monastery, and additional 500 were killed in the town of Pidkamen itself. In the nearby village of Palikrowy, 365 Poles were killed. Armed Ukrainian groups destroyed the monastery, stealing all the valuables, except for the monastery's crowned icon. Tadeusz Piotrowski who based his findings on the Home Army or German Police sources, estimates that the number of victims in the monastery and adjacent villages numbered 1000. Among the survivors was the renowned writer and painter, Leopold Buczkowski.

The suspected mechanism is firstly the deposition of a graphite layer on the surface of the metal, usually from carbon monoxide (CO) in the vapour phase. This graphite layer is then thought to form metastable M3C species (where M is the metal), which migrate away from the metal surface. However, in some regimes no M3C species are observed indicating a direct transfer of metal atoms into the graphite layer.On the Mechanism of Metal Dusting Corrosion (no date) C.M. Chun, J.D. Mumford and T.A. Ramanarayanan The temperatures normally associated with metal dusting are high (300‚Äì850 ¬∞C). From a general understanding of chemistry, it can be deduced that at lower temperatures, the rate of reaction to form the metastable M3C species is too low to be significant, and at much higher temperatures the graphite layer is unstable and so CO deposition does not occur (at least to any appreciable degree). Very briefly, there are several proposed methods for prevention or reduction of metal dusting; the most common seem to be aluminide coatings, alloying with copper and addition of steam. There is a significant amount of literature in existence that describes proposed mechanisms, prevention methods etc. There is also a good summary of metal dusting and some prevention methods in 'Corrosion by Carbon and Nitrogen - Metal Dusting, Carburisation and Nitridation' Corrosion by Carbon and Nitrogen - Metal Dusting, Carburisation and Nitridation; Grabke, H.J., Sch√ºtze, M.; Woodhead Publishing 2007  References  Category:Corrosion ","title":"Metal dusting"},{"id":"24179981","text":"Bruce Katz (born June 21, 1959, Brooklyn, New York, United States) graduated with a B.A. from Brown University in 1981.

In the next round it lost against Heracles Almelo, 3‚Äì0. In the 2011‚Äì12 national cup it beat Quick '20 6‚Äì2. In the next round it lost against MVV Maastricht, 8‚Äì0. In 2010 the club was a serious candidate for Topklasse even though it had finished the season only in the position in the Hoofdklasse. The opportunity was there because the Topklasse was founded that year and would fill with Hoofdklasse teams, among others. Still the decisive game against Be Quick 1887 finished in 1‚Äì1 also after extra time. ARC finally made it in through penalties. Subsequently, ARC played two years in the Topklasse. It was never a natural fit. Its best achievement was an 11th position in 2011. In 2012 it ended 16th out of 16 and relegated.

He was the last to bear the now-defunct Sicilian title of Duke of Verdura, and his cousin was a prominent Sicilian prince, Giuseppe Tomasi di Lampedusa, author of the famous novel The Leopard. A biography of Fulco di Verdura was published by Thames & Hudson, authored by Patricia Corbett.Corbett, Patricia, Verdura: The Life and Works of a Master Jeweler, Thames & Hudson, 2002. Beginnings Born in 1898 in Palermo, Italy, Fulco di Verdura grew up in aristocratic surroundings largely unchanged since the 1700s.Corbett, Patricia. Verdura: The Life and Works of a Master Jeweler. Thames & Hudson, 2002. , p. 14. During his early years, he developed a vivid imagination, wild sense of humor, and a love for animals that would later influence his jewelry designs. Fulco gained the title of duke when, in August 1923, his father died.Corbett, Patricia. Verdura: The Life and Works of a Master Jeweler. Thames & Hudson, 2002. , p. 38. Free to go where he pleased but limited financially, he would have to find a profession that fit his stature and provided income to match his lifestyle.Corbett, Patricia. Verdura: The Life and Works of a Master Jeweler. Thames & Hudson, 2002. , p. 43. The Chanel years A meeting in 1919 put Fulco on the path to discover what would be his life's work. That year, he met Linda and Cole Porter ‚Äì two of his biggest supporters and early backers ‚Äì in Palermo. Six years later, during a party hosted by the Porters in Venice, Linda introduced Fulco to Gabrielle ‚ÄúCoco‚Äù Chanel, who would go on to hire Fulco as a textile designer in 1927.

Not long after Fulco started working for Chanel, he created her now iconic Maltese Cross Cuffs, setting a gold cross adorned with bright cabochons in white enamel.Corbett, Patricia. Verdura: The Life and Works of a Master Jeweler. Thames & Hudson, 2002. , p. 85. A year later, Chanel boutiques sold a piece of costume jewelry modeled after the cuffs Fulco created. The cuffs are considered the hallmark of the Verdura brand and they have been copied many times over the years.Conly, Sarah. ‚ÄúVerdura Cuffs.‚Äù Harper‚Äôs Bazaar, October 2009. The Flato years Fulco left Chanel in 1934 to venture to the United States with Baron Nicolas de Gunzburg and Princess Natalia Pavlovna Paley.Corbett, Patricia. Verdura: The Life and Works of a Master Jeweler. Thames & Hudson, 2002. , p. 82. He traveled first to Hollywood and then to New York where Diana Vreeland, a Chanel client, introduced Fulco to the jeweler Paul Flato. Fulco joined Flato's design team full-time when Flato opened a boutique in Hollywood. ‚ÄúVerdura for Flato‚Äù became a signature admired by both socialites on the East Coast and silver screen royalty out west. Verdura LLC Fulco broke out on his own in 1939, opening a small salon called Verdura in New York at 712 Fifth Avenue with the financial backing of Cole Porter and Vincent Astor. His primary inspiration came from his childhood in Sicily.Borgonovo, Carmen. ‚ÄúRock Garden.‚Äù W Magazine, March 1, 2001. His love of art began when he learned about the Renaissance in an illustrated book on Raphael.Scarisbrick, Diana. ‚ÄúWit on the Grand Scale.‚Äù Country Life Magazine. June 7, 1990. In the designs he made for Verdura, he continuously incorporated themes of nature, creating brooches that looked like leaves made of colored zircons, a pomegranate made of ruby seeds, a gold corncob made with black pearl kernels, and an artichoke made of emerald petals. In 1941, Fulco collaborated with Salvador Dal√≠ on a collection of jewelry designs. Also that year, he designed ‚ÄúNight and Day‚Äù cufflinks for Cole Porter that were inspired by the lyrics of the hit song and have since become signature Verdura pieces.

A perfectionist, Fulco would spend his days drafting precise design sketches, specifying materials, size, and color. Joseph Alfano, Fulco's business partner, is responsible for preserving a good portion of Fulco's sketches that now comprise the Verdura archive and otherwise would have been destroyed, rescuing overlooked pages in sketchbooks, scraps left on the floor, and sheets discarded in wastepaper baskets.Corbett, Patricia.

Undaunted by an early invaliding by infantry combat during early World War I, Friedrichs switched to aviation. After serving reconnaissance duty, he moved to being a fighter pilot with Jagdstaffel 10. He shot down 11 enemy observation balloons, making him a top balloon buster; he also shot down 10 enemy airplanes. He was killed in action on 15 July 1918 when his Fokker D.VII burst into flames in midair. Early life and military service Friedrich \\"Fritz\\" Friedrichs was born in Spork, Westphalia, in western Germany, on 21 February 1895. His father was a customs official. Friedrichs attended Hermann-Tast Gymnasium. He received his diploma in 1914. He was interested in a medical career. He volunteered for service in the German Imperial Army's Infantry Regiment No. 85 on 14 August 1914. On 9 October, he went to the front. He served with them until seconded to officer training in Munich. Upon graduation on 23 September 1915, he was commissioned a lieutenant in the reserves and posted to Infantry Regiment No. 32. During its campaign in Serbia, he was hit by shellfire and wounded so seriously that he was declared unfit for further duty because of permanent damage to his left leg.Franks et al 1993, p. 110. Aerial service See also Aerial victory standards of World War I. Friedrichs then transferred to the Luftstreitkr√§fte. He underwent training from 1 October 1916 through 20 February 1917. He undertook aviation training at Cologne and Paderborn before learning artillery observation at J√ºterbog. On 9 June, having trained as both observer and pilot, he was posted to FA(A) 264, an artillery observation squadron. While serving with them, he won both classes of the Iron Cross.On 4 January 1918, he began a week's Jastashule. Upon completion, he moved up to Royal Prussian Jasta 10, a part of Jagdgeschwader 1, to fly a Pfalz D.III. His first claim, on 18 March 1918, went unconfirmed. Three days later, he became a balloon buster, blasting one of the floating observation posts at Ruyalcourt, France, in the vicinity of the Somme. He scored once more in March, downing a SE.5a on the 27th. Friedrichs had no successes in April. He shot down a D.H.9 on 3 May, and a Sopwith Camel on the 15th. Three days later, he began a string of six consecutive victories over observation balloons that ended on 8 June 1918. This brought his count to ten. He ran off nine more triumphs that month, including four more balloons. He had one confirmed win, over a Nieuport 28 on 2 July, and an unconfirmed claim on 8 July. Killed in action On 15 July, an unexpected hazard caught up with Friedrichs. His aircraft caught fire in midair. It seems most probable that the incendiary bullets loaded on his airplane spontaneously ignited and set his Fokker D.VII on fire. Friedrichs parachuted out of the conflagration, but the parachute's harness and lines entangled in the plane's tail and Friedrichs fell to his death. Friedrich Friedrichs had already been awarded the Knight's Cross with Swords of the Hohenzollern House Order. He had also been recommended for the Pour le Merite. Reportedly, it was awarded on 20 July, five days after his death.The Aerodrome website's relevant page on Pour le Merite awards http://www.theaerodrome.com/medals/germany/prussia_opm.php?pageNum_recipients=2&totalRows;_recipients=63#recipients Retrieved 2 February 2013.

Luxton (1876-1962) was a pioneer in the Canadian Rockies known as \\"Mr. Banff\\". With John Voss, he attempted to sail around the world in an old red cedar Indian dug-out canoe. On his return to Canada, he worked on improving the community of Banff and the relationship between its residents and the aboriginal community. Personal life Norman Luxton was the son of Winnipeg Free Press co-founder, William Luxton. After working with his father at the Free Press in Manitoba and for the Indian Agency at Rat Portage (now, Kenora, Ontario) in 1892. In 1893, Norman decided to head to the Cariboo Gold Fields to make his fortune. It is hard to know if he did make it to the gold fields, but he did make it to Calgary and worked for the Calgary Herald for the next eight years before moving to Vancouver in 1901. In 1904, Norman Luxton married Georgina (Georgie) Elizabeth McDougall (1870-1965) of the pioneer missionary McDougall family of Morley, Alberta. Norman and Georgie Luxton had one child, Eleanor Georgina, born in Banff in 1908. Norman F. Luxton died on October 22, 1962 at the age of 89, in the Holy Cross Hospital in Calgary. Pacific crossing Tilikum at Margate with Captain John Voss standing at the bows. In 1901, Norman moved west to Vancouver where he briefly worked for a weekly called Town Topics. While in Victoria, Norman met Captain John Voss, an eccentric sea captain. The two planned a most adventurous voyage. They would purchase a 100-year-old Nootka dugout canoe and sail it around the world, leaving from Victoria, British Columbia and heading west to London. The dugout canoe was named the Tilikum, meaning friend in Chinook Jargon. Luxton journeyed 10,000 miles (about 16,000 km) on the Pacific Ocean with Voss, and endured five months of travel, before the Tilikum struck a reef and Luxton was thrown from the boat. His whole body was badly cut by coral, and he had to abandon the trip in Fiji, and was immediately taken to a hospital in Australia. Following this, Luxton came to Banff to recuperate. He kept notes of the voyage; his Tilikum Journal, edited by his daughter Eleanor was published in 1971. Captain John Voss finished his journey around the world and published his sailing memoir as The Venturesome Voyages of Captain Voss in 1913. The Tilikum boat changed hands a number of times but is now on display under cover in the cruise ships terminal in Victoria, British Columbia. A map of the voyage of the Tilikum. Luxton made it as far as Suva, Fiji before having to stop from his injuries. Life in Banff Norman Luxton at the Banff Indian Days festival, 1927 Luxton was a prominent person in Banff, Alberta after his return from his sailing trip across the Pacific. He published the Crag and Canyon newspaper, built the King Edward Hotel and the Lux Theatre in Banff, and founded the Sign of the Goat Curio Shop, which led to the development of the Luxton Museum of Plains Indians, now the Buffalo Nations Museum. He was one of the organizers of Banff Indian Days and the Banff Winter Carnival. Norman was also made an honorary chief of the Stoney tribe and given the name Chief White Shield. In 1953, Luxton established a museum to house his native artifacts. The Luxton Museum of the Plains Indian which is known as the Buffalo Nations Luxton Museum was built in co-operation with Eric Harvie of the Glenbow Foundation of Calgary. On the death of his only daughter Eleanor Luxton in 1995, ownership of the home, built circa 1905 in Banff, passed to the Eleanor Luxton Historical Foundation. The objective of the Eleanor Luxton Historical Foundation is to foster public awareness of the history of Banff and its environs during the century that the Luxton were influential in the community with emphasis on the careers of Norman K. Luxton, Georgina McDougall Luxton, and Eleanor G. Luxton. The historic Luxton home build circa 1905 in Banff have been preserved, restored and are open to the public through Whyte Museum guided tours. The interior of the home has been preserved and represents the lives of the three family members and the evolution of a Banff lifestyle over a period of nine decades. Of special interest are the collections of Stoney artifacts, evening gowns dating back to the turn of the century, household collectibles, and taxidermy specimens. The importance of gardening to the family is evident in the extensive collection of garden- related artifacts preserved in the home. These include tools, catalogues, and seed packets dating back to 1913. The garden is open to public and it is supposed to be one of the first flower gardens in Banff, still blooming every year.

During warfare, players unite with their countrymen to battle it out against the other nation. Two types of warfare exist. In standard warfares, their team earns points when an enemy dies, an enemy symbol is destroyed, or an enemy catapult is destroyed. In territorial warfare, both nations go against each other in an attempt to destroy the other nations chieftain to control certain areas for added bonuses like cheaper prices for supplies and higher sell rates to npc's. The Warfare Map is relatively simple: One base per nation, separated by a large canyon/gorge. Whenever symbols are destroyed the name of the person who made the last hit on the symbol is announced. The two different warfares have level limits, the first warfare is for 70‚Äì119 and the second warfare is for levels 121 and above. Guilds Players can form guilds or clans which allow for more social interaction, other people to quest with and the addition of a cape and guild tag. They can also engage in guild wars, involving two guilds fighting each other. When a guild war is declared, the names of the guilds involved are announced.

Films of the Soviet period were shot either in Russian or Uzbek. The most critically acclaimed films of the Soviet period include films such as Maftuningman (1958), Mahallada duv-duv gap (1960), and Shum bola (1977).Clo√© Drieu, Cinema, Nation, and Empire in Uzbekistan, 1919-1937, Bloomington and Indianapolis: Indiana University Press, 2019. A Cinematographic Department was created in 1920 in what was then the Turkestan Autonomous Soviet Socialist Republic, and in 1924 the first film studios were created in Bukhara as a cooperative enterprise between the Sevzapkino studio in Russia and the Commissariat of Enlightenment of the Bukharan People's Soviet Republic. Bukhkino, as a Russo-Bukharan cinematographic society, was also founded in 1924 and produced the Ô¨Årst feature Ô¨Ålm in present-day Uzbekistan, The Minaret of Death by Viacheslav Viskovskii (1925), an exotic- themed film that was successful throughout the Soviet Union and was even exported abroad. Later, Bukhkino merged into Uzbekgoskino (Uzbekfilm), which originally produced mostly Soviet anti-religious propaganda targeting Islam during the USSR anti-religious campaign (1928‚Äì1941).Clo√© Drieu, \\"Cinema, Local Power and the Central State: Agencies in Early Anti-Religious Propaganda in Uzbekistan,\\" Die Welt des Islams 50 (2010), 532-563. Two prominent directors in the Soviet era were Nabi Ganiev (1904‚Äì1952) and Suleiman Khodjaev (1892‚Äì1937). While Ganiev, the first Uzbek director whose movies starred a majority of Uzbek actors (in previous films, most actors were Russian), engaged in Stalinist propaganda through his movies, and survived the purges, Khodjaev became a victim of Stalin's repression. His movie Before Dawn (1933) was ostensibly a criticism of Tsarist Russia, but depicting it as a colonial power and the Uzbeks who opposed it as anti-colonial freedom fighters made the authorities suspicious that Khodjaev was alluding to the Soviet Union. In 1937, The Oath by Aleksandr Ulos‚Äôstev-Garf was the first talking film produced in Uzebekistan. It also marked the end of an era as, during the Great Purge, very few new films were produced.Drieu (2019). There are many film studios in Uzbekistan. Uzbekfilm (), established in 1925, is the largest and oldest film studio in Uzbekistan. Very few Uzbek movies that were made after Uzbekistan became independent have achieved international notability. According to movie critics, most of the modern Uzbek movies are cheap, low-quality movies. Currently there are dozens of Uzbek film studies that on average make 50 films a year. Film critics state that while the quantity of Uzbek films is going up, one cannot say the same about the quality of these films. Some have dubbed this trend the \\"Bollywoodization\\" of Uzbek cinema.

(Vauxhall chassis code \\"B\\" type) is a large six cylinder car manufactured by Vauxhall from 1910 to 1914. The 27 h.p. was Vauxhall's first six-cylinder car. History In 1904 Napier had introduced a six-cylinder-engined car onto the British market, a lead followed a year later by Rolls-Royce. Vauxhall decided to join this club and designer F.W. Hodges made an experimental six in 1905 with cylinders cast in two sets of three and chain drive but it never saw production. The car that would go into production as the B-type 27 hp had a completely new engine of 3473 cc with all six cylinders cast in one block in the prototype but production versions had reverted to two three-cylinder units and with capacity increased to 4525 cc. Engineering The chassis was similar to that used on the A-type and used semi elliptic leaf springs and rigid axles front and rear and was available in a choice of two wheelbases of or . The side-valve engine had a bore of 90 mm and stroke of 120 mm and produced an output of 30 bhp. On later cars the capacity increased to 5013 cc. Drive was to the rear wheels via a multi-plate clutch and four-speed transmission separated from the engine by a short shaft. The engine, clutch and transmission were mounted on a sub frame within the main chassis. There were no brakes on the front wheels but the car had a transmission brake immediately behind the gearbox operated by the foot pedal. About 75 were made. Body styles fitted are believed to have included a two-seat tourer, landaulette, cabriolet and limousine. After production ceased in 1914 or possibly 1915, subsequent six-cylinder Vauxhalls were the short-lived sleeve- valve 25-70 (\\"S\\" type chassis) and the 20-60 (\\"R\\" type chassis) which though introduced in September 1927 after the company was bought by General Motors was a Vauxhall design approved before the end of 1925 and was left in production (later sold as the Vauxhall Eighty) until the first GM big six in 1932, the 20h.p.

He is a professor and former Head of the Department of Cell Biology at the Erasmus MC, Rotterdam. Biography He obtained his PhD degree from McGill University, Montreal and after completing two postdoctoral periods with Charles Weissmann (Zurich) and Richard Flavell (Amsterdam and London) he started his own research group at the National Institute for Medical Research, Mill Hill. Grosveld has been conducting research on the regulation of gene expression over thirty years. In his post-doctoral research he constructed the first reliable method for cloning human DNA cosmids - at the time an extremely difficult but rewarding accomplishment that has since been adopted by many other laboratories. By using the globin gene cluster he made the ground- breaking discovery of a locus control region located upstream of the gene itself and governing overall control of globin gene expression. After this first report, locus control regions have now been identified for many genes and have permitted for example the ectopic expression of genes in transgenic mice. In further studies he identified chromatin loops and the hubs that hold the loops together. His more recent excursions into erythroid differentiation have made the key identification of the transcription factor GATA1, a major and unique advance into understanding erythroid cell development. Along with major research advances he has also developed new technologies, such as 4C technology (a modification of the 3C technology invented previously by others) that makes possible examination of chromatin conformation on a chip and constructed a number of spin off companies. He has mentored a large number of PhDs and postdocs, many of whom have gone on to academic positions all over the world and are now eminent scientists leading groups of their own. Grosveld's research on the control of globin gene expression has been selected as one of the top ten achievements of Medical Research Council (UK) (MRC) in the 20th century by Higher Education and Research Opportunities in the UK.

Mr. Leonard Cohen is a 1965 Direct Cinema documentary film about Leonard Cohen, co-directed by Don Owen and Donald Brittain, and written by Brittain. Produced by John Kemeny for the National Film Board of Canada, the film received the Canadian Film Award in the TV Information category at the 18th Canadian Film Awards. The documentary captures Cohen's career as a noted poet and novelist before he launched his career as a singer- songwriter in 1967. The original idea for the film had involved documenting a tour of Canadian poets, including Irving Layton and Earle Birney; however, that idea was abandoned when the filmmakers decided the other poets would not serve as charismatic film subjects.  Contents  Shot and edited in the Direct Cinema style, the filmmakers follow Cohen through his hometown of Montreal, Quebec, as he moves from poetry readings at McGill University, Cohen's alma mater, to a television appearance with his friend and fellow poet Irving Layton and host Pierre Burton, to his childhood home sitting with his mother, to his \\"three-dollar-a-night hotel room\\" in a shady part of the city. The audio is a mix of traditional voice-over, interviews with Cohen, along with Cohen's own poetry. The poems read are mostly taken from The Spice-Box of Earth and Flowers for Hitler, including: * I have not lingered in European monasteries * Prayer for Messiah * A kite is a victim * Disguises * Beneath my hands * Here was the market * Twelve o'clock chant * As the mist leaves no scar * The genius * On hearing a name long unspoken * Three good nights * Alexander Trocchi, public junkie, priez pour nous * Hydra 1963 * The only tourist in Havana turns his thoughts homeward * The music crept by us  Themes  The central themes of the documentary include fame, authorship, image, irony and artifice. Cohen himself comments multiple times on the artificial nature of documentary filmmaking and storytelling. Throughout the film Cohen is aware that he is on camera, and actively shaping his own image, along with the filmmakers. Cohen is in fact a collaborator in this artificial process to the extent that the film ends with a sort of postscript, where Cohen has been invited to watch the film in a screening room alongside Don Owen. Cohen remarks on the fraud of the camera crew showing him pretend to sleep. Cohen then discusses how strange it is that he let them film him in the bathtub. In the footage they watch, a naked Cohen writes \\"CAVEAT EMPTOR,\\" latin for \\"buyer beware\\" on the wall next to the bathtub. Cohen says \\"I had to act as a double agent... let the [audience] know that this is not entirely devoid of the con.\\" Earlier, following his TV appearance with Pierre Burton, Owen asks Cohen what Burton wanted from him and Cohen replied \\"He wanted me to cut my con out... What's the true story? Is wrestling really fixed?\\" Unlike contemporaneous Direct Cinema documentaries on similar subjects, most notably Lonely Boy, by Roman Kroitor and Wolf Koenig, Cohen is given licence to comment on the proceedings, as and even after they happen. Where in Lonely Boy Paul Anka is only the subject, and often the dupe, of Koenig and Kroitor's investigation of fame and artifice, in Ladies and Gentleman..., Cohen is in on the con as a collaborator and co-conspirator. To this end, Cohen is allowed to manufacture irony, along with the directors throughout the film, including as he watches himself fumble with horizontal blinds in his hotel room and comments ironically, \\"I was always good with my hands.\\" References External links *Watch Ladies and Gentlemen...

(see External links below). To speakers of English, Exbucklandia is generally known as the Pipli tree, from the Bengali name for the species Exbucklandia populnea.  Cultivation  Propagation is usually by seed, but cuttings have been successful under favorable conditions. Plantations of the young trees must be fenced against cattle and deer which eat whatever leaves they can reach. If Exbucklandia is grown in the open, the trunk forks and branches are retained close to the ground. In the forest, where it usually grows, the trunk is single, straight, and free of branches for 9 to 18 metres. Saplings grow slowly for the first few years, then more quickly later on.  Species  Only three species names have ever been published in Exbucklandia. These are Exbucklandia populnea, Exbucklandia tonkinensis, and Exbucklandia longipetala.The International Plant Names Index. \\"Exbucklandia\\". (see External links below). The specific epithets refer to poplars, Tonkin, and long petals. Exbucklandia populnea is found throughout the entire range of the genus. Exbucklandia tonkinensis is native to southeastern China, Laos, and northern Vietnam. Exbucklandia longipetala has a much more restricted range, being known only from the Guangxi and Guizhou provinces of China.Zhang Zhiyun, Zhang Hongda (Chang Hung-ta), and Peter K.

Further field work will be needed to determine whether these are three distinct entities and whether the specimens assigned to Exbucklandia populnea represent a single species or two. Consequently, estimates of the number of species range from two David J. Mabberley. 2008. Mabberley's Plant-Book. Cambridge University Press: UK. to four.  Description  The following description of Exbucklandia applies only to extant species and does not necessarily hold for species known only from the fossil record. It is adapted from the description in Flora of China volume 9, with the exceptions noted. Exbucklandias are evergreen trees. Exbucklandia populnea and Exbucklandia tonkinensis are usually 16 to 20 meters in height, occasionally reaching 30 meters. The largest known individual of Exbucklandia populnea grew to 45 meters in the Darjeeling Hills of India. The usual height of Exbucklandia longipetala is not known. The twigs have conspicuous nodes. The leaves are attractively reddish when immature. They are arranged alternately on the stems, an arrangement unusual for Hamamelidaceae. The petioles are long and the leaves flutter in even a light breeze, like the leaves of poplars. The poplar petiole is flattened, and in cross section, it is long in the vertical direction. Whether Exbucklandia has the same sort of petiole has not been recorded. The leaf blade is simple, and sometimes has three pointed lobes, or rarely, five. It is thickly leathery and its margin is entire. The venation is palmate, with the secondary veins radiating from the apex of the petiole. The stipules are large and coherent; soon falling away. Each inflorescence has 7 to 16 flowers and is located in the axil of a leaf. The flowers are small and bisexual. Sepals are completely lacking. Petals are often absent, but are small and white when present. Some authors have interpreted what appear to be petals as petaloid staminodes. The stamens are 10 to 15 in number. The anthers are basifixed, as in all of Hamamelidaceae. Each theca has one sporangium, whereas for most angiosperms, there are two. The thecae open by one valve. The ovary is half-inferior and, as in the rest of the family, consists of two carpels. The number of ovules in each carpel has been reported as five or six and as six to eight. What some authors have loosely called styles are actually styluli. These are separate by definition, channeling the pollen tubes that invade them into only one carpel. Each stigma is somewhat decurrent down one side of its stylulus. The fruit is a 4-valved capsule. The two locules separate, and each splits into two valves. Each locule contains five to seven seeds. The upper four or five are sterile and wingless. The lowest one or two are fertile and narrowly winged. The seeds are light and can travel far in a strong wind.  Affinities  The phylogeny of Hamamelidaceae has not been resolved with much certainty, but in one recent molecular phylogenetic study, Exbucklandia and Rhodoleia formed the most basal clade in the family.Susana Magall√≥n. 2007. \\"From Fossils to Molecules: Phylogeny and the Core Eudicot Floral Groundplan in Hamamelidoideae (Hamamelidaceae, Saxifragales)\\". Systematic Botany 32(2):317-347. Chunia bucklandioides, a rare tree from Hainan which has never been sampled for DNA, might also be a member of this clade. Vegetatively, it is hard to distinguish from Exbucklandia, while florally, it is intermediate between Exbucklandia and Mytilaria.Hung-Ta Chang (Hongda Zhang). 1948. \\"Chunia\\". page 63. In: \\"Additions to the Hamamelidaceous flora of China\\". Sunyatsenia (1-2):63-74. The morphology of Chunia indicates that if it is not in the clade with Exbucklandia and Rhodoleia, then it either forms its own clade or it is sister to Mytilaria.  Evolution  Exbucklandia was once more widely distributed than it is today. Four species are known only from fossils. Exbucklandia oregonensis grew in the northwestern United States during the Oligocene and Miocene epochs.Herb Meyer. 1973. \\"The Oligocene Lyons Flora of northwestern Oregon\\". The Ore Bin 35(3):37-51. (see External links below).Kathleen B. Pigg and Wesley C. Wehr. 2002. \\"Tertiary Flowers, Fruits, and Seeds of Washington State and Adjacent Areas - Part III\\". Washington Geology 30(3-4):3-20. (see External links below). Exbucklandia microdictya is known from Paleocene deposits near Altay City in Xinjiang Province, China. Exbucklandia miocenica is a Miocene species from Yunnan Province, China. Exbucklandia tengchongensis is known from fossils recovered from a diatomite mine in Tengchong County in Yunnan, China. It dates from the Pliocene epoch.  History  In 1825, the name Bucklandia was published for a fossil cycad in the \\"Tentamen\\" part of Flora der Vorwelt, the classic paleobotanical work by Kaspar Maria von Sternberg. The name has been attributed to Carl Borivoj Presl as well as to Sternberg.Roland W. Brown. 1946. page 348. In: \\"Alterations in some fossil and living floras\\". Journal of the Washington Academy of Sciences. 36(10):344-355. In 1836, Robert Brown, unaware that the name had already been taken, published the name Bucklandia populnea for the tree now known as Exbucklandia populnea Robert Brown. 1836. Asiatic Researches 19(1):95. to honor the Reverend William Buckland, an English geologist and paleontologist.Umberto Quattrocchi. 2000. CRC World Dictionary of Plant Names volume II. CRC Press: Boca Raton; New York; Washington,DC;, USA. London, UK. (vol. II). (see External links below). In the case of Bucklandia, Brown did not meet the requirements of valid publication, but the name was validated by William Griffith, posthumously, in 1847.William Griffith. 1847. Journals of Travels in Assam Burma Bootan Affghanistan and the Neighbouring Countries (sic). Bishop's College Press: Calcutta. (reprinted 2001. Munshiram Manoharlal Publishers, New Delhi). In 1924, Paul Henri Lecomte named a second species, Bucklandia tonkinensis.Paul Henri Lecomte. 1924. Bulletin du Mus√©um d'Histoire Naturelle. Paris. 30:392. For more than 100 years, it remained unnoticed that two genera of plants had received the name Bucklandia. This conflict was finally resolved by Roland W. Brown in 1946. At that time, Brown wrote, \\"Inasmuch as the 1825 cycadeoid name has priority, the witchhazel genus requires a new name. For this purpose, I propose Exbucklandia, the derivation of which is obvious.\\" Unaware of Brown's paper, Cornelis G.G.J. van Steenis sought to resolve the conflict of names in 1952 by replacing Bucklandia with Symingtonia.Cornelis G.G.J. van Steenis. 1952. Acta Botanica Neerlandica 1:443-444. He published a notice of this oversight in 1954, acknowledging the priority of Exbucklandia over Symingtonia.Cornelis G.G.J. van Steenis. 1954. page 595. In: \\"Miscellaneous Botanical Notes VI\\". Blumea 7(3):595-598. In that paper, van Steenis transferred the second species to Exbucklandia, because Roland Brown had not explicitly done so in 1946. Thus van Steenis originated the combination Exbucklandia tonkinensis, but not validly, because he failed to cite the publication of the basionym as the ICBN has required since 1953. In 1959, Hung-Ta Chang validly made the combination Exbucklandia tonkinensis.Hung-Ta Chang. 1959. Acta Scientiarum Naturalium Universitatis Sunyatseni. 1959(2). In that same paper, Chang described and named the third species, Exbucklandia longipetala. A taxonomic history and a description of each of the three species can be found in Flora of China volume 9.

He founded Wider√∏e's Flyveselskap, Norway's third largest airline, in 1934. The airline is still in operation today. Personal life Viggo Wider√∏e was born in Kristiania as a son of the mercantile agent Theodor Wider√∏e (1868‚Äì1947) and Carla Johanne Launer (1875‚Äì1971). He was a brother of the engineer and accelerator physicist Rolf Wider√∏e, and grew up at Vinderen. In 1935 he married Solveig Agnes Schr√∏der (1914‚Äì1989); they had the daughter Turi Wider√∏e. Through her, Viggo Wider√∏e was the father-in-law of Karl Erik Harr between 1972 and 1975. Career Reportedly, Viggo Wider√∏e decided to become an aviator already in 1910. This was one year after the start of aviation in Kristiania. In 1924, Wider√∏e joined the Royal Norwegian Navy Air Service and received a pilot's licence the following year. He became a conscript pilot for the RNNAS until 1 January 1928, when he was appointed officer. Wider√∏e took his civilian pilot's licence on 13 June 1930 with Norske Luftruter and worked for the company until the end of summer of 1930. Two years later, Viggo Wider√∏e bought John Strandrud's shares in Rundflyvning, that was based in Drammen, and started as a pilot. In 1933, Viggo Wider√∏e established the company Wider√∏e & Bj√∏rneby along with Halvor Bj√∏rneby and bought a Simmonds Spartan. In all these companies, activity was concentrated at aerial photography, advertisement flying, air shows, demonstrations and charter passenger flights. Wider√∏e lay much emphasis on increasing the public interest in aviation throughout South Norway, and arranged flight shows in 1933 and 1934 together with Norsk Aero Klubb. On 19 January 1934, Viggo Wider√∏e founded the company Wider√∏e's Flyveselskap along with his brother Arild Wider√∏e and Einar Isdahl. They raised and Viggo went to the United States where he bought a Waco Cabin that he flew home himself. Postal services started on the 18. June on the route Oslo ‚Äì Kristiansand ‚Äì Stavanger ‚Äì Haugesund, making Viggo the first person to fly a scheduled, domestic flight in Norway. In 1936, all concessions for scheduled flights were transferred to Det Norske Luftfartselskap (DNL), and Wider√∏e had to start again with photography, schools and charter flights. But at the same time, DNL bought 51% of Wide√∏e's Flyveselskap, and they were subcontracted some postal flights. In the winter of 1936-1937, Viggo attended an expedition by Lars Christensen in the Antarctic with the goal to take aerial photography of the continent's coast. About were covered. In 1937, a personal tragedy struck as Arild Wider√∏e and other family members lost their lives in an air accident at the Port of Oslo. Two years later, civil aviation was put on hold due to hardships with supply of fuel. Nonetheless, Wider√∏e provided flight training for exiled Finns during their Winter War of 1939. In 1940, Norway was invaded by Germany as a part of World War II. Viggo joined Milorg, part of the Norwegian resistance. He helped young Norwegian men to flee the country to become war pilots based in foreign countries. Soon, he became suspect in the eyes of German forces. He was arrested for \\"spying\\" in May 1941, and was imprisoned at M√∏llergata 19 for two months. He was sentenced to death, but this was converted to ten year of prison after he held his speech of defence in German. He was transferred to Grini concentration camp in July 1941, as #352 of almost 20,000 prisoners. Another aerial pioneer Helge Skappel was imprisoned as well, and they spent prison time in √Ökebergveien from October to November 1941, before being shipped to Germany via Akershus Fortress. He was imprisoned in Hamburg- F√ºhlsbuttel from 13 January 1942, and later three other camps in Rendsburg, Dreibergen and Dieburg until he was liberated in March 1945. For the rest of the war, he worked as a secretary and interpreter for the American General George Patton. His wife was also involved in Norwegian resistance work. After the war, Wider√∏e was employed as assisting director in the Norwegian Aviation Authority from 1945 to 1946. He then became chief inspector of DNL, and then became one of the first Norwegian employees when Scandinavian Airlines System (SAS) was established, after he had moved to Stockholm in Sweden. In SAS, he mainly worked with headhunting people for the new company. In 1947, DNL sold its stake in Wider√∏e's Flyveselskap to Forenede Industrier. Viggo was headhunted to become managing director, a position he held until 1969. But he continued to also work as a pilot for the company until 1954, when he took last flight. He also flew secret reconnaissance missions in Finnmark for the Norwegian Intelligence Service, as a part of the Cold War, and was in charge of a military aviation school at H√∏nefoss Airport, Eggemoen from 1950 to 1952. He was decorated with the Royal Norwegian Order of St. Olav in 1954, and Mount Wider√∏e in Antarctica was named after him. On the other hand, Viggo never made much money from starting the company. He was in debt until the 1980s, and by the 1990s, he only had shares for NOK 3,000. After retirement, Viggo remained in Oslo during the summer, but spent his winters in L'Alf√†s del Pi in Spain. He died in January 2002 in Oslo.

It is part of Leigh deanery in the archdeaconry of Salford and the diocese of Manchester. The church, together with St Stephen's Church, Astley and St John's Church, Mosley Common is part of the united benefice of Astley, Tyldesley and Mosley Common. A Waterloo Church, it was founded as a chapel of ease of the parish church in Leigh in 1825, in a rapidly expanding township. A mistake with plans led to a larger church than the site could accommodate and extra land and money was donated to ensure the church could be completed. The church was extended at the east end and re-seated in the 1880s and has survived two fires. The churchyard contains the graves of victims of a disaster at Yew Tree Colliery. In 1966 the church was designated a Grade II listed building. History Up to 1789, when the Countess of Huntingdon's Connexion built Tyldesley Top Chapel, the population of Tyldesley was dependent on the parish church in Leigh, an ancient ecclesiastical parish that, from medieval times, covered six townships. As the population grew quickly after 1800, a movement seeking to have an established church in the township developed. Thomas Johnson, owner of the Banks Estate gave land at the western end of the banks on which to build a Commissioners' Church. It was paid for by money from the parliament of the United Kingdom raised by the Church Building Act 1818, and said to be a celebration of Britain's victory in the Battle of Waterloo. ¬£17,000 (equivalent to ¬£ as of ), was promised by the Church Building Commissioners. The architect was Robert Smirke. It was one of 174 neo-Gothic and 40 Classical style churches built under the Act. \\"The site of this churchyard was given in the year 1820 by Thomas Johnson Esq. and enclosed in the year 1825 by George Ormerod Esq.\\" Work began in November 1821 and the foundation stone was laid on 23 April 1822‚ÄîSt George's Day. As construction progressed, it was realised that the structure was too big for the site and that the plans had been inadvertently exchanged for the Church of St George in Chorley. Thomas Johnson's nephew, George Ormerod gave more land for the churchyard and ¬£2,000 (equivalent to ¬£ as of ), so that the church could be finished. Building work was completed in November 1824. Bells for the tower were transported on carts from Leigh on 10 August 1825 arriving to celebrations in the town when the largest bell was upturned and filled with ale supplied by all the local inns. The chapel was consecrated on 19 September 1825 by the Bishop of Chester and dedicated to Saint George. It was licensed as a chapel of ease of Leigh Parish Church and known as St George's Chapel. Tyldesley became a district parish in August 1829. On the last day of 1833 the curate, the Reverend Jacob Robson, writing in the parish registers, signalled the change in the spelling of the township name from Tildesley to Tyldesley. The church was altered and refurbished in 1886 and 1887 when the east end was extended by 12 feet to form a new chancel. At the same time the vestry and entrance porch were added to the north side and the west end of the church was remodelled by architects Preston and Vaughn and the work completed by contractors Cordingley and Stopford. The large west gallery was removed and a smaller one installed. Central doors were hung in an archway below the gallery. The woodwork was by J. Pearson of Pendleton. The nave and aisle roofs were panelled in pitch pine, the wooden floor was replaced and the windows were reglazed. Paint was removed from the interior stonework and the columns were reduced in thickness. The church was relit and a heating system by J. Grundy of Tyldesley was installed. In 1920 a War Memorial Chapel, known as the Lady Chapel was dedicated. St George's has survived two fires, the first in 1878 when the upper west galley housing the choir and organ was destroyed causing their removal to the chancel. The second fire, in 1966, destroyed half the roof and part of the ceiling. In 1886 St John's Church at Mosley Common was built as a chapel-of-ease to St George's. Structure Sandstone for St George's was quarried at Peel Quarry in Little Hulton. The church was built in the Early English Gothic style with a seven-bay nave and clerestory which, according to Pevsner have, \\"unconvincing Geometric aisle windows and squashed Y-tracery on the clerestory\\". The chancel has two-light windows to the south and north walls and a three-light east window, all with geometrical tracery. On the north side is a vestry and a porch in the westernmost bay. The church is in length and in width. The tower at the west end has a west door and rises in three stages to a parapet with crocketed pinnacles and flying buttresses at each corner to a recessed octagonal spire that rises to in height. At its second stage is a lancet window, and at the third stage, three lancet belfry openings and a clock face to each side of the tower. Fittings and furniture St George's north side and spire The tower contains a peel eight bells, the original six were cast in 1825 by William Dobson at Downham Market in Norfolk. In 1910 the bells were rehung and two trebles by Mears and Stainbank added. In the 1960s, subsidence and cracks in the tower prevented the bells being rung but an inspection in 2012 revealed the bells could be rung after repairs to the frame. The Lancashire Association of Change Ringers paid for the repairs and the bells were rung again in December 2012. The town's first public clock, with three faces was installed on the tower in 1847, it was paid for by public subscription. A four-faced clock installed in 1913, wound by hand until 1967, now has an electrical movement. After 1912 the town council was responsible for the cost of repairs and illumination and in 1937 electricity superseded gas for lighting its faces. The church, when first built, could seat 1,100 people. The church retains its west gallery, originally there were two but the upper gallery was destroyed in a fire. The original 1825 font was replaced by a larger one in 1853. In 1860 an organ was bought from Willis of London for ¬£350 replacing a barrel organ given by George Ormerod when the church opened. Most of the church woodwork dates from the extensions and refurbishment in 1887. The chancel woodwork is in American walnut and was carved by Earp of Manchester. The wooden altar is elaborately carved as is the reredos. The pulpit is in carved walnut on a base of Mansfield red stone. A new case was made for the organ at the east end of the south aisle. New pitch pine pews were stained and polished to match the chancel woodwork and replaced the original box pews. The stained glass in the east window was designed by William Pointer of Manchester and dates from 1956. On either side of the window are mosaic panels dated 1914, each of which depicts two evangelists. The stained-glass windows depicting saints in the north and south walls of the chancel date from the 19th century and were moved from Bishopscourt, the former palace of the Bishops of Manchester, in about 1958. Monuments include one dated 1855 showing a \\"grieving woman slumped over an urn\\" and a bronze plaque from 1924. Clergy During its first hundred years, St George's had four incumbents. Jacob Robson came to the church as curate in 1825, becoming vicar in 1842, although Tyldesley was made a parish in 1829. He died in 1851. His successor was George Richards who was vicar from 1851 to 1884, during which time 14 of the 25 victims of the Yew Tree Colliery firedamp explosion in 1858 were buried in the churchyard. John Lund was the next incumbent. He oversaw the extension of the east end of the church in 1886 and the building of the vicarage in 1902. He was vicar for 36 years until 1920 when he was replaced by Samuel Fleming who was vicar until 1948.

Operations and tactics  go-fast during an exercise. When conducting counter drug operations, HITRON aircrews will deploy aboard Coast Guard cutters for thirty- to sixty-day deployments. While on deployment, go-fast boats are searched for not only by the HITRON helicopter but also by shore based maritime patrol aircraft (MPA) such as the Coast Guard HC-130J Hercules. If an MPA locates a go-fast, the HITRON crew will launch from the cutter to intercept it. The crew will approach the suspect vessel with weapons trained on the vessel for self-protection. The helicopter crew will confirm the nationality or lack of nation status and whether the vessel is in fact a suspect smuggling vessel. The aircrew will then attempt to convince the boat crew to stop through the use of sirens, loud speakers, visual hand signals, and radio communications in both English and Spanish. If the vessel stops during this phase, it will be boarded and searched by a boarding team from the cutter which accompanies the chase in an over-the-horizon pursuit boat and is vectored to the scene by the HITRON crew.USCG HITRON Jacksonville If the vessel is found to be carrying drugs, the boarding team will take appropriate law enforcement action. If the suspect vessel fails to stop after numerous visual and verbal warnings, the helicopter crew will take up a firing position alongside the go-fast and the aerial gunner will fire warning shots across their bow with the mounted M240 machine gun to further compel them to stop. If the warning shots do not convince the suspects to stop, the gunner will attempt to disable the vessel by shooting out its engines with a .50 caliber precision rifle. Go-fasts usually have multiple outboard engines and the gunner will continue to fire into these engines until the suspects stop or they are forced to stop. Once the vessel is stopped, it will be boarded by the over-the-Horizon boat's boarding team.U.S. Coast Guard Aviation HistoryHITRON Snipers Taking On Smugglers  History  Agusta MH-68A Stingray formerly operated by HITRON MH-90 Enforcer flown by HITRON-10 in 1999. In 1998, the Coast Guard estimated that it was stopping less than ten percent of the illegal drugs entering the United States by sea. Spurred by these estimates, Admiral James Loy, the then Commandant, directed the Coast Guard to develop a plan to counter the go-fast boats used for smuggling drugs. This gave rise to the Helicopter Interdiction Tactical Squadron. Starting in late 1998, Commander Mark 'Roscoe' Torres molded a group of ten volunteers into a cohesive and effective team, and in just seven months took ideas to reality as the squadron pioneered novel operating tactics and procedures. Flying leased MD900 and MD902 Enforcer helicopters the unit developed and evaluated tactics and procedures for day and night operations.A model of success Commander Roscoe worked closely with then LtCol Mark Mahaffey, Gunnery Sergeant Webb and Sgt Burkhardt from HMLA-269, a United States Marine Corps helicopter squadron. The Marines worked with the Coast Guard aircrews with weapons employment and aerial tactics, which was instrumental in the Coast Guard Aircrews receiving Naval Aerial Gunner Qualifications. The training culminated in a live shoot in which the gunnery and flight operations worked flawlessly and allowed Coast Guard aircrews to actively engage Go-Fast drug boats with aerial weapons. During this early proof of concept phase, HITRON intercepted and stopped all five go-fasts they encountered, stopping of cocaine, and of marijuana with an estimated street value of over US$100 million, with all 17 suspects arrested. Due to their outstanding success during the test and evaluation stage, the HITRON program was validated and designated a permanent Coast Guard unit. The use of armed helicopters was originally classified but after proof of concept the existence of the unit was revealed in September 1999. In 2014 the helicopters also operated from , a patrol vessel of the Royal Dutch Navy and stationed in the Dutch Antilles. http://cgvi.uscg.mil/media/main.php?g2_itemId=110689 Coast Guard Visiual Information Gallery - Ceremony (For Release)  Equipment  A HITRON MH-68A pursues a go-fast boat during drug interdiction training. Aircraft The unit originally flew leased MD 900 and MD 902 helicopters with the unofficial military designation of MH90 Enforcer. When the decision was made to make the squadron permanent and expand it to eight aircraft, Federal contracting laws required a competitive bid to choose a permanent aircraft for the mission. In March 2000, Agusta was awarded the contract to provide eight A109E Power helicopters to replace the MH90 Enforcers that HITRON had been successfully flying. The Agusta A109E Power was given the military designation MH-68A Stingray. In 2008 the Coast Guard allowed the lease for the MH-68As to expire and replaced them with the first of the new MH-65C Dolphins. The MH-65C is an upgraded version of the HH-65B which includes, among other upgrades, new avionics and communications equipment and the ability to carry armament. While not as nimble as the MH-68A, the MH-65C is faster, has greater range and endurance, and provides a smoother ride, therefore allowing more accurate shooting. It also has the logistical advantage of being standardized throughout the Coast Guard. Weapons The squadron was originally armed with M16A2 rifles and mounted M240G machine guns for warning shots and self- protection. The bolt-action Robar RC-50 .50-caliber rifle was used for disabling fire. The RC-50 has been replaced by a variant of the semiautomatic Barrett M107 .50-caliber rifle with an anti-corrosion finish.Guard Orders More Barrett M107 Rifle Systems It is fitted with an EOTech holographic weapon sight and an Insight Technology laser sight. The M14 Tactical, a version of the standard M14 with a Sage Enhanced Battle Rifle stock and improved muzzle brake, is also used by the squadron.

It was founded in 1986. It is a parish of the Holy Protection of Mary Byzantine Catholic Eparchy of Phoenix. History The history of the Byzantine Catholic Church on the Central Coast of California began in the early 1950s when the Petrick, Kubek and Bereczky families settled in San Luis Obispo. Father Anthony Kubek maintained his own private chapel, and for many years celebrated the Divine Liturgy for his family and other interested people. Father Eugene Bereczky also celebrated the Divine Liturgy at his own private chapel in San Luis Obispo during this era to support the needs of the small Eastern Catholic community. After the passing of Frs. Kubek and Bereczky, the community was ministered to for its sacramental needs by visiting priests from the former Pittsburgh Greek Catholic Exarchate including Father Joseph Ridella, Father Eugene Chromoga and Father John Lucas. With the close of World War II, Eastern Catholics whose ancestors had settled and helped to establish parishes in Pennsylvania, New Jersey, Ohio and the Northeast were now migrating to the Western States. By the mid 1980s, former parishioners of the Cathedral of Saint Mary in Sherman Oaks and the Church of the Annunciation in Anaheim who had relocated to the Central Coast of California requested a priest from the Eparchy of Van Nuys to serve their spiritual needs. In 1986, Most Reverend Thomas Dolinay, the first Bishop of Van Nuys, sent his secretary, Father Edmund M. Idranyi, to ascertain the feasibility of beginning a new mission on the Central Coast. San Luis Obispo was chosen as the perfect location, given its central location within the region. Through the good graces of Father James Nisbet, pastor of Old Mission San Luis Obispo de Tolosa, and with the approval of Most Reverend Thaddeus Shubsda, the Bishop of Monterey, the new San Luis Obispo/Santa Maria Byzantine Catholic Mission was given the use of the Old Mission's former convent chapel (now the Oratory of the Immaculate Heart of Mary) for Sunday Divine Liturgies. The first Divine Liturgy was celebrated on Sunday, June 22, 1986 with about 25 of the faithful in attendance. Father Idranyi was assigned to care for the new mission community while continuing his duties at the Eparchy's Chancery Office in Northridge, about 200 miles to the south of San Luis Obispo in the San Fernando Valley. Elevated to parish status and the purchase of premises In the beginning, monthly and major holy day liturgies were celebrated for the growing community. Soon bi-weekly liturgies were the norm, and by September 1986, it was decided that the Divine Liturgy would be celebrated every Sunday and all major holy days. Bishop Dolinay visited the growing community two times, each time celebrating the Divine Liturgy in the main church of the Old Mission. On January 17, 1989, Bishop Dolinay raised the San Luis Obispo/Santa Maria Byzantine Catholic Mission to the canonical status of a parish under the patronage of Saint Anne, the Mother of Mary. Saint Anne was chosen as the patroness largely due to Father Idranyi's long-held devotion to her. The growing parish was quickly outgrowing the Old Mission chapel. In 1990 the opportunity to secure a permanent facility arose. The former Disciples of Christ Church facility at 222 E. Foothill Boulevard was for sale. After protracted negotiations, Most Reverend George Kuzma, the second Bishop of Van Nuys gave permission to purchase the land and structure in 1991 for US$500,000. Bishop Kuzma was concerned that the young parish did not have a pastor, and about Father Idranyi having to commute between Northridge and San Luis Obispo; he assigned Father Idranyi to be the administrator and resident priest of Saint Anne Byzantine Catholic Church. Saint Anne's new home was ready for the celebration of the Divine Liturgy on Christmas Day of 1991. The church was blessed on the following January 6 by Bishop Kuzma. Parish maturity, church remodel and the future On December 6, 2007, it was announced that Pope Benedict XVI had accepted the resignation of 80-year-old Bishop Andrew Pataki of the Byzantine Catholic Eparchy of Passaic and appointed Bishop William C. Skurla of the Byzantine Eparchy of Van Nuys, 51, as his successor. The pope also named the Reverend Gerald N. Dino, 67, protosyncellus of the Passaic Eparchy and pastor of St. George Parish, Linden, New Jersey, to succeed Skurla as bishop of Van Nuys. On March 27, 2008, Bishop Gerald N. Dino was ordained as the fourth bishop of the Eparchy of Van Nuys. In 2008, Saint Anne's Church was redesigned by architect David Tsow and completely remodeled. The remodel included moving the sanctuary so the Divine Liturgy could be celebrated ad orientem, the installation of a new iconostasis, the creation of an office for the pastor, and a sound-proofed room set aside for the Sacrament of the Mystery of Reconciliation which is most certainly the tradition at Saint Anne Parish. On May 18, 2009, Bishop Gerald N. Dino announced the retirement of the Father Edmund Idranyi as Pastor of Saint Anne's Parish effective June 30, 2009. In the same communication he appointed Father Idranyi as Pastor Emeritus of Saint Anne's, recognizing his 23 years of service as the founding pastor of Saint Anne's. Bishop Gerald named Father James Lane as the new pastor of Saint Anne's effective July 1, 2009. On August 1, 2013, Father Milan Kasperek was appointed administrator of the parish. Bishop John S. Pazak, C.Ss.R. of the Eparchy of Phoenix, named Father Michael Bezruchka as Saint Anne's new pastor, effective June 1, 2018, spurring great hope for the future.

The settings of the movie have generally been praised, but one author took exception to the \\"anachronistic period architecture and statuary\\" of Star Wars: Episode I ‚Äì The Phantom Menace, saying it improperly associated third world buildings with conceptions of innocence and the primitive in a way that was discriminatory and demeaning.

The exotic locales provide scenery that is unfamiliar to \\"all but a few experts in non-western architecture\\", providing the films with fantastic settings that could still be believable. Urban planning In 1999, architecture and planning students noted that (The Phantom Menace) offered \\"a variety of urban development options\\". The \\"urban future\\" has also been depicted in Blade Runner where \\"the setting is a grimy, crime-ridden Los Angeles in the 21st century\\". The architecture of Star Wars may also have been influenced by Stanley Kubrick's 2001: A Space Odyssey. The designs continued Lucas' work from his first feature film, THX 1138, which featured a claustrophobic, Orwellian \\"subterranean world of black-and-white spaces\\" where the population is subdued with drugs and kept under constant surveillance. Jedi Temple Architects' Journal rated the Jedi Temple (located in the capital planet of Coruscant) third on its top-ten architecture of Star Wars list behind the second Death Star and Jabba the Hutt‚Äôs palace on Tatooine, and ahead of Coruscant, capital city of the Old Republic. The temple is described in the article as adapting \\"the robust typology of Mayan temples, with durasteel cladding specified for the external stone walls for improved defensive strength\\" and said to be a ziggurat that \\"is built above a Force- nexus and has ample room for training facilities, accommodation and the Jedi Archive.\\" The temple has five towers‚Äîthe tallest is Tranquillity Spire‚Äîthat are stylistically similar to the minarets surrounding the Hagia Sophia in Istanbul.

It was followed by a sequel, Jack the Nipper II: In Coconut Capers. The character is loosely based on the British comic strip character Sweeny Toddler. Gameplay Jack the Nipper is a side-view flip screen game with puzzle solving and platform elements. The graphics are rendered in 2D, but an illusion of depth is achieved by allowing characters to move forward and back within the playing area. The player controls Jack, a naughty child who wants to break the record for naughtiness (recorded on the \\"naughtyometer\\"). He needs to carry out various wicked pranks on the unsuspecting inhabitants of his town, but if he comes into contact by angry adults he will be spanked. With each spanking his \\"nappy rash\\" meter increases, and if it grows too high Jack loses a life. Contact with the monsters and ghosts which inhabit the town will also increase the nappy rash. Reception The game went to number 2 in the UK sales charts, behind Ghosts'n'Goblins. Sinclair User described it as having a \\"Wallyish style reminiscent of Pyjamarama, running wild through the village, searching houses, shops and gardens for objects you can use to create havoc elsewhere\\", in an environment populated by \\"Beano\\"-type characters. The review noted how it was \\"tempting when you come across a well-tended garden and you just happen to have a bottle of weed killer ... And then there's the tin of glue and the false teeth factory...\\" ZX Computing praised the graphics. The Spectrum version was voted number 40 in the Your Sinclair Readers' Top 100 Games of All Time. Comic strip Starting in April 1987, Your Sinclair magazine published a monthly comic strip based on the character.

A large proportion of the book contains detailed information on the domestication of animals and plants but it also contains in Chapter XXVII a description of Darwin's theory of heredity which he called pangenesis. Background Darwin had been working for two years on his \\"big book\\" on Natural Selection, when on 18 June 1858 he received a parcel from Alfred Wallace, who was then living in Borneo. It enclosed a twenty pages manuscript describing an evolutionary mechanism that was similar to Darwin's own theory. Under pressure to publish his ideas, Darwin started work on an \\"abstract\\" trimmed from his Natural Selection which was published in November 1859 as On the Origin of Species. In the introduction he announced that in a future publication he hoped to give \\"in detail all the facts, with references, on which my conclusions have been grounded\\". On 9 January 1860, two days after the publication of the second edition of Origin, Darwin returned to his original Natural Selection manuscript and began expanding the first two chapters on \\"Variation under Domestication\\". He had a large collection of additional notes and by the middle of June had written drafts of an introduction and two chapters on the domestication of pigeons that would eventually form part of The Variation of Animals and Plants under Domestication. Darwin apparently found writing the book tiresome and writes in his autobiography that he had been \\"tempted to publish on other subjects which at the time interested me more.\\" In the following July (1861) he began work on different book, the Fertilisation of Orchids which was published in May 1862. Darwin continued to gather data. His own practical experiments were confined to plants but he was able to gather information from others by correspondence and even to arrange for some of his correspondents to conduct experiments on his behalf. In spite of protracted periods of illness, he made progress and in March 1865 wrote to his publisher, John Murray, saying that \\"Of present book I have 7 chapters ready for press & all others very forward, except the last & concluding one\\" (the book as finally published consisted of 28 chapters). In the same letter he discussed illustrations for the book. Darwin had been mulling for many years on a theory of heredity. In May 1865 he sent a manuscript to his friend Thomas Huxley outlining his theory which he called pangenesis and asking whether he should publish it. In his accompanying letter Darwin wrote \\"It is a very rash & crude hypothesis yet it has been a considerable relief to my mind, & I can hang on it a good many groups of facts.\\" Huxley pointed out the similarities of pangenesis to the theories of Georges Louis Leclerc, Comte de Buffon, and the Swiss naturalist Charles Bonnet but eventually wrote encouraging Darwin to publish: \\"Somebody rummaging among your papers half a century hence will find Pangenesis & say 'See this wonderful anticipation of our modern Theories‚Äîand that stupid ass, Huxley, prevented his publishing them'\\". Publication Rock dove or Columba livia, the parent form of all domesticated pigeons Just before Christmas 1866 all of the manuscript except for the final chapter was sent to the publisher. At the beginning January on receiving an estimate of the size of the two volume book from the printers he wrote to his publisher: \\"I cannot tell you how sorry I am to hear of the enormous size of my Book.\\" He subsequently arranged for some of the more technical sections to be set in smaller type. Even at this late stage Darwin was uncertain as to whether to include a chapter on mankind. At the end of January he wrote to Murray: \\"I feel a full conviction that my Chapter on man will excite attention & plenty of abuse & I suppose abuse is as good as praise for selling a Book\\" but he then apparently decided against the idea for a week later in a letter to his close friend Joseph Hooker he explained \\"I began a chapter on Man, for which I have long collected materials, but it has grown too long, & I think I shall publish separately a very small volume, 'an essay on the origin of mankind'\\". This \\"essay\\" would become two books: The Descent of Man, and Selection in Relation to Sex (1871) and The Expression of Emotions in Man and Animals (1872). The book had been advertised as early as 1865 with the unwieldy title Domesticated Animals and Cultivated Plants, or the Principles of Variation, Inheritance, Reversion, Crossing, Interbreeding, and Selection under DomesticationSee Footnote 2 in but Darwin agreed to the shorter The Variation of Animals and Plants Under Domestication suggested by the compositors. By May he had arranged for the book to be translated into French, Russian and German. The French edition would be translated by Jean Jacques Moulini√©, the German by Julius Victor Carus who had produced the revised version of Origin in 1866 and the Russian edition by Vladimir Onufrievich Kovalevsky, the brother of the embryologist Alexander Kovalevsky. Darwin received the first proofs on 1 March 1867. In the tedious task of making correction he was helped by his 23-year-old daughter Henrietta Emma Darwin. In the summer while she was away in Cornwall he wrote to commend her work, \\"All your remarks, criticisms doubts & corrections are excellent, excellent, excellent\\". While making corrections Darwin also added new material. The proofs were finished on 15 November, but there was a further delay while William Dallas prepared an index. The Variation of Animals and Plants under Domestication went on sale on 30 January 1868, thirteen years after Darwin had begun his experiments on breeding and stewing the bones of pigeons. He was feeling deflated, and concerned about how these large volumes would be received, writing \\"if I try to read a few pages I feel fairly nauseated ... The devil take the whole book\\".; . In his autobiography he estimated that he had spent 4-year 2 months \\"hard labour\\" on the book. Contents English carrier pigeon ‚Äì one of many domesticated varieties deriving from the wild Columba livia or rock dove The first volume of The Variation of Animals and Plants under Domestication consists in a lengthy and highly detailed exploration of the mechanisms of variation, including the principle of use and disuse, the principle of the correlation of parts, and the role of the environment in causing variation, at work in a number of domestic species. Darwin starts with dogs and cats, discussing the similarities between wild and domesticated dogs, and musing on how the species changed to accommodate man's wishes. He attempts to trace a genealogy of contemporary varieties (or \\"races\\") back to a few early progenitors. These arguments, as well as many others, use the vast amount of data Darwin gathered about dogs and cats to support his overarching thesis of evolution through natural selection. He then goes on to make similar points regarding horses and donkeys, sheep, goats, pigs, cattle, various types of domesticated fowl, a large number of different cultivated plants, and, most thoroughly, pigeons. Notably, in Chapter XXVII Darwin introduced his \\"provisional hypothesis\\" of pangenesis that he had first outlined to Huxley in 1865.For a discussion of how Darwin arrived at his hypothesis see He proposed that each part of an organism contains minute invisible particles which he called gemmules. These were capable of regenerating the organism so that the leaf of a begonia or a worm chopped into pieces could generate the complete organism and a salamander or crab that lost a limb could regenerate the limb. The gemmules were dispersed around the organism and could multiply by division. In sexual reproduction they were transmitted from parents to their offspring with the mixing of the gemmules producing offspring with 'blended' characteristics of the parents. Gemmules could also remain dormant for several generations before becoming active. He also suggested that the environment might affect the gemmules in an organism and thus allowed for the possibility of the Lamarckian inheritance of acquired characteristics. Darwin believed that his theory could explain a wide range of phenomena: > All the forms of reproduction graduate into each other and agree in their > product; for it is impossible to distinguish between organisms produced from > buds, from self-division, or from fertilised germs ... and as we now see > that all the forms of reproduction depend on the aggregation of gemmules > derived from the whole body, we can understand this general agreement. It is > satisfactory to find that sexual and asexual generation ... are > fundamentally the same. Parthenogenesis is no longer wonderful; in fact, the > wonder is that it should not oftener occur. In the final pages of the book Darwin directly challenged the argument of divinely guided variation advocated by his friend and supporter the American botanist Asa Gray. He used the analogy of an architect using rocks which had broken off naturally and fallen to the foot of a cliff, asking \\"Can it be reasonably maintained that the Creator intentionally ordered ... that certain fragments should assume certain shapes so that the builder might erect his edifice?\\"; In the same way, breeders or natural selection picked those that happened to be useful from variations arising by \\"general laws\\", to improve plants and animals, \\"man included\\". Darwin concluded with: \\"However much we may wish it, we can hardly follow Professor Asa Gray in his belief that 'variation has been along certain beneficial lines,' like a 'stream along definite and useful lines of irrigation'\\". Darwin confided to Hooker \\"It is foolish to touch such subjects, but there have been so many allusions to what I think about the part which God has played in the formation of organic beings, that I thought it shabby to evade the question.\\" Reception Spanish fowl Darwin was concerned whether anyone would read the massive volumes and was also anxious to receive feedback from his friends on their views on pangenesis. In October 1867 before the book was published he sent copies of the corrected proofs to Asa Gray with the comment: \\"The chapter on what I call Pangenesis will be called a mad dream, and I shall be pretty well satisfied if you think it a dream worth publishing; but at the bottom of my own mind I think it contains a great truth.\\" He wrote to Hooker: \\"I shall be intensely anxious to hear what you think about Pangenesis\\" and to the German naturalist Fritz M√ºller: \\"The greater part, as you will see, is not meant to be read; but I should very much like to hear what you think of 'Pangenesis'.\\"; Few of Darwin's colleagues shared his enthusiasm for pangenesis. Wallace was initially supportive and Darwin confided to him: \\"None of my friends will speak out, except to a certain extent Sir H. Holland, who found it very tough reading, but admits that some view 'closely akin to it' will have to be admitted.\\"; By the end of April Variation had received more than 20 reviews. An anonymous review by George Henry Lewes in the Pall Mall Gazette praised its \\"noble calmness ... undisturbed by the heats of polemical agitation\\" which made the far from calm Darwin laugh, and left him \\"cock-a-hoop\\".; In 1875 a second edition was published in which Darwin made a number of corrections and also reworked Chapter XI on Bud-variation and Chapter XXVII on Pangenesis. The book never became popular and sold only 5000 copies in Darwin's lifetime. De Vries in 1889 praised the \\"masterly survey of the phenomena to be explained\\" and accepted the idea that \\"the individual hereditary qualities of the whole organism are represented by definite material particles\\". He introduced the notion of intracellula pangenesis which, following August Weismann, rejected the idea that these particles were thrown off from all the cells of the body. He called the particles \\"pangens\\", later abbreviated to \\"gene\\". .Written as pangene in the German text. . In a similar vein, Weismann in his 1893 work Germ-Plasm said \\"although Darwin modestly described his theory as a provisional hypothesis, his was, nevertheless, the first comprehensive attempt to explain all the known phenomena of heredity by a common principle ... [I]n spite of the fact that a considerable number of these assumptions are untenable, a part of the theory still remains which must be accepted as fundamental and correct,--in principle at any rate,--not only now but for all time to come. ... presupposing the existence of material particles in the germ which possess the properties of the living being ... I must honestly confess to having mentally resisted this fundamental point of the Darwinian doctrine for a long time.\\" See also *Inception of Darwin's theory *Publication of Darwin's theory *Darwin from Orchids to Variation *List of works by Charles Darwin Notes References *. *. *. *. *. *. *. *. *.

Like his other novels, this one also deals with the topic of oppression of the poor, and is about a peasant who tries to protect his daughter from a British soldier. The story is based in the tea plantations of Assam. The book was subsequently adapted to a Hindi film, Rahi, by Dev Anand and simultaneously released in English as The Wayfarer. The book depicts in detail the concept of haves and have-nots and the exploitation of one at the hand of the other, in pre-independence India. This is a dramatic novel that ends with a \\"tragic clash of interests and destinies\\". Plot Gangu is a middle aged peasant living in Hoshiarpur with his wife Sajani, daughter Leila and his son Budhu. Because of his outstanding debts he ends up losing his lands and as such, readily agrees to travel to Assam to take on a plantation job that would pay well and allow Gangu to own his own land. However upon his arrival Gangu finds that this was all a trick and that the job is essentially slave labor. Their pay is not even enough to buy food and many of the merchants offer loans with interest rates so high that repayment is impossible. Gangu and his family are forced to live their lives in squalor and to endure all sorts of abuse and degradation. On top of this Sajani and Leila are subjected to rape and other sexual degradation. The general poor treatment and living conditions provoke concern in the plantation's doctor, John De La Harve, especially as the threat of cholera looms over the plantation. He tries to persuade the plantation's boss, Croft-Cooke, into improving conditions of the workers (called coolies) but to no avail, as Croft-Cook believes that coolies are sub-human and are not deserving of even the smallest human consideration. As a result the plantation is struck by cholera and Sajani ends up contracting and then dying of the disease. Since he is too poor to perform the necessary last rites, Gangu tries to borrow money from Croft-Cooke but is turned away because he is believed to be carrying cholera. Things take a turn for the worse when Reggie Hunt, a British officer, takes notice of Leila and chases her with the intent to rape her. Gangu tries to stop him but is instead shot and killed by Hunt. The officer is charged with Gangu's murder, but a trial comprised predominantly of Englishmen finds him not guilty.

He was born at Leith in Scotland on 23 April 1887 and died at St Mary's Hospital, Paddington, London on 2 October 1974.  Early Life  He was the son of Sir John McFadyean, Principal of the Royal Veterinary College in Londonhttps://www.thetimes.co.uk/article/knight-after-knight-rfc58r9t5lh and his wife Mara Eleanor Walley. He attended University College School, London, and University College, Oxford, where he graduated with a second class in classical honour moderations (1907) and a first in literae humaniores (1909).G. C. Peden, 'McFadyean, Sir Andrew (1887‚Äì1974)', Oxford Dictionary of National Biography, Oxford University Press, 2004; online edn, May 2006 accessed 1 Sept 2009  Family  His marriage to Dorothea Emily, youngest daughter of Charles Keane Chute, actor, took place on 7 October 1913. There were four children from the marriage: a son, Colin, who was born in 1914, and three daughters, Sybil Barbara (b. 1917), Margaret Ann (b. 1925), and Joan Eleanor (b. 1930).  Career in public service  In 1910 McFadyean joined the Treasury and between 1913 and 1917 he acted as private secretary to six financial secretaries. The latter included Charles Masterman, Edwin Montagu, and Stanley Baldwin; he also doubled as private secretary to Sir John Bradbury, the joint permanent secretary. He accompanied Sir Samuel Hardman Lever on an important financial mission to the USA in 1917; from 1917 to 1919, he served in the Treasury division, where his responsibilities included external finance. During the final four months of the peace conference in Paris after World War 1, he acted as representative for the Treasury, becoming its leading expert on World War I reparations and war debts, and establishing a reputation in the European capitals. From 1920 to 1922, he was the secretary of the British delegation to the Reparations Commission; from 1922 to 1924, he was general secretary to the Commission itself. Later he became secretary to the Dawes Committee (which produced the Dawes plan) and subsequently Chief Commissioner of Revenue in Berlin until his departure from this sphere in 1930. In 1924, he worked for a reduction in German reparations; in this he agreed with John Maynard Keynes, whose book, The Economic Consequences of the Peace, had been published in 1919. German finances had been devastated by hyper-inflation. The Dawes Committee, for which McFadyean was secretary, instituted the Dawes Plan, which proposed that reparations should be paid, but without distorting rates of exchange. The payment of reparations was rescheduled, and they were met by raising taxes in Germany as its economy recovered. The German currency, the Reichsmark, would be stabilised on gold, thus bringing about a restoration of confidence and enabling an international loan to be raised to cover the instalment for the first year. Reparations were to be held in a fund. Conversion of this fund into other currencies would not be permitted if this brought about a depreciation of the Reichsmark. He became one of four allied controllers supervising payments under the Dawes Plan, and he was based in Berlin as commissioner for controlled revenues. McFadyean was knighted in 1925. In 1929 the Dawes Plan was replaced by the Young Plan, with which he had no direct part, and this aimed at a final settlement of reparations. Upon his return from Berlin, he did not rejoin the Treasury, but instead started a career in the City of London. He became a director of various companies, particularly of refugee firms from Germany. He was chairman of S. G. Warburg & Co. Ltd, from its inception in 1934 (as the New Trading Company Ltd) until 1952, and a director until 1967, by which time it had become a major merchant bank.  Politics  His career in politics started in 1936, when he became the joint treasurer of the Liberal Party, a post which he held until 1948. He served as President of the Party from 1949 to 1950 and Vice-President from 1950 to 1960. His attempts to be elected to Parliament in 1945 as the Liberal and Free Trade candidate for the City of London, and 1950 for Finchley were unsuccessful. He advocated proportional representation, and was a supporter of the Scottish Covenant, which worked towards a devolved Scottish parliament. He opposed the abolition of nuclear weapons, arguing that it was an impossibility.  Furtherance of international co-operation  From 1933 to 1967 he was a member of the council of the Royal Institute of International Affairs (Chatham House), becoming its president in 1970. In 1944 he became chairman of the Pacific Relations committee. He advocated European unity on liberal principles and translated two books from German into English by Count Richard von Coudenhove-Kalergi: The Totalitarian State Against Man (1938), arguing against the Hegelian conception of the state, and Europe must Unite (1940), calling for a European commonwealth based on a European ideal transcending, without weakening, national patriotisms. In 1941, and with the Treaty of Versailles in mind, McFadyean was already arguing against repressive measures toward a post-war Germany. He was active in the Liberal International, helping to create this body after the Second World War and serving as its vice-president from 1954 to 1967. He strongly supported the idea of the European Common Market and, believing that tariffs and monopolist and restrictive practices in industry were wrecking the UK's competitiveness, he served as president of the Free Trade Union from 1948 to 1959. He helped persecuted Jews (also urging the admission of Jewish refugees to Palestine) and enemy aliens who had been unjustly interned by the UK during the war. He worked with John MacCallum after the Second World War to organise the Liberal International, which succeeded the pre-war 'Entente Internationale des Partis Radicaux et D√©mocratiques'. The Liberal International was established at Wadham College, Oxford, in 1947 and McFadyean became its vice-president.

Early years McConkie was born in Buena Vista, Utah, a small town close to Moab, Utah. At the time, his father was sought by government officials for recognizing his three wives. As such, so not long after his birth, Oscar moved to Mexico. His father died in Pacheco, Galeana, Chihuahua in December 1890. After his father's death, the family moved to Mona, Utah, where McConkie was raised. The McConkies moved to Moab when Oscar was ten years old. After graduating from Moab High School, McConkie attended the University of Utah. In 1913, he married Margaret Vivian Redd in the Salt Lake Temple. In 1914, McConkie began his studies at the University of Michigan, which led to his son, Bruce, being born in Ann Arbor. Early career After two years at law school, McConkie was having eye troubles and so returned to Utah. He worked as editor of the San Juan Record, based from Monticello, Utah, where he also practiced law until 1922.Son Bruce R.

The device made communication by telephone possible for the deaf. Although Robert Weitbrecht did much of the actual design work, Marsters promoted the device's use. Early life and career Marsters was born April 5, 1924 in Norwich, New York to pharmaceutical executive Guy Marsters and his wife Anna Belle, a nurse. When he was very young, Marsters lost his hearing to scarlet fever and measles. However, he learned to speak and to read lips. He graduated from Wright Oral School for the Deaf in New York City in 1943. It was there that he met John Tracy, the son of Spencer Tracy. In 1947 Marsters received a chemistry degree from Union College in Schenectady, New York. Marsters married Joan Tausik, an artist who was also deaf (they later divorced), and went to work in her father's tie factory. It was Tausik's father who suggested he should become a dentist. Though Marsters' test scores were high, dental schools rejected him because of his deafness. After two and a half years of applying, New York University agreed to admit him on a provisional basis with the understanding that he would receive no special assistance. He graduated from New York University in 1952. He used to claim he could hear some, to help calm the fears of some of his dental school professors. He also flew an airplane between two cities where he practiced, and he would claim his radio wasn't working right and ask air traffic controllers to use lights to guide him. John Tracy, whose name is on a Los Angeles clinic for hearing-impaired children encouraged Marsters to become an orthodontist, and in 1954, after studies at USC, he began his Pasadena practice. Soon after that, he married Alice Amelia Dorsey, the director of the clinic at John Tracy Clinic's preschool. Marsters had three children‚ÄîJames Marsters Jr., a chemist; Jean Marsters, a doctor; and Guy Marsters, a musician. Alice died in 2003. The couple had two grandchildren. Marsters died July 28, 2009 of a heart ailment. Role in developing the Teletypewriter When Marsters received a phone call, he depended on others to answer the phone and mouth the words to him so he could read lips, after which he would reply on the telephone. At the time, there was a TTY network for business, but it was too expensive for individuals. Marsters approached Robert Weitbrecht a deaf physicist of Stanford Research Institute and suggested he look into creating a device that would allow the deaf to communicate with teletypewriters across the phone lines. Teletypewriter Prototype Weitbrecht believed an acoustic coupler (now known as a modem) could be used to convert electrical signals into tones that could be sent through wires. On the receiving end, the tones changed back to electrical signals so the message could be printed. After communicating with Marsters, Weitbrecht developed an echo suppressing acoustic coupler in November 1963 for the purpose of using on TTY devices. They obtained old, salvaged teletypewriters machines from Western Union and the Defense Department and hooked them up to Weitbrecht's prototype modems. In 1964, Weitbrecht succeeded in using the device to make a long-distance telephone call, to Marsters. It took several tries, until Weitbrecht's words appeared clearly: \\"Are you printing me now? Let's quit for now and gloat over the success.\\" Together with engineer Andrew Saks (also deaf), whose grandfather started Saks Fifth Avenue, Marsters and Weitbrecht created The Applied Communications Corporation of Belmont, California to manufacture the modem. Marsters persuaded deaf people to try the new device, using donated teletypewriters which deaf volunteers fixed up, delivered and installed in deaf homes. He also went to hospitals and fire departments, asking them to install the devices for emergency communication. Jean Marsters, his daughter, said her father \\"was the public speaker, the can-do man who wouldn't take no for an answer.\\" Before this could be done, the telephone company had to agree to allow the use of the device across the telephone lines. At that time the phone company owned the phone lines and all telephones (which were rented to consumers), and they opposed this new technology. Bill Saks, Andrew's son, said > people don't realize it, but Ma Bell had absolute control over how her > instruments were used, and there were draconian consequences for ... > attaching anything to their devices. The phone companies were the Goliaths. > Those three gentlemen were the Davids. Marsters and other deaf advocates had to go to Washington to lobby for TTY communication to become legalized. Four years later in 1968, the Federal Communications Commission required AT&T; to allow the use of the devices provided they did not cause problems to the phone company's operations. This removed the last obstacle to what became a deaf telecommunications revolution. According to Harry G. Lang, a professor at the National Technical Institute for the Deaf in Rochester, New York, \\"It was a technological declaration of independence for deaf people.\\" Marsters' son Jim Marsters Jr. said that his father was modest, claiming, \\"The glory is not mine. It was an effort of many.\\" RIT gave Marsters an honorary doctorate in 1996 and put Marsters' modem used for that first TTY call on display at Wallace Memorial Library. Marsters served on NTID's advisory board and, in 2000, established a scholarship for persons with hearing impairment. Teletypewriter Continued Use Telecommunications for the Deaf and Hard of Hearing, Inc. (TDI) began awarding the James C. Marsters Promotion Award for those who helped provide access for those with disabilities. The number of TTY devices increased from 18 in 1966, author Karen Peltz Strauss said, to 30,000 40 years later. The Internet probably resulted in a decline in the devices' use after a peak in the 1990s, she said. TTY's could only communicate with other TTY's until the late 1960s when Marsters and Saks developed the idea of having phone company operators take TTY message and relay them by voice to hearing phones, and vice versa. One early attempt at this did not last because of the cost and the noise the machines made, but the concept led to a requirement of a similar service in the Americans with Disabilities Act in 1990 which is available nationwide today. The Internet has replaced the TTY for the most part, but emergency services continue to use it.

Johnson, editor of The Weekly People from 1918 to 1938. Olivin \\"Olive\\" Malmberg Johnson (March 14, 1872 ‚Äì June 16, 1952) was an American socialist, newspaper editor and political activist. She is best remembered as a long-time editor of the weekly English-language newspaper of the Socialist Labor Party of America. Biography Olivin Malberg was born March 14, 1872 in Lund, Sweden, the daughter of a merchant. The family emigrated to the United States in the 1890s,Ben Perry, \\"Olive M. Johnson,\\" in Mari Jo Buhle, Paul Buhle and Dan Georgakas (eds.), Encyclopedia of the American Left. First Edition. New York: Garland Publishing, 1990; pg. 394. with Olive graduating high school in Minneapolis, Minnesota.Solon DeLeon with Irma C. Hayssen and Grace Poole (eds.), The American Labor Who's Who. New York: Hanford Press, 1925; pg. 117. Olive joined the Socialist Labor Party of America (SLP) in 1895. She acted as a lecturer and speaker on behalf of the party beginning in 1898. She worked variously as a retail clerk, restaurant worker, office worker, housekeeper, and teacher. Malmberg was married to another member party member by the name of Johnson, took his name, and moved with him to California. The Johnsons' marriage eventually ended, but as was the custom of the day, Olive kept her former husband's surname after its dissolution. She never remarried. Johnson attended Hunter College in New York City, from which she obtained a bachelor's degree in 1916, at the age of 44. She later did graduate course work at Columbia University and New York University. Political career Johnson was a close friend and trusted political associate of party leader Daniel DeLeon (1852‚Äì1914). She was first elected a member of the governing National Executive Committee of the SLP in 1904, remaining in that capacity until 1912. She joined DeLeon as a delegate of the SLP to the 1910 Copenhagen Congress of the Second International and was a delegate to many of the SLP's quadrennial national conventions, beginning in 1904. Johnson was also close to Arnold Petersen (1885‚Äì1976), the Danish-born successor to Daniel DeLeon's mantle as top leader of the Socialist Labor Party. In 1918, Johnson became editor of the SLP's official newspaper, The Weekly People, replacing Edmund Seidel, who had begun advocating a merger with the leftward tilting Socialist Party of America. She remained in that position for 20 years, also writing many articles and pamphlets on behalf of the party. A number of Johnson's pamphlets were translated into Swedish, Hungarian, Ukrainian, and Croatian by the various foreign language federations of the SLP. As editor of the SLP's official organ, Johnson continued to advocate a harsh line towards other political organizations on the left. Historian Ben Perry notes: > \\"Her editorial positions were especially hostile to the Communist and > Socialist parties and the anti-political Industrial Workers of the World, > but she also condemned the CIO as well as non-revolutionary movements such > as the cooperative movement and the New Deal. She was very active during > this period, not only as editor, but also as a pamphlet writer, speaker, and > candidate for public office.\\" On the SLP ticket, Johnson ran for Governor of New York in 1918, for Mayor of New York City in 1929, and for U.S. Senator from New York in 1934. Johnson was elected by the SLP as its fraternal delegate to the 3rd World Congress of the Communist International in 1922, but was refused a passport to travel by the American government. In the early 1930s Johnson contracted tuberculosis, a disease which sapped her vitality, and she was forced to handle the editorial tasks of The Weekly People more and more from her home. In 1938 she retired from editing the newspaper. Death and legacy Olive M. Johnson died in Malibu, California on June 16, 1954, at 82 years of age. Her ashes were scattered at Topanga Canyon, California where she had lived with her brother Nils Malmberg for several years.

It is located on Southampton Island's Bell Peninsula at the mouth of Native Bay. It is notable for being the location of an abandoned Sadlermiut settlement, currently an archaeological site. Archaeological site The Sadlermiut settlement, situated on the west side of the point, was abandoned after the Sadlermiut became extinct during the winter between 1902 and 1903. Now a notable archeological site, it is referred to as \\"T1\\" because of the Inuktitut name, \\"Tuneriut\\", for Native Point. T1 is the largest Sadlermiut site on the island. The material culture of the Sadlermiut were limited to chipped stone tools and various manufactured organic artifacts. Among the artifacts found in the site were human figurines called aarnguaq, which was probably used for a healing ritual. This indicates that the Sadlermiut were shamanistic. In addition, multiple human remains were found on the site.

Orano began his political career as a revolutionary syndicalist in Italian Socialist Party. He later became a leading figure within the National Fascist Party. Early life Orano was born in 1875 in Rome to a local father and a Sardinian mother. He learned literature and philosophy at University of Rome and graduated in 1898. In the next year he began teaching philosophy high schools, including in Siena, Senigallia and Tivoli. He also worked with various publishers. Syndicalism Orano began his political career as one of a number of leading syndicalist thinkers associated with the Italian Socialist Party at the turn of the century. His estrangement from the Socialists began in 1905 when he resigned his position at the newspaper Avanti! following the dismissal of syndicalist Enrico Leone.Zeev Sternhell, Mario Sznajder & Maia Ash√©ri, The Birth of Fascist Ideology: From Cultural Rebellion to Political Revolution, 1995, p. 112 Along with fellow syndicalists Arturo Labriola and Robert Michels, as well as nationalist Enrico Corradini, Orano became part of a group of intellectuals who followed the ideals of Georges Sorel.Matthew Affron & Mark Antliff, Fascist Visions: Art and Ideology in France and Italy, 1997, p. 6 To this end he founded his own weekly newspaper, La Lupa, in October 1910.Sternhell et al, The Birth of Fascist Ideology, p. 236 It came to represent the first collaboration between syndicalists like Orano and nationalists like Enrico Corradini.Sternhell et al, The Birth of Fascist Ideology, p. 32 Benito Mussolini would later claim that this paper was an influence on his political ideas. Orano became a strong critic of democracy, seeing it as the cause of Italy's ills and his rhetoric, along with that of fellow syndicalists such as Filippo Corridoni and Angelo Olivetti, was by 1914 very similar to that coming from the Italian Nationalist Association.Anthony James Gregor, Mussolini's Intellectuals, 2004, p. 58 Orano supported the First World War, ostensibly because he hoped that it would strengthen both the bourgeoisie and proletariat and thus hasten the process of class conflict and revolution. However his views caused considerable controversy within the syndicalist movement and helped to bring about its fragmentation as many of those associated with the movement, in particular Leone, were anti-war.Michael Miller Topp, Those Without a Country: The Political Culture of Italian American Syndicalists, 2001, p. 75 By the end of the war his positions were largely indistinguishable from those of the nationalists.Gregor, Mussolini's Intellectuals, p. 85 Fascism Orano soon moved over to the Fascists and during the March on Rome he served as Mussolini's chief of staff, whilst also occupying a seat on the Grand Council of the party.Paul Ginsborg, A History of Contemporary Italy: Society and Politics, 1943-1988, p. 92 He enjoyed a high- profile under the fascist government, serving in the parliament and holding the post of rector of the University of Perugia.Joshua D. Zimmerman, Jews in Italy under Fascist and Nazi Rule, 1922-1945, 2005, p. 29 His most notable contribution to fascism was his anti-semitism and he was the author in 1937 of the book The Jews in Italy.R.J.B. Bosworth, The Oxford Handbook of Fascism, Oxford University Press, 2009, p. 308 The book was influenced by Bernard Lazare in so much as it accepted his thesis that the activities of the Jews themselves helped to cause anti-semitism, although it made no reference to Lazare's refutations of the prejudice.Wiley Feinstein, The Civilization of the Holocaust in Italy, 2003, p. 164 In the book Orano expressed affection for some individual Jews, notably Ettore Ovazza, but nonetheless the book helped to legitimise anti-Semitism as a part of Italian fascism and laid the groundwork for later persecutions. Despite this the non-biological nature of his anti-semitism meant that he did not go far enough for Giovanni Preziosi, who attacked Orano's work in his journal La Vita Italiana.David D. Roberts, The Syndicalist Tradition and Italian Fascism, 1979, pp. 323-4 Captured in 1944 he was held along with many fellow fascist officials at a prison camp at Padula where he died the following year following complications with a peptic ulcer haemorrhage. Other writing As well as his political writing Orano was also noted for his psychological and philosophical work. His 1897 book Cristo e Quirino criticised Christianity from a Nietzschean perspective, suggesting that it told people to accept their lot in life and thus solidified hierarchy in society.Richard A. Webster, The Cross and the Fasces: Christian Democracy and Fascism in Italy, 1960, p. 32 Mussolini would later use these arguments about the parallels between the Roman Catholic Church and the Roman Empire, and thus common ground between fascism and Catholicism, during his negotiations with Pius XI, much to horror of the pontiff who considered the very notion heretical.Webster, The Cross and the Fasces, p. 110 His 1902 book Psicologia Sociale sought to attack transpersonal psychology and instead argued in favour of materialism and inductive reasoning that took into account the works of Karl Marx and Charles Darwin.Jaap van Ginneken, Crowds, Psychology, and Politics, 1871-1899, 1992, p. 88 References Category:1875 births Category:1945 deaths Category:Italian fascists Category:Italian psychologists Category:Italian male writers Category:Italian Socialist Party politicians Category:Writers from Rome Category:National syndicalists Category:Antisemitism in Italy Category:University of Perugia faculty Category:Deaths from bleeding ","title":"Paolo Orano"},{"id":"24181478","text":" Stephan Krehl.

The line operates hourly (except overnight) between the Moravia loop in Northeast Baltimore and Whispering Woods, just east of Bowleys Quarters. History Route 59 was formed under the name \\"Route 24\\" in 1988 as a split-off from Route 35, which previously provided the original route of this service, serving Oliver Beach since 1970, and the Town and Country Apartments in Bowleys Quarters since 1971.https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=hjEbAAAAIBAJ&sjid;=ACADAAAAIBAJ&pg;=4247,1163645&dq;=oliver- beach+bus The line originated from Franklin Square Hospital and then operated through the parking lot of the now defunct Golden Ring Mall, then to a stop in Middle River, where buses made a U-turn, and continued east on Eastern Boulevard to Oliver Beach. This terminus was later scaled back to Tidewater Village, the community now identified as Whispering Woods. Service on this line was provided seven days a week, but less than once an hour, even during rush hour. Minor improvements to the line were made in its first 17 years, which included a modification in 1993 to serve the Victory Villa community. But its largest growth came in 2005, when a previously unannounced GBBI change was made, in which steady hourly service was provided, and selected trips were routed via Pulaski Industrial Park. This unplanned change was made to settle various complaints from riders losing service on Route 23. This change was cost-efficient as buses alternated between 4 and 24. In 2006, the layover was moved from Franklin Square Hospital to the CCBC Essex campus to improve exchanges with Route 4 buses. In February 2009, the line was shortened, as Route 4 was modified to serve the Martin Boulevard corridor. But neither line's frequency was changed. On August 31, 2009, selected trips on Route 33 to Essex Park-and-Ride which had operated since 2005 were discontinued, and the line was shortened to the Moravia loop. Route 24 was simultaneously extended to this location to replace this service.

In 2013, the club was joined by keeper Joe van der Sar, the son of Edwin, who joined from the AFC Ajax youth, a career move similar the one taken by father Edwin in 1990. Joe van der Sar played in Noordwijk until 2017, gradually losing his opening position over time, then left to Young ADO Den Haag. In 2016, Champions League winner Edwin van der Sar came out of retirement to play a single match for VV Noordwijk, when it suffered an injury crisis.

The names of the individual journals consist of the prefix American Economic Journal with a descriptor of the field attached. The four field journals which started in 2009 are Applied Economics, Economic Policy, Macroeconomics, and Microeconomics.  History  The American Economic Association set up an ad hoc Committee on Journals chaired by Robert Hall which in April 2006, after a three-year study of the subject, recommended that the American Economic Association (AEA) start four new field journals. One of the reasons given was that almost all other academic societies publish more than three journals, and that by adding more journals, the diversity of editors would be increased. Other reasons included the elevated pricing of field journals in economics, most of which are published by Elsevier, and the inability of The American Economic Review to deal with the large number of submissions it received.David Glenn. \\"American Economic Association Plans 4 New Journals\\".

It is open daily without charge. Marburg's first botanical garden was established between 1527-1533 when the humanist, poet, physician and botanist , considered a founder of scientific botany in Germany, is known to have set up a private botanical garden of which designs little is known today. In 1786 a second garden attempt was created by Professor Conrad Moench near the Elisabeth Church (Marburg). Today's garden dates to 1810 when Georg Wilhelm Franz Wenderoth (1774-1861) obtained the site from J√©r√¥me Bonaparte in exchange for the earlier Ketzerbach garden, which he then developed into the English style to create a combination of park landscape and scientific garden. In 1861 Albert Wigand transformed the garden to conform with the school of Peter Joseph Lenn√© and Johann Heinrich Gustav Meyer, creating sections especially for trees. Later on, 1873-1875 the Botanical Institute was built at Pilgrimstein 4 in Gothic Revival style. In 1977 the university's gardens were transferred to the Neuer Botanischer Garten Marburg, and in 1994 the Old Botanical Garden became a registered cultural monument. Although still owned by the university, it is now used mainly as a public park containing a fine arboretum of mature trees that are over 200 years old, including specimens Quercus petraea, Platanus x acerifolia, Salix alba, Liriodendron tulipifera, and many conifers.

It was consecrated on 4 October 1929, and is dedicated to the memory of the former students and staff of the University who lost their lives in the First World War. It is located in the West Quadrangle of the Main Building of the University, and was designed by John James Burnet. The chapel is protected as a category A listed building. History The University's former premises on the High Street were on the site of an old Dominican monastery, known as the Black Friars, and the University used the friars' old church for services. The University subsequently relocated to Gilmorehill in 1870, although the New College was not finished for many years after, and there was at the time no chapel. The West Quadrangle of the new building was not enclosed on its west side originally; instead, staircases at either end of the court led onto The Square, where the Professors and Principal had their houses. The southern of these staircases was the Lion and Unicorn Staircase, which was relocated from its site in the Outer Court of the Old College. By 1900, the accommodation was already proving too small, and in 1914 it was decided to build a new wing enclosing the West Quadrangle, providing additional rooms and a Chapel. Interior of the Chapel Construction John James Burnet was commissioned to draw up plans for the extension, and construction began in August 1914 but was halted by World War I. Work resumed in 1923 but was delayed by bad weather and economic conditions, and the buildings were not completed until 1929. The inside was fitted with wooden stalls and carvings by Archibald Dawson, and a series of ten stained glass windows, designed and made by Douglas Strachan and representing the entirety of human life as a spiritual enterprise, was installed in 1931. Amongst subsequent additions was the Benedicite Window, which is above the altar at the East end of the building. It was designed by Lawrence Lee and installed in 1962. Dedication After World War I, it was decided that the new chapel should be dedicated to the memory of those seven hundred and fifty-five men connected with the University who had lost their lives in the conflict. The Principal, Donald MacAlister, said: The Chapel was dedicated to their memory in a service on 4 October 1929, led by the Right Reverend John White. Tablets on the wall behind the Communion Table list the names of those who died, while other tablets besides the stalls record the 405 members of the University community who gave their lives in World War II. Services Daily services are held in the Chapel during term-time, as well as seasonal events. Before Christmas, there is a Service of Nine Lessons and Carols on the last Sunday of term, and a Watchnight service on Christmas Eve. Graduates, students, members of staff and the children of members of staff are entitled to be married in the Chapel, which is also used for baptisms and funerals. Civil marriages and civil partnerships may be blessed in the Chapel, although under UK law may not be performed there. The current Chaplain of the University is the Reverend Stuart MacQuarrie, and the University appoints Honorary Chaplains of other denominations. Organ The Chapel's organ was constructed by Henry Willis & Sons in 1927 and refurbished by Harrison & Harrison in 2005. It was a gift to the University from Joseph Paton Maclay, Lord Maclay, in memory of two of his sons, who had died in the war. The Organist is Kevin Bowyer, an acclaimed performer and prolific recorder, who is Artistic Director of the Glasgow International Organ Festival, which is held in the Chapel and has been running annually since June 2006. Chapel Choir The Chapel Choir sings at services and concerts every Tuesday evening at 6pm during term-time, and at other events in the Chapel, such as the Remembrance Sunday service, Service of Nine Lessons and Carols, and weddings. The Choir is composed of between twenty-eight to thirty-two singers, including students, staff and graduates, and takes SATB form. The Choir has recorded widely and completed a number of tours, including the United States (2002), when it sang at the Sunday morning service in Saint Thomas Church on Fifth Avenue; Germany (1999, 2000, 2004, 2010); the Baltic states (2007); Tuscany (2009); Amsterdam (2012); Sweden (2016); and China (2018). The Director of Chapel Music is Katy Lavinia Cooper, who was appointed in April 2015 after James Grossmith left to become chorusmaster of the Royal Swedish Opera.

Aircraft 864 was lost to ground fire on Christmas Eve of that year with LT Charles J. Loring, Jr. at the controls, and he became a POW. During the Korean War, Loring was posthumously awarded the Medal of Honor. The 36th Pursuit Group (Interceptor) was activated on 1 February 1940 at Langley Field, Virginia. Initial training of the group was with the Curtiss P-36 Hawk. The group was moved to Losey Army Airfield, Puerto Rico in January 1941 where it was equipped with Bell P-39 Airacobras and Curtiss P-40 Warhawks. In Puerto Rico, the 36th served as part of the defense force for the Caribbean area and Panama Canal, and flew antisubmarine patrols. The group was redesignated the 36th Fighter Group in May 1942 and returned to Morrison Army Airfield, Florida where it trained with Republic P-47 Thunderbolts. From 1942 through 1944, the 36th trained at several airfields in the United States before deploying to RAF Kingsnorth, England in April 1944 as part of Ninth Air Force, serving in combat as part of the European theater. With Ninth Air Force, the group operated primarily as a P-47 fighter-bomber organization as part of the 303d Fighter Wing, XIX Tactical Air Command. Operational missions included strafing and dive-bombing armored vehicles, trains, bridges, buildings, factories, troop concentrations, gun emplacements, airfields, and other targets in preparation for the invasion of Normandy. The 36th FG also flew some escort missions with Eighth Air Force Boeing B-17 Flying Fortress and Consolidated B-24 Liberator strategic bombers. The 36th participated in the June 1944 D-Day invasion of France in by patrolling the air over the landing zones and by flying close-support and interdiction missions. The group moved to its Advanced Landing Ground at Brucheville, France (A-16) in July, then eastward as ground forces advanced on the continent. Operations supported the breakthrough at Saint-L√¥ in July and the thrust of U.S. Third Army toward Germany in August and September. The group earned a Distinguished Unit Citation for operations on 1 September 1944 when, in a series of missions, the group attacked German columns south of the Loire in order to disrupt the enemy's retreat across central France to Dijon. In October, the group moved into Belgium to support U.S. Ninth Army. The 36th Fighter Group participated in the Battle of the Bulge during December 1944 and January 1945 by flying armed reconnaissance and close-support missions. Aided U.S. First Army's push across the Roer River in February 1945. Supported operations at the Remagen bridgehead and during the airborne assault across the Rhine in March. The group received a second Distinguished Unit Citation for performance on 12 April 1945 when the group, operating through intense anti-aircraft fire, relentlessly attacked airfields in southern Germany, destroying a large hangar and numerous aircraft. By V-E Day, the group was based at Kassel/Rothwesten airfield, Germany (ALG R-12), where it remained until February 1946 as part of the United States Air Forces in Europe Army of Occupation. In February, the group was transferred, without personnel or equipment to Bolling Field, Washington, D.C where the groups fighter squadrons were inactivated. From its deployment to RAF Kingsnorth into January 1945, Lt. Col. William Lewis Curry served as commanding officer. Lt. Col. Van H. Slayden and Lt. Col Paul P. Douglas Jr. served as commanders through the remaining months through V-E Day.http://www.historyofwar.org/air/units/USAAF/36th_Fighter_Group.htm Caribbean Air Command On 15 October 1946, Headquarters, 36th Fighter Group was transferred to Howard Army Airfield, Panama Canal Zone as part of the Panama Canal defense forces. In Central America, the group conducted air defense training missions for the next two years initially with P-47's. The group upgraded to jet aircraft in December 1947 with the arrival of the Lockheed F-80 Shooting Star. On 2 July 1948, the United States Air Force 36th Fighter Wing was activated at Howard Air Force Base. The former USAAF 36th Fighter Group became the operational component of the new Air Force wing. United States Air Forces in Europe 36th Fighter-Bomber Group F-84E 49-2150 F√ºrstenfeldbruck AB, West Germany, 1950 22d TFS F-105s with French Air Force Dassault Myst√®re B2s from Cambrai Air Base ‚Äì 1964. As a result of the Berlin Blockade and other Cold War tensions in Europe, the 36th Fighter Group was reassigned to USAFE. The squadron was assigned to F√ºrstenfeldbruck Air Base West Germany on 13 August 1948, being the first USAFE unit to be jet- equipped with the Lockheed F-80 \\"Shooting Star\\". At F√ºrstenfeldbruck tactical operations included air defense, tactical exercises, maneuvers, and photographic reconnaissance. In May 1949, the group formed the Skyblazers aerial demonstration team, which it controlled until August 1952, and again from October 1956 to January 1962 when it was disbanded. On 20 January 1950, the group was redesignated as the 36th Fighter-Bomber Group (FBG) when 89 Republic F-84E \\"Thunderjets\\" arrived. Existing USAFE bases in West Germany, however, were deemed very vulnerable to an attack by the Soviet Union, given their proximity to East Germany and other Warsaw Pact nations. Negotiations with other NATO nations were made to build new bases west of the Rhine River. The F-80s were sent back to CONUS to equip Air National Guard units. In addition to its primary installation at F√ºrstenfeldbruck, the wing controlled Oberpfaffenhofen AB, West Germany, December 1949 ‚Äì February 1950. The 36th FBG remained at F√ºrstenfeldbruck until 1952 when it was reassigned to the new Bitburg Air Base, in the Eifel mountains west of the Rhine River. Throughout the summer, elements of the 36th FBG moved into Bitburg, with the Group officially arriving in November 1952. In August 1953, the North American F-86F \\"Sabre\\" was introduced to the group, replacing the F-84s. On 31 March 1954, The 1st Pilotless Bomber Squadron, equipped with the B-61A Matador, was assigned to the 36th Fighter Bomber Group, Bitburg Air Base, Germany, making it the first operational U.S. missile unit. The 1st PBS eventually was renamed to Tactical Missile Squadron (TMS), and in 1958 was renumbered to the 71st TMS and the unit was assigned to the 701st TMW at Hahn, although stationed at Bitburg Air Base. In August 1954, the Group was redesignated as the 36th Fighter-Day Group. In 1956, the group received the North American F-100 \\"Super Sabre,\\" marking the first time a wing in USAFE flew supersonic jets. Group inactivated on 8 December 1957 when parent wing adopted Tri-Deputate organization and assigned operational squadrons directly to the wing. In 1977 the 36th Tactical Fighter Wing was the first wing in Europe to fly the new F-15A and F-15B Eagle air superiority fighters, replacing the F-4E Phantoms of the 525 TFS, the 22 TFS and the 53 TFS. On 1 October 1991 the wing was redesignated as the 36th Fighter Wing when the objective wing concept was implemented. The 36th Operations Group was also activated to control the operational flying squadrons of the Wing. Bitburg Air Base was one of the bases affected by the 1993 Base Realignment and Closure Commission (or BRAC) decisions that saw the drawdown of many military facilities in a series of post-Cold War force reductions. In July 1993, HQ USAFE announced the closure of Bitburg Air Base and the pending inactivation of the 36th Fighter Wing. On 1 October 1994 the 36th Fighter Wing was inactivated along with all subordinate units. Pacific Air Forces The 36th Wing was reactivated without personnel or equipment at Andersen AFB, Guam the same day as the 36th Air Base Wing, a non-flying organization taking over as the host unit. The former host unit, the 633d Air Base Wing, was inactivated in keeping with the Air Force Chief of Staff's policy of keeping the most highly decorated and longest serving Air Force units on active duty. With no aircraft permanently assigned, the 36th Operations Group was not activated, but instead converted to provisional status as the 36th Expeditionary Operations Group. The 36 EOG was under the control of HQ, Pacific Air Forces with a mission to support deployed aircraft to PACAF. It could, and was activated and inactivated as needed by the demands of the mission. The 36th Operations Group was re- established as a permanent unit on 14 February 2007, replacing the temporary structure of the provisional Expeditionary Group for deployed Air Force units assigned to Andersen AFB.

Dusty Miller Dusty Miller was a British prisoner of war (POW) in Thailand conscripted to work on the Burma Railway during the last three and a half years of World War II. His life and death is attested to in Gordon's book. Miller was a gardener from Newcastle and a Methodist. Like Gordon, he was in the Argyll and Sutherland Highlanders, but was drafted into the Military Police or \\"Red Caps\\". He became known to Ernest Gordon during a period early on in their three and a half year incarceration under the Japanese. Gordon was seriously ill, and was attended to by Miller and \\"Dinty\\" Moore, a Roman Catholic POW. In their care, Gordon unexpectedly recovered. Through the examples of Miller and Moore, the recovery of Gordon, and the self-sacrificing examples of numerous others, both faith and hope were restored to many soldiers in the death camps.

History Several small groups split from the Japanese Communist Party (JCP) following the Hungarian Revolution of 1956. They attended a congress in 1957 and agreed to unite as the JRCL. Although Japan had no history of Trotskyist organisations, they affiliated with the International Secretariat of the Fourth International, while also making contact with the U.S. Socialist Workers Party.Robert Jackson Alexander, \\"International Trotskyism, 1929-1985: a documented analysis of the movement\\", pp.599-601 Many of the organisation's founding members were active in the All-Japan Federation of Student Autonomous Associations, and disagreed with the JCP policy forbidding the student group from developing any political lines distinct from the party. The JRCL came to control the student organisation for most of the remainder of its history. Other members initially attempted to work within the JCP, but leading member Kyoji Nishi was expelled in 1958. The following year, the party split, with dissidents including Kuroda Kan'ichi forming the Japan Revolutionary Communist League National Committee.Introduction to Japan Revolutionary Communist League The remainder of the party instead attempted entrism within the Japan Socialist Party. This continued until 1968, when the group re-established itself openly, after it had gained members during anti-Vietnam War protests. It remained part of the international Trotskyist movement, becoming part of the Fourth International (FI). The party increasingly turned to work in the trade unions, with some success. In 1991, it was demoted to sympathiser status within the FI.

It was released worldwide for iPhone OS on March 15, 2009, and was later released for Android and Blackberry on March 2, 2010, Symbian on May 1, 2010, and Windows Phone 7 on June 1, 2011 (Re-Released August 21, 2013 Windows Phone 8). It was released for the iPad on September 1, 2011. Since its release, the game has been generally well received. The game is currently available on nine platforms. Doodle Jump was renowned for its selling rate by App Store standards, which counted 25,000 copies sold daily for 4 consecutive months (later overtaken by Angry Birds). As of December, 2011, the game sold 10 million copies over iTunes and Google Play and reached 15 million downloads across all platforms. The game has been developed into a video redemption game for play at video arcades. Croats Igor and Marko Pu≈°enjak are authors of Doodle Jump, where Igor works from a New York-based address and Marko resides in Croatia.https://www.fastcompany.com/3018728/14-igor-pusenjak In July 2016, Lima Sky announced partnership with Skillz to develop a tournament-playable version of the game. Gameplay An in-game screenshot of Doodle Jump on 'Space' mode. In Doodle Jump, the aim is to guide a four-legged creature called \\"The Doodler\\" up a never-ending series of platforms without falling. The left side of the playing field is connected with the right side. For devices with an accelerometer, players tilt the device from side to side to move the Doodler in the desired direction. Players can get a short boost from various objects, such as propeller hats, jetpacks, rockets, springs, trampolines and invulnerability shields (some levels only). There are also monsters and UFOs that the Doodler must avoid, shoot, or jump on to eliminate. Aiming is performed by tapping on different parts of the screen, on the Android and Windows Phone versions of the game there is also an automatic aim mode. Depending on the game mode being played, projectiles may fly in a straight line off the screen or be affected by gravity and fall downwards. There is no definitive end to the game, but the end for each gameplay session happens when the player falls to the bottom of the screen, jumps into a monster, gets sucked into a black hole, or is abducted by a UFO. Players can choose from several different themes including Original, Christmas, Halloween, Rainforest, Space, Soccer World Cup, Underwater, Easter, Ice Blizzard, Retro Arcade, Ninja or Pirate. The themes change the look of the Doodle Jumper, his enemies, and the background. In the Ninja, Pirate, Halloween, and Easter modes, the player can buy new skins and extra lives with coins that can be earned in gameplay but may also be purchased. Furthermore, the player may enter the names of one of the Pocket God pygmies and the Doodler will turn into one of pygmies. Alternatively, the player can enter the name \\"Bunny\\" and the Doodler will wear a bunny suit, just like the one in the Easter stage. There are also two other separate apps for iPhone OS, Doodle Jump Christmas Special (a new Christmas theme) and Doodle Jump Hop, (a new Easter theme) where the player character is E.B. from the movie Hop. A free version also exists. This version is nearly identical to the original, but features such as UFOs are not present, advertisements are shown and there is a limit to how high the Doodler goes. Reception Doodle Jump has received favorable reviews from critics, with TouchGen mentioning the fact that the game is 'fun as heck' and also praising the sound and cartoon graphics which they feel give the game charm. The review ends by saying that the game is a 'joy to play' and that it's obvious that a 'lot of love went into this game'. Tom Love of Pocket Gamer called the game \\"unbelievably addictive, immediately accessible, and enjoyable every time you pick it up\\". It currently holds a rating of 85.00% based on 6 reviews on GameRankings. Cultural references * The Doodler has made cameo appearances in several other iPhone games, such as Parachute Panic, The Creeps, Finger Physics and Pocket God, just like the Pocket God Pygmies are playable in Doodle Jump. * In The Big Bang Theory episode \\"The Adhesive Duck Deficiency\\", Sheldon Cooper makes a reference to Doodle Jump when he sees someone playing the game in a hospital. It is also referenced in the episode \\"The Zarnecki Incursion\\", in which Sheldon is offended when Penny refers to World of Warcraft as a \\"game\\", prompting Cooper to retort, \\"Doodle Jump is a game; Angry Birds is a game; World of Warcraft is a massively multiplayer online role-playing... technically it's a game\\". * In 2012, the company Sprint ran a commercial featuring Kevin Durant that implies a viewer missing a sport game's winning shot because they had used up all their data plan quota by downloading Doodle Jump. * In \\"Sex Education\\", the October 18, 2012 episode of the television sitcom Parks and Recreation, Tom Haverford explains his Internet addiction by saying that he would rather play Doodle Jump because of the emptiness in his life. * In National Geographic's Animal Jam, there is a mini-game called \\"Sky High\\" that is an obvious parody of Doodle Jump; however the Doodle Jumper is replaced with the player's animal avatar, the monsters are replaced with Phantoms and the platforms are clouds.

Platou was the country's first woman to be elected Member of Parliament. She was born in Mandal, Vest-Agder, the daughter of treasurer Otto Michael Stoud Platou (1852 - 1903) and Ida Nanna Amalie R√¶der (1852 - 1903). Among the many prominent members of her family were her uncle Christian Emil Stoud Platou, rail road director and Conservative politician, and another uncle Waldemar Stoud Platou, brewer and businessman. She grew up in Kristiania - today called Oslo - and received her education here and in Hanover, Germany. After finishing her education she started working as an architect, and also got involved in organisational and political work. From 1919 Platou had been a deputy representative in the Norwegian Parliament - Stortinget - for the Conservative Party. In the 1921 election, she was elected Member of Parliament for the constituency of Kristiania, as the first woman in the country. The 1921 election was the first Norwegian election with proportional representation, which probably helped the chance of a woman being elected. Her first speech in Parliament was a criticism of then Prime Minister Otto Blehr's assertion that chocolate was a luxury commodity. Platou believed it was an important part of children's diet. She was elected out of office after her first term was up, but continued for another term as deputy representative. In 1930 she established her own publishing business. During World War II, Platou worked actively for the resistance movement, until she was exposed and had to flee to Sweden in 1942. Platou died in 1950; she was never married.

She was the country's first female Member of Parliament. A teacher by profession, Rogstad was deeply involved in the educational policies of the nation. She also fought for women's rights, particularly the right to vote. In 1911 she met in parliament as a deputy representative for Jens Bratlie, and held this position full-time after Bratlie became Prime Minister in 1912. Early life and career Rogstad was born at Nordre Land to legal clerk Ole Rogstad (1805-1876) and Anne Cathrine M√∏ller (b. 1807). Anna started teaching in primary school in 1873 in Trondheim. Four years later she moved to Kristiania - today's Oslo - where she worked at various locations before settling in Gr√ºnerl√∏kka, where she stayed for thirty years.Moksnes, Aslaug (1984) (in Norwegian) Likestilling eller s√¶rstilling? Oslo: Gyldendal While living in Kristiania, Rogstad became involved in issues of women's education and worked to strengthen the education of girls. In 1889 she became president of the Kristiania female teachers' organization, which she changed from a social club to a trade union. Initially she advocated the creation of a separate teaching academy for women, but during the 1880s she changed her position to favour admitting women to the all-male teaching academy, which became policy in 1890. She was also active in the Norwegian Teachers' Union, where she served as vice president in the period from 1892 to 1907. When the Norwegian Association of Female Teachers was created in 1912, Rogstad was the president until 1919. In 1899 she started a secondary school for girls, with voluntary evening classes for twenty-five students. The school became popular, and in 1909 the city took over. Rogstad remained the school's principal until she retired in 1923, at the age of sixty-nine. Anna Rogstad was among the founders of the Norwegian Women's Rights Association in 1884 and the Association for Women's Suffrage in 1885. She was vice president of the Association for Women's Suffrage during 1885-97 and 1902-13. In Kristiania she represented the female teachers in the municipal school board from 1894 to 1916. She was elected deputy representative of the Association for Women's Suffrage to the city council in 1901, representative of the city council of a group of three center-right parties in 1907 and deputy representative to the city council for the Liberal Left Party in 1910. Parliamentary career Rogstad was a member of the Liberal Left Party of Norway. An electoral reform in 1907 gave voting rights to women who could show a certain level of economic affluence. Even though universal suffrage was not introduced until 1913, this reform also allowed women to be elected for political office. In 1911 Rogstad became the first woman in Norwegian history to sit in Parliament (Stortinget), as a deputy representative of Jens Bratlie. The event was met with great public attention, and people who could not fit into the viewing galleries gathered outside the Parliament building. The President of the assembly, Johan Magnus Halvorsen, said in a special address that, even though there had been much debate over the reforms, he was convinced that the outcome would be favourable for the nation. Rogstad held her first speech on the floor of the Parliament after only five days, when she argued for a cut in the defence budget, because she believed that all conflicts should be solved by arbitration. She also got involved in debates over gender equality, education, culture and temperance. When Bratlie became Prime Minister in 1912, Rogstad held his seat full-time for a year. Rogstad was also an author, and wrote fifteen textbooks for the Norwegian school. The best known was her 1893 ABC for skole og hjem (ABC for School and Home). She wrote numerous articles in newspapers and magazines, mostly on the issue of educational policies. As a public speaker she was described as dry, and not particularly engaging, but she nevertheless kept her audience's attention with her matter-of-factly, well-reasoned arguments. Rogstad died in 1938; she was never married.

One of Knowbility's best known programs is its Accessibility Internet Rally, a web-building competition that brings together volunteer web designers and nonprofits. History The seeds of Knowbility began in 1998 with a group of individuals in Austin, Texas representing various businesses and nonprofits, who felt that there was a broad lack of knowledge and skills among website designers and information technology developers about how to create web sites that are accessible to people with sight impairments, hearing impairments, or other disabilities. That same year, the US Congress enacted Section 508, an amendment to the Rehabilitation Act of 1973, requiring federal agencies to make their electronic and information technology accessible to people with disabilities. The group in Austin created the Accessibility Internet Rally, a program produced by the Metropolitan Austin Interactive Network (MAIN), the Central Texas chapter of the National Easter Seals Society, and Goodwill Industries of Austin, with assistance from the virtual volunteering Project. It was held in September 1998 at the Infotec Training Center in Austin, Texas. The first AIR program was created in the style of MAIN's \\"web-raisings\\", where volunteers came together in one facility using multiple computers with Internet access and built web sites for nonprofit organizations in one day. The AIR program was different in that it was a competition, with web sites judged based on both their visual appeal, usefulness and accessibility. Each competing team was composed of one or two representatives of an Austin area nonprofit and four to six volunteer web developers. Altogether, more than 120 people were part of competing teams, representing 40 different not-for-profit, public sector and technology companies. The program proved so successful that organizers decided to create a nonprofit that would not only make AIR an annual event in Austin, but would also create other programs and training for a national audience to promote accessibility in information technology. National profile In 1999, in addition to hosting another AIR-Austin, Knowbility staff and volunteers developed an Accessible Web Page Design Curriculum that was freely distributed on its web site. By 2000, Knowbility had achieved a national profile: Knowbility was mentioned on an episode of The Oprah Winfrey Show in 2000 dealing with technology issues. On September 21, 2000, the White House issued a press release to highlight programs across the country helping to bridge the digital divide for people with disabilities; the Rocky Mountain AIR program was mentioned by President Bill Clinton as a noteworthy initiative. AIR was one of three programs selected for recognition by the Drucker Foundation in October 2000. That same year, Knowbility received an awarded for Notable Achievement in the public service category of the Texas Interactive Media Awards. Also in 2000, Knowbility Board Chair Steve Guengerich and intern Josh Blakeley were featured guests of a panel discussion in Washington DC. at a National Labor Summit, where AIR activities were highlighted as a \\"best practice\\" in contributing to the employment of people with disabilities. Knowbility was invited to ensure accessibility of the \\"ATSTAR\\" initiative. ATSTAR is an acronym that stands for \\"Assistive Technology ‚Äì Strategies, Tools, Accommodations, and Resources.\\" It is a series of computer based teacher training modules to help teachers, administrators and parents understand the legal requirements and the best practices for assessing student need for assistive technology and implementing it in the classroom. The Texas Education Agency, through their Technology Integration in Education (TIE) grant, awarded a grant to the Austin Independent School District (AISD) to fund the development of ATSTAR. Also collaborating on the initiative was Austin Community College, The University of Texas at Austin, Austin Harvard School, Sylvan Learning Center, Far South Community Schools, and Region XIII Education Service Center. Knowbility managed the accessibility of the multi- media interface. The project produced a replicable CD and web-based assistive technology training model designed to prepare instructional staff at the campus level to conduct assessments, collect data, and integrate assistive technology into the instructional setting. As the project was completed, Knowbility assumed management of the program and ATSTAR is now being used by the Georgia Project for Assistive Technology and many other educators and teachers in training. ATSTAR won recognition for outstanding community collaboration from the Texas State Legislature in May 2002. In April 2001, the San Francisico Women on the Web (SF WoW) recognized Knowbility Executive Director Sharron Rush as one of their Top 25 Women of the Web for her work to raise awareness of the need and the societal benefits of greater Internet accessibility. The next year, Rush received the Dewey Winburne Community Service Award at the SXSW Interactive Media Conference, largely because of her work with Knowbility. In 2002, Knowbility founder and executive director Sharron Rush, along with long-time Knowbility volunteer and trainer John M. Slatin, finished the book Maximum Accessibility: Making Your Web Site More Usable for Everyone, published by Addison-Wesley. In 2003, Knowbility received the TEC Champion Award for Outstanding Technology Leadership from the Washington DC based Education Technology Think Tank and CTCNet. Sharron Rush has served since 2007 as an invited expert to the Education and Outreach Working Group (EOWG) of the Web Accessibility Initiative (WAI) of the W3C. Since May 2009, she also serves as liaison from WAI to the e-Government Interest Group as it develops standards and best practices for using the Web to improve government accountability and transparency. Programs AIR continues annually in Austin, since 2002 in conjunction with SXSW. An AIR event is also hosted at St. Edward's University, and AIR events have been conducted in Atlanta, Dallas, Denver, Houston, San Antonio and San Francisco. Volunteer teams have included employees of various corporations and businesses, including IBM, IntelliQuest, and Dell, and government agencies, such as Texas Parks and Wildlife, the Texas State Library & Archives and the City of Austin, as well as individual volunteers forming teams independently. The ATSTAR program continues to train schools and community technology projects in techniques to include students with disabilities in learning activities related to computer technology. Knowbility provides a variety of programs featuring basic and advanced training in accessible web design techniques, and is often consulted by companies and government agencies seeking to comply with state, federal, and global mandates for accessibility. Knowbility also produces three-day accessibility training institutes in Texas and California. Since 2003, Knowbility has produced The John Slatin Access U, in partnership with St. Edward's University in Austin each May. In 2005, the Pacific DBTAC, the regional Disability Business Technical Assistance Center, invited Knowbility to replicate this training on the West Coast. The first California Web Accessibility Conference (CalWAC) was produced that year and, the following year, the Chancellor's Office of the California State University System offered to host CalWAC; the training institute was held at CSU Long Beach in 2006 through 2009. Knowbility was an original and ardent promoter of Bobby, a free online tool provided by the Centre for Applied Special Technology (CAST) used to validate websites for WAI and Section 508 compliance. Structure Knowbility has one main office in Austin, Texas. As of August 2009, there are 17 full-time paid staff members. The number of part- time paid staff members, consultants and volunteers varies from month-to- month, depending on what activities Knowbility is undertaking at that time. Knowbility is governed by a board of directors, with most of its members based in Austin, Texas.

It is located in a parkland setting in √òstre Anl√¶g, near the Danish National Gallery, and houses a large collection of Danish art from the 19th and early 20th century. The emphasis is on the Danish Golden Age, from 1800 to 1850, but also the Skagen Painters and other representatives of the Modern Breakthrough are well represented. The museum is built around the personal art collection of Heinrich Hirschsprung, a tobacco manufacturer and patron of the arts who founded his art collection in 1865. Almost four decades later, in 1902, he donated it to the Danish state. It is displayed in a purpose-built Neoclassical museum building designed by Hermann Baag√∏e Storck and completed in 1911. History Heinrich Hirschsprung, the founder of the museum, painted by his friend Peder Severin Kr√∏yer in 1899 The collection Heinrich Hirschsprung was a tobacco manufacturer at A.M. Hirschsprung & S√∏nner. He was married to Pauline Hirschsprung, and the couple took a profound interest in the arts and counted many prominent artists of their day among their close friends, including the writer Holger Drachmann and the painter Peder Severin Kr√∏yer, both associated with the Skagen colony. Over a period of four decades, beginning in 1866, Hirschsprung built an extensive collection of Danish art from the beginning of the 18th century and up to their own day. The collection was shown to the public for the first time in 1888 at Charlottenborg. This happened in connection with the Nordic exhibition of Industry, Agriculture, and Art which was expected to draw many foreign visitors to Copenhagen. The exhibition catalogue included 313 items, representing some 60 Danish artists. About half were paintings while the rest were drawings, watercolours, pastels and some sculptures. Planning of the museum The Hirschsprung family, by Peder Severin Kr√∏yer In 1900, Pauline and Heinrich Hirschsprung decided to donate their art collection to the Danish state. They had a deed of gift drawn up, which was deposited with the Danish Ministry of Cultural Affairs. However, the donation was not made public until two years later, in 1902, when the collection was once again exhibited at Charlottenborg. At the same event, the art historian Emil Hannover was put in charge of cataloging the collection. The exhibition at Charlottenborg also included renderings of the planned museum building, which had been designed by the architect Hermann Baag√∏e Storck. Disliking the Historicist style which dominated museum architecture in Copenhagen at the time, it was of critical importance to Hirschsprung that the collection be placed in an independent building built to a more \\"sober\\" design. He wanted the museum to stand on the ground left open by the now demolished ramparts around Copenhagen, where a number of new museum buildings, including the recently inaugurated National Gallery from 1899, had been constructed towards the turn of the century. Under the terms of the deed of gift, the Danish state and the City of Copenhagen, on their side, were required to make a site and a building available for its exhibition. This scheme was similar to the one which had been agreed upon in connection with Carl Jacobsen's foundation of the Ny Carlsberg Glyptotek. Still Hirschsprung's demand for an independent building gave rise to a political debate on arts politics which went on for several years and put the plans on hold. Wilhelm Bendz's Interior from Amaliegade with the Artist's Brothers from c. 1829 was acquired by Hirschsprung in 1901 but only came into the collection in 1915 after the vendor's death While discussions were going on, Hirschsprung continued to build the collection with acquisitions such as Joakim Skovgaard's cartoons for the decoration of Viborg Cathedral and a number of works by contemporary artists such as Michael and Anna Ancher and Vilhelm Hammersh√∏i from the art collector Alfred Bramsen's Collection. A number of private individuals also promised to donate works to the collection once it passed into public ownership while others were purchased by Hirschsprung conditional on the same event. To make the collection into a representative display of 19th-century Danish art, Hirschsprung also started to add sculptures to his holdings, using the sculptor and family friend Ludvig Brandstrup as an adviser. In less than a year, Hirschsprung managed to collect the great majority of the 180 sculptures included in the 1902 catalogue. The collection represents 20 Danish sculptors. Construction and opening 1907 finally saw a successful conclusion to negotiations and a start could be made on building Storck's project from 1902. The site which was ultimately chosen was in √òstre Anl√¶g, a park which had been laid out on the grounds of the city's former fortifications and where also the National Gallery had been built. Heinrich Hirschsprung died the following year, in 1908, and thus never saw his museum materialize. Emil Hannover, the art historian who had catalogued the collection, was charged with the interior design of the museum as well as curating the exhibition. He hung the paintings in chronological order, in the spirit of Hirschsprung. The Hirschsprung Collection opened to the public in 1911. Pauline Hirschsprung was present at the official opening on 8 July, but died the following year. Building The large gallery The museum building is a simple neoclassical building with a light marble cladding and a facade with pediments and Doric pilasters. The floor plan consists of four large toplit galleries surrounded by smaller galleries, \\"alcoves\\", with light entering from windows set high in the walls. While the building from the outside has the appearance of a temple of art, the interior, with its small rooms, has the intimacy of a private home. The entrance hall to the museum has a floor mosaic from 1910 by Joakim Skovgaard in which stylised tobacco plants commemorate the founder of the museum. Collections Danish Golden Age The museum exhibits more than 700 works of art. The emphasis is on the Golden Age of Danish Painting. All the major painters of the period are represented, including C. W. Eckersberg, Christen K√∏bke, Constantin Hansen, Wilhelm Marstrand and Martinus R√∏rbye, as well as many lesser known names.

This includes: * Skagen Painters such as P. S. Kr√∏yer and Michael and Anna Ancher * Theodor Philipsen, Denmark's foremost representative of Impressionism * Symbolisterne, The Danish Symbolist movement * Fynboerne, natives of Funen, a group of artists from Funen who met at Kristian Zahrtmann's independent art school in the 1880s.

Early life Young Garesche, as he was known to his parents, was the youngest surviving son of 15 children and born in Michigan in 1866. His father, the then Captain Edward Otho Cresap Ord (October 18, 1818 Maryland ‚Äì July 22, 1883 in Havana, Cuba and buried on July 22, 1898 in Arlington Cemetery), married Mary Mercer Thompson (January 22, 1831 Virginia ‚Äì July 15, 1894 San Antonio, Texas) on October 14, 1854. His father was a career military officer who was a hero in the Civil War and had served as a Major General of Volunteers. After the war, he reverted to being a Brigadier General in the Regular Army. On August 2, 1870 the family was in San Francisco, California with seven children. Young Garesche lived with servants and was taught by tutors. His life in the west was one of which his father was a senior military officer, a decorated Civil War hero and he was doted upon by his mother. His life was privileged compared to others.

His father began a second career that built the Mexican Southern Railroad from Texas to Mexico City. The family stayed in San Antonio. Garesche became known as \\"Gary\\", got into some minor trouble and struggled with school. In July 1883 his father died in Havana, Cuba of yellow fever while en route from Vera Cruz, Mexico to New York City. The family went back to Washington, D.C. for the funeral and an extended visit.

He took and passed a two-day exam in which he received a commission to Second Lieutenant with the 18th United States Infantry effective on November 6, 1890.

He volunteered for duty in the 1898 Spanish‚ÄìAmerican War and was sent there with the 6th Infantry Regiment avoiding recruitment duty stateside. Ord then became a brigade staff officer (aide-de-camp) under Brigadier General Hamilton S. Hawkins who then commanded the 1st Brigade, 1st Division, V Corps in Cuba. Due to disease and other casualties many staff officers were directed to serve with the line units. Ord, wanting to be \\"in the action\\" asked to be sent to D Troop of the \\"negro\\" 10th U.S. Cavalry where a family friend was in command, John Bigelow, Jr. whose diplomat father John Bigelow was a close friend with Ord's father General Otho Cresap Ord. John Bigelow had once dated Ord's elder sister Roberta (Bertie) and despite encouragements from both families the relationship waned. Before his final battle during a lull, Ord told Bigelow that he would come out of this battle either as a \\"colonel or a corpse.\\" Battle of San Juan Hill The San Juan Heights with San Juan Hill and its main blockhouses were the highest point with a dip or draw in between another smaller hill later called Kettle Hill. These heights were aligned in a north- south axis and located about a mile east of Santiago. They were the last major obstacle before the Americans. Myths of the battle The Rough Riders under Colonel Theodore Roosevelt would claim to have taken Kettle Hill on the American right with assistance from several troops of the \\"black\\" 10th Cavalry and the entire 3rd Cavalry (\\"white\\" volunteers). The reality was that \\"the regulars\\" were supported by the 3rd & Roosevelt's 1st in taking the hill. Most of the 10th supported by elements of the 24th and 25th colored infantry on the left would take San Juan Hill, which was the main Spanish defensive position with several block houses. The 10th held the center position between the two hills and when they went forward the command would be split headed toward the tops of both hills. Roosevelt claimed he started the charge on the right up Kettle Hill, but in reality he supported \\"the regulars\\" in the charge up the hill after being asked to by Lt. Ord. When the Spanish soldiers withdrew from Kettle Hill toward San Juan Hill, which was still being contested, the regulars (the black troops) fired toward them. They did this in support of their comrades fighting on the adjacent hill. When Roosevelt tried to direct his volunteers down and across the steep draw to San Juan Hill, his men balked. Later came the myth that \\"the regulars\\" would not obey Roosevelt and caused a delay in taking San Juan Hill. Another so called myth stated that the Rough Riders alone took the Kettle Hill. This is not true. Sergeant George Berry of the 10th took his regimental colors and that of the 3rd Cavalry's colors to the top of Kettle Hill before the Rough Riders' flag arrived. This is supported in the writings of John J. \\"Black Jack\\" Pershing who fought with the 10th to the top of Kettle Hill and was present when Roosevelt arrived. Later Roosevelt would lead some of his men down and around toward the main heights. He was intercepted by General Summers and ordered back to Kettle Hill to prepare for a counterattack by the Spanish. When the counterattack came, those men he led were exhausted from the heat. The main attack 10th Regiment United States Cavalry insignia On July 1, 1898, the commander of D Troop, 10th Cavalry, Captain Bigelow was in a quandary like many of the officers that waited below the San Juan Heights. His troops had been the first to arrive on line and had been receiving fire from the Heights that was fortified by the Spanish defenders. Other American units went into position on the left and the right. But still no orders to advance came. Bigelow's temporary second in command was First Lieutenant Ord of the 6th Infantry Regiment and then detailed to the staff of General Hawkins as his \\"aide-de- camp\\". Ord had volunteered for line duty when too many officers fell ill. Ord chose to be with Bigelow, who was a family friend. Because of his connection, Ord volunteered and went to Brigadier General Hamilton S. Hawkins seeking permission to attack. > ‚Äî I sent Jules to General Hawkins to entreatie for an attack. He asked > \\"General, if you will order a charge, I will lead it.\\" No doubt the old > General remembered (the) costly charges against the entrenched enemy during > the last war. And maybe hesitated at that memory. Jules then declared, \\"If > you do not wish to order a charge, General, I should like to volunteer.\\" > Then after another pause he pleaded, \\"May I volunteer? We can't stay here, > can we?\\" \\"I would not ask any man to volunteer.\\" was the reply. \\"If you do > not forbid it, I will start it,\\" answered Jules. The General turned toward > the Heights as if deciding Jules fate. He stated the brigades were not all > on line. General Hawkins told me that he had a terrible feeling as he looked > upon Jules, but Jules firmly stated, \\"I only ask you not to refuse > permission.\\" The reply was, \\"I will not ask for volunteers, I will not give > permission and I will not refuse it.\\" Jules saluted smartly with a broad > smile. As Jules left the old General called out, \\"God bless you and good > luck!\\"... The General told me that he knew the fight was going to be costly, > but that Jules had taken a weight off his shoulders. > ‚Äî ::::::::::::Captain John Bigelow, Jr., 10th U.S. Cavalry, D Troop in a > letter home. Ord went forward and encouraged other officers to support the regulars when they charged. When he reached D Troop, he was out-of-breath, but with a wide grin. He reported to Bigelow what had happened and that other units on the right were going to support a charge. He asked his friend for permission to give the command. It was granted. Ord then drew his revolver and his sword. Then with eyes upon him he stood and yelled, \\"Forward!\\" With a determined step he went up the hill. The black Buffalo soldiers of the 10th then rose from where they had been hiding from the Spanish fire and began a stride toward the steep heights. Ord advanced through blistering fire and was heard to yell, \\"Come on‚Äîcome on, you fellows! Come on‚Äîwe can't stop now.\\" Buffalo Soldiers who participated in the Spanish‚ÄìAmerican War at San Juan Hill. About 150 yards from the top the men began a maniacal rush toward the top. Bigelow was hit but continued to urge his men forward. He was then hit in quick succession by three Spanish bullets which caused him to fall. Several soldiers present reported that he encouraged them with, \\"Men, don't stop for me, just keep up the charge until you get to the top of the hill.\\" His men did so and were able to take the main block house and provided covering fire for those attacking adjacent to them. Ord was reportedly the first officer to reach the top and began directing supporting fire when he was hit in the throat, mortally wounded. He dropped his pistol and sword and sat down grasping his neck. Corporal Walker of D Troop killed his officer's assailant, then tried to help Ord. Walker stated that Ord had made a statement before he bled to death. The essence was that if the 10th had not been separated by the draw between the two hills, they would have taken the heights already. Ord was then buried on the hill. Black First Sergeant Givens then took command of D Troop on San Juan Hill and held his position until relieved. Major \\"Black Jack\\" Pershing, recent regimental quartermaster, who had charged up Kettle Hill, was given temporary command of D Troop after the fighting ceased. Later Lieutenant A.E. Kennington would command D Troop. On that one day and one place, one half of the 10th's officers and one-fifth of its soldiers became casualties. Aftermath Obiturary of Lt. Jules G. Ord from Galveston Daily News, Galveston, Texas July 4, 1898. Lieutenant Gary Ord did not receive recognition for his actions on San Juan Hill. The Army quietly turned down the requests for a medal for his heroism from his commanding officer and his commanding general. Partly the reason given was that he was listed as a member of the 6th Cavalry on roster reports and was also listed as an aide to his General. Tragically, his father General E.O.C. Ord died in Havana, Cuba of yellow fever in 1883. Both men were laid to final rest at Arlington National Cemetery in section 2 with others of their family. His brother, then Captain Edward Otho Cresap Ord, II (November 9, 1858 ‚Äì April 4, 1923) then of the 22nd Infantry Regiment fought at Santiago July 3 to July 17, 1898. He too would suffer from yellow fever and its second phase. He would live but require a long sabbatical from military service. Colonel Theodore Roosevelt of the 1st United States Volunteer Cavalry was claimed, mostly by the press, to have started the charge up San Juan Heights, even though he went up only the small hill later called Kettle Hill. \\"Teddy\\" was nominated for the redesigned Medal of Honor and when the US Army investigated the claim, they denied the medal. For other reasons, the Medal of Honor was awarded posthumously in 2001 to Roosevelt. There was no mention of Lt. Jules G. Ord or 10th Cavalry Regiment.Brands, H.W. ed.

A constituent institute of the School of Advanced Study based on the second floor of the Senate House, the Institute of Modern Languages Research promotes and facilitates national and international collaborative, cross-disciplinary and cross-cultural research by means of seminars, lectures, workshops, colloquia, conferences, a fellowships programme, and its various research centres.  History  The Institute of Germanic Studies was founded in 1950 to promote and facilitate the study of German-speaking cultures. It was joined in 1989 by the Institute of Romance Studies, which was founded to promote and facilitate the study of Romance language-speaking cultures. The two Institutes were merged in 2004 to form the new Institute of Germanic & Romance Studies. It became the Institute of Modern Languages Research in 2013, when its Euro-centric focus began broadening significantly to encompass the study of all languages currently spoken around the world. The Institute has since also come to engage directly in emerging interlingual and inter-disciplinary topics such as translingualism and translation.  Degrees  As well as offering doctoral supervision, and co- supervision as a member of the London Arts & Humanities Partnership (LAHP), the Institute currently offers a Masters by Research postgraduate degree MRes in Modern Languages. Research degrees are offered in the modern languages, broadly conceived. The Institute has significant expertise, archival strengths and student funding in its historical focus: * Germanic Studies (German language, literature and cultural studies) * Romance Studies (French, Italian, Spanish and Portuguese language, literature and cultural studies) * Comparative and Interdisciplinary studies (The City-especially Berlin or Trieste, The virtual or imagined city, Borders, The body, Psychoanalysis, German philosophy and history of ideas, Women's writing, Jewish writing, Exile writing, Children's literature and Feminism). However, along with the new, broader remit of the Institute, the range and fluidity of its expertise have also increased significantly in recent years.  Affiliated Research Centres  Several research centres are affiliated with the institute, including * Centre for the Study of Cultural Memory * Centre for the Study of Contemporary Women's Writing * Ingeborg Bachmann Centre for Austrian Literature * Research Centre for German and Austrian Exile Studies * Centre for Quebec and French- Canadian Studies * Ernst Bloch Centre for German Thought  Events and activities  The Institute organises and hosts a large number of events around the year, promoting and facilitating research into a very broad range of Modern Languages topics. The vast majority of these events are free of charge and open to everyone, from scholars and students of London colleges and universities, to interested members of the public. These events draw leading scholars in Modern Languages topics from around the UK and world to London to share their findings.  Fellowships  The Institute is also host to a large number of stipendiary and non-stipendiary fellowships, which allow leaders in Modern Languages research fields at various stages of their careers to spend time at the Institute, undertaking advanced research production, promotion, and facilitation activities.

It originates from the early Cretaceous (144-132 MYA) and features shale partings and colour variations which range from white to beige and pink. Donnybrook stone is used as dimension stone in the building industry and is both a commercial name as well as a stratigraphic name. Many public and private buildings in Western Australia feature Donnybrook stone. These include the facade and portico to the Parliament House building in West Perth, the General Post Office in Perth, the entry portal to the Fremantle Railway Station and the Police Courts building in Beaufort Street, Perth, the latter of which is constructed entirely of Donnybrook stone. History Gold was found in Donnybrook in the mid-1890s and was being mined there in late 1898. There was controversy regarding its usage in the early twentieth century. There were up to eight quarries producing Donnybrook stone in and around the town in the 1930s. Most of these have since closed, however, in 1981 the Goldfields Quarry on the Upper Capel Road re-opened and now produces material for floor tiles and facing slabs.

The name ‚ÄúKhyber‚Äù commemorates the caf√© owned and operated by the Nasr family in the old \\"The Khyber Building\\" at 1588 Barrington St., named for the Khyber Pass, a mountain pass that connects Afghanistan and Pakistan.  Mandate  The Khyber‚Äôs mandate is to present contemporary visual art, which exists in a wide variety of disciplines. We challenge traditional gallery conventions, encourage public understanding and appreciation of contemporary art through responsive and relevant programming. The Khyber works to prioritize, centre and promote the presentation of work by emerging local, national and/or international artists. Additionally, we aim to recognize and disrupt systemic forms of oppression, which include but are not limited to: racism, white supremacy, sexism, heterosexism, cissexism/transmisogyny, tokenism, ableism, ageism, sizeism, sexualized and all acts of violence and harassment. This will be implemented through anti-oppressive policy and practices through Khyber programming, operating and in relation to staff, Board members and artists presented. The Khyber provides a physical and flexible space for the support of socially-engaged Primary and Membership programming, as well as cultivating relationships with a variety of arts communities that engage in artistic research, experimentation, production, education and distribution.  History  In 1994, The Khyber Building was operated as an arts facility by a group of artists previously known as the No Money Down Cultural Society. They led a widespread and collaborative community campaign to ensure continued public access to \\"The Khyber Building\\" which was at risk of closer. In March 1995, the Khyber Arts Society was established to operate The Khyber Centre for the Arts, a Canadian artist-run centre. In 1997, the Society signed a lease to occupy the Khyber Building. In 1998, the Khyber Club opened as a meeting place for visual artists and as an important venue for Halifax's emerging music scene including acts by now well established Canadian recording artists Joel Plaskett, Jenn Grant, Old Man Luedecke and Buck 65.

Heron Jones succeeded to the baronetcy becoming Viscount Ranelagh and Baron Jones of Navan in 1820 on the death of his father.Edmund Lodge, The genealogy of the existing British peerage: with brief sketches of the family histories of the nobility, Saunders and Otley, 1832, p.301 Volunteer movement Ranelagh was an enthusiastic supporter of the movement to create a volunteer army, which had arisen from fears of a French invasion. He created and commanded the 2nd South Middlesex Rifle Volunteers in 1859, the nucleus of which was formed from members of the Ranelagh Yacht Club. Ranelagh became a de facto leader of the Volunteer movement and was introduced as such to the French emperor Napoleon III. In 1863 Ranelagh helped to organise a show of force in Brighton at which he gave a speech defending the movement from attempts by the government to take control of it. He insisted that an independent volunteer militia was both cheaper and more effective for the country than a centrally organised force. He asserted that the English character prefers independence and distrusts \\"organisation\\", claiming that \\"we trust to our own pluck, that indomitable pluck that all Englishmen possess\\".LORD RANELAGH WITH THE EMPEROR OF THE FRENCH, Otago Witness, 7 Feb 1863. At this period Ranelagh was calling for a volunteer \\"people's army\\", an aspiration supported by a section of the press at the time.Ian Frederick William Beckett, The amateur military tradition, 1558‚Äì1945, Manchester University Press ND, 1991, p.181-2. He continued to command the Volunteers until his death in 1885. Relationships Vanity Fair. Ranelagh started a relationship with Annie Miller when her fianc√© William Holman Hunt was away in the Middle East. He was described in the letters of Hunt and his friends as a \\"notorious rake\\" because of his womanising. When Hunt learned of the relationship he broke off the engagement, leading to a meeting between Annie and Ranelagh in which he suggested that she should sue Hunt for breach of promise. In the end, she married Ranelagh's cousin.Anne Clark Armor, William Holman Hunt, Constable, p.178. Ranelagh was also responsible for introducing Lillie Langtry to London high society. According to Langtry herself \\"he completely changed the current of my life\\".Lillie Langtry, The Days I Knew, p.35. She became the centre of attention at a party to which he invited her, and was asked by both John Everett Millais and Frank Miles to sit for a portrait. With his partner, Ranelagh had two daughters and a son Arthur Jones who inherited his estate but being illegitimate could not inherit his fathers titles. The titles of Viscount Ranelagh and Baron Jones of Navan became extinct upon his death in 1885. See also Jones had two prominent relatives from his maternal grandmother: * American Revolutionary War hero and former British Army officer Major General Richard Montgomery * Colonel Alexander Montgomery, M.P. for County Donegal in 1768 and British Army officer His sister Barbara married Count von Rechberg (1806-1899), Foreign Minister of Austria, 1859-1864.

It was laid down at Charleston Navy Yard, Charleston, South Carolina. The ship was commissioned on 12 December 1944 with LtJG. George B. Timmerman Jr., USNR in command.  Service history During World War II the ship was assigned to the Asiatic Pacific theater as part of the Fifth fleet. The Kerama Retto islands were a small chain of islands 15 miles west of the southwest tip of Okinawa. The invasion of the Kerma Retto was an opportunity to break in all twelve of the 188-class LSM(R)s. One of the reasons that Admiral Turner wanted to capture Kerama Retto was his knowledge that the Japanese Sea Raiding Units had suicide boats hidden there. On the morning of 29 March three of these boats attacked but were promptly destroyed. The northern half of the six-mile-wide invasion beach was assigned to Task Force 53, under the command of Rear Admiral Lawrence F. Reifsnider. Embarked were the 1st and 6th Marine Divisions under Major General Roy S. Geiger. LSM(R)-198 was part of the northern support craft along with , , , , and . On 13 April 1945, LSM(R)-192, LSM(R)-193, LSM(R)-196, LSM(R)-197, LSM(R)-198, LSM(R)-199 and LC(FF)-535 were assigned to night harassment and destructive bombardment of Ie Shima. They used irregular rocket fire for destructive harassment together with star shells fired from their 5-inch guns for illumination and harassment. Their 40 mm guns prevented reinforcement of the beach defenses. The night patrols of the surrounding waters prevented any movement or mine laying. On the morning of 16 April, these LSM(R)s were used for rocket attack in support of assault troops. Approximately 2,600 rockets were fired into a large area composed principally of the South Eastern sector of the town of le Shima and the Eastern and South Eastern vicinities of Ie-gushuyama. Battle of Okinawa During the long battle of Okinawa, the LSM(R)s were used to form pickets around the Allied Fleet. These pickets were to give advance warning of Japanese air attack, particularly by kamikaze aircraft. The LSM(R)s were used although their flotilla commander noted their unsuitability for the task. On 3 May and 4 May, among the losses to kamikaze attacks were , and . Notes  References  LSM-LSM(R) WW II Amphibious Forces Vol. II, Turner Publishing Co., 1996. *Stewart, James M.

The runway is closed, except for emergencies, or with prior permission from the United States Fish and Wildlife Service. History The Seabees in 1942 constructed the airfield. They built a x runway and a ramp area sufficient for 24 single-engine aircraft, dredging coral to expand the island. Of the area of the expanded island, the airfield took up . The Navy designated this airfield as Naval Air Facility French Frigate Shoals, an auxiliary of Naval Station Pearl Harbor. The 1946 Aleutian Islands earthquake generated a tsunami that swept clean Tern Island, and the Navy closed the naval air facility.
