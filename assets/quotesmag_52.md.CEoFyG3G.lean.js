She was built at the Crichton-Vulcan shipyard in Turku and was launched in 1932. Following the end of the Continuation War, V√§in√§m√∂inen was handed over to the Soviet Union as war reparations and renamed Vyborg. The ship remained in Soviet hands until her scrapping in 1966. Design V√§in√§m√∂inen and Ilmarinen were planned to be mobile coastal fortresses for the defence of the Finnish demilitarized islands at √Öland in particular. The two ships were not well suited for the open seas due to a design with emphasis on operations in the shallow waters of the archipelago: it has been said that they were volatile and rolled too much. The minimal depth keel, together with the high conning tower, made the ships' movements slow and wide. It was said that the ships were uncomfortable, but harmless to their crews. The ship's heavy armament of Bofors guns could fire shells of up to . Fire control In fire control, the two coastal ships were identical. The fire control centre and the gun turrets were connected electrically so that ranging and orders could be given without spoken contact. With the aid of mechanical calculators, the values were transferred directly to the gun turrets. Operational history V√§in√§m√∂inen in 1938 Winter War During the Winter War, the two coastal defence ships were transferred to the √Öland islands to protect against invasion. When the ice cover started to become too thick in December, the ships were transferred to Turku, where their anti-aircraft artillery aided in the defence of the city. Continuation War The only time V√§in√§m√∂inen and Ilmarinen fired their heavy artillery against an enemy was at the beginning of the Continuation War, during the Soviet Red Army evacuation of their base at the Hanko Peninsula. V√§in√§m√∂inen also participated in the distraction manoeuvre Operation Nordwind on 13 September 1941, during the course of which her sister ship Ilmarinen was lost to mines. In 1943 \\"Detachment V√§in√§m√∂inen\\", which consisted of V√§in√§m√∂inen, six VMV patrol boats and six motor minesweepers, was moved east to take positions along the coast between Helsinki and Kotka. She did not actively participate in many operations, since the heavier Soviet naval units never left Leningrad, where they were used as floating batteries during the siege. As a result, V√§in√§m√∂inens primary operational duties were to patrol the Gulf of Finland between the minefields \\"Seeigel\\" and \\"Nashorn\\", as well as protection of the German-Finnish anti-submarine net across the gulf. During the Soviet assault in the summer of 1944, the Soviets put much effort into trying to find and sink V√§in√§m√∂inen. Reconnaissance efforts revealed a large warship anchored in Kotka harbour and the Soviets launched an air attack of 132 bombers and fighters. However the target was not V√§in√§m√∂inen ‚Äî instead it was the German anti-aircraft cruiser Niobe, which was sunk during this attack. Postwar After the end of the Continuation War V√§in√§m√∂inen was handed over as war reparations to the Soviet Union. The ship was handed over on 29 May 1947 to the Soviet Baltic Fleet, where she was renamed Vyborg. The ship served over 6 years in the Red Fleet at the Soviet base in Porkkala, Finland. The ship was called Vanya (a Russian short form of the name Ivan) by the sailors of the Baltic Fleet. Vyborg was modernized during the 1950s and served for a while as an accommodation ship in Tallinn. Preparations to scrap the ship were begun in 1958. During this time, there were talks to return the ship to Finland. The ship was, however, scrapped in 1966 at a Leningrad scrapyard. According to Soviet calculations, 2,700 tons of metal were recovered.

They replaced and supplemented the 231 B that had a tendency to derail. The class was numbered 231-501 to 231-783 by the √âtat and 231.C.501 to 231.C.783 by the SNCF; with class letters \\"C\\" through \\"H\\" used depending on the level of rebuilding and modernisation. The first locomotives were built by Fives-Lille; however only the first locomotive has entered service before the city of Lille was overrun by the advancing German Army during World War I. Five others were seized by the Germans. Subsequently orders were placed with North British Locomotive Company for 40 locomotives. Five of these were lost when the cargo ship carrying them was sunk during an attack by a German submarine; they were later replaced by construction of new locomotives. Post-war production was with Fives-Lille, Schneider et Cie., and the newly founded Compagnie g√©n√©rale de Construction de locomotives (Batignolles-Ch√¢tillon). Four of the five taken away by the Germans returned to the √âtat after the end of the war, and were given numbers at the end of the class-list. The fifth locomotive went to the Chemins de Fer du Nord, where it was numbered 3.1150; the SNCF renumbered it 2-231.B.1 until 1947 when it was transferred to the R√©gion Ouest and renumbered 3-231.F.784. The engines were famous for their service on passenger trains, notably on the Paris-Le Havre and Paris-Le Mans-Rennes expresses. After World War I other companies received 231-500s thanks to government aid. They were designated 231 TP for Travaux Publics (Public Works), the former name of the Ministry of Transport. The 231 G was rated at . Engine 231-523 was modified in 1929 from four cylinders to three, and had Lentz valves fitted. 231 G in preservation 231 G 558 was a Pacific engine of the √âtat, built in 1922. It had a career pulling express passenger trains on the Paris-Chartres- Bordeaux, Paris-Niort, Paris-Saintes, Paris-Cherbourg, and Paris-Le Havre runs. It ended its career on the run between Nantes and Le Croisic, and pulled its last train on 29 September 1968 when it was moved to Angers. In 1969 it was used in Dieppe as a heater for ferries. The SNCF wished to sell the engine for scrap in 1971, but the depot manager in Sotteville got the engine transferred to his depot in 1972. After five years of campaigning, the engine was sold to the depot staff for the token price of one franc. The engine was listed for preservation on 4 June 1984. After 8,000 man-hours of work, the engine was made fit for mainline use. The engine was reviewed and received its timbre, a stamp showing the pressure of the boiler, on 28 November 1985 and was certified for mainline use on 30 May 1986. The Princess, as it is nicknamed, made its first run to Paris on 29 June 1986. In the summer of 2007, 231 G 558 could be found running daily on the branch line between Paimpol and Pontrieux in northern Brittany.

He is mostly remembered for his lengthy and successful spell with A.C. Milan, where he played alongside Baresi, Maldini, Costacurta, and Tassotti, forming a strong defensive line-up under managers Arrigo Sacchi and Fabio Capello, in the teams which were respectively known as The Immortals and The Invincibles; during his 15 seasons with the club, he won five Serie A titles and three UEFA Champions League titles, among other trophies. Club career Born in Monza, Galli played for A.C. Milan from 1983 to November 1996, after initially being a member of the club's youth sector. He made his Milan debut in Serie A on 18 September 1983, in a 4‚Äì2 home win over Verona. During his 13 seasons with the club, he enjoyed many domestic and international successes under managers Arrigo Sacchi and Fabio Capello, winning five Serie A titles, three European Cups, two Intercontinental Cups, three European Super Cups, and four Italian Super Cups; he also scored 4 goals for the club in 325 appearances: 3 in Serie A, in 217 appearances, and 1 in the Coppa Italia, with his final goal coming against Brescia on 4 September 1991. He was initially an important member of the starting line-up alongside teammates Franco Baresi, Mauro Tassotti, and Paolo Maldini, featuring in what is considered to be one of the greatest defences of all time. He played a key role during Milan's 1987‚Äì88 Serie A triumph, as Milan only conceded 12 goals in 30 league games, finishing with the best defence in Italy. However, due to injuries, and the emergence of Alessandro Costacurta in his position, he began to find less space in the starting line-up, and was usually used as a substitute in later years, although he was still able to contribute to important victories with the club, notably helping Milan to keep a clean-sheet with a dominant defensive performance, as they defeated Barcelona 4‚Äì0 in the 1994 UEFA Champions League Final. Before joining the Milan senior side, Galli initially made his professional debut whilst on loan with Pescara during the 1982‚Äì83 season. Following his time with Milan, he was sold to Reggiana in 1996, another Serie A team. After two seasons with Reggiana, he moved to Brescia for two seasons, helping the club to Serie A promotion, during the 1999‚Äì2000 Serie B season, and subsequently helping the team to avoid relegation and qualify for the 2001 UEFA Intertoto Cup the following season, playing alongside Roberto Baggio, under manager Carlo Mazzone. At the age of 38, he successively spent a season at Watford whilst Gianluca Vialli was the team's manager, scoring once against Walsall. International career Galli never played for the Italy senior team, although he was capped for the Italy under-21 side on 7 occasions between 1984 and 1987, and he took part with Italy at the 1984 UEFA European Under-21 Championship, where they reached the semi-final. He was also a member of Italy's squad at the 1984 Summer Olympics, where they managed a fourth-place finish. Style of play A composed, consistent, intelligence, tenacious, and tactically versatile player, with excellent technique, distribution, Galli was known for his man-marking ability and defensive awareness; an attentive player, he excelled at reading the game, and was usually used as a centre-back, although he was often called on to fill in at any defensive position, and also played at right-back, and as sweeper on occasion. Despite his ability, he often struggled with injuries throughout his career, and predominantly served as a back-up in his later career, following the emergence of younger players. After retirement Galli retired in 2004, aged 41, after two seasons with minor Serie C2 club Pro Sesto. Following his retirement, he began a coaching career, and he has been responsible for the A.C. Milan youth system for many years. In August 2008, he began working for the first team, and he became Carlo Ancelotti's assistant-coach, alongside his former teammate Tassotti. Following Ancelotti's departure in 2009, he became a technical assistant of then-new head coach Leonardo Ara√∫jo. Galli also worked as a pundit on occasion. In September 2012, he began the coaching course in Coverciano.

David R. Hinson is best known for the three years, 1993 to 1996, during which he served as Administrator of the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) as an appointee of President Bill Clinton. Hinson oversaw the government's response to the Valujet Flight 592 crash on May 11, 1996 in the Florida Everglades. According to the NTSB, the airline had improperly transported cabin chemical-oxygen generators in the cargo hold, which started a fire on board when the initiation pins were jostled and the oxygen generators began to flow. The chemical reaction inside the metal canisters created tremendous heat, ignited tires adjacent to the canisters, and the oxygen fed the fire. Eventually the cabin filled with smoke and fire from the cargo hold area. Mr. Hinson, a graduate of the University of Washington with a B. A. degree, has been involved with flying since 1954, when he entered flight school with the Navy. After a ten-year hitch in the military (including both active and reserve status) In 1961, he flew as a pilot for Northwest Airlines and as an instructor pilot for United Air Lines. He then joined West Coast Airline (later renamed Hughes Airwest) for ten years (1963‚Äì73) as captain and as Director of Flight Standards and Engineering.Whitnah, Donald Robert, U.S. Department of Transportation: A Reference History.p. 179. 1998. Greenwood Press. Westport, Connecticut & London. . In 1973, Hinson moved on to other ventures, notably Hinson-Minella, Inc., a limited partnership whose investments included Flightcraft, Inc., a distributorship for Beech Aircraft in the Pacific Northwest. Then, in 1978, he joined with three other people to start Midway Airlines, which he served as chairman for six years (1985‚Äì91). While working as the Executive Vice President for Douglas Aircraft, a subsidiary of McDonnell Douglas, President Clinton appointed him to head the FAA. Changes enacted by Hinson included a \\"One Level of Safety\\" program, which was intended to raise safety standards for commuter airlines. On November 11, 1996, as Hinson was preparing to leave the FAA, he discussed some of the issues that still faced the agency. > :: The ValuJet DC-9 crash in the Everglades, which killed 110 people, > embarrassed his boss, the Secretary of Transportation, Federico Pena, who > had publicly announced that the airline was safe. Hinson had concurred in > this announcement. Yet in the following month, the FAA had grounded the > airline. Hinson then said that the grounding was for violations by the > airline that were unrelated to the crash. :: A TWA 747 bound for Paris with > 230 people aboard exploded off of Long Island. All aboard were killed, and > evidences of explosives were found in the wreckage. The cause of the crash > was still unknown, months afterward. The FAA explained that all large > planes,\\"...are likely to have evidence of explosives, whether they have been > bombed or not, because of the procedures used when dogs are put through > bomb-sniffing exercises on board.\\" ::A Wyoming crash in July killed a 7-year > old girl who was trying to become the youngest person ever to fly across the > country.

He was also a college football player for the Penn Quakers football team of the University of Pennsylvania from 1897 to 1900. Hare is one of only a handful of men to earn All-American honors during all four years of college. He was selected as a charter member of the College Football Hall of Fame in 1951. While primarily a guard, he also ran, punted, kicked off, and drop- kicked extra points. In an attempt to name retroactive Heisman Trophy winners before the first one was awarded in 1935, Hare was awarded the mythical 1900 trophy. Biography He won the silver medal in the hammer throw in the 1900 Summer Olympics held in Paris, as well as placing eighth in the shot put and competing without making a legal mark in the discus throw. A prominent student at Penn, where he was a member of St. Anthony Hall, he was also involved in many other sports, including archery and track and field. He competed for the United States in the 1904 Summer Olympics held in St. Louis, Missouri in the all-rounder which consisted of 100 yd run, shot put, high jump, 880 yd walk, hammer throw, pole vault, 120 yd hurdles, 56 lb weight throw, long jump and 1 mile run, where he won the bronze medal. Tom Kielly and Adam Gunn won gold and silver respectively. He also was on the gold medal winning tug of war team in those same Olympics, making him one of the few Olympians to win all three medals, gold, silver and bronze. He competed in the 1904 Olympics just after he earned a J.D. law degree at Penn. He later practiced law in Philadelphia, excelled as a painter, and authored two series of books. The first, the Kent of Malvern series, consisted of four books, depicting the development of a naughty boy into a worthy young man, guided by the good people of Malvern School. The next series, The Graduate Coach series, consisted of five volumes and was a celebration of the importance of sports in a man's life. Both were published by the Penn Press and were best sellers. He later became President of the Bryn Mawr Hospital, succeeding his brother C. Willing Hare at that job. He and his wife Katherine Sargent Hare lived in Radnor on a farm known as Lime House and had four children. His elder son, Truxtun Hare, Jr. was also an All American football player at Yale, class of 1933. Truxtun served in the Navy and the CIA, and was President of the Pennsylvania Hospital from 1957 to 1970. The name Truxtun is taken from the surname of their forebear, Commodore Thomas Truxtun of the US Navy.

Biography Kiely was born in Ballyneale, near Carrick-on-Suir in County Tipperary, Ireland, the son of William and Mary (nee Downey) Keily. He attended Ballyneale National School where he started to take part in Gaelic football, hurling and athletics. He represented Tipperary at Hurling, playing for Munster when they beat Leinster in London. In addition, he was the captain of the Grangemockler Gaelic Football Team and on the same day as he represented Munster in the hurling match against Leinster he played Gaelic football for Ireland versus London-Irish at Stamford Bridge. In all, Kiely won 53 sporting titles and these were 38 Gaelic Athletic Association titles and Irish Amateur Athletic Association titles. He also won five English hammer throwing titles and two American all round championships. Away from the sports field Kielt played the fiddle and the flute and was an accomplished Irish dancer. Kiely competed in the 1904 Summer Olympics held in St. Louis, Missouri, in the all-round, which consisted of 100 yd run, shot put, high jump, 880 yd walk, hammer throw, pole vault, 120 yd hurdles, 56 pounds weight throw, long jump and 1 mile run. All ten events were held on the same day. He won the gold medal. Kiely was thirty-four at this time. The British team had approached him with promises of his fare and expenses, and American sponsorship was also offered but, as a committed nationalist, he decided to go on his own, representing his native country. He raised the fare partly by selling many of the prizes he had won over the years and sailed to the US at the end of May. In America he had several more offers to join the American or British teams. But again he declined and made it clear in all statements to the press that he would represent only Ireland in the Olympic Games. As Ireland was not independent in 1904 the IOC lists him as representative of the team of Great Britain and Ireland at the 1904 Summer Olympics. He achieved his gold in 1904 becoming the first multi-event track and field champion in the Modern Olympic Games. He died on 6 November 1951 at his home in Carrick-on- Suir and he was buried in the cemetery at Ballyneale. He is commemorated by a memorial at Ballyneale Church which was unveiled in 1970. In 2016 his gold medal was displayed at the Gaelic Athletic Association's Museum as part of the Irish Olympians exhibition.

After a period of pastoral work from 1946 to 1951, Poletti was made Pro-Vicar General of Novara in 1954, and on 16 June 1955 a Protonotary Apostolic. On 12 July 1958, Poletti was appointed Auxiliary Bishop of Novara and Titular Bishop of Medeli. He received his episcopal consecration on the following 14 September from Archbishop Vincenzo Gremigni, MSC, with Bishops Mario Longo Dorni and Francesco Brustia serving as co-consecrators. Poletti attended the Second Vatican Council from 1962 to 1965, and was later named Archbishop of Spoleto on 26 June 1967.

In systems undergoing one of the species addition or removal processes mentioned previously, the addition or removal generates a mean flow in the flowing fluid as the fluid next to the interface is displaced by the production or removal of additional fluid by the processes occurring at the interface. The transport of the species by this mean flow is the Stefan flow. When concentration gradients of the species are also present, diffusion transports the species relative to the mean flow. The total transport rate of the species is then given by a summation of the Stefan flow and diffusive contributions. An example of the Stefan flow occurs when a droplet of liquid evaporates in air. In this case, the vapor/air mixture surrounding the droplet is the flowing fluid, and liquid/vapor boundary of the droplet is the interface. As heat is absorbed by the droplet from the environment, some of the liquid evaporates into vapor at the surface of the droplet, and flows away from the droplet as it is displaced by additional vapor evaporating from the droplet. This process causes the flowing medium to move away from the droplet at some mean speed that is dependent on the evaporation rate and other factors such as droplet size and composition. In addition to this mean flow, a concentration gradient must exist in the neighborhood of the droplet (assuming an isolated droplet) since the flowing medium is mostly air far from the droplet and mostly vapor near the droplet. This gradient causes Fickian diffusion that transports the vapor away from the droplet and the air towards it, with respect to the mean flow. Thus, in the frame of the droplet, the flow of vapor away from the droplet is faster than for the pure Stefan flow, since diffusion is working in the same direction as the mean flow. However, the flow of air away from the droplet is slower than the pure Stefan flow, since diffusion is working to transport air back towards the droplet against the Stefan flow. Such flow from evaporating droplets is important in understanding the combustion of liquid fuels such as diesel in internal combustion engines, and in the design of such engines. The Stefan flow from evaporating droplets and subliming ice particles also plays prominently in meteorology as it influences the formation and dispersion of clouds and precipitation.

An Egyptian terrier, the dog was befriended by a soldier serving in the unit when it was stationed in Egypt during the Second World War. The dog subsequently followed the battalion throughout various locations in the Middle East and in Greece and Crete, before being smuggled back to Australia in 1942. In 1945, the dog became the subject of a book by author Ion Idriess, and is believed to have been destroyed by quarantine officials, although this remains the subject of speculation with some researchers claiming that the dog survived after its owner switched it with another prior to destruction. Story Horrie, an Egyptian terrier, was befriended as a puppy by Australian soldier Private Jim Moody when he was stationed in the Ikingi Maryut area of Egypt in 1941. The dog became the unofficial mascot of Moody's unit, the 2/1st Machine Gun Battalion, and followed them as they moved around the Middle East and Greece during their various campaigns. According to the Australian War Memorial, Horrie was described by his owner as being \\"intelligent and easily trained\\", and he was employed as an air sentry, alerting troops to approaching enemy aircraft. He was promoted to the rank of corporal, and during the evacuation of Greece, Horrie was aboard the troopship Costa Rica when it was sunk. He managed to survive, though, and later made it to Crete when he was subsequently wounded by a bomb blast. In 1942, after further service in Syria as part of the Allied garrison, Horrie was brought back to Australia when Moody was repatriated. In order to get around stringent quarantine laws which would have prevented him from bringing Horrie back, Moody smuggled the dog home in a canvas bag, which was reinforced with wooden slats so that the dog could breathe. In 1945, after Horrie came to public attention following the publishing of a book by Ion Idriess about Horrie's exploits, Moody was ordered by quarantine officials to surrender Horrie to be put down. It remains uncertain as to whether this occurred. It is believed that the dog was destroyed on 12 March 1945, although according to author Anthony Hill, in his book Animal Heroes it was claimed that Horrie survived after Moody substituted him with another dog from the pound, who was destroyed in Horrie's place, and that Horrie lived out his natural life near Corryong, in rural Victoria. Books Horrie is the subject of a book published in 1948 by Australian author Ion Idriess titled Horrie the Wog-Dog: With the A.I.F. in Egypt, Greece, Crete and Palestine. It was written using material provided by Jim Moody. Horrie is also the subject of \\"Horrie the War Dog\\" written by Roland Perry, published in 2013. Horrie is also mentioned in The Long Carry: A History of the 2/1 Australian Machine Gun Battalion 1939‚Äì46 written by Philip Hocking and published in 1997, and in Animal Heroes by Anthony Hill. Statue During the 2016 ANZAC Day service at the Corryong Memorial Hall & Gardens a statue of Horrie the Wog Dog was unveiled to the public.

Brewsterite-Sr, the more common of these, is a hydrous strontium and aluminium silicate, (Sr,Ba)2Al4Si12O32¬∑10H2O. Small amounts of barium is usually present replacing part of the strontium. The appropriate species name depends on the dominant element. The species are visually indistinguishable, and the series name brewsterite is still used whenever testing has not been performed. It is generally considered to be monoclinic, though optical studies have suggested it might be triclinic. It has one plane of perfect cleavage. The color is white, yellow-white, or gray. The Mohs' hardness is 5. It is transparent to translucent. The crystals are prismatic. Brewsterite is isomorphous with heulandite. It is named after Sir David Brewster (1781‚Äì1868) who described it in 1822. The type locality for the series and for brewsterite-Sr is Strontian, Argyll, Scotland.

College Information In the spirit of its founder, the Mahatma Gandhi Institute of Medical Sciences, Sevagram today is committed to the pursuit of professional excellence by evolving an integrated pattern of medical education and it seeks to provide accessible and affordable health care primarily to underprivileged rural communities. Location The institute is located in Sevagram, a small village about 8 km from the city of Wardha. It is well connected with other parts of the country by rail and road links. Dr. Babasaheb Ambedkar International Airport at Nagpur is about 70 km away from the institute. History The MGIMS was begun in 1969, the Gandhi centenary year. It is the first rural medical college in India. It was started by Dr Sushila Nayyar. The institute takes pride in the fact that its Kasturba Hospital, started in 1944, is the only hospital started by the father of the nation himself.http://www.mgims.ac.in/index.php Information from MGIMS's Official website Academics The courses offered by the institute are * M.B.B.S. (annual intake of 100 students) * M.D./M.S. * Diploma courses in Medicine and Surgery Admissions The institute enrolls 100 students every year. Half are from the state of Maharashtra and the other half come from the rest of India. Earlier the institute was having special reservations for students from rural areas of the count and the institute was having its own premedical test (PMT) examination, which includes a multiple choice question test on physics, chemistry and biology and a special theory paper on Gandhian thoughts. The students are selected on the basis of the marks obtained in these exams. But since 2017 institute admitting the students from NEET-UG & NEET-PG ( National Eligibility cum Entrance Test ) Postgraduate courses The institute offers postgraduate training in almost all important disciplines of medical science. Admission to these courses is based on performance of a student in NEET PG exam. Medical services Kasturba Hospital The Kasturba Hospital was started in 1945 by Sushila Nayar, close associate of Gandhi and his personal physician. From 770 bed hospital, Kasturba Hospital at Sevagram has now grown into a nearly 1000- bed teaching hospital located in Sevagram, about 8 km from Wardha town, and offers tertiary care healthcare facilities to rural patients. Over a 24-hour period, close to 1700 patients access outpatient care in the hospital, hospital pharmacies deal with 1800 prescriptions, 140 patients seek admission to the hospital wards, 14 patients undergo major surgeries, 12 babies are delivered, and 20 units of blood are transfused. In addition, 270 patients undergo radiography, 65 ultrasound examinations, 14 computed tomography, and seven patients have a magnetic resonance imaging scan. The laboratories report 750 biochemical tests, 510 complete blood counts, 100 serologic tests, 20 cytology samples and 15 biopsy specimens. A team of a little over 100 consultants, 120 residents, 60 interns, and 250 nurses - all staying on campus - continues its tradition of excellence. Supported by laboratories known for their quality, and staffed by doctors known for quality of care, patient safety and reputation in central India, the hospital is committed for providing affordable and appropriate care to the population it serves. Research Facility- as well as community-based research is conducted in areas like maternal, neonatal, and child health care, infectious diseases, nutritional illnesses, lifestyle and disorders. To explore traditional systems of Indian medicine. Lead center for State Level Monitoring of ICDS The Department of Community Medicine has been designated the lead center for State Level Monitoring of ICDS activities in Maharashtra. Dr BS Garg, Dr Subodh S Gupta and Dr PR Deshmukh have been appointed State ICDS Consultants. They monitored the activities of ICDS in six districts of Maharashtra during the year 2008‚Äì09; viz. Wardha, Yavatmal, Amravati, Chandrapur, Akola, and Buldhana. They also coordinated the monitoring of ICDS activities throughout the state conducted by selected medical colleges identified for this purpose. Clinical Epidemiology Unit The Clinical Epidemiology Unit was expanded to include more members after it was approved by IndiaCLEN. The Clinical Epidemiology Unit started its first activity with a capacity building program of its members. The unit has also started an orientation program for all the new post-graduate students who take admission at MGIMS, Sevagram. Life at campus The institute is unique in following the Gandhian principles. All the students and staff wear khadi. It brings about a unique rich culture in the institute. The staff and the students participate in shram daan. The institute follows a strict vegetarianism policy. Alcohol consumption is prohibited in the institute. Medical Orientation Camp The newly admitted students spend 15 days in the Sevagram Ashram for the orientation to the Gandhian way of life. They follow the Ashram rules during these days. Some activities include Shramdan and spinning khadi. There are lectures from people from various runs of life. Social Service camp Every batch of medical students is allotted a small village from around Wardha. The students stay in that village for 15 days. Each student is allotted a certain number of families. He is responsible for the health concerns of all its members. The students spend this time giving health information to their families. They also learn a great deal about the real problems of the rural masses. The villagers are all given a free health checkup and are investigated for basic infections like malaria and filaria. The students continue to visit this village for three years, once every month. Re-Orientation to Medical Education Camp The Re-Orientation to Medical Education or ROME camp is held at the end of second professional. It was previously held at the Kasturba Rural Health Training Center (KRHTC) at Aanji. Since 2008, it is being held at Rural Health Training center (RHTC) at Bhidi. This is a 15-day exercise where students learn aspects of Public Health and get hands on experience of the rural India.  Notable alumni  * Dr K.K. Aggarwal, cardiologist * Dr Mandeep R.

He was often noted for his height (6 ft 4in). Early life and education Say was the son of Commander Richard Say RNVR. He was educated at Arnold House School in London, University College School, Christ's College, Cambridge and Ridley Hall. Ordained ministry Say was ordained deacon in the Church of England in Canterbury Cathedral on 22 December 1939 and was ordained priest just 10 days later on 1 January 1940. He served his curacy at Croydon (then in the Diocese of Canterbury), then at St Martin-in-the-Fields (Diocese of London) where he was General Secretary of the Church of England Youth Council. He later became General Secretary of the British Council of Churches and (as a conscious disciple of William Temple and a close supporter of Bishop George Bell) an Anglican representative at World Council of Churches conferences. He retired from those roles in 1955 to parish ministry in Hatfield (with the linked office of chaplain to the Marquess of Salisbury). After his consecration as bishop in 1961, Say took a seat in the House of Lords from 1969 to 1988 (speaking there in 1986 on the admission of women into Holy Orders as deacons) and for some years deputised for the Archbishop of Canterbury as chairman of the board of governors of the Church Commissioners. He also spoke in General Synod in favour of church marriages for divorc√©s (1983) and of Anglican-Methodist reunion. Later life On retirement as Bishop of Rochester (he was one of the last bishops not required to retire at 70, whilst the final words at his retirement service being ‚ÄúAlleluia ‚Äî on we go‚Äù) he moved to Wye, where he was active in the parish and was an honorary assistant bishop in the Diocese of Canterbury until shortly before his death. Say supported the city of Rochester, Chatham, Kent County Cricket Club, the University of Kent (serving as Pro Chancellor for several years) and, more recently, Canterbury itself. He was also for 18 years High Almoner to the Queen. He was honorary chaplain of the Pilgrims Society from 1968 till 2002. Death and legacy On Say's death, the Bishop of Dover, Stephen Venner, said: :I was privileged to benefit from Bishop David's advice and friendship over the years. Even when I saw him a few days before he died, he typically ministered to me as much as I to him. Say's funeral service was celebrated in the nave of Canterbury Cathedral on 27 September 2006 and a public memorial service was held on 2 February 2007 in Rochester Cathedral (with a sermon by the then Bishop of Rochester, Michael Nazir-Ali). His wife Irene was a JP and gardener who died in 2003. They had a son and two daughters, all of whom survived them.

As the eldest son of industrialist Charles Pratt, in 1875 he began working at Charles Pratt and Company, soon becoming president. He was a director of the Standard Oil Company and later a president of the Pratt Institute in Brooklyn. A philanthropist, he donated large sums to Vassar College and Amherst College, among other institutions. Early life and education Pratt was born on November 2, 1855 in Brooklyn. He was raised on the Pratt family estate at 232 Clinton Avenue in the Clinton Hill district. Pratt was the eldest son of Charles Pratt and Lydia A. Richardson. His father married again, after the death of his first wife, to Mary Richardson. Charles had five younger half- brothers: Frederic B. Pratt, George Dupont Pratt, Herbert L. Pratt, John Teele Pratt and Harold I. Pratt, and one half-sister. He graduated from Adelphi Academy in 1875 and from Amherst College in the class of 1879. In 1880 at the age of 24, he was living at the family estate in Clinton Hill with his six younger siblings. Career In 1875, Pratt began his business career at one of the family businesses, Charles Pratt & Co, a financial firm started by his father. He later became its president. Pratt joined Standard Oil in 1879. He was a director and secretary at Standard Oil from 1899 to 1911, and treasurer from 1908 to 1911. For years he was also president of the Pratt Institute in Brooklyn, contributing greatly to its endowment. For a time, he was a vice president of the Long Island Rail Road. He also held directorships in other companies, including the Brooklyn City Railroad and American Express. In March 1900, Pratt was re-elected a director of the United States Mortgage and Trust Company, to serve three years. Prior to 1923, he was a trustee of the Atlantic Mutual Insurance Company, president and director of The Thrift, and director of the Union Mortgage Company, Chelseai Fibre Mills, Hoagland Laboratories, Pratt & Lambert, Self-Winding Clock Company, and others. In May 1923, Justice Stephen Calaghan of the Kings County Supreme Court confirmed ‚Äúfindings of a special sheriff's jury‚Äù that Pratt was unable to conduct his business. The New York Times reported that this was due to his \\"age,\\" likely a euphemism for dementia or another variant of cognitive impairment. His wife and two living sons were named a committee of the person to represent him. According to the report, the condition manifested in December 1922. Philanthropy He was president of the Pratt Institute's board of trustees, as well for a time of the Adelphi Academy. He was a trustee of Amherst College and Vassar College. He was a director of the Brooklyn Bureau of Charities and other charitable entities. He personally contributed funds to Adelphi Academy, Emmanuel Baptist Church in Brooklyn, and Amherst and Vassar. For example, as a trustee of Vassar from 1908 and 19021, he contributed more than $800,000, which enabled development of the college's outdoor theatre, artificial lake, and landscape gardens. The New York Times said the gardens ‚Äúmade its campus famous throughout the country.‚Äù Pratt House at Vassar, a residence for the Warden, was completed in 1915 by architects York and Sawyer. Pratt also contributed to the endowment and the building of structures at the Pratt Institute. In 1910, he and his five brothers and a sister gave $1,750,000 to the institute. As a trustee of Amherst from 1897 and 1921, Pratt contributed funds for a gymnasium, dormitory, and other buildings. He was the first alumnus to donate a building to Amherst College‚Äîthe Pratt Gymnasium was erected in 1883, and was reconstructed as the Pratt Museum in 1942. Following further rebuilding, it reopened in August 2007 as the Charles M. Pratt Dormitory. Pratt was also responsible for the Morris Pratt Dormitory at Amherst College in 1911, in memory of his son Morris, who died at Amherst while an undergraduate student. Personal life He was married to Mary Seamoor Morris Pratt, daughter of Governor of Connecticut Luzon B. Morris, on May 8, 1994. He and Mary Seymour Morris had five children: * Morris Pratt (November 29, 1885 ‚Äì July 15, 1910) * Theodore Pratt (May 21, 1887 ‚Äì June 1977) married Laura Merrick on June 2, 1910.

Funds also went to the International Committee of the Young Men's Christian Association, as well as Pomona College, and the Presbyterian Church of Glen Cove, L.I. A June 1938 report filed with Kings County valued the C. M. Pratt estate at a net value of $20,004,812. Gross estate was $22,181,006. His widow and children were to share in the property, which was primarily in stocks and bonds. A state tax of $3,305,062 was levied against the property, with the Federal tax more. His widow died on October 24, 1947 at their home of Seamoor in Glen Cove. Estates Charles Millard Pratt House, 241 Clinton Ave, Brooklyn Charles Millard Pratt House, one of only several \\"ultimate bungalows\\", in California Pratt had a number of estates and mansions designed. William Tubby designed the Charles Millard Pratt House at 241 Clinton Avenue, Clinton Hill, Brooklyn in 1893. Located in Brooklyn's Clinton Hill Historic District, it is one of the city's finest examples of Romanesque revival architecture. The property is now owned by the Roman Catholic Bishop of Brooklyn. Between 1921 and his death in 1935, Pratt spent \\"practically all his time\\" at 241 Clinton Avenue. He also spent time at his estates outside of Brooklyn. Pratt had a winter home, also known as Charles M. Pratt House, designed by architects Greene and Greene in Ojai, California and completed in 1909. The winter bungalow was on a 54-acre estate as of 2001. Architectural Digest described it as an ‚ÄúAmerican masterpiece.‚Äù In 1923, Pratt was said to be living at Seamoor, his summer estate, on the North Shore of Long Island in Glen Cove, New York. Seamoor was designed by the New York firm of Lamb & Rich.Robert B. MacKay, et al., Long Island Country Houses and Their Architects (W. W. Norton & Company, 1997), 245‚Äì46. In 1903, a barn on the property burned down, killing 12 horses. Pratt said the losses were covered by insurance. By October 1930, the property's assessed valuation was around $7 million. The Pratt estate also included the homes of nine members of the family: Representative Ruth Baker Pratt, Harold I. Pratt, Herbert L. Pratt, Charles Pratt, Frederic B. Pratt, George D. Pratt, F. L. Babbett and Helen P. Emmetto. The large estate was later broken up. In the late 20th century, a portion of the property was donated to the city of Glen Cove for use as a public park. It has been developed for a golf course, tennis courts, a restaurant and related facilities.

It was formerly known as Independence Community Junior College. History Independence Community College was established in 1925 as grades 13 and 14 of the Independence public school system. In 1967, Independence Community College legally separated from the school district. Construction of the new community college on a campus, formerly the Independence Country Club, began in 1969. Classes at the new site began in September 1970. The ICC campus is now home to the Academic Building, Fine Arts Building, Student Union, Center for Innovation and Entrepreneurship, Field House, Administration Building, William Inge Center for the Arts, fitness center, athletic practice fields, disc golf course, 96-bed multi-structure living complex, a 200-bed residence hall, and a 135-bed suite-style residence hall. In 2010, a former large retail space was donated at a location next to the local Wal-Mart. The College renovated the new West Campus, increasing the College's visibility in the community and adding much-needed space for technical programs. A capital campaign was conducted, raising $760,000 for renovation of the facility. The College has also contributed approximately $350,000 to the renovation of that building. This campus is located on the west side of Independence and is home to Allied Health, Cosmetology, Veterinary Technology, and Culinary.

It is also directed by Jeff Tan. Principal photography of the film was done within the University of the Philippines Los Ba√±os campus. Plot Two best friends from the province of Iloilo, Pearl (Pauleen Luna), a simple and smart girl, and her longtime best friend Jonathan (Gian Carlos), who secretly harbors romantic feelings for her, arrive in Manila to study in an Arts Academy. Upon enrollment, a clique of students led by Mimi (Iwa Moto), takes interest in them. Mimi is a pretty, rich and popular girl who gets her way through bullying others. Her minions consist of her right-hand woman, painter Eva (Katarina Perez), basketball jock Joshua (Jason Abalos), film and photography major Jowee (Glaiza de Castro), and delinquent band frontman Hector (Ketchup Eusebio). Mimi takes Pearl and Jonathan into her fold, befriending them in exchange for academic favors from the smart and studious Pearl. However, Pearl rebuffs the clique after realizing their deceptions; while Jonathan, on the other hand, is seduced and swayed by a prominent fraternity. Soon after, Pearl and Jonathan's close friendship becomes estranged. One night, Pearl experiences strange paranormal occurrences in the campus and has visions of a woman in white singing a folk lullaby. She and Jonathan learn from others of the story of a white lady which has been rumored to have frequented the school grounds. A carpenter reveals to Jonathan about a storage shed that burnt down and a vision of the said woman at the same spot. Pearl meets and befriends Tasya, a kindhearted Guimaras-born elderly woman residing in a house situated on the Academy's vast campus. Tasya tells the story of her granddaughter Christina (Angelica Panganiban), a simple girl also hailing from Iloilo and Guimaras who was reportedly driven into hiding by Mimi‚Äôs pompousness. Pearl immediately feels an affinity towards Christina since both girls have been on the receiving end of Mimi‚Äôs dirty actions. The haunting worsens when Pearl lands the highly coveted lead role in the school play, which also earns her the brunt of Mimi‚Äôs ire since Mimi had wanted the role for herself. On top of everything else, a burgeoning relationship begins to kindle between Pearl and Robbie (JC de Vera), the rich, athletic and most popular guy in school, whom Mimi also desires. Flashbacks show the story of Christina. Robbie befriends her after rescuing her from bullies and Mimi's gang. The two begin a relationship which his father opposed and forced them to separate and have Robbie choose Mimi. Soon thereafter, Mimi's friends begin to torment her frequently. Christina shuns Robbie after being having her way by his and the gang's actions. After the gang imprison her in a storage shed, Mimi poisons a janitor to silence him and Robbie, under her influence, murders Christina by setting the shed on fire. In a series of intense ghostly appearances, the white lady manifests herself to the \\"in\\" group, letting them experience her wrath one by one. Hector is suffocated by rats when he falls into a hole after encountering the entity dissolving to rodents, Joshua falls from Mimi's bedroom window after a possessed doll chases him, Eva's arm is severed when she tries to escape an art room where she tries to finish a painting, Jowee is blinded by flashes in a darkroom and gets hyperventilated, while Mimi is hit by shattered mirror shards in a dressing room during a concert's premiere. During a Halloween feast, Pearl receives news that her mother is suffering from leukemia and reveals to Robbie that she is returning to Iloilo. Robbie grows overzealous and disoriented after seeing Christina's vision in his cellphone. Pearl escapes to a gypsy tent wherein she is drawn to a vision that relives the final moments of Christina. It is from here that she learns of Robbie's crime and she shuns Robbie. While on the run, Pearl is captured by Robbie and dragged to the storage shed. Jonathan witnesses this and intervenes only to be subdued by Robbie. In an attempt to silence them, Robbie sets the shed on fire and flees the scene on a motorcycle. The white lady, now revealed to be Christina, appears and causes his motorcycle to crash. He flees to a carillon wherein bells play a lullaby and Christina causes Robbie to fall to his death. It is then revealed that Pearl and Jonathan manage to survive and escape the shed fire unharmed due to Christina's soul diverting the flames. Later on, Christina walks to a light in a field, presumably the gate of Heaven, where God's spirit awaits her. Later on, Pearl returns to the province and visits Tasya wherein she reveals that her mother has died of the ailment. As Tasya reveals that she sees Christina's soul departing for the after life, Pearl states that despite their losses, they vow to take care of each other. As they comfort each other, Christina's voice sings her lullaby as she gazes down from Heaven with God on the two in the form of wind and sunlight.

This series of 50 locomotives was built during 1910. After some difficult early days (involving a number of derailments), the locomotives later became part of the SNCF's 3-231.B class. The class was initially numbered 231-011 to 231-060 by the Chemin de fer de l'√âtat and then 3-231.B.1 to 3-231.B.60 by the SNCF. The design of the 231s was based on two locomotives types: the boiler was the one used in the Ouest 2900 series Pacific. They were coupled to 22 cubic metre tenders and were very sober in appearance. These locomotives had a tendency to derail which forced the Chemin de fer de l'√âtat to change the leading bogies. Two of these accidents happened at Perray and at Bernay on 10 September 1910. After that, the locomotives were temporarily used solely on goods trains and limited to a maximum speed of 60 km/h. Once the locomotives had their leading bogies modified they were reallocated to passenger service in 1912. From 1912, the locomotives were allocated to B√¢tignoles and Vaugirard and mainly pulled express trains to Le Havre, Cherbourg, Le Mans, Thouars and on the Deauville Express. Around 1922, half the class was moved to Dieppe which gave the class the nickname of Dieppoises. They were used to pull the express from Gare Saint-Lazare to Dieppe via Pontoise. From 1929, the class was responsible for pulling the expresses between Dieppe and Le Mans and the Manche-Oc√©an, between Dieppe and Bordeaux. Several locomotives had smoke deflectors installed in 1931 as well as ACFI feedwater heaters. The class was renumbered 231.B.1 to 231.B.60 in 1938. Around 1945, a project to increase the locomotives' power to to create a class of 231.L engines failed. The locomotives were used until 1957 when the last of the locomotives was withdrawn from service.

Storm doors generally have interchangeable glass panels and window screen panels to provide visibility and prevent flying insects from entering the home. Construction Storm doors are typically made from wood, aluminum and plastics such as vinyl (PVC) and fiberglass. There are three basic types of storm doors: full-view, retractable screen, and ventilating. Full-view storm doors typically include a full glass panel and most an interchangeable full screen. Retractable screen storm doors feature a screen that is rolled up into the frame of the storm door when not in use. Ventilating storm doors generally include a full or half screen that is always in position on the storm door. Wood Residential wood and mesh screen door, US Wood was the original material from which storm doors were made. While wooden screen doors can be visually the most appealing, the wood itself requires painting or some other form of coating to protect it from the weather. Wooden screen doors less than one inch thick are used primarily as screen doors with no glass installed. Using wood thicker than one inch allows the storm door frame to accommodate glass panels. The door also becomes more rigid and durable as the thickness increases. Aluminum Residential aluminum and glass storm door, US The main advantage of aluminum over wood as a storm door material is aluminum's corrosion resistance. Aluminum storm doors do not need to be painted frequently to protect them from the elements. Aluminum storm doors are available in a variety of thicknesses. All of these thicknesses can accommodate interchangeable glass and screen panels. The least expensive storm doors are the thinnest. As the storm door frame gets thicker, the door frame becomes more rigid. The strength and rigidity of the door is limited however, by the relatively brittle aluminum alloy corners that hold the frame together. If the door gets blown open during a storm, the corners can crack and the door will lose its strength. The corners however, can be replaced if parts can be found. PVC and fibreglass Materials such as PVC and fibreglass offer the most corrosion resistance of all when used in a storm door. They can also be moulded in such a way as to realistically mimic wood grain to provide the appearance of a wooden storm door. PVC or \\"vinyl\\" storm doors often require internal steel frames to provide the necessary strength to the door. However, extruded PVC doors offer extraordinary strength. Fibreglass storm door frames are extremely strong, but the material is more expensive. Both PVC and fibreglass storm doors incorporate chemicals to slow the effects of ultraviolet radiation from the sun. UV radiation tends to make plastics become brittle. Again thicker doors have an advantage. New technology has made extruded PVC doors more durable. This product is not likely to yellow, peel, crack, contract, expand or warp. Since it is made of PVC, this product does not need any painting even if scratched. PVC doors are welded at the corners, and it is impossible for them to fall apart, separate or go out of square. The welding makes them extremely hard and durable. Because of the welding, there are no screws that will create wear and tear and separation at the corners. Types Storm doors come in three different styles: * Full view. A full view storm door means that there is a full length glass panel that has to be physically changed out if a screen is wanted in it. The unused panel of glass or screen is then stored for future use. * Ventilating. A ventilating style means that there are two glass panels and 1‚Äì2 screen panels in the door at the same time. The glass panel(s) move up or down in order to reveal the screen. This is convenient if cross ventilation in the house is desired without the inconvenience of removing and storing a glass or screen panel. * Rollscreen. This is a relatively new hybrid of the full view and ventilating storm doors. The screen is connected at the top of the storm door's window, and when not in use it automatically rolls up on a tensioned dowel in the top of the door. This gives a full-view door when the screen is not in use, and a ventilating door when it is.

The gun was briefly used by RKKA in the German-Soviet War. Description M1910/30 was powerful long range gun with big (40¬∞) maximum elevation. It was equipped with interrupted screw breechblock and recoil system consisting of hydraulic buffer and hydro-pneumatic recuperator. The carriage was of single trail type and had metal wheels with solid tires. The crew was protected by 7 mm shield. In transportation, the barrel was removed and transported separately. It took some 10‚Äì15 minutes to set the gun up for combat and up to 23 minutes to make it ready for transportation. Development and production history The gun resulted from a modernization of the 152-mm siege gun M1910, initially developed by Schneider. The upgrading project was prepared by the design bureau of the Main Artillery Directorate, its main purpose was to increase range. The changes included: *Lengthened chamber *Mounting of muzzle brake *Reduced (from 1,000 mm to 950 mm) recoil distance *The trail was lengthened (to 2 m) *Trunnion rings were moved 50 mm forward In 1930 the modernized gun was adopted as 152-mm gun model 1910/30 (). The production began in 1930 at Krasniy Putilovets plant. Later Barrikady and Bolshevik plants joined the production effort. In addition to newly built pieces, all existing M1910 guns were converted to the new standard; the conversion was finished by 1 November 1936. Since the upgrade of 1930 didn't address a problem of limited mobility, in 1934 additional modernization was performed, resulting in 152-mm gun M1910/34. In 1935 the production of M1910/30 was stopped. Organization and service According to RKKA organization, 152-mm guns were employed by corps artillery and by the Reserve of the Main Command, typically instead of 152-mm gun-howitzer M1937 (ML-20). Heavy gun regiments of Reserve of the Main Command had 24 pieces each. By the outbreak of the German-Soviet War RKKA possessed some 120-150 M1910/30s.121 according to http://www.soldat.ru/doc/mobilization/mob/table17.html, 150 according to Ivanov They undoubtfully saw combat in the war, though due to their limited number the details of their service are unknown. One piece was captured by the Finnish Army. That gun is currently on display in H√§meenlinna The Artillery Museum of Finland. The Germans assigned the M1910/30 the designation 15.2cm K 438(r). Summary The M1910/30 was a result of limited modernization of World War I era weapon, which didn't address its insufficient mobility (due to lack of suspension and separate transportation of barrel) and limited traverse. On the other hand, RKKA liked the ballistic characteristics of the gun. Subsequent modernizations, which concentrated mostly on the gun carriage, resulted in improved M1910/34 and eventually in the famous ML-20.

In 38 BC Octavian gave him the command of a fleet in the war against Sextus Pompeius during which he distinguished himself in battle in the waters around Sicily. In 36 BC he was given part of the army and managed to extricate his troops from a dangerous situation and unite them with Marcus Vipsanius Agrippa at Mylae. For these services he was rewarded with the consulship in 35 BC. It is said of Cornificius that he afterwards accustomed himself in Rome to ride home upon an elephant whenever he supped out.

It is one of the most renowned and oldest museum institutions in the world, originating from the collections of the Saxon electors in the 16th century. Today, the Dresden State Art Collections consists of fifteen museums. Most of them are located in the Dresden Castle, the Zwinger and the Albertinum.  History  The museums belonging to the Staatliche Kunstsammlungen Dresden originated from the collections of the Saxon electors, several of whom were also Kings of Poland. Historical sources show that August I, Elector of Saxony, founded the electoral Kunstkammer (literally ‚Äúart chamber‚Äù) in 1560, a collection of art located in the Dresden Castle. August the Strong and his son, August III, Kings of Poland, were important patrons and remarkable connoisseurs of the arts. They developed their art collections in a systematic fashion; in the process, they not only provided a foundation of extraordinary masterpieces for the Staatliche Kunstsammlungen Dresden, but also made these works accessible to select circles in their own time. The Staatliche Kunstsammlungen has been a state-owned enterprise since January 1, 2009. The association includes twelve museums which operate independently within the context of their own collection, but all share various institutions and facilities as well as a central administration.

In 1950 he was elected Secretary of the Staff Side of the Magistracy Division of the Civil Service and followed that in 1955 by being elected to the Executive of the Civil Service AssociationThe Civil Service Association changed its name to the Public Services Association in 1971(CSA) representing the Eastern Counties. He became the Assistant Secretary of the CSA in 1960 at a time when Hugh Harris was the President and O. E. Morle the Secretary. The CSA appointed Manswell as it first full-time General Secretary in 1961. In addition to his work for the CSA, he was also General Secretary of the Trinidad and Tobago Labour Congress and later its President. He was part of the workers delegation to the International Labour Conference of the International Labour Organization representing the Labour Congress in 1978 and on fourteen subsequent occasions. He was nominated by the Labour Congress to a number of State Boards including the T&T; Mortgage Finance Company and the Investment Committee of the National Insurance Board. In 1962 Manswell was one of the members of Prime Minister Eric Williams delegation to the Commonwealth Prime Ministers Conference as the nominee of the Labour Congress. The continued development of the CSA saw the organisation purchasing properties in Port of Spain, including the current Head Office in Abercromby Street,Named after Ralph Abercromby Port of Spain, in 1965. On being given a leave of absence from the Union in 1968, he successfully gained a Diploma of Social Studies at Oxford University and went on to complete the first year examination of the LLB Law Degree. His studies were interrupted by the death of the Union's President, Milton Adams, and in 1970 he returned to Trinidad and Tobago and his post in the Union. He was instrumental in the formation of the Caribbean Public Services Association, of which he became the General Secretary in August 1970 ‚Äì a position he held until his retirement from the Union in 1981. He was directly responsible for the formation of the Public Service Credit Union which survives to this day. Sir Ellis Clarke, then the President of the Republic of Trinidad and Tobago, appointed Manswell as an Independent Senator in 1976 and he remained in the Senate until his retirement from the Union. He retired from the Public Services Association (the successor to the CSA) in 1981 having reached the position of First Executive President. However, he became a consultant to the Union in 1997 representing them in a matter in the Industrial Court as late as 2006.

Sprague de Camp and Fletcher Pratt.Steinberg, Sybil S. (1997). \\"My Son, the Wizard: Book V of A Wizard in Rhyme\\". Publishers Weekly. 244:46. p60. A Wizard in Rhyme takes place in an alternate history of medieval Europe, featuring several geographical differences (most notably a land-bridge connecting Britain to the mainland) and two major supernatural differences: the existence of magic, which can be influenced by the speaking of rhymed verse; and the established and real presence of the Christian God and Devil, leading to a prevalence of Christian thought and morality. Geography The following are domains of the realms covered in the novel, with the approximate geographical counterparts in the real world. * Merovence: (France) When introduced in Book 1, it was ruled by recent usurper Astaulf, who shared power with his sorcerer-henchman Malingo. Merovence was, at the time, the last bastion of morality and Christianity within Europe, as its rightful ruler, the uncrowned Princess Alisande, was still devoted to good. Its patron saint, Saint Moncaire, took action to save it from destruction: he sent a magic spell, encrypted in the language of Merovence, out into the other universes; the first person to interpret it would be drawn into Merovence and help in the crusade against evil. That man was Matthew Mantrell. Its name is probably derived from the Merovingian line or from Merovech, and its capital is called Bordestang. * Ibile: (Spain/Portugal) When introduced in Book 2, it was ruled by sorcerer-king Gordogrosso, and then by Prince Rinaldo after The Gross One's defeat. The name Ibile seems to have been derived from Iberia, and its capital is called Orlequedrille. * Allustria: (Germany/Austria) When introduced in Book 3, it was ruled by the witch-queen Suettay, and an army of scribes in an extensive bureaucratic network. The name Allustria is either derived from Allemagne (French for Germany) combined with Austria or Austrasia. * Latruria: (Italy) When introduced in Book 4, it was ruled an evil sorcerer-king who was succeeded by his grandson, Boncorro. The name Latruria seems to have been derived from Latium combined with Etruria. Its capital is Venarra. * Bretanglia: (Britain) When introduced in Book 6, it was ruled by an ambitious king who was succeeded by Prince John then King Brion. The name Bretanglia seems to have been derived from Britain and Anglia, the medieval Latin name for England. Its capital is Dunlimon (a near-anagram of Londinium). * Erin: (Ireland) also known as the 'Isle of Doctors and Saints' in many of the previous books. Not much is known about Erin, other than druids live there. The name Erin is another name for Ireland. Note: There are some inconsistencies with the actual name of Britain and Ireland in the series. In book 4, Matthew mentions that the countries England, Scotland and Ireland are respectfully named Angland, Scotia and Erie, yet in Book 6 Britain is called \\"Bretanglia,\\" and Ireland, \\"Erin.\\" However, this may be Stasheff making reference to England and Scotland when referring to Angland and Scotia respectively, while Bretanglia refers to Great Britain as a whole.

Biography Madame Fraya would use a person's hand and handwriting to predict his/her future, but she admitted to not following the principles of traditional chiromancy, and just making use of her instinctual knowledge. Her clients included important French artists and politicians of the time, such as the Princess of Saxe-Meningen (sister of emperor Wilhelm II of Germany), to whom she reportedly predicted World War I and the defeat of Germany in it. She was subsequently called into the French Ministry of War, where she assured the government that the marching German troops would not reach Paris (they were in fact stopped at the First Battle of the Marne). The abilities displayed by Fraya were studied by Alfred Binet, Eug√©ne Osty, and Albert von Schrenck- Notzing. Biographer Simone de Tervagne has written several books about Fraya. Investigations In December 1929, Ant√¥nio da Silva Mello attended a psychic reading session with Madame Fraya. Mello brought with him some letters.Mello, Ant√¥nio da Silva. (1960). Mysteries and Realities of This World and the Next. Weidenfeld & Nicolson. pp. 58-70 Fraya made totally inaccurate statements about the letters, for example on studying a letter that Mello had written the same morning she stated it was written by someone else and gave excessively general characterisation details that would be applicable to most people. She said one of the letters had been written by a man but it had actually been written by a female relative of Mello. Fraya also gave many false statements to Mello. She said he was the father of two children when he did not have any. She examined his hand and stated he was thirty-two years old, although he was forty-three at the time. Mello noted that \\"the revelations obtained in my consultation with Madame Fraya were no more than vague generalities, which would be commonly applied to any person.\\" Mello also attended a session with Fraya in January, 1930. The result was a complete failure, she made many incorrect statements. Mello \\"left her office annoyed and disillusioned\\".

The Albany mail professionals recommended the dog to their Railway Mail Service colleagues, and he became a nationwide mascot for nine years (1888‚Äì97). He traveled throughout the 48 contiguous United States and voyaged around the world traveling over 140,000 miles in his lifetime as a mascot of the Railway Post Office and the United States Postal Service. He is best known for being the subject of commemorative activities, including a 2011 U.S. postage stamp. Story preserved body is on display at the Smithsonian National Postal Museum (NPM) in Washington, D.C. Unofficial mascot Owney belonged to a clerk at the Albany post office who would often come with him to work. Owney seemed to love the smell of the mail bags and would sleep on the bags. The clerk quit the Albany post office but knew that Owney was happier at the post office with the mail bags. Owney usually slept on the mail bags, and when they were moved, Owney went with them. He was considered to be good luck by postal railway clerks, since no train he rode on was ever in a wreck. He was a welcome addition in any railway post office; he was a faithful guardian of railway mail and the bags it was carried in, and would not allow anyone other than mail clerks to touch the bags. This was an important duty and Owney was well-situated for it, as the Albany train station was a key division point on the New York Central railroad system, one of the two largest railroads in the U.S. at that time. Mail trains from Albany rolled eastward to Boston, south to New York City, and westward to Buffalo, Cleveland, Toledo, Chicago, and points further west. As a contemporary book recounted: \\"The terrier 'Owney' travels from one end of the country to the other in the postal cars, tagged through, petted, talked to, looked out for, as a brother, almost. But sometimes, no matter what the attention, he suddenly departs for the south, the east, or the west, and is not seen again for months.\\" In 1893 he was feared dead after having disappeared, but it turned out he was involved in an accident in Canada. Owney with some of his dog tags Owney on mail pouch As Owney's trips grew longer, the postal clerks at Albany became concerned that the dog be identified, and, if necessary returned to them. They bought a dog collar with a metal tag that read: \\"Owney, Post Office, Albany, New York\\". To this collar, the various railway post offices that saw Owney added individual dog tags. The collar and tags made the mixed-breed terrier the unofficial mascot of the U.S. Railway Mail Service, and as shown by the 2011 postage stamp issued in his honor, his identifications became an essential element of his identity. Owney received tags everywhere he went, and as he moved they jingled like sleigh bells. He received from Winnona Kilbridge of the Los Angeles Kennel Club a medal for \\"Best Traveled Dog\\" of 1893.Wales, p. 20 Owney received in 1894 from a Mr. William Winter Wagner of Chicago a \\"Globe Trotter\\" medal.Wales, p. 21 His collection of tags grew so large that United States Postmaster General John Wanamaker gave him a coat to display them all. Wanamaker also announced that Owney was then the Official Mascot of the Rail Mail Service.Wales, p. 22 The actual number of dog tags and medals Owney received is unknown. Despite the jacket, the mass became impossible for the small dog to carry. Clerks would remove tags and forward them to Albany or Washington D.C. for safekeeping. One source suggests that 1,017 medals and tokens were bestowed upon the mascot. Some of these tags did not survive; the National Postal Museum currently has 372 Owney tags in its collections. Other Owney tokens, trinkets, and medals are also in the NPM collection and are displayed there. One of Owney's services \\"Above and Beyond the Call of Duty\\" reported is when he stayed behind to protect a mail pouch that had accidentally fallen out of a wagon during a delivery route he was on. When the clerks returned to the main Post Office after the deliveries, not only was a bag of mail missing but so was Owney. They backtracked their steps and eventually found Owney lying on top of the mailbag. Owney guarded the mail pouch until someone from the Post Office showed up.Wales, pp. 14‚Äì17 International mail One of his more famous trips was to Montreal, Quebec, Canada. There the postmaster kept him in a kennel. A demand was sent to Albany, New York for payment for the $2.50 that was incurred in feeding him. The sum was collected, and Owney was sent back home. The Universal Postal Union was created by treaty in 1874 to standardize the shipping and handling of international mail; adherence to this pact by an increasing number of countries around what was then called the \\"civilized world\\" made it possible to extend Owney's horizons a bit. In 1895, the terrier enjoyed an around-the-world trip, riding with mail bags aboard trains and steamships. Starting from Tacoma, Washington, on August 19, he traveled for four months throughout Asia and across Europe, before returning to New York City on December 23 and from thence to Albany. Upon his return during Christmas week, the Los Angeles Times reported that he visited Asia, North Africa, and the Middle East. Another report claimed the Emperor of Japan awarded the dog two passports and several medals bearing the Japanese coat of arms. Owney's triumphant return to American shores was covered by newspapers nationwide. Owney became world famous after the trip, even though he broke no speed records in doing it. Death and honors As Owney aged, Post Office management came to believe that his traveling days were over. Mail clerk J. M. Elben, of St. Louis, agreed to take him in, and the influential Chicago manager of the Railway Mail Service, using insulting language to refer to the \\"mongrel cur\\", asked his employees not to allow him to ride on future mail trains. Owney had by this time traveled more than in his lifetime. The exact details of the incident which led to Owney's death are unclear. Newspapers around the country carried the story of Owney's death. They reported that Owney had been ill and had become aggressive in his old age. In June 1897, after allegedly attacking a postal clerk and a U.S. Marshal in Toledo, Ohio, Owney was shot and killed on the orders of the local postmaster. The Chicago Tribune termed it \\"an execution\\". The contemporary accounts suggest that a postal clerk in Toledo chained Owney to a post in the corner of a basement at a post office in Toledo, which was not his normal treatment. That clerk then called in a reporter for the local paper to get a story. Owney may not have been used to that treatment and that may have contributed to his aggression. Whatever the reason, it is not disputed that Owney was put down in Toledo on 11 June 1897. Owney's death made public that a gap existed between the workplace attitudes of U.S. postal clerks and their management, with the deceased dog serving as a focus of this gap. The 1890s were a foundational decade for the new discipline of scientific management, with consultants like Frederick Winslow Taylor seeking to help managers reduce what they saw as industrial inefficiencies by examining workers' \\"wasted time\\" and \\"slacking\\". Postal clerks used Owney's death, and the expressions of sadness contained in press obituaries in honor of the dog, to make a statement: \\"Postal clerks refused to bury their beloved mascot. Clerks across the country asked that the dog receive the honor they considered he was due by being preserved and presented to the Post Office Department's headquarters.\\" Owney's remains were preserved and sent for taxidermy. In 1904, Owney's effigy was displayed by the Postal Service at the St. Louis World's Fair. A commemorative silver spoon was commissioned by Cleveland, Ohio postal workers and fashioned by \\"Webb C. Ball Co. Cleveland.O.\\" Owney is the subject of an exhibit at the Smithsonian Museum. He was sent there in 1911, and has been called one of the museum's \\"most interesting\\" artifacts.The Smithsonian has 137 million artifacts, works of art and specimens in its collection. His remains deteriorated over the intervening century, and were (along with associated artifacts) given an extensive makeover in 2011.The National Postal Museum is rated \\"worth a detour\\". One of the Smithsonian's employees opined the makeover a success, and called its culmination \\"the big reveal\\". Medals displayed on Owney at the National Postal Museum. On July 27, 2011, the United States Postal Service issued a forever stamp honoring Owney. Artist Bill Bond said he wanted to render the dog \\"in a spirited and lively\\" presentation, and that he wound up working from the mounted remains, as numerous trips to dog parks left him uninspired. Owney was also honored locally at the Albany, New York post office. The stamp was also central to an augmented reality app for Windows, Apple iPhone, iPad 2 and iPod Touch. Like his contemporary Australian counterpart Bob the Railway Dog active from 1881‚Äì1894 he was the subject of poetry. One was from a clerk in Detroit: :Owney is a tramp, as you can plainly see. :Only treat him kindly, and take him 'long wid ye.\\" Another was penned by a clerk in Minnesota: :\\"On'y one Owney, and this is he; :the dog is aloney, so let him be.\\" Owney has been the main character in five hardcover books, and one e-book published by the National Postal Museum (of the Smithsonian Institution) in 2012 titled, Owney: Tales from the Rails, written by Jerry Rees with songs by Stephen Michael Schwartz and illustrations by Fred Cline.

They feed by filtering sand through their mouthparts, leaving behind balls of sand that are disintegrated by the incoming high tide. Description Sand bubbler crabs are small crabs, around across the carapace, and they are characterised by the presence of \\"gas windows\\" on the merus of the legs; in Dotilla, these windows are also present on the thoracic sternites. A similar system has evolved in parallel in the porcelain crab genus Petrolisthes. Distribution Sand bubbler crabs are widespread across the Indo-Pacific region, where they occur abundantly on sandy beaches in the tropics and sub-tropics. Ecology and behaviour Scopimera globosa and the sand pellets it has made Sand bubbler crabs live in burrows in the sand, where they remain during high tide. When the tide is out, they emerge on to the surface of the sand, and pass the sand through their mouthparts, eating detritus and plankton, and discarding the processed sand as pellets, which cover the beach. The crabs work radially from the entrance to their burrows, which they re-enter as the tide rises and disintegrates the pellets. In each burrow, the crab waits out the high tide in a bubble of air. The material consumed by sand bubbler crabs has a very low concentration of organic matter, which is concentrated by egestion of indigestible material. Taxonomy Taxonomic history The first sand bubbler crab to be described was Cancer sulcatus (now Dotilla sulcata) by Peter Forssk√•l in 1775. The genus Scopimera was originally described as a subgenus of Ocypode by Wilhem de Haan in 1833, although the first species, Scopimera globosa was not validly described until 1835. At the same time, De Haan tried to erect the genus Doto for Forsk√•l's Cancer sulcatus, not realising that the name was preoccupied by the mollusc genus Doto. The first available name for that genus was published by William Stimpson in 1858, who called it Dotilla. Ongoing revisions are likely to split the current genus Scopimera into at least two genera. Species Eight species of Dotilla and fifteen of Scopimera are currently recognised: * Dotilla **Dotilla blanfordi Alcock, 1900 **Dotilla fenestrata Hilgendorf, 1869 **Dotilla intermedia De Man, 1888 **Dotilla malabarica Nobili, 1903 **Dotilla myctiroides (H.

Midstate Air Commuter (MAC)) was an airline with its headquarters in Stevens Point, Wisconsin.\\"World Airline Directory.\\" Flight International. March 30, 1985. 98. \\"Head Office: 3101 Dixon Street, Stevens Point, Wisconsin 54481, USA.\\" It was founded by Roy P. Shwery in 1964 and provided air service out of Marshfield, Wisconsin (home to Marshfield Clinic), and Central Wisconsin Airport (CWA). The airline originally operated a fleet of Beechcraft Model 18 aircraft, and later, four Beech 99's. The airline originally flew from Marshfield, to Wisconsin Rapids, to Milwaukee, and onto Chicago. (Central Wisconsin Airport serves the communities of Stevens Point, Wausau, Marshfield, and Wisconsin Rapids, Wisconsin, and the smaller suburbs‚ÄîMosinee, Plover, and Rosholt‚Äîwith long runways that accommodated large jet aircraft). By the early 1970s, Midstate also was serving Hayward and Ashland, Wisconsin from the Central Wisconsin Airport and Ashland from the Minneapolis - St. Paul International Airport. One of its most fondly-remembered features was the 6:00 PM \\"Champagne Flight\\" out of O'Hare, destined for Ashland via Milwaukee, the CWA, and Hayward. Shortly after takeoff from Milwaukee, the passengers were invited to open a cooler put on board in Milwaukee and prepared by Midstate's President's wife. Typically, in the cooler were a few soft drinks, beers, Wisconsin cheese, Pringle's Newfangled Potato Chips, plastic cups and . . . one or two bottles of champagne. Somehow, this ice-breaker generated an informality and good feeling for nearly everyone on board. Beech 99 twin turboprop 17-passenger aircraft of Midstate Airlines landing at Chicago O'Hare in December 1973. In 1977 Midstate switched to 19-passenger Swearingen Metroliners. On January 15, 1979, a Metroliner landed in Wisconsin Rapids, hydroplaned, swerved, and collided with a snowbank, resulting in 11 injuries (2 pilots, 9 passengers). Damage to the aircraft was substantial. Correction: snow storm with low visibility and no injuries. In its heyday, Midstate operated a fleet of 19 Metroliners and added six Fokker F27 50-passenger turboprop aircraft in 1984 (which required a flight attendant and a certificate modification under FAA part 121 rules), and flew to 15 cities in Wisconsin, Minnesota, Iowa, Missouri, Indiana, Michigan, Ohio, and Chicago O'Hare airport. The airline was purchased from Shwery by Sentry Insurance of Stevens Point, and subsequently resold to CEO and investor Bryce Appleton in 1986. In 1986, Midstate subleased Fokker F27 aircraft to Chicago Air, a start-up carrier operated a regional service out of Chicago Midway International Airport. Midstate provided maintenance services to Chicago Air out of Central Wisconsin. However, Chicago Air went into bankruptcy the same year, and Appleton purchased what remained of the Midstate's assets from Sentry Insurance. The Chicago O'Hare takeoff and landing slots were sold off and Appleton continued to operate the Swearingen Metroliners, establishing a hub in Milwaukee. However, the airline continued to cut back service, providing charter, ceasing operations in 1989.  Historical fleet  Midstate Airlines previously operated the following aircraft: *?

She has been widely honoured with a number of prizes and awards. In 1976, she was awarded Jnanpith Award and the Padma Shri by the Government of India; D.Litt. by the Universities of Jabalpur, Rabindra Bharati, Burdwan and Jadavpur. Vishwa Bharati University honoured her with Deshikottama in 1989. For her contribution as a novelist and short story writer, the Sahitya Akademi conferred its highest honour, the Sahitya Akademi Fellowship, in 1994. Biography Ashapurna Devi was born in a Baidya family. She was born on 8 January 1909, at her maternal uncle's home at Potoldanga in North Calcutta. Her ancestral village is Begumpur in Hooghly District. Her birth name was Asha Purna Devi (Gupta). Her early childhood was spent in a traditional and extremely conservative family at Vrindaban Basu Lane amongst a large number of relatives. Due to the domination of her grandmother, a staunch supporter of old customs and conservative ideals, the female children of the house were not allowed to go to school. Private tutors were employed only for the boys. It is said that as a baby Ashapurna used to listen to the readings of her brothers sitting opposite to them and that was how she learnt the alphabets. Ashapurna's father Harendra Nath Gupta was a famous artist of the time who worked for C. Lazarus & Co. fine furniture makers as a designer. Ashapurna's mother Sarola Sundari came from a very enlightened family and was a great book lover. It was her \\"intensive thirst\\" for reading classics and story books which was transmitted to Ashapurna and her sisters in their early age. Due to shortage of space, Harendra Nath shifted his family to a new house at 157/1A Acharya Prafulla Chandra Road (beside the Khanna Cinema Hall), which provided freedom to Sarola Sundari and her daughters to read according to their heart's desires. To satisfy Sarola Sundari's tremendous urge of reading there had been a continuous flow of books and magazines from the libraries of the time. As there was no dearth of leisure for the daughters and no bar to reading adult books from a very early age, Ashapurna and her sisters built a love- relationship with books. Though Ashapurna had no formal education as such, she was self-educated. The period in which Ashapurna was raised was socially and politically restless, a time of nationalist agitation and awakening. Though the children of Harendra Nath did not have direct contact with the outside world, they were quite sensitive to the restlessness going on throughout the country led by Mahatma Gandhi and other political leaders who were ready to sacrifice their lives to bring independence. Thus different factors were responsible for nourishing the specific culture which guided Ashapurna from her early childhood to youth, and carried her to a definite platform through various experiences and ideals of life. According to Ashapurna, she and her sisters used to compete with each other by composing and reciting poems. This gave rise to an unusual tenacity which inspired Ashapurna to secretly send a poem to Sishu Sathi in 1922. Ashapurna was thirteen and her poem \\"Bairer Dak\\" (The Call from the Outside) was published, with a request from editor Rajkumar Chakravorty to send more poems and stories. That was the beginning which developed into a never-ending flourish for Ashapurna, culminating into a permanent place for her into the realm of Bengali literature. Ashapurna was sent to be married in 1924 when she was fifteen years of age, leaving Calcutta for her betrothed's family residence in Krishnanagar. She was married to Kalidas Gupta, and the couple moved frequently as they established themselves. In 1927 they settled in Calcutta on Ramesh Mitra Road, Bhowanipur and later in a bigger house at 77 Beltola Road, where they lived until 1960. They then had to shift to a separate flat near Golpark with their only son Sushanta, daughter-in-law Nupur, and a granddaughter Shatarupa. Later, in 1967, another granddaughter, Shatadeepa, was added to the family. In 1970, Kalidas Gupta and Ashapurna built their own house in Garia at 17 Kanungo Park. Ashapurna lived there until she died on 13 July 1995. In the beginning of her writing career, Ashapurna wrote only for children - Chhoto Thakurdar Kashi Yatra (Great Uncle Goes to Varanasi) was the first printed edition published in 1938, followed by others throughout her literary career. In 1936 she first wrote a story for adults, \\"Patni O Preyoshi\\", published in the Puja issue of Ananda Bazar Patrika. Prem O Prayojan was her first novel for adults, published in 1944. Since this period, her writing continued as a never-ending process. Most of her writings marked a spirited protest both for men and women, against the inequality and injustice stemming from the gender-based discrimination and narrowness of outlook ingrained in traditional Hindu society. Ashapurna Devi's stories lay threadbare the oppression women have to face and made a fervent appeal for a new social order, though not subscribing to the modern theoretical feminism of western mode. Her magnum opus, the trilogy Pratham Pratishruti (1964), Subarnolata (1967) and Bakul Katha (1974), symbolises an endless struggle for women to achieve equal rights. Upon her death she was at the peak of her fame, leaving behind unique literary creations. Ashapurna Devi had been widely honoured with a number of prizes and awards, noted below.

It was the home ground of Walsall F.C. from 1896 until 1990, when the team moved to the Bescot Stadium. Fellows Park was situated about a quarter of a mile away from the club's present ground, The Bescot Stadium, at the junction of Hilary Street and Wallows Lane. The club moved to the ground from West Bromwich Road in 1896. Until 1930 it was named Hilary Street, at which point it was renamed after H.L. Fellows, a club director. Walsall's record home attendance was at Fellows Park, when 25,453 spectators were present for the team's Second Division match against Newcastle United on 29 August 1961. By March 1988, the club was planning to build a new stadium at nearby Bescot Crescent. Within two years, construction work was underway at the new stadium site and the last league game at Fellows Park was played on 1 May 1990, when Walsall, in the process of their second successive relegation which took them into the Football League Fourth Division, drew 1‚Äì1 at home to Rotherham United, with Andy Dornan scoring the last league goal at the ground ‚Äì his only goal in his time at Walsall. The final game played at the ground was on 11 May 1990, when retiring defender Peter Hart's testimonial was held there with local rivals West Bromwich Albion providing the opposition. This game also ended in a 1‚Äì1 draw, with Gary Shaw scoring an equaliser for Walsall in the 37th minute, thus going down in history as the last player to score at the stadium, in its 94-year history. The new Bescot Stadium was ready for the 1990‚Äì91 season. A reminder of Fellows Park remains in the new stadium, in the name of the H.L. Fellows Stand. The old stadium was demolished in early 1991 and a Morrisons supermarket built on the site. In December 1990, several weeks before the stadium's demolition, heavy snow caused the roof of the \\"cowshed\\" section of the stadium to collapse. References Category:Walsall Category:Walsall F.C.

The carrier operated revenue service from May to November, 1986 between Chicago and Madison, Green Bay, LaCrosse, Eau Claire, and Wausau, WI; Traverse City, MI; and, Peoria, Springfield and Quad Cities, IL. It operated six Fokker F27 turboprop aircraft, and the call sign was \\"Wild Onion\\" in reference to the Chippewa Indian derivation of the name \\"Chicago.\\" The Fokker aircraft were subleased from Midstate Airlines of Stevens Point, Wisconsin, which also performed contract maintenance work on the aircraft at their Central Wisconsin Airport facility. Chicago Air had been working closely for two years with Saab Aircraft of Link√∂ping, Sweden to acquire initially 10 Saab SF-340 turboprop commuter aircraft, which would have begun delivery in 1987 enabling expansion of services to Des Moines, Cedar Rapids, and Waterloo, IA; South Bend, Ft. Wayne, Lafayette, and Evansville, IN; and Kalamazoo and Grand Rapids, MI. Chicago Air held a further option for 16 of the SF-340 aircraft, which would have enabled the carrier to expand services to additional markets in Michigan, Ohio, Missouri and Minnesota. In addition to its low-fare cachet and connections at convenient Midway Airport, Chicago Air introduced several important service improvements to the regional airline industry, including quality complimentary meal service, premium regional beers, wine and cocktails, national and regional newspapers, and many other innovative ground and in-flight seating and amenities. The introduction of non-refundable fares by all competitive carriers and dramatically increased competitive advertising and promotions during the 1986 summer season made the Chicago Air venture a short-lived enterprise. It ceased service in November, 1986, when Midstate Airlines discontinued the subleasing agreement with Chicago Air for Fokker F27 aircraft, as well as use of the maintenance facilities. Soon after, Midway Airlines launched the successful regional \\"Midway Connection\\" service operated by Fischer Brothers Aviation with the smaller Dornier 228. The airline was led by Neal F. Meehan (President), former president of Continental Express Airlines and of New York Air; and by J. Scott Christian (Executive V.P.), a former senior manager at Continental Airlines; Booz Allen Hamilton; and New York Air. Meehan and Christian together controlled 50 percent of the carrier's voting stock, with the remaining shares held mostly by a small group of Chicago area investors.

He wrote Clemencia (1869), which is often considered to be the first modern Mexican novel. Biography Altamirano in his youth Altamirano was born in Tixtla, Guerrero, of indigenous Chontal heritage.http://web.uaemex.mx/identidad/docs/cronicas/TOMO_XII/INSTITUTO_CIENTIFICO.pdf His father was the mayor of Tixtla, this allowed Ignacio to attend school there. He later studied in Toluca thanks to a scholarship that was granted him by Ignacio Ram√≠rez, of whom he was a disciple. As a liberal politician, Altamirano opposed Benito Ju√°rez's continuation in office in 1861, allying himself with other liberal foes of Ju√°rez and supporting Jes√∫s Gonz√°lez Ortega.Brian Hamnett, Ju√°rez, New York: Longmans 1994,128. With the French invasion of Mexico in 1862, Altamirano understood how dire the situation was for Mexico, since unlike the U.S. invasion (1846‚Äì48), which united Mexicans against the invader, the French were supported by Mexican conservatives.Hamnett, Ju√°rez, p. 178. His best-known novel is El Zarco, which is set in Yautepec, Morelos during the Reform War of 1857‚Äì1860. It tells the story of an honorable and courageous Indian blacksmith who falls in love with a haughty village girl, only to have her elope with the cold-blooded bandit, \\"Zarco Blue Eyes.\\"https://www.powells.com/book/el-zarco-the-blue-eyed-bandit- episodes-of-mexican-life-between-1861-1863-9780930829612 accessed 4 January 2019 He founded several newspapers and magazines including El Correo de M√©xico (\\"The Mexico Post\\"), El Renacimiento (\\"The Renaissance\\") (1869), El Federalista (\\"The Federalist\\"), La Tribuna (\\"The Tribune\\") and La Rep√∫blica (\\"The Republic\\").

The temple is built on rocky hills known as Yadavagiri or Yadugiri, overlooking the Kaveri valley. It is about from Mysore and from Bangalore. Temple Complex The temple is lined with carved pillars and features a dome-like top decorated with highly detailed sculptures. The presiding deity is Cheluvanarayana Swamy, also known as UnggasuWiili (‡≤§‡≤ø‡≤∞‡≥Å‡≤®‡≤æ‡≤∞‡≤æ‡≤Ø‡≤£) or Cheluvapille Raya (‡≤ö‡≥Ü‡≤≤‡≥Å‡≤µ‡≤™‡≤ø‡≤≤‡≥ç‡≤≤‡≥Ü ‡≤∞‡≤æ‡≤Ø), a form of Lord Vishnu. It is known from the inscriptions that the Lord was also known by the name 'Ramapriya' in the early centuries. However, the usage of this name has completely disappeared since then. The utsavamurthi (‡≤â‡≤§‡≥ç‡≤∏‡≤µ ‡≤Æ‡≥Ç‡≤∞‡≥ç‡≤§‡≤ø,) which is a metal idol sculpture used for processions and certain religious rituals, represents the deity Cheluvanarayana Swamy. According to the legend, this metallic figure was once lost, but was recovered by Sri Ramanujacharya. The annual report of the Mysore Archaeological Department states that based on the strength of epigraphic evidence, the presiding deity of this temple was already a well-known object of worship even before Sri Ramanujacharya was worshiped at the shrine during the December 1098 CE period. This was also before Sri Ramanujacharya ventured to the Mysore region where he most likely would have used his influence to rebuild or renovate the temple. From the lithic records of the period, the existence of Tamil influence and Vaishnava worship are also evident. The temple is richly endowed, having enjoyed the special patronage of the Rajas of Mysore. As early as 1614, King Raja Wodeyar I (r.1578‚Äì1617), who first acquired Srirangapatna and accepted the Srivaishnava pontiff as his guru, was handed over to the temple and to the Brahmins at Melkote, the estate granted to him by Vijayanagar Emperor Venkatapati Raya. While that estate was lost when Zamindari was abolished in the 1950s, the temple still possesses many properties and valuables, particularly, an extremely valuable collection of jewels. On one of the pillars of navaranga of the Narayanaswami temple is a bas-relief about one and a half feet high, of Raja Wodeyar, standing with folded hands, with his name inscribed on the base. He was said to have been a great devotee of the presiding deity and a frequent visitor to the temple. A golden crown set with precious jewels was presented by him to the temple. This crown is known as the Raja-mudi (royal crown), a play on the name of Raja Wodeyar, the donor. According to legend, King Raja Wodeyar was observed entering the sanctum sanctorum of the Lord on the day of his death and vanished. From the inscriptions on some of the gold jewels and on gold and silver vessels in the temple, it is learned that they were presents from Krishnaraja Wadiyar III and his queens. Krishnaraja Wodeyar III also presented to the temple a crown set with precious jewels. It is known after him as Krishnaraja-mudi. The Vairamudi (\\"diamond crown\\"), another crown of great value, seems to be older than the Raja-mudi and the Krishnaraja-mudi. However, it is not known who presented it to the temple. Before the year 1098, British rulers claimed it for themselves. After 1098, ramanujacharya recovered it from Sir Cardi ruler's daughter Ammavaru at the bottom of Cheluvanarayana Swamy foot. Viremudi that is a diamond crown given to the temple by Srikrishna, Balarama, and gharuthmanthudu. All three crowns are kept in the safe custody of the Government and are brought to the temple on a specific annual occasion to adorn the image of Cheluvanarayana Swamy. The Vairamudi festival, which is the chief annual celebration is attended by more than 400,000 people.

After the war, he became a neurosurgeon and a political figure in France, who argued for the political rights of Algerian Muslims. Early life He was born in Algiers, capital of Algeria into a Jewish family. His mother, Berthe B√©nichou-Aboulker, was a celebrated poet and playwright. His father, Henri Aboulker, was a surgeon and professor in the Faculty of Medicine in Algiers. The Benichou family was one of the great Jewish families of Oran, where they owned a famous villa, equipped with its own synagogue. The Aboulker family of Algiers originated in Spain and, over the centuries, has included numerous scholars, rabbis, merchants and physicians. A medical student at the outbreak of World War II, Aboulker was mobilized in April 1940 as an officer cadet. He was demobilized in February 1941. Algerian Resistance In September 1940, Aboulker founded a resistance network in Algiers, in partnership with his cousin Roger Carcassonne who had done the same at Oran, and Aboulker subsequently became one of the main leaders of the resistance movement in pro- Nazi Vichy Algeria. The two cousins met Henri d'Astier de la Vigerie, with whom they prepared to support the expected Allied landings in North Africa, in collaboration with Colonel Germain Jousse and the U.S. Consul Robert Murphy, President Roosevelt's representative in Algiers. The headquarters for the preparation were at his father's house at 26 Rue Michelet. On 23 October 1942, Aboulker was among the resistance leaders who met with General Mark Clark in Vichy Morocco. The Americans agreed to supply weapons and radios, which were landed on 5 November.Martin Gilbert, 'The Holocaust' (1986), page 482. On the night of the Allied landings in North Africa, 7 November 1942, Aboulker led the occupation of the main strategic points in Algiers by 400 members of the Resistance, seizing the central police station, with his deputy Bernard Karsenty and the help of Guy Calvet and Superintendent Achiary. Led by their group leaders, all of the Resistance fighters, with the exception of the reserve officers, neutralized the command centers, occupied strategic positions, and stopped the military officials and civilian supporters of the Vichy government, starting with General General Alphonse Juin, the Commander- in-chief, and Admiral Admiral Fran√ßois Darlan. In the morning, when the XIXth Army Corps of the Vichy Government tried to mobilize to oppose the Allied landings, it had to concentrate its efforts on the Resistance fighters rather than Allied forces. With the landings around Algiers having been completed, Aboulker‚Äîanxious not to spill French blood‚Äîasked the group leaders to evacuate their positions. Using Resistance fighters from the evacuated positions, he organized with the group leader Captain Pillafort barricades to hinder the mobilization of the Vichy military. As a result, the forces of the Vichy government did not attack by that evening the central police station, the last place with insurgents. The confusion created by the so-called \\"putsch\\" of 8 November 1942 helped the Allies land almost without opposition and then encircle Algiers. Admiral Darlan surrendered Algiers that afternoon, and Allied troops entered the city at 8 pm. On 24 December 1942, Darlan, who had named himself High Commissioner and maintained Vichy policies with the support of General General Henri Giraud, was killed by a 20-year-old monarchist, Fernand Bonnier de La Chapelle, who was executed on 26 December. Giraud succeeded Darlan and ordered the arrest of Aboulker and 26 other Resistance leaders for complicity in Darlan's assassination, and they were immediately deported to prison camps in southern Algeria. Metropolitan Resistance Freed following the Casablanca Conference in 1943, Aboulker travelled to London in May 1943 and joined the Free French. In October of that year, he was sent secretly into occupied France, as someone \\"responsible for the organization of the health service of the Resistance movement\\", preparing for the Liberation. There, he led operations parachuting surgical equipment into France. Back in London in June 1944, he returned to Algiers, where he had his medical school viva. In August 1944, he left for a new mission in the south of France, to install prefects at Toulouse, Limoges, and Clermont-Ferrand. Peacetime Aboulker was the representative of the Resistance in Vichy Algeria at the French Committee of National Liberation in Paris from 1944 to 1945. He proposed changing the electoral law in French Algeria to allow the election of native Muslim deputies, who had never previously been admitted. The proposal was adopted. After the war, Aboulker joined the French Communist Party, and in 1946 he resumed his medical studies. He passed the internal examinations at the American Hospital of Paris and finally became a professor of neurosurgery. He committed himself to Algeria's independence and opposed the return of General de Gaulle as head of the French government in 1958. Taking into account de Gaulle's role in dismantling the French empire, including Algeria, Aboulker voted in 1965 for his reelection as President of the Republic. He belonged to the emergency medical service set up for the president of the Republic following the assassination attempt made at Le Petit-Clamart. In June 1999, Aboulker became a member of the Liberation Council. He died on 17 November 2009.Jos√© Aboulker (1920-2009) Berhouma, Moncef.

The government had appointed a commission to inquire into the farmers' grievances and the Rewa farmers wanted to send a representative to it. The union was led by Ram Krishna Chaudhary with Faiz Mohammed as Secretary. From 1946, the union worked closely with a second union established in the Rewa cane growing area, the Southern Division Kisan Sangh under the leadership of Vishnu Deo. This co- operation was a far cry from the rivalry that existed between the Kisan Sangh and Maha Sangh, the two major unions in the Western Division. The Rewa Planters Union took an active role in the negotiations for the 1950 cane contract. With the closure of the Nausori sugar mill in 1959, the union ceased to exist.

He founded the International Tea Company's Stores, became the first chairman of the Port of London Authority, and served as Minister of Food Control during World War I. Early life and business career Devonport was the tenth and youngest child of George Ewbanke Kearley (1814‚Äì1876) and his wife, Mary Ann Hudson. He studied at Surrey County School (now Cranleigh School) and joined Tetley & Sons in 1872. In 1876, Devonport founded a tea importing company, known as Kearley and Tonge from 1887, and began retailing his own goods in 1878. In 1890, he had over 200 branches trading as International Stores and in 1895, both companies were combined to form International Tea Company's Stores and shares were offered to the public. Marriage and family Hudson Kearley married Selina Chester in 1888. They had three children: daughter Beryl, and sons Gerald, 2nd Viscount Devonport, and Mark. Public service Hudson Kearley c1895 Devonport was elected as a Liberal Member of Parliament for Devonport in the 1892 general election. He was appointed a deputy lieutenant of Buckinghamshire in 1901. In 1903, he was appointed Parliamentary Secretary to the Board of Trade, assisting the President of the Board of Trade, David Lloyd George. He was created a baronet, of Wittington in the Parish of Medmenham in the County of Buckingham, on 22 July 1908 and became a member of the Privy Council in 1909. He retired from the lower house after the January 1910 general election. He played an important part in the passage of the Port of London Bill in 1908 and served as unpaid chairman of the Port of London Authority from 1909 until 1925. He was elevated to the peerage as Baron Devonport, of Wittington in the County of Buckingham on 15 July 1910. It was reported in The New York Times that he declined to contribute to party funds in turn for the peerage, feeling that his party contribution and unpaid services in relation to the Port of London were great enough to warrant the distinction without payment. After proposing to submit the related correspondence to the press, no money was exchanged. This did not save him from being the subject of a savage epigram by Hilaire Belloc: The grocer Hudson Kearley, he When purchasing his barony Considered first, we understand, The title of Lord Sugarsand, Or then again he might have been Lord Underweight of Margarine: But being of the nobler sort He took the title Devonport. He was appointed as Minister of Food Control in December 1916 by Lloyd George and he submitted a proposal for compulsory rationing in May 1917, seemingly delayed as to protect the interests of retailers. He came under attack, particularly from Noel Pemberton Billing, with insinuations of war profiteering. On 1 June 1917 he resigned due to \\"ill health\\".Devonport resigns due to 'ill-health' The Times 2 June 1917 Announced in the 1917 Birthday Honours he was created Viscount Devonport, of Wittington in the County of Buckingham on 22 June 1917.

It exists in seven different unconnected segments that total in length, acting as connecting roads, neighborhood streets, and arterial routes. Approximately of Galloway Road, between Pinecrest and Doral, is designated as State Road 973. Route description Southern sections Galloway Road, or locally Southwest 87th Avenue (south of Flagler Street), begins at a dead- end across the Black Creek Canal from the Black Point Marina, next to Biscayne National Park, just over a mile south of the town of Cutler Bay in unincorporated Miami-Dade county. After following the canal northwest as a two-laned road for about half a mile, Southwest 87th Avenue turns north and takes on this alignment until the northern reaches of Kendall. As it continues north through undeveloped mangrove forest, Galloway Road parallels a drainage canal to its left, with both the road and canal crossing into Cutler Bay at Southwest 232nd Street. Galloway Road reaches suburbia by Southwest 216th Street, still with the canal beside it as it travels north, passing by schools, gated condominium communities and the backs of residential neighborhoods. A small leftwards chicane on Southwest 87th Avenue marks the northern end of the canal, with the road soon crossing Old Cutler Road and entering older residential neighborhoods on the other side. Although houses now have frontage onto Galloway Road, the road retains an open feel as it passes by retirement communities and a nature preserve. More houses line Galloway Road as it continues north, crossing into the village of Palmetto Bay at Eureka Drive (Southwest 184th Street). The village retains the same residential character as Galloway Road continues north to a roundabout at Richmond Drive (Southwest 168th Street). North of here, Galloway Road continues for one block where its southernmost section terminates at a T-intersection, with the bulk of traffic encouraged to turn left and travel westward along Southwest 164th Street. On the other side of Canal C-100 from the previous T-intersection, Galloway Road/Southwest 87th Avenue resumes at Southwest 163rd Terrace on the same alignment as a two-laned residential road. As it nears Southwest 144th Street, Galloway Road passes a medical centre and then, as it continues north, it becomes a residential street, losing its centre-line markings. It becomes little more than a laneway north of Southwest 141st Street, providing rear access to a condominium community, and terminates at another canal. Southwest 87th Avenue resumes on the same alignment as a two-laned street approximately to the north in south-eastern Kendall, on the other side of a shopping mall from the South Dixie Highway (US 1) and the South Miami-Dade Busway at Southwest 134th Street, travelling two blocks north to Southwest 132nd Street where it gains the State Road 973 designation. State Road 973 section SR 973 southbound just south of Sunset Drive and north of the Snapper Creek Expressway (overhead), July 2008 For the most part, State Road 973 follows Galloway Road/Southwest 87th Avenue north from the south-western end of the Pinecrest‚ÄìKendall boundary to the State Road's terminus in Doral; however, as Galloway Road has no direct access to US 1, SR 973 begins at the intersection of US 1 and Southwest 132nd Street and travels northwest to Galloway Road, crossing the Busway in the process. Here, properly now in Kendall, the four-laned State Road becomes divided by a median turn lane as it turns north at the intersection and travels past light industry, dropping back to a two-laned road on the northern side of Southwest 128th Street where it enters residential neighborhoods. After crossing Southwest 112th Street (SR 990) a mile (1.6 km) later, SR 973 continues north past more houses for another until it crosses Southwest 94th Street, where it passes by a mixture of condominiums and medical service buildings near the Baptist Hospital of Miami. In this neighborhood, Galloway Road chicanes to the right and immediately meets Kendall Drive (SR 94), expanding to a four-laned divided road and taking on its ultimate alignment. North of SR 94, Galloway Road passes by more houses and crosses the Snapper Creek Canal, leaving Kendall and forming the boundary between Sunset and Glenvar Heights, which lie to the west and east of SR 973 respectively. A few blocks of houses later, Galloway Road interchanges with the overhead Snapper Creek Expressway (SR 878). SR 973 continues for another half-mile (0.8 km) north past a mixture of commercial and residential uses, intersects with Sunset Drive (SR 986), then continues through more of the same for another until it passes under the Don Shula Expressway, crossing a CSX railroad between the two flyover bridges. There is no interchange between SR 973 and the expressway. To the north of the expressway, Galloway Road forms the boundary between Sunset and Olympia Heights as it passes housing on its right and a string of Miami-Dade County facilities on its left, including a water treatment plant, cemetery and emergency services. As it crosses Southwest 56th Street, SR 973 properly enters Olympia Heights and resumes its residential feel. later, Galloway Road intersects Bird Road (SR 976) amidst shopping malls and crosses into Westchester. Between Southwest 32nd and 28th Streets, SR 973 passes two Roman Catholic high schools and a seminary; it then intersects Coral Way (Southwest 24th Street) a few blocks later again amidst shopping malls. The pattern repeats one mile (1.6 km) later at SR 973's intersection with the Tamiami Trail (US 41). Here, Galloway Road enters Fontainebleau, immediately crosses the Tamiami Canal and continues for another half-mile (0.8 km) past condominiums to intersect Flagler Street and the western terminus of SR 968. North of baseline Flagler Street, Galloway Road is designated Northwest 87th Avenue. Past Flagler, SR 973 expands to six lanes and continues past more condominium complexes for another , whereupon it reaches the Dolphin Expressway (SR 836). Passing under it and entering the city of Doral, SR 973 terminates a mere past the expressway at Northwest 12th Street; however, Galloway Road/Northwest 87th Avenue continues north, picking up the County Road 973 designation for its next . Northern sections Beyond Northwest 12th Street, Galloway Road crosses a CSX branch railroad line and then travels through a large business precinct punctuated by big-box retail, restaurants and office buildings until it reaches Doral Boulevard, where the CR 973 designation ends. Past here, Galloway Road narrows to four lanes before passing the Doral Golf Resort & Spa. Opposite the resort, the neighborhood becomes increasingly industrial as Northwest 87th Avenue continues north, crossing to both sides of the road beyond Northwest 58th Street. Here, Galloway Road leaves Doral and enters unincorporated Miami-Dade County with no designated communities, and loses its central divider. Soon, Galloway Road passes the former Northwest 58th Street Landfill to its left with more industrial buildings to its right until the road reaches Northwest 74th Street. North of here, Northwest 87th Avenue quickly drops to a dirt access road for a construction company, becoming private soon afterwards. This is the last segment to be named Galloway Road. Northwest 87th Avenue resumes north of the private property in Medley as a paved industrial side-street between Northwest 90th and 93rd Streets, whereupon it terminates once more. A second section, little more than an industrial laneway, starts across the nearby Florida East Coast Railway tracks and travels north for a few blocks, terminating at the Miami Canal. The road then resumes at the frontage road for Okeechobee Road (US 27) across the canal in Hialeah Gardens, between its city hall and a Brothers to the Rescue memorial. After crossing SR 932 at an oblique junction, becoming four lanes wide and then crossing a canal, the road forms the boundary between Hialeah Gardens to the west and Hialeah to the east, gaining the additional moniker of West 28th Avenue for its duration through the city. Following a canal north on its left side with condominiums and a shopping mall to its right, the road enters Hialeah proper at West 68th Street (Northwest 122nd Street). West 28th Avenue, still with the canal to its west, passes by tightly packed single-storey houses, then some shops before leaving Hialeah over Interstate 75, just west of its terminus, and entering the town of Miami Lakes. Northwest 87th Avenue passes by residential neighborhoods before terminating at Miami Lakes Drive/Northwest 154th Street. The northernmost section of Northwest 87th Avenue begins as a laneway just to the south of Northwest 164th Street, still in Miami Lakes, across an undeveloped field from the next southerly segment of the road. As it passes Northwest 164th Street, the road expands to a divided four-laned road; however, the southbound carriageway of Northwest 87th Avenue is closed to traffic and is not present north of Northwest 166th Terrace, rendering the road as a two-laned residential street. The road leaves Miami Lakes at Northwest 170th Street and, still as a residential street, it forms the western boundary of Palm Springs North. It passes by the backs of residential neighborhoods until reaching Miami Gardens Drive (SR 860) a mile (1.6 km) later, and expands to four lanes once more as it passes between two shopping malls, re-entering unincorporated Miami-Dade County. After passing by more residential neighborhoods, Northwest 87th Avenue reaches its northern terminus at an incomplete T-junction with Northwest 197th Terrace, traffic being guided around eastwards into that road. History Galloway Road was part of a collection of Dade (now Miami-Dade) County streets that the Florida Department of Transportation added to its maintenance list in 1980: it was originally assigned the State Road 915 designation, but in 1983, the number was changed to SR 973 as part of a statewide renumbering. In 2009, the Federal Highway Administration reported that the road was \\"unsafe\\" for travel and had recently caused multiple deaths from accidents on State Road 973.

It was released as A Day in the Country in the United States. The film is based on the short story \\"Une partie de campagne\\" (1881) by Guy de Maupassant, who was a friend of Renoir's father, the renowned painter Auguste Renoir. It chronicles a love affair over a single summer afternoon in 1860 along the banks of the Seine. Renoir never finished filming due to weather problems, but producer Pierre Braunberger turned the material into a release in 1946, ten years after it was shot. Joseph Burstyn released the film in the U.S. in 1950. Plot Monsieur Dufour (Andr√© Gabriello), a shop-owner from Paris, takes his family for a day of relaxation in the country. When they stop for lunch at the roadside restaurant of Poulain (Jean Renoir), two young men there, Henri (Georges D'Arnoux) and Rodolphe (Jacques B. Brunius), take an interest in Dufour's daughter Henriette (Sylvia Bataille) and wife Madame Dufour (Jane Marken). They scheme to get the two women off alone with them. They offer to row them along the river in their skiffs, while they divert Dufour and his shop assistant and future son-in-law, Anatole (Paul Temps), by lending them some fishing poles. Though Rodolphe had arranged beforehand to take Henriette, Henri maneuvers it so that she gets into his skiff. Rodolphe then good-naturedly settles for Madame Dufour. As Henri rows, Henriette expresses her enthusiasm for the countryside. Henri suggests that she could come visit again, on her own, by train if necessary, and offers to meet her. Henriette says that her father would never permit it. Henri rows to a secluded spot on the riverbank which he refers to as his \\"private office\\". Henriette initially resists his amorous advances, but stops struggling after a moment. A rainstorm that has been threatening all afternoon arrives, but the party's return to the inn is not depicted. Title cards indicate that years have passed and that Henriette has married Anatole. One day, they end up at the place where Henri seduced Henriette. While Anatole dozes, his wife takes a walk, and encounters Henri. With tears in her eyes, she reminisces about their brief time together. Then, when Anatole wakes up, Henri hides until they leave.

The New York Times named three of her books on its \\"Notable Books of the Year\\" list. In addition, The Guardian named her book, Odd Girls and Twilight Lovers, one of the Top 10 Books of Radical History. She was a professor of English at California State University, Fresno (Fresno State), which bestowed her emeritus status, and a visiting professor at University of California, Los Angeles (UCLA). She retired from academe in 2007. Faderman has been referred to as \\"the mother of lesbian history\\" for her groundbreaking research and writings on lesbian culture, literature, and history. Early life Faderman was raised by her mother, Mary, and her aunt, Rae. In 1914, her mother emigrated from a shtetl in Latvia to New York City, planning eventually to send for the rest of the family. Her aunt Rae came in 1923, but the rest of the family was killed during Hitler's extermination of European Jews, and Mary blamed herself for not being able to rescue them. Her guilt contributed to a serious mental illness that would profoundly affect her daughter. Mary and Rae, Faderman's mother and aunt, worked in the garment industry for very little money. Lillian was her mother's third pregnancy; her mother (unmarried) aborted the first two pregnancies at Lillian's biological father's request, but insisted on bearing and raising the third. Mary married when Lillian was a teenager and died in 1979, continuing to have a profound influence on her daughter‚Äôs life. Education Faderman studied first at the University of California, Berkeley and later at UCLA. Personal life Her family moved with her to Los Angeles where, with her mother‚Äôs encouragement, Lillian took acting classes. She began modeling as a teenager, discovered the gay bar scene, and eventually met her first girlfriend. Before she graduated from high school, she married a gay man much older than herself‚Äîa marriage that lasted less than a year. Faderman came out as lesbian in the 1950s. She lives with her partner of forty years (as of 2012), Phyllis Irwin. She has one son, Avrom, who earned a PhD from Stanford University.

From a modest start made by a small group of parents in 1977, Education Otherwise (EO) has grown to become a well respected and vibrant registered charity, supporting and advising home educating families in England and Wales. The name 'Education Otherwise' comes from the Education Act, which states that parents are responsible for their children's education, ‚Äòeither by regular attendance at school or otherwise‚Äô and the Charity works to raise public awareness of the fact that education is compulsory, but school is not. Education Otherwise's aim is to support and promote parents‚Äô rights to provide their children with the best education for each of them, as individuals. Origins In 1972, Royston Lambert, head of Dartington Hall School asked Dick Kitto, who had been working there since 1955, to set up a project in conjunction with Northcliffe School to provide education for a group of non-academic students who would have to take another year in school due to the pending raising of the school leaving age.Duane, Michael. The Terrace: An Educational Experiment in a State School. Freedom Press. 1995. Kitto established a free school or democratic school model for the running of the project and was impressed by the qualities of the students even though they had effectively unschooled themselves within the school system, where they were perceived as trouble makers.Interview with Dick Kitto, Education Otherwise Newsletter (Number 61), August 1988 Kitto's school caught the attention of Stan Windass, who had been working for a children's rights centre in London, through which he had become aware of several families who were educating their own children. Windass had just taken the lease of Lower Shaw Farm and wanted to establish it as a centre to explore ideas for an alternative society. Windass asked Kitto to become the warden at Lower Shaw Farm after the Northcliffe School project ended. Kitto was familiar with ideas about unschooled education through reading John Holt and Joy Baker's Children in Chancery' in 1964 (now out of print), together with his experiences at the Northcliffe School project. He and Windass were able to contact several families who were educating otherwise and arranged an informal network and occasional meetings, during 1975 and 1976. During 1976, Granada Television made a programme about the group which resulted in around 200 enquiries and expanded the membership to over 50. In September 1976 the group was established on a more formal basis. In 1977, Kitto presented a BBC TV Open Door programme about the ideas behind the organisation. This resulted in over 2,000 enquiries and increased the membership to around 250.A tribute to Dick Kitto, Education Otherwise Newsletter (Number 130), October 1999 - citing obituaries from the Daily Telegraph and The Guardian newspapers. Original EO logo The original logo (based on a UK traffic sign) was intended to represent a child breaking out of the confines of school, and pointing toward a different way. In recent years the logo has been the subject of criticism, as it is viewed as divisive and the meaning misconstrued. A modernisation and rebranding in 2020 has resulted in a new logo being designed through a design competition, which has a more modern and acceptable appearance.

Greacen started his career as a youth player with Rangers, before making his first competitive appearances with Airdrieonians. Following only three league games, he was signed by the at-the- time Scottish Premier League side Livingston where he spent most of his time on loan at Queen of the South and Morton. After leaving Livi, he played for Forfar Athletic before moving on to become captain at Morton where he had previously been on loan. Career Born in Lanark, Greacen began his senior career at now defunct Airdrieonians and from there he moved to Livingston. Livingston then sent him on loan to Queen of the South and Greenock Morton, where he played in the team that was relegated from the Scottish Second Division in the 2001‚Äì02 season. Livingston released Greacen in 2003 and he was immediately signed by Forfar Athletic. He played the second half of the 2002‚Äì03 season at Forfar on a short-term contract. At the end of the season Forfar offered Greacen a long-term deal which he rejected in favour of a deal at Morton. The main reason for this was that Morton offered a full-time contract in comparison to Forfar's part-time contract. Greacen plays at centre back in the Morton defence. He is a tall commanding defender with a strong physical presence. He is good in the air and this helps in both an attacking and defensive way as he often scores from headers at set pieces. At 24 years old, Greacen became Greenock Morton's captain. In May 2008, it was announced that Greacen had rejected a new contract from Morton and was being tracked by rival Scottish First Division sides Dunfermline Athletic, Queen of the South and Livingston. Greacen was Morton's Player of the Year for 2008‚Äì2009. On 22 December 2010, Greacen was released by Morton after nearly 250 appearances over two spells from the club. He was on trial at Dundee, where he was eligible to play in a maximum of three league games ‚Äì he however could not be signed due to their current transfer embargo. He, therefore, chose the safe option of playing in the Airtricity Premier League with championship favourites Derry City hoping to gain a move to a bigger club in the summer. He linked up Glentoran on 21 December 2011 but was released from his contract at the end of January 2012 as he wished to play full-time football again and has found the travelling from Scotland and not being able to train with the Glentoran squad an issue. He then joined up again with former club Derry City for training, admitting that he was in talks to sign a new contract. He subsequently rejoined them. At the end of the 2014‚Äì15 season it was announced that due to an ongoing knee injury, Greacen would leave Stenhousemuir and retire from professional football.

Collins Scottish Clan & Family Encyclopedia. (Foreword by The Rt Hon. The Earl of Elgin KT, Convenor, The Standing Council of Scottish Chiefs). Published in 1994. Pages 324 - 325. History Origins of the clan Traditional origins The traditional origin of the Clan Skene is found in a legend of the Clan Robertson in the eleventh century. It is said that a younger son of the Robertson chief of Straun saved the life of the king by killing a savage wolf with nothing but his Sgian-dubh. He was rewarded with lands in Aberdeenshire which he named after the weapon (Sgian/Skene) that had brought him good fortune, and the family thereafter took the name of the lands. The feat is commemorated in the clan chief's shield which displays three wolves' heads impaled on daggers or Dirks. Recorded origins The first bearer of the name on record was John de Skeen, who lived during the reign of Malcolm III of Scotland. After Malcolm died, Skeen supported the claim of Donald Bane who was a rival to the succession of Edgar, King of Scotland. As a result his lands were forfeited and were only restored when the Skenes joined the army of Alexander I of Scotland which marched against rebels in the north in 1118. John de Skeen's grandson, John de Skene, held the lands during the reign of Alexander III of Scotland. Wars of Scottish Independence John de Skene's son was Patrick who appeared on the Ragman Rolls of 1296, submitting to Edward I of England. Despite this the Skenes staunchly supported Robert the Bruce and after his victory the Skene lands were erected into a barony. 15th and 16th centuries In 1411 Adam de Skene was killed at the Battle of Harlaw. Four generations later Alexander Skene de Skene is amongst those listed as dead on the field of the Battle of Flodden in 1513. Another Skene laird was killed at the Battle of Pinkie Cleugh in 1547. Other prominent branches of the Clan Skene were the Skenes of Curriehill and Skenes of Hallyards. John Skene, Lord Curriehill was a prominent lawyer of the sixteenth century who in 1594 was appointed to the Supreme Court Bench. He was knighted by James VI of Scotland. His son was created a Baronet of Nova Scotia in 1626. His second son was John Skene of Hallyards who rose to high judicial offices as Lord Clerk Register. Philip Skene of the Skene of Hallyards founded Skenesborough on the shores of Lake Champlain, then in Canada. 17th century and Thirty Years' War The Skenes were forced into exile for their support of Charles I of England. The clan chief then took service with the Swedish armies under Gustavus Adolphus of Sweden during the Thirty Years' War. 19th century The direct line of the chiefs of Clan Skene died out in 1827 and the estates passed to a nephew, James Duff, 4th Earl Fife. Another prominent branch of the Clan Skene were the Skenes of Rubislaw. James Skene of Rubislaw was a close friend of the novelist Walter Scott, and is said to have provided Scott with some inspiration for both Quentin Durward and Ivanhoe. William Forbes Skene is a celebrated Scottish writer and historian who was appointed historiographer royal for Scotland in 1881. Clan castle and seat Skene Castle was the seat of the chiefs of Clan Skene until the main line died out in 1827 and it passed to the Earl of Fife. Clan chief On 17 February 1994 Danus George Moncrieff Skene of Skene was recognised by the Lord Lyon King of Arms as Chief of the Name and Arms of Skene. His son, Dugald, was also recognised in the matriculation as the heir apparent. Danus Skene had matriculated his arms as Skene of Halyards in 1992. In 1672 John Skene of Halyards had matriculated his arms in the Lord Lyon's register and it was established that he was lineally descended from chief James Skene of that Ilk who died in around 1604. In Danus Skene's petition to the Lord Lyon he argued that upon the death of Alexander Skene in 1827 with no male issue, the succession passed to the next most senior line, the Skenes of Halyards, which the Lord Lyon accepted. After his death in 2016, his only son Dugald became chief. Clan septs Septs of the Clan Skene include: Cariston, Dyce, Hallyard and Carnie.

The show was launched on Friday 29 September 2006 on ITV and ITV Play. The prizes are greater than usually available on ITV Play (often exceeding ¬£20,000), but as a result of this, callers are usually taken less often. In order to win money, viewers must either call in at a cost of 75p from a BT landline, or enter through the ITV website. If they are successful they will be placed on hold, then transferred live to the studio if they are lucky, where they go on to deliver their answer. Make Your Play has given over ¬£3 million. It went over the ¬£3 million mark on 1 July 2007, when a contestant by the name of Mr Joseph Percy said \\"next day\\". An on screen graphic was then shown saying \\"¬£3 Million Given Away\\" accompanied with a siren sound effect. Controversy A game where viewers were invited to \\"add the pence\\" was criticised for providing a solution which was all but impossible to reach. In February and March 2007, ITV Play and all shows associated with it were suspended after allegations that consumers were being cheated. ITV decided to suspend these services - which included phone-in votes and competitions on shows such as Dancing on Ice and This Morning - while an independent review was carried out to see if members of the public were getting a fair deal when they rang in. The problem was shortly resolved, and the ITV Play channel was closed down \\"permanently\\".. It has gone back on air as of July 2007 An announcement on 12 September 2007 confirmed that the show, along with similar late night phone ins, would be phased out by the end of 2007. ITV Play's Glitterball ended on 30 September 2007. As a result, Make Your Play was extended, running six nights a week until the closure of ITV Play, with the last Make Your Play being broadcast on the morning of 23 December 2007.

Rausch (Jul 1, 2003) page 36 is used in Biblical criticism to determine if a statement attributed to Jesus may be authentic. It is often used as a shorthand for the criterion of double dissimilarity.The Historical Jesus and the Final Judgment Sayings in Q (Wissenschaftliche Untersuchungen Zum Neuen Testament) by Brian Han Gregg (Jun 30, 2006) page 29 The criterion states that if a saying attributed to Jesus is different from the Jewish traditions of his time and also from the early Church that followed him, it is likely to be authentic. Description The criterion of dissimilarity was introduced by Ernst K√§semann, who in 1953 started the second quest for the historical Jesus.The Quest for the Plausible Jesus: The Question of Criteria by Gerd Theissen and Dagmar Winter (Aug 30, 2002) page 122 K√§semann writes: > [T]here is an almost complete lack of satisfactory and water-tight criteria > for this material. In only one case do we have more or less safe ground > under our feet: when there are no grounds either for deriving a tradition > from Judaism or for ascribing it to primitive Christianity, and especially > when Jewish Christianity has mitigated or modified the received tradition, > as having been too bold for its taste. (K√§semann, Essays on New Testament > Themes, p. 37)Quoted in Tim Widowfield, \\"Defending the criterion of > dissimilarity\\" (Vridar blog post), 2014-04-23. Retrieved 2017-10-05. In other words, the criterion postulates that traditions about Jesus derive from (only) three sources: extrapolation from earlier Jewish traditions, revisionism by the early Christian Church, and true historical accounts of Jesus's ministry. If some tradition cannot be adequately explained by extrapolation nor by revisionism, then it must necessarily be a trace of the historical Jesus.  Limitations  The criterion has received criticism for leading to reconstructions of Jesus as being in implausible discontinuity with the early Jewish traditions that preceded him and the early Christian traditions that followed from him. One such critic writes: \\"The problem of the Criterion of Double Dissimilarity is that the more we know about early Jewish traditions and the more we know about early Christian post-Easter traditions, the less space there is for a reconstruction of the authentic sayings of Jesus, as by definition they have to differ from early Jewish and early Christian traditions. Therefore, in the end, no trace of a historical Jesus remains.\\"Oegema, Gerbern S. Apocalyptic Interpretation of the Bible. 2012. pg. 79.

It is a characteristic of rhetorical invention (inventio) and it precedes argumentation. Aristotle's definition Aristotle's definition of rhetoric, \\"the faculty of observing, in any given case, the available means of persuasion\\", presupposes a distinction between an art (œÑŒ≠œáŒΩŒ∑, techne) of speech‚Äìmaking and a cognitively prior faculty of discovery. That is so because, before one argues a case, one must discover what is at issue. How, for example, does one discover available means of persuasion? One does not simply frolic through fertile fields of œÑœåœÄŒøŒπ (topoi), randomly gathering materials with which to build lines of argument. There is a method endemic to rhetoric which guides the search for those lines of argument that speak most directly to the issue at stake. George A. Kennedy explains the distinction when he writes that the work of rhetoric, in Aristotle's view, is Inventio (rhetorical invention) then, involves more than a techne; it is also a faculty of discovery (dunamis (Œ¥œçŒΩŒ±ŒºŒπœÇ) to theoresai). The Aristotelian approach to inventio further assumes that reasoning employed in decision-making is a kind of probable reasoning. Moral inquiry Judgments about what should be done in the future are generally matters of shared inquiry and are always contingent (based on probability). Shared inquiry, following Wayne C. Booth, can be understood as \\"the art of reasoning together about shared concerns\\" (1988, p. 108). It is shared because the judgment is discursively negotiated with reference to both the crux of the matter and in light of what is in the best interest of oneself or some other. Accounting for both Moss and Booth, rhetorical reason may be conceptualized as a method of \\"shared moral inquiry\\", but with a special meaning of the word \\"moral\\". Moral inquiry, within the present context, means inquiry into practical matters (as opposed to mere speculation or scientific inquiry). Hans-Georg Gadamer uses \\"moral\\" in this sense in Truth and Method (p. 314). Albert R. Jonsen and Stephen Toulmin write that \\"moral knowledge is essentially particular\\" (1988, p. 330). Shared moral inquiry is moral, not because it involves questions of morality, but because it attempts to determine what is the right thing to do in contingent cases, where such judgments are not made deterministically. Moral inquiry is conducted in the contingent realm, and is concerned with the particular case. Understood with precision then, rhetorical reason guides and œÜœÅœåŒΩŒ∑œÉŒπœÇ (phronesis) drives moral inquiry. The aim of moral inquiry is sound moral judgment, but judgment in hard cases is frustrated because the crux of the matter is hedged in by a potentially limitless parade of particulars. Rhetorical reason manages particulars by systematically determining the relevance of issues and identifying the œÉœÑŒ¨œÉŒπœÇ (stasis, which is the most relevant of the relevant issues). Ascribing relevance is an act of phronesis (Tallmon, 2001 & 1995a, b). Hence, rhetorical reason is a modality of phronesis and also, as Aristotle famously notes, a counterpart of dialectic. That is, it depends upon practical wisdom for its proper work, and, in that work, it operates much like dialectical inference, only its proper domain is the particular case as opposed to the general question. Hence, viewed as a guide to resolving tough cases, rhetorical reason is constituted by: * topical logic (which guides inquiry by managing particulars) * stasis (which guides inquiry toward the crux of the matter) * sensitivity to maxims (which signal when the inquiry has taken a turn away from the instant case) * dialectical inference (which helps clarify the issue at stake), and the entire enterprise is driven by * phronesis Individuals exercise rhetorical reason, but its excellence is realized in the public arena (i.e., in shared inquiry, by referencing pooled wisdom).

It also includes the literary works in the older forms of the language during its evolution to the contemporary form and its cultural heritage and tradition. The literary heritage of the Assamese language can be traced back to the c. 9-10th century in the Charyapada, where the earliest elements of the language can be discerned.\\"(T)he Charyapadas or dohas may be taken to be the starting point of Assamese language and literature.\\" Bani Kanta Kakti divides the history of Assamese literature into three prominent eras‚ÄîEarly Assamese, Middle Assamese and Modern Assamese‚Äîwhich is generally accepted.

He visited the Kamarupa Kingdom during the reign of Kumar Bhaskara Varman of Varman dynasty. While visiting Kamrupa in seventh century, Xuanzang noted that the language of the region was slightly different from the language of Middle India (Magadha). He was able to identify the phonetic differences evident in the region. Even though systematic errors in the Sanskrit of Kamarupa inscriptions betray an underlying Pakrit in the pre-12th century period, scarce examples of the language exist. The Charyapadas, the Buddhist ballads of 8th-10th century some of whose composers were from Kamarupa and the language of which bear strong affitinities with Assamese (besides Bengali, Maithili and Oriya), are considered the first examples of Assamese literature. The spirit of the Charyapadas are found in later-day Deh-Bicaror Geet and other aphorisms; and some of the ragas found their way to the 15th-16th century Borgeets. In the 12th-14th century period the works of Ramai Pundit (Sunya Puran), Boru Chandidas (Krishna Kirtan), Sukur Mamud (Gopichandrar Gan), Durllava Mullik (Gobindachandrar Git) and Bhavani Das (Mainamatir Gan) bear strong grammatical relationship to Assamese; and their expressions and their use of adi-rasa are found in the later Panchali works of Mankar and Pitambar. These works are claimed as examples of Bengali literature as well. After this period of shared legacy, a fully differentiated Assamese literature finally emerged in the 14th century.  Medieval era   Pre-Shankari literature (1300-1490 AD)  This period saw the flourishing of two kinds of literary activity: translations and adaptations, and choral songs. =Translations and adaptations= The earliest known Assamese writer of this period was Hema Saraswati, whose well known works include Prahlad Charita and Hara Gauri Samvada. The story of the Prahlad Charita is taken from the Vamana Purana and the Hara Gouri Samvada includes the myth of Hara-Gouri marriage, birth of Kartik etc. Kaviratna Saravati's Jayadratha-vadha; Rudra Kandali's Satyaki- pravesa are prominent works of this era. Harivara Vipra, a court poet of Kamata Kingdom, composed Vavruvahanar Yuddha (based on the Mahabharata),example of language: age yena manusye laware kharatari chaga buli baghar galata ache dhari manusye erante galara nere baghe \\"if a man runs fast and catches hold of the neck of a tiger thinking it is only a goat and then tries to leave it, the tiger would not let him go\\" Lava-Kushar Yuddha (based on the Ramayana) and Tamradwajar Yudha. Though translated works, they contain local descriptions and embellishments, a feature that describes all translated work of this period. His Vavruvahanar Yuddha, for instance makes references to articles of the Ahom kingdom,References to camua (verse 176), cor (verse 57), and phura (verse 70) indicated that Vipra was either acquainted with the Ahom Kingdom, or even belonged there. which at that time was a small kingdom in the east, and describes the undivided Lakhimpur region, and in Lava-Kushar Yuddha he departs from the original and describes local customs for Rama and Sita's pumsavana ceremony. All these works are associated with Durlabhanarayan of Kamata and his immediate successors.The major work from this period that left a lasting impression is Saptakanda Ramayana, composed by Madhava Kandali in verse, and recitedThe text indicates change overs from time to time (madhava bolanta aita acho ehimana, let me leave this here) and that the poet directed the course of the narration as the courtiers desired . in the court of a 14th-century Barahi-Kachari king Mahamanikya (Mahamanikpha) who ruled either in the Nagaon or the Golaghat region. In chronology, among vernacular translations of the original Sanskrit, Kandali's Ramayana comes after Kamban's (Tamil, 12th century), and ahead of Kirttivas' (Bengali, 15th century), Tulsidas' (Awadhi, 16th century), Balaram Das' (Oriya) etc. Thus the Saptakanda Ramayana becomes the first rendition of the Ramayana into an Indo-Aryan language in the Indian subcontinent. The literary language (as opposed to the colloquial Assamese) this work adopted became the standard literary language for much of the following periods, till the rise of new literature in the 19th century. That his work was a major influence can be inferred from Sankardeva's tribute to the \\"Opromadi Kobi/ ‡¶Ö‡¶™‡ßç‡ß∞‡¶Æ‡¶æ‡¶¶‡ßÄ ‡¶ï‡¶¨‡¶ø\\" (\\"unerring predecessor poet\\").purvakavi apramadi madhav kandali adi pade virachila rama katha hastira dekhiya lada sasa yena phure marga mora bhaila tenhaya avastha. The pada form of metrical verse (14 syllables in each verse with identical two syllables at the end of each foot in a couplet) became a standard in Assamese kavya works, something that continued till the modern times. Though a translated work, it is infused with local color, and instead of the heroic, Kandali instead emphasized the homely issues of relationships etc. Among the two kinds of alamkara's, arthalankaras were used extensively, with similes and metaphors taken from the local milieu even though the original works are set in foreign lands; whereas the shabdalankara (alliteration etc.) were rarely used. In the pre-shankari era, a renowned mathematician, Bakul Kayastha from Kamarupa Kingdom, compiled Kitabat Manjari(1434), which was a translation of the Lƒ´lƒÅvatƒ´ by BhƒÅskara II into Assamese. Kitabat Manjari is a poetical treatise on Arithmetic, Surveying and Bookkeeping. The book teaches how accounts are to be kept under different heads and how stores belonging to the royal treasury are to be classified and entered into a stock book. The works of Bakul Kayastha were regarded as standards in his time to be followed by other Kayasthas in maintaining royal accounts. = Choral songs = Choral songs composed for a popular form of narration-performances called Oja-Pali, a precursor to theater and theatrical performances, came to be known as Panchali works. Though some of these works are contemporaneous to Sankardeva's, they hark back to older forms free of Sankardeva's influences and so are considered pre-Sankardeva literature. The Oja-palis follow two different traditions: biyah-gowa which tells stories from the Mahabharata and Maroi, which tells stories on the snake goddess Manasa. The poets--Pitambar, Durgabar, Mankar and Sukavi Narayan--are well known for the compositions.  Shankari literature (1490-1700 AD)  In Assamese literature, the era of Shankardeva or Shankari era, incorporates the literary works that were produced mostly as pertinent to the Neo-Vaishnavite movement which propagated the Ekasarana Nama-Dharma. Shankardeva‚Äôs contribution to Assamese literature is multidimensional and spread through different genres of literature. He is credited with building on past cultural relics and devising new forms of music (Borgeet), theatrical performance (Ankia Naat, Bhaona), dance (Sattriya), literary language (Brajavali). Sankardev produced a large body of work. Though there were others before him who wrote in the language of the common man, it was Sankardev who opened the floodgates and inspired others like Madhavdev to carry on where he left off. His magnum opus is the Kirtana- Ghosha which contains narrative verses glorifying Shri krishna, meant for community singing. His other prominent literary works include the rendering of eight books of the Bhagavata Purana including the Adi Dasama (Book X), Harishchandra-upakhyana, Bhakti-pradip, Nimi-navasiddha-samvada, Bhakti- ratnakara (Sanskrit verses, mostly from the Bhagavata, compiled into a book), Anadi-patana, Gunamala and many plays like Cihna Yatra, Rukmini haran, Patni prasad, Keli gopal, Kurukshetra yatra and Srirama vijaya. Madhavdeva, a disciple of Sankardeva, has a large scale contribution to Assamese literature. His Magnum opus, Naam Ghosa is based chiefly on the Bhagavata Purana. The Naam-Ghosa is known by the name of Hajari Ghosa as well, as it contains one thousand verses (ghosas).His Guru Bhatima, a long poem of praise to his Guru Sankardev, is also popular. Bhakti-Ratnavali is another notable work, rendered by Madhavadeva from the original work by Visnupuri in Sanskrit. Other prominent works include Naam Maalikaa, Assamese rendering of the Adi Kanda of Valmiki's Ramayana, Janma Rahasya, 191 Borgeets and several plays. After Sankardev and Madhavdev, several other writers emerged and contributed to Assamese literature. Ananta Kandali's Mahiravana Vadha, Harihara Yuddha, Vrttrasura Vadha, Kumara Harana and Sahasra Nama Vrttanta; Rama Saraswati's translation of the Mahabharata, Geeta Govinda and Vadha Kavyas; a part of Naam Ghosa by Ratnakar Kandali; Sridhar Kandali's Kumara Harana; Janmajatra, Nandutsav, Gopi-Uddhab Sambad and Sitar Patal Pravesh by Gopaldev; compilation of Kirtan Ghosha by Ramcharan Thakur; Nava Ghosha, Santasaar, Burha-Bhashya by Purushottam Thakur etc. are notable of the period. Bhattadeva, another notable writer of this period, is acknowledged as the father of Assamese prose. Katha Bhagavata, Katha Gita, Bhaktiratnavali, Bhakti Viveka (Sanskrit) etc. are his prominent works. BhattadevBhattadeva's erudition in Sanskrit grammar and literature, and his command over the Bhagavata earned him the title of Bhagavata Bhattacharya.  Post-Shankari literature (1700-1826 AD)  Along with the expansion of power and border of the Ahom kingdom, literary works other than Neo-vaishnavite centric started gaining momentum in the 18th century. However the tradition of composing works based on Sanskrit scriptures still continued. Raghunath Mahanta was one of the most important figures of this period whose well known works include Katha-Ramayana, Adbhut Ramayana and Satrunjoy- all of them are based on the Ramayana. Kabiraj Chakravarti's translation of Brahma Vaivarta Purana and Shakuntala, Kavichandra Dwija's Dharma Purana, Bishnu Dev Goswami's Padma Purana, Putala Charitra by Borruchi, Ramchadra Borpatra's Hoigrib-Madhva Kahini, Acharya Dwija's Ananda-Lahari, Ruchinath Kandali's translation of Chandi Aakhyana are important works of this period. Among translation of texts related to practical knowledge include translation of Srihastha Muktavali on Dance and mudra by Suchand Ojha, translations of Kaamratna- Tantra, Bhaswati by Kaviraj Chakraborti. Hastividyarnava, commissioned under the patronage of king Siva Singha and translated by Sukumar Barkaith, is based on the Sanskrit text Gajendra- Chintamoni by Sambhunath. Books like Ghora Nidaan, Aswanidaan by Surjyakhari Daivajna were also compiled during this period. Modern era This is a period of the prose chronicles (Buranji) of the Ahom court. The Ahoms had brought with them an instinct for historical writings. In the Ahom court, historical chronicles were at first composed in their original Tai-Kadai language, but when the Ahom rulers adopted Assamese as the court language, historical chronicles began to be written in Assamese. From the beginning of the 17th century onwards, court chronicles were written in large numbers. These chronicles or buranjis, as they were called by the Ahoms, broke away from the style of the religious writers. The language is essentially modern except for slight alterations in grammar and spelling.  Effect of British rule  The British imposed Bengali in 1836 in Assam after the state was occupied and annexed with the Bengal Presidency. As a result of this language imposition, the progress of education in Assam remained not only slow but highly defected and a lot of Bengalis were imported and employed in the different schools of Assam. Writing of text books in Assamese for school children did not get any encouragement and Assamese literature naturally suffered in its growth. Due to a sustained campaign, Assamese was reinstated in 1873 as the state language. Since the initial printing and literary activity occurred in eastern Assam, the Eastern dialect was introduced in schools, courts, and offices and soon came to be formally recognized as the Standard Assamese. In recent times, with the growth of Guwahati as the political and commercial center of Assam, the Standard Assamese has moved away from its roots in the Eastern dialect.  Influence of missionaries  The modern Assamese period began with the publication of the Bible in Assamese prose by the American Baptist missionaries in 1819. The currently prevalent standard Asamiya has its roots in the Sibsagar dialect of Eastern Assam. As mentioned in Bani Kanta Kakati's \\"Assamese, its Formation and Development\\" (1941, Published by Sree Khagendra Narayan Dutta Baruah, LBS Publications, G.N. Bordoloi Road, Gauhati-1, Assam, India) ‚Äì \\"The Missionaries made Sibsagar in Eastern Assam the centre of their activities and used the dialect of Sibsagar for their literary purposes\\". The American Baptist Missionaries were the first to use this dialect in translating the Bible in 1813. The missionaries established the first printing press in Sibsagar in 1836 and started using the local Asamiya dialect for writing purposes. In 1846 they started a monthly periodical called Arunodoi, and in 1848, Nathan Brown published the first book on Assamese grammar. The Missionaries published the first Assamese-English Dictionary compiled by M. Bronson in 1867. One of the major contributions of the American Baptist missionaries to the Assamese language is the reintroduction of Assamese as the official language in Assam. In 1848 missionary Nathan Brown published a treatise on the Assamese language.Brown, Nathan (1848). Grammatical Notices of the Assamese Language. American Baptist Missionary Press, Sibsagor, Assam This treatise gave a strong impetus towards reintroducing Assamese the official language in Assam. In his 1853 official report on the province of Assam, British official Moffat Mills wrote:  Beginning of modern literature  center The period of modern literature began with the publication the Assamese journal Jonaki (‡¶ú‡ßã‡¶®‡¶æ‡¶ï‡ßÄ) (1889), which introduced the short story form first by Lakshminath Bezbaroa. Thus began the Jonaki period of Assamese literature. In 1894 Rajanikanta Bordoloi published the first Assamese novel Mirijiyori. The modern Assamese literature has been enriched by the works of Jyoti Prasad Agarwalla, Birinchi Kumar Barua, Hem Barua, Atul Chandra Hazarika, Mafizuddin Ahmed Hazarika, Nalini Bala Devi, Navakanta Barua, Syed Abdul Malik, Mamoni Raisom Goswami, Bhabendra Nath Saikia, Homen Borgohain, Birendra Kumar Bhattacharya, D. K. Barooah, Nirupama Borgohain, Kanchan Baruah, Saurabh Kumar Chaliha, Raihan Shah and others. Moreover, as regards the spreading of Assamese literature outside Assam, the complete work of Jyoti Prasad Agarwala has been translated into Hindi to reach a wider audience by Devi Prasad Bagrodia. Bagrodia has also translated Shrimanta Shankardev's 'Gunamala' into Hindi. In 1917 the Asam Sahitya Sabha was formed as a guardian of the Assamese society and the forum for the development of Assamese language and literature. Padmanath Gohain Baruah was the first president of the society.  Contemporary literature  Contemporary writers include Arupa Patangia Kalita, Monikuntala Bhattacharya, Mousumi Kondoli, Monalisa Saikia. Assamese literature is currently booming in Assamese-speaking world, with readership of Assamese books gradually increasing over the last decades. A huge success can be seen in North East book fair and Nagaon book fair, when selling of Assamese books increased then English books.

They are a traditional Lancashire dish served often, with lashings of malt vinegar, on or around Bonfire Night (5 November). The dish is popular in Bury, Preston, Rochdale, Oldham, Wigan, Bolton, Tyldesley and Heywood. The dried peas are soaked overnight and simmered to produce a type of mushy pea. Parching is a now-defunct term for long slow boiling. The peas are field peas, left to dry on the plant, as distinct from garden peas, picked green for consumption fresh. The Carlin pea, a different variety prepared in similar ways and also eaten in the north of England, dates back to the 12th century. It is said that Martin Frobisher buried caches of these peas on Baffin Island in the 1570s to sustain his expedition while seeking the Northwest Passage. Consumption Cooked black peas are commonly sold at fairgrounds and mobile food counters. They are traditionally eaten from a cup with salt and vinegar. They can be served hot or cold, the former being especially popular in the winter months. At fairgrounds, they were traditionally served in white porcelain mugs and eaten with a spoon. In more recent years, they have been served in thick white disposable cups. In the \\"world famous\\" Bury Market and in Preston, parched peas are sold ready-cooked and served in brown-paper bags or in plastic tubs, as an autumn delicacy. They are also sold at the Manchester Christmas markets.https://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/whats-on/manchester-christmas- markets-traders-2018-15383867 Consumption is limited to certain areas within the historical boundaries of Lancashire, notably Oldham, Wigan, Bury, Rochdale, Preston, Stalybridge, Leigh, Atherton, Tyldesley and Bolton. Carlin peas Carlin peas, also known as carling, maple, brown or pigeon peas (but distinct from the tropical pigeon pea Cajanus cajan), and black or grey badgers, are small, hard brown peas, first recorded during Elizabethan times. It has been suggested that the name \\"Carlin\\" comes from \\"Carling Sunday\\" or \\"Care Sunday\\" after the population of Newcastle were saved from starvation in a siege of 1327 or 1644 when a ship arrived from Norway with a cargo of these peas on that day. Includes facsimile of article from Westmorland Gazette 26 March 1836 They are classed as a heritage or heirloom variety, often referred to as the medieval mushy pea. They can be grown in the same way as sweet peas. The plants grow to about six feet high, with white and purple flowers. The pods fill with small brown peas which can be used fresh, or dried. Carlin peas are used to prepare a dish made in the northeast of England and parts of Cumbria. They are a traditional staple of Carlin Sunday (the Sunday before Palm Sunday). Carlin peas are boiled until tender, then fried briefly with butter or dripping. Salt is not added during cooking, as it stops the cooking process. They are then seasoned with vinegar and black pepper or sometimes rum and brown sugar. They may be eaten hot or cold. A children's rhyme counts out the Sundays of Lent as \\"Tid, Mid, Misere; Carlin, Palm, Pace-Egg Day\\", referring to the second Sunday when \\"Te Deum\\" was sung; the third when \\"Mi Deus\\" was sung; the Sunday when the \\"Misere Mei\\" was chanted; Carlin Sunday; Palm Sunday; and Pace Eggs on Easter Sunday. Carlins are low in fat, and have 23g per 100g of protein and of fibre. They contain manganese, molybdenum and B vitamins, especially B1. Their red/blue colour derives from anthocyanins, which have desirable nutritional properties. Availability The availability of black peas is seasonal; they are typically available from the end of October and throughout November. They are available from local stores and also pet shops (as the peas are a good carp bait) although peas from pet shops may not necessarily be food-grade. Carlin peas are not widely available in British shops, but are sometimes available in health food shops. They can be bought for home preparation in at least two varieties, \\"Red Fox\\" and \\"Black Badger\\", and the latter are available tinned in water. This product, from Hodmedod's, won the Soil Association's BOOM Award 2016 as winner of \\"Store cupboard items\\" and overall winner in the \\"Pantry\\" category.

History The pipeline was proposed already in 1993. On 27 December 2004, prime-ministers of Albania, the Republic of Macedonia and Bulgaria signed the latest political declaration, followed by the memorandum of understanding between representatives of Albania, the Republic of Macedonia and Bulgaria and Ted Ferguson, the president and CEO of AMBO. On 30 October 2006, Albania and the Republic of Macedonia signed a protocol to determinate the entrance points of the pipeline. The entrance point will be Stebleve village in Albania and Lakaica village in the Republic of Macedonia. A similar protocol between Bulgaria and the Republic of Macedonia was signed later in 2006. On 31 January 2007, the Republic of Macedonia, Bulgaria and Albania signed a trilateral convention on the construction of the AMBO pipeline. This document was ratified by the Parliaments of all three countries and governed the construction, operation, and maintenance of the pipelines. Description The aim of the long pipeline was to bypass the Turkish Straits in transportation of Russian and Caspian oil. The pipeline was expected to cost about US$1.5 billion and it would have a capacity of . There would be four pump stations, two in Bulgaria and one each in the Republic of Macedonia and Albania, constructed along the route. A pre-front-end engineering and design study (FEED) was to be prepared by KBR. The pipeline was expected to be operational by 2011. Project company The pipeline was to be built and operated by the US-registered Albanian Macedonian Bulgarian Oil Corporation (AMBO). The project was backed by the US government, who financed a feasibility study of pipeline. Alternative projects Other pipeline projects were the Burgas- Alexandroupoli pipeline from Burgas to the Greek Aegean port Alexandroupoli, and the Pan-European Pipeline from Constan≈£a in Romania to Trieste in Italy. Compared with Burgas-Alexandroupoli pipeline, the AMBO pipeline would be longer and more expensive, but Vlor√´ (which is a sheltered, deep-water, all- weather port) could accommodate larger tankers and is more accessible than Alexandroupoli. Also, an oil spill in the Aegean would have a negative influence on Greece's tourism industry.

Marcellus was elected curule aedile in 56 BC. In 52 BC he was elected consul, together with Servius Sulpicius Rufus, for the following year. During his consulship Marcellus proved himself to be a zealous partisan of Pompey and the optimates, and urged the Senate to extreme measures against Julius Caesar, managing to establish that the subject of recalling Caesar should be discussed on 1 March of the following year. He also considered the Lex Vitinia invalid, removing Roman citizenship from citizens of Comum, and caused a senator of Comum, who happened to be in Rome, to be scourged, a punishment Roman citizens were exempted from under the Lex Porcia.Hardy, Ernest G. (1924). Some Problems in Roman History: 143-4. Upon the start of the civil war, Marcellus fled Rome with the optimates and joined the Republican Grand Army in Epirus. After the Battle of Pharsalus, Marcellus abandoned opposition to Caesar, and withdrew in an honorable exile to Mytilene, where he was left unmolested by Caesar. His cousin Gaius Claudius Marcellus petitioned the dictator for clemency, as did Cicero in his Pro Marcello. This was granted near the close of 46 BC, though Marcellus did not start out for Rome until the middle of 45 BC.Abbott, Frank F. (1909).

Made by Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer, it was produced by Bernard Smith and John Ford, from a screenplay by Janet Green and John McCormick, based on the short story \\"Chinese Finale\\" by Norah Lofts. The music score was by Elmer Bernstein and the cinematography by Joseph LaShelle. This was the last feature film directed by Ford, ending a career that spanned approximately fifty three years. Plot In rural China, in 1935, all but one of the white residents of a remote Christian mission post are women. The strict Miss Agatha Andrews (Margaret Leighton) is the head of the mission, assisted by the meek Miss Argent (Mildred Dunnock). Charles Pether (Eddie Albert) is a mission teacher who always wanted to be a pastor; his peevish, panicky, self-centred and domineering middle-aged wife Florrie (Betty Field) is pregnant for the first time. Emma Clark (Sue Lyon) is the only young staff member, whom Miss Andrews treats as if she was her daughter. The mission is elated to learn that a much-needed doctor is arriving. However, they are shocked to discover that Dr. Cartwright (Anne Bancroft) is a Chicago woman who smokes, drinks alcohol, swears, wears pants and short hair, disdains religion and sits before grace. She and Miss Andrews are soon at odds. Emma, who has led a very sheltered life, is fascinated by the newcomer, much to Miss Andrews's dismay. After she has settled in, Dr. Cartwright urges Miss Andrews to provide money to send Florrie Pether to a modern facility, as her age means that giving birth is high risk, but Andrews refuses. Meanwhile, there are rumors of atrocities committed by the militia of Mongolian warlord Tunga Khan (Mike Mazurki). Miss Andrews is certain that the mission will be safe, as they are American citizens. After a nearby, even poorer British mission is sacked by Tunga Khan, Miss Andrews reluctantly accepts survivors Miss Binns (Flora Robson), Mrs. Russell (Anna Lee) and Miss Ling (Jane Chang), but only for a short time, as she is unwilling to harbor those of any other denomination for long. Immediately after the arrival of the survivors, a cholera outbreak erupts. Dr. Cartwright quickly takes command, treating all the Chinese of the area. Miss Andrews's initial hostility to her subsides when Emma gets sick and she implores Dr. Cartwright to save her life. After the emergency is over and Emma is well again, the relationship between Andrews and Cartwright starts to soften. but deteriorates when Cartwright shows up drunk in the dining room with a bottle of whiskey, and tries to make all the pious women drink as well. One night, Charles and Cartwright see a fire on the horizon and hear gunfire. The next morning, the Chinese soldiers of the nearby garrison evacuate in a hurry, as Tunga Khan and his men are believed to be approaching. Miss Andrews is still convinced the mission is untouchable, but Charles is now determined to be assertive. He and Kim, an English speaking male Chinese mission staff member, drive out to investigate the situation, while urging everyone else to be prepared to leave the mission, despite Miss Andrews's opposition. After a while, they hear the car's horn, but once the gate is opened, bandits on horseback charge in firing their guns and quickly take over the mission. Before being executed by the bandits, Kim tells the women Charles was murdered when he tried to rescue a woman being assaulted by Tunga Khan's men. Then Miss Ling, coming from a powerful Mandarin family, is taken away to act as Tunga Khan's young wife's servant, while the seven white women are herded into a shed. They watch as Tunga Khan has every Chinese in the mission executed, women and children included, to Emma's shock. Tunga Khan comes into the shed and tries to take Emma. Realizing that they are mostly American women, he decides to ask for a ransom. With Miss Andrews panicking and Florrie in labor, Dr. Cartwright asks for her desperately needed medical bag. Tunga Khan offers to exchange it for her sexual submission to him. The doctor agrees, and helps Florrie give birth to a baby boy. After Cartwright goes to fulfill her end of the bargain, an increasingly deranged Andrews vilifies her, calling her \\"whore of Babylon\\". The others, however, understand the sacrifice the doctor has made and why. In the evening, the Mongols gather in a circle and organize wrestling matches for entertainment, with Dr. Cartwright watching the spectacle at Tunga Khan's side, as his new concubine. When the lean warrior (Woody Strode) who had been ogling Cartwright all evening steps into the ring to face the winner of a bout, Tunga Khan insists on accepting the challenge himself and breaks the man's neck. Cartwright manages to convince Tunga Khan to let the other women go, including Miss Ling. Before Miss Argent leaves, she sees the doctor hide a bottle that she had earlier called poison. She urges Cartwright not to do what she is planning, but to no avail. With the others safely away, Cartwright, now in a geisha outfit, goes to Tunga Khan's room and secretly poisons two drinks. She subserviently offers a cup to Tunga Khan, as she utters, \\"So long, ya bastard.\\" After Tunga Khan drinks, he immediately keels over dead. Then, after a moment's hesitation, Cartwright drinks from the second cup. Cast * Anne Bancroft as Dr. D. R.

Production The original story, Chinese Finale, was presented as an episode of Alcoa Theatre in March 1960 with Hilda Plowright as Miss Andrews and Jan Sterling as Dr. Mary Cartwright. John Ford considered both Katharine Hepburn and Jennifer Jones for the role of Dr. Cartwright, and Rosalind Russell lobbied for the part, but eventually Patricia Neal was cast. Ford began the film on 8 February 1965 on the MGM backlot, but after three days of filming, Neal had a stroke. Anne Bancroft took over the role of Dr. Cartwright but Ford was unhappy with Bancroft and called her \\"the mistress of monotone\\".p. 332 Davis,Ronald L. John Ford: Hollywood's Old Master University of Oklahoma Press, 1997 Ford originally considered Carol Lynley for the role played in the film by MGM contract star Sue Lyon, whom the studio insisted on. Shooting finished on April 12, only six days behind schedule. Ford chose Otho Lovering to edit the film; they had first worked together on Stagecoach (1939). Lovering edited most of Ford's feature films in the 1960s. The film was not released until 1966. Analysis As Ford was a devout Catholic, the film shows the difference between the claim of being moral and the act of morals; the stark contrast between compassion and sacrifice to the austere holier-than-thou philosophy.

History The border as seen from Veƒæk√© Slemence pre 2003. View from Slovakia to Ukraine. Crossing border nowadays (2018) In historical records the village was first mentioned in 1332. It was a single village named Szelmenc (between 1919‚Äì1938 it was called Slemence) before 1945. From 1919 until 1945, Szelmenc bore the same history as Subcarpathian Rus'. It was first ceded to Czechoslovakia in 1919, then after the First Vienna Award in 1938 it returned to the Kingdom of Hungary, then back, then, after the Soviet-Czechoslovak Treaty in 1945 was partially ceded to the Soviet Union along with Subcarpathian Rus'. The new border between the two states ran through Szelmenc. The town was divided between Slovakia (2/3) and Ukraine (1/3) by cutting it into two parts - Veƒæk√© Slemence became a part of Slovakia and Mali Selmentsi (–ú–∞–ª—ñ –°–µ–ª–º–µ–Ω—Ü—ñ) a part of Ukraine. In 1946, a house which lay exactly on the border was demolished with all the other objects in the way, and a 6 meter high palisade wall with watch towers and border patrolling were installed. For the next 60 years crossing between the two parts was prohibited. To meet with relatives on the other side, locals had to first travel 13 km to Uzhgorod for visas to Czechoslovakia. If their visa application, which took at least two weeks, was successful, they would travel 80 km south to the nearest border crossing, then 80 km back, and return the same way. Previously 3‚Äì500 meters and a half day, the trip became at least 160‚Äì200 km long for one way only and took at least a month to organize. Those, who tried to shout over from one side to the other were penalized on both parts. This resulted in discussing, sending messages, news in form of songs, sung loud near the border. In 2003, a Sz√©kely gate (sz√©kelykapu) was installed on the border, one half of it being in the Slovak, while the other half being on the Ukrainian part of the border, with a short poem on the Mali Selmentsi part. The poem can be roughly translated as \\"From one Szelmenc became two, should be unified by the Creator, God bless with peace and keep us together, our hope remains, and will join together what torn apart, gate wings of the two Szelmec closes our villages together\\". After the fall of communism, and more than a decade of fights with bureaucracy and negligence, a border checkpoint for pedestrians and cyclists was established in 2005 on the street which was divided. It was opened on 23 December 2005, ending 61 years of division. On 1 January 2008, Slovakia joined the Schengen Agreement, resulting in tightening of the crossing between the two Szelmences once again. The residents of Mali Selmentsi were again forced to travel to Uzhgorod to apply at the Slovak Consular Office for a visa to enter Slovakia and the Schengen Area. On the other hand, as Slovak citizens, the residents of Veƒæk√© Slemence could enter Mali Selmentsi and Ukraine without a visa. However, on 11 June 2017, the visa policy of the Schengen Area was amended. Ukrainian citizens holding biometric passports no longer require a visa to enter the Schengen Area for up to 90 days in a 180 day period. At present, the border between the two Szelmences can only be crossed by EU, EEA, Swiss and Ukrainian citizens. The two parts have a total population of about 840 people, almost exclusively (+95%) ethnic Hungarians, with a few Romani in and around the village(s). The elderly citizens of the two Szelmences were once citizens of Austria-Hungary, Czechoslovakia, the Kingdom of Hungary, and the Soviet Union, and now are the citizens of Slovakia (and thus the European Union) and Ukraine, while most of them have never left the village, where they were born.

He was captain and coach of the Uganda national football team (known as \\"The Cranes\\"). He had been involved in the national team setup as player and coach for 25 years. Paul Edwin Hasule was born in 1959 to John Haumba Kango and Petwa of Murandu, Mbale. Attracting attention as a striker while at Tororo College and later Makerere University, it was his short career at Mbale Heroes that made him a hot property in Ugandan football. Joining Villa The turning point came when he joined SC Villa in November 1981. That came on the back of Heroes relegation from the topflight and made his Villa debut against Nile FC during the Jesse Owens Cup at Nakivubo Stadium in 1981. The 22-year-old arrived at Villa Park along with top recruits like Cranes skipper Jimmy Kirunda, Dan Lutalo, Godfrey Kisitu and Fred Serwadda. Initially, Villa coach George Mukasa fielded Hasule on the right wing but he was unconvincing and he performed miserably when he was switched to the central striking role. Stuck between a rock and a hard place, Hasule turned to his natural gifts of power and a towering frame for reprieve and in no time, at the encouragement of Kirunda, forced his way in the defensive positions. Hasule played a significant part in the title run-in during the 1982 season, scoring a vital goal to seal a 2-1 win over Masaka Union. And he was fast becoming SC Villa‚Äôs reliable defender, combining excellent technique and distribution with his appetite for a tackle and a battle. His versatility was also valuable. He ably filled in at the right back and all across the midfield during his time at Villa Park. After a fantastic 1982 season, in which Villa won the league title unbeaten, national coach Bidandi Ssali put faith in the explosive defender and paired him with Kirunda in most of the Cranes fixtures. In September 1982, Hasule scored a winner in the 3-2 victory over Tanzania during a Nations Cup qualifier to seal passage to the next round. Like Kirunda, Hasule was a master of the overlap game, which helped him score several goals. One particular match that highlighted Hasule‚Äôs overlapping prowess was against Algeria in a 1984 Olympic qualifier. Not only did he deliver assists for Phillip Omondi and Issa Sekatawa., he scored a brace in the 4-1 first leg win at Nakivubo. He made a name for himself as a footballer with record local champions SC Villa and became the main factor in their victories between 1982 and 1994. Hasule was part of the mighty SC Villa team that won the inaugural Super League unbeaten in 1982. He also led the club to the prestigious East and Central Africa club title in 1987. Twice he took SC Villa to the finals on the continent, Africa Club Championship in 1991 and CAF Cup in 1992. Cranes skipper In 1988, Hasule took over the national team captaincy following Latigo‚Äôs departure to Germany. His first assignment came at the 1989 Kuwait Friendship Games in which Iraq edged Uganda in the final through shootouts. However, in what would become the most memorable moment in his career, Hasule scored a wonder opening goal with an unstoppable drive from 30 yards. A month later, he was on the podium to collect the Cecafa trophy and was at it again in 1990 as Uganda‚Äôs regional dominance reached unprecedented heights. However, things turned bleak in June 1991, when local football body Fufa slapped him a one-year ban after finding him guilty of manhandling referee Fred Wanyama in the league match against UCI. It was lifted after three months. Hasule‚Äôs response was to be the cornerstone of the Villa side which reached the 1991 final of Africa Club Championships and the 1992 Caf Cup final but on both occasions, the Jogoos finished empty handed. With his body undergoing physical wear and tear, the now 33-year-old Hasule led SC Villa to the 1992 league title, which proved to be his last silverware as a player. He had become increasingly hampered by injuries and willfully passed on the mantle to William Nkemba but, like so many great players, Hasule went out on a high note when he quit at the end of 1993 season. He, however, stayed behind as assistant manager but later moved on to start a coaching career. A sincere and generous man, he died on April 29, 2004 aged just 45. Fittingly fans held prayers for him at Nakivubo Stadium. A Club and Cranes legend had passed. He retired as a player in 1993 to become assistant coach and team manager of SC Villa. He left in 1995 to coach State House and later Simba SC but returned in 1998 to SC Villa to win a historic 4th 'Double' (championship and club title). After winning another 'Double' in 2000, Hasule's contract was not renewed in 2001 and he moved on to coach Police FC until his death. Aged 44, he died in Mulago Hospital in 2004, his death elicited emotional responses from a legion of his followers who paid him their last respects in kind by ensuring a decent burial, pitching in to meet the funeral expenses including the purchasing of a coffin draped in the national flag in his honour.

Biography  Marcian was a member of several Roman imperial families. His father was Procopius Anthemius, Western Roman Emperor between 467 and 472, who descended from Procopius, usurper in 365-366 against Emperor Valens and relative of Emperor Julian's (360-363). Marcian's mother was Marcia Euphemia,Mathisen. daughter of Marcian (Eastern Roman Emperor in 450-457) with an unknown woman. Marcian had three brothers - Anthemiolus, who died in Gaul in 471, Procopius Anthemius and Romulus - and a sister, Alypia, wife of the Western magister militum Ricimer. To strengthen the bonds between the Western and Eastern Roman empires, Marcian married Leontia, daughter of the Eastern Roman Emperor Leo I and his wife Verina (the elder sister of Leontia's, Ariadne, had married the powerful general Zeno), and was chosen as consul without colleague twice, in 469 and 472. At the death of Leo I, his nephew Leo II, son of Zeno and Ariadne, succeeded him, but the young Emperor died that same year at the age of 7. Zeno, who had been proclaimed joint emperor with his son, became the only Eastern Roman Emperor, but his succession was not welcomed by many. The people of Constantinople, in fact, considered him a barbarian because of his Isaurian origin (he had even changed his original name, Tarasicodissa, to the Greek Zeno), while some preferred Marcian to him as his wife, Ariadne, was born while Leo I was an obscure soldier, while Leontia was born while Leo was Emperor. Zeno's power was challenged by Basiliscus, Verina's brother, who succeeded in overthrowing Zeno in 475 and held power for one year before Zeno took back the throne. In 479 Marcian tried to overthrow Zeno. With the help of his brothers Procopius Anthemius and Romulus, he gathered troops composed of both citizens and foreigners in the house of a Caesarius, south of the Forum of Theodosius in Constantinople, and from there they marched simultaneously on the Imperial palace and on the house of Illus, an Isaurian general who supported Zeno. The Emperor almost fell into the hands of the rebels, who, during the day, overwhelmed the imperial troops, who were attacked also by the citizens from the roofs of their houses. During the night, however, Illus brought an Isaurian unit quartered in nearby Chalcedonia into the city and corrupted Marcian's soldiers, who allowed Zeno to flee. On the following morning Marcian, understanding that his situation was desperate and that the reinforcements of the Gothic general Theodoric Strabo would not arrive in time, took refuge in the church of the Holy Apostles, but was arrested with his brothers. He was sent to Caesarea in Cappadocia with his brothers. With the help of some monks, he tried to escape, but, while his brothers succeeded, he was captured and obliged to become a monk in Tarsus (Cilicia),Evagrius. or imprisoned in Isauria, in the fortress of Papurius. He tried to escape a second time, and this time he succeeded, but, after gathering new troops and attacking Ancyra, he was defeated and captured by Trocundus, Illus' brother. In 484 Illus organised a revolt against Zeno. As he did not want to take the purple for himself, he freed Marcian and proclaimed him Emperor. Illus freed Verina, too (Zeno had previously exiled her), but then decided to depose Marcian and elevate Leontius to the throne; Marcian was then sent to Italy to ask for Odoacer's help.

The camp is best known for its canoe tripping program. Pathfinder follows a tradition of using wood and canvas canoes. Several other camps in Algonquin and elsewhere follow a similar tradition of tripping with, building and restoring canvas canoes. Pathfinder's canoes are painted a distinctive bright red. The current director is Michael Sladden. History Camp Pathfinder was founded in 1914 by William Bennett and Franklin Gray. In 1922, the camp was sold to Herman J. \\"Chief\\" Norton, who became one of Pathfinder's most influential owners. Pathfinder was almost shut down or sold to the Ontario Provincial Government when the government told Norton the lease for the camp (and the others in the park as well) would not be renewed. The government later renewed the lease and the camp (and all the others in the park) remained in operation. Since then, owners or co-owners have included Frank J. Horton, Bill Swift, Roy Thrall, Mac Rand, Glen Arthurs, and Michael Sladden. Camp Pathfinder is located on Source Lake, in Algonquin Provincial Park, just more than a mile away from Highway 60. Source Lake is an access point to the Algonquin Park canoe route system. There are no campsites on Source Lake. There are, however, a few residential cabins and the camp itself on the lake. The camp is located on an island in the lake, commonly referred to as Camp Pathfinder Island or \\"CPI\\". On the opening days of each session, the whole camp meets at the new Indian council ring, and a meeting introducing the camp session is held. This meeting, and other aspects of the camp, have a number of traditions. For example, there is a site believed be the grave of a First Nations man known as \\"Algonquin Joe\\", and it is traditional to put a fallen leaf on the site. The camp also features a ropes course and climbing walls. Recently, the camp completed its 100th season.Brandon Kilijansk, \\" Camp Pathfinder‚Äôs golden anniversary\\" , Amherst Bee, April 16, 2014.

It is characteristic for its use of small targets containing gunpowder, which explode on impact.  History  There is not one widely accepted theory on the origins of tejo. In fact, it is believed that many of the current theories circulating on the internet might be fictitious and a result of \\"word of mouth\\" and speculation. It is, however, widely accepted that the sport has origins in native aboriginals from the center of Colombia, where it might have been played in a similar form.History of tejo Another theory presented by the Colombian government on its website describes the game as having originated more than 500 years ago. In this theory, presented by one of the most important authorities in the country, the sport was played by native l people that would use a golden disc called zepguagoscua. This, however, is refuted in other sources as a word with sounds not existent in dictionaries of the Chibcha language. Tejo  Cultural background  Tejo is a sport much appreciated by the popular strata of society. Although there are Tejo arenas targeted towards those of a higher socio-economical strata, most of them are made and used by those of the popular class that see it as a portrait of their pre-Columbian origins. Only soccer enjoys a more numerous following and developed industry in the country. Note that Tejo, originating in Colombia, has professional teams in neighbor countries including Venezuela, Ecuador and Panama. As the cultural baggage of the sport is foreign to those countries, their following and industry are much less developed than in its country of origin.  Gameplay  Statue in honor of the sport Depending on the context, Tejo can be played in either a formal or informal sense from collecting points to professional championship tournaments. The game consists of throwing a metal puck/disc (called a tejo), across an alley at a distance of approximately 18.5 meters (ring to ring), to a one meter by one meter board covered with clay and set at a forty-five degree angle. The tablas are located at every extreme of the field. The tabla consist of a wooden frame that holds clay and a protective board to keep the tejo from hitting other elements or people in the neighboring area. Inside the frame, there is a metal pipe or car spring strong enough to withstand the continuing impacts of the tejo. This pipe is the target where the tejo is meant to hit. The pipe is set at the same angle as the post's frame (45 degrees). The tejo must be thrown from within the throwing area, and the goal is to impact the inside of the target at the other extreme. A chief characteristic of the sport is its use of small, exploding targets that contain gunpowder, commonly known as \\"mechas\\". These usually triangle-shaped envelopes with explosive material inside are set on the edges of the pipe where on impact with the tejo explode loudly creating a sound similar to the one created by a small revolver upon firing.  Score  Although scoring can be arbitrary the following format is commonly used: * Hand: It grants 1 point to the tejo that is closest at the end of a round. * Hit: It grants 3 points to every player that explodes a mecha. * Bulls-eye: It grants 6 points to that player whose tejo has impacted inside the target. * Strike: It grants 9 points to that player that has a hit and a bulls-eye in the same throw.

The clay used is anything from average mud to modeling clay, depending on the setting of the sport. The tejo gets embedded in the clay upon landing, and depending on the consistency of the clay, the tejo can be easily reached or sometimes it becomes necessary to dig a little bit to find it. This makes the consistency of the clay very important. The protective board is meant to keep the tejo within the boundaries of the field when the tejo is off target. The size is not standard, but the idea is for it to be proportionately bigger than the pitch itself. The target is usually a metal pipe cut or set in a way that it won't be easily moved by the impact of the tejo hitting it at a high speed. In most cases, it is either soldered or screwed to the frame. There are no standards on the construction of the pitch given the traditionalism of the sport.  Modern day tejo  In Colombia, it is very common to find professional tejo teams around the major cities and smaller towns. A few of the teams are sponsored by local companies or someone that loves tejo. In the past, the playing of Tejo was fueled by \\"Chicha\\" (an indigenous maize-based alcoholic beverage), but, more recently, the players refresh themselves with beer.Historia del Tejo Modern Tejo competitions are highly organized tournaments. Tournaments, known as \\"torneos Relampago,\\" are the most common, usually played in just one weekend by direct elimination of teams. Prizes include trophies, medals, and money. Household items are awarded to finalist in combination with money or coupons. Tejo has no mass media coverage, apart from the National Games, but sponsoring and very targeted marketing efforts make it attractive to brands that position themselves as \\"popular\\" since public affluence to the tournaments is numerous. Tejo has become a popular cultural activity for backpackers travelling Colombia, with a number of hostels throughout the country hosting free Tejo nights. It is also possible to find a version of the sport in which the clay, plasticine, beer and gunpowder have been eliminated, with electronic sensors instead of the traditional \\"mechas\\" to detect a hit.  Disputes related to alcohol consumption  Tejo is a sport that has been widely exploited by beer companies in Colombia. Tejo aficionados are trying to change its image in popular culture from a rowdy bar game (sport of drunks) to a serious sport with a rich history. There are no statistics on how many people consume alcohol while playing tejo. There are many people in Colombia who are in disagreement with the use of beer in this sport and some Colombians want to prohibit the sponsorship of beer companies.

An important difference between this line and the Dragon is that Black avoids playing ...d7‚Äìd6, so that they can later play ...d7‚Äìd5 in one move, if possible. Black also avoids the Yugoslav Attack, but since White has not been forced to play Nc3 yet, 5.c4 (the Mar√≥czy Bind) is possible. The Accelerated Dragon generally features a more style of play than many other variations of the Sicilian. Main line One of the main lines continues: 5. Nc3 Bg7 6. Be3 Nf6 7. Bc4 (see diagram). At this point the most important Black continuations are 7...0-0 and 7...Qa5. White should not castle after 7...Qa5, unlike in the Yugoslav Attack. 7... 0-0 is the main line, after which White should proceed with 8. Bb3. If Black plays 8...d6, White usually plays 9.f3 as in the Yugoslav Attack. Although, Black often plays 8...a5 or 8...Qa5, after which castling queenside can be dangerous, and it is often a better idea for White to castle . Passmore Variation Another common line that has been seen in tournaments continues: 5. Nxc6 bxc6 6. Qd4 Nf6 7. e5 Ng8 (7...Nd5 works as well) 8. e6 Nf6 9. exf7+ Kxf7 (see diagram). At this point both sides have equal chances. Many times the continuation 10.Bc4+ will be seen, attempting to add kingside pressure while developing a minor piece. However, Black defends easily with 10...d5 or 10...e6, resulting in a position where his king is safe. Both players can choose to play the game positionally or otherwise will have variable results. Statistically, White's best move is 10.Be2 followed with 11.0-0.

He grew up in Bedford, New Hampshire, and graduated from The Derryfield School in Manchester, New Hampshire. He was found guilty in 2006 of stealing 97 rare maps originally valued at more than US$3 million, and sentenced to 42 months in prison. Early career Formerly a dealer in early and rare maps of the world and North America, Smiley was instrumental in helping others to build up two major collections that were subsequently donated to research libraries: the Lawrence H. Slaughter collection now in the New York Public Library and the Norman B. Leventhal Collection at the Boston Public Library. Thefts and arrest On June 8, 2005, the discovery of an X-Acto blade on the floor of the reading room in the Beinecke Rare Book and Manuscript Library at Yale University led to his arrest. Although three maps on his person matched those missing from books he had just examined in the Beinecke, he protested his innocence. It was not until his court appearance a year later (June 22, 2006) that he confessed to having stolen a total of 97 maps from six institutions -- Boston Public Library, Harvard University (Houghton Library), Newberry Library (in Chicago), New York Public Library (the Rare Book and Map Divisions), and Yale University (Beinecke Library and the Sterling Memorial Library) in the United States, as well as the British Library in London. At the time of his arrest, the British Library had already identified him as a suspect and was about to call in the police. Smiley originally said he had been stealing maps for approximately seven years but later reduced that figure to four years. In August 2015, Ronald Grim, a curator of the Boston Public Library, traveled to an antiquities dealer in New York to confirm what he recognized to be a map stolen from the library years prior. It was a rare map advertised in that New York antiques dealer‚Äôs summer catalog, and had been created by explorer Samuel de Champlain in 1612. It provided a description of the New England coast and what would later become Canada. According to library records, the map was last seen by Forbes Smiley inside the library on January 2, 2003. A photograph of the map taken by the library in 1992 was key in proving the map was owned by the Boston Public Library, and after months of legal wrangling it was finally returned. The recovery of the Champlain map led to discussions on whether Smiley (still living on Martha‚Äôs Vineyard) stole more maps than recorded, and what more can be done to recover them.Stolen rare map returned to Boston Public Library - The Boston Globe Sentencing At his federal sentencing on September 27, 2006, Judge Janet Bond Arterton took note of his cooperation with the Federal Bureau of Investigation: \\"If you steal human treasures, then you will go to prison, but if you help recover them, this will be taken into account and weighed in the balance\\". Since all but ten of the 97 maps Smiley admitted stealing had been recovered, he was sentenced to three and a half years imprisonment. Later, in May 2007, he was ordered to pay US$2.3 million in restitution. (The original valuation on the stolen maps had been over US$3 million.) Reported losses by a handful of leading dealers who had unwittingly sold stolen maps acquired from Smiley ran to more than US$400,000 each in three cases; no details have been given about any reimbursement. A second sentencing before a state judge, Richard Damiani, on 13 October 2006, confirmed the earlier sentence, though the judge was critical of the trust placed in Smiley's statements by his federal counterpart. Coverage The case was widely covered across the United States and elsewhere. Smiley pleaded guilty and he was never cross-examined. Apart from the details he supplied himself, much of the available information came from journalists. Some suspected that Smiley had taken more maps than he admitted. Each of the affected libraries issued lists of missing maps. Several of the entries matched copies of books, now missing their maps, which Smiley had examined. For example, Smiley had admitted stealing from Harvard University an example of the map of the Aztec capital Tenochtitlan, illustrating a letter from Hern√°n Cort√©s (1524), but a prior photograph of the example missing from Yale's Beinecke Library proved instead that it was theirs. Several questions remain unanswered, in particular about the origin and purpose of high quality facsimiles of early maps, some found on Smiley's person when he was arrested, and others in books he examined. Smiley is the subject of a non-fiction book, The Map Thief: The Gripping Story of an Esteemed Rare-Map Dealer Who Made Millions Stealing Priceless Maps, written by Michael Blanding and published by Gotham Books on May 29, 2014. Legacy Secure stacks at the Beinecke Library As a result of Smiley's thefts, research libraries are now more aware of the vulnerability of maps illustrating volumes in their rare book collections, and are improving their documentation and security procedures. At the same time they appreciate the importance to scholars of continued access to such works. The changes are noticeable at Yale's Sterling Memorial Library, where a comprehensive program of cataloging and digitizing the early map collection is under way, funded largely by a donation of US$100,000 from William Reese, who had acted as Yale's advisor throughout the Smiley affair. Some libraries now monitor their reading rooms with continuous video surveillance. Smiley was not the first major map thief. Miles Harvey's book The Island of Lost Maps -- about the convicted map thief Gilbert Bland -- describes a number of earlier thieves including two Europeans active in or before 2001. However, Smiley may be responsible for more financial and cultural loss than any of his predecessors. Smiley was released from prison on January 15, 2010.

Kroger was a pioneering grocery innovator who introduced self-service shopping to the public in 1916. He allowed customers to enter his stores, shop, and bring the merchandise home themselves instead of waiting for a delivery. Kroger pioneered in-store bakery and meat counters. Kroger grocery stores were the first in the country to sell freshly baked goods, meat, and groceries under the same roof. Early life Kroger was born in Cincinnati, Ohio, the fifth of ten children of German immigrants John Henry and Mary Gertrude (n√©e Schlebbe) Kroger. Kroger's family lived above the dry goods store his parents owned. Due to the 1873 economic downturn Kroger's parents had to close the failing store.Charles F. Philips. \\"A History of the Kroger Grocery and Baking Company\\" in National Marketing Review, Vol. 1, No. 3 (Winter 1936), p. 204 Kroger went to work at age thirteen to help support his family. He quit his first job in a drug store because his Christian mother objected to his working Sundays. He then worked as a farmhand near Pleasant Plain, Ohio, before contracting malaria and coming home. Grocery career Kroger then began working as a door-to-door salesman for the Great Northern and Pacific Tea Co., eventually ending up at the Imperial Tea Co. The grocery was not doing well, and the two owners made Kroger a manager. Kroger turned the failing grocery around, earning the store a $ 3,100 () profit. When the owners later refused to make Kroger a partner, he invested his life savings of $372 with a partner who had borrowed $350, opening a grocery store at 66 Pearl Street in downtown Cincinnati. The unexpected overnight flood of 1884 ruined the store and the partners opened another. Early B. H. Kroger & Co. newspaper adKroger advertised the partnership stores as \\"B.H. Kroger & Co., proprietors of The Great Western Tea Co\\". The stores succeeded despite numerous growing pains. Wanting greater control over his efforts, Kroger asked his partner to buy his share in the partnership for $1,000. His partner couldn't afford the offer and agreed to sell his share to Kroger for $1,500. Kroger renamed the company \\"Kroger Grocery and Baking Co.\\", and opened four separate locations within two years. Later the company shortened the name to \\"Kroger\\". In 1902, Kroger began an acquisition program, buying 14 Dayton, Ohio grocery stores from the Cincinnati Grocery Co. He advertised extensively in local papers, which he thought led to his success.Garrison, Zachary. \\"Bernard Heinrich Kroger.\\" In Immigrant Entrepreneurship: German-American Business Biographies, 1720 to the Present, vol. 3, edited by Giles R. Hoyt. German Historical Institute. Last modified August 28, 2014. By the end of the 1920s, Kroger had acquired and opened over 5,500 stores. A pioneer in combining grocery stores with a bakery, Kroger later added formerly stand-alone meat markets to his retail grocery store concept. Kroger is credited with the creation of the successful low-cost grocery chain model that persists today. Kroger sold the company to a Wall Street banking syndicate headed by Lehman Brothers in December, 1927. He resigned as president of the Kroger Co. on January 31, 1928. Kroger ran his business with a simple motto: ‚ÄúBe particular. Never sell anything you would not want yourself.‚Äù Banking entrepreneur In 1900, Kroger invested in the creation of Provident Savings Bank and Trust. He was named president of the bank and later sold his holdings in the bank in 1928, shortly before the Wall Street Crash of 1929. During a bank crisis in 1933, he converted $15 million of his savings into cash and displayed it at the bank to demonstrate the financial soundness of the bank, averting the crisis locally. Kroger was chairman of the board of the bank at the time of his death. Kroger also served as director of the Cincinnati branch of the Federal Reserve Bank of Cleveland and as president and director of the First Bank of Palm Beach (Florida). Charitable efforts Kroger was also involved in many charitable ventures, including the opening of parks, donations to zoos, and medical research. His charitable interests included the Charles Fleischmann Endowment Fund, the Cincinnati Institute of Fine Arts, the Cincinnati Bureau of Governmental Research, the Community Chest and the Council of Social Agencies. Death and burial Having suffered \\"ill health for a number of years\\", Kroger died of a heart attack on July 21, 1938, at his summer home at Wianno, Cape Cod, Massachusetts, at the age of 78.

History The 100 acre (39 hectare) site was originally a blue metal quarry which was operated between 1859 and 1976 by the Wilson family who subsequently donated the land to the community. During early excavations, fossilised forest remnants were uncovered. Later studies found that these fossils indicated that the site was covered with tropical forest 22 million years old and include the earliest known Eucalyptus fossils. The City of Casey started redevelopment of the site into a botanic garden in 1988, and the site was officially opened by the Governor General four years later in 1992. Layout and facilities The park has two lakes which were former quarries, the large \\"Anniversary Lake\\" and the smaller \\"Basalt Lake\\" which has a sheer basalt rock face on its eastern edge and a boardwalk on its western edge. There is also a smaller marsh area near the entrance. A steep pathway leads to the Hoo Hoo Lookout Tower which has extensive views over the surrounding suburban areas. There is another vantage point at Ben's Lookout. Facilities within the park include an information centre, an amphitheatre, a playground, an education room, a bird hide, as well as barbecues, shelters and rotundas. The Hallam Bypass Trail provides access for cyclists and pedestrians. It runs along the Princes Highway, passing right by the entrance to the gardens. Botanical collection The park includes a diverse range of plants including exotic and native trees and shrubs and a rose garden. Approximately 10% of the plants are labelled.

He was named \\"8-Pass Charlie\\" by his impressed Indian adversaries at the Adampur base as he used to make eight passes, one for each bomb, on selected targets with improving efficiency instead of safely dropping all his bomb load and exiting. He is also known to have had expertise in disguising his attack run by confusing anti-aircraft gunners by cutting throttles before entering a dive. B-57 raids During the war, the bomber wing of the PAF was attacking the concentration of airfields in north India. In order to avoid enemy fighter- bombers, the B-57s operated from several different airbases, taking off and returning to different bases to hop and avoid being attacked. The B-57 bombers would arrive over their targets in a stream at intervals of about 15 minutes, which led to achieving a major disruption of the overall IAF effort.\\"PAF and the three wars.\\" defencejournal.com, 2001. Retrieved: 5 July 2010. Named by adversaries PAF B-57s The name was assigned to this unknown pilot by his impressed Indian adversaries at the Adampur base, and appears to be derived from his daring routine of making eight passes in bombing runs during every air raid over the alerted airbase to bomb selected targets with each 500 lb bomb in the moonlight, \\"and tried to carry out an effective attack each time\\", instead of dropping his entire bomb-load of 4,000 lbs during the first pass which would have allowed a safer exit for the aggressor aircraft over initial defences. Kills One of 8-Pass Charlie's confirmed kills is an Indian Air Force MiG 21s on Operational Readiness Platform (ORP) which was about to take off when he executed the first raid on the Adampur airbase at 2200 hours with his lone B-57 on 6 September, 1965. Adampur airbase's runway was also damaged.

It was first proposed by S. L. Warner in 1965 and later modified by B. G. Greenberg and coauthors in 1969. It allows respondents to respond to sensitive issues (such as criminal behavior or sexuality) while maintaining confidentiality. Chance decides, unknown to the interviewer, whether the question is to be answered truthfully, or \\"yes\\", regardless of the truth. For example, social scientists have used it to ask people whether they use drugs, whether they have illegally installed telephones, or whether they have evaded paying taxes. Before abortions were legal, social scientists used the method to ask women whether they have had abortions. The concept is somewhat similar to plausible deniability. Plausible deniability allows the subject to credibly say he did not make a statement, while the randomized response technique allows the subject to credibly say he had not been truthful when making a statement. Example  With a coin  Ask a man whether he had sex with a prostitute this month. Before he answers ask him to flip a coin. Instruct him to answer \\"yes\\" if the coin comes up tails, and truthfully, if it comes up heads. Only he knows whether his answer reflects the toss of the coin or his true experience. It is very important to assume that people who get heads will answer truthfully, otherwise the surveyor is not able to speculate. Half the people‚Äîor half the questionnaire population‚Äîget tails and the other half get heads when they flip the coin. Therefore, half of those people will answer \\"yes\\" regardless of whether they have done it. The other half will answer truthfully according to their experience. So whatever proportion of the group said \\"no\\", the true number who did not have sex with a prostitute is double that, because we assume the two halves are probably close to the same as it is a large randomized sampling. For example, if 20% of the population surveyed said \\"no\\", then the true fraction that did not have sex with a prostitute is 40%.  With cards  The same question can be asked with three cards which are unmarked on one side, and bear a question on the other side. The cards are randomly mixed, and laid in front of the subject. The subject takes one card, turns it over, and answers the question on it truthfully with either \\"yes\\" or \\"no\\". *One card asks: \\"Did you have sex with a prostitute this month?\\" *Another card asks: \\"Is there a triangle on this card?\\" (There is no triangle.) *The last card asks: \\"Is there a triangle on this card?\\" (There is a triangle.) The researcher does not know which question has been asked. Under the assumption that the \\"Yes\\" and \\"No\\" answers to the control questions cancel each other out, the number of subjects who have had sex with a prostitute is triple that of all \\"Yes\\" answers in excess of the \\"No\\" answers. Original version Warner's original version (1965) is slightly different: The sensitive question is worded in two dichotomous alternatives, and chance decides, unknown to the interviewer, which one is to be answered honestly. The interviewer gets a \\"yes\\" or \\"no\\" without knowing to which of the two questions. For mathematical reasons chance cannot be \\"fair\\" (¬Ω and ¬Ω). Let p be the probability to answer the sensitive question and EP the true proportion of those interviewed bearing the embarrassing property, then the proportion of \\"yes\\"-answers YA is composed as follows: *YA = p\\\\times EP + (1 - p)(1 - EP) Transformed to yield EP: *EP = \\\\frac{YA + p - 1}{2p - 1}  Example  *Alternative 1: \\"I have consumed marijuana.\\" *Alternative 2: \\"I have never consumed marijuana.\\" The interviewed are asked to secretly throw a dice and answer the first question only if they throw a 6, otherwise the second question (p=\\\\tfrac{1}{6}). The \\"yes\\"-answers are now composed of consumers who have thrown a 6 and non-consumers who have thrown a different number. Let the result be 75 \\"yes\\"-answers out of 100 interviewed (YA=\\\\tfrac{3}{4}). Inserted into the formula you get *EP = (\\\\tfrac{3}{4} + \\\\tfrac{1}{6} - 1) / (2\\\\times \\\\tfrac{1}{6} - 1) = \\\\tfrac{1}{8} If all interviewed have answered honestly then their true proportion of consumers is 1/8 (= 12.5%).

The lesser nighthawk has a rapid, low whistled melodious trill, lasting several seconds. It is usually heard only near breeding areas. Their breeding habitat is open country from the Southwestern United States through Central America to tropical South America. They usually nest on bare ground, sometimes in raised locations including stumps and boulders or flat house roofs. The two eggs are laid directly on bare ground‚Äîthere is no nest. Incubation is performed largely by the female and lasts for about 20 days. Young fledge at about 20 days of age. Adults flushed from the nest may try to distract the intruder or defend the nest site by aerial attack. Young birds sometimes perform a defense display by opening up their mouths and spreading their wings, looking to appear threatening and larger than they actually are before they run off. These birds are partial migrants. The lesser nighthawk retreats from the United States and northern Mexico during the winter months. Occasionally single birds may be found overwintering. The nighthawk is also occasionally found as a vagrant to the US Gulf Coast states to Florida.

A working terrier is a small type of dog which pursues its quarry into the earth. According to the Oxford English Dictionary, the name dates back to at least 1440, derived from French chien terrier 'digging dog', from Medieval Latin terrarius, ultimately from Latin terra (earth). With the growth of popularity of fox hunting in Britain in the 18th and 19th centuries, terriers were extensively bred to follow the red fox, and also the Eurasian badger, into its burrow, referred to as \\"terrier work\\" and \\"going to ground\\". The purpose of the terrier is to locate the quarry, and either bark and bolt it free or to a net, or trap or hold it so that it can be dug down to and killed or captured. Working terriers can be no wider than the animal they hunt (chest circumference or \\"span\\" less than 35 cm/14in), in order to fit into the burrows and still have room to manoeuver. As a result, the terriers often weigh considerably less than the fox (10 kg/22 lbs) and badger (12 kg/26 lbs), making these animals formidable quarry for the smaller dog. Terrier work has been condemned by British animal welfare organizations such as the League Against Cruel Sports, the International Fund for Animal Welfare, and the Royal Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals, because it can lead to underground fighting between the animals, causing serious injuries.\\"What is terrier work?\\", League Against Cruel Sports, retrieved January 16, 2007. The British National Working Terrier Federation denies that underground fighting is an issue, arguing that the terrier's role is to locate, bark, and flush out the hunted animals, not to attack them.National Working Terrier Federation. \\"Written evidence, second stage\\", Committee of Inquiry into Hunting with Dogs, UK, 10 May 2000. Hunting below ground with terriers is largely illegal in Britain under the Hunting Act 2004, unless conducted in accordance with strict conditions intended to protect game birds. Terrier work is legal in the US, Canada, Australia, South Africa, and much of continental Europe.  Requirements of a working terrier  The primary criterion of a working terrier is that it has an owner or keeper who works it. A terrier is not a working terrier by virtue of its breeding alone. The second most important quality of a working terrier is small chest size. Though the chest size of the working terrier that can be used in any given situation may rise or fall depending on the size of the den pipe, smaller dogs generally do as well as or better than larger dogs. The reason for this is rather simple: a small dog can get to the quarry without having to dig, and arrives at the quarry without fatigue. If a dog is too large, he will not be able to get past turns in the tunnel, and will have to be dug to every few feet. If a dog has to dig to the quarry when the tunnel tightens down (as it invariably will), the dog will have to push dirt behind it to progress, which can result in the dog being ‚Äúbottled‚Äù by dirt from behind. In such a situation the dog will have a very difficult time getting out on its own if it cannot turn around. With two animals underground (dog and quarry), it is essential that a flow of air be maintained to avoid asphyxiation. The tighter a dog is in the pipe, the more the air flow will be constricted. In addition, a small dog has better maneuverability and can more easily avoid being bitten. Because of this, small dogs often receive less injury underground than larger dogs, which are more likely to find themselves jammed in a den pipe, face to face with the quarry, and unable to move forward or backward. Working terriers and tools for terrier work. Other important requirements of a working terrier are an essential gameness, a good nose, and an ability to problem solve in order to avoid coming to harm underground.  Terrier work as vermin control  A wide variety of game is worked below ground with terriers, including red fox, groundhogs (also known as woodchucks), raccoons, opossums, nutria (also known as coypu), European and American badgers. According to a 1994 survey by the British Association for Shooting and Conservation, 9% of foxes killed by UK gamekeepers were killed following the use of terriers. Terrier work is not a very efficient way of hunting vermin, though over 500 members of the Royal College of Veterinary Surgeons argue that it is a humane way to reduce fox numbers, and is quite selective. Because of these characteristics, terrier work is considered an ideal way to control certain nuisance wildlife in farm country. The inefficiency of terrier work means that, unlike poisons and traps, there is no danger that a species can be wiped out over a large area, and little chance that an adult will be terminated with unseen young still in the den. In addition, collateral damage, in the form of killing non-target species, is zero. Though inefficient, a team of terriers, when coupled with an enthusiastic digger, can control red fox, raccoon or groundhog on small farms where their presence might be a problem for chickens, geese, wild bird populations, and crop production. Because terrier work is selective, animals can be dispatched, or else they can be moved and relocated to nearby farms, forests or waste areas where they will do no harm.  Early history  Terrier work, as it is known today, began with the rise of the Enclosure Movement in the late 18th Century in England. With enclosure, people were moved off the land and into cities and towns, and sheep and other livestock were moved into newly walled, hedged and fenced fields. Vast expanses of enclosed open spaces proved perfect for mounted fox hunting ‚Äì a sport that had arrived in the UK from France in the late 17th Century. The first mounted fox hunts were described by Sir Walter Scott, who also described the first working terriers in the UK. The first true breed of working terrier that bears a resemblance to what we see in the field today is the Jack Russell Terrier. The Jack Russell Terrier is named after the Reverend John Russell, whose long life (1795‚Äì1883) encompasses the entire early history of mounted fox hunts in the UK and who is credited with breeding the first fox-working white-bodied terrier used in the field today. With the rise of the Enclosure Movement in the late 18th Century and early 19th Century came the control of sires and the rapid improvement in livestock herds. As breeds were improved, livestock shows were held to display these improvements. From these livestock shows grew the first dog shows. The first dog show appeared in the UK in 1859, the same year that Charles Darwin‚Äôs the \\"Origin of Species\\" was first published. Both Darwin‚Äôs book and the first dog shows drew much of their inspiration from the rapid ‚Äúspeciation‚Äù of new livestock breeds that had first begun with Robert Bakewell‚Äôs efforts to control sire selection. If livestock breeds could be rapidly ‚Äúimproved‚Äù through controlled breeding, clearly the same thing could be done with dogs. Between 1800 and 1865, the number of dog breeds in the UK climbed from 15 to over 50, and it exploded even further with the creation of the Kennel Club in 1873. With the rise of Kennel Club dogs shows, every manner of rough working dog was soon being put up as an \\"ancient breed.\\" In fact, most of these breeds were very new or even one-off dogs, and most histories were invented or dramatically elaborated on by get-rich-quick breed promoters.  Rootstock  In the world of working terriers, there are but two roots ‚Äì colored dogs from the north (Scotland), and white dogs from the south (England and Wales). From these two roots spring a variety of Kennel Club dogs and every type of working terrier commonly found in the field today. The \\"Fell Terrier\\" is the original non-pedigree colored working dog of the north. From this diverse gene pool has sprung the Kennel Club Welsh Terrier, the Lakeland Terrier and the Border Terrier. Today, only the Border Terrier is occasionally found in the field. This is not to say the working Fell Terrier has disappeared‚Äîit still exists by that name among working terrier enthusiasts. Today's working Fell Terrier may be brown, black, red, or black-and-tan, and may be smooth, wire or broken coated. The dog may be called a Fell terrier or a \\"working Lakeland\\" or a \\"Patterdale Terrier.\\" A German variety of the Fell Terrier is called the \\"Jagdterrier,\\" but the standard for this dog is on the large size, and as a consequence it is most useful in large pipes, artificial earths, or when it has been bred down to a 12‚Äì13 inch size. From the southern part of England have come the white fox-working dogs whose origins are the same as those of the Jack Russell Terrier. Kennel Club breeds derived from these mainly-white coated dogs include the Smooth Fox Terrier, the Wire Fox Terrier, the Sealyham Terrier and (most recently), the Parson Russell Terrier and Russell Terrier. None of these Kennel Club breeds are commonly found working in the field today. The absence of white-bodied working dogs in the Kennel Club does not mean that white fox-working dogs have disappeared. The working Jack Russell Terrier is still very much alive and is as common as ever, presenting itself in an astounding variety of coats (smooth, broken and wire coated or rough), sizes (10 inches to 15 inches tall with most working dogs sized 10 to 13 inches tall), and coat colors (from pure white to 49 percent colored with tan and black markings). There is even a new type of working Jack Russell ‚Äì the ‚ÄúPlummer Terrier‚Äù first created by Brian Plummer in the 1970s and breeding true since the mid-1980s. What of all of the other Kennel Club breeds of terriers? Most of these terrier were never true working terriers. Some were small farm dogs used to catch rats and keep foxes from invading the farm yard. Some saw work as turnspit dogs or were used by farmers to bust rabbits from hedges and thickets. Most, however, were created as pets and remain as pets to this day. The rather pedestrian history of most of the terriers breeds created between 1850 and 1910, is that these dogs were created for the show ring by for-profit breeders and show ring enthusiasts. Most of these terrier breeds never saw underground terrier work of any kind. Occasionally an early breeder of one terrier type or another is reported to have worked his or her dog, but the story is generally vague and almost always episodic. Let it be said simply: the fact that a handful of prototype dogs of a given breed allegedly did a small bit of work more than 100 years ago does not qualify the breed to be considered a \\"working dog.\\" Terrier work is not something that disappeared with schooners, candles and buggy whips; it is a continuing pastime, and the dogs working in the field today are the same type of working terrier that have always existed.  Tools and technique  The tools used for terrier work have essentially remained unchanged for more than 400 years ‚Äì a small-chested and very game working terrier, a good roundpoint shovel, a digging bar, a brushhook to clear away hedge and bramble, fox nets, water for the dog and digger, and a snare to remove the quarry or a gun or blunt instrument to dispatch it. The only ‚Äúmodern‚Äù piece of equipment found in a terrierman‚Äôs kit that would look foreign to a terrierman from the late 18th Century is an electronic radio collar used to help locate the dog underground and speed the dig. Locator collars have greatly increased the safety of dogs when underground, and no sensible digger will put a dog to ground without one today. Controversy in the UK Terrier work has come under criticism from animal welfare groups in the UK, particularly in connection with fox hunting, where terriers may be used to flush out a fox who has gone underground. This has led to the terriers attacking the foxes rather than flushing them out, causing a very distressing and prolonged death of the fox, serious damage to the terrier or even death of the terrier on occasions. The Countryside Alliance have been challenged on their statements of claiming that no distressing and prolonged deaths occur during digging out or flushing out of foxes.http://www.DiggingOut.org/ NB: some possibly distressing images Organisations such as the League Against Cruel Sports have produced a range of reports on the working terrier. Alan Williams, MP for Swansea West proposed a private members bill, the Protection of Dogs Bill, seeking to ban the activity in 1994, but it was not banned in the UK until the passage of the Hunting Act 2004. The Act outlaws terrier work unless it complies with a number of strict conditions designed for gamekeepers.

The rocket is capable of lofting a 79 lb (36 kg) payload to a sub-orbital trajectory with an apogee of about 71.5 miles (115 km). It takes only 60 seconds to cross the K√°rm√°n line (the official \\"edge of space\\" at 100 km). All launches are sub-orbital, so that they do not complete one orbital revolution. Launches are conducted from the company launch facility at Spaceport America in Upham, New Mexico. Description The rocket is 20 feet (6 m) long and 10 inches (25 cm) in diameter, and consists of a single stage powered by a single solid fuel rocket engine. Typical flights last about 13 minutes, with more than 4 minutes of weightlessness. The rocket is reportedly capable of reaching up to 225 km (140 miles) altitude, though its standard apogee is closer to 115 km (71 miles). Launches The first launch, SL-1 was made at 2:14 p.m. local time (20:14 UTC) on September 25, 2006, from Spaceport America. During its maiden flight, it experienced an \\"unexpected aerodynamic effect\\" and crashed in the New Mexico desert after reaching only 40,000 feet (12 km). The second launch, SL-2 originally scheduled for October 21, 2006, was successfully carried out on April 28, 2007 at 8:56 a.m. local time (14:56 UTC). UP Aerospace president Jerry Larson had said the rocket was assembled and had been on the launch rail since Tuesday (24 April). The primary payload, Celestis Legacy, consisted of cremated human remains including those of astronaut Gordon Cooper and Star Trek actor James Doohan, whose ashes were also on board the ill-fated Falcon 1 when it malfunctioned in August 2008. As of 23 November 2019, UP Aerospace has conducted a total of 18 launches, including 13 with SpaceLoft XL rockets, most of which have been successful. The third launch, which was conducted at 14:00 UTC on 2 May 2009, carrying student experiments and the Discovery payload for Celestis, had an electronic anomaly causing an early separation and failed to reach the correct apogee. To date, the highest altitude achieved by the rocket was reached by SL-9, which set a Spaceport America altitude record of 77.25 miles (124 km) on October 23, 2014.

Early life Inkpaduta was born in what later became the Dakota Territory shortly before the start of the 19th century, the son of chief Wamdisapa (Black Eagle). As a child he contracted smallpox, which killed several of his relatives and family members. The disease left him badly scarred for life. After his father was later murdered in a tribal dispute, the band moved to Iowa, near present day Fort Dodge. Career Inkpaduta and his band were not signatories with the rest of the Wahpekute to the 1851 Treaty of Mendota, which transferred the land in northwestern Iowa to the United States. They refused to recognize the treaty restrictions. In 1852, Henry Lott, a drunken white whiskey trader, killed the new chief (Inkpaduta's older brother) and nine of his family; and Inkpaduta succeeded his brother as chief. He told the U.S. Army of the murders, but little was done to bring Lott to justice. The local prosecuting attorney nailed the dead chief's head to a pole over his house. In the late winter of 1857, which was severe, Inkpaduta led his starving band into Iowa, where on March 8, he launched a series of raids on white settlers in the Spirit Lake area, in which a total of 38 people were killed. The European-Americans called this the Spirit Lake Massacre. His warriors took four young women captive; three were married and Abbie Gardner was age 14. Although chased by a civilian corps from Fort Ridgely in Minnesota, Inkpaduta and his band evaded capture.\\"Spirit Lake Massacre\\", Encyclop√¶dia Britannica, accessed 4 April 2016 They killed two of the women along the way (possibly because they could not keep up), and released the third relatively quickly. The following summer in 1858, the US succeeded in negotiating the ransom of the girl Abbie Gardner, who was returned to Spirit Lake. She later became known for her memoir about the events and her captivity, published in 1888 to great success, with repeated editions and two reprintings by the early twentieth century. By the time of the Dakota War of 1862, during the American Civil War, Inkpaduta had already been driven out of Minnesota, with the help of other Dakota who didn't wish to put their own annuity goods and money at risk. After many of the Dakota were driven out of the state following the 1862 war, the Army sent two major punitive expeditions into Dakota Territory; one in 1863 under Brig. Gen. Henry Hastings Sibley, who defeated the Indians in a series of battles, and another, larger expedition under Brig. Gen. Alfred Sully in 1864 which concluded with the Indians' defeat in the decisive Battle of Killdeer Mountain. Inkpaduta's band withdrew westward with their Lakota cousins, and the chief migrated with survivors onto the Great Plains. He eventually fell in with the Lakotas (the Western or Teton Sioux) and became friends with Sitting Bull. He fought with the Lakota in the Battle of Little Bighorn against George Armstrong Custer. When Sitting Bull and his followers fled to Canada following the battle, Inkpaduta accompanied them. He died in Manitoba in 1881.

It appears as an axiom in the works of Gottfried Leibniz (New Essays, IV, 16: \\"la nature ne fait jamais des sauts\\", \\"nature does not make jumps\\"), one of the inventors of the infinitesimal calculus (see Law of Continuity). It is also an essential element of Charles Darwin's treatment of natural selection in his Origin of Species.Charles Darwin, Origin of Species, 1859, p. 194; see p. 173 in the 1860 US edition, at this link The Latin translation comes from Linnaeus' Philosophia Botanica.Carolus Linnaeus, Philosophia Botanica, 1st ed., 1751, Chapter III, ¬ß 77, p. 27. Overview The principle expresses the idea that natural things and properties change gradually, rather than suddenly. In a mathematical context, this allows one to assume that the solutions of the governing equations are continuous, and also does not preclude their being differentiable (differentiability implies continuity). Modern day quantum mechanics is sometimes seen as violating the principle, with its idea of a quantum leap.Marxists.org and Arizona.edu Erwin Schr√∂dinger in his objections to quantum jumps supported the principle, and initially developed his wave mechanics in order to remove these jumps. In the biological context, the principle was used by Charles Darwin and others to defend the evolutionary postulate that all species develop from earlier species through gradual and minute changes rather than through the sudden emergence of new forms. Modern evolutionary biology has terminology suggesting both continuous change, such as genetic drift, and discontinuous variation, such as mutation. However, as the basic structure of DNA is discrete, nature is now widely understood to make jumps at the biological level, if only on a very small scale. Variant forms The principle is also variously referred to as: *Natura in operationibus suis non facit saltum (transl.: \\"Nature in its operations doesn't make a (any) jump\\") -- 1613 appearance of a similar expression.Texlog.de *Natura non saltum facit (literally, \\"Nature does not make a jump\\") is a variant form, sometimes attributed to Gottfried Leibniz. Extract of page 289. Natura non facit saltum is also the epigraph of Alfred Marshall's Principles of Economics. An admirer of Herbert Spencer, Marshall intended the epigraph both to proclaim his adherence to evolutionary thought and to justify his use of differential calculus as an analytical tool‚Äîa use seen in all the seminal thinkers of neoclassical economics. The spelling variation (saltus vs. saltum) displays a mere numeral difference; because the Latin noun saltus, meaning \\"leap\\", belongs to the 4th declension; so its singular accusative is saltum (leap), while the plural is saltus (leaps). *Die Natur macht keine Spr√ºnge -- German translation of the phrase.

The period also saw the first widespread use of man-made fibers, especially rayon for dresses and viscose for linings and lingerie, and synthetic nylon stockings. The zipper became widely used. These essentially U.S. developments were echoed, in varying degrees, in Britain and Europe. Suntans (called at the time \\"sunburns\\") became fashionable in the early 1930s, along with travel to the resorts along the Mediterranean, in the Bahamas, and on the east coast of Florida where one can acquire a tan, leading to new categories of clothes: white dinner jackets for men and beach pajamas, halter tops, and bare midriffs for women.Wilcox, R.

Overview  The lighthearted, forward-looking attitude and fashions of the late 1920s lingered through most of 1930,Flapper dresses but by the end of that year the effects of the Great Depression began to affect the public, and a more conservative approach to fashion displaced that of the 1920s. For women, skirts became longer and the waist-line was returned up to its normal position. Other aspects of fashion from the 1920s took longer to phase out. Cloche hats remained popular until about 1933 while short hair remained popular for many women until late in the 1930s and even in the early 1940s. The Great Depression took its toll on the 1930s womenswear due to World War II which dates from 1939-1945. This greatly affected the fashion of how women dressed during the 1940s era. According to Shrimpton \\"Committed to ensuring the fair distribution of scarce but essential resources, namely food, clothing, and furniture, the government introduced a comprehensive rationing scheme based on allocation of coupons - a system deriving, ironically, from the German rationing plan devised in November 1930.\\" Because of the economic crash, designers were forced to slash prices for clothing in order to keep their business afloat, especially those working in couture houses. Designers were also forced to use cheaper fabric and materials, and dress patterns also grew in popularity as many women knew how to sew. Hence, clothing was made more accessible, and there was also a continuation of mass production, which was rising in popularity since the 1920s. The 1930s allowed women from all classes and socio backgrounds to be fashionable, regardless of wealth. With prices slashes on types of fabrics utilized for designing, new inventions such as the zip made garments quicker and cheaper to make. This was also influenced by the rise in women entering the workforce alongside the rise of the business girl, as they still were able to afford to dress well and stay in style. Daywear also had to be functional, but it never lost its touch of elegance or femininity, as the dresses would still naturally highlight the female or womanly shape with cinched waistlines, skirts fitted to the hip and fullness added to the hem with flared gores or pleats. Frilled rayon blouses also went with the cinched waist. Because clothes were rationed and fabric was scarcer, the hem lines of dresses rose to knee length. The main sort of dress in the 1940s included features such as an hour glass shape figure, broad shoulders, nipped in high waist tops and A line skirts that came down to just at the knee. Many different celebrities who embraced this type of style such as Joan Crawford, Ginger Rogers, Barbara Stanwyck, and Ava Gardner. Even though daywear dresses were influenced by the war, evening dresses remained glamorous. Women's undergarments became the soul of fashion in the 1940s because it maintained the critical hourglass shape with smooth lines. Clothes became utilitarian. Pants or trousers were considered a menswear item only until the 1940s. Women working in factories first wore men's pants but over time, factories began to make pants for women out of fabric such as cotton, denim, or wool. Coats were long and down to the knee for warmth. Major fashion magazines at the time including Vogue continued to cater to the fashionable and wealthy women of the 1930s to continue reporting and reflecting the most popular trends in that time period, despite the impact the economic crash had on them. The wealthiest still managed to afford and keep up with the most high-end or the most coveted designs and maintain their lifestyle.  Fashion and the movies  Indian saree made from chiffon fabric, inspired by the evening dresses of Hollywood starlets. Throughout the 1930s and early 1940s, a second influence vied with Paris couturiers as a wellspring for ideas: the American cinema.Ewing, Elizabeth: History of 20th Century Fashion, London, 1974, p. 97, 1997 revised edition, As Hollywood movies gained their popularities, general public idolized movie stars as their role models. Paris- based fashion houses were losing their power and influences in most major fashion trends during these years. Many American and European moviegoers were fascinated by and got interested in overall fashion including clothes and hairstyles of movie stars which led to various fashion trends. After the movie Tarzan, animal prints became popular. On the other hand, different styles such as bias-cut, satin, Jean Harlow-style evening dresses and the casual look of Katharine Hepburn also became famous. Paris designers such as Elsa Schiaparelli and Lucien Lelong acknowledged the impact of film costumes on their work. LeLong said \\"We, the couturiers, can no longer live without the cinema any more than the cinema can live without us. We corroborate each others' instinct.Quoted in LaValley, \\"Hollywood and Seventh Avenue\\" The 1890s leg-o-mutton sleeves designed by Walter Plunkett for Irene Dunne in 1931's Cimarron helped to launch the broad-shouldered look,LaValley, \\"Hollywood and Seventh Avenue\\", in Hollywood and History: Costume Design in Film and Adrian's little velvet hat worn tipped over one eye by Greta Garbo in Romance (1930) became the \\"Empress Eug√©nie hat ... Universally copied in a wide price range, it influenced how women wore their hats for the rest of the decade.\\" During late 1920s to early 1940s, Gilbert Adrian was the head of the costume department at Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer, the most prestigious and famous Hollywood movie studio. He produced numerous signature styles for the top actresses of the period, as well as countless fashion fads during those times. One of his popular dresses was gingham dress, a cotton dress with a checked or striped pattern, that he made for Judy Garland for the movie The Wizard of Oz in 1939, and for Katharine Hepburn for the movie The Philadelphia Story in 1940. Movie costumes were covered not only in film fan magazines, but in influential fashion magazines such as Women's Wear Daily, Harper's Bazaar, and Vogue. Adrian's puff-sleeved gown for Joan Crawford Letty Lynton was copied by Macy's in 1932 and sold over 500,000 copies nationwide.Leese, Elizabeth: Costume Design in the Movies, Dover Books, 1991, , p. 18 The dress was appraised as one of the most influential pieces in the era‚Äôs fashion, inspiring numerous designers to showcase similar styles in their own work. One of Crawford‚Äôs widely influential pieces was a white organdy dress with ruffle adornments. With the use of shoulder pads, the dress made the movement freer, emphasizing the back by removing adornments previously popularized in the 1920s. One of the most stylistically influential films of the 1930s was 1939's Gone with the Wind. The dresses in the movie were designed with simplified adornments and a mixture of different monotone hues as opposed to using a varied color palette. This was considered to be Plunkett's intentional design to utilize modernism, the emerging aesthetic of the 1930s. Plunkett received praise for producing costumes that adequately harmonized the era of the movie with the aesthetic sense of the late 1930s. The costumes brought back the Neo-Victorian style, as well as strong use of symbolic color. It inspired the Princess Ballgown, a Victorian style dress reduced to full A line skirts with petticoats underneath for fullness. It was the most popular style for teens going to prom. Plunkett's \\"barbecue dress\\" for Vivien Leigh as Scarlett O'Hara was the most widely copied dress after the Duchess of Windsor's wedding costume, and Vogue credited the \\"Scarlett O'Hara\\" look with bringing full skirts worn over crinolines back into wedding fashion after a decade of sleek, figure-hugging styles. Lana Turner's 1937 film They Won't Forget made her the first Sweater girl, an informal look for young women relying on large breasts pushed up and out by bras, which continued to be influential into the 1950s, and was arguably the first major style of youth fashion. Travis Banton gained his fame by, after working at a couture house in New York, designing costumes for Marlene Dietrich as a head designer of Paramount. His style was softer and more alluring than Adrian's, embodying femininity by his sense of balance with the use of Vionnet's bias-cut, and was known for refined concepts of simple lines and classic styles. Many famous movie stars during the 1930s such as Magdalene Dietrich and Mae West at Paramount became the models of wit, intellect and beauty through Banton's elegant costumes. The costumes he made for Dietrich for various movies such as Shanghai Express 1932, and The Scarlet Empress 1934 portray her sharp regality. Retail clothing and accessories inspired by the period costumes of Adrian, Plunkett, Travis Banton, Howard Greer, and others influenced what women wore until war-time restrictions on fabric stopped the flow of lavish costumes from Hollywood.  Hard chic and feminine flutters  Queen Elizabeth wears long gloves with a short-sleeved dress and dramatic hat to visit the 1939 New York World's Fair. Jean Patou, who had first raised hemlines to 18\\" off the floor with his \\"flapper\\" dresses of 1924, had begun lowering them again in 1927, using Vionnet's handkerchief hemline to disguise the change. By 1930, longer skirts and natural waists were shown everywhere.Brockman, Theory of Fashion Design, pp. 40‚Äì52 But it is Schiaparelli who is credited with \\"changing the outline of fashion from soft to hard, from vague to definite.\\" She introduced the zipper, synthetic fabrics, simple suits with bold color accents, tailored evening gowns with matching jackets, wide shoulders, and the color shocking pink to the fashion world. By 1933, the trend toward wide shoulders and narrow waists had eclipsed the emphasis on the hips of the later 1920s. Wide shoulders would remain a staple of fashion until after World War II. In contrast with the hard chic worn by the \\"international set\\". designers such as Britain's Norman Hartnell made soft, pretty dresses with fluttering or puffed sleeves and loose calf- length skirts suited to a feminine figure. His \\"white mourning\\"The Queen's mother had died in June 1938. wardrobe for the new Queen Elizabeth's 1938 state visit to Paris started a brief rage for all-white clothing.Garland, Madge, in J. Anderson Black and Madge Garland, A History of Fashion, pp. 324‚Äì239 Feminine curves were highlighted in the 1930s through the use of the bias-cut. Madeleine Vionnet was an early innovator of the bias-cut, using it to create clinging dresses that draped over the body's contours.Bryant, Nancy O. \\"The interrelationship between decorative and structural design in Madeleine Vionnet's Work\\", Costume 1991, V 25, pp. 73‚Äì88 Advertisement for women's fashion at McWhirters department store, Brisbane, Australia, 1941 Through the mid-1930s, the natural waistline was often accompanied by emphasis on an empire line. Short bolero jackets, capelets, and dresses cut with fitted midriffs or seams below the bust increased the focus on breadth at the shoulder. By the late 1930s, emphasis was moving to the back, with halter necklines and high-necked but backless evening gowns with sleeves. Evening gowns with matching jackets were worn to the theatre, nightclubs, and elegant restaurants. Skirts remained at mid-calf length for day, but the end of the 1930s Paris designers were showing fuller skirts reaching just below the knee; this practical length (without the wasteful fullness) would remain in style for day dresses through the war years. Other notable fashion trends in this period include the introduction of the ensemble (matching dresses or skirts and coats) and the handkerchief skirt, which had many panels, insets, pleats or gathers. The clutch coat was fashionable in this period as well; it had to be held shut as there was no fastening. By 1945, adolescents began wearing loose, poncho-like sweaters called sloppy joes. Full, gathered skirts, known as the dirndl skirt, became popular around 1945.Tortora, P., & Eubank, K. (2005). A survey of historic costume. pp 400‚Äì450. New York: Fairchild Accessories were vital components of an outfit, this 1943 black business suit was accessorized with a halo hat, black gloves and pink clutch bag  Accessories  Gloves were \\"enormously important\\" in this period. They were a type of accessory that came to be seen as more of a comfort rather than for style. The elaborate trim was removed and was replaced by plain gloves. Evening gowns were accompanied by elbow length gloves, and day costumes were worn with short or opera-length gloves of fabric or leather. Manufacturers and retailers introduced coordinating ensembles of hat, gloves and shoes, or gloves and scarf, or hat and bag, often in striking colours. For spring 1936, Chicago's Marshall Field's department store offered a black hat by Lilly Dach√© trimmed with an antelope leather bow in \\"Pernod green, apple blossom pink, mimosa yellow or carnation blush\\" and suggested a handbag to match the bow.Marshall Field & Company, Fashions of the Hour, Spring 1936, p. 2 When war broke out in 1939, many women purchased handbags with a respirator pouch due to fear of poison gas attacks.Rationed fashion  Sportswear  During the mid to late 1930s, swimsuits became more revealing than those of the 1920s, and often featured lower necklines and no sleeves. These were made from nylon and rayon instead of the traditional wool, and no longer included a short modesty skirt.1930s beachwear Experimental swimsuits made from spruce wood veneer were a fad in the early 1930s, but did not catch on among the mainstream.Spruce bathing suit  Marriage of Wallis Simpson and King Edward VIII (from January 1936 until his abdication)  Notable American socialite was Wallis Simpson and her marriage to Prince Edward was also seen as influential trendsetters during the 1930s period of fashion. Their marriage was historical, been called ‚ÄúThe Greatest Love Story of the 20th Century‚Äù by some, due to the fact that Prince Edward was royalty and in line for the throne. However, his love affair with Wallis Simpson is what attracted attention and made headlines. Simpson was not only a socialite, but she was American and a divorcee, both of which were deal breakers for the royal family at the time. As Prince Edward found he could not marry Simpson on these circumstances, he did the unthinkable by giving up the throne to marry her. As the two wed in 1937, their marriage marked a more progressive mindset that people slowly began to adopt, as people already wanted to ditch old traditions and trade it for new ones, especially for those in the royal family. Their wedding and marriage was well chronicled by Vogue, including a spread of Wallis Simpson before her wedding day, captured by iconic fashion photographer, Cecil Beaton, which included the iconic ‚ÄúLobster dress‚Äù by Elsa Schiaparelli, which included a hand-painted lobster by Salvador Dal√≠, a significant surrealist artist and painter in the 1930s.  War years  Wartime austerity led to restrictions on the number of new clothes that people bought and the amount of fabric that clothing manufacturers could use. Women working on war service adopted trousers as a practical necessity. The United States government requisitioned all silk supplies, forcing the hosiery industry to completely switch to nylon. In March 1942 the government then requisitioned all nylon for parachutes and other war uses, leaving only the unpopular cotton and rayon stockings. The industry feared that not wearing stockings would become a fad, and advised stores to increase hosiery advertising. When nylon stockings reappeared in the shops there were \\"nylon riots\\" as customers fought over the first deliveries. In Britain, clothing was strictly rationed, with a system of \\"points\\", and the Board of Trade issued regulations for \\"Utility Clothes\\" in 1941. In America the War Production Board issued its Regulation L85 on March 8, 1942, specifying restrictions for every item of women's clothing.WPB \\"Yardstick\\" and discussion of L85 regulations at Costumes.org , retrieved 21 October 2007 Because the military used so much green and brown dye, manufacturers used more red dye in clothing. Easily laddered stockings were a particular concern in Britain; women were forced to either paint them on (including the back seam) or to join the WRNS, who continued to issue them, in a cunning aid to recruitment. Later in the war, American soldiers became a source of the new nylon stockings. Most women wore skirts at or near knee-length, with simply-cut blouses or shirts and square- shouldered jackets. Popular magazines and pattern companies advised women on how to remake men's suits into smart outfits, since the men were in uniform and the cloth would otherwise sit unused. Eisenhower jackets became popular in this period. Influenced by the military, these jackets were bloused at the chest and fitted at the waist with a belt. The combination of neat blouses and sensibly tailored suits became the distinctive attire of the working woman, college girl, and young society matron.Kemper, Rachel H: \\"Costume\\" (1992) pg. 144 The shirtwaist dress, an all-purpose garment, also emerged during the 1930s. The shirtwaist dress was worn for all occasions, besides those that were extremely formal, and were modest in design. The dress could either have long or short sleeves, a modest neckline and skirt that fell below the knee. The bust was rounded but not particularly emphasized and the waistline was often belted in its normal position. Pockets were both functional and used for decoration and were accompanied by buttons down the front, around the sides or up the back of the dress. These dresses often were accompanied by coordination coats, which were made out of contrasting fabric but lined with the dress fabric. The jacket was often constructed in a boxy fashion and had wide lapels, wide shoulders and numerous pockets. The dress and coat combination created an overall effect of sensibility, modesty and girl next door lifestyle that contrasted the very popular, second-skin like style of the bias-cut evening gown. Women wearing snoods in a factory Women's fashion in vacation in Lake Balaton in Hungary (1939).  Headwear  Woman wearing a turban during wartime with all the fashionable accessories. The 1940s was a period marked by iconic headwear. Because of the war, current European fashion was no longer available to women in the United States. In 1941, hatmakers failed to popularize Chinese and American Indian-based designs, causing one milliner to lament \\"How different when Paris was the fountainhead of style\\". As with hosiery hatmakers feared that bareheadness would become popular, and introduced new designs such as \\"Winged Victory Turbans\\" and \\"Commando Caps\\" in \\"Victory Gold\\". American designers, who were often overlooked, became more popular as American women began to wear their designs. American designers of ready-to-wear contributed in other ways too. They made improvements to sizing standards and began to use fiber content and care labels in clothing.Harris, Kristina, Vintage Fashions for Women, 1920s-1940s, Schiffer Publishing Ltd., 1996, p. 137. Hats were one of the few pieces of clothing that was not rationed during WWII, therefore there was a lot of attention paid to these headpieces. Styles ranged from turbans to straw hats. The snood was an important accessory to a woman working in the factory. Snoods were fashionable and functional at the same time, they enabled factory women who were wearing pants and jumpsuits to still look feminine. Snoods pulled hair out of the face by containing it all at the back of the head in a hanging net. With all the long hair hanging in the net, the front of the hair was left out and could be curled and styled to glamourize the factory uniforms. Other popular headpieces were variations of headscarves, such as the bandana Rosie the Riveter is pictured wearing in the recruitment posters. Another variation of the headscarf was simply tying a square scarf folded in half under the chin. Later in the 1950s and 60s these headscarves became highly glamorized by celebrities like Audrey Hepburn, Brigitte Bardot, and Jacqueline Kennedy. This glamorized look came from women in the 1940s who wore headscarves over their victory rolls in order to make their simple clothes look dressed up. Draped turbans ‚Äì sometimes fashioned from headscarves ‚Äì also made an appearance in fashion, representing the working woman of the period. These were worn by women of all classes.This type of headwear could be glamorous or practical. Turbans were the most functional for the working woman because she was able to have all her hair out of her face and skip washing her hair by covering it with the turban. Both turbans and headscarves were useful for hiding curlers so when a woman got off work all she had to do was take out her curlers and her hair would be set for a night out. All these alternative options to hats were popular, not only for function and glamour, but also because the look could be achieved quite inexpensively.  Swimwear  Woman wearing a swimsuit in swimming pool in Hungary in 1938. Typical 1945 two-piece swimsuit worn by Gene Tierney An important style that became popular due to the war was the two-piece swimsuit which later led to the Bikini. In 1942, the War Production Board passed a law called the L-85 which put restrictions on clothing production. For swimwear companies the L-85 meant they had to use 10 percent less fabric in all their designs, as a result swimsuits became smaller. Swimsuits had been becoming more minimal for a while but in 1944 Tina Leser debuted one of the first two-piece swimsuits. Even though the bottoms were high waisted, cut low on the legs, and paired with a modest bandeau, Lesers‚Äô two piece was still considered a daring style for the era. According to Sarah Kennedy, author of The Swimsuit: A History of Twentieth-Century Fashion, unlike the bikini the two-piece was created out of necessity and was not meant to be shocking. Apparently there was an unspoken rule that bellybuttons must never show which accounts for the high waisted bottoms. Despite it being scandalous to some, the two-piece was eventually accepted because there really wasn't another option. The L-85 did not only make swimsuits smaller, but it also pushed designers to become more creative with their designs, this led to suits that accentuated and drew attention to women's bodies. This was done by putting boning in the swimwear. Two years after Leser debuted one of the first two- pieces, the bikini was invented in 1946 by a French engineer named Louis R√©ard. It was apparently named after the Bikini Atoll, which was the site of a nuclear bomb test in 1946, because R√©ard hoped its impact would be explosive in the fashion world. The bikini was even more daring than the two-piece, thus it did not become popular until 1953 when Brigitte Bardot was photographed in one at the Cannes Film Festival. Although the bikini did become popular in Europe in 1953 it did not become popular in the United States until the 1960s. ;  Style gallery 1930s  Image:Mae West NYWTS detail.jpg|1 ‚Äì 1933 Image:Girl in Dallas 1934.jpg|2 ‚Äì 1934 Image:Girl in Dallas 1930s.jpg|3 ‚Äì 1935 Image:Elisabeth Bergner cropped.jpg|4 ‚Äì 1935 Image:Young woman in 1936.jpg|5 ‚Äì 1936 Image:Young Woman Learning to Sew 1936.gif|6 ‚Äì 1936 Image:Alfonsina Storni Mar del Plata.jpg|7 ‚Äì 1936 Image:Window shopping at Simpsons 2.jpg|8-1937 File:HarryAnaJuly1938B.jpg|9-1938 File:Face protection from snowstorms.jpg|10-1939 #Actress Mae West wears a fur coat and a small asymmetric hat, 1933. #Girl in Dallas, Texas wears a sweater and mid-calf length skirt with pleats, 1934. #Young woman wearing a long, form-fitting dress with puffed sleeves, 1935. #Actress Elisabeth Bergner wears a fashionably tilted hat and a leopard fur coat, 1935. # Young woman wears her hair in short, hard curls framing her face, but smooth at the crown to accommodate her small hat, 1936. #Young woman wears a printed dress fitted through the midriff with short puffed sleeves, Minnesota, 1936. # Writer Alfonsina Storni at the beach resort city of Mar del Plata, 1936. #Window shoppers outside Simpsons department store in Toronto, Ontario, Canada, 1937. #Middle aged couple, USA, July, 1938 #Plastic face protection from snowstorms.

Menswear Conductor Leonard Bernstein in sportswear of 1945: open-collared shirt, striped blazer, and wide-legged pleated slacks Men's neckties often had bold, geometric patterns as can be seen in this photograph taken in 1944  Overview  For men, the most noticeable effect of the general sobering associated with the Great Depression was that the range of colors became more subdued. The bright colors popular in the 1920s fell out of fashion.  Suits  By the early 1930s, the \\"drape cut\\" or \\"London Drape\\" suit championed by Frederick Scholte, tailor to the Prince of Wales, was taking the world of men's fashion by storm. The new suit was softer and more flexible in construction than the suits of the previous generation; extra fabric in the shoulder and armscye, light padding, a slightly nipped waist, and fuller sleeves tapered at the wrist resulted in a cut with flattering folds or drapes front and back that enhanced a man's figure. The straight leg wide-trousers (the standard size was 23 inches at the cuff) that men had worn in the 1920s also became tapered at the bottom for the first time around 1935. The new suit was adopted enthusiastically by Hollywood stars including Fred Astaire, Cary Grant, and Gary Cooper, who became the new fashion trendsetters after the Prince's abdication and exile. By the early 1940s, Hollywood tailors had exaggerated the drape to the point of caricature, outfitting film noir mobsters and private eyes in suits with heavily padded chests, enormous shoulders, and wide flowing trousers. Musicians and other fashion experimenters adopted the most extreme form of the drape, the zoot suit, with very high waists, pegged trousers, and long coats.Boyer (1990).Walker, Richard: The Savile Row Story, Prion, 1988,  Formal wear  In the early 1930s, new forms of summer evening clothes were introduced as appropriate for the popular seaside resorts. The waist-length white mess jacket, worn with a cummerbund rather than a waistcoat, was modeled after formal clothing of British officers in tropical climates. This was followed by a white dinner jacket, single or double-breasted. Both white jackets were worn black bow ties and black trousers trimmed with braid down the side seams.  Sportswear  By 1933, knickerbockers and plus-fours, which had been commonly worn as sports-clothes in the 1920s had lost favor to casual trousers among the fashionable. In Britain and South Africa, brightly striped blazers in red, white and blue were often worn in the summer both as informal wear, and for sports such as tennis, rowing or cricket. This continued until wartime rationing rendered the distinctive fabric unobtainable.South African blazer  Accessories  The most common hat of this period was the fedora, often worn tipped down over one eye at a rakish angle. The more conservative Homburg also remained popular, especially among older people and even began to be worn with semi-formal evening clothes in place of the tophat, which in turn became confined to wear with formal. Neckties were wide, and bold geometric designs were popular, including stripes, and quadrilateral designs.  Wartime restrictions  Many things affected the style of clothes that people wore. Austerity also affected men's civilian clothes during the war years. The British \\"Utility Suit\\" and American \\"Victory Suit\\" were both made of wool-synthetic blend yarns, without pleats, cuffs (turn-ups), sleeve buttons or patch pockets; jackets were shorter, trousers were narrower, and double-breasted suits were made without vests (waistcoats).Wilcox, R. Turner: The Mode in Fashion, 1942; rev. 1958, p. 328‚Äì36 Men who were not in uniform could, of course, continue to wear pre-war suits they already owned, and many did so.

The aim of the pipeline is to bypass Turkish straits in the transportation of Russian and Caspian oil to Central Europe. In Trieste the pipeline will be connected with the Transalpine Pipeline, running to Austria and Germany. History The project was originally proposed in 2002. Signing of the memorandum of understanding on the construction of the pipeline was several times delayed until on 3 April 2007 it was signed by officials of Croatia, Italy, Romania, Serbia, and Slovenia during an energy forum in Zagreb. On 22 April 2008 Romanian, Serbian and Croatian companies signed an agreement establishing the Pan-European Oil Pipeline Project Development Company (PEOP PDC). On 10 July 2008 Shareholders adopted the Statute and appointing the Managing Board of the PEOP PDC Plc. The national governments of Romania, Serbia and Croatia are favorable about the project. Most engaged is the President of Romania, Traian BƒÉsescu, who has cited a study estimating the benefits of the project for Romania over 20 years of operation in the range between US$2.27 to 4.39 billion. The Government of Serbia is also politically motivated so as to decrease its dependence on crude oil supply from Croatia. In 2006, the Government of Slovenia did not support the project because the long stretch would pass the environmentally sensitive Karst terrain and no national interest exists regarding oil supply. Nevertheless, Slovenian representatives in 2009 expressed support for the project. On January 15, 2010, JANAF decided to freeze its involvement in PEOP. The Romanian and Serbian companies responded by saying they would still build the pipeline from the Black Sea to the Panƒçevo refinery. Technical description The long pipeline is expected to cost about ‚Ç¨3.5 billion. The capacity of the pipeline will be . It is planned to be operational by 2012. Project company The pipeline project is developed by the London-registered Pan-European Oil Pipeline Project Development Company, comprising Romanian companies Conpet Ploie»ôti and Oil Terminal Constan»õa, Serbian company Transnafta and Croatian company JANAF.

A green buffer exists between Headstone and North Harrow that consists of a moated manor site (Headstone Manor) and football and rugby pitches, making the area mostly separate from North Harrow. However, there are some points of flux and overlap. To the west the area abuts the large and predominantly agricultural pasture of Pinner Park. History Headstone Manor is fourteenth century with many later additions and renovations: it is a significant place of interest in its own right. The manor had an unrivalled status, see manorialism until after the Reformation and formation of the British Empire and to an extent, usually for such a site, relatively close to London, even until the Enlightenment which sparked the Industrial Revolution. This has led to the barns having remained largely intact to the present. Headstone Manor ‚Äì older, scheduled ancient monument listing in respect of its moated site. Two barns also have listed status ‚Äì as has the building listed at Grade I ‚Äì The origin of the place name may be related to that of Wealdstone, which is a neighbouring area situated directly north of Harrow being the residential part north of its midpoint train station, Harrow & Wealdstone ‚Äì this area acts as a second tier commercial hub for the area, the main hub being the Harrow shopping precincts and centres closer to Harrow-on-the-Hill station just south of Harrow & Wealdstone. Housing There is a large LCC cottage estate built on south of the Uxbridge road housing 5,000 people. Headstone South is predominantly made up of 1930s semi-detached housing.https://www2.harrow.gov.uk/documents/s152635/Ward%20boundary%20-%20Appendix%20B.pdf Amenities St George's Church, Headstone Harrow Weald Common adjoins the northern border of the area, open for walking and mountain biking equally, this is on the northern boundary of Harrow Weald (marked by Uxbridge Road). On this common which rises steeply in the north to climb the hill of Weald Wood, towards the southwestern, Headstone, side is the Bannister Sports Centre, an athletics track and training ground. Pinner Park features a miniature railway and a cricket ground with pavilion. St George's Anglican parish church, serving the area, was built by John Samuel Alder and consecrated in 1911. Transport The area benefits from frequent bus services towards the more commercialised Harrow, to Hatch End very close to the north, to Pinner south- westwards and Stanmore, north-eastwards. Headstone Lane railway station has three trains per hour in both directions. The station is on the line between Watford Junction and London Euston, providing a fast but stopping service to these destinations and a therefore less convenient service without changing once for destinations of Aylesbury and Milton Keynes; it marks the heart of the neighbourhood, parts of which around the manor recreation grounds merge seamlessly with the area to the south, North Harrow.

It is best known for its role in scuttling the campaign of Gary Hart for President of the United States. History An Broward motor yacht, Monkey Business was custom built for the Turnberry Isle Resort. The hull was made from aluminum; cabins had rosewood paneling and amenities included a hot tub and full bar. Guests hosted aboard included Elton John, Elizabeth Taylor, Jack Nicholson, and Julio Iglesias. Gary Hart incident In March 1987, at which time it was owned by developers Donald Soffer and Eddie Lewis, the yacht was rented by William C. Broadhurst, a Louisiana lawyer and lobbyist. Together with former US senator Gary Hart, Broadhurst sailed it to Bimini for an overnight trip with two women, one of whom was Donna Rice. After Hart became a candidate for the Democratic nomination in the 1988 election for President of the United States, the issue of whether he was having an affair with Rice was raised in the press. As rumors began circulating about the supposed extramarital affairs, Hart challenged the media. He told The New York Times in an interview published on May 3, 1987, \\"They should follow me around... They‚Äôll be very bored.\\" As the NBC anchor John Chancellor explained a few days later, \\"We did. We weren‚Äôt.\\" On May 8, 1987, five days after issuing his challenge, the Colorado senator withdrew as a candidate after the cruise on Monkey Business became known. On Sunday, May 3, the Miami Herald published a major story with the headline Miami Woman Is Linked to Hart. A few weeks later a picture appeared in the National Enquirer, and then in hundreds of newspapers worldwide, showing Donna Rice sitting in Hart‚Äôs lap, with Hart in a Monkey Business T-shirt. In 2018, Democratic media consultant Raymond Strother made public a conversation he had with Republican operative Lee Atwater in the final weeks of Atwater's life in which he told Strothers that the photograph of Hart and Rice had been arranged by Atwater to discredit Hart. The yacht made an appearance early in the film Smokey and the Bandit Part 3. The yacht returned to popular culture in the film The Front Runner, a 2018 American biographical drama directed by Jason Reitman and starring Hugh Jackman as Gary Hart.

The employee accepted and Sablosky claimed that within ten days his stomach problems were cured. Sablosky then went into the fur and hide business, dealing in, among other things, possum pelts.

It was established in 1971 with a new organizational structure as the main responsible administration for the entire telecommunication affairs. TCI maintains 30 provincial subsidiaries and two brands - MCI (Hamrahe Avval or Mobile Company of Iran) and FCI (Ashenaye Avval or Fixed-line Company of Iran) that provide fixed-line telephone service, data services, mobile services, high-speed internet and soon wireless services. About 99% of the fixed-line telephone subscribers and 61% of the mobile subscribers in Iran belong to TCI's affiliates. By 2008 TCI employed 38,000 permanent employees‚Äî13,500 of which are slated to retire during the next three years‚Äîand about 45,000 temporary employees through private subcontractors, which will no longer be used after privatization (March 2009).http://www.iran- daily.com/1387/3317/html/economy.htm Major business indicators of TCI by May 2015 are: * Fixed-line subscribers: 29.4 million * Fixed-line penetration rate: 38 percent * Mobile subscribers: 63 million * Mobile penetration rate: 80.5 percent * Internet users: 41 million * Telecom service connected villages: 53 thousand * Mobile communication covered roads: 72 thousand Kilometers * Mobile communication covered villages: 45 thousand On 2016 the Director of TCI announced the merger of its provincial subsidiaries and the MCI into a single business unit that allow to utilize the powerful synergies and maintain leading positions on the national telecoms market. TCI has utilized equipment and services such as digital switching centers, optical fiber cables, mobile phones, data networks, satellite services, and telephone special services. TCI manufactures more than 80% of the required equipment inside Iran. Iran Telecommunication Industries (ITI) was also founded in the same year to manufacture the required equipment for the national long-distance network. TCI has monopoly over Iran's fixed line infrastructure, and it was until 2010, Iran's largest cellular operator (MCI) and Internet service provider and data communication operator (DCI). As of November 2010, MCI accounts for more than 70% of TCI's profit. TCI is exporting technical and engineering services, as well as consulting and contracting services. It is also responsible for censoring most of the internet in Iran, as serves as a bottleneck for the monitoring of all communications. Privatization and IPO Privatization Organization has forecast that shares of Telecommunication Company of Iran (TCI) will be floated in the stock market by late September 2007. In March 2007, TCI and its provincial affiliated companies received the government's permission to be privatized. TCI's Infrastructure Telecom Company will be detached from it and would continue its activities as a part of the ICT Ministry. Close to 33 companies in the telecom sector are expected to be privatized. In September 2007, the Ministry of ICT announced that 51% of TCI would be privatized before the end of the Iranian calendar year on 20 March 2008. As a forerunner to the sale of a controlling stake in TCI, a 5% stake in the operator was scheduled be floated on the Tehran Stock Exchange before the end of December 2007. The flotation of this minority stake did not take place as planned, and in January 2008 it was reported that TCI would first have to be established as a fully licensed telecoms service provider. In April 2008, TCI Chairman Saber Feizi said that the various affiliated companies were interconnected in such a way as to make it impossible to separate them when the company is eventually offered for sale on the stock exchange. Feizi, therefore, stressed that TCI would be sold along with all its subsidiaries, including mobile business unit Mobile Communications Company of Iran (MCI). End of September 2009, Mobin Trust Consortium along with Tose'e Etemad Investment Company and Sina Bank won the tender for TCI (50% + one share) for $7.8 billion. Among its major investors were IRGC Co-op Foundation, Mostazafan Foundation, and Execution of Imam's Order company. The Government Ministry retained the remaining 40%, TCI employees held 5% and the last 5% shares worth of 344 billion Rials were sold on the Tehran Stock Exchange in just 8 minutes. In November 2009, the consortium paid 1564 billion tomans for the 50 percent of the shares in the Telecommunication Company priced over 7000 billion tomans with rest of the amount to be paid within next eight years. This was the biggest acquisition in the history of Iran's stock market. In October 2018, an IRGC unit in charge of the body's economic operations announced in a statement it has left Iran's telecommunications industry, after selling its share in a consortium controlling Iran's top telecoms companies and biggest mobile phone operator. ‚ÄúIn line with guidelines of the chief of staff of armed forces, the IRGC‚Äôs Cooperative Foundation sold its share and left Tose‚Äôe Etemad Mobin,‚Äù statement said, as quoted by Sepah News. Reports say it followed after both Supreme Leader Ali Khamenehi and President Hassan Rohani called for the withdrawal of the military from the Iranian economy by selling off their ownership of businesses.

The realms of Denmark, Norway and Sweden (Sweden is an 11th or 12th century merger of the former countries G√∂taland and Svealand) established their own Archdioceses, responsible directly to the Pope, in 1104, 1154 and 1164, respectively. The conversion to Christianity of the Scandinavian people required more time, since it took additional efforts to establish a network of churches. The Sami remained unconverted until the 18th century.Kenneth Scott Latourette, A history of expansion of Christianity. Vol 2. The thousand years of uncertainty: AD 500‚ÄìAD 1500 (1938) pp. 106‚Äì43. Newer archaeological research suggests there were Christians in G√∂taland already during the 9th century, it is further believed Christianity came from the southwest and moved towards the north. Denmark was also the first of the Scandinavian countries which was Christianized, as Harald Bluetooth declared this around AD 975, and raised the larger of the two Jelling Stones. The oldest still-existing church built in stone, is Dalby Holy Cross Church from around AD 1040, located in Scania then a part of Denmark. Although the Scandinavians became nominally Christian, it took considerably longer for actual Christian beliefs to establish themselves among the people in some regions,Elena Melnikova, \\"How Christian Were Viking Christians?.\\" Ruthenika, Suppl. 4 (2011) pp. 90‚Äì107Sch√∂n 2004, 170 while the people were Christianized before the king in other regions. The old indigenous traditions that had provided security and structure were challenged by ideas that were unfamiliar, such as original sin, the Incarnation, and the Trinity. Archaeological excavations of burial sites on the island of Lov√∂n near modern-day Stockholm have shown that the actual Christianization of the people was very slow and took at least 150 to 200 years,Sch√∂n 2004, 172 and this was a very central location in the Swedish kingdom. Thirteenth-century runic inscriptions from the merchant town of Bergen in Norway show little Christian influence, and one of them appeals to a Valkyrie.Sch√∂n 2004, 173 During the Early Middle Ages the papacy had not yet manifested itself as the central Roman Catholic authority, so that regional variants of Christianity could develop.Sanmark 2004: 15 Since the image of a \\"victorious Christ\\" frequently appears in early Germanic art, scholars have suggested that Christian missionaries presented Christ \\"as figure of strength and luck\\" and that possibly the Book of Revelation, which presents Christ as victor over Satan, played a central part in the spread of Christianity among the Vikings.Sanmark 2004: 97 Mission of Hamburg-Bremen Harald Bluetooth's runestone, at Jellinge The Christian cross from the Fr√∂s√∂ Runestone, symbolizing the Christianization of J√§mtland The Holy Cross Church in Dalby The Viking Age image stone S√∂vestad 1 from Sk√•ne depicts a man carrying a cross. Recorded missionary efforts in Denmark started with Willibrord, Apostle to the Frisians, who preached in Schleswig, which at the time was part of Denmark.Latourette, A history of expansion of Christianity. Vol 2. The thousand years of uncertainty: AD 500‚ÄìAD 1500 (1938) pp. 81‚Äì87. He went north from Frisia sometime between 710 and 718 during the reign of King Ongendus.Hvitfeldt, Arild. Danmarks Riges Kr√∏nike Willibrord and his companions had little success: the king was respectful but had no interest in changing his beliefs. Agantyr did permit 30 young men to return to Frisia with Willibrord. Perhaps Willibrord's intent was to educate them and recruit some of them to join his efforts to bring Christianity to the Danes.\\"St Willibrord\\" Catholic Encyclopedia, 1913 A century later Ebbo, Archbishop of Reims and Willerich, later Bishop of Bremen, baptized a few persons during their 823 visit to Denmark. He returned to Denmark twice to proselytize but without any recorded success. In 826, the King of Jutland Harald Klak was forced to flee from Denmark by Horik I, Denmark's other king. Harald went to Emperor Louis I of Germany to seek help getting his lands in Jutland back. Louis I offered to make Harald Duke of Frisia if he would give up the old gods. Harald agreed, and his family and the 400 Danes with him were baptized in Ingelheim am Rhein.Robinson, Charles (1915). The Conversion of Europe. When Harald returned to Jutland, Emperor Louis and Ebbo of Rheims assigned the monk Ansgar to accompany Harald and oversee Christianity among the converts.Rimbert, \\"Anskar: The Apostle of the North, 801‚Äì865\\", trans. C.H. Robinson in Carolingian Civilization: A Reader ed. Paul Edward Dutton (Ontario, Canada: Broadview Press, 2004), chap. 10 When Harald Klak was forced from Denmark by King Horik I again, Ansgar left Denmark and focused his efforts on the Swedes. Ansgar traveled to Birka in 829 and established a small Christian community there. His most important convert was Herigar, described as a prefect of the town and a counselor to the king. In 831 the Archdiocese of Hamburg was founded and assigned responsibility for proselytizing Scandinavia.\\"Ancient See of Hamburg\\". Catholic Encyclopedia. 1913 Horik I sacked Hamburg in 845 where Ansgar had become the archbishop. The seat of the archdiocese was transferred to Bremen. In the same year there was a pagan uprising in Birka that resulted in the martyrdom of Nithard and forced the resident missionary Bishop Gautbert to flee.Rimbert, \\"Anskar: The Apostle of the North, 801‚Äì865\\", trans. C.H. Robinson in Carolingian Civilization: A Reader ed. Paul Edward Dutton (Broadview Press, 2004), chap. 17. Ansgar returned to Birka in 854 and Denmark in 860 to reestablish some of the gains of his first visits. In Denmark he won over the trust of then-King Horik II (not Horik I, who was murdered in 854 and opposed Christianity) who gave him land in Hedeby (proto-town to be replaced by Schleswig) for the first Christian chapel. A second church was founded a few years later in Ribe on Denmark's west coast. Ribe was an important trading town, and as a result, southern Denmark was made a diocese in 948 with Ribe as its seat, a part of the Archdiocese of Hamburg-Bremen under its first bishop, St. Leofdag who was murdered that year while crossing the Ribe River.\\"Danmark's √Üldste Domkirke\\" Kristelig Dagblad 25 July 2007 The supremacy of the archdiocese of Hamburg-Bremen over ecclesiastical life in the north gradually declined as the papacy, from the pontificate of Pope Gregory VII onwards, involved itself more with the North directly.Sanmark 2004: 107 A significant step in this direction was the foundation of an archbishopric for the whole of Scandinavia at Lund in 1103‚Äì04. Both the accounts of Willibrod and of Harald are semi-mythical, and integrate mythical and legendary themes from the Nordic pagan tradition into their Christian stories. A syncretized variant of the story of Harald, that has him battling Ragnar Lodbrok to establish Christianity in Denmark, appears in Book Nine of Saxo Grammaticus' Gesta Danorum. Ebbo is the name of a mythical Nordic figure, Ibor, also known as Egil or Orvandil, who is an archer, elf, and smith who turns against the Aesir gods and wages war upon them, and the story of Ebbo of Rheims integrates themes of the divine Ebbo's story, including peasant (non-Aesir) birth and migration. Harald's usurpation and his efforts at Christianization are related to several stories of \\"usurpation\\" and \\"changes in sacrifices\\", including the usurpation of Mithothyn and the introduction of the worship of Frey at Uppsala, in that they utilize similar motifs and mythical figures. Scandinavian countries Denmark The spread of Christianity in Denmark occurred intermittently. Danes encountered Christians when they participated in Viking raids from the 9th century to the 1060s. Danes were still tribal in the sense that local chiefs determined attitudes towards Christianity and Christians for their clan and kinsmen. Bringing Christian slaves or future wives back from a Viking raid brought large numbers of ordinary Danes into close contact with Christians for perhaps the first time. As the chiefs and kings of Denmark became involved in the politics of Normandy, England, Ireland, France, and Germany, they adopted a kinder attitude toward their Christian subjects. In some cases the conversion of the chief or king appears to be purely political to assure an alliance or prevent powerful Christian neighbours from attacking. There were instances when the conversion of a powerful chief (Danish: jarl) or one of the kings was followed by wholesale conversions among their followers. In a few instances conversion was brought about by trial by ordeal miracles wrought by saintly Christians in the presence of the king or other great men of the time. Christian missionaries recognized early on that the Danes did not worship stone or wooden idols as the north Germans or some Swedes did. They could not simply destroy an image to prove that Christ was a superior god. The great religious sites at Viborg, Lejre, Lund, and Odense were also the location of Denmark's great assembly places (Danish: landsting). Religious sites in Denmark were often located at sacred springs, magnificent beech groves, or isolated hilltops. Missionaries simply asked to build chapels in those places. Over time the religious significance of the place transferred itself to the chapel. Even after becoming Christian, Danes blended the two belief systems together. Families who lived close to the earth did not want to offend the local spirits (Danish: landv√¶tter), so offerings were left just as they had been in pre-Christian times. Sacred springs (Danish: kilder) were simply consecrated to one of the local saints associated with the spring and life went on much as it had before. Christian missionaries were able to help the process along by locating churches on or near sacred places, in some cases actually using wood from the sacred groves for church construction. Thor's hammer sign was easily absorbed by the cross. Denmark has several saints, canonized by local bishops as was the custom in early Scandinavia or revered by locals as saints. Often these saints derive their veneration from deeds associated with the Christianization of Denmark. Viborg has St Kjeld, Aarhus has St Niels (also called St Nickolas), Odense has St Canute (Danish: Sanct Knud). Others include Canute Lavard, Ansgar, St Th√∏ger of Vendsyssel, St Wilhelm, St Leofdag of Ribe, and others gave their lives and efforts to the task of making the Danes Christian. King Gorm the Old (Danish: den Gamle), who was known in his lifetime as Gorm the Sleepy, was the first king of all of Denmark. Until his day, Danish kings were presumably local kings without influence over all the Danes. Denmark consisted of Jutland and Schleswig and Holstein all the way down to the Eider River, the main islands of Zealand, Funen, Langeland, the nearby lesser islands, and Sk√•neland. Gorm was said to be \\"hard and heathen\\", but Queen Thyra's influence permitted Christians to live more or less without trouble. Gorm and Queen Thyra's son, King Harald Bluetooth, boasted on one of the stones at Jelling that he had \\"made the Danes Christian\\". Harald Bluetooth is also mentioned in the inscription on the Curmsun Disc, dated AD 960s‚Äì980s. On the reverse of the disc there is an octagonal ridge, which runs around the edge of the object. In the center of the octagonal ridge there is a Latin cross which may indicate that Harald Bluetooth was Christian. The first Danish king to convert to Christianity was Harald Klak, who had himself baptised during his exile in order to receive the support of Louis the Pious.Sanmark 2004: 81 Rimbert reports that he set out to return home, accompanied by missionaries;Rimbert, The Life of Anskar (extract) however, Sanmark regards it as \\"unlikely\\" that he actually returned home and thus considers his impact on the conversion of Denmark as \\"probably minor.\\" Christianity only gained a strong hold in Denmark following the baptism of Harald Bluetooth. Initially, Harald had remained pagan, although he had allowed public preaching by Christian missionaries as early as 935. Around 960, Bluetooth converted to Christianity, reportedly when the Frisian monk Poppo held a fire-heated lump of iron in his hand without injury. Harald's daughter, Gunhilde, and his son, Sweyn Forkbeard were baptized, too. There was also a political reason for conversion. German histories record Harald being baptized in the presence of Emperor Otto I, Sweyn Forkbeard's godfather. One consequence of his conversion is that Danish kings abandoned the old royal enclosure at Jelling and moved their residence to Roskilde on the island of Zealand. Sweyn rebelled against his father, who spent an inordinate amount of time and money raising a great stone at Jelling to commemorate his accomplishments. One day King Harald asked a traveller if he had ever seen human beings move such a heavy load. \\"I have seen Sweyn drag all of Denmark away from you, sir. Judge for yourself which of you bears the heavier weight.\\"Hvitfeldt, Arild. Danmarks riges Kr√∏nike Harald left the stone lying in the path, realizing at last that Sweyn had nearly succeeded in stealing the whole kingdom. Several battles brought the rebellion to stalemate, but in 985 Harald was mortally wounded by an arrow. Later his remains were buried in the little timber church at Roskilde, then Denmark's capital. His remains are supposed to be walled up in one of the pillars of Roskilde Cathedral. Sweyn Forkbeard tried to wrest control of the church in Denmark away from the Holy Roman Empire and as a result was slandered by German historians of his day. He has been accused of relapsing from his Christian beliefs and persecuting Christians in England. In fact Sweyn gave land to the large cathedral at Lund to pay for the maintenance of the chapter. His army destroyed Christian churches in England as part of his invasion following the St. Brice's Day massacre of Danes organized by Aethelred. But when Sweyn became King of England and of Denmark, politics required that he show a kinder face toward the church which had opposed him. Another Christianizing influence was the mass emigration of Danes to England and Normandy in the Viking years. Thousands of Danes settled in east central England and in northern France displacing or intermarrying with the locals who were Christian. Once part of a Danish clan became Christian, it often meant that the rest of the family's view toward Christianity softened. By the early 11th century, certainly during the reign of Canute IV, Denmark can be said to be a Christian country. Later known as St. Canute, Canute IV was murdered inside St. Albans Church in 1086 after nobles and peasants alike rebelled at his enforcing the tithe to pay for the new monasteries and other ecclesiastical foundations which were introduced into Denmark for the first time during his reign. Both the institutions and the tax were considered foreign influences, and Canute's refusal to use the regional assemblies as was customary to establish new laws, resulted in his death and that of his brother, Prince Benedict, and seventeen other housecarls. In many ways the canonization of St. Canute in 1188 marks the triumph of Christianity in Denmark. When St. Canute's remains were moved into Odense Cathedral, the entire nation humbled itself with a three-day fast. Although he was not the first Dane to be made a saint, it was the first time for a king, the symbol of a more or less united Denmark, was recognized as an example worthy of veneration by the faithful. From that time until 1536 when Denmark became a Lutheran country under the King (or Queen) of Denmark as the titular head of the Danish National Church, (Danish: Folkekirke) the struggle between the power of the king and nobles and the church would define much of the course of Danish history. Norway Haakon Jarl was given missionaries by the king of Denmark, but before departure, Haakon sent the missionaries back. The first recorded attempts at spreading Christianity in Norway were made by King Haakon the Good in the tenth century, who was raised in England. His efforts were unpopular and were met with little success. The subsequent King Harald Greyhide, also a Christian, was known for destroying pagan temples but not for efforts to popularize Christianity. He was followed by the staunchly pagan Haakon Sigurdsson Jarl, who led a revival of paganism with the rebuilding of temples. When Harold I of Denmark attempted to force Christianity upon him around 975, Haakon broke his allegiance to Denmark. A Danish invasion force was defeated at the battle of Hj√∂rungav√°gr in 986. In 995 Olaf Tryggvason became King Olaf I of Norway. Olaf had raided various European cities and fought in several wars. In 986, however, he (supposedly) met a Christian seer on the Isles of Scilly. As the seer foretold, Olaf was attacked by a group of mutineers upon returning to his ships. As soon as he had recovered from his wounds, he let himself be baptized. He then stopped raiding Christian cities and lived in England and Ireland. In 995 he used an opportunity to return to Norway. When he arrived, Haakon Jarl was already facing a revolt, and Olaf Tryggvason could convince the rebels to accept him as their king. Haakon Jarl was later betrayed and killed by his own slave, while he was hiding from the rebels in a pig sty. Olaf I then made it his priority to convert the country to Christianity using all means at his disposal. By destroying temples and torturing and killing pagan resisters he succeeded in making every part of Norway at least nominally Christian. Expanding his efforts to the Norse settlements in the west the kings' sagas credit him with Christianizing the Faroes, Orkney, Shetland, Iceland, and Greenland. After Olaf's defeat at the Battle of Svolder in 1000 there was a partial relapse to paganism in Norway under the rule of the Jarls of Lade. In the following reign of Saint Olaf, pagan remnants were stamped out and Christianity entrenched. Nicholas Breakspear, later Pope Adrian IV, visited Norway from 1152 to 1154. During his visit, he set out a church structure for Norway. The Papal bull confirming the establishment of a Norwegian archdiocese at Nidaros is dated November 30, 1154.Kaufhold 2001: 116 Sweden Ansgar made an unsuccessful attempt as early as in the 830s. The first known attempts to Christianize Sweden were made by Ansgar in 830, invited by the Swedish king Bj√∂rn. Setting up a church at Birka he met with little Swedish interest. A century later Unni, archbishop of Hamburg, made another unsuccessful attempt. In the 10th century English missionaries made inroads in V√§sterg√∂tland. Adam of Bremen's historical treatise Gesta Hammaburgensis ecclesiae pontificum mentions a pagan Temple at Uppsala in central Sweden.Kaufhold 2001, 85 \\"The reliability of Adam's description of the cult site at Gamla Uppsala has been seriously questioned.\\"Sanmark 2004: 163 Although Uppsala's status as a pre-Christian cultic center is well documented, Adam's account could not be confirmed by archaeological findings.Kaufhold 2001, 86 The \\"presumed cult buildings which have been excavated do not resemble Adam's description of a temple 'totally covered with gold.\\"Sanmark 2004: 100 The supporters of the cult at Uppsala drew a mutual agreement of toleration with Olof Sk√∂tkonung, the first Christian king of Sweden, who ascended to the throne in the 990s. Presumably Olof Sk√∂tkonung was not in a powerful enough position to violently enforce the observance of Christianity in Uppland.Sanmark 2004: 85 Instead he established an episcopal see at Skara in V√§sterg√∂tland, near his own stronghold at Husaby around 1000. Another episcopal see was established at Sigtuna in the 1060s by King Stenkil, according to Adam of Bremen.Sanmark 2004: 109 This seat was moved to Gamla Uppsala probably some time between 1134 and 1140. This might have been because of Uppsala's importance as an old royal residence and thing site, but it may also have been inspired by a desire to show that the resistance to Christianity in Uppland had been defeated. By papal initiative an archdiocese for Sweden was established at Uppsala in 1164.Kaufhold 2001, 117 What may be one of the most violent occurrences between Christians and pagans was a conflict between Blot-Sweyn and Inge the Elder in the 1080s. This account survives in the Orkneyinga saga and in the last chapter of Hervarar saga where the saga successively moves from legendary history to historic Swedish events during the centuries before its compilation. The reigning king Inge decided to end the traditional pagan sacrifices at Uppsala which caused a public counter-reaction. Inge was forced into exile, and his brother-in-law Blot-Sweyn was elected king on condition that he allow the sacrifices to continue. After three years in exile, Inge returned secretly to Sweden in 1087, and having arrived at Old Uppsala, he surrounded the hall of Blot-Sweyn with his h√∫skarls and set the hall on fire, slaying the king as he escaped from the burning house. Hervarar saga reports that Inge completed the Christianization of the Swedes, but the Heimskringla suggests that Inge could not assume power directly, but had to dispose of yet another pagan king, Eric of Good Harvests.The epithet of this last king reflects one of the purposes of pre-Christian Germanic kingship, to promote harmony and good harvests, √°rs ok fri√∞ar. According to M. G. Larsson, the reason why the Swedish core provinces had coexistence between paganism and Christianity throughout the 11th century was because there was a general support for the transition towards the new religion.Larsson 2002, 160 However, the old pagan rites were important and central for legal processes and when someone questioned ancient practices, many newly Christianized Swedes could react strongly in support of paganism for a while. Larsson theorizes that, consequently, the vacillation between paganism and Christianity that is reported by the sagas and by Adam of Bremen was not very different from vacillations that appear in modern ideological shifts. It would have been impossible for King Inge the Elder to rule as a Christian king without strong support from his subjects, and a Norwegian invasion of V√§sterg√∂tland by Magnus Barefoot put Inge's relationship with his subjects to the test: he appears to have mustered most of the Swedish leidang, 3,600 men, and he ousted the Norwegian occupation force.Larsson 2002, 161 Although Sweden was officially Christianized by the 12th century, the Norwegian king Sigurd the Crusader undertook a crusade against Sm√•land, the south-eastern part of the Swedish kingdom, in the early 12th century, and officially it was in order to convert the locals. Gotland The Gutalagen (a Gotlandic law book from the 1220s) officially in use until 1595 but in practice until 1645, stated that performing bl√≥ts was punishable by a fine. J√§mtland On the northernmost runestone of the world standing on the island Fr√∂s√∂n in central J√§mtland, the Fr√∂s√∂ Runestone, it is said that a man called Austma√∞r Christianized the region, probably in the period 1030‚Äì1050 when the runestone was raised. Little is known of Austma√∞r, but he is believed to have been the lawspeaker of the regional thing Jamtam√≥t.  Other Nordic countries  The Scandinavian medieval kings also ruled over provinces outside of Scandinavia. These provinces are today known as the Nordic countries. Faroe Islands Sigmundur Brestisson was the first Faroe-man to convert to the Christian faith, bringing Christianity to the Faroes at the decree of Olaf Tryggvason. Initially Sigmundur sought to convert the islanders by reading the decree to the Alting in T√≥rshavn but was nearly killed by the resulting angry mob. He then changed his tactics, went with armed men to the residence of the chieftain Tr√≥ndur √≠ G√∏tu and broke in his house by night. He offered him the choice between accepting Christianity or face beheading; he chose the former. Later on, in 1005, Tr√≥ndur √≠ G√∏tu attacked Sigmundur by night at his yard in Sk√∫voy, whereupon Sigmundur fled by swimming to Sandv√≠k on Su√∞uroy. He reached land in Sigmundargj√≥gv in Sandv√≠k, but a farmer in the village killed the exhausted Sigmundur and stole his precious golden arm ring. Finland Judging by archaeological finds, Christianity gained a foothold in Finland during the 11th century. The Catholic church was strengthened with growing Swedish influence in the 12th century and the Finnish \\"crusade\\" of Birger Jarl in the 13th century. Finland was part of Sweden since then until the 19th century. Iceland Irish monks known as Papar are said to have been present in Iceland before its settlement by the Norse in the 9th century. Following King Olaf I's taking of Icelandic hostages, there was tension between the Christian and pagan factions in 10th century Iceland. Violent clashes were avoided by the decision of the Althing in 1000 AD to put the arbitration between them to √ûorgeir Lj√≥svetningago√∞i, the leader of the pagan faction. He opted, after a day and a night of meditation, that the country should convert to Christianity as a whole, while pagan worship in private would continue to be tolerated.Christianity , from a site on the Icelandic parliament. Motives for conversion Some conversions appear to have taken place for political and material gain, as well as spiritual reasons. For instance, some may have simply wanted to take the rich gifts (such as a fine, white baptismal garment) that were being handed out by Frankish nobles, who acted as the baptismal candidates' sponsors, when they were baptized. In the case of King Harald Bluetooth of Denmark, for example, he only partially converted to the new faith (at least at first) to preserve his independence from the Germans, who posed an even greater threat at the time than the Franks had been prior to this. He also saw that Christianity had much to offer to his rule. It not only helped to exalt his status, but it also provided practical help. The Missionary bishops were literate, and those who had experience of the royal government in Germany or England had the potential to be valuable advisors. There was also an economic motive to convert as pagan kings were fascinated with Christian wealth. As a result, some chose to accept the new faith as a way to gain access to this wealth. Last pagans In 1721, a new Danish colony was started in Greenland with the objective of converting the inhabitants to Christianity. Around the same time efforts were made in Norway and Sweden to convert the Sami, who had remained pagan long after the conversion of their neighbours. The Sami religion is still practiced by some. Research shows that Scandinavian countries such as Denmark and Sweden are currently among the least religious nations in the world; nevertheless, \\"many Danes and Swedes, for instance, will profess belief in 'something,' although not necessarily the God of the Bible.\\" Phil Zuckerman writes in a 2009 article to the Nordic Journal of Religion and Society, \\"Surely the historical developments of culture and religion in Denmark and Sweden are crucially informing factors in explaining the current state of irreligiosity.\\" See also * Christianization of Lithuania * Christianization of Kievan Rus' * Curmsun Disc * Germanic Christianity * Heimskringla ‚Äì A mediaeval work that relates the lives of the two Norwegian missionary kings * Northern Crusades  Notes  Further reading * Berend, Nora.

A seismic bomb differs somewhat in concept from traditional bombs, which usually explode at or near the surface, and destroy their target directly by explosive force. In contrast, a seismic bomb is dropped from high altitude to attain very high speed as it falls and upon impact, penetrates and explodes deep underground, causing massive caverns or craters known as camouflets, as well as intense shockwaves. In this way, the seismic bomb can affect targets that are too massive to be affected by a conventional bomb, as well as damage or destroy difficult targets such as bridges and viaducts. Earthquake bombs were used towards the end of World War II on massively reinforced installations, such as submarine pens with concrete walls several meters thick, caverns, tunnels, and bridges.\\"Dam Busters, Paul Brickhill. Theory and mechanism of damage During development Barnes Wallis theorised that a highly aerodynamic, very heavy bomb with a delayed detonation would cause damage to a target through shock waves travelling through the ground, hence the nickname earthquake bombs. The airmen who dropped the bombs reported that the target structures stood undamaged by the detonation; \\"But then the crater collapsed, the ground shifted and the target collapsed\\". Later computer simulations reached the same conclusions; the significant part of the damage was done by generating a cavity in the ground, and that cavity collapsing in on itself causing the ground to shift and the target's foundation to shift or break causing catastrophic structural damage to the target supported by said foundation. The shifting ground caused any larger structure to become severely damaged, even if the bomb missed the target but created a crater near it.http://www.wwiiequipment.com/index.php?option=com_content&view;=article&id;=112:12000lb- tallboy- bomb&catid;=43:bombs&Itemid;=60https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7F16gb5h1sQ They were not true seismic weapons, but effective cratering weapons. Development An American T-12 Cloudmaker seismic bomb An explosion in air does not transfer much energy into a solid, as their differing acoustic impedances makes an impedance mismatch that reflects most of the energy. Due to the lack of accuracy of bombing in the face of anti-aircraft defences, air forces used area bombardment, dropping large numbers of bombs so that it would be likely that the target would be hit. Although a direct hit from a light bomb would destroy an unprotected target, it was comparatively easy to armour ground targets with many yards of concrete, and thus render critical installations such as bunkers essentially bombproof. If the bomb could be designed to explode in water, soil, or other less compressible materials, the explosive force would be transmitted more efficiently to the target. Barnes Wallis' idea was to drop a large, heavy bomb with a hard armoured tip at supersonic speed (as fast as an artillery shell) so that it penetrated the ground like a ten-ton bullet being fired straight down. It was then set to explode underground, ideally to the side of, or underneath, a hardened target. The resulting shock wave from the explosion would then produce force equivalent to that of a 3.6 magnitude earthquake, destroying any nearby structures such as dams, railways, viaducts, etc. Any concrete reinforcement of the target would probably serve to enclose the force better. Wallis also argued that, if the bomb penetrated deep enough, the explosion would not breach the surface of the ground and would thus produce a cavern (a camouflet) which would remove the structure's underground support, thus causing it to collapse.Brickhill, Paul, The Dam Busters, Evans Brothers, London, 1951 The process was graphically described as a \\"trapdoor effect\\" or \\"hangman's drop\\". Wallis foresaw that disrupting German industry would remove its ability to fight, and also understood that precision bombing was virtually impossible in the late 1930s. The technology for precision aiming was developed during World War II, and Barnes Wallis' ideas were then shown to be successful (see for example the Bielefeld raid 14 March 1945), considering the standards at the time. Wallis' first concept was for a ten-ton bomb that would explode some underground. To achieve this, the bomb would have had to be dropped from . The RAF had no aircraft at the time capable of carrying a ten-ton bomb load aloft, let alone lifting it to such a height. Wallis designed a six-engine aeroplane for the task, called the \\"Victory Bomber\\", but he was not taken seriously by the military hierarchy of the day. Wallis then took a different line in developing a means to destroy Germany's industrial structure with attacks on its supply of hydroelectric power. After he had developed the bouncing bomb and shown its possibilities, however, RAF Bomber Command were prepared to listen to his other ideas, even though they often thought them strange. The officer classes of the RAF at that time were often trained not in science or engineering, but in the classics, Roman and Greek history and language. They provided enough support to let him continue his research. Later in the war, Barnes Wallis made bombs based on the \\"earthquake bomb concept\\", such as the 6-ton Tallboy and then the 10-ton Grand Slam, although these were never dropped from more than about . Even from this relatively low altitude, the earthquake bomb had the ability to disrupt German industry while causing minimum civilian casualties. It was used to disable the V2 factory, bury the V3 guns, sink the battleship Tirpitz and damage the U-boats' protective pens at St. Nazaire, as well as to attack many other targets which had been impossible to damage before. One of the most spectacular attacks was shortly after D-Day, when the Tallboy was used to prevent German tank reinforcements from moving by train. Rather than blow up the tracks ‚Äì which would have been repaired in a day or so ‚Äì the bombs were targeted on a tunnel near Saumur which carried the line under a mountain. Twenty-five Lancasters dropped the first Tallboys on the mountain, penetrating straight through the rock, and one of them exploded in the tunnel below. As a result, the entire rail line remained unusable until the end of the war. The Bielefeld viaduct was only closed for brief periods by 54 raids dropping 3,500 tons; but in its first use on 14 March 1945 the \\"Grand Slam\\" destroyed whole sections of the viaduct. After World War II, the United States developed the T12 demolition bomb, which was designed to create an earthquake effect. Given the availability of nuclear weapons with surface detonating laydown delivery, however, there was little or no development of conventional deep penetrating bombs until the 1991 Gulf War. During the Gulf War, the need for a conventional deep penetrator became clear. In three weeks, a cooperative effort directed by the Armament Systems Division at Eglin Air Force Base in Florida developed the GBU-28 that was used successfully by F-111Fs against a deep underground complex not far from Baghdad just before the end of the war. The United States has developed a Massive Ordnance Penetrator, designed to attack very deeply buried targets without the use of nuclear weapons with the inherent huge levels of radioactive pollution and their attendant risk of retaliation in kind.Capaccio, Tony. \\"30,000-Pound Bunker Buster Bomb Now Ready\\" Bloomberg News, 14 November 2011.

He died of cancer at his home near Westport, Co. Mayo aged 69. Biography Douthwaite studied engineering at the University of Leeds but failed to complete a degree, and later economics at the University of Essex. He was a masters student at the University of the West Indies, building two homes, and then built concrete boats at a cooperative in Port Antonio, Jamaica in the early 1970s. He spent two years as government statistician in the British Caribbean colony of Montserrat before moving to Ireland (near Westport) to write and campaign about climate and energy issues and local economic development. He set up and ran a leather crafts factory, later selling the business. He was co-founder of Feasta (the Foundation for the Economics of Sustainability) an Irish based economic, social and environmental think tank. He had also been a council member of Comhar, the Irish government's national sustainability council and a Fellow of the Post Carbon Institute. In the 1994 European Parliament election he stood unsuccessfully as the Green Party candidate for the Connacht‚ÄìUlster constituency. He was a visiting lecturer at the University of Plymouth and contributed the economic content of the Master‚Äôs course in Theology and the Environment at Dalgan Park, Navan. He contributed lectures to courses at four parts of the National University of Ireland (Dublin, Maynooth, Cork and Galway) and at the universities of London (Goldsmiths and LSE), University of Edinburgh, University of Strathclyde, University of Leicester, University of Newcastle, University of Manchester, University of Uppsala, Malardalen, Stockholm (KTH) and University of Budapest. He acted as economic adviser to the Global Commons Institute (London) from 1993 to 2005 during which time GCI developed the \\"contraction and convergence\\" approach to dealing with greenhouse gas emissions which has now been backed by many countries. He then helped Feasta devise the \\"cap and share\\" framework for emissions reduction which may be adopted by the Irish government. Publications Douthwaite's first book, The Growth Illusion: How Economic Growth Enriched the Few, Impoverished the Many and Endangered the Planet was published in 1992 and was re-issued in an extended and up-dated second edition in 1999. It explores why the present economic system is dependent on economic growth and the effects that the resulting pursuit of growth has had on the environment and society. His other major book, Short Circuit (1996) gives dozens of examples of currency, banking, energy and food production systems which communities can use to make themselves less dependent on an increasingly unstable world economy. In The Ecology of Money, published in 1999, he calls for different currencies for different purposes and for changes in the way money is put into circulation so that a stable, sustainable economy can be achieved. In 2003 he edited Before the Wells Run Dry, a study of the transition to renewable energy in the light of climate change and oil and gas depletion and in 2004 To Catch the Wind, a report on how communities can invest in wind energy.

It typically comprises a streamlined envelope with stabilising features and a harness or yoke connecting it to the main tether. Kite balloons are able to fly in higher winds than ordinary round balloons. They were extensively used for naval and military observation during World War I, and for anti-aircraft deployments as barrage balloons in World War II. Development and construction Developed in Germany from 1893 by Parseval and Sigsfeld, the main component of a kite balloon is its aerodynamically streamlined envelope, similar to that of a non-rigid airship. Unlike most airships, the envelope is also the main lifting gas bag. Types such as the German Parseval Drachen and French Caquot used wind pressure to inflate one or more stabilising ballonets at the rear, which acted as tail fins. A yoke or harness connected the balloon to the tether and was arranged to aid stability.Ege (1973).Vivian, Evelyn Charles; A History of Aeronautics, Collins 1921, Part III, Chapter VII, \\"Kite Balloons\\". Naval use During the Atlantic U-boat campaign of World War I, kite balloons would be deployed by a destroyer escorting a convoy of merchant ships. A basket suspended below the kite balloon held a pilot who watched for U-boats and notified the destroyer of his observations by telephone via the insulated core of the kite balloon tether cable. The elevated balloon pilot had a clearer view of a submerged U-boat than was available from shipboard locations; and the kite balloon pilot could notify the ship of the U-boat's evasive maneuvers during a depth charge attack. Effectiveness The availability of an elevated visual observation platform significantly enhanced the success of destroyers in finding and attacking U-boats prior to the invention of sonar. Convoys might have been better protected if every destroyer had been equipped with a kite balloon; but there was a limited number of balloons, and even fewer pilots qualified to fly in them. The United States Navy established an emergency balloon pilot training program in October, 1917, at Goodyear Tire and Rubber Company's Wingfoot Field in Akron, Ohio. The kite balloon pilot had a parachute in a flat container attached to the observation basket suspended from the kite balloon, with the pilot only wearing a simple body harness around his waist, with shroud lines from the harness attached to the main parachute in the container. When the balloonist jumped, the main part of the parachute was pulled from the container, with the shroud lines first, followed by the main canopy. A similar parachute system for the entire observation basket was tested at Rockaway Naval Air Station, but it was not widely used. Operation Each destroyer would secure the tether of an inflated kite balloon from the air station dock just prior to leaving port. While the destroyer escorted a convoy, the pilot would board the kite balloon basket each morning just before daylight. The pilot would clip the boarding line to his parachute harness so four seamen could hoist him into the balloon by pulling the opposite end of the line through a pulley on the kite balloon. They tried to make the hoist during a calm period, but it was not unusual for the pilot to be dunked into the Atlantic before reaching his observation basket. The kite balloon might behave erratically in the turbulence abaft the destroyer, so the whole observation basket might also be dunked before the tether was extended allowing the kite balloon to go aloft. Wet or dry, the balloon pilot spent the whole day aloft in the kite balloon whose appearance and airborne movement earned it the nickname: rubber cow. Returning from the kite balloon to the ship at the end of a long day was a reverse of the boarding procedure with the added risks of darkness and weariness. The only United States naval kite balloon pilot casualty was an unsuccessful attempted return to a destroyer escorting an eastbound convoy through the Irish Sea on the stormy evening of 14 August 1918. The rubber cow began alternately plunging port and starboard as the tether was shortened, dipping the pilot's basket into the water on each dive; and the basket was empty when the kite balloon stabilized on a short tether.

Open canopy forests combine several types of pine and dense groundcovers that include gallberry, saw palmetto, wild blueberry, wax myrtle and wiregrass. Atlantic white cedars line the river, and one of these was designated a Florida Champion in 1982, the largest of its species. Wildlife found nearby include white-tailed deer, turkeys and bobcats. River otters are occasionally seen but alligators are not seen in the river due to is cool temperatures and sandy bottom. A variety of birds, including red- headed and pileated woodpeckers, hawks, crows, warblers and Mississippi kites frequent the river area. Shorebirds such as plovers and sandpipers, as well as many types of heron and egret, can be found along the banks and sandbars. The river has spawned many oxbow lakes, some of which can be seen from the river. Two hurricanes in 1995, Erin and Opal, changed the course of the river downstream from Deaton Bridge in Blackwater River State Park. The section of the river between Deaton Bridge and Milton, Florida is no longer navigable by boat. The navigable section of the river begins at Kennedy Bridge on State Forestry Road 24 (Kennedy Bridge Road) east of Munson, Florida. The next access point is 6 miles downstream at Peaden Bridge on State Forestry Road 50 (Peaden Bridge Road). Five more miles downstream, between Munson and Baker, Florida, is Cotton Bridge on State Road 4. Twelve more miles downstream is Bryant Bridge, on State Forestry Road 21 (Bryant Bridge Road) near Holt, Florida. The final access point, and the end of the Florida Canoe Trail, is eight more miles downstream at Deaton Bridge on State Forestry Road 23 in Blackwater River State Park.

The main aim of the group was to highlight concerns about rising levels of homelessness and to house the hundreds of hippies sleeping in parks and derelict buildings in central London. The commune famously squatted a mansion at 144 Piccadilly on Hyde Park Corner which became a media sensation. The group was quickly evicted in a high-profile Metropolitan Police operation and other squatting attempts were also rebuffed. One of the leaders of the commune who often spoke to the media was known as 'Dr. John.' He was actually Phil Cohen, who later became an urban ethnographer and emeritus professor at the University of East London. Hippydilly Occupation Around 200 hippy squatters occupied 144 Piccadilly in September 1969. The building was a mansion built by Sir Drummond Smith in the late 1790s, which had been lived in by Lord Palmerston when he became Prime Minister in 1855. It was surrounded by a dry moat so they built a makeshift drawbridge to control the entrance. The place quickly became known as Hippydilly. Intensive media coverage made the occupation a sensation and the numbers of people on the street outside never dropped below 500. Up until the eviction, most police activity was dedicated to controlling the violent right-wing elements in the crowd who wanted to attack the squat. In one incident, five motorbikes were set on fire. An eighteen year old squatter welcomed in the press and made ¬£300 in five days giving supposedly exclusive interviews to the mainstream newspapers about fictional orgies and drugs binges. Despite its short lifespan, the squat attracted many visitors. The Commune had planned to occupy the building peacefully and argue their need for housing in court, but the attacks from police and skinheads meant that things began to go out of control. The Commune invited Hells Angels to act as security and they began to take over the building. Eviction After six days, the eviction came swiftly on 21 September 1969. Commanding police officer Chief Inspector Michael Rowling told the occupants that a woman was giving birth and needed assistance, so they lowered the drawbridge and then 200 police swarmed in. The operation took just three minutes to clear the building. Almost 100 people were arrested during the eviction, most were immediately released again the same day. Aftermath The next day, mainstream the press reported as follows: Daily Mirror - Fall of Hippy Castle; The Times - Squatters ousted by police commando; Daily Telegraph - Police rout Piccadilly Hippies. The police had performed an illegal eviction since they had no possession order. Property developer Ronald Lyon was so impressed with the police action that he went to West End Central police station and donated ¬£1000. The building stood empty for three years and then was demolished despite its listed status. It is now the site of the InterContinental London Park Lane hotel. Other actions After Hippydilly, the London Street Commune moved to a previously squatted school at Endell Street in Covent Garden. This was evicted after a few days in another large police operation. There were 63 arrests and one month later 32 people were still being held at Ashford Remand Centre. Of these, eight were singled out as ringleaders and charged under the Forcible Entry Act 1429. After a trial at Lewes Crown Court, all eight were found guilty, but the punishments varied. Two people were jailed for nine months, two sent to detention centres, three were given suspended sentences and one was fined ¬£20. An office building in Russell Square in Bloomsbury was then occupied and quickly evicted.

The species is sometimes classified as a subspecies of the vervet monkey (C. pygerythrus), or of the widespread grivet (C. aethiops). Physical characteristics The malbrouck is a slim, agile primate with long limbs and a long tail. The fur is olive-grey. The breast and underparts are white, as well as the cheeks and eyebrows, which surround the bald, pale-blotched face. The eyes are brown. The genitals are brightly colored; the scrotum of the male is blue, the penis is red. Males are about 20% larger than females. Distribution and habitat The malbrouck is found in central and south-central Africa, ranging from the Albertine Rift in DR Congo west to the Atlantic coast and south to northern Namibia and Zambia west of the Luangwa River. It lives in marshy forest, savanna-forest and montane forest up to an altitude of 4,500 m (14,750 ft). Photo and information about the Malbrouck. Natuurinformatie, Naturalis. Accessed 2008-07-10. Behaviour The malbrouck is a diurnal animal living in large groups, consisting of six to more than 50 animals. The number of males and females is usually about the same. Each group has its own territory, the size of which depends on the amount of available food. The malbrouck uses a wide range of sounds and gestures to communicate with other members of a group.  Diet  The diet of this omnivorous species consists of fruit, seeds, flowers, gum, invertebrates, eggs, chicks and lizards. Vegetable food forms the largest part of the diet in most areas.

The harbour had its own authority. Background and History Originally a small fishing village outside Dartmouth, Nova Scotia along the 207 Hwy. The next community past Lawrencetown Beach, Three Fathom Harbour consists of several islands. One is connected to the mainland by a causeway (originally wooden) and was the main fishing community now referred to as the Fisherman's Reserve. Acadian fishermen from Chezzetcook and Grand Desert would spend their summers there in small fishing huts, working on their boats and would return to their family homes in the winter. Later, summer cottages started to spring up along with family homes. The main island was always residential with farms. It was a man made island with Rocky Run with waters leaving Porter's Lake at the western end, Porter's Lake at the north, and the Harbour at the south. The west end had a man made canal separating it from the main land. Originally, Seaforth was part of Three Fathom Harbour. The Canal and Rocky Run were entry points for salt water to run into Porter's Lake. The Canal end at the south of Porters Lake was a popular cottage area. The Three Fathom Harbour Road, was originally the main road, with a side road to Lower Three Fathom Harbour. The original Three Fathom Harbour school was on the west end of the \\"cove\\" along Three Fathom Harbour Road. Today it serves as a family home. Highway 207 was built and later paved in approximately 1960 and became the main road through the community. There are still fewer homes built along that route than on the Three Fathom Harbour Road, as the south side of the road is heavily muskeg. The north side has several short roadways to homes on Porter's Lake. The area is currently still an active fishing area. Many homes and cottages scatter the lake and ocean shores. It is now within commuting distance to Halifax/Dartmouth.

Its members came from Norway and Britain. Career The group formed in Norway in 1969. Its members were Kenny Aas (organ & bass guitar), Kjell Asperud (percussion & vocal), John Lorck (drums), Janne L√∏seth (guitar & vocal) and Roy Robinson (lead singer) and, for a time, John Williamson. Janne L√∏seth was the band's primary songwriter and Roy Robinson its main lyricist. In October 1971, Titanic reached Number 5 in the UK Singles Chart, with their instrumental track, \\"Sultana\\" in the style of Santana. The band relocated to the south of France and released Macumba in 1974 with Helge Groslie on keyboards. It reached number one in Spain. Sliding Down Again was released in 1974 and Buckshee Woman the following year. The band dissolved in 1979. Janne L√∏seth started a solo career, releasing singles including \\"Take Me Down\\" (bw. \\"Nobody's Man\\"), and \\"I Wished I Was a Poet\\" (bw. \\"Dancing Girl\\"), which featured his operatic vocal, and then became the lead singer for the French electronic band Space, best known for its 1977 album and single Magic Fly. In 1991, L√∏seth and Robinson reformed Titanic and recorded the album Lower the Atlantic. The album was re-released as Heart of Rock in 1993. This Titanic reunion was short lived. In 2006, L√∏seth reformed Titanic with three additional members: Mick Walker, Phil Wilton, and Didier Blum. Roy Robinson later joined and this quintet released the single \\"I'm the Law\\" in the same year. Their album Ashes and Diamonds was released on 20 February 2009 in Europe. In late 2009, Robinson sustained a stroke and left the band to recover. L√∏seth assumed the lead vocals. Robinson and Walker were replaced by new members Chris Kleiner and Jean-Pierre Sjoberg. They played live concerts until 2013. During their latter days the band was located in Switzerland. In September 2014, it was announced that the band was discontinued.

It was nominated for the Grand Jury Prize at the 2000 Sundance Film Festival, then played the Toronto International Film Festival, the Seattle Film Festival, and a number of LGBT film festivals, winning a total of 6 \\"Best Film\\" awards. It was released by Lionsgate and was named \\"One of the Year's Best Films\\" in over 35 publications including the Los Angeles Times, Time Out, the Chicago Tribune, and the San Francisco Chronicle. Plot Urbania follows Charlie (Dan Futterman) through a sleepless night. After an unsuccessful bout of masturbation to the sound of his upstairs neighbors having sex, he prowls the streets looking for a man he saw several months earlier. The implication is that he's had a one night stand with the man, cheating on his boyfriend Chris (Matt Keeslar). This is reinforced by several phone calls Charlie places, leaving messages on Chris' answering machine. As he's walking, he has momentary flashes akin to hallucinations or waking dreams: a man's mouth; a bottle breaking; a man with a blood-stained shirt. After a series of encounters (with his upstairs neighbors, whom he tells about his masturbatory activities, and a potential trick), he meets the man he's looking for. His name is Dean (Samuel Ball) and it makes no sense either that he'd trick with Charlie or that Charlie would trick with him. Dean is unabashedly racist, sexist and homophobic. Nevertheless, Charlie, pretending to be straight, buys Dean drinks and smokes a joint with him. Dean takes Charlie to a gay cruising area looking for victims, but Charlie is able to warn away the intended target. Dean is now almost incapacitated by alcohol and drugs and Charlie gets him into Dean's car and drives him to a secluded marshy area. As had been implied by Charlie's flashbacks, Dean and two of his buddies, several months earlier, had attacked Charlie and raped and murdered Chris in an apparent hate crime. Charlie's purpose is finally revealed: he wants revenge. In a dreamlike conversation with Chris, Charlie relates what happened at the marshland. He pulled a knife on Dean and told him why he was there. Dean didn't remember him. Charlie forced Dean to drop his pants and was disgusted to see Dean had an erection. Charlie forced Dean to kneel and fellate the knife blade. Suddenly, Dean collapsed with an epileptic seizure. Charlie slit his throat. Chris challenges Charlie, not believing that he killed Dean. Charlie admits that he wanted to but couldn't. Instead, he drove off in Dean's car, abandoning him in the marsh. Charlie stands up from where he's been kneeling, at a makeshift memorial near where Chris was killed. He walks home and has one more hallucinatory flash. He sees himself on the street, cradling a dying Chris. He kisses Chris goodbye and passes by him. When he turns back, Chris is gone. Charlie makes it home and, finally, is able to sleep. Charlie presents aspects of his story in the form of urban legends. The film references a number of urban legends, both by having characters describe them as they're depicted and by presenting random people experiencing them. Reception Urbania has an approval rating of 72% on Rotten Tomatoes, based on 29 critic reviews. Awards and nominations * L.A.

It is similar to the Special Economic Zones set up by the People's Republic of China and elsewhere to pilot market economics in a designated controlled area. It is near the border with China and Russia and is a warm-water port for both countries.http://nkfood.wordpress.com/2014/03/27/energy-generation-in-rason/recent report from BDSec Joint Stock Company for HBOil reveals that one of the newcomers to Rason is Mongolia. While China and Russia have rented out the piers in the Rajin portion of Rason, HBOil seems more interested in Seonbong and the energy scene. Chinese and Russian companies have invested in the economic zone. Mongolia has joined recently, and the use of foreign currency is permitted.nk.chosun.com Bloomberg reported that ground was broken in June 2011 on a further development stage of the zone. In November 2011, work began on building electricity transmission lines that will provide Chinese electricity supplies in the zone. Administration The Rason Special Economic Zone is administered by the Committee of External Economic Cooperation (CEEC). Foreign companies must be invited by the CPEEC to participate in the special zone. The first joint North-South company, called Chilbosanmeri Joint Company, has been formally established in Rason Special Economic Zone. Sources conflict over the date the zone was founded, either 1991 or 1993. Since its creation, laws governing the zone's status have been amended six times, the most recent revision being approved by the Presidium of the Supreme People's Assembly on 3 December 2011.

The UNIDO estimates the investment will increase to $150 million in the future. In August 2012, an international trade fair was held, offering foreign investors and journalists a look at the work-in-progress. The zone is slated to be a manufacturing, tourism, and transportation hub. However, some analysts think the special zone is more of a project for North Korea to experiment with the capitalist economy rather than use it as basis of transforming North Korea's economy.By Scott Snyder, April 25, 2010, Rajin-Sonbong: A Strategic Choice for China in Its Relations with Pyongyang Foreign investments *Pipa Tourist Hotel *Ra-Son Economic Co-operation Company *Foreign Economic Co-operation Corporation *Korea Joint Venture Group *Samgwang Trading Company *Korea Machinery Trading Company *Korea Daesong B Trading Corporation *Opalsam Trading Company *Korea Rungra 888 Trading Corporation *Korea Ponghwa General Corporation *Pyongyang Aluminium Products Factory *Korea Osoksan Trading Company *Light Industry Products Trading Company *Korea Samtaesong General Group *Korea Pyongchon Trading Corporation *Golden Triangle Bank *Yanbian Tianyu International Trade Company History of foreign business legislation From 1993 to 2012, there was one single law titled ‚ÄòLaw of the Democratic People‚Äôs Republic of Korea on the Rason Economic and Trade Zone‚Äô, which did not mention specific details of business environment, leaving foreign investors with many questions. The first Rason SEZ Law launched in 1993 contained chapters of Fundamentals, Duties and Rights of Operation Committee, Guarantee of Economy Activities, Customs Duties, Currency and Finance, Guarantee and Preferential Treatment and Settlement of Disputes. The basic framework was continued until 2011, when it made modifications on Development and Management of the Zone, Establishment of Enterprises, Economic and Trade Activities and Incentives and Preferential Treatment, providing more details of the environment for foreign-invested companies. However it still did not cover all basically required details for foreign-invest companies such as regulations of labor, tax, or financial management. From 2014 on, NK started to acknowledge the necessity of a more complex and comprehensive legal framework. North Korea adopted more specific regulations regarding certain legal fields such as Labor Regulations for Foreign-invested Businesses and Regulations of Financial Management of Foreign-invested Businesses. Furthermore, bylaws for Taxation and Establishment and Operation of Businesses appeared. According to the latest Rason SEZ law published in 2016, there are total 16 regulations included in the collection of laws, with at least 3 additional regulations enacted. Transport Chinese investors have renovated a road from Rason to China, and Russian railway workers have renovated the railway from Rason (which is on the Pyongra Line) to Russia, from where it continues onto the Trans-Siberian Railway. There are three ports in the area: the Rajin Port (handling capacity of 3 million tons), the Sonbong Port (handling capacity of 2-3 million tons), and the Chongjin Port (handling capacity of 8 million tons). Chinese companies operate two piers at the port, for coal export and for containers. A Russian company operates a third pier.

He played college football at the University of Texas, which won the national championship in 1963. Appleton was a consensus 1963 All-American and won the Outland Trophy. Early years Appleton was born on February 20, 1942, in McCulloch County, Texas to Gordon Frederick Appleton and Alberda Methelda Leifeste. He attended Brady High School, where he was an All-state tackle. He accepted a football scholarship from the University of Texas, where he became a three-year starter and a tri- captain. He earned All-SWC honors in 1962 and 1963. As a senior, he helped Texas win its first National Championship. He was named All-American, was the school's first Outland Trophy winner and he finished fifth in the Heisman Trophy balloting. He was also a member of the Texas Cowboys. In the 1964 Cotton Bowl, he tallied 12 tackles, 2 unofficial sacks of quarterback Roger Staubach and stopped a scoring threat on fourth down with less than 10 minutes left on the game. He also contributed to the defense setting 2 records by holding Navy without a rushing first down and limiting them to minus 14 yards rushing. The 28-6 win cemented the school's first National Championship. In 1986, he was inducted into the University of Texas Athletics Hall of Honor. In 2001, he was inducted into the Southwestern Cotton Bowl Hall of Fame. Professional career In the 1964 NFL Draft, the Dallas Cowboys were looking to shore up its offense by improving at wide receiver. Head coach Tom Landry reached an agreement with the Pittsburgh Steelers to acquire Buddy Dial, who was one of the top receivers at the time in the league, in exchange for selecting Appleton with the team's first round draft choice and trading him immediately afterwards on January 1. Although the Steelers thought that Appleton would sign with them, he ended up joining the Houston Oilers of the AFL, who had also drafted him in the first round. The voice of the Steelers, Myron Cope, described the shenanigans both teams used in the attempt to sign Appleton as the \\"Buddy Dial for Nothing\\" trade and was one of his favorite stories. As a rookie in 1964, he was played at left defensive end, but could not earn a starting position, although he managed to record 2 interceptions. In 1965, he was moved to right defensive tackle. Appleton's career with the Oilers was a disappointment, playing until 1966. Like his father, who battled alcoholism (and eventually committed suicide), Scott Appleton also battled alcoholism and drug addictions. On January 12, 1967, he was traded along with linebacker Johnny Baker to the San Diego Chargers in exchange for cornerback Miller Farr. He was the Chargers' starter at right defensive tackle for 2 seasons and led the team in solo tackles in 1968. He was released on September 3, 1969. On November 6, 1969, he was signed as a free agent by the Oakland Raiders to replace an injured Dan Birdwell, but would be later cut. On July 12, 1970, he signed with the New Orleans Saints and was released on August 10. He never missed a game during his NFL career (70 games played). On June 12, 1974, he signed with the Portland Storm of the WFL. Personal life After his career in football ended, he became a manager of a Dairy Queen in Westfield, Texas (20 miles north of Houston) and worked at fast food restaurants, still battling alcoholism and participating in various rehab programs. He eventually ended up at the Fourth Street Inn, a project of the First Baptist Church and Rev. Jimmy Allen, in San Antonio, Texas, where they would feed the homeless and conduct Bible readings. Appleton quit drinking and began studying to become an ordained minister. After working at the Fourth Street Inn, he started his own ministry and spoke across the U.S. talking about his alcoholism and recovery. Suffering from heart disease, Appleton at first declined a heart transplant operation, but later was placed on the list for a donor heart. However, he died of heart failure in 1992 at age 50.

The uncle abandons the two children to stake his claim to the wealth. Their ghosts supposedly haunt the forest. In 1879, the tree that the babes had reputedly been left under was struck by lightning. The strength of the legend had grown to such an extent that people visited the area for souvenirs.

It features a mouse dentist who must help a fox with a toothache without being eaten.

National Book Foundation. Retrieved 2012-02-22.Picture books were separately recognized for only two years in National Book Awards history, during four years when there were dual hardcover and paperback awards in many categories. Doctor De Soto was also recognized as a Newbery Honor Book. At 32 pages it is one of the shortest to be honored in that awards program. Plot The story is about Dr. De Soto, a mouse dentist who lives in a world of anthropomorphic animals. He and his wife, who serves as his assistant, work together to treat patients with as little pain as possible. Dr. De Soto uses different chairs, depending on the size of the animal, or simply has the patient sit on the floor, using a stepladder or with Mrs. De Soto guiding her husband with a system of pulleys for treating extra-large animals. They refuse to treat any animal who likes to eat mice. One day, a well-dressed fox with a toothache drops by and begs for treatment. Dr. De Soto feels pity for the fox and Mrs. De Soto suggests they risk it, so they admit the fox as a patient. They give the fox some anesthetic and proceed to treat the bad tooth. However, while under anesthesia, the fox unknowingly exclaims how he loves to eat mice (including with a dry, white wine). The De Sotos remove the bad tooth, and tell the fox to come back the next day to get a false tooth. On his way home, the fox notes that it is crass to try to eat the creature that had just relieved him of much pain, but still doesn't dismiss the idea. Later that night, Dr. and Mrs. De Soto, as she prepares the new tooth of gold, debate whether to readmit the fox. Dr. De Soto feels it was foolish to trust a fox, but Mrs. De Soto says she thinks the fox was reacting to the anesthetic in his comments. In the end Dr. De Soto vows, as his father taught him, to finish the job he started, but they formulate a plan to protect themselves. The next day, the fox returns; he is much happier, out of pain, and anxiously awaits the installation of his new tooth. Dr. De Soto puts in the new tooth, but by now the fox has decided to give in to temptation and eat them. Dr. De Soto then introduces a new formula the couple created recently, and claiming that one application will prevent toothaches forever asks the fox if he'd like to be the first to try it, who, hating pain, readily agrees. The dentist takes his time and paints each tooth with the formula, then has the patient clench his jaws shut for a full minute. The fox is surprised to find that his mouth has been glued shut, as this is what the secret formula really is, but Dr. De Soto states that he \\"should have mentioned\\" that the formula needs time to permeate the dentin and as a result, the fox will not be able to open his mouth for a day or two. Stunned, the deceived patient can only reply with 'frank oo berry mush' and in a daze, leave with as much dignity as possible. The book ends with the De Sotos triumphant at having \\"outfoxed the fox\\", and they take the rest of the day off.

Copernicus is the European Union's Earth observation programme coordinated and managed by the European Commission in partnership with the European Space Agency (ESA), the EU Member States and EU Agencies. It aims at achieving a global, continuous, autonomous, high quality, wide range Earth observation capacity. Providing accurate, timely and easily accessible information to, among other things, improve the management of the environment, understand and mitigate the effects of climate change, and ensure civil security. The objective is to use vast amount of global data from satellites and from ground-based, airborne and seaborne measurement systems to produce timely and quality information, services and knowledge, and to provide autonomous and independent access to information in the domains of environment and security on a global level in order to help service providers, public authorities and other international organizations improve the quality of life for the citizens of Europe. In other words, it pulls together all the information obtained by the Copernicus environmental satellites, air and ground stations and sensors to provide a comprehensive picture of the \\"health\\" of Earth. One of the benefits of the Copernicus Programme is that the data and information produced in the framework of Copernicus are made available free- of-charge to all its users and the public, thus allowing downstream services to be developed. The services offered by Copernicus cover six main interacting themes: atmosphere, marine, land, climate, emergency and security. Copernicus builds upon three components: * The space component (observation satellites and associated ground segment with missions observing land, atmospheric and oceanographic parameters). This comprises two types of satellite missions, ESA's five families of dedicated Sentinel (space missions) and missions from other space agencies, called Contributing Missions; * In-situ measurements (ground-based and airborne data-gathering networks providing information on oceans, continental surface and atmosphere); * Services developed and managed by Copernicus and offered to its users and public in general. Its cost during 1998 to 2020 are estimated at 6.7 billion euros with around ‚Ç¨4.3bn spent in the period 2014 to 2020 and shared between the EU (66%) and ESA (33%) with benefits of the data to the EU economy estimated at roughly 30 billion euros through 2030. ESA as a main partner has performed much of the design and oversees and co-funds the development of Sentinel missions 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 and 6 with each Sentinel mission consisting of at least 2 satellites and some, such as Sentinel 1, consisting of 4 satellites. They will also provide the instruments for Meteosat Third Generation and MetOp-SG weather satellites of EUMETSAT where ESA and EUMETSAT will also coordinate the delivery of data from upwards of 30 satellites that form the contributing satellite missions to Copernicus. History The Copernicus programme was established by the Regulation (EU) No 377/2014 in 2014, building on the previous EU's Earth monitoring initiative GMES (est. by Regulation (EU) No 911/2010). Over a few decades, European and national institutions have made substantial R&D; efforts in the field of Earth observation. These efforts have resulted in tremendous achievements but the services and products developed during this period had limitations that were inherent to R&D; activities (e.g. lack of service continuity on the long-term). The idea for a global and continuous European earth observation system was developed under the name of Global Monitoring for Environment and Security (GMES) which was later re-branded into Copernicus after the EU became directly involved in financing and development. It follows and greatly expands on the work of the previous 2.3 billion euros European Envisat program which operated from 2002 to 2012. Copernicus moved from R&D; to operational services following a phased approach: * 2008 ‚Äì 2010: Copernicus pre-operational services (FTS and Pilot services) * 2011 ‚Äì 2013: Copernicus initial operations * From 2014: Copernicus fully operational services Chronology *19 May 1998: institutions involved in the development of space activities in Europe give birth to GMES through a declaration known as \\"The Baveno Manifesto\\". At that time, GMES stands for \\"Global Monitoring for Environmental Security\\". *Year 1999: the name is changed to \\"Global Monitoring for Environment and Security\\", thus illustrating that the management of the environment also has security implications. *2001: at the occasion of the Gothenburg Summit, the Heads of State and Government request that \\"the Community contribute to establishing by 2008 a European capacity for Global Monitoring for Environment and Security\\". *October 2002: the nature and scope of the \\"Security\\" component of GMES are defined as addressing prevention of and response to crises related to natural and technological risk, humanitarian aid and international cooperation, monitoring of compliance with international treaties for conflict prevention, humanitarian and rescue tasks, peacekeeping tasks and surveillance of EU borders. *February 2004: the Commission Communication \\"GMES: Establishing a GMES capacity by 2008\\" introduces an Action Plan aimed at establishing a working GMES capacity by 2008. In 2004, a Framework Agreement is also signed between EC and ESA, thus providing the basis for a space component of GMES. *May 2005: the Commission Communication \\"GMES: From Concept to Reality\\" establishes priorities for the roll-out of GMES services in 2008, the initial focus being on land monitoring, marine monitoring and emergency response services, also known as Fast Track Services (FTS). Later services, also known as Pilot Services, are expected to address atmosphere monitoring, security and climate change. *June 2006: the EC establishes the GMES Bureau, with the primary objective of ensuring the delivery of the priority services by 2008. Other objectives of the GMES Bureau are to address the issues of the GMES governance structure and the long-term financial sustainability of the system. *May 2007: adoption of the European Space Policy Communication, recognising GMES as a major flagship of the Space Policy. *September 2008: official launch of the three FTS services and two Pilot services in their pre-operational version at the occasion of the GMES Forum held in Lille, France. *November 2008: the Commission Communication \\"GMES: We care for a Safer Planet\\" establishes a basis for further discussions on the financing, operational infrastructure and effective management of GMES. *May 2009: the Commission Proposal for a Regulation on \\"the European Earth Observation Programme (GMES) and its initial operations (2011-2013)\\" proposes a legal basis for the GMES programme and EC funding of its initial operations. *November 2010: the regulation on \\"the European Earth Observation Programme (GMES) and its initial operations (2011-2013)\\" entered into force. *June 2011: the Commission presents its proposal for the next multiannual financial framework (MFF) corresponding to the period 2014-2020 (Communication ‚ÄúA Budget for Europe 2020‚Äù). In this document, the Commission proposes to foresee the funding of the GMES programme outside the multiannual financial framework after 2014. *November 2011: The Commission Communication on the \\"European Earth monitoring programme (GMES) and its operations (from 2014 onwards)\\" presents the Commission's proposals for the future funding, governance and operations of the GMES programme for the period 2014 - 2020. In particular, the Commission proposes to opt for the creation of a specific GMES fund, similar to the model chosen for the European Development Fund, with financial contributions from all Member States, based on their Gross National Income (GNI). *April 2012: The Emergency Management Service ‚Äì Mapping (\\"EMS-Mapping\\") is declared the first fully operational service within the GMES Initial Operations. *December 2012: the Commission announces the name change to Copernicus. *October 2014: ESA and European Commission have established a budget for Copernicus Programme covering years 2014-2020 within Multiannual Financial Framework. Budget provided a total of , including for ESA to cover operations of the satellite network and construction of the remaining satellites. Earth Observation missions Sentinel missions ESA is currently developing seven missions under the Sentinel programme (Sentinel 1, 2, 3, 4, 5P, 5, 6). The Sentinel missions include radar and super-spectral imaging for land, ocean and atmospheric monitoring. Each Sentinel mission is based on a constellation of two satellites to fulfill and revisit the coverage requirements for each mission, providing robust datasets for all Copernicus services. The Sentinel missions will have the following objectives: * Sentinel-1 provides all-weather, day and night radar imaging for land and ocean services. The first Sentinel-1A satellite was successfully launched on 3 April 2014, by an Arianespace Soyuz, from the Centre Spatial Guyanais. The second Sentinel-1B satellite was launched on 25 April 2016 from same spaceport with similar rocket. * Sentinel-2 provides high-resolution optical imaging for land services (e.g. imagery of vegetation, soil and water cover, inland waterways and coastal areas). Sentinel-2 will also provide information for emergency services. The first Sentinel-2 satellite, Sentinel-2A, successfully launched on 23 June 2015. The second Sentinel-2 satellite, Sentinel-2B, followed 7 March 2017. Both satellites launched aboard Vega rockets from Centre Spatial Guyanais. * Sentinel-3 provides ocean and global land monitoring services. The first Sentinel-3A satellite was launched on 16 February 2016 by a Eurockot Rokot vehicle from the Plesetsk Cosmodrome in Russia. The second Sentinel-3B satellite followed 25 April 2018, also from Plesetsk aboard a Rokot. * Sentinel-4, embarked as a payload upon a Meteosat Third Generation Satellite, will provide data for atmospheric composition monitoring. It will be launched in 2023. * Sentinel-5 Precursor was launched on 13 October 2017 by a Eurockot Rokot vehicle from the Plesetsk Cosmodrome in Russia. The primary purpose of this is to reduce the data gap (especially SCIAMACHY atmospheric observations) between the loss of ENVISAT in 2012, and the launch of Sentinel-5 in 2021. The measurements are done by the Tropomi spectroscope. * Sentinel-5 will also provide data for atmospheric composition monitoring. It will be embarked on a EUMETSAT Polar System Second Generation (EPS-SG) spacecraft and launched in 2021. * Sentinel-6 is intended to provide continuity in high precision altimetry sea level measurements following the Jason-3 satellite. Sentinel-6A, also known as the Jason Continuity of Service A (Jason-CS A), is scheduled for launch in November 2020 by a SpaceX Falcon 9 vehicle from Vandenberg SLC-4E. On 28 January 2020, the Sentinel 6A was renamed Sentinel-6 Michael Freilich. Sentinel-6B, is scheduled for launch in 2026.https://www.nasa.gov/sites/default/files/atoms/files/fy2021_congressional_justification.pdf - 10 February 2020 In preparation for the second-generation of Copernicus (Copernicus2.0), six High Priority Candidate \\"expansion\\" missions are currently being studied by ESA to address EU Policy and gaps in Copernicus user needs, and to increase the current capabilities of the Copernicus Space Component: * Sentinel-7: Anthropogenic CO2 emissions monitoring (CO2M) * Sentinel-8: High Spatio-temporal Land Surface Temperature (LSTM) * Sentinel-9: Copernicus Polar Ice and Snow Topography Altimeter (CRISTAL) * Sentinel-10: Copernicus Hyperspectral Imaging Mission for the Environment (CHIME) * Sentinel-11: Polar Imaging Microwave Radiometer (CIMR) * Sentinel-12: Radar Observing System for Europe - L-band SAR (ROSE-L) Contributing missions Before the Sentinel missions provide data to Copernicus, numerous existing or planned space missions provide or will provide data useful to the provision of Copernicus services. These missions are often referred to as \\"GMES Contributing Missions (GCMs)\\": * ERS: The European Remote Sensing Satellite ERS-1 (1991-2000) was ESA's first Earth observation satellite. ERS-2 (1995-2011) provided data related to ocean surface temperature, winds at sea and atmospheric ozone. * Envisat (2002-2012): Launched in 2002, ESA's Envisat was the largest civilian Earth Observation spacecraft ever built. It carried sophisticated optical and radar instruments among which the Advanced Synthetic Aperture Radar (ASAR) and the Medium Resolution Imaging Spectrometer (MERIS). Envisat provided continuous observation and monitoring of the Earth's land, atmosphere, oceans and ice caps. After losing contact with the satellite on 8 April 2012, ESA formally announced the end of Envisat's mission on 9 May 2012. * Earth Explorers: ESA's Earth Explorers are smaller research missions dedicated to specific aspects of our Earth environment. Earth Explorer missions focus on research of the atmosphere, biosphere, hydrosphere, cryosphere and the Earth's interior with the overall emphasis on learning more about the interactions between these components and the impact that human activity is having on natural Earth processes. The following two of the nine missions selected for implementation currently (as of 2019) contribute to Copernicus: ** SMOS (Soil Moisture and Ocean Salinity), launched on 2 November 2009. ** CryoSat-2 (the measurement of the thickness of floating ice), launched on 8 April 2010. * MSG: the Meteosat Second Generation is a joint project between ESA and EUMETSAT. * MetOp: MetOp is Europe's first polar- orbiting satellite dedicated to operational meteorology. MetOp is a series of three satellites launched sequentially over 12 years from October 2006 to November 2018. The series provides data for both operational meteorology and climate studies. * French SPOT: SPOT (Satellite Pour l'Observation de la Terre) consists of a series of earth observation satellites providing high- resolution images of the Earth. SPOT-4 and SPOT-5 include sensors called VEGETATION able to monitor continental ecosystems. * German TerraSAR-X: TerraSAR-X is an Earth observation satellite providing high quality topographic information. TerraSAR-X data has a wide range of applications (e.g. land use / land cover mapping, topographic mapping, forest monitoring, emergency response monitoring, and environmental monitoring). * Italian COSMO- SkyMed: the COnstellation of small Satellites for the Mediterranean basin Observation is an Earth observation satellite system that consists of (in the 1st generation) four satellites equipped with synthetic aperture radar (SAR) sensors. Applications include seismic hazard analysis, environmental disaster monitoring and agricultural mapping. As of 2019, a second-generation of COSMO- SkyMed satellites (called Cosmo-Skymed 2nd generation) is under development. * UK and international DMC: The Disaster Monitoring Constellation (DMC) is a constellation of remote-sensing satellites. There have been eight satellites in the DMC-program; 3 are currently (as of 2019) active. The constellation provides emergency Earth imaging for disaster relief under the International Charter for Space and Major Disasters. * French-American JASON-2 (2008-2019): The JASON-2 satellite provided precise measurements of ocean surface topography, surface wind speed, and wave height; as this type of measurement is a crucial requirement for the Copernicus Marine Services, the European Commission has included this type of mission in its latest communication on the future Copernicus Space Component as Sentinel 6. * French PLEIADES: The PLEIADES constellation consists of two satellites providing very high- resolution images of the Earth * Planet Labs, a commercial satellite imagery provider whose goal is to image the entirety of the planet daily to monitor changes and pinpoint trends. Data provided by non-European satellite missions (e.g. LANDSAT, GOSAT, RADARSAT-2) can also be used by Copernicus. * DigitalGlobe, an American commercial vendor of space imagery and geospatial content, provides imagery from satellites with a true maximum resolution of up to 25 cm. The DigitalGlobe tasking constellation currently includes GeoEye-1, WorldView-1, WorldView-2 and WorldView-3. Archive data is also available from IKONOS and QuickBird. * LANDSAT programme (8 satellites, 2 active). * GOSAT programme (2 satellites, 2 active). * RADARSAT-2 satellite. In-Situ Coordination GMES In-Situ Coordination (GISC) was a FP7 funded initiative, lasted for three years (January 2010 ‚Äì December 2012) and was coordinated by the European Environment Agency (EEA). In-situ data are all data from sources other than Earth observation satellites. Consequently, all ground-based, air- borne, and ship/buoy-based observations and measurements that are needed to implement and operate the Copernicus services are part of the in-situ component. In-situ data are indispensable; they are assimilated into forecasting models, provide calibration and validation of space-based information, and contribute to analysis or filling gaps not available from space sources. GISC was undertaken with reference to other initiatives, such as INSPIRE (Infrastructure for Spatial Information in Europe) and SEIS (Shared Environmental Information System) as well as existing coordination and data exchange networks. The coordinated access to data retains the capacity to link directly data providers and the service providers because it is based on the principles of SEIS and INSPIRE. The implementation of INSPIRE is embedded in the synergies and meta-data standards that were used in GISC. Data and information aims to be managed as close as possible to its source in order to achieve a distributed system, by involving countries and existing capacities that maintain and operate the required observation infrastructure.  Services component Copernicus services are dedicated to the monitoring and forecasting of the Earth's subsystems. They contribute directly to the monitoring of climate change. Copernicus services also address emergency management (e.g. in case of natural disaster, technological accidents or humanitarian crises) and security-related issues (e.g. maritime surveillance, border control). Copernicus services address six main thematic areas: * Emergency Management Service (see video available on the Copernicus.eu website: Copernicus Emergency Management Service). The service was declared operational on 1 April 2012. * Land Monitoring (see video available on the Copernicus.eu website: Copernicus Land Monitoring Service). The service was declared operational on 1 April 2012. * Marine Environment Monitoring (see video available on the Copernicus.eu website: Copernicus Marine Environment Monitoring Service). The service was declared operational on 1 May 2015. * Atmosphere Monitoring (see video available on the Copernicus.eu website: Copernicus Atmosphere Monitoring Service). The service was declared operational in July 2015. * Security (See Copernicus Service for Security Applications) * Climate Change (see video available on the Copernicus.eu website: Copernicus Climate Change Monitoring Service) The development of the pre-operational version of the services has been realised by a series of projects launched by the European Commission and partly funded through the EU's 7th Framework Programme (FP7). These projects were geoland2 (land), MyOcean (marine), SAFER (emergency response), MACC and its successor MACC II (atmosphere) and G-MOSAIC (security). Most of these projects also contributed to the monitoring of Climate Change. * geoland2 started on 1 September 2008. The project covered a wide range of domains such as land use, land cover change, soil sealing, water quality and availability, spatial planning, forest management, carbon storage and global food security. * MyOcean started on 1 January 2009. It covered themes such as maritime security, oil spill prevention, marine resource management, climate change, seasonal forecast, coastal activities, ice survey and water pollution. * SAFER started on 1 January 2009. The project addressed three main domains: civil protection, humanitarian aid and Security crises management. * MACC started on 1 June 2009. The project continued and refined the products developed in the projects GEMS and PROMOTE. A second phase (MACC II) lasted until July 2014 allowing the now operational Copernicus atmospheric monitoring service (CAMS, see above). * G-MOSAIC started on 1 January 2009. Together with the LIMES project Wayback Machine (co-funded by the European Commission under FP6), G-MOSAIC specifically dealt with the Security domain of Copernicus addressing topics such as Support to Intelligence & Early Warning and Support to Crisis Management Operations. Interaction Users \\"The information provided by the Copernicus services can be used by end-users for a wide range of applications in a variety of areas. These include urban area management, sustainable development and nature protection, regional and local planning, agriculture, forestry and fisheries, health, civil protection, infrastructure, transport and mobility, as well as tourism.\\" Copernicus is the European Union's contribution to the Global Earth Observation System of Systems (GEOSS) thus delivering geospatial information globally. Some Copernicus services make use of OpenStreetMap data in their maps production. Other relevant initiatives Other initiatives will also facilitate the development and functioning of Copernicus services: * INSPIRE: this initiative aims at building a European spatial data infrastructure beyond national boundaries. * Urban Atlas: Compiled from thousands of satellite photographs, the Urban Atlas provides detailed and cost-effective digital mapping, ensuring that city planners have the most up-to-date and accurate data available on land use and land cover. The Urban Atlas will enable urban planners to better assess risks and opportunities, ranging from the threat of flooding and the impact of climate change, to identifying new infrastructure and public transport needs. All cities in the EU will be covered by the Urban Atlas by 2011. * SEIS: The Shared Environmental Information System (SEIS) is a collaborative initiative of the European Commission and the European Environment Agency (EEA) to establish together with the Member States an integrated and shared EU-wide environmental information system. * Heterogeneous Missions Accessibility, the European Space Agency initiative for interoperability of Earth observation satellite payload data ground segments. Copernicus is one of three related initiatives that are the subject of the GIGAS (GEOSS, INSPIRE and GMES an Action in Support) harmonization and analysis project GIGAS Methodology for comparative analysis of information and data management systems, OGC 10-028r1, A.

Being designed for use against Soviet bases (never very far from the Finnish bases), radius of action was not of prime importance to this design, and only 20 tons of fuel oil were carried (as opposed to the 67 tons carried by the German Type VIIa based on this design. Combat operations Winter War Vesihiisi was alerted with Vesikko to Hanko region on 30 November 1939 as several Soviet surface combatants were headed towards the area. The submarines however failed to arrive to the area in time to intercept the and its escorts. Vesihiisi ran aground in early December 1941 and had to be docked for a few days for repairs. On 27 December Vesihiisi laid 16 mines off the Soviet naval station of Paldiski but soon after the ice forced the submarine to stay in port. Continuation War Vesihiisi started the Continuation War on 22 June by laying 20 mines in Estonian waters (controlled at the time by the Soviet Union). She laid 18 more mines on 24 June at Ruuskeri south southwest from Gogland and further 18 mines on 26 June southeast from Bolshoy Tyuters. After this the mining operation was postponed and Vesihiisi laid the 18 already loaded mines finally on 2 August east of Osmussaar. On 2 July 1941 Vesihiisi while patrolling east of Gogland encountered an escorted freighter heading east. A torpedo attack failed and the submarine suffered light damage from the escort's depth charges. On 5 August 1941 Vesihiisi attacked a convoy transporting supplies to besieged Soviet garrison at Hanko. The convoy consisted of a transport vessel of Molotov class () escorted by pair of large minesweepers and group of patrol boats. The submarine penetrated the escort screen and launched two torpedoes at a range of while being between the target and the escorts. Neither of the torpedoes exploded and the escorts forced Vesihiisi to dive to the depth of . Though the submarine did not suffer severe damage from the depth charges the repairs on the dock lasted for a week. In December 1941 after the Soviets had evacuated Hanko the Finnish submarines were docked for the winter. During the sailing season of 1941 the Italian torpedoes Vesihiisi used (Finnish designation T/40) proved to be unreliable. During 1942 Vesihiisi was upgraded with new 12-hydrophone listening arrays and equipped with depth charge rack capable of carrying 4 depth charges. The submarine was further modified by streamlining the tower and moving the 20 mm gun up to the tower. On 9 August 1942, Vesihiisi was deployed along with her two sister ships to Mariehamn. Their mission was to conduct anti-submarine and escort operations in the Sea of √Öland. In the evening of 21 October 1942 she torpedoed and sank the Soviet S-class submarine , near L√•gsk√§r in the Sea of √Öland. The captain (Sergei Lisin) and three of the crew of S-7; all of whom had been in the submarine's tower, were then captured (a fourth crewman drowned before he could be rescued). On 4 July 1944 Vesihiisi laid 20 mines between Moshchny Island (Lavansaari) and Seskar (Seiskari). The boat was attacked with depth charges by two Soviet minesweepers but was able to escape without any damage. The submarine laid further 18 mines north of Moshchny Island on 6 July 1944.

Cree was one of 70 such vessels produced in this World War II-era class. Military Sealift Command currently uses fleet ocean tugs from the Powhatan class to accomplish a similar mission today. Cree participated in several classified missions such as Operation Wigwam Service history Cree (AT-84) was launched 17 August 1942 by United Engineering Co., San Francisco, California; sponsored by Mrs. T. Colburn; and commissioned 28 March 1943, Lieutenant P. Bond in command. World War II From 10 April to 9 May 1943 Cree sailed between San Francisco and San Diego towing target sleds and dry-dock sections. She cleared on 11 May for Seattle and Dutch Harbor, and operated out of Adak from 26 July 1943 to 15 August 1944. Cree screened transports to Kiska, had towing and salvage duties, and aided the distressed Soviet ship Valery Chkalov between 15 December and 23 December 1943. Cree was reclassified ATF-84, 15 May 1944. Returning to San Francisco on 21 August 1944, Cree sailed on 1 October to serve as retriever tug for a convoy to Eniwetok, returning to Pearl Harbor on\`14 November. She cleared on 7 December on another convoy trip to Eniwetok, then continued to Guam and Ulithi on towing duty. She joined the screen of the replenishment group of the 5th Fleet at Ulithi on 8 February 1945 and sortied for the invasion of Iwo Jima, during which she stood by for salvage assignments, until returning to Ulithi to replenish on 5 March. Cree arrived off Okinawa on 16 March for salvage operations on the beachheads until 1 July, when she sailed for overhaul at San Pedro Bay, Leyte. Korean War Cree was based at Pearl Harbor for towing and salvage duties throughout the Pacific until the outbreak of the Korean War. Arriving at Yokosuka on 6 July 1950, she acted as beaching control off Kyuryuhon on 16 and 17 August, transferring salvage equipment to the Korean Navy, buoying swept channels, and supporting the Inchon landings from 15 September to 15 October with salvage and towing services. Returning to Long Beach, California, 16 June for overhaul, Cree operated alternately at Pearl Harbor and in the Pacific islands and along the west coast until 4 August 1959, when she sailed for duty based on Sasebo, Japan, until 19 December. She returned to west coast operations through September 1960 when she sailed for her 1960-61 Far Eastern tour of duty. In May 1955 Cree participated in Operation Wigwam, an underwater atomic test off of the coast of California. Vietnam During the Vietnam War Cree was part of the \\"Tonkin Gulf Yacht Club\\" (the US 7th Fleet) with missions including (but not limited to) chasing trawlers and towing floating barracks across the Pacific. \\"Friendly fire\\" incident On the morning of 18 January 1978, Cree released the ex-YO-129 as a target for \\"live\\" bombing practice by naval aircraft, while steaming off the coast of southern California. Cree then proceeded north to clear the target area, taking her assigned station, but mistakenly became a target when a \\"Navy jet aircraft\\" made an attack run on her at 1206, unleashing three 500 lb bombs on the ship and her crew. One bomb struck the mast and exploded in the air close aboard to starboard, showering the tug with fragments. The second bomb fell along the port side, sliced beneath the ship and exploded underwater off the starboard side, \\"engulfing\\" Cree in a wall of water. The third slammed into the ship on the port bow, passing through seven bulkheads in the forward part of the ship, before becoming wedged into the passageway between the chief petty officer's quarters and sick bay, though failing to detonate. The damage to the ship was severe, including holing of the mast, destruction of two life rafts, severing of the emergency power cable and fragment damage above the 01 level. Below decks, the ship's gyro was destroyed by the bomb forward, which also damaged the diving locker and bulkheads. The underwater explosion, however, caused the most serious damage, blasting several holes in bulkheads and splitting seams. Motor room B-2 became \\"a tangled mass of warped frames,\\" with equipment \\"wrenched from mountings and broken lines.\\" Flooding in excess of 2,000 gallons per minute was reported. Going to General Quarters, the crew responded immediately, but during their efforts to save the ship, discovered the live bomb where it wedged forward, just from where the repair party was stationed. Moving aft away from the 500 pounder, the repair party was temporarily relieved by an EOD team from rushed to Cree. Within 45 minutes the team was on board and able to defuse the bomb (first the EOD team called for a ship's electrician to tape up wires around the bomb. They were afraid that any current left in the wires might set the bomb off. Once the wires were taped they defused the bomb). Seven men of the repair party braved \\"rising water, leaking fuel and oil from broken lines,\\" as well as the absence of light, entering Motor Room B-2 to battle the flooding for two hours before getting it under control. Additional ships rendering assistance included , guided missile destroyer and tug , providing portable pumps, gasoline and \\"other supplies.\\" Taken under tow that evening by John Paul Jones, which transferred her to Moctobi early the next afternoon, Cree returned to San Diego on the 19th, her exhausted crew having battled for 27 hours to keep their ship afloat. The ship was struck from the Navy List on 21 April 1978, and finally sunk as a target on 27 August 1978.

Biography He was born in Moncalieri, a town in the Province of Turin, northern Italy. His long and prestigious artistic career started at an early age when he became an assistant to at age ten. One year later, he was admitted to the Accademia Albertina di Belle Arti of Turin, where he was instructed by Enrico Gamba and Odoardo Tabacchi in making sculpture. He initially adhered to the traditions of Naturalism, with Romantic and Renaissance influences, turned but later to Realism, without making concessions to the more avant-garde artistic tendencies of the 20th century. After World War II, Canonica devoted himself to more religious artworks. He gained big success in the official environment of Turin for his civic and religious monuments. Following the formative period in Turin, he moved in 1922 to Rome, and participated in important national and international exhibitions in Milan, Rome, Venice, Paris, London, Berlin, Dresden, Monaco, Brussels and Saint Petersburg, and received official recognition. Commissioned by Italian and foreign aristocracy in European courts, Canonica created portraits and commemorative works. The master of equestrian sculpture also produced medallic art. He was professor of sculpture at the Accademia di Belle Arti di Venezia (1910) and later at the Accademia di Belle Arti di Roma. He was in the first cadre of members named to the Royal Academy of Italy in 1929, and a member of the Accademia Nazionale di San Luca (1930). In 1937, he managed to obtain the concession to renovate Villa Borghese, a 16th-century building owned by the City of Rome and used as administrative offices until it was abandoned in 1919 following a fire. In exchange of the promise to donate his artworks to the city, he was allowed to use the historical building as home and studio, which he repaired and decorated at his own expense. The unusual architectural construction within the Villa Borghese gardens, called also \\"La Fortezzuola\\", is a museum since 1961 dedicated to his name, exhibiting studies, models, sketches, casts and original works of the artist. His wife donated the valuable furnishings and paintings found in their private section after her death in 1987. Canonica was also an accomplished musician and composed the operas La sposa di Corinto (1918), Miranda (1937), Enrico di Mirval, Impressioni, Sacra Terra and Medea (1959). In 1950, Italian President Luigi Einaudi nominated him life senator for his outstanding artistic achievements. Canonica died on June 8, 1959 in Rome.

The submarine was the first ship of its class of three submarines. The name vetehinen means \\"merman\\".  Combat operations   Winter War  The Finnish Navy was informed that the 8,800 ton Soviet icebreaker would be arriving in the Baltic Sea from the Atlantic. Vetehinen was sortied to intercept the icebreaker off the port of LiepƒÅja on 4 December. However, the submarine ran aground before reaching open sea and had to be pulled loose by tugs before it was able to start its voyage. Vetehinen arrived at the site on 6 December and started patrolling off the buoy on the port entrance. On 7 December the submarine sighted Yermak but was unable to reach it. While on station, Vetehinen encountered a couple of unknown submarines which were suspected to be of German origin. On 8 December Vetehinen began the voyage home and was attacked by the Soviet , but the attack failed and the Finnish submarine crew did not even notice the attempt. On 12 December Vetehinen sortied again to intercept Yermak, this time on its voyage from LiepƒÅja to Tallinn. However once again before reaching the open sea Vetehinen ran aground and had to be inspected before continuing on its mission the same day. Upon reaching the area the submarine was unable to sight the icebreaker and was recalled on 14 December.  Continuation War  On 22 June 1941 Vetehinen laid 20 mines north of Kunda, and a further 17 mines on 28 June between Gogland and Bolshoy Tyuters. On 3 July 1941 Vetehinen encountered a freighter west of Gogland but due to distance was only able to damage it with its 76 mm gun. On 3 August 1941 Vetehinen sighted a Soviet convoy consisting of pair of large minesweepers and a group of guard ships escorting a group of Soviet submarines. One torpedo was launched at a distance of to no effect. On 8 August 1941 Vetehinen launched two torpedoes at a 1500-ton freighter, but neither of the torpedoes exploded. The Italian torpedoes (Finnish designation \\"T/40\\") proved to be unreliable in service despite functioning during test range firings. It was later discovered that these torpedoes were unreliable when fired from a submerged sub because the increased water pressure caused the seals of the torpedo detonators to fail. For this reason a report that the Finns received from the besieged Hanko that a Soviet freighter had arrived there with two Finnish torpedoes sticking out from its hull became more believable. On 30 November Vetehinen sortied to intercept a convoy but was unable to reach it. On 3 December 1941 Vetehinen sighted a Soviet convoy headed due east from Hanko and engaged it. The submarine attacked on the surface but the poor quality of the night sight and the activity of the escort prevented torpedoes from being fired with any accuracy. Vetehinen fired both bow tubes and after turning around both aft tubes at the convoy without any effect, at an estimated distance of . A mere 15 minutes later the submarine sighted another Soviet convoy, this time headed due West, but had no loaded tubes and was unable to engage it. During 1942 Vetehinen was upgraded with new 12-hydrophone listening arrays and equipped with a depth charge rack capable of carrying four depth charges. The submarine was further modified by streamlining the tower and moving the 20 mm gun up to the tower. On 5 November 1942, Vetehinen rammed the in the Sea of √Öland and sank it. According to Vetehinen crew members, she was on a night patrol searching for Soviet submarines, which stayed underwater during daytime but usually came up during the night to recharge their batteries. A contact was found, and after confirmation of an enemy contact Vetehinen launched a torpedo, which missed probably due to being fired at too short distance. Vetehinen then opened fire with its deck guns. A second torpedo also missed, but the deck guns managed to damage the Soviet submarine which by then had started an emergency dive. The Captain of Vetehinen, determined not to let the submarine escape, ordered his submarine to ram the other vessel which at last was a success ‚Äì the \\"teeth\\" on the bow of the ship ripped open the Soviet submarine's hull and caused it to sink. Vetehinen suffered a minor leak from the impact but managed to return to its home port. On 5 July 1944 Vetehinen laid 17 mines near Koivisto islands.

It was built by the Crichton-Vulcan shipyard in Turku according to a project developed by NV Ingenieurskantoor voor Scheepsbouw, \\"IvS\\", and was scrapped in 1953. Combat history Winter War On 7 December Iku-Turso was sortied to intercept the Soviet freighter Ivan Papanin sailing from Stockholm. The submarine was informed of the departure time of the target and the likely route and so Iku-Turso patrolled in the international waters off Sandhamn and Svenska H√∂garne during the night. Unidentified patrol boats harassed the submarine and forced it to dive and by the time Iku-Turso was able to reach periscope depth there were no freighters in sight. Ivan Papanin had passed the area few hours earlier and likely having been warned of the presence of the Finnish submarine, it had altered its course to evade Iku-Turso. In late December 1941 Iku-Turso patrolled for a couple of days off LiepƒÅja but did not encounter any targets the rules of engagements would have allowed the submarine to attack. In January 1941 Iku- Turso patrolled four days off Saaremaa and Hiiumaa but without any luck. Continuation War On 22 June 1941 Iku-Turso laid 20 mines north of the island of Mohni/Ekholm. A further 20 mines were laid at Ruuskeri SE from Gogland on 24 June and 18 mines to south of Vaindloo on 26 June after which further minelaying operations were postponed. Iku-Turso laid 18 already loaded mines on 11 July of the coast of Estonia east of Mohni. On 30 July Iku-Turso along with Vetehinen were sortied to intercept a Soviet convoy moving to and from the besieged base of Hanko. The submarines saw the convoy but were unable to maneuver to attack position. In December 1941, after the Soviets had evacuated Hanko, Iku-Turso was docked for the winter. Though Iku-Turso had not had much chance of using its torpedoes, the experiences from other Finnish subs were that the Italian torpedoes used (Finnish designation T/40) were unreliable. During 1942, Iku-Turso was upgraded with new 12-hydrophone listening arrays and equipped with a depth charge rack capable of carrying 4 depth charges. The submarine was further modified by streamlining the tower and moving the 20 mm gun up to the tower. On 27 October 1942, after unsuccessfully attacking a Soviet with the 20 mm Madsen cannon in poor visibility, Iku-Turso later came across and torpedoed another Soviet Shchuka- class submarine. After the torpedo impacted, the target disappeared. On the impact site, the Finnish submarine located a large oil spill with even more oil still rising to the surface. The sunken submarine's identity has later been contested as several Soviet submarines of Shchuka class were lost at that time in the area but the most likely candidates are either Shch-320 or perhaps even more likely Shch-308 as some Russian sources claim that Shch-320 had been sunk by a mine earlier that month and that the initial unsuccessful attack by Iku-Turso had been against Shch-307. On 30 July 1944 Iku-Turso attempted to attack a convoy targeting a tug but failed to reach firing position. On 24 August 1944 Iku-Turso ran into an obstacle ‚Äî apparently an anti-submarine net - but was able to get loose. A mine which had been attached to the obstacle exploded but caused only light damage to the submarine.

He was particularly known for the quality of his Pinot noir.M. Frank \\"Burgundy Loses Master Winemaker\\" Wine Spectator Nov. 30th, 2006 Jayer was born in Vosne- Roman√©e. He attended the University of Dijon in the 1940s and earned a degree in oenology. Using a inheritance that included parcels in the √âchezeaux and Beaux Monts vineyards, Jayer began producing wine under his own label in the 1950s. Henri Jayer wines are now highly sought after and renowned for their balance and elegance, as well as their lushness and concentration. One bottle sells for thousands of dollars. Innovations Jayer opposed extensive use of chemicals in vineyards and advocated plowing to control weeds. Jayer believed that low yields were the foundation of truly great wines. Jayer was noted for his refusal to filter his wines and known for always destemming his grapes in contrast to habits of other growers in Burgundy that even today let stems go through the crusher when vintages does not provide enough tannins. This has the side effect of adding tannins with more green and bitter character. Jayer also invented a new technique called cold soak that is a pre-maceration avoiding spontaneous fermentation at temperature of about 10 ¬∞C for 1‚Äì4 days. The method aims to extract more complex aromas, color, less harsh tannins and add more nose to wines. He is noted for his wines from the premier cru Cros- Parantoux - a very small vineyard (only 1.01 hectares) of Vosne-Roman√©e at a high altitude above the famous grand cru vineyard Richebourg. This vineyard at the time had low reputation and was considered too much work and not worth bothering with. The soil consisted of very thin layer of clay limestone sitting on a bed of rock. The soil is very poor, it is very rocky and very cold. Jayer understood early that these conditions made up for a very good natural and fresh acidity in wines. In collaboration with Madame Noirot- Camuzet, who owned the vineyard, Jayer took care of her vineyards (beginning after the war in 1945) and for that was offered to keep half of the harvest for himself. As is the custom of Burgundy, Jayer bought piece by piece through the years of this vineyard from the Camuzet family and in 1978 he was convinced that the quality was right and decided to produce his first 100% cros-parantoux wines. Jayer made limited quantities of all of his wines (only about 3,500 bottles a year); today, you'll pay around $8,300 for a single bottle of 2001 (his last vintage) Henri Jayer Vosne Roman√©e Cros Parantoux. Later years In 1996, the French Government told Jayer that he must either retire or forfeit his pension. In response, Jayer transferred his vineyards to his nephew, Emmanuel Rouget, but was still responsible for half the wine being bottled under Rouget's name until 2002. Jayer's last vintage was in 2001. Jayer died in Dijon, France of prostate cancer, aged 84. References External links * Brown, Corie. (2006, September 23).

His wife was Catherine Rector. Early years Thomas Glascock, Jr. was born in Augusta, Georgia on October 21, 1790, seven years after the end of the American War of Independence. He studied law, gained admission to the state bar, and began practicing law in a career path that would underpin his later political service. Both his father and grandfather had distinguished themselves in military and political service to the new United States. Brigadier General Thomas Glascock Sr. rescued Count Casimir Pulaski from the Siege of Savannah, while serving in Georgia in the Virginia Dragoons during the American Revolution. General Glascock's subsequent appointment as Marshal of Georgia was conferred upon him by President George Washington on May 31, 1794. Thomas Jr's grandfather was Colonel William Glascock, who was acting governor of Georgia for a period during the American Revolution at Augusta. President George Washington stayed with William at the Glascock family plantation in Augusta during his presidency. Military service Glascock was as a captain of Volunteers in the War of 1812. He was subsequently commissioned as a brigadier general in the Georgia Militia and served in the First Seminole War in 1817. During that campaign, he served under General Andrew Jackson, later President of the United States. When President James Monroe visited Augusta in 1819, Major General Valentine Walker and General Thomas Glascock took him on a tour of the U.S. Arsenal being constructed beside the Savannah River. Political office At the age of 18, Glascock was a delegate to the constitutional convention in 1798. Political offices held by Glascock include the Georgia State House of Representatives (1812, 1817, 1821, 1823, 1831, 1834, 1839) where he also served as speaker in 1833 and 1834. Upon the resignation of John W. A. Sanford, Glascock was elected to fill Sanford's seat in the United States House of Representatives and was reelected in 1836. During his congressional tenure, Glascock served as the chairman of the Committee on Militia. Death and legacy After his political career, Glascock lived in Decatur, Georgia and died in that city in 1841. He was buried in the City Cemetery in his birthplace of Augusta. Glascock County, Georgia is named in his honor.

One of 5 key employment sites in Staffordshire, the role of the Science Park is to support the growth of innovative businesses, particularly those active in research and development within the West Midlands region by providing a high quality location and a wide range of business support services. History Keele University Stephenson BuildingThe success of the Merseyside Innovation Centre established in 1980 to promote technology transfer between local academia and industry in Liverpool spawned a second wave of Science Parks in the UK. Riding on its crest, in late 1985, the Borough Council of Newcastle-under-Lyme declared interest in creating a Science Park at Keele University. The Stephenson building, located close to the main university campus was the first development unit and currently houses Cobra Biologics Ltd, a pharmaceutical company. The Darwin building followed suit in 1991. In 1999, Keele Park Developments (KPD Ltd) was set-up as a joint venture with Pochin Development Ltd to create one of four Innovation Centres. Pochin sold its interest back to Keele in 2013https://www.ft.com/content/3131b416-b60d-11e5-b147-e5e5bba42e51 Today, Keele University Science & Innovation Park is home to over 40 companies. and employs over 600 staff. Occupancy of the Science Park remains at circa 95% of available space (including some University occupancy in IC1 and IC2). In May 2015, a Science Park review recommended the re-branding of the park with a requirement for tenants to be active in core academic activities, further development of the Nova Centre as an incubation for start- up companies and a Directorate of Engagement and Partnerships to lead future initiatives. left All employees of the Science Park can benefit from local campus amenities (bank, pharmacy, caf√©s) including the Sports Centre. There is also a Day Nursery available for 128 children aged 3 months to 5 yearshttps://www.keele.ac.uk/nursery/ on campus. St John‚Äôs CE Primary School provides further facilities in Keele village. Phase 1 Development Phase 1 of expansion witnessed the construction of 2 new 'Innovation Centres', state- of-the-art facilities for business enterprises. Innovation Centre 1 The first building simply called 'Innovation Centre' and labelled on the side as just IC was opened in 1999 by Her Majesty The Queen. With over 24,500 ft2, it is the home of companies such as bma and Siemens Wind Power R&D.; left left Innovation Centre 2 IC2 was opened shortly after in 2002. Following a review of the Science Park Strategy Group in 2015, it was agreed that IC2 would serve as the primary building for consolidation of University occupation of science park buildings over the next 5 years. Phase 2 Development leftPhase 2 was closely associated with the newly created Keele University School of Medicine with the aim to attract biotechnology companies, especially given the proximity to academic expertise and the University‚Äòs specialist resources. For example, Alliance Medical Radiopharmacy Ltd, a subsidiary of Alliance Medical, produces radio-pharmaceuticals and tracers for use in Positron emission tomography‚Äìcomputed tomography (or better known as PET-CT). The company, founded in Dublin in 2001 moved to Keele in 2005 to benefit from the relationship and closer UK client base. Medical Innovation Centre 3 left IC3 seeks to focus on medical technology and health economy start-ups with seven start-of-the-art laboratories alongside impressive office space. It was opened in 2005. Medical Innovation Centre 4 IC4 placed the emphasis on purpose-built business space with capacity for bespoke laboratory and a purpose-built plant room. The building was officially opened in 2006. Phase 3 Development Phase 3 development seeks to focus on well-designed, environmentally advanced facilities for innovative, technology-led occupiers, inward investment and university uses. These would typically include new energy ventures desiring to tap into Keele University's cutting-edge expertise in green technology.http://www.stokesentinel.co.uk/keele-university-national- centre-smart-energy/story-20809072-detail/story.html A recent example is OMNI Heat and Power Ltd, a successful green start-up which has already secured the exclusive UK distribution rights the Inresol Genious portable combined heat and power engine. The unit is the only one in the UK that can be used as a portable electrical three phase generator, or a micro combined heat and power (CHP) generator.http://www.omnihp.co.uk/renewable-energy-news-information/ With the advent of the SMART Energy Network Demonstrator and the creation on campus of Keele's own private utility network (heat, power, waste), the Science Park could be the first in the UK to be fully sustainable and a magnet for green entrepreneurs.  Innovation Centre 5  IC5 opened in August 2016 and provides further quality office, laboratory and workshop facilities. Staffordshire County Council owns the building but Keele University manage it and provide the marketing and business support services leading to its occupation.Keele University IC5 Smart Innovation Hub A new ¬£9.7m development to assist technology transfer with local businesses, the MCIL (Mercia Centre for Innovation and Leadership) is due for completion in September 2019.

It was founded in 1850 by William Wetherald, a Quaker. Reputation of the Academy Wetherald had previously taught pupils privately in the evenings, and the number of these had grown to an extent that he decided to open a school for older boys and young men. The original curriculum was reasonably standard consisting of English, mathematics, and Latin, but was thorough. Tuition cost C$21 for three months, including room and board. This was not a large amount and allowed young men who were not rich to attend. Rockwood Academy soon acquired a reputation of being superior and having higher academic standards than the grammar schools of Canada West. In 1864 Wetherald sold the school to Donald McCaig and Alexander McMillan and accepted a position as superintendent of Haverford College near Philadelphia, Pennsylvania. McCaig left to become principal of Central School in Berlin, Ontario in 1871, but McMillan remained until 1883, when the academy closed. In the 1870s the Ontario government created collegiate institutes, and these institutions were sufficiently efficient that it became hard to run a private school profitably. The original building was a log building. In 1853 a three-storey stone building with a -storey annex was built. There was a playground as well. Former students of the school include: :* James J. Hill, member of the Canadian Pacific Railway Syndicate and builder of the Great Northern Railway, who ascribed his success in large part due to his education at Rockwood, :* Arthur Sturgis Hardy, former Premier of Ontario, :* Sir Adam Beck, hydroelectric pioneer, :* Isaac Erb Bowman, Member of Provincial Parliament for Waterloo North, :* Henry Corby, Jr., Member of Parliament for Hastings West, and several others. After the closure of the Academy After the academy closed, the building remained, but it had fallen into disrepair by 1960, when Josef Drenters purchased it. He spent many years working on the restoration of the old stone building as well as a log barn and chapel on the property, as well as continuing his career as a sculptor. Drenters bequeathed the property to the Ontario Heritage Foundation under the condition that his family would still be able to live in it. The movie Agnes of God was filmed at the building. An Ontario historic plaque is located at the site of the building. Yosef Gertrudis Drenters (19301983) The sudden death of Yosef Gertrudis Drenters in the winter of 1983 brought to an early close a most distinguished career of a major Canadian sculptor, artist and preservationist. Born in 1930 in The Netherlands, his youth was spent in classical studies preparing for the priesthood. At the age of 14 he began to take drawing instructions from a local artist, Willem van Ejendhoven. Yosef was also influenced by his father, a skilled blacksmith, who was adept at making small works in forged iron. In 1951 after giving up his monastic life, he came to Canada with his family, who first settled in British Columbia. His first years in Canada were spent working variously as a lumberjack, a rancher, a miner and a farmer. In 1954 the family moved to Ontario and purchased a large farm on Highway 24 north of Guelph, where in 1958 Yosef began experimenting in sculpture after several years of painting. His first solo exhibition was organized by Florence Partridge, Chief Librarian of Massey Library at the Ontario Agricultural College. In 1960 his work was exhibited in Toronto at Dorothy Cameron's Here and Now gallery, and he was heralded by critics and collectors as a major Canadian sculptor. He received a Canada Council grant in 1961, was the subject of a CBC documentary film, and was accepted as a member of the Ontario Society of Artists. The Canadian Department of Trade and Commerce commissioned him to create a sculpture for the Tokyo Trade Fair in 1965. His Pioneer Family won the competition for sculpture for the Ontario Pavilion at Expo 67, and he was commissioned as well to create a giant toy horse for La Ronde. In 1974, Drenters was made a member of the Royal Canadian Academy. The Macdonald Stewart Art Centre in Guelph held the last exhibition of his work Images of the Madonna during the winter of 1982‚Äì1983 Many of his pieces continue to be displayed in public collections including the Agnes Etherington Art Centre in Kingston; the Art Gallery of Windsor, Edmonton Art Gallery, Hirshhorn Museum and Sculpture Garden, Smithsonian Institution, Princeton University Art Museum, Sarnia Public Library and Art Gallery, The University of Guelph, Wilfrid Laurier University and the Winnipeg Art Gallery.

Jacob Baegert in Neustadt an der Weinstra√üe (2010): \\"P. JACOBUS BAEGERT S.J., OBIIT DIE 29. SEPT. 1772\\" Johann Jakob Baegert (or Jacob Baegert, Jacobo Baegert) (December 22, 1717 ‚Äì September 29, 1772) was a Jesuit missionary at San Luis Gonzaga in Baja California Sur, Mexico. He is noted for his detailed and acerbic account of the peninsula, the culture of its native inhabitants, and the history of its Spanish exploration and missionization. Baegert was born in S√©lestat, Alsace, the son of a leather worker. Of his three brothers and three sisters, two brothers and two sisters also entered religious orders, and the third brother was a secular priest. Baegert began his Jesuit novitiate at Mainz in 1736 and received further training at Mannheim and Molsheim. After serving briefly as a professor at the college in Haguenau, he was assigned to missionary work in the New World. He went by way of Genoa and Cadiz to Veracruz, Mexico City, and finally Baja California in 1749-1751. Baegert's travels across Europe as well as his experiences in Mexico and Baja California were described in ten letters he wrote to his family (Baegert 1777, 1982). The new missionary was assigned to work among the Guaycura at Mission San Luis Gonzaga. Initially established as a \\"visita,\\" or subordinate mission station, by Clemente Guill√©n in 1721, the mission was founded in 1740 and managed in succession by Lambert Hostell and Johann Bischoff prior to Baegert's arrival. Baegert served at San Luis Gonzaga for the next 17 years, also functioning as a time as the Superior for the California missions. In 1767 the Spanish king Charles III ordered the expulsion of the Jesuits. As a non-Spanish subject, Baegert traveled back to S√©lestat and ultimately settled at Neustadt an der Weinstra√üe 1770, where he worked as a priest and teacher until he died. He published his description of Baja California in 1771, with a revised edition appearing in 1772 (Baegert 1772, 1952). Jacob Baegert was buried in Neustadt and his simple tombstone is kept there, outside of St. Mary's Catholic Church. Baegert's book includes an account of the Guaycura language and many other aspects of native culture. References *Baegert, Johann Jakob. 1772.

The name has been spelled karpatite and the mineral was improperly renamed pendletonite. Discovery The mineral was first described in 1955 for an occurrence in Transcarpathian Oblast, Ukraine. It was named for the Carpathian Mountains. In 1967, unaware of the earlier description, Joseph Murdoch analyzed and described a specimen from the Picacho Peak area of San Benito County, California and named it \\"pendletonite\\". Structure Carpathite has the same crystal structure of pure coronene. The molecules are planar and lie in two sets with roughly perpendicular orientations. Molecules in the same set are parallel and partially offset, with planes 0.3463 nm apart. That is slightly larger than the inter-layer distance of graphite layers (0.335 nm), and much larger than the C-C bond lengths within the molecule (about 0.14 nm). This \\"corrugated layer\\" structure is highly resistant to intercalation, which apparently explains the purity of the mineral. Occurrence In the Ukraine discovery location, it occurs at the contact zone of a diorite intrusive into argillite within cavities, and is associated with idrialite, amorphous organic material, calcite, barite, quartz, cinnabar, and metacinnabar. It has also been reported in the Presov Region of the Slovak Republic and in the Kamchatka Oblast in Russia. In the California location, it occurs in centimeter-size veins, associated (and somewhat contemporaneous) with quartz and cinnabar, in a silicified matrix. Crystals are up to 10 √ó 1 √ó 1 mm. Carbon isotope ratios and the morphology of the deposit indicate that the coronene was produced from organic matter in oceanic sediment, thermally decomposed, purified through hydrothermal transportation and chemical reactions, and deposition below 250 ¬∞C, after the other minerals in the intrusion.

In July 2020 Tovuz became the main site for the clashes with Armenia. Etymology Tovuz means peacock in the Azerbaijani language, and comes from Persian. Tavush is the modern name of the neighbouring Armenian city and region. The city itself, however, takes its name from an invading Oghuz tribe.Ministry of Culture and Tourism: Tovuz Economy The economy of Tovuz is partially agricultural, partially tourist based, with some industries in operation. Winemaking The history of wine production in Tovuz seems to have begun before the 7th century and according to the archaeological findings, which included vessels for wine storage and remains of tartaric acid, proves that the winemaking was apparent in the Tovuz and Ganja region during early stages of social development.Cuisine and Wine of Azerbaijan Winemaking industry was boosted in the city after German settlement. Led by Christopher Froer and Christian Gummel, many vineyards were establish. Furthermore, Tovuz became famous for producing brandy, under the name cognac, which supplied the entire Russian market. In addition to German influence in the Caucasus, Russia also played a significant role in the development of winemaking, especially in the Tovuz region in the 19th century. Russian influence was also formative in the development and production of aromatic wines. Sports The city has one professional football team competing in the top-flight of Azerbaijani football - Turan Tovuz, currently playing in the Azerbaijan Premier League. Archaeology The ancient village of Goytepe (G√∂y Tepe) is one of the largest archaeological monuments in Ganja ‚Äì Gazakh region. It is located to the right of the Kura river, 10 km east of Tovuz. The site extends over 2ha, at a maximum altitude of c. 420m. Starting in 2008, ‚ÄúTovuz Archaeological expedition‚Äù is conducting new archaeological investigations at Goytepe, and also at the Mentesh tepe ancient settlement nearby.

The Head of Chezzetcook area begins at the intersections of routes 7 and 207, near Porters Lake and West Chezzetcook, and continues along the Marine Drive to Gaetz Brook. Head of Chezzetcook is a short commute to Downtown Halifax at 29.52 kilometers; and in its heyday was a major port of call for ships delivering supplies from the city to local gold miners and early settlers. A vista of the sea marks the Head of Chezzetcook Inlet, for which the Chezzetcooks are named; and a fork in the road for both East Chezzetcook and Conrod Settlement.  History, culture and economics  Head of ChezzetcookEarly settlers of French, English, Scottish, German, and other descents populated the area. In the late 18th century, Acadian farmers supplied marsh hay to the newly founded Halifax, and lumberjacks supplied wood for building. Past industries included fish processing and a brick factory and today there still remains a saw mill at the Head of Chezzetcook. The area also saw a boom when gold was discovered a few miles away in East Chezzetcook. Most of the historic buildings are no longer standing however: gas stations, the local post office, the church hall, and many little general stores have long since disappeared. On 1 July 1916 the railway officially opened, it passed through the Head of Chezzetcook Inlet, connected Dartmouth to Musquodoboit, and carried both passengers and freight. In 1985, years after the last train, the tracks were taken up which left miles of open trails of which some parts are designated for recreation. There has been the formation of a Chezzetcook Historical Society which serves to preserve the culture and history of the Chezzetcooks. West and East Chezzetcook have much history in soft shell clam fishing. For years, people have been making a big part of their income digging clam in the Chezzetcook Inlet. The fishery today is in decline, due to overfishing, coastal development, and pollution, but with the works of The Eastern Shore Clam Fishers Association (ESCFA) and local clam fisherman, the future of the clam industry may become stable again.  Geography and transportation  Routes 7 and 107 connect to metro Halifax as well as other communities along the Eastern Shore. The East Chezzetcook Road and Conrod Settlement Road is off of Trunk 7, connecting Head of Chezzetcook to East Chezzetcook, Lower East Chezzetcook and Conrod Settlement.  Recreation and accommodation  Fresh water and ocean beaches, hiking and walking trails, ocean kayaking, sightseeing in the estuary, provincial parks, community centers. Vacation homes are the only places for overnight stays. There are facilities and stores nearby in Porters Lake. In Spring 2020, the Gaetz Brook Greenway opened. The trail begins in East Chezzetcook.  Education and schools  Over the years, several little red school houses came and went. Currently there are no operating schools at the Head of Chezzetcook, but the area is serviced by its surrounding neighborhoods. Students go to Porter's Lake Elementary, O'Connell Elementary, Gaetz Brook Junior High and Eastern Shore District High School.  Housing  Mainly single family homes consisting of a mix of older wood shingled cape and saltbox style houses along the shore, with more modern bungalow and larger homes in newer developments. This area is rural compared to neighboring Porters Lake which is mainly sub divided.  Churches  St. Anselm Church in West ChezzetcookSt. Barnabas Anglican church, one of five churches in the Parish of Seaforth, is the only church in Head of Chezzetcook. The area around the church was the former center of the community with a cemetery located both at the church in Head Chezzetcook and in Conrod Settlement. Christ Church, part of the Parish of Seaforth, is located in Lower East Chezzetcook. There is one Catholic church, St. Genevieve, in East Chezzetcook. St. Anselms was a Catholic church in West Chezzetcook. Both churches are both in the same postal district.

Camiros, Rhodes, (Louvre) The Wild Goat Style (variously capitalized and hyphenated) is a modern term describing vase painting produced in the east of Greece, namely the southern and eastern Ionian islands, between . Examples have been found notably at the sites in Chios, at Miletus and in Rhodes. The style owes its name to the predominant motif found on such vases: friezes of goats. The style developed the technique introduced during the Orientalizing Period of rendering the heads of figures in outline by applying it to the whole of a figure. Thus where previously an image was a silhouette, the Wild Goat Style allowed a greater representation of detail and marked a step forward in the progress towards naturalism. Plate in the 'Wild Goat' style, showing a sphinx with geometric and floral motifs above a zone of petals Goats are not the only creatures depicted on such vases; in common with other Orientalizing pottery, hares, lions, hounds, griffins and sphinxes are also to be found along with favoured in-filling devices like intertwining lines and dots or a checker pattern. The variety of ornamentation makes a careful distinction of a number of phases in the development of the style possible which in turn has been used to date the founding of Greek colonies in the Levant and North Africa.

Its circulation area encompassed the counties and areas of Cumbria, Lancashire, Greater Manchester, Merseyside and Cheshire, as well as parts of Stoke-on-Trent and North Wales. Its first edition was published on 27 April 2006 and it ran for twenty-one issues, the final edition being published on 14 September. The Enquirer was an attempt to create a newspaper which had more of a focus on quality writing and analysis than the main local dailies such as the Manchester Evening News but with a more regional outlook than the national press could offer. The paper was aimed at the AB demographic group, high earners with large amounts of disposable income. While many local newspapers satisfied themselves with more populist human-interest stories, the Enquirer contained a large amount of arts and political coverage, with weekly columns exploring the culture of the region from names including Flic Everett and Anthony H Wilson. News coverage was of an investigative, in-depth style. However, the paper quickly got into difficulties, falling short of a sales target of 15,000 in its first four months and laying off several journalists in August . The company attempted to re-finance, but a change in the conditions of a ¬£200,000 funding package led to the Enquirer being placed into administration on 20 September, one day before it was due to publish its twenty-second issue . Twenty-six redundancies were made, with the company unable to pay staff for the month of September, leaving many financially unsettled. The following day, this message was placed on the North West Enquirers web site by former editor Robert Waterhouse : : Very sadly, after just 21 issues, we have been forced to suspend publication of The Enquirer because the funding package we were negotiating with regional venture capital funds fell apart at the last moment. The company is now in administration. There may yet be a rescue bid. Let‚Äôs just hope something transpires. : As editor, I‚Äôd like to thank readers for your very generous response to our website. We know that The Enquirer is well read around the world, and the number of hits was growing fast week by week. Thank you again.

(Canary Islands, Spain), and the recent history of the endemic mammals in the archipelago Vie et Milieu 46:261‚Äì266. Discovery Restoration in Museo de la Naturaleza y el Hombre, Santa Cruz de Tenerife. Fossilized remains of this animal have been found practically in every part of the island, but especially in deposits in caves or volcanic pipes of the island, where it often appears together with remains of other species such as the giant lizards (Gallotia goliath). In particular, its bony remains have been discovered in large amounts in the deposit of Buenavista del Norte (in the northwest of Tenerife). Their fossils date back to the Pleistocene epoch. The first fossils were found by the naturalist Telesforo Bravo, from whom the name of the rodent is derived. Biologists Crusafont-Pair√≥ and Petter first described the giant rat in 1964. The giant rat, along with some other endemic species of the islands, became extinct due to the activities of the initial human colonists, the Guanches, who arrived around 1000 BC, including their introduction of feral cats. Today, the Museo de la Naturaleza y el Hombre in Santa Cruz de Tenerife exhibits fossil skulls and bones of this animal, as well as faithful reconstructions. Another giant rat of the Canary Islands was Canariomys tamarani. Description Fossils in Museo de la Naturaleza y el Hombre. This species was a big rat of about or more. It had a cranium that reached up to seven centimetres in length. Including the tail, the rat was over , making it the largest of its family (at least in the Canaries). A scientific study published in 2012 compared the Canariomys bravoi species to present-day arboreal rodents such as Phloeomys cumingi, the giant rat of the island of Luzon in the Philippines.Body shape and life style of the extinct rodent Canariomys bravoi (Mammalia, Murinae) from Tenerife, Canary Islands (Spain) The study revealed that among the distinctive features of C. bravoi are claws that develop almost similarly in the anterior and posterior limbs. Also the hind legs longer than the front ones evoke an intermediate form between rats and arboreal murals like Phloeomys. Canariomys bravoi was a strong and powerfully muscled rodent able to move on different substrates from the ground to the trees, and probably had digging skills.

In her obituary, the New York Times referred to her as the most powerful woman in United States politics. She worked as a political advisor and publicist to New York Governor and 1928 presidential candidate Al Smith. Biography Belle Lindner was born in 1877 in Harlem in New York City, to watchmaker Isidor Lindner and Esther Freyer. Both parents were immigrants from East Prussia in Germany. She attended the Horace Mann School, a laboratory school of Teachers College and in 1894 she attended Teachers College, Columbia University, but stayed for only one year. Early in her life, Belle worked as an actress. She studied Oral Interpretation of Literature in school and performed for private events. She later taught acting and elocution to children and considered work as a professional actress before going into politics. In 1903 she married Charles Henry Israels (1864-1911), an artist and architect, whom she met at the Alliance where he had been a volunteer club leader. They had four children, three of whom lived to adulthood: including Carlos Lindner, Miriam, and Joseph. She was widowed in 1911 when Charles committed suicide. She met her second husband, Henry Moskowitz, who had a Ph.D. in Philosophy and was a settlement worker on the Lower East Side, while working with him on dance hall reform. Their paths crossed many times during the tumultuous garment strikes of the era, and they worked together on the investigations that followed the Triangle Shirtwaist Factory fire. They married in 1914. In 1918, she started her work with Al Smith on his campaign for Governor of New York. On December 8, 1932, she fell down the front steps of her house and, while recovering from her broken bones, died of an embolism on January 2, 1933, at age 55.  Career  Her career in social reform began as a young girl with the Temple Israel Sisterhood who collected money, organized sewing for the poor, and worked with United Hebrew Charities. The Sisterhood also organized a \\"Working Girl's Vacation Fund\\" and a \\"Working Girl's Club\\" to improve the qualities of life for women living in the city. In 1900, at the age of 23, she became a social worker at the Educational Alliance, an organization whose primary focus was cultural assimilation for Jewish immigrants. She held various appointments there, eventually becoming director of entertainments and exhibits. As Belle Israels, her first effort at social reform was to clean up and license the city's commercial dance halls, which she saw as places that got young working girls into trouble. Working through the Council of Jewish Women-New York Section, by 1910 she had won laws that regulated dance hall conditions, including fire and safety and the selling of alcoholic drinks. The New York Times stated, \\"These laws did more to improve the moral surroundings of young girls\\" than any other single social reform of the period. Her first published article, \\"Social Work Among Young Women\\" focused on the importance of clubs in girls' socialization as well as the importance women have in shaping communities. She concluded that when women are influenced by \\"right ideals, social, moral, artistic, intellectual, the higher becomes their standard of living.\\" This work eventually led to her first major project: The Lakeview Home for Girls, which opened for permanent use 1911. The Lakeview was located on Staten Island and gave young women temporary shelter, as well as aid in finding work. Also with the Council, Moskowitz initiated a program for reform to make dancehalls a safer space for young women, particularly \\"working girls\\", by controlling alcohol distribution. After leaving the Alliance, Moskowitz (then Israel) wrote for the United Hebrew Charities and Charities, a social work journal, for which she later became an editorial assistant. She also joined the New York section of the Council of Jewish Women, yet another organization that helped Jewish immigrants. With her role as chair of the philanthropy committee, her focus was welfare work. She oversaw sick and poor children at a hospital on Randall's Island and visited troubled girls in reformatories. In 1913, after the Triangle Shirtwaist Factory fire, she began working to promote the grievances of workers. She mediated disputes between the Garment District unions and employers. She held this job a job she held until fall 1916. She also worked privately as an industrial mediator, writer, and advisor. In a flyer for her business, she offered counseling for factory planning and employment management that would benefit both employees and employers. She wrote, \\"‚ÄúDiscontented or poorly trained workers, unsuited to their jobs, threaten the peace of the shop. Whatever threatens peace threatens profit.‚Äù  Work with Al Smith  Al Smith connected with Moskowitz through her work as an industrial mediator and writer. She became one of Smith's most intimate advisers by working as his publicist and he kept her close at hand throughout his tenure as governor. Visitors would note her presence in the corner of his office during critical meetings. Witnesses reported that Smith would even defer to her on major legislative proposals, waiting for her approval before making final decisions. She advised him throughout the process of enacting broad reforms for the state of New York that would later inspire and direct Franklin Delano Roosevelt in the development of the New Deal during his presidency in 1932. When Smith became the Democratic Party candidate for President in 1928, Moskowitz worked as his campaign manager. She worked as his press agent during his attempt for renomination in 1932.Critical journey National Forum Find Articles at BNET at www.findarticles.com Legacy In 2009, the National Jewish Democratic Council gave its first \\"Belle Moskowitz\\" award to Ann Lewis.

The main weir is downstream, just below St. John's Bridge, where the River Cole and the River Leach join the Thames on opposite banks. There is a statue of Old Father Thames outside the lock house. The statue was commissioned in 1854 for The Crystal Palace's grounds. It was later moved to the traditional source of the Thames at Thames Head and then relocated to St John's Lock.Sharp, David (2001) The Thames Path, National trail guides 16, London : Aurum, , p.46 The statue sculpted by Raffaelle Monti is Grade II listed. History The need for a pound lock here arose as a result of the opening of the Thames and Severn Canal upstream in November 1789. It was built by J. Nock in 1790 and in its early days complaints were made of tolls being evaded by bullying bargemen. The first lock house was built in 1830, the lock- keeper being required to give up residence at the Trout Inn in accordance with Commission's rule that lock-keepers should not be publicans. The lock was reported to be in a poor state by 1857 and in 1867 was repaired. In 1905 the lock was rebuilt and a new lock-keeper's bungalow built on the other side of the lock.Fred. S. Thacker The Thames Highway: Volume II Locks and Weirs 1920 - republished 1920 David & Charles Access to the lock The lock can be reached easily from St John's Bridge which is about a mile out of Lechlade on the A417 road. Reach above the lock Statue of Father Thames by Raffaelle Monti at St John's Lock The river winds for three quarters of a mile to Lechlade, where it passes under Halfpenny Bridge (or Ha'penny Bridge), which is so named because it was once a toll bridge. Half a mile after Lechlade there is a connection to the former Thames and Severn Canal, which linked the Thames to the River Severn via the Stroudwater Navigation and the Gloucester and Sharpness Canal. The Thames and Severn Canal is the subject of a restoration plan, and so navigation beyond Lechlade may one day be possible again. The River Coln also joins the Thames at the canal junction, where there is sufficient room to wind a 70 ft narrowboat with care. There are no more locks upstream on the River Thames, with Lechlade normally considered to be the end of the navigable river, but there is a right of navigation as far as Cricklade, and small craft may be able to travel for a further three miles beyond Lechlade when there is plenty of water in the river.Nicholson Waterways Guide, Volume 7 (2006) The Thames Path follows the remaining towpath along the southern bank past Lechlade to Inglesham. The towpath extends upstream as far as the connection with the now disused Thames and Severn Canal at Inglesham, one and a half miles upstream.http://thames.me.uk/s02290.htm A new permissive path continues alongside the river as far as Upper Inglesham where the path leaves the riverside. The Thames Path next crosses the river at Water Eaton House Bridge, then Eysey Footbridge before arriving at Cricklade. Beyond Inglesham there was no towpath established for navigation, and so if no other riverside right of way exists (or permissive path made), the Thames path diverts away from the river to extend the route to Thames Head. The Thames Path makes significant diversions away from the river (in order going downstream) at Ewen, Ashton Keynes, Cricklade, Castle Eaton and Upper Inglesham.

It is mostly remembered today for the incident in 1979 when the newly elected Communist Party of India (Marxist) government of West Bengal forcibly evicted thousands of Bengali refugees who had occupied the reserved forest land on the island. The government's actions resulted in the deaths of many refugees; although the exact number is unknown, researchers believe that at least several hundred people died from police brutality, disease and starvation. The Marichjhanpi massacre forms the backdrop of Amitav Ghosh's novel, The Hungry Tide. Geography Marichjhanpi is located at . It has an average elevation of . Background The Partition of India in 1947 split the large eastern province of Bengal into two halves, along religious lines. One half became West Bengal, a Hindu-majority province in the new independent state of India. The other half became East Pakistan, the Muslim- majority eastern half of Pakistan, and later the independent country of Bangladesh. Refugee Partition was accompanied by much bloodshed and suffering, and the mass migration of millions of people - Hindus from their ancestral lands in East Pakistan across to India, Muslims from India trekking in the opposite direction. This cross-transfer of peoples continued through the decades after Partition, although at a much slower rate. While the educated upper classes were able to settle themselves in the urban environs of Calcutta, the poor Hindus were moved to areas outside West Bengal, in inhospitable terrain in Orissa and Chhattisgarh. Dry forest regions usually inhibited by the adivasis, a region broadly called Dandakaranya. There they lived in concentration camp like conditions. Similar looking huts or tarpaulin tents were put up to be crammed with refugees. The boundaries were surrounded by barbed wires and guarded. The places were named Permanent Liability Camps. Invitation to Bengal The main party of opposition in Bengal the CPI(M) continually provided voice to these refugees from Bangladesh from the outset. They argued that rehabilitation of all Bengali speaking refugees was possible within West Bengal and called upon all refugees to go there. They even assured that once in power they will all be rehabilitated in Bengal. The other view towards this generous gesture is that the CPI(M) was looking to develop a mass base among the considerable number of Refugees already in Bengal, plus encourage more to come into Bengal. In a demonstration in a refugee camp in Dandakaranya, the leader of CPI(M) himself invited all of them to Bengal, and the response he got was overwhelming. The exodus The refugees took the invitation to be genuine and as soon as the Left Front government first came to power in Calcutta in 1977, the refugees decided to move back to West Bengal. The refugees had a committee named Udbastu Unnyansil Samity who sent representatives to Bengal. And they decided upon settling in Marichjhanpi an island in Sunderbans. The CPI(M) however was no more enthusiastic about them. Now in power they seriously started to consider the impact such exodus might have. However they decided not to be too antagonistic from the beginning and mentioned that the refugees may come but they have to settle themselves, the government will not co-operate. This warning did not deter the refugees and many families went to the Sundarbans, especially those who were originally from the nearby district of Khulna in Bangladesh, and who already had relatives living from before in clearings in the forest. Antagonism to the exodus The massive inflow of refugees were met with severe and violent resistance at many places. They were detained at railway stations for days without food and water. Many were arrested and forcefully deported back to Dandyak. But that could not discourage all of the refugees who had sold off their meager belongings and decided to move out of Dandyak at any cost. Finally several groups reached at Marichjhanpi and their number was almost 40,000.

Career After studying law and being admitted to the bar in 1856, Candler began his law practice in Cassville, then the county seat of Bartow County, Georgia, where his mother's family and Congressman Cooper lived. The following year Candler moved to Decatur the county seat of DeKalb County, Georgia, where he lived most of the rest of his life. American Civil War Shortly before the American Civil War began, his father-in-law, former Representative Charles Murphey died in January 1861. In his honor, the Candler family outfitted a company of Confederate troops from DeKalb County, which was named the \\"Murphey Guards\\". DeKalb County voters elected Candler to the Georgia State House of Representatives, where he served from 1861 through 1863. In 1863, Candler accepted a commission as captain of the 10th Regiment Georgia Cavalry, State Guards, a battalion organized in August 1863, fighting with the Confederate States Army to serve for six months as local defense in a portion of the State west of the Chattahoochee River as mounted infantry.

He served in the Georgia Senate from 1868 until 1872.

His younger brother John S. Candler became a Justice of the Georgia Supreme Court (1902-1906) (as did a more distant relative Thomas S. Candler from 1945-1966). His cousin Allen D. Candler, also a Confederate officer but from Lumpkin County, Georgia, was elected Georgia's governor in 1898. His lawyer nephew, Ezekiel S.

Born in Nejdek, Bohemia (now Czechia), he entered the Jesuit order at age 18 and studied at Brno and Prague. In New Spain, he continued his studies in Mexico City and Puebla between 1756 and 1761. In 1762 he was sent to Baja California, initially to Santa Gertrudis, at that time the northernmost Jesuit establishment. After preparing under Santa Gertrudis' missionary, Georg Retz, Linck moved north in the same year to found San Francisco de Borja Adac among the northern Cochim√≠. In addition to administering the mission at San Borja, over the next five years Linck undertook a series of exploring expeditions to scout future mission sites and resolve geographical puzzles. His travels included journeys to the peninsula's west coast, to Isla Angel de la Guarda, and to the north in an ambitious but failed attempt to reach the lower Colorado River and settle once and for all the geographical question of whether Baja California was an island. When the Jesuits were expelled from Baja California in 1768, Linck returned to Bohemia, where he died in 1797. Linck's geographical and ethnographic contributions have been preserved in a series of letters and reports, as well as accounts by his contemporaries, and his key role in the exploration of the northern portion of the Baja California peninsula has been recognized (Aschmann 1959; Linck 1966, 1967; Barco 1973; Bend√≠mez and Laylander 1985).

It is listed on the National Register of Historic Places, and is one of the area's best examples of the Art Moderne style in theater architecture. The theater operated as both a first-run and second-run venue for motion pictures, and has been extensively renovated and redesigned during its history. History The Murray Theater, located at 4961 South State Street in Murray, Utah, was built in 1938 by Tony Duvall, who built the Gem and New Iris theaters in Murray, and Joseph L. Lawrence, who built the Villa and Southeast in Salt Lake and the Academy in Provo. It opened on 28 October 1938. The Murray Theater opened on 28 October 1938, showing ‚ÄúAlexander‚Äôs Ragtime Band‚Äù and ‚ÄúHawaiian Holiday‚Äù. Advertisements from local papers show that it screened two of Hollywood's first major color films: Gone with the Wind and The Wizard of Oz. The Murray Eagle reported the new theater had a white front: ‚Äú...amply lighted with the latest type of (fluorescent) lighting and the marquee and vertical sign trimmed in ruby red. The box office and entrance has been furnished in stainless steel. The lighting in the foyer and inner lobby is all in indirect tubing and is designed to blend harmoniously with the delicate wall decorations and the heavy red floor carpets. The spacious auditorium is fitted with full upholstered chairs which are so situated that every patron may have an unobstructed view of the screen. The auditorium is also lighted with concealed tubing. The aisles are five and one-half feet wide. The latest microphonic sound system and projection equipment has been installed. The theater has been provided with air conditioning, as well as large rest rooms with an ‚Äòultra-modern‚Äô lounge for the ladies.‚Äù In September 1964, Art M. Jolley purchased the Murray from Fox-Intermountain Theaters. By the end of January 1965 he completed a $15,000 ‚Äúmodernization program‚Äù on the theater. In 1981, Mr. Jolley sold the Murray to another party, but later he took the theater back. In 1989, after the death of Art Jolley, the Jolley family sold the theater to his son-in-law, Steve Webb. Steve Webb operated the Murray as a second-run theater, with the help of his wife and children, and his brother. The Murray closed for two days, starting 28 October 1992, so the stage could be enlarged to accommodate live performances.\\"Murray Theatre Will Offer Live Presentations\\", Deseret News, 30 October 1992, Page W3 Vandermeide, who had been performing at the Avalon, then moved his hypnotist show to the Murray.

The interior was remodeled with a bookstore, a Sunday School, a prayer room, and a new coffee shop. The auditorium became a 550-seat sanctuary. The Unity Spiritual Center vacated the theater in the summer of 2004 and the theater. In early 2006 the theater was remodeled as a live entertainment and dancing venue with a new stage, extensive sound, light and video technology and tiered seating platforms with a large dance floor. A pizza restaurant, built in a connected building to the south of the theater operated as a part of the theater enterprise. In December 2007, the theater was named the Murray Super Theater and hosted a variety of musical acts cultural events, private parties, and wrestling venue. The owners of the Murray Super Theater folded operations during the Great Recession. In 2015, Murray City bought the theater and incorporated it as part of its Murray City Center District redevelopment zone.

Both Aerojet and Rocketdyne carried out engine design studies for the project, but Ares was ultimately cancelled in favour of solid-fuel ICBMs, which were safer to store and could be launched with much less notice. The Ares missile series was canceled due to the inconvenience of using liquid fuel. Some reasons included extensive protection from corrosion within the silos, as well as the liquid fuel propellant, ideally used in the proposed Ares missiles, being more expensive to maintain. Thus making the transition to use the Minuteman II missiles, that ran on solid fuel, easier because solid fuel was more reliable for sand was less expensive than previous projects.

Collins Scottish Clan & Family Encyclopedia. (Foreword by The Rt Hon. The Earl of Elgin KT, Convenor, The Standing Council of Scottish Chiefs). Published in 1994. Pages 186 - 187.  Origins of the clan  The chiefs of Clan Kincaid are said to be descended from several families including the ancient Earls of Lennox, the Galbraiths of Buthernock, the Grahames and also the Comyn Lords of Badenoch. The name Kincaid appears to have been of territorial origin. One explanation is that it comes from ceann-cadha that is Scottish Gaelic for the steep place or pass. Another translation is that it might mean of the head of the rock. Yet another possibility is that it means the head of the battle, ceann-catha, possibly referring to an achievement in the family history. In 1238 an early reference to the name is found when Alexander II of Scotland granted the lands of Kincade to Maldouen, third Earl of Lennox. In the same year the Earl of Lennox granted the lands to Sir William Galbraith, 4th chief of Galbraith. The Galbraith's main castle was originally at Craigmaddie, but when the line ended in three sisters the estate was separated. One of the sisters married a Logan in 1280 and they received the lands of Kyncade by a charter from the fourth Earl of Lennox. The family then took their surname from the property, of which the spelling was then different. The Kyncade lands consisted of thirty thousand acres, extending from the River Kelvin to the River Glazert.  Wars of Scottish Independence  One member of the Kincaid family distinguished himself by gallant conduct against the English forces of Edward I of England and in 1296 successfully recaptured Edinburgh Castle. The Laird of Kincaid then held the office of constable of Edinburgh Castle until about 1314. In reference to this honorable feat, during the reign of Robert the Bruce the castle was added to the Kincaid shield as an honorable augmentation to his armorial bearings.  16th century and clan conflicts  The Kincaid family increased their landholdings in the east of the country from the late sixteenth century onwards. This included the estate of Craiglockhart, near Edinburgh that the Kincaids gained from an adventurous marriage. They later also added the estate of Bantaskin near Falkirk, the Blackness Castle near Linlithgow and the fields of Warriston that is now a suburb of Edinburgh. Malcolm Kincaid lost his left arm in a clan skirmish in 1563. He was later also involved in a feud with the Clan Lennox of Woodhead in the 1570s. The same Malcolm Kincaid was killed in 1581 by a Stirling of Glovat. The feud with the Clan Lennox has been commented by some historians as remarkable because it was due to a marriage with the Lennox family that the Kincaid name was later re-established as an independent clan in the twentieth century. In 1600 John Kincaid of Warriston was murdered by one of his grooms who had been in league with his wife. The groom was forced to confess and while Lady Kincaid was beheaded, the groom was broken on the wheel.  17th century and civil war  During the Scottish Civil War of the seventeenth century the Kincaids fought on the royalist side. However they largely campaigned in Ireland. The family suffered as a result of supporting the royalists and many of the name Kincaid emigrated to North America.  18th century and Jacobite risings  During the Jacobite rising of 1715 the Kincaids supported the exiled Stuarts and following the rising David Kincaid left Scotland and settled in Virginia. During the Jacobite rising of 1745 four sons of Alexander Kincaid, who was Lord Provost of Edinburgh and the King's Printer, fought a rearguard action after the Battle of Culloden. They were taken prisoner but managed to escape, taking a ship to America, and also settling in Virginia. The principal line of Kincaids married into the Lennox family at the end of the eighteenth century. Over the next two centuries the two families were almost synonymous but the Kincaids have now re-established themselves as an independent family. The modern Kincaids of Kincaid On 2 June 1959, Alwyne Cecil Peareth Kincaid-Lennox petitioned the Lord Lyon King of Arms to succeed to the coat of arms of his great-great-grandfather, John Kincaid of Kincaid, who had matriculated his Arms and Supporters on 29 July 1808.Public Register of all Arms and Bearings in Scotland.

Nothing remains of this today, but a house was built in 1690, enlarged during the eighteenth century and rebuilt in 1812. Kincaid House is located on the old Kincaid lands in what is now Milton of Campsie, East Dunbartonshire, Scotland in the Central Lowlands. It was the ancestral home of the Kincaids of that Ilk, with the oldest part of the house dating back to 1690. The current style of the house was designed by architect David Hamilton for John Kincaid of that Ilk in 1812. His son and heir, John Lennox Kincaid Lennox, had Hamilton design and build Lennox Castle on the ancient Lennox of Woodhead estate in the Parish of Campsie; about a mile and half west of Lennoxtown, between 1837 and 1841. The family moved there and Kincaid House was sold in 1921. It was eventually converted into a hotel and remains in use as such today. Lennox Castle was sold in 1927, and for some time after that was used as a mental hospital, as well as a maternity hospital. The last patients left the hospital in 2002, and Lennox Castle remained empty until it was severely damaged by fire on 19 May 2008. Part of the former castle grounds is now the site of Celtic Football Club's training facility (Lennoxtown Training Centre), while other parts towards Lennoxtown have become a long-term residential development to be completed in several phases, known as Campsie Village.New Campsie Village home proves just the job for Connie, Daily Record, 18 September 2014Phase 2, Campsie Village, Jones Lang Lasalle Property, 2015 Fictional Kincaids * Kincade\\"IMDB https://www.imdb.com/character/ch0348777/bio\\" is the groundsman in the 50th anniversary 'James Bond' film Skyfall starring Daniel Craig.

It was originally formed as the British Aluminium Company Ltd on 7 May 1894 and was subsequently known as British Alcan Aluminium plc (1982-1996). History British Aluminium logo In the late 1880s and early 1890s, innovations in the extraction of alumina from ore (bauxite) and of converting this into aluminium by electrolysis had precipitated a drastic fall in the price of the metal. The electrolytic process required large amounts of cheap electricity, which could easily be provided by hydro-electric power in the Scottish Highlands. The first aluminium ingots were produced at Foyers in the highlands in 1895 with the first hydro-electric powered smelter opening in 1896 followed by two more, at Kinlochleven in 1909 and Lochaber in 1929. Unsuccessful attempts at bauxite extraction in Northern Ireland forced the company to acquire a controlling interest in Union des Bauxites of Southern France. This established source was supplemented by the acquisition of bauxite rights in British Guiana during World War I followed by more in the Gold Coast (now Ghana), in 1928. The company produced carbon at three different sites in Scotland and owned four rolling mills in England. In the 1940s and '50s the company opened and/or invested in aluminium plants and infrastructure in Norway, India, Canada, British Guiana and acquired further bauxite resources in Australia. Acquisition, end In 1958, however, finance problems led to the company being taken over by Reynolds Metals and TI Group. Despite overcapacity during the 1960s, a large smelter built on the promise of cheap nuclear generated electricity commenced production in Invergordon in 1971; this plant would close eleven years later. The company was bought again by the Canadian-based Alcan in 1982. Operations were merged and the company was renamed British Alcan Ltd. In 1994, the company produced 357,000 tonnes of aluminium and made a pre-tax proft of ¬£30.9m up from a loss of ¬£22.7m the previous year. In February 1996 it was announced that Alcan was to sell British Alcan to a group of institutional investors, Mercury Development Capital, Morgan Grenfell Development Capital and CVC Capital Partners for ¬£300m. The new company would be known as British Aluminium Ltd. Alcoa acquired the \\"aluminum plate, sheet and soft-alloy extrusion manufacturing operations and distribution businesses\\" of British Aluminium in 2000 from Luxfer Group who retained some of the business.

It was designed not to exceed , as it was planned for use in Lake Ladoga, and according to the 1920 Treaty of Tartu, no nation was allowed to use naval ships of more than 100 tonnes on the lake (When completed, Saukko weighed somewhat more than this). The submarine could be divided into separate sections and transported by rail. The conning tower could be lifted off entirely. The engines were in the aft section and the batteries in the forward section. The name \\"Saukko\\" means European otter.  The construction of Saukko  The construction of Saukko began in 1928 at Sandvikens Skeppsdocka och Mekaniska Verkstad in Helsinki. The design was based on German drawings for the submarine Pu110 (\\"smaller, quickly assemblable submarine prototype\\"). Launched on 2 July 1930, Saukko was declared ready for service on 16 December 1930. At that time it was the world's smallest submarine, officially weighing only . Saukko crew consisted of 15 men. The outer hull was designed for icy conditions.  Operational history  Original plans called for Saukko to be brought to the town of Lahdenpohja on Lake Ladoga via rail, but this was never implemented. During the Winter War (1939‚Äì1940) and the Continuation War (1941‚Äì1944), the submarine operated in the Gulf of Finland.  Winter War  Saukko, accompanied by several motor torpedo boats, was towed by the gunboat Karjala to Koivisto on 7 December 1939. Since hostilities had started before the Finnish Navy had a chance to lay defensive minefields outside their coastal forts, it was hoped that Saukko might be able to accomplish that task. A Leningrad-class destroyer and five other Soviet destroyers reached the area on 8 December, and began to shell Finnish positions. The slow Saukko was unable to engage the Soviet destroyer group. On the following day ice prevented Finnish boats from sortieing against the bombarding Soviet ships, and when the ice was finally broken, half of the air valves on Saukko were frozen, which nearly caused the boat to capsize when it tried to submerge to lay a minefield. After these failures the Finnish boats were withdrawn from the area.  Continuation War  On 3 July 1941 Saukko was patrolling off the island of Sommers when she sighted a couple of patrol vessels by the pier. The submarine fired a torpedo but was forced to withdraw, without being able to observe results, by harassing Soviet patrol boats.

Muqaddimah (Preface to) MushkilƒÅtu-l-Qur'ƒÅn: The third is Tafseer Roohu-l-Ma'ani which in my opinion is an exegesis for the Qur'an on the pattern of Fath al-Bari, the exegesis of Sahih al-Bukhari, except that Fath al-Bari is the interpretation of human words. It has paid the debt of the exegesis of Sahih al-Bukhari on the Ummah. But the Words of Allah are much higher and more exalted for any human being to give its due right. '' Mufti Muhammad Taqi Usmani (DB) has written in his 'Ul≈´mu-l-Qur'ƒÅn (An Approach to the Qur'anic Sciences): Since this is the publication of latest era, he has tried to gather important discussions of previous exegeses. Hence elaborate discussions have been carried out on language, grammar, literature, rhetoric, jurisprudence, beliefs, etymology, geophysics, astronomy, philosophy, spiritualism, and relevant narrations. An attempt has been made that no scientific and literary problem should remain unanswered. In the matter of reporting of Traditions also 'Allamah Alusi (R'A) had been more careful than other commentators. In this respect it may be called synopsis of the earlier exegeses, and no work on exegesis of Qur'an can do without help from this work.

They climb by means of twining leaf stalks. One of the three species, Rhodochiton atrosanguineus, the purple bell vine, is grown as an ornamental plant. All three species are sometimes included in Lophospermum. Description Rhodochiton species are herbaceous perennials. They have long climbing or sprawling stems, branching and becoming woody at the base with age. They cling by means of twining leaf stalks (petioles). Their leaves are more or less heart-shaped, with pointed ends. The solitary flowers are carried on relatively long stalks (peduncles) that are pendant, causing the flowers to hang downwards. The sepals, usually tinted rose or purple, are joined at the base and together form an expanded bell shape around the flower. The five petals are joined at the base to form a tube, light purple at the base and dark purple towards the tips. The free ends of the petals are either all bent backwards (R. atrosanguineus) or differentiated into two groups (the other two species): the upper two being bent backwards and the lower two facing forwards. There are four stamens, either all more or less the same length or in two pairs of different lengths. The fifth stamen is sterile and rudimentary. After fertilization a globe shaped capsule forms. Taxonomy Wayne J. Elisens has outlined the somewhat confused taxonomic history of the genus name Rhodochiton. In 1829, Joseph Gerhard Zuccarini sent seeds and a description to individuals and botanical gardens under the name \\"Rhodochiton volubile\\"; however this name was not published so no new genus name was established. In 1832, Zuccarini published the name Lophospermum atrosanguineum for the same species, writing that \\"I held it at first to be new genus and sent the seeds obtained in the summer of 1829 to several gardens under the name Rhodochiton volubile. The figure in the Botanical Register [of Lophospermum erubescens D.Don] has convinced me of the identity of the genus\\" (i.e. that it was Lophospermum rather than a new genus). Not knowing of Zuccharini's change of name, in 1834 Christoph Friedrich Otto and Albert Gottfried Dietrich published and illustrated Rhodochiton volubilis. This is taken as the date for the publication of the generic name. The genus is placed in the tribe Antirrhineae; within this tribe, it is closely related to Lophospermum, Maurandya (including Maurandella) and Mabrya. It has been included in Lophospermum as section Rhodochiton. Phylogeny A number of molecular phylogenetic studies have shown that subtribe Maurandyinae, defined by Elisens to consist of the five North American genera Holmgrenanthe, Lophospermum, Mabrya, Maurandya and Rhodochiton, forms a monophyletic group, which is related to the Old World genera Cymbalaria and Asarina. Gehebrehiwet et al. suggested that the Maurandyinae could be expanded to include Cymbalaria and Asarina. Vargas et al. presented the following cladogram in 2013, in which Rhodochiton is sister to the combination of Lophospermum and Mabrya, so that including it in Lophospermum would make the latter paraphyletic. Vargas et al. concluded that the Antirrhineae evolved in the Old World and subsequently colonized North America more than once, probably in the Miocene epoch (). One such colonization led to the evolution of the Maurandyinae (in Elisen's sense). Species There are three species: *Rhodochiton atrosanguineus (Zucc.) Rothm. (syn. R. volubilis) *Rhodochiton hintonii (Elisens) D.A.Sutton *Rhodochiton nubicola (Elisens) D.A.Sutton As noted above, Elisens places all three in Lophospermum section Rhodochiton. Distribution and habitat Distribution of Rhodochiton species The three species of Rhodochiton have very local distributions: in the Sierra Madre del Sur, Mexico; northern Oaxaca, Mexico; and Chiapas, Mexico and neighbouring Guatemala. All grow in montane cloud forests, at altitudes of between . Elisens described their habitats as \\"relatively inaccessible\\". Cultivation Rhodochiton atrosanguineus was in cultivation before 1828, when seeds were given to Zuccarini by Baron Karwinski. In 1836, Joseph Paxton included it in a \\"select list of ornamental creepers\\". In frost-free areas it is perennial; in areas prone to winter frosts it can either be grown under glass as a perennial or outside as an annual, propagated from seed. In such conditions, it reaches a height of about .

The forest covers an area of 30,000 dunams (), and is the largest planted forest in Israel. History Yatir reservoir The first trees were planted in 1964 by the Jewish National Fund at the initiative of Yosef Weitz. It is named after the ancient Levite city within its territory, Yatir, as written in the Hebrew Bible: \\"And unto the children of Aaron the priest they gave Hebron with its suburbs, the city of refuge for the manslayer, and Libnah with its suburbs, and Yattir with its suburbs, and Eshtemoa with its suburbs\\" (Book of Joshua ). Over four million trees have been planted, mostly coniferous trees - Aleppo Pine and Cypress, but also many broad leafed trees such as Atlantic Terebinth, Tamarisk, Jujube, Carob, Olive, fig, Eucalyptus and Acacia, as well as vineyards and various shrubs. Yatir Forest has changed the arid landscape of the northern Negev, despite the pessimism of many experts. It has proven to be a prime ecological instrument, halting the desertification on the heights northeast of Beersheba. The forest is situated at a relatively high altitude (between 400 and 850 metres above sea level) in a semi-arid region with an average yearly rainfall of and low humidity. The ground is composed of hard lime rocks, and soft chalk rocks. The Israel National Trail, marked in 1991 runs through the forest. Yatir forest is located on the trail south of Meitar and north of Arad. Ecology research Weizmann Institute research tower Location of Yatir Forest Studies conducted in Yatir forest under the direction of Prof. Dan Yakir of the Weizmann Institute of Science, in collaboration with the Desert Research Institute at Sde Boker, have shown that the trees function as a trap for carbon in the air.Benefits of planting trees in the desert, HaaretzKKL-JNF cooperating on afforestation at Yatir forest Shade provided by trees planted in the desert also reduces evaporation of the sparse rainfall.Benefits of planting trees in the desert, Haaretz Yatir forest is also a part of the NASA project FLUXNET, a global network of micrometeorological tower sites used to measure the exchanges of carbon dioxide, water vapor, and energy between terrestrial ecosystems and the atmosphere.

The division fought in the Vyborg‚ÄìPetrozavodsk Offensive and the Vienna Offensive. Postwar, it was designated as an airborne division and disbanded in 1955. Creation From the beginning of the war, the Soviet Army strongly emphasized the development of airborne forces and their use behind enemy lines. Paradrops were often conducted in multi- regimental strengths, the most notable of these being the Vyaz'ma paradrop in 1942 and the Dnieper-Bukrinsk paradrop in 1943. The 15th Guards Airborne Division (Russian: 15-—è –≥–≤–∞—Ä–¥–µ–π—Å–∫–∞—è –≤–æ–∑–¥—É—à–Ω–æ-–¥–µ—Å–∞–Ω—Ç–Ω–∞—è –¥–∏–≤–∏–∑–∏—è) was created in June 1943 and initially deployed in the cities of Ramenskoye and Zvenigorod. It incorporated three airborne brigades (9th, 10th and 12th Airborne Brigades) and was commanded by Major General Vasilii Andreevich Leshchinin. On 19 January 1944, the division was renamed the 100th Guards Rifle Division and its component brigades renamed the 298th, 301st and 304th Guards Rifle Regiments. In addition to this core strength, the division had two artillery regiments and various complementary contingents, including communications. By mid-1944, its strength reached 12,000 men. This number was unusually high for a formation of this type, as Red Army divisions usually had strengths of about 6,000 to 7,000. Combat history In June 1944, the division was sent to the Karelian Front to take place in an operation aimed at clearing Karelia of Finnish forces. The attack started on June 21, 1944, with the 100th Guards Rifle Division performing a force-crossing of the Svir River. After three days of violent attacks, Finnish defenses were overrun and the Leningrad Oblast completely liberated. The offensive resumed shortly afterwards, and had to pass through the former Mannerheim Line, reinforced between 1941 and 1944. Taking heavy casualties, the division advanced north and arrived to the shore of Vidlitsa river on July 1, 1944. A day later, the river was crossed in force and the division resumed its offensive. However, it was stopped three days later by another river coupled with extensive defensive fortification. After yet another assault crossing and heavy fight, the offensive stopped on July 14, 1944, and the division assumed a defensive stance until mid-August. The operation lasted in total for 40 days, with the division advancing more than 200 kilometers starting from its initial positions around Leningrad. The Svir River, crossed in force by the division, would later give its name to the unit. In August 1944, the division was relocated to Kalinin and renamed the 100th Guards Svir Airborne Division, only to be renamed back to 100th Guards Svir Rifle Division a few months later. After receiving reinforcements and a new commander, Major General Ivan Alekseevich Makarenko, the division was transported to Hungary in January 1945 and integrated into the 9th Guards Army's 39th Guards Rifle Corps. Starting from mid-February, the division was part of the Soviet reserve force during the German Operation Fr√ºhlingserwachen, east of Lake Balaton, in which the 6th SS Panzer Army was trying to get through Soviet defenses. On March 16, 1945, the Wehrmacht's offensive was stopped, and an offensive on Vienna was launched immediately afterwards. The 100th Division had the task of \\"cleaning up\\" encircled pockets of German resistance. On April 2, 1945, the division started its march towards Vienna. Five days later, the troops arrived within sight of Vienna, which was turned into a fortress defended by the II SS Panzer Corps and ad hoc training and anti-aircraft units. The operation aimed at capturing Vienna started on April 7, 1945. The division occupied the southern outskirts of the city, and then executed an enveloping maneuver westwards, going around the city through the Vienna woods, engaging in heavy combat in the center of the city, seizing key targets such as the railway terminal and the parliament, and force- crossing the Danube. After five days of violent urban warfare, Vienna fell on April 13, 1945. By early May, the division was committed to the offensive towards Prague, still in the hands of the Wehrmacht. It crossed the Czech border on May 10, meeting American forces advancing from the west. Post- war After the war, the division moved from Czechoslovakia to Hungary and was located there until April 1946. In 1946, it was relocated to Belaya Tserkov' and there on 7 June 1946 renamed the 100th Guards Svir Red Banner Airborne Division (100-—è –≥–≤–∞—Ä–¥–µ–π—Å–∫–∞—è –°–≤–∏—Ä—Å–∫–∞—è –ö—Ä–∞—Å–Ω–æ–∑–Ω–∞–º—ë–Ω–Ω–∞—è –≤–æ–∑–¥—É—à–Ω–æ-–¥–µ—Å–∞–Ω—Ç–Ω–∞—è –¥–∏–≤–∏–∑–∏—è).Michael Holm, 100th Guards Airborne Division, retrieved January 2013. In 1947, it was yet again relocated to the cities of Kremenchug and Kirovograd. In 1955, following a program of reduction in strength of the Red Army, the division was disbanded. The 109th Guards Airborne Regiment moved to the 31st Guards Airborne Division. The 301st Guards Airborne Regiment transferred to the 107th Guards Airborne Division.

It is used to compress dumped PlayStation Portable UMD games, and is an alternative to the .DAX compression method. It is also sometimes called \\"CISO\\". It was the first compression method for ISO. It was created so that more memory space can be saved. Booster created the first code; it was later optimized for better compression. Other formats tried to replace it by fixing up certain issues such as lag in games, such as .DAX and .JSO. However at the time, the popular application homebrew \\"DevHook\\" used CSO. .DAX needed another loader, and .JSO was basically unused. CSO uses Deflate compression with nine levels of presets, usually with 2 KiB blocks handled individually (they could be uncompressed). While the highest levels of compression can introduce slowdown and lengthy load-times in software which relies heavily on disc streaming, even the lower levels are capable of substantial compression. This is partially due to the data layout of a UMD, though more frequently due to the use of Dummy Files as both an anti-piracy tool and a means to more optimally lay the data out physically on the disc. In addition to being used for compressing PlayStation Portable UMD games, the PSP port of PicoDrive supports compressed Sega Mega-CD disc images in the CSO format.  Other formats  CSO are known to have received later extensions in the form of CSO \\"v2\\" and ZSO (\\"ZISO\\"), using LZ4 compression for faster decompression. CSO v2 is backwards compatible with CSO v1 when using Deflate, while ZSO only supports LZ4. Documentation on these formats can be found in maxcso. DAX is a competing format with 8 KB blocks. It also allows uncompressed areas. JSO (\\"JISO\\") seems to be overall similar to CSO, with the difference of added option for LZO and a block size tweakable in the official compressor. (CSO allows a tweakable block size, but the official compressor does not allow changing it.)

He was an All-American at Duke University and in 1959 won the Outland Trophy, given to the nation's best interior lineman. After playing for the St. Louis Cardinals from 1960 to 1962, he returned as an assistant coach to Duke, and then at the University of Minnesota and the University of Wisconsin‚ÄìMadison, before becoming head coach at East Carolina University (1970) and Duke (1971-1978). At East Carolina, he compiled a 3‚Äì8 record, and at Duke he compiled a 37‚Äì47‚Äì4 record. His overall record as a head coach was 40‚Äì55‚Äì4. His best seasons came in 1971 and 1974, when he went 6‚Äì5. He later became athletic director at the University of Cincinnati (1980‚Äì1984), the University of Southern California (1984‚Äì1993), and the University of South Carolina (1993‚Äì2005). McGee was inducted into the College Football Hall of Fame as a player in 1990. He died in 2019 at the age of 80.  University of South Carolina  McGee's years at the University of South Carolina were arguably his most successful. The university did not previously have a significant history of success. Before McGee's arrival, the Gamecocks had won no national championships. McGee's goal was to build a foundation to foster athletic success for years to come. Upon his retirement, his accomplishments at the University of South Carolina included: *After winning only one football bowl game previously, the Gamecocks won three straight bowl games, including back- to-back Outback Bowl Championships against Ohio State Buckeyes football|Ohio State]. Those two victories catapulted the school to consecutive Top 20 national finishes, a first in the history of the program. Included in that stretch (2000‚Äì01) were the most wins (17) in consecutive years in the history of the football program. *McGee's ability to attract and hire high-caliber coaches. Among his hires at South Carolina were Curtis Frye (track and field), Lou Holtz (football), Ray Tanner (baseball), Dave Odom (men's basketball) and Steve Spurrier (football). Over McGee's final eight seasons, 13 Gamecock head coaches had earned either National Coach of the Year or Southeastern Conference Coach of the Year accolades. *Overseeing a dramatic increase in the athletics department's overall revenue, rising from approximately $18 million when he first came to South Carolina, to $52.8 million in fiscal year 2004. *The women's track team won the school's first national team championship, claiming the 2002 NCAA Outdoor title. *The baseball team made three straight appearances in the College World Series and was the winningest program in the country over McGee's final five seasons. *In 2000, for the first time in the history of the Southeastern Conference, South Carolina had three athletes named National Athlete of the Year in their respective sports: Kip Bouknight (baseball); Terrence Trammell (men's indoor and outdoor track); and Miki Barber (women's outdoor track). *Winning eight SEC team championships, including baseball (3), women's outdoor track (2), men's basketball (1), softball (1), and women's golf (1). *More than $110 million in facility improvements, including the 18,000-seat Colonial Center and a major expansion of Williams-Brice Stadium.

It is a bacterial cyclic lipopeptide, largely prominent for its exceptional surfactant power.Mor, A. Peptide-based antibiotics: A potential answer to raging antimicrobial resistance. Drug Develop. Res. (2000) 50: 440‚Äì447. Its amphiphilic properties help this substance to survive in both hydrophilic and hydrophobic environments. It is an antibiotic produced by the Gram-positive endospore-forming bacteria Bacillus subtilis. In the course of various studies of its properties, surfactin was found to exhibit effective characteristics like antibacterial, antiviral, antifungal, anti-mycoplasma and hemolytic activities. Structure and Synthesis  Surfactin's structure consists of a peptide loop of seven amino acids (L-aspartic acid, L-leucine, glutamic acid, L-leucine, L-valine and two D-leucines), and a hydrophobic fatty acid chain thirteen to fifteen carbons long which allows it to penetrate cellular membranes. Glutamic acid and aspartic acid residues at positions 1 and 5 respectively, constituting a minor polar domain. On the opposite side, valine residue at position 4 extends down facing the fatty acid chain, making up a major hydrophobic domain. Below critical micellar concentrations (CMCs) the fatty acid tail can extend freely into solution, and then participate in hydrophobic interactions within micelles. This antibiotic is synthesized by a linear nonribosomal peptide synthetase, surfactin synthetase (), and has, in solution, a characteristic \\"horse saddle\\" conformation (PDB: ) that explains its large spectrum of biological activity. Physical properties Surface tension Surfactin, like other surfactants, affects the surface tension of liquids in which it is dissolved. It can lower the water's surface tension from 72 mN/m to 27 mN/m at a concentration as low as 20 ŒºM. Surfactin accomplishes this effect as it occupies the intermolecular space between water molecules, decreasing the attractive forces between adjacent water molecules, mainly hydrogen bonds, creating a more fluid solution that can go into tighter regions of space increasing water's wetting ability. Overall, this property is significant not only for surfactin but for surfactants as a whole, as they are primarily used as detergents and soaps. Molecular mechanisms There are three prevailing hypotheses for how surfactin works. Cation-carrier effect The cation-carrier effect is characterized by surfactin's ability to drive monovalent and divalent cations through an organic barrier. The two acidic residues aspartate and glutamate form a \\"claw\\" of sorts which easily stabilizes divalent cations. Calcium ions make for the best-fitting cations stabilizing the surfactin conformation and functioning as an assembly template for the formation of micelles. When surfactin penetrates the outer sheet, its fatty acid chain interacts with the acyl chains of the phospholipids, with its headgroup in proximity to the phospholipids polar heads. Attachment of a cation to causes the complex to cross the bilipidic layer undergoing a flip- flop. The headgroup aligns itself with the phospholipids of the inner sheet and the fatty acid chain interacts with the phospholipids acyl chains. The cation is then delivered into the intracellular medium. Pore-forming effect The pore-forming (ion channel) effect is characterized by the formation of cationic channels. It would require surfactin to self-associate inside the membrane, since it cannot span across the cellular membrane. Supramolecular-like structures by successive self-association could then form a channel. This hypothesis for the most part applies only to uncharged membranes where there is a minimal energy barrier between outer and inner membrane leaflets. Detergent effect The detergent effect draws on surfactin's ability to insert its fatty acid chain into the bilipidic layer causing disorganization leading to membrane permeability.Kragh-Hansen, U, M Maire, and J Moller. The Mechanism of Detergent Solubilization of Liposomes and Protein-Containing Membranes. Biophys. J. (1998) 75: 2932‚Äì2946. Insertion of several surfactin molecules into the membrane can lead to the formation of mixed micelles by self-association and bilayer influenced by fatty chain hydrophobicity ultimately leading to bilayer solubilization. Biological properties Surfactin has a nonspecific mode of action, which originates both benefits and disadvantages. It is advantageous in the sense that surfactin can act on many kinds of cell membranes, both Gram-positive and Gram-negative. Its non-specificity also has bearing on its tendency to not produce resistant strains of bacteria. Consequently, this efficient mode of cell destruction is indiscriminate, and attacks red blood cells with deadly efficiency. Antibacterial and antiviral properties Surfactin, true to its antibiotic nature, has a very significant antibacterial property, as it is capable of penetrating the cell membranes of all types of bacteria. There are two main types of bacteria and they are Gram-negative and Gram-positive. The two bacteria types differ in the composition of their membrane. The Gram-negative bacteria have an outer lipopolysaccharide membrane and a thin peptidoglycan layer followed by a phospholipids bilayer, whereas the Gram-positive bacteria lack the outer membrane and carry a thicker peptidoglycan layer as well as a phospholipids bilayer. This is an essential factor that contributes to surfactin's detergent-like activity as it is able to create a permeable environment for the lipid bilayer and causes disruption that solubilizes the membrane. For surfactin to carry out its antibacterial property successfully, the bacterium needs to be treated with a high concentration. In fact, surfactin needs to be in concentrations between 12‚Äì50 Œºg/ml in order for it to carry out minimal antibacterial effects. This is also known as the minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC). The antiviral effects of surfactin distinguish this antibiotic from others. This property is such because surfactin has been found to disintegrate enveloped viruses. Surfactin not only disintegrates the viral lipid enveloped, but also the capsid of the virus through ion channel formations. This process has been proven through test on several envelop viruses such as HIV and HSV. Also, the isoforms of the fatty acid chain containing 14 or 15 carbon atoms exhibited an improvement in inactivation of the viral envelops. Unfortunately, surfactin only affected cell-free viruses and those that had penetrated the cell were unaffected. Concurrently, if surfactin were exposed to a high medium of protein or lipid concentrations, its antiviral activity would be limited. This is also known as the buffer effect and is a significant drawback in surfactin's antiviral activity. Toxicity Surfactin has one major drawback: its non-specific cytotoxicity. This is seen as surfactin has the ability to lyse animal cells as well as pathogen cells. The hemolytic effect has been the result of surfactin having the ability to lyse red blood cells that is enough to warrant caution if used intravascularly. Fortunately, these results were seen at high concentrations of about 40 ŒºM to 60 ŒºM. These concentrations also exhibited the effect of proliferating cells in vitro though it also was the for this type of cells. At concentrations below 25 ŒºM, toxicity effects of surfactin are not significant.

She inspires the citizens of the titular town to stay active. She has pink hair and as such is often referred to as 'Pinky' by the puppet character Trixie. She came to town to visit her uncle, Milford Meanswell, the mayor of LazyTown. Upon meeting the other children, she unsuccessfully attempted to get them to play along as opposed to staying at home playing video games and eating candy. This changed when Stephanie asked for the help of Sportacus. When he finally arrived, the whole town worked together to make LazyTown a more active place to live. Each episode of the show ends with Stephanie performing a song and dance routine to \\"Bing Bang\\", the show's ending theme. In the Icelandic version of LazyTown, the character is called Solla Stir√∞a, and her voice was dubbed in Icelandic by √ìl√∂f Krist√≠n √ûorsteinsd√≥ttir. The role of Stephanie was performed by Julianna Rose Mauriello in season 1 and 2. In 2011, Mauriello announced she would be leaving LazyTown, having grown too big to play the role of Stephanie. She was replaced with Chloe Lang for season 3 and 4. She was played by Kimberly Pena in LazyTown Live! The Pirate Adventure, a stage production that toured throughout the United Kingdom and Ireland in 2009. Description Stephanie was depicted as being a smart, caring, optimistic and athletic 8-year-old girl.https://web.archive.org/web/20070514005238/http://www.nickjr.com.au/site/item.asp?pageID=100&sectionID;=132&subSectionID;=412&itemID;=1057 Surprised by the inactivity of the residents of LazyTown, she cheerfully encourages them to participate in more active, energetic hobbies or pastimes and is downhearted when the temptations of candy or video games overcome her prodding. Despite this, Stephanie is characterized by her optimism and self- confidence, which she proudly promotes and shares with her peers in encouragement against all odds or challenges, always victoriously triumphing over any obstacles or antagonists by the conclusion of an episode. Stephanie's attempts are often nearly thwarted by Robbie Rotten, but his plans are never foolproof and always end with Stephanie winning. Development Stephanie was originally created by Magnus Scheving for the stage play √Åfram Latib√¶r as 'Solla Stir√∞a' (\\"Solla Stiff\\"), a girl with stiff joints who dreamt of becoming a dancer. Solla also appeared in the sequel to the stage play, Glanni Gl√¶pur √≠ Latab√¶. She was played by Selma Bj√∂rnsd√≥ttir and Linda √Åsgeirsd√≥ttir, respectively. Magnus Scheving reworked Solla into Stephanie for the LazyTown television show. Shelby Young was originally pegged to play Stephanie, and filmed one unaired pilot before departing due to union issues. Ultimately, Julianna Rose Mauriello was chosen to play Stephanie, and played her for the first two seasons and LazyTown Extra before departing due to aging out of the role. Chloe Lang picked up the role of Stephanie for seasons three and four, and as of 2020 is the most recent actress to play Stephanie. Appearance Stephanie tends to wear a pink sleeveless dress with pale pink tights, pink socks, white and pink sneakers and a purple hairband. Her outfit, though, changes from time to time. For example, in \\"LazyTown Goes Digital\\" and \\"Energy Book\\", she wears pink leggings with her usual dress. She also wears tracksuits and other items of clothing, but they are always pink (save for a few items of clothing). Her short hair is dyed pink. All her accessories are also pink. She is often seen carrying a pink purse with a heart on it, in which she carries her pink diary. Reception Child development authors Lyn Mikel Brown and Sharon Lamb assert that Stephanie is interesting and makes pink a \\"power color\\" due to her quick thinking, computer gaming and sporty nature.

The Chattanooga and Tennessee River Power Company began building the dam on September 13th, 1905 and completed it on November 11th, 1913, making Hales Bar one of the first major multipurpose dams and one of the first major dams to be built across a navigable channel in the United States. It began operation on November 13th, 1913. In 1939, the Tennessee Valley Authority assumed control of Hales Bar Dam after purchasing TEPCO's assets. TVA spent two decades trying to fix a leakage problem that had plagued Hales Bar since its construction, but after continued leakage, and after it was determined that expanding the dam's navigation lock would be too expensive, TVA decided to replace the dam by building Nickajack Dam downstream. Hales Bar Dam ceased operation on December 14, 1967.Tennessee Valley Authority, The Nickajack Project: A Report on the Planning, Design, Construction, Initial Operations, and Costs, Technical Report No. 16 (Knoxville, Tenn.: Tennessee Valley Authority, 1972), pp. 1-3, 10-11, 17-19, 307-311. Location and capacity Hales Bar Dam was located along the Tennessee River at just over above the river's mouth, near the southwest end of the Tennessee River Gorge. The dam's reservoir extended up the river through the gorge all the way to Chattanooga, and had of shoreline. Before the construction of Hales Bar, this was a particularly unpredictable and dangerous section of the river, with numerous navigation obstacles. Downstream from the dam site, the river begins to steady as it enters the hills and flatlands near Guntersville. Hales Bar Dam was high and long, and its spillway had a combined discharge capacity of . After improvements by TVA in 1949, the dam had a generating capacity of 99,700 kilowatts. The dam's lock, which went into operation on November 1, 1913, was by , and its lift was the highest in the world at that time.Tennessee Valley Authority, The Melton Hill Project: A Report on the Planning, Design, Construction, Initial Operations, and Costs, Technical Report No. 15 (Knoxville, Tenn.: Tennessee Valley Authority, 1966), pp. 6-7. Construction Cross-section of the original turbines used at Hales Bar Dam Along with Muscle Shoals and the Elk River Shoals further downstream, the Tennessee River Gorge had long been one of the major impediments to river navigation in the upper Tennessee Valley. While various 19th-century canal projects had minor success in extending navigation across the shoals, the Tennessee River Gorge remained largely untamed. In 1898, several Chattanooga business interests formed the Tennessee River Improvement Association to lobby for efforts to extend year-round navigation to Chattanooga, and around 1900, Major Dan C. Kingman of the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers drafted a design for a dam that would flood the Tennessee River Gorge and remove the swift current and various hazards that had long prevented large-scale navigation through this stretch of the river. In 1904, Kingman's friend, Josephus Conn Guild, offered to build the dam with private funding in exchange for the rights to the dam's hydroelectric power. Congress passed the enabling legislation on April 27, 1904, and with funding from Chattanooga entrepreneur Charles E. James and New York financier Anthony Brady, Guild formed the Chattanooga and Tennessee River Power Company to oversee the project. The project was estimated to cost $3,000,000 USD ($87,405,000 in 2020) but by the time the project was finished it cost $10,000,000 USD ($293,312,500 in 2020).Gilbert Govan and James Livingood, The Chattanooga Country, 1540-1962: From Tomahawks to TVA (Chapel Hill, N.C.: University of North Carolina Press, 1963), pp. 445-447. The dam's initial contractor, William J. Oliver and Company, began work on the dam in October 1905. Two self-contained communities, Guild (now Haletown) and Ladds, were built to house the thousands of construction workers needed to build the dam. The dam was originally slated for completion in 1909, but numerous difficulties brought about primarily by the soft bedrock upon which the dam was built continuously stalled construction, and by 1910, only the lock and powerhouse had been completed. Engineers finally began to make progress after employing the use of pressure grouting and concrete caissons-- the first use of either in a major dam construction project-- and Hales Bar Dam was finished on November 11, 1913. Leaks began to appear almost immediately after completion, however. In 1919, engineers attempted to minimize the leakage by pumping hot asphalt into the dam's foundation. This was temporarily successful, but by 1931, a study showed the dam was leaking at a rate of . TVA operations Hales Bar Dam in 1949, after various improvements The passage of the TVA Act in 1933 created the Tennessee Valley Authority and gave it control of flood control and improvement initiatives in the Tennessee Valley. By this time, Chattanooga and Tennessee River Power had merged with several other companies to form the Tennessee Electric Power Company, or TEPCO. The new company was eventually headed by Guild's son, Jo Conn Guild, who was a fierce opponent of TVA. With the help of attorney Wendell Willkie, TEPCO challenged the constitutionality of the TVA Act in federal court. In 1939, however, the U.S. Supreme Court handed down its decision in Tennessee Electric Power Company v. TVA in which they upheld the TVA Act, and a few months later, TEPCO was forced to sell most of its assets, including Hales Bar Dam, to TVA for $78 million.Timothy Ezzell, \\"Jo Conn Guild.\\" Tennessee Encyclopedia of History and Culture, 2002. Retrieved: 14 January 2009. After gaining control of Hales Bar Dam in 1939, TVA carried out extensive repair work on the dam's foundation that by 1943 had succeeded in halting the dam's leakage. In 1949, TVA increased the dam's generating capacity and equipped the spillway with radial gates that helped extend the Hales Bar Reservoir's navigation channel all the way to the base of Chickamauga Dam. In the late 1950s, however, boils began to appear in the water below Hales Bar Dam, and an investigation showed the dam was again leaking, this time at an alarming . Dye tests carried out in 1960 suggested that many of the leakage channels had interconnected, increasing the possibility of a future dam failure. In the 1960s, TVA began expanding the size of its dam locks to accommodate the increase in river traffic the Tennessee Valley had experienced since the end of World War II. A study in 1963 suggested that expanding the size of the Hales Bar lock would be extremely expensive, and considering the continued expenses involved with leak repair, TVA decided that would be more practical to replace the dam altogether. Nickajack Dam was authorized in January 1963 and construction was completed December 14, 1967. Operations were halted at Hales Bar Dam the following day, and by September 1968, Hales Bar Dam had been dismantled to the extent that it no longer threatened navigation on the new Nickajack Lake. Two of Hales Bar's generators and parts of Hales Bar's switchyard were installed at Nickajack. Paranormal Sightings Due to the hundreds of deaths in and around Hales Bar Dam during its construction and operation, and the battles here between Chief Dragging Canoe and settlers, Hales Bar Dam is considered by the paranormal community as the number one most haunted structure in Tennessee, number four in the United States, and the most haunted dam in the world. Paranormal investigation teams from around the world have traveled here to investigate the unexplained. It has been featured on the hit TV shows Franko TV,OmarGoshTV, Wrestling With Ghosts, Ghost Adventures, Paranormal Caught on Camera Ghost Hunters (TV series), and Kindred Spirits (TV series).

It is located at the northern end of via Carbonara, just outside what used to be the eastern wall of the old city. The name carbonara (meaning \\"coal-carrier\\") was given to this site allocated for the collection and burning of refuse outside the city walls in the Middle Ages. Interior Somma chapel. History The monastery/church complex of San Giovanni was founded by the Augustinians in 1343. The church was completed in the early 15th century under King Ladislaus of Durazzo, who turned the church into a Pantheon-like tribute to the last of the Angevin rulers of Naples. To the left of the entrance, almost at Via Carbonara is the church of the Pietatella. Architecture and decoration The current fa√ßade, with its scenographic stairwell entrance was constructed in 1707 or 1708 by Ferdinando Sanfelice. It maintains the Gothic portal with a lunette frescoed by the Lombard Leonardo da Besozzo. The interior is on the Latin Cross plan, with a rectangular nave. The main altar decorated with polychrome marble dates from 1746. The apse contains Ladislaus' tomb, commissioned by his daughter Queen Joan II from the sculptor Andrea Ciccione. The sepulchre of Sergianni Caracciolo was also completed by Ciccione. Among the main chapels are the following: * Miroballo Chapel (Cappella Miroballo) - Dedicated to St John the Baptist, and decorated by Lombard artists including Malvito and Jacopo della Pila. Here, the tomb of Antonio Miroballo was completed by Lorenzo Vaccaro and was completed before the 15th-century frescoes of San Nicola da Tolentino. * Caracciolo del Sole Chapel (Cappella Caracciolo del Sole) - Near the apse, entered by passing under the funereal monument to King Ladislao. This Renaissance style chapel has frescoes by Perinetto and Leonardo da Besozzo, and the tomb of Sergianni Caracciolo. * Caracciolo di Vico Chapel (Cappella Caracciolo di Vico) - This chapel was also completed by Renaissance painters, and included work by sculptors such as Giovanni da Nola, Girolamo Santacroce, Giovanni Domenico D'Auria, Annibale Caccavello, and Girolamo D'Auria. * Somma Chapel(Cappella Somma) - To the left of the entrance, this chapel was erected in 1557-1566 by D'Auria and Caccavello. * Seripando Chapel (Capella del Corcifisso) - the latter houses a Crucifixion by Giorgio Vasari. The church also contains a statue of the Madonna delle Grazie (1578) by Michelangelo Naccherino, and a sacristy whose decorative plan was formulated by Giorgio Vasari, with the help of Cristofano Gherardi.

Tolls are a form of user tax that pays for the cost of road construction and maintenance, without raising taxes on non-users. Investor's bonds necessary for the construction of the roads are issued and sold with the expectation that the bonds will be paid back with user tolls. The toll roads may be run by government agencies that have bond issuing authority and/or private companies that sell bonds or have other sources of finance. Toll roads are usually a government guaranteed road monopoly that guarantees limited or no competing roads will be built by government agencies for the duration of the bonds. Private toll roads built with money raised from private investors in expectation of making money from the tolls probably dominated early toll roads. Government sponsored toll roads often guarantee a minimum payment (from other taxes) to the bond holders if traffic volume and toll collections are less than predicted. If the toll authority is a private company there is often a maximum amount of fees that they may extract from users. Toll road operators are typically responsible for maintaining the roads. After the bonds are paid off the road typically reverts to the government agency that authorized the road and owns the land it was built on. Like most government taxes it is not unusual for tolls to continue to be charged after the bonds have been paid off.  History  Many modern European roads were originally constructed as toll roads in order to bring in the costs of construction. Tolls on roads and bridges were very common in England in the 12th century and in the 15th century, schemes for improving particular roads or rivers were granted by acts of Parliament that authorised justices to levy rates for the repair of certain roads. In 1706, a new concept of road tolls was introduced in England: the turnpike trusts. The turnpike trusts were authorised to erect gates, collect tolls, appoint surveyors and collectors, demand statute labour or its monetary equivalent, mortgage the tolls, elect new trustees, and undertake work necessary for repairing the roads. By 1750, most of the main roads between London and the provincial centres and some inter-provincial routes had been turnpiked. By the mid-1830s, over 1000 turnpike trusts controlled 35'000 km of main roads and disposed about 1.5 million pounds of toll receipts each year. However, the rise of railway transport largely halted the road improving schemes of the turnpike trusts, and from the 1870s, the Parliament stopped renewing the acts and roads began to revert to local authorities; toll roads passed out of fashion until the later 19th century.Albert, William (1972): The Turnpike Road System in England 1663-1840 in: Jordi, Philipp (2008): \\"Institutional Aspects of Directive 2004/52/EC on the Interoperability of Electronic Road Toll Systems in the Community.\\" Europainstitut der Universit√§t Basel. In the 20th century, road tolls have been introduced for financing the construction of motorway networks and specific road infrastructure such as bridges and tunnels. Italy has been the first European country to apply the use of motorway tolls on a 50 km motorway section near Milan in 1924. It was followed by Greece, which made users to pay for the network of motorways around and between its cities in 1927. Later in the 1950s and 1960s, also France, Spain and Portugal started to build motorways largely with the aid of concessions, allowing rapid development of this infrastructure without massive State debts. Since then, road tolls have been introduced in the majority of the EU Member States.Jordi, Philipp (2008): \\"Institutional Aspects of Directive 2004/52/EC on the Interoperability of Electronic Road Toll Systems in the Community.\\" Europainstitut der Universit√§t Basel. Road tolling has been a topic on the European Community level since the 1960s, when the Council published the Council Decision No. 64/389/EEC in order to collect data to serve as a basis for the establishment of a system of charging for the use of infrastructure under the common transport policy.Frerich, Johannes and M√ºller, Gernot (2004): Europ√§ische Verkehrspolitik. Von den Anf√§ngen bis zur Osterweiterung der Europ√§ischen Union. Band 1: Politisch√∂konomische Rahmenbedingungen. Verkehrsinfrastrukturpolitik. M√ºnchen, Wien: R. Oldenburg Verlag. However, the focus of the European Commission has rather been on lorries than on private cars, as lorries are concerned directly by the internal market. But it was only in the end of the last century, that the legal basis for road tolling was established in Directive 1999/62/EC (\\"Eurovignette\\") on European Community level. This Directive had the focus on the tolling of motorways, bridges, tunnels and mountain passes, but only for lorries over 12 tonnes maximum laden weight, and the charging was only possible for infrastructure costs. Eight years later in 2006, the Directive was amended by Directive 2006/38/EC, which has a new focus on road tolling of the trans-European road network, but leaves the EU Member States the right to apply tolls as well on roads not included in the trans-European road network. The amended Directive gives the EU Member States the possibility of varying tolls according to a number of factors such as distance travelled, place, infrastructure type and speed, vehicle characteristics, time of day and congestion level.European Commission (2003): Proposal for a Directive of the European Parliament and of the Council amending Directive 1999/62/EC on the charging of heavy goods vehicles for the use of certain infrastructures.

In addition, the EU Member States are obliged to include all vehicles over 3.5 tonnes maximum laden weight after 2012, and after 2010, the tolls must be differentiated according to the environmental performance of the vehicle.T&E; European Federation For Transport And Environment (2007): A Price Worth Paying. A guide to the new EU rules for road tolls for lorries. Second edition, June 2007. Brussels. Recently, the European Commission proposed a new, second amendment to the Directive 1999/62/EC, enableling EU Member States to integrate the cost of air and noise pollution caused by traffic in tolls levied on heavy goods vehicles and allowing tolls to be calculated on the basis of the cost of congestion imposed upon other vehicles during peak periods. Map: charging of heavy goods vehicles in the EU  Specialised system provisions  toll sticker on windshield  Toll stickers  Several European countries have toll road payment done in the form of toll stickers affixed to the car's front window, which are valid for a certain amount of time.  Toll collection for lorries  * Switzerland introduced a toll-system for HGVs over 3.5 tonnes in January 2001, and * Austria introduced an electronic toll collection system for lorries over 3.5 tonnes in January 2004, based on DSRC micro wave technology. * Germany followed suit with a toll system for lorries over 12 tonnes, with some delay due to organisational and technical problems on 1 January 2005. The German Toll Collect system is based on a technology using satellites; lorry operators may choose to either instal on-board units for automated tracking of movements, or to book their route in advance using the internet or computerised booking terminals. The toll is valid for lorries or HGVs over 12 tonnes. On 1 October 2015, the toll will be extended to lorries over 7.5 tonnes. * Hungary installed the e-toll system for lorries over 3.5 tonnes on 1 July 2013. * Lithuanian highways A1-A18 have a toll system for all vans, lorries and buses. * On 1 July 2014, Latvia introduced a toll system for all lorries over 3.5 tons on highways A1-A15.  Particular countries   Austria  As of 2017, a twelve-month sticker for private cars and motorhomes up to 3.5t is EURO 86.40 and for motorcycles EURO 34.40. A two-month sticker for private cars and motorhomes up to 3.5t is EURO 25.90 and for motorcycles EURO 13.00. A 10-day sticker for private cars and motorhomes up to 3.5t is EURO 8.90 and for motorcycles EURO 5.10.  Belarus  Major highways in Belarus are toll roads with Open road tolling (ORT) or free-flow tolling. BelToll is an electronic toll collection system (ETC), valid from 1 July 2013 in the Republic of Belarus.  Bulgaria  All vehicles using roads in Bulgaria must have a vignette sticker. It is obligatory for almost all national roads in Bulgaria, not only for highways. 2017 Price for annual sticker (valid from Jan 1 to Jan 31 next year regardless date of purchase) for vehicles under 3.5 t is 97 BGN. There's stickers for a month (30 BGN) and for a week (15 BGN). In April 2016 Bulgaria launched a tender for implementation of an electronic toll collection system for vehicles heavier than 3.5 tonnes for all roads.  Czech Republic  2017 prices for vehicles under 3.5 tonnes: Annual (R): CZK 1,500 Starts on December 1, 2016 and expires on January 31, 2018 (1 month before and after the nominal period). Month (M): CZK 440 Starts on the day marked on the sticker and expires at the end of the same day as marked on the sticker in the immediately following month. 10-day (D): CZK 310 Starts on the day marked on the sticker and expires at the end of the tenth calendar day.  Croatia  Croatian motorways are generally toll roads and most of these use networked closed toll collection system, meaning the driver receives a ticket upon entering the network and pays the toll upon exiting. Toll is paid in proportion to the length of the used section (with the exception of A2) and according to the corresponding vehicle group. The first motorway, today's A1 section between Zagreb and Karlovac, was opened in 1972. As of 2009 there are of tolled highways in Croatia, operated by four motorway concessionaire companies, notably the state-owned Hrvatske autoceste (HAC). As a cash and credit card alternative, all highway concession companies offer paying the toll via electronic toll collection (ETC) or SMART card prepaid toll card. Croatia also has a considerable network of other highways, including some grade-separated expressways and major state routes, but they are by and large not tolled. There is tolling on a handful of bridges and/or tunnels.  Denmark  The Great Belt Fixed Link the √òresund Bridge and Fjord Link Frederikssund (Crown Princess Mary's Bridge) are toll roads. In the Faroe Islands, the inter-island road tunnels V√°gatunnilin and Nor√∞oyatunnilin both have tolls (but no physical toll booths are present and the toll must be paid at nearby petrol stations).  Finland  In Finland there are no toll roads or toll bridges.  France   Germany  Autobahns are totally free (Court of Justice of the European Union verdict).  Hungary  In Hungary every motorway is a toll road, administered by the National Toll Payment Services (N√öSZ Zrt.). The roads M0 (that forms a half ring around the city of Budapest), M2 and M15 although are divided multilane roads, most sections can be used only with a sticker. A detailed map is available, showing toll roads in red and toll-exempt sections of the motorway network. Since the beginning of 2008, the purchase of a motorway sticker is handled electronically (known as an \\"e-sticker\\" or e-matrica), thus cannot be put physically on the windshield anymore, it is only registered in a computer system with its validity period. The highway cameras are checking the registered plate number and not the sticker itself. The 10 days, monthly and yearly stickers can be used for unlimited trips on every highway, within its validity period. The highway stickers can be purchased/registered online or at petrol stations (gas stations) all around the country. The purchase receipts should be kept for at least half a year after the trip.  Iceland  The Hvalfj√∂r√∞ur Tunnel was once tolled, but is toll free as of 28 September 2018.  Ireland  In Ireland there are eleven tolled road-transport schemes, operated by various independent operators. The majority of these are tolls on a major bridge or tunnel on the route. All tolled roads in the Republic were built under a public-private partnership system, giving the company which arranged for the road to be built the right to collect tolls for a defined period. Tolls vary from ‚Ç¨1.65 to ‚Ç¨12 for cars. Larger vehicles pay more, with the exception of the Dublin Port Tunnel, where buses and heavy goods vehicles travel toll-free. Tolled road segments are: *M3 motorway - on-line Toll between Junction 5 and Junction 6 (11 km); and between Junction 9 and Junction 10 (11 km) *M4 motorway - On-line toll-gate between Junction 8 and Junction 10 (28.5 km) *M6 motorway - on-line Toll between Junction 15 and Junction 16 (26.5 km) *M7/M8 motorway M7/M8 interchange - on-line Toll between Junction 18 and Junction 21 (27 km) / Junction 3 on the M8 and Junction 18 (23 km) The toll charged remains the same irrespective of the distance travelled up to the tolling point ‚Äî there is no lower price for using only part of the road. In addition, the following major bridges and tunnels (and their approaches) are tolled: *M1 Motorway Mary McAleese Boyne Valley Bridge - Between Junction 7 and Junction 10 (15 km) *M8 motorway Blackwater crossing - Between Junction 15 and Junction 17 (13 km) *N25 Waterford city bypass, Suir River Bridge - Between junction with M9/N24 and junction with R710 (3 km) *Limerick Tunnel - Between Junction 2 and Junction 4 on the N18 Road (6 km) http://www.tii.ie/roads-tolling/tolling-information/toll-locations-and- charges/Limerick-Tunnel-PPP-Route- Between-M7-Junction-30-and-N18-Junction-4.pdf *East-Link Bridge, Dublin. *Dublin Port Tunnel (M50 Motorway, Dublin) *West-Link Bridge (M50 Motorway, Dublin) Liffey valley crossing - Between Junction 6 and Junction 7 (4 km)  Italy  In Italy most autostrade (the Italian for motorways, or freeways) are toll roads. Major exceptions are the beltways around some larger cities (tangenziali) which are not part of a thoroughfare motorway, and the section of the A3 motorway between Salerno and Reggio di Calabria which is operated by the government-owned A.N.A.S. S.p.A.. Both are toll free. Since Italian motorways form a network, the toll price is proportional to the distance traveled. To let the system calculate how much the toll is, the motorist has to withdraw a ticket from an automatic dealer before entering the motorway, returning it at the toll gate on exit. If a user loses the entry ticket prior to exiting the motorway, the toll assessed will be calculated from the most distant motorway access road accessible via the same route unless the user can prove by documentary evidence (hotel invoices, petrol receipts etc.) to have entered the motorway at another access. If the vehicle is equipped with a Telepass OBU (an automatic toll collection device) the ticket should not be picked up. However, there are many exceptions: on some motorways (such as A8 and A9) the toll is collected in another way. One or more toll gates ( barriere) are placed along the route, where a fixed charge (depending on the vehicle's size) is collected, regardless of the distance traveled to get there. This alternate system is called open system ( sistema aperto). Tolls can be paid in cash, by credit card, by pre-paid card, or by Telepass, a system comparable to E-ZPass. Motorways are named AXX, where XX is a number. Numbers from 1 to 33 generally designate autostrade which are not beltways but may be parts of them (for example, one section of the A4 which is a part of the Milan beltway), while numbers from 50 to 91 designate beltways around larger cities. The A1, for example, connects Milan to Naples, the A50, A51, and A52 are part of the Milan beltway. Many motorways have nicknames (\\"Autostrada del Sole\\" meaning \\"Sun Highway\\" for the A1). The numbers have not been allocated methodically. 61% of the Autostrade are handled by the \\"Autostrade per l'Italia S.p.A.\\" company, and its subsidiaries. All of these carriers are now privately owned and supervised by ANAS. The network of motorways covers most of Italy: northern and central Italy are well covered, the south and Sicily are scarcely covered, Sardinia is not covered at all. The motorway operators are required to build, operate and maintain their networks at cost and to cover their expenses from the toll they collect. The tolls vary according to the building and maintenance costs of the motorway and the type of vehicle. Consequently, tolls can be expensive. For example, the typical Milan-Naples route of around 700 km costs approximately ‚Ç¨40. There are additional toll roads in Italy in the urban areas of Venice and Florence where tourist buses must pay a fee to enter the city. Besides the motorways, only some alpine tunnels (such as the Mont Blanc Tunnel) are tolled. Almost all other Italian roads and highways, including motorway-like dual carriageways ( superstrade) are toll-free, exceptions being the Superstrada Pedemontana Veneta (in construction) and few other places like Zovo Tunnel, on provincial road 134 in Veneto.  North Macedonia  Highways in North Macedonia which have been upgraded to avtopat standard are toll roads and they use a ticket system.  Norway  Norwegian toll road sign Norway has a sixty-year experience in road tolling for financing bridges, tunnels and roads. Until the beginning of the 1980s contributions of tolls to the road building budget stagnated at about 5%, since then it has soared to more than 25% in 2000. Those twenty years were marked by the advance of road tolling in urban areas. Norwegian authorities closely monitored Singapore's use of tolls as a means to discourage urban traffic and Bergen got its first toll zone outside the ring road on 1 February 1986. Any driver wishing to enter central Bergen by car had to pay the fee. In difference to the project in Singapore, the tolls in Norway are by law not meant as a means for regulating traffic but rather only as one for generating income to be invested in infrastructure. The lack of general protest and high income from such toll zones made them very popular initially and today toll rings circumscribe Oslo, Stavanger, T√∏nsberg, Namsos and Kristiansand. The toll ring in Trondheim was closed December 30, 2005 after 14 years in operation. However, after voteres elected a socialist city council it was reintroduced in 2014 - though there's a slight possibility entering the city from the west where few people reside, via a major detour. Toll roads around major cities are permanent, financing to a large extent non-road related infrastructure, like subsidizing subways or bike paths. While in rural areas they are normally of temporary nature to finance the building of the road. Often tolls are introduced on old roads, before the new roads are built - especially in the Oslo region. There are also several toll roads to finance road infrastructure and highways in other parts of Norway. An example of successful use is the bridge over lake Mj√∏sa which is now free of charge. A map of all public toll roads in Norway are available on the Autopass website http://www.autopass.no. The site also allows payment after passing a toll without the normal electronic badge. The Brobizz badge from Denmark works in Norway's Autopass system.  Poland  Only highways in Poland levy charges on vehicles. There are two systems: open and closed (see: Toll Roads). A toll systems operate on the following highways: * A1‚Äîpartly planned or under construction so only section Gda≈Ñsk‚ÄîToru≈Ñ is payable * A2‚Äîsection between Rzepin and Pozna≈Ñ and section Pozna≈Ñ‚ÄîStryk√≥w * A4‚Äîsection between Wroc≈Çaw and Gliwice and section Katowice‚ÄîKrak√≥w A toll is collected electronically from vans, trucks and buses. All other highways are free of charge as they do not meet all present-day requirements or are parts of Ring roads.  Portugal  In Portugal a certain number of roads are designated Toll-Roads. They charge a fixed value per kilometre distance, with several classes depending on vehicle type and regulated by the government. Several authorised franchises run them, the largest at present being BRISA. Other operators are AEA, Ascendi and Lusoponte. Some motorways operate a cash-free Via Verde system (Portuguese for Green Way) which is an electronic tag that is fitted to vehicles and automatically debits an associated bank-account with the cost of the journey made. To use these motorways foreign cars will need to buy a pre-paid pass, for 3 or 5 days or link their bank account to the system or buy a pre-paid toll card that uses a text message to link it to your vehicle registration number. Well-known roads are the A1, which goes from Lisbon to Porto and the A2, from Almada to the Algarve, or the A6, from the A2 at Marateca to the Spanish border, close to Badajoz.  Russia  A number of toll roads in Barnaul and Pskov Region (Nevil-Velezh (RUR 190 ($2.8)), Pechori-state border RUR 140($2,1)), also M4-Don (18 km close to Lipetsk costs RUR20($0,3) for cars and RUR40 ($0,6) for trucks). Ordinary speed limits apply so far. In 2007 adopted Toll Road Law and Concession Law in 2005 to develop this sector.  Spain  Spanish toll roads (or autopistas) are designated AP-XX (where XX is the number of the road) as opposed to State-maintained dual carriage-ways (or autov√≠as), called A-XX. Most of them are networked, so a ticket is issued on entering and the fee is paid when leaving the road. Technically, all the roads belong to the Government, although autopistas are built and maintained by private companies under a State concession; when the concession expires, the road reverts to State ownership, although most of them are renewed. There are some autov√≠as which are built and maintained by private companies, notably the Pamplona-Logro√±o autov√≠a A-12; the company assumes the building costs and the Autonomous Community where they are located (in the given example, Navarre) pays a yearly per-vehicle fee to the company based upon usage statistics, called \\"toll in the shadow\\" (in Spanish, peaje en la sombra). The system can be regarded as a way for the Government to finance the build of new roads at the expense of the building company. Also, since the payment starts only after the road is finished, construction delays are usually shorter than those of regular state-owned dual carriage-ways.  Sweden  Swedish toll road sign The border-crossing The Oresund Bridge (opened 2000) and Svinesund Bridge (opened 2003) have tolls. The Sundsvall Bridge (opened 2014) is a domestic toll bridge, the first for a very long time. Before year 2000 road tolls did not exist in Sweden for several decades. The Stockholm congestion tax was introduced in 2006 to reduce traffic congestion in Stockholm during peak hours. Later in 2013 the Gothenburg congestion tax was also introduced. There are no toll-booths. Instead, Swedish-registered vehicles passing into or out of central Stockholm between 06:30 and 18:30 on weekdays are identified by an automatic number plate recognition system and the owners of applicable vehicles are billed on a monthly basis.  Switzerland  Switzerland uses a Vignette system similar to Austria for private vehicles. All domestic and foreign users of motorways need to purchase such a sticker and put it on the windshield according to instructions. Only an annual sticker is available, which currently costs CHF 40, (around 34 Euros as of 20.11.2017) and allows for unlimited travel on the motorway network of the country during the calendar year. The sticker can be purchased at gas stations along the border and other convenience shops in the country. Use of motorway networks without a valid vignette is an offense against the Public Highways Act, and is punishable with cash fines of ‚Ç¨CHF 200 or more, in addition to the obligatory purchase of an annual vignette. As for trucks and lorries a performance- related heavy vehicle fee (HVF) was introduced in Switzerland on 1 January 2001. This fee replaces the flat-rate heavy vehicle charge that had been levied since 1985 and is based on a law approved by a clear majority of the electorate in September 1998. The HVF must be paid on all Swiss and foreign vehicles (i.e. those registered outside Switzerland) used for freight transport whose total maximum permitted weight exceeds 3.5 tonnes. It is levied on all public roads in Switzerland. The amount charged is based on the mileage covered, the total maximum permitted weight and the emission rating (Euro class) of the vehicle in question. The mileage covered within Switzerland is read off the tachograph that is fitted in almost all vehicles which are subject to the fee. A fee is not charged separately for trailers but in conjunction with the tractor unit. In this case, the rate is calculated according to tariffs for maximum permitted weight on Swiss roads. This maximum permitted weight may be lower than the sum of the maximum total weight of the tractor unit and the trailer since it depends on the type of tractor unit and is subject to the general national weight limit. The national weight limit is 40 tonnes. The person who is liable for the fee has at the same time a duty to cooperate. Swiss transport companies regularly declare the mileage covered by their vehicles to the Directorate General of Customs. In the case of foreign vehicles, the mileage is automatically declared at the customs post upon leaving Switzerland. The fee is then either paid direct when the driver leaves the country or charged to an account in the transport company's name. The owner of the vehicle (and in the case of foreign vehicles the driver too) is responsible for ensuring that the declaration made is correct. Equally, he is responsible for ensuring that the recording device is in good working order. This is also part of the principle of obligatory cooperation on the part of persons who are subject to the fee. No distance-related fee is levied on heavy vehicles used to transport passengers, i.e. buses and coaches, for which a flat-rate charge is levied. Certain vehicles (military vehicles, police vehicles, fire brigade vehicles, etc.) are exempt from the fee. The system for levying HVF is implemented by the customs administration in conjunction with cantonal highways offices, transport companies and authorised assembly points. The Swiss authorities invested some CHF 290 million to set up the HVF system. This sum included development (toll system, recording device, etc.), procuring and installing the necessary roadside infrastructure (beacons and associated equipment) and procuring the recording devices. The annual cost of operation, maintenance and additional staff constitutes around 7-8% of the total, which is relatively low in comparison with other electronic toll systems. HVF Overview by Swiss Customs  Turkey  In Turkey, a toll is collected on certain highways, the so-called Otoyol or Otoban. This has been done by three different systems. Every tollgate had lanes for all three payment methods. The KGS method (Kartlƒ± Ge√ßi≈ü Sistemi) (English: Card passage system) which required a Prepaid card to be presented at the tollgate. Every passing will be withdrawn from the card. However since January 2013 KGS cards have ceased to be valid. The HGS method (Hƒ±zlƒ± Ge√ßi≈ü Sistemi) (English: Fast passage system) uses a RFID chip stuck to the windshield of the vehicle. This chip is scanned automatically when passing the toll collecting point and the fee is automatically withdrawn from the connected bank account. The OGS method (Otomatik Ge√ßi≈ü Sistemi) or Automatic passage system, requires a fixed amount of money to be paid for a monthly or annual subscription. When subscribed, a barcode is affixed to the vehicle, which is scanned by CCTV cameras automatically to check for a valid subscription. The Turkish toll system cannot be avoided (except for avoiding toll roads), because due to the cameras, all vehicles without OGS or HGS registrations, or with missing or invalid chips is issued with a fine to the registered postal home address.  United Kingdom  In the 18th century and 19th century most main roads in Great Britain were managed as toll roads, by turnpike trusts, but these were gradually abolished in the 1860s and 1870s. As a result, until recently, the only tolls on roads in the United Kingdom were mainly tolled bridges and tunnels at estuaries (e.g. Humber Bridge, Severn crossing, Mersey Tunnels and Tyne Tunnel) and some small, privately owned toll roads and bridges (for example, in Dulwich College). The recently built and privately financed M6 Toll, opened in 2003 , is potentially the first of a new generation of toll roads. There are three places in the UK with congestion charges; London has the peak-time London congestion charge, Durham has a similar charge on a much smaller scale and in 2002 a congestion charge was implemented on the Dartford Crossing. In principle, UK roads today are maintained from general taxation, some of which is raised from motoring taxes including fuel duty and vehicle excise duty.

It premiered on Fox on May 23, 2006. The episode features creator David Shore's directorial debut. Plot As House and his team work on the diagnosis of Vincent, a man with a massively swollen tongue and a high temperature, a disgruntled former patient named Jack Moriarty walks into House's office and shoots House twice with a handgun. Vincent develops two additional symptoms: blood leaking into his left eye, causing it to swell outward (and eventually be removed), and a burst testicle. The symptoms appear to have no possible connection to each other. Waking up from a coma two days later, House continues to treat Vincent from his hospital bed in the ICU with Moriarty, shot by hospital security and handcuffed to his bed, as his roommate. House wakes up Moriarty and asks why he wanted him to die. Moriarty replies that it was not his intention to kill House, and that he wanted to see House suffer. The reason Moriarty wanted to see House suffer was because his wife was a recent patient that House previously treated. While diagnosing her, House badgered Moriarty until he admitted that he had cheated on her. Despite this fact having no medical relevance to his wife's illness, House told her about the affair anyway. Moriarty's wife then committed suicide shortly after being released from the hospital. He tells House that he realizes that his affair led to his wife's suicide, however he feels that House should take part of the blame because there was \\"no reason\\" to tell her about it. Since the shooting, House feels decreased pain in his leg. He finds out from his records that during the surgery to treat the gunshot wounds, a treatment of ketamine to induce a coma had been given to relieve his leg pain, but he experiences neurological side effects. It becomes clear that House cannot separate fact from fiction, as hallucinations begin to get a stronger grasp on his sense of reality, from hitting Wilson to eating tacos outside the hospital. He begins to question his own ability to diagnose, while hostility increases between him and Moriarty. As Vincent‚Äôs body begins to deteriorate, House struggles through his own self-doubts and must try to make sense of his life and world. House is seen hallucinating sitting in the passenger seat of Moriarty's wife's car next to her as she commits suicide by carbon monoxide poisoning (by starting her car with the garage door closed). House comes back to his hospital room from his daydreams and with sincerity tells Moriarty \\"I'm sorry.\\" After several hallucinations, House determines that nothing he has experienced since the shooting is real, and in order to snap out of his hallucination, decides to kill Vincent with the facility's surgical robot. House theorizes that doing this will push his mind past the point of reality and force it to believe the truth - that he is hallucinating. This is further proven when House's team tries to stop him from even using the robot, seemingly knowing he is going to kill Vincent; something that would not be possible unless everything he is experiencing is in his own mind. The surgical robot tears into Vincent and his vital signs disappear. At first, it seems House really killed him, but then Vincent drops a bullet he held in his hand. This is all the proof House needs that everything was just a hallucination, and he says \\"goodbye\\" before snapping back into reality. His theory proves to be true, and in the final minutes of the episode we see House being rushed into the ER moments after he was shot. Before the episode ends, House asks Cameron to tell Cuddy that he wants ketamine, which he supposedly received prior to the imagined events of the episode.

It is sporadic (i.e. it does not seem to be a hereditary disease), and it is currently considered acquired and idiopathic (i.e. cause remains unknown). About two-thirds of patients are of Japanese descent and the male to female ratio is 2:1. It was characterized in 1955 by internal medicine physician Leonard Wolsey Cronkhite Jr. and radiologist Wilma Jeanne Canada. Signs and Symptoms Polyps are found throughout the GI tract (most frequently in the stomach and large intestine, followed by the small intestine) though typically avoid the esophagus. A biopsy will reveal them to be hamartomas; the possibility that they progress to cancer is generally considered to be low, although it has been reported multiple times in the past. Chronic diarrhea and protein-losing enteropathy are often observed. Possible collateral features include variable anomalies of ectodermal tissues, such as alopecia, atrophy of the nails, or skin pigmentation Causes The cause of the disease is unknown. It was originally thought that the epidermal changes were secondary to profound malnutrition as a result of protein-losing enteropathy. Recent findings have called this hypothesis into question; specifically, the hair and nail changes may not improve with improved nutrition. Other conditions consisting of multiple hamartomatous polyps of the digestive tract include Peutz‚ÄìJeghers syndrome, juvenile polyposis, and Cowden disease. Related polyposis conditions are familial adenomatous polyposis, attenuated familial adenomatous polyposis, Birt‚ÄìHogg‚ÄìDub√© syndrome and MUTYH. Diagnosis There is no specific test to diagnose Cronkhite‚ÄìCanada syndrome. Diagnosis is based on symptoms and features of the disease. Management Nutritional support is fundamental, and may include dietary guidance, supplements, tube feeding, or intravenous solutions. Treatments proposed include cromolyn sodium and prednisone, as well as histamine (H2) receptor antagonists or proton pump inhibitors.

Specifically, the vectorization of a matrix A, denoted vec(A), is the column vector obtained by stacking the columns of the matrix A on top of one another: :\\\\mathrm{vec}(A) = [a_{1,1}, \\\\ldots, a_{m,1}, a_{1,2}, \\\\ldots, a_{m,2}, \\\\ldots, a_{1,n}, \\\\ldots, a_{m,n}]^\\\\mathrm{T} Here, a_{i,j} represents A(i,j) and the superscript {}^\\\\mathrm{T} denotes the transpose. Vectorization expresses, through coordinates, the isomorphism \\\\mathbf{R}^{m \\\\times n} := \\\\mathbf{R}^m \\\\otimes \\\\mathbf{R}^n \\\\cong \\\\mathbf{R}^{mn} between these (i.e., of matrices and vectors) as vector spaces. For example, for the 2√ó2 matrix A = \\\\begin{bmatrix} a & b \\\\\\\\\\\\ c & d \\\\end{bmatrix}, the vectorization is \\\\mathrm{vec}(A) = \\\\begin{bmatrix} a \\\\\\\\\\\\ c \\\\\\\\\\\\ b \\\\\\\\\\\\ d \\\\end{bmatrix}. Compatibility with Kronecker products The vectorization is frequently used together with the Kronecker product to express matrix multiplication as a linear transformation on matrices. In particular, : \\\\text{vec}(ABC)=(C^\\\\mathrm{T}\\\\otimes A)\\\\text{vec}(B) for matrices A, B, and C of dimensions k√ól, l√óm, and m√ón. For example, if \\\\text{ad}_A(X) = AX-XA (the adjoint endomorphism of the Lie algebra of all n√ón matrices with complex entries), then \\\\text{vec}(\\\\text{ad}_A(X)) = (I_n\\\\otimes A - A^\\\\mathrm{T} \\\\otimes I_n ) \\\\text{vec}(X), where I_n is the n√ón identity matrix. There are two other useful formulations: : \\\\text{vec}(ABC)=(I_n\\\\otimes AB)\\\\text{vec}(C) =(C^\\\\mathrm{T}B^\\\\mathrm{T}\\\\otimes I_k)\\\\text{vec}(A) : \\\\text{vec}(AB)=(I_m\\\\otimes A)\\\\text{vec}(B) =(B^\\\\mathrm{T}\\\\otimes I_k)\\\\text{vec}(A) More generally, it has been shown that vectorization is a self-adjunction in the monoidal closed structure of any category of matrices. Compatibility with Hadamard products Vectorization is an algebra homomorphism from the space of matrices with the Hadamard (entrywise) product to Cn2 with its Hadamard product: :\\\\mathrm{vec}(A \\\\circ B) = \\\\mathrm{vec}(A) \\\\circ \\\\mathrm{vec}(B) . Compatibility with inner products Vectorization is a unitary transformation from the space of n√ón matrices with the Frobenius (or Hilbert‚ÄìSchmidt) inner product to Cn2 : \\\\mathrm{tr}(A^\\\\top B) = \\\\mathrm{vec}(A)^\\\\top \\\\mathrm{vec}(B) =\\\\mathrm{vec}(B^\\\\top)^\\\\top \\\\mathrm{vec}(A). where the superscript T denotes the conjugate transpose. Vectorization as a linear sum The matrix vectorization operation can be written in terms of a linear sum. Let X be an matrix that we want to vectorize, and let ei be the i-th canonical basis vector for the n-dimensional space, that is \\\\mathbf{e}_i=\\\\left[0,...,0,1,0,...,0\\\\right]^T. Let Bi be a block matrix defined as follows: \\\\mathbf{B}_i = \\\\begin{bmatrix} \\\\mathbf{0} \\\\\\\\\\\\ \\\\vdots \\\\\\\\\\\\ \\\\mathbf{0} \\\\\\\\\\\\ \\\\mathbf{I}_m \\\\\\\\\\\\ \\\\mathbf{0} \\\\\\\\\\\\ \\\\vdots \\\\\\\\\\\\ \\\\mathbf{0} \\\\end{bmatrix} = \\\\mathbf{e}_i \\\\otimes \\\\mathbf{I}_m Bi consists of n block matrices of size , stacked column-wise, and all these matrices are all- zero except for the i-th one, which is a identity matrix Im. Then the vectorized version of X can be expressed as follows: \\\\text{vec}(\\\\mathbf{X}) = \\\\sum_{i=1}^{n} \\\\mathbf{B}_i \\\\mathbf{X} \\\\mathbf{e}_i Multiplication of X by ei extracts the i-th column, while multiplication by Bi puts it into the desired position in the final vector. Alternatively, the linear sum can be expressed using the Kronecker product: \\\\text{vec}(\\\\mathbf{X}) = \\\\sum_{i=1}^{n} \\\\mathbf{e}_i \\\\otimes \\\\mathbf{X} \\\\mathbf{e}_i Half-vectorization For a symmetric matrix A, the vector vec(A) contains more information than is strictly necessary, since the matrix is completely determined by the symmetry together with the lower triangular portion, that is, the entries on and below the main diagonal. For such matrices, the half-vectorization is sometimes more useful than the vectorization. The half-vectorization, vech(A), of a symmetric n √ó n matrix A is the column vector obtained by vectorizing only the lower triangular part of A: :vech(A) = [ A1,1, ..., An,1, A2,2, ..., An,2, ..., An‚àí1,n‚àí1,An,n‚àí1, An,n ]T. For example, for the 2√ó2 matrix A = \\\\begin{bmatrix} a & b \\\\\\\\\\\\ b & d \\\\end{bmatrix}, the half-vectorization is vech(A) = \\\\begin{bmatrix} a \\\\\\\\\\\\ b \\\\\\\\\\\\ d \\\\end{bmatrix}. There exist unique matrices transforming the half-vectorization of a matrix to its vectorization and vice versa called, respectively, the duplication matrix and the elimination matrix. Programming language Programming languages that implement matrices may have easy means for vectorization. In Matlab/GNU Octave a matrix \`A\` can be vectorized by \`A(:)\`. GNU Octave also allows vectorization and half- vectorization with \`vec(A)\` and \`vech(A)\` respectively. Julia has the \`vec(A)\` function as well. In Python NumPy arrays implement the 'flatten' method, while in R the desired effect can be achieved via the \`c()\` or \`as.vector()\` functions. In R, function \`vec()\` of package 'ks' allows vectorization and function \`vech()\` implemented in both packages 'ks' and 'sn' allows half- vectorization. Notes :1.The identity for row-major vectorization is \\\\text{vec}(ABC)=(A \\\\otimes C^\\\\mathrm{T})\\\\text{vec}(B).

St. Niklaus () is a village and a municipality in the Mattertal, part of the district of Visp in the canton of Valais in Switzerland. History St. Niklaus is first mentioned in 1233 as chousun. In 1272 it was mentioned as ecclesia Sancti Nicholai de Chouson, Gebreitun de Gazun, 1388 in villa sti nicolai de chosun, niu a fr Saint-Nicolas. Mountain guide dynasty St. Niklaus is home to a famous mountain guide dynasty. It was founded in the mid-19th century by: * Josef Marie Lochmatter (1833-1882) * Peter Knubel (1832-1919; his best friend) * Alois Pollinger (1844-1910; his brother-in-law) * Josef Imboden (1840-1925; Knubel's cousin)Christian Imboden: Berge: Beruf, Berufung, Schicksal. Die St. Niklauser Bergf√ºhrer als Wegbereiter des internationalen Alpinismus, Rotten Verlag, Visp, 2013, Lochmatter and Knubel were the first well-informed guides of the Matterhorn and were consequently pioneers in the development of modern tourism in the valley of St. Niklaus and particularly in Zermatt. They also had a monopoly on Matterhorn ascents. Moreover, as the first Swiss guide to do so, Knubel climbed a mountain outside the Alps in 1874, the highest European summit, Elbrus in the Caucasus. Pollinger invented the double-rope system of descent, which he used successfully at the Ridge of Ferp√®cle. Imboden was the first Swiss to ascend an (unnamed) 6,000 meter-high mountain in the Himalayas in 1883, where the highest mountains in the world are located. The fathers trained the sons very early in their expeditions. The initiators of the new school came out of their ranks for the second time, a fact that gave a new input to alpinism and the level of which was not reached again until the 1930s. They were not satisfied to simply climb a high mountain; they always chose more and more difficult routes. The three rope teams of St. Niklaus have made the totality of the possible expeditions in this area of the Alps: * Josef Lochmatter (1872-1914) with Valentine J.E. Ryan * Josef Pollinger (1873-1943) with Robert W. Lloyd * Josef Knubel (1881-1961) with Geoffrey W. Young They were the also first ski-guides and were also pioneers overseas. The mountain guides of St. Niklaus have effected about 300 first ascents a little bit everywhere in the world. Routes and mountains in Switzerland, France, Norway and Canada bear their names, for example * the Ridge of the Four Asses in Switzerland (Dent Blanche, first ascent by Alois Pollinger in 1882) * the Chimney Lochmatter in France (Aiguille du Gr√©pon, first ascent by Josef Lochmatter in 1913), * the Chimney Knubel in France (Aiguille du Gr√©pon, first ascent by Josef Knubel in 1911), * the Imbodentind in Norway (first ascent by Josef Imboden in 1899), * Mount Pollinger and Mount Sarbach in Canada. In 1995 a monument for all guides of St. Niklaus was built. Moreover, in 2000 a museum of the mountain guides was opened in St. Niklaus.

Of the rest of the land, 1.5% is settled (buildings or roads) and 67.2% is unproductive land. The municipality is located in the Visp district. It is the main settlement in the Matter valley (also called the Nikolai valley). It consists of the settlements of Riedmatten, Dorf, Stalu, Ze Schwidernu, Mattsand, Herbriggen, Breitmatten on the valley floor and the alpine settlement of Gasenried on the eastern slope. St Niklaus sits in the Mattertal, the steep valley that runs from Stalden to Zermatt, and is surrounded by some of the highest summits in the Alps, such as Dom and Weisshorn. There are several footpath nets for Alpine hikers leading up on the mountains and on the mountain huts. The closest hut is the Topali hut at the west side of the village. The Bordier hut at the east side can be accessed easily from St Niklaus. The highest mountain close to St Niklaus is Brunegghorn, reaching almost .

He is a 2006 recipient of the MacArthur Fellows Program. He lives and works in New York City. Early life and education McElheny grew up in Brookline, Massachusetts. While attending high school in the early 1980s, he was part of Boston's underground music scene, and worked as a sound engineer at Radiobeat Studios. He holds production credits on records by the Proletariat, Sorry, and Death Wish, recorded in 1983 and 1984. McElheny went on to receive his BFA from the Rhode Island School of Design in 1988. As part of that program, he trained under master glassblower Ronald Wilkins. After graduating, he was an apprentice to master glassblowers Jan-Erik Ritzman, Sven-Ake Caarlson and Lino Tagliapietra. Career In earlier works McElheny played with notions of history and fiction. Examples of this are works that recreate Renaissance glass objects pictured in Renaissance paintings and modern (but lost) glass objects from documentary photographs (such as works by Adolf Loos). He draws from a range of disciplines like architecture, physics, and literature, among others, and he works in a variety of media. McElheny has mentioned the influence of the writings of Jorge Luis Borges in his work. His work has also been influenced by the work of the American abstract artist Donald Judd. McElheny has also expressed interest in glassblowing as part of an oral tradition handed down generation to generation. He has used the infinity mirror visual effect in his explorations of apparently infinite space. His work also sometimes deals with issues of museological displays. One of the artist's ongoing projects is \\"An End to Modernity\\" (2005), commissioned by the Wexner Center for the Arts at Ohio State University. The piece is a twelve-foot-wide by ten-foot-high chandelier of chrome and transparent glass modeled on the 1960s Lobmeyr design for the chandeliers found in Lincoln Center, and evoking as well the Big Bang theory. \\"The End of the Dark Ages,\\" again inspired by the Metropolitan Opera House chandeliers and informed by logarithmic equations devised by the cosmologist David H. Weinberg was shown in New York City in 2008. Later that year, the series culminated in a massive installation titled \\"Island Universe\\" at White Cube in London\\"The Big Picture\\" by Alex Browne, The New York Times, September 26, 2008.

In a career that lasted from spring 1922 to October 1924, he ran eighteen times and nine races. He was a leading two-year-old in 1922 and, in the following year, he gained his most important success when he won The Derby. Later that season, he gained international attention when he was sent to New York for an unsuccessful match race against the Kentucky Derby winner Zev. This was the earliest example of a British horse being sent across the Atlantic for a single race. After running four times without winning, in 1924, he was retired to stud, where he had limited success until his death in 1941. Background Papyrus a medium-sized brown horse \\"of fine quality\\" with a white star, was bred by Sir John Robinson at the Worksop Manor Stud in Nottinghamshire. He was sired by the American-bred Tracery, a son of Rock Sand who was sent to Britain to race following the passing of the Hart‚ÄìAgnew Law and whose wins included the 1912 St Leger. He later became a highly successful sire, with his best runners, apart from Papyrus, including The Panther (2000 Guineas) and Transvaal (Grand Prix de Paris). Tracery was exported to Argentina but was returned to England following Papyrus's Derby victory. Papyrus's dam, Miss Matty, never won a race, but produced several other winners at stud. As a yearling, Papyrus was put up for auction at the Doncaster Sales, where he was sold for 3,500 guineas to the trainer Basil Jarvis on behalf of Benjamin Irish, a wealthy farmer. Irish was considered a \\"lucky\\" owner as he had great success despite owning very few racehorses. Jarvis trained the colt at Newmarket, Suffolk. Racing career 1922: two-year-old season Papyrus was quick to mature and won six of his eight races as a two-year-old in 1922. His two defeats came in the New Stakes at Royal Ascot when he was beaten four lengths by Lord Woolavington's Town Guard and the Champagne Stakes at Doncaster when he ran poorly behind Drake. In his final start of the season, he ran against Town Guard again in the Criterion Stakes at Newmarket. Lord Woolavington's colt had won his last six races and was regarded as the best two-year-old of the season, but Papyrus produced his best performance of the year to reverse the Ascot form and win decisively. Papyrus's win was considered a \\"fluke\\" by some observers, but he went into the winter break disputing favouritism for the following year's Derby with Town Guard. 1923: three-year-old season Papyrus began his three-year-old season in the 2000 Guineas at Newmarket on 2 May. Although he was short of peak fitness he ran creditably to finish fourth behind Ellangowan and retained his position as favourite for the Derby. Two weeks later he was sent to Chester Racecourse where he started even money favourite for the Chester Vase over the Derby distance of one and a half miles, and won \\"in a canter\\" by three lengths from Triumph. At Epsom, Papyrus started at odds of 100/15 (approximately 6.7/1) in a field of nineteen runners for the Derby, with Town Guard starting favourite at 5/1, the two colts having headed the betting lists since the previous autumn. On a cold, dull and misty day, which led to the race being dubbed the \\"overcoat Derby\\" the race attracted a crowd estimated at 250,000, with the Royal Family represented by the Prince of Wales. Ridden by Steve Donoghue, Papyrus took the lead on the turn into the straight. Two furlongs from the finish he was challenged and headed by Pharos, but responded well and showed good stamina to regain the advantage and win by a length after what was described as a \\"desperate and prolonged duel\\". Parth finished third after losing a great deal of ground at the start and Town Guard was unplaced. The win gave Donoghue a \\"hat-trick\\" of Derby wins, following Humorist in 1921 and Captain Cuttle in 1922. On 19 August, it was announced that Irish had accepted a challenge to run Papyrus against \\"the best American horse\\" for a prize of ¬£4,000. Later that month the American Jockey Club announced that the race would take place on 20 October and that the prize would be $100,000, with a consolation prize of $2,000 for the beaten horse. The Kentucky Derby winner Zev was eventually selected as the American representative on 6 October. Papyrus's first race after the Derby was the Duke of York Stakes at York on 28 August. He was beaten a short-head by the front-running Craigelyr, but was awarded the race after Donoghue lodged an objection against the winner on the grounds of \\"boring\\". Less than two weeks later Papyrus started favourite for the St Leger at Doncaster. He took the lead in the straight and got the better of a prolonged struggle with Parth, but was caught in the closing stages and beaten by Lord Derby's filly Tranquil. During the race Papyrus was \\"struck into\\" by another horse and returned bleeding freely from several cuts to his legs, one of which narrowly missed a tendon. Immediately after the St Leger, Papyrus was sent to the United States for his previously arranged match race with Zev. He was shipped by ocean vessel with his own special feed mix, his stablemate Bargold, his stable cat, two stable boys, his trainer, and his jockey, Steve Donoghue. Despite these special arrangements many British commentators felt that the race was futile, with the effects of the sea-voyage and the change in environment making Papyrus's task almost impossible. Racing on a dirt track for the first time and in heavy mud at Belmont Park, Papyrus lost by five lengths in front of a crowd of 70,000. He wore ordinary smooth racing plates, whereas his rival was equipped with specially adapted \\"mud caulks\\" to cope with the sloppy conditions. Terms of the match were to allow Zev to come upsides the Derby champion. Donoghue did, but Zev soon kicked on and Papyrus was unable to make any impression in the closing stages. Although stating that Papyrus had failed to cope with the conditions, Jarvis acknowledged that he had been fairly beaten by a better horse. At the end of the season, Irish sold Papyrus for ¬£35,000 to John Hornung. 1924: four- year-old season Papyrus stayed in training at four, but failed to win a race in four attempts, leading one observer to claim that he was \\"not half the horse he was\\". although he did put up good performances in defeat. On his first appearance, he was beaten by Poisoned Arrow in a race over one and a half miles. At Royal Ascot he looked fit in the paddock before the two and a half mile Gold Cup but finished unplaced behind the French-trained winner Massine. In the Eclipse Stakes on 18 July, he finished second, two lengths behind the three-year-old Polyphontes and three lengths clear of the other six starters. It was expected that Papyrus would be retired after this race, but he returned for a final appearance at Newmarket in autumn. On 2 October, he ran second, by half a length, to the filly Teresina in Jockey Club Stakes, with Parth in third. Stud record Papyrus was retired to his owner's West Grinstead Stud at Horsham, Sussex, where he stood at an initial fee of 300 guineas. He sired some good winners but was not a great success. Hornung later turned down an offer for Papyrus from the Polish Jockey Club and, on his death in 1940, left the horse to Basil Jarvis in his will. Papyrus died in his box in early November 1941. Papyrus sired Osiris, who won several stakes races in England, then stood at stud in Canada, where he was the Leading sire in 1938, 1940, 1942, and 1947. As well, Papyrus was the damsire of Princequillo who in turned sired a number of important Thoroughbreds and was the grandsire of Secretariat and Sham. Other descendants of Papyrus include Shergar. He is also a progenitor of Zenyatta, through Princequillo.

Legend says that the poet‚Äîalso renowned as a sorcerer‚Äîcalled the tunnel into existence by his powers. The tunnel was probably the work of Lucius Cocceus Auctus, the Roman engineer who built the nearby Seiano Grotto and many of the fortifications of the Roman Imperial Port in Baia.

They lived from the Early Jurassic to latest Cretaceous.Inoceramus at Fossilworks.orgWard et al., \\"Ammonite and inoceramid bivalve extinction patterns in Cretaceous/Tertiary boundary sections of the Biscay region (southwestern France, northern Spain)\\", Geology, 1991  Taxonomy  The taxonomy of the inoceramids is disputed, with genera such as Platyceramus sometimes classified as subgenus within Inoceramus. Also the number of valid species in this genus is disputed.  Description  Inoceramids had a thick shell paved with \\"prisms\\" of calcite deposited perpendicular to the surface, which gave it a pearly luster in life. Most species have prominent growth lines which appear as raised semicircles concentric to the growing edge of the shell. Paleontologists suggest that the giant size of some species was an adaptation for life in the murky bottom waters, with a correspondingly large gill area that would have allowed the animal to survive in oxygen-deficient waters.

At the northeast end of the loch is the hamlet of Kinloch Laggan. The loch was surveyed on 2 and 3 of June 1902 by Sir John Murray, T.R.N. Johnston, James Parsons and James Murray and was later charted as part of the Bathymetrical Survey of Fresh-Water Lochs of Scotland 1897-1909. The A86 road from Spean Bridge to Kingussie follows the loch's north shore. The River Pattack flows into the head of the loch just below the road bridge at Kinloch Laggan. The boundary of the Cairngorms National Park wraps around the head of the loch. A short section of the River Spean connects the natural loch with the reservoir downstream and this river continues westwards below Laggan Dam. Two other substantial watercourses empty into the loch, the Allt Labhrach which drains Lochan na h-Earba which lies southeast of Loch Laggan and Allt Coire Ardair which rises beneath Creag Meagaidh.

The story was inspired by a legend of ghostly black dogs in Dartmoor. A black dog is a motifhttps://scholar.uwindsor.ca/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1003&context;=gljuh of a spectral or demonic entity found primarily in the folklore of the British Isles. The black dog is essentially a nocturnal apparition, in some cases a shapeshifter, and is often said to be associated with the Devil or described as a ghost or super natural hellhound. Its appearance was regarded as a portent of death. It is generally supposed to be larger than a normal dog and often has large glowing eyes.Simpson & Roud 2000, 2003, p.25. It is sometimes associated with electrical storms (such as Black Shuck's appearance at Bungay, Suffolk)Westwood & Simpson 2005, pp.687‚Äì88. and also with crossroads, places of execution and ancient pathways.Stone, Alby Infernal Watchdogs, Soul Hunters and Corpse Eaters in Trubshaw 2005, pp.36‚Äì37.McEwan 1986, p.147. The origins of the black dog are difficult to discern. It is uncertain whether the creature originated in the Celtic or Germanic elements of British culture. Throughout European mythology, dogs have been associated with death. Examples of this are the (Welsh),Stone, Alby Infernal Watchdogs, Soul Hunters and Corpse Eaters in Trubshaw 2005, p.53. (Norse)Stone, Alby Infernal Watchdogs, Soul Hunters and Corpse Eaters in Trubshaw 2005, pp.44‚Äì45. and Cerberus (Greek),Stone, Alby Infernal Watchdogs, Soul Hunters and Corpse Eaters in Trubshaw 2005, p.38. all of whom were in some way guardians of the Underworld. This association seems to be due to the scavenging habits of dogs.Stone, Alby Infernal Watchdogs, Soul Hunters and Corpse Eaters in Trubshaw 2005, pp.54‚Äì55. It is possible that the black dog is a survival of these beliefs. Black dogs are generally regarded as sinister or malevolent, and a few (such as the Barghest and Shuck) are said to be directly harmful. They may also serve as familiar spirits for witches and warlocks.Briggs 1977, pp. 135‚Äì40. Some black dogs, however, such as the Gurt Dog in SomersetRickard & Michell 2000, pp. 286‚Äì7. and the Black Dog of the Hanging Hills in Connecticut, are said to behave benevolently. Some, known as guardian black dogs, guide travellers at night onto the right path or guard them from danger.Briggs 1976, pp. 207‚Äì8. By locale Some of the better-known black dogs are the Barghest of Yorkshire and Black Shuck of East Anglia. Various other forms are recorded in folklore in Britain and elsewhere.

When he died in 1677, black hounds are said to have appeared around his burial chamber.

Paranormal societies have investigated the phenomenon, particularly in the 1970s.[http://ukwildman.blogspot.com/2015/11/englands-black-dog-legends.html =Barghest= A Barghest (or Barguest) is said to roam the Snickelways and side roads of York, preying on passersby, and has also been seen near Clifford's Tower. To see the monstrous dog is said to be a warning of impending doom. =Black Dog of Aylesbury= A man who lived in a village near Aylesbury in Buckinghamshire would go each morning and night to milk his cows in a distant field. One night on his way there he encountered a sinister black dog, and every night thereafter until he brought a friend along with him. When the dog appeared again he attacked it using the yoke of his milk pails as a weapon, but when he did so the dog vanished and the man fell senseless to the ground. He was carried home alive but remained speechless and paralytic for the rest of his life.Hartland 1906, pp. 235‚Äì6. =Black Dog of Lyme Regis= Near the town of Lyme Regis in Dorset stood a farmhouse that was haunted by a black dog. This dog never caused any harm, but one night the master of the house in a drunken rage tried to attack it with an iron poker. The dog fled to the attic where it leaped out through the ceiling, and when the master struck the spot where the dog vanished he discovered a hidden cache of gold and silver. The dog was never again seen indoors, but to this day it continues to haunt at midnight a lane which leads to the house called Haye Lane (or Dog Lane). Dogs who are allowed to stray in this area late at night have often mysteriously disappeared.Hartland 1906, pp. 238‚Äì41.Udal 1922, pp. 167‚Äì8.Briggs 1977, pp. 138‚Äì40. A bed and breakfast in Lyme Regis is named The Old Black Dog, and part of the legend states that the man who discovered the treasure used it to build an inn that originally stood on the site.The Old Black Dog \\"The Black Dog Legend\\" =Black Dog of Newgate= The Black Dog of Newgate has been said to haunt the Newgate Prison for over 400 years, appearing before executions. According to legend, in 1596 a scholar was sent to the prison for witchcraft, but was killed and eaten by starving prisoners before he was given a trial. The dog was said to appear soon after, and although the terrified men killed their guards and escaped, the beast is said to have hunted them down and killed them wherever they fled.Clark 2007, pp. 86‚Äì87. Grim (or Fairy Grim) is the name of a shapeshifting fairy that sometimes took the form of a black dog in the 17th-century pamphlet The Mad Pranks and Merry Jests of Robin Goodfellow. He was also referred to as the Black Dog of Newgate, but though he enjoyed frightening people he never did any serious harm.Collier 1841, p. 43. =Black Dog of Northorpe= In the village of Northorpe in the West Lindsey district of Lincolnshire (not to be confused with Northorpe in the South Kesteven district) the churchyard was said to be haunted by a \\"Bargest\\". Some black dogs are said to be human beings with the power of shapeshifting. In another nearby village there lived an old man who was reputed to be a wizard. It was claimed that he would transform into a black dog and attack his neighbours' cattle. It is uncertain if there was any connection between the barghest and the wizard.Gutch and Peacock 1908, p. 54. =Black Dog of Tring= In the parish of Tring, Hertfordshire, a chimney sweep named Thomas Colley was executed by hanging in 1751 for the drowning murder of Ruth Osborne whom he accused of being a witch. Colley's spirit now haunts the site of the gibbet in the form of a black dog, and the clanking of his chains can also be heard.Hertfordshire's Last Witch Hunt Ch. 3.Gerish 1911 p. 11. In one tale a pair of men who encountered the dog saw a burst of flame before it appeared in front of them, big as a Newfoundland with the usual burning eyes and long sharp teeth. After a few minutes it disappeared, either vanishing like a shadow or sinking into the earth.Thiselton-Dyer 1893, pp. 106‚Äì8.Hartland 1906, p. 237.Briggs 1977, p. 137. =Black Shuck= In Norfolk, Suffolk and the northern parts of Essex, a black dog known as Black Shuck (also Old Shuck or Shock) is regarded as malevolent, with stories ranging from terrifying people (or killing them outright) to being a portent of death to themselves or a person close to the victim. There are tales that in 1577 it attacked the church in the market town of Bungay, killing two people and appearing on the same day at the church in the nearby village of Blythburgh, taking the lives of another three and leaving claw marks which remain today.\\"1577, August 4: Suffolk Black Dog\\" Anomalies.Rickard & Michell 2000, p. 287. In the parish of Overstrand is a dreary lane known as Shuck's Lane from its frequent appearances there. If the spot where it was just seen is examined then one may find scorch marks and the smell of brimstone.Hartland 1906, pp. 237‚Äì8. There are also less common tales of a similar dog said to accompany people on their way home in the role of protector rather than an omen of misfortune.\\"The Tollesbury Midwife\\" Shuckland. Among other possible meanings, the name Shuck is derived from a provincial word meaning shaggy. =Capelthwaite= In Westmorland and adjacent parts of Yorkshire there was a belief in Capelthwaite, who could take the form of any quadruped but usually appeared as a large black dog. He took his name from the barn in which he lived called Capelthwaite Barn, near Milnthorpe. He performed helpful services for the people on the farm such as rounding up the sheep, but toward outsiders he was very spiteful and mischievous until one day he was banished by a vicar.Henderson 1879, pp. 275‚Äì6. As both a helper and a trickster the Capelthwaite behaved more like a domestic hobgoblin than a typical black dog.Briggs 1976, p. 223 (\\"Hobgoblin\\"). =Church Grim= Church Grim The Church Grim guards a local Christian church and its attached churchyard from those who would profane them including thieves, vandals, witches, and warlocks. For this purpose it was the custom to bury a dog alive under the cornerstone of a church as a foundation sacrifice. Sometimes the grim will toll the bells at midnight before a death occurs. At funerals the presiding clergyman may see the dog looking out from the churchtower and determine from its \\"aspect\\" whether the soul of the departed was bound for Heaven or Hell. Another tradition states that when a new churchyard was opened the first man buried there had to guard it against the Devil. To save a human soul from such a duty a black dog was buried in the north part of the churchyard as a substitute.Henderson 1879, p. 274.Wright 1913, p. 194.Briggs 1976, pp. 74‚Äì5. =Freybug= Freybug is the name of an alleged Black Dog. =Gabriel Hounds= Gabriel Hounds are dogs with human heads that fly high through the air, and are often heard but seldom seen. They sometimes hover over a house, and this is taken as a sign that death or misfortune will befall those who dwell within. They are also known as Gabriel Ratchets (ratchet being a hound that hunts by scent), Gabble Retchets, and \\"sky yelpers\\", and like Yeth Hounds they are sometimes said to be the souls of unbaptised children. Popular conceptions of the Gabriel Hounds may have been partially based on migrating flocks of wild geese when they fly at night with loud honking. In other traditions their leader Gabriel is condemned to follow his hounds at night for the sin of having hunted on Sunday (much like the Cornish Dando), and their yelping cry is regarded as a death omen similar to the birds of folklore known as the Seven Whistlers.Hardwick 1872, pp. 153‚Äì4.Henderson 1879, pp. 129‚Äì32.Wright 1913, p. 195‚Äì7. =Guardian Black Dogs= Guardian Black Dogs refer to those relatively rare black dogs that are neither omens of death nor causes of it. Instead they guide lost travellers and protect them from danger. Stories of this type became more widespread starting around the early 1900s. In different versions of one popular tale a man was journeying along a lonely forest road at night when a large black dog appeared at his side and remained there until the man left the forest. On his return journey through the wood the dog reappeared and did the same as before. Years later two convicted prisoners told the chaplain that they would have robbed and murdered the wayfarer in the forest that night but were intimidated by the presence of the black dog. =Gurt Dog= The Gurt Dog (\\"Great Dog\\") of Somerset is an example of a benevolent dog. It is said that mothers would allow their children to play unsupervised on the Quantock Hills because they believed the Gurt Dog would protect them. It would also accompany lone travellers in the area, acting as a protector and guide. =Gytrash= The Gytrash (or Guytrash) is a black dog and death omen of Northern England that haunts solitary ways and also takes the form of a horse, mule and cow. It was popularised in folklore by its mention in the novel Jane Eyre by Charlotte Bront√´.Wood, Juliette. \\"The Gytrash\\" =Hairy Jack= There are many tales of ghostly black dogs in Lincolnshire collected by Ethel Rudkin for her 1938 publication Folklore. Such a creature, known locally as Hairy Jack, is said to haunt the fields and village lanes around Hemswell, and there have been reported sightings throughout the county from Brigg to Spalding. Rudkin, who claimed to have seen Hairy Jack herself, formed the impression that black dogs in Lincolnshire were mainly of a gentle nature, and looked upon as a spiritual protector.Codd, Daniel. Haunted Lincolnshire. Tempus Publishing Ltd (2006) pp. 75‚Äì78. Hairy Jack was also said to haunt lonely plantations, byways, and waste places where it attacked anyone passing by.Gutch and Peacock 1908, p. 53. =Padfoot= In Wakefield, Leeds, Pudsey and some areas of Bradford the local version of the legend is known as Padfoot. A death omen like others of its type, it may become visible or invisible and exhibits certain characteristics that give it its name. It is known to follow people with a light padding sound of its paws, then appearing again in front of them or at their side. It can utter a roar unlike the voice of any known animal, and sometimes the trailing of a chain can be heard along with the pad of its feet.Henderson 1879, pp. 273‚Äì4. It is best to leave the creature alone, for if a person tries to speak to or attacks it then it will have power over them. One story tells of a man who tried to kick the Padfoot and found himself dragged by it through hedge and ditch all the way to his home and left under his own window. Although usually described as black, another tale concerns a man who encountered a white Padfoot. He attempted to strike it with his stick but it passed completely through, and he ran home in fear. Soon afterward he fell sick and died. =Skriker and Trash= The Skriker (or Shrieker) of Lancashire and Yorkshire is a death omen like many others of its type, but it also wanders invisibly in the woods at night uttering loud, piercing shrieks. It may also take visible form as a large black dog with enormous paws that make a splashing sound when walking, like \\"old shoes walking in soft mud\\". For this reason the Skriker is also known as Trash, another word for trudge or slog.Wright 1913, pp. 194‚Äì5.Harland and Wilkinson 1867, pp. 91‚Äì2. The name Skriker is also derived from a dialect word for screech in reference to its frightful utterances.Hartland 1906, p. 238. =Yeth Hound and Wisht Hounds= The Yeth Hound (or Yell Hound) is a black dog found in Devon folklore. According to Brewer's Dictionary of Phrase and Fable, the Yeth Hound is a headless dog, said to be the spirit of an unbaptised child, that rambles through the woods at night making wailing noises. It is also mentioned in the Denham Tracts, a 19th-century collection of folklore by Michael Denham. It may have been one inspiration for the ghost dog in The Hound of the Baskervilles by Sir Arthur Conan Doyle, described as \\"an enormous coal-black hound, but not such a hound as mortal eyes have ever seen\\" - with fire in his eyes and breath (Hausman 1997:47).Brewer. Hausemen & Hausemen 1997. The Wisht or Wish Hounds (wisht is a dialect word for \\"ghostly\\" or \\"haunted\\") are a related phenomenon and some folklorists regard them as identical to the Yeth Hounds.Hunt 1865, p. 150.Briggs 1976, p. 440. Wistman's Wood on Dartmoor in southern Devon is said to be the home of the Wisht Hounds as they make their hunting forays across the moor.Hunt 1865, Introduction p. xix. The road known as the Abbot's Way and the valley of the Dewerstone are favoured haunts of the hounds. Their huntsman is presumably the Devil, and it is said that any dog that hears the crying of the hounds will die. One legend states that the ghost of Sir Francis Drake sometimes drove a black hearse coach on the road between Tavistock and Plymouth at night, drawn by headless horses and accompanied by demons and a pack of headless yelping hounds.Hunt 1865, p. 260. Charles Hardwick notes that black coach legends are \\"relatively modernised versions\\" of Wild Hunt and Furious Host traditions.Hardwick 1872, p. 192. Robert Hunt further defines whish or whisht as \\"a common term for that weird sorrow which is associated with mysterious causes\\". Cornwall * A black dog is said to have appeared to wrestlers at Whiteborough, a tumulus near Launceston.Deane & Shaw 2003, p. 82. * A black dog was once said to haunt the main road between Bodmin and Launceston near Linkinhorne.Deane & Shaw 2003, p. 44; also Semmens, Jason.

It is uncertain how he or the dogs died, but on \\"Cheney Downs\\" the dogs are sometimes seen or heard in rough weather.Hunt 1865, p. 151. * The area around St Germans is haunted by a pack of hunting dogs known as Dando's Dogs. Dando was an unrepentantly sinful priest and an avid huntsman who was carried off to Hell by the Devil for his wickedness. Since then, Dando and his hounds are sometimes heard in wild chase across the countryside, especially on Sunday mornings.Hunt 1865, pp. 247‚Äì51. * The Devil's Dandy Dogs are another Cornish version of the Wild Hunt. They are often conflated with Dando's Dogs but are much more dangerous. The huntsman is the Devil himself and his dogs are not just ghosts but true hellhounds, black in colour with horns and fiery breath. One night a herdsman was journeying home across the moors and would have been overtaken by the Dandy Dogs, but when he knelt and began praying they went off in another direction in pursuit of other prey.Hunt 1865, pp. 251‚Äì2.Hartland 1906, p. 244. Scotland *The \\"Muckle Black Tyke\\" is a black dog that presides at the Witches' Sabbath and is supposed to be the Devil himself. *Scottish black dogs also serve as treasure guardians. Near the village of Murthly is a standing stone, and it is said that the person brave enough to move it will find a chest guarded by a black dog. Wales * In Wales the black dog counterpart was the ' or \\"Dog of Darkness\\", a frightful apparition of a mastiff with baleful breath and blazing red eyes. Also related are the spectral ', connected with the otherworld realm of referred to in the Four Branches of the Mabinogi and elsewhere. However, they are described as being dazzling white rather than black in the medieval text.Gantz 1976, pp. 46‚Äì47.Pugh 1990, pp. 19, 67 * Another ghostly black dog is said to haunt St Donat's Castle, with some witnesses claiming it to have been accompanied by a hag. Channel Islands and Isle of Man *In the Isle of Man is the legend of the ', 'black dog' in Manx, also styled phonetically or . It is said to haunt the environs of Peel Castle.Evans-Wentz 1966, 1990, p. 129. People believe that anyone who sees the dog will die soon after the encounter with the dog. It is mentioned by Sir Walter Scott in The Lay of the Last Minstrel: :: For he was speechless, ghastly, wan :: Like him of whom the Story ran :: Who spoke the spectre hound in Man. * Also from the Isle of Man is a tale of a guardian black dog that prevented the deaths of several men. A fishing boat was waiting in Peel Harbour for its skipper to command the crew on a night's fishing. They waited all night but the skipper never came. In the early morning a sudden storm sprang up in which the boat might have been lost. When the skipper rejoined his crew he told them that his way had been blocked by a great black dog, and whichever way he turned it always stood before him until he finally turned back.Briggs 1976, p. 301. * In the Channel Island of Guernsey, there are two named dogs. One, ' (' two Norman words for dog, whence cur), is headless, and is supposed to be the phantom of a past Bailiff of Guernsey, , who was hanged for falsely accusing one of his vassals. The other dog is known as ' or ' (' being dog in '). His appearance, usually in the , foretells death of the viewer or someone close to him. There are also numerous other unnamed apparitions, usually associated with placenames derived from ' (beast).de Garis, Marie (1986) Folklore of Guernsey, The Guernsey Press, ASIN B0000EE6P8 * In Jersey folklore, the Black Dog of Death is also called the ', but a related belief in the ' (Black Dog of Bouley) tells of a phantom dog whose appearance presages storms.Bord & Bord 1980, 1981, p. 95. The real reason for the superstition of the Black Dog of Bouley Bay is thought to be due to smugglers. If the superstition was fed and became 'real' to the locals, then the bay at night would be deserted and the smuggling could continue in security. The pier at Bouley Bay made this an exceptionally easy task. A local pub retains the name the \\"Black Dog\\".Jersey Maritime Museum for references to the folklore of the Black Dog * On mainland Normandy the ' wanders the streets of Bayeux on winter nights as a phantom dog, gnawing on bones and dragging chains along with it.Wright 1846, p. 128. Mainland Europe ' (\\"Old Red Eyes\\") or the \\"Beast of Flanders\\" was a spirit reported in Flanders, Belgium in the 18th century who would take the form of a large black dog with fiery red eyes. In Wallonia, the southern region of Belgium, folktales mentioned the ' (\\"Chained Hound\\" in Walloon), a hellish dog bound with a long chain, that was thought to roam in the fields at night.Warsage, Rodolphe de Sorcellerie et Cultes Populaires en Wallonie, Noir Dessein, 1998. In Germany and the Czech lands it was said that the devil would appear in the form of a large black dog.Varner, Gary R. Creatures in the mist: little people, wild men and spirit beings around the world : a study in comparative mythology in Algora Publishing 2007, pp. 114‚Äì15. The earliest known report of a black dog was in France in AD 856, when one was said to materialise in a church even though the doors were shut. The church grew dark as it padded up and down the aisle, as if looking for someone. The dog then vanished as suddenly as it had appeared.McNab, Chris \\"Mythical Monsters: The scariest creatures from legends, books, and movies\\" in Scholastic Publishing 2006, pp. 8-9. In Lower Brittany there are stories of a ghost ship crewed by the souls of criminals with hellhounds set to guard them and inflict on them a thousand tortures.Thiselton-Dyer 1893, p. 289. the Americas Latin America Black dogs with fiery eyes are reported throughout Latin America from Mexico to Argentina under a variety of names including the Perro Negro (Spanish for black dog), Nahual (Mexico), Huay Chivo and Huay Pek (Mexico) - alternatively spelled Uay/Way/Waay Chivo/Pek, Cadejo (Central America), the dog Familiar (Argentina) and the Lobizon (Paraguay and Argentina). They are usually said to be either incarnations of the Devil or a shape-changing sorcerer.Burchell 2007, pp. 1, 24. United States The legend of a small black dog has persisted in Meriden, Connecticut since the 19th century. The dog is said to haunt the Hanging Hills: a series of rock ridges and gorges that serve as a popular recreation area. The first non-local account came from W. H. C. Pychon in The Connecticut Quarterly, in which it is described as a death omen. It is said that, \\"If you meet the Black Dog once, it shall be for joy; if twice, it shall be for sorrow; and the third time shall bring death.\\" A New England black dog tale comes from southeastern Massachusetts in the area known, by some, as the Bridgewater Triangle. In the mid-1970s, the town of Abington was, reportedly, terrorized by a large, black dog that caused a panic. A local fireman saw it attacking horses. Local police unsuccessfully searched for it, at first they didn't see the black dog. But eventually, a police officer sighted the dog walking along train tracks and shot at it. Apparently, the bullets had no effect on the animal and it walked off, never to be seen again. Asia India The MahƒÅkanha JƒÅtaka of the Buddhist Pali Canon includes a story about a black dog named MahƒÅkanha (Pali; lit. \\"Great black\\"). Led by the god ≈öakra in the guise of a forester, MahƒÅkanha scares unrighteous people toward righteousness so that fewer people will be reborn in hell. His appearance portends the moral degeneration of the human world, when monks and nuns do not behave as they should and humanity has gone astray from ethical livelihood. Arabia Jinn, although not necessarily evil, but often thought of as malevolent entities, are thought to use black dogs as their mounts. The negative depiction of dogs probably derives from their close association with \\"eating the dead\\" (relieshing bones) and digging out graves. The jinn likewise are often said to roam around graveyards and eating corpses. These characteristics relates them to each other.Amira El Zein: The Evolution of the Concept of Jinn from Pre-Islam to Islam'. p. 264 Other colours England * The Gallytrot (or Galleytrot) of Northern England and Suffolk is a large white dog with a shadowy or indeterminate outline, and will chase anyone who runs away from it. The word is derived from gally, to frighten.Briggs 1976, p. 183. Scotland * The of the Scottish Highlands is dark green in colour and the size of a stirk (a yearling calf). They were usually kept tied up in the brugh (fairy mound) as watchdogs, but sometimes they accompanied the women during their expeditions or were allowed to roam about alone, making their lairs among the rocks. They moved silently, had large paws the size of adult human hands, and had a loud baying sound that could be heard far out at sea. It is said that anyone who heard them bark three times was overcome with terror and died of fear.Campbell 1900, pp. 30‚Äì32. Isle of Man * The dogs belonging to the ferrishyn or Manx fairies can be found in a wide variety of colours. They are sometimes described as white with red ears (or wearing red caps)Gill 1932 Ch. 6 Sec. 2. or may be found in all colours of the rainbow.Morrison 1911, p. 29. In popular culture The legend has been referenced many times in popular culture. One of the most famous ghostly black dogs in fiction appears in Sir Arthur Conan Doyle's The Hound of the Baskervilles, where a large dog-like creature haunts a family estate. Sherlock Holmes is brought in to determine if the dog is in fact real or supernatural. This story makes use of folktales where black dogs symbolize death. Another famous ghostly black dog may be found in J.K. Rowling's Harry Potter series: the \\"Grim\\", a \\"giant, spectral dog that haunts churchyards\\" is \\"the worst omen of death\\" according to Harry Potter's divination teacher, Professor Trelawney. Another reference to the legend can be found in the same book, Harry Potter & the Prisoner of Azkaban, Padfoot being the nickname of Sirius Black, an animagus who can turn into a large black dog and mistaken as the Grim by Harry.

He created The Nature of Things for CBC Television in 1960, which remains one of the longest running and most successful programs in Canada, and was a member of the executive team which oversaw the establishment of the Ontario Science Centre. Crowdis was also one of the last living survivors of the Halifax Explosion. Life and career Born in Halifax, Nova Scotia, he received degrees in science, arts and education from Dalhousie University. He later studied education administration at Columbia University and museum studies at the Buffalo Museum of Science on a Carnegie fellowship.Obituary, Globe and Mail, 13 December, 2011 He worked initially as a school teacher, rising to a school administrator, before transitioning to museum administration. Museum administration In 1940, he succeeded the Harry Piers as curator and director of the Nova Scotia Museum. He served at the museum for 25 years, focusing on the growth of its science collections until his departure in 1965. Notable initiatives included the creation of the first public planetarium in Canada, and live exhibits aimed at attracting children, including the development of innovative fish tanks which would come to be emulated elsewhere by public aquariums. Among the live exhibits he introduced was a 20-year-old gopher tortoise, purchased in 1942. The tortoise still thrives in 2019 as one of the museum's most popular attractions. His role transitioned from that of curator to director as he hired several specialist curators in various sciences. In 1947, he was a founding member and later President of the Canadian Museums Association. While still with the museum, Crowdis accepted an invitation to spearhead efforts to establish a permanent library for Halifax.Crowdis, Donald K., (1946) \\"Brief History of Agitation for the Halifax Memorial Library\\" This eventually resulted in the construction of the Halifax Memorial Library, designed by Leslie Fairn and completed in 1951.LoLordo, M.W.

As Canada was preparing for its centennial year, federal matching funds were made available to provincial and municipal governments to undertake significant public projects (see Canadian Centennial). Frustrated that the Nova Scotia Museum was overlooked for such funding in favor of a competing initiative, Crowdis moved to Toronto in 1965. There he became a member of the executive team which oversaw the establishment of the ‚ÄúCentennial Centre of Science and Technology‚Äù which would come to be known as the Ontario Science Centre. He afterwards worked for the Ontario Education Communications Authority. He consulted in later years. Broadcasting As part of his outreach efforts with the Nova Scotia museum, Crowdis embraced the medium of radio, appearing on local radio programs in Halifax for more than two decades. One of his shows was called \\"Things of Nature\\".Discovery Centre Interview, 2008 When it transitioned to television, he adapted the name as The Nature of Things He was an early host of the popular CBC television series, which continues to air new episodes as The Nature of Things with David Suzuki.

Visible is a US Standard Light Rail Vehicle that was originally proposed to be used on the Manchester Metrolink network Derby Litchurch Lane Works (formerly Derby Carriage and Wagon Works) was built by the Midland Railway in Derby, England, in the 19th century. The plant has produced rolling stock under the ownership of the Midland Railway, the LMS, British Railways, British Rail Engineering Limited (BREL), ABB, Adtranz and Bombardier Transportation. History Midland Railway (1876‚Äì1923) Annual dinner of the Institution of Mechanical Engineers held in the carriage works of the Midland Railway at Derby in 1898. Samuel Johnson, the railway's Chief Mechanical Engineer was the institution president. Railway building began at Derby Works in 1840, when the North Midland Railway, the Midland Counties Railway and the Birmingham and Derby Railway set up engine sheds as part of their Tri Junct Station. When the three merged in 1844 to form the Midland Railway its first Locomotive and Carriage Superintendent Matthew Kirtley set out to organise their activities and persuaded the directors to build their own rolling stock, rather than buying it in (see Derby Works). By the 1860s the works had expanded to such an extent that he was considering reorganising it and, in 1873, it separated into the Midland Railway Locomotive Works, known locally as \\"The Loco\\", and a new Carriage and Wagon Works further south, off Litchurch Lane, locally known as the \\"Carriage and Wagon\\". This was completed by his successor Samuel Waite Johnson, under the control of Thomas Gethin ClaytonBillson, P., (1996) Derby and the Midland Railway, Breedon Books The Derby Carriage and Wagon works were built in 1876. The carriages of the time were generally less than 50 feet long but, possibly because the Midland had just taken delivery of its first Pullman car 56 feet 5 inches long, Clayton had the foresight to design the works to deal with vehicles up to 70 feet. This meant, for instance, that the traversers at the end of each shed were still in use a century later. Production had begun in 1873 (at the original loco works) of carriages from kits supplied by the Pullman Company of Detroit in United States. These were followed by Clayton's own design of coaches, which incorporated both first- and third-class accommodation, and ran on four- or six-wheeled bogies.Vaughan, A., (1997) Railwaymen, Politics and Money, London: John Murray Initially claret or dark red, with dark green locomotives, the livery of both was changed to the well-known crimson in 1883. Five layers of undercoat were used, followed by a top coat and three coats of varnish. A six-wheeled coach built in 1885 is in the National Railway Museum. In 1879 the first bogie coaches were built for the Midland's line to Glasgow over its newly opened Settle-Carlisle line. Clayton's successor in 1903 was David Bain., the works building sleeping cars and dining coaches. In 1904 two steam motor-carriages were fitted out for the Morecambe-Heysham service. Ten- and twelve-ton wagons were produced in quantity, starting with a set of components in the morning, each would be assembled for painting by the end of the day. Reid and E.J.H.Lemon studied American mass production methods and introduced them around 1919, raising output to 200 wagons and 10 coaches a week. The sawmill was recognised as the most modern and largest in Europe, with over 2000 miles of timber being seasoned, of nearly sixty different varieties, from pine to lignum vitae. In 1914 the works turned to producing supplies for the army of World War I, building ambulance trains and army wagons, plus parts for rifles. London, Midland and Scottish Railway (1923-1948) In 1923 the Midland Railway became part of the London, Midland and Scottish Railway, and W. R. Reid was appointed Carriage & Wagon Superintendent. Together with the LNWR's Wolverton works, new coaches were built to the Midland design, corridor coaches with doors to each compartment - the so-called \\"all-doors\\". These were still in use until nearly 1960, particularly on the Liverpool and Newcastle to Bristol expresses. Around 1929 the compartment doors, however, were replaced by two fixed lights, and later with single large windows. All-wood construction gave way to steel panels. In the next decade the Works Superintendent, Ernest Pugson, realised the potential of the new technology of metallic arc welding, replacing many forged and cast components. He introduced the first composite welded steel/timber bodies with standardised jig-built components. The first open carriages, referred to as \\"vestibule coaches\\", also appeared. From 1933, roofs were of steel rather than wood, with a simplified livery and a smoother external appearance, and, at the end of the 1930s all-welded steel vehicles were built for the Liverpool and Southport electric service, the Class 502. During World War II, Derby pioneered aeroplane wing production methods, by 1945 having produced over 4,000. With the loco works, wings and fuselages were repaired and sent to a private contractor at Nottingham for assembly, initially of Hampden bombers but later of other aircraft including Lancasters. Although towards the end of the 'thirties a complete 'Coronation Scot' train was built for an exhibition tour in America and a streamlined all-welded three coach railcar, most of the all-steel carriages were made by outside manufacturers. After the war, the LMS began to produce its own, the so-called \\"porthole\\" stock with round windows to the lavatory compartment. After nationalisation in 1948, as the main carriage works of the London Midland Region, the first Mk I all-steel carriages were produced. British Railways and BREL (1948‚Äì1989) Preserved Derby Lightweight at Bewdley The prototype railbus LEV1 The works became the principal rolling stock works of the London Midland Region of British Railways at nationalisation in 1948; the steel British Railways Mark 1 carriage was developed in the 1950s, and at the beginning of the 1950s the works employed over 5,000 people. In 1953 the works began production of Derby Lightweight DMUs; units of aluminium construction. The use of glass fibre laminate was introduced for the roof ends. Trailer cars were also built for the London Transport Executive as replacements on the London Underground Piccadilly line. In 1956, all-steel DMUs, the \\"Derby Heavyweights\\" were introduced, with over a thousand being built in that decade. From 1958 the new Class 108 of Derby Lightweights was produced in quantity. A number of steel- bodied Class 107 DMUs were built in 1960 for lines in Scotland. In 1969 the works were transferred to new subsidiary British Rail Engineering Ltd and renamed Derby Litchurch Lane Works. Wagon building and repairs ended, with a major re-organisation of the carriage and railcar work, and in 1979 container production finished. In 1984, British Rail was under extreme financial pressure to close branch lines. At the same time a worldwide need was seen for a low-cost rail vehicle. The Research Division and British Leyland together produced a lightweight four-wheeled vehicle which they referred to as LEV-1. After proving trials, which included assessment on the Boston and Maine Railroad in America, it was developed into the Class 140 which led to a series of two-car Pacer units, and around 150 of various classes were built. Post- privatisation (1989‚Äìpresent) Class 170 Turbostar at Peterborough BREL was privatised in 1989 and became wholly owned by Asea Brown Boveri (ABB) in 1992, the works becoming part of Adtranz (1996), and in 2001 part of Bombardier Transportation. One of the first orders in 1993 was for Class 482 EMUs for the Waterloo and City Line. In 1995 a number of Class 325 parcels EMUs were built. However, this period was characterised by large contracts and rushes of work, interspersed with periods of relative idleness and layoffs. The works kept going by refurbishing ex-Southern Region slam-door stock. Gautrain EMU in South Africa In 1997 a contract was received to supply the new Class 168 \\"Clubman\\" DMU, which led to the various Turbostar DMUs and Electrostar EMUs, now the most widely used trains in Britain. In 2004, the plant was retained as part of Bombardier's manufacturing capacity in Europe after restructuring by the company led to closure of seven of its European facilities. The site had previously considered a possibility for closure, and had an order gap between the end of the Electrostar contract (for train operators SouthCentral and Southeastern) until 2008 when a major ¬£3.4 billion contract of over 1,700 carriages for Metronet was to begin. The order gap was bridged by an order for Electrostars for the Gautrain project in South Africa won in 2006; the first 15 vehicles were delivered complete, and the remaining 81 in kit form for assembly at Union Carriage & Wagon's plant in Nigel, South Africa. After the closure of Alstom's Washwood Heath plant in 2005, Bombardier's Derby plant was the only passenger rolling stock manufacturer in the UK. In 2009 Bombardier received a contract to build thirty Class 379 EMUs for National Express services including Stansted Express. By mid-2011, Derby had completed construction of EMUs for the 2009 Stock and Class 379 EMUs and was completing an order of Class 172 Turbostar DMUs. The plant had a large order of 1,400 S stock trains for London Underground which was completed in 2017. In 2011 Bombardier was expecting to lay off approximately 1,200 workers at the plant, irrespective of future orders, and the contract for the Thameslink Programme was seen by Bombardier's management as critical to the continued viability of the plant and related supply chain. After Siemens was named preferred bidder in June 2011 to construct the new rolling stock for Thameslink services through London, Bombardier announced it was to cut 1,400 out of the 3,000 jobs at Derby. Colin Walton, Chairman of Bombardier Transportation in the UK, said the loss of the contract had forced the company to review its UK operations.

Published on December 18, 1965, in the Saturday Evening Post, a few months after her death, it won the 1966 Edgar Allan Poe Award for best mystery short story. It has since been reprinted in the 1996 collection Just an Ordinary Day as well as \\"Elements of English 10\\" for high school students. While not as well-known or read as her 1948 classic, \\"The Lottery\\", it later became a set work in high school English classes. Plot Miss Adela Strangeworth is described prominently as a harmless old lady in the beginning of the story. Through conversations with the people in her town, it is evident that Miss Strangeworth often believes that she owns the town, and has great interest in the townspeople. She also takes great pride in the orderliness of her house, as well as her family roses. However, Miss Strangeworth is not such a quiet figure in her town; she often writes anonymous letters to her neighbors, which are rarely based on fact and more on what gossip she has heard during her walks down the streets. When she is mailing some of them, one is dropped on the ground and one of her neighbors (whom she had once made a subject of her uncouth letters) notices, and, feeling kind, delivers it to the intended recipient (unaware the letter is meant to be anonymous). The next morning, Miss Strangeworth receives a similarly written letter, informing her that her roses, a source of her familial pride, have been destroyed. The story examines many themes, such as a person being two-faced, as well as how a single person can make a mark on a community. Style As with The Lottery, many believed this to be fiction for precisely this reason. It also deals with the \\"casual cruelty in the everyday\\" that Jackson explores in almost all of her short stories. Themes This short story explores many themes, usually mentioned in Analysis, such as a person having two sides to them, the dents that people make upon a community, and how they restore them, and the revenge of the fallen. There is also a frequently commented upon debate on the symbolism of the roses. The most common metaphor is that the roses represent Strangeworth's impression on the rest of the community, how they all respect her. However, upon her discovery, her roses are tarnished. However, some argue that the roses represent the guilt that Strangeworth hides behind a much polished and examined display of non-knowing:They are sweetly fragrant and beautiful, but hide thorns. Critical reception Joyce Carol Oates described the story as 'terrifying' and it is generally regarded as one of Jackson's finest works. It was commented in an unrelated Daily Telegraph article that this was the point in which Shirley Jackson had reached maturity as an author, a process that began and continued long after the early & famous publication of Jackson's controversial short story, The Lottery. This is a common opinion that has also been voiced by many other admirers of Jackson such as Paul Theroux and Neil Gaiman. It has even been commented by some critics to be Shirley Jackson's masterpiece, and superior to The Lottery, We Have Always Lived in the Castle and The Haunting of Hill House. \\"The Possibility of Evil\\" was once put into an attempt for a movie adaptation, as has happened for The Haunting of Hill House and The Lottery, in which Miss Strangeworth uses her letters to murder those in the community that she believed were preventing it from brilliance. However, it has since been given up on, and many of the intended team for the movie have proceeded to follow other pursuits instead. However, though the majority of reviews have been indisputably positive, in an article in The Spectator on Jackson, the columnist referred to this being, though above average for her usual work, undeserving of the acclaim that it has gathered, that it gained success only through it being published soon after Jackson's death. Similarities to other Short Stories by Jackson The examples of somebody being two faced can be seen in numerous Jacksons, such as Trial by Combat, The Villager, The Witch, Charles, The Dummy, Of Course, and Got A Letter From Jimmy. The examples of dramatic irony can be found in Charles, Afternoon in Linen and Colloquy.

She is best remembered today for having created the role of the Plaintiff in Gilbert & Sullivan's first success, Trial by Jury, although she played in that piece for just over three months out of a successful career spanning nearly two decades. Life and early career Bromley was born on 30 September 1850 in London to an actress and singer, also Eleanor Bromley (1826‚Äì1860). The identity of her father is unknown. Her mother was born into the large family of John Charles Bromley (died 1839) and his wife Hannah n√©e Shailer. Her mother had begun acting while still a teenager, in 1843, appearing at many of the major West End theatres, especially at the Olympic Theatre. She continued to act until she died in childbirth in 1860. In 1857, she had married Charles Henry Cook. After her mother's death, Bromley and her younger sister, Jessy Cook, were raised by their grandmother Hannah.G√§nzl, Kurt. \\"Nellie Bromley, or, A breach of lots of promises\\", Kurt G√§nzl's blog, 3 June 2018 Nelly Bromley Bromley used her nickname \\"Nelly\\" as her stage name and, like her mother, began a stage career in her teens. By December 1866, she was acting at the Royalty Theatre in London, playing Dolly Mayflower in a burlesque by F. C. Burnand of Black-Eyed Susan. She remained in the company at the Royalty, acting in other burlesques, including W. S.

Although Bromley was a critical success in the part, she left the production in July 1875. \\"Trial by Jury Lancers\\", Charles d'Albert's dance arrangement of numbers from the piece, was dedicated to Bromley. She next played at the Criterion Theatre as Mrs Graham in The Great Divorce Case, an adaptation of Le Proc√®s Veradieux. Later in 1875 Bromley played the Princess of Granada in H. S.

Collection EYE Film Institute Netherlands. Willy Fritsch photographed by Alexander Binder, 1920s. Collection EYE Film Institute Netherlands. Willy Fritsch (27 January 1901 ‚Äì 13 July 1973) was a German theater and film actor, a popular leading man and character actor from the silent-film era to the early 1960s. Biography Early life He was born Wilhelm Egon Fritz Fritsch, the only son of a factory owner in Kattowitz (present-day Katowice) in the Prussian province of Silesia. After the bankruptcy of his father in 1912, the family moved to Berlin, where Fritsch sr. worked as an employee of the Siemens-Schuckert company. Young Willy originally planned an apprenticeship as a mechanic, but soon resorted to the occupation as an extra at the Gro√ües Schauspielhaus theatre. 1919‚Äì1932 From 1919 he attended Max Reinhardt's drama school at the Deutsches Theater, where he debuted with small roles and played as understudy at times side by side with Marlene Dietrich (i.e. Spring Awakening). He made his feature debut in films as a supporting player in 1920's Miss Venus and got his first important engagement in His Mysterious Adventure three years later. In 1925, Fritsch gained international attention by playing the leading character in the silent film A Waltz Dream directed by Ludwig Berger. Afterwards he was offered a United Artists contract but refused to move to the United States being concerned about his lack of English language knowledge. His career was pushed now through the Ufa film company by being set as a juvenile lover in silent comedies like Chaste Susanne (1926), The Last Waltz (1927), Hungarian Rhapsody (1928) or Her Dark Secret (1929) but Fritsch was also starring in two silent films directed by Fritz Lang: the thriller Spies (1928) and the sci-fi film Woman in the Moon (1929) where he played serious characters. Again, these films gained him international success. In 1929, he spoke the first sentence in a German talkie: \\"I'm saving money to buy a horse!\\" (Melodie des Herzens / Melody of the Heart, 1929)). Shortly after that, he was paired again with Lilian Harvey whom he had already played together twice during the mid-1920s. The joint musical love comedy Waltz of Love (1930) was such a huge success that its producer Erich Pommer decided to continue making films with the \\"perfect couple\\" Harvey/Fritsch. Thereupon, they appeared regularly together in UFA movies like The Three from the Filling Station (1930), Congress Dances by Erik Charell (1931) or A Blonde Dream (1932) but Fritsch was also playing in several movies at the side of K√§the von Nagy (i.e. in Billy Wilder's script debut Her Grace Commands, 1931 or I by Day, You by Night, 1932). He mainly starred in the German versions and was sometimes replaced by Henri Garat unless his movies were dubbed. In his musical comedies, Fritsch also turned out to be a good singer performing popular German film songs written by Werner Richard Heymann or Friedrich Holl√§nder. At the end of the Weimar era, he was one of the best paid actors in Germany causing large crowds of fans wherever he appeared. Even palm court music was composed for him: Ich bin in Willy Fritsch verliebt (I'm In Love With Willy Fritsch)Gert von Zitzewitz, Fritz Paul & Siegfried Schulz, ¬© 22.07.1931, Ufaton Berlin 19794 1933‚Äì1945 When Hitler came to power in 1933, Fritsch was able to continue his career in Germany. In the mid-1930s, he was the leading actor in highly successful comedies like Amphitryon (1935) directed by Reinhold Sch√ºnzel or Lucky Kids (1936, director Paul Martin), the latter a German adaption of Frank Capra's film It Happened One Night. By the end of the decade, he starred in two more comedies together with Lilian Harvey (Seven Slaps, 1937 and Woman At The Wheel, 1939) before Harvey emigrated to France. In 1940, Fritsch also played the leading role in the first German coloured motion picture Women Are Better Diplomats. Though he had joined the NSDAP due to the pressure being put on him, Fritsch tried to avoid getting involved in Nazi propaganda (except for his appearance in the 1944 aviator movie ' which earned him an entry on Goebbels' Gottbegnadeten list). Starring in Austrian originated comedies like Vienna Blood (1942) directed by Willi Forst or A Salzburg Comedy (1943) scripted by Erich K√§stner and partly even watched by the secret police (Gestapo) for his \\"lack of political reliability\\"Heike Goldbach: Ein Feuerwerk an Charme. Willy Fritsch, p. 293. despite of the party membership, he managed to survive the Hitler era without any loss of prestige. 1945‚Äì1964 After the war, he moved to Hamburg and continued to appear in movies like Film Without A Title (1948) together with Hildegard Knef as well as in several German blockbusters like The Heath Is Green (1951) or When the White Lilacs Bloom Again (1953) side by side with young Romy Schneider. In 1958, Fritsch starred in the German version of ', which was later adapted and filled with additional scenes by Francis Ford Coppola for his debut release of The Bellboy And The Playgirls (1962). Fritsch's final film was 1964's I Learned It from Father (Das hab' ich von Papa gelernt) directed by Axel von Ambesser, in which he performed together with his son Thomas. Personal life Fritsch was married to artistic dancer Dinah Grace in 1937 and became a father of two sons. The younger one, Thomas Fritsch, is a successful actor as well. Fritsch died of a heart attack aged 72 and was buried at Ohlsdorf Cemetery in Hamburg.

He is currently the manager of Swedish Football Division 3 side Assyriska IK. Tegstr√∂m is best known for playing with Norwegian Tippeligaen clubs Sandefjord and Fredrikstad. Tegstr√∂m wanted to become a professional ice hockey player while growing up, but he quit playing ice hockey and played football as an amateur for Tenhults IF and Husqvarna FF. He was brought to Sandefjord in 2005 and scored 14 goals in his first season; the club won promotion to Tippeligaen. In Sandefjord's first season in the top-flight, Tegstr√∂m scored ten goals in the league and played in the 2006 Norwegian Football Cup Final. The next season, he moved to Fredrikstad, where he was not a regular player on the first team. He spent time on loan with H√∏nefoss in 2009, and he returned to Sweden after the 2010 season when his contract with Fredrikstad expired. After two seasons with the Superettan side J√∂nk√∂pings S√∂dra, he rejoined Husqvarna FF before the 2013 season. Early life As a child, Tegstr√∂m dreamed of becoming a professional ice hockey player in the NHL and for the Swedish national ice hockey team, Tre kronor. He played for HV71, attended the hockey school in J√∂nk√∂ping, and played football as a hobby. After he quit playing hockey, he worked at the local Intersport store while playing football for Tenhults IF. He later joined Swedish Football Division 2 side Husqvarna FF. Club career Tegstr√∂m scored 22 goals in as many matches in 2004, and was named Player of the Year in the 2004 Swedish football Division 2. The same season, Husqvarna qualified for the promotion play-off where they met Superettan side Mj√§llby. This match was attended by scouts from the Norwegian First Division side Sandefjord Fotball. Even though the Sandefjord envoys came to watch Mj√§llby's Marcus Ekenberg, they were more impressed by Tegstr√∂mwho was playing as a striker. Tegstr√∂m was also wanted by Superettan sides Trelleborgs FF and √ñsters IF, but joined Sandefjord ahead of the 2005 season and signed a three-year contract with the club. Sandefjord Tegstr√∂m became an instant success at Sandefjord and contributed greatly to the club's first-ever promotion to the Tippeligaen, with a total of 14 goals when the club finished second in the 2005 Norwegian First Division. Tegstr√∂m scored a hat-trick in the decisive match, beating promotion-challengers Moss 4‚Äì2; Tegstr√∂m's teammate Andreas Augustsson scored one goal. Tegstr√∂m also impressed at the top-flight in Norway, and after scoring five goals in the five first matches of the season he was the leading goalscorer in Tippeligaen, while his team was in fourth place despite being predicted to be in last place by every media outlet in Norway. When Sandefjord played Viking on 24 September 2006, both teams were fighting against relegation and Tegstr√∂m scored the match-winning goal on a counter-attack after dribbling past half the Viking defencecomparable to Diego Maradona's goal in the 1986 World Cup. Tegstr√∂m scored ten goals and made five assists in the Tippeligaen, helping Sandefjord avoid relegation in their first year in the top-flight. He also scored the first goal in the semi-final of the 2006 Norwegian Football Cup, which Sandefjord won 5‚Äì2 against Rosenborg at Lerkendal Stadion and played in the 2006 Norwegian Football Cup Final, in which the team lost 3‚Äì0 to Fredrikstad. After his performance for Sandefjord in 2006, Expressen said that Tegstr√∂m was wanted by several Norwegian, Danish and Dutch clubs, but signed a new contract with Sandefjord in December 2006 to the end of the 2009 season. Verdens Gang predicted that the Sandefjord team would finish 11th in the 2007 Tippeligaen, but stated that Tegstr√∂m had to perform at the same level as in the previous season for Sandefjord to avoid relegation. Tegstr√∂m scored one goal for Sandefjord in the 2007 season; the team struggled throughout the season until it was relegated to the second tier. Tegstr√∂m left Sandefjord half-way through the season, when he was sold to Fredrikstad in August 2007 for 4 million Norwegian krone (NOK), according to Sandefjords Blad. Fredrikstad The same day his second child was born, Tegstr√∂m scored a goal in his debut for Fredrikstad, a 2‚Äì0 victory against Stab√¶k on 3 September 2007. He scored against Str√∏msgodset in October 2007. The following season, Tegstr√∂m played as a substitute and scored one goal in the 2‚Äì0 victory against Bod√∏/Glimt, with Fredrikstad leading the 2008 Tippeligaen after four matches. Tegstr√∂m did not play much for Fredrikstad in the 2008 season because Tarik Elyounoussi and Gar√∞ar J√≥hannsson were the preferred strikers in the starting lineup. Tegstr√∂m secured the club's first silver medals since 1972 when he scored two goals against Molde on 26 October 2008; he came on as a substitute in the 63rd minute of the match, which Fredrikstad won 2‚Äì1. Before the 2009 season, Fredrikstad told Tegstr√∂m that he was not part of the club's long-term plans and that he was welcome to find another club. Fredrikstad turned down an offer from Stab√¶k to buy the striker. He did not start a single match in the pre-season, but he came on as a substitute and scored a goal against Str√∏msgodset in the second match of the 2009 season. Tegstr√∂m spent most of the 2009 season on the bench, but in the 2009 Norwegian Football Cup tie against Ranheim, he came on as a substitute and scored two goals in the extra time. Later career In August 2009, he was loaned out to the First Division side H√∏nefoss until the end of the season, with an option to buy. In his first match for H√∏nefoss, Tegstr√∂m scored a goal against Alta; the game ended with a 2‚Äì0 victory. He scored a four goals in 12 matches for H√∏nefoss. After the season, he returned to Fredrikstad, which had been relegated to the First Division. He was troubled by injuries in his last season with Fredrikstad, and he started only nine matches. J√∂nk√∂pings S√∂dra wanted to buy Tegstr√∂m during the summer, but he did not join the club until his contract with Fredrikstad expired after the 2010 season. After playing two seasons for the Superettan side, Tegstr√∂m returned to Husqvarna ahead of the 2013 season, where in addition to playing for the team, he was hired as chief of marketing. Managerial career In December 2015, Tegstr√∂m was unveiled as the new manager of Assyriska IK in the Swedish Football Division 3.

Population: Geography The town lies in the Kolyma region near where the Susuman River joins the Berelyokh. The town sits on the M56 Kolyma Highway, an unsealed track often known as the \\"Road of Bones\\", which connects Yakutsk with Magadan. History It was founded in 1936 as a settlement of a sovkhoz called Susuman, named after the nearby river of the same name. In 1938, the settlement was greatly expanded to become a center of gold mining in the western part of what is now Magadan Oblast under the control of Dalstroy. Gold mining and other industrial operations in the region were largely reliant on corrective labor camps of the Gulag system, with a large number operating in Susuman's vicinity. From 1949 until 1956, Susuman was the base for one of the Soviet Union's largest corrective labor camps, the Zaplag of the Dalstroy program. During this time, up to 16,500 prisoners were kept in the camps. Susuman was granted town status in 1964. In the post-Soviet period, the population dropped significantly, from a high of around 18,000 inhabitants in 1991, down to 5,855 as of the 2010 Census. Climate Susuman has an extreme dry-winter subarctic climate (K√∂ppen climate classification Dwd/Dwc) with extremely cold, dry winters and short, very mild summers. It is one of the coldest permanently inhabited settlements in the world, with yearly mean temperature of Administrative and municipal status Within the framework of administrative divisions, Susuman serves as the administrative center of Susumansky District, to which it is directly subordinated.Law #1292-OZ As a municipal division, the town of Susuman is incorporated within Susumansky Municipal District as Susuman Urban Settlement.Law #512-OZ Economy The town's economy relies mainly on its status as one of the centers of gold mining in the Kolyma region.

The community is located beside Chebucto Head, the prominent coastal headland. History Wave's crash on the rocks in Duncan's Cove Duncan's Cove began as a small fishing community. The first recorded settler in Duncan's Cove was Simon Duntoyn in 1752. Other families followed including the Crab, Full, Leonard and McNab families. John McNab was granted in 1859. The cove was named after Admiral Adam Duncan, 1st Viscount Duncan who defeated the Dutch at the Battle of Camperdown.Alfreda Withrow, One City, Many Communities, Nimbus Publishing, 1999, p. 178. Overlooking the entrance to Halifax Harbour made it a strategic part of Halifax's defense system in the 18th century. The Camperdown Signal Station, was built a few miles northward next to nearby Portuguese Cove in 1797, the first of a series of signal stations built by Prince Edward, Duke of Kent. It later became a wireless station and was operational until 1925. Duncan's Cove from Gannet Lane In World War Two, the area around Chebucto Head, including Duncan's Cove, became a fortified coastal battery armed with three Elswick 6 inch naval guns. For these cannon, a four-story concrete director tower was built near the eastern shore of Duncan's Cove with a long- range optical rangefinder installed on the top floor. By 1943, this range- finding apparatus had been supplanted by the latest radar artillery control unit. The battery complex was decommissioned in the 1950s but many bunkers remain, some converted into private residences. In the late 1950s two families of musicians who played with the Atlantic Symphony Orchestra moved to Duncan's Cove. One of those families embarked upon a decades-long construction project of unconventionally shaped timber-framed dwellings, and even had a small private airstrip. By the late 1960s, fishing from the cove had dwindled and the community become known as an artists colony, with many symphony players, visual artists and theatrical actors residing there. The landmark gunnery director tower stood derelict for many years, until finally passing into private hands in the 1990s. The building is virtually unrecognizable today, having been radically converted into a luxury residence. Communications *Telephone exchange 902 - 868 * First three digits of postal code - B3V Lighthouse Duncan's Cove, showing the Chebucto Head Lighthouse at left and a battery at right The first of several lighthouses was built at Chebucto Head in 1872 with a steam foghorn just below it. The lighthouse was moved in 1940 several hundred metres to the north to make way for the gun battery. The lighthouse included a launch ramp for a lifeboat, as well as an old naval carronade for firing blank charges as a crude foghorn. Some ruins of the original lighthouse can be seen to this day (2008) The present lighthouse, a concrete tower, was built in 1967 and is situated high atop a bluff. The lighthouse was automated in the 1990s, and a massive array of electronic foghorns erected. The light-keepers house was left vacant for several years, then rented, and then vacant once more. It was burned by vandals in 2004. There is an area of pavement around the base of the lighthouse tower which once served as a parking lot popular with sightseers. The road leading up to the lighthouse has been closed to vehicle traffic, and is now only accessible by foot. It is a whale-watching location during January and February, when pods of fin whales feed in the area before migrating elsewhere.

In 2009, the station adopted its current CJRP-FM call-sign, and flipped format blending Classic Rock and 1970s top-40 hits, becoming the first \\"Classic Hits\\" station in Canada. Later when CRTC regulations changed restricting the number of \\"hits\\" an FM station could play, CJRP refined their format playing only the top songs from the era. By the Fall of 2010 the station had grown substantially gaining an audience in key demographics approaching a 12-share, becoming the highest rated LPFM (50 watt specialty station) in Canadian history, and out pacing several full powered stations within the Saint John market. The on-air staff had Bob Pritchard and Kim Cookson hosting the morning show and Marc Henwood on afternoon drive. Mark Lee hosted a daily interview show called Grater Saint John Today (later replaced by John Campbell and Bob McVicar). Graham Brown and Bob Pritchard manned the news desk. In January 2011, BBM (the agency the determines the audience of radio stations) announced that they were re-defining the boundaries of Saint John market which effectively cut the rated audience of the station in half, removing them as a competitive player in the Saint John market. In response, Pritchard reached out to the CRTC to increase the power of the station to almost 4,000 watts @ 96.3. Despite following specific directions from the Commission, the application was denied Broadcasting Decision CRTC 2011-640 for what was later identified as submitting the wrong forms. In seeking an administrative redress of the decision, the CRTC advised Pritchard to resubmit the primary form from one requesting a power increase to different form requesting a new radio station license, which was done. This process was later rejected by the CRTC as an incomplete application because the Commission deemed that the technical brief submitted with the initial application had respired. In response, Pritchard asked the Federal Court of Appeal to review the decision on the basis that the CRTC was using undocumented rules and/or processes in applying the Broadcasting Act to LPFM radio stations in a manner not consistent with how it was being applied to other classes of radio licences. The goal was to have the role of LPFM radio stations defined in terms of the broadcasting act, and to force the CRTC document how LPFM radio stations should/could/behave within the terms of the Broadcasting Act. The Federal Court declined to hear the Appeal on the basis that the allotted time to appeal a CRTC decision had expired. The entire response to appeal by the Commission was extremely controversial, and raised many questions. On April 21, 2013 the station was taken off air for technical reasons and subsequently sold to Jim Houssen, the owner of a Christian station (CKO Moncton), and has been re-branded \\"Where Country Meets the Cross\\". On December 3, 2013, the CRTC approved the licence renewal for the station to August 2017 (Broadcasting Decision CRTC 2013-647). On December 5, 2013 the CRTC heard a non-appearing hearing for the application by Houssen to purchase the assets of CJRP-FM and change the format to one of religious music without a talk commitment. As of January, 2015 the station broadcasts that of a religious format branded as CKO-2, CKO-1 being its sister station in Moncton, New Brunswick.

(anglicised as Carrigart or Carrickart) is a small Gaeltacht village in the Barony of Kilmacrennan to the north of County Donegal, Ireland. The village is on the R245 route between Letterkenny and Creeslough. Situated as it is at the base of the Rosguill peninsula, in one of the more remote but most scenic parts of the country, the village provides services for a large hinterland, with a supermarket with banking facilities, a post office, a doctor's surgery and a barracks manned part-time by the Garda S√≠och√°na. Carrigart has a public park that borders the shoreline behind the houses on the main street. Designed by Angela Gallagher, it is maintained by the Tidy Towns Committee and has won several awards. The village and its environs remain largely agricultural, relying heavily on passing trade and tourism during the summer months. In common with the rest of this part of Donegal, Carrigart has many second homes, owned especially by Northern Irish holiday makers. The village, which celebrated its centenary in 2002, although there is evidence of Carrigart's existence for longer than that, originally formed part of the estates of the Earls of Leitrim, nearby Mulroy House being one of their seats. William Clements, 3rd Earl of Leitrim, was assassinated in nearby Cratlagh wood in 1878 by men from the neighbouring peninsula of Fanad.

This acquisition included not only her writings, but also the estate of Henri Gaudier, with many of his works and papers. Ede drew extensively on the letters written by Gaudier to Brzeska, and her writings and other material, when he published A Life of Gaudier-Brzeska (London: W.

Here was a tale worth telling on film... although for years it seemed to be nothing but a pipe dream.\\"Russell p 87 Russell had made a number of films about artists, mostly for television, starting with Two Scottish Painters. His success with feature films such as Women in Love encouraged him to turn the book into a feature.Russell p 88 Russell says because the film was about an artist it was considered an \\"art film\\" and was difficult to finance. \\"I ended up double mortgaging my house and finding most of the money myself,\\" he later wrote. \\"There was a chance I'd end up on the street but I felt I owed Gaudier something.

The program is based on leadership and is available to students in grades 8-12. As of April 2018, Inter-A is situated within Queen Elizabeth Secondary School which is part of School District 36 Surrey. The program was formerly located at Kwantlen Park Secondary School. History The Inter-A program was devised by Victor Vollrath and John Harper. The two teachers were sharing a classroom and teaching at opposite sides, when they came to the realization that this way of teaching was highly productive for students. In fact, individual students with the skills and motivation to excel maintain this level of productivity to this day. Thus, Inter-A was born. The program was originally located at Len Shepherd Secondary School. There it remained for many years, and the school was separated into Inter-A and the original Len Shepherd students evenly. Inter-A started off small, with thirty or less students ranging from grades 8-10 and eventually extended to grade 12 with the first grad class of 3 students graduating in 1992. Two of those grads are still married and 2 of the four grads of 1993 are still married in 2020. Inter-A moved to Kwantlen Park Secondary School in 2002, opening the door to many more students. Victor Vollrath and John Harper retired as teachers a year later, but their ideas were passed off onto the new teachers. Academics Inter-A students can be found in the hallways at different times of the day, which suggests that Inter-A has more freedom than its mainstream counterpart. It offers all the electives necessary for graduation and a place at any University or College in British Columbia or in Canada. The main differences are that Physical Education is demanded of the students until graduation, Fine Arts programs are chosen by the students, and the Inter-A Component. The students are broken off into two categories: Intermediates (grades 8-9) and Seniors (10-12). There are six blocks in the day, as opposed to the standard four to accommodate the average high school attention span. There are also six units of six (occasionally seven) weeks per school year, with a report card at the end of each one, as opposed to the two-semester system. PE Physical Education is divided between Seniors and Intermediates on alternating days. Anyone can run a PE option, grade 8-12. The teachers run options to join as well. (All marks are out of 100%, but are then scaled down to 75%. The remaining 25% goes to the Inter-A Component, which is based on three criteria. The three criteria are: Community Service (10%), Choice (10%), and CPP (5%).) Fine Arts Fine Arts occurs over the course of three blocks, one day a week. Like P.E, anyone can run an option for it with the options the teachers are running as well. (All marks are out of 100%, but are then scaled down to 75%. The remaining 25% goes to the Inter-A Component, which is based on three criteria. The three criteria are: Community Service (10%), Choice (10%), and CPP (5%).) Community service Students earn credit by participating in community service. Ten hours of work is required every unit. A log must be kept by the students and signed by an appropriate overseer. Community Service can be completed within the school. This can be as simple as tutoring a fellow peer, or as complex as running the school's recycling program. Many students go above and beyond, completing up to 20 hours of Community Service a unit. There are no \\"roll-over\\" hours. CPP Career and Personal Planning is similar to CSL in the fact that students set goals for themselves. However, these goals are checked bi-weekly and must be signed by the pupil's legal guardian. A portfolio of the student's work is also gathered in this class as evidence of their academic progress. Choice Students in grade 7,8, and 9 can elect to run a choice seminar. A choice seminar is a student-led class, based on their knowledge of a particular subject, whether it be soccer, or the history of the ukulele. The student will then be required to teach their peers about that particular subject, through visuals, demonstrations, group activities, or however else they see fit. Attending and handing in an assignment based on the leader's subject is part of an Inter-A student's choice work. Extra languages French is taught in Inter-A. However, if a student is taking a language class outside of Inter-A for extra credit, they can use that as their language credit and have the designated Language block as a spare. A record must be kept of the student's involvement, and the language must be one that makes the student eligible for graduation. French in Inter-A used to be a work-at-your-own-pace program. However, after the departures of Vollrath and Harper it has gone back to regular classes. Grades 8-12 each have a different teacher taking them through different stages of French. A student can skip ahead if they show vast knowledge of the subject matter or finish the stages early. Math For students in grades eight through ten, Math is self paced. At the end of every chapter they must get their \\"Math Tracker\\" signed to signify they understand the concepts, then take the test. If they pass, they may go on to the next chapter. This age bracket sits in mixed age, mixed ability groups, called \\"Inter-A groups\\". The Inter-A group was made to teach group skills, leadership, and problem-solving. An Inter-A group should include even members of each gender, students of different ages/grades when possible, students of different skill levels and students who often do not work with each other. Grades eleven and twelve students work with a teacher in a traditional setting, as opposed to the self- taught younger grades, as the subject matter is more difficult to grasp. However, once a week the younger students attend a Math Tutorial led by a teacher or a more experienced student. Calculus 12 is not offered in Inter-A at this time, but all three math streams (Apprenticeship and Workplace, Pre- Calculus, and Foundations of Math) are offered until the grade twelve level. Extracurricular activities Students wishing to attend a post secondary art school are recommended to attend a specialized high school whose focus is more art-based. That is not to say that Inter-A children cannot participate in other school events; sports, theater and all clubs are open to members of Inter-A and Queen Elizabeth students. Inter-A had an Ultimate team called \\"The Kwantlen Park Timberwolves\\". In the 2007/2008 season, Inter-A ultimate started the regular season with a 6-0 record for both the senior and junior teams. The Junior team is currently ranked 1st throughout British Columbia and the Senior team is ranked second in their division. A Reach for the Top team has been started. The team placed well in their first year of competition. However, this program has currently been suspended. An Inter-A play is often run annually. \\"The Grounding of Donnie Greener\\", written by Roger Blenman, and was a success. Inter-A has several Destination Imagination teams. The teams often place second or better in Provincial Tournaments, and several have gone on to score highly at the World Finals in Knoxville, Tennessee. Math Club is available after school some days for students who struggle, need service, or just love math and need somewhere to do it. Inter-A has an Executive Team, much like its own Student Council. They make important monetary and educational decisions about Inter-A and its future, as well as plan future field trips. It is led by students as an independent body, and elections are held every two units. All Inter-A students are invited to vote. A \\"Herd\\" is when the Inter-A students come together for an information session in one of the three Inter-A classrooms. \\"Apple Awards\\" are given at the end-of-the-year barbecue. They are given out during an outdoor herd to each student in a light-hearted manner. The awards are usually inside jokes suggested by friends or playful pokes at students given by the teachers. A red, BC grown apple is given to all students. Excursions Excursions in Inter-A can be divided into three categories: Day trips The small field trip in Inter-A is a typical field trip experience. Inter-A students have been to the Vancouver Aquarium, Chinatown, Geneskool, Bard on the Beach, and Science World. Day trips are used as a way to give students a real-world application for work done in a classroom. Overnight A field trip that lasts overnight. A great example is the annual \\"Inter-A Retreat\\" at the beginning of every year, which is three days, and two nights. The Retreat is in September of every year, and usually occurs at Camp Sunrise on the Sunshine Coast. For the 2015-2016 school year, it took place at Rockridge Canyon in Princeton, British Columbia. The Retreat is an opportunity for students and teachers to get to know each other before the year starts. This is especially helpful for new grade eight students to integrate into the program with ease. Overseas Every second year the Inter-A program offers a trip overseas for two to three weeks. The trip is expensive, but the response is excellent. Trips to Italy, France, Australia, Greece, England and other countries have been a tremendous success in integrating different cultures and ideals into the minds of the youth. Through Kwantlen Park, exchange programs with other students from Quebec were also available.  Achievements  The Inter-A program has been regarded as one of the most notable institutes of secondary education in British Columbia. With the skills developed in Inter-A many of the graduates go on to university level education with high exam scores . Both founders of the program, Vic Vollrath and John Harper, have received national recognition awards for their excellence in teaching. Inter-A has placed their parent schools (Len Shepherd and Kwantlen Park Secondary) amongst the top public schools in British Columbia within recent years based on Grade 12 provincial exam marks.

Walker, \\"A 'Scottish Cooper' for an 'American Scott'\\", 537; John Robert Moore, \\"Defoe and Scott,\\" 729. The setting is the southern tip of the main island of Shetland (which Scott visited in 1814), towards the end of the 17th century, with 1689 as the likely date of the main incidents.Walter Scott, The Pirate, ed. Mark Weinstein and Alison Lumsden (Edinburgh, 2001), 487. Composition and sources On 21 August 1820 John Ballantyne offered Archibald Constable a new novel to follow Kenilworth (which was to be published in January the following year). No title or subject was specified at that stage, and it was not until April 1821 that Ballantyne noted that what he calls the 'Buccaneer' had been begun. The need for research on the northern isles, and other occupations, slowed Scott down, and the first volume was not completed until early August, but his pace then quickened and the work was finished in late October.Ibid., 393‚Äì96. In 1814 Scott had taken a six-week cruise with the Northern Lighthouse Commissioners. He kept a diary (eventually published in his biography by J. G. Lockhart), and when he came to write The Pirate he was able to draw on it for many details about an otherwise unfamiliar part of Scotland. He accumulated a small collection of pirate literature, the most useful being History of the Lives and Actions of the most Famous Highwaymen, Murderers, Street-Robbers, &c.; To which is added, A Genuine Account of the Voyages and Plunders of the most noted Pirates by Captain Charles Johnson (1742). This was supplemented by an account of the pirate John Gow supplied by Alexander Peterkin, Sheriff- Substitute of Orkney and Zetland, published in 1822, the year of the novel's appearance, as Notes on Orkney and Zetland. Scott was also acquainted with several books on the northern isles from the seventeenth century to his own time which discussed the agricultural questions that occupy Triptolemus Yellowley's attention in the novel.Ibid., 487‚Äì95. Editions The Pirate was published in three volumes by Constable and Ballantyne in Edinburgh on 24 December 1821 and by Hurst, Robinson, and Co. in London two days later.For a description of the early editions see Ibid., 413‚Äì33. As with all the Waverley novels before 1827 publication was anonymous. The print run was 12,000, though 2000 of these were a late afterthought which resulted in a bibliographical complication. The price was one and a half guineas (¬£1 11s 6d or ¬£1.57¬Ω). It is unlikely that Scott was involved with the novel again until March and then August 1830 when he revised the text and provided an introduction and notes for the 'Magnum' edition in which it appeared as Volumes 24 and 25 in May and June 1831. The standard modern edition, by Mark Weinstein and Alison Lumsden, was published in 2001 as Volume 12 of the Edinburgh Edition of the Waverley Novels: it is based on the first edition with emendations mainly from Scott's manuscript and proof corrections; the Magnum material is included in Volume 25b. Plot introduction The arrival of the shipwrecked captain, Cleveland, spoils young Mordaunt's relationship with the Troil girls, and soon a bitter rivalry grows between the two men. Minna falls in love with Cleveland, not knowing his true profession. Brenda however is in love with Mordaunt. The pirates capture the Troils, but after an encounter with the frigate HMS Halcyon, they are freed. Brenda and Mordaunt are reunited, and Minna and Clement parted. Plot summary Old House of Sumburgh Mr Mertoun and his son had arrived as strangers, and resided for several years in the remaining rooms of the old mansion of the Earls of Orkney, the father leading a very secluded life, while the son Mordaunt became a general favourite with the inhabitants, and especially with the udaller, Magnus Troil, and his daughters, Brenda and Minna. On his way home from a visit to them, he and the pedlar Snailsfoot sought shelter from a storm at a farmhouse, at Hafra, home of Triptolemus Yellowley agent of the Chamberlain of Orkney and Shetland, and his sister Barbara. The visitors were amused with the Yellowley's penurious ways, and encountered Norna, a relative of Magnus Troil who was supposed to be in league with the fairies, and to possess supernatural powers. The next day a ship was wrecked on the rocky coast, and, at the risk of his life, Mordaunt rescued the captain, Cleveland, as he was cast on the beach clinging to a plank, while Norna prevented his sea-chest from being pillaged. Cleveland was in fact a pirate, but they did not know this. The captain promised his preserver a trip in a consort ship which he expected would arrive shortly, and went to seek the udaller's help in recovering some of his other property that had been washed ashore. After the lapse of several weeks, however, during which the Troils had discontinued their friendly communications with him, Mordaunt heard that the stranger was still their guest, and that they were arranging an entertainment for St John's Eve, to which he had not been invited. Minna Troil and Cleveland, illustration from 1879 edition As he was brooding over this slight, Norna touched his shoulder, and, assuring him of her goodwill, advised him to join the party uninvited. Warned by his father against falling in love, and with some misgivings as to his reception, he called at Harfra on his way, and accompanied Yellowley and his sister to the feast. Minna and Brenda Troil replied to their discarded companion's greeting with cold civility, and he felt convinced that Captain Cleveland had supplanted him in their esteem. The bard, Claud Halcro, endeavoured to cheer him with his poetry and reminiscences of \\"glorious\\" John Dryden; and, in the course of the evening, Brenda, disguised as a masquer, told him they had heard that he had spoken unkindly of them, but that she did not believe he had done so. She also expressed her fear that the stranger had won Minna's love, and begged Mordaunt to discover all he could respecting him. During an attempt to capture a whale the following day, Cleveland saved Mordaunt from drowning, and, being thus released from his obligation to him, intimated that henceforth they were rivals. The same evening the pedlar brought tidings that a strange ship had arrived at Kirkwall, and Cleveland talked of a trip thither to ascertain whether it was the consort he had been so long expecting. After the sisters had retired to bed, Norna appeared in their room, and narrated a startling tale of her early life, which led Minna to confess her attachment to the captain, and to elicit Brenda's partiality for Mordaunt. At a secret interview the next morning, Cleveland admitted to Minna that he was a pirate, upon which she declared that she could only still love him as a penitent, and not as the hero she had hitherto imagined him to be. He announced, in the presence of her father and sister, his intention of starting at once for Kirkwall; but at night he serenaded her, and then, after hearing a struggle and a groan, she saw the shadow of a figure disappearing with another on his shoulders. Overcome with grief and suspense, she was seized with a fit of melancholy, for the cure of which the udaller consulted Norna in her secluded dwelling; and, after a mystic ceremony, she predicted that the cause would cease when \\"crimson foot met crimson hand\\" in the Martyr's Aisle in Orkney land, whither she commanded her kinsman to proceed with his daughters. Mordaunt had been stabbed by the pirate, but had been carried away by Norna to Hoy, where she told him she was his mother, and, after curing his wound, conveyed him to Kirkwall. Here Cleveland had joined his companions, and, having been chosen captain of the consort ship, he obtained leave from the provost for her to take in stores at Stromness and quit the islands, on condition that he remained as a hostage for the crew's behaviour. Stones of Stenness On their way they captured the brig containing the Troils, but Minna and Brenda were sent safely ashore by John Bunce, Cleveland's lieutenant, and escorted by old Halcro to visit a relative. The lovers met in the cathedral of St Magnus, whence, with Norna's aid, Cleveland escaped to his ship, and the sisters were transferred to the residence of the bard's cousin, where their father joined them, and found Mordaunt in charge of a party of dependents for their protection. When all was ready for sailing, the captain resolved to see Minna once more, and having sent a note begging her to meet him at the Standing Stones of Stenness at daybreak, he made his way thither. Brenda persuaded Mordaunt to allow her sister to keep the appointment, and as the lovers were taking their last farewell, they and Brenda were seized by Bunce and his crew from the boat, and would have been carried off, had not Mordaunt hastened to the rescue, and made prisoners of the pirate and his lieutenant. Norna had warned Cleveland against delaying his departure, and his last hopes were quenched when, from the window of the room in which he and Bunce were confined, they witnessed the arrival of the Halcyon, whose captain she had communicated with, and the capture, after a desperate resistance, of their ship. The elder Mertoun now sought Norna's aid to save their son, who, he declared, was not Mordaunt, as she imagined, but Cleveland, whom he had trained as a pirate under his own real name of Vaughan, her former lover; and having lost trace of him till now, had come to Jarlshof, with his child by a Spanish wife, to atone for the misdeeds of his youth. On inquiry it appeared that Cleveland and Bunce had earned their pardon by acts of mercy in their piratical career, and were allowed to enter the king's service. Minna was further consoled by a penitent letter from her lover; Brenda became Mordaunt's wife; and the aberration of mind, occasioned by remorse at having caused her father's death, having died, Norna abandoned her supernatural pretensions and peculiar habits, and resumed her family name.

Volume One Ch. 1: Some years before the story begins, the mysterious and melancholy Basil Mertoun and his young son Mordaunt arrive in Zetland, where Magnus Troil of Burgh Westra agrees to rent him the deserted Jarlshof castle. Ch. 2: Basil is cheated by the locals: he dismisses his housekeeper Swertha, but following advice from Mordaunt she achieves reinstatement. During his father's black moods Mordaunt engages in social activities in the neighbourhood. Ch. 3: Mordaunt's affections seem to hover between the contrasting Troil daughters Minna and Brenda. Ch. 4: Returning to Jarlshof from Burgh Westra in a storm, Mordaunt seeks refuge at Harfra (or Stourburgh) with Triptolemus Yellowley, a factor from Yorkshire devoted to agricultural improvements, and his sister Barbara (Baby). Ch. 5: The Yellowleys discuss their unexpected guest and are joined by a pedlar [Bruce Snailsfoot] and Norna of the Fitful-head. Ch. 6: After apparently quelling the storm, Norna departs from Harfra and Mordaunt prepares to continue his journey. Ch. 7: Back at Jarlshof, Mordaunt rescues a sailor from a shipwreck. Bruce, Norna, and some of the locals arrive on the scene. Ch. 8: At the house of the parish constable Niel Ronaldson, the sailor introduces himself to Mordaunt as Captain Clement Cleveland and gives him a Spanish fowling-piece. Mordaunt provides him with a letter of introduction to Magnus. Ch. 9: A month later Bryce sells Mordaunt material for a waistcoat which he intends to wear at a dance at Burgh Westra, though he has oddly not been invited. Ch. 10: On a gloom-filled walk Mordaunt encounters Norna, who warns him that Cleveland, now in residence at Burgh Westra, is a serpent. Ch. 11: On his way to Burgh Westra, Mordaunt joins company with the Yellowleys, Triptolemous intending to present his improvement plans to Magnus. Ch. 12: At Burgh Westra, Mordaunt receives an awkward welcome from Magnus and his daughters. Claud Halcro, a local poet, makes light of such difficulties. Volume Two Ch. 1 (13): At dinner Mordaunt observes Cleveland paying attention to Minna. Ch. 2 (14): Mordaunt is assailed by the simultaneous discourses of Halcro and Triptolemus before the dancing begins. Ch. 3 (15): Halcro entertains some of the company, and Mordaunt observes the sword dance. Ch. 4 (16): After a performance by masquers Brenda, who is one of their number, leads Mordaunt away and asks him to watch Cleveland. Mordaunt finds himself attracted to her. Ch. 5 (17): The following day Cleveland saves Mordaunt at a whale hunt but repels his attempt to thank him. Ch. 6 (18): Bryce appears with goods acquired from what Cleveland takes to be his companion ship; Mordaunt and Cleveland quarrel over which of them has the right to buy a box and a chaplet. Ch. 7 (19): Minna and Brenda, who find themselves growing apart somewhat, are visited by contrasting dreams. Norna interrupts their sleep and tells them how she had accidentally caused the death of her father, who had wished her to marry Magnus rather than the lover to whom she had committed herself. Ch. 8 (20): Minna and Brenda have a difference of opinion over the respective merits of Mordaunt and Cleveland, with whom Minna is in love. Ch. 9 (21): Norna tells the fortunes of the assembled company. Ch. 10 (22): As they walk by the sea Cleveland tells Minna he cannot be Mordaunt's friend. He relates his story, and she is appalled by the ruthlessness he has adopted to command respect. Ch. 11 (23): At night Minna hears Cleveland outside the window singing a farewell song, followed by sounds of a struggle with Mordaunt. Ch. 12 (24): Swertha alerts Basil to his son's disappearance and he institutes a search, going himself to consult Norna. Ch. 13 (25): At Saint Ninian's (or Ringan's) church Norna advises Basil to seek his son at the Kirkwall Fair. Ch. 14 (26): Concerned about Minna's depression, Magnus takes his daughters to consult Norna. On the way he confirms and augments her story, naming her lover as Vaughan, and indicating that she gave birth to a child who disappeared and is probably dead. Ch. 15 (27): Magnus and his daughter arrive at Norna's burgh and are received by her dwarf servant Pacolet. Volume Three Ch. 1 (28): Norna conducts a magical rite and gives Minna a leaden heart to wear as a sign of hope. Ch. 2 (29): Norna and Pacolet throw the provisions brought by Magnus into the sea. He and his daughters find shelter in a deserted hut. Ch. 3 (30): Magnus and his daughters find Halcro and Triptolemus in the hut. The factor tells how he is in quest of a cache of coins found at Harfa which were removed by a dwarf, evidently Pacolet, who arrives with a letter from Norna advising Magnus to go with his daughters to the Kirkwall Fair. Ch. 4 (31): Cleveland meets his lieutenant John Bunce in Kirkwall and tells him of his intention to give up piracy. He also indicates that the wounded Mordaunt is in Norna's care. Ch. 5 (32): Cleveland beats Bryce, who has bought the captain's clothes from Swertha. He is arrested but rescued by his fellow-pirates. Ch. 6 (33): On the island of Hoy, Norna reveals herself to Mordaunt as his mother and wishes him to Marry Minna. Ch. 7 (34): On board ship the pirates agree that Cleveland should assume temporary command. He proposes to the Provost of Kirkwall that the ship load up at Stromness, out of the way of an expected government frigate, the Hispaniola, and offers himself as security for the pirates' good conduct. Ch. 8 (35): The Provost nominates Triptolemus to pilot the pirates' ship to Stromness, but he escapes with Goffe's connivance. Ch. 9 (36): The pirates capture the ship bringing Magnus and his daughters to Kirkwall, and send the sisters ashore with a message to the Provost threatening reprisals if Cleveland is harmed. Ch. 10 (37): The Provost tells the sisters and Halcro he does not have the authority to release Cleveland. Norna appears to Minna and Cleveland meeting in St Magnus Cathedral and insists they part for ever. Cleveland evades his guards and Minna and Halcro agree with the Provost that they should attempt to get him and the other pirates to leave the country. Ch. 11 (38): After conducting Cleveland from the cathedral by a secret passage, Norna says that if he stays in Orkney he will die. He is taken on board ship and releases Magnus. Ch. 12 (39): Cleveland tells Bunce of his determination to go ashore at Stennis to see Minna. Bunce and Dick Fletcher plan to bring both Cleveland and Minna aboard by force. Bunce delivers Cleveland's letter to Minna at Stennis. Magnus receives Mordaunt as restored to his favour. Ch. 13 (40): Mordaunt allows the sisters to meet Cleveland at the Stones of Stennis. Their parting scene is interrupted by the arrival of the pirates who are defeated by Mordaunt's armed guard, Cleveland and others being taken prisoner. From the prison window they observe the capture of the pirate ship by the Hispaniola. Ch. 14 (41): In the cathedral Basil (Vaughan) tells Norna that Cleveland (not Mordaunt) is their son, Clement Vaughan. He took him to the island of Hispaniola, where Basil married a Spanish woman who gave birth to Mordaunt, and eventually he believed Clement to have perished after being marooned by a rebellious crew on a desert island. Among the proofs of Cleveland's parentage are the box and chaplet of Ch. 18. Ch. 15 (42): The Provost believes that Cleveland will obtain a free pardon in London on account of his protection of two women of quality in the Spanish Main. Brenda marries Mordaunt, whose father is believed to have retired to a foreign convent. Norna becomes a pious Christian, and Minna lives with cheerful resignation after hearing of Cleveland's honourable and gallant death in government service in the Spanish Main. Reception Critical assessments of The Pirate differed widely.For a full list of contemporaneous British reviews of The Pirate see William S. Ward, Literary Reviews in British Periodicals, 1821‚Äí1826: A Bibliography (New York and London, 1977), 174. For an earlier annotated list see James Clarkson Corson, A Bibliography of Sir Walter Scott (Edinburgh and London, 1943), 245‚Äí47. It was among the best of the Waverley novels; it was the worst; it occupied a middle rank. The plot was unusually weak, merely loose as usual, or better managed. The style was careless as ever, or purer and more elegant. The presentation of the northern isles was vivid, or it was tediously minute. A third of the reviews were almost entirely enthusiastic, a smaller number were dismissive, and the rest came up with 'middle rank' verdicts. Norna was widely admired as a more sublime Meg Merrilees, and her poetry attracted high praise even from reviewers who were otherwise unimpressed. The Yellowleys were found novel and highly entertaining. Other favourite characters were Bunce, Halcro (albeit over-extended), and the pirate crew. Contrasting pairs were admired in Brenda and Minna, and in Cleveland and Mordaunt. Several reviewers complained about repetition of characters from previous novels, but others discerned discriminating facets.

The government of Cyprus also recognizes as refugees the descendants of the original refugees in the male line regardless of place of birth.Christofias vetoes costly refugee law TheFreeLibrary.com 1963-74 background Tension began in 1963 when Makarios proposed thirteen amendments to the constitution of the Republic of Cyprus. Turkish Cypriots were opposed to the proposal since they viewed it as an attempt to remove their constitutional safeguards that Greek Cypriots had claimed to be problematic in the conduct of government. On 21 December 1963, clashes between Greek Cypriots and Turkish Cypriots erupted unleashed a wave of violence across the island. Facing violence from Greek Cypriot paramilitaries, in favour of unification with Greece (Enosis), thousands of Turkish Cypriots fled their properties to enclaves with Turkish Cypriot majorities, protected by Turkish troops. By 1974, an attempted coup sponsored by the military Greek military junta of 1967-1974 then ruling Greece, trying to overthrow the Cypriot government and unite the island with Greece, was met with a military invasion of the island by Turkey, which claimed it was acting as a guarantor power to prevent annexation of the island. Turkey's subsequent decades-long occupation of northern Cyprus has attracted widespread international condemnation.Governmentand Politic Post-1974 Turkey, in the 1974 Turkish invasion of Cyprus, advanced to occupy about 38% of the island in the north of the Republic of Cyprus and thus transforming the Turkish Cypriot objective of Taksim (partition of the island of Cyprus into Turkish and Greek portions, a concept declared as early as 1957 by Dr. Fazil K√º√ß√ºk) into reality. Greek Cypriots in the north (nearly half the Greek Cypriot population of the island) were forced by the advancing Turkish Army to flee south. Likewise, Turkish Cypriots who had not already fled to the enclaves during the intercommunal violence now chose to do so. It is estimated that 40% of the Greek population of Cyprus, as well as over half of the Turkish Cypriot population, were displaced by the Turkish invasion. The figures for internally displaced Cypriots varies, the United Peacekeeping force in Cyprus (UNFICYP) estimates 165,000 Greek Cypriots and 45,000 Turkish Cypriots. The UNHCR registers slightly higher figures of 200,000 and 65,000 respectively, being partly based on official Cypriot statistics which register children of displaced families as refugees. On August 2, 1975, the two parties reached in Vienna the Voluntary Exchange of Population Agreement, implemented under United Nations auspices. In accordance with this Agreement, Turkish Cypriots remaining in the south moved to the North and Greek Cypriots remaining in the north moved to the south with the exception of a few hundred Greek Cypriots who chose to reside in the north.http://www.internal- displacement.org/idmc/website/countries.nsf/(httpEnvelopes)/D3F74A4AB400E593802570B8005A6EA2?OpenDocument After that, the separation of the two communities via the UN-patrolled Green Line prohibited the return of all internally displaced people. Through the years, multiple demonstrations and rallies have been made by the Greek Cypriots demanding to return to their properties, such as the 1996 demonstrations by thousands of Greek Cypriot women attempting to return to their homes and properties in 1989 without success. A number of Greek Cypriots chose to take their case to the European Court of Human Rights filing against Turkey and argued their homes are being occupied by migrant workers brought from Turkey with the intention of altering the demographics of the island. In 1990, applications filed with the European Court of Human Rights on behalf of 18 Greek Cypriots in the case of Varnava and Others v. Turkey, resulted in a decision on 18 September 2009 which ordered Turkey to pay ‚Ç¨12,000 within three months to every applicant for non-pecuniary damages and ‚Ç¨8,000 for costs and expenses. In 1999, UNHCR halted its assistance activities for internally displaced persons in Cyprus.UNHCR UNHCR stopped help to displaced persons in Cyprus Neither the Greek Cypriot or Turkish Cypriot displaced populations are considered to be in any need of humanitarian aid. The Greek Cypriot government instituted a program of housing and aid for the displaced. This housing programme was giving Turkish Cypriot refugee properties to the displaced Greek Cypriots. They were also benefitting from the boom in tourism across the south of the island. Turkish Cypriot relief came mainly in the form of economic aid from Turkey as well as the allocation of formerly Greek Cypriot owned houses and property. Both sides had the same housing programme, taking use of the abandoned properties. In April 2003, the Turkish Cypriot President Rauf Denkta≈ü opened the border crossing for the first time since the island was divided, allowing both Greek and Turkish Cypriots to view their property for the first time since the separation of the two communities. Crossing procedures have since been relaxed allowing Cypriots from both communities to move relatively freely across the island. It was hoped that Cyprus's accession to the European Union would provide an impetus for reunification of the island and, in 2004, the UN-backed Annan plan was put to referendums on both sides of the island. The plan envisaged a bicommunal, bizonal, federal state, with territorial concessions by the Turkish Cypriot side but only a limited right of return for displaced Greek Cypriots. The plan was accepted by the Turkish Cypriots but rejected by Greek Cypriots. Cyprus later entered the EU as a divided island. A new round of talks was initiated in 2008 between the leaders of the two Cypriot communities, Dimitris Christofias and Mehmet Ali Talat.  Legal action   Toumazou et al. v. Republic of Turkey et al.  In October 2009, a lawsuit was brought against the TRNC Representative Offices and HSBC in Washington for the sale of Greek-Cypriot properties in Northern Cyprus.

It connects Estonian and Finnish gas grids. The pipeline provides Finland with an access to the Latvia's natural gas storage in Inƒçukalns. In addition, the pipeline enables construction of the regional liquefied natural gas terminal. History The project was proposed originally by the Finnish natural gas company Gasum in cooperation with Eesti Gaas of Estonia. After implementation of the EU third energy package, EG V√µrguteenus, a former subsidiary of Eesti Gaas, replaced the latter. Later EG V√µrguteenus was acquired by, and became a part of the Estonian transmission system operator Elering. In October 2015, Gasum abandoned the project due to commercial viability. It was replaced by the Finnish state-owned company Baltic Connector OY. The feasibility study was completed in May 2007. A preliminary environmental impact assessment programme was done in 2010. In 2010, the European Commission financed the investigation of possibilities to create more diversified natural gas grid within the Baltic Sea Region, which included also the Balticconnector project. The seabed studies started in November 2013. The construction agreement was signed between Elering and Baltic Connector on 17 October 2016. The cornerstone of the pipeline was laid on 8 June 2018 in Ing√•. The ceremony was attended by Minister of Economic Affairs and Infrastructure of Estonia Kadri Simson, Minister of the Environment and Energy of Finland Kimmo Tiilikainen, European Commission member Jyrki Katainen and the managers of Elering and Baltic Connector Oy. Laying the offshore pipeline started on 20 May 2019 and was completed on 24 June 2019. Shielding of the offshore section were completed by 12 July 2019. The onshore section in Estonia was filled with gas on 23 October 2019 and the offshore section was filled with gas on 27 November 2019. The pipeline was inaugurated on 11 December 2019 by the ceremonies in Helsinki and Paldiski. The ceremonies were attended by presidents of Estonia and Finland Kersti Kaljulaid and Sauli Niinist√∂, ministers of economy Taavi Aas and Mika Lintil√§, Deputy Director-General of European Commission Energy Directorate Klaus-Dieter Borchardt and the managers of Elering and Baltic Connector Oy.

These turtles are critically endangered and have been evaluated to be the most endangered turtle in the world by a 2018 review. Despite their vulnerability to extinction, they are commonly eaten for food and they are still commonly shipped from Madagascar to Asia to help meet the demand of Asia's traditional medicine market. A captive breeding program has also been started to prevent the species from becoming extinct. The Turtle Conservation Fund (TCF) intends to raise US$5.6 million to cover a five-year 'Global Action Plan' which includes captive breeding and reintroduction projects, trade monitoring, new rescue centers, local conservation plans, and educational programs. Description The Madagascan big-headed turtle is one of the most endangered turtles in the world, and is also included in the Turtle Conservation Funds (TFC) top 25 endangered. It has a hard dark brown shell enclosing all the soft parts of the body and, as its name indicates, a very large head. Young turtles have a soft pattern of fine black lines on their shells, but they disappear with age. Habitat This species inhabits large areas with freshwater such as permanent slow streaming rivers, backwaters and lakes. Many of the hatching and juvenile turtles move into smaller rivers, where they can grow quickly and safely before going into deeper and larger bodies of water. Range It can be found in the western lowland areas of Madagascar. Threats The main threat for this species is that they are heavily exploited for food, caught in nets, fish traps and by hooks and lines. It is also hunted for illegal export to Asia for the traditional medicinal market. Another threat is land development as it destroys its natural habitat.

Dedicated to ice hockey, the network features live game telecasts from the NHL and other professional and collegiate hockey leagues, as well as NHL- related content including analysis programs, specials and documentaries. The channel's headquarters and studios are located in the Secaucus, New Jersey facilities also utilized by MLB Network. History The original logo used from 2007 to 2009. Launched on October 1, 2007, the NHL Network was developed out of a joint venture between the NHL and cable provider Comcast, as part of a broadcast rights agreement that resulted in the NBC Sports Network (then known as Outdoor Life Network) acquiring partial cable television rights to regular season, and Stanley Cup playoff and finals games from the National Hockey League. The NHL Network originally shared some programming with its former sister network in Canada, with the main differences in programming between the two networks being the carriage of domestically targeted commercials and live game telecasts; NHL Network in the U.S. primarily carries broadcasts from Canadian national rightsholders (such as CBC's Hockey Night in Canada, Sportsnet, and formerly TSN), while the Canadian feed primarily carried games from U.S. broadcasters. The channel also picks up simulcasts of games from regional rightsholders; live games on NHL Network that involve U.S. teams are non-exclusive, and are blacked out in the markets of U.S. teams involved in favor of local broadcasters. Logo used from 2009 to 2011. The league hired Ascent Media to manage and distribute the channel, through its publicly traded subsidiary, Ascent Media Network Services. When it launched, the NHL Network became the third sports-oriented cable network devoted to programming from and controlled by a major sports league, following the National Basketball Association-owned NBA TV (which launched in March 1999) and the National Football League-owned NFL Network (which launched in November 2003); Major League Baseball would launch its own sports channel, MLB Network, on January 1, 2009. Logo used from 2011 to 2012. On June 1, 2015, The Globe and Mail columnist David Shoalts reported that NHL Network in Canada would cease operations on September 1, 2015; national media rights to the NHL in Canada had been acquired by Rogers Communications beginning in the 2014-15 season, and the Bell Media staff members who managed the network's Canadian arm on behalf of the NHL were laid off that July. In August 2015, it was announced that the NHL had reached a six-year deal with Major League Baseball Advanced Media (MLBAM) to take over the management of the NHL's digital properties, as well as NHL Network. Operations and production of NHL Network's programming was shifted from Toronto to the Secaucus, New Jersey facilities of MLB Network. There has been minor talent sharing between the networks, and MLB Network cross-promoted an NHL Stadium Series game at Coors Field by building a scale hockey rink in its Studio 42 (which itself is designed to resemble a scaled baseball field). For much of the 2015-16 season, NHL Network studio programs originated from redressed versions of existing MLB Network sets (much of the NHL regular season falls during the MLB offseason). In April 2016, coinciding with the start of the playoffs, NHL Network introduced its own 1,200 square-foot studio, \\"The Rink\\". Carriage agreements Comcast, owners of the league's current cable partner NBCSN, is also the largest cable television provider in the United States. The company was contractually obligated to carry NHL Network on its systems by the summer of 2007 at the latest, so it would be available in time for the 2007‚Äì08 NHL season. Both Comcast and the NHL had an option to terminate their contract after the 2006‚Äì07 season, which would have voided Comcast's obligation to launch a U.S. version of NHL Network, but opted to proceed with the launch. Since its official launch in the United States, the NHL Network announced on October 8, 2007 that it would begin being carried that month on Cablevision, Charter, Cox Communications, DirecTV, Dish Network, Xfinity and Time Warner Cable through carriage agreements that were struck with each of the providers. DirecTV has aired NHL Network on channel 215 since October 31, 2007. Going forward, any provider that already carries NHL Center Ice was expected to begin carrying NHL Network on one of its programming tiers. Some providers offer NHL Network's high definition simulcast feed, which broadcasts all live games in HD. NHL.com announced on January 12, 2009 that AT&T; U-verse would begin carrying the channel. This was followed on June 2, 2009 with the announcement that NHL Network and Comcast had reached an agreement to carry the channel on the provider's Digital Classic Tier, which increased subscribership of the channel from the then-estimated two million subscribers in its placement on the \\"Sports Entertainment\\" tier to over 10 million on its Digital Classic package.Comcast to Carry NHL Network on Digital Classic Tier, Broadcasting & Cable, June 2, 2009 Internationally, the network began to be distributed in Taiwan in 2010 on satellite provider DishHD. The channel is also available on over-the-top services like DirecTV Now (Through Grandfathered plans only that were only available before revamp) and Sling TV. Carriage disputes On October 1, 2011, AT&T; U-verse dropped NHL Network due to a carriage dispute over a planned increase in retransmission payments.The Puck Stops Here: NHL Net Goes Dark On U-Verse Multichannel News October 1, 2011 On November 18, 2016, the NHL Network returned to AT&T; U-verse following a five-year hiatus.

The therapy is especially useful for sprains, strains, pulled muscles and pulled ligaments.  Cold compression  Cold compression is a combination of cryotherapy and static compression commonly used for the treatment of pain and inflammation after acute injury or surgical procedures. Cryotherapy, the use of ice or cold in a therapeutic setting, has become one of the most common treatments in orthopedic medicine. The primary reason for using cryotherapy in acute injury management is to lower the temperature of the injured tissue, which reduces the tissue's metabolic rate and helps the tissue to survive the period following the injury. It is well documented that metabolic rate decreases by application of cryotherapy. Static compression is often used in conjunction with cryotherapy for the care of acute injuries. To date, the primary reason for using compression is to increase external pressure on the tissue to prevent edema formation (swelling). This occurs by hindering fluid loss from the vessels in the injured area, making it more difficult for fluids to accumulate. Ice with compression is significantly colder than ice alone due to improved skin contact and increased tissue density caused by extended static compression. Tissue reaches its lowest temperature faster and the tissue maintains its cool even after treatment ends. It has been studied following facial surgery where it has been found to decrease pain and swelling on day two or three. It is unclear if it affects the risk of bruising. Dr. Gabe Mirkin, inventor of the R.I.C.E. method, has retracted himself of this therapy. He wrote in 2015, ¬´Why ice delays recovery¬ª. Please read his testimony here : https://www.drmirkin.com/fitness/why-ice-delays-recovery.html  Devices  Continuous cold therapy devices (also called ice machines) which circulate ice water through a pad are currently the subject of class action lawsuits for skin and tissue damage caused by excessive cooling or icing time and lack of temperature control. Reported injuries range from frostbite to severe tissue damage resulting in amputation. Studies have shown that the body activates the hunting reaction after only 10 minutes of cryotherapy, at temperatures less than 49 ¬∞F (9.5 ¬∞C). The hunting response is a cycle of vasoconstriction (decreased blood flow), then vasodilation (increased blood flow) that increases the delivery of oxygen and nutrient rich blood to the tissue. Increased blood flow can slow cell death, limit tissue damage and aid in the removal of cellular debris and waste products. Under normal circumstances the hunting reaction would be essential to tissue health but only serves to increase pain, inflammation and cell death as excess blood is forced into the area.  Wraps  Cold compression wraps using either re-freezable ice or gel are a much safer product, as such products do not exceed the cooling or icing time recommended by the established medical community. Many of the ice wraps available use adjustable elastic straps to aid in compression over the injured areas. More advanced single-use wraps have guidelines to indicate how the bandage should be applied in order to achieve optimum compression required for an acute injury. Most ice wraps that use ice, have a built-in protective layer, so ice is not applied directly to the skin, which can result in a burn to the area sometimes known as a \\"cryoburn\\".

White Auditorium, commonly known as White Auditorium, is a 5,000 seat multi-purpose arena in Emporia, Kansas. It is home to the Emporia State University men's and women's basketball teams, as well as the volleyball team. History The Emporia Civic Auditorium's ‚Äì as it was known from 1940 to 1973 ‚Äì construction began to in December 1938. On May 6, 1940, the City of Emporia kicked off a five-day \\"Fiestaval\\" to celebrate its opening. In 1963, it was renamed to its current name, William L. White Auditorium, named after local newspaper owner, William Lindsay White, who was also the son of William Allen White. In December 1940, the Teachers College basketball team began playing their home games at the Auditorium, and in 1974 for the Emporia State Lady Hornets basketball games have been played there as well. When the volleyball program was established in 1973, it began to play its home games in White Auditorium. The building also hosts the Kansas State High School Activities Association state basketball tournament since 1955. Upgrades During the 1994‚Äì95 basketball season, the Auditorium was renovated and bleacher seating was added to the south end of the court, expanding the seating capacity from 3,700 to 5,000. In 2008, White Auditorium went under renovation. A new color scheme was painted throughout the building, new scoreboards were added, the basketball court was refinished, and new seats replaced the wooden seats in the upper Auditorium. Slaymaker Court On February 20, 2013, the Emporia City Commission voted to name the floor of White Auditorium, Coach Slay, Ron Slaymaker Court, named after longtime men's basketball coach and ESU's winningest coach. On February 28, 2013, one week later, during the halftime of the men's ESU-Washburn game, Ron Slaymaker, and his family, alongside ESU President Michael D. Shonrock, ESU Athletic Director Kent Weiser, and the Mayor of Emporia, Bobbi Mlynar, unveiled the design of Ron Slaymaker Court, debuting in the fall of 2013.

Dystroglycan is one of the dystrophin-associated glycoproteins, which is encoded by a 5.5 kb transcript in Homo sapiens on chromosome 3. There are two exons that are separated by a large intron. The spliced exons code for a protein product that is finally cleaved into two non-covalently associated subunits, [alpha] (N-terminal) and [beta] (C-terminal).  Function  In skeletal muscle the dystroglycan complex works as a transmembrane linkage between the extracellular matrix and the cytoskeleton. [alpha]-dystroglycan is extracellular and binds to merosin [alpha]-2 laminin in the basement membrane, while [beta]-dystroglycan is a transmembrane protein and binds to dystrophin, which is a large rod-like cytoskeletal protein, absent in Duchenne muscular dystrophy patients. Dystrophin binds to intracellular actin cables. In this way, the dystroglycan complex, which links the extracellular matrix to the intracellular actin cables, is thought to provide structural integrity in muscle tissues. The dystroglycan complex is also known to serve as an agrin receptor in muscle, where it may regulate agrin-induced acetylcholine receptor clustering at the neuromuscular junction. There is also evidence which suggests the function of dystroglycan as a part of the signal transduction pathway because it is shown that Grb2, a mediator of the Ras-related signal pathway, can interact with the cytoplasmic domain of dystroglycan.  Expression  Dystroglycan is widely distributed in non-muscle tissues as well as in muscle tissues. During epithelial morphogenesis of kidney, the dystroglycan complex is shown to act as a receptor for the basement membrane. Dystroglycan expression in Mus musculus brain and neural retina has also been reported. However, the physiological role of dystroglycan in non-muscle tissues remains unclear.  Interactions  Dystroglycan has been shown to interact with FYN, C-src tyrosine kinase, Src, NCK1, Grb2, Caveolin 3 and SHC1.

The sexes are similar. The female has greenish black upperparts and yellowish throat. The young bird is duller than the adult and has a shorter crest. It is the only member of the monotypic genus Melanochlora, which is fairly distinct from the Parus tits with the nearest relative being the monotypic Sylviparus. Description The male has the forehead and crown with the crest brilliant yellow; the whole upper plumage, sides of the head and neck, chin, throat, and breast deep black glossed with green, the edges of the feathers of the upper plumage with a metallic lustre, and the outermost tail-feathers tipped with white; lower plumage from the breast downwards deep yellow, the thighs barred or mottled with white. The recumbent crest is raised when the bird is alert or alarmed. M. s. sultanea from Mahananda Wildlife Sanctuary. The female has the yellow parts duller; the upper plumage and sides of the head dark greenish-brown; the chin and throat glossed dark olive-green; wings and tail dull black; the feathers of the upper plumage edged with metallic green. The young resemble the female, but in the youngest stage the bright edges to the plumage of the upper parts are absent, and the greater wing-coverts are edged with white. They forage in the mid and upper canopy singly or in small groups mainly and feed mainly on insects but sometimes feed on figs. Their loud calls with short repeated and variable whistling notes have a tit-like quality. The flight is slow and fluttery. The bill is black; the mouth dark fleshy; the eyelids grey; the iris dark brown; the legs are grey; the claws dark horn. The length is about 8 inches; the tail measures 3.8 inches; the wing 4.4 inches; the tarsus 0.95 inches; the bill from the gape 0.75 inches. Taxonomy and systematics In 1890, Richard Bowdler Sharpe considered this species as a member of the former subfamily Liotrichinae within the Timaliidae. The position of this species within its clade is still not clearly established. They appear to have distinctive mtDNA cytochrome b sequences, suggesting that they might not belong to the Paridae unless the penduline tits are included. They show an unusual behaviour of panicking in captivity when they encounter unusual noise or other species which has been said to be unlike that of typical Paridae members. Unlike other Paridae, they have their nostrils exposed and not covered by feathers. Distribution Race gayeti has a black crest Four subspecies are recognized with the nominate sultanea (Hodgson, 1837) found from Central Nepal into the eastern Himalayas extending into Myanmar, northern Thailand and Southern China. This intergrades with the race flavocristata (Lafresnaye, 1837) is found further south in Thailand, the Malay Peninsula and Hainan. Race seorsa is found in Laos and parts of southeastern China (Guangxi, Fujian) and in its northern range intergrades with sultanea. Subspecies gayeti named after the collector M.V. Gayet-Laroche by Delacour & Jabouille in 1925 has a black crest in both males and females and is found in Laos and Vietnam. In India, this species occurs in the lower ranges of the Himalayas from Nepal to the head of the Assam valley, the Khasi hills, Cachar, Manipur, the Kakhyen hills east of Bhamo, Arrakan, the Pegu hills, Karennee, and Tenasserim. This species does not appear to be found above 4000 feet of elevation. It extends down the Malay peninsula. It frequents the larger trees in small flocks. In some forest areas such as the Buxa Tiger Reserve, the density has been estimated at around 15 per square kilometre. The breeding season in India is April to July and the clutch is of seven eggs laid inside a lined tree cavity. They feed on caterpillars and sometimes small berries. Widely distributed within suitable habitats throughout its large range, the Sultan Tit is evaluated as Least Concern on the IUCN Red List of Threatened Species.

He was signed by the Cleveland Browns as an undrafted free agent in 2010. He played college football at Alabama. Named for his father, he is called Leigh to distinguish him from Van Tiffin. College career Tiffin, who wore number 99 for the Alabama Crimson Tide, got his chance to kick as a freshman following a groin injury to starting kicker Jamie Christensen. Tiffin was a hero, kicking the game-winning 47‚Äìyard field goal, in Alabama's 13‚Äì10 win over Vanderbilt on September 9, 2006. However, two weeks later against a very strong Arkansas team, he would miss three field goals in a 24‚Äì23 overtime loss, including the game-tying extra point. Christensen returned to the role the following week against Florida and except for two extra points against Florida International. Tiffin would be benched for the remainder of the season. In 2007, he won the starting placekicking role over Christensen. The highlight of his sophomore year was when he went 4‚Äì4 in field goal attempts (39, 51, 29, 50) in a losing effort against Mississippi State. He was only the second kicker in Alabama football history to make two 50+ yard field goals in a game, the other being his father. His four kicks were Alabama's only points of the game. He finished the 2007 season converting all 36 extra point attempts and 25 of 34 field goal attempts. In the 2008 Chick-fil-A College Kickoff, Tiffin kicked a 54‚Äìyard field goal, his career long, in a 34‚Äì10 victory over #9-ranked Clemson. He finished the season with 20 of 29 field goals and a semifinalist for the Lou Groza Award. For the 2009 season, he was 30 for 35 on field goal attempts for 87.9 percent. After kicking a field goal against LSU, he became Alabama's all-time leading scorer with 350 points. That year, he was named Lou Groza Award \\"Star of the Week\\" three times and was a finalist for the Groza. In mid-December, Tiffin was named to the Associated Press All-American Team along with five other Crimson Tide players. Professional career Cleveland Browns Tiffin was given a tryout with the Cleveland Browns as an undrafted free agent and agreed to a rookie free agent deal on May 3, 2010. He was waived/injured on May 18 and reverted to injured reserve. He was released from injured reserve with an injury settlement on May 26. Personal life Tiffin, born in Muscle Shoals, Alabama, is the son of Mia Michelle (n√©e Self) and Van Leigh Tiffin. His father, known as Van, was a former Crimson Tide kicker who was the hero of the 1985 Iron Bowl against rival Auburn. Leigh Tiffin graduated from Muscle Shoals High School.

It was built in 1959,Shotwell Stadium using Rice Stadium as a model.GoFridayNight.com Champions Classic It was initially named the Public Schools Stadium. The first game played in the Stadium was in the fall of 1959. Shortly after the first season, the stadium was renamed Shotwell Stadium, after the late P.E. ‚ÄúPete‚Äù Shotwell, a longtime football coach at Abilene High School.AISD - Facilities Size and uses Shotwell Stadium is primarily used for American football and soccer. Each of the stadium's two concrete grandstands has a permanent seating capacity of 7,500 in an all-bleacher configuration. Several semi-permanent metal bleacher structures are located behind the north end zone, allowing for overflow seating in excess of the facility's 15,000 permanent seats. There are also standing room-only areas at the corners of the stadium, raising total capacity to nearly 20,000. Shotwell Stadium is the home field of Abilene High School and Cooper High School. The Abilene High/Cooper High rivalry game is played here every year and always fills the stadium. The stadium was long home to NCAA football. The Abilene Christian University Wildcats football team, currently a member of NCAA Division I FCS, played at Shotwell from 1959 through 2016. ACU opened a new on-campus stadium for the 2017 season. Shotwell was for many years the \\"informal\\" designated site for the six-man football championships of the University Interscholastic League, which governs sports competition among public high schools in Texas (as the majority of six-man schools are in West Texas). In 2010, it was formally designated as the championship site. During 2013-2014 the title games moved to AT&T; Stadium but returned in 2015 to Shotwell, as AT&T; Stadium was unavailable due to a conflict with a Dallas Cowboys home game. Turf FieldTurf's newest top-of- the-line product, FieldTurf Revolution, was installed in Spring 2012, replacing the worn SafePlay turf installed a decade earlier. Prior to 2002, Shotwell had natural grass turf. Lighting Shotwell is equipped with Musco lighting, with two light standards on each side of the field. The current lighting system was installed following the collapse of one of the original lighting structures in 2009. The remnants of the stadium's original lighting design can still be seen today. Four concrete columns rise above each of the main grandstands. The eight columns served as the base of the original stadium light poles. History The longest field goal in the history of all levels of organized football was kicked at Shotwell Stadium. On October 16, 1976, Ove Johannson, the Swedish-born placekicker for Abilene Christian University, kicked a 69-yard field goal against East Texas State in ACU's homecoming win against the Lions. This is currently the record for longest recorded field goal in football history.field goal: Information and Much More from Answers.comACU Today - Fall 2001 Second Glance Improvements In the spring of 2002, the Abilene ISD Board of Trustees approved an exclusive vendor contract with Abtex Beverage Corporation, which provided funding for major renovations to the stadium. The initial upgrades included the installation of SafePlay turf, the latest generation of artificial playing surface for athletic fields. The new turf, drain system, access ramps, goalposts, and other changes were completed in late summer of 2002, in time for the 2002 football season. In August 2003, as a result of corporate sponsorship, a state-of-the-art scoreboard with an integrated color animation screen was installed on the north end. The south end scoreboard was upgraded and integrated with the new scoreboard. As a result, Shotwell Stadium became one of only a few high school stadiums in Texas with two scoreboards.

The core focus of these business units was logistic integration and consultancy. History The company was founded in 1967 by R. Milhous Hoboct, a Czech-English engineer and entrepreneur. It found some significant successes in its BSDN and Checkpoint logistics systems; however due to a number of regulatory obstacles and failed business endeavours, a decision was made to dissolve the company in November 1997. Business Alliances Groupe DSO was a member of the FALO alliance, a close-knit set of companies providing reciprocal services. The FALO alliance comprised: * Groupe DSO: logistics and engineering integration * BSDN (a spin- off of the DSO BSDN business unit) * Pacific-East: legal services * SBU: financial services Business Units The organisational structure of Groupe DSO was of a number of small business units, each with a clearly defined purpose and goal. Central financial and administrative management was controlled by a holding company named DSO Centraal. DSO BSDN The Bow- Scott Distribution Network, named after its creators, Ashleigh Bow and Dr. Shalain Scott, provided an integrated 'end-to-end' solution to the distribution of large volumes of data by traditional courier means. The BSDN business unit was an incubator initiative whose aim was to provide start-up capital for DSO's core businesses: logistic and engineering consultancy. After wild success and rapid expansion, it was later spun off as a separate entity in 1979. The now-independent BSDN faced trouble in the 1990s, when company- wide computer networks and the Internet rendered its business model obsolete. DSO Checkpoint ('Checkpoint Charlie') After the spinoff of the BSDN business unit, Groupe DSO sought to apply its logistic expertise to niche markets. It found most success in academia, where the DSO Checkpoint system was used by many libraries for transporting books and other media between branches. Workers often referred to the system as Checkpoint Charlie due to the strict, well-documented procedures that ensured its efficiency and reliability. DSO CBS The DSO CBS (Consultancy and Business Support) division provided business consultancy on leveraging technology to improve workplace logistics and operations. A large number of Indonesian clients allowed for a local subsidiary to be established, P.T. DSO Logisti. DSO EPI The DSO EPI (Electro-Pyro Initiative) was a small, relatively short- lived business unit that was created in response to a government tender for safe physics teaching aids. (Himself an engineer, R. M. Hoboct was passionate about science education through practical and applied learning.) Although the tender was not successful, this unit enjoyed moderate success with its 240 series of electricity teaching apparatus; and Big Joe, a safety chamber that allowed otherwise dangerous laboratory experiments to be conducted at greatly reduced risk. One commercial spinoff of the \\"Big Joe\\" project was the development of a highly puncture-proof design for food cans. In practice, however, these were little improvement over existing tin cans. DSO Trabaction DSO Trabaction was a division proposed and set up by Derek Helmutiffe; a DSO employee living in Germany, and keen Trabant enthusiast. This division helped facilitate and organise the supply of Trabant parts to enthusiasts across Western Germany, after the fall of the Berlin Wall and German Reunification. After Helmutiffe's migration to Australia in 1995, the division closed. Trivia Groupe DSO was a minor sponsor of Ukyo Katayama's Tyrrell Formula One car in .

Prior to 1996, the stadium was named \\"East Texas State Memorial Stadium, and until the end of the 2017 season, it was known as Texas A&M-Commerce; Memorial Stadium.\\" The stadium was built in honor of the 78 Texas A&M-Commerce; alums and students who fought and died during World War II. The stadium was renamed Ernest Hawkins Field at Memorial Stadium was formally changed in November 2017 in honor of longtime Lion football coach Ernest Hawkins. Stadium history Memorial Stadium began as a project of the Ex-Students Association in the fall of 1945. The ESA and friends of the University raised a portion of the funds before the University itself received a state appropriation for the rest of the $300,000 to build the facility. Construction on the facility was started in the fall of 1949 and work continued quickly to have the stadium ready for the start of the 1950 season.Memorial Stadium (TAMUC) The stadium was opened and dedicated on Sept. 23, 1950 with a game against regional rival the University of North Texas. The dedication ceremony featured U.S. Speaker of the House and Texas A&M; Commerce alumnus Sam Rayburn and former Texas lieutenant governor Walter Woodul. General Douglas MacArthur, while not in attendance, wrote to then University President James Gee that \\"I am delighted and honored,\\" to have his quotation affixed to the plaque honoring the Lions fallen comrades. That quote, also chiseled on the stadium at the U.S. Military Academy at West Point, is a famous one: \\"Upon the fields of friendly strife, are sown the seeds that, Upon other fields, on other days, will bear the fruits of victory.\\" The Lions and Eagles played before a capacity crowd of 12,000 fans from all over North Texas that night as the Eagles came out on top 42‚Äì20. It has proven over the history of the Stadium to be one of the few home losses for Lion football, as they have won nearly 70 percent of the games they have played at home. In 1996, when the Texas A&M; University System purchased East Texas State University, the name was changed from ETSU Memorial Stadium to Texas A&M; University-Commerce Memorial Stadium.

Also, fewer visitor fans were making the trip to Commerce due to the expanding distance between the conference schools. The result was reducing the capacity of the stadium to 10,000 fans. *1980 ‚Äì An All-Weather rubberized surface track was installed, replacing the cinder surface. *1987 ‚Äì A new ticket booth was placed at the main entrance of the stadium. *1999 ‚Äì New stadium lighting fixtures were installed and the scoreboard updated with local sponsorships. *2006 ‚Äì The natural grass surface was replaced with a FieldTurf artificial playing surface, a new digital messaging scoreboard was installed and replaced the previous scoreboard. The track was also repaved and the press box was decorated with a bold print message that reads HOME OF THE LIONS. *2010 ‚Äì The east side stands were replaced with new seating technology that increased the capacity to 13,500. The new stadium also added an east side press box, new restrooms and concessions, a new dressing and locker room for the Lion Football program at the north end of the stadium and the T-Lounge was demolished. A Daktronics video jumbotron scoreboard was installed that at the time of completion the largest video board in all of NCAA Division II athletics. *2013 ‚Äì The playing surface is replaced again, this time showing a large Lion head that stretches 50 yards long and 50 yards wide, making it possibly the largest on site logo in the entire world according to the Guinness Book of World Records. The west side is also renovated, adding nearly 500 reserved section seats for season ticket holders and also has various cosmetic improvements around the stadium. *2014 ‚Äì The school athletic department creates a corporate sponsorship with Ben E. Keith and GoodSport and puts new signage on the outer facade of the stadium honoring the 1972 National Championship team, and individual murals for former Lions Bobby Bounds, Gary Compton, Ernest Hawkins, Tevin Moore, and Billy Watkins, honoring the records they hold for the school.

The May Thirtieth Movement () was a major labor and anti-imperialist movement during the middle-period of the Republic of China era. It began when the British Shanghai Municipal Police opened fire on Chinese protesters in Shanghai's International Settlement on May 30, 1925 (the Shanghai massacre of 1925). The shootings sparked international censure and nationwide anti-foreign demonstrations and riots. Roots of the Incident In the aftermath of 1924's Second Zhili‚ÄìFengtian War China found itself in the midst of one of the most destructive periods of turmoil since 1911.Waldron, Arthur, (1991) From War to Nationalism: China's Turning Point, p. 5. The war had involved every major urban area in China, and badly damaged the rural infrastructure. As a result of the conflict the Zhili-controlled government, backed by varied Euro- American business interests, was ousted from power by pro-Japanese warlord Zhang Zuolin, who installed a government led by the generally unpopular statesman Duan Qirui in November 1924. Though victorious, the war left Zhang's central government bankrupt and Duan exercised little authority outside Beijing. Authority in the north of the country was divided between Zhang and Feng Yuxiang, a Soviet Union-backed warlord, and public support for the northern militarists soon hit an all-time low, with southerners openly disparaging provincial governors as junfa (warlords). With his monarchist leanings and strong base in conservative Manchuria, Zhang represented the far right in Chinese politics and could claim few supporters. Meanwhile, the KMT (Nationalist) and Communist parties (allied as the First United Front) were running a diplomatically unrecognized Soviet-backed administration in the southern province of Guangdong. Alongside public grief at the recent death of China's Republican hero Sun Yat-sen (12 March 1925), the KMT sought to foment pro-Chinese, anti-imperial and anti-western organizations and propaganda within major Chinese cities.Ku, Hung-Ting [1979] (1979). Urban Mass Movement: The May Thirtieth Movement in Shanghai. Modern Asian Studies, Vol.13, No.2. pp.197-216 Chinese Communist Party groups were particularly involved in sowing dissent in Shanghai through the far-left Shanghai University. Shanghai's native Chinese were strongly unionised compared to other cities and better educated, and recognised their plight as involving lack of legal factory inspection, recourse for worker grievances or equal rights.B.L [1936] (Jul 15, 1936). Shanghai at Last Gets Factory Inspection Law. Far Eastern Survey, Vol.5, No.15. Many Chinese families were also aggrieved by an upcoming Child Employment Bill, proposed by the Shanghai Municipal Council, that would have stopped children under the age of 12 from working in mills and factories (many working-class homes relied on wages brought in by children). Educated Chinese were also offended by the council's plan to introduce a new censorship law, forcing all publications in the Settlement to use the publisher's true name and address. In early months of 1925, conflicts and strikes on those matters intensified. Japanese-owned cotton mills were a source of contention, and fights and demonstrations between Japanese and Chinese employees around the #8 Cotton Mill became regular occurrences. In February a group of Japanese managers were attacked while leaving work and one of them was killed. In response, Japanese foremen took to carrying pistols while on duty. The escalation of ill-feeling culminated on May 15, when during a violent Neo- Luddite-style riot inside the mill, a Japanese foreman shot a demonstrator named Ku Chen-Hung dead.Ku, Hung-Ting [1979] (1979). Urban Mass Movement: The May Thirtieth Movement in Shanghai. Modern Asian Studies, Vol.13, No.2. pp.201 Over the following weeks Ku Chen-Hung became viewed as a martyr by Chinese unions and student groups (though not by the Chinese authorities or the middle-class, who noted his political affiliations and close family membership to a prominent criminal gang). Numerous protests and strikes subsequently began against Japanese-run industries. A week later a group of Chinese students, heading for Ku's public \\"state\\" funeral and carrying banners, were arrested while traveling through the International Settlement. With their trial set for May 30, various student organisations convened in the days before and decided to hold mass demonstrations across the International Settlement and outside the Mixed Court. The Nanjing Road Incident On the morning of May 30, 1925, just after the trial of the arrested students began, Shanghai Municipal Police arrested 15 ringleaders of a student protest being held on and around Nanking Road, in the foreign-controlled International Settlement. The protesters were held in Louza (Laozha) police station, which by 2:45 pm was facing a \\"huge crowd\\" of Chinese that had amassed outside. The demonstrators demanded the arrested ringleaders be returned to them and in a number of cases entered the police station, where (according to SMP officers) they tried to either block the foyer or gain access to the cells. Police on Nanking Road reported the crowd, which was between 1,500-2,000 strong, started good-naturedly but became more aggressive as arrests were made. After forcing protesters out of the charge room, a picket of police (there was only a skeleton staff of approximately two dozen officers overall, predominantly Sikh and Chinese, with three British officers) was set up to prevent demonstrators from entering the station. In the minutes before the shooting, police and some witnesses reported that cries of \\"kill the foreigners\\" were raised as the demonstration turned violent.Potter, Edna Lee (1940). News Is My Job: A Correspondent in War-Torn China. Macmillan publishing. p. 198Bickers, Robert [2003] (2003). Empire Made Me: An Englishman Adrift in Shanghai. Allen Lane publishing. . p. 165 Inspector Edward Everson, station commander and the highest-ranking officer on the scene (as the police commissioner K.J. McEuen had not let early warnings of public demonstrations interfere with his attendance at the city's Race Club) eventually shouted, \\"Stop! If you do not stop I will shoot!\\" in Wu. A few seconds later, at 3:37 pm, and as the crowd was within six feet of the station entrance, he fired into the crowd with his revolver. The Sikh and Chinese policemen then also opened fire, unleashing some 40 rounds. At least four demonstrators were killed at the scene, with another five dying later of their injuries. At least 14 injured were hospitalized, with many others wounded.Carroll, John Mark Carroll. [2007] (2007). A concise history of Hong Kong. Rowman & Littlefield publishing. , . p. 100 Strikes and martial law On Sunday, May 31, crowds of students posted bills and demanded shops refuse to sell foreign goods or serve non- Chinese. They then convened at the Chinese Chamber of Commerce, where they gave a list of demands, including punishment of the officers involved in the shooting, an end to extraterritoriality and closure of the Shanghai International Settlement. The president of the Chamber of Commerce was away, but eventually his deputy agreed to press for the demands to be carried out. Nevertheless, he subsequently sent a message to the foreign Municipal Council that his consent was given under duress. The Municipal Council declared a state of martial law on Monday, June 1, calling up the Shanghai Volunteer Corps militia and requesting foreign military assistance to carry out raids and protect vested interests. Over the next month Shanghai businesses and workers went on strike, and there were sporadic outbreaks of demonstration and violence. Trams and foreigners were attacked, and there was looting of shops that refused to uphold the boycott of foreigners. Servants to foreigners refused to work, and almost a third of Chinese police failed to turn up for their shifts. The gas works, electricity station, waterworks and telephone exchange became entirely run by Western volunteers. The numbers of Chinese killed and injured in the May 30 Movement's riots vary: figures normally vary between 30 and 200 dead, with hundreds injured. Policemen, firemen and foreigners were also injured, some seriously, and one Chinese police constable was killed. Aftermath The incident shocked and galvanized China, and the strikes and boycotts, coupled with further violent demonstrations and riots, quickly spread across the country, bringing foreign economic interests to a near standstill. The 15 \\"ringleaders\\" originally arrested on May 30 were given light or suspended sentences by Shanghai's foreign-run Mixed Court. The target of public ire moved from the Japanese (for the death of Ku Chen-Hung) to the British, and Hong Kong was particularly affected (the strikes were there known as the Canton-Hong Kong strike). Further shootings by foreigners upon Chinese protesters occurred at Canton, Mukden and elsewhere, although a reported incident at Nanking that became a cause c√©l√®bre for anti-imperialists was apparently carried out by local Chinese authorities. Indeed, the Chinese warlords used the incident as a pretext to further their own political aims. While Feng Yuxiang threatened to attack British interests militarily and demanded a national apology, Zhang Zuolin, who effectively controlled Shanghai's Chinese outskirts, had his police and soldiers arrest protesters and Communists and assist the Settlement forces. Two investigations into the events of May 30 were ordered, one by Chinese authorities and one by international appointees, Justice Finley Johnson (presiding), Judge of the Court of First Instance in the Philippines (representing America), Sir Henry Gollan, Chief Justice of Hong Kong (representing Britain) and Justice Kisaburo Suga of the Hiroshima Court of Appeal (representing Japan). The Chinese authorities refused to participate in the international investigation, which found 2-1 that the shooting justifiable. Only the Justice Finley from America disagreed and recommended sweeping changes, including the retirement of the chief of the Settlement Police, Commissioner McEuen, and Inspector Everson. Their forced resignation in late-1925 would be the only official result of the inquiry. By November, with Chiang Kai-shek having finally wrested power from his rivals after Sun Yat-sen's death and with Chinese businesses wishing to return to operation (the Settlement had begun cutting electricity to Chinese mills), the strikes and protests began to fizzle out. In Hong Kong, however, they would not totally end until mid-1926. The Kuomintang's support for the movement, and its Northern Expedition of 1926‚Äì27, eventually led to reforms in the governance of the International Settlement's Shanghai Municipal Council and the beginning of the removal of the Unequal Treaties. The May Thirtieth events caused the transfer of the Muslim Chengda College and Imam (Ahong) Ma Songting to Beijing. Memorial In the 1990s, the May Thirtieth Movement Monument was installed at People's Park.

Each operation covered by the medal was represented by a clasp on the ribbon; by the time it was replaced in 2002, four clasps had been issued, covering operations between 1956 and 1991. The medal was never issued without a clasp. The NZGSM 1992 was issued in two varieties - one for warlike service, and another for non-warlike service. Warlike operations were commemorated by this medal, humanitarian and peacekeeping operations were commemorated by the NZGSM 1992 (Non-Warlike) in bronze. The design and colours of the ribbon were based upon the New Zealand Medal of 1869, thus are directly linked with the beginnings of New Zealand‚Äôs military history. As the first occasion upon which New Zealand had issued a war or warlike service medal outside of the two World Wars or the Vietnam War it was considered that the link with the first military campaigns in New Zealand best reflected New Zealand‚Äôs military heritage.

The protein encoded by this gene is a component of the cytoskeleton. Utrophin was found during research into Duchenne's muscular dystrophy. The name is a contraction for ubiquitous dystrophin. The 900 kb gene for utrophin is found on the long arm of human chromosome 6. Utrophin was discovered due to its homology with dystrophin. It was found by screening a peptide containing the C-terminal domain of dystrophin against cDNA libraries. The homology varies over its full length from less than 30% in regions of the central rod structural domain to 85% (identity 73%) for the actin binding domain. The tertiary structure of utrophin contains a C-terminus that consists of protein‚Äìprotein interaction motifs that interact with dystroglycan, a central rod region consisting of a triple coiled-coil repeat, and an actin-binding N-terminus. In normal muscle cells, utrophin is located at the neuromuscular synapse and myotendinous junctions. It is necessary for normal membrane maintenance, and for the clustering of the acetylcholine receptor. In adult humans, utrophin RNA is found ubiquitously, as the name implies, being abundant in the brain, kidney, liver, lung, muscle, spleen and stomach. In the human fetus during muscle differentiation, utrophin is found at the sarcolemma. It disappears when the fetus begins to express dystrophin. Utrophin expression is dramatically increased in patients with Duchenne's muscular dystrophy (and female carriers), both in those muscle fibers lacking dystrophin and in rare, revertant fibers that express dystrophin. No reports have yet associated mutation in the utrophin gene with disease, but it does not seem to play a critical role in development, since mice without utrophin develop normally.

The cold trap is on the right Close-up view, showing the double-oblique stopcock, which allows vacuum (rear line) or inert gas (front line) to be selected The Schlenk line (also vacuum gas manifold) is a commonly used chemistry apparatus developed by Wilhelm Schlenk. It consists of a dual manifold with several ports. One manifold is connected to a source of purified inert gas, while the other is connected to a vacuum pump. The inert-gas line is vented through an oil bubbler, while solvent vapors and gaseous reaction products are prevented from contaminating the vacuum pump by a liquid-nitrogen or dry-ice/acetone cold trap. Special stopcocks or Teflon taps allow vacuum or inert gas to be selected without the need for placing the sample on a separate line. Schlenk lines are useful for safely and successfully manipulating moisture- and air-sensitive compounds. The vacuum is also often used to remove the last traces of solvent from a sample. Vacuum and gas manifolds often have many ports and lines, and with care, it is possible for several reactions or operations to be run simultaneously. When the reagents are highly susceptible to oxidation, traces of oxygen may pose a problem. Then, for the removal of oxygen below the ppm level, the inert gas needs to be purified by passing it through a deoxygenation catalyst.C. R. McIlwrick and C. S. Phillips The removal of oxygen from gas streams: applications in catalysis and gas chromatography, Journal of Physics E: Scientific Instruments, 1973, 6:12, 1208‚Äì10. This is usually a column of copper(I) or manganese(II) oxide, which reacts with oxygen traces present in the inert gas. Techniques The main techniques associated with the use of a Schlenk line include: * counterflow additions, where air-stable reagents are added to the reaction vessel against a flow of inert gas; * the use of syringes and rubber septa to transfer liquids and solutions; * cannula transfer, where liquids or solutions of air-sensitive reagents are transferred between different vessels stoppered with septa using a long thin tube known as a cannula. Liquid flow is supported by vacuum or inert-gas pressure.Brown, H. C. \\"Organic Syntheses via Boranes\\" John Wiley & Sons, Inc., New York: 1975. . Glassware are usually connected by tightly fitting and greased ground glass joints. Round bends of glass tubing with ground glass joints may be used to adjust the orientation of various vessels. Glassware is necessarily purged of outside air by alternating application of vacuum and inert gas. The solvents and reagents that are used are also purged of air and water using various methods. Filtration under inert conditions poses a special challenge that is usually tackled with specialized glassware. A Schlenk filter consists of sintered glass funnel fitted with joints and stopcocks. By fitting the pre- dried funnel and receiving flask to the reaction flask against a flow of nitrogen, carefully inverting the set-up, and turning on the vacuum appropriately, the filtration may be accomplished with minimal exposure to air. Dangers The main dangers associated with the use of a Schlenk line are the risks of an implosion or explosion. An implosion can occur due to the use of vacuum and flaws in the glass apparatus. An explosion can occur due to the common use of liquid nitrogen in the cold trap, used to protect the vacuum pump from solvents. If a reasonable amount of air is allowed to enter the Schlenk line, liquid oxygen can condense into the cold trap as a pale blue liquid. An explosion may occur due to reaction of the liquid oxygen with any organic compounds also in the trap.

It is present in all cell types. When activated, it will recruit Arp2/3 complex proteins to existing actin microfilaments, facilitating and stabilizing nucleation sites for actin branching. Cortactin is important in promoting lamellipodia formation, invadopodia formation, cell migration, and endocytosis.  Gene  In humans, cortactin is encoded by the CTTN gene on chromosome 11.  Structure  Cortactin is a thin, elongated monomer that consists of an amino-terminal acidic (NTA) region; 37-residue-long segments that are highly conserved among cortactin proteins of all species and repeated up to 6.5 times in tandem (‚Äúcortactin repeats‚Äù); a proline-rich region; and an SH3 domain. This basic structure is highly conserved among all species that express cortactin.  Activation and binding  Cortactin is activated via phosphorylation, by tyrosine kinases or serine/threonine kinases, in response to extracellular signals like growth factors, adhesion sites, or pathogenic invasion of the epithelial layer. The SH3 domain of certain tyrosine kinases, such as the oncogene Src kinase, binds to cortactin's proline-rich region and phosphorylates it on Tyr421, Tyr466, and Tyr482. Once activated in this way, it can bind to filamentous actin (F-actin) with the fourth of its cortactin repeats. As the concentration of phosphorylated cortactin increases in specific regions within the cell, the monomers each begin to recruit an Arp2/3 complex to F-actin. It binds to Arp2/3 with an aspartic acid-aspartic acid- tryptophan (DDW) sequence in its NTA region, a motif that is often seen in other actin nucleation-promoting factors (NPFs). Certain serine/threonine kinases, such as ERK, can phosphorylate cortactin on Ser405 and Ser418 in the SH3 domain. Activated like this, it still associates with Arp2/3 and F-actin, but will also allow other actin NPFs, most importantly N-WASp (Neuronal Wiskott-Aldrich syndrome protein), to bind to the complex as well; when phosphorylated by tyrosine kinases, other NPFs are excluded. The ability of these other NPFs to bind the Arp2/3 complex while cortactin is also bound could come from new interactions with cortactin's SH3 domain, which is in a different conformation when phosphorylated by Ser/Thr kinases and thus may be more open to interactions with other NPFs. Having other NPFs bind to the Arp2/3 complex at the same time as cortactin may enhance nucleation site stability.  Location and function in the cell  Inactive cortactin diffuses throughout the cytoplasm, but upon phosphorylation, the protein begins to target certain areas in the cell. Cortactin-assisted Arp2/3-nucleated actin branches are most prominent in the actin cortex, around the periphery of the cell. A phosphorylated cortactin monomer binds to, activates, and stabilizes an Arp2/3 complex on preexisting F-actin, which provides a nucleation site for a new actin branch to form from the ‚Äúmother‚Äù filament. Branches formed from cortactin-assisted nucleation sites are very stable; cortactin has been shown to inhibit debranching. Thus, polymerization and branching of actin is promoted in areas of the cell where cortactin is localized. Cortactin is very active in lamellipodia, protrusions of the cell membrane formed by actin polymerization and treadmilling that propel the cell along a surface as it migrates towards some target. Cortactin acts as a link between extracellular signals and lamellipodial ‚Äústeering.‚Äù When a receptor tyrosine kinase on the cell membrane binds to an adhesion site, for example, cortactin will be phosphorylated locally to the area of binding, activate and recruit Arp2/3 to the actin cortex in that region, and thus stimulate cortical actin polymerization and movement of the cell in that direction. Macrophages, highly motile immune cells that engulf cellular debris and pathogens, are propelled by lamellipodia and identify/migrate toward a target via chemotaxis; thus, cortactin must also be activated by receptor kinases that pick up a large variety of chemical signals. Studies have implicated cortactin in both clathrin-mediated endocytosis and clathrin-independent endocytosis. In both kinds of endocytosis, it has long been known that actin localizes to sites of vesicle invagination and is a vital part of the endocytic pathway, but the actual mechanisms by which actin facilitates endocytosis are still unclear. Recently, however, it has been found that dynamin, the protein responsible for breaking the newly formed vesicular bud off the inside of the plasma membrane, can associate with the SH3 domain of cortactin. Since cortactin recruits the Arp2/3 complexes that lead to actin polymerization, this suggests that it may play an important part in linking vesicle formation to the as yet unknown functions actin has in endocytosis.  Clinical significance  Amplification of the genes encoding cortactin‚Äîin humans, EMS1‚Äîhas been found to occur in certain tumors. Overexpression of cortactin can lead to highly-active lamellipodia in tumor cells, dubbed ‚Äúinvadopodia.‚Äù These cells are especially invasive and migratory, making them very dangerous, for they can easily spread cancer across the body into other tissues.  Interactions  Cortactin has been shown to interact with: * ACTR3 * ARPC2, * CTNND1, * FER, * KCNA2, * SHANK2, * WASL, and * WIPF1.

Systematic vehicle production started in 1968 (although its predecessors had been building bus and truck bodies before World War II), while the company built a modern vehicle assembly factory in the north of Athens in 1971. A large number of Mazda, Opel and, later, Alfa Romeo models were assembled ‚Äì usually with a significant proportion of parts locally produced. The company also introduced modified versions of Mazda trucks, including longer versions of the B1500 and B1600 light trucks. A number of the latter was also produced with the company‚Äôs own Grezda brand name in the early 1980s (the name stands for \\"Greek\\" and \\"Mazda\\"), mostly for export. Emporiki Autokiniton was seriously affected by problems largely connected with the labor unrest of the 1980s in Greece and production was eventually terminated in 1985, after a failed attempt to produce a jeep and a 2-tonne truck type of own development. This evolution in a way represented the fate of the Greek vehicle producing sector, which, except for the \\"indigenous\\" companies, included a number of companies involved in vehicle assembly and license production. In the early 1980s conditions in Greece seemed favorable for the expansion of this activity, and a number of foreign companies (including Hyundai, during its early steps in Europe) had expressed interest in creating assembly and production facilities in the country. However, a number of reasons, the most important of which being the lack of interest of Greek governments in the particular industrial sector, lead to its decline and virtual disappearance. In 1995, Teocar, the largest Greek vehicle assembly company ceased production after 170,000 Nissans/Datsuns had been produced; its state-of-the-art factory in Volos, modernized only a few years earlier, was dismantled and sold to Russia.

The soundtrack album consists of seven instrumental tracks by Young, with dialog excerpts from the film and Johnny Depp reading the poetry of William Blake interspersed between the music. The version of the main theme used over the film's beginning and end credits is not included,Dead Man: Neil Young Amazon staff review. but was released as a promo single.Neil Young's Rare & Unreleased Songs The soundtrack differs from the film in that it uses background noises of a driving car while the whole plot is set in the 19th century (before automobiles were invented). Pitchfork ranked the soundtrack at 15 on their 50 Best Movie Scores of All Time list, saying that \\"Old Black is featured in its purest form on the soundtrack for Jim Jarmusch‚Äôs hallucinatory western Dead Man.

In addition to a standard CD release, a \\"special edition\\" was released, which was bound in a customized cover. Made to look like a 19th-century photo album, the spine is covered in a mauve-brown cloth and the cover itself is a black laminated cardboard. The booklet normally included in the CD is bound in this \\"book\\" along with a cardboard folder to hold the disc itself. A reissue of the album was released on 8 March 2019. In addition, the album is available for streaming in 24bit/44.1 kHz quality on Neil Young Archives website. Track listing Track names aren't listed anywhere on the physical copies of the album. \\"Theme from Dead Man\\" The main theme of the film, an instrumental tune featuring acoustic and electric guitar which plays during opening and closing credits, wasn't included on the soundtrack album (although the motif is reprised throughout it).

She is an expert in the ecology and evolution of ocean microbes. Early life and education Chisholm was born in Marquette, Michigan and graduated from Marquette Senior High School in 1965. She attended Skidmore College and earned a Ph.D. from SUNY Albany in 1974. Career Chisholm has been a faculty member at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology since 1976. Her research has focused on the ecology of marine phytoplankton. Chisholm's early work focused on the processes by which such plankton take up nutrients and the manner in which this affects their life cycle on diurnal time scales. This led her to begin using flow cytometry which can be used to measure the properties of individual cells. The application of flow cytometry to environmental samples led Chisholm and her collaborators (most notably R.J. Olson and H.M. Sosik) to the discovery that small plankton (in particular Prochlorococcus and Synechococcus) accounted for a much more substantial part of marine productivity than had previously been realized. Previously, biological oceanographers had focused on silicaceous diatoms as being the most important phytoplankton, accounting for 10-20 gigatons of carbon uptake each year. Chisholm's work showed that an even larger amount of carbon was cycled through these small algae, which may also play an important role in the global nitrogen cycle. In recent years, Chisholm has played a visible role in opposing the use of iron fertilization as a technological fix for anthropogenic climate change. Awards and honors Chisholm has been a member of the United States National Academy of Sciences (NAS) since 2003 and a fellow of the American Academy of Arts and Sciences since 1992. In January 2010, she was awarded the Alexander Agassiz Medal, for \\"pioneering studies of the dominant photosynthetic organisms in the sea and for integrating her results into a new understanding of the global ocean.\\" She was a co-recipient in 2012 of the Ruth Patrick Award from the Association for the Sciences of Limnology and Oceanography. Chisholm received the National Medal of Science from President Barack Obama on February 1, 2013. In 2013, she was awarded the Ramon Margalef Prize in Ecology, ‚Äúfor being one of the most productive, charismatic and active researchers on biology and marine ecology‚Äù. On May 24, 2018, she was awarded the Doctor of Science degree by Harvard University.https://news.harvard.edu/gazette/story/2018/05/harvard-awards- seven-honorary-degrees/ In 2019 she received the Crafoord Prize in Biosciences, ‚Äúfor the discovery and pioneering studies of the most abundant photosynthesising organism on Earth, Prochlorococcus‚Äù.Crafoord Prize 2019 This prize is considered equivalent to the Nobel Prize (for which there is no Biosciences category).

It was established in 1902 and, with 118 years of publication, was the oldest continuously-circulated English-language Jewish newspaper in the United States until it suspended publication on September 25, 2020. Before May 28, 1909, it was briefly known as The Jewish Home Journal and then as The Boston Advocate. History The Jewish Advocate was founded in 1902 by Theodor Herzl, a journalist who is considered to be the founder of modern political Zionism. Shortly after founding newspapers in Vienna and Basel, Herzl sent his executive secretary, Jacob de Haas, to Boston to create The Jewish Advocate for the purposes of \\"inculcat[ing] Judaism into the community and progress[ing] the cause of the re-establishment of the Jewish faith and a Jewish state.\\" Before May 28, 1909, the newspaper was briefly known as The Jewish Home Journal and then as The Boston Advocate. In 1917, when Herzl took the position of executive director of the Zionist Organization of America, he transferred leadership of the newspaper to Alexander Brin. The newspaper operated out of the former Boston Post building in downtown Boston where the office remains located. The Jewish Advocate remains an active 501(c)3 not-for-profit organization. In the September 25, 2020 issue, The Jewish Advocate announced it would be \\"going on hiatus\\" (but keep the organization and website active), citing decreasing advertising revenue which had \\"virtually disappeared\\" due to the COVID-19 pandemic and lagging support from communal organizations and the federation. In the announcement, they also said they were developing plans to launch a digital version of the publication, and left open the possibility of resuming publication. They have also reached agreement with NewsBank to add the complete archives of The Jewish Advocate to their digital catalogue and make it available to the public through The Jewish Advocate website.

Commercial customers mainly operate in the food and beverage, chemical, life sciences, oil and gas, water and wastewater, power and energy and primaries and metals industries. In the laboratory business the group also serves customers from healthcare and academia. History The company was founded as L Hauser KG on 1 February 1953 by Swiss engineer Georg H. Endress (1924‚Äì2008) and German banker Ludwig H√§usser (1895‚Äì1975). Starting capital was a modest 2,000 deutschmarks; the first ‚Äòoperating facility‚Äô was a room in Hauser‚Äôs apartment in L√∂rrach, Germany. The business has traded under the name Endress+Hauser since 1957. In the beginning, the company sold innovative level instruments produced by the British company Fielden Electronics. Soon after, Georg H Endress started to develop his own devices. In 1955, he registered his first patent and set up a production facility. An Endress+Hauser electromagnetic flow meter at the Tetley's Brewery in Leeds, West Yorkshire. The company expanded the portfolio by adding new measurement principles and pursued business opportunities in other countries. The first foreign subsidiary was established in 1960 in the Netherlands. In 1968, a holding company was registered in Switzerland. In 1970, Endress+Hauser entered the US and Japanese markets. In 1975, co-founder Ludwig Hauser died; the Endress family became sole shareholder. In the following years, the company expanded its offering through acquisitions and start-ups. Measurement value recording, liquid analysis and flow measurement engineering were added as new fields of activity, followed later by pressure and temperature measurement technologies. Klaus Endress, the second-eldest son of the company founder, took over as the group‚Äôs CEO in 1995. By that time, Endress+Hauser had grown into a global company with 4,339 employees and net sales of 679.6 million Swiss francs. In 2005, Endress+Hauser acquired Innovative Sensor Technology IST AG, a Swiss- based provider of physical, chemical and biological sensors with operations in Ebnat-Kappel, Switzerland, and Roznov, Czech Republic. In 2008, Georg H Endress died. The shareholder family had created a family charter while the company founder was still alive. It states ‚ÄúEndress+Hauser shall remain a family company oriented toward sustainable success.‚Äù In 2013, Endress+Hauser entered the laboratory instrumentation business with the acquisition of German company Analytik Jena AG. Additional takeovers (SpectraSensors Inc., Kaiser Optical Systems Inc., SensAction AG, Blue Ocean Nova AG) strengthened the segment of process analysis and measurement of quality parameters. Besides this strategic focal point, the issue of digitalization was another major factor of influence in company development. On 1 January 2014, Matthias Altendorf took over as CEO of the Endress+Hauser Group from Klaus Endress, who became president of the Supervisory Board. At that time the company generated net sales of ‚Ç¨1.814 billion and employed 11,919 staff worldwide. Although not a member of the family, the new CEO has been with the company for more than 25 years.

The protein helps hold calcium in the cisterna of the sarcoplasmic reticulum after a muscle contraction, even though the concentration of calcium in the sarcoplasmic reticulum is much higher than in the cytosol. It also helps the sarcoplasmic reticulum store an extraordinarily high amount of calcium ions. Each molecule of calsequestrin can bind 18 to 50 Ca2+ ions. Sequence analysis has suggested that calcium is not bound in distinct pockets via EF-hand motifs, but rather via presentation of a charged protein surface. Two forms of calsequestrin have been identified. The cardiac form Calsequestrin-2 (CASQ2) is present in cardiac and slow skeletal muscle and the fast skeletal form Calsequestrin-1(CASQ1) is found in fast skeletal muscle. The release of calsequestrin-bound calcium (through a calcium release channel) triggers muscle contraction. The active protein is not highly structured, more than 50% of it adopting a random coil conformation. When calcium binds there is a structural change whereby the alpha-helical content of the protein increases from 3 to 11%. Both forms of calsequestrin are phosphorylated by casein kinase 2, but the cardiac form is phosphorylated more rapidly and to a higher degree. Calsequestrin is also secreted in the gut where it deprives bacteria of calcium ions..  Cardiac calsequestrin  Cardiac calsequestrin (CASQ2) plays an integral role in cardiac regulation. Mutations in the cardiac calsequestrin gene have been associated with cardiac arrhythmia and sudden death. CASQ2 is thought to have a role in regulating cardiac excitation-contraction coupling and calcium- induced calcium release (CICR) in the heart, as overexpression of CASQ2 has been shown to substantially raise the magnitude of cell-averaged ICA-induced calcium transients and spontaneous calcium sparks in isolated heart cells. Furthermore, CASQ2 modulates the CICR mechanism by lengthening to process to functionally recharge the sarcoplamsic reticulum's calcium ion stores. A lack of or mutation in CSQ2 has been directly associated with catecholaminergic polymorphic ventricular tachycardia (CPVT). A mutation can have a significant effect if it disrupts the linear polymerization ability of CASQ2, which directly accounts for its high-capacity to bind Ca2+. In addition, the hydrophobic core of domain II appears to be necessary for CASQ2's function, because a single amino acid mutation that disrupts this hydrophobic core directly leads to molecular aggregates, which are unable to respond to calcium ions.

Mr. Meaty Staff *Josh Redgrove A 16-year-old cashier and employee at Mr. Meaty. (voice by Jamie Shannon) *Parker Dinkleman Josh Redgrove's best friend who works as a fry cook. (voiced by Jason Hopley) *Edward R. Carney (Mr. Meaty is named after him) (voice by Marty Stelnick) He is the original founder and current owner of the Mr. Meaty chain. His body was cryogenically frozen in the freezer of Scaunchboro's Mr. Meaty until Parker and Josh found him and thawed him out. Now, he‚Äôs back to founding and owning the Mr. Meaty empire and bossing his employees around. He rides around a high-tech wheelchair that he uses to send an electric charge to the electric chip on Mr. Wink's head. His appearance is a parody of Colonel Sanders. *Mr. Wink (AKA Winklemeyer VI) The manager with an electric chip on the back of his head, he was once a kind and friendly individual, but Carney used an electric chip to turn him cold, bitter and robotic. His great-great-great-grandfather from many generations ago signed a contract that forces him to work at Carney's side. He seems to have issues, hinted by dressing as a female customer in Noseferateens. Apparently, his opinion on being shocked is not as bad as it used to; in the first few times, he would respond with terror, but later, he seems to see it coming, as he responds with a sarcastic \\"Oh, here it comes.\\" before being electrocuted. In the episode \\"Buffalo Burrito\\", it's hinted that his mother is deceased. He is voiced by Troy Baker. *Lizzy (Alien who only worked there for a short time) She was cleverly disguised as an attractive young woman, being crushed on by both Josh and Parker for a short time. She only came out in \\"I Love Lizzy.\\" *Chip 2.6 First seen in Model Employee. He‚Äôs a robot, built to be the perfect Mr. Meaty employee. He was befriended by Josh, who thought he was cool, but Parker despised him when he saw the robot's taking their job coming. He was capable of taking any order, including one to take himself apart (given by Parker, naturally). He put himself back together, turned inexplicably evil, and formed the \\"Model Employee Circuit\\" by taking over Parker's brain. He eventually was thrown into the fryer by Parker (who overrode Chip when he said \\"we never eat\\"), and melted. *Eddie Parker's pet yeti who only worked at Mr. Meaty's for a little bit, but was shipped back to the Himalayas. He only came out in \\"My Eddie.\\" Pantosphere Staff *Ashley Steinberg Her best friends are Brittney and Ashley 2. She seems to be the leader of the trio. Though she hates Josh, she agrees to go out with him at times. In the episode \\"Schnozzola\\" it's revealed that her last name is Steinberg. *Brittney Of the three, she seems to have the most common sense and is almost always there to offer advice to Josh and Parker. She often goes out on dates with Josh. *Art\\"ee\\"st Woman The owner of Pantosphere. Sparkle City Movie Theater Staff *Ashley 2 She and Brittney are followers of Ashley. *Goth Girl She is a goth who went on a date with Josh to see the premiere of Star Raiders IV. She always wears black and still shows some interest in Josh. She can't stand violence. According to a Nick Extra on Nickelodeon, she longs to be bitten by a sensitive vampire. Soy What? Staff The entire Soy What? staff, as seen in \\"The Fries that Bind\\", consisted of a cult of cannibals. Gord was their leader, but after his not helping them fight off Josh and Parker, they left to work at Mr. Meaty. It is unknown if this applies after the end of the episode, so it is up to speculation if this episode is truly cannon. *Gord He wears his blonde hair in beaded dreadlocks. *Peace Woman *Peace Man *Ceremonial Singers ChopShtick Staff Ping: An employee who teaches Josh and Parker to be ninjas. Unfortunately, they use their ninja abilities for revenge. At this time, it is discovered that he has taught much of the mall ninjutsu (They were taught for ordering his food). So after stopping them, he makes them eat a \\"Chicken Ball of Dishonor\\" that makes them forget everything that happened to them since they learned ninjutsu from him. Security *Doug: a beefy security guard with a buzz haircut, black shades, and a prominent bottom lip. He speaks with a macho attitude and is very dedicated to his job. He can be friendly to the kids of the mall or pretty aggressive to trouble makers. He thwarts the Wegelor by going \\"commando\\" that day to work. He is terrified of zombies, and was trained in the martial arts (presumably by the ninja that works at Chop Shtick). He seems to have a liking towards Josh and Parker, and wanted to be a hero to them (to the point of lying by pretend that he fought an army of zombies and even helped them with their movie). In the far future, Doug will become the president. *R.O.B.: R.O.B. is the Mr. Meaty security bot who only appeared in \\"Buffalo Burrito,\\" in which he was lurking around the mall zapping people and repeating, \\"Please clear the area.\\" Against Josh Group *Ashley Steinberg: the long haired brunette with the pink hair clip, light purple long sleeve shirt, braces, and pink eye shadow. Ashley is very concerned with her looks and can go to extreme lengths to preserve them. Once, when so worried about a large pimple, she asked Josh and Parker for help removing it, only for them to remove her nose and then fry it and lose it to a huge hungry rat. Still we know that she dislikes Josh, right? Yet she still agrees to go on dates with him. *Ashley 2: a member of the girl group of Scaunchburo Mall. She has long curly blond hair clipped back, pink clothing, and pink makeup. She speaks with a nasally voice and chews on her hair when nervous. Ashley 2 is also not very bright (she thought Parker was a magic genie when all the food he attempted to eat vanished when it was in fact a super fast tapeworm emerging from his mouth to eat the food before he could). Ashley 2 loves frogs and toads. *Brittany: the most reasonable and apparently liked girl of Scaunchburo Mall. She has curly brown hair with gold tints, a pink tank top, and blue skirt. Britney lends advice to others and is always calm and soft-spoken. When Ashley Steinberg got a big zit, she tried to comfort her friend by telling her that everyone gets zits and that she should just leave it alone. One time, when Brittany emerged from a crowd of spectators during a fight between Josh and Parker, a heavenly light shone on her as she lent advice. *Tanya: a thick lipped girl with black shades and long dirty blonde hair. She wears a red vest and carries a purse. She once dated Josh who asked to borrow her hair crimper but didn't give it back and after they broke up. *Parkerina: (female version of Parker), Parkerina. Parker dressed in a pink cowgirl outfit, two red braids over his shoulders, and with notable eyelashes. After consuming a dozen Ms. Meaty burgers, he turned into a female version of himself. Josh used this to try to learn why the girls in the mall were ignoring him. This plan backfired when an increasingly feminine Parker rallied the girls of the mall to confront Josh who were mooched by him. *Natasha: A European (probably Russian, due to her accent) member of the Against Josh Group who appears on the screen during the Against Josh Group meeting in \\"Parkerina\\". During her time on the screen she is constantly crossing and recrossing her legs. *Sky: a member of the girl's group. She has short red hair, red lipstick, and wears a black long sleeve shirt with a red vest. The other girls, mostly Ashley Steinberg, blame her for their misfortunes to which she automatically agrees to. Bullies *Ken: Josh's older brother who is extremely annoying. He has long blonde hair and moustache. Despite the constant bullying of his brother, he and Josh are very similar in their characteristics. *Darryl: Ken's best friend and his bodyguard. Darryl enjoys hockey and is sometimes insecure about his looks. Ken also calls him \\"Darry\\" sometimes. Other Characters *Tyrone Provides the music for The Tater Tots so they can break dance. *Tater Tots Three 8-year-old Hip-Hop gangster brats. They tried to win Scaunchboro Mall as \\"Tater Turf\\" by break-dancing. They lost to Parker. Their nickname for Josh is \\"Skinny Butt\\". At one point The Tater Tots called Josh \\"Noodle Man\\" and \\"Mr. Skinny Butt\\" and in \\"Tater Turf\\" they called Parker \\"Kid\\" after they lost the re-match for the Break Dancing contest they challenged Josh to. They enjoy picking on Josh and giving him a Wedgie. At one point The Tater Tots called Parker \\"Parker Stinkleman\\". Their catch phrase is, \\"Oh no!\\". *Hamish Parker's other best friend. Technically, he didn't work at Mr. Meaty, but he was in the episode of the same name. Hamish was actually a piece of ham made with other foods as well, and Parker befriended him because Josh neglected him. *Natalie, \\"Noseferateens\\" A little vampire girl discovered in the freezer. She turned Parker and Josh into vampires. *Barb Josh's girlfriend made of meat. Josh used DNA from Ashley, Brittney, Ashley 2, and himself to make her. At first, Josh didn't want to be seen with her, but he soon accepted her as his girlfriend. They were both happy together until she dumped him for a side of beef, saying \\"he\\" was so much hotter than Josh.

He served as a postdoctoral fellow from 1980 through 1981 on a joint project between Washington University, Stanford University and the University of California, Berkeley. From 1981 to 1983 he was a research scientist at the International Plant Research Institute.  Career  In 1983, Bennetzen became an Assistant Professor at Purdue University, becoming a full Professor in 1991 and H. Edwin Umbarger Distinguished Professor of Genetics in 1999. After two decades at Purdue, he joined the faculty at UGA in 2003 as a Professor of Genetics, Georgia Research Alliance Eminent Scholar, and Giles Chair in Molecular Biology and Functional Genomics. He was interim Head of the Department of Genetics at UGA from 2009‚Äì2011. He is also an adjunct member of UGA's interdisciplinary Institute of Bioinformatics and Department of Plant Biology. He founded the Maize Genetics Executive Committee (2000) and the McClintock Prize (2014). From 2012‚Äì2016, he was a 1000 Talents Professor in the Chinese Academy of Sciences at the Kunming Institute of Botany. In 2016, he established labs at Anhui Agricultural University and the Yunnan Academy of Forestry to study the molecular genetics of tea (Camellia sinensis) and two Chinese native oil trees, Camellia oleifera and Malania oleifera.  Research Focuses  Bennetzen's research interests include plant genome structure/evolution and gene function relationships, transposable element (TE) biology, genetic diversity in under-utilized crops of the developing world, rapid evolution of complex disease resistance loci in plants, fine structure recombinational analysis, the coevolution of plant/microbe and plant/parasite interactions, and the genetic basis of quality traits in tea and other important crops. His lab was the first to clone an active TE from plants (1982); to show that classic disease resistance genes in plants are both recombinationally unstable and cell autonomous (1988); to use DNA probes from one grass genome to map another (maize, sorghum), demonstrating genetic collinearity (1990); to show that DNA TEs preferentially insert into hypomethylated DNAs in or near genes (1995); to demonstrate that the majority of plant genomes is composed of LTR retrotransposons (1996); to show the microcolinearity of plant genomes (1997), and the nature/rate/origin of exceptions to microcolinearity (1999); to explain the timing and mode of both plant genome expansion (1998) and contraction (2002); to show that plant centromeres are hot spots for recombination but not crossing over (2006); to show apparent site-directed recombination in plants (at a disease resistance gene) (2008); to use centromere gain/loss to determine the origin of plant chromosomes (in maize) (2012); to demonstrate that errors in mismatch base repair may be the most common origin of DNA double strand breaks in plants (2014); and to demonstrate domestication-associated changes in root and rhizosphere microbiomes (2018).

The company has subsidiaries in Finland, Germany, Norway, Sweden, Switzerland, Spain, Australia, the United Kingdom, the Republic of Ireland the United States, and Canada. The company is owned 50/50 by the Norwegian Government (represented by the Norwegian Ministry of Trade, Industry and Fisheries) and the Finnish defence company Patria. The company has its headquarters in Raufoss, Norway. The company has five business units: Small Caliber Division, Medium & Large Caliber Division, Missile Products Division, Demil Division and Nammo Talley. History Nammo was founded in 1998 by Raufoss (Norway), Patria (Finland), and Celsius (Sweden). The Lapua cartridge factory in Finland is also part of the Nammo group as Nammo Lapua Oy. In 2005, the present joint ownership between Patria and the Norwegian Government was established. In 2007, Nammo acquired the US munitions company Talley, Inc. after purchasing 100% of its shares. In 2009, it was revealed the Israeli Defense Forces purchased 28,000 M72 LAWs from Nammo Talley, along with weapons parts and training missiles valued at NOK 600 million. These munitions would later be used in Operation Cast Lead. According Nammo Raufoss Administrative Director Lars Harald Lied, the company also produces 12.7mm \\"multi-purpose\\" ammunition that is used by both American and Norwegian soldiers in the War in Afghanistan, often in contravention of international law. In addition to alleged international law violations, the company has also caused controversy in Norway, whose laws prohibit Norwegian companies from selling munitions for conflict purposes. Nammo Information Director Sissel Solum alleges that Nammo bears no responsibility for the use of their munitions after purchase, although some claim (including the Norwegian Church Aid and PRIO) that this is a breach of the intended spirit of national export regulations. The company has also been able to circumvent Norwegian laws and avoid prosecution by outsourcing manufacturing to plants in the US, Finland, and Sweden.

Despite a successful stage career in comedies in London, on tour and abroad, Thornton is probably best remembered as the understudy to George Grossmith in a series of Gilbert and Sullivan operas from 1877 to 1884. Thornton began his stage career giving drawing-room entertainments while simultaneously working in a commercial office in London, keeping his theatrical activities secret from his office employers for four years. He was engaged by Richard D'Oyly Carte as understudy to George Grossmith in the Gilbert and Sullivan operas, also playing roles in some of the curtain raisers played with the operas. In 1881, he created a small principal role in Patience and resigned from his office post. In 1883, he played the Lord Chancellor in a tour of Iolanthe. Thornton left the D'Oyly Carte Opera Company in 1884 and began a long series of tours of Australia in stage comedies, notably The Private Secretary, interspersed with appearances in burlesques, farces and other plays on the London stage and on tour. He rejoined D'Oyly Carte in the 1890s in London and on tour, and later returned to touring Australia in comedies including Charley's Aunt. Life and career Thornton started his career giving drawing-room entertainments in the London area, while working during the day at a merchant's office. Originally unpaid, as his entertainments gained popularity he was able to earn \\"a modest but useful guinea\\" and, as a manager, to recruit other entertainers, including George Grossmith and Richard Temple.\\"A Chat with Mr. Frank Thornton\\", The Era, 16 March 1895, p. 11 Thornton first appeared on stage as the Foreman in a production of Trial by Jury in 1877.\\"Trial By Jury and the Aquarium\\", The Era, 14 October 1877, p. 5 In the same year, he was invited to audition for Richard D'Oyly Carte's forthcoming production of The Sorcerer at the Opera Comique and was considered for the leading role of John Wellington Wells, but Grossmith was preferred, and Thornton was offered the position of understudy. D'Oyly Carte years In the production of The Sorcerer he appeared as \\"the oldest inhabitant\\" of the village of Ploverleigh.Rollins and Witts, p. 5 For the first run of H.M.S. Pinafore (1878), he understudied both Grossmith (as Sir Joseph Porter) and Temple (as Dick Deadeye).

He at last felt able to resign his office job, where he felt his prospects were limited. He also occasionally deputised for Grossmith as BunthorneRollins and Witts, p. 8 and took a role for a time in the curtain raiser Uncle Samuel. In 1882, he realised an ambition to act in a strong serious dramatic role. For Florence Terry's farewell performance, a revival of W. S. Gilbert's play Broken Hearts was billed. A strong cast was chosen, including Terry's sister Marion Terry, May Fortescue and Julia Gwynne,The Era, 24 June 1882 p. 7 but the two actors who had previously played the role of the misanthropic dwarf Mousta were unavailable. Thornton asked to play the part. \\"What, Major Murgatroyd?\\" said Gilbert, thinking the idea preposterous, but he gave Thornton a chance and was impressed. Thornton again appeared in Broken Hearts at his own benefit performance at the Savoy Theatre in February 1883. The theatrical newspaper The Era wrote, \\"Mr Frank Thornton's usual line of characters could hardly have prepared the audience for the strength and passion he infused into the part of Mousta.\\"The Era, 17 February 1883, p. 6 At the benefit, among other items, Grossmith premiered his musical sketch, The Drama on Crutches.The Pall Mall Gazette, 13 February 1883, p. 13. Thornton continued as Grossmith's understudy as the Lord Chancellor in the next Savoy opera, Iolanthe, but when the production went on tour in 1883, Thornton was given the role, also serving as stage manager for the touring company.Rollins and Witts, p. 47 In 1884 Carte sent him to New York to supervise the first American production of Princess Ida. The theatrical newspaper, The Era, reported, \\"The complete and effective manner in which Princess Ida has been put on the stage at the Fifth-avenue Theatre, New York, is due to the taste, experience and indefatigable labours of Mr Frank Thornton of the Savoy, who was sent out by Mr Carte especially to superintend the production.\\"The Era, 8 March 1884, p. 10 Overseas tours and West End shows In 1884 Thornton was engaged by the holder of the American production rights to the farce The Private Secretary to produce the piece and play the part of the Rev Robert Spalding in New York.The Era, 13 September 1884, p. 8 The production ran until April 1885,The Era, 28 March 1885, p. 15 after which Thornton briefly returned to London. He played Spalding in the London production for a week, to give the regular performer, W. S. Penley, a brief holiday during its long West End run,The Era, 9 May 1885, p. 8 and then sailed for Sydney, having secured the Australasian production rights to The Private Secretary. His tour of over 16,000 miles through Australia and New Zealand with the play \\"proved the greatest success ever scored in the Antipodes\\".The Era, 11 December 1886, p. 8 During his first visit to Australia, he also appeared as the Lord Chancellor in Iolanthe and as John Wellington Wells in the first Australian production of The Sorcerer in 1886 and as the Learned Judge in Trial. Thornton played Lurcher in Alfred Cellier's Dorothy on tour both in Britain and Australia. His performance was described by the critic of The Western Mail as \\"quaint and excruciatingly funny; a thing to be seen and remembered.\\"The Western Mail, 8 March 1887, p. 3 He then returned to the London stage, playing Quasimodo in a \\"melodramatic burlesque\\" of Victor Hugo, Miss Esmeralda, with fellow Savoyard Marion Hood at the Gaiety Theatre.The Era 15 October 1887, p. 8; and 31 December 1887, p. 11 He received good notices for this production, but was less well reviewed in his next role, as an amateur detective in the farce A Mare's Nest, of which The Era wrote, \\"he made it rather grim and repulsive than humorous.\\"The Era, 19 November 1887, p. 10 He was judged back on form in a double bill of farce, Lot 49, and the burlesque Frankenstein, or The Vampire's Victim, at the Gaiety in January 1888, with Nellie Farren and Sybil Grey.The Era, 21 January 1888, p. 14Gaiety Theatre programme, 17 January 1888 In September 1888 he assembled a company and sailed once again to Australia, with a repertory of four comedies, Mamma by Sydney Grundy, Bonny Boy, Sweet Lavender by Arthur Wing Pinero, and The Private Secretary.The Era, 29 September 1888 p. 9 Mamma provoked protest in the pages of The Sydney Morning Herald, which \\"considered the play too naughty for Antipodean audiences, and said so very plainly.\\" Thornton invited a Supreme Court judge to attend and say if the criticism was fair, and the judge pronounced in his favour.The Pall Mall Gazette, 8 August 1889, p. 1 Return to D'Oyly Carte and later years Thornton returned to England in September 1890,The Era, 6 September 1890, p. 8 and in June 1891 he created the role of Pyjama, the Grand Vizier, in The Nautch Girl for D'Oyly Carte.The Era, 4 July 1891, p. 9 After this closed, he toured with the company in The Vicar of Bray,Birmingham Daily Post, 22 March 1892, p. 7 leaving the company again in 1892.

The figs = the thistle's flower heads. A Drunk Man Looks at the Thistle is a long poem by Hugh MacDiarmid written in Scots and published in 1926. It is composed as a form of monologue with influences from stream of consciousness genres of writing. A poem of extremes, it ranges between comic and serious modes and examines a wide range of cultural, sexual, political, scientific, existential, metaphysical and cosmic themes, ultimately unified through one consistent central thread, the poet's affectively charged contemplation, looking askance at the condition of Scotland. It also includes extended and complex responses to figures from European and Russian literature, in particular Dostoevsky and Nietzsche, as well as referencing topical events and personalities of the mid-1920s such as Isadora Duncan or the UK General Strike of 1926. It is one of the major modernist literary works of the 20th century. Description The Scots poem A Drunk Man Looks at the Thistle is an extended montage of distinct poems, or sections in various poetic forms, that are connected or juxtaposed to create one emotionally continuous whole in a way which both develops and consciously parodies compositional techniques used by poets such as Pound and Eliot. Much of the poem is comic, especially in its earlier sections, but the rhapsodic structure, 2685 lines long, is able to accommodate broad swings in tone from remarkable lyric passages at one extreme to colourful invective, diatribe and flyting at the other. It ultimately builds to produce deeply serious and even transcendent effects, particularly in the climactic final sections. One of the most distinctive features of the poem is its language. MacDiarmid's literary Scots is principally rooted in his own Borders dialect, but freely draws on a wide range of idiom and vocabulary, both current and historic, from different regions of Scotland. The work, though sometimes loose and idiosyncratic, did much to increase awareness of the potential for Scots as a medium of universal literary expression at a time when this was not well appreciated. Its expressive drive is integral to the entire effect of the poem. Some of the poem's initial sections include interpolated Scots translations of other European poets, including Blok and Lasker-Sch√ºler. These introduce the mysterious and lyrical tone that begins to offset the comic persona of the poem's thrawn narrator. MacDiarmid claimed for his poem national literary ambitions similar to those Joyce did for Ulysses in Ireland.

It is notable as the progenitor of supernova 1987A. The star was originally charted by the Romanian-American astronomer Nicholas Sanduleak in 1970, but remained just a number in a catalogue until identified as the star that exploded in the first naked eye supernova since the invention of the telescope, when it in maximum reached visual magnitude +2,8. The discovery that a blue supergiant was a supernova progenitor contradicted all known theories at the time and produced a flurry of new ideas about how such a thing might happen, but it is now accepted that blue supergiants are a normal progenitor for some supernovae. The candidate luminous blue variable HD 168625 possesses a bipolar nebula that is a close twin of that around Sk -69 202. It is speculated that Sk -69 202 may have been a luminous blue variable in the recent past, although it was apparently a normal luminous supergiant at the time it exploded.

The GameCube, PlayStation 2, and Xbox versions were developed by Heavy Iron Studios, while Beenox handled the Windows and Mac OS X versions. Samuel L. Jackson (Frozone/Lucius Best), Spencer Fox (Dash), Sarah Vowell (Violet), and Jason Lee (Buddy Pine/Incrediboy; Syndrome is absent from the game on the console and PC versions aside from scenes directly taken from the film) are the only actors to reprise their roles from the film, with the rest of the cast, including Craig T. Nelson and Holly Hunter, being replaced with other voice actors - the original movie dialogue and can be heard in cutscenes taken directly from the film. The game's music was composed by Michael Giacchino, who also scored the film. Plot The mime-styled, French supervillain Bomb Voyage attempts a bank heist in the fictional American city of Metroville, but Bob Parr, alias Mr. Incredible, guided by his friend, the ice-powered superhero Frozone (secretly Lucius Best), works to stop his plans. Meanwhile, the metamorphic heroine Elastigirl battles against Voyage's mime minions across the Metroville skyline stretch. Mr. Incredible captures Bomb Voyage in the bank when his fanboy, Buddy Pine, shows up. Mr. Incredible is dismissive of Buddy Pine, and Bomb Voyage sneakily plants a bomb on Buddy's cape, who flies away with his rocket boots to notify the police. Mr. Incredible fortunately notices the bomb on Buddy's cape, and grabs hold of Buddy to embark on a wild ride above the city. Mr. Incredible and the bomb both fall onto a rooftop, where the bomb detonates harmlessly as Bomb Voyage appears in a helicopter. Voyage attempts to kill Mr. Incredible with bombs, rockets and laser beams, but Mr. Incredible throws the bombs back at the helicopter, causing it to spin wildly out of control, heavily damaged. Bomb Voyage flees the scene, Mr. Incredible having defeated his madcap foe. Fifteen years later, superheroes across America have been long-since sued and outlawed for causing too much public destruction and are forced by the US government (chiefly the CIA) to disguise themselves as civilians and live normal lives in hiding. Mr. Incredible has married Elastigirl, who has become Helen Parr, and they have three children together: Violet (who possesses force-field and invisibility powers), Dash (a 190+ mph speedster), and Jack-Jack (who does not appear to have obtained any superhuman abilities). After narrowly escaping an apartment inferno on an illegal heroic excursion with Frozone, Mr. Incredible is approached by a mysterious woman named Mirage, who tells him about a secret organization based on a remote South Pacific island called Nomanisan. Meanwhile, Dash is late for school and has to race through the Metroville traffic to reach his school on time. The organization's latest invention, the Omnidroid Mark 08, is endangering the island and its personnel. After a rough beach landing on Nomanisan Island, Mr. Incredible encounters numerous hostile robots before he finds and destroys the Omnidroid during a volcanic eruption. The entire battle is witnessed by Mirage and her anonymous employer through the eyes a robotic bird. The shadowy employer remarks that Mr. Incredible's victory is surprising, and asks Mirage to issue him new assignments. After weeks of rigorous training and having received an improved suit from superhero tailor Edna Mode, Mr. Incredible returns to Nomanisan well-prepared for another mission. When he reaches the conference room, he fights through numerous armed security guards, deadly robots and laser systems in the robot arena, but once he reaches the empty meeting room, an improved Omnidroid (the Mark 09), appears suddenly from behind a huge sliding wall and grabs Mr. Incredible, quickly overpowering and trapping him. The Omnidroid's creator, Syndrome, appears, who is Mirage's secret employer and reveals himself to be an adult (and very hostile) Buddy Pine. He reveals that he wants revenge on Mr. Incredible by killing off him and the world's other superheroes. Mr. Incredible is remorseful for his treatment of Syndrome, and escapes his clutches by jumping off the great falls. He evades Syndrome's life-sign scanner by hiding behind the skeletal remains of his superhero friend Gazer Beam (whom Syndrome had previously dispatched in an undersea cave). Unfortunately, he is later captured and imprisoned in Syndrome's base when he breaks into the villain's secret computer room, learning of Syndrome's plans to unleash his perfected Omnidroid (the Mark 10) on Metroville. Syndrome then intends to take credit for stopping the robot and saving the city, tarnishing the reputations of Mr. Incredible and his allies in the process, before he becomes the world's only super using his weaponized inventions. Elastigirl (now Mrs. Incredible), flies to Nomanisan island to rescue her husband and safely stores a stowed-away Violet and Dash in a cave, sneaking into Syndrome's complex with the goal of finding Mr. Incredible. She works her way through the hidden base and into Syndrome's volcanic lair. The next morning, Violet and Dash accidentally activate a robotic cockatoo's alarm system and are forced to use their powers to escape from Syndrome's guards. After a 100-mile dash through the jungle and across the beaches and lakes of the island, and Violet's crossing of Syndrome's henchmen (thanks to the use of her invisibility), the two learn not to be ashamed of their powers and work together, combining their abilities to form the Incredi-ball. They battle henchmen and robots, eventually finding their parents, with Mirage having had a change of heart and freeing Mr. Incredible. As the Incredible family finally meets up outside the secret lava labs, Mirage helps them activate and launch one of Syndrome's rockets from the rocket silo, which they use to reach Metroville, where the Omnidroid is wreaking havoc on the populace. The Incredibles and Frozone work together to destroy the robot, stop Syndrome and save the world. Syndrome escapes from the battle in the city, but is later killed offscreen when he attempts to kidnap Jack-Jack Parr as revenge. The Incredibles meet with their family friend and CIA agent Rick Dicker, who acquits and relieves them of their lives as superheroes in hiding, and they are loved by the public again for their efforts. Sequel Continuing after the events of the game, a sequel titled The Incredibles: Rise of the Underminer was released in 2005. Rise of the Underminer serves as an alternative sequel to the first game, featuring Mr. Incredible and Frozone as playable characters, with the option of two-player cooperative play as a new addition. The game revolves around Mr. Incredible and Frozone as they team up together to defeat the Underminer and his robot army. Following the release of Incredibles 2 (2018), it is now non-canon. Reception The Incredibles received \\"mixed\\" reviews on all platforms according to the review aggregation website Metacritic. In Japan, where it was ported on December 2, 2004, Famitsu gave it a score of 29 out of 40 for the PlayStation 2 version, and 23 out of 40 for the Game Boy Advance version.

NeoEdge powered advertising for a variety of game publishers including Yahoo. NeoEdge provided both peer-to-peer game distribution (to reduce costs of distributing games) and in-game advertising (to help increase consumer game play and monetization). It was renamed Blue Noodle in early 2011 and shut down later that year. Introduction NeoEdge provided advertising inside online casual games. The online video advertising platform provides advertisers a medium that reaches a key demographic (adults over 18 years of age) with television-like commercials in an engaged environment that casual gamers have accepted in exchange for free game play. History NeoEdge was founded in 2002 by Steven Woods, Jeromy Carriere, Kelly Slough, Dave Simons, and Michael Babiak, former Netscape and America Online employees, under the name \\"Kinitos\\". While at Quack.com the founders created the first consumer-based Voice Portal, acquired by America Online in 2000. In 2007, Atari co-founder Nolan Bushnell joined the NeoEdge board as Chairman. Under the Kinitos brand, the company was a Microsoft partner in its Smart Client efforts. Smart Clients were a Microsoft initiative to help companies deliver Web 2.0 Internet services. These services were intended to help companies deliver consumer services that transcended traditional browsers - helping to provide downloadable application-style capabilities to consumer and enterprise companies without the past problems associated with installed applications. Downloadable games with embedded web services are one class of such solutions, the MostFun.com Game Player, owned by NeoEdge, is one example of such an application - others include all manner of browser extensions and plugins, or downloadable web services applications like instant messaging, Google Earth, Bittorrent, iTunes, and many others. In 2005, Kinitos reorganized to support game developers and distributors to deliver ad-enabled game play to consumers as an alternative to traditional \\"try and buy\\" models. NeoEdge became a leader in changing the current business model of the casual game industry. According to the Casual Game Association, 200 Million people worldwide play casual games every month. The industry struggled as a ‚Äúhits‚Äù based business with a ‚ÄúTry and Buy‚Äù business model made long-term revenue generation difficult. In 2010, the company was merged with Offspring Games and started a game studio in San Francisco, California. Titles released include Prize-O-Rama and Happy Thoughts. The game studio was unable to produce a profitable title and the company fell on hard financial times during the Great Recession. Its lender MMV Financial shut down its offices by July 2011. By August the company failed to pay its employees.

Shotts was then a dreary moorland place on the Great Road of the Shire. The road was an important route for tradesman carrying their wares around Scotland. Bertram de Shotts habitually savaged packmen and peddlers for treasure carried along the Great Road. Such was the menace of Bertram de Shotts, King James IV of Scotland ordered his death. Bertram de Shotts was probably in fact seven or eight feet high, yet nonetheless, his presence merited Giant status. A gripping tale is told how a young man, namely Willielmo De Muirhead, 1st Laird of Muirhead, killed the Giant. With cunning patience he ambushed Bertram de Shotts, immobilising him by slicing both his hamstrings as he lay down to drink at St. Catherine's Well / Kate's Well in the then known Sallysburgh now Salsburgh. Disorientated, Bertram de Shotts was then decapitated in an unpleasant death. A proud, and now wealthy, De Muirhead then carried the blooded head to the King and was rewarded with a 'Hawk's Flight' of land. This land subsequently became Muirhead's Lauchope estate. A relic of Bertram‚Äôs exploits is still to be seen in one of his hide-outs, Law‚Äôs Castle, known to old residents as the Giant‚Äôs Cup and Saucer. Huge stones they are, standing sentinel in a desolate moorland bowl, in an unutterable silence, brooding and age old. Despite Bertram de Shotts being a savage thief, the village Shotts is said, with much probability, to have derived its name from the legendary Giant. Bertram is believed to have lived from around 1467 to 1505.

Written by American composer Stephen Sondheim and produced by Madonna and Bill Bottrell, the song was used in the parent film, Dick Tracy. \\"Sooner or Later\\" was composed to evoke the theatrical nature and style of the film. A 1930s-style jazz ballad with piano, drum, double bass, and horns, the track conjures up the atmosphere of a smoky nightclub. Madonna sings in her lowest register accompanied by a variable pitch. Critical response to the track was positive, with reviewers deeming it as an important addition to Madonna's music catalog. At the 63rd Academy Awards held on March 25, 1991, the song won an Oscar for Best Original Song, awarded to Sondheim. Madonna attended the ceremony along with singer Michael Jackson as her date, and performed \\"Sooner or Later\\" onstage, being inspired by the look of actress Marilyn Monroe. Madonna also performed the song at her 1990 Blond Ambition World Tour. Background In 1990, Madonna was part of the film Dick Tracy starring as Breathless Mahoney‚Äîa new role introduced for her‚Äî with Warren Beatty playing the title character. Madonna told Premiere magazine that initially she had waited for Beatty to call her for the film. When Beatty did not reciprocate, the singer decided to involve herself voluntarily. She pursued the part of Mahoney, but offered to work for minimum wages to avoid favoritism. Dick Tracy was the ninth-highest-grossing film in the US in 1990, and number twelve globally. The film also received positive reviews from critics. Roger Ebert from the Chicago Sun-Times praised the matte paintings, art direction and prosthetic makeup design, stating: \\"Dick Tracy is one of the most original and visionary fantasies I've seen on a screen\\". By the 1980s, record labels started to release albums that were closely associated with a film, thereby gaining double promotion. These were mostly termed as soundtracks although many of them were not related to the film. After the filming for Dick Tracy was over by May 1989, Madonna started working on the soundtrack. She had begun recording three songs by Stephen Sondheim for the film‚Äî\\"Sooner or Later\\", \\"More\\" and \\"What Can You Lose\\"‚Äîwhich would be part of the album, but also had to write and develop new songs comparable in style to the previous. She produced the entire album, including the Sondheim songs. \\"I want people to think of me as a musical comedy actress. That's what this album is about for me. It's a stretch. Not just pop music, but songs that have a different feel to them, a theatrical feel\\", she said at the time. Composition According to Rikky Rooksby, author of The Complete Guide to the Music of Madonna, the harmonic and melodic styles of the songs she developed with Sondheim were more \\"complex\\" than her usual recordings, hence Madonna found it difficult and demanding. She spoke about the \\"wilderness\\" of the tunes, saying that she was not confident of doing justice to the songs, and neither was Sondheim. But he kept on encouraging the singer so that the recording sessions would not be affected. Madonna also recruited producer Patrick Leonard and engineer Bill Bottrell to help her with the project. She and Leonard toiled to create music that would fit the style and production of the film, set in the era of the Untouchables. \\"Sooner or Later\\" was composed as a 1930s-style jazz ballad with comping piano, brushed drum sounds, double bass and horns. Rooksby described the track as \\"conjuring the atmosphere of a smoky nightclub\\". Madonna sings in her lowest range as the melody shifts continuously. It opens with a \\"lazy\\" clarinet solo and portrays the singer as a kind of sexual magnate. \\"I always get my man\\", she sings \\"If you're on my list it's just a question of when\\". The song is set in the time signature of common time with a moderate tempo of 75 beats per minute. It is composed in the key of B major with Madonna's voice spanning from F3 to B4. The song follows a basic sequence of B9‚ÄìB6/F‚ÄìB9‚ÄìB6/F as its chord progression. In the film, \\"Sooner or Later\\" is the signature song of Breathless and was primarily performed during a montage just after Dick Tracy has placed a microphone in Alphonse \\"Big Boy\\" Caprice's boardroom and operator. Critical reception Lucky Lara from Manila Standard Today listed the Sondheim songs as highlights from the album, commenting how they fit Madonna's \\"nasal voice as a glove\\", and their addition to Madonna's catalogue of songs would give her \\"the edge in future career moves\\". According to Lara, with \\"Sooner or Later\\", Madonna \\"shows off a side to her singing that audiences haven't heard yet, and what a side it is. She proves to her critics that she isn't just the glitter and trash of the dance club scene, and that she can belt it out nearly as well as the best of them\\". According to Ray Boren from Deseret News \\"is very much a period piece, with an intimate club feel\\". Another positive review came from Mark Coleman from Rolling Stone, who described the song as Madonna's \\"breathy emotionality\\", observing that Madonna did not whisper the line \\"I always get my man\\", rather sang it aloud, bringing \\"conviction to a somewhat generic line\\". According to Jon Pareles of The New York Times, songs including \\"Sooner or Later\\" are \\"typical Sondheim, with agile wordplay and devious chromatic harmonies\\". At the 63rd Academy Awards held on March 25, 1991, the song won an Oscar for Best Original Song, awarded to Sondheim who did not attend the ceremony. In the award ceremony the song was listed as \\"Sooner or Later (I Always Get My Man)\\". Live performances On the 1990 Blond Ambition World Tour, Madonna performed \\"Sooner or Later\\" atop of a piano, as a chanteuse in a cabaret. The wardrobe for the performance consisted of a green and white couture corset, with conical bra cups, beaded fringing and striped sequined embroidery, designed by Jean Paul Gaultier, underneath a long black robe. On his review of the concert, Richard Harrington from The Washington Post, opined Madonna \\"acquitted herself quite well on 'Sooner or Later'\\". Two different performances were taped and released on video, the Blond Ambition Japan Tour 90, taped in Yokohama, Japan, on April 27, 1990, and the Blond Ambition World Tour Live, taped in Nice, France, on August 5, 1990. At the 1991 Academy Awards, Madonna appeared with singer Michael Jackson as her date and performed \\"Sooner or Later\\". According to journalist Liz Smith, Madonna had promised to perform at the award show if either \\"Sooner or Later\\" or \\"More\\" was nominated in the Best Original Song category. She wore a long, tight, white dress designed by Bob Mackie and covered in sequins and pearls. On her neck she wore $20 million worth of jewelry from Harry Winston. Taraborrelli recalled that Madonna had appropriated every move and mannerisms of Marilyn Monroe for the performance, making it a tribute to the actress. When she appeared onstage, there was technical difficulty resulting in the mike not appearing from below the ground, and a stagehand passing it to her. According to Madonna's brother Christopher Ciccone, she was quite nervous during the performance; \\"had she been singing to an audience of screaming fans, she wouldn't have been at all nervous. But this time she was performing in an auditorium full of established actors and actresses, a group of people to which she really didn't belong, who didn't respect her as an actress but whose respect she desperately wanted to win.\\" Janet Maslin from The New York Times criticized Madonna's performance, saying that the singer \\"vamped awkwardly through [the song], managing to seem even waxier in action than she did seated beside Michael Jackson in the audience.\\" In retrospective reviews, Billboard ranked it as the seventh \\"most awesome\\" Oscar performance of all time, saying that \\"Madonna gave a performance that took us back to the glamorous days of old Hollywood.\\" Gaby Wilson from MTV News dubbed it as the Oscar performance with the best style of all time.

Council of Arles in 314 The first council of Arles\\"Arles, Synod of\\" in Chambers's Encyclop√¶dia. London: George Newnes, 1961, Vol. 1, p. 597. took place a year after the Edict of Milan, in which Christianity became a legal religion. This council was the first called by Constantine and is the forerunner of the First Council of Nicaea. Augustine of Hippo called it an Ecumenical Council. It had the following outcomes: * Conscientious objectors would be excommunicated.Nonviolence: Twenty-Five Lessons from the History of a Dangerous Idea, Mark Kurlanski, 2006 * Easter should be held on the same day throughout the world, rather than being set by each local church. * Donatism was condemned as a heresy and Donatus Magnus was excommunicated. This had begun as an appeal by the Donatists to Constantine the Great against the decision of the Council of Rome in 313 at the Lateran under Pope Miltiades. The appeal had turned out unfavorably to the Donatists who afterwards became enemies of the Roman authorities. * Canon against the non-residence of clergy, * Canon against participation in races and gladiatorial fights (to be punished by excommunication), * Canon against the rebaptism of heretics, * Clergymen who could be proven to have delivered sacred books in persecution (the traditores) should be deposed, but their official acts were to be held valid. * Ordination required the assistance of at least three bishops. * Excommunication of all actors * Canons on other matters of discipline. Council of Arles in 353 Called in support of Arianism. It was attended, among others, by two papal legates, Bishop Vincentius of Capua and Bishop Marcellus of Campania. The legates were tempted into rejecting communion with Athanasius, while the synod refused to condemn Arius, despite an agreement to do so entered into before the synod began, an act which filled Pope Liberius with grief. Their consent was ultimately forced out of them by the Emperor Constantius, an Arian himself. Council of Arles in 435 A council was held on New Year's Day of 435, to settle the differences that had arisen between the Abbot of L√©rins and the Bishop of Fr√©jus. Councils of Arles in 443 and 452 In the synod of 443 (452), attended also by bishops of neighbouring provinces, fifty-six canons were formulated, mostly repetitions of earlier disciplinary decrees. Neophytes were excluded from major orders; married men aspiring to the priesthood were required to promise a life of continency, and it was forbidden to consecrate a bishop without the assistance of three other bishops and the consent of the Metropolitan. Council of 451 A council of 451 held after the close of the Council of Chalcedon in that year, sent its adhesion to the \\"Epistola dogmatica\\" of Pope Leo I, written by Flavian of Constantinople (see Eutyches) Council of 463 Apropos of the conflict between the archiepiscopal See of Vienne and Arles a council was held in the latter city in 463, which called forth a famous letter from St. Leo I.Leonis I, Opp., ed. Ballerini, I, 998; Hefele, Conciliengeschichte, II, 590. Bishop Leontius of Arles presided; twenty bishops attended. Council of 475 In 475 (though some scholars say it was 480) another council was called, attended by thirty bishops, in which the pre-destinationist teachings of the priest Lucidus were condemned. It should also be noted that post-Augustine, Augustine's doctrines that were in agreement with orthodoxy such as the inherent sinfulness of man and the necessity of prevening grace were held but Augustine's predestination was rejected as early as the Third Ecumenical Council held at Ephesus in 431 AD and then reaffirmed and expanded at the Council of Arles in 475 AD that rejected five heresies against grace. The rejections are: (1) Those opinions that serve to oversimplify and argue that the work of human obedience need not be united with divine grace; (2) that after the fall Adam the free choice of will was completely destroyed (a freed will sustained by grace is the orthodox view); (3) that Christ, Lord and Savior did not incur death for the salvation of all; (4) that the foreknowledge of man impels man to death (they rejected fatalism); (5) that those who perish, perish by the will of God. Council of Arles in 506 Exemplified the close connection between the church and the Merovingian dynasty. Council of Arles in 524 A regional council was held in 524, with 14 bishops and 4 presbyters present. This council was held under the presidency of St. Caesarius of Arles; its canons deal chiefly with the conferring of orders. A number of Caesarius of Arles' works have been published in Sources Chr√©tiennes. Councils of Arles in 554 and 682 Little is known of the councils of 554 and 682. Council of Arles in 648/60 Possibly a provincial council, at which Theudorius of Arles was to be judged. Council of 813 An important council was held in 813, at the instigation of Charlemagne, for the correction of abuses and the reestablishment of ecclesiastical discipline. Its decrees insist on a sufficient ecclesiastical education of bishops and priests, on the duty of both to preach frequently to the people and to instruct them in the Catholic Faith, on the obligation of parents to instruct their children, etc. Council of 1034 In 1034 a council was held at Arles for the re-establishment of peace, the restoration of Christian Faith, the awakening in the popular heart of a sense of divine goodness and of salutary fear by the consideration of past evils. Council of Arles in 1234/1236 The 1234 Council opposed the Albigensian heresy. In 1236 a further council was held under the presidency of Jean Baussan, Archbishop of Arles, which issued twenty-four canons, mostly against the prevalent Albigensian heresy, and for the observance of the decrees of the Lateran Council of 1215 and that of Toulouse in 1229. Close inspection of their dioceses is urged on the bishops, as a remedy against the spread of heresy; testaments are declared invalid unless made in the presence of the parish priest. This measure, met with in other councils, was meant to prevent testamentary dispositions in favour of known heretics. Council of 1251 (Avignon) In 1251, Jean, Archbishop of Arles, held a council near Avignon (Concilium Insculanum), among whose thirteen canons is one providing that the sponsor at baptism is bound to give only the white robe in which the infant is baptized. Councils of 1260, 1263, and 1275 In 1260 a council held by Florentin, Archbishop of Arles, decreed that confirmation must be received for fasting, and that on Sundays and feast days the religious should not open their churches to the faithful, nor preach at the hour of the parish Mass. The laity should be instructed by their parish priests. The religious should also frequent the parochial service, for the sake of good example. This council also condemned the doctrines spread abroad under the name of Joachim of Fiore, a 12th-century monk and mystic. He was further condemned at a Council held in 1263 In 1275, twenty-two earlier observances were promulgated anew at a Council of Arles.
