(2011). Conomurex luhuanus (Linnaeus, 1758). Accessed through: World Register of Marine Species at http://www.marinespecies.org/aphia.php?p=taxdetails&id;=565370 on 2011-03-25 C. luhuanus is found in sandy habitat among corals in the Indopacific region. They feed on algae or detritus, move with a modified foot, and have complex eyes compared to other gastropods.  Shell description  Some shells of Conomurex luhuanus. The two smaller shells to the right have been cut open to reveal the coloration of the parietal wall The shell of C. luhuanus ranges from a more common length of 5 cm, to a maximum length of 8 cm.Poutiers, J. M. (1998). Gastropods in: FAO Species Identification Guide for Fishery Purposes: The living marine resources of the Western Central Pacific Volume 1. Seaweeds, corals, bivalves and gastropods. Rome, FAO. page 475. C. luhuanus is often mistaken for a cone snail, mainly because of the conoidal outline of its shell, which is relatively unusual among the Strombidae. Its stromboid notch, though not as conspicuous as observed in many species that used to belong to Strombus (such as Lentigo lentiginosus), is deep and easily distinguished. The interior may be slightly lirate. The external color of the shell can be either white with an orange, brown/tan pattern of blotches, or completely brown/white. The interior is usually colored strong orange, red or pink, and the inner lip border is black or chocolate brown. Phylogeny The phylogenetic relationships among the Strombidae have been mainly accessed on two occasions, by Simone (2005) and Latiolais (2006), using two distinct methods. Simone proposed a cladogram (a tree of descent) based on an extensive morpho-anatomical analysis of representatives of Aporrhaidae, Strombidae, Xenophoridae and Struthiolariidae, which included C. luhuanus. With the exception of Lambis and Terebellum, the remaining taxa were previously allocated within the genus Strombus, including C. luhuanus. However, according to Simone, only Strombus gracilior, Strombus alatus and Strombus pugilis, the type species, remained within Strombus, as they constituted a distinct group based on at least five synapomorphies (traits that are shared by two or more taxa and theirmost recent common ancestor). The remaining taxa were previously considered as subgenera, and were elevated to genus level by Simone in the end of his analysis. The genus Conomurex, in this case, only included C. luhuanus. In a different approach, Latiolais et al. (2006) proposed a cladogram based on sequences of nuclear histone H3 gene and mitochondrial cytochrome-c oxidase I (COI) gene showing phylogenetic relationships of 32 species that used to belong to the genus Strombus and Lambis, including Conomurex luhuanus (= Strombus luhuanus). All species in this cladogram are still given under their original names in Strombus and Lambis.  Habitat and ecology  C. luhuanus dwells in sandy substrate in tropical habitats, such as the Great Barrier Reef and southern Papua New Guinea. They often form colonies that move together over long periods of time. Two types of colonies have been described: colonies of juveniles that are made up of conch of the same size-class, and colonies of mixed age-classes that contain individual conch of a spectrum of ages, although within the colony separation based on age still persists. C. luhuanus are herbivores or feed on detritus. They use their proboscis to pick up sand which they may then swallow or eat algae from. Strombus also have sensory tentacles at the end of their eyestalks which may play a role in chemically sensing the presence of nearby food. The sensory tentacles may also be important in detecting predators, such as carnivorous snails. Unlike many snails that move by slowly creeping along their terrain, members of the Strombus family move with an awkward leaping motion as they thrust off the sea floor with their modified foot. This leaping motion is also used to quickly escape from predators.  Reproduction  C. luhuanus form mating aggregations of copulating individuals were males and females compete for reproduction opportunities.Eyes of C. luhuanus. By Harry Rose.  Vision  The eyes of members of the Strombus family are positioned at the ends of eye stalks and typically have a diameter of about 1.5-2.5 mm, which is large compared to their body size. The eye stalks extend from two notches in the shell. The eye of Strombus contains a spherical lens, a cornea, a pupil with a pigmented iris surrounding it, a vitreous body, and a cup- shaped retina. In contrast, some other gastropods only possess small open eyes containing a gelatinous substance. The retina is made up of several layers. The first layer, located adjacent to the vitreous body, is primarily composed of the processes of photoreceptor cells. This layer is approximately 180 um thick. The next layer is characterized by an abundance of dark pigment granules. The following layer contains the cell bodies of different cell types, and the last layer consists of neuropil. It is from the neuropil layer that the optic nerve projects in several small branches that eventually merge to form a single nerve fiber. Strombus has almost 100,000 photoreceptors, whereas some nudibranchs merely have five. Three distinct cell types have been described in the retinas of C. luhuanus, one of which is a photoreceptor, another which is a glial cell, and the last which may be a second type of photoreceptor. Only one type of visual pigment has been identified in C. luhuanus, suggesting that they do not possess color vision. Electrophysiological recordings that measure electrical impulses, or action potentials, from neurons have been used to study the neural processing of visual information from the eye of C. luhuanus. When eyes adapted to the dark were shown brief flashes of light, a cornea-negative potential was evoked. This response was termed the \\"on\\" response. When light was presented to the dark-adapted eye for a longer period of time, the extracellular retinal potential (ERG) recordings showed the cornea-negative potential declined until a steady-state was reached. Then, the steady-state was maintained until the light stimulus ceased and the potential returned to baseline. Finally, a third type of response that fired at the cessation of light stimulus was observed and termed the \\"off\\" response. These different waveform responses could indicate that C. luhuanus is capable of complex neural processing involving excitation, inhibition, and synaptic inhibition. The \\"on\\" response could be due to excitation of the optic nerve in response to depolarizing photoreceptors, while the decline to steady-state potential could be a sign of synaptic inhibition, and the \\"off\\" activity could indicate release from light- promoted inhibition. The light-promoted \\"off\\" potentials were found to be sensitive to anesthesia by magnesium chloride, with repetitive \\"off\\" potentials eliminated within minutes of being introduced to the magnesium chloride solution. However, the light-promoted \\"on\\" potentials were not affected by the magnesium chloride and would continue firing over an hour after being immersed in the magnesium chloride solution. These results could indicate that nerve fibers that are responsible for \\"off\\" stimuli are regulated by chemical synapses, which can be inhibited by magnesium. It is not entirely clear why C. luhuanus evolved such well-developed eyes. Usually eyes of this complexity are found on predators that move quickly through their environment looking for prey, not in slow-moving herbivorous creatures such as C. luhuanus. One study suggests that the eyes are important for coordination in the escape response of Strombus. When conch were blinded, they showed an increased probability of leaping nearer to the predator instead of away from it. More work remains to be done on the purpose of the eyes, however.  Regeneration  Another remarkable feature of the eyes of Strombus luhuanus is that they are capable of regeneration following amputation. The first step of regeneration following severance of the optic nerve is the formation of an eye cup as the epithelium adjacent to the cut folds inward. This occurs within a day after the optic nerve is cut. The eye cup is closed by day three, and at this stage it resembles an embryonic eye. The diameter of the eye continues to increase, and meanwhile the cells of the eye differentiate to form the different layers in the retina. When the diameter of the eye reaches about 0.8 mm (after about 15 days), the retina looks like a mature adult eye. The eye will continue to grow until it becomes fully sized, with a diameter of 2 mm, which can take several months. Size, age, sex, nutritional state, or whether the left or right eye is amputated does not have a substantial influence on the regenerative prospects of the eye. Tiger conch (C. luhuanus) In gastropod eye regeneration, the degenerating nerve is important for the formation of the new eye. New axons leave the eye cup and bundle together to form the optic nerve. The new nerve fibers seem to be attracted to the previous optic nerve, and grow down it until they make contact with the cerebral ganglion. Electroretinograms (ERGs) have been used to monitor neuron activity in the developing eye of C. luhuanus over the course of the eye's development. The ERGs of the regenerating C. luhuanus eye grow increasingly complex as the eye matures. During the first week of regeneration, a simple \\"on\\" peak was recorded, and steady-state potentials were observed in response to prolonged illumination. When the eye reached about 0.4 mm in diameter, an \\"off\\" response was observed occasionally. At a diameter of 0.6 mm, rhythmic ERG \\"off\\" responses were detected. By 0.8 mm in diameter, the ERGs of the regenerated eye resembled that of a mature adult eye, with two distinct cornea-negative \\"on\\" potentials and rhythmic \\"off\\" potentials.

He attended the Lambeth Conferences of 1878, 1888, and 1897 and adopted the additional title of Archbishop of Cape Town on 28 July 1897, after the Lambeth Conference had resolved to entitle certain of the Metropolitans of the Anglican communion as Archbishops. He returned to England to attend the Pan-Anglican Congress and Lambeth Conference in 1908, and died in Housel Bay in Cornwall, on 21 May 1908. He was buried in Oxford. West Jones was married in St. Peter‚Äôs Church, Eaton Square in London, by the Bishop of Ely, on 16 January 1879, to Emily Frances Allen, the daughter of John Allen, of Oldfield Hall, Altrincham. Mrs. Jones died on 9 November 1930. West Jones ‚Äúwon a great reputation for pastoral gentleness, generosity and kindliness.

Personal life Steuer was born on September 16, 1870 (or 1871), in the town of Homonna, Austria-Hungary (now Humenne, Slovakia). In 1876 he arrived in the United States with his father and hos mother. He attended the City College of New York from 1886 to 1889. He received his law degree from Columbia University in 1893 and was admitted to the New York state bar the same year. Steuer married Bertha Popkin in 1897. The couple had three children: Aron, Ethel and Constance. Steuer was active in Tammany Hall for many years, especially during the leadership of John F. Curry in the late 1920s and the early 1930s. In 1938, he served as a delegate to the New York state constitutional convention. Steuer died in Jackson, New Hampshire, on August 21, 1940. Legal career Steuer represented some plaintiffs and in some cases was a prosecutor, but he made his name as counsel for the defense. His first trial that gave him a reputation was the defense of actor Raymond Hitchcock in 1908. Steuer is best known for his successful defense of the factory owners after the Triangle Shirtwaist Factory Fire. In March 1911 a fire broke out on the eighth floor of the factory, and quickly spread to the ninth and tenth floors. The escape routes were locked or overcome by the fire. One hundred forty-six women, adolescent girls, and men lost their lives. Steuer defended the owners, Max Blanck and Isaac Harris, against criminal charges arising from the fire and its circumstances. The two were acquitted. The acquittal is attributed to Steuer's cross-examination and impeachment of one of the surviving employees. Steuer won acquittals in numerous other cases. Defendants who were acquitted included sports promoter Tex Rickard, banker Charles E. Mitchell and former Attorney General Harry Daugherty. Steuer, though a skillful litigator, also saw clients convicted, such as Maurice E. Connolly, or saw the loss of divorce cases, as the one for W.E.D. Stokes. Working for the employers, Steuer negotiated significant collective bargaining agreements in the women's clothing industry. Working as a prosecutor, Steuer won convictions against Barnard K. Marcus and Saul Singer for their roles in the failed Bank of United States. References *\\"Steuer, Max David\\".

It controls the management of Crown owed minerals. Potential changes to Schedule 4 of the Act created controversy and opposition in 2010. The definition of minerals under the Act is very broad - it includes gravel, industrial rocks, building stone, coal and petroleum. All gold, silver, uranium and petroleum is under Crown ownership as well as any other minerals that are on Crown owned land. Schedule 4 Review In 2009 the National-led government announced that it would review Schedule 4 of the Act, a list of conservation areas for which access for mining cannot be granted by the Minister of Conservation. The proposal was condemned by critics not only because of the potential environmental impacts, but also because of the associated effects that were feared for the tourism industry. Major NGOs such as Federated Mountain Clubs and Forest and Bird came out in opposition to the plans. In March 2010 the government requested public feedback on a discussion document on the removal of 7000 ha of land from Schedule 4. There was a record 37,500 submissions on the document. A protest March Against Mining was organised by Greenpeace NZ on 1 May in Auckland and it attracted an estimated 40,000 people. On 20 July 2010 the Government announced that in response to receiving 37,552 submissions, the vast majority of which opposed mining, it will not remove any land from Schedule 4. Proposed amendments In April 2013 a group of well-known New Zealanders including actress Lucy Lawless, Geoffrey Palmer and Anne Salmond, as well as Greenpeace and Forest & Bird, said proposed amendments by the Crown Minerals (Permitting and Crown Land) Bill suggested by Energy and Resources Minister Simon Bridges were \\"a sledgehammer designed to attack peaceful protest at sea\\".

The merged paper was acquired in 1982 by Home News Enterprises, based in Columbus, Indiana, which increased its frequency to two issues per week in 1989.

Containing early versions of three poems later included in Songs of Innocence (1789) and satirising the \\"contrived and empty productions of the contemporary culture\\",Hilton (2003: 193‚Äì194) An Island demonstrates Blake's increasing dissatisfaction with convention and his developing interest in prophetic modes of expression. Referred to by William Butler Yeats and E. J. Ellis as \\"Blake's first true symbolic book,\\"Ellis and Yeats, The Works of William Blake, Poetic, Symbolic and Critical (London: Bernard Quaritch, 1893); Volume I, 194 it also includes a partial description of Blake's soon-to-be-realised method of illuminated printing. The piece was unpublished during Blake's lifetime, and survives only in a single manuscript copy, residing in the Fitzwilliam Museum, in the University of Cambridge. Background The overriding theory as to the main impetus behind An Island is that it allegorises Blake's rejection of the bluestocking society of Harriet Mathew, who, along with her husband, Reverend Anthony Stephen Mathew organised 'poetical evenings' to which came many of Blake's friends (such as John Flaxman, Thomas Stothard and Joseph Johnson) and, on at least one occasion, Blake himself.Ackroyd (1995: 82‚Äì85) The Mathews had been behind the publication in 1783 of Blake's first collection of poetry, Poetical Sketches,Ackroyd (1995: 94) but by 1784, Blake had supposedly grown weary of their company and the social circles in which they moved, and chose to distance himself from them. This theory can be traced back to an 1828 'Biographical Sketch' of Blake by his friend in later life, the painter J. T. Smith, published in the second volume of Smith's biography of Joseph Nollekens, Nollekens and his times. Smith's references to the Mathew family's association with Blake were taken up and elaborated upon by Blake's first biographer, Alexander Gilchrist, in his 1863 biography Life of William Blake, Pictor Ignotus., and from that point forth, the prevailing belief as to the primary background of An Island is that it dramatises Blake's disassociation from the social circles in which he found himself.See Erdman (1977: 93n12) Critical work in the second half of the twentieth century, however, has often challenged the assumption that An Island originated in Blake's rejection of a specific social circle. Foremost amongst such work is that of David V. Erdman, who suggests instead that the main background to the An Island is Blake's belief in his own imminent financial success. In early 1784, Blake opened a print shop at No. 27 Broad Street with James Parker, alongside whom he had served as an apprentice to the engraver James Basire during the 1770s. At the time, engraving was becoming an extremely lucrative trade, accruing both wealth and respectability for many of its practitioners, and Erdman believes that the increasing prosperity for engravers in the early 1780s represents the most important background to An Island, arguing that the confidence which Blake and Parker must have felt informs the content more so than any sense of social rejection;Erdman (1977: 90) \\"the kind of envy that breeds satire is that of the artist and artisan who is anticipating the taste of success and is especially perceptive of the element of opportunism.\\"Erdman (1977: 101) Erdman also sees as important the fact that the character based on Blake, Quid the Cynic, partially outlines a new method of printing, not unlike Blake's own, as yet unrealised, illuminated printing. Quid argues that he will use this new method of printing to outdo the best known and most successful of artists and writers, such as Joshua Reynolds, William Woollett, Homer, John Milton and William Shakespeare. Behind this claim, argues Erdman, \\"lies the vision of a man [...] who begins to see a way to replace the division of labour with the harmony of One Man, to renew and join together the arts of poetry and painting without going outside his own shop and his own head.\\"Erdman (1977: 99) As such, it is Erdman's contention that the primary background factor for An Island is the sense of anticipation and exuberance on the part of Blake, expectation for his new business venture and excitement regarding his new method of printing; An Island was thus borne from anticipation. Nevertheless, writing in 2003, Nick Rawlinson, who also disagrees with the 'rejection theory', points out that \\"the general critical consensus is that the eleven surviving chapters of this unpublished manuscript form little more than Blake's whimsical attempt to satirise his friends, neighbours and fellow attendees of 27 Rathbone Place, the intellectual salon of the Reverend and Mrs AS Mathew; a kind of pleasing cartoon wallpaper on which he couldn't resist scrawling a few grotesque caricatures of his favourite scientific and philosophic bugbears.\\"Rawlinson (2003: 98) Manuscript and date Due to the nature of the revisions in the only existing manuscript copy of An Island, it is generally agreed amongst scholars that the manuscript is not the original, but was in fact a copy made by Blake.Erdman (1982: 849) Blake seems to have worked on the eighteen-page MS over eight sittings, as there are eight different types of ink used throughout.Ackroyd (1995: 89) The manuscript also contains many handwritten corrections in Blake's handwriting. Page 18 of the only known manuscript of An Island in the Moon, containing random words and small illustrations Also of interest is that on the last page of the MS are found numerous small pencil drawings of horses, lambs, lions and two human profiles. Additionally, the word \\"Numeration\\" has been written in the centre of the page, the word \\"Lamb\\" in tiny script between the two human profiles (partly obscured by a large \\"N\\"), and two signatures of Blake himself at the top of the page. Also present are various random letters (especially the letter \\"N\\") which may be examples of Blake's attempts to master mirror writing, a skill which was necessary for his work as an engraver.Bentley (2001: 37) However, it is thought that at least some of the sketches and lettering on this page could have been by Blake's brother, Robert; \\"the awkwardness and redundancy of some of the work, the bare geometry of the head of the large lion in the lower pair of animals in the upper left quadrant of the page, and the heavy overdrawing on some of the other animals are among the features that may possibly reflect Robert's attempts to draw subjects that had been set as exercises for him by older brother William, and, in some instances, corrected by one of them.\\" Although the MS contains no date, due to certain topical references, An Island is generally believed to have been composed in late 1784. For example, there is a reference to the Great Balloon Ascension of September 15, when England's first airship rose from the Artillery Ground in Finsbury, watched by 220,000 Londoners. Other topical allusions include references to a performing monkey called Mr. Jacko, who appeared at Astley's Amphitheatre in Lambeth in July, a performing pig called Toby the Learned Pig, a Handel festival in Westminster Abbey in August, lectures on phlogiston, exhibitions of the microscope, and the Golden Square parties of Chevalier d'Eon.Ackroyd (1995: 91‚Äì92) Especially important in dating the text is Miss Gittipin's reference to Miss Filligree; \\"theres Miss Filligree work she goes out in her coaches & her footman & her maids & Stormonts & Balloon hats & a pair of Gloves every day & the sorrows of Werter & Robinsons & the Queen of Frances Puss colour.\\" Stormonts were a type of hat popular in the early 1780s but falling out of fashion by 1784. Balloon bonnets (linen cases stuffed with hair) had become extremely popular by late 1784, as had Robinson hats and gowns (named after the poet and actress Mary Robinson). The mention of Werter is also a reference to a hat, not the 1774 novel. The balloon bonnet and the Robinson hat were in vogue from late 1783 to late 1784, when they overlapped slightly with the increasing popularity of the Werter. By mid-1785, however, all three had fallen out of fashion.Erdman (1977: 95-96n14) This serves to situate An Island in late 1783-late 1784, and taken in tandem with the topical references, seems to confirm a date of the latter half of 1784. An Island was unpublished during Blake's lifetime, and there is no evidence that it ever got beyond the MS stage. Extracts were first published in The Light Blue, Volume II (1867), a literary magazine published by Cambridge University,Bentley and Nurmi (1964: 48) however, it has been suggested that perhaps Blake never intended for An Island to be published at all. Speaking of the sketches and poetry in Blake's Notebook, John Sampson writes they \\"are in the nature of rough jottings, sometimes mere doggerel set down from whim or to relieve a mood, and never probably [...] intended to see the light in cold print. Such without doubt is the fragment known as An Island in the Moon.\\"Sampson (1905: xx) Peter Ackroyd agrees with this suggestion, strongly believing that Blake never intended the piece to be read by the public.Ackroyd (1995: 90) The provenance of the MS is unknown prior to 1893, when it was acquired by Charles Fairfax Murray, who gave it to the Fitzwilliam Museum in 1905. At some stage prior to that time, at least one page was removed or lost, as page seventeen does not follow directly from page sixteen. A diagonal pencil inscription at the bottom of page seventeen, not in Blake's hand, reads, \\"a leaf is evidently missing before one.\\" Form The actual form of An Island in the Moon is difficult to pin down. Geoffrey Keynes classifies it as \\"an incomplete burlesque novel.\\"Keynes (1966: 884) Martha W. England compares it to an \\"afterpiece\\", one-act satirical plays which were popular in London at the time.England (1974: 484) Alicia Ostriker calls it simply a \\"burlesque.\\"Ostriker (1977: 876) Peter Ackroyd refers to it as a \\"satirical burlesque,\\" and also likens it to an afterpiece. Northrop Frye, S. Foster Damon and David V. Erdman all refer to it as simply a \\"prose satire.\\" Frye elaborates upon this definition, calling it \\"a satire on cultural dilettantism.\\"Frye (1947: 191) Erdman argues that the piece is a natural progression from Blake's previous work; \\"out of the sly ironist and angry prophet of Poetical Sketches emerges the self professed Cynic of An Island.\\" Indeed, Erdman argues that Quid is an evolution of the character of 'William his man' from the unfinished play King Edward the Third, often interpreted as being a self-portrait of Blake himself.Erdman (1977: 92) Martha W. England also believes it represents part of Blake‚Äôs artistic development and is something of a snapshot of his search for an authentic artistic voice; \\"we can watch a great metrist and a born parodist searching for his tunes, trying out dramatic systems and metrical systems, none of which were to enslave him. Here he cheerfully takes under his examining eye song and satire, opera and plague, surgery and pastoral, Chatterton and science, enthusiasm and myth, philanthropy and Handelian anthem, the Man in the Street and those children whose nursery is the street ‚Äì while he is making up his mind what William Blake shall take seriously [...] here, a master ironist flexes his vocal cords with a wide range of tone.\\"England (1974: 505) Similarly, Robert N. Essick, Joseph Viscomi and Morris Eaves see it as foreshadowing much of Blake's later work; \\"An Island in the Moon underscores the importance of the extensive stretches of humour and satire that show up frequently among his other writings. So, although Blake left it orphaned, untitled, and unfinished in a heavily revised manuscript, Island is in some sense a primary literary experiment for him, setting the undertone of much to follow.\\" An Island has no coherent, overall structure, no plot whatsoever, being instead a broad satire. According to Ackroyd, \\"it is not a generalised satire on a Swiftian model; it stays too close to [Blake's] own world for that.\\" As such, it is primarily composed of snatches of trivial conversation and witticisms, interspersed with songs and ballads. In this sense, it is structured similarly to Samuel Foote's improvised series of dramas Tea at the Haymarket, which lacked a definitive form so as to get around licensing regulations. England believes that Blake was consciously borrowing from Foote's style in composing An Island and as such, it is an \\"anti-play.\\"England (1974: 488) Nick Rawlinson agrees with England's assessment, although he feels that Samuel Foote may have been more of an influence than England allows for. Rawlinson reads the piece as primarily about reading itself, and the social implications of certain types of reading; \\"inside the apparently random concoction of prose, song and slapstick [...] lies an extraordinary, almost dazzling examination of the relationship between our habits of reading and the society they produce [...] Blake consistently and consciously foregrounds how our understanding of our society, our voices and even our perceptions are governed by our habits of reading [...] An Island contains a deliberate and careful plan to challenge [social] misreadings by teaching us how to read the world comically. It is nothing less than a degree course in comic Vision.\\"Rawlinson (2003: 99‚Äì100) Rawlinson argues that the literary references in the text are structured to mirror a 1707 Cambridge University pamphlet entitled A Method of Instructing Pupils (a guide on how to teach Philosophy). As such Rawlinson feels An Island is best described as \\"philosoparody.\\"Rawlinson (2003: 1001) Characters Many of the characters in An Island are parodies of Blake's friends and acquaintances, although there is considerable critical disagreement as to whom some characters represent. Indeed, some scholars question the usefulness of trying to discover whom any of them represent. Northrop Frye, for example, argues \\"the characters are not so much individuals as representatives of the various types of \\"reasoning\\" which are satirised.\\" Peter Ackroyd also suggests that understanding whom the characters represent is less important than understanding the satire at the heart of the piece. Similarly, Nick Rawlinson argues that trying to attach the characters to specific people \\"limits the scope of the work to the eighteenth-century equivalent of a scurrilous email [...] it is reasonable to assume that the various characters stand for something more than just amusing personality sketches [...] It may be more helpful to see the characters as a reflection not just of a real person but also of an attitude Blake wishes to question.\\"Rawlinson: 104‚Äì105) Nevertheless, much critical work has been done on endeavouring to unravel which real life person is behind each of the fictional characters. * Quid the Cynic ‚Äì based on Blake;Damon (1988: 199) represents cynicism and doubt; S. Foster Damon calls him \\"a lusty caricature of Blake himself [...] a poet who characteristically runs down those he admires most.\\"Damon (1988: 337) Rawlinson suggests his name may be derived from the word 'Quidnunc'; a popular term in the eighteenth century for a busybody and know-it-all.Rawlinson (2003: 105) * Suction the Epicurean ‚Äì based on Blake's brother, Robert; hates mathematics and science, and lives instead by his feelings. Damon believes he represents \\"the philosophy of the senses\\"Damon (1988: 200) and is \\"an all- absorbing atheist.\\"Damon (1988: 374) Rawlinson suggests he may be a composite of Robert Blake and the print seller Jemmy Whittle.Rawlinson (2003: 107) Suction is an Epicurean, a philosophical school despised by Blake, because of its rejection of the importance of the spirit, and reliance on materialism, which he associated with Francis Bacon. Circa 1808, Blake would write, \\"Bacon is only Epicurus over again.\\"Erdman (1982: 645); from 'Annotations to Joshua Reynolds' (c.1808) * Sipsop the Pythagorean ‚Äì Geoffrey Keynes suggests that Sipsop is based on the neoplatonist Thomas Taylor with whose work Blake was familiar. Keynes is supported in this by Alicia Ostriker. However, David V. Erdman, disputes this theory and instead suggests that Sipsop is based on William Henry Mathew, eldest son of Anthony Stephen Mathew. Erdman bases this argument on the fact that William Henry was apprenticed to the surgeon John Hunter, who is represented in An Island by Jack Tearguts, to whom Sipsop is apprenticed. On the other hand, Nancy Bogen believes that Sipsop is based on John Abernethy.Erdman (1977: 97n17) Sipsop is often posited as representing the science rejected by Suction, but Damon argues this cannot be so, as such science is represented by Inflammable Gass. To Damon's mind, this leaves Sipsop with something of an undefined role. As a Pythagorean, Sipsop is ideologically the opposite of Suction the Epicurean; Pythagoreanism embraces the mysticism that Epicureanism explicitly rejects. * Steelyard the Lawgiver ‚Äì based on Blake's close friend and fellow artist John Flaxman.Erdman (1977: 100) * Inflammable Gass ‚Äì Damon suggests he may be based on the scientist and philosopher Joseph Priestley, as Gass' reference to \\"flogiston\\" recalls Priestley's experiments with phlogiston, which were quite well known at the time. G.E. Bentley reaches a similar conclusion, citing a demonstration given at the Free Masons Tavern on Great Queen Street during which some phosphorus ignited and destroyed the lamp containing it. Bentley believes that this incident may have formed the basis for the broken glass during an experiment in chapter 10.Bentley (2001: 83) Erdman however, rejects this identification, arguing that there is no evidence Blake was familiar with either the demonstrations or the writings of Priestley. Instead, Erdman suggests that Gass may simply be a characteristic type representing all science in general. In 1951, Palmer Brown suggested that Gass may be based on the conjurer Gustavus Katterfelto, who was as famous as Priestley in London, and who carried out public experiments in Piccadilly. Although Erdman initially rejected Brown's theory, he changed his mind shortly before writing Blake: Prophet Against Empire, and ultimately came to support it.Erdman (1977: 93-94n13) Another possibility, suggested by W.H. Stevenson, is William Nicholson, author of An Introduction to Natural Philosophy, for which Blake engraved the title page vignette in 1781.Stevenson (2007: 44) Other possibilities, suggested by Stanley Gardner, are the physician George Fordyce and the scientist Henry Cavendish. Rawlinson suggests Gass could, at least in part, be based on the botanist Joseph Banks. * Obtuse Angle ‚Äì generally agreed to be based on James Parker, Blake‚Äôs fellow apprentice during his time with Basire.Erdman (1977: 89) George Mills Harper, however, believes that Angle is instead based on Thomas Taylor (Harper agrees with Erdman that Sipsop is not based on Taylor but on William Henry Mathew). Harper argues that Angle seems to be an educator, and his relationship with many of the other characters is that of a teacher and student. This is significant because there is evidence that Blake took lessons in Euclid under Taylor, hence Angle's apparent role as teacher.Harper (1961: 32) Erdman supports this theory.Erdman (1977: 506) Rawlinson suggests that Angle may be partially based on Blake's friend George Cumberland, as well as the antiquarian Francis Douce.Rawlinson (2003: 106) * Aradobo ‚Äì based on either Joseph Johnson, the first publisher to employ Blake as a copy-engraver,Erdman (1977: 96) or one of the book seller Edward brothers (James, John and Richard). In 1784, James and John had opened a book shop in Pall Mall, with Richard as their apprentice, and Blake would certainly have been familiar with the shop.Erdman (1977: 507) * Etruscan Column ‚Äì Harper believes that Column is based on the antiquarian John Brand.Harper (1961: 40) However, Brylowe points out that the Greek antiquarianism Blake is mocking is more in line with the work of William Hamilton.Brylowe (2012: 91) * Little Scopprell ‚Äì Erdman suggests he may represent J. T. Smith, but he acknowledges that this is based on guesswork only.Erdman (1977: 98n17) * Tilly Lally ‚Äì no known basis for this character, although he is often posited as representing elegance.England (1974: 493) * Mrs. Nannicantipot ‚Äì based on the poet and children's author Anna Laetitia Barbauld. * Gibble Gabble ‚Äì because she is married to Gass, she is usually seen as representing Joseph Priestley's real wife, Mary Priestley. However, there is some disagreement about whether Gass actually represents Priestley, and if not, then presumably, Gibble Gabble could no longer be posited as representing Mary. * Mrs Gimblet ‚Äì possibly based on Harriet Mathew.Bentley (2001: 82) Rawlinson suggests she could be based on Charlotte Lennox.Rawlinson (2003: 104) * Mrs Gittipin ‚Äì possibly based on Nancy Flaxman, John Flaxman's wife. * Ms. Sigtagatist ‚Äì Nancy Bogen suggests she is based on Harriet Mathew, but Erdman believes this is doubtful. The name \\"Sigtagatist\\" was first written \\"Sistagatist\\" in most places, but changed. Twice during the piece, she is sarcastically referred to as Mrs Sinagain; once by Tily Lally in Chapter 3d (\\"Ill tell you what Mrs Sinagain I dont think theres any harm in it\\"), and once by the narrator in Chapter 4 (\\"Ah,\\" said Mrs Sinagain. \\"I'm sure you ought to hold your tongue, for you never say any thing about the scriptures, & you hinder your husband from going to church\\"). * Jack Tearguts ‚Äì mentioned only; based on the surgeon and lecturer John Hunter, whose name Blake wrote in the manuscript before replacing it with Jack Tearguts. * Mr. Jacko ‚Äì mentioned only; possibly based on portrait painter Richard Cosway; probably named after a famous performing monkey well known in London at the time.Ackroyd (1995: 91) * Mrs. Nann ‚Äì mentioned only; Nancy Bogen believes she is based on Blake's wife, Catherine, but Erdman believes this is guesswork. Overview Page 8 of the only known manuscript of An Island in the Moon (note the different colour inks, indicating different periods of composition) Chapter 1 begins with a promise by the narrator to engage the reader with an analysis of contemporary thought, \\"but the grand scheme degenerates immediately into nonsensical and ignorant chatter.\\" A major theme in this chapter is that no one listens to anyone else;Bentley (2001: 81) \\"Etruscan Column & Inflammable Gass fix'd their eyes on each other, their tongue went in question & answer, but their thoughts were otherwise employed.\\" According to Erdman, \\"the contrast between appearance and reality in the realm of communication lies at the centre of Blake's satiric method.\\"Erdman (1977: 103) This chapter also introduces Blake's satiric treatment of the sciences and mathematics; according to Obtuse Angle, \\"Voltaire understood nothing of the Mathematics, and a man must be a fool ifaith not to understand the Mathematics.\\" Chapter 2d is the shortest chapter in the piece and is only one sentence long. The entire chapter reads: \\"Tilly Lally the Siptippidist Aradobo, the dean of Morocco, Miss Gittipin & Mrs Nannicantipot, Mrs Sigtagatist Gibble Gabble the wife of Inflammable Gass ‚Äì & Little Scopprell enter'd the room (If I have not presented you with every character in the piece call me *Arse‚Äî)\\" Chapter 3d introduces musical interludes, a technique which becomes increasingly important as the piece moves on. \\"Honour & Genius\\", sung by Quid, is a parody of a song in the James Harris pastoral The Spring (1762 ‚Äì reissued in 1766 as Daphnis and Amaryllis).England (1974: 498) The satirical vein continues in this chapter during the discussion of \\"Phebus\\", when Obtuse Angle claims \\"he was the God of Physic, Painting, Perspective, Geometry, Geography, Astronomy, Cookery, Chymistry, Conjunctives, Mechanics, Tactics, Pathology, Phraseology, Theology, Mythology, Astrology, Osteology, Somatology, in short every art & science adorn'd him as beads round his neck.\\" Chapter 4 continues with the satire in the form of a debate between Inflammable Gass and Mrs. Sigtagatist. When Sigtagatist tells Gass that he should always attend church on Sundays, Gass declares, \\"if I had not a place of profit that forces me to go to church I'd see the parsons all hang'd a parcel of lying.\\" Sigtigatist then proclaims \\"O, if it were not for churches & chapels I should not have liv'd so long.\\" She then proudly recalls a figure from her youth, Minister Huffcap, who would \\"kick the bottom of the Pulpit out, with Passion, would tear off the sleeve of his Gown, & set his wig on fire & throw it at the people he'd cry & stamp & kick & sweat and all for the good of their souls.\\" Chapter 5 looks at the inanity of the society depicted, insofar as an intellectual discussion of the work of Chatterton between Obtuse Angle, Little Scopprell, Aradobo and Tilly Lally descends into farce; \\"Obtuse Angle said in the first place you thought he was not [a Mathematician] & then afterwards when I said he was not you thought he was not. Why I know that ‚Äì Oh no sir I thought that he was not, but I ask'd to know whether he was. ‚Äì How can that be said Obtuse Angle how could you ask & think that he was not ‚Äì why said he. It came into my head that he was not. ‚Äì Why then said Obtuse Angle you said that he was. Did I say so Law I did not think I said that ‚Äì Did not he said Obtuse Angle Yes said Scopprell. But I meant said Aradobo I I I can't think Law Sir I wish you'd tell me, how it is.\\" Northrop Frye refers to this incident as \\"farcical conversational deadlock.\\"Frye (1947: 192) Chapter 6 continues to intersperse songs amongst the prose. \\"When old corruption\\", sung by Quid, is a satire on the medical profession and may have been suggested by The Devil Upon Two Sticks (1768), a three-act comedic satire by Samuel Foote, which was itself based on the satirical Alain-Ren√© Lesage novel Le Diable boiteux (1707). The Devil Upon Two Sticks had been revived on the London stage in 1784, so it would have been topical at the time of writing. The poem also seems to parody parts of Book II of the John Milton epic Paradise Lost (1667), particularly the scenes outlining the genealogy of the sentries of the Gates of Hell, Sin and Death. Chapter 6 is also an important chapter for Suction, insofar as it is here he outlines his primary philosophy; \\"Ah hang your reasoning I hate reasoning I do every thing by my feelings.\\" The satire in this section comes from Sipsop's discussion of the surgery of Jack Tearguts, and how his patients react; \\"Tho they cry ever so he'll Swear at them & keep them down with his fist & tell them that he'll scrape their bones if they don't lie still & be quiet.\\" The inherent but unacknowledged irony here recalls Sigtagatist's proud recollection of Minister Huffcap in Chapter 4. Chapter 7 sees Suction continue to espouse his philosophical beliefs; \\"Hang philosophy ‚Äì I would not give a farthing for it do all by your feelings and never think at all about it.\\" Similarly, Quid voices his own opinion of some of the most respected writers at the time; \\"I think that Homer is bombast & Shakespeare is too wild & Milton has no feelings they might be easily outdone Chatterton never writ those poems.\\" In relation to this criticism, Damon comments, \\"he is merely repeating the conventional chatter of the critics, which was the exact opposite of what Blake actually thought.\\"Damon (1988: 370) Chapter 8 contains references to and quotes from many of the works Blake was exposed to and influenced by at a young age. These references include allusions to Saint Jerome, John Taylor's Urania, or his Heavenly Muse (1630), Abraham Cowley's translation of Anacreon's lyric poem \\"The Grasshopper\\" (1656), Henry Wotton's Reliquae Wottonianae (1685), John Locke's An Essay Concerning Human Understanding (1690), Joseph Addison's Cato, a Tragedy (1712), Edward Young's Night-Thoughts (1742) and James Hervey's Meditations and Contemplations (1746) and Theron and Aspasio (1755). The Jerome reference is found in Steelyard's comment \\"Says Jerome happiness is not for us poor crawling reptiles of the earth Talk of happiness & happiness its no such thing ‚Äì every person has a something.\\" The Taylor reference is Steelyard‚Äôs poem; \\"Hear then the pride & knowledge of a Sailor/His sprit sail fore sail main sail & his mizen/A poor frail man god wot I know none frailer/I know no greater sinner than John Taylor.\\" Although Alicia Ostriker feels this is a reference to the preacher John Taylor,Ostriker (1977: 877) David Erdman argues that the lines closely parallel the opening of the poem Urania , and as such, the reference is more likely to the poet than the preacher. The Cowley reference is found in the poem \\"Phebe drest like beauties Queen\\", which contains the lines \\"Happy people who can be/In happiness compard with ye.\\" Erdman believes this to be derived from the lines in Cowley's translation of Anacreon, \\"Happy Insect! What can be/In Happiness compar'd to thee?\\" The Wotton reference is found in Steelyard's \\"My crop of corn is but a field of tares;\\" John Sampson believes this to be reference to the Chidiock Tichborne poem \\"Elegy\\" (1586), which Blake could have been familiar with from Wotton's Reliquae.Sampson (1905: xxiv) Locke is mentioned when Scopprell picks up one of Steelyard's books and reads the cover, \\"An Easy of Huming Understanding by John Lookye Gent.\\" Addison is referred to indirectly when Steelyard attributes the quote \\"the wreck of matter & the crush of worlds\\" to Edward Young, when it is actually from Addison's Cato. Both the reference to Young and Hervey's Meditations are found in the opening sentence of the chapter; \\"Steelyard the Lawgiver, sitting at his table taking extracts from Herveys Meditations among the tombs & Youngs Night thoughts.\\" The Theron reference is found when Steelyard announces to Obtuse Angle that he is reading the book. Chapter 9 includes a number of songs that seemingly have no real meaning, but which would rhythmically appeal to infants. For example, \\"This frog he would a wooing ride/Kitty alone Kitty alone/This frog he would a wooing ride/Kitty alone & I\\" was a real ditty popular in London at the time.England (1974: 500) Such songs possibly reflect Blake's childhood.Bentley (2001: 15‚Äì16, 26) Other songs in this chapter include \\"Lo the Bat with Leathern wing\\", which may be a combined parody of a line in Alexander Pope's An Essay on Man (1734); \\"Lo, the poor Indian\\", and a phrase in William Collins' \\"Ode to Evening\\"; \\"weak eyed bat/With short shrill shriek flits by on leathern wing.\\" Satire is found in this chapter in the songs \\"Hail Matrimony made of Love\\", which condemns marriage, and may have been inspired by The Wife Hater by John Cleveland (1669).Sampson (1905: 59) Satire is also present in \\"This city & this country\\", which mocks patriotism, and could be a parody of a patriotic ballad entitled \\"The Roast Beef of Old England\\" from Henry Fielding's play The Grub Street Opera (1731). This chapter also contains references to Thomas Sutton, founder of the Charterhouse School in 1611, the churchman Robert South and William Sherlock's A Practical Discourse upon Death (1689). Chapter 10 concludes with Inflammable Gass accidentally releasing a \\"Pestilence\\", which he fears will kill everyone on the Island; \\"While Tilly Lally & Scopprell were pumping at the air pump Smack went the glass. Hang said Tilly Lally. Inflammable Gass turn'd short round & threw down the table & Glasses & Pictures & broke the bottles of wind, & let out the Pestilence. He saw the Pestilence fly out of the bottle & cried out while he ran out of the room. Go come out come out you are we are putrified, we are corrupted. our lungs are destroy'd with the Flogiston this will spread a plague all thro' the Island he was down stairs the very first on the back of him came all the others in a heap so they need not bidding go.\\" However, no mention is made of the incident in the next chapter; a possible allusion to Blake's distrust of science. Chapter 11 is seen as the most important chapter by many critics insofar as it contains early versions of \\"The Little Boy lost\\", \\"Holy Thursday\\", and \\"Nurse's Song\\", all of which would appear in Songs of Innocence in 1789. This chapter also includes an incomplete description of Blake's method of illuminated printing. The description begins in the middle, with at least one preceding page missing, as Quid explains his method to Mrs. Gittipin; \\"... them Illuminating the Manuscript-Ay said she that would be excellent. Then said he I would have all the writing Engraved instead of Printed & at every other leaf a high finish'd print all in three Volumes folio, & sell them a hundred pounds a piece. They would Print off two thousand then said she whoever will not have them will be ignorant fools & will not deserve to live.\\" Damon has speculated that Blake may have destroyed the missing page(s) so as to preserve the secret of his method. Adaptations An Island in the Moon has been adapted for the stage twice. In 1971, Roger Savage adapted it into a two-act play entitled Conversations with Mr. Quid, which was staged at the University of Edinburgh as part of a week-long Blake conference.Phillips (1987: 23n35) The second adaptation was in 1983, when Blake scholar Joseph Viscomi adapted it into a one-act musical under the title An Island in the Moon: A Satire by William Blake, 1784. The piece was staged in the Goldwin Smith Hall on Cornell University's Central Campus as part of the Cornell Blake Symposium, Blake: Ancient and Modern. Viscomi wrote the adaptation himself, which included musical versions of \\"The Garden of Love\\" from Songs of Innocence and of Experience (1794) and \\"O why was I born with a different face\\", a poem from a letter written by Blake to Thomas Butts in 1803. Original music was composed by Margaret LaFrance. Department of Theatre lecturers Evamarii Johnson and Robert Gross directed and produced, respectively. Viscomi consolidated all of the events of the piece into a single night in a tavern (owned by Tilly Lally, who also doubled as the narrator), and reduced the cast from fifteen to fourteen by removing Mrs Nannicantipot. Viscomi also moved the last section to earlier in the play, and thus the play ends with the various songs from Chapter 11 which would appear in Songs of Innocence.

Berry was a member of the Connacht Women's Franchise League, and the wife of the Reverend James Fleetwood Berry, Rector of St. Nicholas' Collegiate Church. She was an active member of the Women's National Health Association.  Early life and education  Mary Fleetwood Berry was born on 24 April 1865 in Monkstown, a suburb of Cork, Ireland, to Abraham Thomas Chatterton and Jane Chatterton of Dublin. In 1887 she married Reverend James Fleetwood Berry of Tullamore, County Offaly, with whom she had one son. Alongside her husband's profession as a minister, she was known for having a strong Evangelical Protestant identity. She was elected president of the Irish Women's Temperance Union in 1900 and 1912. She was also an active member of the Connacht Women's Franchise League, one of the most outspoken and public manifestations of women's discontent and radical feminism in Ireland. Its primary goal was to secure women's suffrage within Irish Home Rule. In 1917 Berry's son was killed in action in France from wounds received at Bait Aiesa in Mesopotamia, which is now modern Iraq. She died on 25 January 1956 at the age of 90 years old in Salthill, County Galway, Ireland.  Ideas, influences and political stances  She was elected president of Irish Women's Temperance Union in 1900 and 1912. The Temperance movement was a social movement against the consumption of alcoholic beverages. Temperance movements typically criticize alcohol intoxication, promote complete abstinence (teetotalism), or use their political influence to press the government to enact alcohol laws to regulate the availability of alcohol or even its complete prohibition. In January 1913, Mary Fleetwood Berry was instrumental in establishing a branch of the constitutional Irish Women's Suffrage Federation, an organisation then linking twenty-six societies nationally. The federation was founded in 1911 to unite scattered suffrage societies in Ireland. The role of Mary Fleetwood Berry, whose political contacts were conservative and religious, represents a shift in influence. With the outbreak of the First World War, Moon, she and many other Galway suffragists became involved in efforts concerning the war, such as fundraising and provisions. In this capacity she attended the first annual meeting of the Galway War Fund Association in Galway town hall on 31 May 1916. The law that changed things for women's right to vote was called the Representation of the People Act, 1918, But not for every woman ‚Äì just women over 30, who had property rights or a university education. The act also gave the vote to all men over the age of 21. When it was passed, because of the criteria around a ‚Äòproperty qualification‚Äô, this meant that just 40% of all the women in the United Kingdom could vote. Meanwhile, property and other restrictions for men were actually abolished, and men in the armed forces were allowed to vote from the age of 21. Upon gaining independence from the United Kingdom in 1922, Irish women over the age of 21 had to wait until the Constitution was drawn up to ensure full and equal voting rights. This happened in 1922 with the Constitution of the Irish Free State Act. See also * Emily Anderson * Mary Donovan O'Sullivan * Florence Moon * Sarah Persse References * Moran, Gerard P. (1996).

Design The Wakatake-class destroyers were essentially slightly modified ships with a deeper draft to improve handling characteristics in heavy seas, particularly against rolling. Weaponry layout, general arrangement and silhouette were all identical with the Momi class. The small displacement and shallow draft of the Wakatake class limited their use as fleet escorts. As with the Momi class, in the 1920s and 1930s, they were mainly used in Chinese coastal waters. Karukaya was refitted in the winter of 1941‚Äì1942, with one of its 120 mm guns being replaced by six 25 mm Type 96 anti-aircraft cannon in two triple mounts, together with several machine guns. The destroyer's minelaying and sweeping gear was removed to allow four depth charge throwers and up to 48 depth charges to be fitted.

He served as Bishop of Galveston-Houston from 1950 to 1975. Biography Wendelin Nold was born in Bonham, Texas, to Wendelin Joseph and Mary Elizabeth (n√©e Charles) Nold. After attending parochial schools in Cleburne and Fort Worth, he studied at St. Mary's Seminary in La Porte, from where he obtained a Bachelor of Arts degree in 1921. He then furthered his studies at the Pontifical North American College in Rome, and there earned a doctorate in sacred theology in 1925. While in Rome, he was ordained to the priesthood on April 11, 1925. Upon his return to Texas, Nold served as a curate at Sacred Heart Cathedral in Dallas, and became the first pastor of Christ the King Church in 1941. In addition to his pastoral duties, he also served in the chancery as a consultor, synodal judge, synodal examiner, director of the Confraternity of Christian Doctrine, and director of Catholic Action. He was raised to the rank of Papal Chamberlain in 1936, Domestic Prelate in 1942, and prothonotary apostolic in 1946. On November 29, 1947, Nold was appointed Coadjutor Bishop of Galveston and Titular Bishop of Sasima by Pope Pius XII. He received his episcopal consecration on February 25, 1948 from Bishop Joseph Patrick Lynch, with Bishops Christopher Edward Byrne and Augustine Danglmayr serving as co- consecrators. Upon the death of Bishop Byrne, Nold succeeded him as the fifth Bishop of Galveston on April 1, 1950. He was the first native Texan to hold that office. Due to the tremendous growth in the City of Houston, in 1959 Bishop Nold was permitted by Rome to build a Cathedral of convenience in Houston, and Sacred Heart Church was named co-cathedral. This did not change the status of the City of Galveston as an Episcopal city, however it did permit full Episcopal ceremonies to be held in Houston, as well at St. Mary's Cathedral Basilica in Galveston.AMERICAN CATHOLICS/Bishops celebrate 200th birthday The diocese was renamed the Diocese of Galveston-Houston on July 25, 1959. In September 1961, Nold ordered that all Catholic schools in the diocese be racially integrated. Due to progressive blindness, he was prompted to resign from the administration of the diocese. In April 1963, he received, as his coadjutor bishop, Bishop John Louis Morkovsky, who assumed charge of the administration of the diocese. He attended the Second Vatican Council from 1962 to 1965. During his tenure he established forty-seven parishes and fourteen missions, as well as several schools. After twenty-five years as bishop, Nold resigned on April 22, 1975. He later died at age 81.

He was killed in a car accident at the height of the battle. Military career World War I: 1914‚Äì1918 Billotte graduated from the Saint-Cyr military academy in 1896 and joined the infantry. In World War I he served as a brigade commander and as an officer of the General Staff. Interwar period: 1918‚Äì1939 In 1919 and 1920 he was head of the French Military Mission in Poland. He served the rest of the 1920s and 1930s in colonial posts, in French Syria, French Tunisia, French Morocco and French Indochina, where he was Commander-in-Chief from 1930 to 1932. He was promoted to general in 1927. In 1933 Billotte returned to France, where he served as a Member of the Supreme War Council, President of the Consultative Committee for Colonial Defence and Military Governor of Paris. World War II: 1939‚Äì1940 When World War II broke out in September 1939, Billotte was 64 and close to retirement, but he was appointed Commander in Chief of the 1st Army Group based in northern France adjacent to the Belgian border. When the Germans attacked on 10 May, Billotte's forces advanced into Belgium under the agreed Allied plan, on the assumption that the Germans would repeat their invasion of Belgium in World War I, attacking through Belgium into northern France, and then advance on Paris. According to the Manstein Plan, the German attack in Belgium was a feint designed to draw the Allied forces northwards, while the real German assault was aimed at the Ardennes sector further south. Like all the Allied commanders, Billotte failed to discern the German plan.Julian Jackson, The Fall of France, Oxford 2003 On 12 May Billotte was given the task of co- ordinating the operations of the French, Belgian and British armies in Belgium. He lacked the staff and the experience for this task, and is reported to have burst into tears when informed of it.Jackson, pg. 85 He failed to co- operate with the British commander, General Lord Gort, and the Belgian commander, King Leopold. By 15 May Billotte's morale was \\"at rock bottom.\\"Jackson, pg. 86 After a meeting with Gort on 18 May, he remarked to a British officer: \\"I'm shattered and I can't do anything against these Panzers.\\"Julian Jackson, pg. 86 On 20 May the British government, alarmed at the situation, sent the Chief of the Imperial General Staff, General Edmund Ironside, to confer with Gort and Billotte. Ironside later wrote: \\"I found Billotte and Blanchard all in a state of complete depression. No plan, no thought of a plan. Ready to be slaughtered. Defeated at the head without casualties... I lost my temper and shook Billotte by the button of his tunic. The man is completely beaten.\\"Jackson, pg. 86 Ironside effectively took over the co-ordinating role from Billotte and organised an unsuccessful attack southwards towards Arras in the hope of checking the German advance. Finally realising the threat posed by the rapid German advance from the Ardennes towards the sea, the French commander-in-chief, General Maxime Weygand, ordered Billotte to withdraw his forces southwards. At a meeting in Ypres on 21 May, Weygand found Billotte depressed and pessimistic, \\"heavily marked by the fatigues and anxieties of the past two weeks.\\" Julian Jackson, pg. 61 After leaving this conference, Billotte was severely injured when his staff car was involved in an accident, and died after two days in a coma. The British general Henry Pownall (Gort's Chief of Staff) said: \\"With all respect, he's no loss to us in this emergency.\\"Jackson, pg. 88 Billotte's son Pierre Billotte also graduated from √âcole sp√©ciale militaire de Saint-Cyr in 1926; joined the Free French movement and had a distinguished military and political career in postwar France.

They were especially unique when seen on color television, which was also on the rise in the 1960s. Both the National Football League and All-America Football Conference had used colored uniforms in the 1940s.

The company serves all sports markets in the United States, but focuses primarily on smaller venues such as high schools, recreation parks, and college facilities and is most active in the southeastern United States. History Electro-Mech is an offshoot of a company based in Macon, Georgia called Peach State Amusements. The original company was known for building and servicing pinball machines. Peach State had a colorful history which included servicing various games that had been modified to facilitate gambling‚Äîan illegal practice in the state of Georgia. Peach State pursued the production of scoreboards in the early 1960s, but the company closed before having significant impact on the scoreboard industry. Electro-Mech was founded by a handful of former Peach State employees with capital supplied by Mr. Francis Shurling. Shurling was a native of Wrightsville, Georgia, and arranged for the new scoreboard manufacturing facility to be built there. The doors opened in 1963. In the early years of Electro-Mech Charles McMichael and Hilton Holton became stockholders. Mr. Holton retired in 2001 and sold his stock back to the company a few years later, while the Shurling and McMichael families continue ownership of Electro-Mech. Products and Services Electro-Mech was created with a single purpose in mind: to manufacture scoreboards. Over the years the company has dabbled in a variety of other activities ranging from building wiring sub- assemblies used in cherry picker lifts to Christmas tree farming. The core business of scoreboards has remained the company's primary focus and primary source of revenue. By volume, Electro-Mech manufactures more baseball scoreboards than any other sports category. Basketball is the second most popular sport by volume and football the third. Soccer, hockey, and a handful of specialty scoreboards round out the main product line. Electro-Mech manufactures a variety of accessories for use with their scoreboards. Control consoles, wireless RF modems sets, and customizable ID panels are all common accessories manufactured by Electro-Mech. Other accessories, such as horns and data cable, are outsourced. Technology For over twenty years, 1967‚Äì1989, Electro-Mech scoreboards were designed around electro-mechanical technology with rotating motors and other moving parts to turn on and off the light bulbs that formed numbers. In 1989 Electro-Mech released its first attempt at using solid state electronics for a control system‚Äîthat is, a system with no moving parts. This shift in technology signaled the beginning of a series of innovations that have kept the company's product line changing and expanding at an ever increasing rate. Electro-Mech rolled out a line of scoreboards controlled by microprocessors in 1992. The first displays to use light emitting diodes (LEDs) instead of light bulbs came off of the assembly line in 1996. In 1999 the company offered a wireless control system marketed under the ScoreLink brand name. In 2002 Electro-Mech began building outdoor scoreboards with super-bright LEDs. In recent years the company has focused on improving the reliability of the basic sub-systems within their scoreboards and providing new options for high-end scoreboard packages including video displays. New options manufactured within the Wrigtsville plant include ID panels that incorporate non-rectangular elements such as arches and domes. For video displays and message centers packaged with their scoreboards, Electro- Mech has entered into a partnership with Vantage LED, a California-based manufacturer with experience building electronic signs for the sports market. Sales and Marketing Unlike the two major American scoreboard manufacturers (Daktronics and Trans-Lux, which are public companies), Electro-Mech is a privately held company that does not release revenue figures and sales breakdowns for public consumption. Some of the company's marketing literature has provided an estimate of over 40,000 signs in service.http://www.electro- mech.com/images/catalog_pdf/Catalog-70.pdf Assuming an average lifespan of ten to fifteen years for a scoreboard, one can guess that Electro-Mech produces well over 1,000 units per year. Electro-Mech occupied a special niche in the scoreboard market for most of its first few decades. The vast majority of its scoreboards were sold to bottlers of Coca-Cola, Pepsi, and other soft drinks throughout the 1970s, 1980s, and 1990s. The bottlers provided Electro-Mech scoreboards to schools, recreation parks, and other facilities where their soft drinks were served. In exchange, the facility operators signed contracts to exclusively stock vending machines and fountain dispensers with soft drinks purchased directly from the bottler for a number of years. The scoreboards, sometimes paid for in full by the bottlers, sometimes only partially funded, typically included ID panels with soft drink logos. It is a running joke among the Electro-Mech sales staff that nobody has ever heard of their company because all their customers think they have a \\"Coca-Cola scoreboard\\" or a \\"Pepsi scoreboard\\". A gradual shift in bottler strategy starting around the year 2000 has lessened the intensity with which they court school systems and other customers who provide services primarily to children. For this reason the bottlers have become less interested in purchasing scoreboards. Thus Electro-Mech has recently shifted its marketing tactics toward direct sales and away from bottler sales. This is evident from their web site being revamped (most recently in the spring of 2017) with an emphasis on search engine marketing.

The performer stands inside the Cyr wheel and grasps its rim, causing it to roll and spin gyroscopically while performing acrobatic moves in and around the rotating wheel. The apparatus and its movement vocabulary have some similarities with the German wheel, but whereas the German wheel consists of two large rings linked together by horizontal crossbars and has handles for the performer to hold onto, the modern Cyr wheel consists of a single ring and has no handles. The Cyr wheel takes its name from Daniel Cyr, who revived its popularity, utilising it as a circus apparatus at the end of the 20th century. Cyr wheel requires a solid, non-slippery surface such as a dance floor, concrete or stage and a relatively large performance area.  Origin  There are records of people using a similar apparatus as sports equipment during the mid-20th century in Germany, where it was referred to as the Einreifen or mono wheel, having been developed by Adalbert von Rekowski as a variation on Otto Feick's popular Rh√∂nrad (German wheel) ‚Äì which is made from two parallel metal rings and resembles a large hamster wheel.  Construction  Modern Cyr wheels are typically made of stainless steel tubing or aluminium tubing approximately in diameter. They are often composed of 3 or 5 individual pieces fixed together by steel or aluminium couplings. They may be painted and covered with an anti- slip plastic coating to add friction and protect the metal. Smaller wheels spin faster, work better for smaller spaces, and make \\"no hand\\" tricks easier than larger wheels. Larger wheels are more graceful and there is more room for suspensions.  Popularity  Around 1996, the wheel's construction was adapted and developed as a circus apparatus by Daniel Cyr, a graduate of the National Circus School in Montreal and co-founder of the contemporary circus troupe Cirque √âloize. Cyr claims the idea came to him from a large hula hoop and an old circular wrought-iron coat rack. His design for the wheel went through several iterations, evolving from steel to aluminum, adding a PVC coating, and eventually implementing a multi-part design that could be disassembled for easier transportation. Cyr first performed with the apparatus in the Cirque √âloize production of Excentricus, which toured North America, Europe and Asia between 1997 and 2002. He subsequently presented a Cyr wheel circus act at the 2003 Festival Mondial du Cirque de Demain in Paris and won the Silver Medal for his performance. Since its recent popularization as a circus skill, hundreds of circus artists from around the world have performed in the wheel and it is now taught in several major circus schools. The USA Wheel Gymnastics Federation and the International Rhoenradturnen Verband, with significant assistance from coaches and athletes from the √âcole Nationale de Cirque de Montr√©al, developed rules for Cyr wheel competition. The first such competition was held in Chicago in October 2011 and the first world championships in Cyr wheel competition was held during the 10th World Championships in Wheel Gymnastics, July 7‚Äì14, 2013 in Chicago. Professional circus schools that offer advanced training on the Cyr wheel include: the Ecole Sup√©rieure des Arts du Cirque (ESAC) in Belgium, the National Centre for Circus Arts in the UK, the Centre national des arts du cirque (CNAC) in France, and the √âcole nationale de cirque in Montreal, (NICA) the National Institute of Circus Arts in Australia.  Glossary  * The Waltz ‚Äì the performer stands inside the Cyr wheel and rotates 360 in a continuous circle pattern, resembling the dance, the waltz. * Superman ‚Äì with the Cyr wheel spinning in a circle the performer holds on with their hands and kicks out with their legs in a pull up position, resembling the comic book hero Superman. * Coin ‚Äì with the Cyr wheel spinning the performer locks their shoulders and forces the Cyr wheel into a flat spin, resembling a coin losing speed after being spun on its edge. This trick can be performed face up or face down. * Orbit ‚Äì the performer stands in the centre of the Cyr wheel, remaining in one spot, and spins the Cyr wheel around them in 180 increments. * Boomerang ‚Äì Standing outside of the Cyr Wheel the performer rolls it away from them in a flat spin, on its own the Cyr wheel arcs around them eventually making its way back to its starting point where it is caught by the performer, resembling the action of a boomerang. * Skate start ‚Äì with one foot on the wheel, the performer pushes off with the other foot like they are riding a skateboard.

Moored on Expo grounds in Vancouver's False Creek, it was the second floating McDonald's location in the world (the first being in St Louis, Missouri), intended to showcase future technology and architecture. Although the floating design allowed for the barge to operate in a new location following the exhibition, the derelict McBarge was anchored empty in Burrard Inlet from 1991, amid industrial barges and an oil refinery, until it was moved in December 2015 to Maple Ridge, British Columbia. Apart from brief use by its original owner, McDonald's, in 1986, the McBarge has never actively been used for anything and has been drifting from owner to owner for thirty-four years.  History  The restaurant was designed by Robert Allan Ltd. for Expo 1986 and was one of five McDonald's locations on the Expo grounds, all of which were constructed for a total of $12 million. McDonald's originally intended to continue using it as a restaurant after Expo '86, but the barge remained empty at the Expo grounds until 1991, when the new owner of the grounds forced McDonald's to remove it. It has since been anchored derelict in Burrard Inlet, north of Burnaby, British Columbia. In 2003, Marvel Entertainment and New Line Cinema rented the barge as a filming location for the 2004 film Blade: Trinity as the lair of the Nightstalkers. In June 2009, the McBarge's current owner, Gastown developer Howard Meakin, submitted a proposal to the Mission city council for a waterfront development on the Fraser River, with the former McBarge as the centrepiece. Named \\"Sturgeon's on the Fraser\\", the development would include multiple restaurants and a marina complex, including paddlewheeler excursions and float plane service to Victoria and Nanaimo. As of August 2010, the proposal enjoyed local support, but awaited council approval. Concerns over float plane noise and other environmental issues meant the development was ultimately rejected. Other proposals that have been put forward without owner interest include using the barge as a homeless shelter to alleviate overcrowding in Vancouver's current temporary shelters. In December 2015, Meakin announced that the barge would soon be leaving Burrard Inlet after nearly 30 years. It was moved to Maple Ridge, British Columbia on December 22. The barge was scheduled for a $4.5-million refit there, before being relocated to an undisclosed location. In 2017, the barge's owners announced plans to convert it into an attraction called the Deep Discovery Centre. An event was planned for 21 October 2017 to launch a crowdfunding campaign, but was cancelled due to weather concerns. A petition to Vancouver City council to give the barge Historic Place Status received only 185 signatures. No mention has been made of a rescheduled event, its Facebook and Twitter have not been updated since 2017 and its YouTube account has been closed.

Biography  He was born February 20, 1905, in the village Derman in a peasant family. From 1917 to 1920 he studied at a four-grade elementary school in Derman. In 1921‚Äì1925 he studied at the Kremenets Ukrainian private gymnasium. Before he finished his secondary education, he was called up for service in the Polish Army in 1927, and later deserted in August of that year. He escaped to Germany. At first he worked delivering coal. With the help of a supportive German family, Samchuk continued his studies at the University of Breslau. In 1929, Samchuk moved to Prague, Czechoslovakia. He was attracted by the city's vibrant Ukrainian community and the Ukrainian Free University in which he enrolled, and where he was active in the Students' Academic Society. Ulas Samchuk considered Oleksandr Oles, Spiridon Cherkasenko, Oleksa Stefanovych, Oksana Lyaturynska, Oleg Olzhych, Mykhailo Mukhyn, Mykola Butovych, Robert Lisovsky, Stepan Smal- Stotsky, and Dmytro Doroshenko to be among those who created \\"his Prague\\" at that time. He graduated Ukrainian Free University in 1931. In 1932, while in Prague, Samchuk first heard about the holodomor unleashed by Soviet dictator Joseph Stalin upon the Ukrainian people. He travelled back into Soviet Ukraine to witness the horror firsthand, and in response wrote the novel Maria (1934)‚Äì‚Äìthe first literary work about the famine, and a powerful characterization of village life at the time. In 1937, on the initiative of Yevhen Konovalets, a cultural office of the Ukrainian nationalist leadership headed by Oleh Olzhych was established. Prague became the center of the Cultural Office, and one of the main institutions was the Section of artists, writers and journalists, chaired by Samchuk. Ulas Samchuk's Monument in Zdolbuniv In 1941 he returned to Volyn as a member of one of the OUN marching groups, where during 1941‚Äì1942, worked as editor of the newspaper Volyn, before fleeing to Germany in 1944, where he founded and headed the literary- artistic organization MUR until 1948. In 1948, he emigrated to Canada and became the leader of the Slovo Association of Ukrainian Writers in Exile. The writer died in Toronto on July 9, 1987.  Legacy  He published his first short story, \\"On Old Paths\\", in 1926 in the Warsaw magazine Nasha Besida. In Samchuk's most outstanding work, the Volyn trilogy (I‚ÄìIII, 1932‚Äì1937), a collective image of a Ukrainian young man of the late 1920s and early 1930s is derived, which seeks to find Ukraine's place in the world. From 1929 he began to collaborate regularly with the Literary-Scientific Bulletin, The Bells (magazines published in Lviv), The Independent Thought (Chernivtsi), the Nation-Building (Berlin), and the Antimony (without a permanent location). Samchuk concurrently wrote the novel Kulak(1932) about the eternal commitment of the Ukrainian peasant to tilling the land and the undying optimism of farmers. His next important work was the two-volume novel The Mountains Speak (1934) which explored Carpatho-Ukraine's struggle against Hungary. In 1947 he graduated from the drama \\"Noise of the Mill\\". The unfinished trilogy Ost: Frost Farm (1948) and Darkness (1957), depicts the Ukrainian man and his role in the unusual and tragic conditions of interwar and modern sub-Soviet reality. The topics of Samchuk's latest books are the struggle of the Ukrainian Insurgent Army in Volhynia (the novel What Doesn't Heal Fire, 1959) and the life of Ukrainian emigrants in Canada (On Hard Land, 1967). Memoirs of Five to Twelve (1954) and On a White Horse (1956) are devoted to the experience of World War II.

Phil's professional career started at Leatherhead in Puss in Boots playing the back end of the donkey. Seasons in rep followed at Guildford, Derby, Nottingham, Birmingham, Oxford and Newcastle as well as television, radio and some film work in Hollywood. Foreign touring for the British Council, including three years with Sir Michael Redgrave coupled with seasons at Regent's Park and the Young Vic where he played Hamlet directed by Michael Bogdanov, developed a love for Shakespeare. Associations with Tim Carroll, Master of Verse at Shakespeare's Globe, included touring Germany and playing Prospero in Maidstone Prison with the inmates playing the other parts. He met his wife, Susannna Best, while they were touring with the English Shakespeare Company and together they set up the charity, Shakespeare Link. Their vision was to access Shakespeare beyond the confines of theatre or academe, as a stimulus for communication and debate. They worked in the community, with therapists, with young people and senior citizens as well as in hospitals and prisons; teaching, directing and performing took them to Poland, Bulgaria, Romania, Beirut, the Philippines, Tunisia, Mauritius, Indonesia, Malaysia, the US and Canada. Now settled on the family smallholding in the Upper Wye Valley they have been translating Shakespeare into BSL, working with local schools and groups and running ‚ÄòHave-a-go Shakespeare‚Äô sessions with all comers. In 2006 they headed up a team to plant the magical Willow Globe, woven of living willow and open to the sky, which they run both as a producing and a receiving house. Such is the success of the Willow Globe Community Company, under Phil's guidance, that it has been invited to play CADW heritage sites and, by the RSC, to perform at Stratford. In 1996 Phil founded 'Shakespeare Link' with his wife, Susanna Best (mother of the actress Eve Best), and is focused on broadening the appeal and accessibility of Shakespeare. This work was further extended with the establishment of the Willow Globe theatre on land at their home near Llanwrthwl, Powys in Wales.

Services include business process outsourcing, medical transcription, outsourcing of animation, and the like. It is part of the ten-point agenda of President Gloria Macapagal-Arroyo and is one of the five \\"super-regions\\" outlined in her 2006 State of the Nation Address. The completion of the Philippine Cyber Corridor was expected to accelerate the growth of the Information Technology and Business Process Management (ITM-BPM) Industry in the country. Most recent figures according to the International Labour Organization have shown a total revenue of $18.4 billion in the entire Philippine BPO industry for the year 2014. This figure formed 6 per cent of the entire GDP that year and employed 1.03 million people. The Information Technology and Business Process Association of the Philippines (IBPAP) and the Philippines‚Äô Department of Science and Technology (DOST) outlined in their road map for 2011‚Äì2016 forecasts that the BPO industry would reach a target of $25 billion in revenues by 2016. This would form 7.3 per cent of the country's GDP and employ 1.2 million people. The ITM-BPM sector was also expected to support 3.2 million indirect jobs by 2016, which would comprise employees in the Information and Communications Technology (ICT) sector as well as research facilities. History The 1987 Constitution of the Philippines cited Information and Communications Technology (ICT) as a key sector to the nation's progress. The Philippine Cyber Corridor was thus conceived as a business that would be able to compete on the international ICT market. In her sixth State of the Nation Address in 2006, Gloria Macapagal-Arroyo promised that her administration would develop the Philippine Cyber Corridor along with other ‚Äúnatural ‚Äòsuper regions‚Äô of the Philippines\\". Arroyo believed that the corridor had the potential for increasing telecommunications, technology and education in the country. In addition, she saw the development of the corridor as a counterpoint to the rising number of Overseas Filipino Workers (OFWs), as members of the work force would ideally no longer have to leave the country in order to secure a job. Furthermore, she promised budget increases for science & technology and education, both important to telecommunications. The Arroyo administration thus embarked on a campaign to increase telecommunications- related services in the country. In 2004, the Commission on Information and Communications Technology (CICT) was established. One of its aims was to fashion the Philippine Cyber Corridor after the Multimedia Super Corridor (MSC) in Malaysia, which was built in 1997. Services The PCC hosts BPO companies, call centers, animations studios, software development and gaming businesses, medical and legal transcription outfits, knowledge process outsourcing (KPO) outfits, and back office operations of multinational companies. Effect on Local Economy The development of the PCC along key cities in Luzon, Visayas, and Mindanao also aims to create new IT related jobs for fresh graduates of the respective cities. In creating a demand for the IT industry, local schools and colleges were also inclined to adapt their curriculum to equip their students with skills for the IT sector. Indirectly, the development of the PCC across the nation has also resulted in numerous opportunities for other businesses such to flourish. The hospitality sector, specifically hotels and restaurants catering to ICT and BPO employees, has seen notable growth from this.  Locations  According to Arroyo's 2006 SONA, the corridor runs 600 miles from the city of Baguio in the north of the country to the city of Zamboanga in the south of the country. Call centers have opened in Bacolod City, Iloilo, Cagayan de Oro and Baguio. Business process outsourcing operations have also sprung up in Angeles, Legaspi, and Tacloban. Medical transcription agents centers have been established in Dumaguete, Davao, and Naga.  Super Regions  In August 19, 2006, Executive Order No. 561 was declared by Former President Gloria Macapagal- Arroyo, stating the formation of ‚Äúsuper‚Äù regions and mandate of the super regional development champions. The Philippine economy was to be restructured into \\"super\\" regions to bolster the natural advantages of five distinct sub- economies regions of the country in order to create opportunity across the country. Five geographical units were grounded into the following \\"super\\" regions and would have respective development themes: a) Northern Luzon Agribusiness Quadrangle for agribusiness and was to be composed of Regions I, II, Cordillera Administrative Region (CAR), and the northern part of the provinces of Aurora (north of Baler), Tarlac (north of Tarlac City), Nueva Ecija (north of Cabanatuan City), and Zambales (north of Subic); b) Luzon Urban Beltway for a globally competitive industrial and service center, to be composed of the National Capital Region, (NCR), Region IV-A, the provinces of Bulacan, Bataan, Pampanga, Mindoro, Marinduque, and the southern parts of the provinces of Tarlac, Zambales, Aurora and Nueva Ecija; c) Central Philippines for tourism, to be composed of Regions V, VI, VII, and VIII, and the provinces of Romblon, Palawan, and Camiguin, and the Island of Siargao; d) Agribusiness Mindanao for agribusiness, to be composed of Regions IX, X except Camigiun, XI, XII, Caraga except Siargao, and the Autonomous Region in Muslim Mindanao; and e) Cyber Corridor for information and communication technology and knowledge economy, which traverses the above \\"super\\" regions from Baguio to Cebu to Davao. Development champions were also assigned for each super region, and their roles included serving as catalyst for development of the strategic theme in his area, ensuring the implementation of priority programs and projects, work out operational policies and remedial actions, as well as submitting a monthly report to the Presidential Management staff. The Development Champions are the following: a) North Luzon Agribusiness Quadrangle - PMS Director-General Arthur Yap; b) Luzon Urban Beltway - Subic- Clark Alliance for Development Chairman Edgardo Pamintuan; c) Central Philippines - Secretary of Tourism Joseph Ace Durano; Secretary Cerge Remonde shall be the Cabinet Officer for Regional Development of region VII; d) Agribusiness Mindanao - Presidential Adviser for the Peace Process Jesus Dureza; e) Cyber Corridor - Commission on Information and Communication Technology Chairman Ramon Sales.  Next Wave Cities  Former President Gloria Macapagal-Arroyo served as a guest speaker at the Angeles University Foundation (AUF) on February 1, 2010, and at the Jose Rizal University on February 2, 2010 during her ‚Äúcyber corridor‚Äù tour. This tour started in Pamapanga and was said to highlight the former president's achievements in terms of the digital infrastructure built during her term as well as the rise of the business process outsourcing (BPO) industry. During her speech, the former president mentioned that the cyber corridor stretched from ‚Äúthe north from Metro Pampanga and goes down to the south of Davao City.‚Äù Arroyo also listed 10 urban areas in the Philippines that known as ‚ÄúNext Wave Cities‚Äù also form the cyber corridor. These cities include: Metro Laguna, Metro Cavite, Iloilo, Davao, Bacolod, Metro Pampanga, Metro Bulacan, Cagayan de Oro, Central Bulacan and Lipa. These cities are said to be the ‚Äúbest new destinations of the ICT industry.\\" On 2016, 10 cities were proclaimed as the official Next Wave Cities based on the following criteria: talent, infrastructure cost, and business environment. The cities are, in alphabetical order: Baguio City, Cagayan de Oro City, Dagupan City, Dasmarinas City, Dumaguete City, Lipa City, Malolos City, Naga City, Sta. Rosa City, and Taytay City. Apart from these Next Wave Cities, 10 ‚ÄúNew Emerging Cities‚Äù are also recognized for the potential in becoming Next Wave Cities. These cities are, in alphabetical order: Balanga City, Batangas City, Iriga City, Laoag City, Legazpi City, Puerto Princesa City, Roxas City, Tarlac City, Tuguegarao City, and Zamboanga City.

History  Once considered a winter novelty associated with winter festivals throughout the northern United States and Canada, ice bowling is slowly growing into a more established sport in areas with hibernal climates. For instance, in February 2009, the World Ice Bowling Championships took place in Anchorage, Alaska as part of the Anchorage Fur Rendezvous. Such events attest to the rising significance of the fledgling sport.  Game Play  Ice bowling during the Anchorage Fur Rondy. Ice bowling is strictly an amateur sport and no professional sport association exists for the game yet. Ice bowling lanes are often cleared from natural bodies of ice such as lakes, rivers, or streams, or are created from a field of compacted snow by drizzling with water and allowing the field to freeze solid in due course, a process similar to creating an improvised ice skating rink. Scoring, game format, and general rules and regulations parallel 10 pin bowling quite closely. However, similar to bumper bowling, hay or straw bails are often used in place of gutters, allowing the bowling ball to ricochet its way down the bowling lane. Another notable divergence from modern 10 pin bowling is the lack of automatic ball return mechanisms, necessitating a human lane attendant at the end of the ice lane in order to reset the bowling pins after the bowling ball is put into play, and additionally to return the ball to the hurler. A lane attendant is also responsible for grooming the ice between games in order to ensure a uniform surface free of shavings or impediments. Since the game is often played in inhospitable conditions, with snow, sleet, and hail not unheard of during day-to-day game play, several layers of winter outerwear, including parkas, gloves, scarves, ushanka, and mukluks would be common for players to attire themselves in while engaging in the sport.

She quickly meets Patrick, who knows another girl at the lodging house but shares the goal, along with his friend Julian, of having sex with as many women as possible. After a first date which ends at Patrick's flat for coffee, Patrick is shocked when Jenny tells him she is a virgin and intends to stay that way until she meets the right man. Jenny is attracted to Patrick, so they get into a volatile relationship as Patrick tries to change Jenny's mind, without giving up his bachelor status.

Miller had directed for TV before, notably Alice in Wonderland and Whistle and I'll Come to You, but this was his first feature. Miller admitted his \\"motives were slightly at fault in accepting the project to begin with. I was thinking that... well, Mike Nichols can make a lot of money, why shouldn't I? I accepted the project probably too eagerly. I think it was probably one of Amis' best novels but there were a lot of things to be said against filming it.\\" Miller says \\"the difficulties began to double\\" during scripting \\"because rather than let the script happen spontaneously, the producer sat in on its manufacture at almost every stage. I'm not saying he didn't work very hard and have the best intentions; it's just that his conception and our conception of the intentions were hopelessly at odds.\\" Miller says the story was \\"old fashioned\\" and that he and writer Melly \\"were forced into making\\" the story \\"even more old fashioned by making it more sentimental. Gradually I found myself boxed in to a very conventional, almost 1950s studio situation and the final cut was beyond my control.\\" Miller admitted \\"perhaps what we were doing was something quite dishonest in trying to steal in a realistic film inside the shell of a commercial enterprise.

Families in dispute who want to apply to a court for a parenting order must first attend family dispute resolution. There are some exceptions to this rule, for example cases involving child abuse and family violence. Family dispute resolution is not currently a pre-application requirement for property matters. Disputes between family members may be addressed by ADR (alternative dispute resolution). Indeed, the Family Court of Australia regards it as the preferred method of resolving disputes. The issues discussed in family dispute resolution can include problems that have arisen during or after separation and the effect these problems have had on the children; how the child's best interests can best be served within the new structure of their family; parenting plans; and property and finances. Family dispute resolution is essentially a structured discussion offered to separating parents and significant others to assist in decision making about parenting and/or property. All discussion that take place during family dispute resolution are confidential, unless either party discloses an intention to harm a person or their property, or child abuse. Family dispute resolution is designed to create the opportunity for parents and significant others to discuss how each can best continue to parent while maintaining a focus on their child's best interests being served. Family dispute resolution practitioners can assist parents to develop parenting plans. They are impartial and do not take sides. However, in discussions involving the welfare of the children, the practitioner may adopt a more advisory role in order to help keep the best interests of the children in focus. Parenting plans A parenting plan is a voluntary agreement that covers the day-to-day responsibilities of each parent, the practical considerations of a child's daily life, as well as how parents consult and agree on important issues about their children. A parenting plan can be changed at any time as long as both parents agree. With the assistance of a family dispute resolution practitioner, parents are encouraged to isolate the issues in the dispute; develop and consider options to resolve those issues; if appropriate, attempt to agree to one or more of those options; and if a child is affected, attempt to agree to options that are in the best interests of the children. Agreements reached in Family Dispute Resolution form the basis for a parenting plan. A well constructed parenting plan is designed to assist parents to be good managers of their children's wellbeing. When parents are good managers of their children's wellbeing it assists children to cope with the changes in their family structure. Agreements reached in Family Dispute Resolution are not legally binding however; an existing consent order can be changed if both parents agree to a new arrangement. Section 60I certificates Under the Family Law Act any person attending Family Dispute Resolution to discuss parenting concerns will be issued with a section 60I Certificate that reflects their engagement with the Family Dispute Resolution process. Under the Family Law Act, a section 60I Certificate is required prior to making an application to the court for a parenting order. Not all cases are suitable for Family Dispute Resolution. If a case is deemed unsuitable by the family dispute resolution practitioner, a section 60I Certificate reflecting this decision will be issued. If the other party does not wish to participate in Family Dispute Resolution a section 60I Certificate will be issued to reflect their refusal. Child Support Agency (CSA) assessments The Child Support Agency will refer parents in dispute over child support assessments to Family Dispute Resolution. A signed parenting plan or verbal consent from both parties will supply the required information to the CSA for a child support assessment to be made. Property/financial matters Separating couples who want to resolve property and or financial issues may attend Family Dispute Resolution, however for property and financial matters Family Dispute Resolution is not compulsory. Some of the issues discussed in a property discussion can be how property should be divided and emotional connections to household possessions such as pets, collections and personal effects.  Legal advice Family Dispute Resolution Practitioners remain impartial and do not give legal advice. Family lawyers are experts in interpreting the laws that govern parenting orders and the division of property. A family lawyer is an advocate who can assist their client to achieve their best outcome. Counselling Pre- and post-separation counselling can be beneficial while parties process their emotional reaction to separation. Counselling may be suggested by the Family Dispute Resolution Practitioner.

Development The SZD-35 Bekas is a direct development of the SZD-34 Bocian 3, a modernised Bocian with T-tail and refined aerodynamics, design of which had been completed by engineer George Kubala≈Ñca, but further design work led to the SZD-35 Bekas for export to the DDR (the former East Germany), and the abandonment of the SZD-34. To complement the SZD-30 Pirat gliders purchased by the DDR, the design team at SZD developed the SZD-35 Bekas specifically to fill the requirements of the DDR aero-clubs, with all-wood structure. The Bekas was also designed to comply with portions of the British BCAR airworthiness requirements. Two flying prototypes were built (SP-2553 and SP-2557) and a third for static testing. Flight tests commenced on 29 November 1970, flown by Adam Zientek. The second prototype first flew in March 1971 culminating in a destructive test of the undercarriage with the aircraft undergoing progressively harsh landings until damage occurred. Modifications to the structure were introduced after these tests to increase strength and reduce weight. The Bekas had safe handling and high spin resistance, but suffered from high cockpit sills, which hampered boarding and limited headroom due to the low canopy. To comply with the DDR requirements the structure of the Bekas was primarily of wood with plywood skinning except for a small percentage of the wing surface. The undercarriage consisted of a sprung monowheel, set well forward of the centre of gravity, and tail-skid, which improved stability on the ground roll during winch launching but raised the cockpit sill hampering boarding the aircraft. The DDR cancelled their order and production was cancelled. The two Bekas prototypes have survived, with one in the Aeroclub Gliwice museum and the other at the Rzesz√≥w Aeroclub.

Coman is the patron saint of St. Coman's Church, Kinvara, County Galway, Ireland. The church is situated on a hillock within the town but has been abandoned since the late 19th century and is severely neglected. Little is known of Coman. He appears to belong to the early historic era of Ireland; the Annals of the Four Masters noted the death of Ailbhe of Ceann Mhara in the year 814, so the presumption is that a church was already built, and dedicated, by the early 9th century. The Voyage of the U√≠ Chorra, dated to about the 11th century, describes the destruction of the church of the holy old man Coman of Kinvara. It has been suggested that Coman should be identified with Colman MacDuagh or Caimin of Inis Cealtra. Both were related to Guaire Aidne mac Colm√°in whose fort of Dunguaire Castle is located some hundreds of yards away. Other proposed identifications are that of Coman mac Faolchu (founder of Roscommon) or a Coman mac Domangin/Domaighin listed in the Martyrology of Tallaght and the Martyrology of Donegal. The present church dates to ca. 1200, and was extensively rebuilt at one point during the late 15th-early 16th centuries. Burials in the graveyard continued into the early 20th century, and there are dozens of gravestones within and without the church. It was the subject of a four-season archaeological work from 2004 to 2007.

Although Turkey has not recognized Abkhazia's independence and regards it as de jure part of Georgia, the two governments reportedly have secret ties.  Overview  In 1994, Abkhazia established the post of plenipotentiary representative of the Republic of Abkhazia in the Turkish Republic. The Turkish government did not recognize this representative. On 22 September 1996, Turkey announced that residents of Abkhazia would no longer be allowed to travel to Turkey on Soviet-era identification documents, and would instead have to obtain Georgian passports. In July, 2009, Abkhazian Foreign Minister Sergei Shamba said that the Abkhazian government has certain contacts with the government of Turkey; negotiations on resumption of air and sea communication are being held. Officially, the Turkish government did not want to antagonize its neighbor and important trading partner Georgia. That's why Turkey allegedly maintained a strict trade embargo on Abkhazia. In 2009, several Turkish ships heading to Abkhazia have been seized by Georgian naval forces in international waters due to the Georgian sea blockade of Abkhazia. In September 2009, the Foreign Ministry Deputy Undersecretary √únal √áevik√∂z went to the Abkhaz capital of Sukhum, where he met with Abkhaz officials. This was the first visit to Abkhazia of a foreign national diplomat since the August 2008 war.

Locke, 529 U.S. 89 (2000), was a United States Supreme Court case in which the Court unanimously held that certain state regulations regarding oil tankers and oil barges are preempted under the Supremacy Clause of the United States Constitution in deference to the extensive body of federal regulations affecting these classes of vessels.  Background  The 1989 Exxon Valdez oil spill severely affected the environment of Prince William Sound, Alaska, United States. In the wake of that spill, the state of Washington passed a law authorizing the state Office of Marine Safety to regulate certain aspects of tanker and oil barge operations when calling on Washington state ports. Specifically, the Office of Marine Safety adopted regulations requiring tank vessel operators to submit an oil spill prevention plan for state review and approval. The United States Department of Justice led by Attorney General, Janet Reno filed suit against Washington for adopting rules in an area of law in which the United States Coast Guard had long occupied the field of regulatory activity. The basis of the suit was that the Supremacy Clause of the United States Constitution prohibited states from enacting legislation and rules in fields where the United States Congress intended the Coast Guard to have complete authority, particularly when such regulation could affect interstate and international commerce.  Opinion of the Court  The case reached the Supreme Court of the United States on December 7, 1999. The court unanimously held that Congress intended the United States Coast Guard to be the sole national authority regarding the design, construction, maintenance and certain operational requirements of tank vessels.. Following the decision, Washington State withdrew the offending regulations.  Subsequent developments  This unanimous decision upheld and expanded previous case law, including Gibbons v. Ogden and Ray v. Atlantic Richfield regarding the federal government's strong role and preemptive powers in regulating interstate commerce. The court found that the states cannot pass laws that interfere with the federal government's authority over interstate commerce when a federal agency is granted exclusive jurisdiction by the United States Congress. The Supremacy Clause of the United States Constitution provides that \\"this Constitution, and the Laws of the United States which shall be made in Pursuance thereof; and all Treaties made, or which shall be made, under the Authority of the United States, shall be the supreme Law of the Land.\\" The Commerce Clause in Article I Section 8 of the United States Constitution provides that \\"Congress shall have Power...to regulate Commerce with foreign Nations, and among the several States, and with the Indian Tribes.\\" The previous decisions set the basis for the government to use these enumerated powers as \\"...necessary and proper...\\" also stated in the Constitution. These federal powers are likely to remain in tension with the powers of the states as articulated in the 10th amendment to the United States Constitution as adopted in the Bill of Rights. The Tenth Amendment provides that, \\"The powers not delegated to the United States by the Constitution, nor prohibited by it to the States, are reserved to the States respectively, or to the people.\\" The Court held that \\"Washington's regulations regarding general navigation watch procedures, crew English language skills and training, and maritime casualty reporting are pre-empted by the comprehensive federal regulatory scheme governing oil tankers; the case is remanded so the validity of other Washington regulations may be assessed in light of the considerable federal interest at stake.\\"Locke, 529 U.S. at 94. The state of Washington did not pursue the remand back to the 9th Circuit Court of Appeals, but withdrew all of its regulations related to tank vessel oil spill prevention plans.

She is best known for being the first woman in British history to receive a PhD in nuclear physics. Additionally, she is remembered for her pioneering research in cancer and for her attempts in the discovery of an elusive element, Element 85.  Professional life  At the age of 25 in 1932, Prebil began working at the Radium Institute in Paris under the tutelage of Marie Curie. Three years later, in 1935, at the age of 28, she would become the first woman in Great Britain to receive a PhD in nuclear physics. It is accepted that Leigh-Smith defended her thesis in London, however it is currently unknown from what university she was granted her degree. Dr. Alice Leigh-Smith was also involved in the use of radioactive substances as a treatment for cancer. From 1936, she conducted cancer research as part of the British Empire cancer campaign. From 1938 to 1940, during the Second World War, Alice Leigh-Smith was at the University of Bern in Switzerland, where she continued her work. In January 1943, the anticipation of results from her study regarding the treatment of cancer with radioactive substances was published in the London Times. However, no results are available for current analysis. In 1942, Leigh-Smith and a Swiss chemist, Walter Minder jointly announced the discovery of element 85 (now called astatine) in 1942. They proposed the name anglohelvetium for the new element, in order to honor both of their home countries- \\"anglo\\" for Leigh-Smith's England and \\"Helvetia\\" after the personification of Minder's country- Switzerland. This was Minder's second attempt at discovering the element. It was later proven that Walter Minder and Alice Leigh-Smith had not discovered element 85, after the failure of their results to be replicable.  Personal life  In 1933, at the age of 26, she married Philip Leigh-Smith, a British diplomat and son of the Arctic explorer Benjamin Leigh-Smith. His published comedy, \\"Ladies in Diplomacy\\" is purportedly based on the adventures of his wife, Alice. Alice Leigh-Smith, had one child by her husband Philip Leigh-Smith. Christopher Leigh-Smith was Alice's only child and is alive today, acting as an entrepreneur based in Switzerland.  Legacy  Currently, a portion of Alice Leigh-Smith's private archives are in the possession of the Curie Institute for the Curie Museum. The records are accessible by appointment only.

Ringdal was not among those sent to Germany because he managed to escape. On 4 April 1945 a German crackdown against Operation Derby took place.

It was released for Amiga and MS-DOS. The player controls teenage boy Mark Hopper, who wants to be a secret agent. It was the first game to be released on CD-ROM in Poland. Plot Gold is disappearing around Poland. The police agency wants to hire a random person to uncover the reason behind this disappearance - they choose teenage boy Mark Hopper. Gameplay The game has three sections: \\"The Three Tasks\\", where Mark must prove himself by performing three tasks for the captain of the guards; \\"The Village\\", where Mark must wander around a village and gain entry to the mansion owned by the villain causing the gold's disappearance; and \\"The Mansion\\", where Mark must put a stop to the villain's plans. Development Metropolis Software's contemporaries had begun making games for 8-bit computers, which freed up the market for the company to pursue PC game development without competition. The development team planned for Teenagent to follow in the footsteps of Tajemnica Statuetkis success, being competitive not only in Poland but internationally. To avoid half-measures being taken, graphic designers, animators and testers were hired. The character Mark Hopper was played by developer Adrian Chmielarz's younger brother. Game story was inspired by American action comedy film If Looks Could Kill (1991). Release When the game was originally released, \\"The Three Tasks\\" was shareware, and the remaining two sections could be obtained by registering the game. However, the game was later released as freeware. Teenagent was later released on Good Old Games as the milestone 100th game on the site. It is one of thirteen free games available on the site. Reception Teenagent won a Silver Award from U.K. magazine PC Format. The game's marketing slogan was: \\"The creators of Tajemnica Statuetki have been silent for over a year. See for yourself why\\". InnPoland attributes this marketing campaign, which attached its predecessor's quality stamp on the title, to Teenagent becoming a \\"breakthrough\\", while PB.pl thought this slogan \\"grabbed\\" the public.

By average discharge, the Clearwater River is the largest tributary of the Snake River. The River got its name for the Niimiipuut√≠mt naming as Koos-Koos-Kai-Kai - \\"clear water\\". The drainage basin of the Clearwater River is . Its mean annual discharge is , Northwest Power and Conservation Council Course At the small town of Kooskia, the Middle Fork and South Fork of the Clearwater River join their waters to form the main stem of the Clearwater. The larger Middle Fork is made up of the combined flows of the Lochsa and Selway rivers which flow from the Bitterroot Mountains located to the east, while the much smaller South Fork originates in the Selway-Bitterroot Wilderness to the south. From the confluence the Clearwater flows northwest, passing the Heart of the Monster site of the Nez Perce National Historical Park. U.S. Route 12 follows the river to Kamiah, where it is joined by Lawyer Creek from the southwest. The river then continues northwest through a canyon to the confluence with Lolo Creek from the east. It soon passes the town of Greer and receives Jim Ford Creek from the east. At Orofino, the river gains the waters of Orofino Creek and swings westward in a nearly straight line for about , then receives the North Fork from the northeast at Ahsahka, close to Dworshak Reservoir. After the North Fork contributes its flow, the Clearwater continues west and receives Big Canyon Creek from the south, and Bedrock Creek from the north. As the river canyon cuts deeper into the Columbia Plateau, the Clearwater passes the unincorporated communities of Lenore and Myrtle, where it receives Cottonwood Creek from the southeast, and Arrow, where it receives the Potlatch River from the north. Lapwai Creek joins from the south where the river passes close to Spalding. Here, U.S. Route 95 crosses the Clearwater and is co-signed with U.S. Route 12 along the river's north bank for several miles (then diverts north to Moscow). The river soon widens and slows into the slack water of Lower Granite Lake as it approaches Lewiston. Just as it crosses the Idaho- Washington state line, it joins its waters with the Snake River. Tributaries The Clearwater breaks into several separate forks: * Clearwater River (west of Orofino to Lewiston-Snake River) ** Potlatch River (Latah, Clearwater and Nez Perce Counties) ** North Fork Clearwater River (stream, Clearwater County - ; headwaters near Illinois Peak to just west of Orofino) *** Little North Fork Clearwater River (stream, Shoshone & Clearwater Counties; headwaters in south-central Shoshone County, joins the North Fork in the Dworshak Reservoir) ** Middle Fork Clearwater River (stream, Idaho County - ; formed by the confluence of the Selway and Lochsa at Lowell) ** South Fork Clearwater River (stream, Idaho County - ; headwaters near Red River Hot Springs to Kooskia, confluence with the Middle Fork) *** Little Clearwater River (stream, Idaho County - ; near Three Prong Mountain to near Spot Mountain) Clearwater River near Orofino, ID River modifications The Dworshak Reservoir is the only major lake on the Clearwater system, created from the Dworshak Dam, completed in the early 1970s. Dworshak Dam is on the North Fork of the Clearwater River, and is just northwest of Orofino. There is no fish ladder; the dam blocks salmon and steelhead passage.

According to the American Psychiatric Association Task Force on Appropriate Therapeutic Responses to Sexual Orientation, \\"there are no studies of adequate scientific rigor to conclude whether or not such methods work to change sexual orientation.

Donaldson Adoption Institute; Kids First; and Community Counseling Center, In Support of Appellants (October 12, 2006) There is a large body of research evidence that indicates that being gay, lesbian or bisexual is compatible with normal mental health and social adjustment. Because of this, the major mental health professional organizations do not encourage individuals to try to change their sexual orientation. Indeed, such interventions are ethically suspect because they can be harmful to the psychological well-being of those who attempt them; clinical observations and self-reports indicate that many individuals who unsuccessfully attempt to change their sexual orientation experience considerable psychological distress. For these reasons, no major mental health professional organization has sanctioned efforts to change sexual orientation and virtually all of them have adopted policy statements cautioning the profession and the public about treatments that purport to change sexual orientation.Expert affidavit of Gregory M. Herek, Ph.D. , United States District Court for the State of Massachusetts.Royal College of Psychiatrists: Statement from the Royal College of Psychiatrists‚Äô Gay and Lesbian Mental Health Special Interest GroupAustralian Psychological Society: Sexual orientation and homosexuality The Royal College of Psychiatrists shares the concern of both the American Psychiatric Association and the American Psychological Association that positions espoused by bodies like the National Association for Research & Therapy of Homosexuality (NARTH) in the United States are not supported by science and that so-called treatments of homosexuality as recommended by NARTH create a setting in which prejudice and discrimination can flourish. SOCE have been controversial due to tensions between the values held by some right-wing faith-based organizations, on the one hand, and those held by LGBT rights organizations, human rights and civil rights organizations, and other faith-based organizations, as well as professional and scientific organizations, on the other. Some individuals and groups have, contrary to global scientific research and consensus, promoted the idea of homosexuality as symptomatic of developmental defects or spiritual and moral failings and have argued that SOCE, including psychotherapy and religious efforts, could alter homosexual feelings and behaviors. Such efforts are potentially harmful because they present the view that the sexual orientation of lesbian, gay, and bisexual youth is a mental illness or disorder, and they often frame the inability to change one's sexual orientation as a personal and moral failure.American Psychological Association: Just the Facts about Sexual Orientation & Youth: A Primer for Principals, Educators, & School Personnel Many of these individuals and groups appeared to be embedded within the larger context of conservative religious political movements that have supported the stigmatization of homosexuality on political or religious grounds. History Medical attempts to change homosexuality included surgical treatments such as hysterectomy, ovariectomy, clitoridectomy, castration, vasectomy, pudic nerve surgery, and lobotomy. Substance-based methods included hormone treatment, pharmacologic shock treatment, and treatment with sexual stimulants and sexual depressants. Other methods included aversion therapy, the reduction of aversion to heterosexuality, electroshock treatment, group therapy, hypnosis, and psychoanalysis. Richard von Krafft-Ebing Richard von Krafft-Ebing was a German-Austrian psychiatrist and one of the founders of scientific sexology. His first systematic work on sexual pathology was published in 1877 in a German psychiatric journal. His influential work, Psychopathia Sexualis was published in 1886. Numerous expanded German editions followed, and it was widely translated. Krafft-Ebing became a proponent of the sickness model of homosexuality. Section IV of Psychopathia Sexualis, ‚ÄúGeneral Pathology‚Äú, discussed homosexuality in ‚ÄúDiagnosis, Prognosis and Therapy of Antipathic Sexual Instinct.‚Äù Krafft-Ebing believed that homosexuality could be either innate or acquired. In his view, it could sometimes be treated through prevention of masturbation and cure of the neuroses ‚Äúarising out of the unhygienic conditions of sexual life‚Äù, but these methods would work only in rare cases ‚Äúwhere acquired antipathic sexual instinct has not progressed far‚Äù, and would therefore usually be ineffective even when homosexuality was not inborn. Krafft-Ebing believed that hypnosis was therefore the \\"only means of salvation\\" in most cases. He stated that he knew of only a single case in which self-hypnosis had proven successful, and that hypnotic suggestion by another person was usually necessary to change homosexuality. Krafft-Ebing wrote about this method that \\"... the object of post-hypnotic suggestion is to remove the impulse to masturbation and homosexual feelings, and to encourage heterosexual emotions with a sense of virility\\". Krafft-Ebing described three cases in which he believed it had proved satisfactory, writing that they \\"seem to afford a proof that even the gravest cases of congenital sexual inversion may be benefited by the application of hypnotism\\". He warned however that \\"only when hypnotism produces deep somnambulism decided and lasting results may be hoped for\\". He rejected castration as a cure for homosexuality, and the internment of gay people in asylums, except in cases involving sex crimes. Krafft-Ebing cautioned that the success or failure of treatments for homosexuality proved nothing about its causes. He defended the right of patients to receive such treatment. Krafft-Ebing criticised several objections to medical treatment of homosexuality, including the charges that it was ineffective and that it gave an opportunity \\"to tainted individuals to propagate their perversions\\". In his view, physicians had a duty to provide such treatment if it was requested. He concluded his discussion of methods of curing homosexuality by remarking that ‚Äúin the majority of cases, the patient is quite satisfied when he becomes sexually neutral, and under these circumstances medical skill has rendered a great service to both society and the individual himself.‚Äù Later editions of Psychopathia Sexualis included an increased number of autobiographies by gay people who made it clear that they did not wish to change their sexual orientation. Current status In the last two decades of the 19th century, a different view began to predominate in medical and psychiatric circles, judging such behavior as indicative of a type of person with a defined and relatively stable sexual orientation. In the late 19th and 20th centuries, pathological models of homosexuality were standard. In 1992, the World Health Organization replaced its categorization of homosexuality as a mental illness with the diagnosis of ego-dystonic homosexuality. The UK Government followed suit in 1994, followed by the Ministry of Health in Russian Federation in 1999 and the Chinese Society of Psychiatry in 2001. The trustees of the American Psychiatric Association (APA) had previously voted unanimously (13 to 0, with two abstentions) to remove homosexuality as a disorder from the Sexual Deviancy section of the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, the DSM-II in 1973. This decision was officially confirmed by 58% of the general APA membership in 1974, who voted to replace the diagnosis with a milder category of \\"sexual orientation disturbance\\". At that time APA stressed that removing homosexuality from the list of psychiatric disorders does not mean it is \\"normal\\" or as valuable as heterosexuality. They also stated that modern methods of treatment allow interested homosexuals to change their sexual orientation with a significant degree of success. In 1980 the DSM-III replaced \\"sexual orientation disturbance\\" with \\"ego-dystonic homosexuality\\" which, in 1986, was deleted from the DSM-III-R. The APA now classifies persistent and marked distress about one's sexual orientation under Sexual Disorders Not Otherwise Specified. No major mental health professional organization has sanctioned efforts to change sexual orientation and virtually all of them have adopted policy statements cautioning the profession and the public about treatments that purport to change sexual orientation. These include the American Psychiatric Association, American Psychological Association, American Counseling Association, National Association of Social Workers in the US, the Royal College of Psychiatrists, Australian Psychological Society, and the Pan American Health Organization. Reasons why people seek to change sexual orientation Christian right political groups have marketed sexual orientation change directly to consumers. In 1998, these groups, including the Family Research Council and the American Family Association spent $600,000 on advertising promoting conversion therapy. A majority of people who attempt to change their sexual orientation come from conservative religious backgrounds.Nicolosi, Byrd, & Potts, 2000; Schaeffer, Hyde, Kroencke, McCormick, & Nottebaum, 2000; Schaeffer, Nottebaum, Dech, & Drawczyk, 2000; Spitzer, 2001a). Respondents indicated their desire came from moral or social values, which may be independent of their religion. Many people also say they wish to remain faithful to a spouse, or wish to enter into an opposite-sex marriage. Many people may seek to change their sexual orientation as a way to avoid behaviors which they perceive as being associated with homosexuality, such as non-monogamy. As anal sex carries a higher risk of HIV-infection and some other sexually transmitted infections than vaginal sex, some men seek to change their sexual orientation to lower their chances of contracting a sexually transmitted infection. An article in the American Medical Association's Journal of Ethics argues that clinicians who care for adolescents face a \\"common challenge\\" of parents seeking interventions to change the sexual orientation of their teenage children. The article states that adolescents are increasingly comfortable in revealing their same-sex attraction to their parents because of the \\"generational shift in views of sexual orientation\\" due in part to increasing acceptance of LGBT rights and same-sex marriage. An APA task force found that people often sought out SOCE due to (a) a lack of other sources of social support; (b) a desire for active coping and (c) access to methods of sexual orientation identity exploration and reconstruction. The American Psychological Association states that harassment and abuse, as well as pressure from family, peers, and religious groups ignorant about and prejudiced against homosexuality, may cause high levels of emotional stress for LGB people. These pressures may lead people to feel forced into attempting to change their sexual orientation. Other researchers have found that social pressure plays a key role in a person's desire to change his or her sexuality.Beckstead, A. Gay is not me: Seeking Congruence Through Sexual Reorientation Therapy. (Unpublished master's thesis, University of Utah, 1999). Methods Behavior therapy Types of behavior therapy used to change sexual orientation include aversion therapy, covert sensitization and systematic desensitization. Aversion therapy associates negative stimuli with homoerotic pictures and positive stimuli with heteroerotic pictures. A series of 1966 experiments appeared promising, and the practice became popular, but when reports were shown to be flawed, it fell out of favour.Seligman, p. 156 Since 1994, the American Psychological Association has declared that aversion therapy is a dangerous practice that does not work, but it is still in use in some countries. Bioenergetics Bioenergetics is a therapeutic technique developed by Alexander Lowen and John Pierrakos, who were students of Wilhelm Reich. It has been used to attempt to convert gay people to heterosexuality by Richard Cohen, who has been called one of America's leading practitioners of conversion therapy.Transcript of \\"USA - Gay Conversion , ABC TV Foreign Correspondent, 08-22-2006. Retrieved 04-07-2007. Cohen holds male patients in his lap with the patient curled into the fetal position, and also advocates methods involving shouting or slamming a pillow with a tennis racket. Conversion therapy The American Psychological Association defines conversion therapy or reparative therapy as therapy aimed at changing sexual orientation. The American Psychiatric Association states that conversion therapy or reparative therapy is a type of psychiatric treatment \\"based upon the assumption that homosexuality per se is a mental disorder or based upon the a priori assumption that a patient should change his/her sexual homosexual orientation.\\" Conversion therapy comprises efforts by mental health professionals to convert lesbians and gay men to heterosexuality, and that techniques include psychoanalysis, group therapy, reparative therapy, and involvement in ex-gay ministries such as Exodus International. Aversive conditioning involving electric shock or nausea- inducing drugs was practiced before 1973, as was sex therapy, though there are some reports of aversive treatments through unlicensed practice as late as the 1990s. The ethics guidelines of major U.S. mental health organizations vary from cautionary statements about the safety, effectiveness, and dangers of prejudice associated with conversion therapy (American Psychological Association) to recommending that ethical practitioners refrain from using conversion therapy (American Psychiatric Association) or referring patients to others who do (American Counseling Association). It may be harmful if the client is egosyntonic and does not wish to change their sexual orientation. Ex-gay groups A task force commissioned by the APA found that ex-gay groups act like support groups, in that they help counteract and buffer Minority Stress, marginalization, and isolation. Most ex-gay groups focus on abstaining from homosexual relationships rather than a complete sexual orientation change from homosexual to heterosexual.PATH : Positive Alternatives To Homosexuality Evergreen International taught that it is unlikely therapy can erase all homosexual feelings, and does not advocate any particular form of therapy. Marriage therapy People with a sexual relationship disorder have difficulty forming or maintaining a relationship because of their sexual orientation. A significant number of men and women experience conflict surrounding homosexual expression within a mixed- orientation marriage. People may turn to a marriage therapist for help to change their sexual orientation. Although a strong homosexual identity was associated with difficulties in marital satisfaction, viewing the same-sex activities as compulsive facilitated commitment to the marriage and to monogamy. Religious methods Some people with unwanted homosexual attractions turn to their faith for help. Some conservative Christians believe that homosexuality is a result of a broken world and that faith can change sexual orientation. Some report that their sexual orientation has been changed through the atonement of Jesus Christ. Syntonic therapy Syntonic therapy, a method developed by Robert Kronemeyer, was based partly on the work of Wilhelm Reich. Kronemeyer rejected some earlier methods that were used in attempts to change homosexuality, including lobotomy, electroshock treatment, and Aesthetic Realism. Nazi experiments During the Holocaust, an estimated 5,000 to 15,000 gay men were imprisoned in concentration camps on the grounds that male homosexuality was deemed incompatible with Nazism. Some imprisoned homosexuals faced human experimentation by Nazi doctors who sought to find a \\"medical cure\\" for homosexuality. No scientific knowledge has been yielded from these experiments. At Buchenwald, Nazi doctor Carl V√¶rnet conducted hormonal experiments on twelve gay men. He made incisions in their groin and implanted a metal tube that released testosterone over a prolonged period, as he believed that a lack of testosterone was the cause of homosexuality. Although some of the men claimed to have become heterosexual, the results are largely unreliable as many are assumed to have stated they were \\"cured\\" in order to be released from the camp. Those who did not show improvement were determined to be \\"chronic\\" or \\"incurable\\" homosexuals. Effects of SOCE The American Psychological Association appointed the Task Force on Appropriate Therapeutic Responses to Sexual Orientation to review the available research. Ex-gay organizations expressed concerns about the lack of representation of pro-reparative-therapy perspectives on the task force, while alleging that anti-reparative-therapy perspectives were amply represented. The task force reached the following findings: > Recent studies of participants in Sexual Orientation Change Efforts (SOCE) > identify a population of individuals who experience serious distress related > to same sex sexual attractions. Most of these participants are Caucasian > males who report that their religion is extremely important to them > (Beckstead & Morrow, 2004; Nicolosi, Byrd, & Potts, 2000; Schaeffer, Hyde, > Kroencke, McCormick, & Nottebaum, 2000; Shidlo & Schroeder, 2002, Spitzer, > 2003). These individuals report having pursued a variety of religious and > secular efforts intended to help them to change their sexual orientation. To > date, the research has not fully addressed age, gender, gender identity, > race, ethnicity, culture, national origin, disability, language, and > socioeconomic status in the population of distressed individuals.

Position of professional organizations on SOCE The World Health Organization's ICD-10, which is widely used internationally outside of North America (where DSM-IV-TR is used), states that \\"sexual orientation by itself is not to be regarded as a disorder\\". It lists ego-dystonic sexual orientation as a disorder instead, the diagnosis for which is when \\"the gender identity or sexual preference (heterosexual, homosexual, bisexual, or prepubertal) is not in doubt, but the individual wishes it were different because of associated psychological and behavioural disorders, and may seek treatment in order to change it.\\" However, the Working Group preparing the ICD-11 (due for publication in 2018) has reported, in relation to this and other sexual orientation-related disorders classified in section F66, that there is \\"no evidence that [these classifications] are clinically useful\\" and recommended that section F66 be deleted. In 2012, the Pan American Health Organization (the North and South American branch of the World Health Organization) released a statement cautioning against \\"services that purport to 'cure' people with non-heterosexual sexual orientations\\" as they \\"lack medical justification and represent a serious threat to the health and well-being of affected people\\", and noted that \\"there is a professional consensus that homosexuality is a normal and natural variation of human sexuality and cannot be regarded as a pathological condition\\". The organization further called \\"on governments, academic institutions, professional associations and the media to expose these practices and to promote respect for diversity.\\" They further noted that adolescents have sometimes been forced to attend these therapies involuntarily, being deprived of their liberty and sometimes kept in isolation for several months, and that these findings were reported by several United Nations bodies. Additionally, the organization recommended that such malpractices be denounced and subject to sanctions and penalties under national legislation, as they constitute a violation of the ethical principles of health care and violate human rights that are protected by international and regional agreements. The American Psychiatric Association \\"affirms that same-sex sexual and romantic attractions, feelings, and behaviors are normal and positive variations of human sexuality regardless of sexual orientation identity; reaffirms its position that homosexuality per se is not a mental disorder and opposes portrayals of sexual minority youths and adults as mentally ill due to their sexual orientation; concludes that there is insufficient evidence to support the use of psychological interventions to change sexual orientation; encourages mental health professionals to avoid misrepresenting the efficacy of sexual orientation change efforts by promoting or promising change in sexual orientation when providing assistance to individuals distressed by their own or others‚Äô sexual orientation; concludes that the benefits reported by participants in sexual orientation change efforts can be gained through approaches that do not attempt to change sexual orientation; concludes that the emerging knowledge on affirmative multiculturally competent treatment provides a foundation for an appropriate evidence-based practice with children, adolescents and adults who are distressed by or seek to change their sexual orientation; advises parents, guardians, young people, and their families to avoid sexual orientation change efforts that portray homosexuality as a mental illness or developmental disorder and to seek psychotherapy, social support and educational services that provide accurate information on sexual orientation and sexuality, increase family and school support, and reduce rejection of sexual minority youth; encourages practitioners to consider the ethical concerns outlined in the 1997 APA Resolution on Appropriate Therapeutic Response to Sexual Orientation, in particular the following standards and principles: scientific bases for professional judgments, benefit and harm, justice, and respect for people's rights and dignity; encourages practitioners to be aware that age, gender, gender identity, race, ethnicity, culture, national origin, religion, disability, language, and socioeconomic status may interact with sexual stigma, and contribute to variations in sexual orientation identity development, expression, and experience; opposes the distortion and selective use of scientific data about homosexuality by individuals and organizations seeking to influence public policy and public opinion and will take a leadership role in responding to such distortions; supports the dissemination of accurate scientific and professional information about sexual orientation in order to counteract bias that is based in lack of knowledge about sexual orientation; and encourages advocacy groups, elected officials, mental health professionals, policy makers, religious professionals and organizations, and other organizations to seek areas of collaboration that may promote the wellbeing of sexual minorities.\\" The American Psychiatric Association also states: \\"It is possible to evaluate the theories which rationalize the conduct of \\"reparative\\" and conversion therapies. Firstly, they are at odds with the scientific position of the American Psychiatric Association which has maintained, since 1973, that homosexuality per se, is not a mental disorder. The theories of \\"reparative\\" therapists define homosexuality as either a developmental arrest, a severe form of psychopathology, or some combination of both. In recent years, noted practitioners of \\"reparative\\" therapy have openly integrated older psychoanalytic theories that pathologize homosexuality with traditional religious beliefs condemning homosexuality. The earliest scientific criticisms of the early theories and religious beliefs informing \\"reparative\\" or conversion therapies came primarily from sexology researchers. Later, criticisms emerged from psychoanalytic sources as well. There has also been an increasing body of religious thought arguing against traditional, biblical interpretations that condemn homosexuality and which underlie religious types of \\"reparative\\" therapy.\\"American Psychiatric Association: Therapies Focused on Attempts to Change Sexual Orientation (Reparative or Conversion Therapies) - Position statement Mainstream health organizations critical of attempts to change sexual orientation include the American Medical Association, American Psychiatric Association, the American Psychological Association, the American Counseling Association, the National Association of Social Workers, the American Academy of Pediatrics, the American Association of School Administrators, the American Federation of Teachers, the National Association of School Psychologists, the American Academy of Physician Assistants, and the National Education Association. In the United Kingdom, the Royal College of Psychiatrists states: \\"The Royal College shares the concern of both the American Psychiatric Association and the American Psychological Association that positions espoused by bodies like the National Association for Research and Therapy of Homosexuality (NARTH) in the United States are not supported by science. There is no sound scientific evidence that sexual orientation can be changed. Furthermore so-called treatments of homosexuality as recommended by NARTH create a setting in which prejudice and discrimination can flourish. The Royal College of Psychiatrists holds the view that lesbian, gay and bisexual people should be regarded as valued members of society who have exactly similar rights and responsibilities as all other citizens.\\" In Australia, the Australian Psychological Society states: \\"Even though homosexual orientation is not a mental illness and there is no scientific reason to attempt conversion of lesbians or gays to heterosexual orientation\\" there are people who want to change their own or another person's sexual orientation. According to the APS, \\"the treatments and their outcomes are poorly documented and the length of time that clients are followed up after the treatment is sometimes too short to be a true reflection of the outcome. In other cases it has been shown that individuals can be assisted to live a heterosexual lifestyle, but that their sexual orientation remains unchanged.\\" In addition, conversion therapy can cause harm to the individual. The Royal Australian and New Zealand College of Psychiatrists' position statement on SOCE notes that discrimination on the basis of sexual orientation is prohibited by the College's code of ethics and states that \\"lesbian, gay, and bisexual people are equally valued members of society who have exactly similar rights and responsibilities as all other citizens.\\" The College's official position is that it \\"does not support the use of sexual orientation change efforts of any kind\\" and mandates that \\"[m]ental health workers must avoid misrepresenting the efficacy of sexual orientation change efforts when providing assistance to people distressed by their own or others‚Äô sexual orientation.\\" In China, Western psychiatry and psychology were imported during a \\"Westernization Movement\\" in the late 19th century. At that time, the West viewed homosexuality as a mental disorder, and that became the prevailing view in China as well. During this period, homosexual sexual behavior was grounds for persecution, a marked change from the attitude of general (but not total) acceptance found in pre-19th-century China. These views lasted throughout the 1970s, despite changed theoretical models of sexuality orientation in the West, during a period when the Chinese government held a \\"closed-door\\" policy on information about human sexuality. After 1980, information became more available, and views began to change. In 2000 and under pressure from both the APAs and the ACA, the Chinese Classification of Mental Disorders (CCMD-III) declassified homosexuality, but added a diagnosis resembling ego-dystonic sexual orientation. Attempts to change sexual orientation are rare in China. In India, psychiatry and psychology scholars have \\"preserved an almost complete silence on the subject of homosexuality\\". One paper discusses behavior modification methods used to treat the sexual orientation of thirteen gay patients. They use the WHO classification of egodystonic sexual orientation, but the People's Union for Civil Liberties reports that doctors will often diagnosis the patient as egodystonic even if the patient really is egosyntonic. In Italy, little research has been conducted in the mental health community on homosexuality. Early work tended to describe homosexuality as a pathology or a developmental arrest. More recently, attitudes have begun to change: \\"with a lag of about ten years, Italy has followed ... the attitudes of American mental health professions toward homosexuality\\". In Germany, the psychiatry, psychology, and sexology establishment from the early 20th century viewed homosexuality as pathological. However, following the increased visibility of the homosexual community during the AIDS epidemic of the late 1980s and the declassification of homosexuality as a mental disorder in the ICD-10, non-pathological, rather than pathological, models of homosexuality became mainstream. Japan's psychiatric body removed homosexuality from its list of psychiatric disorders in 1995. In Norway, a country known for its strong LGBT rights legislation, the shift from a pathological to non- pathological understanding of homosexuality began in the 1970s, following the APA's declassification in 1973. In 2000, the General Assembly of the Norwegian Psychiatric Association overwhelmingly voted for the following position statement on sexual orientation change therapy: > Homosexuality is no disorder or illness, and can therefore not be subject to > treatment. A ‚Äòtreatment‚Äô with the only aim of changing sexual orientation > from homosexual to heterosexual must be regarded as ethical malpractice, and > has no place in the health system. Debate Changing sexuality has become highly politicized, and the ensuing debates \\"have obscured the scientific data by calling into question the motives and even the character of individuals on both sides of the issue.\\" The ethics, efficacy, benefits, and potential for harm of SOCE are under extensive debate, both in the professional literature and the popular media. Concerns have been expressed about forcing people to undergo SOCE against their will, about blocking people who are seeking to change their sexual orientation from attempting to do so, and about how the promotion of SOCE affects LGB rights. The American Psychoanalytic Association says psychoanalytic SOCE often causes psychological pain by reinforcing internalized homophobia. The Royal Australian and New Zealand College of Psychiatrists has stated that the harm that SOCE \\"therapies can cause to individuals, the contribution they make to the misrepresentation of homosexuality as a mental disorder, and the prejudice and discrimination that can flourish through the use of such therapies has led all major medical organisations to oppose the use of sexual orientation change efforts\\". Chuck Bright wrote that refusing to endorse a procedure that \\"has been deemed unethical and potentially harmful by most medical and nearly every professional psychotherapy regulating body cannot be justifiably identified as prohibiting client self-determination.\\" Some commentators, recommending a hard stand against the practice, have found therapy inconsistent with a psychologist's ethical duties because \\"it is more ethical to let a client continue to struggle honestly with her or his identity than to collude, even peripherally, with a practice that is discriminatory, oppressive, and ultimately ineffective in its own stated ends.\\" They argue that clients who request it do so out of social pressure and internalized homophobia, pointing to evidence that rates of depression, anxiety, alcohol and drug abuse and suicidal feelings are roughly doubled in those who undergo therapy. Forced SOCE Forced SOCE has occurred in many countries including the United States and continues to be practiced in countries such as China, India, and Japan. Famous cases include Alan Turing. This practice is outlawed in most of the world, but human right groups have complained that in some parts of the world, treatment is still being forced upon unwilling patients. In one of the few published U.S. cases dealing with conversion therapy, the Ninth Circuit addressed the topic in the context of an asylum application. A Russian citizen \\"had been apprehended by the Russian militia, registered at a clinic as a 'suspected lesbian,' and forced to undergo treatment for lesbianism, such as 'sedative drugs' and hypnosis.\\" The Ninth Circuit held that the conversion treatments to which Pitcherskaia had been subjected constituted mental and physical torture. The court rejected the argument that the treatments to which Pitcherskaia had been subjected did not constitute persecution because they had been intended to help her, not harm her, stating that \\"human rights laws cannot be sidestepped by simply couching actions that torture mentally or physically in benevolent terms such as 'curing' or 'treating' the victims.\\" There have been few, if any, medical malpractice lawsuits filed on the basis of conversion therapy. Laura A. Gans suggested in an article published in The Boston University Public Interest Law Journal that this is due to an \\"historic reluctance of consumers of mental health services to sue their caregivers\\" and \\"the difficulty associated with establishing the elements of... causation and harm... given the intangible nature of psychological matters.\\" Gans also suggested that a tort cause of action for intentional infliction of emotional distress might be sustainable against therapists who use conversion therapy on patients who specifically say that his or her anxiety does not arise from his or her sexuality. Another concern is unwilling patients, particularly children, being forced into SOCE. Children experience significant pressure to conform with sexual norms, particularly from their peers, and often lack adequate legal protection from coercive treatment. In 2005, Love In Action, an ex-gay ministry based in Memphis, was investigated by the Tennessee Department of Health and the Tennessee Department of Mental Health and Developmental Disabilities for providing counseling and mental health care without a license, and for treating adolescents without their consent. There have been reports that teenagers have been forcibly treated with conversion therapy on other occasions. Several legal researchers argue that parents who force their children into aggressive conversion therapy programs are committing child abuse under various state statutes. Some advocates of SOCE (such as NARTH) have spoken in favor of a patient's right to reject SOCE and embrace a lesbian, gay or bisexual identity. Richard A. Cohen, an advocate of conversion therapy, has said, \\"If someone wants to live a gay life, that needs to be respected. If someone wants to change and come out straight, that too needs to be respected. Let us practice true tolerance, real diversity, and equality for all.\\" Voluntary SOCE Gregory M. Herek, a professor of psychology at the University of California, Davis, wrote: > Few would dispute that some people‚Äôs sexual orientation changes during their > lifetime. Indeed, many lesbians and gay men report living as a heterosexual > before recognizing or developing their homosexual orientation. The question > at issue is not whether sexual orientation can change but whether > interventions can be designed to bring about such change. Position of SOCE advocates Positive Alternatives to Homosexuality, a coalition of ex-gay groups, supports the right for individuals to pursue a non-homosexual identity if they so choose, the right to know information the coalition provides to make informed decisions, and the right of those conflicted by their homosexual attraction to self-determine their own goals in therapy. They advocate compassion and respect specifically for ex-homosexuals and those on that path, and policy neutrality in creating laws that would inhibit freedom of speech to discuss SOCE. They claim equal access to public forums to state their viewpoint, share their experiences, and to raise awareness of ways to reject a gay identity. Promotion of SOCE The American Psychological Association and the Royal College of Psychiatrists expressed concerns that the positions espoused by NARTH and Focus on the Family are not supported by the science and create an environment in which prejudice and discrimination can flourish. The Just the Facts Coalition, consisting of the American Academy of Pediatrics, American Association of School Administrators, American Counseling Association, American Federation of Teachers, American Psychological Association, American School Counselor Association, American School Health Association, Interfaith Alliance Foundation, National Association of School Psychologists, National Association of Secondary School Principals, National Association of Social Workers, National Education Association, and the School Social Work Association of America, in 2008 released Just the Facts About Sexual Orientation and Youth. In it, they expressed concern that the advancement of SOCE may cause social harm by disseminating inaccurate views about sexual orientation. The National Gay and Lesbian Task Force has described the recent support for sexual orientation change efforts as \\"the Christian Right repackag[ing] its anti-gay campaign in kinder, gentler terms. Instead of simply denouncing homosexuals as morally and socially corrupt, the Christian Right has now shifted to a strategy of emphasizing ... the ex-gay movement. Behind this mask of compassion, however, the goal remains the same: to roll back legal protections for lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender people ...\\" Psychologist John Gonsiorek said the way in which the Christian right promoted SOCE was hypocritical. He wrote \\"some conservative Christian institutions actively foster social conditions to maximize distress for such clients about their sexual orientations, and these institutions simultaneously promote conversion therapy as the solution to this distress.\\" Prominent ex-gay Joe Dallas, while opposing gay sex, called Christians to repent of their hostility toward homosexuals and reach out to them: \\"I find to this day that there is a certain wrath Christians often express towards this sin that they do not express towards other sins ‚Äì both sexual and non-sexual. And that's a problem. It's an imbalance.\\" Legal status Some jurisdictions have made it illegal or are considering making it illegal to engage in sexual orientation change efforts. Australia In 2016, the Government of Victoria announced that it would be legislating to ban all LGBTQI conversion therapy on both adults and minors. The Health Complaints Act received royal assent in May 2016 and came into effect on February 1, 2017. It allows the Health Complaints Commissioner to ban practitioners found to have engaged in conversion therapy but only for actions that occurred after the way came into effect. Victorian Health Minister Jill Hennessy said that the law allows any health professional \\"found to be making false claims and to be acting in a manner that puts people's physical, mental or psychological health, safety or welfare at risk, the Commissioner will be able to ban them from providing such services.\\" The law is the first of its kind in the world in that outlaws conversion therapy for adults and not just for minors. Survivors and commentators questioned whether the law goes far enough, noting many groups are religious in nature and start from the position that homosexuality is a sin. Advocates for a ban on conversion therapy argued that reviews need to go beyond the practices of health professionals and into activities in the unregulated counselling sector. Conversion therapy became an issue during the 2017 postal survey that led to the legalisation of same-sex marriage in Australia. Lyle Shelton, the then-head of the Australian Christian Lobby, declared that parents should have the option to send their children to gay conversion therapy, drawing strong criticism including from other Christian groups. Shelton also criticised the Victorian laws as \\"curtailing choice\\" and argued that parental choice should be respected in deciding what is best for their children. Shortly afterwards, Western Australia and the Australian Capital Territory both decided to examine the adequacy of their laws in relation to conversion therapy. A Fairfax Media investigation in 2018 reported that they found about ten different organisations, including in Victoria, practicing some form of conversion therapy. As the reporter, Farrah Tomazin, put it: \\"across Australia, organisations who believe that LGBTI people can or should change are hard at work. Conversion practices are hidden in evangelical churches and ministries, taking the form of exorcisms, prayer groups or counselling disguised as pastoral care. They‚Äôre also present in some religious schools or practised in the private offices of health professionals. They‚Äôre pushed out through a thriving network of courses and mentors in the borderless world of cyberspace, cloaked in the terminology of 'self improvement' or 'spiritual healing.'\\" Following this report, Victorian Premier Daniel Andrews called on Prime Minister Malcolm Turnbull to support outlawing conversion therapy as part of the national mental health strategy. Federal Health Minister Greg Hunt declared that the issue is one for the states as no Commonwealth funding goes to sexual orientation change efforts ‚Äì though \\"gay conversion ideology has been quietly pushed in schools as part of the federal government's chaplaincy program.\\" The 2016 Victorian law applies only to people offering health services and so does not catch religious groups and charities \\"who say they are helping same-sex attracted people to live in accordance with their faith.\\" Chris, a survivor of conversion therapy joined Andrews in calling for the Federal Government to outlaw conversion therapy, declaring that \\"praying the gay away nearly killed me.\\" He established a change.org petition the day after results of Tomazin's investigation were first published, which attracted more than 12,000 supporters in its first four days. Chris called on Turnbull and Hunt to act to outlaw conversion therapy, declaring: \\"I prayed to God asking him to either heal me, or kill me. I was so depressed, I wanted to die.\\" Brazil Since 1999 Brazil has banned pathologization or attempted treatment of sexual orientation by mental health professionals through the national ethical code (though proper professional register cancelling as a punishment only tends to be upheld in cases involving minors or non-consenting people).Homosexuality is not deviant - Federal Council of Psychologists of Brazil Psychiatrist Jairo Bouer talks about the \\"collateral effects\\" of \\"gay cure\\" bill Attempts by Marco Feliciano, an Evangelical preacher elected as the President of the Commission of Human Rights of the Chamber of Deputies to overturn the judicial institutionalization of same-sex marriage in Brazil as a right to all citizens, as well as support for a bill that would have overturned the ban (what was then known as the \\"gay cure\\" bill) were met with strong public objection in the wave of the 2013 protests in Brazil.The end of the Bill - Gay Cure This debate followed the 2007‚Äì2009 one caused by the Rozangela Justino affair in which an Evangelical Rio de Janeiro-based psychologist that suffered official sanction in the form of \\"public censorship\\" after promising to cure homosexuality compared the LGBT rights/social movements to Nazism and said that its militants are making alliances with the heads of the psychologist association of the country in its attempt to implant a \\"gay dictatorship\\" in the country, what sparked support of or common grounds with several religious and paleoconservative voices in the country (some of which, even saying that the country has 'heterophobic' policies, saying that Brazil lacks actual relevant homophobia, or comparing homosexuality to zoophilia).The 1930s at our door: Gays, spinach and goats of Revista Veja As of 2013, only 50% of Brazilians do not support same-sex marriage being legal and 57% of them support the legality of same-sex couples' right to adoption in the country,Almost half of Brazilian internet users support gay marriage ‚Äì The Christian Post in Portuguese while as of 2008 over 70% supported the expansion of a Constitutional amendment being discussed in the Senate that can explicitly ban all discrimination based on sexual orientation,National Research: Criminalization of prejudice or discrimination against homosexuals, DataSenado (2008) all of which a wide number of the publicly voicing people who were/are in favor of allowing sexual orientation change efforts ‚Äì often under a civil/individual rights discourse ‚Äì had [often strongly] voiced against. Canada Manitoba In May 2015, Manitoba became the first province within Canada to outlaw conversion therapy on LGBT minors. Ontario Ontario was the second province within Canada to outlaw conversion therapy on LGBT minors. The Affirming Sexual Orientation and Gender Identity Act, 2015 was given royal assent, on 4 June 2015, with immediate force, banning the practice. Ecuador In November 2011, an Ecuadorian activist group, called Fundaci√≥n Causana, began a petition on Change.org to entreat the Ecuadorian minister of health to close down more than 200 illegal \\"ex-gay clinics\\". The group claimed that the clinics abuse and torture patients in an effort to \\"cure homosexuality\\". The clinics primarily targeted lesbians and operated under the guise of being drug rehabilitation centers. At least one pair of parents discovered the abuse and asked for the clinic to release their daughter, Paola Ziritti, but were denied. Ziritti was eventually released after two years of confinement and was the first to press a formal complaint against the clinics. Activists consequently called on the government to close down the clinics, but as of August 2011, only 27 had been closed while a reported 207 clinics remained open. On 23 January 2012, the Change.org petition was closed and marked as a success with 113,761 international signatures. The petition also was updated with a statement from Fundacion Causana reading, > After ten years of outcry, the nation of Ecuador - through the Ministry of > Public Health - has entered into a commitment with civic organizations and > society in general to deconstruct the belief that homosexuality is an > illness and root out the use of torture in these clinics. We extend our > thanks to all the men and women who signed our petition. It has been > invaluable to have this support in starting to change this reality. Carina Vance Mafla's ministry of health shortly thereafter raided three clinics in the vicinity of Quito and rescued dozens of women. European Union In March 2018, the European parliament voted in a historic vote by 435 to 109 members of parliament to stop conversion therapies in member states of the European Union. Malta On 16 June 2015, Civil Liberties Minister Helena Dalli announced that the government planned to introduce a bill to ban sexual orientation or gender identity conversion therapy on minors. On 15 December 2015, Dalli presented the bill for its first reading in Parliament. The public consultation of the bill was launched the same day and lasted until 15 January 2016. The bill passed the second reading and the committee stage with amendments in November 2016, by a unanimously held vote. It then moved to a third reading and later signed by the President before going into effect. The MCP (Malta Chamber of Psychologists, the MAP (Maltese Association of Psychiatry), the MACP (Malta Association for the Counselling Profession) and the MAFT & SP (Malta Association of Family Therapy and Systemic Practice) have given their full support to the bill to come into law. The ban on conversion therapy became law on 6 December 2016, with Malta becoming the first in Europe to prohibit it. Switzerland On 13 March 2016, Conservative Democrat MP Rosmarie Quadranti proposed a parliamentary motion which would outlaw conversion therapies on LGBT minors. ¬´L‚ÄôEtat doit tout faire pour interdire ces pratiques¬ª Taiwan On 3 January 2017 certain regulations were introduced to ban conversion therapy on minors. The regulations are yet to be voted on. United Kingdom In 2013, several LGBT organizations and a number of members of Parliament called on the government to ban gay conversion therapy. In 2016, a petition to \\"Make offering Gay Conversion Therapy a criminal offence in the UK\\" was started on the UK Parliament petitions website. When UK Prime Minister Theresa May called the 2017 United Kingdom general election the petition was closed early. It had collected 35,046 signatures of its 100,000 signature target required to take the debate into parliament. In October 2017, a church in Anfield in Liverpool was exposed by a Liverpool Echo investigation for offering to ‚Äòcure‚Äô gay people through a three-day starvation programme. Labour MP Dan Carden raised the issue in Parliament, calling for a legislative ban on conversion therapies, which \\"have no place in 21st Century Britain\\". In July 2018 the UK Government announced that it was \\"consulting on the best way to implement a ban\\" as part of a raft of measures to be implemented to improve the lives of gay and transgender people following a previous Government survey. United States In August 2012, the California State Legislature approved legislation prohibiting mental health providers from engaging in sexual orientation change efforts with minors, which Governor Jerry Brown signed into law on September 29, 2012. It applies to transgender minors, defining \\"sexual orientation change efforts\\" to include \\"efforts to change behaviors or gender expressions\\".https://leginfo.legislature.ca.gov/faces/billNavClient.xhtml?bill_id=201120120SB1172 Bill Text, California Senate Bill No. 1172 Opponents challenged the law in federal court, and on December 21, 2012, in the case of Pickup v. Brown, the Ninth Circuit issued an emergency injunction barring enforcement. On August 29, 2013, the Ninth Circuit upheld the statute. On June 30, 2014, the Supreme Court refused to hear an appeal in the case. In June 2013, the New Jersey Legislature passed legislation signed into law by Governor Chris Christie in August 2013, which makes it illegal to engage in sexual orientation change efforts with minors. The law, meant to apply to transgender minors, defines \\"sexual orientation change efforts\\" to include \\"efforts to change behaviors, gender identity, or gender expressions\\".http://www.njleg.state.nj.us/2012/Bills/A3500/3371_I1.HTM Bill Text, Assembly, No. 3371, State of New Jersey, 215th Legislature In November 2013, a federal judge upheld the law. On June 7, 2014, approximately 8,000 delegates to the Republican Party of Texas State Convention in Fort Worth, Texas, voted to add language to their platform in support of \\"reparative therapy\\":Republican Party of Texas, Report of Permanent Committee on Platform and Resolutions As Amended and Adopted by the 2014 State Convention of theRepublican Party of Texas. On June 25, 2015 a New Jersey jury found the Jewish conversion therapy organization JONAH guilty of consumer fraud for promising to be able to change its clients' sexual urges and determined its commercial practices to be unconscionable. As of May 2020, the states of Rhode Island, Nevada, Connecticut, New Mexico, Vermont, California, New Jersey, Illinois, Oregon,HB2307, Oregon Legislature Washington, Maryland, Hawaii, New Hampshire, Delaware, New York, Massachusetts, Maine, Colorado, Utah, Virginia, as well as the District of Columbia and Puerto Rico have enacted bans on sexual orientation change efforts with minors. In December 2015, Cincinnati, Ohio by a vote of 7‚Äì2, became the first city within the United States to outlaw conversion therapy on LGBT minors. On June 8, 2016, Miami Beach voted to ban conversion therapy. The ban was sponsored by Commissioner John Elizabeth Alem√†n and was unanimously approved by the city commission. Miami Beach thus became the first city in Florida to ban the use of conversion therapy on LGBT minors. On August 1, 2016 the city council of Seattle voted unanimously to ban conversion therapy on minors, making it the third city in the United States to do so. On December 14, 2016 Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania passed a bill by a vote of 9‚Äì0, that bans conversion therapy on minors from January 1, 2017. On December 24, 2016 Lake Worth, Florida bans conversion therapy on minors, by a vote of 6‚Äì0 on December 24, 2016 and went into effect on 1 January 2017. On April 7, 2017, New Mexico became the seventh U.S. state to ban conversion therapy on minors. On May 10, 2017, Connecticut became the eighth U.S. state to ban conversion therapy on minors. On May 17, 2017, Nevada became the ninth U.S. state to ban conversion therapy on minors. The law went into effect on 1 January 2018. On July 22, 2017, Rhode Island became the tenth U.S. state to ban conversion therapy on minors.

In both cases this leads to a separation of charges (such as through a depletion layer). The charges are often separated over a considerable distance (relative to the atomic and molecular sizes), and the contribution to dielectric loss can therefore be orders of magnitude larger than the dielectric response due to molecular fluctuations.Kremer F., & Sch√∂nhals A.

This practice is prevalent in the northeastern part of India, especially in Assam, and is one of the methods seen in ancient India. Other traditional elephant capture methods include: khedda, byle shikar, snaring, pit method, and decoying by using a female koonki to lure a male elephant. Mela shikar used to be organized twice a year - after Durga Puja and during Bihu. The method Mela shikar requires the services of a skillemahout or phandi. This person is able to lasso a wild elephant whilst mounted on another. The phandi, who is well regarded for his abilities, is accompanied by another mahout assistant. Phandis feature in the folklore of northeastern India. Since 1977, this and all other methods of capturing elephants are illegal, but prior to the 1977 legislation, mela shikar was used to lasso an estimated 300 to 400 elephants per year in Assam alone. Three distinct reasons make the mela shikar method a safe one. #It is completely selective. It usually targets carefully studied and selected animals, preferably the younger, more pliable ones. #The death rate is low, since comparatively few elephants are caught at one time with sufficient manpower to take care of the captives. #Mortality during mahoutship and training is low, because all personnel engaged are highly skilled. Gazali shikar Gazali shikar is a variation of mela shikar. Gazali in Assamese means the young shoots of grasses. Elephants are very fond of gazali that sprout up during premonsoon showers in May‚ÄìJune. They are attracted to grassy patches, giving the phandi a good opportunity to capture them. Legal issues Before 1977, elephants were under Schedule-II (Part-I) of the Wildlife Protection Act, which granted elephants the status of \\"special game\\" for which it could be killed, captured or traded commercially under license. In 1977, the elephant was brought under Schedule-I of the Act, which made its capture illegal. This ban led to the gradual extinction of a line of specially trained mahouts or phandis. According to S.S. Bisht, the former director of Project Elephant and senior forest service officer, \\"Under Section 12 of the Forest Protection Act, permission to catch elephants can only be given by the Centre for population control and scientific research. Last time such permission was given to Assam was in the ‚Äô80s\\". Effect of the 1977 legislation on phandis The ban has left many of the phandis jobless and homeless. Prohibited from earning a living with their specialized skills, they had to work odd jobs, such as becoming daily wage earners. The government settled 1000 families in 13 villages near the Assam-Arunachal border. In 2006, the residents were evicted, their houses were bulldozed or burnt down, and some residents were physically assaulted. Since that time, the jungle has reclaimed the villages. Rehabilitation According to Xodou Axom Hati Phando Xonmilon Union, an organization working for the rehabilitation of the jobless phandis, only 37 phandis are given employment by the government since 1972. According to Jayant Narlikar, Deputy Commissioner of Lakhimpur, around 170 families have been provided money and land in the district. Quotations Renowned elephant experts and veteran phandis express their reactions and opinions as follows: *Expert phandi Parbati Barua says, \\"If nothing is done now, the art of mela shikar is sure to die soon because there won‚Äôt be any expert phandi around to teach his art to the new generation. I do not know whether it will be allowed once again. But I do not see any harm if mela shikar is occasionally allowed. That will provide livelihood to hundreds of phandis and keep the man-elephant conflict in control\\". *Renowned elephant expert Dhritikanta Lahiri Choudhury says, \\" The Project Elephant Committee already has a resolution on mela shikar. That is, the technique of mela shikar can be used, but only to scare away wild herds. For reducing the number of elephants, however, tranquilization is a much better and effective option. Mela shikar is a very old technique. We find the oldest instance of this art in the records of Alexander the Great‚Äôs campaigns in the Orient. At that time, even he had captured elephants. It was then considered sport. There‚Äôs a belief mela shikar harms elephants. That‚Äôs not true.\\" *Principal chief conservator of forest (wildlife) Suresh Chand says, \\"From the point of social responsibility, rehabilitation of phandis has to be done. But it‚Äôs a very complex issue. We understand the problems of the phandis, but cannot decide on anything.\\" *Veterinarian and elephant expert Kushal K Sarma says, \\"Why is the issue of rehabilitation coming up? Trapping wild elephants can never be justified. Besides, elephant trapping is a seasonal affair, so how did phandis survive the rest of the year? They used to cultivate land. So, the question of rehabilitation doesn‚Äôt arise at all.\\" Revival of the shikar In 2009, Assam has sought permission from the Centre to revive the mela shikar. The state wants to put the captured and tamed animals on government duty - to carry guards and tourists in wildlife sanctuaries and to transport EVMs and polling officials to remote areas. It also hopes that the move will contain the human- elephant conflict.

William Ellis, who had a reputation for employing the principles of humane treatment, was appointed the first superintendent of the asylum.Smith, Leonard D. (2004) \\"Ellis, Sir William Charles (1780‚Äì1839)\\" in Oxford Dictionary of National Biography. Oxford University Press James Crichton- Browne, who was appointed superintendent at the hospital in 1866, went on to carry out pioneering research on the neuropathology of insanity. After the facility joined the National Health Service in 1948, it became the Stanley Royd Hospital. In a serious incident at the hospital in August 1984, 355 patients and 106 members of staff were affected by salmonella food poisoning; the outbreak led to 19 patient deaths. After the introduction of Care in the Community, the hospital went into a period of decline and eventually closed in 1995. The hospital has since been converted for residential use and is now known as Parklands Manor.

The group have undergone multiple changes in line-up leading up to the release of their debut album, Return to the Past in 2010. Despite being somewhat latecomers to the power metal scene, Seven Thorns' sound draws heavily on the \\"old school of power metal\\" citing influences by bands such as Gamma Ray, Helloween and Stratovarius. History The band was founded in 1998 by drummer Lars Borup. However, the search for other permanent band members was unsuccessful, so Seven Thorns was put on hold in 2000. In 2004 Mik Holm joined Lars as songwriter and lead singer which led to the first complete line-up later that same year. The band's first single Artificial Night was recorded and released in the beginning of 2005 and was nominated for a Danish Metal Award. From 2005 to 2007 Seven Thorns was on hiatus with the exit of Mik and the addition of a new lead singer. The band name was changed to 7thorns, which, despite the name similarity, was only meant as a side project. 7thorns wrote and recorded one album entitled Glow of Dawn but this was never released officially. The \\"original\\" Seven Thorns was revived again in 2007 by Mik and Lars after the 7thorns project had been terminated. Although Mik does not function as an active member as such, he contributes to the songwriting for Seven Thorns. Seven Thorns was ready with new line-up in late 2008 and a single entitled Forest Majesty was recorded over New Year of 2008-09 and released in March 2009 by Airbourne Records, a small Danish label. After the release of the debut album Return to the Past in 2010 through Nightmare Records Seven Thorns signed a promotion contract with the German agency Rock N Growl. The promotion deal resulted in numerous top class reviews by magazines and e-zines from all over the world as well as radio airplay in both Europe, The United States and Japan. In the summer of 2011 Seven Thorns embarked on their first European tour along with Circle II Circle playing multiple shows and festivals. They have since toured with American glammetal act Lillian Axe, also promoting the arrival of their new lead singer, Gustav Blide. Seven Thorns have shared the stage with bands such as Anvil, J√∏rn Lande, Raven, and Gun Barrel. The band's follow-up album, entitled II was released in February 2014 which garnered equal amounts of positive reviews and radio airplay. As the recording of \\"II\\" was still ongoing when Blide joined the line-up the lead vocals were performed by Erik Blomkvist. However, Blide provided the majority of backing vocals for the album. Between mid-2014 and mid-2015 Gustav Blide, Christian Str√∏jer and Nicolaj Marker left the band to attend to other obligations.

The vehicle has a turning radius of 16.5 metres, which makes it very agile and manoeuvrable and therefore suitable for operations in both urban and rural areas. The Maverick is fitted with either a militarised MAN engine and a 12-Speed Semi-Automatic, or with a diesel power plant with a 6-speed fully automatic transmission. The advantage of both engines is that they are common all around the world, which means that the vehicles can be repaired and serviced in most countries. The Maverick may be fitted with a biological and chemical protection filtration system, and has a cruising speed of between 100 and 120 kilometres per hour and a road range of approximately 700 kilometres.

It stands at the head of Glen Finnan approximately north of Loch Shiel. Overview Sg√πrr Thuilm reaches a height of and is classified as a Munro. The mountain also qualifies as a Marilyn with a significant prominence of . It is positioned at the head of Glen Finnan and is invariably climbed along with the neighbouring Munro of Sg√πrr nan Coireachan to which it is joined by a rocky ridge. It lies just outwith the Rough Bounds of Knoydart but shares many of the characteristics of the mountains of that region. The name translates from the Gaelic as Rocky peak of the hillock. Geography Sg√πrr Thuilm is a steep sided, craggy mountain positioned at the eastern end of a winding ridge which also contains the Munro Sg√πrr nan Coireachan and several other less prominent peaks. This ridge encloses Coire Thollaidh, in which the River Finnan has its source.Walking Scotland (Sgurr Thuilm) - Accessed 2009-08-28 The north side of the mountain is craggy with several coires dropping towards Glen Pean. To the south and east is the narrow Gleann Cuirnean which divides Sg√πrr Thuilm from Streap, a neighbouring Corbett. Sg√πrr Thuilm has three distinct ridges: the curved western ridge connects it to Sg√πrr nan Coireachan; the northeastern ridge runs into Glen Peann via a subsidiary top Meall an Fhir-eoin; and the southwestern ridge, named Druim Coire a' Bheithe, drops to Glenfinnan Lodge. Ascents Sg√πrr Thuilm can be climbed from both Glen Finnan to the south, or from the northeast by way of the public road at the west end of Loch Arkaig. The Glen Finnan approach is slightly longer, although it is possible to cycle part way up the glen. From the A830 road on the west side of the River Finnan the ascent route follows Glen Finnan until a stalkers path is picked up which leads onto the south east ridge of Sg√πrr nan Coireachan. From this summit a traverse east along a rough ridge over two smaller summits is completed to reach Sg√πrr Thuilm. The return to Glen Finnan can be achieved by descending south and then southwest down the Druim Coire a' Bheithe.

In the past there was certain controversy because a band named Los Indianos coming from the town of Santa Cruz de La Palma wanted to join the Carnival of Las Palmas.  Gala of the Drag Queen  The Gala of the Drag Queen is an event of the Carnival of Las Palmas de Gran Canaria. It consists of a concert and a television show in which the main event is a pageant of drag queens, enlivened with other performances of singers and dance numbers. The carnivals of Las Palmas de Gran Canaria included this show for the first time in 1998, and with the passage of time, it has become one of the most popular events of the festivities. In the drag queens contest, the artistic talent, the dance, and the interpretation of a musical number are valued. The contest participants act three minutes over the stage of the Santa Catalina Park. Days before the Gala a pre-selection is held in which the best candidates are chosen to perform at the Gala. In the contest rules there is no gender limitation or sexual orientation, although the participants are mostly gay men. The pageant is broadcast by the Spanish national public channel RTVE.

Samuel Simpson Sharpe , M.P. (March 13, 1873 - May 25, 1918) was a lawyer, political figure, and soldier from Ontario, Canada. He represented Ontario North in the House of Commons of Canada from 1909 to 1917 as a Conservative and from 1917 to 1918 as a Unionist Party member. From 1916 until his death, he served as a Member of Parliament while on active duty with the Canadian Expeditionary Force. Along with George Harold Baker, he is one of only two sitting Canadian MPs to die on military service. Early life He was born in Zephyr, Ontario, the son of George Sharpe, a native of England, and Mary Ann Simpson, a native of Ireland. Sharpe was educated in Uxbridge, at the University of Toronto and Osgoode Hall, graduating in 1895. In 1903, he married Mabel E. Crosby, a granddaughter of Joseph Gould. Sharpe practised law in Uxbridge and was town solicitor for 10 years. Prior to the First World War, Sharpe served as a member of the 34th Ontario Regiment, joining at age sixteen and eventually achieving the rank of Major. His brother William Henry Sharpe served in the House of Commons and Senate. Political career Sharpe was elected as the Member of Parliament for Ontario North in the 1908 federal election, representing the Conservative Party. He was re-elected in 1911. After the 1911 election, Prime Minister Robert Borden considered Sharpe for the position of Minister of Militia and Defence, before deciding on Sam Hughes. Sharpe later clashed with Hughes in Parliament over militia policy and the Minister's abrasive personal style. During the 1917 election, Sharpe ran for the Unionist Party. He was elected in absentia, as he was at the time serving overseas with the Canadian Expeditionary Force. First World War On the outbreak of the First World War, Sharpe was initially passed over for a command position and was not part of the First Contingent of the Canadian Expeditionary Force that deployed overseas in 1914. Sharpe considered his past conflict with Minister Hughes as the reason he was overlooked, and expressed concern that this would affect his reputation. In November 1915, Sharpe was authorized by Hughes to raise a battalion from Ontario County. This led to the creation of the 116th Battalion (Ontario County), CEF, with many members drawn from the 34th Regiment and several personally recruited by Sharpe. The Battalion arrived in England in the summer of 1916 and, following training, was deployed to the front in France in February 1917. Sharpe commanded the Battalion in action, beginning with the Battle of Vimy Ridge in April 1917. Subsequent actions included an attack at Avion in preparation for the Battle of Hill 70, and the Battle of Passchendaele. Sharpe began to struggle with the impact of his military service. In October 1917, he wrote to Muriel Hutchison, the widow of Lieutenant Thomas Hutchison. Sharpe had served with Hutchison in the 34th Regiment before the war, and was present when he was injured by a shell blast, administering first aid to him. In his letter to Muriel, Sharpe said: > It is awful to contemplate the misery and suffering in this old world, and > were I to allow myself to ponder over what I have seen and what I have > suffered thro [sic] the loss of the bravest and best in the world, I would > soon become absolutely incapable of 'carrying on'. In December 1917, Sharpe returned to England for a senior officer's course. Early the next year he was awarded the Distinguished Service Order in the 1918 New Year Honours. A short time after receiving the award, he was hospitalized with a diagnosis of \\"general debility\\". In May 1918, Sharpe returned to Canada on convalescent leave. En route back to Uxbridge with his wife, he was hospitalized at Montreal's Royal Victoria Hospital for nervous shock. Death and legacy On May 25, 1918, Sharpe committed suicide, jumping from a hospital window to his death. Due to the stigma surrounding suicide and mental illness, Sharpe's history was largely forgotten in Canada for almost 100 years. In 2014, Member of Parliament Erin O'Toole and Senator Romeo Dallaire inaugurated the Lieutenant Colonel Sam Sharpe Veterans Mental Health breakfast to showcase veterans‚Äô mental health issues and to recognize those \\"who have sought help for their operational stress injuries and are leading productive lives.\\" In 2016, a bronze plaque including the likeness of Sharpe by sculptor Tyler Briley acknowledging Sharpe's service as an MP and soldier was commissioned for installation in the Centre Block of Canada's Parliament. The plaque was unveiled in the foyer of the House of Commons on November 7, 2018.

Distribution Alloteuthis subulata is found in the eastern Atlantic Ocean as far south as North-west Africa, the North Sea, the western Baltic Sea,Herrmann, M. , Gonschior, H. and Piatkowski, U. (2001): Hydrographic changes push European common squid Alloteuthis subulata into Kiel Bay, western Baltic Sea, its easternmost area of distribution , ICES Annual Science Conference, Oslo, Norway, September 26‚Äì29 . and Mediterranean Sea. In British waters, it has a southernly bias to its distribution but has been found as far north as the Solway Firth and the Firth of Clyde. Description Colours of European common squid Alloteuthis subulata has a long, narrow mantle with a long tail which is pointed in adult females and even longer and rather spike-like in adult males. The fins are rhomboid-shaped, with pointed sides, and their rear ends are concave and extend along the tail. The short tentacles are delicate, with small, narrow clubs. Its color is normally pale grey with many brown or purplish spots. Length is up to 21 cm and the maximum mantle length is 14 cm.http://species- identification.org/species.php?species_group=zmns&id;=542 Habitat Alloteuthis subulata is usually associated with the water column above sandy and hard bottoms. Biology The males and females arrive together in inshore waters of the North Sea in early summer. The spawning season is restricted to June and July. Eggs are covered in gel and laid in strings, which are attached to hard objects on the seabed. The eggs hatch after about 2 weeks when the juveniles are 2 mm long. They first appear in plankton samples towards the end of July; after about 15 to 30 days, they switch to a demersal mode of life. In November, when they are 3 months old and about 3 cm in length, they move out of the North Sea, returning the following spring, by which time they will have attained a length of about 5 cm. The life expectancy is between 1 and 2 years. The species feeds on small and juvenile fishes. Fisheries Alloteuthis subulata is normally taken as bycatch in trawl fisheries for other species throughout its range. In the Mediterranean Sea, the species is normally caught between 20 and 120 m depth over sandy-muddy substrates. Squid so caught may be marketed fresh and frozen. There are no separate statistics reported for this species, as catches are probably reported as European squid (Loligo vulgaris).ftp://ftp.fao.org/docrep/fao/009/ac479e/ac479e19.pdf References * Vecchione, M., E.

A Tristimulus colorimeter, colloquially shortened to colorimeter, is used in digital imaging, to profile and calibrate output devices. It takes a limited number of wideband spectral energy readings along the visible spectrum by using filtered photodetectors; e.g. silicon photodiodes. A colorimeter with the known value of absolute error allows measuring (x,y)-chromaticity coordinates in red, green, blue and white colors. Measured values are used for calculation of LCD profile coefficients. Originally, three glass filters whose transmittance spectra mimicked the CIE color matching functions (shown below) were employed. A filter bank may be used to decompose the individual color matching functions if more accuracy is desired. A camera or colorimeter is said to be colorimetric if it satisfies the by (1868‚Äì1945) (also called the \\"Maxwell-Ives criterion\\"), reducing observer metamerism color errors, if the product of the spectral responsivity of the photoreceptor and the spectral transmittance of the filters is a linear combination of the CMFs. A colorimeter or a digital camera with a color filter array can, under certain conditions, be used as an alternative to a spectrophotometer. The illuminant and observer conditions should be specified when citing a measurement (e.g. D65/10¬∞). The quality of a colorimeter may be assessed using the means in CIE publication 179:2007.

They were also singers and, above all, jalis; storytellers and guardians of oral tradition, preserving the history of people and events via their music. Stories and history are passed down from generation to generation by this method within families and groups of friends, ensuring survival of such stories for centuries. The jali sings the praises of his friends and benefactors, warns the politicians of their errors and admonishes the listeners to live right. Their music encapsulates the Mandinka culture. Konte and Kuyateh have taken the kora to a new level, having modified their instruments to expand the kora's range by adding extra bass strings to the classic 21 -string harp-like instrument. Roots World described the interplay of the two musicians as \\"fascinating, as they twist and turn around the melody, fighting against each other and then suddenly forming a unison that shimmers up and down a scale before parting ways again.\\" Their repertoire includes Mamma Manneh, a rolling dance tune from the Wolof tradition and Saliya, one of the oldest songs written for the kora. Since 1987, they have toured worldwide and their albums have been acclaimed as the most accessible from this tradition. In 1998 journalist and World Music proponent Charlie Gillett stated \\"Nothing is ever quite the same after the first time you hear a kora played live in a West African setting. Dembo Konte was the musician who opened my ears, and he made these recordings with Kausu Kuyateh soon afterwards. They still sound powerful and raw, evocative and timeless.\\" Usually performing as a duo, Konte (from The Gambia) and Kuyateh (from Senegal) have also collaborated with British musicians to create a fusion of West African and western musical styles, retaining the kora and their voices as the primary centres of attention. In 1989 they toured the UK and, on 5 September recorded a session for the John Peel show on BBC radio. They also collaborated that year with Hijaz, Houzam, and Sabah Habas from 3 Mustaphas 3. The main feature of the resultant album (Jali Roll) is the duo's vocals and kora, but once John Kirkpatrick's button accordion comes in, it creates a mood which belongs to neither Europe nor Africa. Track 3 is an old song from Mali, but transformed by boogie-type arrangement. This album was chosen by British music magazines Q and Vox for World Music Album of the Year. When re-issued in 2001, a live track from their London show in 1989 was added. On the album Jaliology the duo is joined by Mawdo Suso playing balafon, a traditional rosewood instrument resembling a xylophone.

A star is a figure consisting of any number of opposing pairs of vectors (or arms) issuing from a central origin. A star is eutactic if it is the orthogonal projection of plus and minus the set of standard basis vectors (i.e., the vertices of a cross-polytope) from a higher-dimensional space onto a subspace. Such stars were called \\"eutactic\\" ‚Äì meaning \\"well- situated\\" or \\"well-arranged\\" ‚Äì by because, for a common scalar multiple, their vectors are projections of an orthonormal basis.  Definition  A eutactic star in the plane (n = 2, s = 4) A star is here defined as a set of 2s vectors A = ¬±a1, ..., ¬±as issuing from a particular origin in a Euclidean space of dimension n ‚â§ s. A star is eutactic if the ai are the projections onto n dimensions of a set of mutually perpendicular equal vectors b1, ..., bs issuing from a particular origin in Euclidean s-dimensional space. The configuration of 2s vectors in the s-dimensional space B = ¬±b1, ... , ¬±bs is known as a cross. Given these definitions, a eutactic star is, concisely, a star produced by the orthogonal projection of a cross. An equivalent definition, first mentioned by Schl√§fli, stipulates that a star is eutactic if a constant Œ∂ exists such that :\\\\sum_{k=1}^s(\\\\mathbf{a}_k \\\\cdot \\\\mathbf{v})^2 = \\\\zeta |\\\\mathbf{v}|^2 for every vector v. The existence of such a constant requires that the sum of the squares of the orthogonal projections of A on a line be equal in all directions. In general, :\\\\zeta = \\\\sum_{k=1}^s |\\\\mathbf{a}_k|^2/n. A normalised eutactic star is a projected cross composed of unit vectors. Eutactic stars are often considered in n = 3 dimensions because of their connection with the study of regular polyhedra. Hadwiger's principal theorem Let T be the symmetric linear transformation defined for vectors x by :T\\\\mathbf{x} = \\\\sum_{k=1}^s \\\\mathbf{a}_k (\\\\mathbf{a}_k\\\\cdot\\\\mathbf{x}), where the aj form any collection of s vectors in the n-dimensional Euclidean space. Hadwiger's principal theorem states that the vectors ¬±a1, ..., ¬±as form a eutactic star if and only if there is a constant Œ∂ such that Tx = Œ∂x for every x. The vectors form a normalized eutactic star precisely when T is the identity operator ‚Äì when Œ∂ = 1\\\\. Equivalently, the star is normalized eutactic if and only if the matrix A = [a1 ... as], whose columns are the vectors ak, has orthonormal rows. A proof may be given in one direction by completing the rows of this matrix to an orthonormal basis of \\\\mathbb{R}^s, and in the other by orthogonally projecting onto the n-dimensional subspace spanned by the first n Cartesian coordinate vectors. Hadwiger's theorem implies the equivalence of Schl√§fli's stipulation and the geometrical definition of a eutactic star, by the polarization identity. Furthermore, both Schl√§fli's identity and Hadwiger's theorem give the same value of the constant Œ∂.  Applications  Eutactic stars are useful largely because of their relationship with the geometry of polytopes and groups of orthogonal transformations. Schl√§fli showed early on that the vectors from the center of any regular polytope to its vertices form a eutactic star. Brauer and Coxeter proved the following generalization:. : > A star is eutactic if it is transformed to itself by some irreducible group > of orthogonal transformations that acts transitively on pairs of opposite > vectors. An irreducible group here means a group that does not leave any nontrivial proper subspace invariant (see irreducible representation). Since the set theoretic union of two eutactic stars is itself eutactic (a consequence of Hadwiger's principal theorem), it can be concluded that, in general: : > A star is eutactic if it is transformed to itself by some irreducible group > of orthogonal transformations. Eutactic stars may be used to validate the eutaxy of any form in general. According to H. S. M. Coxeter: \\"A form is eutactic if and only if its minimal vectors are parallel to the vectors of a eutactic star.\\" See also *Eutactic lattice *Tight frame  References  * Category:Polytopes Category:Vectors (mathematics and physics) ","title":"Eutactic star"},{"id":"24141215","text":"Thomas Edward Manley Chew (August 11, 1874 - December 17, 1928) was a lumber merchant and political figure in Ontario, Canada.

Located in the eastern borough of Praga P√≥≈Çnoc, it was built in the 19th century as the westernmost and final terminus of a Russian gauge Warsaw ‚Äì Saint Petersburg Railway. Currently it serves mostly local and suburban trains run by Koleje Mazowieckie. History Saint Petersburg rail terminal in 19th century The Petersburg Train Station () was built in 1863 as the final terminus of a new railroad linking Warsaw with Vilnius and St. Petersburg. The building itself was designed by Narcyz Zborzewski. As the line used Russian gauge while another major railway line operating in Warsaw at the time (namely the Warsaw‚ÄìVienna Railway) used Standard gauge, the two could not have been connected. To allow passengers travelling from Vienna to St. Petersburg easier access to both terminals a horse-drawn tramway line was opened soon after the railway line's completion, thus giving birth to Warsaw's tramway network. The original train station had been blown up by withdrawing Russian troops in 1915 during World War I. After the end of hostilities and the Polish-Bolshevik War parts of the Warsaw‚ÄìSaint Petersburg Railway between Warsaw and Vilna were converted to standard gauge while passenger traffic between Warsaw and then- Soviet Leningrad practically ceased. Because of that the name of the station was changed to the one used currently. The position initially occupied by the 19th century train station which was demolished during the war was occupied by the new office building headquarters of Polish State Railways, constructed between 1927 and 1928. At the same time a new provisional Warszawa Wile≈Ñska station was constructed across the street, slightly to the south from the original location. Warsaw station The new provisional building survived World War II when it was dismantled while old railway depots were converted to a station building. This building was also provisional, but survived in its role until 2000, when a new station was constructed. The ground floor houses a suburban train station operated currently by Koleje Mazowieckie, while upper floors house a shopping mall. The building was completed in 2002. The construction of a Warsaw Metro line 2 station Dworzec Wile≈Ñski was completed in March 2015.

A social movement and pressure group that employs street demonstrations as its main tactic, the EDL presents itself as a single-issue movement opposed to Islamism and Islamic extremism, although its rhetoric and actions target Islam and Muslims more widely. Founded in 2009, its heyday lasted until 2011, after which it entered a decline. Established in London, the EDL coalesced around several football hooligan firms protesting the public presence of the small Salafi Islamist group Ahlus Sunnah wal Jamaah in Luton, Bedfordshire. Tommy Robinson, a former member of the British National Party (BNP), soon became its de facto leader. The organisation grew swiftly, holding demonstrations across England and often clashing with anti-fascist protesters from Unite Against Fascism and other groups, who deemed it a racist organisation victimising British Muslims. The EDL also established a strong social media presence on Facebook and YouTube. Moving towards electoral politics, it established formal links with the far-right British Freedom Party, a breakaway from the BNP. The EDL's reputation was damaged in 2011 after supporters were convicted of plotting to bomb mosques and links were revealed with Norwegian far-right terrorist Anders Behring Breivik. In 2013 Robinson‚Äîsupported by the Quilliam think tank‚Äîleft the group. He claimed it had become too extreme, and established the short-lived rival Pegida UK. EDL membership declined significantly following Robinson's departure and various branches declared independence. Ideologically on the extreme-right or far- right of British politics, the EDL is part of the international counter-jihad movement. Rejecting the idea that Muslims can truly be English, the EDL presents Islam as an intolerant, primitive threat seeking to take over Europe. Political scientists and other commentators have characterised this Islamophobic stance as culturally racist. Both online and at its events, EDL members have incited violence against Muslims, with supporters carrying out violent acts both at demonstrations and independently. The EDL's broader ideology features nationalism and populism, blaming a perceived decline in English culture on high immigration rates and an uncaring political elite. It distinguished itself from Britain's traditional far-right by rejecting biological racism, antisemitism, and homophobia. Commentators differ on whether the EDL itself is ideologically fascist, although several of its leaders were previously involved in fascist organisations and some neo-Nazis and other fascists attended EDL events. Headed by a small leadership team, the EDL sub-divided into over 90 local and thematic divisions, each with considerable autonomy. Its support base consisted primarily of young, working- class white British men, some from established far-right and football hooligan subcultures. Polls indicated that most UK citizens opposed the EDL, and the organisation was repeatedly challenged by anti-fascist groups. Many local councils and police forces discouraged EDL marches, citing the high financial cost of policing them, the disruptive influence on community harmony, and the damage caused to counter-terrorism operations. History In the early 21st century, Muslims were Britain's second largest and fastest-growing religious group; according to the 2011 census, 2.7 million people in England and Wales described themselves as Muslim, representing 4.8% of the total population. At the same time, Muslims became the main scapegoat for far-right groups across Western society. In Britain, this was partly because prejudices against Jews and African-Caribbean people‚Äîboth communities the far-right previously used as social scapegoats‚Äîwere increasingly socially unacceptable. In the latter half of the 20th century, most British Muslims were of South Asian heritage. When they faced racist abuse, such as \\"Paki-bashing\\", it was usually because of their racial background, rather than their religious belief. By the 21st century, British Muslims were increasingly targeted because they were Muslim, including by members of other ethnic minorities in the country. The British National Party (BNP) was most successful at exploiting growing hostility against Muslims. It launched an overtly anti-Muslim campaign in 2000, which gained momentum after Salafi jihadi Muslims perpetrated the 2001 September 11 attacks in the United States and then the 7 July 2005 London bombings. This resulted in growing electoral success for the BNP: it secured a seat on the London Assembly in 2008 and two seats at the European Parliament in 2010. By 2011, this support had declined, with the party losing many of its local council seats. However, as noted by the political scientist Chris Allen, the BNP had \\"extended the frontier of the far right in British politics\\", creating an environment on which the English Defence League would later capitalise. Foundation: 2009 The EDL's first protest took place outside of the East London Mosque in Whitechapel in June 2009 The town of Luton in Bedfordshire‚Äîwhich had a Muslim population of around 18%‚Äîhad a history of radical Islamist recruitment. On 10 March 2009, the small, extreme British Salafi Islamist group Ahlus Sunnah wal Jamaah demonstrated in the town to protest against the Royal Anglian Regiment's homecoming parade following the latter's posting in Afghanistan. The demonstration was a deliberately provocative publicity stunt, and had been disowned by representatives from Luton's Islamic communities. The protest, although small, attracted media attention, generating anger that the authorities had given the demonstration permission and police protection. A former regiment member, James Yeomans, organised a counter protest called \\"Respect Our Troops\\" for 28 March. After local anti-Islamist blogger Paul \\"Lionheart\\" Ray publicised the event online, various self-described \\"anti-jihadist\\" far-right groups that had emerged from the football hooligan firm scene‚Äîincluding the Welsh Defence League (WDL) and the March for England (MfE)‚Äîannounced their intention to attend. Fearing the far right would hijack his event, Yeomans cancelled it. In its place, Ray organised an \\"anti-jihadist\\" march for St. George's Day, led by the newly founded United People of Luton (UPL), although this was broken up by police. The UPL organised a second demonstration for 24 May, titled \\"Ban the Terrorists\\": this again resulted in disorder, with police making several arrests. A related group was Casuals United, founded by established football hooligan Jeff Marsh: their website used the tagline \\"One Nation, One Enemy, One Firm\\", reflecting the group's desire to unite rival football firms in opposition to what it called the \\"Islamification\\" of Britain. Tommy Robinson (pictured in 2018) became de facto leader of the EDL shortly after its formation It was from this environment that the English Defence League was officially formed on 27 June 2009. Ray claimed to have been its founder, describing how the EDL united the UPL with other \\"anti-jihadist\\" groups from around England. Its creation reflected what the political scientist Roger Eatwell termed \\"cumulative extremism\\", whereby the \\"activities of one extremist group trigger the formation of another\\". The EDL took its name from that of the Welsh Defence League; its founders also considered the name \\"British Defence League\\", but rejected this as being too similar to that of the British National Party. The EDL's foundation was accompanied by an impromptu protest outside the East London Mosque in Whitechapel, which police quickly dispersed. The following week the group picketed an event in Wood Green, North London organised by Salafi Islamist preacher Anjem Choudary and his Islam4UK group. Its first major public appearance to attract attention was in August, when the EDL and Casuals United held a joint protest in Birmingham, prompted by Ahlus Sunnah wal Jamaah's conversion of an eleven-year-old white boy in that city. Ray distanced himself from that event, arguing that the chosen date‚Äî8 August‚Äîwas a deliberate reference to 88, a code for HH (Heil Hitler), in neo-Nazi circles. Not long after the group's formation, Ray formed a sub-group, the St. George Division; this broke from the EDL soon after, when Ray emigrated. This left the way for Tommy Robinson to become the EDL's de facto leader. A former BNP member with multiple criminal convictions for assault, Robinson's real name is Stephen Yaxley-Lennon; the pseudonym was borrowed from the head of a Luton football hooligan firm who had written several books about hooliganism. Robinson was clearly spoken, articulate and able to present his views in an assured and eloquent way during television interviews and other encounters with the media. According to the political scientist Joel Busher, Robinson was \\"a high-energy, fast-talking, all action character whose combination of swagger, self-deprecation and derring-do helped make him a popular figurehead within the movement.\\" Ray was critical of his successor, and‚Äîfrom his new base in Malta‚Äîposted videos to YouTube in which he threatened to retake control of the EDL. These threats came to nothing. Robinson's right-hand man was his cousin, Kevin Carroll, also a former BNP member with a criminal conviction; Carroll was the first of the pair to attract national attention, appearing on the BBC documentary Young, British and Angry. Another senior member was the multimillionaire IT consultant and fundamentalist Christian Alan Ayling, who used the pseudonym Alan Lake; allegations have been made, but not substantiated, that Lake was the group's primary financier, providing it with millions of pounds. Lake never become a visible figure in the movement and few members knew his name; it was at Lake's flat in London's Barbican area, however, where Ray, Robinson and Ann Marchini had discussed the EDL's formation in May 2009. Growth: 2010‚Äì2013 Following the BNP's decline as a serious electoral force, the EDL's profile rose dramatically. The group portrayed itself as a necessary response to public frustration at the government's inaction in dealing with what the EDL initially termed \\"extremist Muslim preachers and organisations\\". It claimed that Englishness had been marginalised throughout England, citing the fact that some state schools only supplied halal meat and had stopped celebrating Nativity plays at Christmas time as evidence. It was also claimed that some local authorities had ceased flying the flag of St George. The EDL focused on organising demonstrations: between 2009 and 2015, it held an average of between ten and fifteen demonstrations per year, attracting crowds of between 100 and 3000. It faced opposition from media commentators and anti-fascist groups, who described it as racist, far right, and extreme right, terms rejected by the group. Most notable among the anti-fascist groups organising counter-protests was Unite Against Fascism, while Islamic groups sometimes also held counter-protests. In turn, the EDL targeted left-wing groups. In December 2010, Robinson threatened action against student anti-fee protesters, while in 2011 the EDL harassed Occupy anti-capitalist protesters in London. During the 2011 England riots, contingents of EDL members mobilised in largely white areas of Outer London, such as Enfield and Eltham, claiming that they were there to \\"defend\\" them from rioters. These also resulted in clashes with police, and in one incident EDL members attacked a bus primarily carrying black youths. Tommy Robinson (centre-right, in the light coloured jacket) with other EDL members on a visit to Amsterdam The EDL began to lose momentum in 2011. Factors that contributed to this included regional rivalries between divisions, a resurgence of sectarian enmities between rival football firms, and personal squabbles. By early 2011, several divisions in northern England were referring to themselves as \\"the Infidels\\", expressing an increasingly separate identity from the EDL. Several of the northern groups expressed support for a former EDL regional organiser, John \\"Snowy\\" Shaw, who had accused Robinson and Carroll of financial impropriety. At a February 2011 EDL rally in Blackburn, Shaw's supporters violently clashed with Robinson's; Robinson fought with a fellow member at the rally, resulting in a September 2011 conviction for assault. Robinson's criminal record prevented him from entering the US, but in September 2011 he sought to do so illegally by using someone else's passport. He was caught and returned to Britain; in January 2013 he was convicted of breaching the Identity Documents Act 2010 and imprisoned for ten months. Robinson's imprisonment coincided with Carroll's bail conditions, which barred him from contacting fellow EDL members; this left the organisation without its co-leaders for part of 2012. The revelation of links to Norwegian far-right activist Anders Behring Breivik, perpetrator of a series of bombing and shooting attacks in July 2011, killing 77 people, further damaged the EDL. He was affiliated with the EDL's Norwegian sister organisation, the Norwegian Defence League, and stated that he had \\"more than 600 EDL members as Facebook friends and have spoken with tens [sic] of EDL members and leaders\\". Breivik described EDL co-founder Ray as his \\"mentor\\", having been in communication with him since 2002. Four months before his attack, Breivik posted on the EDL website, describing them as an \\"inspiration\\" and \\"a blessing to all in Europe\\". Online, he described having attended an EDL rally in Bradford. Robinson denied any EDL links with Breivik and deplored the killings; however, after Breivik was convicted, some EDL members praised his actions. In July 2011, Interpol requested Maltese police investigate Ray due to his links with Breivik; he too condemned the killings, calling them \\"pure evil\\". In December 2011, two EDL supporters‚Äîone a serving soldier in the British military‚Äîwere convicted of plotting to bomb a mosque in Stoke-on- Trent. \\\\- \\\\- Building political links Newcastle in 2010 The EDL developed links with the British Freedom Party (BFP), a BNP breakaway founded in October 2010. The BFP was led by Eddy Butler, who had previously made an unsuccessful attempt to oust the BNP leader Nick Griffin. The BFP wanted to move closer to mainstream politics by disassociating itself from the BNP's emphasis on biological racism and imitating continental European right-wing groups such as the Dutch Party for Freedom. In May 2012, it was announced that Robinson and Carroll would join the BFP's executive council as joint vice chairs, cementing links between the BFP and the EDL. Robinson soon resigned from this position, citing a desire to focus on the EDL, although critics suggested that this may have been to shield the BFP from criminal proceedings he then faced. In 2012, Carroll stood for election in the Police and Crime Commissioner elections. In January 2013, he took charge of the BFP after its leader, Paul Weston, resigned. The BFP did poorly at a series of local elections, failing to gain sufficient votes to have its deposits returned; its failure to register correctly led the Electoral Commission to remove its registration. Among the EDL grassroots, there had been much opposition to association with the BFP; many feared that it would damage the EDL's reputation or stressed their desire to be part of a street movement rather than a political party. The EDL subsequently established links with another BNP breakaway group; in February 2013, it provided a security force for an event by the far-right British Democratic Party (BDP), which was founded by Andrew Brons, who had previously represented the BNP at the European Parliament. Decline: 2013‚Äìpresent By early 2013, commentators believed that the EDL was in decline, reflected in the decreasing numbers attending its events, Robinson's imprisonment, and its failure to enter electoral politics. Groups which had closely allied to the EDL, such as Casuals United and March for England, were reasserting their individual identities. Splinter groups appeared, among them the North West Infidels, North East Infidels, South East Alliance and Combined Ex-Forces. Some of these, such as the North West Infidels and South East Alliance, adopted more extreme perspectives, cooperating with the fascist National Front and making reference to the white supremacist 14 words slogan on their social media. Other activists moved away from the EDL to focus on campaigning for Brexit, the UK's exit from the European Union. It is possible that the electoral growth of the right-wing UK Independence Party (UKIP) in this period also contributed to the EDL's decline, with many EDL supporters finding it easier to vote for UKIP than physically attend EDL events. In April 2013, the EDL leadership requested that members use tactical voting to benefit UKIP; the latter responded by distancing itself from the EDL. The North West Infidels at an EDL rally; this was one of the splinter groups which emerged from the EDL as it fragmented The EDL experienced a brief resurgence in its fortunes after Islamist militants killed the British Army soldier Lee Rigby in southeast London in May 2013. The group tripled its number of Facebook followers in the 24 hours after the incident, and organised several flash demonstrations. At one such event, Robinson told members that \\"What you saw today [i.e. Rigby's killing] is Islam. Everyone's had enough.\\" On 27 May, the EDL held a demonstration in central London that attracted a thousand participants; another, held in central Birmingham in July, attracted several hundred. On 8 October 2013, Robinson and Carroll announced that they were leaving the EDL following meetings with the think tank Quilliam. Robinson said that street protests were \\"no longer effective\\" and \\"acknowledged the dangers of far-right extremism\\". He stated his intention to continue to combat extremism by forming a new party. Both Robinson and Carroll had been taking lessons in Islam from a Quilliam member, Usama Hasan, and stated their intent to train in lobbying institutions. Quilliam had given Robinson ¬£8000 to facilitate his departure; it hoped that in doing so it would \\"decapitate\\" the EDL. Robinson's departure generated much anger among the grassroots, many of whom came to regard him as a traitor. A meeting of the group's regional organisers led to the EDL's adoption of a new system of collective leadership, through which the 19 regional organisers formed a governing committee with a rotating chair. The first to take on this role was Tim Ablitt; in February 2014 he was succeeded by Steve Eddowes; and in December 2015 by Ian Crossland, with the grassroots having been given a voice in his selection through an online vote. Although the EDL had declined, the sentiments feeding it‚Äîespecially anger at immigration and Islam‚Äîremained widespread in white working-class communities across Britain. Other far-right groups emerged to claim the space in British society that it left vacant, often utilising the EDL's tactics. Britain First sought to court disenchanted EDL members, although the two groups were mutually hostile. Like the EDL, Britain First utilised street protests, organising what it called \\"Christian patrols\\" through areas with Islamic communities, as well as \\"mosque invasions\\" in which members marched into mosques to disrupt proceedings. In December 2015, Robinson launched another anti-Islam street movement, Pegida UK, with fellow far-right activist Anne Marie Waters; his hope was to imitate the successes of the German Pegida movement. Ideology Political scientists locate the EDL on the far-right of the left‚Äìright political spectrum, sometimes referring to its ideology as \\"extreme right\\", or \\"right-wing extremism\\". In various respects, it resembles other far-right groups, particularly those that emerged across early 21st century Europe. From its early days, its demonstrations were attended by members of older far-right parties such as the NF and BNP, however the EDL itself differs from these older groups by reaching out to Jews, people of colour, and LGBT people, against whom the far right historically discriminated. Thus, the historian of the far right Paul Jackson referred to it as part of a \\"new far right\\" which presents itself as being more moderate than its predecessors. The ethnographer Hilary Pilkington suggested that Cas Mudde's concept of the \\"populist radical right\\" better defines the EDL than \\"far-right\\". The EDL has been characterised as populist because of its claim to represent \\"ordinary people\\" against the liberal elites whom it alleges control the country. The EDL disavows the \\"far-right\\" label, describing itself as \\"non-political, taking no position on right-wing vs. left-wing. We welcome members from all over the political spectrum, and with varying views on foreign policy, united against Islamic extremism and its influence on British life.\\" Its online material nevertheless often condemns left-wingers. When examining the EDL's public statements, Jackson cautioned against automatically taking them at face value; as he noted, far-right groups typically present \\"front stage\\" messages for public consumption which conceal the more aggressive views expressed in private. Anti-Islamism and Islamophobia EDL members regularly refer to Islam as an \\"ideology\\" or a \\"cult\\" rather than a \\"religion\\", and perceive it as a threat to Western culture. Evoking Samuel P. Huntington's notion of the Clash of Civilizations, the group's discourse constructs a binary division between Western and Islamic culture, the former presented as tolerant and progressive and the latter as intolerant and backward. EDL rhetoric explicitly distinguishes Muslims from the English national group: for the EDL, a Muslim cannot be truly English, and the idea of an English Muslim or a British Muslim identity is not considered acceptable. An EDL march in Newcastle in 2017 The EDL is part of the international \\"counter-jihad\\" movement. The political scientist Hilary Aked defined counter- jihadism as \\"a section of the far-right distinguished by its hostility to migrants, Muslims and Islam.\\" Another political scientist, Matthew Goodwin, noted that the counter-jihad movement was \\"united by their belief that Islam and Muslims are posing a fundamental threat to the resources, identities and even survival of Western states\\", and that counter-jihad groups were \\"more confrontational, chaotic and unpredictable than traditional anti-immigrant and ethnic nationalist movements in Western democracies\\". Pilkington characterised the EDL as an \\"anti-Islamist movement\\", but considered there to be crossover with broader anti-Islam or anti-Muslim positions. The EDL states it only opposes the \\"Islamic extremist\\" but not the \\"ordinary Muslim\\", a distinction also drawn by many of its activists. However, the EDL's rhetoric regularly fails to make this distinction. It is likely that many encountering the EDL's rhetoric are not able to appreciate a distinction between different interpretations of Islam, and research among the group's grassroots found that many did not do so. Various scholars describe the EDL as Islamophobic, a characterisation the EDL rejects. It does so by defining \\"Islamophobia\\" as a phobia or affected prejudice, a definition different from the majority of academics and activists employing the term, stating that \\"the English Defence League do not 'fear' Islam, we do not have a 'phobia' about Islam, we just realise the very serious threat it poses\\". The EDL is part of the broader \\"counter-jihad\\" movement, an international far-right phenomenon focused on opposing the presence of Islam in Western states The EDL fears that Muslims want to dominate Britain by imposing sharia law. It claims that this takeover is being facilitated by higher birth rates among Muslims than non-Muslims, and characterises the building of mosques as evidence of this desire for domination. It presents Muslim attempts to participate in political life as entryism, an attempt to expand Islamic influence in the Britain. The group and its members also allege that British Muslims implicitly support Islamic extremism by failing to speak out against it. EDL discourse refers to \\"Islamic supremacism\\", the belief that Muslims express a superiority complex over non- Muslims. It believes that Muslims view non-Muslims as legitimate targets for abuse and exploitation. A topic of particular anger among members is the role of men from Muslim backgrounds in grooming gangs largely targeting underage white girls. For instance, in drawing attention to the fact that men from Islamic backgrounds were disproportionately represented in the Rochdale and West Midlands child sex grooming scandals, the EDL claimed these men found justification for their actions in Qur'anic references to non-Muslims being inferior. Conversely, when white sex offenders were exposed, EDL members regarded the perpetrator's ethnicity or religion as irrelevant. EDL members also expressed anger at perceived Muslim involvement in drug dealing and other crimes impacting their communities, and at the perceived wealth of British Muslims, which they contrasted with their own strained economic situation. The sociologists Simon Winlow, Steve Hall and James Treadwell noted that all the EDL members they encountered expressed hatred of Muslims. Many placed this hatred in relation to local issues and personal experiences; for instance, EDL members regarded being poorly treated by an Asian shopkeeper as evidence that Muslims intrinsically hate the white working class. Others expressed anger at events they had seen in the media, such as Muslims burning remembrance poppies in protest at British military activities abroad. On the EDL's social media, many supporters incite violence against Muslims: examples include \\"we need to kill\\", \\"time to get violent\\", and \\"Kill any muslim u see [sic]\\". Chants during rallies included \\"Die, Muslim, die\\", and \\"Give me a gun and I'll shoot the Muzzie scum\\". The racial slur \\"paki\\" was also common at private EDL meetings, and at demonstrations; chants used include \\"I hate Pakis more than you\\" and \\"If we all hate Pakis, clap your hands\\". Nationalism, anti-immigrationism, and views on race and sexuality The EDL is nationalist, or ultra- nationalist, and its members regard themselves as patriots. Some academics argued it is ethnic nationalist, although Pilkington stressed that despite their nativist sentiment, most members' sense of English pride was distinct from the \\"white pride\\" of fascists. Its members' understandings of \\"Englishness\\" are nevertheless ambiguous and ill-defined; the only thing they agree upon about the English way of life is that Muslims fundamentally reject it. The EDL presents English identity as something that is under threat, and its views are reflected in chants like \\"we want our country back\\". Its nationalism is foregrounded in its nomenclature and symbols, which regularly include the cross of St George. Such imagery evokes the symbolism of the medieval Crusades; its Latin motto, \\"in hoc signo vinces\\", was that of the first Christian Roman Emperor, Constantine. Alessio and Meredith thought the EDL is anti-immigrant, and anti-migrant sentiment is common among EDL members. They see immigration as detrimental to the white British, socially divisive, and fundamentally changing the nature of England. EDL members see migrants as economic competition, outcompeting white British workers for jobs by working for less that the legal minimum wage. At the same time, they often express sympathy for migrants as individuals seeking a better life, and typically distinguish between \\"good\\" migrants who worked hard and paid taxes and \\"bad\\" migrants who live off the welfare state. The EDL says it is not racist, and employs the slogan \\"Black and White unite: all races and religions are welcome in the EDL\\". It formed specific divisions for Hindu, Sikh, Jewish, Greek and Cypriot, and Pakistani Christian supporters, and small numbers of Asian, African, and mixed heritage supporters attended its events. These are often viewed as \\"trophy\\" members, with many white members asking to have their photographs taken with them. Members are often keen to stress that they have ethnic minority friends and family members as a means of countering accusations of racism, adopting the view that \\"lack of racism towards one group is assumed to be evidence of lack of racism against all\\". Members often view the multi-racial nature of England as a positive thing, although almost uniformly reject the ideology of multiculturalism, portraying it as something mainstream politicians have encouraged out of a desire to be seen as cosmopolitan and progressive and because of a fascination for the exoticism of other cultures. The EDL condemns homophobia and established an LGBT division in March 2010. This pro-LGBT rights stance allows the EDL to criticise what it presents as the left's refusal to confront Islamic homophobia. Pilkington argued that this pro-LGBT rights stance was not solely a cynical ploy by the EDL's leadership, but reflected widespread views within the movement. She observed gay and transgender speakers receiving a warm reception at EDL rallies, while the LGBT rainbow flag was regularly flown at EDL rallies; at the same time, Pilkington heard homophobic comments at EDL events. Relationship to fascism and neo-Nazism National Front (NF) in Yorkshire during the 1970s. The EDL's tactics of street marches and demonstrations have been described as being similar to those of the NF. Several commentators have argued that the EDL is not fascist. Nigel Copsey, a historian of the far- right, stated that the EDL was not driven by the same \\"ideological end-goal\\" as neo-fascist and other fascist groups; unlike fascist groups, the EDL has not expressed a desire for major structural change to the British state. Several fascist groups sought to differentiate themselves from the EDL; the BNP leader Nick Griffin for instance claimed the EDL was a false flag operation manipulated by \\"Zionists\\". Conversely, the political scientists Dominic Alessio and Meredith Kristen argued that the EDL \\"embodied\\" many of the \\"key characteristics of fascism\\": a staunch nationalism and calls for national rebirth, a propensity for violence, and what they described as \\"pronounced anti-democratic and anti-liberal tendencies\\" among its leaders. They highlighted that much of the group's leadership came directly from the fascist BNP, and that EDL events have been supported by present and former members of fascist groups like the National Front (NF), the Racial Volunteer Force, Blood & Honour, and Combat 18. The EDL is not a neo-Nazi organisation. It distanced itself from neo-Nazism, for instance by burning a Nazi flag, flying the Israeli flag during demonstrations, and creating a Jewish division. In 2010, Robinson stated: \\"We're not Nazis, we're not fascists ‚Äì we will smash Nazis the same way we will smash militant Islam.\\" Early EDL demonstrations were nevertheless advertised on the white supremacist website Stormfront, and Holocaust denial has been espoused on the EDL's social media platforms. Known neo-Nazis have attended EDL events, where individuals have been recorded giving the Nazi straight-arm salute. In 2011, the head of the EDL's Jewish Division, Roberta Moore, left the organisation, citing the presence of neo- Nazis and other fascists. Some of these individuals have been banned from EDL events by the group. Pilkington found that this desire to expunge the EDL of neo-Nazi and fascist elements was not just a top-down exercise in public relations, but had the popular support of EDL members more broadly, who were keen to distinguish themselves from neo-Nazis. Organisation and structure A social movement‚Äîand more specifically a new social movement and social movement organisation‚Äîthe EDL is a direct action or street-based protest movement. A pressure group rather than a political party, its members often stress their opinion that it was not a political organisation. Like other counter-jihad groups in Western countries, the EDL describes itself as a human rights organisation, a characterisation not widely accepted among the British public. Leadership and branches Robinson was the EDL's co-leader during its period of major growth and national attention The EDL's informal structure lacks strict hierarchy, or clear leadership. In its early years, the EDL was controlled by a leadership group referred to as the \\"team\\"; this included Robinson, although other members often remained anonymous or used pseudonyms. In 2010, the EDL went through a formal restructuring to deal with Robinson's absence, although until October 2013 the EDL was led by Robinson and Carroll as co-leaders, supported by the regional organisers of the 19 regional divisions. After that duo left, it was reorganised around a committee leadership headed by a rotating chair. The EDL lacks a central regulatory structure through which to impose a uniform approach to strategy or maintain ideological purity. It operates through a loose network of local divisions, each largely autonomous; this loose structure is popular among the membership. There is no system of official membership recognised through membership cards, and no membership fees. The EDL formerly divided into at least ninety different divisions. Branches typically held their meeting in pubs with sympathetic owners, referred to as \\"HQs\\". These meetings‚Äîwhich were infrequent and often poorly attended‚Äîwere typically unstructured, lacking any formal agenda or the taking of minutes. As well as these divisional meetings, EDL divisions also held \\"meet and greet\\" events to attract new membership. Some divisions were based on locality and others on special interests. The latter included a women's division, Jewish division, Sikh division, Hindu division, and LGBT division. For a brief period it also had a disabled division, green division, a soldiers' division, and a youth division. These groups were designed to raise the profile of particular social groups within the EDL itself and help to draw recruits from sectors of society that normally avoided membership in a far-right grouping, such as ethnic minorities and LGBT people. Some local divisions covered whole cities or counties while in other cases there could be more than one division representing a single postcode, in part due to personal disputes. Local groups were organised into a series of nine areas: North West, North East, East Midlands, West Midlands, East Anglia, South West, South East, South East Central, and Greater London. In 2010, new regional organisers were introduced for each; the EDL was heavily reliant on these grassroots networks and the initiative of local and regional leaders. Demonstrations The EDL's primary activity was street protests, which regularly attracted media attention. These protests came in three forms: national demonstrations attracting activists from across the country, local demonstrations featuring largely the local EDL division, and flash demonstrations held without giving the authorities prior warning of the event. The use of aggressive street rallies has a long history among the British far right, having been previously used by the British Union of Fascists in the 1930s, the National Front in the 1970s, and the British National Party in the 1980s and 1990s. Copsey noted that the \\"overwhelming majority\\" of attendees at EDL demonstrations were \\"young, white, working-class males\\". Relatively few women attended, and similarly comparatively few people of colour joined. EDL members had a \\"street uniform\\" in the form of wristbands, t-shirts, and hoodies bearing the group's logo. The hoodie was often selected for its intimidating atmosphere and for its symbolic connections with the chav stereotype, thus reasserting members' working-class identity. Many members wore masks decorated with either the EDL logo or the St George's cross; some wore pig face masks or masks of figures whom they wished to ridicule, such as the Salafi jihadist leader Osama bin Laden. Others carried the English flag of St George or the British Union Jack flag, and the Israeli and LGBT Pride flags were also often in attendance. Reflecting the place of football hooligans in the EDL, some male members wore expensive designer clothing to its rallies. To reach national events, local EDL groups often hired coaches to transport them to their destination. The coach provided a space in which these members engaged in singing, banter, story-telling, and practical jokes. As well as being protests, these demonstrations served as social events for EDL members, helping to forge a sense of solidarity and of the EDL as \\"one big family\\". At demonstrations, many members‚Äîincluding those too young to legally drink‚Äîconsume large quantities of alcohol, with some also consuming cocaine prior to the protest. Street protest organised by the EDL in Newcastle, England. (The placard reads \\"Shut down the Mosque Command and Control Centre.\\") At demonstrations, speeches typically focus on the perceived threat of Islamification, but also raise issues like the dangers of political correctness and the errors of the political left. EDL demonstrations were typified by continuous chanting with aggressive slogans aimed at Muslims. Pilkington divided these chants into three types: those which were anti-Islam, those which were patriotic in referencing an English identity, and those which were identity affirming in making specific reference to the EDL itself. Alongside chants, the EDL often employed songs, including the UK national anthem \\"God Save the Queen\\", patriotic songs like \\"Keep St George in my Heart, Keep me English\\"‚Äîsung to the tune of the hymn \\"Give Me Joy in My Heart\\"‚Äîand the anti-Islam themed \\"There were Ten Muslim Bombers in the Air\\". During demonstrations, the EDL have regularly been met with opposition from anti- fascist groups like Unite Against Fascism, and sometimes also from Islamic groups. The clashes between the rival groups often resulted in violence and public disorder, with the police seeking to keep the two apart. The police and local authorities initially allowed most EDL rallies to take place and did not often request banning orders. In October 2010, West Yorkshire Police successfully requested a government ban on the EDL holding a rally in Bradford, fearing that it would spark violent racial tensions akin to those which had taken place in 2001. In October 2010, the Home Secretary Theresa May granted Leicester Police's request to ban a planned EDL march in that city. By September 2011, over 600 arrests had been made in connection with EDL demonstrations and the policing costs were estimated to have exceeded ¬£10 million. In some cases, most of those arrested were EDL members; in others, most of those arrested were counter-protesters. Mobilising on local issues The EDL sometimes mobilise around local tensions between Islamic and non-Muslim communities, campaigns often organised by local divisions rather than the national leadership. After inebriated Somali women racially assaulted a white woman in Leicester in June 2010, the EDL organised a protest rally there, attributing the attack to the supremacist attitude that Islam supposedly cultivated among its followers. When a white man was assaulted by Asian youths in the Hyde area of Greater Manchester, the EDL again organised a demonstration, blaming the attack on Muslims, although police had not ascertained the perpetrators' religious background. In April 2011, the group demonstrated in Blackburn in response to hit and run incidents where Muslim drivers had hit non-Muslims; the EDL disregarded requests by the victims' families not to politicise the events. In 2011, the EDL launched a nationwide campaign, \\"No New Mosques\\", which built upon earlier campaigns against mosque construction organised by various local divisions. When a mosque was due to be built in West Bridgford, an EDL organiser and three associates placed a severed pig's head at the site, accompanied with the spray-painted slogan \\"No mosque here EDL Notts\\". In April 2010, 3000 EDL demonstrators protested the construction of a new mosque in Dudley. Two months later, EDL members occupied the roof of an abandoned building on the site of the proposed mosque, expressing their intent to play the Islamic call to prayer five times a day to alert locals to the noise pollution they would suffer when the mosque was built. Police swiftly removed the demonstrators. The EDL is aware that its demonstrations prove costly for local authorities. The Dudley Metropolitan Borough Council for instance stated that policing the 2010 EDL protest had cost over ¬£1 million. To deal with an EDL protest in Leicester, the Leicestershire Police Force had to put on its largest operation in 25 years, bringing in 2000 police officers to manage the demonstration. The EDL used this leverage to pressurise local councils into agreeing to some of its demands; in 2010 it issued a letter stating that any local councils that held Winter-themed festivities rather than explicitly Christmas-themed ones could \\"have their town/city visited by the English Defence League throughout the following year\\". Violence thumb|Video of damage being caused to a restaurant in Leicester. A supporter of the English Defence League was later convicted for his involvement in the attack, and admitted causing criminal damage worth ¬£1500. The EDL claims to disavow violence, although many attending its rallies stated that they did so because they enjoyed the adrenalin rush brought on by violent confrontation. Some also described violent clashes as the best way to draw media attention to their cause, and presented their violence as being heroic. Meadowcroft and Morrow argued that many football hooligans joined the EDL because of the opportunity that its rallies offered for violence at a time when there were decreasing opportunities to do so at football matches themselves due to greater use of banning orders targeting known hooligans, a more effective police presence, and increasing ticket prices that had becoming prohibitively high for those on low incomes. In various cases, EDL demonstrators damaged Asian-owned businesses and property; in October 2011, EDL members stormed and ransacked an Ahmadiyya Islamic bookstore in Sandwell, and in August 2011 an EDL member was convicted for vandalising a mosque. Demonstrations also led to physical attacks on Asians themselves. Not all targets of EDL violence have been Muslim; in a July 2010 demonstration in Dudley, EDL members attacked a Hindu temple. It is unclear whether they mistook it for a mosque or whether it reflected broader racist attitudes among the demonstrators. EDL members also disrupted the meetings of opponents; in September 2010 they disrupted a UAF meeting in Leicester, and later that month attacked a meeting of the Socialist Workers Party in Newcastle-upon-Tyne. EDL members also targeted left-wing bookshops and trade union buildings, and members have been jailed for attacking staff at office buildings hosting anti-EDL meetings. The EDL also targeted demonstrators from the anti-capitalist Occupy movement; in November 2011, 179 EDL members were arrested in central London for threatening members of Occupy London. Journalists that covered EDL marches also received death threats. Online activism The EDL makes significant use of the internet, including an official website and accounts on social media platforms such as Facebook and YouTube. In using social media, the EDL seeks to bypass the mainstream media, which it regards as being biased against it. The EDL hierarchy has moderated these social media accounts, blocking users critical of the EDL, but did not appear to remove posts advocating violence towards Muslims. The use of Facebook allowed the group to build momentum and expectancy ahead of public events. The EDL's Facebook following peaked at 100,000 before the Facebook corporation closed the group's account. Unlike political parties, the EDL does not produce leaflets expressing any political programme or print a magazine or newsletter. The EDL News section of its website published articles, commentary and information on forthcoming events and campaigns, which were then linked to through its social media. The EDL also used its website and eBay to sell branded merchandise, although pulled merchandise from its website in 2010. International and domestic links The EDL formed links with ideologically similar groups internationally, particularly in Europe and the United States. These included sectors of the US Tea Party movement; it affiliated with the US-based Stop Islamization of America run by Pamela Geller and Robert Spencer. Geller served as the EDL's bridge to the Tea Party movement, but later distanced herself from it, claiming that the EDL contained neo-Nazi elements. When Moore was head of the EDL's Jewish Division, she established links with a far-right Jewish American group, the Jewish Task Force. In September 2010, EDL representatives joined demonstrations in New York City's Lower Manhattan to protest against the construction of the \\"Ground Zero Mosque\\", and in 2012 attended the \\"Stop Islamization of Nations\\" conference, again in New York City. EDL members attended a Berlin rally organised by the Pax Europa Citizens Movement in April 2010 in support of Geert Wilders, a right-wing, populist politician who had been charged for comparing Islam to Nazism. In June 2010 two EDL representatives attended the Counter-Jihad 2020 conference held by the anti- Muslim International Civil Liberties Alliance in Zurich. In October 2010, Robinson and other EDL members travelled to Amsterdam to protest outside Wilders's trial, although Wilders himself stated that he had no personal contact with the EDL. Here, Robinson announced plans for a \\"European Friendship Initiative\\" with the German, Dutch, and French Defence Leagues. In April 2011, Robinson and other EDL representatives attended a small rally in Lyon, alongside the French far-right group Bloc Identitaire; various participants, including Robinson, were arrested. In June 2011, it sent representatives to Pax Europa's counter-jihadist conference in Stuttgart. Branded EDL clothing listing the group's links with other organisations abroad It has partnered with the Welsh Defence League, Scottish Defence League, and Ulster Defence League, none of which had the same success as their English counterpart. The Scottish Defence League retained secret links with the BNP, although in Scotland, it was difficult to bridge sectarian divisions between rival football firms. Sectarianism was also a major issue for the Ulster Defence League, which decided against holding any demonstrations in Northern Ireland itself. The Welsh Defence League faced divisions between its contingent from Swansea, some of whom were former members of Combat 18, and the Casuals United-contingent from Cardiff. After a BBC Wales investigation into the group revealed that a number of its members had neo-Nazi beliefs, in 2011 it was shut down and replaced by the Welsh Casuals. The EDL also established links to the Danish Defence League, which established 10 chapters within its first year of operation. However recent attempts to establish a presence in Denmark and the Netherlands have failed to attract support and were respectively described as \\"a humiliation\\" and as \\"a damp squib\\". The Norwegian Defence League (NDL) is a sister organisation of the EDL. There are strong connections between the two organisations, and the leadership of the EDL is also actively involved in the leadership of NDL. Members of the NDL have on several occasions travelled to England to participate in EDL protests. Membership and support Numbers An EDL supporter and a police officer at an EDL march in Newcastle in 2010 The EDL's size has been difficult to gauge. It has no official system of membership, and thus no membership list. Pilkington argued that the EDL's active membership, meaning those who attended its rallies and events, peaked between January and April 2010, when national demonstrations could accrue 2000 people, but by the end of that year this had declined to between 800 and 1000. By 2012, the group's national demonstrations were typically only attracting between 300 to 700 people. In 2011, Bartlett and Littler estimated that between 25,000 and 35,000 people were active EDL members, the highest concentration being in Greater London. In July 2010, the EDL had 22,000 Facebook followers; following the 2013 killing of Lee Rigby this reached 160,000, and as of February 2015 had risen further to 184,000. Its Facebook following was smaller than that of its rival, Britain First; in 2015, when the EDL had 181,000 followers, Britain First had 816,000. Pilkington noted a \\"high turnover in the movement\\", while Winlow, Hall and Treadwell observed that members \\"drift in and out of its activities\\". Many of the EDL's supporters did not attend its street protests and were called \\"armchair warriors\\" by the group. Researchers found many supporters did not attend demonstrations because they feared violence, arrest, and the loss of employment, while many EDL women and older men saw demonstrations as primarily being events for young men. Involvement with the EDL could bring problems for its members which would dissuade their ongoing involvement; these included financial costs, the loss of friends, potential police scrutiny, and the restrictions it placed on their time. Various members described losing friendships and family relationships because of their involvement in the EDL, while others concealed their involvement fearing that they would lose their jobs. Some expressed fears that social services would take their children into care if their EDL membership was known, or that they would be the target of violence from anti-fascists and Muslims. Profile of members Most EDL members are young, working-class, white men. The EDL unites three main constituencies: football hooligans, longstanding far-right activists, and a range of socio-economically marginalised people. Copsey noted that \\"beyond their antagonism towards Islam, there is no ideology that binds this ragbag coalition together\\", and that the EDL was therefore always susceptible to fracture. For most EDL members, their membership is their first active involvement in a political group. On the basis of her ethnographic research among the EDL, Pilkington found that 74% of her respondents were under 35, in contrast to the BNP and UKIP's older support base. 77% were male to 23% female. 51% described themselves as being \\"White English\\", and 23% as \\"White British\\". Only 6% had either completed or were studying for a higher education degree; 20% never completed secondary education. 49% were unemployed, 20% were in either part-time or irregular employment, and 11% were in full-time employment. 57% lived in social housing, in contrast to 17.5% of the general population. Pilkington found that EDL members had rarely been raised in \\"stable, strong and protective environments\\", that accounts of sexual abuse and violence in childhood were somewhat common, and that a number had been raised by grandparents or in foster care. She noted that very few regarded themselves as Christian. Pilkington also found that while all were critical of recent governments, none‚Äîbarring the few neo-Nazis who attended EDL rallies but did not consider themselves members‚Äîdesired a more authoritarian government, one-party state, or dictatorship. In 2011, Bartlett and Littler surveyed 1,295 EDL Facebook supporters: 81% were male to 19% female; only 28% were over the age of thirty, and only 30% had attended either college or university. Bartlett and Littler found that EDL supporters were disproportionately unemployed. The issue that was most important to those surveyed was immigration, which they ranked higher than Islamic extremism. 34% voted for the BNP, 14% for UKIP, 14% for the Conservatives, and 9% for Labour. When asked to rank their three most important personal values, 36% said security, 34% said strong government, 30% said rule of law, and 26% said individual freedom. The surveyed EDL supporters also displayed significantly higher than average levels of distrust in the government, police, and judiciary. Additional research by Matthew Goodwin, David Cutts, and Laurence Janta-Lupinski drew upon the data gathered by YouGov in an October 2012 survey. This compared 82 people who were members or were interested in joining with 298 \\"sympathisers\\" who agreed with the EDL's values but did not wish to join. Their research found \\"sympathisers\\" tended to be \\"older men, have low education levels, are skilled workers, read right-wing tabloid newspapers and support right-wing parties at elections\\", but that they were not \\"disproportionately more likely to be unemployed or live in social housing\\" than the broader population. Conversely, members and those wanting to join displayed \\"greater financial insecurity\\" and were more likely than average to be unemployed or in part-time employment, and more likely than average to live in social housing, rely on state benefits, and have no educational qualifications. Members' views EDL members persistently regard themselves as second-class citizens. Every EDL member Pilkington encountered believed the British state prioritised the needs of others‚Äîespecially immigrants and Muslims‚Äîover those of themselves and gave ethnic minorities preferential treatment. Various members cited personal experiences where they believed that this had been the case. Members frequently referenced incidents of racist abuse, bullying, violence, and murder against white British people which they felt went under-reported or inappropriately punished. The most cited example was the 2004 murder of Kriss Donald, a racist attack committed by Pakistani men on a white teenager. They also saw this two-tiered system in their perception that ethnic minorities were encouraged to display their own cultural symbols while the white English were not, citing examples in which their display of St George's flag had been censured amid accusations of racism. Most EDL members whom Busher encountered \\"had a highly binary interpretation of the world, seeing themselves as engaged in a millennial struggle between good and evil ‚Äì an existential fight for the future of their country and culture.\\" Busher noted that most activists rarely or never presented this struggle in terms of biological race, even when expressing anti-migrant sentiments. Both Busher and Pilkington encountered EDL members who came to the group from other sectors of the far-right and who claimed their views moderated as a result. Busher suggested that this might be because the EDL ideology's shifted some individual's hostility from being directed at non-white Britons broadly toward Muslims specifically. At the same time, he noted that as the EDL fragmented, members of some of its splinter groups adopted increasingly extreme views. EDL members usually reject the description of them being \\"far-right\\", or \\"racist\\". They often place great importance on being working-class and display clear bonds with their local communities. Many cite coming from families who were Labour voters and sometimes trade unionists, but also express anger at Labour, regarding it as the party of multiculturalism, political correctness, and mass immigration. Among EDL members, there is much talk of \\"stupid lefties\\" who were believed to hate the white working class. Causal factors A participant in an EDL rally in Newcastle in 2010, carrying the Union Jack flag Meadowcroft and Morrow suggested that the EDL overcame the collective action problem by offering its members \\"access to violent conflict, increased self-worth and group solidarity\\". They argued that for many working-class young men with \\"little meaning or cause for pride\\" in their lives, EDL membership allows them to \\"reimagine\\" themselves as \\"heroic freedom fighters\\" battling to save their nation from its fundamental enemy, Islam, \\"thereby bolstering their sense of self-worth.\\" They also argued that EDL membership gave individuals a sense of group identity and community which was otherwise lacking. Winlow, Hall, and Treadwell argued that the EDL's growth among the white working-class reflected how this sector of society‚Äîwhich had predominantly aligned with the political left during the 20th century‚Äîwas increasingly shifting to the far-right in the early 21st. These sociologists attributed this to changes within the mainstream British left since the 1990s: following the 1991 dissolution of the Soviet Union, Britain's mainstream left had ceased talking about regulating capitalism, Tony Blair's New Labour project had shifted Labour's focus from its traditional working-class base towards middle-class swing voters, and middle-class leftist politicians were increasingly regarding white working- class cultural values as an embarrassment. Britain's white working classes increasingly believed that public policy favoured minorities‚ÄîLGBT people, ethnic, and religious minorities‚Äîthrough affirmative action employment, drives to \\"diversify\\" workforces, and favourable media coverage. They also thought that the state had encouraged these groups to present themselves as victims. EDL supporters believed that the heterosexual white working class were left as the only cultural group without vocal political representation. These sociologists argued that economic shifts had seen traditional working-class jobs increasingly replaced by low-grade service sector jobs, often non- unionised and on zero hour contracts; EDL members were aware of this, believing that their parents and grandparents' generations had had a better quality of life. According to Winlow, Hall and Treadwell, it was the resulting \\"background of broadly felt anger and frustration\\" among the white working class, a \\"sense of disempowerment, abandonment and growing irrelevance\\", from which the EDL developed. The EDL provided these working-class individuals with \\"a very basic means of understanding their frustrations\\", blaming their economic insecurity and sense of cultural marginalisation on Muslims and immigrants. They cautioned that unless the left succeeded in reattaching itself to the white working-class then the UK would enter a period dominated by the political right. Reception and impact Counter-protest to the EDL organised by the Unite trade union, held in Newcastle in 2017 The EDL represented \\"the biggest populist street movement in a generation\\" in Britain, reviving a tradition of far-right street protest that had been largely dormant during the 2000s. The political scientists Matthew J. Goodwin, David Cutts, and Laurence Janta-Lipinski suggested that from 2009 to 2013, it represented \\"the most significant anti-Islam movement in Europe\\". In 2011, James Treadwell and Jon Garland described the EDL as \\"one of the most notable political developments of the past few years\\", while in 2013, the political scientist Julian Richards stated that the EDL had been \\"one of the more intriguing developments on the Far Right in recent years\\". Although the majority of the British population did not share all of the EDL's views on Islam, the group's rhetoric resonated with and fed into broader animosity towards Muslims in British society. The 2010 British Social Attitudes Survey found that 55% would be bothered by having a mosque built in their street, while a 2011 survey found 48% of UK citizens agreeing with the statement that Islam was \\"a religion of intolerance\\". Various commentators attributed this sentiment to elements of the tabloid media, such as the Daily Mail, The Sun, and the Daily Star. The EDL itself faced derision from much of the mainstream media, with EDL members expressing anger at how they felt the mainstream media misrepresented them by, for instance, interviewing those members at demonstrations who were evidently drunk or inarticulate. Those outside the EDL typically perceived the group as being fascist, racist, or mindlessly violent. A 2012 poll by Extremis and YouGov found that only a third of those surveyed had heard of the EDL, and that of those who had, only 11% would consider joining. Of that third, 74% considered the group racist. Opposition Police with police dogs in attendance at an EDL demonstration in Newcastle in 2010 The government regarded the EDL as a major threat to societal cohesion and integration, and there were fears that the group sought to spark racially aggravated urban disturbances similar to those of 2001. In 2009, the UK Communities Secretary John Denham condemned the EDL and compared its tactics to those used by the British Union of Fascists in the 1930s. In 2010, the Conservative Party leader‚Äîand subsequent Prime Minister‚ÄîDavid Cameron described the EDL as \\"terrible people\\", adding that \\"if we needed to ban them, we would\\". Later that year, it rejected calls to ban the group; as the EDL did not openly glorify terrorism it could not be proscribed under Britain's counter-terrorism legislation. Police reported that EDL activities hampered their own counter-terror operations among British Muslim communities. Foremost among the counter-protesters at EDL events was Unite Against Fascism (UAF), who mirrored the tactics used by the Anti-Nazi League in the 1970s. Dominated by the Socialist Workers Party, the UAF had a largely Marxist interpretation of the EDL. The UAF believed in opposing the EDL at every juncture so as to demoralise its members; the UAF's common chant was \\"Fascist scum off our streets\\". Political scientists noted that this confrontational approach gave the EDL exactly what it wanted, and that it could contribute to further radicalisation on all sides. Counter-protest to the EDL held in Leicester in 2012 Another anti-fascist group, Hope not Hate, differed in not believing that every EDL rally must meet forceful opposition. It argued that anti-fascists should adapt their tactics to the wishes of local community members in a given area, and emphasised bringing together different religious and ethnic groups in peaceful protest. Hope not Hate also foregrounded the need to establish long-term strategies to counter the EDL and far-right politics, focusing on reconnecting disenfranchised people with the established political process. Online, various leftist websites played a role in monitoring the EDL's activities. Britain's Islamic community was divided on how to respond to the EDL; some Muslims joined UAF counter-protests, although other Islamic voices called for Muslims to avoid the protests altogether. Another response was the formation of the Muslim Defence League in 2010, the stated purpose of which was to oppose Islamophobia and counter misinformation about Islam. In various instances, it supported UAF counter-protests. In 2013, six Islamists pleaded guilty to plotting a bomb and gun attack on an EDL march in Dewsbury. Other religious communities also responded to the EDL. A group called Sikhs Against the EDL was formed in response to the involvement of some Sikhs in the organisation, while the Board of Deputies of British Jews expressed disappointment at the formation of the EDL Jewish Division.

The genre focuses on male same-sex love, as created primarily by gay men for a gay male audience. Bara can vary in visual style and plot, but typically features masculine men with varying degrees of muscle, body fat, and body hair, akin to bear or bodybuilding culture. While bara is typically pornographic, the genre has also depicted romantic and autobiographical subject material, as it acknowledges the varied reactions to homosexuality in modern Japan. The use of bara as an umbrella term to describe gay Japanese comic art is largely a non-Japanese phenomenon; the term is not used within Japan, and its use is not universally accepted by creators of gay manga. Bara is occasionally conflated with yaoi (also known as boys' love or BL), but yaoi is historically created by and for women, and features bish≈çnen who frequently conform to typical seme and uke dynamics. In contrast, bara is considered a subgenre of seijin (men's erotica) for gay men, and more closely resembles manga for male readers (seinen manga) rather than manga for female readers (sh≈çjo or josei manga). Etymology The term , which translates literally to \\"rose\\" in Japanese, has historically been used in Japan as a pejorative for gay men, roughly equivalent to the English language term \\"pansy\\". Beginning in the 1960s, the term was reappropriated by Japanese gay media: notably with the 1961 anthology Ba-ra-kei: Ordeal by Roses, a collection of semi-nude photographs of gay writer Yukio Mishima by photographer Eikoh Hosoe, and later with in 1971, the first commercially produced gay magazine in Asia. Bara-eiga (\\"rose film\\") was additionally used in the 1980s to describe gay cinema. By the late 1980s, as LGBT political movements in Japan began to form, the term fell out of use, with becoming the preferred nomenclature for people who experience same-sex attraction. The term was revived as a pejorative in the late 1990s concurrent with the rise of internet message boards and chat rooms, where heterosexual administrators designated the gay sections of their websites as \\"bara boards\\" or \\"bara chat\\". The term was subsequently adopted by non-Japanese users of these websites, who believed that bara was the proper designation for the images and artwork being posted on these forums. This misappropriation of bara by a non-Japanese audience has been controversial among creators of gay manga, many of whom have expressed discomfort or confusion over the term being used to describe their work. Artist and historian Gengoroh Tagame has described bara as \\"a very negative word that comes with bad connotations\\", though he later clarified that the term is \\"convenient for talking about art that is linked by characters that are muscle-y, huge, and hairy\\", and that his objection was the term's use to describe gay manga creators. Artist Kumada Poohsuke has stated that while he does not find the term offensive, he does not describe his work as bara because he associates the term with Barazoku, which featured bish≈çnen- style artwork rather than artwork of masculine men. Today, bara is often used flexibly as an umbrella term to describe a wide variety of Japanese and non- Japanese gay media featuring masculine men, including western fan art, gay pornography, furry artwork, and numerous other categories. History :See also: Gay pornography in Japan (in Japanese) and Gay magazines in Japan (in Japanese) Contemporary gay manga traces its origins to Bara-Komi, a 1986 supplemental issue of Barazoku. While erotic art accompanied by text had previously appeared in gay interest magazines ‚Äì notably in the private circulation magazines (1952) and Bara (1964), the former of which was the first gay magazine in Japan ‚Äì Bara-Komi was the first magazine to publish gay manga exclusively. Despite its relatively recent emergence as an art form, gay manga belongs to a history of homosexuality in Japanese visual art dating back to shunga of the Edo period. Gengoroh Tagame cites the fetish magazine (1960‚Äì1974), which published gay content alongside straight and lesbian content, as a major influence on gay manga. Early gay erotic artists Tatsuji Okawa, Sanshi Funayama, Mishima Go and Go Hirano made their debuts in Fuzokukitan, alongside unauthorized reproductions of art by George Quaintance, Tom of Finland, and from beefcake magazines such as Physique Pictorial. Homoerotic photography has also been credited as influencing the genre, with Tamotsu Yat≈ç and Haga Kuro mentioned by Tagame in particular. Multiple magazines that published gay erotic art were founded as gay publishing proliferated in the 1970s and 1980s, including , , MLMW, , Samson, and SM-Z. As gay magazines shifted towards lifestyle content, magazines would often center their erotic content around specific themes or fetishes, such as salarymen or chubby chasers. The art of this period, typified by Sadao Hasegawa, Junichi Yamakawa and Ben Kimura, is noted for its realism and optimism, and for depicting modern rather than historical scenarios. By the 1990s, magazines such as Badi and G-men included editorial coverage of gay pride, club culture, and HIV/AIDS-related topics in addition to gay manga. In contrast to the erotica of Barazoku, gay manga published in G-men was more explicitly pornographic. G-men catered to gay men who preferred \\"macho fantasy\\", as opposed to the sleeker, yaoi-inspired styles popular in the 1980s, and encouraged steady readership by publishing serialized stories which encouraged purchase of every issue. Conversely, Adon removed pornographic material from the magazine entirely; the move was unsuccessful and the magazine folded in 1996. The broader decline of the publishing industry in the 21st century has subsequently impacted gay manga, with the majority of print magazines that publish gay manga having folded: Sabu in 2001, Barazoku in 2004, G-men in 2016, and Badi in 2019. Today, with a lack of viable major print alternatives, most gay manga artists self-publish their works as d≈çjinshi. Genre characteristics muscular man without defined abdominal muscles provides a typical example of a gachimuchi body type. Gay manga is typically categorized based on the body shape of the characters depicted; common designations include , , , and . While the rise of comic anthologies has promoted longer, serialized stories, most gay manga stories are one-shots. The majority of gay manga stories are pornographic, often focusing on sex to the exclusion of plot and character development. Though some gay manga stories include realistic depictions of gay male lives ‚Äì addressing subject material such as coming out, gay pride, and same-sex marriage ‚Äì sex and sexuality is frequently the primary focus. BDSM and non-consensual sex are common themes in gay manga, as well as stories based on relationships structured around age, status, or power dynamics. Often, the older or more senior character uses the younger or subordinate character for sexual purposes, though some gay manga stories subvert this dynamic and show a younger, physically smaller, often white-collar man as the dominant sexual partner to an older, larger, often blue-collar man. As with yaoi, the bottom in gay manga is often depicted as shy, reluctant, or unsure of his sexuality. Consequently, much of the criticism of yaoi ‚Äì misogyny, a focus on rape, the absence of a Western-style gay identity ‚Äì is similarly levied against gay manga. Conversely, some gay manga stories explore romantic, autobiographical, and dramatic subject material, and eschew depictions of sex entirely. A notable example of non- erotic gay manga is My Brother's Husband, the first all-ages manga by Gengoroh Tagame, which focuses on themes of homophobia, cultural difference, and family. Notable creators Gengoroh Tagame is regarded as an influential creator and historian of gay manga. is widely regarded as the most influential creator and historian of gay manga. His works have been cited as a catalyst in shifting fashion and aesthetics among gay men in Japan, away from clean-shaven and slender styles influenced by yaoi and towards a tendency for larger bodies and body hair. Tagame's success as a mangaka proved gay manga's financial viability as a category of manga, and through his work at G-men, he has helped launch the careers of numerous gay manga artists. The majority of Tagame's art features heavy themes of sadomasochism, including rape, torture, and sexual abuse; Tagame's works has been criticized by gay manga writer Susumu Hirosegawa for their focus on violence. , a graphic designer, became the cover artist for G-men in 2001 after Tagame's departure from the magazine.

Formerly an author of sh≈çnen manga, Matsu made his erotic comics debut in Kinnuku-Otoko (\\"Muscleman\\"), a magazine marketed towards both men and women. Matsu's works have been praised for their comedic and light-hearted tone, in contrast to the darker BDSM themes of his peers. is a prolific creator of slash-inspired gay manga, having published d≈çjinshi featuring characters from Attack on Titan, Fate Zero, Final Fantasy, Voltron: Legendary Defender, and numerous other series. Media Japanese publishing Prior to the early 2000s, gay manga was published exclusively in gay general interest magazines. Magazines typically published 8‚Äì24 page one-shots, although some magazines, notably G-men, carried serialized stories. In the late 1990s, several attempts were made at manga anthologies targeted at gay men, though none were successful. In 2003, boys' love (BL) publisher Kousai Shobou began publishing Kinniku-Otoko, a quarterly anthology featuring what the publisher termed \\"muscle BL\\" aimed at a crossover audience of yaoi and gay manga readers (see Crossover with yaoi below). Kinniku-Otoko featured both male and female manga creators, and collected titles as tank≈çbon under the imprint BOYS-L. Kinniku-Otoko and BOYS-L were commercially unsuccessful and folded in 2004. In 2004, G-men parent company Furukawa Shobu published a pair of manga anthologies aimed at gay men, Bakudan (published quarterly) and Gekidan (published bimonthly). Individual titles from these anthologies were collected into tank≈çbon under the Bakudan Comics imprint. Furukawa Shobu later published the anthologies Uragekidan and the BDSM-themed SM Comics Anthology. In 2006, boys' love publisher Aqua Comics (an imprint of ) began publishing the manga anthologies Nikutai Ha (Muscle Aqua), Oaks, and G's Comics. When collected into tank≈çbon, these manga are issued under the same imprint as Aqua's mainstream yaoi books, and bear the same trade dress. Since the release of The Dangerous Games of Dr. Makumakuran by Takeshi Matsu in 2015, no additional gay manga titles have been published by Aqua. , most gay manga is published by individual artists as d≈çjinshi (self-published comics). These books are typically sold digitally through crowdfunding websites such as Pixiv Fanbox and Patreon, or at dedicated gay manga d≈çjinshi conventions such as Yarou Fest. Gay manga anthologies are typically produced by d≈çjin circles rather than professional publishers, as in the case of , an ongoing anthology produced by the Mitsuwa Building Circle. Foreign publishing Many Japanese publishers and creators of gay manga actively seek foreign readers, though in lieu of official licensed translations, gay manga is often pirated and scanlated into English. A scanlation of Kuso Miso Technique, a 1987 one-shot published in Barazoku, has become infamous as an Internet meme. In 2008, Spanish publisher La C√∫pula published an anthology of works by Jiraiya, and manga by Gengoroh Tagame in 2010. In 2011, the Mexican gay magazine Anal Magazine published drawings by Gengoroh Tagame in its second issue. Works by Gengoroh Tagame have additionally been translated into French by H&O; √©ditions. The first gay manga to receive an officially-licensed English-language translation was Standing Ovations, a one-shot by Gengoroh Tagame published in the American erotic comics anthology Thickness (2011‚Äì2012). In 2012, Digital Manga published an English-language translation of Reibun Ike's Hide and Seek, a men's love series originally published by Aqua Comics. In 2013, PictureBox published The Passion of Gengoroh Tagame: Master of Gay Erotic Manga, the first book-length work of gay manga to be published in English. That same year, Massive Goods was founded by Anne Ishii and Graham Kolbeins, two of the editors of The Passion of Gengoroh Tagame, which creates English-language translations of gay manga and products featuring the works of gay manga artists. In December 2014, Fantagraphics and Massive published Massive: Gay Erotic Manga and the Men Who Make It, the first English-language anthology of gay manga. Co-edited by Ishii, Kolbeins, and Chip Kidd, Massive was nominated for an Eisner Award for Best Anthology. From 2014 to 2016, German book publishing house Bruno Gm√ºnder Verlag published works by Tagame, Takeshi Matsu, and Mentaiko Itto in English under their \\"Bruno Gm√ºnder Gay Manga\\" imprint. Video games A number of eroge (erotic games) aimed at a gay male audience and featuring gay manga- inspired artwork have been produced in Japan. Historically, these games have been d≈çjin soft (noncommercial), compared to commercial BL games produced by subsidiaries of bish≈çjo game developers, and have featured gameplay in genres such as visual novels, dating sims, or \\"strip\\" versions of games of skill such as pachinko or checkers. The rise mobile gaming has presented new opportunities for gay eroge; the 2016 mobile gacha game Tokyo Afterschool Summoners is the first large-scale gay game, featuring voice actors and commercially produced character artwork. Anime In contrast to hentai and yaoi, which are regularly adapted from manga to original video animations (OVAs) and ongoing animated series, there have been no anime adaptations of gay manga. This can be owed to the significant financial costs associated with producing animation relative to the niche audience of gay manga, as well as the absence of gay manga magazines producing serialized content that would lend itself to episodic adaptation. Despite this, the increased presence of objectified masculine bodies as fan service in anime beginning in the 2010s has been cited as an example of gay manga's influence on mainstream anime, as in series such as All Out!!, Free!, and Golden Kamuy. Comparison to yaoi Distinction from yaoi is an additional manga genre that focuses on gay male romance and sex. The genre is a distinct category from gay manga, having originated in the 1970s as an offshoot of sh≈çjo manga that was inspired by Barazoku and European cinema. Yaoi has historically been created primarily by women for a primarily female audience, and typically features bish≈çnen who often do not self-identify as gay or bisexual. The genre is often framed as a form of escapist fiction, depicting sex that is free of the patriarchal trappings of heterosexual pornography; yaoi can therefore be understood as a primarily feminist phenomenon, whereas gay manga is an expression of gay male identity. Gay manga does not aim to recreate heteronormative gender roles, as yaoi does with seme and uke dynamics. Crossover with yaoi The early 2000s saw a degree of overlap between yaoi and gay manga in BDSM-themed publications. The yaoi BDSM anthology magazine had several male contributors, while several female yaoi authors have contributed stories to BDSM-themed gay manga anthologies or special issues, occasionally under male pen names. Concurrently, several yaoi publishers commissioned works featuring masculine men, aimed at appealing to an audience of both gay manga and yaoi readers (see Japanese publishing above). Occasionally termed \\"muscle BL\\" or , the subgenre represents a crossover between gay manga and yaoi, with considerable overlap of writers, artists, and art styles. The late 2010s and onwards have seen the increasing popularity of masculine men in yaoi, with growing emphasis on stories featuring larger and more muscular bodies, older characters, and seme and uke characters of physically comparable sizes. A 2017 survey by yaoi publisher Jun√© Manga found that while over 80% of their readership previously preferred bish≈çnen body types exclusively, 65% now enjoy both bish≈çnen and muscular body types. Critics and commentators have noted that this shift in preferences among yaoi readers, and subsequent creation of works that feature characteristics of both yaoi and gay manga, represents a blurring of the distinctions between the genres; anthropologist Thomas Baudinette notes in his fieldwork that gay men in Japan \\"saw no need to sharply disassociate BL from gei komi when discussing their consumption of 'gay media'.\\" See also * Homosexuality in Japan * Gay magazines in Japan * Gay pornography in Japan * Gay video in Japan * Billy Herrington ¬ß Internet meme (Gaichimuchi) * LGBT themes in comics * Pornography in Japan References ;Bibliography * Category:Anime and manga terminology Category:Bear (gay culture) Category:Gay art Category:Gay male pornographic comics Category:Hentai Category:Japanese sex terms Category:LGBT slang Category:LGBT in anime and manga Category:Seinen manga ","title":"Bara (genre)"},{"id":"24141410","text":"Huimin County () is a county of northwestern Shandong province, People's Republic of China.

His father, a merchant with ten children, brought him to Singapore. When his father died in 1930, Man Fong had to work hard to earn a living for his mother and siblings using his skill in painting ads and artwork. However, that was not enough for him. In 1932, he moved to Jakarta, Indonesia. The tension between nationalist groups such as Persagi (Persatuan Ahli-ahli Gambar Indonesia, or Association of Indonesian Draughtsmans) and Indische-Holland kunstkring community stimulated him. In 1942, Man Fong was jailed because of his opposition to Japanese colonialism in Indonesia. After six months in jail, Takahashi Masao helped him gain freedom. This Japanese officer was interested in his artistic potential. In 1946, President Sukarno heard about him when he had his solo exhibition in Jakarta. Sukarno then knew that Man Fong was given a Malino scholarship from Van Mook, the Netherlands lieutenant-governor general. In Europe, many of his exhibitions were successful. He briefly returned to Indonesia, and went back to hold exhibitions from Den Haag to Paris. In 1952 he returned to Jakarta. The visit from Sukarno and Basuki Abdullah, the official palace painter at that time, encouraged him to establish Yin Hua in 1955. Yin Hua was an organization of Chinese painters that had its office on Lokasari Street, Jakarta. Many art exhibitions were organised by Yin Hua. In 1956, Yin Hua was invited to hold exhibitions in China. The relationship between Sukarno and Man Fong improved. His beautiful and perfect works matched with Sukarno's taste. For him, Man Fong's art was an escape from revolutionary spirit. Sukarno didn't have any particular theme preference in art. Only ten percent of all his collections had a nationalist theme. \\"A thing of beauty is a joy forever,\\" was his remark about his taste on art. Therefore, when Basuki Abdullah suggested to him to appoint Man Fong as the next presidential painter, Sukarno agreed to it without hesitance.

She finally died from two nails driven into skull and by beheading. Death After her death, the jailers put Helen's body in a sack and threw it into the Black Sea. However, the sack floated away with what the Turks described as a heavenly light shining on it. According to Orthodox Resources, a light coming from the bottom of the sea alerted a crew of Greek sailors to Helen's resting place. Expecting to find gold, the sailors dove down to the source of the light and found the sack. After they retrieved her remains, a divine revelation showed them to be a source of healing. Helen's body was sent to Russia, but her head was returned to Sinope, where it was venerated in the Church of the Panagia. This relic was said to be a source of miracles, especially for those suffering from headaches. The local priest would bring the relic to the sufferer, chant a canon of supplication, and sprinkle the person with holy water. When the Turkish army drove the ethnic Greek population from Sinope in 1924, the refugees brought the relic with them to Greece.

Facts Allied Business & Financial Consultants Ltd was a small company, with its office above the Charles Dickens pub at 160 Union Street in Southwark. The directors were former Bank of Ireland employees, who had set up the company in 1988, and included Ms O'Donnell and Mr Shanahan who were both directors. Ms O'Donnell had fallen out with the other members allegedly after (among other things) Mr Shanahan had diverted a property investment opportunity - to buy an interest in the fifth floor of Aria House, above the Playhouse Theatre, 23 Craven Street, near Embankment - to one of his own companies. Ms O'Donnell contended that this diversion was a breach of Mr Shanahan's duty as a director to act without any possibility of a conflict of interest, and because Allied Business Ltd could possibly have taken the opportunity, she was in her interests as a member unfairly prejudiced (under Companies Act 1985, section 459, now Companies Act 2006, s 994). She requested that her shares be bought out at a fair value. Judgment High Court Richard Sheldon QC held, based on the old case of Aas v Benham [1891] 2 Ch 244 that the particular opportunity taken up by Mr Shanahan's company fell outside the scope of Allied's business. Therefore, there was no conflict of interest, and no breach of the no profit rule. Court of Appeal Waller LJ, Rimer LJ and Aikens LJ reversed the High Court and allowed the unfair prejudice petition to proceed. In this particular case it was clear that Mr Shanahan had acted without the company's fully informed consent. The opportunity had come to Mr Shanahan in his capacity as a director of Allied Business Ltd, and so must in principle be accountable for any profit. Aas was distinguishable as a case of partnership, where the business relationship had been circumscribed by contract.

It was closed in 1959 when the line was closed to passengers but the track remained used until 1965. After many years as an outdoor activity centre, the building is now a private house. It was located approximately 4 miles and 10 chains along the railway from Ross-on-Wye station.Stanley C Jenkins, The Ross, Monmouth and Pontypool Road Line, revised second edition 2009, Layout The station consisted of a loop and goods siding, two platforms and a stone station building. This building was similar to the stations on the Northampton and Banbury Junction Railway as both lines were constructed by the same engineer, Edward Richards. The name-board on the platform read 'Kerne Bridge' for Goodrich Castle in an attempt to attract more passengers. The second platform and run-round loop was changed into a siding in 1901.

Warmsworth is within the catchment area for Warmsworth Primary School and Sir Thomas Wharton Academy. History Until 1974, Warmsworth was part of the West Riding of Yorkshire, when it then became part of the new county of South Yorkshire. Warmsworth was mentioned in the 11th century Domesday Book, a detailed survey and valuation of all the land held by the King William I and his chief tenants. At this time it was recorded as Wemesford. The name gradually changed to Wormsford, and then to the present day Warmsworth. It has been suggested that \\"ford\\" indicated that it was close to the river's edge, and the \\"Wemes\\" or \\"Worm\\" meant the most sheltered site in that area.A Short History of Warmsworth Retrieved 17 September 2018.

Halden-reaktoren is a research tool for i.a. reactor safety and fuel integrity. IFE has a Human-Centred Technologies section in Halden (Norway) with a special focus on applying augmented and virtual reality technology to meet energy industry needs Institute for Energy Technology (IFE) was established in 1948 as the Institute for Nuclear Energy (IFA). The name was changed in 1980. Its main office is at Kjeller, Norway, and slightly under half of the institute‚Äôs activities are based in Halden. In Halden IFE is host to the international OECD Halden Reactor Project, with 18 member states. IFE conducts research in the following areas: energy, environmental technology, physics, materials science, petroleum technology, nuclear safety and reliability and man-machine systems (man-technology- organisation). IFE operates the only two existing nuclear reactors in Norway. Both are dedicated to research. The JEEP II reactor at Kjeller is used for basic research in physics and material science, as well as production of radiopharmaceuticals. The Halden Reactor is used for research in materials technology and nuclear fuel safety. The Institute has approximately 600 employees in Halden and at Kjeller. The President is Nils Morten Huseby.  History  During the post-war years Norway put strong efforts in the area of nuclear research. Gunnar Randers and Odd Dahl had already started the Norwegian nuclear research activities at the Norwegian Defence Research Establishment (FFI) from 1946, and after World War II this research was separated from the military establishment, with a focus on civil use of nuclear power. Institute for Nuclear Energy (IFA) was established in 1948 as a civil offspring from the Norwegian Defence Research Establishment (FFI) with Gunnar Randers as President until 1970. Norway‚Äôs first nuclear reactor (JEEP) went into operation at Kjeller in 1951. It went critical for the first time June 30, 1951. At this time only the great powers in the world: United States, United Kingdom, France, the Soviet Union and Canada had managed to build and put nuclear reactors in operation. In the 1980s IFE reformed its programme profile. Public financing was reduced, and in line with contemporary neo- liberal trends in society new demands were put on industry research, market adaptation and exposing research more to commercialisation. Research areas that saw a growth in this period included petroleum research, renewable energy, control room technology and man-machine-communication. From the 1990s IFE gained a leading position in Norwegian energy- and environmental research, with focus on hydrogen storage in metal hydrides, environmental technology, energy systems analysis, solar energy and renewable energy systems. In the area of petroleum technology, IFE has expertise in the areas of tracer technology, corrosion inhibition and multiphase flow assurance. In the 2000s IFE has invested in the area of solar cell research. A new solar cell laboratory at Kjeller was opened in 2009, and cost about 50 million NOK, one of the biggest investments made by the Institute.www.ife.no/ife_news The Centre for Environmental Energy Research hosted by IFE will concentrate on the development of silicon-based solar cells.

Operations were called off after a prolonged siege of almost a month though the final preparations for assault had been made. *Operations Vajrashakti in Akshardham Temple - 51 SAG was flown to rescue hostages held by terrorist in Akshardham Temple Gandhinagar. This was the first operation in which two commandos of 51 SAG attained martyrdom. All the militants were killed with no casualties to hostages & damage to the temple. *Operation Trident, Black Tornado and Cyclone ‚Äì Recently held operations to flush out the terrorists and rescue hostages post multiple attacks across Mumbai. Major Sandeep Unnikrishnan & Havaldar Gajender Singh made their supreme sacrifice while combating the terrorists. *Operation Dhangu - The Army justified the deployment of 51 SAG (NSG) in the operation against the six terrorists at the Pathankot airbase, saying that the three service chiefs had taken the call jointly so that the elite combat force could deal with any hostage crisis in the airbase which had around 3,000 family members of IAF personnel and 23 trainees from four foreign countries at the time of the attack. Commander of the Army's Western Command Lt Gen K J Singh said the 51 SAG (NSG) was deployed as it is a force specially trained to deal with a hostage crisis. Apart from family members, 23 trainees from Afghanistan, Nigeria, Sri Lanka and Myanmar were at the airbase when terrorists struck. Singh said the strategic forward airbase of the IAF at Pathankot remained fully functional all through the 'Operation Dhangu', the codename given to the mission to eliminate the terrorists. On January 3, when two terrorists had entered the barracks inside the airbase, six IAF personnel were stuck on the first floor of the building, Lt Gen Singh said. The commandos rappelled down to the building roof, broke the window on the first floor and evacuated IAF men. Thereafter the building was demolished with the help of IEDs to neutralise the terrorists.

N. Shirodkar or Vithal Nagesh Shirodkar (27 April 1899 ‚Äì 1971) was a reputed Indian obstetrician and gynaecologist, hailing from the State of Goa. Biography Shirodkar was born in Shiroda, Goa. After he graduated from Grant Medical College, he went to United Kingdom and obtained his Fellow of the Royal College of Surgeons in 1931. He was associated with Professor J. Chassar Moir, Victor Lack, J.D.Murdoch and others. He returned to India and joined J.J.Group of Hospitals in 1935 as Honorary Obstetrician and Gynecologist. He was an inimitable teacher and innovator. His most widely known contribution is Cervical cerclage the \\"Shirodkar cerclage\\". His other contributions include operations for prolapse repair, tuboplasty and creation of neovagina. He published widely and took a keen interest in social medicine. He was member of the Shantilal Shah Committee on Abortions and also established the Family Planning Association of India. He was honored by the Government of India with Padma Bhushan in 1960 and Padma Vibhushan in 1971. Shirodkar Cerclage A Shirodkar cerclage is very similar to the standard cervical cerclage, but the sutures pass through the walls of the cervix so they're not exposed. This type of cerclage is less common and technically more difficult than a McDonald, and is thought (though not proven) to reduce the risk of infection. The Shirodkar procedure sometimes involves a permanent stitch around the cervix which will not be removed and therefore a Caesarean section will be necessary to deliver the baby. The Shirodkar technique was first described by Dr. V. N. Shirodkar in Bombay in 1955.Jena, S.K., Samal, S., Behera, B.K. and AIIMS, B., 2015. Cervical cerclage in modern obstetrics: A review.

The first designs‚Äîprotected and unprotected‚Äîwere ordered to replace aging sail and steam-powered frigates and corvettes that were of minimal combat value. After several iterations of each type, these cruisers were developed into armored and light cruisers, respectively, over the following decade. All of these ships were built to fill a variety of roles, including scouts for the main battle fleet and colonial cruisers for Germany's overseas empire. The armored cruisers in turn led to the first German battlecruiser, . The protected and unprotected cruisers had been withdrawn from active service by the 1910s, though some continued on in secondary roles. Most of the armored and light cruisers saw action in World War I, in all of the major theaters of the conflict. Their service ranged from commerce raiding patrols on the open ocean to the fleet engagements in the North Sea such as the Battle of Jutland. Many of the ships were sunk in the course of the war, and the majority of the remaining vessels were either seized as war prizes by the victorious Allies, scuttled by their crews in Scapa Flow in 1919, or broken up for scrap. The Treaty of Versailles forced Germany to surrender most of its remaining vessels. Only six old pre- dreadnought battleships and six old light cruisers could be kept on active duty. These ships could be replaced when they reached twenty years of age, and the cruisers were limited to a displacement of .See: Treaty of Versailles Section II: Naval Clauses, Articles 181 and 190 In the 1920s, Germany began a modest program to rebuild its fleet, now renamed the Reichsmarine. It began with the new light cruiser, , in 1921, followed by five more light cruisers and three new heavy cruisers, the . A further five heavy cruisers‚Äîthe ‚Äîwere ordered in the mid-1930s, though only the first three were completed. At the same time, the German navy was renamed the Kriegsmarine. Plan Z, a more ambitious reconstruction program that called for twelve P-class cruisers, was approved in early 1939 but was cancelled before the end of the year following the outbreak of World War II. Of the six heavy cruisers and six light cruisers that were finished, only two survived the war. One, , was sunk following nuclear weapons tests during Operation Crossroads in 1946; the other, , saw service in the Soviet Navy until she was scrapped around 1960. { style=\\"float: right; margin: 0 0 0 1em;\\" |+ Key |-  Armament The number and type of the primary armament |-  Armor The thickness of the deck or belt armor |-  Displacement Ship displacement at full combat load |-  Propulsion Number of shafts, type of propulsion system, and top speed generated |-  Cost Cost of the ship's construction |-  Service The dates work began and finished on the ship and its ultimate fate |-  Laid down The date the keel began to be assembled |-  Commissioned The date the ship was commissioned |} Protected cruisers alt=A large warship with several guns and two tall masts at anchor Starting in the mid-1880s, the German Navy began to modernize its cruising force, which at that time relied on a mixed collection of sail and steam frigates and corvettes. General Leo von Caprivi, then the Chief of the Kaiserliche Marine (Imperial Navy), ordered several new warships, including two s laid down in 1886, the first protected cruisers to be built in Germany. Design work on their successor, , began the following year, though she was not laid down until 1890. Five more ships of the followed in the mid-1890s. These ships, the last protected cruisers built in Germany, provided the basis for the armored cruisers that were built starting at the end of the decade. All of these ships were intended to serve both as fleet scouts and overseas cruisers, since Germany's limited naval budget prevented development of ships optimized for each task. Most of the German protected cruisers served on overseas stations throughout their careers, primarily in the East Asia Squadron in the 1890s and 1900s. participated in the seizure of the Kiautschou Bay concession in November 1897, which was used as the primary base for the East Asia Squadron. Kaiserin Augusta, , and assisted in the suppression of the Boxer Rebellion in China in 1900, and saw action during the Venezuelan crisis of 1902‚Äì03, where she bombarded several Venezuelan fortresses. , Prinzess Wilhelm, and Kaiserin Augusta were relegated to secondary duties in the 1910s, while the Victoria Louise class was used to train naval cadets in the 1900s.

The first of these, the , were laid down in 1886 and 1887. A further six vessels of the , which were improved versions that were larger and faster than their predecessors, followed over the next five years. A final, much larger vessel, , was laid down in 1892; her design was based on contemporary protected cruisers like Kaiserin Augusta. She represented another attempt to merge the colonial cruiser and fleet scout, which was unsuccessful. As a result, the German naval designers began work on the , which provided the basis for all future German light cruisers. All nine cruisers served extensively in Germany's colonies, particularly in Africa and Asia. They participated in the suppression of numerous rebellions, including the Abushiri Revolt in German East Africa in 1889‚Äì1890, the Boxer Rebellion in China in 1900‚Äì1901, and the Sokehs Rebellion in the Caroline Islands in 1911. Most of the ships had been recalled to Germany and decommissioned by the early 1910s, having been replaced by the newer light cruisers. and were scrapped in 1912, but the rest continued on in secondary roles. Of the remaining seven ships, only and remained abroad at the start of World War I in August 1914. Cormoran was stationed in Tsingtao, but her engines were worn out, so she was scuttled to prevent her capture. Geier briefly operated against British shipping in the Pacific before running low on coal. She put into Hawaii, where she was interned by the US Navy.

F√ºrst Bismarck was an improved version of the earlier type, with heavier armament, more extensive armor protection, and a significantly greater size. A further seven units, divided between four different designs, followed over the next ten years; each design provided incremental improvements over earlier vessels. A ninth armored cruiser, , was a much larger vessel representing an intermediate step between armored cruisers and battlecruisers. Indeed, her design had been influenced by the misinformation Britain had released about its s, which were then under construction. Once the characteristics of the new ships were revealed, Germany began building battlecruisers in response. Germany's armored cruisers served in a variety of roles, including overseas as flagships of the East Asia Squadron, and in the fleet reconnaissance forces. All of them, save F√ºrst Bismarck, saw action during World War I in a variety of theaters. Bl√ºcher served with the battlecruisers in the I Scouting Group and was sunk at the Battle of Dogger Bank in 1915, and the two s formed the core of Maximilian von Spee's squadron that defeated the British at the Battle of Coronel in November 1914 before being annihilated at the Battle of the Falkland Islands. was accidentally sunk by a German mine in November 1914 outside Wilhelmshaven, and the two s were sunk in the Baltic Sea.

The ten-ship Gazelle class set the basic pattern, which was gradually improved over successive classes. The introduced more powerful, main guns, and the added a waterline main belt to improve armor protection. Between 1897 and the end of World War I, the German Navy completed forty-seven light cruisers; all of these ships saw service during the war in a variety of theaters and roles. Some, such as and , served as commerce raiders, while others, such as the two s, served with the High Seas Fleet and saw action at the Battle of Jutland in 1916. Several fleet cruiser design studies were prepared in 1916, but no work was begun before the war ended in November 1918. Following the war, the Treaty of Versailles forced Germany to cede all of its most modern light cruisers; only eight Gazelle and s were permitted under the terms of the treaty.See: Treaty of Versailles Section II: Naval Clauses, Article 181 These ships could be replaced after twenty years from the time they were launched, and the first new vessel, , was laid down in 1921. Five more ships of the K√∂nigsberg and es were built between 1926 and 1935. These six cruisers all saw combat during World War II; two, and , were sunk during the invasion of Norway in April 1940. Emden and were destroyed by Allied bombers in the closing months of the war, and was discarded after being badly damaged in a collision with the heavy cruiser .

addition to restricting the number of light cruisers Germany could possess, the Treaty of Versailles also limited the capital ship strength of the new Reichsmarine to six old pre-dreadnought battleships and placed restrictions on the size of replacement ships, with the intent of prohibiting ships more powerful than coastal defense ships from being built. The Reichsmarine responded by designing the ; these heavy cruisers armed with guns were intended to break the naval clauses of Versailles by significantly outgunning the new treaty cruisers being built by Britain and France under the terms of the Washington Naval Treaty, which were limited to guns. If Britain and France agreed to abrogate the naval clauses of the Versailles treaty, Germany would abandon the new cruisers. France rejected the proposal, and so the three Deutschlands were built, and a further two of the D-class were planned, though these were cancelled in favor of a larger derivative, the of fast battleships. When Germany signed the Anglo-German Naval Agreement in 1935, the Reichsmarine was permitted to build five new heavy cruisers‚Äîthe .

Daughter of a clergyman, she studied art, which she later taught. Her interest in history led her into writing. Among her books are six volumes of The Life and Work of the People of England, covering six centuries of English history. She is best known as the author of the book Food in England, which has had a strong influence on many contemporary cooks and food writers. Delia Smith called it \\"A classic book without a worthy successor ‚Äì a must for any keen English cook.\\"Hartley, quoted on the front cover It combines an historical perspective on its subject with the practical approach of an experienced cook. It has remained in print ever since its publication in 1954. Biography Early years Hartley was born at Ermysted's Grammar School, Skipton, Yorkshire, the youngest of three children of the headmaster of the school, the Rev Edward Tomson Hartley (1849‚Äì1923) and his wife, Amy Lucy, n√©e Eddy (1853‚Äì1932).Wondrausch, Mary, \\"Hartley, Dorothy Rosaman (1893‚Äì1985)\\", Oxford Dictionary of National Biography, Oxford University Press, 2004, accessed 31 January 2010 In her 1954 book, Food in England, Hartley gave an autobiographical sketch using the kitchens of her various homes as the background: \\"My first kitchen was a stone-floored cottage in the Yorkshire dales‚Ä¶Fresh mountain air and the smell of cooking always filled this brightly polished kitchen.\\"Hartley, p. 13 She was educated at a convent of French nuns at Skipton until 1904, where, she recalled, \\"the kitchen was alive with stir and bustle, the clatter of clogs and pails, and the aroma of breakfast coffee.\\" In 1904, Edward Hartley retired from the headmastership of the school and became rector of a country parish at Rempstone, Nottinghamshire. Dorothy Hartley recalled, \\"A lovely old house with every mediaeval inconvenience. The nearest shop was five miles away and we had no car. A butcher called once a week, a grocer once a fortnight; and the wine, coal and brewery every six months. With one maid and a weekly washerwoman it was not an easy house to run.\\"Hartley, p. 17 After her secondary education at Loughborough High School Hartley attended Nottingham Art School. During the First World War she temporarily abandoned her studies and worked in a munitions factory. In 1919 she entered the Regent Street Polytechnic in London where she was, according to the Oxford Dictionary of National Biography, a prize pupil. She returned to Nottingham Art School as a teacher in 1920‚Äì22. She continued to teach, in London and elsewhere, for many years. Historical books While earning her living as an art teacher, Hartley began writing in her spare time. She sometimes commented on her lack of education, but as The Times noted, \\"Later achievement suggests she more than made up for it.\\"The Times obituary, 6 November 1985, p. 16 Many of her books are scholarly in nature, and were reviewed favourably by expert critics. Together with Margaret M. Elliot she wrote Life and Work of the People of England, in six volumes, published between 1925 and 1931. In 1930 she published The Old Book, \\"A Mediaeval Anthology Edited and Illuminated by Dorothy Hartley\\" with an introduction by Professor George Saintsbury.Coulter, Cornelia. Review in Speculum, Vol. 7, No. 1, Medieval Academy of America, January 1932, p. 131. In 1931 she \\"collated and edited\\" the poet Thomas Tusser's Good Points of Husbandry\\".\\"Dorothy Hartley\\"' Gale Literary Databases: Contemporary Authors, accessed 31 January 2010 (subscription required) Also in 1931 Hartley published what was, until Food in England in 1954, her best-known book, Medieval Costume and Life. In it she showed the clothes of peasants depicted in old manuscripts, with diagrams to show how they were made, and photographs of models wearing them, one of the models being Hartley herself.McMahon, A. Philip. Review in Parnassus, Volume 4, No. 2, College Art Association, February 1932, pp. 34‚Äì35 In addition to her skill as an illustrator, Hartley was a keen photographer. In 1931 she travelled by car from Egypt to the Congo, taking many photographs which were later exhibited at the Imperial Institute in London. Between 1932 and 1936 she toured the British Isles by bicycle and car, writing weekly articles for The Daily Sketch. Her topics included horse- ploughing, bread making, and clog making. She later used material she had gathered during these trips in her books, Here's England (1934), The Countryman's England (1935), and Made in England (1939). A tour of a slightly different kind was one she made of Ireland, retracing the steps of the mediaeval prelate Giraldus Cambrensis who had accompanied Prince John there in the twelfth century. This led to her book Irish Holiday (1938), of which one reviewer wrote, \\"If you want to see Ireland in extreme and unnecessary discomfort, Irish Holiday will tell you how to do this‚Ä¶my only criticism against an enthralling book.\\"Farrell, M J. \\"Irish Landscape\\", The Observer, 9 October 1938, p 10. Food in England Hartley's mother was from Froncysylltau, near Llangollen in north Wales, where the family owned quarries and property. In 1933 Hartley moved to a house in Froncysylltau, where she lived for the rest of her life. It was there that she began work on the book for which she is best known, Food in England, with its chapters on kitchens, fuels and fireplaces, meat, poultry, game, eggs, mediaeval feast and famine, fish, fungi, Elizabethan households, the New World, salting, drying, preserving, dairy produce, bread, the Industrial Revolution, and \\"sundry household matters\\", all written from the viewpoint of an historian and also a practical and old-fashioned cook. On its publication in 1954, the book was received with immediate acclaim, and has remained in print ever since. The Manchester Guardian called it \\"fascinating‚Ä¶unusually readable\\";The Manchester Guardian, 145 May 1954, p. 5 Harold Nicolson in The Observer said, \\"it will become a classic\\", though he made gentle fun of the combative Englishness of Hartley's culinary pronouncements.Nicolson, Harold, \\"English Fare\\", The Observer, 22 August 1954, p. 7 The Sunday Times, reviewing the seventh edition of the book later wrote, \\"For food scholarship at its best see Dorothy Hartley's robust, idiosyncratic, irresistible Food in England... As packed with diverse and fascinating information as a Scotch bun with fruit, this untidy bundle of erudition is held together by the writer's huge enjoyment of her subject, her immense curiosity about everything to do with the growth, preparation, preservation and eating of food in this country since the Middle Ages.\\"quoted at \\"Dorothy Hartley\\", Gale Literary Databases: Contemporary Authors, reference above. Later years In the post-war years Hartley taught at University College and Goldsmiths' College in London, appeared on television with the chef Philip Harben, and advised on the BBC Archers rustic soap-opera. In 1964 she published Water in England, of which the ODNB writes, \\"This remarkable work is full of valuable information on all manner of related phenomena such as holy springs, well digging, leather jugs, spa hotels, and suchlike.\\" Her last work, \\"The Land of England\\", was published when the author was 86, but as The Times commented, she could \\"still depend on her excellent memory rather than on notes and filing cabinets.\\" The reviewer of The New Yorker wrote, \\"[Her] prose is lucid, demure and unemphatic. Her wit is dry and subtle. She never nudges or buttonholes the reader, but trusts to her material which is almost bewilderingly rich.\\" In her later years she wrote occasionally for The Guardian, on topics including wool and traditional sheep-shearing; the British Museum; \\"funeral biscuits\\"; apple-scoops made from sheep's bones; tame slugs; donkeys; a fourteenth-century feast; and mysterious old culinary terms (such as \\"pestils of pora\\", \\"mortrews\\" and \\"mawney\\").The Manchester Guardian, 28 January 1957, p. 5; 18 July 1957, p. 5; 21 March 1958, p. 5; 12 April 1959, p. 10; and The Guardian, 7 February 1960, p. 8; 11 December 1967; and 22 December 1967, p. 6 Hartley, who remained unmarried, died at Fron House, Froncysylltau, aged 92.

He is currently the Roman Catholic bishop of the Diocese of Trenton, New Jersey, in the United States. Biography Early life and education O'Connell was born in Philadelphia, one of the four sons of Arthur J. and June O'Connell. He was raised in nearby Langhorne, Pennsylvania. Feeling drawn at an early age to the Catholic priesthood, he attended the Vincentian minor seminary, St. Joseph Preparatory High School, in Princeton, New Jersey, and later received a Bachelor of Arts degree in Philosophy from Niagara University in Lewiston, New York, in 1978. He then studied at Mary Immaculate Seminary in Northampton, Pennsylvania, where he earned a Master of Divinity degree (1981) and a Master of Theology degree in Moral Theology (1983). Ordination and ministry O'Connell was ordained a priest of the Congregation of the Mission by Joseph McShea, Bishop of Allentown, on May 29, 1982, in the chapel of the seminary. His first assignment was as a teacher at Archbishop Wood Catholic High School in Warminster, Pennsylvania, where he also served as Director of Student Activities from 1983 to 1985. He continued his studies at The Catholic University of America School of Canon Law in Washington, DC, receiving a Licentiate of Canon Law in 1987. From 1987 to 1990, he was registrar and an assistant professor of canon law, theology, and philosophy at Mary Immaculate Seminary. He earned a doctorate in canon law from the Catholic University in 1990. He also served as an ecclesiastical judge and canonical consultant to the Diocese of Harrisburg (1987‚Äì98), Diocese of Birmingham (1987‚Äì93), and Diocese of Scranton (1988‚Äì98). Between 1990 and 1998, O'Connell served at St. John's University in New York City in various capacities. He was associate dean (1990‚Äì91) before serving as professor of theology and religious studies, academic dean, and dean of faculty (1991‚Äì98). He was also associate vice president from 1995 to 1998, and assistant legal counsel from 1996 to 1998. From 1994 to 1998, he served as Acting Vice President and Dean of Niagara University. Presidency of the Catholic University of America He was the 14th President of the Catholic University of America from 1998 until 2010. He also became a Consultor to the Vatican Congregation for Catholic Education in 2005 and was appointed as John Joseph Keane University Professor of the university in 2006. According to the CUA, \\"He has been a nationally recognized spokesperson for and supporter of Ex Corde Ecclesiae and its full implementation within the Catholic academy.\\" Under O'Connell's tenure, CUA remained under censure by the American Association of University Professors, and O'Connell did not seek to remove this sanction. In 1998 senior members of the Roman Catholic Church in the United States needed to address new requirements from the Vatican for higher education and a requirement that some educators take an oath of fidelity to these teachings. Although many opposed the oath, O'Connell took the oath on the final day of the conference.http://www.encyclopedia.com/doc/1G1-53460466.html Retrieved August 27, 2009. On October 2, 2009 O'Connell announced that he was stepping down as President of the University in August 2010. On June 4, 2010, Pope Benedict XVI named him coadjutor bishop of the Diocese of Trenton. Bishop of Trenton, New Jersey On June 4, 2010, O'Connell was appointed Coadjutor Bishop of the Diocese of Trenton by Pope Benedict XVI. O'Connell received his episcopal consecration on July 30 from John M. Smith, the Bishop of Trenton, with Archbishops John J. Myers and Donald Wuerl serving as co-consecrators, at the Cathedral of St. Mary of the Assumption in Trenton. He chose as his episcopal motto: Ministrare non ministrari, meaning, \\"To serve and not to be served\\" (). As coadjutor bishop, O'Connell automatically succeeded Smith on December 1, 2010, when the Pope accepted the resignation he had already tendered, after reaching the mandatory retirement age of 75. Transparency In August 2012, O'Connell was given records showing that a priest of his diocese, Matthew Riedlinger, had exchanged sexually explicit text messages with and tried to set up a meeting with a person he believed to be a 16-year-old boy. O'Connell removed Riedlinger from the parish where he was serving, but did not inform parishioners of the reason for his removal until a year later, when he was informed that The Star-Ledger would be publishing a story on the matter.

Initially playing in the Southern League, the club joined the Football League in 1920 and has competed in the third tier of English football for most subsequent seasons. By 2009 the club had major financial difficulties but avoided administration on several occasions. History 1906‚Äì1958 Chart of table positions of Southend in the League.Southend United F.C. was formed in 1906 and played in the Southern League until 1920, when they co-founded the Football League's new Third Division; they finished 17th in their first ever season. In 1921, the Third Division was regionalised with Southend United joining the southern section and here they remained until league re-structure in 1958. Southend came close to promotion twice when they finished 3rd in 1932 and 1950, the club's highest league positions until 1991. 1958‚Äì1981 Southend United joined the new national Third Division in 1958, where they remained until 1966 when they suffered their first ever relegation, into the Fourth Division. The club had to wait six seasons until 1972 to experience the club's first ever promotion as runners-up behind Grimsby Town. In 1976 Southend suffered relegation again before taking another runners-up spot behind Watford in 1978. Another relegation in 1980 was directly followed by one of the most successful seasons in the club's history as they won the Fourth Division Championship in 1981, breaking a series of club records in the process. Despite success on the pitch and low admission prices, the club's gates were low and condemned as \\"a bad reflection on the town\\". 1981‚Äì1987 Many of Southend United's most gifted players were sold due to a financial strain. In June 1983 Anton Johnson, a local butcher who was also chairman of Rotherham United, bought 44.9% of the club from the Rubin brothers. The club was already ¬£250,000 in debt. By August 1983 Dave Smith had been replaced as manager by Peter Morris who lasted until February 1984. On his arrival, Morris discovered that he had a squad of only ten players. Bobby Moore was installed as chief executive with Andrew MacHutcheon as chairman. The club were relegated into the Fourth Division in 1984 with Bobby Moore as manager. One of the club's darkest hours saw a season average attendance of barely above 2,000. Vic Jobson was elected as a director in the 1984 close- season, only to be forced out, along with MacHutcheon, months later. On the pitch, the team finished in 20th place, narrowly avoiding the need to seek re- election to the Football League. Johnson was arrested on 23 October 1984. Two weeks before Christmas, fans discovered that ¬£70,000 of the club's Christmas savings scheme had gone missing. While the fraud squad investigated, Robert Maxwell and Ken Bates stepped in, at Jobson's request, to lend the necessary money to the club to repay its Christmas savers. The club was now over ¬£800,000 in debt. Johnson was banned by the FA from any future involvement in football, having simultaneously been in control of Southend, Rotherham and Bournemouth. Johnson was cleared of all charges at Chelmsford Crown Court and has never received the monies he personally invested in the misplaced Christmas fund and lost his shares in a further court case to the SUFC board. Over a decade later, Ceefax reported that Johnson was seeking to take over Doncaster Rovers. 1987‚Äì1992 Promotion in 1987 was the beginning of a golden era for Southend United. Relegation in 1989 was a mere blip as two successive promotions in 1990 and 1991 saw Southend United become \\"full members\\" of the Football League for the first time in the club's history, and in 1992 Southend United finished 12th in the old Second Division, their highest ever position in the Football League to date. On New Year's Day, 1992, the club briefly topped the Second Division but their dreary late season form stopped any hopes of a unique third successive promotion that would have given them a place as a Premier League founder member. Manager David Webb then stepped down. 1992‚Äì2003 Southend United were managed by Colin Murphy, Barry Fry and then Peter Taylor over the next three seasons. In 1995, former Liverpool player Ronnie Whelan agreed to become player-manager, and Southend finished 14th in Division One in his first season as a manager, a year later the club suffered relegation after finishing bottom of Division One. Ronnie Whelan left the club, claiming a lack of support from the fans and a lack of money from the chairman. Subsequently, Whelan won a case for wrongful dismissal. Alvin Martin was named Whelan's replacement. Martin was unable to avoid a second consecutive relegation which Southend once again finishing bottom of the table and were duly relegated to Division Three. First team regulars Simon Royce, Jeroen Boere, Andy Thomson and Andy Rammell all left the club and were replaced by Martyn Margetson, Mark Beard, Mark Stimson and Rob Newman. Alvin Martin left in April 1999, with Southend fifth from bottom in the Football League. Alan Little took charge of his first game away to Leyton Orient, a game Southend lost 3‚Äì0. Alan Little, who had previously managed York City, signed former York City players Mark Tinkler and Martin Curruthers. With limited success gates were barely getting above the 3,000 mark and a crowd of only 2,403 showed up to watch the game against Kidderminster and Alan Little's reign had come to an end. David Webb left Yeovil Town and was appointed the new manager, signing players Darryl Flahavan, Leon Cort, Tes Bramble and Mark Rawle. During the season David Webb became ill and Rob Newman took temporary charge, being appointed permanently when Webb quit the club. Southend suffered straight defeats to Lincoln, Swansea, Kidderminster and Hartlepool, and Newman was dismissed shortly after. Steve Wignall took over as manager and signed Drewe Broughton, Mark Gower, Mark Warren and Che Wilson. He released goalkeeper Darryl Flahavan after he deemed him too small to play in the League, but re-signed him after a poor run of results. Two more defeats followed and Wignall was sacked. In late 2003 former Southend United midfielder Steve Tilson was appointed manager and named former Leyton Orient boss Paul Brush as his assistant. 2003‚Äì2006 Southend reached their first ever national cup final in 2004 when they met Blackpool in the final of the LDV Vans Trophy at the Millennium Stadium in Cardiff. Over 20,000 Southend fans travelled, but the team did not rise to the occasion and Blackpool won 2‚Äì0. In 2004 Tilson and Brush were installed as a permanent management / coaching duo and led Southend to promotion to League 1 in 2005, while making a second successive appearance in the Football League Trophy final, which the Shrimpers lost 2‚Äì0 to Wrexham, but the third appearance at the Millennium Stadium in the League Two play-off final against Lincoln City brought success as Freddy Eastwood and Duncan Jupp scored the goals that gave the club their first ever taste of promotion via the play-off system and their first major piece of silverware since 1981. 2006‚Äì2007 On 29 April 2006 the Shrimpers were promoted to the Football League Championship after a 2‚Äì2 draw with Swansea City at the Welsh club's new Liberty Stadium. Southend were crowned League One champions on 6 May 2006 after beating Bristol City 1‚Äì0 at Roots Hall in front of over 11,000 fans. This was the last professional appearance of Shaun Goater; fans from his former club Manchester City came to give him a special send-off at the end of a long and distinguished career. For Southend United, the title was the club's first in 25 years. On 6 May 2006 Tilson was named as the League Manager Association's Manager-of-the-Season for League One. Southend started the 2006‚Äì07 season reasonably well, beating Stoke City 1‚Äì0 on the opening day and a few games later Sunderland 3‚Äì1. Southend then did not win a league game for 18 games until 9 December 2006 when they beat Southampton 2‚Äì1 and West Bromwich Albion 3‚Äì1. On New Year's Day 2007, Southend picked up their first away victory of the season over Cardiff City, followed by a 3‚Äì1 victory away to Birmingham City on 31 January 2007 which lifted the Shrimpers from the bottom of the division on goal difference. On 9 February 2007 the Shrimpers defeated Queens Park Rangers 5‚Äì0 ‚Äì a disastrous return for Southend's former goalkeeper Simon Royce. Southend escaped the relegation zone on 13 March 2007 when the Blues gained a 1‚Äì0 victory over Burnley. But after a 3‚Äì0 home defeat to rivals Colchester and only 10 league wins in the season, the Shrimpers were relegated back to League One. On their return to League One Southend had bolstered their squad, adding Striker Charlie MacDonald, Winger Tommy Black and centre midfielder Nicky Bailey to their ranks. Despite the sale of Freddy Eastwood, Southend finished sixth in League One at the end of 2007‚Äì08 much to the thanks Lee Barnard, a January signing from Tottenham Hotspur, scoring 9 goals in 13 games, thus qualifying for a play-off place against Doncaster Rovers. Southend drew the home leg 0‚Äì0, but lost the second leg 5‚Äì1. Following the play off defeat to Doncaster Rovers manager Steve Tilson began a mass summer clear out when Goalkeeper Steve Collis, Defender Lewis Hunt, Winger Tommy Black and club captain and loyal servant for over 10 years Kevin Maher were all released. Forwards Matt Harrold, Charlie MacDonald, Gary Hooper and Richie Foran were transfer listed. Darryl Flahavan and Mark Gower both turned down new contracts to sign for Championship sides Crystal Palace and Swansea City respectively. Simon Francis, Peter Clarke and Nicky Bailey were also later placed on the transfer list after failing to agree new contracts at the club. Francis later agreed and signed a new two-year deal. Bailey was being chased by Championship side Charlton Athletic, Bailey put in a man of the match display on Southend's opening game of the season against Peterborough United which was being watched by the London club, the game proved to be Bailey's last for Southend and signed for Charlton 3 days later for ¬£500,000 which could rise to ¬£750,000. Peter Clarke remained on the transfer list for the entire season stating that he \\"never wanted to leave and never asked to be transfer listed\\" but wanted to concentrate on his football and discuss his future at the end of the season. 2008‚Äì2010 Southend pulled off the shock of the summer transfer market with the deadline day signing of Crystal Palace legend Dougie Freedman, the Scotsman signed a two- year contract at Roots Hall just minutes before the window shut. Manager Steve Tilson was delighted to bring Freedman to Roots Hall adding some much needed experience to Southend's forward line, something The Blues had been without since the retirement of Shaun Goater. Tilson also signed goalkeeper Steve Mildenhall from Yeovil Town as his new number one following the departure of Darryl Flahavan and the shot stopper has become a firm favourite with the Southend fans. With Kevin Maher's departure Adam Barrett was officially named new club captain. Southend ended the season well with a run of just one defeat in nine games in February and March, that form was much down to two loan signings. Theo Robinson, a striker who signed until the end of the season from Championship side Watford and France U21 centre back Dorian Dervite signed from Tottenham Hotspur also until the end of the season and were both influential in Southend's late surge up the League One table. Despite this good form Southend unfortunately just missed out on a play off place with an eighth-place finish. Peter Clarke, who had remained on the transfer list for the entire season won the club's player of the season award before leaving the club and signed a three-year deal with League One rivals Huddersfield Town. Clarke admitted that he was leaving with a heavy heart and his time at Southend at been an enjoyable one, thanking the fans and management for their support.Southend United News Latest Latest CLARKE LEAVES WITH A HEAVY HEART Southend made four loan signings before the start of 2009‚Äì10 season with the signing of Colchester United defensive duo Matt Heath and John White both signed on initial one month deals. Chelsea teenager Lee Sawyer returned to the club for a six-month spell, the midfielder enjoyed a three-month spell at Roots Hall the previous season. Sunderland's French defender Jean-Yves M'Voto also signed until the turn of the year. In Southend's opening four games of the season they picked up four consecutive draws, an opening day 2‚Äì2 against Huddersfield Town despite Lee Barnard and Franck Moussa giving the Blues a 2‚Äì0 lead. Southend followed that up with another 2‚Äì2, this time away at Walsall and then again on their travels at Wycombe Wanderers, Jean Francois Christophe levelled the scores in a 1‚Äì1 draw. A goalless draw with Millwall followed. Southend's first win of the season came in the First round of the League Cup against Cheltenham Town on 15 August 2009 Lee Barnard scored twice in a 2‚Äì1 win. That win in the League Cup set up a second round tie away against Premier League side Hull City, Tom Cairney and Jozy Altidore gave Hull a 2‚Äì0 lead but Franck Moussa pulled a goal back for Southend with an impressive volley from the edge of the area. Southend created chance after chance with Lee Barnard, Dougie Freedman and Anthony Grant all thwarted by Tony Warner in the Hull goal, Southend were caught on the break pushing for an equaliser and ended up conceding a third when Geovanni scored with seven minutes to play. Southend once again gave a good account of themselves against Premiership opposition. Southend picked up their first victory of the season on 4 September 2009 at home to Leyton Orient, Southend won the game 3‚Äì0 with Lee Barnard scoring his first professional hat trick. Lee Barnard continued his fine form in front of goal with a number of braces against Walsall, Stockport, Bristol Rovers and Hartlepool. On 26 December 2009 Barnard scored his last goal for Southend in the Essex derby, it was not enough to prevent Southend falling to a 2‚Äì1 defeat. Barnard was reluctantly sold to Southampton on 22 January 2010 after an impressive 17 goals from 27 games in all competitions. Southend signed Southampton striker Matt Paterson as part of the deal. Southend began life after Barnard with a home game against Wycombe Wanderers on 23 January 2010 which ended in a 1‚Äì1 stalemate. On 30 January Southend made an awful start in a game against Swindon Town finding themselves 2‚Äì0 down after just 7 minutes, Southend showed great fighting spirit and scored two goals in the final 3 minutes, Scott Spencer and Pat Baldwin earning The Blues a share of the spoils. Southend lost out in the Essex derby, falling to a 2‚Äì0 defeat. On 6 March 2010 Southend lost 3‚Äì0 against Hartlepool with former Southend loanee Roy O'Donovan scoring a hat trick, the result also saw the club fall into the relegation zone for the first time in the season. On 8 March 2010 assistant manager Paul Brush was dismissed after six and a half years with the club, Steve Tilson expressed his disappointment of the decision stating 'I've not only lost my partner, but I've lost my best friend'. The following day former manager David Webb was installed as Steve Tilson's new assistant. Webb stated that his role is only until the end of the 2009/10 season. A dismal run of just one win in 2010 left Southend deep in trouble at the wrong end of the table, relegation was confirmed on 24 April 2010 away to Oldham despite twice coming from behind to earn a 2‚Äì2 draw it was not enough and Southend's fate was sealed. Southend were relegated to League Two following a 2‚Äì2 draw with Oldham Athletic and with League Two having a salary cap that would mean the high earners at the club leaving. Player of the season Simon Francis and goalkeeper Steve Mildenhall were placed on the transfer list, Francis was given permission to speak to League One side Brentford but he failed to agree terms. Winger Damian Scannell turned down a new deal to sign a two-year deal with Dagenham & Redbridge. Club captain Adam Barrett and vice captain Alan McCormack both had their contracts terminated by mutual consent. Barrett stated he was sad to be leaving as he was and always will be a follower of the club but the club's problems off the field with late payment of wages throughout the season were too much to take for him and his young family. He also stated he would like to return to the club in some capacity one day but with the current state of affairs he felt it was time to move on. McCormack made a short switch to London signing a two-year contract with Charlton Athletic, Addicks boss Phil Parkinson admitted he had been a long term admirer of the Irishman. Barrett later joined Championship side Crystal Palace where he linked up with former Southend coach Dean Austin and former Southend striker Dougie Freedman who is now assistant manager at Selhurst Park. On 4 July 2010 manager Steve Tilson was put on gardening leave, ending his seven- year stint as manager. Chairman Ron Martin stated that he didn't see the fight from the players or the manager. Cup successes V. Manchester United Southend beat Leeds United in the third round of the League Cup and the draw for the fourth round set up a home tie against trophy holders and Premier League Champions Manchester United on 7 November 2006. The away side fielded a strong team, which included 10 players capped at international level. Cristiano Ronaldo and Wayne Rooney were amongst the starting line up, along with Gabriel Heinze, Darren Fletcher, Wes Brown and Alan Smith. Southend had injuries to strikers Billy Paynter and Lee Bradbury while Matt Harrold was cup tied so boss Steve Tilson partnered Gary Hooper up front with Freddy Eastwood. After 25 minutes Jamal Campbell-Ryce was fouled by David Jones 30 yards from goal, Kevin Maher, Steven Hammell and Freddy Eastwood stood over the free kick, Eastwood curled \\"a wonderful free-kick around the wall and into the top corner past Tomasz Kuszczak\\" as the BBC reported. Southend held on for one of the most famous victories in the club's history. Since this was the only meeting between the two sides to date, Southend are one of the only sides to have a 100% record against the Red Devils (along with Zenit St Petersburg, Vasco de Gama and Bootle Reserves). The latter defeated Newton Heath, the original name of Manchester United, in the 1890/91 FA Cup 2nd qualifying round. V. Tottenham Hotspur On Wednesday 20 December 2006 Southend travelled to White Hart Lane to face Tottenham Hotspur in the quarter final of the League Cup, Southend put in a brave performance and with neither goalkeeper really tested the game went to extra time. Jermain Defoe scored the only goal of the game in the 119th minute which video replays showed was in fact offside. Darryl Flahavan, Kevin Maher and Alan McCormack all urged the referee to watch the replay on the scoreboard to show the goal should not stand but their appeals fell on deaf ears and were all booked for their protests. After seeing off Barnsley in the FA Cup Southend were once again drawn away to Spurs on 27 January 2007. Robbie Keane gave the hosts the lead after 13 minutes which looked to be the start of a rout, Southend defended well and were able to see out the half still only the one goal down. Jermaine Jenas added a 2nd for Spurs shortly after the interval. Southend were given a life line and a route back into the game when a Matt Harrold shot was handled in the area by Hossam Ghaly, Freddy Eastwood stepped up to take the spot kick and confidently sent Radek Cerny the wrong way. Southend's hopes of an unlikely comeback were put to bed just 5 minutes later when Mido restored Spurs 2 goal advantage. Gary Hooper had a good chance to pull a goal back for Southend in injury time after lifting the ball over the goalkeeper but also over the crossbar. V. Chelsea Southend on the attack at Stamford Bridge. On 3 January 2009, Southend drew 1‚Äì1 against Chelsea at Stamford Bridge in the third round of the FA Cup. Chelsea included Frank Lampard, Joe Cole and Didier Drogba in their starting line up. The Premiership side had the best of the opening exchanges and had a great chance to take the lead when Didier Drogba was one-on-one with goalkeeper Steve Mildenhall before Osei Sankofa slid in to take the ball off Drogba's toes as he was winding up the shot. Southend's resistance was broken just passed the half hour mark when Salomon Kalou headed in from a Frank Lampard corner. Drogba could have extended Chelsea's lead before the interval but Steve Mildenhall saved. Peter Clarke nearly drew Southend level with 10 minutes remaining after seeing his header come back off the bar, Clarke was not to be denied a second time and in the 1st minute of injury time a Johnny Herd long throw was directed by Ricardo Carvalho straight into the path of Clarke who headed in the equaliser on his 27th birthday. Southend players during the warm up prior to the replay. The replay was scheduled for 14 January 2009 but was called off by the referee, Chris Foy, who had made the decision due to poor visibility caused by fog. Mr. Foy then reversed his decision after the fog suddenly lifted and visibility improved and the game went ahead but kick off was delayed by 15 minutes. Southend's Alan McCormack missed the replay through suspension after picking up his fifth yellow card of the season at Stamford Bridge. The suspension would have been in effect for Southend's home game against Crewe Alexandra which had been expected to take place on 10 January 2009 but fell foul of the weather. Chelsea won 4‚Äì1. HMRC and administration fears In October 2009 Southend faced a winding up order from HM Revenue & Customs over an unpaid tax bill of ¬£690,000. The club were also hit with a transfer embargo, this left Steve Tilson with just 12 fit professionals due to injuries and suspensions to his already threadbare squad. George Friend, who was on loan with Southend from Wolves before the embargo was in place, was unable to have his loan extended, despite an agreement between the two clubs for the left back to stay at Roots Hall. On 27 October 2009 Southend avoided the prospect of a winding up order but the club could still have fallen into administration, acquiring an automatic 10 point deduction so every point on the field was vital. Southend beat Gillingham 1‚Äì0 on 30 October with Lee Barnard scoring the winning goal in the 3rd minute of injury time. Southend avoided going into administration on 9 November having paid the outstanding tax bill of ¬£2.135 million on 6 November. On 12 December 2009 the transfer embargo was lifted. On 10 February 2010 Southend were back in court for another unpaid tax bill, this time ¬£205,000. Southend chairman Ron Martin claimed that he was refusing to pay because the initial tax bill of ¬£2.1 million was overpaid, the winding up petition was adjourned for 28 days. On 9 March 2010 Southend confirmed that the players had not yet been paid for and February and the PFA had to pay the players for January, the club were placed under another transfer embargo until they paid the money back. On 10 March 2010 Southend were given a 35-day extension to pay the unpaid bill or face administration. On 14 April 2010, Southend were granted a final seven days to pay the outstanding bill. On 20 April 2010 the fee of ¬£378,500 was paid. On 2 August 2010 all cases against Southend United were dropped and an agreement was reached with HMRC. Southend's transfer embargo was lifted later that week. 2010‚Äì13 On 5 July 2010 former Sheffield Wednesday and Plymouth Argyle manager, Paul Sturrock was announced as the new manager with Tommy Widdrington as his assistant. Sturrock's first signings for Southend were former Northampton Town left back Peter Gilbert and striker Barry Corr who was released by Exeter City. Both players had played under Sturrock previously. Southend being under a transfer embargo both players could only sign pre contract agreements. A squad of 17 players were only registered in time to play on the eve of the new season as the club's transfer embargo was lifted. Sturrock led Southend to a respectable 13th-placed finish in his first season. The club mounted a more serious challenge the following season, spending 11 weeks at the top of League 2, owing to the goals and form of Ryan Hall, Kane Ferdinand and Liam Dickinson. A subsequent decline in form meant the team had to enter the play- offs after finishing the season in 4th place with 83 points, a total that in any other year in League 2, would have won the league. Southend lost the play off semi-final against Crewe Alexandra 3‚Äì2 on aggregate. Southend United at Wembley A transfer embargo at the start of the 2012‚Äì13 season meant that the club started its campaign with a depleted squad. The loan signing of Britt Assombalonga from Watford proved a success as the youngster scored 12 goals in 18 appearances. Blues went on a run of 14 games unbeaten which saw them reach 4th in the table. At the turn of the year Southend's form dramatically dropped, although the club reached its first ever Wembley cup final in the Football League Trophy. Paul Sturrock was sacked 2 weeks before the cup final but was controversially asked to manage the team for the final. Sturrock refused and watched the game from the stand. The Blues took a record 33,000 fans to the match, but lost 2‚Äì0 to Crewe Alexandra. Phil Brown was brought in as Sturrock's successor but picked up just one win in his eight games in charge as Southend finished the season in 11th position, with only six league wins at Roots Hall all season, a worse home record than Barnet and Aldershot who were relegated. 2013‚Äìpresent Brown brought in former Darlington Manager Dave Penney as his assistant, whilst retaining Graham Coughlan as first team coach. Bob Shaw was also brought in as Head of Scouting and Recruitment. Brown's first summer signing was full back John White who had been released from neighbours Colchester United. He also signed former Hull City winger Will Atkinson who had left Bradford City. In 2015 Phil Brown led the team after a thrilling play-off final against Wycombe Wanderers (7:6 on Penalties) into League One. At the end of the 2016/2017 season the club missed the play-offs for the Championship by only one point. 2019-2020 financial difficulties Financial difficulties, including a winding-up petition set to be heard on 22 January 2020, resulted in non-payment of players' and other employees' wages in December 2019, after which players consulted with the Professional Footballers Association. At this point (9 January 2020), Southend were 22nd in League One, 15 points from safety after winning only one of 24 league games. References Category:Southend United F.C.

The origin of the term itself is debated: one theory regards it as deriving from Arabic mijlab (\\"whip\\"), while another from Latin manus (\\"hand\\") and clava (\\"cudgel\\"). History The manglabitai first appear in the 9th century, when, along with the imperial Hetaireia, they were responsible for the personal safety of the emperor. Armed with swords, the manglabitai preceded him in ceremonies and were responsible for the unlocking of certain gates of the imperial palace, the Great Palace of Constantinople every morning. Structure The individual manglabitƒìs was of relatively lowly origin and status, often even illiterate, but their commander, known as pr≈çtomanglabitƒìs (œÄœÅœâœÑŒøŒºŒ±Œ≥Œ≥ŒªŒ±Œ≤ŒØœÑŒ∑œÇ, \\"first manglabitƒìs\\") or epi tou manglabiou (, \\"in charge of the manglabion\\"), ranked high in the imperial hierarchy due to his proximity to the emperor. The manglabitai as an imperial bodyguard appear to have disappeared by the late 11th century, but there is sigillographic evidence for \\"manglabitai of the Great Church\\" (i.e. the Patriarchate of Constantinople) from the 11th through the 13th centuries. Notable members The perhaps most famous manglabitƒìs was the Norwegian king Harald Hardrada, who received the title in recognition of his services in the Varangian Guard in the 1030s.

It is 169 km long. History The Kingdom of Sardinia (Savoy) had started building railways late compared to other European countries and decided after much discussion that the Turin‚ÄìGenoa railway would be built at state expense. The route of the line was defined by a government engineer, Luigi Ranco in 1844. Work began on 13 February 1845 and was completed on 18 December 1853. In order to cross of the Apennines the 3,259 metre-long Giovi Tunnel was built, which at the time was the longest in the world. The whole line was built with double-track and had over thirty substantial bridges and long tunnels. It was progressively opened as track was completed, even before the completion of stations or the second track. Torino Porta Nuova‚ÄìTrofarello  The first leg, only 13 kilometres long from Torino Porta Nuova (which had not yet been built) to Trofarello, was opened on 24 September 1848 with a simple ceremony. Regular public service began the next day with six pairs of trains traveling between 7 am and 7 pm. Already this section required the building of the first important work with a long bridge over the Po River next to the Moncalieri station. Trofarello‚ÄìAsti  The second section of the line to Asti was 42 kilometres long, and was opened on 15 November 1849. This part of the line overcame major difficulties crossing the hills between San Paolo Solbrito and Villafranca where it had to climb a grade of 2.6 percent, then considered nearly impossible for trains to climb. Initially a temporary line was built between San Paolo and Dusino, with a connection from Dusino to Stenevasso provided by a horse-drawn bus. This system was unsuccessful and it was decided to purchase a locomotive from Robert Stephenson designed for the climb. This was built at his workshop in Newcastle upon Tyne and went into service in August 1851. Asti‚ÄìAlessandria‚ÄìNovi‚ÄìArquata  On 1 January 1850 the 22 km section was opened to Alessandria and Novi Ligure and on 10 February 1852 the 56 km to Arquata was opened; the railway now reached 124 kilometres from Turin. This route provided no major difficulties except for the bridges near Serravalle Scrivia. The rail service proved to be satisfactory to the public, with the train taking only 3 hours and 40 minutes to cover the whole route, leading to improved profits for the company. Arquata‚ÄìBusalla‚ÄìGenoa  This section required large engineering works. The 18 kilometre extension to Busalla was opened on 10 February 1853 and required the building of eight bridges and four tunnels of lengths varying from 508 to 866 metres. On 18 December 1853 the line was completed with the opening of the last 23 kilometers between Busalla and Genova Piazza Principe station. The crossing of the Apennine was particularly difficult, especially the Giovi Tunnel, which was the longest in the world and particularly expensive to build. The route also required traction to cope with the long and steep gradient between Busalla and Pontedecimo. A group of engineers, including Henri Maus and Germain Sommeiller, studied new types of locomotives, also built by the Stephenson workshops, then known as the Mastodons of Giovi which consisted of two locomotives coupled back-to-back under the control of one driver and capable of hauling trains on the slope of 3.6 percent, which could not be matched by any other locomotive. They were able to haul trains of 150 tons at 12 kilometres per hour. To avoid delaying the opening of the line, Piazza Principe station was opened as a temporary station, as had already happened at Torino Porta Nuova station and at other locations on the line. Opening of the line between Principe and Sampierdarena in 1854 Since the new railway had a crucial role in moving both freight and passengers to and from the port a connection was built between Piazza Principe station and the port at Piazza Caricamento, almost entirely at grade along the road now called Via Gramsci. The line was opened to traffic on 18 December 1853 and on 20 February 1854 it was officially opened in the presence of King Victor Emmanuel and Prime Minister Cavour, who had both arrived on the royal train. The Archbishop of Genoa basptised three locomotives during the ceremony. Genoa Piazza Principe‚ÄìGenoa Brignole  In 1865 the line was absorbed into the new Upper Italian Railway Company (Italian: Societ√† per le strade ferrate dell'Alta Italia). The line became part of the Mediterranean Network (Italian: Rete Mediterranea) in 1885 and part of Ferrovie dello Stato in 1905. On 25 July 1872 a tunnel was opened linking the two main stations in Genoa between Piazza Principe and Brignole, connecting with the line to Pisa and Rome, increasing the length of the Turin‚ÄìGenoa line to its current 169 kilometres. Second Pass Because of the early industrialisation of Turin and despite the difficulty of operating the line and the confined docks of Genoa, the line immediately became the busiest railway in Italy. On 15 May 1889 an alternative 24 kilometre-long line through the Giovi pass opened from Quadrivio Torbella (Rivarolo Canavese) to Ronco Scrivia, known as the Second Pass (Italian: secondo valico). The new line was needed to meet the significant increase in demand for freight transport to and from the port of Genoa. The route of the line is close to the original line, but it is much faster and safer because it presents fewer problems for traction and braking because of its much lower gradients. This was made possible by bridges and especially by the 8,294 metre-long Ronco Tunnel. In 1922 it was enhanced further by duplication from Ronco to Arquata, where the line to Milan via Tortona connects. The Giovi disaster On 11 August 1898 there was a rail disaster between the stations Pontedecimo and Busalla stations. A freight train lost its driver in the long Giovi Tunnel and crashed at high speed into a passenger train stopped at Piano Orizzontale dei Giovi station waiting for a train from Busalla to pass before continuing. Thirteen people were killed and twenty were wounded. Apparently the train crew was suffocated by smoke, and the driver fell from his cabin, leaving the train out of control. At that time steam locomotives were fired with cheap coal briquettes produced by a mixture of pitch, tar and coal dust, which gave off poisonous fumes and forced train crews to cover their mouth and nose with soaked bandages in the long tunnels. After passing through the Giovi Tunnel (taking nine minutes uphill and eleven minutes downhill), drivers were given a glass of milk in order to detoxify. Electrification of the line began to be considered following the accident. Electrification As a result of the Giovi disaster of 1898 and the saturation of traffic on both lines through the Giovi pass‚Äîas steam powered trains could not carry more than 2000 wagons per day in 1907‚Äîand given the excellent results obtained from the trial of three-phase power on the lines in Valtellina electrification was initiated on the line at 3,300 V AC three-phase at 15 Hz. On 1 August 1910 electrification was activated from Pontedecimo to Busalla; on 1 December 1911 the section to Rivarolo Ligure Junction was electrified; on 1 November 1913 the section to Genoa Sampierdarena was electrified; on 21 June 1915 the section between Busalla and Ronco was electrified and finally on 15 May 1916 the project was completed with the electrification of the Genova Piazza Principe station. Trains on the line were hauled by Class E550 locomotives. In 1924 the electrification of the line was completed with the activation of the long section from Ronco Scrivia to Turin Porta Nuova. Between 1961 and 1964 the line was one of the last to be converted to 3,000 V DC electrification, although it had been one of the first to be electrified with three-phase power. The line today In 1963 the new Granarolo Tunnel was opened, which allowed the direct connection of the station Genova Piazza Principe from the Giovi second pass, skipping the busy junctions around Sampierdarena, significantly reducing the time taken by long-distance trains. In 1994 the line was devastated near Alessandria by the flooding of the Tanaro. Today, the passenger traffic is served by Trenitalia with regional, InterCity, InterCity Night Express and Eurostar InterCity trains. A new high-speed line is proposed between Milan and Genoa, which would include a third line through the Giovi pass, allowing the full separation of servicers with local passenger services on the original line, freight on the second pass and long-distance passenger services on the new line (third pass).

In July 2020 Tooley was appointed as the new Vice-Chancellor of the University of Buckingham, succeeding Sir Anthony Seldon from 1 October 2020. Early life Tooley's family moved to Bristol where he was educated at Kingsfield School, Kingswood. The school was burnt to the ground during his time there.  Career background  Tooley holds a PhD from the Institute of Education, University of London, an MSc from the Science Policy Research Unit, University of Sussex, and first class BSc honours in Logic and Mathematics, also from the University of Sussex. He began his career as a mathematics teacher in Zimbabwe (1983 to 1986), before moving to the National Foundation for Educational Research in England in 1988. He held short-term appointments at Simon Fraser University, Canada, and the University of the Western Cape, South Africa, while completing his PhD. His first post-doctoral position was with the University of Oxford's Department of Educational Studies, under Professor Richard Pring. From Oxford he moved to the University of Manchester in 1995; at the same time he also created the Education and Training Unit at the Institute of Economic Affairs in London. Tooly was professor at the University of Newcastle upon Tyne, where he directed the E. G. West Centre.http://www.jamestooley.net For his research on private education for the poor in India, China and Africa, Tooley was awarded the gold prize in the first International Finance Corporation/Financial Times Private Sector Development Competition in September 2006. From 2007 to 2009, he was founding President of the Education Fund, Orient Global, and lived in Hyderabad, India. He is currently chairman of education companies in Ghana (Omega Schools Franchise Ltd) and India (Empathy Learning Systems Pvt Ltd) creating low cost chains of low cost private schools. He also holds an appointment as an Adjunct Scholar at the Cato Institute and serves on the Advisory Council of the Institute of Economic Affairs as well as on the Academic Advisory Council of Civitas: The Institute for the Study of Civil Society. He also serves on the Board of Visitors of Ralston College, a start-up liberal arts college in Savannah.  Low-cost private education  Tooley is best known for his work on low cost private education. He began this work in 2000, having discovered for himself the existence of low cost private schools in the slums of Hyderabad while doing consultancy for the International Finance Corporation. A major research programme was subsequently undertaken between 2003 and 2005, funded by the John Templeton Foundation, exploring the nature and existence of private schools for the poor in India, Ghana, Nigeria, Kenya and China, and comparing public and private provision for the poor. This research is reported in a range of books and publications, including The Beautiful Tree: a personal journey into how the world's poorest people are educating themselves (Penguin, New Delhi, and Cato Institute, 2009). His work has also been profiled in documentaries for the BBC and PBS: for the latter it was featured alongside the work of Nobel Laureate Muhammad Yunus and Hernando de Soto Polar. The basic findings of the research show that in urban and peri-urban poor areas (slums and shanty towns) in India and the African countries studied, the majority of schoolchildren are in low cost private schools. After testing 24,000 children, it was found that children in the low cost private schools significantly outperform children in public schools, after controlling for background variables and the school choice process. In 2017 Tooley announced plans to open a low cost private primary school in Durham, England. The school opened in 2018. An Ofsted report in 2019 rated the school as \\"Good\\".  Educational philosophy and thought  Tooley's work has also explored the role of government in education from philosophical and other theoretical perspectives. This has resulted in academic articles challenging the work of philosophers Harry Brighouse and Adam Swift, and in the major book E. G. West: economic liberalism and the role of government in education (Continuum Library of Educational Thought, 2008).  Prizes and awards  The following are the major awards won by Tooley: * Sir Antony Fisher Memorial Prize, for The Beautiful Tree, April 2010 * Gold Prize Winner, 1st Financial Times/International Finance Corporation, Private Sector Development Research Paper Competition, September 2006 * Templeton Prize for Free Market Solutions to Poverty, 1st Prize, March 2006 * Alexis de Tocqueville Award for the Advancement of Education Freedom, May 2007 * National Free Enterprise Award, Feb 2007  Publications  The following are the books and monographs published by Tooley: * Tooley, James (2016) Imprisoned in India: Corruption and Extortion in the World's Largest Democracy; Biteback Publishing; Great Britain * Tooley, James (2009) The Beautiful Tree: a personal journey into how the world's poorest people are educating themselves.

According to Loehrlein in 2009 this includes design, construction and management of residential and commercial gardens.

Compost, fertilization, integrated pest management, using the right plant in the right place, appropriate use of turf and xeriscaping (water-wise gardening) are all components of sustainable landscaping.  Benefits  Sustainability can help urban commercial landscaping companies save money. In California, gardens often do not outweigh the cost of inputs like water and labor. However, using appropriately selected and properly sited plants may help to ensure that maintenance costs are lower because of reduced inputs. * Long lasting * Reduced water usage and no surface runoff or puddles * Minimal use of fertilizers and pesticides * Use of green waste * Conservation of energy and resources  Issues  Sustainability issues for landscaping include: *Carbon sequestration *Climate change *Water conservation *Energy usage Non-sustainable practices include: *Consumption of non-renewable resources *Greenhouse gas emissions  Solutions  Some of the solutions are: * Reduction of stormwater run-off through the use of bio-swales, rain gardens and green roofs and walls.Rowe, B., J.

Proper design  One step to garden design is to do a \\"sustainability audit\\". This is similar to a landscape site analysis that is typically performed by landscape designers at the beginning of the design process. Factors such as lot size, house size, local covenants and budgets should be considered. The steps to design include a base plan, site inventory and analysis, construction documents, implementation and maintenance. Of great importance is considerations related to the growing conditions of the site. These include orientation to the sun, soil type, wind flow, slopes, shade and climate, the goal of reducing irrigation and use of toxic substances, and requires proper plant selection for the specific site. Sustainable landscaping is not only important because it saves money, it also limits the human impact on the surrounding ecosystem. However, planting species not native to the landscape may introduce invasive plant species as well as new wildlife that was not in the ecosystem before. Altering the ecosystem is a major problem and meeting with an expert with experience with the wildlife and agriculture in the area will help avoid this.  Irrigation  Mulch may be used to reduce water loss due to evaporation, reduce weeds, minimize erosion, dust and mud problems. Mulch can also add nutrients to the soil when it decomposes. However, mulch is most often used for weed suppression. Over use of mulch can result in harm to the selected plantings. Care must be taken in the source of the mulch, for instance, black walnut trees result in a toxic mulch product. Grass cycling turf areas (using mulching mowers that leave grass clippings on the lawn) will also decrease the amount of fertilizer needed, reduce landfill waste and reduce costs of disposal.California Integrated Waste Management Board. http://www.ciwmb.ca.gov/Organics/landscaping/ A common recommendation is to adding 2-4 inches of mulch in flower beds and under trees away from the trunk. Mulch should be applied under trees to the dripline (extension of the branches) in lieu of flowers, hostas, turf or other plants that are often planted there. This practice of planting under trees is detrimental to tree roots, especially when such plants are irrigated to an excessive level that harms the tree. One must be careful not to apply mulch to the bark of the tree. It can result in smothering, mold and to insect depredation. The practice of xeriscaping or water-wise gardening suggests that placing plants with similar water demands together will save time and low-water or drought tolerant plants would be a smart initial consideration. A homeowner may consider consulting an accredited irrigation technician/auditor and obtain a water audit of current systems. Drip or sub-surface irrigation may be useful. Using evapotranspiration controllers, soil sensors and refined control panels will reduce water loss. Irrigation heads may need readjustment to avoid sprinkling on sidewalks or streets. Business owners may consider developing watering schedules based on historical or actual weather data and soil probes to monitor soil moisture prior to watering. An example of sustainable irrigation (Drip Irrigation)  Building materials  When deciding what kind of building materials to put on a site it is important to recycle as often as possible, such as for example by reusing old bricks. It is also important to be careful about what materials you use, especially if you plan to grow food crops. Old telephone poles and railroad ties have usually been treated with a toxic substance called creosote that can leach into the soils. Sustainably harvested lumber is available, in which ecological, economic and social factors are integrated into the management of trees used for lumber.http://www.bearcreeklumber.com/products/intextboth/sustainable.html. Viewed 12-07-09.  Planting selection  One important part of sustainable landscaping is plant selection. Most of what makes a landscape unsustainable is the amount of inputs required to grow a non-native plant on it. What this means is that a local plant, which has adapted to local climate conditions will require less work to flourish. Instead, drought-tolerant plants like succulents and cacti are better suited to survive. Plants used as windbreaks can save up to 30% on heating costs in winter. They also help with shading a residence or commercial building in summer, create cool air through evapo- transpiration and can cool hardscape areas such as driveways and sidewalks.Farmstead Windbreaks: Planning. http://www.extension.iastate.edu/Publications/PM1716.pdf. Retrieved 12-12-09. Irrigation is an excellent end-use option in greywater recycling and rainwater harvesting systems, and a composting toilet can cover (at least) some of the nutrient requirements. Not all fruit trees are suitable for greywater irrigation, as reclaimed greywater is typically of high pH and acidophile plants don't do well in alkaline environments. Energy conservation may be achieved by placing broadleaf deciduous trees near the east, west and optionally north-facing walls of the house. Such selection provides shading in the summer while permitting large amounts of heat-carrying solar radiation to strike the house in the winter. The trees are to be placed as closely as possible to the house walls. As the efficiency of photovoltaic panels and passive solar heating is sensitive to shading, experts suggest the complete absence of trees near the south side. Another choice would be that of a dense vegetative fence composed of evergreens (e.g. conifers) near that side from which cold continental winds blow and also that side from which the prevailing winds blow. Such choice creates a winter windbreak that prevents low temperatures outside the house and reduces air infiltration towards the inside. Calculations show that placing the windbreak at a distance twice the height of the trees can reduce the wind velocity by 75%.\\"Green from the ground up\\" by D. Johnston and S. Gibson The above vegetative arrangements come with two disadvantages. Firstly, they minimize air circulation in summer although in many climates heating is more important and costly than cooling, and, secondly, they may affect the efficiency of photovoltaic panels. However, it has been estimated that if both arrangements are applied properly, they can reduce the overall house energy usage by up to 22%.  Sustainable lawns  An example of a sustainable lawn Lawns are typically the center point of any landscape. While there are many different species of grass, only a limited amount are considered sustainable. Knowing the climate around the landscape is ideal for saving water and being sustainable. For example, in southern California having a grass lawn of tall fescue will typically need upwards of of water. A lawn in the same place made up of mixed beds with various trees, shrubs, and ground cover will normally need of water. Having gravel, wood chips or bark, mulch, rubber mulch, artificial grass, patio, wood or composite deck, rock garden, or a succulent garden are all considered sustainable landscape techniques. Other species of plants other than grass that can take up a lawn are lantana, clover, creeping ivy, creeping thyme, oregano, rosemary hedges, silver pony foot, moneywort, chamomile, yarrow, creeping lily turf, ice plant, and stone crop.  Maintenance  Pests It is best to start with pest-free plant materials and supplies and close inspection of the plant upon purchase is recommended. Establishing diversity within the area of plant species will encourage populations of beneficial organisms (e.g. birds, insects), which feed on potential plant pests. Attracting a wide variety of organisms with a variety of host plants has shown to be effective in increasing pollinator presence in agriculture. Because plant pests vary from plant to plant, assessing the problem correctly is half the battle. The owner must consider whether the plant can tolerate the damage caused by the pest. If not, then does the plant justify some sort of treatment? Physical barriers may help. Landscape managers should make use of the Integrated Pest Management to reduce use of pesticides and herbicides. Pruning Proper pruning will increase air circulation and may decrease the likelihood of plant diseases. However, improper pruning is detrimental to shrubs and trees.

Sigmund Freud believed that humans are born with unfocused sexual libidinal drives, and therefore argued that homosexuality might be a deviation from this. Nevertheless, he also felt that certain deeply rooted forms of homosexuality were difficult or impossible to change. Overview Freud's most important articles on homosexuality were written between 1905, when he published Three Essays on the Theory of Sexuality, and 1922, when he published \\"Certain Neurotic Mechanisms in Jealousy, Paranoia, and Homosexuality\\". Freud believed that all humans were bisexual, by which he primarily meant that everyone incorporates aspects of both sexes, and that everyone is sexually attracted to both sexes. In his view, this was true anatomically and therefore also mentally and psychologically. Heterosexuality and homosexuality both developed from this original bisexual disposition. As one of the causes of homosexuality, Freud mentions the distressing heterosexual experience: \\"Those cases are of particular interest in which the libido changes over to an inverted sexual object after a distressing experience with a normal one.\\" Freud appears to have been undecided whether or not homosexuality was pathological, expressing different views on this issue at different times and places in his work. Freud frequently borrowed the term \\"inversion\\" from his contemporaries to describe homosexuality, something which in his view was distinct from the necessarily pathological perversions, and suggested that several distinct kinds might exist, cautioning that his conclusions about it were based on a small and not necessarily representative sample of patients. Freud derived much of his information on homosexuality from psychiatrists and sexologists such as Richard von Krafft-Ebing and Magnus Hirschfeld, and was also influenced by Eugen Steinach, a Viennese endocrinologist who transplanted testicles from straight men into gay men in attempts to change their sexual orientation. Freud stated that Steinach's research had \\"thrown a strong light on the organic determinants of homoeroticism\\", but cautioned that it was premature to expect that the operations he performed would make possible a therapy that could be generally applied. In his view, such transplant operations would be effective in changing sexual orientation only in cases in which homosexuality was strongly associated with physical characteristics typical of the opposite sex, and probably no similar therapy could be applied to lesbianism. In fact Steinach's method was doomed to failure because the immune systems of his patients rejected the transplanted glands, and was eventually exposed as ineffective and often harmful. Views on attempts to change homosexuality Freud believed that homosexuals could seldom be convinced that sex with someone of the opposite sex would provide them with the same pleasure they derived from sex with someone of the same sex. Patients often pursued treatment due to social disapproval, which was not a strong enough motive for change. Freud wrote in the 1920 paper The Psychogenesis of a Case of Homosexuality in a Woman, that changing homosexuality was difficult and therefore possible only under unusually favourable conditions, observing that \\"in general to undertake to convert a fully developed homosexual into a heterosexual does not offer much more prospect of success than the reverse.\\" Success meant making heterosexual feelings possible rather than eliminating homosexual feelings. Female homosexuality Freud's main discussion of female homosexuality was the paper The Psychogenesis of a Case of Homosexuality in a Woman, which described his analysis of a young woman who had entered therapy because her parents were concerned that she was a lesbian. Her father hoped that psychoanalysis would cure her lesbianism, but in Freud's view, the prognosis was unfavourable because of the circumstances under which the woman entered therapy, and because the homosexuality was not an illness or neurotic conflict. Freud, therefore, told the parents only that he was prepared to study their daughter to determine what effects therapy might have. Freud concluded that he was probably dealing with a case of biologically innate homosexuality, and eventually broke off the treatment because of what he saw as his patient's hostility to men. 1935 letter In 1935, Freud wrote to a mother who had asked him to treat her son's homosexuality, a letter that would later become famous: See also * Conversion therapy * Rick Santorum's views on homosexuality * Sexual Preference Notes References * Freud, Sigmund, Hand-written letter dated 9 April 1935, published as \\"Historical Notes - A Letter from Freud\\", American Journal of Psychiatry 107, no. 10, 786‚Äì787. doi:10.1176/ajp.107.10.786    * Category:Sigmund Freud's views Category:Freudian psychology Category:Conversion therapy Freud, Sigmund Category:Point of view ","title":"Sigmund Freud's views on homosexuality"},{"id":"24142638","text":"CERP ‚Äì European Confederation of Public Relations is a Pan-European organization representing the national public relations and communication associations of Europe. CERP is also the European division of the worldwide organization Global Alliance for Public Relations and Communication Management. Current situation The CERP headquarters is in Brussels (Belgium). The current president of the organization is Mr. Roberto Zangrandi, the head of ENEL European Affairs office in Brussels. Mr. Zangrandi was elected president at the CERP General Assembly that took place in London on 21 June 2008. On 19‚Äì20 June 2009 the General Assembly in Vienna discussed the current situation of the organization and, in particular, its stagnation. The confederation's re-launching was proposed. Following the results of an extended associative marketing campaign conducted after the above-mentioned General Assembly aimed at checking whether the national federations of public relations still had interest in such an umbrella organisation, the CERP Board of Directors decided to dissolve it and merge it within the Global Alliance for Public Relations and Communication Management. The decision was taken at the Extraordinary General Assembly that took place on 12 November 2009 in Catania (Italy). The procedure of CERP's winding-up and its incorporation into the Global Alliance for Public Relations and Communication Management is underway and is to be finished in the first part of 2010. As a consequence of the dissolution, the European Confederation of Public Relations will be converted into a study centre and think tank. The new activities will include the positioning of the new body as a Brussels-based Global Alliance for Public Relations and Communication Management arm. History The idea of such an organization belongs to a Frenchman Mr. Lucien Matrat; in 1956 he launched an initiative to create a European Committee of Public Relations. Such a committee was formed in Luxembourg the following year by a group of interested individuals, but the organization itself was officially established in Orleans (France) on 8 May 1959 by four founding members ‚Äì Italy, France, the Netherlands and Belgium. At the very beginning of its existence the organization was called European Center of Public Relations. The statutes of the organization provided for four working groups: CEDAN, CEDET and CEDAP. CEDAN, that is, the European Conference of National Public Relations Associations, aimed at active members and endeavored to coordinate activities of the national associations in order to reach agreement on professional principles, ethics, and practice. The two remaining working groups were aimed at the professional members: CEDET was meant for anyone involved in research and education whereas CEDAP was the forum for independent advisers and integrated employees. The official language of the organization was French, but only till 1966 when English was granted this status too. One of the most important achievements of the organization in those years was approval of Code of Athens (called also Code of Ethics) in 1965 which enjoins public relations practitioners worldwide to respect the Charter of the United Nations and the moral principles of its Universal Declaration of Human Rights. The author of the document, adopted in May 1965 in Athens and amended in Teheran in April 1968, was Mr. Lucien Matrat who launched the idea to establish CERP. A number of national associations have joined the organization in the coming years. The first to join the founding members in 1959 were Greece and Germany. In 1965 the British Institute of Public Relations became a member of CERP, in 1974 ‚Äì Danish Public Relations Association. In 1974 the organization counted 13 active members. From the end of 70s the main CERP's concern was reaching recognition of the profession and its coordination on the European level. But the main obstacle to the objective, so important for the PR field, was the fact that most European countries in those times were still thinking too nationally, and all the efforts did not go beyond declarations of common aspirations and intentions. However, on 16 April 1978 in Lisbon CERP's General Assembly officially adopted \\"Code of Lisbon\\" ‚Äì code of professional conduct establishing criteria, standards and obligations for PR practitioners. It consisted of three sections: Section I ‚Äì Criteria and standards of professional qualification of practitioners bound by this Code; Section II ‚Äì General professional obligations; Section III ‚Äì Specific professional obligations (towards clients or employers, towards public opinion and the information media, towards fellow-practitioners, towards the profession). Members from 15 European countries agreed to the document as well as on disciplinary measures in case the code was not respected. In this period CERP became also more visible on the international scene having acquired consultative status within Council of Europe (1976) and UNESCO (1983), which earned the organization some prestige. In the meantime a new problem arose. There was more than one national association in some countries, the fact that raised a lot of questions regarding membership right at CERP. In 1979 an important decision was taken: several PR associations from a single country could become members of the organization. In the second part of 80s, CERP's complicated structure caused many discussions: its members were divided by two principal visions of CERP's re-organization. The first group saw the organization as a unique body uniting and representing only the national associations, while another one opted for an organization of individual members. In 1989 CERP sub-divided into separate bodies becoming in such a way a confederation of 22 members (3 individual European professional associations and 19 national associations) that in the coming years were joined by the countries from Eastern Europe. Those 3 organizations emerged from CERP were the following: CERP CONSULTANTS, CERP PRO (Public Relations Officers) and CERP EDUCATION. CERP EDUCATION, however, gave the way to CERP STUDENTS, a fourth autonomous international organization within the Confederation which consequently in 1995 counted 23 full members from 20 different countries and 4 autonomous organizations. During 1996‚Äì1998 further changes occur inside the Confederation: CERP EDUCATION turns CERP EDUCATION AND RESEARCH (CER), CERP PRO practically disappears and CERP CONSULTANTS becomes less active. December 2000 was crucial for the CERP EDUCATION AND RESEARCH: CERP's sub-division decided to become independent from the Confederation. In such a way EUPRERA was born. A few years later in June 2004, the CERP STUDENTS members decided on stepping out of the Confederation as well, and, therefore, the European Confederation of Public Relations Students became PRime, The European Association of Public Relations and Communication Students. Recent activities On 16 March 2008 CERP organized a luncheon meeting with Mr. Gerard Legris, Head of Unit (Secretariat General of the European Commission for Transparency, Relations with Stakeholders and External Organizations) to discuss Code of Conduct for Public Affairs and Ethics in communication. On 21 July 2006 CERP produced Joint response to the European Commission's White Paper on a European Communication Policy. The organization endorsed the EC intention to engage the citizens on the basis of different opinions towards the EU policies and considered crucial to implicate more widely the civil society in the debate on Europe and policy‚Äìmaking process. CERP offered to the European Commission further support and invited it to cooperate.

Prior to his recent retirement, he held the position of Research Professor of Sociology at the University of Essex. Thompson is regarded as a pioneer in social science research, particularly due to the development of life stories and oral history within sociology and social history.http://www.ucl.ac.uk/anthropology/staff/d_miller/mil-15 Academic career Thompson was educated at the University of Oxford, graduating in 1958 with First Class Honours in modern history. He obtained a D.Phil. (also at the University of Oxford) in 1964. This was entitled London Working Class Politics and the Formation of the London Labour Party, 1885-1914. In 1964, having spent three years as a Junior Research Fellow at Queen's College, Oxford, Thompson was appointed Lecturer in Sociology (Social History) at the newly established University of Essex. He was to continue his research and teaching in sociology and social history at Essex, being appointed Research Professor in Sociology, in 1988. Between 1994 and 2001, Thompson was also the Director of ESDS Qualidata, University of Essex, where he actively pursued his interest in the preservation of qualitative research materials for secondary use. In doing so, he deposited most his own datasets there while at the same time he was actively involved in the development of this archival service. Oral History Thompson is regarded as one of the pioneers of oral history as a research methodology in the social sciences. In 1971 he founded the Oral History Society and the journal Oral History. Between 1970 and 1973 he carried out a project titled 'Family Life and Work Experience before 1918' which was the first national oral history interview study to be carried out in Britain. The project resulted in a number of publications, including Thompson's The Edwardians: The Remaking of British Society, which was published in 1975 and again in revised form in 1992. In 1987 he also founded the National Life Story Collection (now known as National Life Stories) at the British Library National Sound Archive in London. The aim of this new collection was to \\"record first-hand experiences of as wide a cross-section of present-day society as possible\\".http://www.bl.uk/nls Subsequent oral history work includes studies of the family and community life of Scottish fishermen as well as car workers in Coventry and Turin. Recently, Thompson carried out a research project aimed at recording life stories with trans-national Jamaican families and is currently expanding on his work with pioneers of social research.

Career As a teenager Reeves learned orchestral double bass and played in local jazz-oriented groups (also sometimes the Wes Minster Five) with Colfes Grammar School, Lewisham schoolmates, Dave Greenslade and Jon Hiseman; Reeves and Hiseman would later record with John Mayall on the album Bare Wires and then go on to form Colosseum. Keen on jazz, Reeves played in the New Jazz Orchestra and had learned many standard songs. He worked in the music industry for several years, first in the quality control department of Decca Records listening to output that ranged from medieval classical music to Chubby Checker, after four years becoming assistant producer to Tony D'Amato, then briefly a record plugger for Pye Records. In late 1964 he suggested for Pye release, and played on, the instrumental UK hit Sounds Orchestral's \\"Cast Your Fate to the Wind\\". He became assistant to Tony Hatch at Pye before leaving to become a freelance producer for CBS and Polydor and creative director of the Greenwich Gramophone Company. He also recorded with the Mike Taylor Quartet on the album Pendulum in 1965 and with Davy Graham on Folk, Blues and Beyond and Midnight Man in 1966. Shortly afterwards Reeves took up electric bass, just before Hiseman recommended him to Mayall. After two albums with Colosseum he left to concentrate on session work and production, working with the Woods Band, Sandy Denny (The North Star Grassman and the Ravens), Paul Kent, John Martyn (Bless the Weather), Day of Phoenix and Burning Red Ivanhoe from Denmark, and Chris DeBurgh. In 1972 he rejoined Dave Greenslade and formed the band Greenslade. Reeves remained with the band until 1974, recording three albums with them. As with Colosseum, his departure was motivated by a desire to focus on his career as a producer. In 1973 he played on Mike Taylor Remembered, a tribute to the musician, with Neil Ardley, Jon Hiseman, Ian Carr, Barbara Thompson and other major modern British jazz players. Subsequently he played with Curved Air and in jazz band called Big Chief, with former Colosseum saxophonist Dick Heckstall-Smith and former Curved Air guitarist Mick Jacques. He still plays with Big Chief, Blue Amba and The Warthogs, and plays double bass at The Constitution pub in Camden Town (Davy Graham's local) every other Tuesday in the Cellar Bar, where he met multi-instrumentalist and songwriter JC Carroll, with whom he performs and records sporadically. They recorded a live album on their first show together in Ascot. They are understood to be working on an extended raga called looking for gold and an acoustic album. Reeves is also head of the British sound technology firm MTR Professional Audio, in business for almost 30 years.

It is an understanding of how the earth works, particularly as it relates to its biosphere or biodiversity. It stands in contrast to anthropocentrism, which centers on the value of humans. The related ecocentrism extends inherent value to the whole of nature. Biocentrism does not imply the idea of equality among the animal kingdom, for no such notion can be observed in nature. Biocentric thought is nature-based, not human-based. Advocates of biocentrism often promote the preservation of biodiversity, animal rights, and environmental protection. The term has also been employed by advocates of \\"left biocentrism\\", which combines deep ecology with an \\"anti-industrial and anti-capitalist\\" position (according to David Orton et al.).  Definition  The term biocentrism encompasses all environmental ethics that \\"extend the status of moral object from human beings to all living things in nature\\". Biocentric ethics calls for a rethinking of the relationship between humans and nature. It states that nature does not exist simply to be used or consumed by humans, but that humans are simply one species amongst many, and that because we are part of an ecosystem, any actions which negatively affect the living systems of which we are a part adversely affect us as well, whether or not we maintain a biocentric worldview. Biocentrists observe that all species have inherent value, and that humans are not \\"superior\\" to other species in a moral or ethical sense. The four main pillars of a biocentric outlook are: # Humans and all other species are members of Earth's community. # All species are part of a system of interdependence. # All living organisms pursue their own \\"good\\" in their own ways. # Human beings are not inherently superior to other living things.  Relationship with animals and environment Biocentrism views individual species as parts of the living biosphere. It observes the consequences of reducing biodiversity on both small and large scales and points to the inherent value all species have to the environment. The environment is seen for what it is; the biosphere within which we live and depend on its diversity for our health. From these observations the ethical points are raised.  History and development  Biocentric ethics differs from classical and traditional ethical thinking. Rather than focusing on strict moral rules, as in Classical ethics, it focuses on attitudes and character. In contrast with traditional ethics, it is nonhierarchical and gives priority to the natural world rather than to humankind exclusively. Biocentric ethics includes Albert Schweitzer's ethics of \\"Reverence for Life\\", Peter Singer's ethics of Animal Liberation and Paul W. Taylor's ethics of biocentric egalitarianism. Albert Schweitzer's \\"reverence for life\\" principle was a precursor of modern biocentric ethics. In contrast with traditional ethics, the ethics of \\"reverence for life\\" denies any distinction between \\"high and low\\" or \\"valuable and less valuable\\" life forms, dismissing such categorization as arbitrary and subjective. Conventional ethics concerned itself exclusively with human beings‚Äîthat is to say, morality applied only to interpersonal relationships‚Äîwhereas Schweitzer's ethical philosophy introduced a \\"depth, energy, and function that differ[s] from the ethics that merely involved humans\\". \\"Reverence for life\\" was a \\"new ethics, because it is not only an extension of ethics, but also a transformation of the nature of ethics\\". Similarly, Peter Singer argues that non-human animals deserve the same equality of consideration that we extend to human beings. His argument is roughly as follows: # Membership in the species Homo sapiens is the only criterion of moral importance that includes all humans and excludes all non- humans. # Using membership in the species Homo sapiens as a criterion of moral importance is completely arbitrary. # Of the remaining criteria we might consider, only sentience is a plausible criterion of moral importance. # Using sentience as a criterion of moral importance entails that we extend the same basic moral consideration (i.e. \\"basic principle of equality\\") to other sentient creatures that we do to human beings. # Therefore, we ought to extend to animals the same equality of consideration that we extend to human beings. Singer's work, while notable in the canon of environmental ethics, should not be considered as fully biocentric however. Singer's ethics is extended from humans to nonhuman animals because the criterion for moral inclusion (sentience) is found in both humans and nonhuman animals, thus it would be arbitrary to deny it to nonhuman animals simply because they were not human. However, not all biological entities are sentient, consider: algae, plants and trees, fungi, lichens, mollusks, protozoa, for example. For an ethical theory to be biocentric, it must have a reason for extending ethical inclusion to the entire biosphere (as in Taylor and Schweitzer). The requirement for environmental ethics to move beyond sentience as criteria for inclusion in the moral realm is discussed in Regan.https://philpapers.org/rec/REGTNA Biocentrism is most commonly associated with the work of Paul W. Taylor, especially his book Respect for Nature: A Theory of Environmental Ethics (1986). Taylor maintains that biocentrism is an \\"attitude of respect for nature\\", whereby one attempts to make an effort to live one's life in a way that respects the welfare and inherent worth of all living creatures. Taylor states that: # Humans are members of a community of life along with all other species, and on equal terms. # This community consists of a system of interdependence between all members, both physically, and in terms of relationships with other species. # Every organism is a \\"teleological centre of life\\", that is, each organism has a purpose and a reason for being, which is inherently \\"good\\" or \\"valuable\\". # Humans are not inherently superior to other species. Historian Donald Worster traces today's biocentric philosophies, which he sees as part of a recovery of a sense of kinship between man and nature, to the reaction by the British intelligencia of the Victorian era against the Christian ethic of dominion over nature. He has pointed to Charles Darwin as an important spokesman for the biocentric view in ecological thought and quotes from Darwin's Notebook on Transmutation of Species (1837): > If we choose to let conjecture run wild, then animals, our fellow brethren > in pain, diseases, death, suffering and famine‚Äîour slaves in the most > laborious works, our companions in our amusement‚Äîthey may partake of our > origin in one common ancestor‚Äîwe may be all netted together. In 1859, Charles Darwin published his book On the Origin of Species. This publication sparked the beginning of biocentrist views by introducing evolution and \\"its removal of humans from their supernatural origins and placement into the framework of natural laws\\". The work of Aldo Leopold has also been associated with biocentrism. The essay \\"The Land Ethic\\" in Leopold's book Sand County Almanac (1949) points out that although throughout history women and slaves have been considered property, all people have now been granted rights and freedoms. Leopold notes that today land is still considered property as people once were. He asserts that ethics should be extended to the land as \\"an evolutionary possibility and an ecological necessity\\". He argues that while people's instincts encourage them to compete with others, their ethics encourage them to co-operate with others. He suggests that \\"the land ethic simply enlarges the boundaries of the community to include soils, waters, plants, and animals, or collectively: the land\\". In a sense this attitude would encourage humans to co-operate with the land rather than compete with it. Outside of formal philosophical works biocentric thought is common among pre-colonial tribal peoples who knew no world other than the natural world.  In law  The paradigm of biocentrism and the values that it promotes are beginning to be used in law. In recent years, cities in Maine, Pennsylvania, New Hampshire and Virginia have adopted laws that protect the rights of nature. The purpose of these laws is to prevent the degradation of nature; especially by corporations who may want to exploit natural resources and land space, and to also use the environment as a dumping ground for toxic waste. The first country to include rights of nature in its constitution is Ecuador (See 2008 Constitution of Ecuador). Article 71 states that nature \\"has the right to integral respect for its existence and for the maintenance and regeneration of its life cycles, structure, functions and evolutionary processes\\".  In religion   Islam  In Islam: In Islam, biocentric ethics stem from the belief that all of creation belongs to Allah (God), not humans, and to assume that non-human animals and plants exist merely to benefit humankind leads to environmental destruction and misuse. As all living organisms exist to praise God, human destruction of other living things prevents the earth's natural and subtle means of praising God. The Qur'an acknowledges that humans are not the only all-important creatures and emphasizes a respect for nature. Muhammad was once asked whether there would be a reward for those who show charity to nature and animals, to which he replied, \\"for charity shown to each creature with a wet heart [i.e. that is alive], there is a reward.\\"  Hinduism  In Hinduism: Hinduism contains many elements of biocentrism. In Hinduism, humans have no special authority over other creatures, and all living things have souls ('atman'). Brahman (God) is the \\"efficient cause\\" and Prakrti (nature), is the \\"material cause\\" of the universe. However, Brahman and Prakrti are not considered truly divided: \\"They are one in [sic] the same, or perhaps better stated, they are the one in the many and the many in the one.\\" However, while Hinduism does not give the same direct authority over nature that the Judeo-Christian God grants, they are subject to a \\"higher and more authoritative responsibility for creation\\". The most important aspect of this is the doctrine of Ahimsa (non-violence). The YƒÅj√±avalkya Sm·πõti warns, \\"the wicked person who kills animals which are protected has to live in hell fire for the days equal to the number of hairs on the body of that animal\\". The essential aspect of this doctrine is the belief that the Supreme Being incarnates into the forms of various species. The Hindu belief in Sa·πÉsƒÅra (the cycle of life, death and rebirth) encompasses reincarnation into non-human forms. It is believed that one lives 84,000 lifetimes before one becomes a human. Each species is in this process of samsara until one attains moksha (liberation). Another doctrinal source for the equal treatment of all life is found in the Rigveda. The Rigveda states that trees and plants possess divine healing properties. It is still popularly believed that every tree has a Vriksa-devata (a tree deity).Trees are ritually worshiped through prayer, offerings, and the sacred thread ceremony. The Vriksa-devata worshiped as manifestations of the Divine. Tree planting is considered a religious duty.  Jainism  In Jainism: The Jaina tradition exists in tandem with Hinduism and shares many of its biocentric elements. Ahimsa (non-violence), the central teaching of Jainism, means more than not hurting other humans. It means intending not to cause physical, mental or spiritual harm to any part of nature. In the words of Mahavira: 'You are that which you wish to harm.' Compassion is a pillar of non-violence. Jainism encourages people to practice an attitude of compassion towards all life. The principle of interdependence is also very important in Jainism. This states that all of nature is bound together, and that \\"if one does not care for nature one does not care for oneself.\\". Another essential Jain teaching is self-restraint. Jainism discourages wasting the gifts of nature, and encourages its practitioners to reduce their needs as far as possible. Gandhi, a great proponent of Jainism, once stated \\"There is enough in this world for human needs, but not for human wants.\\"  Buddhism  In Buddhism: The Buddha's teachings encourage people \\"to live simply, to cherish tranquility, to appreciate the natural cycle of life\\". Buddhism emphasizes that everything in the universe affects everything else. \\"Nature is an ecosystem in which trees affect climate, the soil, and the animals, just as the climate affects the trees, the soil, the animals and so on. The ocean, the sky, the air are all interrelated, and interdependent‚Äîwater is life and air is life.\\" Although this holistic approach is more ecocentric than biocentric, it is also biocentric, as it maintains that all living things are important and that humans are not above other creatures or nature. Buddhism teaches that \\"once we treat nature as our friend, to cherish it, then we can see the need to change from the attitude of dominating nature to an attitude of working with nature‚Äîwe are an intrinsic part of all existence rather than seeing ourselves as in control of it.\\"  Criticism  Biocentrism has faced criticism for a number of reasons. Some of this criticism grows out of the concern that biocentrism is an anti-human paradigm and that it will not hesitate to sacrifice human well-being for the greater good. Biocentrism has also been criticized for its individualism; emphasizing too much on the importance of individual life and neglecting the importance of collective groups, such as an ecosystem. A more complex form of criticism focuses on the contradictions of biocentrism. Opposed to anthropocentrism, which sees humans as having a higher status than other species, biocentrism puts humans on a par with the rest of nature, and not above it. In his essay A Critique of Anti- Anthropocentric Biocentrism Richard Watson suggests that if this is the case, then \\"Human ways‚Äîhuman culture‚Äîand human actions are as natural as the ways in which any other species of animals behaves\\". He goes on to suggest that if humans must change their behavior to refrain from disturbing and damaging the natural environment, then that results in setting humans apart from other species and assigning more power to them. This then takes us back to the basic beliefs of anthropocentrism. Watson also claims that the extinction of species is \\"Nature's way\\" and that if humans were to instigate their own self- destruction by exploiting the rest of nature, then so be it. Therefore, he suggests that the real reason humans should reduce their destructive behavior in relation to other species is not because we are equals but because the destruction of other species will also result in our own destruction. This view also brings us back to an anthropocentric perspective.

History Jukenpo is thought to draw its origins from a combination of J≈´jutsu, Aikinojutsu principles and the Chinese boxing arts. It was one of the fighting arts used by the horsemen to unseat their enemies and for close range combat. As Jukempo became tactically less interesting, it moved to a ground fighting method. Jukenpo today Jukenpo is actually part of the Takeda Ryu Nakamura Ha Sobudo Japanese About Takeda Ryuu and is considered a complement to the Aikido taught in this school. Jukenpo strikes are used to divert an opponent before a decisive action such as a sword cut, a throw or a joint break. The combination of Aikido and Jukenpo is often named . Technical aspects Jukenpo uses strikes, throws, locks and chokes. As a descendant of the Chinese boxing, punches and kicks are fundamental in this art. The basic punches are:Takeda Ryu Nakamura Ha Sobudo DVD, BAB, * Tate Ken Tate Uchi: \\"hammer\\" blow to the top of the fontanel. * Tate Ken Yoko Uchi: \\"hammer\\" blow to the temple. * Tate Ken Gyaku Yoko Uchi: cross \\"hammer\\" blow to the temple. * Tate Ken Yoko Uchi: \\"hammer\\" blow to the ribs. * Tate Ken Gyaku Yoko Uchi Chudan: cross hammer blow to the ribs. * Tate Ken Jodan Tsuki: punch to the face with the hand in a vertical position. * Tate Ken Chudan Tsuki: punch to the abdomen with the hand in a vertical position. * Yoko Ken Jodan Tsuki: punch to the face with the hand in an horizontal position. * Yoko Ken Chudan Tuski: punch to the abdomen with the hand in a horizontal position. * Yoko Ken Yoko Uchi: punch to the temple, similar to an hook in boxing. * Yoko Ken Age Uchi: punch to the chin, similar to an uppercut. * Uraken Mukae Uchi: reverse punch to the nose. * Uraken Age Uchi: reverse punch to the jaw. The basic kicks are : * Ate Geri Chudan: front kick to the abdomen. * Harai Geri Gedan: low lateral kick to the knee. * Harai Geri Chudan: lateral kick to the ribs. * Ori Geri Gedan: pushing kick to the kneecap. * Ori Geri Chudan: pushing kick to the abdomen. There are several other strikes such as Higi Uchi (elbow strikes), Hiza Geri (knee kicks) that are not included in the basic techniques and considered as Koryu Waza. Jukenpo relies on relaxed movements to increase speed and allow faster sequences. The tension exists only during the impact. This principle is opposite to the \\"one hit, one kill\\" philosophy of Karate. Teaching methods The Kihon Waza (basic techniques) are designed to acquire the basic principles of the techniques. The first approach is to repeat the hits and blocks alone. In order to improve the basics, the techniques are then practised with a partner. One of the partners is the attacker and the other one the defender. This training is scheduled and conventional. After that, the training focuses on Kaeshi Waza to develop the Sen no Sen feelings. These exercises aim to hit the attacker exactly at the moment he takes the initiative. At mid-level, Kumite Randori (free partner sparring) is practiced in the form of Ju Ippon Kumite (soft, one hit, free sparring) and Ju Kumite (soft free sparring). Shiai Kumite is another part of the teaching. Shiai Kumite is a way to train as close as possible of a real fight. The opponents wear at least hands, feet and teeth protectors to avoid injuries. The highest and most advanced level of technique is Kory≈´ Waza. Kory≈´ Waza are ancient techniques, designed for maximal efficiency and damages with a minimal effort. They originate from battlefields.

It was to be a rival to the resort at Eagles Mere, about 5 miles away. By 1894,the lake had a steam vessel, a pavilion, and bath houses.

The next company, the Lake Mokoma Development Corporation took over in 1939. In 1959 the owners of the properties got together and bought the lake from the Corporation and created the current Lake Mokoma Association.

She is best known for her discovery of the Friend leukemia virus. She helped to establish the concept of the oncovirus, studied the role of the host immune response in disease development, and helped define modern retrovirology.  Biography  Family  Born and raised in New York, she was the youngest daughter of Russian Jewish emigrants, Morris Friend, a businessman, and Cecilia (Wolpin) Friend, a pharmacist. Friend had three siblings, consisting of two older sisters, Priscilla and Leafan, and a younger brother, Morris. When she was three years old, her father died, leaving her mother alone to raise four kids during the Great Depression. Her mother made sure all four of her kids would be able to finish their education, despite living on \\"Home Relief\\".  Education and Research  She graduated from Hunter High School in 1940 and Hunter College in 1944. The same year, she enlisted in the United States Navy. As a lieutenant junior grade she worked in the hematology laboratory at U.S. Naval Hospital Shoemaker, California. After the war ended she enrolled as a graduate student in the Department of Microbiology at Yale, where she received her PhD in 1950 with a thesis on the effects of sodium salicylate (aspirin) on antigen-antibody reactions During her time at Yale she frequently traveled to New York to consult with Elvin Kabat and Michael Heidelberger, imminent immunologists at Columbia. As a post- doc she worked in the Sloan-Kettering Institute under the direction of Cornelius P. Rhoads. While at Sloan-Kettering, she met Cecily Cannan Selby, who had recently gotten her Ph.D. from the Massachusetts Institute of Technology. Both of them were interested in cell structure. Once, when looking through an unused electron microscope at the university, the two decided to look at fine structures within the cells of the Ehrlich ascites carcinoma, a commonly used model for cancer research. What they found were structures in the cytoplasm of the cells which resembled those found in virus-infested cells. It was this incident that sparked Friend's interest in the possibility of cancer being caused by viruses, which became a main focus of her research. In 1966 she accepted a position as Professor and Director of the Center for Experimental Cell Biology at The Mount Sinai Hospital. During her lifetime she was President of the Harvey Society, the American Association for Cancer Research and the New York Academy of Sciences and was the first woman to do so. Charlotte Friend also served as a member of the Advisory Committee for the Virus Cancer Program of the National Institutes of Health and a member of the Board of Scientific Counselors of the Division of Cancer Cause and Prevention of the National Cancer Institute. Over the years, she served on a number of other advisory committees and on the editorial boards of several cancer and hematology journals. In all, she published 163 papers, 70 of which she wrote by herself or with one other author. On her sixtieth birthday she was diagnosed with a lymphoma. She was insistent that her diagnosis remain secret, and continued to carry out her duties in her laboratory. She died at the age of 65.

It was situated on the southern side of Lake Copais in a pass between the mountain and the lake. It is mentioned in the Catalogue of Ships in the Iliad by Homer, who gives it the epithet œÄŒøŒπŒÆŒµŒπœÇ in consequence of its well-watered meadows.Homeric Hymn to Apollo 243 In the invasion of Greece by Xerxes I, in 484 BCE, it was the only town that remained true to the cause of Greece, and was in consequence destroyed by the Persians. It was, however, soon rebuilt, and in the Peloponnesian War appears as one of the chief cities of Boeotia. It is chiefly memorable in history on account of the Battle of Haliartus fought under its walls between Lysander and the Thebans, in which the former was slain, 395 BCE.Plutarch, Lys. 28, 29, 9.32.5. In 171 BCE Haliartus was destroyed a second time. Having espoused the cause of Perseus of Macedon, it was taken by the Roman praetor Lucretius, who sold the inhabitants as slaves, carried off its statues, paintings, and other works of art, and razed it to the ground. Its territory was afterwards given to the Athenians, and it never recovered its former prosperity. Strabo speaks of it as no longer in existence in his time, and Pausanias, in his account of the place, mentions only a heroum of Lysander, and some ruined temples which had been burnt by the Persians and had been purposely left in that state.-3, 10.35.2. The Haliartia (·ºâŒªŒπŒ±œÅœÑŒØŒ±), or territory of Haliartus, was a very fertile plain, watered by numerous streams flowing into Lake Copais, which in this part was hence called the Haliartian marsh. These streams bore the names of Ocalea, Lophis, Hoplites, Permessus, and Olmeius. The territory of Haliartus extended westward to Mount Tilphossium, since Pausanias says that the Haliartians had a sanctuary of the goddesses called Praxidicae situated near this mountain. The towns Peteon, Medeon, Ocalea, and Onchestus were situated in the territory of Haliartus. Its site is located at the Kastri Maziou near modern Aliartos (formerly named Moulki, but renamed after the ancient town). The remains of Haliartus are situated upon a hill about a mile (1.6 km) from the village of Mazi, on the road from Thebes to Lebadeia, and at the distance of about from either place. The hill of Haliartus is not more than above the lake. It was visited in the 19th century by William Martin Leake who says, \\"that towards the lake the hill of Haliartus terminates in rocky cliffs, but on the other sides has a gradual acclivity. Some remains of the walls of the Acropolis, chiefly of polygonal masonry, are found on the summit of the hill; and there are several sepulchral crypts in the cliffs, below which, to the north, issues a copious source of water, flowing to the marsh, like all the other streams near the site of Haliartus. Although the walls of the exterior town are scarcely anywhere traceable, its extent is naturally marked to the east and west by two small rivers, of which that to the west issues from the foot of the hill of Mazi; the eastern, called the Kefal√°ri, has its origin in Mount Helicon. Near the left bank of this stream, at a distance of 500 yards (480 m) from the Acropolis, are a ruined mosque and two ruined churches, on the site of a village which, though long since abandoned, is shown by these remains to have been once inhabited by both Greeks and Turks. Here are many fragments of architecture and of inscribed stones, collected formerly from the ruins of Haliartus. From this spot there is a distance of about three-quarters of a mile (1.2 km) to a tumulus westward of the Acropolis, where are several sarcophagi and ancient foundations near some sources of waters, marking probably the site. of the western entrance of the city.\\"Leake, Northern Greece, vol. ii. p. 206, et seq. The stream which flowed on the western side of the city is the one called Hoplites by Plutarch, where Lysander fell, and is apparently the same as the Lophis of Pausanias.Plutarch Lys. 29; The stream on the eastern side, called Kefal√°ri, is formed by the union of two rivulets, which appear to be the Permessus and Olmeius, which are described by Strabo as flowing from Helicon, and after their union entering Lake Copais near Haliartus. The tumulus, of which Leake speaks, perhaps covers those who were killed along with Lysander, since it was near this spot that the battle was fought.

The demonstrators wanted better protection for children and a better functioning justice system that could investigate the Dutroux affair independently. Prior events After Marc Dutroux was arrested on 13 August 1996, and the kidnapped girls Sabine Dardenne and Laetitia Delhez were freed from his basement on 15 August, commotion started. In subsequent days, the dead bodies of four other kidnapped girls were found buried in various properties that Dutroux had owned. At first, the anger amongst the Belgian people was directed mainly at Dutroux himself, but it quickly targeted the police, the justice department and the politicians as well. Many Belgians denounced the police and government for botching the investigation into the earlier kidnappings and failing to arrest Dutroux earlier, allowing him to kill off the first four victims. A week prior to the White March people had already begun gathering in front of several courtrooms in Belgium. The mistrust of the police, justice department and politicians increased when the investigating magistrate Jean-Marc Connerotte, who had been collecting evidence against Dutroux, was accused of bias and dismissed from the case. On 14 October people entered the streets carrying flags which said: \\"I'm ashamed to be a Belgian\\". The White March On 20 October about 300,000 people (estimates range from 275,000 to 350,000, around 3% of Belgium's population) marched through Brussels. Many Belgians who lived outside Brussels came to the city to take part in the march. This demonstration was called the \\"White March\\", everyone was carrying something white: a balloon, a cloak, etc.; some had painted their face white. White was meant symbolically, as the color of hope. This symbolism had grown after Queen Fabiola wore white at the funeral of her husband. During the march, the fire brigade turned their hoses on the Federal Parliament buildings to symbolically cleanse it. With the demonstration, the Belgian public opinion wanted to indicate something had to change in Belgium and that the justice system and the police had to show more attention to children. Aftermath After the demonstration so called \\"white groups\\" or \\"white committees\\" were created. Later on they formed a commemoration in Neufch√¢teau with about 6,500 people attending, including parents of missed and murdered children. The white committees often criticized Jean-Luc Dehaene, who was the Prime Minister at the time, because the guilty still had not been punished.

His staunch defense of smallpox inoculation and support of the Loyalist cause led to his arrest and eventual departure to Canada. Life before the Revolution Azor Betts was born on September 13, 1740 in Norwalk, Connecticut, the son of Nathan Betts and Mary Belden. He married Gloriana Purdy in 1765 in Rye, New York, and practiced medicine in New York City prior to the Revolutionary War. The Revolution and smallpox The events of 1776 that began open hostility between the Continental Army and the British Army in America were tempered by outbreaks of smallpox that began the year previous. General George Washington of the Continentals ordered on May 20, 1776, that no man in his army be inoculated with smallpox, or face serious punishment. Betts first administered smallpox to members of the Continental Army mere days after the order was given, and was placed under arrest by local authorities. Testimony during a hearing on the matter before the New York Committee of Safety on May 26, 1776 was given by both Doctor Foster representing the prosecution and Betts in his defense. Doctor Foster testified that: In his defense, Betts told the Committee that: As a reaction to the news that Betts had performed these inoculations in New York, Washington immediately drew up another order, this time spelling out the punishment for any soldier caught being inoculated with smallpox: Jailed again for more smallpox inoculations, Betts became an open Loyalist, serving as both a Captain-Lieutenant in the Kings American Regiment and also as a surgeon for the Queen's Rangers. In May 1783, Betts left America for good, making his home in Kingston, New Brunswick. Life in Canada Soon after arriving in Kingston, Betts created isolation wards for those infected with smallpox. He continued this practice, and when the smallpox vaccine was introduced in 1802, he vaccinated local citizens free of charge. Betts died of consumption in Digby, Nova Scotia in 1809, one day after his 69th birthday. He is buried in the cemetery of the Trinity Anglican Church there. The inscription on a tombstone erected and later renewed by his family cites a different date for his death and burial place. A grave stone at the Old Loyalist Burial Grounds in Saint John, New Brunswick is inscribed \\"In Memory of Dr Azor Betts Died Sept 15, 1811, aged 72 years.

In France, its headquarters were in Fleury-sur-Andelle, Eure, and it employed approximately 360 employees and 50,000 distributors in France. In 1995, its activities ended and it changed its name after many complaints by former members who presented it as a cult, as well as two parliamentary reports. Doctrine and organization The GEPM, also called \\"the Business\\" by his followers, proposed a series of various daily life products, and seminars, rallies, travels, etc., and asked to recruit new members by canvassing, promising the wealth to the followers. The doctrine developed by Godzich mixed marketing techniques, biblical verses and esotericism.Bruno Fouchereau, La mafia des sectes ‚Äì Du rapport de l'Assembl√©e Nationale aux implications des multinationales, Filipacchi editions, 1996, pp. 24‚Äì28 () Several status could be reached by members, including 'ambassador', 'excellency' and 'diamond'. In 1995, the GEPM founded Le Groupement, a French professional team of cycling in 1995. Luc Leblanc, Ronan Pensec, Pascal Lino and Graeme Obree were among its adherents. Reception According to some journalistic articles, the GEPM was in connexion with the First Assembly of God Church, deemed by them as a far-right evangelist church, directed in the U.S. by Godzich's brother, and many distributors of the GEPM were baptized in this church.Jean-Marie Abgrall, La m√©canique des sectes, 2002, p. 69 In addition, excessive demands for money and the huge time devoted to the GEPM, that was deemed as harmful to member's family life,Jean-Pierre Van Girt, La France aux cent sectes, Vauvenargues editions, 1997, p. 167,168 () led to numerous complaints to the Institut national de la Consommation and to anti-cult associations (UNADFI, CCMM, Secticide). In 1995, the premises of French anti-cult association UNADFI were invaded by members of the GEPM to protest against the accusations of cultic deviances and asked the then president, Janine Tavernier, to explain why the group was criticized. The police was forced to intervene.Bruno Fouchereau, La mafia des sectes ‚Äì Du rapport de l'Assembl√©e Nationale aux implications des multinationales, Filipacchi editions, 1996, pp. 12‚Äì14 () The group was placed in receivership in 1995. The group was classified as cult in the 1995 and 1999 reports established by the Parliamentary Commission on Cults in France (under the name CEDIPAC SA, its new name then, then under Federation of the networks agreement [F√©d√©ration d'agr√©ment des r√©seaux or FAR], a group founded by former members). It was labelled as \\"evangelical\\" cult. Sociologist Bruno √âtienne criticized this classification, as the group's activity mainly consists in multi-level marketing.Bruno √âtienne, La France face aux sectes, Hachette editions, 2002, p. 224 The CCMM, as well as Jean Vernette, then national secretary of French episcopate for the study of cults and new religious movements, also considered this qualification as irrelevant. On June, the 22nd 1997, at the Z√©nith, Paris, crowded by more than 6000 distributors, the Federation of networks agreement (F√©d√©ration d'agr√©ment des r√©seaux or FAR), created by former GEPM members (Jean-Claude Martini, Gilbert Husson, Andr√©-Pierre Alexandre, Thierry Vavasseur,...) officially launches the new \\"Direct Distribution Franchise\\" AKEO which will be taken over by the new company NOAO created by Andr√©-Pierre Alexandre in 2001.http://www.societe.com/societe/noao-438389090.html In 2007, Godzich was condemned of three-year prison and 500,000-euro fine, for abuse of social goods.

This is defined by a test method, regulation, or technical specification. It can be measured in several ways ranging from a slow controlled puncture to a rapid impact of a sharp object or a rounded probe. Tests devised to measure puncture resistance are generally application-specific, covering items such as roofingTest Method for Static Puncture Resistance of Roofing Membrane Specimens and packaging materials, protective gloves, needle disposal facilities,Standard Specification for Puncture Resistance of Materials Used in Containers for Discarded Medical Needles and Other Sharps bulletproof vests, tires, etc. Puncture resistance in fabrics can be obtained through very tight woven fabrics, small ceramic plates in fabric coating or tight woven fabrics with a coating of hard crystals. All described methods significantly reduce the softness and flexibility of the fabric. The puncture resistance will depend on the nature of puncture attempt, with the two most important features being point sharpness and force. A fine sharp point such as a hypodermic needle will require a high ability to absorb and distribute the force to avoid penetration, but the total forces applied are still limited. The EN388 glove standard use a more pencil-like object with a flat tip of 1mm diameter. The EN388 test is highly dependent on the materials ability to withstand high forces through high tenacity and to a lesser extent to avoid cut or separation of the material. There is no or limited correlation between the protections provided in the low force/needle protection and the high force/pencil like EN388 test. Needle-resistant materials as described above are generally pierced by a force between 2-10N by a 25 gauge needle perpendicular to the fabric. The forces in the EN 388 test results are rated according to a score from 0-4 (0-<20N, 1-20N, 2-60N 3-100N 4-150N+). A newer test, ASTM F2878-10, is specifically designed to simulate common hypodermic needles in 21-, 25-, 28- gauge.

Representative genera include Ernietta, Phyllozoon, Pteridinium, Swartpuntia and possibly Dickinsonia.. Undisputed Erniettomorphs were Ediacaran, but the species Erytholus, Rutgersella, and Protonympha, who have by some been included in this group but are by no means clear members, are found through to the Late Devonian . Their affinity is uncertain; they probably form a clade and are most likely a sister group to the rangeomorphs, which bear a similar (though fractal) construction. Placements within the metazoan crown-group have been rebutted, and it is most likely that these peculiar organisms lie in the stem group to the animals. There is no evidence that they possessed a mouth or gut. Because they may have been found in water which was too deep to permit photosynthesis - and in some cases, lived half-buried in sediment, it is speculated that they fed by osmosis from the sea water. Such a lifestyle requires a very high surface area to volume ratio - higher than is observed in fossils. However, this paradox can be resolved if much of the volume of the organisms was not metabolically active. Many Pteridinium fossils are found completely filled with sand; if this sand were present within the organism while it was alive, this would reduce its metabolically active volume enough to make osmotic feeding viable.

Paleolithic art  Madhya Pradesh   Bhimbetka  Bhimbetka. The Bhimbetka rock shelters are an archaeological site in the state of Madhya Pradesh in central India that spans several prehistoric periods. It exhibits the earliest traces of human life on the Indian subcontinent and evidence of Stone Age habitation starting at the site in Acheulian times. It is located in the Raisen District southeast of Bhopal. Bhimbetka is a UNESCO world heritage site that consists of seven hills and over 750 rock shelters distributed over .Javid, Ali and Javeed, Tabassum (2008), World Heritage Monuments and Related Edifices in India, Algora Publishing, 2008, pages 15‚Äì19Rock Shelters of Bhimbetka: Advisory Body Evaluation, UNESCO, pages 43‚Äì44 At least some of the shelters were inhabited more than 100,000 years ago.Rock Shelters of Bhimbetka: Advisory Body Evaluation, UNESCO, pages 14‚Äì15 Some of the Bhimbetka rock shelters feature prehistoric cave paintings of which the oldest date from 10,000 years BP, corresponding to the Indian Mesolithic.

The paintings have not been dated, but they could be around 30,000 to 10,000 years old, as they use similar art form of Bhimbetka rock shelters in Bhopal. In the Nilagiri Hills, they are also found in Kumittipathi, Mavadaippu and Karikkiyur. In Theni District they are found in the Andipatti Hills. Karnataka Cave paintings are found in Hiregudda which is near Badami. Odisha Odisha has the richest repository of rock art in Eastern India. The state has recorded more than a hundred rock shelters with rock paintings and engravings. Numerous geometric symbols, dots and lines are found along with animals, and human paintings and engravings dating from late Pleistocene onwards. Many of the geometric shape and patterns found in rock art of Odisha are enigmatic in nature. Painted figures have been found executed in monochrome, red and white or sometimes in combination with shades of yellow color. Gudahandi Gudahandi Rock Art of Odisha The rock shelter of Gudahandi is located on the summit of the hillock and situated about 20 km from Block headquarters Koksara in Kalahandi district. The rock art shelter exhibits both monochrome and bi-chrome paintings of early historic period. It is the only reported rock art site of Kalahandi district. The rock art panel preserves the specimen of paintings which include a stylized human figure in red, deer and a variety of geometric patterns of squares and rectangles either empty or in filled with straight and diagonal lines or with dots on the borders grid patterns, wheels with spokes, apsidal patterns, oval shapes with dots executed either in monochrome of red or in polychrome of red, blue and black.

The script ‚ÄòGa‚Äô, and ‚Äòo‚Äô (tha) was discovered from Yogimatha rock painting, this painting saw a person with four animals and write some alphabet. That painting created a word Like \\"Gaitha\\" (very popular Odia word at present ‚ÄòGotha‚Äô or ‚Äògroup‚Äô in English). This art closely related to this alphabet. This alphabet has similarity to Dhauli and Jaugada Inscription‚Äôs script of Ashok. It was the ancient form of Indian script and it is the first glimpse of possible origin of the Odia language and script. Early medieval caves There are known more than 10,000 locations around India containing murals from this period, mainly natural caves and rock-cut chambers. The highest achievements of this time are the caves of Ajanta, Bagh, Sittanavasal, Armamalai Cave (Tamil Nadu), Ravan Chhaya rock shelter, Kailasanatha temple in Ellora Caves. Ajanta frescoes Mural of Padmapani in Ajanta Caves. India, 5th century The Frescoes of Ajanta are paintings in the Ajanta Caves which are situated near Aurangabad in Maharashtra. The caves are carved out of large rocks. Inside many of the caves are frescoes. Frescoes are paintings which are done on wet plaster in which colours become fixed as the plaster dries. The Ajanta Frescoes have a special importance of their own. They are found on the walls and ceilings at Ajanta. The paintings reflect different phases of Indian Culture from jain tirthankar mahaveer's birth to his nirvana(Mahaparinirvana was the time of Gautama Buddha's death. His disciples scattered his remains in many places, where Stupas were erected.) in the 8th Century AD. The frescoes have degraded slightly, due to the effect of flash photography. Photography here is not banned. They depict themes of court life, feasting, processions, men and women at work, festivals, various natural scenes including animals, birds and flowers. The artists used shading to give a three-dimensional effect. 1500m away to the north of Ajanta, beautiful frescoes have been found. Though the themes in these paintings are both secular and religious, they do depict some aspect of Buddhist life and rituals. One of the most famous paintings show a procession of elephants. Another depicts a dancer and women musicians. These have been influenced by Ajanta style of paintings. These frescoes show a strong resemblance to the frescoes of Sigiriya in Sri Lanka. Ellora Bas- relief from Ellora (Cave 29) showing Shiva and Parvati. The Ellora Caves are located about 18 miles from the city of Aurangabad in the Chamadari Hills. Pre-historic paintings were engraved in five Ellora Caves. The Ellora paintings can be organized in two series. The first set of paintings depicts images of the goddess Lakshmi and Lord Vishnu and was developed while the caves were engraved. The second set of images focuses on images of Lord Shiva with his followers, Apsaras, etc and was developed centuries after the formation of the caves. Bagh Painting of a Bodhisattva in Bagh Cave 2. The Bagh Caves are located in the Dhar District of Madhya Pradesh on the banks of the Baghani River. There were originally nine caves cut in the lofty hills, but four of them have been destroyed. The paintings in these caves were engraved in the time period of 500 to 700 CE. Notes References *Total History and Civics. a history Textbook. Published by Morning Star Publishers. ICSE Std IX.

Life Very little is known about Colgan's early life, but it is believed his parents may have been Nathaniel Watson Colgan and Letitia Phair. If correct his father, a pawnbroker, died on 23 January 1863 at Bishop-street, Dublin City and his mother died 26 April 1865, at Rehoboth House, South Circular Road, Dolphin's Barn just prior to Nathaniel's fourteenth birthday. After leaving the Incorporated School, Angier Street, Dublin City, Colgan began work as a clerk and from the age of twenty worked in the Dublin Metropolitan Police Court remaining there until his retirement in 1916. He began visiting Europe every summer from 1875, and these trips inspired many of the contributions to a magazine of literary manuscripts, Varieties. He was a regular contributor to the magazine from 1873 and edited it for a number of years. Colgan also contributed to Irish Monthly, Tinsley's Magazine and Hibernia. A shy and private person he did develop friendships through his membership of field clubs and an interest in nature, including Charles F. D'Arcy, later Anglican Archbishop of Dublin and Robert Lloyd Praeger. Colgan never married and died in Dublin on 2 October 1919. After moving from Rathmines about 1900 he lived with his unmarried sisters, Annie and Letitia and a brother, John Joseph, at 15 Breffni Terrace, in Sandycove. A married brother was the Rev. William Henry Colgan, Rector of Ballinlough, Co. Roscommon. Botanical and zoological work Colgan became a keen amateur botanist following his discovery in 1884 of the rare plant saw-wort in Wicklow and was encouraged by Alexander Goodman More to study botany further. He began working on his The Flora of County Dublin in the 1890s but publication was delayed as he and Reginald W. Scully undertook to edit Contributions towards a Cybele Hibernica : being outlines of the geographic distribution of plants in Ireland, founded on the papers of the late Alexander Goodman More following the death of his friend in 1895. Colgan is noted for his work in identifying the botanical species meant by the term 'shamrock' in the 1890s. He did this by requesting people from around Ireland send him specimens of what they believed to be an Irish shamrock. After tending these specimens until they flowered, Colgan identified five most common plant species. The most common was yellow clover, followed by white clover, red clover, black medic and finally wood sorrel. Dr Charles Nelson repeated the experiment in 1988, marking a hundred years since Colgan's original survey, and found that yellow clover was still the most commonly chosen. Yellow clover is also the species that is cultivated for sale in Ireland on Saint Patrick's Day and has been nominated by Department of Agriculture as the \\"official\\" shamrock of Ireland. Moving to Sandycove in 1900, Colgan developed an interest in marine invertebrates, particularly Mollusca and tunicates. Colgan recorded the marine Mollusca collected during the Clare Island Survey and his large mollusc collections from Co. Dublin and Clare Island were subsequently donated to the Natural History Museum Dublin. Colgan's interest in vernacular and Irish language names for various plants and animals was reflected in his other work into jellyfish, starfish and periwinkles and his contribution to the Clare Island Survey.

Maud was their eldest daughter.Thomas B. Costain, The Magnificent Century, pp. 103‚Äì104 She had two husbands: Hugh Bigod, 3rd Earl of Norfolk, and William de Warenne, 5th Earl of Surrey. Maud was also known as Matilda Marshal. Family Maud's birthdate is unknown other than being post 1191. She was the eldest daughter of William Marshal, 1st Earl of Pembroke and Isabel de Clare, 4th Countess of Pembroke, herself one of the greatest heiresses in Wales and Ireland. Maud had five brothers and four younger sisters. She was a co-heiress to her parents' extensive rich estates. Her paternal grandparents were John FitzGilbert Marshal and Sybilla of Salisbury, and her maternal grandparents were Richard de Clare, 2nd Earl of Pembroke, known as \\"Strongbow\\", and Aoife of Leinster. Marriages and issue Sometime before Lent in 1207, Maud married her first husband, Hugh Bigod, 3rd Earl of Norfolk. It was through this marriage between Maud and Hugh that the post of Earl Marshal of England came finally to the Howard Dukes of Norfolk.Costain, The Magnificent Century, pp. 103‚Äì104 In 1215, Hugh was one of the twenty-five sureties of the Magna Carta. He came into his inheritance in 1221, thus Maud became the Countess of Norfolk at that time. Together they had five children:Charles Cawley, Medieval Lands, Earls of Norfolk, Bigod * Roger Bigod, 4th Earl of Norfolk (1209‚Äì1270) He died childless. * Hugh Bigod (1212‚Äì1266), Justiciar of England. Married Joan de Stuteville, by whom he had issue. * Isabel Bigod (c. 1215‚Äì1250), married firstly Gilbert de Lacy of Ewyas Lacy, by whom she had issue; she married secondly John Fitzgeoffrey, Lord of Shere, by whom she had issue. * Ralph Bigod (born c. 1218, date of death unknown), married Bertha de Furnival, by whom he had one child. Contrary to the assertion of Frederick Lewis Weis, Ancestral Roots, there is no evidence for a fourth son called Simon Bigod. A man of that name appears as a witness to one of Earl Hugh's charters (Morris, HBII 2), but as the eighteenth name in a list of twenty, suggesting no close connection to the main branch of the family. He is also named among the knights who surrendered to King John at Framlingham Castle in 1216. He was probably a descendant of Hugh or William Bigod, half-brothers to Earl Roger II Bigod. Hugh Bigod died in 1225. Maud married her second husband, William de Warenne, 5th Earl of Surrey before 13 October that same year. Together they had two children: * Isabella de Warenne (c. 1228 ‚Äì before 20 September 1282), married Hugh d'Aubigny, 5th Earl of Arundel.

Maud's second husband died in 1240. Her youngest son John succeeded his father as the 6th Earl of Surrey, but as he was a minor, Peter of Savoy, uncle of Queen consort Eleanor of Provence, was guardian of his estates.

He became widely recognized for his work starting in the 1930s, when he received the Benaki Prize from the Athens Academy. The recipient of a Guggenheim Prize for Greece (in 1960), Spyros Vassiliou's works have been exhibited in galleries throughout Europe, in the United States, and Canada . Art The townsmen of Galaxidi, where Vassiliou was born, collected money to send him to Athens in 1921, to study at the Athens School of Fine Arts under teachers Alexandros Kaloudis and Nikolaos Lytras. In 1929, Vassiliou held his first individual exhibition, and in 1930 he was awarded the Benaki Prize for his design of Saint Dionysios Church in Kolonaki, Athens. During this time he was also a founding member of the art groups ‚ÄùTechni\\" and \\"Stathmi\\". He represented Greece at the Venice Biennale in 1934 and 1964, exhibited in Alexandria in 1957, and at the S√£o Paulo Art Biennial in 1959. In 1955 he designed and painted the interior of Saint Konstantinos Orthodox church of Detroit. In 1960 his autobiographical work, Lights & Shadows, was exhibited in the Guggenheim Museum. In 1975 and 1983 his work was presented in a retrospective exhibition in the National Art Gallery and Alexandros Soutzos Museum. Spyros Vassiliou became recognized as a painter of the transformation of the modern urban environment, depicting with an unwavering eye the sprawl of urban development that surrounded his home in Athens, under the walls of the Parthenon. His artistic identity combined monochrome backgrounds and the unorthodox positioning of objects. He paid homage to the Byzantine icon by floating symbols of everyday Greek life on washes of gold or sea-blue color, very much like the religious symbols that float on gold in religious art. With oils and watercolours he painted natural and urban space, portraits, still-life, and scenes of daily living, combining selective elements of cubism and impressionism. A member of an important community of Greek artists in the mid-20th century, Vassiliou was known as one of the first Greek pop-art painters. Gallery Other activities For many years Vassiliou taught theatre. As early as 1927 he designed sets and costumes for the stage. He also worked in film. Well known projects include Michalis Kakoyiannis' 1962 adaptation of Euripedes, and Elektra, starring Irene Papas and close friend Manos KatrakisElectra (1962) - Full Cast & Crew - IMDb. During the years of the German occupation of Greece (1941-1945), when painting supplies were scarce, Vassiliou turned to engraving and woodcuts. Works such as The Burial of Palamas and The Mourning of the Kalavrytans (1943) became famous in Greece as symbols of freedom. His activity during those years also included the illustration and underground publication of three manuscript volumes as well as woodcut prints for magazines.

Located on both banks of the river Hnizna Hnyla upper part of Hnizna ‚Äì left tributaries of Seret, 12 km east of Ternopil. The rivers Terebna and Hnizdechna flow through the territory of the urban village ‚Äì the left and right are tributaries of Hnizna Hnyla.  Name  The modern name, Birky, comes from the ancient Slavonic word ‚Äúbor‚Äù, which means pine forest. In the 15th century the village was called Borky, in the 16th-17th centuries it was called the City of Borek, in the second half of the 17th century it was called Podborye village, in the 18th-20th centuries it was called Borky Velyki, in 1967 it was known as Velyki Birky village, and finally from May 27, 1978 it was known as the urban village of Velyki Birky.  History  The first documentation of the settlement was in 1410 during the reign of King Vladislav II Jogaila. The document belonged to the Polish Crown. Petro Vladkovych, the Podilskiy and Terebovlyansky village elder, confirmed the border which separated the village Chernyliv (now Cherneliv-Ruskyi) from Borek in Terebovlia on March 10, 1410. However, in the Ruskyi Chronicle a battle is mentioned which involved the Russo-Galician army and Mongols in 1243 which occurred in Borek. Therefore, this might be the first mention of Velyki Birky or the territory where it is located. Polish sources state that in 15th-16th centuries the district of Borek along with four other surrounding villages belonged to the Terebovlya district of the Galician territories which belonged to the polish crown. On June 15, 1530 Yan Srochytsky, one of the village elders, obtained from King Sigizmund I the Elder the right to found a town based on the Magdeburg Charter in the area of the village of Borek. However, Srochytsky did not have time to found a town and was forced to give up these holdings to Mykola Senyavsky to whom the King gave the right to buy the village of Borek along with the villages of Dychkiv, Khodachkiv (later Kochava and now Malyi Khodachkiv), Haluschyntsi and Zadnyshivka (later destroyed by the Tatars). The village was in his possession close to thirty years, however Senyavsky, having obtained many other districts and become a Hetman (lord) in service to the crown, did not get attached to the village. From 1565, during the rule of King Sigizmund Augustus II, the town of Borek along with neighboring villages became the property of Mykola Pototsky, the King‚Äôs steward of the Kamianets Castle, and remained in the hands of the Pototsky family for over a century. During the rule of the Austro-Hungarian Empire until 1918, the town belonged to the Ternopil district of the kingdom of Galicia and Lodomeria. By the end of the 18th century the town of Borek was ruled by Count Victor Zalesky and later Count Franz Vodzitsky. From the mid-19th century the village of Velyki Birky was the property of the Counties of Bavorovsky and Mitrovsky. October 22, 1849 an elementary school was founded. With the initiative of nationalists and especially Oleksander Barvinsky, one of the first reading rooms of Prosvita in the Ternopil district was founded in 1899 and lasted until 1939. Until the middle of 1914 the paramilitary organizations of Sich and Sokil were active in Velyki Birky. During World War I from July 21, 1914 to June 25, 1917 Velyki Birky was under Russian occupation as part of the Ternopil Governance of the Galicia-Bukovina General- Governance. From November 1, 1918 to June 17, 1919 the village was part of ZUNR (Zakhidno-Ukrayinska Narodna Respublica or Western-Ukrainian People's Republic). During the Russo-Polish war of 1920, from June 26 to August 21 the village is a part of Halyts‚Äôka Social Soviet Republic. August 1, 1921 Velyki Birky became part of the Ternopil district as a regional center. During the German Nazi occupation (July 2, 1941- March 21, 1944) Velyki Birky was the center of the Ternopil area, the Galicia District, General Governance, and the Third Reich. December 4, 1939 the urban village becomes part of Ternopil Region of USSR. Later, from January 1, 1940 to July 2, 1941 and from March 21, 1944 to January 1, 1963, it is the center of the Velykobirkivsky district of the Ternopil Region. In 1963-1967 the village of Velyki Birky became part of Pidvolochys‚Äôky district, and from January 1, 1967 till the present it is part of the Ternopil district.  Castle  Certainly the oldest historical monument of Velyki Birky could be a defensive castle of the 16th - 17th centuries. The castle suffered damage due to repeated attacks of Tatars. In the summer of 1649 the small town of Borek and the castle were completely destroyed by the Tatars. This was during the time of the Siege of Zbarazh and the Treaty of Zboriv. The town belonged to Mykola Pototskyi, a crowned Hetman, who at one point was also a prisoner of the Tatars. What remained of the castle was a square earthen rampart, a house belonging to the steward of the lordly estate which was rebuilt in the 19th century where the old castles gate used to be. Also, deep clay cellars were left from when hundreds of people would hide during attacks. Now this area is a school and preschool.  Railway Station  Between 1869 and 1871 the Carl Ludwig Galician railway company was building a rail line from L‚Äôviv to Ternopil which was intended to connect the inner regions of Austria-Hungary with the railway network of Russia. Soon between Ternopil and Pidvolochysk many new engineering, research, and building projects were started to help the laying of the railway line, altering of the course of the River Terebna, and the building of bridges which still exist today. One line of this railway network went through Velyki Birky. On Karl Ludwig‚Äôs Day, November 4, 1871, the railway connecting Ternopil to Pidvolochysk and across the Austro-Russian border to Volochysk was officially opened. A few years later, in 1875, the railway station, Birky Velyki, was built on the territory of Velyki Birky. On August 12, 1898 another, local, 47 kilometer long, railway connecting Hrymailiv to Birky Velyki was opened. During the occupation in the fall of 1941 the Organisation Todt forced the Red Army POWs to finish building a two-line railway from Ternopil to Pidvolochysk, construction of which was started in 1940. In 1998, on Independence day, a new 50-kilometer-long electrically powered network of railways between Ternopil and Pidvolochysk was opened.

It consists of two earthen mounds with crosses on top and a memorial plaque with ‚ÄúHere fell the sons of Ukraine for her freedom, here is our history, glory, and honor.‚Äù The left mound with a birch cross was made in memory of the fallen Ukrainian Sich Riflemen and soldiers of the UGA. The right one is the sight of the reburial of 34 imprisoned soldiers of the UPA, OUN partisans, and hostages killed by the SS in the village in 1944. The architect was Pavlo Halokha. *On Sunday, June 14, 1995, in the center of town, a memorial to Taras Shevchenko was officially opened. It was funded by donations from the citizens as well as local companies. The sculptor was M. Nevesely. The architect was P. Halokha. *In March 1998 on the central building of the secondary school named after Stepan Baley a memorial plaque was installed.  Churches  According to historical sources, one of the first buildings of the Church of Saint Paraskeva was built in the middle of the 16th century. This building was mostly likely made of wood. Later in the 17th‚Äî18th centuries the architectural style and building materials were constantly being changed. This was primarily because during the times of the Tartar and Turkish invasions the church was constantly being damaged and even completely destroyed. But despite all the troubles the Church persistently rose from the ruins. The Church was always rebuilt in exactly the same spot. At the end of the 19th century the village community decided to build a new stone church building on the same spot as before. The church was built by the faithful parishioners, their donations and the donation of Countess Maria Mitrovska. The general construction work was completed in 1901. The church was consecrated in 1902. The Church iconostasis was painted in the twenties by the master of art of the 20th century, Antin Manastyrsky. On December 21, 2003 the bishop of the Ternopil-Zboriv eparchy, Mykhaylo Sabryha, and Abbot Gregory Planchak of the Monastery of St. Theodor the Studite blessed the women‚Äôs monastery of the Presentation of Mary in Velyki Birky.

He was a director of the Elkington Co., Ltd, of Birmingham and London. Politics 1922 Alexander was on the left-wing. He began his political career as a National Liberal, i.e. as a member of that wing of the Liberal Party which supported the Coalition Government 1916-1922 of Prime Minister David Lloyd George. In December 1921 there had been a by-election in Southwark South East which had resulted in the capture of the seat from the Coalition Liberals by Labour. The defeated Liberal candidate, T. O. Jacobsen, decided not to contest the seat again at the 1922 general election and Alexander stepped into the breach gaining it back for the Liberals in a straight fight with Labour's successful by-election candidate Thomas Ellis Naylor with a majority of 2,280 votes.F W S Craig, British Parliamentary Elections Results 1918‚Äì1949; Political Reference Publications, Glasgow, 1949 p50 1923 The next general election followed quickly in 1923 on the issue of whether to reintroduce or 'reform' tariffs and following Bonar Law's death. By this time the Lloyd George National/Coalition Liberals had reunited with the Independent Liberals led by former Prime Minister H. H. Asquith. In Southwark South East, Alexander standing as a Liberal (without prefix) had another straight fight with Naylor. Although the 1923 general election was largely successful for the reunited Liberals, bringing it 30% of the popular vote and 158 seats, this was almost entirely at the expense of the Conservatives in rural and suburban seats. The story against Labour in working class and industrial seats was very different.David Dutton, A History of the Liberal Party in the Twentieth Century; Palgrave Macmillan, 2004 p92 Alexander lost his seat to Naylor by a majority of 1,490 votes. 1924 The 1923 general election brought to power the first Labour government and the Liberal Party in Parliament found itself divided over whether to support it. During the short life of the government the Liberals were badly split on key votes, presenting a picture of disunity and political incoherence to the electorate.Chris Cook, A Short History of the Liberal Party, 1900‚Äì1992; Macmillan, 1993 p99 At the 1924 general election Alexander decided to cut his ties with Southwark and stood instead as Liberal candidate in North Norfolk. This was the seat of Noel Buxton a former Liberal who had defected to Labour. Alexander came a poor third in the contest, losing his deposit.F W S Craig, British Parliamentary Elections Results 1918‚Äì1949; Political Reference Publications, Glasgow, 1949 p433 1929‚Äì1931 Alexander did not contest the 1929 general election, apparently reverting to his law practice in London but in 1931, perhaps influenced by his defeat by Buxton, he surfaced as the Labour candidate in Newcastle upon Tyne East. However, in a straight fight with the sitting MP, the Liberal National Sir Robert Aske he lost by the wide margin of 10,346 votes. National candidate Alexander did not contest any further Parliamentary elections but in 1938 it was reported that he was likely to be selected as the candidate of the National Government in the constituency of Bermondsey West in opposition to the sitting Labour MP, Alfred Salter.The Times, 17 February 1938 p11 The intervention of the Second World War meant the general election due to be held by 1940 was postponed and Alexander did not get to contest Bermondsey.

Thompson (1921-2000) was an American inventor and businessman who held many patents in the pumping industry and is credited with the invention of the rotary pump. His many inventions and pioneering spirit led to the creation of Thompson Pump & Manufacturing company.Int'l Rental News History George A. Thompson was born in 1921 in Drumwright, Oklahoma. Like many other industry pioneers, he grew up in poverty during the great depression. George Thompson was a self-taught civil and mechanical engineer with limited formal advanced education but with extensive U.S. Navy schooling. Mr. Thompson was a veteran of the U. S. Navy during World War II where he plied the North Atlantic Ocean. Career Beginnings During his long and varied career, he worked for the Civilian Conservation Corps, for the Army Corps of Engineers; as a surveyor; and also for ITT/Federal Electric Corporation in support of the Apollo Project which produced the first manned lunar landing. He entered the construction equipment industry in 1946 in New York City where he realized that many of the products and techniques of pumping and dewatering were inefficient. He moved from Long Island City, New York in 1951 to Daytona Beach, Florida. In 1970, he founded the Thompson Pump and Manufacturing Company in Port Orange, FL which has grown to international prominence under his direction. Mr. Thompson spent 1946 through 1965 and 1970 ‚Äì 1999, totaling 48 years in the business. He remained active in the family‚Äôs business until a year before dying in May 2000.

A pioneer and trailblazer, he invented and patented many unique and innovative products and techniques which improved the construction equipment industry. Contributions Mr. Thompson introduced the Vacuum Well and Filtervac pipe to the industry. Though he did not formally patent these designs, he created them and used them in innovative ways. These types of underdrain pipes were able to draw vacuum without collapsing, which enabled them to attach to a pump to dewater a construction site. His development of the first self-priming rotary pump revolutionized wellpoint dewatering methods. He has contributed greatly to his industry. In total, Mr. Thompson holds seven U.S. patents directly related to the construction equipment industry. Creation of Thompson Pump & Manufacturing Company Today, because of George A. Thompson, Thompson Pump and Manufacturing is known worldwide for its different lines of high quality pumps, ranging in size from 2 to 18 inches. Thompson Pump sells and rents their entire line of pumps to the areas of public works, municipalities, construction, agriculture, dewatering, mining, sewer/lift stations, and water/waste water. Types of pumps engineered include wet prime trash pumps; dry prime trash pumps with compressor-assisted or vacuum-assisted priming systems; sound attenuated pumps; utility trash pumps; diaphragm pumps; hydraulic power units with submersible pump ends; rotary, vacuum and piston wellpoint pumps and high pressure jet pumps. In addition, Thompson provides engineering services and special applications consulting for complicated wellpoint, bypass or multiple pump systems; and offers thorough pump and dewatering education and training through its Pumpology courses.

It was invented by Pomors, the inhabitants of the coasts of the White and Barents Seas. The Bird of Happiness is made without glue or other fasteners, by carving thin petals for the bird's wings and tail and then using a special method of spreading and curving them, also found in other products of the North Russian handicraft. The amulet is usually made of pine, fir, spruce, or Siberian cedar. It is suspended inside a house, guarding the family hearth and well-being. Wood chip bird is a carved wooden item with thin wavy plumage of the wings. The plumage and tail of these birds were usually made of split pine, that is why the birds were called \\"wood chip\\". The place of the wooden toy origin in the form of a bird is the Arkhangelsk region. It's also called a \\"Pomor dove\\". According to legends wood chip bird brings many benefits to the house. In addition, this bird is the symbol of the sun. The bird was hung in the house as the hearth and well-being keeper. These birds used to hang in almost every home of a farmer in the icon corner, above the dining table, opposite the Russian stove or over a child's cradle. From the movement of warm air they revolved in a circle. The history of the bird: In the far North in Arkhangelsk province, there lived a hunter. Winter in the North is long and cold: snowstorm, blizzard and freezing cold. This year the winter stayed for a long time and cooled the hunter's house completely and the hunter's younger son fell ill. He was ill for a long time, got very thin and pale; neither doctors nor wise men could help him. The hunter grieved. He felt sorry for the little boy. The hunter asked his son: ‚ÄúWhat do you want?‚Äù The boy whispered quietly: ‚ÄúI want to see the sun...‚Äù. And where can you get the sun in the North? The hunter was lost in thoughts, heated the furnace to warm the house. But the fire is not the sun. Suddenly the hunter noticed a splinter that was glowing in the fire. A smile lit up his face; and he knew how to help his son. The hunter was working all the night. He carved a wood bird, made wood chips, decorated them with fretwork. He hung the bird above his son's bed, and the bird suddenly came to life: it began spinning and moving in the hot air that was coming from the furnace. The boy woke up, smiled and exclaimed: ‚ÄúWell, here is the sun!‚Äù From that day on, the child began to recover rapidly. So, miraculous power was attributed to the wood chip bird and it was called the ‚ÄúHoly spirit‚Äù, the guardian of children, the symbol of family happiness.

Construction was initiated in September 1943, after Allied forces seized control of the Tavoliere plain around Foggia, Apulia, Italy.Abandoned & Little-Known Airfields: Italy, Apulia Foggia The only known use of the airfield was by the Fifteenth Air Force 483d Bombardment Group, which arrived from Tortorella Airfield, Italy on 22 April 1944.

The 483d Bomb Group consisted of four B-17 Flying Fortress squadrons: * 815th Bombardment Squadron * 816th Bombardment Squadron * 817th Bombardment Squadron * 840th Bombardment Squadron The airfield had a single, 6,000' x 100' asphalt runway, oriented 10/28 with two perimeter tracks, each containing about 50 aircraft parking hardstands. There may have been some temporary hangars and buildings; however, it appears that personnel were quartered primarily in tents, and most aircraft maintenance took place in the open on hardstands. It also had a steel control tower. The 483d departed after the end of the war, moving to Pisa Airport for service with Air Transport Command on 15 May 1945.

It was co-written by Tarr and his frequent collaborator L√°szl√≥ Krasznahorkai. It recalls the whipping of a horse in the Italian city Turin that is rumoured to have caused the mental breakdown of philosopher Friedrich Nietzsche. The film is in black-and-white, shot in only 30 long takes by Tarr's regular cameraman Fred Kelemen,The Turin Horse, by Jonathan Romney, Screen Daily, 15 February 2011 and depicts the repetitive daily lives of the horse-owner and his daughter. The film was an international co-production led by the Hungarian company T. T. Filmm≈±hely. Tarr announced then that it was to be his last film. After having been postponed several times, it premiered in 2011 at the 61st Berlin International Film Festival, where it received the Jury Grand Prix. The Hungarian release was postponed after the director had criticised the country's government in an interview. The Turin Horse opened to general acclaim from film critics.  Plot  The film begins with a narrator explaining German philosopher Friedrich Nietzsche's infamous mental breakdown in Turin, Italy in 1889 after seeing a man continually whip his horse, which yet refused to move. After uttering his final words, \\"Mutter, ich bin dumm\\" (\\"mother, I am stupid\\"), Nietzsche becomes mute and demented, cared for by his family until his death a decade later. The film focuses on a pair of impoverished potato farmers, father and daughter, and their horse (stated by the narrator, literally or metaphorically, to be the same one seen by Nietzsche) living in the 19th century countryside where a violent wind blows unremittingly. They live out an arduous and repetitive existence defined by nihilistic despair; they often take turns sitting by the window alone. The horse is increasingly uncooperative, refusing to leave the property or eat and drink. A neighbour visits to trade some goods; he claims that the nearby town has been completely destroyed, and blames the apocalyptic scenario on both God and man. Later, a band of gypsies arrives and drains the farmers' well of water. The father decides they must abandon the farm; the two pack and depart with the horse behaving uncharacteristically well, but return home and unpack shortly after leaving for unspecified reasons. They remove the horse's reins and shut it in the barn. The world then plunges into complete darkness; the two try to light lamps but find they quickly extinguish, even the coals. The next day, the winds can no longer be heard inside the house. Now subsisting on raw potatoes, the daughter refuses to eat or talk, seemingly resigning to her fate. The father appears to follow, not finishing his potato and sitting with his daughter in silence.  Cast  * J√°nos Derzsi as stableman * Erika B√≥k as daughter of the stableman * Mih√°ly Kormos as Bernhard the neighbor * Mih√°ly R√°day as narrator  Themes  Director B√©la Tarr says that the film is about the \\"heaviness of human existence\\". The focus is not on mortality, but rather the daily life: \\"We just wanted to see how difficult and terrible it is when every day you have to go to the well and bring the water, in summer, in winter... All the time. The daily repetition of the same routine makes it possible to show that something is wrong with their world. It's very simple and pure.\\" Tarr has also described The Turin Horse as the last step in a development throughout his career: \\"In my first film I started from my social sensibility and I just wanted to change the world. Then I had to understand that problems are more complicated. Now I can just say it‚Äôs quite heavy and I don‚Äôt know what is coming, but I can see something that is very close ‚Äì the end.\\" According to Tarr, the book the daughter receives is an \\"anti-Bible\\". The text was an original work by the film's writer, L√°szl√≥ Krasznahorkai, and contains references to Nietzsche. Tarr described the visitor in the film as \\"a sort of Nietzschean shadow\\". As Tarr elaborated, the man differs from Nietzsche in that he is not claiming that God is dead, but rather puts blame on both humans and God: \\"The key point is that the humanity, all of us, including me, are responsible for destruction of the world. But there is also a force above human at work ‚Äì the gale blowing throughout the film ‚Äì that is also destroying the world. So both humanity and a higher force are destroying the world.\\"  Production  The idea for the film had its origin in the mid 1980s, when Tarr heard Krasznahorkai retell the story of Nietzsche's breakdown, and ended it by asking what happened to the horse. Tarr and Krasznahorkai then wrote a short synopsis for such a story in 1990, but put it away in favour of making S√°t√°ntang√≥. Krasznahorkai eventually wrote The Turin Horse in prose text after the production of the duo's previous film, the troublesome The Man from London. The Turin Horse never had a conventional screenplay, and Krasznahorkai's prose was what the filmmakers used to find financial partners. The Turin Horse was produced by Tarr's Hungarian company T. T. Filmm≈±hely, in collaboration with Switzerland's Vega Film Production, Germany's Zero Fiction Film and France's MPM Film. It also had American involvement through the Minneapolis-based company Werc Werk Works. The project received 240,000 euro from Eurimages and 100,000 euro from Medienboard Berlin- Brandenburg. Filming was located to a valley in Hungary. The house, well and stable were all built specifically for the film, and were not artificial sets but proper structures of stone and wood. The supposed 35-day shoot was set to take place during the months of November and December 2008. However because of adverse weather conditions, principal photography was not finished until 2010.  Release  Tarr announced at the premiere of The Man from London that he was retiring from filmmaking and that his upcoming project would be his last. The Turin Horse was originally planned to be finished in April 2009 and ready to be screened at the 2009 Cannes Film Festival. After several delays, it was finally announced as a competition title at the 61st Berlin International Film Festival, where it premiered on 15 February 2011. The Turin Horse was originally set to be released in Hungary on 10 March 2011 through the distributor Mokep. However, in an interview with the German newspaper Der Tagesspiegel on 20 February, Tarr accused the Hungarian government of obstructing artists and intellectuals, in what he referred to as a \\"culture war\\" led by the cabinet of Viktor Orb√°n. As a consequence to these comments, Mokep cancelled its release of the film. It eventually premiered in Hungary on 31 March 2011 instead. It was distributed in five prints through a collaboration between Cirko Film and M√°sk√©pp Alap√≠tv√°ny. Home media The film was released on DVD and Blu-ray through The Cinema Guild on 17 July 2012. Reception Critical response The Turin Horse received critical acclaim. At Metacritic, the film received an average score of 80/100, based on 15 reviews, which indicates \\"generally favorable reviews\\". The film holds an 89% \\"Certified Fresh\\" rating on the review aggregator Rotten Tomatoes based on 61 reviews, with an average rating of 8.09/10. The critical consensus states, \\"Uncompromisingly bold and hauntingly beautiful, Bela Tarr's bleak parable tells a simple story with weighty conviction.\\" Mark Jenkins of NPR described the film as \\"... an absolute vision, masterly and enveloping in a way that less personal, more conventional movies are not.\\" A. O. Scott of The New York Times lavished the film with praise, concluding, \\"The rigors of life can grind you down. The rigor of art can have the opposite effect, and The Turin Horse is an example ‚Äî an exceedingly rare one in contemporary cinema ‚Äî of how a work that seems built on the denial of pleasure can, through formal discipline, passionate integrity and terrifying seriousness, produce an experience of exaltation. The movie is too beautiful to be described as an ordeal, but it is sufficiently intense and unyielding that when it is over, you may feel, along with awe, a measure of relief. Which may sound like a reason to stay away, but is exactly the opposite.\\" Ray Bennett of The Hollywood Reporter wrote from the Berlinale: \\"Fans of Tarr‚Äôs somber and sedate films will know what they are in for and will no doubt find the time well spent. Others might soon grow weary of measured pace of the characters as they dress in their ragged clothes, eat boiled potatoes with their fingers, fetch water, clean their bowls, chop wood and feed the horse.\\" Bennett complimented the cinematography, but added: \\"That does not, however, make up for the almost complete lack of information about the two characters, and so it is easy to become indifferent to their fate, whatever it is.\\" Variety's Peter Debruge also noted how the narrative provided \\"little to cling to\\", but wrote: \\"Like Hiroshi Teshigahara's life-changingly profound The Woman in the Dunes ... by way of Bresson, Tarr's tale seems to depict the meaning of life in a microcosm, though its intentions are far more oblique. ... As the premise itself concerns the many stories not being told (Nietzsche is nowhere to be found, for instance), it's impossible to keep the mind from drifting to all the other narratives unfolding beyond the film's sparse horizon.\\" Accolades The film won the Jury Grand Prix Silver Bear and the Competition FIPRESCI Prize at the Berlin Film Festival. It was selected as the Hungarian entry for the Best Foreign Language Film at the 84th Academy Awards, but it did not make the final shortlist. Tiny Mix Tapes named it the best film of 2012.

Board of Education, Emerson was named by Newsweek as its first bureau chief responsible for covering the South. In that role, Emerson witnessed the \\"years of resistance and violence\\" that ensued following the end of segregation in public schools and the start of the fight for civil rights for African Americans. In that role, Emerson covered school integration battles across the South, including in such cities as New Orleans and Memphis, Tennessee, and provided his direct observations of a woman trying to take her child to school and encountering a crowd spitting and yelling at them.

It focuses on a kinder perspective of society's outcasts, which includes recovering mental patients.YesAsia's Professional Review of Ten Days In The Madhouse Every song title in this album have a running theme of 4-character, taken from famous names of real celebrities and fictitious characters. The album was released in conjunction with Ho's documentary DVD titled \\"The Decameron\\" (ÂçÅÊó•Ë´á). Development and Inspiration During the promotion of her third greatest hits album, \\"Goomusic Collection 2004-2008\\", Ho mentioned that she wanted to embrace social messages in her future work rather than telling her own stories. Since then, she started doing a lot of research with her long-time collaborator Yan Yan Mak who has previously worked with Ho and produced highly acclaimed music videos of Ho's. Ho became interested in the problem of lack of awareness towards the mentally disabled in Hong Kong and decided to embrace this in her then-upcoming album and the documentary \\"The Decameron\\". Since the project involved the topic \\"mental disability\\" or what Hong Kong people would simply describe as craziness, she recruited the composer Hanjin Tan, who is well known for his non-commercial style music, and her elder brother Harris Ho, who is a formally trained musician, to be responsible for the composition and song-production of all the songs on the album. Content of the Album Singles The album spawned 3 singles. Ho's prefer to release songs with more positive messages rather than the rest which question about different social phenomenon in Hong Kong. Thelma from the Castle Peak is the first single released to radio. This song describes the main character of the album, Thelma, who is a patient in the oldest psychiatric hospital of Hong Kong, Castle Peak Hospital. Ho sings about how bad she wants to be like Thelma, whose way of thinking is much simpler and innocent compared to all the \\"normal\\" people in the rest of the world. This song shows that Ho is capable of reaching very high note, which was thought to be a difficult task for Ho to achieve due her low voice. It also showcases her improved interpretation towards a song. The cracked voice at the very end of the song was a new attempt for Ho. Misora Hibari, the second single, is a tribute to the child living in Sham Shui Po District, one of the improvished areas of Hong Kong. The song's title literally means \\"birds under the beautiful sky\\". The birds are the metaphor to those children, who possess hindered talent and innocent hearts Charlie and Cherrie was sent to radio as the third single. This song is a praise to a couple Ho met during her research session. The couple have been recovering from mental illness. They met and fell in love with each other when one day Charlie saw Cherrie being raped by some street stalker and saved her from the incident. Their love was described as zero selfishness by Ho.

It is about 11 miles long and 1 mile wide with a surface area of 10.8 square miles (27.8 square kilometres). Pelican Lake is relatively shallow with a mean depth of 3.8 metres and a maximum of 5.2 metres and holds 108 billion liters when the lake is at a surface water level of 412.0 metres. The lake is regulated with a normal summer target level of 412.0 metres. The lake is fed by several small waterways the main one being the Orthez drain. The total drainage area is 686 square kilometres (265 square miles) The lake has been a popular recreational area since the turn of the 20th century when trains brought visitors, cottagers and campers from Brandon and Winnipeg. The lake area is popular for boating, sailing, fishing, a wide variety of water activities, cottagers and home owners. The town of Ninette is at the north end of the lake. Ninette is less than a one-hour drive to Brandon, or 2 hour drive to Winnipeg. The lake is located in the Rural Municipalities of Turtle Mountain and Prairie Lakes.  Pelican Lake Regulation Project  The Pelican Lake Regulation Project was constructed in 1990-1992 to control water levels on Pelican Lake. The project includes a channel and control structure to divert water into the lake from the Pembina River when lake levels are low, and another channel and control structure to discharge water from the lake to the river when Pelican Lake levels are high. (See map) These works are operated by Manitoba Infrastructure and Transportation under rules provided through an Environment Act Licence. Advice on the operation of the inlet and outlet works is provided by the Pelican Lake Advisory Committee. The lake is normally maintained at elevations between 411.5 metres (1350.2 feet) and 412 metres (1351.7 feet) above sea level during summer months. During the spring period, the lake may be raised temporarily to an elevation of 412.2 metres (1352.4 feet). When the lake is low, water may be diverted from the Pembina River into the lake through an inlet diversion channel. The maximum rate of diversion into the lake is approximately 9 cubic metres per second (320 cubic feet per second). Diversions into the lake are not allowed when flow in the Pembina River is less than 0.4 cms (15 cubic feet per second), and diversions are not started in the spring until Lorne and Louise lakes have filled to an elevation of 1338.9 feet. When desired, water from Pelican Lake may be discharged into the Pembina River through an outlet diversion channel. The maximum rate of diversion out of the lake is approximately 11 cms (390 cubic feet per second), and releases cannot be made without a licence variance if the combined outflow from the lake and flow in the Pembina River exceeds 700 cubic feet per second. When the diversion into the lake is operated at full capacity for one day, an increase in lake level of approximately 1.2 inches will result. When water is being diverted out of the lake, operation of the outlet at full capacity for one day will result in a lowering of the lake level of approximately 1.5 inches. This calculation assumes no inflow into the lake and that Pembina River flows are low enough to allow the entire outlet capacity of the diversion to be used. In fact, a considerable amount of inflow enters the lake in most years, and releases from Pelican Lake are often limited by high flows in the Pembina River. Although the works were primarily built to raise the lake level from its low of 1346.0 in 1991. Its real value came in the wet period from 1995 to 2017 when the equivalent of over 50 feet on the lake was diverted out, preventing serious flooding in many years of that period. From 1962 to 1994 the median annual inflow was equivalent to about 6.5 inches on the lake. From 1995 to 2017 it was 32.6 inches per year.

History  A railway halt at Breese am Sei√üelberge was first mentioned in August 1869 in an explanatory report about preparations for the construction of the Wittenberge-Buchholz branch. At the time only a halt was planned ‚Äì and it would have been the only one on the line; all the other stopping points were stations. When the construction of the line was already well under way and the opening of the section to Hitzacker was imminent in October 1873, the first designs for a station at Breese were unfolded by the Berlin-Hamburg Railway. It was intended from the outset as the reception station for the emperor's hunting parties and was built in the following year, 1874. The station was ceremonially opened on 26 November 1874 on the occasion of the first visit by the German Emperor. The construction of the railway and the station at the northern end of the former Rundling village of Breese am Sei√üelberge, along with its associated road that ran parallel to the railway, changed the appearance of the village and gave it a rectangular shape. With the end of the monarchy in Germany in 1918, the heyday of the station was over and no more hunting parties or high-ranking personalities arrived. From then on the station, and particularly the station building, were fully used for railway operations and were modified several times thereafter. During the time of the Third Reich the Nazi leadership and the Reichsbahn management certainly had further plans to use the station for high-ranking occasions and thus to double the size of the station buildings, but they did not come to fruition. Allegedly Hermann G√∂ring did not consent to hunting in the G√∂hrde. During the Reichsbahn era the station was an operating point that reported to the railway office at Wittenberge and belonged to the Hamburg Reichsbahn division. It was grouped into the fourth and lowest category (by comparison L√ºneburg was a first class station, Dahlenburg third class and Dannenberg Ost second class). After the Second World War, through traffic over the river Elbe was severed and the importance of the line shrank to a regional railway, just serving L√ºchow-Dannenberg district. At the same time the use of private transport gained increasing momentum. In the post-war years the Deutsche Bundesbahn concentrated on the functional preservation of the station and on simplifying railway operations. The preservation of the historic buildings faded into the background. In 1979 the Deutsche Bundesbahn sold the station building in a run-down state to the G√∂hrde Station Child and Youth Training Centre. The station was placed under conservation protection in 1981 and work began on its restoration in 1983. The interior of the station building was converted into a training centre and restored to its original historic appearance externally. In 1989 the last downgrading of the station facilities was carried out. Its goods facilities were closed and G√∂hrde became no more than a passenger halt. In 2004 the district of L√ºneburg joined the Hamburg Transport Network (Hamburger Verkehrsverbund or HVV). Since 12 December 2004 the halt has been the easternmost railway station in the HVV's fare zone.  Imperial station  G√∂hrde station in Breese am Sei√üelberge on the Wittenberge‚ÄìBuchholz branch (1891). From 1871 the German emperor, Wilhelm I, went hunting every year with a large entourage in the G√∂hrde. In the early years he and his hunting party travelled from Berlin via Lehrte to Bevensen, a station that lay on the Hanover‚ÄìHamburg railway about 24 kilometres from the hunting lodge at G√∂hrde. The last part of the journey had to be made by coach. The Wittenberge‚ÄìBuchholz branch was opened as far as Hitzacker on 15 December 1873\\\\. From 1874 the imperial hunting party no longer travelled to the G√∂hrde via Bevensen, but via Wittenberge and Breese, as the station for the G√∂hrde was originally called. Breese station is about 4.5 kilometres from the hunting lodge. This final part of the route was initially traversed by coach and, later, by motor vehicle. The first imperial hunting part travelled on 26 November 1874, before the official opening of the whole line on 31 December 1874\\\\. For that reason the section from Hitzacker to Breese am Sei√üelberge was taken over by the police on 20 or 24 November 1874\\\\. The royal train, comprising three passenger coaches and a luggage van left Berlin at 14.30 and crossed the bridge over the Elbe at D√∂mitz at 17.25. At Dannenberg and Hitzacker the train halted briefly for official receptions. Special regulations governed the transportation of royalty and VIPs. The railway staff were sworn to secrecy and all documents had to be destroyed after the journey. Reserve locomotives had to be made available at certain stations and these engines had to be facing the direction of travel of the train and ready to move as long as the royal train was in their district. The engine driver and fireman were not permitted to leave the locomotive during this time. During the journey, the train was not allowed to be subject to any impacts or heavy swaying movements. The place at which the train was to stop in the station was indicated by an official with an unfurled red flag or, during the hours of darkness, by a red light. The station was decorated ceremonially for the visit and a red carpet was laid out from the platform through the west wing of the station to the exit on the station forecourt. There was always a large crowd of the local population because everyone wanted to see the emperor. The governor's office (Landdrostei) in L√ºneburg was responsible for the safety of the imperial household. During the first visit of the emperor, two sergeants (Oberwachtmeister), seven mounted gendarmes and four gendarmes on foot were employed as guards. The last imperial hunt in the G√∂hrde region took place before the outbreak of the First World War on 30 and 31 October 1913\\\\. Emperor Wilhelm II had invited his sons - the princes Eitel Friedrich of Prussia, Oskar of Prussia and Joachim of Prussia - the heir to the Austrian throne, Archduke Franz Ferdinand of Austria, the Reich Chancellor, Theobald von Bethmann Hollweg, General Helmuth Johannes Ludwig von Moltke and the Austro-Hungarian ambassador, Ladislaus de Sz√∂gy√©ny-Marich. A very large number of staff were required for the two-day event. There was a total of 90 staff, of which half were part of the emperor's permanent house staff and half were drawn from the local villages. The imperial household had travelled for 2 or 3 days prior to the hunt. In addition the invited guests brought with them one, or at most, two, servants.

The goods facilities are mostly to be found north of the tracks and there are two signal boxes: one at the western and one at the eastern approach to the station. The entire station and its approach has been placed under protection.  Station building  The three-storey station building comprises a centre section with a gable frontage, and two wings, one and a half storeys high, with gables at the ends. It was built in brick with timber framing. Its wooden carvings were intended to give it the appearance of a hunting lodge. The offices are in the centre of the building. The west wing was reserved for VIPs, and there were two waiting rooms in the east wing. One waiting room was available to all travellers, while the other could be reserved in order to avoid having to mix with ordinary people. On the first floor of the centre section was a flat for the stationmaster and on the second floor were two flats for the signalmen. Other station staff lived in the neighbouring village of Pommoissel. West of the station building stood a small shed for handling express goods. East of the station building were three outbuildings: a toilet, a wash house and a stable. The station building was modified several times over the course of the years, the first being in 1909. The attic of the east wing was partially upgraded to take 3 bedrooms. After 1918 the whole building could be used for railway operations or by the railway staff. In 1925/26 a -room flat was built for a gang foreman (Rottenf√ºhrer, a Rotte was a gang of track workers) in the west wing, which in imperial times had been reserved exclusively for VIPs, and cellars were built under half the area of the wing. The public waiting room was converted in 1935 into a station restaurant and the reservable waiting room into the restaurant kitchen. A small beer cellar was established underneath. The usable area of the offices in the central section was halved and used as living quarters (Wohnraum) and a club room (Klubzimmer). In the wings, the dormer windows facing the tracks were replaced by bay windows, the open balcony on the street side was closed in by windows and all the chimney tops were replaced. The fourth modification took place in 1967 during the Deutsche Bundesbahn era and had the widest reaching consequences for the architectural style of the building. The preservation of the old structure took a back seat in favour of a simple functional design. This was most visible in the roof, where the slates were replaced by corrugated asbestos sheets and the dormers on the forecourt side removed. The doors to the balcony on the first floor were replaced by a single-casement window and the conservatories on the second floor were removed, all bar their support frames. Originally the balconies were to have been completely torn down, but for structural reasons that would have taken a great deal of work and so this did not happen on grounds of cost. The two- piece transom windows (Sprossenfenster) on the first floor were almost all replaced by simple single-casement windows. At the end of 1983, the G√∂hrde Station Child and Youth Centre began restoration work on the station building and remaining outbuildings. The work was financially supported by the state of Lower Saxony and the Federal Government and, largely under their own initiative, carried out by workshop projects for unemployed people or by interested individuals. The first phase saw the west wing being restored. The attic was converted into a living and sleeping area for twelve people. On the forecourt and track sides two double-raftered dormers were built and the timber-framed facade and the rooms in the centre section were restored. In the centre section, the balconies were rebuilt and were given copies of the original doors based on an original blueprint. All the windows on the first floor were replaced in order to recreate its former appearance and chimney pots of the original design were added. The old offices on the ground floor were restored to their original dimensions, the station restaurant was renovated and the roof was recovered with slates again. Halt The present-day halt is located immediately west of the old station building. On the former home platform stands a wooden passenger shelter and a timetable poster. Passenger trains stop at what used to be platform 2 and is now platform 1. The platform has a usable length of 142 metres. The halt can be accessed on foot without the use of steps, but the poorly surfaced platform is too low to enable entry to the coaches at the same height. There is a smoking ban at the halt as at all other Deutsche Bahn stations and stops. A small smoking area with a sign at the end of the unmetalled footpath that leads from the approach road alongside private land to the halt, makes the point clear. Goods facilities Opposite the station building there used to be a goods shed and a loading ramp designed for both side- and end-loading. On the loading ramp were cattle pens for loading cattle. Both facilities were located at the end of a loading road, which could be accessed via a level crossing at the western end of the station. Apart from the loading road, there was only an unmetalled farm track on the other side of the level crossing. The loading area up to the old goods shed is still in the ownership of the Deutsche Bahn AG. The goods shed is now privately owned. Track layout The station used to have seven tracks in all. Tracks 1 and 2 were used for passenger trains, tracks 5 to 7 for goods traffic. Track 1 was the main running track on the line and ran alongside the home platform in front of the station building. Between tracks 1 and 2 there was an island platform from which passengers could access the crossing and passing loop - track 2. Track 3 was another crossing and passing loop and track 4 was a storage siding. Track 5 ran alongside the goods shed and loading ramp. Track 6 was a stub siding that ended at the head of the loading ramp. Track 7 was the loading siding alongside the loading road. The first dismantling of the trackage took place in 1956 when the storage siding, track 4, was lifted. In the second half of the 1970s the crossing and passing loop, track 3 and the section of track 5 parallel to the loading siding (track 7) was removed. The goods siding, track 5, and the main running line, track 1, were lifted in 1989. The remaining track 2 was connected directly to the running line at both ends. Signalling and safety equipment The station was protected by ten semaphore signals. At both ends of the station there were a twin-armed entry signal and a distant signal. Exit signals were installed at both ends of tracks 1 to 3. All exit signals were single-armed until the end of the 1930s. The signals on the crossing and passing loops, tracks 2 and 3, were then given a second arm so that the \\"proceed slowly\\" aspect could be displayed. Tracks 4 to 7 were secured by derailers between tracks 3 and 4, so that stored railway vehicles could not inadvertently roll onto the lines being used by through traffic. The level crossing to the loading road was originally gated. The points, signal installations and level crossing barriers were controlled by two signal boxes. The main signal box (Befehlsstellwerk), designated by the letters Gw, was located at the western end of the station next to the level crossing; and a subsidiary or \\"pointsmen's\\" signal box (W√§rterstellwerk), designated as Go, at the eastern end. In the late 1950s operations on the line were downgraded to a simplified branch line service by the Deutsche Bundesbahn. As a result, the signal boxes, signals, point drives for the remotely controlled points and barriers were removed. The level crossing has since been protected by flashing lights. The entry turnouts were thrown, when necessary, by train crews using a lever apparatus located in a shelter by the station building. Services The halt is currently served by Regionalbahn (RB) trains on scheduled route 112 from L√ºneburg to Dannenberg Ost, which at the same time is Regionalbahn line 31 to G√∂hrde on the Hamburg Transport Network (HVV). The other stops in the direction of Dannenberg are no longer within the HVV fare zone. Since the turn of the year 1988/89 goods have no longer been handled at the station. The station has always been a stop for all passenger trains. The most important trains that stopped at G√∂hrde were the fast-stopping trains (Eilz√ºge) in the 1960s to 1980s that ran through to Hamburg. Passenger services Following the opening of the Wittenberge‚ÄìBuchholz branch to Buchholz in der Nordheide, two pairs of passenger trains and a pair of mixed trains stopped at G√∂hrde station daily, enabling through connexions to Wittenberge and Buchholz. The number of train connexions did not change when the Berlin-Hamburg Railway was nationalised in 1884. Journey times in the early years were about 66 minutes to L√ºneburg and 44 minutes to Dannenberg. The price of a single, second class ticket to L√ºneburg in 1880 was 200 pfennigs and a third class ticket was 130 pfennigs. A single to Dannenberg cost 120 pfennigs in second class and 80 pfennigs in third class. At the beginning of the 1910s the branch in L√ºneburg was split into two lines and through services to Buchholz ceased. The passenger trains stopping in G√∂hrde now started and finished their journeys at L√ºneburg. After the Second World War the line was severed when the Russians dropped the bridge over the Elbe at D√∂mitz; through services to Wittenberge were now no longer possible. The passenger trains that stopped at the station were largely restricted to those working the L√ºneburg‚ÄìDannenberg Ost route. The only exceptions were the occasional Eilzug pairs that ran from the 1960s onwards, the so-called \\"semi-fast hedgerow trains\\" (Heckeneilz√ºge), that sometimes provided through connexions to Hamburg Hauptbahnhof. These semi-fast trains were withdrawn when the timetable changed in May 1988\\\\. The number of passenger trains stopping at G√∂hrde varied during the 20th century between six and fourteen daily. On average five pairs of trains ran each day. Before the First World War there were seven pairs in the timetable; this number reduced during the war to five. The last timetable used before the Second World War had five pairs of trains in it, of two were dropped during the war years and the immediate post-war period. In the 1950s, ten passenger trains stopped at the station on workdays, just as many as in the winter timetable of 1988/89.Fahrpl√§ne: openingsfahrplan vom 31 December 1874; 1880; 1913/14; 1915/16; 1941; 1944; 1947/48; 1953; 1964. Currently five Regionalbahn trains pass each way on workdays, running every 3 hours. On Sundays and holidays they run every four hours; three trains working the line to L√ºneburg and four to Dannenberg. The journey time to L√ºneburg is 42 minutes and to Dannenberg, 26 minutes. The HVV fare for a single ticket from G√∂hrde to L√ºneburg in second class is 2.60 euros and the normal DB fare for a single from G√∂hrde to Dannenberg is 4.90 euros. Goods traffic Goods were handled at G√∂hrde station from the outset and data is available from the early years of the station's life. According to these figures, G√∂hrde station handled 23 tonne-kilometres (c.f. L√ºneburg 1782, Dahlenburg 39 and Dannenberg 708 tonne-kilometres). Amongst the goods delivered to G√∂hrde were food, in the form of part-piece loads, and artificial fertiliser, briquets and coke, peat, sugar beet scraps and other feedstuffs in full wagon loads. Goods dispatched included eating and seed potatoes, sugar beet, straw, hay, pit props, oak, beech and spruce logs, animals for slaughter and for breeding. Even by imperial times, grain was loaded for dispatch to Berlin. In the 1920s wood for dolphins was delivered from G√∂hrde to Hamburg Harbour and, in the post-war years, large quantities of pit props were sent to the Ruhr area. Sugar beet was loaded here until the late 1980s. In the last years before the goods facilities were closed logs were the only freight to be loaded at G√∂hrde. From the end of the 1960s, goods were handled by a local goods train (Nahg√ºterzug) that ran from L√ºneburg to Dannenberg Ost. Although it did not stop at G√∂hrde station, the wagons were only transported as far as Dahlenburg. From Dahlenburg the freight was then delivered to G√∂hrde on a goods transfer train (√úbergabeg√ºterzug), which was hauled by a light shunter of the Kleinlokomotive or K√∂f type. Freight was dispatched again using a Nahg√ºterzug from Dannenberg Ost to L√ºneburg, that returned again after reaching the Dannenberg terminus at the end of the line. In the 1980s, goods were transported exclusively by transfer trains to and from L√ºneburg. During the sugar beet harvest, additional goods trains were laid on. These entailed a K√∂f, stationed in Dannenberg Ost, hauling a transfer train twice a week from Dannenberg to G√∂hrde and back. Training centre The G√∂hrde Station Child and Youth Centre (Kinder- und Jugendzentrum Bahnhof G√∂hrde) has run a training centre in the station building at G√∂hrde and on the land south of the tracks since 1979. The old station building has overnight accommodation, toilets and bathrooms, kitchens and common rooms for up to 45 people. Its facilities includes a film and photographic laboratory, a screen printing facility, workshop, beehive, a vegetable garden and fruit orchard and a multi-purpose field.

At that time, facing the danger of a collapse of one of the towers of the Cathedral of Yucatan, the authorities asked the teacher Sales Cepeda to assist in determining the weight of the church bell that had been ignored. The teacher passed the problem on to Ricalde Gamboa who did the calculations exactly. Since then he was appointed a professor of rational arithmetic at the Institute where he studied. For various reasons he could no longer continue his desire to study engineering, but soon after, in 1902, he was appointed professor and later director of his own engineering school, a position he continued until 1905 when he resigned to devote himself to the studies of mathematics and became a correspondent for various specialized institutions abroad. He assembled a large library of over 5000 titles and was a collaborator of the French academic journal L'Interm√©diaire des Math√©maticiens, published in Paris in the early twentieth century. He was also interested in astronomy. He worked on various research projects in the city of M√©rida to his death in 1942 the victim of a throat infection. Career He achieved recognition for having calculated in 1910 the orbit dish of Halley's Comet. In 1923 he precisely calculated the eclipsed sun that year and became part of the Mexican Geodetic Commission who observed and studied in Champot√≥n in the state of Campeche. He discovered a method for solving the quintic equation by using elliptic functions. He was invited to work as a professor in several foreign schools, which he never accepted, preferring to remain in his homeland dedicating himself to his studies and to organize accounting systems of industrial enterprises seeking professional services Awards The municipal library of Hoctun was called Graciano Ricalde Gamboa after the \\"favorite son of the village\\". In the town of Ticop√≥, in the municipality of Acanceh, Yucatan, high school is named after the mathematician. In 2006, an award for Science and Mathematics was named in his honor. Resolution of Algebraic Equations: Degree 5 by Elliptic Functions One of the problems that have troubled most the mathematicians of all times is the resolution of algebraic equations of all grades. Such solutions were found for polynomial equations of degree 3 and 4 by Cardano and Ferrari in the 16th century. For polynomial equations of degree 5 and more, it was proven by Abel and Galois that the solution cannot be expressed in terms of radicals (meaning the roots cannot necessarily be expressed). However, there are other ways one can solve such equations. Hermite instead found a solution involving certain functions in advanced calculus that are called elliptic functions. (They generalize trig functions and are related to elliptic curves and originally to the problem of calculating the perimeter of an ellipse.) His solution was simplified and clarified by Kronecker and Klein. Among Ricalde's greatest accomplishments is that of his contribution to the resolution of the general equation of 5th- degree grade by elliptic functions, a feat that is analyzed and evaluated in the second part of this biography in Enciclopedia Yucanense IV, 1944. Additionally, Ricalde corresponded in a French question-and-answer journal called L'Interm√©diaire des math√©maticiens. In one entry that was published in circa 1898 (Graciano would have been 25 years of age), he asked about solving the quintic equation. More specifically, his question was about reducing the general quintic equation to the reduced Bring-Jerrard form (to solve the Bring-Jerrard equation requires elliptic functions). However, in modern mathematical literature, Ricalde is rarely cited. A citation in the arXiv (funded by Cornell University) is a review by Lemmermeyer concerning another algebra problem called Pell's equation. (Lemmermeyer includes Ricalde in a list of people who solved special cases of Pell's equation, citing the 1901 issue of L'Interm√©diaire des Math√©maticiens).Greg Kuperberg, Professor of U.C. Davis, (https://mathoverflow.net/users/1450/greg-kuperberg), Mathematician, Graciano Ricalde, URL (version: 2012-05-27): https://mathoverflow.net/q/98080 Since there are no radical solutions to polynomial equations of degrees greater than 4, roots cannot necessarily be expressed. Also, for applications in science and engineering, ‚Äúsolving an equation‚Äù usually means ‚Äúfinding a close approximation of a solution‚Äù. For example, if there is a real number which solves this equation, it can be said that it lies somewhere between 1.16730398 and 1.16730399. One can provide more precision, but obtaining the full decimal expansion of the solution remains impossible, yet sufficient enough. The code can still make the right decision, and a bridge will still hold if it is a sufficiently accurate approximation. Today's computers also solve polynomial equations by using iterative approximation techniques.  1901  He amazed the Scientist of the Intermediare Mathematicians of Paris, France with his solution to the Pell equation. Ricalde then accepted Professorship of the State College of Civil Engineering. In a moment of stillness and recollection, Graciano Ricalde remembers he was encouraged and led by Lic. and Eng. Capeda Manuel Sales, an eminent scientist Yucatan to begin his serious studies of actual mathematics.  1902  Graciano joined his wife and life partner who was then, then a professor Srita Normal, Carmen Manza√±illa Camomile. They bore four children, three boys and one girl, Alfonso, Humberto, Enrique and Ofelia who studied under the direction of the father, and mathematics. Enrique moved to New York City.  1910  Graciano would be the first to correctly prove by precise calculation that neither the arrival of Halley's Comet or its tail would hit the earth extinguishing life. This was a tremendous concern of its day. His rigorous studies were so serious that he compiled his formulas in a booklet that had great resonance in the National Observatory of Paris.  1923  Don Graciano accurately calculated the total eclipse of the sun of that year and joined the Mexican Commission Geodescica happened to observe at Champoton in the state of Campeche, for being there this total eclipse, in which the capital of the republic was seen as partial. But his greatest accomplishment is undoubtedly the resolution of the general equation of 5th-degree grade by elliptic functions, a feat that is analyzed and evaluated in the second part of this biography.  November 9, 1942  Graciano died in M√©rida in the grand family home.  January 18, 1943  The National Academy of Sciences, Antonio Alzaate organized a mathematical exposition of the merits of Graciano Ricalde during the evening in the Palacio de Bellas Artes of Mexico City. The band played and speakers including Dr. Ruben Moreno Ricalde spoke that evening as chronicled and published in the Daily News.  1959  A plaque was placed on the house where he was born in the little town of Hoctun. The Hoctun municipal library is called Ricalde Graciano Gamboa ‚Äúin honor of the beloved son of the village‚Äù. In the town of Ticopo, Yucatan, the high school is named after the mathematician. There is a second school, I believe it is in Hocaba.  2016  A plaque was presented and placed on Graciano Ricalde's professional residence by his nephew Arcadio Poveda.

Goodiepal coined the term while he was a teacher of composition at the Royal Academy of Music in Aarhus, Denmark, between 2004 and 2008, and he especially developed the project Mort Aux Vaches Ekstra Extra, which is a compositional game scenario questioning the role of the composer, time, notation and media, to thoroughly demonstrate the concept. The audio piece Official Mort Aux Vaches Ekstra Extra Walkthrough, released in 2008 on cassette on ALKU and later made available online, explains the theories and methodology that defines Mort Aux Vaches Ekstra Extra and Radical Computer Music and has been transcribed and published as a book, Radical Computer Music & Fantastisk Mediemanipulation - A Corrected and Illustrated Transcript of the Official Mort Aux Vaches Ekstra Extra Walkthrough.Goodiepal the √Örhus Warrior, Radical Computer Music & Fantastisk Mediemanipulation: A Corrected and Illustrated Transcript of the Official Mort Aux Vaches Ekstra Extra Walkthrough (Los Angeles/Copenhagen: MPH/Pork Salad Press, 2009 - ISBN no. 978-1-934399-12-5 / 1-934399-12-4) Restarting utopia in modern computer music and media art Radical Computer Music & Fantastisk Mediemanipulation - page 32 Radical Computer Music references the habit in Scandinavia of addressing notated music as \\"serious music\\".Goodiepal (2008), The Official Mort Aux Vaches Ekstra Extra Walkthrough listen at 2:33 As such it not only presents a different, more wide-ranging, approach to computer music, based on the acceptance of the medium as intelligent (AI or ALI, the latter term created by Goodiepal to describe alternative intelligence) but also includes media art as a field at risk of trivialisation and lack of utopian aspirations. According to Goodiepal, the scarcity of a utopian spark in contemporary computer music and media art is exacerbated by the low level of content in most computer-based communication, as a preference for sheer documentation appears to have come to motivate most media activities.Liz Armstrong, \\"Danish mad professor on the loose in the internet\\" from Vice Magazine (US), Oct 2008, online at Generally, a call for easy access and convenience permeates the relation between humans and computers, rather than the aspiration for cultural evolution through technological refinement.DR, Den 11. Time, 2008, online at \\\\- Goodiepal explains Radical Computer Music on national Danish television (in Danish) In the process of this deflation, human language is reduced to machine-like commands when humans increasingly address machines as machines without making use of an otherwise highly refined associative and context-based sense of language. Goodiepal advocates that these communicative skills can be strengthened in humans through the creation of musical scores in languages at the same time challenging the mindsets of computers, artificial, and alternative intelligences. Through this mutually beneficial communication exercise the man-machine relationship can potentially move to a higher level.Goodiepal (2008), The Official Mort Aux Vaches Ekstra Extra Walkthrough, listen at 8:15 - 10:20 Artificial/alternative intelligence (AI/ALI) While it has been repeatedly predicted since the fifties that in 20 years time the computer will be more clever than human beings,Steve Connor, \\"Computers 'to match human brains by 2030'\\" from The Independent (UK), 16th of Feb 2008, online at the promise of the artificial intelligence remains yet to be fulfilled. With Radical Computer Music, Goodiepal proposes a game play where singularity has been crossed and artificial/alternative intelligences must be acknowledged as existing. He expands the notion of the \\"other\\" intelligence by including beings potentially alive in the electricity and water supply systems, as such beings not created by humans and therefore termed alternative intelligences (ALI), expanding the common belief that non-human intelligence can develop in complex networks of all kinds.DR, Den 11.

This strategy is in effect an exclusion of the notion of time altogether and the game scenario places the participant in a centre position between at least two or three musical objects, all heavily loaded with information. Since the level of interest, with which the participant will respond to these objects, cannot be immediately determined, they will pull away from the centre point with infinite strength and so create a vacuum.Caroline Smith, \\"The man behind the madness\\" from The Daily Northwestern (US), 13th of Nov 2008, online at \\\\- Goodiepal interview From here the participant conceives a composition, which is then notated in the school book. Redefining musical notation and the concept of contemporary documentation The participant's unique ability to sense an exceptional vacuum event and transform the experience into a composition communicated through a musical score is a manifestation of human potential, one which the artificial intelligence‚Äôs binary calculating mind cannot immediately scan and decode.Goodiepal (2008), The Official Mort Aux Vaches Ekstra Extra Walkthrough listen at 10:44 - 11:31 The focus on the musical score as the medium, in which humans can challenge the mindsets of artificial and alternative intelligences, is a response to the way in which computer music usually is programmed and recorded as part of its creation.Susanna Glaser, \\"Free radical\\", The Wire (UK), issue 298, Dec 2008, p. 13 - introduction to Mort Aux Vaches Ekstra Extra That the score is absent in this creation increases its value as a medium for entertainment and education of artificial and alternative intelligences, presuming that similar to humans the AI or ALI will be interested in things it cannot immediately grasp. Goodiepal advocates the use of handwriting and alternative spelling, plus application of all imaginable kinds of drawing and visualisation techniques, in the creation of the score with the purpose of scrambling the information to the largest extent possible.Goodiepal (2008), The Official Mort Aux Vaches Ekstra Extra Walkthrough listen at 13:22 ‚Äì 15:36 As the machine cannot immediately record a defined object in a certain location but require information about the limits of that location to understand where and what to scan, the score's non- linear structure in relation to time and space makes it almost impossible for a binary calculating mindset to scan.Goodiepal at DISK/Club Transmediale, Berlin the 25th of January 2009, video clip online at \\\\- see also additional blog discussion Sharing the compositional task Mort Aux Vaches Ekstra Extra game scenario with two objects, 2009 Mort Aux Vaches Ekstra Extra game scenario with nine objects, 2009 A Mort Aux Vaches Ekstra Extra composition is in effect a collaboration between Goodiepal and the participant, since the study material, in the shape of a school book and musical objects, has been created by him.Goodiepal (2008), The Official Mort Aux Vaches Ekstra Extra Walkthrough listen at 10:21 - 10:43 As such the participant becomes a co- composer by unfolding, according to own skills and preferences, what Goodiepal has begun, and the relationship between sender and receiver is transfigured into a joint authorship with an open-ended relation, also to a potential performance of the score. Performances have mainly taken place when participants have expressed a desire to do so, since the process of completing the Mort Aux Vaches Ekstra Extra exercise is in effect a compositional process in reverse. As such the performance of the work already took place when Goodiepal created his part of the composition, before handing it over to future co-composers.

Based in Los Angeles, their contributions to the music industry include American Idol in the United States, Pop Idol in the United Kingdom and versions of the Idol series in more than seventy countries around the world. 19 Entertainment is also responsible for the production of So You Think You Can Dance. Background and history Founded in London, England in 1985, 19 Entertainment moved their headquarters to Los Angeles, United States, in 2010. The company was named after the Paul Hardcastle song which was one of Simon Fuller's first notable successes while working as an A&R; man for Chrysalis Records. In 2009 the company announced the purchase of London based Storm Model Management, one of the world's top modelling agencies. This business was sold back to Storm's management in 2013, ending the firm's activities in fashion. In March 2005, 19 Entertainment founder Simon Fuller sold the company to Robert Sillerman's CKX, Inc. in a cash and stock deal worth $210 million. Subsequent to the deal Fuller remained in his role as CEO of 19 Entertainment and added the new role of director of CKX. In his dual role Fuller was able to effectively co-ordinate all creative aspects of the CKX business until January 2010 when, as he approached the end of his employment contract with CKX, Inc., he decided to start up a new business, XIX Entertainment, while still acting as a consultant to CKX / 19 and as an Executive Producer of 19's shows. Following this, CKX announced its intention to shift 19 to becoming a US business focusing solely on American Idol and So You Think You can Dance brands. 19's old Headquarters in Battersea, London became the headquarters for Simon Fuller's new business, XIX, while the base for 19 Entertainment was transferred to Los Angeles. In September 2010 much of 19's non- American Idol business was sold to Simon Fuller's new business XIX Entertainment. This included 19's non-Idol management clients such as David and Victoria Beckham, Andy Murray, Annie Lennox, The Spice Girls, Lewis Hamilton, S Club 7, Carrie Underwood, David Cook, and others. Also transferred to XIX Entertainment were Roland Mouret and Victoria Beckham's fashion businesses. Sillerman and partners accepted an offer from Apollo Global Management on July 21, 2011 to purchase the entire stock of CKX, Inc, and the business was re-branded as CORE Media group in 2012 with 19 Entertainment becoming the group's primary west coast division. 19 Television series Current series * American Idol (2002-2016, 2018‚Äìpresent) * So You Think You Can Dance (2005‚Äìpresent) Former series * Miami 7 (1999) * L.A. 7 (2000) * S Club 7 Go Wild!

Early life  Willie Sandlin was born in Breathitt County. He was the only Kentuckian to receive the Medal of Honor in World War I. Of all the American servicemen who fought during the Great War, only Sergeant Alvin C. York received more decorations for valor than Sandlin. Born of humble parents, he had the misfortune to lose his mother when he was a small boy. He grew to manhood with few advantages. At an early age, he enlisted in the United States Regular Army. The hardships of youth had taught him well the lesson of taking care of himself. Straight as an arrow, with keen, alert, but steady black eyes, black hair, powerfully muscular, but not heavy built, he was a splendid type of the sturdy men who come from the Kentucky mountain counties. He was not assertive, but almost timid. But his mother was an Abner, and the Abners were among the sturdiest, most reliant stock of the old time families in Perry County. His quick black eyes and muscular frame came from his mother. Military service  Medal of Honor Presentation Ceremony - February 9, 1919, at Chaumont, France. General John J. Pershing presided. He enlisted in the army in 1912 and served on the Mexican border. In 1917, he was sent to France with the 132d Infantry. Promoted to sergeant, Sandlin single-handedly destroyed three German machine gun emplacements and killed twenty-four of the enemy on September 26, 1918, at Bois de Forges. For that action, he was awarded the Medal of Honor on February 9, 1919. Later life  After the war, Sandlin returned to Eastern Kentucky and bought a farm on Owls Nest Creek near Hyden. He and his wife, the former Belvia Roberts, were active in the Frontier Nursing Service. They had one son and four daughters. Death and legacy  Sandlin, then 59, died on May 29, 1949, of a lingering lung infection resulting from a poison gas attack on his company in the Battle of the Argonne. He was buried in Hurricane Cemetery near Hyden. In September 1990, his remains were reburied in the Zachary Taylor National Cemetery in Louisville. Willie's wife, Belvia Roberts Sandlin, lived to be 96 years old. She died on February 11, 1999. Belvia was 47 years of age when Willie died and she never married again. In 2018, the family of Willie Sandlin donated several artifacts, including Sandlin's pistol, uniform, Medal of Honor and Bronze Star to the Kentucky Historical Society in Frankfort. The Kentucky General Assembly, during the 2016 regular session, named a new bridge crossing the Middle Fork of the Kentucky River on KY 30 in the Old Buck Community of Breathitt County the \\"Sergeant Willie Sandlin Memorial Bridge.\\" State and local officials gathered at Highland-Turner Elementary School in Breathitt County on June 24, 2016, to formally dedicate the bridge in Sandlin's memory and honor. On May 3, 2018, his body was moved from the Zachary Taylor National Cemetery in Louisville, to the Kentucky Veterans Cemetery Southeast in Leslie County Kentucky. Sgt.

Enterprise customers are able to access the Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud (EC2) over an IPsec based virtual private network. Unlike traditional EC2 instances which are allocated internal and external IP numbers by Amazon, the customer can assign IP numbers of their choosing from one or more subnets. By giving the user the option of selecting which AWS resources are public facing and which are not, VPC provides much more granular control over security. For Amazon it is \\"an endorsement of the hybrid approach, but it's also meant to combat the growing interest in private clouds\\". Comparison to private clouds Amazon Virtual Private Cloud aims to provide a service similar to private clouds using technology such as OpenStack or HPE Helion Eucalyptus. However, private clouds typically also use technology such as OpenShift application hosting and various database systems. Cloud security experts warned there can be compliance risks, such as a loss of control or service cancellation in using public resources which do not exist with in-house systems. If transaction records are requested from Amazon about a VPC using a National security letter they may not even be legally allowed to inform the customer of the breach of the security of their system. This would be true even if the actual VPC resources were in another country. The API used by AWS is only partly compatible with that of HPE Helion Eucalyptus and is not compatible with other private cloud systems so migration from AWS may be difficult. This has led to warnings of the possibility of lock-in to a specific technology. IP Addressing Initially, users are able to choose a range of IP addresses for their VPC. Within this range, users can assign various private and public IPv4 and IPv6 addresses to instances in the VPC in order to communicate with the Internet and other instances of VPCs. These addresses are assigned to specific instances rather than the user's entire VPC account. Static assignment of Public IP addresses is not possible, instead the address is assigned and unassigned in certain cases, causing the address of an instance to change. When a consistent IP address is needed, a third type of IP Address, Elastic IP addresses, can be used in place of Public IP addresses. Connectivity AWS VPC allows users to connect to the Internet, a user's corporate data center, and other users' VPCs. Users are able to connect to the Internet by adding an Internet Gateway to their VPC, which assigns the VPC a public IPv4 Address. Users are able to connect to a data center by setting up a Hardware Virtual Private Network connection between the data center and the VPC. This connection allows the user to \\"interact with Amazon EC2 instances within a VPC as if they were within [the user's] existing network.\\" Users are able to route traffic from one VPC to another VPC using private IP addresses, and are able to communicate as if they were on the same network. Peering can be achieved by connecting a route between two VPC's on the same account or two VPC's on different accounts in the same region. VPC Peering is a one-to-one connection, but users are able to connect to more than one VPC at a time. To achieve a one-to-many connections between VPCs, you can deploy a transit gateway. In addition, you can connect your VPCs to your on premise systems by employing the transit gateway. Security AWS VPC's security is two-fold: firstly, AWS VPC uses security groups as a firewall to control traffic at the instance level, while it also uses network access control lists as a firewall to control traffic at the subnet level. As another measure of privacy, AWS VPC provides users with ability to create \\"dedicated instances\\" on hardware, physically isolating the dedicated instances from non-dedicated instances and instances owned by other accounts. AWS VPC is free, with users only paying for the consumption of EC2 resources. However, if choosing to access VPC via a Virtual Private Network (VPN), there is a charge.

The Polaris mine was located north of the Arctic Circle, and north of the community of Resolute. The Polaris mine closed in July 2002 following more than twenty years of zinc production. History The text-top In 1964 Vancouver-based Cominco optioned all the mineral claims in Canada's Arctic that were controlled by Bankaro Mines. Mineral and economic assessments resulted in a 23 million ton reserve at a zinc grade of 14.1%. Approval of the project was obtained in 1979, then Prime Minister Joe Clark waived environmental assessment hearings and pledged to ship half of the concentrate from the mine in the federally owned icebreaker MV Arctic. The entire mineral processing plant, power plant and workshop were built upon a barge and traveled from Quebec to the mine site. In 1981 the mine commenced production. The Polaris mine employed over 250 people. Although only 20 mine employees were from northern Canada, thirty percent of employment in Resolute was directly related to the mine. Production The Polaris mine produced over 21 million tonne of lead-zinc ore during the life of the mine, with a market value of over $1.5 billion. Concentrate from the mining operation was stored in a long warehouse, which was the largest structure in Nunavut. Closure Initially the mine was scheduled to close in 2001, however due to improved mining techniques, the mine life was extended one year to 2002. Reclamation procedures following the closure of the Polaris mine set a new standard for mine closure in the territory of Nunavut. Reclamation of the mine site began while the mine was still operating, this work was planned to ensure it would not have an adverse effect on the mining operation (such as removal of unused buildings). Cominco intended to bury most of the buildings and materials in a nearby quarry, with the permafrost preventing contamination. Cominco offered the staff accommodations to the federal government for use as a penal colony on the island. Household items were offered to residents of nearby Inuit communities. Cleanup of the Polaris mine site took two years, with environmental monitoring until 2011.

It is located northeast of the intersection of Woodlawn Rd. and Park Rd. in the south central part of Charlotte. Park Road Shopping Center has a nostalgic ambience, which is sustained by the pipe shop, soda shop, shoe repair shop, and many other stores that date back to the Post-World War II baby boom era. History Park Road Shopping Center opened up on November 15, 1956 and was Charlotte's very first open area-type shopping mall. Developed by A.V. Blankenship, it is typical of Mid-Century modern architecture and the original billboard sign remains today. When the mall was first envisioned, it was considered to be a shift in area business development. At this time period most of the shopping areas were still located in and around downtown Charlotte. Meanwhile, more and more people continued to move to the suburbs and outlying areas of the city.Park Road Shopping Center History This has been the catalyst that has kept the shopping center successful to this day. Park Road Shopping Center is a very bustling mall and serves many of the surrounding Charlotte neighborhoods such as Myers Park, Barclay Downs, Parkdale, Colonial Village, Madison Park, Sedgefield, Ashbrook, and Starmount. In 1967 a local attorney named Porter Byrum bought Park Road Shopping Center. On June 16, 2011 Mr. Byrum announced that Park Road Shopping Center would be donated to 3 local colleges (Queens University of Charlotte, Wingate University, and Wake Forest University).Park Road Shopping Center donated to 3 colleges (Charlotte Observer) Mr. Byrum had held ownership of the shopping center for nearly 44 years. Just one month later these 3 colleges sold the shopping center for $82 million to EDENS, a shopping center operator and developer.Landmark Park Road Shopping Center is sold for $82 million (Charlotte Observer) Despite these sudden changes in ownership, it is expected that the shopping center will continue on as is. It is easy to walk or bike to the Park Road Shopping Center since it lies on the Little Sugar Creek Greenway. In 2014 the center underwent a renovation. It was painted white, given wooden features, outdoor seating was added and the covered walkways got new lighting and floor treatment.

Plot The glamorous heiress and daredevil pilot Virginia Allerton (June Lang) is test- flying her seaplane \\"The Lady Bird\\" after some modifications made by her mechanic Max Raft (Ted Osborne), also on the aircraft. They experience problems mid-air when they are caught in a tropical storm, and all the ships in the South Sea area are alerted to their distress. Virginia's brother, Lt. George Allerton (Grant Richards), is stationed with the U.S. Marine Corps on the nearby island of Palo Pango when he hears his sister's distress calls. Virginia and Max head to the island to take refuge from the storm. Upon their arrival, Virginia and Max are welcomed by two U.S. Marines: \\"Stripes\\" Thornton (William Gargan) and \\"Milly\\" Barnes (Wallace Ford). Also present is Oliver Barton (Gilbert Roland), who runs the trading post but is also in the business of smuggling guns. He invites Virginia to stay at his house for the night, and also challenges her to a flying race to Guam, betting $5,000 that he will win. Both Marines are soon smitten by Virginia, and she becomes attracted to Stripes. Virginia is unaware that Barton is planning to use her as cover for his shipment of guns about to take place on the steamer Albotros, commanded by Captain N. Lawson (Harry Woods). To help him, Barton has an assistant, \\"Doc\\" Spriggs (Etienne Girardot), an old eccentric gentleman who believes in reincarnation. The race begins and Barton tries to outrun Virginia by taking a perilous shortcut over an island. Barton plays a trick on Virginia by faking his aircraft crashing into the jungle. Virginia lands on the water to rescue him but damages her aircraft in the process. It turns out Barton lives nearby and Virginia and Max are invited to be the guests of him and his Caribbean wife Inda (Katherine DeMille). Inda believes that Barton is smitten and becomes jealous of Virginia. Max finds evidence in Barton's aircraft of his gun smuggling operation, and a fight between the men ensues. Inda kills Max with a poisoned dart she fires from a blowgun. Barton flees the island and goes back to Palo Pango. He lies to Stripes, telling him he has no idea where Virginia is, but Stripes finds a poisoned dart stuck into the hull of the aircraft and becomes suspicious. He deploys Milly and they follow Barton. Stripes hides aboard Barton's aircraft and manages to tell the others where they land. He finds Virginia in Barton's jungle home, but Inda alerts Barton and Stripes and Virginia are quickly surrounded. Still, Stripes manages to hold Barton captive. The group escape boarding Barton's aircraft but it will not start. Barton runs off in the midst of a shoot-out, Milly arrives, armed with his hand grenades, and joins in to help Stripes. Barton captures Virginia and brings her with him in his escape, but Inda spots the two of them, and furious with jealousy, gives the order to have him shot. A ship of Marines arrive on the scene and save the day, helping them back to Palo Pango. Virginia and Stripes marry and fly off to Honolulu together on a honeymoon, leaving Milly, now promoted to sergeant, behind.

The successful rescue operation gained headlines, leading to much rejoicing island-wide and helped increase morale. Overview With the LTTE withdrawing from peace talks and violating the ceasefire, many Army bases in the Jaffna Peninsula such as; Palaly, Jaffna Fort and other areas such as Killinochi, Mankulaum and Kokavil were besieged by the LTTE. Talaimannar army detachment was overrun. The bases at Elephant Pass and Mullaitivu were under attack, yet stable. At this point much attention was gained by the besieged Jaffna Fort with over 200 Army and Police personnel. Even though elements of the 6th Battalion of the Sri Lanka Sinha Regiment held the fort effectively under the command of Lieutenant Jayantha Perera and was support by the policemen of the Jaffna Police Station, the garrison was running short of food and ammunition. There were eight service personal critically wounded and required evacuation. A previous airborne rescue attempt by helicopter failed due to heavy enemy fire that prevented the helicopter from landing. At this point the air force was under increased pressure to try another rescue attempt. Plan The Commander of the Sri Lanka Air Force Air Marshall Terrance Gunawardena gave the order to carry out a rescue operation. The Northern Area Air Operations Commander Wing Commander Sunil Cabral took up operational command of the mission was Squadron Leader Lasantha Waidyaratne, who was at the time Air Force's Staff Officer to late Major General Denzil Kobbekaduwa GOC Northern Sector was asked took pilot the helicopter to make the daring landing. Volunteering to fly the mission he selected Flight Lieutenant Avindra Mirando as his co-pilot and Raula Fernando and Wimaladharma Sooriyadasa as air gunners.THE REDOUBTABLE OPERATION EAGLE AND MISSION IMPOSSIBLE The plan was to take weapons, ammunition and a medical team with supplies and land outside the ramparts near the main gate of the fort. The operation was code named Operation Eagle and the day set for early morning of July 3, 1990. A two waves of three SIAI Marchetti SF.260s each with a third wave in reserve, was to attack enemy positions to clear the way for the landing helicopter, code name Red formation. To provide close air cover for the rescue helicopter was four helicopter gunships. On July 2, 1990 a SIAI Marchetti SF.260 dropped an empty bombshell contacting the plans of the op into the fort for its personal to make preparations. A Bell 212 from the No. 4 Helicopter Wing code named Lasantha was used, and the pilots practiced the maneuvers Nachaduwa tankbund in the vicinity of Anuradhapura during twilight hours of July 2, 1990. The SIAI Marchetti SF.260s were led by Squadron Leader Shirantha Goonatilake, and the close air cover gunships were Bell 212s armed with .50 cal machine guns and rockets from the No. 4 Helicopter Wing. Three Harbin Y-12 and a Shaanxi Y-8 transporters from the No. 2 Squadron were improvised as bombers were to be flying over Mannar in case mission failure and to assist in the recovery through a prolonged battle with heavy bombing capability. Final briefing took place at SLAF Anuradhapura by Wing Commander Sunil Cabral the Operation Commander. Operation The H hour 0505 July 3, 10 minutes before the aircraft were in place and the go-ahead was given by Operation Commander. However Lasantha reported poor light, and the same was reported by Red formation. The operation was briefly halted and recommenced. Several minutes later Sqn Ldr Waidyaratne brought Lasantha down to 50 feet, and the order was given to land without air cover by Ops Commander. Lasantha approached the fort, and the gunships moved to attack seconds ahead of time, providing cover. On arriving near the Fort, Sqn Ldr Waidyaratne made a 90-degree turn and descended, instructing his own gunners not to initiate aggressive fire, making an 8-shaped path and settled the machine at the designated location. In less than a minute the rescue helicopter successfully completed its mission, placing a new commanding officer, a medical team and supplies, a complement of heavy weapons and loading up eight seriously wounded soldiers and policemen. At this point the Siai Marchettis carried out their bombing run and the surprised LTTE cadres were pinned down by the gunships that arrived at the scene.Operation Eagle........ The helicopter was airborne in less time than the estimated time of one minute on ground, with its gunner firing at the LTTE pillbox that was in close proximity to the main gate of the fort. After reaching an altitude of 2000 feet, Lasantha turned home. Aftermath The mission was a complete success and by morning the entire island was aware of the daring rescue, with the media dubbing this operation a Meticulously Planned and Brilliantly Executed Operation.

She exhibited at the Royal Academy and at the Society of British Artists, where she became an honorary member. Biography Rolinda Sharples was born into a family of artists headed by James Sharples, her father, and Ellen Sharples, her mother who had studied under her husband and continued to assist James in his studio after their marriage. Ellen Sharples not only made copies of her husband's better known compositions but she additionally received requests for her own work. Rolinda's three brothers also pursued careers in art. They were: George, from her father's first marriage; Felix, from his second marriage; and James Jr., who was Rolinda's full brother and son to Ellen, James's third wife. She was only an infant when her parents moved to America in 1793. Rolinda spent two periods in America, the first between 1793 and 1801 and the second from 1809 to 1811. In 1803, Rolinda's mother, a miniature portrait painter, began to encourage her daughter to take an interest in the profession. She taught Rolinda drawing, paying her small sums of money to encourage her. By the time Rolinda was 13 years old, she had joined the family business, which consisted of creating small scale pastel portraits of famous people, copying them and selling them for a profit. Along with her two brothers and mother, she began copying miniature portraits from her father's original paintings. After her father's death in New York in 1811, Rolinda returned to Bristol with her mother and brother. She branched out from painting small portraits, to earning her living painting portraits in oil, and more ambitious genre and contemporary history paintings that depicted groups of people. During this time, her mother Ellen's diaries shifted their focus to Rolinda's progress as an artist. In 1812, Ellen wrote of her daughter: \\"Rolinda commenced oil painting on the 21, & has since applied with great ardour, continuing other studies, & having lessons in music, practising &c.;\\" Soon thereafter in 1813, Ellen notes that she \\"sat for my picture to Rolinda in oil colours as large as life, kit kat size, the first portrait she painted in oil.\\" Rolinda painted her mother several times. At the end of 1813, she painted a large as life portrait, having, as her mother observed, \\"much improved in painting and become discontented with the portrait executed in Jan. 7.\\" In 1814, Rolinda painted a self-portrait, and in 1815 she completed a double portrait entitled The Artist and Her Mother. A signature device of the artist was to paint herself into the background of many of her works, often pictured with a wry smile, gazing directly into the eyes of the observer. Rolinda was elected an honorary member of the Society of British Artists in 1827. Rolinda was one of the first female British artists to tackle multi-figure compositions. Her group paintings were as meticulous in detail as the small portraits she once painted, and today her scenes of Regency Bristol are considered to be accurate social records of the period. Her major paintings include The Cloak Room, Clifton Assembly Rooms; Racing on the Downs; Rownham Ferry with Portraits; The Stoppage of the Bank; and The Trial of Colonel Brereton after the Bristol riots of 1831. Rolinda also painted smaller, more intimate studies from nature ‚Äì of shells, or of a little mouse ‚Äì which she exhibited. Rolinda's paintings were included in exhibitions in Bristol, Leeds, Birmingham, and Carlisle, and with the Royal Academy and the Society of British Artists in London. For the last eight years of her life she lived with her mother in Hotwells area of Bristol, and died of breast cancer in 1838. Many of her paintings are now in the Bristol City Museum and Art Gallery. Personal papers Letters, legal papers, bank and account books relating to the family of Rolinda Sharples are held at Bristol Archives (Ref. 15395) (online catalogue). The Cloakroom, Clifton Assembly Rooms, 1817 Cloak-Room at the Clifton Assembly Rooms, 1817 This painting, which is on display in the Bristol Museum and Art Gallery, has become one of Rolinda's most recognisable images for fans of Jane Austen and the British Regency. The image has been used for numerous books, most notably A Portrait of Jane Austen, by David Cecil, Jane Austen's World, by Maggie Lane, and High Society, by Venetia Murray. One reason for its popular use might be that only a few Georgian paintings exist today that depict assemblies in progress, with people dancing or moving around.Mark, Girouard. The English Town: A History of Urban Life, Yale University Press, 1995, p. 142 Rolinda's painting shows a group in the cloakroom preparing for the evening. The Clifton Assembly Rooms still survive to this day.

Life and work She was born on 10 April 1884 in London to James Roche, 3rd Baron Fermoy (1852‚Äì1920), an Irish peer who was a Member of Parliament in the House of Commons, and Frances Ellen Work (1857‚Äì1947), an American heiress and socialite. Her brothers were Maurice Roche, 4th Baron Fermoy (1885‚Äì1955), the maternal grandfather of Diana, Princess of Wales, and the Hon. Francis Burke Roche (1885‚Äì1958). In 1904, Good Housekeeping magazine described her as among the members of New York's Four Hundred (see The Four Hundred (1892)) who were daring and skilful automobilists. Roche was also recognised as a skilled tennis player and horserider. In 1908, Roche became a naturalised United States citizen. Personal life On 11 June 1906, Roche married Arthur Scott Burden. Burden was the grandson of industrialist Henry Burden and President of the family business Burden Iron Works, but his career was significantly impaired after two horse falls, the second of which seriously aggravated the injuries incurred from the first. As a result of these injuries, Burden was placed under constant care from late 1913, and James Burden, Arthur Burden's brother, filed a petition in Cynthia Roche's absence, (as both she and her daughter were in London at the time), requesting that Arthur Burden be declared incompetent. Burden died from pneumonia in June 1921. The couple had a daughter: * Eileen Burden (1910‚Äì1970), who married investment banker Walter Maynard (d. 1971) and had three children. They later divorced and in 1963, she married Thomas Robins (1897-1977). Robins was the son of Thomas Robins (1868‚Äì1957), inventor of the conveyor belt. In 1922, after her first husband's death, Roche married Guy Fairfax Cary Sr. (1879‚Äì1950) and they honeymooned at the fishing lodge of Robert Walton Goelet. Cary, a lawyer who was a partner with Shearman & Sterling, was the son of Clarence Cary (1845‚Äì1911) and Elisabeth Miller Potter (1856‚Äì1945). His father and aunt, Constance Cary (1843‚Äì1920), were the children of Archibald Cary and Monimia Fairfax.Archibald Cary was the son of Wilson Jefferson Cary and Virginia Randolph. Monimia Fairfax was the daughter of Thomas Fairfax, 9th Lord Fairfax of Cameron Together, they had two children: * Guy Fairfax Cary II (1923‚Äì2004), who died unmarried. * Cynthia Cary (1924‚Äì2019), who married Charles Bingham Penrose Van Pelt (1922‚Äì2003) and had three children. She later married Edwin F. Russell (1914‚Äì2001), who had four children. Cynthia died at her home in Newport, aged 82, on 18 December 1966. She left an estate valued at $300,000. Her home and the residue of her estate were received by her son, Guy Fairfax Cary Jr. Descendants Through her eldest daughter, she was the grandmother of Sheila Maynard, a clinical social worker who worked in Islamabad, married Nicholas Platt, a career diplomat who served as US ambassador to Pakistan, Zambia and the Philippines, and had 3 sons: Adam Platt, a New York magazine restaurant critic, Oliver Platt (b. 1960), the actor, and Nicholas Platt Jr. Also through her eldest daughter, she was the grandmother to Walter Maynard Jr., an investment advisor with Morgan Stanley who married Pamela S. Silver in 1954 and has issue, and John Maynard. Legacy In 1981, the Redwood Library received her collected art as the Cynthia Cary Collection. It was donated by her son, Guy Fairfax Cary Jr. The art collection was amassed over decades by her. The collection was previously exhibited at Rhode Island School of Design and Christie's in Manhattan.

The isolation between one VPC user and all other users of the same cloud (other VPC users as well as other public cloud users) is achieved normally through allocation of a private IP subnet and a virtual communication construct (such as a VLAN or a set of encrypted communication channels) per user. In a VPC, the previously described mechanism, providing isolation within the cloud, is accompanied with a VPN function (again, allocated per VPC user) that secures, by means of authentication and encryption, the remote access of the organization to its VPC resources. With the introduction of the described isolation levels, an organization using this service is in effect working on a 'virtually private' cloud (that is, as if the cloud infrastructure is not shared with other users), and hence the name VPC. VPC is most commonly used in the context of cloud infrastructure as a service. In this context, the infrastructure provider, providing the underlying public cloud infrastructure, and the provider realizing the VPC service over this infrastructure, may be different vendors. Implementations Amazon Web Services launched Amazon Virtual Private Cloud on 26 August 2009, which allows the Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud service to be connected to legacy infrastructure over an IPsec virtual private network connection... In AWS, VPC is free to use, however users will be charged for any virtual private networks (VPN) they use.. EC2 and RDS instances running in a VPC can also be purchased using Reserved Instances, however will have a limitation on resources being guaranteed. IBM Cloud launched IBM Cloud‚Ñ¢ VPC on 4 June 2019, which starts a new generation of IBM Cloud infrastructure. Designed from the ground up for cloud-native workloads, VPC provides a brand-new experience to manage virtual machine-based compute, storage, and networking resources in a private, secure space you define. Pricing for IBM Cloud‚Ñ¢ Virtual Private Cloud is applied separately for internet data transfer, virtual server instances, and block storage used within your IBM Cloud VPC. Google Cloud Platform resources can be provisioned, connected, and isolated in a virtual private cloud (VPC) across all GCP regions. With GCP, VPCs are global resources and subnets within that VPC are regional resources. This allows you to connect zones and regions without the use of additional networking complexity as all data travels, encrypted in transit and at rest, on Google's own global, private network. Identity management policies and security rules allow for private access to Google's storage, big data, and analytics managed services.

The remoteness of the Glensanda settlement is such that there are no road, rail, or marked footway links across the granite mountain, moor, heather and peat bog of the private Glensanda estate. The only practical access is by boat from the shores of Loch Linnhe. Since 1982 the Glensanda Estate has been the home of the Glensanda Superquarry created by Foster Yeoman, since acquired by the Aggregate Industries group, which mines the Meall na h-Easaiche mountain,Scotlands Places, Meall na h-Easaiche and Glensanda Quarry shipping up to 6,000,000 tons of granite aggregates all over the world annually, and with reserves for up to 100 years. To minimise visual impact from the coast the quarry is sited inland, and cut down into the mountain above sea level. Granite is extracted via a \\"Glory Hole\\" and conveyor belt, a pioneering development in alternative quarrying technology. History River Sanda and footpath to Ardtornish Little is known of the glen before the Viking age when it was part of D√°l Riata, a Gaelic over-kingdom of the western seaboard of Scotland, in the late 6th and early 7th century. According to Professor William J. Watson the Morvern district was formerly known as Kinelvadon, from the Cen√©l B√°et√°in, a subdivision of the Cen√©l Loairn. Glensanda was a Viking settlement at the mouth of Glen Sanda The Vikings are thought to have led their first raids on what is now modern Scotland by the early 8th century AD. Their first known attack was on the holy island of Iona in 794, west. The end of the Viking Age proper in Scotland is generally considered to be in 1266. Glensanda Castle is variously known as Caisteal Na Gruagaich (Maiden's castle), Castle Na'gair, Castle-en-Coer, Castle Mearnaig. It was built in the late 15th century by Ewen MacLean, 5th of Kingairloch, who was born circa 1450. Glensanda, a part of Ardgour, has formed part of the territory of the Clan MacLean ever since the Clan MacMaster was removed from the territory in the 15th century. The castle was the main base of the Clan Maclean of Kingairloch (Kingerloch), and supported a thriving community of circa 500 people until around 1780 when they seem to have moved north to Connach (Kingairloch), at the head of Loch a' Choire (Loch Corry). In the late 17th century the massacre of the MacDonald clansmen marked the point when the fortunes of the MacLean clan began to wane, and by 1691 the Campbells had gained possession of most of the MacLean estates. Clan Maclean participated in the Jacobite risings of 1745 to 1746, supporting the House of Stuart and the Jacobite cause. Many members of the clan were killed fighting at the Battle of Culloden. Many MacLeans dispersed to other countries such as Canada, the United States, Australia and New Zealand. In 1812 Sir Hector Maclean (the 7th Baronet of Morvern and 23rd Chief of the Clan Maclean) emigrated with almost the entire population of 500 to Pictou, Nova Scotia, Canada. Thus, the Macleans appear not to have been involved in Highland Clearances. Sir Hector is buried in the cemetery at Pictou. English landowner, James Forbes (1753‚Äì1829), of Hutton Hall, Essex, bought the estate from Sir Hector Maclean in 1812 and subsequently had the existing house at Connach extended to become the first Kingairloch House. James Forbes daughter Charlotte married Major- General Sir Charles Bruce, KCB to become Lady Bruce, and was the mother of Charlotte Campbell-Bannerman (1836‚Äì1906) the wife of Henry Campbell-Bannerman, Prime Minister of the United Kingdom. In 1888 (or 1881) the estate was purchased by John Bell Sherriff, Esquire of Carronvale, a distiller and industrialist from Glasgow and Falkirk for ¬£30,140.} In 1902 George Herbert Strutt (1854‚Äì1928), a 5th generation cotton tycoon from Belper, Derbyshire, and descendant of Jedediah Strutt, bought the Glensanda and Kingairloch estates. In 1930 Arthur Strutt (1908‚Äì1977) married Patricia Kebbell (20 October 1911 ‚Äì July 2000), daughter of a New Zealand sheep farmer, and granddaughter of John Cameron a Scottish cattle drover from Corrychoillie, Spean Bridge having been introduced by his sisters who were attending the same Swiss finishing school. Arthur Strutt died on the estate in 1977 although his body was not found for five years. Mrs Strutt was a renowned stag hunter, having shot circa 2,000 between 1930 and her death, more than any other woman in Great Britain. The final solitary resident of Glensanda died around the 1950s. By the 1980s Glensanda comprised the ruined tower of the 15th-century castle, a couple of derelict cottages, and a wrecked cattle shed. It was known as \\"the Larder of Lorne\\" to poachers of red deer and salmon. John Yeoman and his wife Angela of Foster Yeoman bought the Glensanda estate from Mrs Strutt in 1982, and the Kingairloch estate in 1989, but she retained the hunting rights of both estates. In 2006 Foster Yeoman was wholly acquired by the Holcim Group and is now part of its Aggregate Industries subsidiary and is no longer family owned. Glensanda Super Quarry Glensanda quarry jetty, Loch Linnhe The quarry Gloryhole In 1976 the UK Government commissioned Sir Ralph Verney to analyse the shortage of aggregates for building. The resulting \\"Verney report\\" led John Yeoman, Chairman of Foster Yeoman, to the idea of a super-quarry situated in a remote location from which stone could be exported by sea. To this end in 1982 he bought the Glensanda estate in Argyll from Mrs Patricia Strutt who also owned the Kingairloch estate which she also sold to Foster Yeoman in 1989.Kingairloch History, A brief recent history of Kingairloch Estate Glensanda went into operation in 1986 when the first shipload of granite left for Houston, Texas, USA. In June 1989, extractions began using the \\"glory hole\\" and conveyor belt method. To minimise visual impact from the coast the quarry is sited inland, and cut down into the mountain above sea level. Each explosive blast dislodges about 70,000 tons of granite, which is transported by dump truck to the primary crusher, which reduces it to lumps no bigger than nine inches in diameter. It is then transferred by conveyor belt to a heap that covers the \\"glory hole\\", a vertical shaft in diameter, which is permanently full of rocks. At the base of the glory hole, deep inside the mountain, rocks are transferred to a horizontal conveyor and moved through a tunnel to the second crusher on the shore, where oceangoing ships are loaded in the deep-water docks at the rate of 6,000 tons per hour. In 1998 there were approximately 160 employees either live on site or commute by boat from Barcaldine, near Oban. Exports at that point were going to Amsterdam, Hamburg, Rostock and ≈öwinouj≈õcie, in Poland, as well as the Isle of Grain in the Thames Estuary. Reserves of granite are estimated to last at least until the year 2100, when the excavation will have created a new corrie square and deep.

Early life Burden was born on August 11, 1879 in Troy, New York. He was the youngest of four sons born to James Abercrombie Burden Sr. (1833‚Äì1906) and Mary Margaret Proudfit (n√©e Irvin) Burden (1837‚Äì1920). His siblings included James A. Burden II, who married Florence Adele Sloane (daughter of Emily Thorn Vanderbilt); Richard Irvin Burden; and William Proudfit Burden, who married Natica Belmont (daughter of Oliver Belmont). Burden was a grandson of merchant Richard Irvin and Scottish born entrepreneur Henry Burden, who founded Burden Iron Works of Troy, of which his brother James later served as the president of beginning in 1906. Among his relatives was uncle William Fletcher Burden, uncle-in-law Gen. Irvin McDowell, and uncle I. Townsend Burden, who was prominent in New York society and was a member of the infamous 400 of New York Society, as dictated by Mrs. Astor and Ward McAllister and published in The New York Times on February 16, 1892. Burden graduated from Harvard University with a S.B. in 1903. Career Following his graduation from Harvard, Burden was connected with the Iron Works which his father and grandfather had been president of. He later purchased a seat on the New York Stock Exchange and became a banker, working until his fall from during a hunting trip in England and then from a horse while playing polo at his estate in Jericho on Long Island, in 1913. Society life Along with his wife Cynthia, brother William, sister-in-law Natica, and close friends Reginald Vanderbilt and Alfred Vanderbilt, he was part of a notable group of the younger set in society, both in New York City and Newport, Rhode Island. His wife and sister-in-law were very close friends and \\"were girls of exceptional charm and vivacity and few rivals for popularity at the dances and other entertainments of those days.\\" Besides Arthur, many members of the group died early deaths, including sister-in-law Natica Rives Belmont (adopted daughter of George L. Rives and stepdaughter of Alva Vanderbilt Belmont) who died in 1908 of asphyxiation a few months after her marriage to William, Alfred, who died aboard the in 1915, and Reginald (father of Gloria Vanderbilt), who died from cirrhosis due to alcoholism in 1925. Personal life On June 11, 1906, he was married to the Hon. Cynthia Burke Roche (1884‚Äì1966), the daughter of James Roche, 3rd Baron Fermoy, an Irish peer who was a Member of Parliament in the House of Commons, and Frances Ellen n√©e Work, an American heiress and socialite. Among her siblings was brother Maurice Roche, 4th Baron Fermoy, the maternal grandfather of Diana, Princess of Wales. Together, they were the parents of a daughter: * Eileen Burden (1910‚Äì1970), who married Walter Maynard (1906‚Äì1971), an investment banker, in 1932. They later divorced and in 1963, she married Thomas Robins (1897‚Äì1977). Robins was the son of Thomas Robins, inventor of the conveyor belt. In late 1913, Burden fell twice from his horse and sustained injuries that caused him to be placed under constant care. As a result, in May 1921, his brother James filed a petition while his sister-in- law, Cynthia Roche's, was away in London, requesting that he be declared incompetent. Later that month, a sheriff's jury found Burden to be \\"incompetent to care for his person and property.\\" Arthur, however, died shortly thereafter, at a branch of the New York Hospital in White Plains, New York, from pneumonia on June 15, 1921. He left his entire estate to his widow. Coincidentally, ten years later in 1931, his brother James was also injured in a fall, and died the following year of an embolism as a consequence of the fall. A year after his death, his widow Cynthia was remarried to Guy Fairfax Cary Sr. and became the mother of two more children, Guy Fairfax Cary II and Cynthia Cary, who married Charles Bingham Penrose Van Pelt, and later, the newspaper publisher Edwin Fairman Russell. Russell was previously married to Lady Sarah Consuelo Spencer-Churchill, daughter of John Spencer-Churchill, 10th Duke of Marlborough. Descendants Through his daughter Eileen, he was the grandfather of Sheila Maynard, a clinical social worker who worked in Islamabad, who married Nicholas Platt (b. 1936), a career diplomat who served as U.S. Ambassador to Pakistan, Zambia and the Philippines. They are the parents of New York Magazine restaurant critic Adam Platt, actor Oliver Platt (b. 1960), and Nicholas Platt, Jr. References * Spinzia, Raymond E. and Judith A.

Ethnic structure in Subotica, the city that is cultural and political centre of Croats in Serbia, has changed at the expense of Croats.

The image has spread virally around the internet, making the Brandts, the squirrel, and Banff National Park momentarily famous. Crasher Squirrel is the name given to a squirrel seen in a photograph originally intended to be a self-portrait of a Minnesota couple; it can also refer to the resulting internet meme. Photograph The photograph was taken by Melissa Brandts and her husband Jackson while visiting Lake Minnewanka at Banff National Park in Alberta, Canada, in May 2009. While the couple were posing on some rocks next to the lake using a camera with a wireless remote shutter release to take photos of themselves, a golden-mantled ground squirrel began exploring the area. The squirrel stood up right in front of the lens, and the Brandts were able to capture the image of the squirrel, clearly in focus, in front of the camera. Popularity In August 2009, the Brandts submitted the photo to the National Geographic weekly \\"Your Shot\\" contest in a bid to have the image included in an upcoming issue. Through this appearance, the photograph spread virally across worldwide newspapers and the Internet, popularized by sites such as Cute Overload. The appeal of the picture is related to both the fact that the squirrel is perfectly in focus, and that its pose is reminiscent of the gopher from Caddyshack, with \\"paws held at chest level, eyes staring dead at the camera\\", according to Mike Celizic of The Today Show. While some questions of the photo's authenticity were raised by Matt Lauer, the Brandts were able to demonstrate that the single photo was legitimate and part of a whole set of photos that they had taken during that time period. The photo of the squirrel has since been used by the Banff tourism board to attract visitors to the area. The Park saw a brief surge in visitors shortly following the viral spread of the image, and the board set up \\"Banff National Park Squirrel\\" Twitter and Facebook pages, using the Columbian ground squirrel as an \\"ambassador\\" to Banff. The tourism board also contacted independent developers that created social media applications around the squirrel photo to include web links back to their web site. These actions led to an estimated 82 million impressions through various forms of media within a few weeks, according to the board. The squirrel was made an honorary citizen of Banff in October 2009 by Banff Mayor John Stutz. Melissa Brandts has also set up her own Facebook page for the squirrel. In response to the popularity of the photo, National Geographic November 2009 issue featured a \\"Your Shot\\" section devoted to readers' photos with animals, including the Brandts' photo. The insertion of squirrel images in other photos has furthered the meme, and has been used for photographs of official diplomatic gatherings, family portraits, and famous works of art so that the squirrel appears to be crashing these gatherings.

He was imprisoned in London, in Edinburgh and on the Bass Rock for holding private worship services. After his escape from prison he wrote A Hind Let Loose which amongst other things argues for the rights of people to resist tyrants including the bearing of arms and the resistance of taxes. It even argues that assassination, in extreme cases, is sometimes justified. Shields was one of the ministers who supported the Cameronians who disowned the king. They were brutally put down. All three of the Cameronian field-preachers, of which Shields was one, rejoined the church after the Revolution. Shields served as a chaplain to King William's armies in the Low Countries. Shields was later called to be a minister at St Andrews but did not stay there long as he joined the second Darien Expedition. After its failure he died on Jamaica under 40 years of age. Early life and student days Map of Utrecht, where Shields studied in 1680. Joan Blaeu, 1652 Alexanders Shields was born in 1661, the son of James Shields, a miller, from Haughhead in the parish of Earlston, Berwickshire. His mother was Helen Brown. He was the brother of Michael Shields, author of Faithful Contendings Displayed. He was educated at the University of Edinburgh, where he graduated M.A., \\"with no small applause,\\" whilst in his fifteenth year (7 April 1675), writing his surname Sheils. He later wrote it Sheilds; it is often printed \\"Shields\\". He began the study of divinity under Lawrence Charteris, but his opposition to prelacy led him, with others, to migrate in 1679 to Holland. He studied theology at the University of Utrecht, entering in 1680 as \\"Sheill\\". In London Newgate, the old city gate and prison On returning home he made his way to London and was private secretary to John Owen. He came into close touch with some of the leading Puritans. Supported by Nicholas Blaikie, minister of the Scottish church at Founders' Hall, Lothbury, he was licensed as preacher by Scottish presbyterians in London, declining as a Covenanter the oath of allegiance. Strict measures being taken shortly after (1684) for the enforcement of the oath, Sheilds proclaimed its sinfulness, and his licensers threatened to withdraw their licence. Shields appears to have bound himself by the Apologetical Declaration issued by James Renwick in November 1684. On Sunday, 11 January 1685, he was apprehended, with seven others, while preaching from the words in Genesis xlix., 21 : \\"Naphtali is a hind let loose,\\" ‚Äî afterwards the title of his famous Treatise. Captured by the city marshal at this conventicle in Embroiderers' Hall, Gutter Lane, Cheapside, he was brought before the lord mayor, who took bail for his appearance at the London Guildhall on the 14th. He attended on that day, but being out of court when his name was called, his bail was forfeited. Duly appearing on the 20th, he declined to give any general account of his opinions, and was committed (by his own account, decoyed) to Newgate Prison till the next quarter sessions (23 February). King Charles II died in the interval. Imprisonment in Scotland The Tolbooth (a Covenanting prison) which Shields escaped from dressed as a woman on 22 October 1686. Two keepers, John Wanse and Arthur Udney lost their jobs over the affair. Without trial in England, Shields and his friends were sent to Scotland on 5 March, arriving at Leith by the yacht Kitchen on 13 March. Shields was examined by the Scottish privy council on 14 March, and by the lords justices on 23 and 25 March, but persisted in declining direct answers. At length, on 26 March, under threat of torture, he was drawn to what he calls a \\"fatal fall\\". He signed a paper renouncing all previous engagements \\"in so far as they declare war against the king\\". This was accepted as satisfactory, but he was still detained in prison. A letter to his friend John Balfour of Kinloch, expressing regret for his compliance, fell into the hands of the authorities. They sent the two archbishops, Arthur Ross and Alexander Cairncross, with Andrew Bruce, bishop of Dunkeld, to confer with him. On 6 August he was again before the lords justices, and renewed his renunciation, adding the words \\"if so be such things are there inserted\\". A few days later he was sent to the Bass Rock; he escaped in women's clothes, apparently at the end of November 1686. Anderson says: \\"About the autumn of 1686, he with the other ministers imprisoned in the Bass were brought to Edinburgh, and had their liberty offered them, provided they would engage to live orderly. Refusing when brought before the Council, to come under this engagement, he was recommitted to the tolbooth of Edinburgh, but he succeeded in making his escape from it disguised in women's clothes.\\" In a footnote he comments: \\"Howie, in his Scots Worthies, erroneously says that it was from the Bass that Shields made his escape.\\" Activities on escape Upper Dalveen - site of a Sheills conventicle Shields made his way at once to Renwick, whom he found on 6 December 1686 at a field conventicle at Earlston Wood, parish of Borgue, Kirkcudbrightshire. On 18 October 1687 the Privy Council put a price of 100 Sterling on the heads of Shields, Renwick and Houston. On 22 December, at a general meeting of Renwick's followers, he publicly confessed the guilt of \\"owning the so-called authority\\" of James VII of Scotland. His Hind Let Loose is a vindication of Renwick's position on historical grounds. The two became fast friends, and collaborated in writing the Informatory Vindication, for which Renwick was condemned. Shields was asked to superintend its publication, but failed to find a printer. He crossed to Holland, saw the work through the Press there, and busied himself with the completion of his Hind. He went to Holland (1687) to get it printed, but returned to Scotland, leaving it at press After the death of Donald Cargill on the scaffold, the United Societies were left without a minister. They could not ordain their own ministers because in their own eyes they lacked the authority as ordination is done at Presbytery level; they did not claim to be a separate church. James Renwick was sent by them to be ordained by Dutch ministers. When Renwick was killed, also on the scaffold, Shields became their leading minister. After Renwick's execution (17 February 1688) Shields pursued his policy of field meetings, preaching on a celebrated occasion at Distincthorn Hill, parish of Galston, Ayrshire. He became the recognised leader of the United Societies, and to the general meetings of the Societies his brother Michael acted as clerk. He certainly approved of the Cameronian insurrection, under Daniel Ker of Kersland, at the end of the year, when the incumbents of churches in the west were forcibly driven from their charges. He was present at the gathering at the cross of Douglas, Lanarkshire, where these proceedings were publicly vindicated; giving out a psalm, he explained that it was the same as had been sung by Robert Bruce at the cross of Edinburgh, on the dispersion of the Spanish Armada. On 3 March 1689, with Thomas Lining and William Boyd, he took part in a solemn renewing of the covenants by a concourse of people at Borland Hill, parish of Lesmahagow, Lanarkshire. After the Revolution The Siege of Namur 1695 After the Revolution Shields joined the Church of Scotland, and was received into communion, 25 October 1690, with his associates, Thomas Linning and William Boyd. On the meeting of the first general assembly under the Presbyterian settlement, Lining, Sheilds, and Boyd presented two papers, the first asking for redress of grievances, the second (an afterthought, according to Shields) proposing terms of submission. The paper of grievances the assembly received, but declined to have publicly read, as contentious. The submission, dated 22 October 1690, was accepted on 25 October, and the three signatories were received into fellowship, with an admonition \\"to walk orderly in time coming\\". Shields was appointed on 4 February 1691 chaplain to the Cameronian regiment (26th Foot), raised in 1689 by James, Earl of Angus (1671‚Äì1692), son of James Douglas, 2nd Marquess of Douglas. He served in the Netherlands, and was present at Namur and Steinkerk. On the Peace of Ryswick he returned home, was called to St Andrews on 4 February 1696, and admitted 15 September 1697. Darien expedition \\"A New Map of the Isthmus of Darien in America, The Bay of Panama, The Gulph of Vallona or St. Michael, with its Islands and Countries Adjacent\\". On 21 July 1699 he was authorised by the commission of the general assembly to proceed, with three other ministers, Francis Borland, Alexander Dalgleish and Archibald Stobo, and a number of colonists, to Darien, this being the second expedition in pursuance of the ill-fated scheme of William Paterson. They sailed in the Rising Sun on Sunday 24 September 1699, his charge at home being supplied by brethren in his absence. Shields and his companions were really the first foreign missionaries of the Church of Scotland, the Commission of Assembly having, on 21 July, charged them \\"particularly that you labour among the natives for their instruction and conversion, as you have access.\\" He was appointed senior minister; they reached Darien late in November 1699. There were quarrels among the colonists. In a letter to the Presbytery of St Andrews, dated 2 February 1700, Shields wrote :\\"Our meetings amongst ourselves are in the woods, where the chattering of parrots, mourning of pelicans, and din of monkeys is more pleasant than the hellish language of our countrymen in their huts and tents of Kedar; and our converse with the Indians, though with dumb signs, is more satisfying than with the most part of our own people. Several of them came to our meetings for worship, and we have exercised in their families when travelling among them, where they behaved themselves very reverently, but we have neither language nor interpreter. But our people do scandalise them, both by stealing from them and teaching them to swear and drink.\\" Sheilds made some expeditions inland; at length, with Francis Borland, he crossed over to Jamaica, but had scarcely arrived there before he went down with fever. He died on 14 June 1700 in the house of Isabel Murray at Port Royal, Jamaica. He left property valued at ¬£6,483 16s. 10d. Death and burial On the failure of the Expedition, he sailed for Scotland, heart-broken by the profligacy of the settlers and the little success his labours had met among them, but died of malignant fever in the house of Isobel Murray, Port Royal, Jamaica, 14 June 1700. All attempts to identify his burial-place have failed. He was unmarried. Descendants and character Descendants of his brother Michael, who accompanied the Expedition, and of other members of his family are still found in Jamaica. Shields was \\"of low stature, ruddy complexion, quick and piercing wit, full of zeal, and firm in the cause he espoused; pretty well skilled in most branches of learning, in arguing very ready, only somewhat fiery; but in writing on controversy he exceeded most men of that age.\\" Theology According to MacPherson this is mainly from 2 books: An Enquiry into Church- Communion and A Hind Let Loose. The second of these, A Hind let Loose, is divided into a historical part and a theoretical part. At the beginning of the historical survey of the history of the Scottish Church from the Culdees downward. It is (says MacPherson) in the second half of the book that Shields‚Äô power as a thinker is manifested. Under seven heads, he discusses the fundamental social, political, and ecclesiastical questions of the day. These heads are concerning (i) hearing of curates, (ii) owning of tyrants‚Äô authority, (iii) unlawful imposed oaths, (iv) field meetings, (v) defensive arms vindicated, (vi) the extraordinary execution of judgment by private persons, and (vii) refusing to pay wicked taxations vindicated. The last-named section was added, Shields tells us, as an afterthought. Some Scottish Presbyterians were at the time refusing to pay their church rates, which went to support the establishment episcopal church, and Shields defended their practice. The first book is an appeal to the people of the \\"United Societies\\" to join the Church of Scotland which was reconstituted after the revolution. Shields made his case for unity, and against schism, in the book An Enquiry into Church-Communion. Vogan discusses the arguments in detail, applying them to various scandalous divisions.

The title of this work is biblical; but it was suggested by John Dryden's The Hind and the Panther (published April 1687). It defended the murder of Archbishop James Sharp, and charged James II with poisoning his brother. * An Elegie upon the Death of ‚Ä¶ J.

Biography  Diulgheroff was born in Kyustendil, a town in the western part of the Principality of Bulgaria, to a printer father. In 1920 and 1921, he studied at the University of Applied Arts in Vienna, Austria. The following year he studied in Dresden, Germany, and in 1923 he enrolled at the original Bauhaus in Weimar, where he was close to Swiss expressionist Johannes Itten. While a student in Germany, Diulgheroff exhibited his art in Berlin and Dresden. In 1924, he had his separate exhibition in Sofia, the capital of Bulgaria. In 1926, Diulgheroff settled in Turin, Italy, to study architecture at the Accademia Albertina, graduating in 1932. Bringing with him a characteristically Central European constructivist culture, he was introduced to many of the eminent Italian futurists, such as Fillia, and adopted that style. Diulgheroff created his most notable works in the 1920s and 1930s. Some of his art is exhibited in the Galleria Nazionale d'Arte Moderna in Rome. He contributed to the Futurist meals formulated in Filippo Tommaso Marinetti and Fillia's 1930 Manifesto of Futurist Cooking: the dish pollofiat was his idea and he co-designed the interior of the Taverna Santopalato, the prime establishment for futurist cuisine. He created posters for Cinzano and Amaro Cora and advertising for Campari. Diulgheroff was part of leading futurist exhibitions throughout the 1920s and 1930s, such as those in Turin, Leipzig, Paris, Florence, Barcelona, Mantua and Venice. Diulgheroff died in Turin, the city where he spent 56 years, in 1982. Diulgheroff remained active as an artist almost until his death. He is an honorary citizen of Turin and art historian Enrico Crispolti considers him the greatest of all interwar artists.

Origins The surname Scally is an anglicized version of the Gaelic \\"O Scolaidhe\\", which means \\"descendant of the scholar\\". It was first found in County Westmeath. The variations of the name were formed when church officials spelled the names as they were pronounced, which caused many different spellings of the surname. Variations The first recorded spelling of the family name is shown to be that of O' Scolaidhe,First recorded spelling which was dated around 1100 by the Ancient Records of Westmeath during the reign of High Kings of Ireland. The clan were forced to move to Munster by Anglo-Norman pressure. One branch of the family settled in North Tipperary while another branch settled in South Tipperary. Scullys Cross can be found near Cashel,Scullys Cross which was put there by the South Tipperary branch of the family. The form Scales is found mainly in County Clare most densely around the coast. The form Skelly is found mainly in Counties Roscommon and Westmeath. Emigration from Ireland From 1845 onwards, Ireland was gripped by the Great Famine. Well over a million Irish people fled Ireland or were deported, and between one and two million starved to death.

It serves the 10960 ZIP Code, which covers South Nyack and Upper Nyack in addition to the village. It was built in 1932 in the Classical Revival architectural style, a mode rarely used for American post offices between the wars. In the front lobby are several murals depicting scenes from local history. In 1988 it was listed on the National Register of Historic Places, and in 2004 it was renamed to honor three victims of the 1981 Brinks robbery. Building The post office is situated near the northwest corner of the intersection of Broadway and Hudson Avenue. The neighborhood is a mix of commercial, residential and institutional properties. A row of three- story brick buildings faces it from the south side of Hudson. A house is located on the north side of its driveway. It is a one-story building of buff- colored brick in Flemish bond on a raised limestone-clad basement. The east (front) elevation is a central pavilion five bays wide with single-bay wings on either end. Limestone is also used for its quoins and window trim, including recessed panels above and below each one. A cornice of that material with blocks and parapet marks the roofline. \\"UNITED STATES POST OFFICE NYACK NEW YORK 10960\\" is set in gilded metallic letters on the frieze. The three-bay side wings have similar limestone decorations save the cornice and recessed panels. The four-bay rear ends in a loading dock. A set of stairs with neoclassical bronze railings and low stone walls with claw-footed tripod lamps leads up to the centrally located main entrance. They lead to a single metal and glass door, with transom of similar material, recessed between two fluted Doric pilasters with a full Doric entablature. After passing through a wooden vestibule and small foyer, they open onto a lobby floored with terrazzo in a checkerboard pattern and grey-veined white marble wainscoting to a height of seven feet (2.3 m) on the plaster walls, which have a decorative cornice. On all sides but the west, there are murals by Jacob Getlar Smith of scenes from local history: Native Americans watching Henry Hudson sailing upriver in the Halve Maen, Dutch settlers building a log cabin and John Andr√© meeting Benedict Arnold. The north and east murals have decorative grilles as well. Two original circular bronze-and-glass customer tables remain. History The first post office in the Nyacks was established as part of a store at a landing now in Upper Nyack, in 1835. When the Erie Railroad was completed through the area in 1870, it was put within commuting distance of New York City, and grew as residents who had previously come for the summer built large houses overlooking the Hudson River to the east and lived there year-round. Congress authorized a permanent post office for the village in 1910, but it was never built. In 1926 it was reauthorized and, as the Great Depression started, construction finally began in 1931. It was opened the following year. It was designed under the leadership of James Wetmore, then Acting Supervising Architect of the Treasury Department. Wetmore was primarily a lawyer, and the actual artistic direction of the Treasury at the time was set by Louis Simon, who became Supervising Architect himself in 1935. The choice of a building so firmly in the Classical Revival style is an unusual one for the time. After World War I, the Treasury, which oversaw the design and construction of post offices and many other government buildings, began preferring the newer Colonial Revival style for its post offices, particularly those in small towns like Nyack. Neoclassical touches were often combined with modernist forms for post offices in larger cities (such as Troy's). Smith's murals were added in 1936. He had planned for them to cover all walls and be complemented by a series of smaller panels above the tellers' booths. If those were ever completed and installed, they have since been removed. The interior has been altered only by the addition of modern heating systems and lockboxes. On the outside, a new door has replaced the original double bronze doors and a wheelchair ramp has been installed across the front of the building to comply with wheelchair accessibility requirements. In 2004 Senator Charles Schumer and Representative Eliot Engel secured passage of legislation officially renaming the post office in memory of Waverly Brown, Edward O'Grady II, and Peter Paige, two local police officers and a security guard killed by members of the Black Liberation Army during the 1981 Brinks robbery at nearby Nanuet Mall. A ceremony was held in May of that year, at which relatives of the deceased spoke.

As the host of the NTV weekly news show Itogi in the 1990s, he became one of the nation's best known television journalists, criticizing government corruption and President Boris Yeltsin. In 2001, he left NTV following its takeover by the state-controlled company Gazprom, serving briefly as general manager of TV-6 before the government refused to renew its broadcasting license in January 2002. He later moved to Ukraine, where he became a presenter of various political talk shows.  Background  Kiselyov is the son of an aviation engineer. A student in Persian at Moscow State University, he later worked as an interpreter in Iran and Afghanistan during the Soviet‚ÄìAfghan War. He began his broadcast career with the Persian service of Radio Moscow in 1984, moving to television three years later. He became famous in 1991 when he refused to report official Soviet news as the USSR was losing control of the Baltic states.  Itogi host  Kiselyov was a \\"pioneering\\" television journalist in Russia in the 1990s after the dissolution of the Soviet Union, and in 1997, the New York Times described him as \\"Russia's most prominent television journalist\\". During this period, he hosted the popular weekly news show Itogi (\\"Results\\") on the independent station NTV. The show was modeled on the long-running US news program 60 Minutes. Kiselyov described Itogi's politics as \\"anti-Communist, pro-reform and pro-democracy\\", and it specialized in investigating government corruption. However, critics stated that the show was \\"excessively politicized\\", and settled scores on behalf of the station's owner. In 1999, Itogi broadcast an episode in which Kiselyov broke new ground by lambasting the administration of Boris Yeltsin, describing them as \\"the family\\", an \\"insiders' code phrase\\" for Yeltsin and his small circle of advisers. He criticized them for handpicking the latest Cabinet, comparing Yeltsin's rule to that of the Roman emperor Caligula.  Closure of independent stations  As NTV's managing director, Kiselyov was active in protests when a Russian court gave control of the station to the state-controlled company Gazprom, describing the takeover as an attempt by the government of Vladimir Putin to suppress dissent. In April 2001, he and several others were ousted from the board of directors by Gazprom. NTV's journalists condemned the cull, stating that the \\"ultimate goal of this meeting is the imposing of full political control over us\\". Along with a number of NTV journalists, he moved to rival station TV-6. With the arrival of the NTV team, TV-6's ratings more than doubled. Kiselyov continued to report on sensitive topics including corruption and the conflict in Chechnya. He also became the station's general manager. In January 2002, however, the station's broadcasting license expired and was given by the government to another company, forcing them off the air. Kiselyov called it a \\"television coup\\" showing that the authorities' \\"single goal\\" was to \\"gag\\" the station. The government disputed his statement, saying that the non-renewal of TV-6's license was \\"purely a business decision\\". In March 2002, Kiselyov teamed with the Media-Socium Group, a group of pro-Putin businesspeople that included former prime minister Yevgeny Primakov, and was re-awarded the broadcasting license to the station. A BBC News analyst stated that the new political ownership was \\"likely to ensure the journalists do not ruffle too many feathers above\\". The new station, TVS, soon ran into financial difficulties and quarrels between shareholders, and was closed by the government in June 2003 on the grounds of \\"viewers' interests\\". Though viewed as less critical than its predecessor, it had been the last television station to criticize the Putin government. With the station's end, Nezavisimaya Gazeta called Russia \\"the one-channel country\\", stating that private television had once again disappeared, and Ekho Moskvy criticized the \\"complete state monopoly of country-wide channels\\". Kiselyov stated that his priority following the closure was to find new jobs for the news staff, some of whom had now followed him through three television stations.  Move to Ukraine  In 2008, Kiselyov moved to Ukraine. He stated that he moved because working in Ukraine allowed him to be a true political journalist. \\"In Russia, there is no open political debate any more. The authorities are hermetically sealed, we can just hypothesize about the discussion going on inside ... Here [in Ukraine] you have access to tons of information, to almost any politician\\". He also said that he felt Russian journalism had developed a culture of self-censorship. Since September 2009, Kiselyov hosted a sociopolitical talk show called Big- Time Politics with Yevgeny Kiselyov on Inter TV. Kiselyov presented his (Ukrainian) shows in Russian; his guests spoke Ukrainian or Russian. On 21 May 2010, deputy head of the Administration of Ukraine Hanna Herman stated the wish that Ukraine‚Äôs most popular political talk shows be anchored only by Ukrainian journalists: \\"We are still victims to that imperial complex that 'everything coming from Moscow is good, everything Ukrainian is bad'\\". The viewership of Big-Time Politics dropped from 1 million in 2007 to 500,000 people in 2011, reflecting a general decline in interest in political talk shows. In January 2013 Inter replaced it by a political talk show hosted by Anna Bezulyk.Shuster back at Inter channel, Kyiv Post (19 February 2013) Kiselyov from then on is in charge of the news production at Inter.

Built by William the Conqueror, the castle dates to the 11th century and commands a gap in the Purbeck Hills on the route between Wareham and Swanage. The first phase was one of the earliest castles in England to be built at least partly using stone when the majority were built with earth and timber. Corfe Castle underwent major structural changes in the 12th and 13th centuries. In 1572, Corfe Castle left the Crown's control when Elizabeth I sold it to Sir Christopher Hatton. Sir John Bankes bought the castle in 1635, and was the owner during the English Civil War. His wife, Lady Mary Bankes, led the defence of the castle when it was twice besieged by Parliamentarian forces. The first siege, in 1643, was unsuccessful, but by 1645 Corfe was one of the last remaining royalist strongholds in southern England and fell to a siege ending in an assault. In March that year Corfe Castle was slighted on Parliament's orders. Owned by the National Trust, the castle is open to the public and in 2018 received around 237,000 visitors. It is protected as a Grade I listed building and a Scheduled Ancient Monument. History Ordnance Survey map of Corfe Castle in 1856, showing the castle and village in the gap of the Purbeck Hills Royal castle Corfe Castle was built on a steep hill in a gap in a long line of chalk hills, created by two streams eroding the rock on either side. The name Corfe derives from the Old English ceorfan, meaning 'a cutting', referring to the gap. The construction of the medieval castle means that little is known about previous activity on the hill. We know from contemporary writing that Anglo-Saxon nobility treated it as a residence, such as Queen √Ülfthryth, wife of Edgar, and there are postholes belonging to a Saxon hall on the site. This hall may be where the boy-king Edward the Martyr was assassinated in 978; contemporaries tell us that he went to the castle at Corfe to visit √Ülfthryth and his brother. A castle was founded at Corfe on England's south coast soon after the Norman Conquest of England in 1066. The royal forest of Purbeck, where William the Conqueror enjoyed hunting, was established in the area. Between 1066 and 1087, William established 36 such castles in England. Sitting as it does on a hill top, Corfe Castle is one of the classic images of a medieval castle. However, despite popular imagination, occupying the highest point in the landscape was not the typical position of a medieval castle. In England, a minority are located on hilltops, but most are in valleys; many were near important transport routes such as river crossings. Unusually for castles built in the 11th century, Corfe was partially constructed from stone indicating it was of particularly high status. A stone wall was built around the hill top, creating an inner ward or enclosure. There were two further enclosures: one to the west, and one that extended south (the outer bailey); in contrast to the inner bailey, these were surrounded by palisades made from timber. At the time, the vast majority of castles in England were built using earth and timber, and it was not until the 12th century that many began to be rebuilt in stone. The Domesday Book records one castle in Dorset; the entry, which reads \\"Of the manor of Kingston the King has one hide on which he built Wareham castle\\", is thought to refer to Corfe rather than the timber castle at Wareham. There are 48 castles directly mentioned in the Domesday Book, although not all those in existence at the time were recorded. Assuming that Corfe is the castle in question, it is one of four the Domesday Book attributes to William the Conqueror; the survey explicitly mentions seven people as having built castles, of which William was the most prolific. Corfe's keep (left) dates from the early 12th century. In the early 12th century, Henry I began the construction of a stone keep at Corfe. Progressing at a rate of per year for the best part of a decade, the work was complete by 1105. The chalk of the hill Corfe Castle was built on was an unsuitable building material, and instead Purbeck limestone quarried a few miles away was used. By the reign of King Stephen (1135‚Äì1154) Corfe Castle was already a strong fortress with a keep and inner enclosure, both built in stone. In 1139, during the civil war of Stephen's reign, Corfe withstood a siege by the king. It is thought that he built a siege castle to facilitate the siege and that a series of earthwork about south-southwest of Corfe Castle mark the site of the fortification. The south-west gatehouse, which allowed access from the outer bailey to the west bailey, dates from the mid 13th century. During the reign of Henry II Corfe Castle was probably not significantly changed, and records from Richard I's reign indicate maintenance rather than significant new building work. In contrast, extensive construction of other towers, halls and walls occurred during the reigns of John and Henry III, both of whom kept Eleanor, rightful Duchess of Brittany who posed a potential threat to their crowns, in confinement at Corfe until 1222. It was probably during John's reign that the Gloriette in the inner bailey was built. The Pipe Rolls, records of royal expenditure, show that between 1201 and 1204 over ¬£750 was spent at the castle, probably on rebuilding the defences of the west bailey with ¬£275 spent on constructing the Gloriette. The Royal Commission on the Historical Monuments of England noted the link between periods of unrest and building at Corfe. In the early years of his reign, John lost Normandy to the French, and further building work at Corfe coincided with the political disturbances later in his reign. At least ¬£500 was spent between 1212 and 1214 and may have been focused on the defences of the outer bailey. R. Allen Brown noted that in John's reign \\"it would seem that though a fortress of the first order might cost more than ¬£7,000, a medium castle of reasonable strength might be built for less than ¬£2,000\\". The Pipe Rolls show that John spent over ¬£17,000 on 95 castles during his reign spread; he spent over ¬£500 at nine of them, of which Corfe was one. Additional records show that John spent over ¬£1,400 at Corfe Castle. One of the secondary roles of castles was to act as a storage facility, as demonstrated by Corfe Castle; in 1224 Henry III sent to Corfe for 15,000 crossbow bolts to be used in the siege of Bedford Castle. Following John's work, Henry III also spent over ¬£1,000 on Corfe Castle, in particular the years 1235 and 1236 saw ¬£362 spent on the keep. While construction was under-way, a camp to accommodate the workers was established outside the castle. Over time, this grew into a settlement in its own right and in 1247 was granted a market and fair by royal permission. It was Henry III who ordered in 1244 that Corfe's keep should be whitewashed. Four years previously, he also ordered that the keep of the Tower of London should be whitewashed, and it therefore became known as the White Tower. In December 1460, during the Wars of the Roses Henry Beaufort and his army marched from the castle destined for the Battle of Wakefield. During the march the army split at Exeter so the cavalry could reach the north quicker, and on 16 December 1460 some of his men became embroiled in the Battle of Worksop, Nottinghamshire. Beaufort and the Lancastrians won the skirmish. Post- medieval The castle remained a royal fortress until sold by Elizabeth I in 1572 to her Lord Chancellor, Sir Christopher Hatton. Ralph Treswell, Hatton's steward, drafted a series of plans of the castle; the documents are the oldest surviving survey of the castle. Lady Mary Bankes defended the castle during two sieges in the English Civil War. The castle was bought by Sir John Bankes, Attorney General to Charles I, in 1635. The English Civil War broke out in 1642, and by 1643 most of Dorset was under Parliamentarian control. While Bankes was in Oxford with the king, his men held Corfe Castle in the royal cause. During this time his wife, Lady Mary Bankes, resided at the castle with their children. Parliamentarian forces planned to infiltrate the castle's garrison by joining a hunting party from the garrison on a May Day hunt; however they were unsuccessful. The Parliamentarians gave orders that anyone joining the garrison would have their house burned and that no supplies were to reach the castle. Initially defended by just five people, Lady Bankes was able to get food through and swell the garrison to 80. The Parliamentarian forces numbered between 500 and 600 and began a more thorough siege; it went on for six weeks until Lady Bankes was relieved by Royalist forces. During the siege the defenders suffered two casualties while there were at least 100 deaths among the besieging force. In the 17th century Corfe Castle was slighted by order of parliament. The Parliamentarians were in the ascendency so that by 1645 Corfe Castle was one of a few remaining strongholds in southern England that remained under royal control. Consequently, it was besieged by a force under the command of a Colonel Bingham. One of the garrison's officers, Colonel Pitman, colluded with Bingham. Pitman proposed that he should go to Somerset and bring back a hundred men as reinforcements; however the troops he returned with were Parliamentarians in disguise. Once inside, they waited until the besieging force attacked before making a move, so that the defenders were attacked from without and within at the same time. Corfe Castle was captured and Lady Bankes and the garrison were allowed to leave. In March that year, the town of Poole petitioned Parliament to demolish the Castle and to allocate the proceeds and any fines levied on Lady Bankes for the \\"relief and Maintenance of the Soldiers and poor Inhabitants of the said Town of Poole, and other Garrisons of that County\\", that had been loyal to Parliament. Parliament voted to slight (demolish) the castle, giving it its present appearance. In the 17th century many castles in England were in a state of decline, but the war saw them pressed into use as fortresses one more time. Parliament ordered the slighting of many of these fortifications, but the solidity of their walls meant that complete demolition was often impracticable. A minority were repaired after the war, but most were left as ruins. Corfe Castle provided a ready supply of building material, and its stones were reused by the villagers. After the restoration of the monarchy in 1660, the Bankes family regained their properties. Rather than rebuild or replace the ruined castle they chose to build a new house at Kingston Lacy on their other Dorset estate near Wimborne Minster. The first archaeological excavations were carried out in 1883. No further archaeological work was carried out on the site until the 1950s. Between 1986 and 1997 excavations were carried out, jointly funded by the National Trust and English Heritage. Corfe Castle is considered to be the inspiration for Enid Blyton's Kirrin Island, which had its own similar castle. It was used as a shooting location for the 1957 film series Five on a Treasure Island and the 1971 film Bedknobs and Broomsticks. The castle plays an important part in Keith Roberts' uchronia novel Pavane. Current status Corfe Castle's outer gatehouse Corfe Castle in 1980 before the bequest of the castle, and subsequent restoration. Upon his death, Henry John Ralph Bankes (1902‚Äì1981) bequeathed the entire Bankes estate to the National Trust, including Corfe Castle, much of the village of Corfe, the family home at Kingston Lacy, and substantial property and land holdings elsewhere in the area. In mid-2006, the dangerous condition of the keep caused it to be closed to visitors, who could only visit the walls and inner bailey. The National Trust undertook an extensive conservation project on the castle, and the keep was re-opened to visitors in 2008, and the work completed the following year.National Trust Annual Report 2004-05 During the restoration work, an \\"appearance\\" door was found in the keep, designed for Henry I. The National Trust claims that this indicates that the castle would have been one of the most important in England at the time. The castle is a Grade I listed building, and recognised as an internationally important structure. It is also a Scheduled Monument, a \\"nationally important\\" historic building and archaeological site which has been given protection against unauthorised change. The earthworks known as \\"The Rings\\", thought to be the remains of a 12th-century motte-and-bailey castle built during a siege of Corfe are also scheduled. In 2006, Corfe Castle was the National Trust's tenth most-visited historic house with 173,829 visitors. According to figures released by the Association of Leading Visitor Attractions, the number of visitors in 2010 had risen to nearly 190,000. Layout A plan of Corfe Castle from 1586, drawn up by Ralph Treswell Corfe Castle is roughly triangular and divided into three parts, known as enclosures or wards. Enclosed in the 11th century, the inner ward contained the castle's keep, also known as a donjon or great tower, which was built partly on the enclosure's curtain wall. It is uncertain when the keep was built though dates of around 1100‚Äì1130 have been suggested, placing it within the reign of Henry I. Attached to the keep's west face is a forebuilding containing a stair through which the great tower was entered. On the south side is an extension with a guardroom and a chapel. The two attachments postdate the construction of the keep itself, but were built soon after. To the east of the keep within the inner ward is a building known as the gloriette. Only ruins are left of the gloriette which was probably built by King John. The remains of the west bailey, the stone wall with three towers, date from 1202‚Äì1204 when it was refortified. It resembles the bailey of Ch√¢teau Gaillard in Normandy, France, built for Richard I in 1198.

As the Prince An peerage was not awarded \\"iron-cap\\" status, this meant that each successive bearer of the title would normally start off with a title downgraded by one rank vis-√†-vis that held by his predecessor. However, the title would generally not be downgraded to any lower than a feng'en fuguo gong except under special circumstances. The first bearer of the title was Abatai (1589‚Äì1646), the seventh son of Nurhaci, the founder of the Qing dynasty. In 1644, he was awarded the status of a junwang (prince of the second rank) by his nephew, the Shunzhi Emperor, under the title \\"Prince Raoyu of the Second Rank\\" ( doroi bayan giy≈´n wang) or simply \\"Prince Raoyu\\". The title was renamed to \\"Prince An of the Second Rank\\" in 1651 when it was passed down to Abatai's fourth son, Yolo (1625‚Äì1689). In 1723, the Yongzheng Emperor abolished the Prince An peerage on the grounds that Yolo had \\"sowed discord among key ministers and disrespected the Emperor\\". However, in 1778, the Qianlong Emperor considered Abatai and Yolo's past contributions to the Qing Empire, and decided to restore the Prince An peerage as a feng'en fuguo gong title ‚Äì the lowest possible grade for a princely peerage. Qikun, a great- great-grandson of Yolo, was selected to inherit the title. The title was passed down over a total of ten generations and was held by ten persons.

During PLT, students work on playlists and take content assessments. Playlists are essentially study lists that teachers will put together, containing useful information such as videos or sites. Content assessments are tests. Sophomores As sophomores, students take Physics, English, World History II, Mathematics II, Spanish, and an elective course. The workload increases by 30-50% from freshman year, as teachers continue to prepare students for college and for AP classes as juniors and seniors. Juniors As juniors, students take Chemistry, AP English, AP US History, Math III, Spanish, College Readiness, and another 1/2 day elective course. Seniors As seniors, students must take AP Environmental Science, AP Literature, and AP Government. Students are required to take at least one math subject, either AP Statistics or AP Calculus, some students have the option to take both, but they are not required to. All seniors must take an Expedition course or use the time for an internship. Elective courses For freshmen, sophomore, junior, and senior years, Everest students take an elective course. This period is called \\"Expeditions,\\" it was formerly called \\"Intersession\\". During this time students take an elective course. Students rank their choice of courses and then they are assigned to one of their choices. Expeditions occurs every few months, each for two week sessions, or a total of eight weeks. The courses offered at Everest are same as they are offered in other schools in the Summit Public Schools system and do not occur at the same time.  Clubs and teams  Everest has a number of teams and clubs, run by pupils and supervised by teachers. Some of them are the Music Club, Everest Forensics Teamhttps://sites.google.com/site/forensicsrwc/ (speech and debate), Culinary Diversity Club, Gender and Sexuality Alliance, Comic Club, Alliance of Latin American Students (ALAS), Creativity Club, and Young Dreamers Network (which does local and international charity work). The first club was the Asian Student Union, formed back in 2010 at the Old Building. Everest students also have the opportunity to participate in a number of team sports. New Format Towards the end of the 2012-2013 school year the faculty of Everest PHS, and its sister schools, informed parents and students that the next school year there would be some small changes. Throughout previous years, there were rumors that the schools would provide Chromebooks to students to use. Previously the school had portable computers for the students to use. In the beginning of the 2013-2014 school year, students were given Chromebooks and were told of the changes. The new changes included Self-Directed Learning, Friday PLT, the replacement of IL with PLT, replacement of tests with Content Assessments, and a new tardy policy. The new system included several online tools such as the PLP Tool, ShowEvidence, Activate Instruction, Khan Academy, and Illuminate. The PLP Tool showed students where they stand in the year, their scores for projects, and what Content Assessments they have passed and need to pass. Students can use the tool to set goals and reflect on them later. ShowEvidence is used for projects as a means of instruction and a place to turn them in. Activate Instruction, which was introduced by Diane Tavenner on March 13, 2013 on the 20th Annual California Charter Schools Conference, is used as a means to host playlists where students can take content assessments, diagnostics, and study. Khan Academy is a third party website that the school uses. Khan Academy has a variety of videos lessons and exercises available to the public for free. Illuminate, the replacement of PowerSchool, is where students would check their grades. Since the new format changes, the school no longer has semesters and grades are given as \\"Projected Grades\\" on the PLP Tool. Illuminate is instead used to show how students did on Content Assessments and diagnostics. Many students, parents, and faculty have commented that one or more of the online resources do not work well or at all. Some concerns were over how the Content Assessments did not match the content covered in the Playlists. Before the new system was introduced, parents and students were not told of the major changes. Before the beginning of the 2013-2014 school year, Activate Instruction mentioned in their press release kit they had knowledge of the major changes before students and parents were even notified. Activate Instruction used this information to promote themselves.
