History Highland County was established in 1805 with special sessions of the courts meeting in New Market. Plans for a courthouse were accepted in 1807, with John Shields having the winning entry. The structure was built in Hillsboro, the new county seat, and was a two-story brick building with a rectangular footprint. Lack of room and foundation problems led the county to plan a replacement. This replacement was submitted by Pleasant Arthur and was an example of Greek Revival architecture. This building has served as the courthouse of Highland County since its opening in 1834 and is the oldest courthouse in continuous use in Ohio. Exterior The red brick structure was originally laid out in a long rectangular plan, but additions on either side were built in 1883. The front of the building has a central entrance with a transom and fanlight above the large wooden double doors. Windows to either side of the door are rectangular in shape and are located within a recessed arch. Above each window and the door are rectangular windows with a lantern hung above the entrance. Ionic columns line the facade and support a pediment. A drum rises from the pitched roof and supports a lantern with arched vents and capped by a small dome. A weathervane tops the tower.

The J√¥f di Montasio (Italian, , , ) is located in the Province of Udine, in the Friuli-Venezia Giulia region of northeastern Italy. With its elevation of , it is the second highest mountain of the Julian Alps, surpassed only by Triglav. The Julian Alps are part of the Southern Limestone Alps System. History Since medieval times, the steep rocks of the Montasio massif, stretching about in an east-west direction, formed the natural border between the Imperial Duchy of Carinthia in the north and the Venetian Domini di Terraferma in the south. In World War I the mountain crest up to the Sella Nevea pass was part of the Italian Front and permanently manned by the Alpini. However, no hostilities happened here as the northern slope of the mountain was too steep for an attack by the Austro-Hungarian Army. Culture In the valleys around the mountain, local people speak four languages - Italian, Friulian, Slovene, and German. The original German name for the mountain was Bramkofel, while the original Slovene name was ≈†pik nad Policami or Poli≈°ki ≈†pik. However nowadays they mostly use Montasch and Monta≈æ, borrowed from the Friulian name. At the top of the mountain stands a cross and a bell in memory of Riccardo Deffar. Climbing routes There are many climbing routes from all sides. Many of them are hard rock climbing routes and ferratas, in particular from the north- east side. The normal mountaineering route is from the south side. It passes the Rifugio Brazza, at round 1650 m above the sea level. After that you can choose either the direction towards the Pipan ladder, or towards Findenegg Couloir and Suringar bivouac which is at 2400 m above the sea level. The Ladder is 60 meters long steel structure and you should have ferrata equipment. Some sections in the Findenegg Couloir route are a bit exposed, and you also have some simple scramble at several places above the Suringar bivouac.

They ruled from the early 7th century until the Saffarid conquest in 870 AD. The Zunbils are believed to be an offspring of the southern- Hephthalite rulers of Zabulistan.Andre Wink, Al-Hind, the Making of the Indo- Islamic World, Vol.1, (Brill, 1996), 115;\\"\\"The Zunbils of the early Islamic period and the Kabulshahs were almost certainly epigoni of the southern- Hephthalite rulers of Zabul.\\" The dynasty was related to the Turk Shahis of the northeast in Kabul.History of Civilizations of central Asia, B A Litivinsky Zhang Guang-Da, R Shabani Samghabadi, p.376 They are described as having Turkish troops in their service by Arabic sources like Tarikh al-Tabari and Tarikh-i Sistan. The faith and cult of this community has been little researched. According to the interpretation of Chinese sources by Marquarts and de Groots in 1915, the king of Ts'ao is said to have worn a crown with a golden fish head and was related to the Sogdians. The Temple of the Zun was recognizable by a large fish skeleton on display; this would indicate a related merchantry deityH. Miyakawa und A. Kollautz: Ein Dokument zum Fernhandel zwischen Byzanz und China zur Zeit Theophylakts In: Byzantinische Zeitschrift, S. 14 (Anhang). De Gruyter Januar 1984. .. In addition to that Marquarts states the Zunbils to have worshipped a solar deity which might have been connected to Aditya (Surya). However, according to Sh≈çshin Kuwayama there was a clear dichotomy between worshipers of the Hindu god Surya and followers of the cult of Zhun. This is exemplified by the conflict between Surya and Zhun followers, which lead to the followers of Zhun migrating southwards towards Zabulistan from Kapisa.https://repository.kulib.kyoto-u.ac.jp/dspace/bitstream/2433/48769/1/34%281%29_25.pdf According to Andr√© Wink the cult of this god was primarily Hindu, though parallels have also been noted with pre-Buddhist religious and monarchy practices in Tibet and had Zoroastrian influence in its ritual. Their territory included between what is now the city of Zaranj in southwestern Afghanistan and Kabulistan in the northeast, with Zamindawar and Ghazni serving as their capitals.Andr√© Wink, \\"Al-Hind: The Making of the Indo-Islamic World\\", Brill 1990, p. 118 The title Zunbil can be traced back to the Middle- Persian original Z≈´n-dƒÅtbar, 'Zun the Justice-giver'. The geographical name Zamindawar would also reflect this, from Middle Persian 'Zamin-i dƒÅtbar' (Land of the Justice-giver).Bosworth, Clifford Edmund. 2002. The Encyclopaedia of Islam. Leiden: Brill. Zamindawar. p.439.  History  excavated Buddhist stupa at Mes Aynak in Logar Province. Similar stupas have been discovered in neighboring Ghazni Province, including in the northern Samangan Province. According to Anthony McNicoll, \\"the Zunbils ruled in the Kandahar area for nearly 250 years until the late 9th century AD\\".Excavations at Kandahar 1974 & 1975 (Society for South Asian Studies Monograph) by Anthony McNicoll Their main capital Zamindawar was located in the present-day Helmand Province of Afghanistan. The shrine of Zoon was located about three miles south of Musa Qala in Helmand, which may still be traced today. Some believe that the Sunagir temple mentioned by the famous Chinese traveler Xuanzang in 640 AD pertains to this exact house of worship. In 653-4 AD, an army of around 6,000 Arabs were led by General Abdur Rahman bin Samara and they arrived to the shrine of Zoon in Zamindawar. It is reported that General Abdur Rahman \\"broke off a hand of the idol and plucked out the rubies which were its eyes in order to persuade the MarzbƒÅn of Sƒ´stƒÅn of the god's worthlessness.\\"Andr√© Wink, \\"Al- Hind: The Making of the Indo-Islamic World\\", Brill 1990. p 120 The General explained to the MarzbƒÅn: \\"my intention was to show you that this idol can do neither any harm nor good.\\" In 698 Ubayd Allah b. Abi Bakra lead the 'Army of Destruction' against the Zunbils and was defeated. About 700 Ibn al-Ash'ath tried again with the 'Peacock Army' which led to a mutiny.Hugh Kennedy,The Great Arab Conquests',2007, pages 194-198  Saffarid and Zunbil struggles  C.E. Bosworth writes that:  Religion  The Zunbils worshiped the Zhuna, possibly a sun god connected to the Hindu god Surya and is sometimes referred to as Zoor or Zoon. He is represented with flames radiating from his head on coins. Statues were adorned with gold and used rubies for eyes. Huen Tsang calls him \\"sunagir\\". It has been linked with the Hindu god Aditya at Multan, pre-Buddhist religious and kingship practices of Tibet as well as Shaivism. His shrine lay on a sacred mountain in Zamindawar. Originally it appears to have been brought there by Hepthalites, displacing an earlier god on the same site. Parallels have been noted with the pre-Buddhist monarchy of Tibet, next to Zoroastrian influence on its ritual. Whatever its origins, it was certainly superimposed on a mountain and on a pre-existing mountain god while merging with Shaiva doctrines of worship. Others however have connected Zun with the Sassanid Zoroastrian God ZurvƒÅn, the God of time.

Early life Flores was born in 1907 in the Maltese town of Hamrun, close to the capital Valletta. Following school he enrolled at the University of Malta (the main university on the island) and began a course in the study of law. He used this to develop his career in the legal field, finally being appointed as a judge. Political career Courts of Justice building, Valletta Flores was drawn to the political sphere, but his initial bid to get elected during the 1932 Maltese national elections was unsuccessful. However, he was eventually elected, as a candidate for the Malta Labour Party, for three successive terms during the 1950s. This period, just before independence from Great Britain, was one of turmoil for the Maltese left ‚Äî a split between the MLP and the Maltese Workers Party led to the latter forming a coalition with the Nationalists. From 1949 until 1955, Flores served as Deputy Leader of the MLP in the Assembly. It was not until 1955 that the MLP finally formed the government under the leadership of Dom Mintoff. This legislature came to be dominated by the issue of integration with the United Kingdom. Such was Flores' position within the dominant Labour grouping that he was appointed the Speaker of the Maltese Legislative Assembly that same year. He was later appointed Judge and thus he resigned as a member of the Legislative Assembly. Flores was also influential in introducing the policy of criminal probation in Malta. In 1955, he adopted some of the proposals that had been developed by Sir Alexander Paterson, HM Commissioner of Prisons for England and Malta. Paterson had suggested using the social system already in place - in Malta's case the use of the police force and priesthood.M. Montebello, 'The Impact of Radicalisation on community punishments in Malta, 2007' from Post political life Shortly before his retirement he took up a further post as vice- president of the Maltese constitutional court. Flores was gay and it has been suggested that Flores had a relationship with the Maltese editor Herbert Ganado and served as his best man.

Death The circumstances around Kriel's death have never been clearly established. According to Benzien, a security policeman known for his \\"wet-bag\\" torture of activists, he was shot by accident during a scuffle. However, forensic scientist David Klatzow believes Kriel was shot from a distance while handcuffed.

In spite of the doubts around Benzien's testimony, he was granted amnesty by the Truth and Reconciliation Commission. The Ashley Kriel Youth Leadership Development Project The project was established because of the inspiration from Cape Town youth leader Ashley Kriel who was killed by the apartheid regime in the 1980s. He is recognised as representative of students and youth of the 1980s from the Cape Flats in the Western Cape. Ashley Kriel is a symbol of youths bringing about social change in and out of the Western Cape. The program involves youth in many various platforms, including physical and electronic, the project also promotes debate about youth leadership and development. By connecting a cross-section of youth from different societies, the project aims to develop young future leaders. Memory Box Initiative Projects are combined to focus on the fostering of conversation and the sharing of personal narratives and community histories in Worcester, as means of furthering reconciliation and the impact on the IJRs Ashley Kriel Youth Leadership Development Project and Schools' Oral History. The project aims to provide a platform whereby stories of community members in Worcester can be explored through different aspects of Arts and Theatre-based activities that create space for dialogue, peace-building, social justice and public participation. The key element throughout the projects is the closing of the generational gap between youth and generations from different eras within the community's history, including the former anti-apartheid activists with the aim of encouraging the connection between the two eras by sharing experiences and memories.

GM Heritage Center - 117 - Motorama Cars - LeSabre Concept The project was a follow-up to Earl's famous 1938 Y-job. Like all his projects, it was built to be roadworthy, and became Earl's personal automobile for two years after finishing its tour of the auto show circuit. With a body made of aluminium, magnesium, and fiberglass, it was powered by a supercharged V8 able to run on gasoline (petrol) or methanol (like Indy roadsters of the period did), and had an unusually-placed rear-mounted Buick Dynaflow automatic transmission. This was later changed to a GM Hydramatic. In addition to its jet inspired design, the 1951 Le Sabre also featured numerous advanced features, including a 12-volt electrical system (most cars of the period were 6-volt), heated seats, electric headlights concealed behind the center oval \\"jet intake\\", front bumper dagmars (later made famous on 1957-9 Cadillacs), a water sensor to activate the power top, and electric lifting jacks integral to the chassis to aid tire changes. (This idea would be copied decades later by Formula One race teams.) The Le Sabre was GM's first use of a rear-mounted transmission, which would reappear in the Pontiac Tempest. It was also the first use of the aluminum-block 215, which appeared in the Buick Special and Skylark, Oldsmobile Cutlass/F-85 and Jetfire, Pontiac Tempest and LeMans, and ultimately in numerous British marques, including Rover, Land Rover, Range Rover, Triumph, MG, and Morgan. It was also GM's first use of the Le Sabre name, which would be adopted by Buick for a new line in 1959. Survivors The Le Sabre is owned by the General Motors Heritage Museum, and still occasionally appears at car shows. Reproductions In 1999 the Franklin Mint introduced a 1:24 scale die cast reproduction on the 1951 Le Sabre. It became one of their best-selling automobile miniatures. A smaller scale Le Sabre also exists as a Hot Wheels model.

It was built in 1586 during the reign of Hugues Loubenx de Verdalle, and it now serves as the official summer residence of the President of Malta.  History  The site of Verdala Palace was originally occupied by a hunting lodge, which was built in the 1550s or 1560s during the reign of Grand Master Jean Parisot de la Valette. The lodge was built in the Boschetto, a large semi-landscaped area that was used by knights of the Order of Saint John for game hunting. The hunting lodge was expanded into a palace in 1586, during the reign of Hugues Loubenx de Verdalle. It was further embellished in the 17th and 18th centuries, during the reigns of Giovanni Paolo Lascaris and Ant√≥nio Manoel de Vilhena. During the French blockade of 1798‚Äì1800, the palace served as a military prison for French soldiers captured by the Maltese or British. During British rule, it became a silk factory, but it was eventually abandoned and fell into a state of disrepair. Some repairs were undertaken during the governorship of Frederick Cavendish Ponsonby, and it was fully restored by Governor Sir William Reid in the 1850s. Prior to its restoration it was a temporal minor hospital between 1915 and 1916.http://maltaramc.com/articles/contents/greatwar.html It subsequently became the official summer residency of the Governors of Malta. It was included on the Antiquities List of 1925. On the outbreak of World War II in 1939, works of art from the National Museum were stored at the palace for safekeeping. The palace was restored in 1982 and began to be used to host visiting heads of state. Over the years, the palace welcomed several distinguished guests, including: *Edward VII and Alexandra of Denmark, King and Queen of the United Kingdom *Maria Feodorovna, Empress of Russia (1909) *George V and Mary of Teck, King and Queen of the United Kingdom (1912) *George VI, King of the United Kingdom (1913 and 1943) *Wilhelm II, Emperor of Germany (1919) *Muammar Gaddafi, Libyan dictator *Josip Broz Tito, President of Yugoslavia *Nicolae Ceau»ôescu, President of Romania *Giovanni Leone, President of Italy Since 1987, the Verdala Palace has been in use as the summer residence of the President of Malta, and it is generally closed to the public except for the August Moon Ball held annually in aid of the Malta Community Chest Fund.  Architecture  Verdala Palace was designed by Girolamo Cassar, a Maltese architect mostly known for the design of many buildings in the capital Valletta.Progetti Importanti mill-Kavallieri. Retrieved on 12 October 2016. The palace is an example of Renaissance architecture, and its design is possibly influenced by Villa Farnese in Caprarola. The building has a rectangular plan, with pentagonal bastion-like turrets on each corner. The building itself has two floors, while the corner turrets are about five storeys high. The entire structure is also surrounded by a stone quarried ditch. Although the turrets and ditch gave the palace the outward appearance of a fort, they were mainly symbolic, and the palace was never really intended to withstand any attack. Nonetheless, the palace was still armed with four pieces of artillery on the roof. The interior of the palace is very ornate, with frescoes on some of the ceilings. A chapel, stables and servant quarters are located a short distance away from the palace.  Ghost story  Verdala Palace is supposedly haunted by the \\"Blue Lady\\", a niece of Grand Master de Rohan. She was supposed to marry a particular suitor who she did not like, and he imprisoned her in her room in the palace. She tried to escape from a window but fell to her death. Her ghost is reportedly seen roaming the palace, wearing the same blue dress she wore when she died.

Lavender or self-blue refers to a plumage color pattern in the chicken (Gallus gallus domesticus) characterized by a uniform, pale bluish grey color across all feathers. The distinctive color is caused by the action of an autosomal recessive gene, commonly designated as \\"lav\\", which reduces the expression of eumelanin and phaeomelanin so that black areas of the plumage appear pale grey instead, and red areas appear a pale buff.Crawford, Roy Poultry Breeding and Genetics, Elsevier, 1990 Description The \\"lavender\\" gene (lav) in the chicken causes the dilution of both black (eumelanin) and red/brown (phaeomelanin) pigments, so according to color background, dilution due to \\"lavender\\" gives a sort of plumage color patterns: On an extended black background, this condition causes the entire surface of the body an even shade of light slaty blue, which is the typical phenotype known as '\\"self-blue\\"'. Pekin Bantam hen exhibiting the effect of lavender on a red plumage background On a red/brown color plumage background, lavender gene degrades color to beige, like in some Pekin Bantams as in the picture set aside. On the color background of the Belgian Bearded d'Uccle Bantams, frequently referred to as the \\"Mille Fleur\\" in the United States,The British Belgian Bantam Club lavender causes the pattern known as \\"porcelain\\". The resulting \\"porcelain\\" pattern is beige with each feather tipped with a V-shaped of slaty blue near the end of the feather and the feather tipped with a V-shaped white spangle.http://www.feathersite.com/Poultry/CGK/Millies/BRKMilleFleur.html BRK Mille Fleur in Feathersite.com Light and electron microscope studies have revealed that, although lavender melanocytes possess relatively normal dendrite morphology, there is defective peripheral accumulation of melanosomes to the dendrites.Mayerson PL, Brumbaugh JA: Lavender, a chick melanocyte mutant with defective melanosome translocation: a possible role for 10 nm filaments and microfilaments but not microtubules. J Cell Sci 1981, 51:25-51. This results in the patchy transfer of melanosomes into the keratinocytes of the growing feather. The dilution effect is essentially the result of a mixture of pigmented and unpigmented regions within the feather barbs.

The ultimate goal of the modern genetic studies is to find out the underlying genes involved in these traits. Lavender in chickens has been found to be a mutation caused by a single base-pair change in exon 1 of MLPH (melanophilin) gene.Vaez, M., Follett, S.A., Bed‚Äôhom, B., Gourichon, D., Tixier-Boichard, M., Burke, T. 2008 A single point mutation within the melanophilin gene causes the lavender plumage colour dilution phenotype in the chicken.

In Japanese quail The lavender phenotype in Japanese quail (Coturnix coturnix japonica) is a dilution of both eumelanin and phaeomelanin in feathers that produces a blue- grey colour on a wild-type feather pattern background. Studies of intergeneric hybridization proved that the lavender mutation in quail is homologous to the same phenotype in chickenF. Minvielle, D. Gourichon and J. L. Monvoisin. 2002 Testing homology of loci for two plumage colors, \\"lavender\\" and \\"recessive white\\", with chicken and Japanese quail hybrids. Journal of Heredity Vol. 93, Issue 1 Pp. 73-76. In this species, the lavender phenotype is associated with a non-lethal complex mutation involving three consecutive overlapping chromosomal changes (two inversions and one deletion) that have consequences on the genomic organization of four genes (MLPH and the neighbouring PRLH, RAB17 and LRRFIP1). The deletion of PRLH has no effect on the level of circulating prolactin. Lavender birds have lighter body weight, lower body temperature and increased feed consumption and residual feed intake than wild- type plumage quail, indicating that this complex mutation is affecting the metabolism and the regulation of homeothermy.Bertrand Bed‚Äôhom, Mohsen Vaez, Jean-Luc Coville, David Gourichon, Olivier Chastel, Sarah Follett, Terry Burke and Francis Minvielle 2012 The lavender plumage colour in Japanese quail is associated with a complex mutation in the region of MLPH that is related to differences in growth, feed consumption and body temperature.

It was adapted for television and produced by Donald Wilson and was originally shown in twenty-six episodes on Saturday evenings between 7 January and 1 July 1967 on BBC2, at a time when only a small proportion of the population had television sets able to receive the channel. It was therefore the Sunday night repeat run on BBC1, starting on 8 September 1968, that secured the programme's success with 18 million tuning in for the final episode in 1969.

However, Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer held the rights to the novels, having adapted the first novel A Man of Property into That Forsyte Woman in 1949. After a distribution arrangement with MGM was reached in 1965, the series developed into a groundbreaking 26-part serial, depicting the fortunes of the Forsyte family between 1879 and 1926.The Forsyte Saga at BFI screenonline, URL accessed 12 October 2009 The Forsyte Saga was the last major British drama serial to be made in black and white, even though the BBC was beginning to equip for full-time colour transmission. In an interview for the DVD release, Wilson admits he would have loved to have shot the programme in colour, but delaying recording would have meant re-casting and he felt he had the perfect cast for the adaptation. The series was a gamble for the BBC, with a budget of ¬£10,000 per episode. Although never credited, the music that opens and closes each episode is the first movement, \\"Halcyon Days\\", from the suite The Three Elizabeths written in the early 1940s by Eric Coates. Plot The series was adapted from the three novels and two interludes of John Galsworthy's Forsyte Saga: The Man of Property (1906), Indian Summer of a Forsyte (1918), In Chancery (1920), Awakening (1920) and To Let (1921); and Galsworthy's later trilogy A Modern Comedy.

This was originally intended to encourage viewers to switch over to BBC2, which had launched in 1964. However, only a small proportion of the viewing public could receive the channel as it was broadcast on the then-new 625-line broadcasting system, which required a new TV set to receive, compared to the old 405-line system that BBC1 (and ITV) were broadcast on. It was when the series was later repeated on Sunday evenings on BBC1, starting on 8 September 1968, that the programme's success was secured with 18 million tuning in for the final episode in 1969. It is often quoted that both publicans and clergymen in the United Kingdom complained that the Sunday night repeats were driving away customers and worshippers, respectively, and there are tales of Sunday Evensong services being moved to prevent a clash with the broadcast.David Pickering, The Forsyte Saga at the Museum of Broadcast Communication], URL accessed 12 October 2009 A retrospective on the series by when it was screened by the American PBS in the Masterpiece Theatre slot comments: > Viewers remember the way the nation shut down each Sunday night for the > event.

Following its success in Britain, the series was shown in the United States on public television and broadcast all over the world, and became the first BBC television programme to be sold to the Soviet Union. The worldwide audience was estimated as something in the region of 160 million. The series won a Royal Television Society Silver Medal and a BAFTA for Best Drama Series or Serial. Following its transmission in 1967 by RT√â, Ireland's public broadcaster, the BBC production won a Jacob's Award at the annual presentation ceremony in Dublin.The Irish Times, \\"RT√â advised to fight defeatism\\", 7 December 1967 The series' success prompted companies to invest in similarly scaled drama serials, which resulted in programmes such as Upstairs, Downstairs and The Pallisers. Writing after a new adaptation was produced by Granada Television in 2002, Sarah Crompton noted that even Galsworthy's novels paled in comparison to the television series, noting that the adaptation set a lasting precedent for television dramas: > Poor old Galsworthy may in his day have won the Nobel prize for literature, > but now he is just a footnote in televisual history ‚Äì the begetter of the > most popular classic serial of all time.

Life and work  De Quir√≥s was born in Gualeguay, Entre R√≠os Province, in 1879. He began to paint at age eight, and shortly afterwards, created a facial composite sketch that resulted in a fugitive criminal's apprehension. De Quir√≥s was a restless student, and often skipped classes to spend time among the area's gauchos; during one such opportunity, he witnessed a duel and, inspired by the event, created his first known painting. His father, a Spanish Argentine immigrant from the Asturias region, became alarmed at the boy's poor attendance record at school and, following his wife's 1895 death, enrolled his son in a Buenos Aires boarding school. There, he became acquainted with visiting Spanish painter Vicente Cotanda, who gave the young artist his first formal training, and later, de Quir√≥s was accepted into the Fine Arts Academy, where he was mentored by realist painters √Ångel Della Valle and Ernesto de la C√°rcova. A full scholarship from the Entre R√≠os provincial government to receive further arts education in Rome was presented to the artist in 1898, though his father's own objection to the award resulted in its cancellation (Juan de Quir√≥s, who had been recently elected city councilman in Gualeguay, objected on the belief that his son had not yet merited such an honor). The setback proved to be temporary, however, and Ces√°reo earned the Rome Prize from the Spanish Royal San Fernando Fine Arts Academy in 1899, entitling him to a three-year apprenticeship in the academy's Roman affiliate. He then relocated to Mallorca, the largest of the scenic Balearic Islands of Spain, and lived there until 1910, making brief visits to Rome for the 1905 World's Fair, to the Venice Biennale, and to Buenos Aires, where he exhibited on Florida Street alongside P√≠o Collivadino and Fernando Fader. The latter 1906 event established the Nexus Group, which popularized post-impressionism among Argentina's conservative clientele. Mar√≠a Antonelli, an unhappily married 18-year-old resident of Florence, met de Quir√≥s during this interim, running away with him and eventually bearing him two children. He again returned briefly to Argentina in 1910 to attend the Centennial Exposition. Exhibiting 26 works, he earned a Gold Medal for his Horse Race for the Ring on Independence Day, which drew on his childhood memories of gauchos and their ring lancing contests, and was purchased by the new Provincial Fine Arts Museum in Paran√°. Increasingly well known, he purchased a villa in Settignano, Tuscany, and later, an apartment in Paris, where he regularly hosted a number of other Argentine √©migr√©s. The 1914 death of his estranged father, as well as the outbreak of World War I, prompted de Quir√≥s to relocate to the family home in Gualeguay. A patron of the arts, President Victorino de la Plaza had 72 of his works added to his National Fine Arts Commission's collection in 1915, and continued success locally, in Chile and in Uruguay allowed de Quir√≥s to purchase a large atelier facing the Palermo Rose Garden in Buenos Aires. His marriage suffered, however, and their 1923 separation led de Quir√≥s to purchase a secluded estancia in Entre R√≠os Province. The historic property, which had belonged to the daughter of 1850s-era President Justo Jos√© de Urquiza, provided the setting for his series \\"the gauchos\\", naturalist paintings which became his best-known works, and which he exhibited and sold world-wide; his professional success was marred, however, by the loss of his daughter Carlota in the late 1920s. Purchasing a 260-hectare (650-acre) estancia near Paran√° in 1938, he changed his focus towards landscape art, and in 1939, the National Fine Arts Museum exhibited and acquired a number of his works. Leopoldo Lugones, perhaps the most prominent Argentine poet of his day, considered de Quir√≥s \\"our national painter\\". The artist relocated in 1947 to an equestrian estate in upscale Buenos Aires suburb of Vicente L√≥pez, where one of his neighbors was a close friend, Florencio Molina Campos (arguably Argentina's leading figure in na√Øve art). He earned a Grand Prize at the Madrid Biennale in 1951, and in 1960 married Yole Lanzelotti, a soprano. Thirty works from his series \\"the gauchos\\" were acquired by National Fine Arts Museum in 1965, and his native province awarded him with their Legion of Merit in 1967. Two days after his 89th birthday, Ces√°reo Bernaldo de Quir√≥s died in his Vicente L√≥pez home; though the planned pavilion bearing his name at the National Fine Arts Museum was never built, the Pedro E. Mart√≠nez Provincial Fine Arts Museum in Paran√° created the Sal√≥n Quir√≥s, housing the largest single collection of his works; another significant collection was established near Vicente L√≥pez at the Tigre Art Museum.

Founded in the 1760s by Ma Mingxin, it was active in the late 18th and 19th centuries in what was then Gansu Province (also including today's Qinghai and Ningxia), when its followers were involved in a number of conflicts with other Muslim groups and in several rebellions against China's ruling Qing dynasty. The name comes from the Arabic word jahr (ÿ¨Ÿáÿ±), referring to their practice of vocally performing the dhikr (invocation of the name of God). This contrasted with the more typical Naqshbandi practice of performing it silently, as observed by the Khufiyya or Old Teaching. History Foundation and principles The Jahriya order was founded by the Gansu Chinese-speaking Muslim scholar Ma Mingxin soon after his return to China in 1761, after 16 years of studying in Mecca and Yemen.Gladney (1996), pp. 48-50Lipman (1988), pp. 86-88 He had studied there under a Naqshbandi Sufi teacher named 'Abd al-KhƒÅliq (known to the Chinese Muslims as \\"Abu Duha Halik\\"), who was a son of az-Zayn b. Muhammad 'Abd al-Baqƒ´ al-Mizjaji (1643/44‚Äì1725), originally from Mizjaja near Zabƒ´d, Yemen. Az-Zayn, in turn, had studied in Medina under the famous Kurdish mystic Ibrahƒ´m ibn Hasan al-K≈´rƒÅnƒ´ (1616‚Äì1690), who was known for advocating the vocal (rather than silent) dhikr. Ma Mingxin's Jahriyya menhuan (order) was the second Naqshbandi order in China after Ma Laichi's Khufiyya. Unlike the \\"silent\\" Khufiyya Sufis and following al-Kurani's teaching, Jahriyya adherents advocated vocal dhikr, which is reflected in the name of their school (from Arabic jahr, \\"aloud\\"). Ma Mingxin also opposed the emphasis that the Khufiyya members placed of the veneration of the saints, construction of grandiose elaborately decorated mosques and the enrichment of religious leaders at the expense of their adherents. \\"The Saw\\"(ŸÖŸÜÿ¥ÿßÿ±) (Min≈°ƒÅr) (ÊòéÊ≤ô‰∫Ü Mingshale \\"Shining Sand\\") was an 18th-century Jahriyya text. The early Jahriyya-Khufiyya conflict, the Salar Revolt of 1781 and the death of Ma Mingxin By the early 1780s, the Jahriyya movement had spread over much of the then province of Gansu (which at the time also included today's Qinghai and Ningxia), as had the late Ma Laichi's Khufiyya menhuan. Theological arguments between members of the two menhuans, as well as the orders' claim on members' contributions, against the background of government mismanagement of the provincial revenue, often resulted in both violent conflicts and lawsuits.Lipman, pp. 107-111Lipman, p. 96 (on fiscal mismanagement) The escalating conflict between the adherents of the two movements eventually attracted attention of the Qing government in 1781. The apparent center of the conflict at the time was in the ethnic Salar community of Xunhua County (in today's Qinghai Province, just west of today's Gansu's Linxia Prefecture). Considering the Jahriyya (dubbed by the government The New Teaching, in opposition to the \\"Old Teaching\\", i.e. the Khfiyya and the non-Sufi (gedimu) Muslims) subversive, the authorities had Ma Mingxin arrested, even though he wasn't personally anywhere around Xunhua at the moment. While Ma Mingxin was kept in Lanzhou, the Hezhou adjutant general Xinzhu and the prefect of Lanzhou Yang Shiji went to Xunhua with a small military detachment to take care of the Jahriyya business. The Jahriyya Salars sent a \\"welcoming party\\" to meet them, led by the ahong (imam) nicknamed Su Sishisan (\\"Su Forty-three\\", ËãèÂõõÂçÅ‰∏â). Having met the government expedition at the place called Baizhuangzi, Su's people first pretended to be the friendly \\"Old Teaching\\" Muslims, but once they'd learned about the purpose of the government expedition, they pulled out their weapons, overpowered the government soldiers, and killed both Qing officials. This action immediately made the Jahriya Salars not just \\"subversives\\" but outright rebels in the eyes of the government. While openly confronting the government was obviously a suicidal act for Su's followers, modern researchers [Lipman (1998, p. 108)] surmise that they were motivated by the perceived threat of massacre against their menhuan.Lipman, p. 108 After destroying the government force at Baizhuangzi, Su's two thousand Salar fighters then rushed east, across the today's Linxia Prefecture and to the walls of Lanzhou; on the way, they had briefly besieged Hezhou and killed some \\"Old Teaching\\" followers there, to punish them for goading the government into anti-Jahriyya action. When the besieged officials brought Ma Mingxin, wearing chains, to the Lanzhou city wall, to show him to the rebels, Su's Salars at once showed respect and devotion to their imprisoned leaders. Scared officials took Ma down from the wall, and beheaded him right away. Su's Salars tried attacking the Lanzhou city walls, but, not having any siege equipment, failed to penetrate into the walled city. The Salar fighters (whose strength at the time is estimated by historians to be in 1,000-2,000 range) then set up a fortified camp on a hill south of Lanzhou. To deal with the rebels, Imperial Commissioners Aguihttp://www.dartmouth.edu/~qing/WEB/A-KUEI.htmlhttp://www.dartmouth.edu/~qing/WEB/CH'ANG- LING.html and Heshen were sent to Lanzhou. Unable to dislodge the Salars from their fortified camp with his regular troops, Agui sent the \\"incompetent\\" Heshen back to Beijing,http://www.dartmouth.edu/~qing/WEB/HO-SHEN.html and recruited Alashan Mongols and Southern Gansu Tibetans to aid the Chinese Lanzhou garrison. After a three months' siege of the rebel camp and cutting off the Salars' water supply, Agui's joint forces destroyed the Jahriya rebels; Su and all his fighters were all killed in the final battle. Government repression The Jahriya was (known as \\"the New Teaching\\" to the Qing administrators of the time), was now a patently dangerous organization in the eyes of the authorities. In the aftermath of the Salar revolt, Ma Mingxin's widow, whose surname was Zhang (originally, from Gansu's Tongwei County), and his daughters were exiled to Xinjiang.Lipman, pp. 112-113 It is stated elsewhere that \\"all his family\\" (excluding, presumably, his wife and daughters) were exiled to Yunnan.Lipman, pp. 179-181 Other Jahriya adherents were captured and exiled as well. Occasionally, mistakes were made, when many non-Jahriyya Muslims (notably Ma Wuyi - the third leader of the \\"good\\" Khufiyya) were caught and sent to the southwest (Yunnan etc.) as well.Lipman, p. 179 Early succession During his life, Ma Mingxin strongly criticized the competing Khufiyya order for passing its leadership from the order's founder, Ma Laichi, to his son, Ma Guobao. Ma Mingxin himself chose his own successor as the head of the Jahriyya based on his Islamic scholarship and piety; later on, the third leader of the order was chosen in a similar way. Tian Wu's rebellion (1784) Ma Mingxin's death did not stop conflicts with China's Muslim community, or those between the Muslims and the government. Three years after the death of Ma Mingxin, a Jahriyya ahong (imam) named Tian Wu, started a rebellion against the imperial government. It was centered in the eastern part of the then Gansu Province (including Guyuan, which is within today's Ningxia) - a very different, Hui rather than Salar, region from the Xunhua County of the 1781 rebellion. It took the Qing forces several months to quell Tian Wu's rebellion. As it happens too often during suppression of rebellions, many non-combatants perished as well; it is reported that Li Shiyao's forces executed over a thousand of women and children of in Jahriyya communities of Eastern Gansu.http://www.dartmouth.edu/~qing/WEB/LI_SHIH-YAO.html The Jahriyya was proscribed again, despite objections of some government officials (notably, one Fuk'anggan) who felt that a blanket prohibition would be counterproductive.http://www.dartmouth.edu/~qing/WEB/FU-K'ANG-AN.html In view of modern historians, the suppression of Jahriyya was indeed counterproductive, since the dispersion of the order's throughout the country allowed them to widely popularize their idea among China's Muslims. It also increased the attractiveness of the now-underground order to all Muslims discontent with the government's policies. This period was also characterized by the creation of Jahriyya literature. Written by the order's ahongs in Arabic and Persian, numerous miracle stories praised Ma Mingxin and his successors. Relocation to Ningxia, and the Great Northwest Hui Rebellion The nineteenth century brought significant changes to the Jahriyya. While the order's second and third leaders were selected primarily based on their abilities, the fourth shaikh, Ma Yide (late 1770s - 1849), who assumed the leadership position in 1817, was the son of the third. From this point on the leadership succession in the Jahriyya was usually on the hereditary principle, as it was common in menhuans in general. Although the 18th-century Jahriyya was primarily based in central Gansu, by the mid-19th century the order's activity was centered in the northern Ningxia (which in the 19th century was also part of Gansu Province), its headquarters being located in Jinjipu (ÈáëÁßØÂ†°),Some authors, e.g. Michael Dillon and Kim Hodong, transcribe the town's ÈáëÁßØÂ†° as Jinjibao (since Â†°, meaning \\"fort\\", has pronunciation bao). However, Lipman's Jinjipu is probably more correct, because dictionaries also say that Â†°, when used as a suffix in place names, is pronounced pu. a few kilometers south from today's Wuzhong City. Under the leadership of Ma Yide and his successor, the order's fifth shaikh Ma Hualong (d. 1871), the town of Jinjipu became an important religious and commercial center, and the menhuan's leaders grew wealthy thanks to the order's profitable participation in the caravan trade across Inner Mongolia, between Baotou, Huhhot and Beijing. During the Great Northwest Hui Rebellion, which started in 1862, Ma Hualong's Jahriyya led the rebellion in the Jahriyya-heavy eastern parts of the 19th-century Gansu Province,Until the early 20th century, Gansu Province also included today's Ningxia and Qinghai i.e. today's Ningxia and easternmost sections of today's Gansu.Dillon (1999), pp. 66-68 While the rebels elsewhere within the 19th-century borders of Gansu had been primarily controlled by their own, essentially independent leaders - notably, Ma Zhan'ao in Hezhou (now Linxia), Ma Guiyuan in Xining, and Ma Wenlu in Suzhou (Jiuquan) - Jahriyya members participated in the rebellion throughout the region.Lipman (1998), p. 121 Ma was besieged in Jinjipu in July 1869 by the Qing forces led by General Zuo Zongtang.Dillon, p. 66. The book does not actually state the year, but it appears to be 1869 from the context. After fortifications outside of the town itself had been captured by the government troops, and starvation started inside the walls, Ma Hualong surrendered in January 1871, hoping to spare the lives of his people. However, once Zuo's troops entered Jinjipu, a massacre followed. Over a thousand people lost their lives, and the town was destroyed. According to most accounts, Ma Hualong himself was executed on Zuo's orders on March 2, 1871, along with his son Ma Yaobang and over eighty Jahriyya officials.Dillon (1999), pp. 124-126 In the western section of the Yunnan Province, Jahriyya - brought there in the 18th century by exiles from Gansu, notably by the relatives of Ma Mingxin exiled there after the suppression of the rebellion 1781 - was active as well. One of the Jahriyya leaders in Yunnan was Ma Shilin, said to be a direct descendant of Ma Mingxin himself. Ma Shilin traveled twice to Ningxia, visiting Ma Hualong in Jinjipu, and when Du Wenxiu started the Panthay Rebellion in Yunnan, Ma Shillin became one Du's commanders. After defending the fortress of Donggouzhai for a year against the Qing forces, he chose to commit suicide rather than to become a prisoner of the Qing. Restoration under Ma Yuanzhang After the disaster of Jinjipu, and the death or capture of most of Ma Hualong's family, it became the task of Ma Shilin's son, Ma Yuanzhang (the 1850s - 1920) to restore the menhuan. Ma Yuanzhang and his brothers survived the destruction of the Jahriyya leadership in Ningxia and Yunnan because their fathers had sent them to Sichuan, away from the fighting. Now, when the dust settled, Ma Yuanzhang and his brothers, disguised as merchants, traveled to Gansu to assess the situation. They discovered that two of Ma Hualong's grandsons, Ma Jincheng and Ma Jinxi, survived the disaster at Jinjipu. Imprisoned in Xi'an, the two boys were sentenced to be castrated upon reaching the age of 12. Too late to save the older boy from ending his days as a eunuch slave, Ma Yuanzhang managed to spirit away, intact, the younger one. This boy, Ma Jinxi, survived in hiding (with a Hui family in Hangzhou, and elsewhere), until, years later, Ma Yuanzhang managed to obtain a pardon for him.Lipman (1998), pp. 179-181). Meanwhile, Ma Yuanzhang set himself up as a leather merchant. This allowed him to visit scattered Jahriyya communities all over eastern China, gaining the respect of the surviving members of the order. He married to a female relative of Ma Malaichi, thus solidifying his claim of legitimate succession. After yet another Muslim rebellion Gansu - this time, triggered by factional strife within the Jahriyya's old rival, the Khufiyya order - blew up and was suppressed in 1895, Ma Yuanzhang returned to Gansu, and re-established the Jahriyya organization, now headquartered in Zhangjiachuan County - an area in eastern Gansu almost exclusively populated by the Hui refugees from Shaanxi, resettled there by Zuo Zongtang after the defeat of the Great Muslim Rebellion in the early 1870s. However, the pardoned Ma Jinxi felt himself to be the more legitimate successor of Ma Hualong; so he set up a rival Jahriyya organization, based in northern Ningxia, not far from his grandfather's former Jinjipu headquarters. A split within the Jahriyya followed, with some members becoming followers of Ma Jinxi, and others holding for Ma Yuanzhang. Later history The Jahriyya order continues to this day, even if in more covert forms. In remembrance of Ma Mingxin, whose beard is said to have been shorn by government soldiers before his execution 1781, many Jahriyya members shave the sides of their beards.Gladney (1996), pp. 52-53 In 1985, over 20,000 Chinese Muslims assembled at the site of Ma Mingxin's original (destroyed) tomb near Lanzhou for a commemoration ceremony. The tomb has since been rebuilt.

She is known from her correspondence, including a birthday invitation she received from Claudia Severa. Description A letter from Claudia Severa inviting Sulpicia Lepidina to her birthday party. Sulpicia Lepidina received two letters from Claudia Severa, wife of Aelius Brocchus, commander of a nearby fort.Alan Bowman and David Thomas, Vindolanda: the Latin writing tablets London: Society for the Promotion of Roman Studies, 1983, pp. 256 One of the letters from Severa is an invitation to a birthday party, which is perhaps the best-known of the Vindolanda tablets now at the British Museum. The invitation is partly written by a scribe and partly by Severa herself. Along with another tablet (a fragment with a closure written in Severa's hand), the invitation is thought to be the oldest extant writing by a Roman woman found in Britain, or perhaps anywhere. The subject-matter of the letters is social and personal, and Severa calls Lepidina her sister. Sulcipia Lepidina also received a letter from another woman. While the name of the woman is difficult to read, the subject matter is legible. In this letter the woman, thought to be called Paterna, speaks of remedies that she plans to bring to Lepidina. The letters were written in ink on wooden tablets found during excavations at Vindolanda in the 1970s. Vindolanda was a Roman fort built where two streams conjoined and, as a result, the floors of the fort were thick with mosses, bracken and straw. The Vindolanda tablets were found in this thick carpet and filled-in ditches. Their preservation was due to the waterlogged soil conditions on parts of the Vindolanda site.

Formation The party was founded in 1994 in Massachusetts, United States of America. Its permanent headquarters in Luanda, Angola. Presidential Election After the 2008 parliamentary elections, the first time in 17 years that Angola went to the polls, the MPLA-government proposed that presidential elections be held in September 2009. Earlier that year the MPLA's leader, Jos√© Eduardo dos Santos, declared that the approval of a new constitution was the highest priority for his party. In his New Year's address, Dos Santos also stated that his party will propose, through its parliamentary members, the creation of an \\"ad hoc\\" committee in the National Assembly, which would be in charge of preparing the new draft constitution and \\"promoting, whenever appropriate, a broad discussion [of the draft] before approval by the Parliament\\". Dos Santos did not mention the future presidential election, and, in so doing, fueled rumors that the Angolans will not return to the polls in 2009, as they had expected. There has been a range of speculation on Angolan blogs and media about the reasons behind this. Carlos Alberto Contreiras Gouveia, the Republic Part of Angola's president, said that the MPLA are facilitating the constitutional amendment process to perpetuate Dos Santos' presidential power by an indirect-electoral process that violates the constitution. In August 2009, the former US Secretary of State, Hillary Clinton, urged Angola to hold credible elections - \\"we look forward to Angola building on this positive step by including adopting of a new constitution, investigating and prosecuting past human rights abuses and holding timely, free and fair elections,\\".

Background Li Cheng was probably born in about 766. He was a fifth-generation descendant of Li Shenfu (ÊùéÁ•ûÁ¨¶) the Prince of Xiangyi, who was a cousin of Tang Dynasty's founding emperor Emperor Gaozu.New Book of Tang, vol. 131. His grandfather Li Bo (ÊùéÊüè) served as the minister of husbandry, and his father Li Su (ÊùéÈ∑´) served as a prefectural prefect.Li Cheng's biography in the Old Book of Tang did not give his grandfather's name, and gave his father's name as Li Subo (ÊùéÈ∑´‰ºØ). See Old Book of Tang, vol. 167. The table of the chancellors' family trees in the New Book of Tang gave his grandfather's name, and further indicated that his father's name was Li Su, apparently expressing skepticism that his father's name would have the character \\"Bo\\" given that his grandfather's name was Li Bo, albeit of a different character, due to naming taboo. See New Book of Tang, vol. 70. In 796, Li Cheng passed the imperial examinations as a Jinshi, and further passed a special examination in grand speech. Thereafter, he served on the staff of several military governors (Jiedushi). In 804, he returned to the capital Chang'an to serve as an imperial chancellor with the title Jiancha Yushi (Áõ£ÂØüÂæ°Âè≤), and later that year became an imperial scholar (Áø∞ÊûóÂ≠∏Â£´, Hanlin Xueshi). After then-reigning Emperor Dezong died in 805 and was succeeded by his son Emperor Shunzong, Li was pushed out of the office of the imperial scholars by fellow imperial scholar Wang Shuwen, a trusted advisor to Emperor Shunzong, and he thereafter served three terms as low-level officials in various ministries.Old Book of Tang, vol. 167. During the reigns of Emperors Xianzong and Muzong During the middle of the Yuanhe era (806-820) of Emperor Shunzong's son Emperor Xianzong, Li Cheng was sent out to Xichuan Circuit (Ë•øÂ∑ù, headquartered in modern Chengdu, Sichuan) to serve as the military commander of the circuit. In 815, he was recalled to Chang'an to serve as the deputy minister of defense (ÂÖµÈÉ®‰æçÈÉé, Bingbu Shilang) and also became in charge of drafting imperial edicts. When the general Han Hong was made the overall commander of Emperor Xianzong's campaign against the warlord Wu Yuanji that year,Zizhi Tongjian, vol. 239. Li was sent to the battlefront to declare Han's commission. In 816, he was made Zhongshu Sheren (‰∏≠Êõ∏Ëàç‰∫∫), a mid-level official at the legislative bureau of government (‰∏≠Êõ∏ÁúÅ, Zhongshu Sheng), as well as acting mayor of the capital municipality Jingzhao (‰∫¨ÂÖÜ). In 817, he was responsible for the imperial examinations that year. In 818, he was made the deputy minister of rites (Á¶ÆÈÉ®‰æçÈÉé, L«êbu Shilang), but was soon made the governor (ËßÄÂØü‰Ωø, Guanchashi) of Eyue Circuit (ÈÑÇÂ≤≥, headquartered in modern Wuhan, Hubei), as well as the prefect of Eyue's capital E Prefecture (ÈÑÇÂ∑û). At a later point, he was recalled to serve as the deputy minister of civil service affairs (ÂêèÈÉ®‰æçÈÉé, L√¨bu Shilang, note different tone), and created the Baron of Weiyuan. During the reign of Emperor Jingzong In 824, shortly after the death of Emperor Xianzong's son and successor Emperor Muzong and succession by Emperor Muzong's son Emperor Jingzong, Li Cheng, who was then still the deputy minister of civil service affairs, was given the additional designation Tong Zhongshu Menxia Pingzhangshi (Âêå‰∏≠Êõ∏ÈñÄ‰∏ãÂπ≥Á´†‰∫ã), making him a chancellor de facto. (It was said that Li Cheng was named because Emperor Jingzong inquired of another chancellor, Li Fengji, of who might be appropriate chancellors; Li Fengji listed a number of officials, and of Li Fengji's list, Li Cheng was listed first, and so was made chancellor.)Zizhi Tongjian, vol. 243. At that time, Emperor Jingzong, who was young, wanted to build and rebuild many palaces. Li Cheng pointed out that Emperor Jingzong was still new to the throne and still in the mourning period for Emperor Muzong, and that it was inappropriate for him to undertake these construction projects. Under his suggestion, the raw material that Emperor Jingzong had gathered were diverted to repair the various imperial tombs. Li Cheng also suggested, along with Wei Chuhou, that the senior official Pei Du, who had been ejected out of the capital due to discord with Li Fengji, be honored, and under Wei's and Li Cheng's suggestion, Emperor Jingzong gave Pei an honorary chancellor title. Li Cheng also suggested that imperial scholars be appointed to attend to Emperor Jingzong in his studies. It was said that Li Cheng was eloquent and calculating, and he was able to change Emperor Jingzong's mind. He was soon made Zhongshu Shilang (‰∏≠Êõ∏‰æçÈÉé), the deputy head of the legislative bureau, and created the greater title of Duke of Pengyuan, while continuing to serve as chancellor. In 825, there was an incident in which one Wu Zhao (Ê≠¶Êò≠) was accused of threatening to kill Li Fengji. Previously, after Wu had served as a prefectural prefect, he sought a better appointment, but was given the largely powerless position of serving as secretary general to Emperor Jingzong's granduncle Li Shen (ÊùéÁ¥≥) the Prince of Yuan. Li Cheng, who was friendly with Wu, wanted to give Wu a more useful position, but Li Fengji, who by that point was no longer friendly to Li Cheng, opposed, and Li Cheng's relative Li Rengshu (Êùé‰ªçÂèî) informed Wu of this. Once, when Wu became drunk, he made the remark to his friend Mao Hui (ËåÖÂΩô) that he was going to kill Li Fengji. When this was reported, Wu was arrested. Li Fengji's follower Li Zhongyan suggested to Mao that, if Mao was willing to implicate Li Cheng, he would be rewarded. Mao refused. As a result of the subsequent investigations, Wu was executed by caning; Li Rengshu was demoted; and Li Zhongyan and Mao were exiled. In 826, Li Cheng was relieved of his post as chancellor (although he continued to hold the Tong Zhongshu Menxia Pingzhangshi designation as an honorary title), and made the military governor of Hedong Circuit (Ê≤≥Êù±, headquartered in modern Taiyuan, Shanxi), as well as the mayor of its capital Taiyuan Municipality. During the reign of Emperor Wenzong In 830, by which time Emperor Jingzong's brother Emperor Wenzong was emperor, Li Cheng was made the military governor of Hezhong Circuit (Ê≤≥‰∏≠, headquartered in modern Yuncheng, Shanxi) as well as mayor of its capital Hezhong Municipality, and he continued to carry the honorary Tong Zhongshu Menxia Pingzhangshi title. In 832, he was given the honorary title of acting Sikong (Âè∏Á©∫, one of the Three Excellencies). Soon thereafter, he was recalled to Chang'an to serve as Zuo Pushe (Â∑¶ÂÉïÂ∞Ñ), one of the heads of the executive bureau (Â∞öÊõ∏ÁúÅ, Shangshu Sheng). Emperor Wenzong had, recently prior to the commission, issued an edict that when the Pushe took office, all of the imperial officials were to formally congratulate him, and the officials of the fourth rank or below (in Tang's system of nine ranks for officials) were all to bow to him, and Wang Ya and Dou Yizhi, who had recently received Pushe commissions, accepted the grand ceremonial bows. Li did not find this appropriate, and requested reconsideration. The executive bureau's secretary general Li Han (ÊùéÊº¢) also found the ceremonies to be too serious, but Emperor Wenzong nevertheless ordered the ceremonial bows be carried out.The New Book of Tang also had an account of this controversy ‚Äî but had the positions of Emperor Wenzong, Li Cheng, and Li Han, to be reverse of what was stated in the Old Book of Tang. As the Old Book of Tang had quoted the language from Emperor Wenzong's edict, it is probably the more reliable account on this issue. Compare Old Book of Tang, vol. 167, with New Book of Tang, vol. 131. Meanwhile, it was said that Li Cheng was talented and learned, but was seen as frivolous, careless, and overly humorous, and therefore did not have a good reputation despite his high position. In 833, Li Cheng was again sent out of the capital to serve as the military governor of Xuanwu Circuit (ÂÆ£Ê≠¶, headquartered in modern Kaifeng, Henan), as well as the prefect of its capital Bian Prefecture (Ê±¥Â∑û); he also continued to carry the honorary title of acting Sikong. In 835, he was again the military governor of Hezhong and the mayor of Hezhong, and was given the honorary title of acting Situ (Âè∏Âæí, also one of the Three Excellencies). In 836, he was recalled to Chang'an to serve as You Pushe (Âè≥ÂÉïÂ∞Ñ), the other head of the executive bureau, as well as acting minister of worship (Â§™Â∏∏Âçø, Taichang Qing). He soon thereafter also assumed the post of acting minister of civil service affairs (ÂêèÈÉ®Â∞öÊõ∏, Libu Shangshu) and was in charge of selecting officials. In 837, he was sent out to serve as the military governor of Shannan East Circuit (Â±±ÂçóÊù±ÈÅì, headquartered in modern Xiangfan, Hubei) and the prefect of its capital Xiang Prefecture (Ë•ÑÂ∑û), carrying the acting Situ title. In 841 he served as defender of Luoyang. While he presumably died in office at the age of 76 before 842 when Niu Sengru was appointed as the new defender of Luoyang, it was not explicitly indicated when he died. He was posthumously honored as Taibao and given a posthumous name Miu (Áº™). Notes and references * Old Book of Tang, vol. 167. * New Book of Tang, vol. 131. * Zizhi Tongjian, vols. 243, 244.

Farquhar was successful in fooling them, winning the opportunity to be at their Vegas show again. This made Shawn Farquhar the first magician to fool them twice.

He rose to be provincial of the Bonhommes, and became provost of the house of this order at Edington, near Westbury, Wiltshire. He held the prebendal stall of Bishopston in Salisbury Cathedral, about 1539, and became one of the residentiary canons. He obtained royal favour and was made chaplain to Henry VIII, who, on the foundation of the bishopric of Bristol, selected Bush as the first bishop of the new see. Bush's replies to certain questions relative to the abuses of the mass, proposed in 1548, were largely those of an orthodox Catholic. He married Edith Ashley, who died three months after the accession of Queen Mary, 8 October 1553; proceedings were anyway taken against him as a married priest. The following year, 20 March 1554, a commission, of which Stephen Gardiner and Edmund Bonner were the chief members, passed sentence of deprivation on him. He made a voluntary resignation in the following June, when the dean and chapter of Canterbury assumed the spiritual jurisdiction of the see, 21 June 1554. He was accused of having impoverished the see by granting the manor of Leigh Court to Edward VI in 1549. On his resignation Bush retired to the rectory of Winterbourne, near Bristol, which he held till his death, which occurred at the age of 68, a few days before Mary's death, 11 October 1558. He was buried near the grave of his wife, on the north side of the choir of Bristol Cathedral, where his mutilated renaissance monument, bearing his effigy as a decaying corpse with a tonsured head, still stands.

Family Rolfe was the second of nine children. His father was Rev. George Crabb Rolfe (1811‚Äì93) who was perpetual curate of Hailey, Oxfordshire from 1838 until his death. His mother Ellen was a sister of the architect William Wilkinson. Rolfe's elder brother George Wilkinson Rolfe (1843‚Äì1912) followed their father into the clergy and a younger brother, William Andrew Rolfe (born 1850), also became an architect. In 1873 Rolfe married Annie de Pr√©. They had one son, Benedict Hugh Rolfe (born 1874) who trained as an architect and assisted his father on some of his later works, before settling in London as a consulting engineer. Rolfe died in 1907. Both he and Annie are buried in the parish churchyard of St Mary's, Wheatley, Oxfordshire. The Buildings of England series of architectural guides spells Rolfe's middle name \\"Crabbe\\" but other authorities use \\"Crabb\\", A memorial plaque in Hailey parish church to his father Rev. G.C. Rolfe also uses the latter spelling. Career St John the Evangelist parish church, Hailey, Oxfordshire, built 1868‚Äì69 Much of Rolfe's work was for parish churches and other institutions of the Church of England. His first major commission was to design a new parish church at Hailey for his father. His design was in a freely reinterpreted French Gothic style. The Oxford Diocesan Architect G.E. Street condemned Rolfe's first draft as \\"needlessly eccentric\\". Despite Street's objections Rolfe completed the church with some unusual details, including an unusually shaped bell-turret. Rolfe's work is notable for its quality and detail. In his reconstruction of part of the nave of Nuneaton Abbey and his restoration of All Saints parish church, Thorpe Malsor, the carving was undertaken by Harry Hems (1842‚Äì1916), a craftsman who originated from Yorkshire but from 1866 worked in Exeter. He carved for Rolfe again on the restorations of St Giles' parish church, Standlake in 1880‚Äì91, St Martin's parish church, Chipping Ongar in 1884, and St Michael's parish church, Inkpen in 1896‚Äì97, and also at Rolfe's new chapel for the Sisterhood of Saint Thomas, Oxford in 1888. apsidal south transept is the organ chamber Rolfe became an Associate of the Royal Institute of British Architects in 1869. In 1881, following the death of G.E. Street, Rolfe was one of the applicants to succeed him as Oxford diocesan architect. John Oldrid Scott was the successful applicant, but Rolfe was later appointed Oxford Diocesan Surveyor. Rolfe was a devout Anglo-Catholic who sought to translate his faith into his building work. In 1871 he wrote in The Builder: > Those professional men nowadays who despise and ridicule that pure symbolic > spirit which actuated our forefathers in their church-work, and probably > substitute for it that ¬£sd money-grubbing spirit of the age, are alike unfit > and unworthy of being engaged on any modern church-work whatever. Rolfe wrote a number of publications on aspects of church architecture and furnishing, but as he got older the style and content of his writing became increasingly obscure.

It lies between Altenau and Torfhaus in the middle of the Harz National Park. The Bruchberg is more like a plateau and has no real summit. This plateau is partly covered with trees, but on the sunny southern slopes the trees have largely died as a result of bark beetle infestation (see photograph below). Following this insect destruction, a new natural forest, rich in its variety of species, is now growing in the heart of the Harz National Park.  Geography  The Wolfswarte, at ,Harzer Wandernadel: Stempelstelle 135 ‚Äì Wolfswarte auf harzer-wandernadel.de is generally considered as the summit, even if it is not the highest elevation on the Bruchberg. It is a domed hilltop (Kuppe) made of weathered Acker-Bruchberg quartzite. The Wolfswarte rises east of the mountain town of Altenau and, in good visibility, the Brocken can be seen from here. The bald summit of the Wolfswarte is easily visible from other peaks in the area, notably the Glockenberg in Altenau, the Schulenberg and also from the Torfhaus. To the southwest the heights of the Bruchberg are continued by the Acker Ridge with its mountain hut, the Hansk√ºhnenburg.  Ascent  From Altenau the Wolfswarte Way (Wolfswarter Weg; its upper section is also known as the Upper Bruchberg Way or Oberer Bruchbergweg) runs past Okerstein in a fairly straight line up to the Wolfswarte. This track is linked by several lateral tracks to the Steile Wand road (Steile-Wand-Stra√üe) from Altenau to Torfhaus. The easiest way to get to the Wolfswarte is to take the last lateral track at a height of about 760 m, shortly before the first carpark on the Steile Wand road and then to branch off after a few hundred metres onto the rather rough track, the Butterstieg, which is not suitable for cyclists. From Torfhaus there is a longer, but more direct route to the Wolfswarte which is about 4 km long. This is also not very suitable for bicycles.  Walking  Since 2007 the Wolfswarte has been a checkpoint on the Harz Walking Route (Harzer Wandernadel). The checkpoint is not on the summit, but about 200 metres down the hill to the southwest on the Wolfswarte Weg.  Gallery  File:BruchbergSued.jpg|Southern side seen from the Gro√üer Sonnenberg.

The King of Palau sent his second son, Prince Lee Boo, to London, during which he landed on Macau and reportedly encountered curious sights from the townspeople.Percy et al.

(2004), p. 446 English businessmen established commercial agriculture enterprises from the 1840s onwards, and often imported Chinese labourers from Southern China to tend to the plantations.Parmentier (1987), p. 46 Chinese labourers were shipped into Palau from 1909 after phosphate deposits were discovered at Angaur some three years earlier. A few Chinese labourers occasionally led strikes against their German employers for the incessant flogging that they experienced and the poor-working conditions which they reportedly received.Hezel (2003), p. 121-2 The number of Chinese labourers arriving in Palau declined sharply in 1914, after the Chinese government banned Chinese men to seek employment overseas. The ban came just as Japan annexed Palau from Germany, and Chinese labourers were quickly replaced by Japanese and Micronesian labourers.Denoon et al. (2004), p. 237-9 A few Chinese labourers continued to arrive in Palau in the 1920s. Many of them were deported during the early days of the Japanese military administration, and only accounted for fifteen individuals in a 1923 censusMartin (1923), p. 1108 They generally received higher wages than the Palauans and immigrant Chamorro labourers, albeit only two-thirds the amount received by their Japanese counterparts.Price (1944), p. 158 Offspring of Chinese men and Palauan women assimilated into the local community, and were generally identified as Palauans during the Japanese colonial era and in the years when Palau was under American administration.Charity Organization Society of the City of New York (1945), p. 291 Recent years A few Taiwanese businessmen began to reside in Palau over a long-term basis after Palau established formal diplomatic ties with Taiwan in 1999. Tourists from Taiwan accounted for 10% of all tourist arrivals in Palau, and many Taiwanese businessmen purchased land in the urban areas.

Chemistry  E-4031 is a synthetized toxin that is a methanesulfonanilide class III antiarrhythmic drug.  Target  E-4031 acts on a specific class of voltage-gated potassium channels mainly found in the heart, the hERG channels. hERG channels (Kv11.1) mediate the IKr current, which repolarizes the myocardial cells. The hERG channel is encoded by ether- a-go-go related gene (hERG).  Mode of action  E-4031 blocks hERG-type potassium channels by binding to the open channels. Its structural target within the hERG-channel is unclear, but some other methanesulfonanilide class III antiarrhythmic drugs are known to bind to the S6 domain or C-terminal of the hERG-channel. Reducing IKr in myocardial cells prolongs the cardiac action potential and thus prolongs the QT-interval. In non-cardiac cells, blocking Ikr has a different effect: it increases the frequency of action potentials.  Toxicity  As E-4031 can prolong the QT-interval, it can cause lethal arrhythmias.  Therapeutic use  E-4031 is solely used for research purposes. So far, one clinical trial has been conducted to test the effect of E-4031 on prolongation of the QT-interval.

See also Explanatory Notes to the Act and the Manual of Service Law , Ministry of Defence, Joint Service Publication (JSP) 830, Vol 1 and 2 Edition 1.0 2009 The system set up under the Act applies to all three armed services: the Royal Navy (including the Royal Marines), the Army and the Royal Air Force (RAF), and replaces the three parallel systems that were previously in existence. The military courts have jurisdiction over all members of the armed forces of the United Kingdom, and civilians subject to service discipline.  Summary hearing by commanding officer  Most offences by members of the armed forces against service law are dealt with by commanding officers through a summary hearing.Military Justice System A commanding officer may deal with an offence by a summary hearing if the offence is minor and the accused is of or below the rank of Commander in the Navy, Lieutenant Colonel in the Army or Royal Marines, or Wing Commander in the RAF.Section 52 Examples of offences which can be dealt with by a commanding officer include being absent without leave, insubordination, malingering, conduct prejudicial to good order, ill- treating subordinates and various offences against civilian law such as theft, assault, criminal damage and careless driving. Offences which cannot be dealt with summarily include assisting the enemy, misconduct on operations (which includes a range of offences committed when the enemy is nearby, such as surrendering a position, sleeping on duty, and spreading alarm or despondency), mutiny and desertion.Section 53 A person charged with an offence which could be dealt with by a summary hearing before a commanding officer has the right to choose trial by the Court Martial instead.Section 129 If a commanding officer dealing with an offence summarily finds the accused guilty, he can impose punishments including loss of seniority (for an officer), or reduction in rank (for a warrant officer or non-commissioned officer). For lower ranks, he can impose a term of detention in a unit guardhouse, or at the Military Corrective Training Centre in Colchester, of up to 28 days, or 90 days in serious cases, or a requirement to carry out extra work or drill, or loss of entitlement to leave. Alternatively he can impose a fine of up to 28 days' pay, or another minor punishment.Sections 132 to 139, and section 173 Often in cases involving ratings (Royal Navy), private soldiers (Army) and airmen (RAF) are delegated by commanding officers to Officers Commanding or, for the Royal Navy, Executive Officers (XOs) ‚Äì usually a Lieutenant Commander (Navy), Major (Army and Royal Marines) or Squadron Leader (RAF). To deal with minor disciplinary matters such as lateness their powers are restricted to either a fine of seven days' pay, a fine of up to ¬£50, or seven days' restriction of privileges.  Summary Appeal Court  Someone found guilty of an offence by a Commanding Officer in a summary hearing can appeal against the punishment, or against both conviction and punishment, to the Summary Appeal Court. The Summary Appeal Court is made up of a Judge Advocate, an officer, and another officer or warrant officer. A case before the Summary Appeal Court is dealt with by re-hearing the charge, and/or reconsidering the decision on punishment. The Judge Advocate presides over the hearing and gives rulings on matters of law including practice and procedure. Decisions to grant or dismiss the appeals are made by a majority of the three members of the Court. Further appeals on a point of law may be made to the High Court of England and Wales by way of case stated.Sections 140 to 142, section 146 and section 149  Service Civilian Court  The Service Civilian Court replaces the three separate systems (for each of the armed services) of Standing Civilian Courts which were previously established in Germany, Belgium, the Netherlands and Cyprus.Explanatory Notes to the Armed Forces Act 2006 The Court has jurisdiction over offences against service law which have been committed outside the British Islands by a civilian who is subject to service discipline, and which, if they had been committed in England and Wales, could be heard in a magistrates' court. Serious offences which, if committed in England and Wales, could only be tried by a Crown Court must be dealt with by the Court Martial.Section 51 The Service Civilian Court consists of a Judge Advocate sitting alone.Section 278 If the Court considers that the nature of the case, or the charge, is sufficiently serious, it can refer the case to be heard by the Court Martial. The defendant can also choose to have their case referred to the Court Martial.Sections 279 to 280 Punishments which can be handed down by the Court include imprisonment for up to 12 months (or 65 weeks for two or more offences), a fine or community service.Schedule 3 Appeals from the Service Civilian Court lie to the Court Martial. An appeal is dealt with by the Court Martial by re-hearing the charge or decision on punishment.Sections 285 to 286  Court Martial  The Armed Forces Act 2006 established the Court Martial as a permanent standing court, effective from 1 November 2009. Previously courts-martial were convened on an ad hoc basis. The distinction, applicable in the Army and RAF, between district courts-martial and general courts-martial (with the district courts-martial having more limited sentencing powers than the general courts-martial) was also abolished. The Court Martial may try any offence against service law, which includes all criminal offences under the law of England and Wales.Section 50, with virtue of Section 42 Procedure is broadly similar to that of the Crown Court in England and Wales. The court is presided over by a judge advocate, and there is a board (similar to a jury) of between three and seven (depending on the seriousness of the offence) officers and warrant officers.Sections 154 to 157 Rulings on matters of law, practice and procedure are made by the judge advocate, whilst findings of guilt or innocence are made by the board by a simple majority of the members. For deliberations on sentence the judge advocate is joined by the board, which is a distinctive and unique feature of the Court Martial.Sections 159 to 160 The punishments which can be imposed by the Court Martial range from imprisonment in a civilian prison (for any period up to life if the offence warrants it), detention at the Military Corrective Training Centre in Colchester for two years or less, dismissal from the armed services (with or without disgrace), or an unlimited fine, down to those punishments available to a Commanding Officer. Someone who has chosen to have a charge heard by the Court Martial rather than summarily by a Commanding Officer cannot be given a punishment greater than the maximum available to the Commanding Officer.Sections 164 to 165 When trying a civilian who is subject to service discipline, the Court Martial consists of a judge advocate and a board comprising civilian members, who do not participate in sentencing‚Äîthe judge advocate sentences alone in the same way as in a Crown Court.Rule 33 of The Armed Forces (Court Martial) Rules 2009 (Statutory Instrument 2009/2041), Office of Public Sector Information Punishments which can be imposed on a civilian by the Court Martial include imprisonment, a fine or community service but not service detention.  Court Martial Appeal Court  The Court Martial Appeal Court, first established in 1951, hears appeals from the Court Martial. It is mostly made up of judges from the civilian Court of Appeal for England and Wales. Further appeal lies to the Supreme Court of the United Kingdom.  Judge advocates  The judges who preside over all hearings of the Service courts are known while they are sitting as \\"judge advocates\\". In the same way as other judges they are appointed by the Lord Chancellor following a process conducted by the Judicial Appointments Commission or, in the case of the Judge Advocate General, appointed by the Queen. They are always legally qualified civilians solicitors, barristers or advocates of at least seven years' standing. A High Court Judge may also sit as a judge advocate if requested to do so by the Judge Advocate General in a particularly serious case.Military Justice system and Section 362  Director of Service Prosecutions  The prosecution of cases which are not dealt with summarily is handled by the Services Prosecuting Authority, the head of which is the Director of Service Prosecutions and whose role is similar to that of the Director of Public Prosecutions in the civilian criminal law of England and Wales. The Director, who is appointed by the Queen, need not be a member of the armed forces, but must have been a solicitor, barrister or advocate with higher rights of audience for at least 10 years.Section 364 The director can appoint officers who are solicitors, barristers or advocates to be prosecutors. The current director is Mr Andrew Cayley QC.

The central-pivoting swing bridge was constructed by G. H. Royce & Co. in 1888 to 1889. It is one of only two of its type constructed in Australia. By 1924 the swing section had ceased to function, but the bridge continued to serve as a road bridge until 1975. Following a 1988 redevelopment, it was converted to pedestrian traffic, with a row of modern shops built along its length. It was added to the Queensland Heritage Register on 21 October 1992.  History  Apart from Victoria Bridge, built in 1888-1889, the only other metal girder swing bridge constructed in Australia was the smaller one over the Forth River at Leith in Tasmania, built in 1884. Tenders were called by the Department of Works, Bridges Branch, on 25 September 1885 for the Townsville structure. A tender submitted by G.H. Royce & Co. of Sydney was accepted at a cost of ¬£18,868. The approaches were constructed by Robertson & Stein and cost ¬£1,780. It was opened to traffic on 2 July 1889 and saw active service until 1975. The innovative design of a swing bridge pivoting on a central drum was an unusual method of allowing river traffic to pass up shallow Ross Creek. The central swing allowed large ships to pass through in the deeper, left hand channel, while smaller craft could take the shallower right lane. During the years after the bridge was opened the commercial centre of Townsville expanded and the warehouse district was gradually confined closer to the mouth of Ross Creek. Ships were no longer required to move up the creek to unload. By 1924 the swing section had ceased to function because of movement of the central drum. However, vehicular traffic continued to cross for another fifty years. The bridge had seriously deteriorated by the 1980s and was threatened with demolition, until 1988 when it was leased by the Townsville City Council to a developer. Conservation work was undertaken as part of the re-development. A new superstructure of shops was built onto and around the existing fabric and the approaches to the bridge and the banks were landscaped. The kiosks installed along the northern bank are now a favourite meeting place for the community.  Description  Victoria Bridge was originally one of only two metal girder, swing bridges in Australia. It was an all steel structure except for wooden decking. A central drum, from which the central span swung open, housed the gas, free piston Otto engine. A row of modern shops has been built along its length, with a restaurant under the eastern end of the structure. An office is located beneath the western end. Although the swing span no longer moves, the bridge is structurally sound. The gas engine was removed and in 1991 was mounted at the city end. The addition of a modern superstructure of shops and the removal of the approaches has substantially altered the visual aspect.  Heritage listing  Victoria Bridge was listed on the Queensland Heritage Register on 21 October 1992 having satisfied the following criteria. The place is important in demonstrating the evolution or pattern of Queensland's history. The design of this central pivoting, swing bridge was an innovative solution to the problem of a bridge over a shallow waterway. Only one other bridge of a similar design was constructed in Australia.

He played for Glasgow Warriors in the Pro14. Early life Van der Merwe was born in Worcester, South Africa. Van der Merwe took up rugby at the age of five progressing through the game and eventually making the Boland U-16 squad. Van der Merwe and his family emigrated from South Africa to Regina, Saskatchewan, Canada in 2003. In Regina, van der Merwe attended Dr. Martin LeBoldus High School and played for the Rogues Rugby Club where he managed to make the Saskatchewan U-18 and U-21 rugby teams as well as the Prairie Fire of the now defunct Rugby Canada Super League.Canadian Team for Autumn Tour 2008 In 2005 van der Merwe moved to Victoria, British Columbia where he joined the James Bay Athletic Association of the British Columbia Premier League. With James Bay, van der Merwe went on to win Provincial Championships in 2006, 2007, and 2008 as well as the National Championship in 2007.CANADIAN NATIONAL RUGBY TEAM: DTH VAN DER MERWE Club career Van der Merwe had signed a short-term contract with Saracens F.C. following a break-out performance for Canada at the 2007 Rugby World Cup. Van der Merwe had appeared for the team in a number of A League matches as well as making appearances in the 2007‚Äì08 EDF Energy Cup. However, van der Merwe suffered a serious ankle injury which sidelined him for 18 months. This injury saw van der Merwe miss the 2008 Churchill Cup and Canada's 2008 European tour as well as ending his time with Saracens. Following the 2009 Churchill Cup van der Merwe joined Glasgow Warriors on a two-year contract. Van der Merwe debuted for the Scottish side as a replacement against the Cardiff Blues in October of that year. During the 2009‚Äì10 Celtic League season van der Merwe made 11 appearances scoring 4 tries in the process for a total of 20 points as well as playing in 4 matches of the 2009‚Äì10 Heineken Cup. The 2010‚Äì11 Celtic League season saw van der Merwe come into his own, starting 19 matches and picking up 9 tries along the way. Van der Merwe finished as Glasgow's highest try scorer for the season as well as finishing tied for third with Jonathan Davies in the Celtic League's leading try-scorer category. Van der Merwe also started 5 matches and score 3 more tries in the 2010‚Äì11 Heineken Cup. In March 2011 van der Merwe re-signed with Glasgow Warriors on a two-year deal. Following the conclusion of the 2011 Rugby World Cup it was discovered that van der Merwe sustained some damage while playing in the tournament and was serious enough to require shoulder surgery. Van der Merwe was expected to miss most if not all of the 2011‚Äì12 Celtic League seasonInjury Blow For Glasgow Warriors As DTH Van Der Merwe Faces Op On Damaged Shoulder, though he returned to the Glasgow line up on the bench for the important RaboDirect Pro12 match against Treviso in Italy towards the end of the regular 2011/12 season. He was brought on as a substitute as the game looked to be slipping away from the Warriors when he picked up a ball in the midfield in the 76th Minute and scored a deciding try. Van der Merwe signed a new two-year contract in 2013 committing himself to Glasgow until at least 2015. On 19 February 2015, it was confirmed that Van der Merwe had signed a contract with the Scarlets, leaving Glasgow Warriors after the 2014/15 season. He currently has 39 tries in 90 appearances for the Scottish club. His final game for the club was their victory in the 2014/15 Pro 12 final, in which Van der Merwe scored a try. Van der Merwe missed the first few games of his debut Scarlets season due to being with Canada at the Rugby World Cup. But once he returned, he made quite an impact, scoring two tries on his debut in a 25-14 victory against Leinster. On 4 January 2017 it was announced van der Merwe was leaving the Scarlets at the end of the 2016-17 season. It was announced on 22 February that Merwe has signed for English club Newcastle Falcons in the Aviva Premiership from the 2017-18 season. However, on 15 March 2018, van der Merwe left Newcastle with immediate effect to re-sign for Glasgow Warriors back in the Pro14. Van der Merwe has been drafted to Ayr in the Scottish Premiership for the 2018-19 season. International career Van der Merwe made his debut for the Canadian national men's team against Barbados in 2006 as part of the third round of the 2007 Rugby World Cup ‚Äì Americas qualification. Van der Merwe came on as a replacement scoring two tries. Van der Merwe also came off the bench in a losing effort versus Italy later that year. The year 2007 proved to be a watershed year for the 21-year-old van der Merwe as his third cap was earned in successful fashion with a 42‚Äì12 win against Portugal, contributing two tries for the Canadians. This promising play earned van der Merwe a spot on the 2007 Canadian Rugby World Cup squad. He started all four matches and scored a try in the 12‚Äì12 draw with Japan. Canada finished last in their pool, missing out on advancement to the next round and failing to achieve automatic qualification for the 2011 Rugby World Cup. The ankle injury van der Merwe sustained in late 2007 forced him out of selection for the national team for the entirety of 2008. However, van der Merwe made his return earning his eighth cap for Canada in a loss versus Ireland on 23 May 2009. The following week the Canadians hosted Wales with van der Merwe being switched from his familiar back-three role to starting at outside centre. The Canadians put in a worthy effort but eventually dropped the match 32‚Äì23. The 2009 Churchill Cup saw van der Merwe maintain his role in the centres as well as his ability to score. Van der Merwe touched down in the win versus Georgia and also notched two more tries plus a conversion in Canada's final match of the tournament against the Argentina Jaguars, a match Canada lost 44‚Äì29. A busy year climaxed with a home and away series with traditional rivals the United States. The two legged playoff between the USA and Canada acted as the North American Qualification Playoff for the 2011 Rugby World Cup. The winner by aggregate points would qualify for the 2011 Rugby World Cup as Americas 1. In the first match, taking place in Charleston, South Carolina on 4 July, van der Merwe again started at outside centre. In a hot and error filled afternoon for both sides, the United States edged the Canadians winning the match by six points, 12‚Äì6. One week later these sides met again in Edmonton, Alberta. The first half saw USA outside centre Paul Emerick receive a red card for kicking van der Merwe who had been grounded after making a tackle. Van der Merwe continued on in the game notching one of six tries scored by the Canadians. Canada won the match 41‚Äì18 as well as being awarded qualification to the 2011 Rugby World Cup by winning the series on aggregate, 47‚Äì30.CANADA QUALIFIES FOR RWC 2011 The following summer, van der Merwe was again in the Canadian selection for the 2010 Churchill Cup. Canada began pool play with a win against Uruguay with van der Merwe picking up two tries in the second half of the match. Canada reached the Churchill Cup final for the first time after a hard fought and historical 33‚Äì27 win against France A. Van der Merwe once again started at outside centre for the Canadians, however, their efforts were not enough as they lost the final to England Saxons 38‚Äì18.

It blocks two different types of potassium channels, inward rectifier potassium channels (Kir) and calcium activated large conductance potassium channels (BK). Tertiapin peptide Sources Tertiapin is a peptidic component of the venom of the European honey bee (Apis mellifera). Chemistry Tertiapin peptide is composed of 21 amino acids with the sequence: Ala-Leu-Cys-Asn-Cys-Asn-Arg-Ile-Ile-Ile-Pro-His-Met-Cys-Trp-Lys- Lys-Cys-Gly-Lys-Lys. The methionine residue is sensitive to oxidation, reducing the ability to block the ionic channels. Methionine can be substituted by glutamine in order to prevent the oxidation. The new synthesized peptide is named Tertiapin-Q and does not show any functional change as compared to the original peptide, which makes it a more suitable research tool. Target and mode of action Tertiapin has been described as a potent potassium channel blocker, acting on two different types of K+ channels.  Inward rectifier potassium channels Tertiapin binds specifically to different subunits of the inward rectifier potassium channel (Kir), namely GIRK1 (Kir 3.1), GIRK4 (Kir 3.4) and ROMK1 (Kir 1.1), inducing a dose-dependent block of the potassium current. It is thought that tertiapin binds to the Kir channel with its Œ±-helix situated at the C-terminal of the peptide. This Œ±-helix is plugged into the external end of the conduction pore, thereby blocking the channel. The N-terminal of the peptide sticks out of the extracellular side. Tertiapin has a high affinity for Kir channels with approximately Kd = 8 nM for GIRK1/4 channels and Kd = 2 nM for ROMK1 channels. In contrast to the voltage-gated K+ channels, Kir channels are more permeable to K+ during hyperpolarization than during depolarization. A voltage-dependent blockade by intracellular cations at voltages more positive than the K+ reversal potential is the mechanism underlying this feature. At more negative voltages the Kir channels are responsible for an inward K+ current. Therefore Kir channels contribute to the maintenance of the resting potential, the duration of the action potential and the neuronal excitability. GIRK1 and -4 are subunits of the muscarinic potassium channels (KACh) and have an important role in the slowing down of the heart rate in response to parasympathetic stimulation via acetylcholine. KAch channels activate during hyperpolarization, prolonging the cardiac action potential by inflow of potassium ions and reducing the frequency of action potential generation. An inhibition by tertiapin will result in a shorter cardiac action potential with loss of parasympathetic control, resulting in a faster heart rate ROMK is found in the kidneys where it contributes to K+ recycling. An inhibition will result in loss of potassium, as observed in Bartter syndrome, which can be caused by mutations in the ROMK channels. BK channels The second type of potassium channel that tertiapin blocks is the calcium activated large conductance potassium channel (BK). The block of BK cells is voltage-, concentration- and use-dependent, meaning the blockage changes with different stimulation voltages and frequencies, different concentrations and with the duration of application of tertiapin. The IC50 for BK channels is 5.8 nM. The BK channels have a role in the onset of the afterhyperpolarization, thereby shortening the action potential and enhancing the speed of repolarization. Total blockage by tertiapin prolongs the duration of the action potential and inhibits the afterhyperpolarization amplitude, leading to an increase of the neuronal excitability. Tertiapin inhibits the BK channels only after a minimal stimulation of 15 minutes, in contrast with less than a minute for the GIRK channels. For this reason it is thought that the mode of action of tertiapin is different for each channel type. Toxicity Tertiapin is a compound of the honey bee venom (apitoxin) that causes pain and signs of inflammation around the sting, but a great number of stings can be lethal (LD50 is 18-22 stings per kg for humans). An anaphylactic shock can develop if a person has an allergy to the venom. In that case even one sting can be lethal. Therapeutic use As a paradox to the symptoms after a bee sting, bee venom is used for treatment of pain, inflammation (e.g. rheumatoid arthritis) and multiple sclerosis. Tertiapin may contribute to this effect by prolonging the depolarization phase by blocking the BK channels. Eventually this will lead to inactivation of the voltage- gated Na+ channels of the dorsal root ganglion neurons, reducing sensory transmission to the central nervous system. Excessive stimulation with acetylcholine can induce an AV-block in the heart as shown in guinea pigs, which can be prevented by blockage of the KAch channels by tertiapin. This suggests a possible therapeutic role in excessive parasympathetic innervation or inferior myocardial infarction.

She did her first degree (B.A.) at the University of Cape Town where she concentrated on two areas of research: the study of world religions and Hebrew literature. The thesis of her second degree (M.A) was: ‚ÄúThe Literary Creations of Hannah Szenes‚Äù. The theme of Dr. Talit Reisenberger's doctorate ‚Äì ‚ÄúThe Concept of Motherhood in the Bible‚Äù ‚Äì has proved that fixed prejudices and the expectations in daily life in ancient times influenced the definition of ‚ÄúThe Motherhood Concept‚Äù as it appears in the text of the Bible. As if in a cyclical knock on effect ‚Äì the descriptions in the Bible have influenced the building of prejudice about the way motherhood is perceived as well as affecting what was expected of women, for thousands of years, in the world outside the Bible. Her mother tongue is Hebrew, but Dr. Azila Talit Reisenberger lives in a country where the most common language of academia and literature is English. As a result, Dr. Talit Reisenberger is building a bridge between these languages through her writing, lectures, translation of Hebrew literature written in South Africa to local languages, encouraging writing in Xhosa and Zulu.

Her work is published in many distinguished journals for example Women in Judaism. She edits books, and both organises and lectures at universities and conferences throughout the world. In 2005 Dr. Talit Reisenberger was elected to serve as president of the International Minority Literature and Cultures Association (IMLACA), which promotes Minority Literature around the world, particularly as an antidote to cultural reductionism which could bring about the destruction and extinction of less dominant languages and cultures. Dr. Talit Reisenberger's main goal and recurring focus, despite scarce resources and difficult conditions in a world which is becoming a small global village, mainly using the English language, is to guard the ‚ÄúMinority Voice‚Äù, as she determinedly acts as an advocate in the protection of the ‚Äòmarginal voice‚Äô. She is known in South Africa as a leader in the movement to protect and develop Women's Rights and Gender Equality and she is a founding member in the lobby group Women Demand Dignity (WDD).History of Women Demand Dignity Dr. Talit Reisenberger has been praised for her work as one of the leaders of the different religions in Cape Town who established a multi faith religious group which encourages understanding between the various genders, religions and races.

It ran along the entire ridge to the Hirschhornklippen. * The Old Goethe Way (alte Goetheweg) began at Goetheweg station and crossed the K√∂nigsberg between Hirschhornklippen and Gipfelklippe. It then ran downhill alongside the Goethe Moor to the railway line at Neuen Goetheweg.  Crags  There are several prominent granite crags on the ridge.

The castle had a motte-and-bailey design and was located on the south side of the old Anglo-Saxon city, cutting into the grounds of Worcester Cathedral. Royal castles were owned by the king and maintained on his behalf by an appointed constable. At Worcester that role was passed down through the local Beauchamp family on a hereditary basis, giving them permanent control of the castle and considerable power within the city. The castle played an important part in the wars of the 12th and early 13th century, including the Anarchy and the First Barons' War. In 1217, Henry III's government decided to break the power of the Beauchamps and reduce the ongoing military threat posed by the castle by returning much of the castle's bailey to the cathedral. Without an intact bailey the castle was no longer valuable militarily, although it played a small part in the Second Barons' War in the 1260s. A gaol had been built in the castle by the early 13th century and the castle continued to be used as Worcestershire's county gaol until the 19th century, when a new prison was built on the north side of Worcester and the old site completely redeveloped. Today nothing remains of Worcester Castle with the exception of Edgar's Tower, a cathedral gatehouse built on the former entrance to the castle. History 11th century Worcester Castle was built after the Norman conquest of England in the Anglo-Saxon city of Worcester. The castle was constructed between 1068 and 1069 on the orders of William the Conqueror as part of a wave of royal castle building in major Roman or Anglo-Saxon towns across England.Pounds, The Medieval Castle in England and Wales, p. 7 Constructed in timber, the castle had a motte-and-bailey design, with a bailey to the north and south of the motte.Baker and Holt, Urban Growth and the Medieval Church, p. 158 The top of the motte was later recorded as being around 18 feet (5.5 m) in diameter. The castle was defensively well situated on the eastern bank of the River Severn in the south-west corner of the borough, taking advantage of the old burh walls and ditches.The city of Worcester: The castle and public buildings, A History of the County of Worcester: volume 4 (1924), pp. 390‚Äì394, accessed 9 October 2011. Urse d'Abetot was appointed as the sheriff of Worcester and the constable of the new castle.Mackenzie, The Castles of England, p. 386 Worcester was an urban castle, built within an existing settlement.Creighton, Castles and Landscapes, p.134 Many such castles required the clearance of local properties, but unusually at Worcester Castle the ditch of the outer bailey cut through part of Worcester Cathedral's cemetery. It is unclear whether the cemetery was still in use at that time, but the desecration resulted in Ealdred, the Archbishop of York, with extensive interests in Worcester, complaining about the seizure of the land and formally cursing Urse.Mackenzie, The Castles of England, p. 386; Creighton, Castles and Landscapes, p. 123 12th‚Äì13th centuries Plan of the castle before 1217. A ‚Äì Water gate; B ‚Äì motte; C ‚Äì ditch; D ‚Äì bailey; E ‚Äì Frog Mill; F ‚Äì gatehouse; G ‚Äì city wall Worcester remained a royal castle, but within a few years the post of sheriff and that of constable became hereditary in the Beauchamp family, the successors to Urse d'Abetot. Urse's son, Roger, inherited them, followed by Walter de Beauchamp, who married Urse's daughter, and William de Beauchamp.Pounds, The Medieval Castle in England and Wales, pp. 27, 96; Mackenzie, The Castles of England, p. 386 The castle was effectively run by the Beauchamps, largely independent of the king.Pounds, The Medieval Castle in England and Wales, p. 96 Despite controlling Worcester, the Beauchamps preferred to use Elmley Castle, 12 miles (20 k) away, as their main residence.Pounds, The Medieval Castle in England and Wales, p. 210 In 1113 Worcester was attacked by Welsh raiders, who broke into the outer bailey of the castle and set fire to the buildings there; the timber castle was destroyed and had to be rebuilt, again in wood.Mackenzie, The Castles of England, p. 387; Armitage, The Early Norman Castles, p. 241 In the late 1130s a period of civil war ‚Äì the Anarchy ‚Äì broke out in England, in which the rival factions of King Stephen and the Empress Matilda contested the kingdom; Worcestershire proved to be a key battleground in the war. The first attack on Worcester itself occurred in late 1139, when an Angevin army from Gloucestershire assaulted the city; after an attempt to take the castle on the south side of the city, the Gloucester forces entered from the north, looting and burning the city.Bradbury, Stephen and Matilda, p. 85 As a result, Walter de Beauchamp chose to side with Matilda.Mackenzie, The Castles of England, p. 387 Worcester became a base for Stephen's forces for a period, with Stephen replacing Walter as the constable with Waleron de Beaumont, before the city and castle were reclaimed for the Empress by Robert of Gloucester.Mackenzie, The Castles of England, p. 387; Bradbury, p. 156 In response, Stephen first stormed and burnt the city in 1148, and then attacked it again in 1150, shortly before the end of the conflict.Bradbury, pp. 156, 182 Two neighbouring siege castles were built by Stephen as part of these operations, designed to contain Worcester Castle itself, one at Henwick Hill the other at Red Hill. After the conflict, Walter was finally reaffirmed as the constable of Worcester Castle by Henry II, the Empress's son. By the end of the 13th century, William de Beauchamp ‚Äì the grandson of Walter de Beauchamp ‚Äì controlled the castle on behalf of the king. In the 12th century there was a trend in England for stone castles to replace their earth and timber counterparts, and in 1204 King John ordered the sheriff of Worcester to rebuild the gatehouse \\"which is now of timber, with good and fine stone\\".Allen Brown Allen Brown's English Castles p. 55 John's work cost ¬£25, and was one of a number of repairs and improvements during the period: ¬£12 was spent maintaining the castle in 1183, for example, while in 1192 ¬£5 4s was spent on the internal buildings and in 1203 work on the stables came to ¬£6 3s. John Speed's depiction of the castle motte (l) and bailey (r) in 1610 Civil war broke out again in England in 1215 between forces loyal to King John and rebel barons, supported in due course by Prince Louis of France. John annexed the castle in 1214 and William sided with the rebels in 1216. King John responded by sending forces to attack the castle and successfully retook it. Despite John's death, the war continued until forces loyal to John's young son, Henry III, finally achieved victory over the rebels in 1217. Meanwhile, the 11th century dispute over the cathedral graveyard had continued unabated and in 1217 Henry III's government decided to announce that the disputed land would be granted to the cathedral. A panel met to agree exactly how the land should be divided, concluding that the division should run straight across the bailey; the far side was returned to the cathedral, making the remainder of the castle unusable from a military perspective. Henry thus ingratiated himself with the church and broke the power of the Beauchamps in the city by crippling their local fortress. The castle nevertheless continued in use for a time, partially because the Worcestershire County gaol was situated in the outer bailey; the earliest record of this gaol is from 1221, when a porter was recorded as being employed as a gaoler.Pugh, Imprisonment in Medieval England, pp. 85, 146 The gaol appears to have been built of wood during the medieval period.Pugh, Imprisonment in Medieval England, pp. 350‚Äì351 Escapees remained a problem; some were recorded during the 1220s, and during Second Barons' War, Worcester was captured and all the prisoners released.Pugh, Imprisonment in Medieval England, pp. 219, 224 Later in the same war, Henry III was imprisoned there for a period by Simon de Montfort. The castle was also used as one of the locations for the Worcestershire county court and election of local officials. 14th‚Äì19th centuries sconce built on top of the motte The sheriffs of Worcestershire continued to control the castle as constables, and the property passed along hereditary lines from the Beauchamps to the Earls of Warwick until Richard Neville, also known as the \\"Kingmaker\\", died during the Wars of the Roses in 1471. The victorious Edward IV divided up the various estates that Neville had owned and gave the castle to his son, severing the link between Worcester and the earldom of Warwick. The final constables were appointed during the 1540s, after which the practice of appointing constables ceased altogether. The castle's walls were quarried for stone, the motte was used to keep animals on and only the sheriff's county gaol remained intact.Pounds, The Medieval Castle in England and Wales, p.96 The antiquarian John Leland recorded in the 1540s that the castle was \\"now clean down\\", and that the motte was still of an impressive size but heavily overgrown. A gatehouse known as Edgar's Tower was built by the cathedral on the site of the earlier castle gatehouse, to control access to the former bailey.Armitage, The Early Norman Castles, p.241 In 1628 the castle site was granted by the Crown to Giles Clutterbuck; the local gentry complained, leading to a legal case in which the county successfully reclaimed the site. In 1642 England descended into a period of civil war between the Royalist supporters of Charles I and the supporters of Parliament. Worcester's city walls were refortified and a sconce, or small fort, was built on top of the motte of Worcester Castle. The castle continued to be used as the county gaol after the war and in 1653 a new gaol, built from stone and brick, was constructed in the castle grounds. In the 1770s the prison reformer John Howard inspected the gaol and was very critical of the facility. In particular he complained about the castle's underground dungeon, accessed down a flight of 26 steps; the room was circular, 18 feet (5.5 m) across, and guarded by an iron grill.Committee of the Society for the Improvement of Prison Discipline, Remarks on the form and construction of prisons p.1 Worcester conducted extensive work after the report at a cost of ¬£3,431 (¬£364,000 at 2009 prices), and by 1788 the prison had 18 new cells for men and two for women, in addition to the dungeon and the sick-rooms. Nevertheless, it was housing 74 inmates at the time of Howard's inspection, with two prisoners routinely sharing each cell, sleeping together on the floor.Howard, An Account of the Principal Lazarettos in Europe, p. 172; The city of Worcester: The castle and public buildings, A History of the County of Worcester: volume 4 (1924), pp. 390‚Äì394, accessed 9 October 2011; Purchasing Power of British Pounds from 1264 to Present, MeasuringWorth, Lawrence H. Officer and Samuel H. Williamson, accessed 12 October 2011 Like other prisons of the time, Worcester Castle was run as a private enterprise, in this case by a local butcher, who was paid ¬£150 a year (¬£15,400) to run the facility.Howard, An Account of the Principal Lazarettos in Europe, p. 172; Purchasing Power of British Pounds from 1264 to Present, MeasuringWorth, Lawrence H. Officer and Samuel H. Williamson, accessed 12 October 2011. The prison was known to suffer from outbreaks of gaol fever, which claimed the life of a local doctor who visited the facility. A new county gaol was built in 1814, at a cost of ¬£20,000 (¬£1.1m) with a more modern system of radiating wings; this was constructed on the north side of Worcester where the local street was named \\"Castle Street\\" as a result.Committee of the Society for the Improvement of Prison Discipline, Remarks on the form and construction of prisons p. 22; The city of Worcester: The castle and public buildings, A History of the County of Worcester: volume 4 (1924), pp. 390‚Äì394, accessed 9 October 2011; Purchasing Power of British Pounds from 1264 to Present, MeasuringWorth, Lawrence H. Officer and Samuel H. Williamson, accessed 12 October 2011 The Dean and Chapter of Worcester Cathedral acquired the old gaol in 1823. The outer bailey of the castle became known as the College Green; the College Green was accessed through Edgar's Tower. The motte was slowly demolished between 1823 and 1846.

It is located in western Quebec in the Abitibi-T√©miscamingue region some 50 km north-east of Rouyn-Noranda, 50 km west of Amos, Quebec, 100 km north west of Val-d'Or, Quebec, and about 50 km due west of Lake Hebecourt. The park has a surface area of 268,3 km2. Its mission is to protect a representative sample of the clay belt of the Abitibi-T√©miscamingue region and the Abij√©vis hills. The park includes a watershed line and thus extends over two watersheds: the basin of the Hudson Bay and that of the Atlantic. There are traces of ancient volcanic activity and several lakes on the faults. It is managed by the Quebec government by the Soci√©t√© des √©tablissements de plein air du Qu√©bec (Society of outdoor facilities in Quebec) (S√âPAQ). Geography The park contains among other features the Abij√©vis hills, including Mount Dominant which is the highest summit of Abitibi (570m). The hills cover about two-thirds of the park. There is a fault that runs through much of the territory from Lake Lois to Lake La Haie. The park is located on old geological formations of more than 2.7 billion years making it very much pre-Cambrian. It is composed mainly of pillow basalt formations that were formed at the bottom of the ocean. These formations are part of the larger group of Kinoj√©vis in Superior Craton. Hydrography The park is situated on the borderline between the watersheds of Hudson Bay and the Atlantic Ocean. This line from the northwest corner to the middle of the eastern border. Nearly three quarters of the water is drained into the Saint Lawrence river. There are more than 80 lakes. The principal lakes are Aiguebelle and Lake Lois to the north, and Lake Sault and Lake La Haie located in the area of faults. There is also Lake Matissard lake on the southern edge of the park. The Kinoj√©vis river passes near this latter lake. History It was in 1945 that the Government of Quebec found, following the settlement of the Abitibi-T√©miscamingue region, a lack of space for wildlife in the region. It thus chose the canton of Aiguebelle to create a reserve for hunting and fishing because of the poor quality of the land in that area. In 1976, it opened up camping and hiking trails in the area. In 1980 the status of the reserve was changed to a wildlife reserve. In 1985, this reserve was divided into two to create the Conservation Park of Aiguebelle with an area of 241.7 km2. Following public consultation in 1998, the wildlife reserve was abolished, and the park was expanded to its current area.History, National Park of Aiguebelle , S√©paq, consulted on 16 February 2008 It was only in 2001 that the status of the park was changed to a national park, following an amendment to the Parks Act.Parks Act, Minister of Sustainable Development, the Environment, and Parks, consulted on 16 February 2008 The name of the park is the name of the canton, which commemorates Charles N√©vair Aiguebelle, the captain of grenadiers of the Regiment of Languedoc, who distinguished himself by his bravery during the Battle of Sainte-Foy on 28 April 1760. The name of the canton is a continuation of the theme of the French military of the Seven Years' War in America which prevails in Abitibi.Canton of Aiguebelle , Topos on the web, Commission of Toponymy, consulted on 16 February 2008 Natural heritage Flora The park is located in the Boreal forest of Canada which is also known as taiga. There are several common tree species such as White birch, Black Spruce, balsam poplar, American aspen, Jack Pine, American Larch, and balsam fir. Also found in the park are lowland species of the Saint Lawrence and the Great Lakes, such as yellow birch, black ash, and Eastern white pine. Wildlife The Aiguebelle National Park features 55 species of mammals from Abitibi-T√©miscamingue, including the Moose (Alces alces), the North American beaver (Castor canadensis), the Gray wolf (Canis lupus), the Canada lynx (Lynx canadensis), the Muskrat (Ondatra zibethicus), the North American river otter (Lontra canadensis), the American mink (Mustela vison), the Least weasel (Mustela nivalis), the American black bear (Ursus americanus), the North American porcupine (Erethizon dorsatum), and the American marten (Martes americana). The birdlife of the park has 150 species of birds including twenty species of New World warblers. The lakes on the plains are dominated by Walleye and Northern pike.

Already in the 1920s, the richness of Anticosti's flora was highlighted by botanist Marie-Victorin, who described the canyon of the Vaur√©al River as a \\"remarkable sanctuary\\" for ferns. But for the following decades, the entire island was privately owned by a succession of logging companies who invested little or nothing in environmental protection. In 1974, Anticosti Island was bought by the Government of Quebec and became public land once again. In 1987, the Regional County Municipality of Minganie officially incorporated the idea of creating a park in the Vaur√©al River area in its development plan. Thereafter, it took 14 years to complete the research, studies, planning, and public hearings. The Quebec government created the Anticosti National Park on April 26, 2001. Park features Natural attractions: * Vaur√©al Canyon and Waterfall - At the Vaur√©al Waterfall, the Vaur√©al River drops and then flows through a deep gorge. * Tour Bay (Bay de la Tour) - This bay on the north side of the island is noteworthy for its breathtaking seascape with huge cliffs surrounding the bay and excellent bird watching opportunities. * Potato Cave (Grotte √† la Patate) - This cave is one of the longest caves in Quebec.

History  1991 forest fire in the Thomas-Fortin sector Before the park was created on November 25, 1981, the site was used for logging. From 1939 to 1981, this activity had affected 39% of the area of the current national park. The park also has its own cultural heritage. Its history as an English resort, hunting and fishing with the Murray River fishing Club, also called Club La Roche, a former private fishing club adds to the history of logging and dredging that took place in the park before its creation. Grands-Jardins National Park protects an environment that is highly representative of the natural region of the . The natural environment of the park is dominated by forests. Approximately 30% of the park was ravaged by forest fires in 1991 and again in 1999. Although the landscape of these fires is not very attractive for the human eye, it is essential for the renewal of the forest and for the creation of refuges for certain species. Indeed, dead wood trunks on the ground or standing are ideal shelters for birds, rodents, insects and fungi. A few years after the fire, the forest begins to regain its appearance and slowly resumes its cycle of natural succession. On September 13, 2017, the Grands-Jardins National Park was enlarged by to reach an area of .  Geography   Topography  The topography of the park is varied due to the mountain ranges that characterize the park. The climatic conditions of the park can easily vary from place to place. The territory is part of the Canadian Shield and its rock base is mainly composed of granite rocks such as igneous rock. In addition, part of the territory is composed of anorthosite, a type of igneous rock.  * Mont de l'Ours * Mont Jean-Palardy * Mont Ren√©- Richard * La Chouenne  Hydrography  Lac des Cygnes The park includes more than 120 bodies of water as well as several mountains that are part of the mountain range of Laurentian Mountains. The summits of these mountains are protected because of the fragility of the ecosystems present at the summits which are sensitive to the trampling of hikers. These summits are still accessible to hikers by marked and landscaped trails. The water bodies make up 3.6% of the park area and the two most important watersheds are the Malbaie River and the Sainte-Anne-du-Nord River.  Fauna  The park offers habitat for several animals. Three distinct habitat types can be observed in the park: young forests which were created by natural fires and logging, mature forests composed of black spruce and balsam fir with closed cover and taiga reminiscent of the Great Northern Quebec. Taiga environments similar to that of Grands-Jardins National Park are normally found more than further north, above the 52nd parallel. These different habitats make it possible to shelter a variety of animals, some of which have threatened or vulnerable status. There are populations of moose, woodland caribou, black bear, red fox, porcupine, common loon, spruce grouse, wolves, lynx and several other species. Due to the diversity of habitats found within the national park, several species frequent it, including three species that are classified as vulnerable, namely the woodland caribou of the forest ecotype, the Bicknell's thrush and Barrow's goldeneye. These species have the most serious status under the Quebec Act on threatened or vulnerable species. There are also seven species likely to be designated threatened or vulnerable, namely Arctic char, golden eagle, peregrine falcon, common nighthawk, chimney swift, rock vole, cougar and southern bog lemming.  Mammals  The mammal category includes as many large mammals as small rodents, moving from moose to bear and porcupine. We thus find the following mammals: several species of shrews (the great shrew, the common shrew, sooty, palustrine and pygmy), the star-nose mole, the snowshoe hare, the red squirrel, the large flying squirrel, the common marmot, Canada beaver, several species of voles (red-backed gapper, fields, rocks, Cooper's lemming), Phenacomys, muskrat, some species of mouse (deer, wood jumping and field jumping), American porcupine, coyote, gray wolf, red fox, black bear, raccoon, long-tailed weasel, stoat, river otter, woodland caribou, white-tailed deer, moose, American marten, American mink, striped skunk, cougar and Canadian lynx. This is explained by the varied habitats offered by the vast territory of the Grands-Jardins National Park. Snowshoe hare The snowshoe hare is one of the most important species in the park (and even in Canada) from an ecological point of view, because it represents a food source for a good number of predators which frequent the national park and the boreal forest in general such as the Canada lynx, the red fox and the coyote. In addition, it feeds on several plants and shrubs in the boreal forest. The woodland caribou (Rangifer tarandus caribou) is a mammal very sensitive to the presence of humans. Too large a presence on its territory can disturb the species and modify its behavior and lead it to frequent places less favorable for the species, making the caribou more vulnerable to its predators such as the wolf and the black bear. The territory of the Grands-Jardins Park is an important environment for the calving, rutting and winter feeding of the woodland caribou and plays a decisive role in the conservation of the species. It lives in particular in mature coniferous forests where arboreal lichens are very present. The black bear, an omnivorous animal whose diet consists mainly of plants, is abundant in the national park.http://www.parcparcours.com/grands-jardins/fiches/ours.html However, it also feeds on fawns that are easy prey for bears when they venture out of the dense forest. The bear prefers open and semi-open sites where the vegetation constituting a good part of its diet is more abundant and rarely ventures into the dense forest of the park. The Canadian lynx (Lynx canadensis) is a wild feline from the boreal forest that lives in varied habitats dominated by mature stand forests. It is one of the three wild felines that live in Canada with the bobcat to which it resembles much and the cougar. This carnivore feeds mainly on snowshoe hares that are found in the park. Thus the Grands- Jardins National Park is a suitable habitat for this species. On the other hand, it is a shy and secretive feline since it is rarely observed. The Cooper's lemming vole (Synaptomys cooperi) is a small rodent that frequents wetlands.Desrosiers, N., R. Morin and J. Jutras. 2002. Atlas of micromammals of Quebec. Quebec Wildlife and Parks Society. Wildlife Development Directorate. Quebec. 92 p. It lives in burrows in peat bogs and grassy marshes. It is a rare species in Canada that has been very little studied to date.  Birds  The park is also home to a significant number of migratory and non-migratory bird species. The common loon, golden eagle, black-backed woodpecker, Barrow's goldeneye, peregrine falcon, Bicknell's thrush and spruce grouse are among the birds found here. The common loon, a skilled diver, lives in fish-rich lakes since it is a great predator of aquatic environments. Its presence indicates good health of the lakes it frequents. The golden eagle, meanwhile, lives in rock walls and open or semi-open environments. The peregrine falcon also lives in the rock faces and open spaces of the national park. The black-backed woodpecker plays an important role in burnt forests since it creates cavities in dead trees in order to feed on the insects that adore this environment. The cavities thus created are then used for several species. The Bicknell's thrush which is a forest bird prefers rather dense and regenerating forests as habitat. The Barrow's goldeneye (Bucephala islandica), an arboreal nesting bird, lives in large snags for nesting and fishless lakes as a source of food for ducklings. Finally, the Canadian grouse, resembling a small hen, inhabits coniferous forests year-round. It is a species easily observable by visitors, accumulating 10% of reported wildlife sightings.

Among the amphibians, we find the northern two-lined salamander, American toad, spring peeper (cruciferous tree frog, wood frog, green frog, the northern frog and finally the common garter snake.. Arctic char and brook trout are two species of fish that frequent the national park.  Flora  Kalmia latifolia 'Clementine Churchill' Lichens cladoni The park is made up of different habitats due to its diverse topography, going from high mountains to large lakes. This is why we find there forest habitats which dominate the landscape, open habitats, taiga habitats composed mainly of lichens as well as varied aquatic habitats. The park helps protect a site of exceptional character that are cladonia spruces, a sample of taiga which is unique for southern Quebec. This type of habitat is normally found further north in Quebec. These different types of habitats are home to a wide variety of plants from four different categories: heather, lichen, bog and trees. About fifteen species of the heather family are observable in the park.http://www.parcparcours.com/grands-jardins/fiches/ericacees.html Their flowering extends from the beginning of June until the end of the summer. One of the most easily observable flowers is probably the narrow-leaved Kalmia (Kalmia augustifolia) which has pink saucer-shaped flowers. The park is also home to Labrador tea (Rhododendron groenlandicum), a few varieties of [cranberry] (Vaccinium sp.) That produce blueberries and cranberries, the pirole with one flower (Moneses uniflora), wintergreen Hispid (Gaultheria hispidula), (Andromeda polifolia var. Glaucophylla) and caliculated cassandra (Chamaedaphne calyculata). A second family of plants is very abundant in the park, that of the lichen which is represented in the Parc des Grands-Jardins by 200 different species. Different species colonize different parts of the park. Some lichens are more adapted to the soil while others colonize trees or rock walls. There are different species of crustacean and foliaceous lichens that grow mainly on rocks in the Bear Mountains and Swan Lake. Lichens of the Bryoria and Usnea type are found on mature trees in the boreal forest. Finally, fruticulous lichens of the genus Cladoni grow directly on the ground. Lichens are an important component of the ecosystem since they are the main source of food for certain species, especially for woodland caribou in winter. Two remarkable peat bogs are present on the territory of the national park. These are rare habitats for southern Quebec. The first peatland is the permafrost of Mont de l'ours and the second is the reticulated peatland of Lac Malbaie. The trees in the park are mainly black spruce and balsam fir which are similar to the Canadian boreal forest. There are also larches and jack pines. The boreal forest, which is found in the national park, is dominated by conifers which are particularly well adapted to the harsh boreal climate. There are still some species of deciduous trees that are as well suited to the boreal climate as the aspen.P. Blancher, S. Bradbury, T. Cobb, C. Fisher, K.C. Hannah, B. Johns, J. Lane, D.

The goal of the project is to accelerate the vegetal restoration of the borrow pits of the park created by the extraction of sand and gravel which have been abandoned for 40 years. The park is also the subject of a project to modify the park boundaryMinistry of Forests, Wildlife and Parks, National Parks Directorate. Undated. Information document, Project to modify the boundary of Grands- Jardins National Park. [pdf] 28 p. in order to enlarge it and incorporate an interesting area for the conservation of five new peaks, six lakes and the habitat of the woodland caribou. The park team has also been carrying out a monitoring of the loon's nesting since 2007 and invites visitors to share their observations of the bird via observation sheets. One of the main goals of the national park is the conservation of the natural environments of the Charlevoix region and the species that inhabit it. The protection of aquatic environments and peaks are major issues for Grands-Jardins National Park. Rigorous monitoring of fishing quotas, identification of spawning grounds and characterization of numerous water bodies allow the park to minimize the pressure on the aquatic ecosystem and promote a favorable environment for the populations of Arctic char and d brook trout that depend on it. Marked trails and awareness of hikers reduce the anthropogenic impact on the fragile ecosystems of mountain peaks. References :This article was initially translated from the French Wikipedia.

It is located near the municipality of Notre-Dame-des-Bois in the Estrie region. The park was created in 1994 and is adjacent to the Samuel- Brisson Ecological Reserve which is located northeast of it. Mont M√©gantic is the approximate geographic centre of the park. Located at its peak is the Mont M√©gantic Observatory, which is the most important astronomical observatory in eastern Canada. Part of the park is also recognized as important area for bird conservation.Mont M√©gantic Sherbrooke, Qu√©bec The park is managed by the Quebec government through the Soci√©t√© des √©tablissements de plein air du Qu√©bec (S√âPAQ).  Special features of the park  The park terrain is characteristic of the frontier mountains in the Appalachia region, although the bulk of it is in fact the most easterly of the Mont√©r√©gie. Four peaks are accessible by hiking trails including the Pic de l'Aurore (~ 835 m),Cyberpresse du 18 sepembre 2011, Parc du Mont-M√©gantic: un nouveau secteur en cadeau Mont Victoria (~ 1050 m), Mont St. Joseph (~ 1075 m) and Mont M√©gantic (1105 m). Mont M√©gantic is the tenth highest mountain in Quebec and is the highest peak accessible by car. The park is known for its scientific observatory at the top (at an elevation of 1111 m). The observatory hosts a Ritchey-Chr√©tien telescope of 1.6 m in diameter, the most powerful of this type in North America. The site is mainly used by the University of Montreal and Laval University who are the owners. If conditions permit, naked-eye observations are possible through the telescope during the Mont M√©gantic Astronomy Festival, an event that usually takes place in early July. On September 21, 2007, following sustained efforts to reduce light pollution in the region of Mont-M√©gantic, it has been recognized as the first international Dark-sky preserve by the International Dark-Sky Association.ASTROLab du Mont- M√©gantic consult√© le 14 juillet 2010 Close to the scientific observatory is the Observatoire populaire du Mont-M√©gantic (OPMM). Equipped with a telescope of 61 cm in diameter, it is one of the largest observatories in the world built for use by the public. It is operated by ASTROLab of the Mont-M√©gantic National Park. Five hundred feet below is the ASTROLab Mont-M√©gantic National Park. ASTROLab is a museum and activity centre for public astronomy. There are exhibitions and a star cinema. At night, two public observatories, several telescopes and other observational instruments are available for public use.  Sports  In addition to a network of over 50 km of hiking trails, the park also includes trails for cross country skiing, snowshoeing, and mountain biking. Although rare, favorable wind conditions allow many hang gliders and paragliders to leap from the summit of Mount St. Joseph. Flight activities are supervised by the gliding club in Thetford Mines. The hang gliding altitude record in Quebec was achieved from the mountain in 2003. An altitude of 3749m was hit by Marco Levasseur. The ascent of Mont M√©gantic by bike is probably the most difficult in Quebec as well as being the highest elevated road in the province. The elevated portions of the many kilometres give a good challenge to those who are facing it. The Tour de Beauce (formerly called the Grand Prix de Beauce) has been partly known in the international cycling world by its arrival at altitude.

The park, with an area of , notably includes the Mount Saint-Bruno, one of the Monteregian Hills which peaks at . The mountain is shared with the Ski Mont Saint-Bruno ski resort, a quarry and a small Canadian Forces (5th GSS) training camp. Despite its relatively small size, the mountain is known for its rich fauna and flora. Situated at the heart of the old signory of Montarville , its many lakes have permitted the construction and exploitation of many water mills, contributing to the region's economical success. A building from one of those mills, the \\"Vieux Moulin\\" (Old Mill), still stands to this day and is used as a rest area for skiers and hikers in different seasons. At the beginning of the 20th century, the mountain became a luxury resort and a sought-after area for the food needs of various religious communities. One of those communities, the Brothers of Christian Instruction of St Gabriel, went as far as building a school and an arboretum for the benefit of the neighboring population. In 1976, the Government of Quebec acquired part of the mountain. It established a park in 1985 that, since 1999, is managed by the Soci√©t√© des √©tablissements de plein air du Qu√©bec (S√âPAQ). The park sees approximately visitors yearly, where hiking, cross-country skiing and alpine skiing are amongst the most popular activities enjoyed.  Toponymy  The park is named after mount Saint-Bruno, whose namesake is Saint-Bruno-de-Montarville, a municipality directly adjacent to the west flank of the mountain. The mount was known in the past as the \\"colline de Montarville\\" (hill of Montarville), from the name of the signory of Montarville. It was the establishment of the Saint-Bruno parish that provoked a gradual shift towards the current name. The parish itself was named as a tribute to the Bruneau family, its early financial contributors.  Geography  The park covers an area of . It comprises part of mont Saint-Bruno, one of the nine Monteregian Hills and is high. It is located about east of Montreal and is surrounded by the municipalities of Saint-Bruno-de-Montarville, Sainte-Julie and Saint-Basile-le-Grand, all three belonging to the administrative region of Mont√©r√©gie.  Geology  The mount Saint-Bruno as seen from north-west. The composition and geological origin of mount Saint-Bruno is similar to that of the other Monteregian hills. Formed by an intrusion of magma in the earth's crust associated with a hotspot created by the opening of the atlantic ocean approximately 124 million years ago, the Monteregian hills have been exposed to the elements by the progressive erosion of their paleozoic sedimentary layers, which are softer than their core of metamorphic and igneous rocks that typically form plutons. Contrary to popular belief, they are not volcanoes. The mountain owes its present rounded aspect to the last glaciation period and the grinding action of glacier movement. It was partially submerged by the Champlain sea, which has left shallow deposits of clay, sand, sandy gravel and gravel.Soci√©t√© de la faune et des parcs du Qu√©bec(2000), page 4. The massif's composition is mainly of peridotite accompanied by gabbro and syenite surrounded by shale and siltstone dating from the Ordovician (approximately 500 million years ago) and metamorphosed by the intrusion of magma.  Terrain  Mount Saint-Bruno is an inselberg that reaches in altitude, above a plain with an average altitude of . Its highest summits are situated on its north-eastern flank and form an ellipse around the \\"lac des Bouleaux\\" (Birch Lake). Its outer terrain gradually recedes towards the south-east and is punctuated by water-filled dips.Soci√©t√© de la faune et des parcs du Qu√©bec(2000), p. 5  Hydrography  Despite its small size, the hydrographic network of the park is well developed. It comprises five lakes, one bog, two artificial ponds and many streams, all of them part of the Richelieu River watershed. The du Moulin, Seigneurial and des Bouleaux lakes are used for the municipal water supply of Saint-Bruno-de-Montarville.  Climate  The climate of the Saint-Lawrence lowlands is moderate, subhumid and continental. It is a region in Quebec where the climate is the most clement. The average annual temperature in the park is ; the season where it stays above lasts 149 days on average and the annual insolation is 2000 hours. The mountain gets of precipitation, of which is snowfall.Soci√©t√© de la faune et des parcs du Qu√©bec(2000), pp. 3-4 Although the mountain stands at only , the conditions on the summit are a bit harsher than at the bottom, which in consequence causes altitudinal zonation. As the altitude increases, the vegetation passes from sugar maple, bitternut hickory at the base, to northern red oak, sugar maple on the summit.  Biology and ecology  According to the ecological framework of Canada, the park is located in the ecoregion of the Saint-Lawrence lowlands. This region is the one that presents the most meridional climate of the Province. It is characterized by the presence of mixed forests dominated by the sugar maple, the yellow birch, the Canadian hemlock and the eastern white pine. Approximately 60% of the region is dedicated to intensive agriculture. Urbanization is also very important as it comprises Montr√©al, Qu√©bec City and Ottawa within its area.

No trace of indigenous occupation has been found in the park. However, it is likely that the territory was occupied during the archaic period beginning at least years ago and continuing through the Sylvicole (1000 B.C. to 1500 A.D.) until the arrival of the French in the 16th century. The native indigenous culture associated with Mont-Saint-Bruno is that of the St. Lawrence Iroquoians, who disappeared around 1580.Soci√©t√© de la faune et des parcs du Qu√©bec(2000), pp. 9-13 The old water mill (Vieux-Moulin) of Saint-Bruno. In 1710, the seigneury of Montarville was conceded to Pierre Boucher, son of the neighboring seigneur of Boucherville. However, it was 30 years before the seigneury began to develop, due to a lack of navigable waterways in close enough proximity. Contrary to other seigneuries of the Montreal region, the seigneury of Saint- Bruno used water rather than wind to power its mills, which at one point numbered five and were all built between 1725 and 1816. Their hydraulic power was harnessed for grinding wheat, tanning leather, carding and spinning wool and sawing wood. The sole mill that is still standing to this day is the grain mill, rebuilt in 1761 on the site of the first mill. In 1825, the Boucher family sold the seigneury to Fran√ßois-Pierre Bruneau, a lawyer from Montreal who in turn passed it to his cousin, Olivier-Th√©ophile (who was the first professor of anatomy at McGill University in 1851. On his death, in 1855, the seigneury ceased to exist. Arch bridge built by Pease. In 1897, Edson Loy Pease, a rich banker from Montreal, acquired of the mountain. In 1899, this terrain was sold to the Mount Bruno Association, an organization created to manage the domain in shared ownership, presided by Pease until his death in 1930. The association built 10 resorts between 1899 and 1940 that are now within the park. The Pease domain, located on the lac du Moulin, was destroyed by flames in 1941. Brothers of Christian Instruction of St Gabriel seminary. At the beginning of the 20th century, four religious communities, the Society of Jesus, the Trinitarian Order, the Congregation of the Sacred Hearts of Jesus and Mary and the Brothers of Christian Instruction of St Gabriel all purchased land parcels around the mountain to flee from Montreal's sprawling urbanization and to meet the food requirements of their schools. The Brothers of Saint-Gabriel would leave the greatest imprint on the mountain. They moved in 1912 close to the Villa Grand-Coteau, which was at that time the property of the Society of Jesus. In 1922, the latter sold the Brothers all their land in the area, including the villa. The acquisition became profitable very quickly, in part because of its apple orchards, and also because of its dairy production. In 1925, they constructed a seminary that became the most important school of this congregation in Qu√©bec. In 1930, they built a cemetery and in 1954, a grotto. The brothers finally sold all their land around Mount-Saint-Bruno to the government of Qu√©bec in 1976, and in 1990, the seminary was demolished. The apple orchard as well as an arboretum, which at one point was home to 176 species of trees and bushes, are the sole remainders of this religious community's presence on the flanks of the mountain. A quarry was exploited from 1928 to the middle of the 1940s and left a gash in the mountain with a width of , a length of and a depth of on its steepest flank. In 1965, the Ski Mont Saint-Bruno ski resort was opened. With time, the proximity of this resort to the urban region of Montreal has made Mont-Saint- Bruno a well known ski school.  Creation of the Park  The visitors center. In 1969, the city of Saint-Bruno-de-Montarville acquired of land in the mountain in order to protect the lakes that form its drinking water supply. Following requests to protect the mountain, the government of Qu√©bec purchased all the land in 1975 and 1976 to make the mountain a park and a fishing and hunting reserve. Public hearings were held in 1982 aimed at creating a provincial park.Soci√©t√© de la faune et des parcs du Qu√©bec(2000), p. XIV In 2001, the status of the park was modified, along with that of all other of Quebec's provincial park, to \\"parc national\\". In 2000, public hearings were conducted again with the aim of increasing the territory covered by the park from to by annexing land belonging to the city and the Department of National Defence, the latter comprising the summit of the mountain. Finally, on the 27th of July 2012, the government of Qu√©bec announced that the area of the park was to be increased to its limits established back in 2000. Limits over which the park had full administration rights, but were not officially part of its territory. This increase in land coverage included a mire and the main hills that the park was previously missing. A few more lots were again annexed to the park in 2013, giving it its current area.  Administration  As is the case for Quebec's other national parks (with the exception of Pingualuit and Kuururjuaq national parks, which are administered by Nunavik parks), the Mont-Saint-Bruno national park has been administered by the Soci√©t√© des √©tablissements de plein air du Qu√©bec (S√âPAQ) since 1999. The S√âPAQ oversees the provision of activities and services as well as park protection and promotion. The exploitation of natural resources for forestry, mining or energy production is forbidden, as it is in any other of Quebec's parks, and so are hunting, trapping and poaching. The passage of gas or oil pipelines is also forbidden in all parks except for existing installations. The park shares its administration center with the √éles-de-Boucherville National Park, about to the west, where its offices are located.  Tourism  Cross-country skiing trail. The park is frequented by around visitors yearly, which makes it the third most visited park of the province after the Gatineau Park and the Saguenay‚ÄìSt. Lawrence Marine Park. It is accessible year round but does not possess lodging infrastructure. In summertime, it is possible to hike along a network of trails, and to bike on the park's service roads. Between the months of August and October, the orchard is open for apple picking. In wintertime, cross-country skiing and hiking are the preferred activities. The Mont-Saint-Bruno national park, with Mont-Tremblant National Park and Mont-Orford National Park, is one of three national parks in Qu√©bec that is also home to an alpine skiing resort. Ski Mont Saint-Bruno is a small station that started operating in 1965. It is known for its large ski school, currently 562 teachers strong with an attendance of around students. The resort has 15 ski slopes and is visited by skiers per season.

History Aboriginals have inhabited the Saguenay Fjord area for thousands of years prior to the first Europeans arriving. The first European to visit the area was Jacques Cartier, in 1535. Between 1628 and 1842, the Saguenay economy was heavily dependent on the fur trade. Lucius O'Brien (1880) In 1838, settlers began moving into the Saguenay region. Between 1840 and 1920, the region had a sizable lumber industry. By the end of the 19th, much of the forests around the Saguenay River were depleted. In addition to the depletion of the forests, difficult terrain and the decline of the lumber industry led to the Saguenay area remaining mostly undeveloped into the 20th century.Parc national du Fjord-du-Saguenay - History. SEPAQ. Retrieved 12 May 2012. Starting in 1970, the Quebec government began acquiring land around the fjord in hopes of protecting it. In 1982, the government held public on the park's design and boundaries. Saguenay National Park was officially created on June 8, 1983. In 1984, the park was twinned with France's C√©vennes National Park. In 1991, facilities were added to the Baie du Moulin-√†-Baude section, while in 2000, facilities were added to the Baie-Sainte-Marguerite section. On April 20, 2011, the park changed its name from Saguenay National Park to Saguenay Fjord National Park in order to emphasize the fjord's distinctiveness of being one of the most southerly fjords in the Northern Hemisphere.

Geology The geological origins of Saguenay Fjord National Park can be traced to the Grenville orogeny during the Precambrian era. This event is considered to be the beginnings to the Laurentian mountains. Around 200 million years ago, a rock basal complex between a north fault and a south fault collapsed, creating the Saguenay Graben. The graben was long and wide. During the last glacial period, the region was covered by ice sheets two to three kilometers deep. The ice sheets cut deep into the Saguenay graben, gouging the fjord in the process. The weight of the ice sheets also caused the region to sink. When the glaciers melted around 10,000 years ago, the graben was flooded by seawater. The subsequent post-glacial rebound lifted the terrain, shaping the fjord valleys in the process.Saguenay River (Boreal shield). Canadian Geographic. Retrieved 13 May 2012. Fauna Animals that can be found in the park's forests include wolves, black bears, lynx, beavers, and moose. Peregrine falcons can be found on the fjord's cliffs. Seals, brook trout, Atlantic salmon, as well as isolated populations of Greenland halibut and Arctic cod can be found in the park's waters.Parc national du Saguenay - Conservation Mission. SEPAQ.

Malicounda Bambara is especially notable for being the first village in Senegal to publicly abandon the traditional practice of female genital cutting. The Declaration On July 31, 1997, the women of Malicounda Bambara decided to announce their decision to abandon female genital cutting (FGC) to the world. They were joined by 20 Senegalese journalists as well as representatives of the Ministries of Health and Family, Social Action and National SolidarityTostan. Eclosion au S√©n√©gal: Pourquoi les populations abandonnent la pratique de l'Excision. USAID: 1999, p. 49. to witness the first public declaration ending the practice of FGC. This social convention is believed to have originated in Egypt over 2,000 years ago and today is practiced in at least 28 African countries.ONCHR, UNAIDS, UNDP, UNECA, UNESCO, UNFPA, UNHCR, UNICEF, UNIFEM, WHO. Eliminating Female genital mutilation: An interagency statement. WHO: 2008, p. 29. FGC is a social norm in practicing cultures, and an uncut women coming from a practicing village would be excluded from her social group, family, friends and have difficulty finding a spouse. The actual operation is usually done by a designated woman in the community at the behest of the mother or grandmother of the girl undergoing the procedure. Halting FGC has been an aim of various local and international NGOs since the 1970s, when the term female genital mutilation was coined in order to establish, according to the WHO, \\"a clear linguistic distinction from male circumcision, and [to emphasize] the gravity and harm of the act.\\"ONCHR, UNAIDS, UNDP, UNECA, UNESCO, UNFPA, UNHCR, UNICEF, UNIFEM, WHO. Eliminating Female genital mutilation: An interagency statement. WHO: 2008, p. 22. The term female genital cutting is generally preferred among agencies working to end the practice. FGC is seen as less stigmatizing than FGM, and indeed is the term used at the local level when discussed by practicing groups. NGOs working to end FGM/C in Senegal and elsewhere in Africa generally prefer to use FGC in an effort to communicate respect for traditional culture and avoid demonization of practitioners as well as women who have been subject to the procedure. The women of Malicounda Bambara came to their decision while taking part in the Community Empowerment Program (CEP) of the international NGO Tostan, based in Dakar. Tostan's holistic program in fact does not take the abandonment of FGC as its overarching goal; the declaration of Malicounda Bambara was made entirely on the volition of the class members ‚Äì with the support of the wider community ‚Äì after sessions covering human rights, health and hygiene. Tostan's influence After several courses addressing human rights and women's rights, facilitator Nd√©ye Maguette Diop began Session 14 of Module 7 of the CEP with her class during August 1996, focusing on the health risks associated with FGC.Tostan. Eclosion au S√©n√©gal: Pourquoi les populations abandonnent la pratique de l'Excision. USAID: 1999, p. 45. The CEP is designed so as to not pass judgment on this ancient practice, but simply to inform the population of both the short- and long-term risks associated with the operation. To better facilitate the exchange of ideas in the different modules, traditional African modes of communication and arts, such as theater, are frequently used. Diop recounts the story: > In the beginning, the women weren't very sure they wanted to act out a play > based on the story of Poolel. We had kept the name of the girl the same. > Being a pulaar name, the ideas was to not implicate Bambaras in the tragedy, > which probably helped. The women adapted the story into a play and ended up > acting it out, but would refuse to discuss it afterward. I continued to ask > them the questions, following the module; no one wanted to respond. The > discussions up until now had been very lively. I wondered: Why were they > refusing to discuss the subject? Was it because I'm wolof and have not been > cut? We repeated the session three times. After the third, they began, > timidly, to talk, and their faces began to brighten up.

They acted out > their play in other neighboring communities and decided to bring the women > of these communities into their discussion. The women participants continued over the following months to discuss the subject on their own, outside the classroom. As recounted above by Diop, a curious phenomenon in the form of a methodical, progressive approach to tackling the subject took place: \\"The discussions were organized in concentric circles. The women began them in their class. The circle enlarged when their adoptive sisters and spouses were brought into the fold. Then, little by little, the circle of knowledge, confidence and courage became bigger.\\"UNICEF/Tostan. La D√©cennie qui a fait reculer l'excision. UNICEF: 2008, p. 13. During this process, the women approached the local imam for his opinion. To their surprise, he informed them that, contrary to their belief, there was no passage in the Koran which supported the practice of FGC.Tostan. Eclosion au S√©n√©gal: Pourquoi les populations abandonnent la pratique de l'Excision. USAID: 1999, p. 47. Armed with this information, they continued the discourse using arguments based on their knowledge of the associated health risks, the lack of religious support, and the fact that FGC violates basic human rights such as the right to health and bodily integrity. By June 1997, the community collectively made the decision to organize no further FGC ceremonies: from then on, FGC would not be imposed on the daughters of Malicounda Bambara. Immediate reactions Local Tostan coordinator Malick Gu√©ye learned of the decision later that week and proceeded to inform Molly Melching and others at Tostan headquarters the startling news. The decision was made to publicize the declaration and attempt to jumpstart a national dialogue on the subject. The event of July 31, 1997 was the impetus for a slew of newspaper articles and radio interviews in which the women of Malicounda Bambara were forced to defend their decision. Many spoke out against the declaration as an abandonment of tradition under Western influence; the women countered using their knowledge of universal human rights, contending the practice hindered African development and was an affront to the rights of women and children.UNICEF/Tostan. La D√©cennie qui a fait reculer l'excision. UNICEF: 2008, p. 21. Despite the uproar, their argument resonated among other communities and the movement to abandon FGC in Senegal began to spread. Impact of the Decision The public declaration of July 31 had immediate effects, especially in the surrounding communities. While some expressed outrage, others also had participated in Tostan's program and wanted to support the decision of Malicounda Bambara. Declaration of Ngeurigne Bambara The women of Ngeurigne Bambara followed the same model as those of Malicounda Bambara, applying the same \\"strategy of communal consensus on three levels: gender, familial and village.\\"UNICEF/Tostan.

Presidential support Following these two public declarations, President Abdou Diouf threw his support behind the movement during his speech to the 33rd Congress of the International Federation of Human Rights, held in Dakar November 20, 1997, in stating the following: > Whomever says \\"human rights\\" must also necessarily speak of women's rights > as well.

History  In 1113, when King David I of Scotland granted lands to the monks of Selkirk, he also granted them the land at Bothandene (Bowden) and Hailiedene (Holydean). The charter was renewed in 1124 when the monks moved to Kelso, where they founded the magnificent Kelso Abbey. At the same time a religious establishment was founded at Bowden. The abbot of Kelso built a tower at Holydean which was destroyed in 1296. The tower was rebuilt and extended by Isabel Ker of Cessford and renamed Castle Holydean. The castle became the home of the Ker family, later the Dukes of Roxburghe, who lived there for two centuries before the castle was finally destroyed in 1760 by the 3rd Duke, John Ker. The Roxburghes moved to their new home, Floors Castle, in the early 18th century. In 1531, Bowden village was granted the right to hold a market, the first non-burghal market in Scotland, and a market cross which still stands today was erected - such was the importance of the village in mediaeval times. The cross is now used as the parish war memorial. The present Bowden Kirk was greatly enlarged in the 17th century, but parts of an older church are still evident. The church is unusual inasmuch as it has three bells, two of which are still in use. The third bell is contained inside the church and bears the inscription SOLI DEO GLORIA JOHN MEIKEL ME FECIT EDINBURGHII ANNO 1690, meaning \\"I was built by the grace of God at Edinburgh in 1690 by John Meikle\\". John Meikle was an eminent bell maker and tuner in 17th century Edinburgh. The old kirkyard contains many interesting gravestones and, under the east wing, a burial vault which contains 22 members of the Ker family, six of them Dukes of Roxburghe. The church is embellished with some wonderful stained glass windows including the Priest's Door, built at the old priest's doorway. Bowden has been blessed with education since just after the Scottish Reformation in 1590. The last school was built in the middle of the 19th century but closed in the mid 20th century. The school and schoolmaster's house are still standing and are used as private homes. The Bowden village well was erected in 1861 and still stands in the atmospheric village adjacent to the old school. The village hall was erected in 1896. While the first mention of Bowden is in the early 12th century, its original name of Bothanden is from the old English language meaning houses at the stream, the stream in question being the Bowden Burn which cuts through the village. Many artifacts from the Iron-Age have been found in and around Bowden, and there were even traces of an old military road from the Romans in Scotland period. It is known that ancient British tribes lived on the Eildon Hills. The Romans built a fort at nearby Newstead and named it Trimontium, meaning three hills. Originally the people of Bowden were farm labourers and weavers, but in modern times the village is inhabited by many professional people, including doctors, nurses and schoolteachers. After local government restructuring in the early 1970s, Bowden became part of the newly formed Scottish Borders Council. The war memorial in Bowden dates from 1915, reflecting the early local sacrifice made by this community during World War One. The memorial was designed by Sir Robert Lorimer.Dictionary of Scottish Architects: Robert Lorimer  Community Facilities  Bowden has a recently refurbished village hall in the centre of the village. This building has a hall with capacity for 100 people and several break out rooms. Catering facilities are also available. To the south of the village lies the village church, which dates back to 1128.  Notable people associated with Bowden  * Thomas Aird * Lady Grisell Baillie * Lauder Brunton * William Dick (d. 1925), supported Bowden's village development with his legacy  Listed Buildings  There are many listed buildings, of various categories, in around the village of Bowden, including the kirk, schoolhouse, market cross and the well.

Career  Mandel became involved in music from an early age. He started playing the piano at 4 and picked up the guitar aged 8. Growing up in an Orthodox Jewish household, he found his parents less than encouraging of his musical endeavors.Fred Mandel - Profile at Jewish Telegraph Retrieved January 12, 2019. Nevertheless, in 1964, at the age of 11, his family moved to Toronto, where he became immersed in the local music scene. Mandel made his first appearance on record courtesy of Domenic Troiano (whose band he was in at the time). Troiano was invited to record on Alice Cooper's first solo record and got Mandel to play keyboards on the record. This led to Alice Cooper inviting Mandel to join his live band. Mandel did this for four years (1977-1980) progressing from keyboards to lead guitar and finally ending up working as the musical director. During his work with Alice Cooper, Mandel was invited to play keyboards on the Pink Floyd album The Wall and this was followed up by some recordings with Cheap Trick. In the 1980s, Mandel was asked to perform with Queen on their 1982 tour supporting their album Hot Space (the Hot Space Tour). He struck up a good working relationship with the band and was later invited to be a contributing musician on their 1984 album The Works (thus becoming the first significant guest performer on a Queen record). Mandel performed on 'Man on the Prowl' and three of the album's singles, \\"Radio Ga Ga\\", \\"Hammer to Fall\\", and \\"I Want to Break Free\\" (the famous synthesizer solo on the latter, often mistaken for guitar, is played by Mandel on a Roland Jupiter-8). Mandel also played on two Queen spinoffs: Brian May's 1983 mini album Star Fleet Project and Freddie Mercury's 1985 album Mr. Bad Guy. Following this, Mandel went on tour with Supertramp who were performing their last gigs with their original line up on a tour named Famous Last Words. Later on, Mandel was offered the chance play with his teen idol Elton John, whom Mandel states as being \\"...to this day, one of the most bad-ass rock and roll piano players around!\\" In 2013, Mandel worked with legendary thrash band Anthrax on the track \\"Smokin'\\", originally by Boston, ultimately released on Anthrax's album Anthems, an EP principally featuring covers from some of the band's favorite acts of the 1970s, along with two versions of \\"Crawl\\", a song from their previous studio album.

After school she attended teachers college in Bloemfontein, qualified there as a primary teacher, and later married and had three children. Her daughter, Riandi, became South Africa's first ever Primary School Champion in the race walk at 12 years old. Over the next few years, her two younger children, Christo and Thinus, also won the primary schools title. Booyens was suffering from severe depression when she met race walking coach Carl Meyer. He encouraged her to take up the same sport as her children and coached her over the telephone. Two months later he saw her race walking and immediately recognised a massive talent. He started to coach her to compete in national events and she soon won against long established South African Masters Champions. She had not participated in any competitive sport until 2006, aged 45.

Geographic distribution Acalypha indica occurs widely throughout the Old World tropics. In Africa, it occurs in Nigeria in West Africa and further widely throughout tropical Africa and the Indian Ocean islands. It also occurs in India, South East Asia, Yemen, and Oceania. It has been introduced to the New World Tropics. Effect on domestic cats Throughout the area where the plant grows, it is widely known for its effect on domestic cats, which react very strongly and favorably to the root of the plant. In this regard it is very similar to catnip, but the effect is much more pronounced. For this reason it is called in Tamil, and (excited cat tree) in Malay and () in Sinhala. Acalypha indica from Pondichery Botanical Garden Traditional uses The plant has many traditional medicinal uses. In Madagascar, the crushed plant is used for skin parasites. In Mauritius, the sap of crushed leaves mixed with salt, or a decoction of plant, is used for scabies and other skin problems. In the Seychelles and R√©union, a root infusion or decoction is taken for asthma, and also to clean the liver and kidneys. The root decoction is also taken for intestinal worms and stomach ache. The leaf sap is taken as an emetic. An infusion together with the roots of Tylophora indica is taken in R√©union as an emetic in the case of poisoning. A leaf infusion is also taken as a purgative and vermifuge in R√©union and Madagascar. In East Africa sap of the leaves is used for eye infections. Leaf powder is used for maggot-infested wounds. Acalypha indica is listed in the Pharmacopoeia of India as an expectorant to treat asthma and pneumonia. It was formerly listed in the British Pharmacopoeia. This plant is held in high esteem in traditional Tamil Siddha medicine as it is believed to rejuvenate the body.Dr. J. Raamachandran, Herbs of Siddha Medicines: The First 3D Book on Herbs The plant has also been eaten as a vegetable in Africa and India, but care needs when eating it since it contains several alkaloids as well as hydrocyanic acid.

Chemical constituents The arial parts contain a cyanogenic glycoside called acalyphin (a 3-cyanopyridone derivative) as well as flavonoids, such as kaempferol glycosides mauritianin, clitorin, nicotiflorin, and biorobin. Tannins, Œ≤-sitosterol, acalyphamide, aurantiamide, succinimide, and flindersin (a pyranoquinolinone alkaloid) have also been isolated. The chemicals that attract cats are the iridoid compounds isodihydronepetalactone and isoiridomyrmecin. Medicinal effects and uses Cat plays with Acalypha indica Some of the chemical compounds in Acalypha indica cause dark chocolate- brown discoloration of blood, and gastrointestinal irritation in rabbits. Ingestion of Acalypha indica may lead to hemolysis in people suffering from glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase deficiency. Acalyphin is used as a substitute for ipecacuanha, a vermifuge, expectorant and emetic. Acalypha indica leaves are used in the traditional medicine of India as a jaundice remedy.

It acts as a neurotoxin by irreversibly blocking A-type voltage-dependent K+-channels. Etymology and source Discrepin is named after its source: a Venezuelan scorpion called Tityus discrepans. Its systematic number is Œ±-KTx15.6. Chemistry The subfamily Œ±-KTx15 consists of 6 toxins. The first five toxins of this subfamily are very much alike, but discrepin only shares 50% amino acid homology with other members of this subfamily. Discrepin contains 38 amino acid residues. It has a polyglutamic acid at its N-terminal region. Discrepin has the Œ± and Œ≤ folds that are characteristic of scorpion toxins. It consists of one Œ±-helix and three Œ≤-sheet helix strands. The Œ±-helix is formed from amino acid Ser11 until Arg21. The three antiparallel Œ≤-sheets are formed from amino acid Ile2 until Lys7, Ala27 until Cys29 and Arg33 until Cys36. Target Discrepin blocks voltage-gated Shal-type (Kv4.x) K+ channels in cerebellar granular cells. These A-type K+ channels regulate firing frequency, spike initiation and the waveform of action potentials. Discrepin has yet only been tested in cerebellar cells, however, Kv4.x family channels are in general highly expressed in the brain, heart and smooth muscles. Competition experiments showed that discrepin inhibits the binding of scorpion toxin BmTx3 to its receptor site, where other K+ channel blockers (Kv1-, Kv3.4-, Kv4.2/4.3 family blockers) were unable to compete with this toxin. These results support the hypothesis that discrepin can bind to a very specific and unique type of Kv4.x receptor channels. The residues of discrepin that are important for blocking these channels have not yet been clarified. However, it is clear that the N-terminal plays a role in the binding affinity. The stoichiometry of toxin binding to the potassium channel is 1:1. Mode of action Discrepin specifically blocks the IA currents (fast transient, low-voltage-activated currents) of voltage-dependent K+ channels. Inhibition of these K+ currents occurs in an irreversible manner, i.e. washing out of the toxin gives no recovery of the currents. The kinetics of the channel are not affected by discrepin and the blockage is independent of the holding potential. Toxicity The half-effective dose (IC50) is 190 ¬± 30 nM.

A second, smaller, arched entrance is the main entryway into the porch and house. Early 1900s ironworks gracefully separate the front porch from the front street sidewalk. The front doors of the house are wooden louvered characteristic of the middle-to-late 19th century. A circular front wall wind hole with decorative molding accentuates the porch; another smaller circular opening decorates high above the archway into the porch. The interior consists of nine rooms, a long, sunny, lateral hallway with multiple wooden veneer shutters, and an external cobble-stone foyer leading to the back courtyard. The architectural style is described as Neoclassical, with other 20th century elements. The house was built as a wooden structure before 1864, when it was acquired by Domingo Paoli, the father of Antonio Paoli. By 1870, the house had been upgraded into a wood and brick masonry residence. In 1914 it was upgraded into the current brick and stucco structure by the prominent local architect and civil engineer Manuel V. Domenech. Antonio Paoli Antonio Paoli was born in this house on April 14, 1871. From a young age, he would accompany his parents to opera performances at the Teatro La Perla, located some six blocks from this house. An inspiring performance there by the Italian tenor Pietro Baccei helped him decide what he wanted to be \\"when he grew up\\". His parents nurtured his ambition by enrolling him in a voice training school. However, when Antonio was just 12 years old his parents died. Paoli moved to Spain to live with his sister, Amalia, who was also a singer. Amalia also encouraged her younger brother to pursue his dream of becoming an opera singer. After studying at the Royal Monastery of El Escorial in Madrid, Spain, and the Academia de Canto La Scala in Milan, Italy, Paoli made his debut in Paris. He went on to earn numerous honors and awards around the world and came to be affectionately known as both \\"The King of Tenors\\" and as \\"The Tenor of the Kings\\". He returned to Puerto Rico in 1917. Antonio and Amalia established a voice training school in San Juan. They also helped in theater productions at San Juan's Municipal Theater. In 1934, the San Juan Municipal Theater was renamed The Antonio Paoli Theater in his honor. Paoli died on August 24, 1946, and was buried in the Puerto Rico Memorial Cemetery in Isla Verde. On April 13, 2005, his remains were exhumed and transferred to Ponce's Roman Baldorioty de Castro National Pantheon.La Perla del Sur. Ponce Puerto Rico. April 6‚Äì12, 2005. Antonio Paoli is considered to be the first Puerto Rican to achieve international fame in the musical arts. The museum at Casa Paoli gives visitors insight into the fascinating life story and achievements of Puerto Rico's \\"Tenor of the Kings\\". Interior gallery Museum and research center Today Casa Paoli functions as a museum research center on Puerto Rican culture. The building is the headquarters of the Centro de Investigaciones Folkloricas de Puerto Rico (Puerto Rico Center for Folkloric Research). The Center's mission is to foster Puerto Rico's cultural traditions as well as popular arts.

He served in Metlika and Tr≈æiƒç, where he also became the parish priest in 1928. In 1940 he was appointed an episcopal advisor and Ljubljana canon. During the Axis partition and annexation of Slovenia in the Second World War he assisted refugee priests. In 1944 he became the rector of the seminary. As general vicar, in June 1945 he assumed the leadership of the Diocese of Ljubljana after Gregorij Ro≈æman fled Yugoslavia. He was installed as bishop on 1 December 1946 and named auxiliary bishop of Ljubljana. In 1950 he was named apostolic administrator of the Diocese of Ljubljana with the rights of a bishop in residence. From 1951 to 1961 he also administered the Slovene part of Rijeka and from 1951 to 1955 the Slovene part of the Diocese of Trieste-Koper. After the death of Gregorij Ro≈æman in Cleveland in 1959, Vovk was ordained bishop of Ljubljana. Pope John XXIII raised the Diocese of Ljubljana to an archbishopric on 22 December 1961, simultaneously elevating Vovk to the position of archbishop of Ljubljana. The communist regime persecuted Vovk mentally (through nighttime interrogations) and physically, although he had not cooperated with the Axis forces during the war and had promoted Slovene identity. Vovk steadfastly sought to have the communist authorities recognize the constitutionally defined position of the Church and to abandon their persecution and accusations against it.

The maritime museum is located within the grounds of the fortress Keep of the former Royal Naval Dockyard in Sandys Parish on the Ireland Island at the western end of Bermuda. The museum publishes a number of books relating to Bermuda's history. History After the English colonies in North America had established their independence, Bermuda was developed as a major British naval base to control the sea lanes to North America. The Dockyard construction started in 1809 and continued for a century. Buildings of the Keep were constructed using the local limestone. Work was done initially by slaves, later by convicts, prisoners, and laborers imported from the West Indies. The dockyard closed in the late fifties, and buildings started to fall into disrepair. In 1974 the Bermuda Maritime Museum took over the site of the Keep and restoration began. The museum changed its name in 2009 to reflect its broader national focus; this name change was formalised in 2013 after an amendment was made to the Museum's Act.https://maritimemuseums.files.wordpress.com/2016/05/from-a-volunteer- based-maritime-museum-to-a-national-institution.pdf Buildings View from the Commissioner's House over the Keep Yard towards the 1850 Ordnance House and the entry of the Museum The Keep of the dockyard was its citadel and arsenal and protected it against potential attacks from land or sea. Defenses include bastions \\"A\\" to \\"G\\", ramparts and casemats, equipped with numerous guns including now displayed 24-pounder and 32-pounder carronades, 6-inch shell guns and magazine breech-loading guns. The Keep Yard is surrounded on three sides by buildings and magazines; the fourth side is the location of a statue of Neptune. The 1837 Shifting House once stored muskets and gunpowder. Among the storage facilities are the 1850 Ordnance Building that stored 4,860 kegs of gunpowder on a floor of non-sparking bitumen, the 1852 Ordnance House, and the 1853/1890 Ordnance House. The 1870 High Cave magazine is located above a now flooded cave. The Commissioner's House takes a commanding position at the center of the Keep. Designed by Edward Holl, it was erected within five years in the 1820s as the world's first residence using prefabricated cast- iron for its structural framework.\\"Restoration of the Commissioner's House\\" It decayed after the departure of the British, but after the museum took control in 1974, it has been restored over a period of 25 years. Exhibits The Commissioner's House is used to display a number of exhibitions. The basement shows Bermuda's Defense Heritage, a display about Bermuda's defenses and fortifications and the role of local forces in World War I and World War II. The pillored hall is site of a two-storey History of Bermuda mural by the Bermudian artist Graham Foster. The main floor has a number of themes related to Bermuda's history including slavery, immigration, and tourism. One room is dedicated to the history of the Bermuda Race. The upper floor contains collections of maps, books, coins, maritime art, and exhibits concerning activities of the Royal Navy and the US Forces, specifically during World War II. Other buildings show shipwreck artifacts, local watercrafts, or are under renovation (2009). The High Cave magazine displays artifacts relating to prisoners from the Boer Wars, and World Wars I and II.

It was their fourth consecutive single, and fifth overall, to reach the top 20 of the UK singles chart, peaking at number 13.

The main version includes a sample of \\"Oh L'amour\\" performed by Dollar, while the \\"Bigpipe Style\\" version (which features the main riff played on bagpipes) samples Suzi Quatro's hit \\"Devil Gate Drive\\". Orbital's request to use a sample from a Rolf Harris stylophone demonstration disc was turned down. The other versions are \\"Old Style\\", a more club-oriented dance mix; and \\"New Style\\", a retro-styled version with live bass by Andy James. All of the mixes are by Orbital themselves; the duo had wanted Stereolab to remix the track, but the latter group were on tour at the time and unavailable, so the \\"New Style\\" mix is Orbital's own version of a Stereolab-type mix.

It blocks various potassium channels, among others the inward-rectifier potassium ion channel ROMK1. Lq2 Alternative names Lq2 is also known as Potassium channel toxin alpha-KTx 1.2, Charybdotoxin-2, ChTX-Lq2, ChTx-d, Toxin 18-2 or Lqh 18-2. Etymology The name Lq2 refers to the name of the animal species in which the toxin can be found. Lq2 can be found in the scorpion Leiurus quinquestriatus (Lq). Lq2 is structurally similar to Lq1, which had been found previously and which is also a potassium channel blocker. Sources Lq2 is a component of the venom of the scorpion Leiurus quinquestriatus, known under various names, for example the deathstalker, the Israeli desert scorpion or the yellow scorpion. Structure Lq2 is a small peptide of 37 amino acids. Lq2 contains the classical scorpion toxin alpha-beta scaffold and is structurally similar to the neurotoxin Charybdotoxin (CTX). Lq2 consists of an Œ±-helix and a Œ≤-sheet, connected by an Œ±Œ≤3 loop containing disulfide bridges. The proteins three-dimensional structure has been reconstructed using nuclear magnetic resonance techniques. Target Lq2 interacts with all three types of potassium channels: the voltage-activated, the Ca2+\\\\- activated and the inward-rectifier potassium channels. The unique trait of Lq2 is its high affinity for certain inward-rectifier potassium ion channels, especially the Renal Outer Medullary Potassium channel ROMK1. This ion channel contributes to the regulation of the resting membrane potential. Mode of action Since all potassium channels share the same ion conducting outer pore structure, Lq2 binds to all three potassium channel types. Lq2 interacts with the T-X-X-T-X- GT-X-X-T-X-GY/F-Gt K+-selective section within the pore-forming region (P-region) of the ROMK1 ion channel. It blocks the channel, binding in a 1:1 stoichiometric ratio with its Œ≤-sheet. Therapeutic use Potential use of Lq2 is mainly in cardiovascular diseases.

Based at Glenhead Park from 1929, the club colours were green with white sleeves. History Founded in 1894 as a juvenile side, they turned Junior in 1896 and came to prominence by reaching the semi-finals of the Scottish Junior Cup in 1899, losing 2‚Äì0 to Parkhead. A group of players broke away from this side to form the club that became Clydebank Juniors.http://www.clydebankprogrammesonline.co.uk/Club%20History.html This first incarnation of the Hibs became defunct in 1909. Revived in 1919, the club joined the Scottish Junior League, enjoying immediate success with promotion in their first season and becoming league champions in 1923. Later that decade, Duntocher sided with the rebels during the Intermediate dispute and joined the breakaway Scottish Intermediate League upon its formation in 1927. It was during the 1950s however, that the team had its most successful period, reaching the West of Scotland Cup final in 1954, losing to Kilsyth Rangers, followed by the Scottish Junior Cup final in 1955 only to lose to the same opposition after a replay. The first game at Hampden Park was watched by a crowd of 64,976. The club also won the Central League championship decider on two occasions, defeating Benburb in 1951 and Parkhead in 1958. They were to reach the semi-final of the Junior Cup in 1957, losing out to Banks O' Dee and were runners-up to Pollok in the Pompey Cup in the 1958‚Äì59 season. During this spell they were managed by Willie Walsh and Jim McLean. After a period in abeyance between 1966‚Äì73, the club name was revived by the new tenants of Glenhead Park, Drumchapel Amateurs, for a third spell. Despite some reasonable success, financial pressures forced the club out of the Junior game for a final time in 1980. Notable players Numerous players stepped up to Senior football from the club over the years. Hibs also had sixteen players capped for the Scotland Junior international team. These capped players include: *Paddy Crerand ‚Äì Celtic, Manchester United and Scotland *Dick Beattie ‚Äì Celtic goalkeeper in the 1957 Scottish League Cup Final, later to receive a lifetime ban from the game for involvement in the British betting scandal of 1964. *Edward Maxwell ‚Äì Celtic 1958. *Dennis Gillespie ‚Äì Originally stepped up to Alloa. Over 400 appearances for Dundee United and inducted to that club's Hall of Fame. Stadium The club originally played at Fore Park in Duntocher before moving to St Helena Park in the neighbouring village of Hardgate. After purchasing a field from a local farmer in 1924, the club embarked on a project to build their own stadium using local volunteer labour. This new ground, known as Glenhead Park, was eventually opened on September 6, 1929.http://bahai-library.com/index.php?file=boyd_memoirs_father Duntocher closed down in 1940 for the duration of the war and Glenhead was badly damaged in the 1941 Clydebank Blitz. When the club reformed in 1946, Hibs groundshared for two seasons at New Kilbowie Park with Clydebank Juniors. They resumed playing at Glenhead in August 1948 and the ground would remain the club's home until their demise in 1980. After Hibs folded for the second time, the ground was taken over by the current occupiers, Drumchapel Amateurs. Clydebank used the ground under a five-year deal with Drumchapel on their return to the Junior grade in 2003 before departing to groundshare with Yoker Athletic.Bankies are coming Holm clydebankpost.co.uk 18 June 2008 There is talk locally of restarting the 'Hibs'.http://www.eveningtimes.co.uk/juniors- hero-mcculloch-poised-for-bellsdale-return-1.937097 eveningtimes.co.uk 11 September 2008 Honours *Scottish Junior League winners: 1922‚Äì23 *Central League Championship winners: 1950‚Äì51, 1957‚Äì58 *Scottish Junior League Division Two winners: 1919‚Äì20 *Central League Division B winners: 1975‚Äì76 *Central League Cup winners: 1956‚Äì57 *Scottish Junior League Victory Consolation Cup winners: 1919‚Äì20, 1924‚Äì25 *Pompey Cup winners: 1949‚Äì50 References Sources *Scottish Football Historical Archive *Player Database Category:Association football clubs established in 1894 Category:Association football clubs disestablished in 1980 Category:Scottish Junior Football Association clubs Category:Sport in West Dunbartonshire Category:Defunct football clubs in Scotland Category:1894 establishments in Scotland Category:1980 disestablishments in Scotland Category:Clydebank ","title":"Duntocher Hibernian F.C."},{"id":"24663084","text":"William C.

McBride and Dorothy Frooks, Stork Club, 1952 McBride published James Branch Cabell's twelfth book, Jurgen, A Comedy of Justice (1919), which was the subject of a celebrated obscenity case shortly after its publication. The hero, Jurgen, who considers himself a \\"monstrous clever fellow\\", embarks on a journey through ever more fantastic realms, even to hell and heaven. Everywhere he goes, he winds up seducing the local women, including the Devil's wife. The novel was denounced by the New York Society for the Suppression of Vice; which attempted to bring a prosecution for obscenity. The case went on for two years before Cabell and McBride won: the \\"indecencies\\" were double entendres that also had a perfectly decent interpretation, though it appeared that what had actually offended the prosecution most was a joke about papal infallibility. Publisher‚Äôs Hoax In 1924 McBride received a manuscript so terrible that it was funny. He published the book in a smart jacket, the critics praised it, but it did not sell.

The story describes the interactions between an elderly author and a young staffer from a publishing company as they collaborate on a book cover design for the author's latest novel. Saisei based the interactions on her own experience when she was writing , and was working with book designer Kumiko Tochiori in 1959. The novel is written as a collection of letters between the two. Summary Shozo Murata is an elderly author who is living in Hiroshima in a historical port town that used to be part of the Kitamaebune trade route. He lives alone with only a red goldfish for a companion. One day, he receives a visit from Tochiko Orimi, a young woman from the publishing firm in Tokyo. She is substituting for the usual liaison, but at their first meeting, Murata sends her away. After she leaves the island, Murata sees a drawing of a dragon on the beach that the women drew for a boy. He decides to invite her back. When she arrives for his manuscript, Murata asks about her life. Orimi tells him she used to perform shadow plays when she was a college student. Murata asks her to perform it for the kids on the island. Her visits become more frequent as she picks up manuscripts from Murata and entertains the kids. Murata asks Orimi what she thinks of his previous story. After she gives her opinion, he gives her his latest manuscript. She asks him about the design of the book cover. Murata asks about the shadow pictures that Orimi uses in her play. She replies that she made them from her father's ink rubbing of a sea bream. Murata asks her to make an ink rubbing of his red goldfish. But she feels sorry for the red goldfish, because that would mean it would have to die. And that becomes a quiet issue for Tochiko, and Shozo will repent what he has done with her. Two months later, Murata sees Orimi at a hospital. Unfortunately she has cancer, but Murata wishes for her recovery. Characters * Shozo Murata - a 68-year-old author who lives in an island in Hiroshima. He was a popular author in Tokyo, but when he became ill ten years ago, he moved to Hiroshima, back to his home town, and writes his novels there. * Tochiko Orimi - a 28-year-old editor working for a publishing company in Tokyo. She likes Murata's novels, and volunteered to visit him on the island to gather his manuscripts. She does not tell Murata that she has a terminal cancer. * Yohei - a shopkeeper who owns a grocery store on the island. * Kaori - Yohei's wife. * Ito - Tochiko's colleague and editor PTV drama In 2009, NHK Hiroshima developed a live- action drama based on the novel. The theme of the drama is \\"the brightness of the life\\". The story takes place in Osakishinojima Island, a fictional historical town in the Seto Inland Sea. The screenplay was written by Aya Watanabe, who had worked on House of Himiko and the live-action adaptation of the A Gentle Breeze in the Village manga. The director of the drama was Hiroshi Kurosaki, who would later direct the TV drama for Second Virgin. The drama was filmed in Hiroshima. The Osakishinojima town scenes were filmed at Kure, and the hospital scenes were filmed at The Japanese Red Cross Hiroshima College of Nursing in Hatsukaichi.

Early years Muhammad Mustapha Adebayo Akanbi was born on 11 September 1932 at Accra, Ghana, to Muslim parents from Ilorin in Nigeria. After completing secondary school he worked as an Executive officer in the Ghana Civil Service. He was also active as a trade unionist. Moving to Nigeria, he worked in the School Broadcasting Department of the Ministry of Education. Lawyer and judge Akanbi obtained a scholarship to study law at the Institute of Administration, now Ahmadu Bello University, Zaria, followed by legal studies in the United Kingdom. He was called to the English Bar in 1963, and was called to the Nigerian Bar in January 1964. He joined the Ministry of Justice and became a Senior State Counsel in 1968. In 1969 he set up in private practice in Kano. In 1974 he was appointed a judge of the Federal Revenue Court, and in January 1977 he was elevated to the Court of Appeal Bench. In 1992 he was made President of the Nigerian Court of Appeal, a position he held until retiring in 1999. His son is also a lawyer, becoming Chairman of the Ilorin branch of the Nigerian Bar Association. Independent Corrupt Practices Commission In 2000 President Olusegun Obasanjo appointed Akanbi as Chairman of the newly established Independent Corrupt Practices Commission (ICPC). By 2004, the ICPC had failed to obtain any significant convictions, and Akanbi publicly questioned why the government had set up the ICPC and appointed competent people to run it \\"only to frustrate it from performing by starving it of funds\\". He said that another issue was that the law forbade it from investigating corrupt practices dating before the creation of the ICPC. In March 2004, Akanbi urged parliamentarians to ratify the United Nations and the African Union Conventions Against Corruption, which would greatly assist the struggle against corruption. As of July 2005, the ICPC charged 85 people but had only secured two corruption- related convictions. Commenting on this record, Akbani said he suspected that some judges had been paid off to toss out cases. In September 2005 Akanbe said, \\"Corruption has been described as a cankerworm, a malaise that has afflicted our nation and done havoc to our corporate existence\\". He attributed the problem to lack of will by past military leaders to fight corruption, inconsistency in government policies, and reluctance by law enforcement agencies to arrest and prosecute \\"sacred cows\\". In retirement Akanbi retired in 2005 on completion of the first term of office. He joined the board of the Justice and Law Enforcement Reformation Organization, a non-profit organization that aims to eradicate corruption and poverty from the perspective of the Judiciary and Law Enforcement agencies. In 2006, Akanbi established the Mustapha Akanbi Foundation in Ilorin, Kwara State, dedicated to strengthening civil society groups, governmental agencies and private business concerns and helping them imbibe a culture of transparency and accountability. In August 2009 he called on Nigerian Muslims to shun the ideas of the Boko Haram sect, which teaches that non-Islamic education is a sin. He said that both Western and Islamic education were germane to the development of mankind.

It is significant for its contributions to plant systematics, and to African floristics and phytogeography.  Background  In 1816, an exploration party under the command of James Hingston Tuckey was sent to Africa to establish whether the stretches of river then named the Niger River and the Congo River were one river or two. The expedition failed dismally: within a few months of reaching the river, many of the party were dead, including Tuckey and the expedition botanist Christen Smith (also known as Christian Smith and Chetian Smith). The botanical assistant, David Lockhart, survived, and eventually returned a collection of around 600 plant species to Joseph Banks. Banks turned the collection over to Brown to arrange it, and see what might be published based on it. Brown compiled a small flora, preparing several hundred names for publication, but the manuscript was never published, and only a few names were published elsewhere. However, Brown also prepared a paper of more general observations. Entitled Observations, systematical and geographical, on the herbarium collected by Professor Christian Smith, in the vicinity of the Congo, during the expedition to explore that river, under the command of Captain Tuckey, in the year 1816, this appeared first as Appendix V of the official account of Tuckey's expedition, published posthumously under Tuckey's name in 1818, as Narrative of an expedition to explore the River Zaire.  Content  The organisation of Brown's Congo, as it became known at the time, follows that of his earlier essay on the flora of Australia, General remarks, geographical and systematical, on the botany of Terra Australis. It begins with remarks on the floristic composition of the collection, considering the relative proportions of monocots to dicots, and comparing the floristic richness with that of other equatorial regions. Brown then discusses each family represented in the collection, in the process splitting up Bernard de Jussieu's Terebinthaceae, and publishing for the first time Connaraceae, Oxalidaceae, Chailletiaceae (now included in Dichapetalaceae), Chrysobalanaceae, Homaliaceae (now included in Salicaceae), Hydrophyllaceae (now Hydrophylloideae) and Phytolaccaceae. Melastomataceae is given an accurate circumscription, as is Berberidaceae, despite this family not occurring in central Africa. Brown also names and roughly identifies Loganiaceae, though formal publication would have to wait for Carl Friedrich Philipp von Martius in 1827. Of these remarks on the systematics of various families, David Mabberley has claimed \\"the observations are of immense value to botanists and of almost breathtaking insight.\\" The paper concludes with comparisons of the vegetation of the Congo with those of West Africa, South Africa, St. Helena and Madagascar; West Africa is found to be very much similar, and South Africa remarkably different. Comparisons are then made with South America, and consideration is given to how certain distributions might have come about. Noting that the collection contains around 250 new species and about 32 new genera, yet no new family, Brown concludes with the observation that there are no plant families endemic to tropical Africa.  Reception  Initial reception of Brown's Congo was divided. The Quarterly Review praised it, describing it as \\"highly ingenious and interesting. Indeed [it] is arranged in so clear and perspicuous a manner, is so abundant in facts and philosophical reasoning, and displays such depth of research, as will, we think, establish his character as the first botanist of the age.\\" However, Brown's use of the Natural System was regretted. On the other hand, Richard Salisbury, Brown's enemy and persona non grata in botanical circles, published a stinging review in the Monthly Review, opening with the claim that Brown's success was due to his \\"exclusive advantages\\" as Banks' librarian, \\"rather than any natural predilection for botany\\", and going on to declare \\"Mr. B's chief delight has been to express his meaning in the greatest number of words\\", and poking fun at Brown's over-use of the word remarkable. Salisbury then summarises Brown's observations, rejecting or mocking as insignificant or unoriginal virtually all of his findings.  Publication history  The work has appeared in the following publications:  (a separately published offprint) * Tuckey's book, including Brown's appendix, was translated into French, and a German translation later appeared in Christian Gottfried Daniel Nees von Esenbeck's 1827 Robert Brown's Vermischte botanische Schriften.

Marcus Mettius or Metius (fl. mid-1st century BC) was a supporter of Julius Caesar in the 50s and 40s BC. Diplomatic envoy During the first year of the Gallic Wars, Caesar sent Mettius and the Helvian Celt Gaius Valerius Troucillus as envoys to the Suebian king Ariovistus, in what was presented as a last-ditch effort to prevent a full-scale war. Instead, Ariovistus accused the two of spying and arrested them. Troucillus was chained and subjected to at least psychological torture, but Mettius seems to have received better treatment, perhaps because he had a longstanding relationship (hospitium) with the Suebian.Julius Caesar, Commentarii de Bello Gallico 1.46 and 52. On the hospitium between Ariovistus and Mettius, see Andrew Wallace-Hadrill, Patronage in Ancient Society (Routledge, 1989), p. 140 online. The abuse of envoys was a violation of the ius gentium, the customary law of international relations,Daniel Peretz, \\"The Roman Interpreter and His Diplomatic and Military Roles,\\" Historia 55 (2006), p. 454. but it has been observed that Ariovistus's charge may not have been groundless.John H. Collins, ‚ÄúCaesar as Political Propagandist,‚Äù in Aufstieg und Niedergang der r√∂mischen Welt 1.1 (1972), p. 930 online: \\"it is hard to avoid the feeling that if we had an independent report of the incident from the German side we should learn that the envoys' conduct was not quite so diplomatically correct as Caesar has represented it\\"; also N.J.E. Austin and N.B. Rankov Exploratio: Military and Political Intelligence in the Roman World from the Second Punic War to the Battle of Adrianople (Routledge, 1995), p. 55. Since Ariovistus had been declared a Friend of the Roman People (amicus populi romani) during Caesar's consulship in 59 BC, the hospitium between him and Mettius might have had to do with the diplomacy that led to the declaration of friendship.This assumption is common enough to have been noted in a student textbook for Caesar's commentaries edited by Francis W. Kelsey (Boston, 1918), p. 117 online. Mettius is sometimes identified as a businessman, presumably of the equestrian order; trade with the Germanic peoples at the time might have involved slaves, animals, or goods.In Caesar: Life of a Colossus (Yale University Press, 2006), Adrian Goldsworthy identifies Mettius, whose praenomen he gives erroneously as Caius, as a merchant (p. 229 online). Others have made a Romanized Gaul of Mettius; see the conjecture of T.P. Wiseman under \\"Monetalis\\" following. None of these have a basis in the text of the Bellum Gallicum. Caesar says only that he chose Mettius for the mission because of his ties to Ariovistus,Bellum Gallicum 1.46.4: qui hospitio Ariovisti utebatur. and provides no further information about the man's social rank, ethnicity, or occupation. Monetalis In 44 BC, Mettius was a moneyer (monetalis), one of four men (IIIIviri) minting both in his own name and in Caesar's. His fellow moneyers were L. Aemilius Buca, P. Sepulius Macer, and C. Cossutius Maridianus.T.R.S. Broughton, The Magistrates of the Roman Republic (American Philological Association, 1952), vol. 2, pp. 446. Coins from this period with iconography of Juno Sospita bear the name of M. Mettius. The reverse of one coinSee Coin Archives. features Sospita in a biga (two-horse chariot) holding a shield and spear and wearing her distinctive goat-horned headdress. On another, the obverse depicts Sospita and a coiled snake, with an image of Victory in a biga on the reverse. A third type shows a girl and snake facing each other.Gary D. Farney, Ethnic Identity and Aristocratic Competition in Republican Rome (Cambridge University Press, 2007), p. 274 online. The cult of Juno Sospita was based in Lanuvium, in Latium. T.P. Wiseman, however, noted that Mettii are found in Liguria and the ethnically Celtic upper Po Valley, and speculated whether Mettius had \\"adopted a Lanuvine coin type to divert attention from his real origin?\\"T.P.

Life He was installed as abbot in 1493, the election of Thomas Wasyn having been quashed by the Bishop of Bath and Wells. In 1503 the king sent Bere, with two other ambassadors, to Rome to congratulate Pope Pius III on his elevation; but the pope died a few weeks after his election. In this year also he supplicated the congregation of the university of Oxford for a degree in divinity. In 1508 he was engaged in a controversy with William Warham, archbishop of Canterbury, concerning the genuineness of the relics of St Dunstan at Glastonbury. Finding that the worshippers at the shrine of the saint picked off its ornaments, the abbot had caused it to be raised out of reach. The monks of Canterbury saw in this change in the position of the shrine an attempt to increase popular veneration. By order of the archbishop a search for the relics was made at Canterbury on 20 April, and Warham wrote to Abbot Beere telling him of the coffin and the bones which had been found, and bidding him attend on the feast of St. Thomas of Canterbury, and show cause why the Glastonbury monks should claim to have the genuine relics. Beere replied, upholding the claim of his convent, and asserting that if the Canterbury monks had such relics they belonged of right to Glastonbury. In this letter he describes the veneration displayed towards St. Dunstan by the Somerset folk. The archbishop replied in peremptory terms. Abbot Beere died, on 20 January 1524, and was buried under a plain slab of marble in the south aisle of the body of his church, near the chapel of the Holy Sepulchre which he built. A letter addressed to him ('R. Bero Glasconiensi Abbati') by Erasmus, 4 September 1524, shows that he was a scholar of eminence. Writing to him about his edition of St Jerome, Erasmus expresses his agreement in the abbot's opinion of his work. He speaks of his love of learning, and of the liberality he has shown to scholars, naming his own friend, Zacharias Frisius. Construction work He was a great builder. On his return from Italy the abbot built chapels of Our Lady of Loretto and of the Holy Sepulchre in his church. John Leland tells us that he built the greater part of King Edgar's chapel at the east end of his abbey church, that he arched on both sides the east end of the nave, and made the vault of the steeple in the transept and under it two arches. Beere also built a new set of chambers, in which he entertained Henry VII on his march into the west during the rebellion of Perkin Warbeck in the autumn of 1497; these rooms were called the king's lodgings. He also added new lodgings for secular priests to the various buildings of the abbey. Almshouses for ten old women were built at the north end of the abbey.David Knowles, The Religious Orders in England vol. III (1979), p. 27. A stone in the chapel exhibits his initials, surmounted by his cognisance, a cross between two beer-jugs. His initials and cognisance were also on St. Benedict's church in Glastonbury, and his initials, surmounted by a mitre, on the Lepers' Hospital at Monkton, near Taunton; both these buildings were repaired by him. Among his various works Beere built the manor- house at Sharpham, where Fielding was born. In fiction He appears as a character in Monk and Knight (1891) by Frank W. Gunsaulus.

There are two types to distinguish; seasonal snow patches and perennial snow patches. Seasonal patches usually melt during the late summer but later than the rest of the snow. Perennial snow patches are stable for more than two years and also have a bigger influence on surroundings.Demek, J. (1987): Obecn√° geomorfologie, Academia, Praha Snow patches often start in sheltered places where both thermal and orographical conditions are favourable for the conservation of snow such as small existing depressions, gullies or other concave patterns. The main process that creates these accumulations is called nivation. It is a complex of processes that includes freeze‚Äìthaw action (weathering by the alternate freezing and melting of ice), mass movement (the downhill movement of substances under gravity), and erosion by meltwater which is the main agent of the surroundings' influence.Berrisford, M.S. (1991): Evidence for enhanced mechanical weathering associated with seasonally late- lying and perennial snow patches, Jotunheimen, Norway, Permafrost and Periglacial Processes, vol. 2 There is high soil moisture around the snow patch that supports growing of specific vegetation.

The first play, Stand Up, Nigel Barton, follows the eponymous character's journey from his childhood in a small mining community to winning a scholarship for Oxford, while the second play, Vote, Vote, Vote for Nigel Barton, sees him standing for Parliament as the Labour Party candidate in a by-election. Both plays develop themes and use dramatic devices that became hallmarks of Potter's later plays for television. Stand Up, Nigel Barton The play opens with Nigel (Keith Barron) following his father (Jack Woolgar) to work at the local colliery, questioning why his father walks in the middle of the road instead of using the pavement, and laughing at his assertion that it is an old miners' tradition. As his father rushes to clock in, Nigel muses on the very different paths their lives have taken. The scene shifts to Nigel at school, in a scene in which, as in all the school scenes in the play, the children, including Nigel, are played by adults, a technique that Potter used again in Blue Remembered Hills. Then, in a brief montage, we are carried to Nigel's arrival at Oxford in his first year. Nigel is introduced to the college scout, who embarrasses him by calling him \\"sir\\". We then return to Nigel at school, watching the class bully/clown Georgie Pringle (Johnnie Wade) being called up to the front of the class to read a passage from the Bible. He chooses a passage from the Book of Ezekiel that he and the children find amusing, but the teacher (Janet Henfrey) finds his behaviour blasphemous and canes him. She then calls Nigel, much to his embarrassment and the chagrin of the class, to read another passage. The teacher praises Nigel for the clarity of his reading, for which he earns the contempt of his peers. After school the other children, with Georgie as the ringleader, bully Nigel, leaving him upset and frustrated. The play then returns to Nigel at Oxford, where he is struggling to reconcile his working-class background with his new-found social mobility. When he returns home for the summer Nigel finds himself a figure of suspicion for some members of the community, who believe that he has betrayed his roots by taking up his university scholarship. This leaves Nigel confused and frustrated as to where his allegiance lies. Back at New College, Nigel attends a party where he meets an upper-class girl called Jill (Vickery Turner) who becomes enamoured of his unwillingness to adapt to the new social codes he encounters at university. He is also approached by a television producer who has witnessed Nigel in the debating chamber discussing class conflict and asks him to appear in a documentary on the subject. Back at school Nigel, in a fit of pique, has torn the stem of the class flower. That afternoon, as the teacher moves round the classroom looking for the culprit, Nigel breaks down. The teacher forces him to stand up and, as Georgie starts to mock him, Nigel tells the teacher that Georgie damaged the flower. The other children leap to Nigel's defence and Georgie is dragged away to the headmaster's office to receive a caning. Back in the present day Nigel's parents are visited by a journalist who informs them that he has seen a recording of Nigel's participation in the documentary, which is due to go out that evening, and wants to gauge their reactions to some of his comments. Nigel's father throws him out, angry at the journalist's insinuation that Nigel is ashamed of his roots. That evening Nigel watches the documentary with his parents. In the televised interview he tries to explain that, while he is proud of his heritage, he feels confused about where he now belongs. He describes himself being \\"between two worlds\\", much to his father's anger. The play ends with Nigel's father walking out of the house and Nigel following him. They stand in the road for a moment and decide to go to the pub together: Nigel's father tells him that he will be walking in the middle of the road. Background According to Sergio Angelini, writing for the BFI Screenonline website, \\"in some ways the most nakedly autobiographical of Dennis Potter's works\\". He said that the school sequences were inspired by his own school days, particularly the experience of being bullied for his perceived cleverness and the incident of the class pot plant. Potter himself grew up in a small mining community, where his father worked down the pit, and drew upon his own journey from the Forest of Dean to Oxford. The idea of basing the play around Barton's television interview was inspired by Potter's own contribution in 1958 to the Labour politician Christopher Mayhew's BBC series Does Class Matter? According to Potter, contrary to the way it is treated in the play, the interview helped family relations. Does Class Matter?, however, was previewed in Reynold's News with the headline \\"Miner's Son at Oxford Felt Ashamed of Home\\". Barry Norman, in a review for the Daily Mail on 13 December 1965, said that it was one of the best plays the BBC had broadcast that year. He wrote that should the second Barton play live up to expectations, it would place Potter \\"in the forefront of TV playwrights\\".Cook Dennis Potter: A Screen Life, p. 32, 321 n.26 Vote, Vote, Vote for Nigel Barton After the Conservative MP for West Barset is killed in a hunting accident Nigel Barton is persuaded to stand again for Parliament as the Labour candidate in the upcoming by-election, much to the disapproval of his wife, Ann (Valerie Gearon). Even though he was defeated in the same constituency in the general election the year before, Nigel is enthusiastic about the prospect of a political career and consults his former agent, Jack Hay (John Bailey), on launching the campaign. Jack arranges for Nigel to make several public speaking engagements, which terminate in a disastrous meeting at the local Women's Institute. Jack feels (and tells the audience, direct to camera) that Nigel is too earnest in his approach to politics and must learn to compromise. Nigel resists Jack's attempts to transform him into \\"a dutiful party hack\\", believing that success will depend on issues rather than personality. As Nigel's profile grows, he finds himself being moulded to fit Jack's agenda. After a party debate at the town hall, Ann chastises him for his \\"cynical\\" performance, commenting that his idealism and conviction are being overwhelmed by Jack's influence. Nigel begins to have second thoughts about his suitability for public office, but Jack insists that Nigel is behaving in a manner that would be expected of any candidate. When the two men go canvassing for votes the next day, Nigel's frustrations are compounded further by the wave of apathy he is greeted with. That evening Nigel addresses a Labour Party meeting and discusses his concerns about the campaign. Conflict immediately ensues between Nigel's image-based brand of politics and the old socialist values of the committee. Jack is castigated for making Nigel \\"apologetic\\" about his left-wing ideals, Nigel is accused of masking his real views, and the meeting ends with all assembled singing \\"The Red Flag\\", though it becomes clear that Nigel does not know the words. His confidence severely shaken, Nigel embarks on further canvassing, this time of bed-ridden old people. He becomes distressed by the plight of one old man, who repeatedly pleads for his amputated leg to be replaced. Nigel and Jack leave to get ready for a dinner being held by the Lord Mayor where both candidates will make their final public appearances before the by-election. At the dinner Nigel listens to the address by his Conservative opponent, Sir Hugh Archibald-Lake (Cyril Luckham), with silent disdain. In his own speech he begins to attack the \\"empty platitudes\\" of all three major parties, much to the disgust of the other dinner guests, who attempt to silence him by banging on the table. Nigel makes a 'V' sign at one of the guests, but the gesture is caught on camera by a newspaper photographer in a picture published the next day. In Jack's office on the eve of the election Nigel receives a ticking off from his agent. Jack storms out, angry at what he sees as Nigel's naivety. Alone in the office, Nigel turns to address the camera, reminds the viewers that it's polling day tomorrow and that, in the end, the political trickery they have seen is their fault, and asks them for their votes. Background Potter stood as the Labour candidate for Hertfordshire East, a safe Conservative seat, in the general election of 1964, against the incumbent Derek Walker-Smith. He later claimed that by the end of the campaign he was so disillusioned with party politics that he did not even vote for himself. His candidacy was unsuccessful. Potter drew on his experiences canvassing support in Vote, Vote, Vote for Nigel Barton. The character of Jack Hay was inspired by Potter's own political agent, Ron Brewer.

The house was acquired and restored by the Institute of Puerto Rican Culture and now operates as the Museo de la Arquitectura Ponce√±a (Museum of Ponce Architecture). The house sits in the Ponce Historic Zone. The Villaronga Residence is an outstanding example of the Classical Revival style in used in Ponce designs in the early part of the 20th century and is one of two residences still standing of a series of houses designed and built by Alfredo B. Wiechers, so important to the architectural and cultural heritage of the city of Ponce. and ' Significance The Wiechers-Villaronga Residence was built in 1912 by Alfredo B. Wiechers, architect, for his own residence and studio, which he sold later to Mr. Julio Mercado, who in turn give it to his daughter, Elena Mercado and her husband Mr. Gabriel Villaronga as a wedding present. Wiechers was born in Ponce and studied at the School of Architecture in Paris, France, in 1901, where he was bestowed a gold medal for outstanding achievement and excellence during his professional studies. He graduated in 1905 and worked at the office of Enric Sagnier, a famous Spanish architect, in Barcelona, Spain. In 1911, he decided to work and live in Ponce; thus he designed and built his house and studio which he opened in 1912. In a short period of time, from 1911 to 1918, Wiechers was commissioned with various important buildings such as: the Loggia Aurora, Club Deportivo de Damas, the Havana Theatre, Banco of Ponce Building, and Santo Asilo de Damas Hospital among others, where he fully expressed the European Neo-Classical style which he learned from, and was influenced by, Enric Sagnier. The Neo-Classical influence is manifested in most of his buildings and particularly in the Villaronga residence for its richness and highly decorative details (pilasters, rusticated podium, cornices, \\"candelabra\\", relief and motifs, Ionic capitols, etc. are some of the decorative details of the Neo-Classical trend). The Villaronga Residence is an outstanding example of this style and is one of two residences still standing of a series of houses designed and built by Wiechers, so important to the architectural and cultural heritage of the city of Ponce. Of special importance is the fact that all the furniture is original, including the bathroom appliances. Most of the furniture belongs to the Modernisme style (Catalan Art Nouveau) and were imported from Barcelona, Spain. The hanging tapestry were painted by Librado Net.La Casa de la Calle Reina. Revista \\"Hola Puerto Rico\\" (magazine). Page 10. Retrieved November 15, 2010. History The structure was designed in 1911 by its original owner, the local Ponce architect Alfredo Wiechers. It was built in the same year by El√≠as Concepci√≥n Albizu. In 1918, the house was acquired by the Villaronga Mercado family.Built in 1911 The house was listed on the U.S. National Register of Historic Places in 1984 as Villaronga House. Architecture The structure is considered \\"treasure trove of culture\\",Treasure trove of culture a jewel amongst the many antique Ponce mansions that have been preserved and converted into museums. The building possesses elaborate neoclassical details, a majestic roof-top gazebo, and a full set of original and custom-made Catalan modernist furniture. There are also well-preserved shower and bathroom fixtures.Architecture Physical appearance The Wiechers-Villaronga Residence is a \\"U\\" shaped, one-storied structure, measuring 68'-10\\" in width by 95'-2\\" in length, located at the northeast corner of Reina and Mendez Vigo Streets. Behind all its highly elaborated decoration, with European Baroque influence, essentially the structure is Neo-Classic in style, making a unique and yet elegant combination of both styles. The building rests on a rusticated stone podium; its facades and main walls are of brick masonry with some interior partitions and walls of the gallery and kitchen in wood. Wooden beams supports a galvanized zinc roof. The windows and doors of the building are wooden with movable louvers and fixed colored glass inlets. A variety of flooring material is used throughout the house: from native cement-colored tiles in the dining area and vestibule, 1\\" by 6\\" tongue-and-groove wood slats in the living area and bedrooms, and ceramic tiles in the bathroom, to marble tiles at the entry-way. The Baroque's influence is manifested immediately on the building's rounded corners, typical of these residence types in Ponce. The corner is framed by two rusticated pilasters and divided into three bays, by two pilaster strips or lesenes. Each bay contains a wooden movable louvreed window with glass inlets at its top, and a floral relief motif over the fenestration. The rest of the wall is decorated with floral garlands. The corner is accentuated with a round sitting nook or \\"glorieta\\", that is detailed with Ionic columns. Another interesting feature of the house are the balconies which are divided into three sections with Ionic columns and framed with Baroque moldings and sculptured faces on the central top part of the openings. The forged-iron railings of the balconies are elaborated after the Art Nouveau style. The facades are crowned with a continuous masonry cornice. On top of this cornice, a battlement-type parapet with sculptured lion faces and \\"candelabra\\" decorates the roof line of the structure. The main entrance is off-centred and located on Reina Street. The entrance hall is decorated with sculptured tiles and the door is located at the end of a marbled stairway. The interior is well kept and unaltered. The interior areas are painted in different colors and the walls have a decorative plastered Art- Nouveau frieze. The ceiling in most of the areas is decorated embossed tin with a continuous decorative molding at its corners. The gallery and part of the kitchen walls are wooden with fixed wood louvered windows used for better ventilation and light. Other interesting details on the house are: the bathroom fixtures, such as the shower stall and the ceramic wall tiles which were imported from Barcelona, Spain, the light fixtures‚Äîsuch as the ones at the dining-room, the master bedroom and living room‚Äîwhich were also imported from Spain, and a \\"medio punto\\" at the dining area, typical of the architecture of this Southern area of Puerto Rico. Owner Alfredo Wiechers Pieretti himself designed the house. He was the son of a German colonist and his Corsican wife. He was born in Ponce and educated at the Paris' L'Ecole Sp√©ciale d'Architecture. He lived for six years in Barcelona while working at Enric Sagnier i Villavecchia's distinguished studio.Designer trained in France After leaving his architectural mark on the City of Ponce (Casa Serralles 1911, Casa Oppenheimer 1913) he sold the house to the Villaronga family and fled in 1919 to Barcelona, under political pressure. Although his prolific works (1911‚Äì1918) include hotels, stores, mausoleums, and even factories, the majority of his work was done in Ponce‚Äîhe ventured out of Ponce only to design two structures for wealthy Catalan families in the neighboring mountain towns of Adjuntas and Aibonito.Did all his designs for Ponce families The house was purchased by Don Julio Mercado, father of Helena Mercado, and given to Helena Mercado as a wedding present upon marriage to Mr. Villaronga. Fact by Luis R. Mercado, Great Grandchild of Julio Mercado. Restoration The house was restored by the Institute of Puerto Rican Culture (ICP) in the early 1990s and is now opened as the Museum of Puerto Rican Architecture. Its furnishings - all original - speak to the social history in the city during the early twentieth century. The various rooms of the residence display aspects of Ponce's architecture.Restored by the ICP Museum The museum opened in 1996 as the home of the Ponce Architecture and Urban Planning Museum.

History It was founded in 1983 by Alessandro Zanni (executive producer) and Stefano Cundari (art producer). Since the very beginning, Memory Records took special care for the instrumental synthesizer productions, launching artists such as Hipnosis, Koto and Cyber People. Besides these, the main label artists were J.D. Jaber, Mike Cannon, Duke Lake, Baby's Gang, Ken Laszlo, Alan Ross, Brian Ice, Roy, and Swan. Aside from having a main studio in Italy, Memory Records had branches in Spain and Germany. Digital Records was a sub-label of Memory from 1985 until 1988. It was formerly branded as Plexi-Glass Productions for a short time from 1985 to 1986. Partnership with ZYX Records ZYX Records became a partner since the first releases, licensing almost the entire catalogue for the German market. By 1984, the company of Bernhard Mikulski even started to use the Memory Records logos and similar catalogue matrix. Popularity loss and closure After 4 years, the beginning of the end arrived in 1987, when Italo disco was fading out in Europe and its business suffered drastic decline due to the increasingly strong popularity of house music. The label, like many others, then tried to survive changing its style towards house and Eurobeat with discrete results. In 1989, Memory closed shop in 1989. Zanni and Cundari went on to form MCE Records to produce techno house music, but ceased its operations after Cundari's death in 1993. Its back catalogs are currently owned by ZYX Music.

He was particularly known for his portraits and his depictions of historical and Biblical scenes. Life and career Kaniewski was born in Krasi≈Ç√≥w, Krasyliv in Podolia, Ukraine. He was educated in the Liceum Krzemienieckie in Krzemieniec, where he received his first lessons in drawing and painting from J√≥zef Pitschmann. Between 1827 and 1833 he studied in the Imperial Academy of Arts in St. Petersburg. After graduating with the title \\"free artist\\" (), he traveled to Rome thanks to a government grant, arriving in November 1833, via Dresden, Vienna, Bologna and Florence. In Rome he found fame, thanks to his portrait of Pope Gregory XVI, commissioned by Tsar Nicholas I, for which he was awarded the Order of the Golden Spur and was elected a member of the Accademia Virtuosi of the Pantheon. While in Rome he also painted Gaetano Moroni. In the years 1842‚Äì1846 he was back in St. Petersburg, where in 1845, for his work Portrait of Field-Marshal Iwan Paskiewicz he received the title of Academician.

These included expeditions led by Chris Bonington to Annapurna's South Face in 1970 and an unsuccessful attempt on Mount Everest's south-west face in 1972. Burke was part of Bonington's 1975 Everest expedition, again to climb the south-west face. Burke's role was primarily as a climber, but he also provided high altitude film coverage for the BBC film crew accompanying the expedition. Following Dougal Haston and Doug Scott's first ascent of the face and successful climb to the summit, Burke was part of a second summit push, from which he did not return. He was last seen alive \\"heading upwards, a few hundred metres from the summit\\", but it is not known for sure that he reached the highest point. The weather began to deteriorate rapidly just after he was last seen, and within hours storms had set in which lasted for two days, precluding any rescue attempt by his companions who were themselves marooned in the top camp until the storms abated.

Biography Charles Melcher was born on January 19, 1965, and raised in New York City, where he attended the Ethical Culture Fieldston School. He graduated from Yale University with a BA in 1988. Charles is the Founder and CEO of Melcher Media, an award-winning app developer, book producer, and branded content company. Melcher Media's most recent success is the book \\"S.\\" by J.J. Abrams and Doug Dorst. The book is a New York Times bestseller and has been called \\"a profound and tremendous work or art\\" as well as \\"an elaborate love poem to the printed word.\\" Another recent success was the iPad and iPhone app, \\"Our Choice,\\" by Al Gore. The app was a #1 best-seller on the iTunes Store and won Apple's prestigious award for best designed app of 2011. Other recent projects include \\"Imagine, Design, Create,\\" about the future of design produced for Autodesk and Timothy Ferris's \\"Four Hour Chef\\" published by Amazon for the Kindle Fire and other Android tablets. Melcher Media Charles Melcher initially became interested in publishing when, as a college student at Yale, he created a photography magazine. After graduating in 1988, he launched Melcher Press, Inc., and spent two years creating custom print materials for schools such as Dartmouth, Wesleyan, and Yale, before becoming publisher at Callaway Editions, where he oversaw the creation of titles such as Madonna's \\"SEX,\\" David Kirk's \\"Miss Spider's Tea Party,\\" and Irving Penn's life work, \\"Passage.\\" In 1994, he relaunched his company as Melcher Media Inc., and one of its first jobs was to create a publishing imprint for MTV. Over the past sixteen years, Melcher has focused on helping international brands (such as Harley-Davidson, Lexus, Gap, Nike, and General Electric), media companies (Such as Cond√© Nast, Time Warner, NBC, and HBO), and individual authors (such as former Vice President Al Gore, the rapper Eminem, and \\"cradle to cradle\\" gurus William McDonough and Michael Braungart) to tell their stories and connect with large audiences. Melcher Media has over 12.5 million books in print, including 20 New York Times bestsellers, and in 2004, received a patent for the innovative waterproof DuraBook format. Future of StoryTelling Melcher is the founder of The Future of StoryTelling (FoST) summit, an exclusive gathering of highly influential people that are shaping the way that technology is revolutionizing human communications. Organized around a series of intimate, high-level discussions with inspiring speakers, as well as immersive experiences, this participatory summit will expose top-tier individuals and corporations to the new ideas and technologies that are driving the storytelling renaissance in the digital age. DuraBooks In August 2004, Melcher received a United States patent for the process of making waterproof books, called DuraBooks. DuraBooks are waterproof, tear-resistant, and virtually indestructible, and they are also up-cycleable, meaning their materials can be recycled in perpetuity‚Äîas opposed to regular paper, which can be recycled only a couple of times before the fibers wear out.Reid, Calvin. ‚ÄúMelcher media Gets Book Patent.‚Äù PW.com. 1 Nov. 2004. Web. http://www.publishersweekly.com/article/CA476259.html?pubdate=11%2F1%2F2004&display;=archive The idea behind DuraBooks came to Melcher when he saw an article about women who enjoy reading in the bathtub. Together with his former production director, Andrea Hirsh, he settled on a synthetic variant of paper that consists of polypropylene and inorganic fillers rather than wood fibers, as well as a waterproof binding sewn with special thread and adhered with special non-toxic glue. The first book in the DuraBook format was Aqua Erotica, a racy collection of original fiction published by a division of Random House in 2000, while Melcher‚Äôs patent was still pending. Several titles have followed, including Cradle to Cradle, the bestselling book that uses the DuraBook format because of its positive environmental impact, and The Beach Book, an anthology of contemporary literary fiction set on beaches around the globe.Koerner, Brendan I. \\"Keeping Dostoyevsky Safe From The Surf.\\" New York Times 7 Aug. 2005, Business sec.

It was intended to remove stereotypes of Muslim women by having Muslims engage in dialogue about breast cancer awareness, joining walks in groups while wearing pink headscarves, and holding other events promoting awareness and support for the cause. Global Pink Hijab Day was last celebrated in 2011 Global Pink Hijab Day was a global movement, with many participants including men who wear pink kufis (or skull caps) to celebrate breast cancer awareness. It took place at many Islamic schools and student organizations throughout the United States.  History  Pink Hijab Day was founded in 2004 by Hend El Buri, a high school student at the time. It began small, in a high school in Columbia, MO. A group of girls decided to wear pink hijabs one day to encourage others to ask questions about their hijabs and about Islam. After more and more people began participating, the Susan G. Komen Foundation was contacted and Pink Hijab Day was held. The girls felt that wearing pink might lessen the tension of how people view Muslim girls wearing the Hijab, or headscarf. The creators of this event hoped that Pink Hijab Day would encourage people who are curious about women in Islam and hijab to ask questions to dispel misconceptions. They also promoted taking preventative action against Breast Cancer and to donate to various Breast Cancer Foundations to find a cure.  Previous Dates  * Wednesday, October 29, 2008 * Wednesday, October 28, 2009 * Wednesday, October 27, 2010 * Wednesday, October 26, 2011  Purpose  The purpose of Pink Hijab Day was threefold: Hijab ‚Äì To encourage those who are curious about Muslim women and about hijab to ask Muslim women about what their hijab means Society ‚Äì To encourage Muslim women to participate in various community improvement projects because we are a valuable part of the fabric of the societies we live in. One of these projects is the effort to find a cure for breast cancer Health ‚Äì To raise funds for cancer research, and to encourage all people to maintain their health by getting regular screenings and to increase knowledge about preventative methods.  Observance  Although it started in small college town Columbia, Missouri, Pink Hijab Day grew to be a worldwide day supporting and raising funds and awareness for breast cancer. Pink Hijab Day events are held in countries like Australia, Bulgaria, Canada, and South Africa, as well as States across America. Inspired by the Pink Hijab Day movement the Muslim Southern Belle Charities Incorporated began participating in 2007. Muslim Southern Belle Charities relocated from Lexington, KY to Houston, TX in 2015 and held their first Pink Hijab Day event at Al-Ansaar Masjid in the Woodlands, TX in 2016. The event encouraged to wear a pink hijab and encouraged those in attendance to make a donation to Assalam Clinic at the Al- Salaam mosque. To help pay for female medical screenings. Entertainment consisted of the Muslim Southern Belle version of the Hijabi Monologues; to instill women empowerment through storytelling. We all have lived through similar experiences. The Monologues allow for many to start a dialogue when they had felt in the past their voices would not be heard. And a hijab swap to benefit the Muslim Southern Belle Charities Incorporated Revert Closet; a project to benefit new Muslim reverts find the items they need to pray, visit the masjid and have a more modest wardrobe.

Character design and artwork are by Alecos Papadatos and color is by Annie Di Donna. The book was originally written in English, and was translated into Greek by author Apostolos Doxiadis for the release in Greece, which preceded the UK and U.S. releases. Plot Set between the late 19th century and the present day, the graphic novel Logicomix is based on the story of the so-called \\"foundational quest\\" in mathematics. Logicomix intertwines the philosophical struggles with the characters' own personal turmoil. These are in turn played out just upstage of the momentous historical events of the era and the ideological battles which gave rise to them. The narrator of the story is Bertrand Russell, who stands as an icon of many of these themes: a deeply sensitive and introspective man, Russell was not just a philosopher and pacifist, he was also one of the prominent figures in the foundational quest. Russell's life story, depicted by Logicomix, is itself a journey through the goals and struggles, and triumph and tragedy shared by many great thinkers of the 20th century: Georg Cantor, Ludwig Wittgenstein, G.

He was born in the Southwark area of London. He has a tomb in Southwark Cathedral. Life and work Little reliable information exists about Lockyer's life and work. Contemporary sources primarily consist of promotional material written by Lockyer and his supporters and also of a far less flattering account given by George Starkey, an Alchemist and rival pill maker. One advertising broadsheet, published after Lockyer's death, describes him as an \\"authoriz'd physician and chymist\\" with \\"at least Forty Years Experience and Practice, both in England and most Foreign Parts\\". It describes him as having lived in St Thomas's Southwark prior to his death. Starkey provides an unflattering account of Lockyer's early career: Lockyer was a tailor and a butcher before turning to medicine, that he was a poor student, and that his first \\"invented\\" medicinal concoction was to add colouring to an existing common medicine. It is claimed that he also worked on making the philosopher's stone. His medical licence required his practice be at least 8 miles outside of London. Broadsheet advertising L.Lockyer's patent medicine. Wellcome Library collections. Lockyer's Pill Lockyer's most notable product was his eponymous pill, which his advertisements describe as: > \\"those most excellent Pills called, Pillulae Radijs Solis Extracta BEING an > universall medicine especially in all chronical and difficult Distempers\\". While the name implies that they contained an extract of sunbeams, the actual composition is unknown as Lockyer kept the recipe a secret. The pills were claimed to cure all curable ailments and to work better with larger doses. Descriptions of the effect of the pills vary, however an emetic effect was often described. One claims: > \\"Sometimes it works upwards and sometimes downwards, and it may be both ways > at once, although it is never violent.\\" Lockyer had growing success selling his pills and it is claimed, in an anonymous letter of endorsement, that Lockyer had demonstrated his pills before the King at Southampton House in 1664. Lockyer also attracted the attention of rivals. George Starkey, published a tract called A smart scourge for a Silly Sawcy Fool, attacking Lockyer and casting doubt on the authenticity of the letter of endorsement. He also gives his account of Lockyer's background and mocks both his pills and the poor quality of his Latin. Death and monument Monument of Lionel Lockyer in Southwark Cathedral. Wellcome Library collections. Lockyer died on 26 April 1672. He is interred in Southwark Cathedral where he has a prominent monument in the north transept featuring a large semi-recumbent figure of himself. The epitaph reads: Following Lockyer's death, his pills continued to be sold by Lockyer's nephew, John Watts, in partnership with Thomas Fyge, an apothecary. The pills were sold wholesale in tins of 50 or 100 at a price of 4 shillings for 100.

Peterson was founder and president of numerous furniture and machine tool manufacturing companies and one of the founders of Swedish American Hospital. Background Peterson came from Ving, in the historical province of V√§sterg√∂tland, Sweden. His father was a tailor. In 1852, when Pehr was six, the Peterson family immigrated to America and Rockford, Illinois. After four years the family settled on a farm in nearby Cherry Valley, Illinois. Young Peterson worked on farms for years. Career Peterson set off on his own to work in Wisconsin in lumber camps and sawmills, as well as in Chicago as a bookkeeper. He later put himself through business college. In 1875, he moved back to Rockford and began his career in the city's growing furniture industry. By the early 1890s Rockford was the second-greatest furniture-manufacturing city in the United States (Grand Rapids, Michigan, was number one), with over two dozen companies, and P.A. directed over a quarter of them. He branched into leadership of several machine tool and other manufacturers, into banking, and in his later years even founded a department store. Rockford Union Furniture Company was organized in 1876. Pehr August Peterson was elected company secretary because he could keep books. John Erlander served as president, and his brother-in-law Jonas Peters served as treasurer-manager. Rockford Union Furniture Company was a cooperative association, with members helping to raise the initial capital for the business. It was the first of twenty-five area furniture factories that were formed as cooperatives.Rockford Small Business Collection (Rockford, Illinois Regional History Center) When the Union Furniture plant burned down in August 1889, Peterson built another factory a mile away. By 1892 seven of twenty-five Rockford furniture companies were directed by Peterson. The Panic of 1893 hit Rockford hard, resulting in the closure of twenty-seven factories in one day alone, including many Swedish-American furniture factories. P.A. himself went broke trying to keep his many interests afloat but turned down advice to declare bankruptcy. Instead, the former multicompany president worked at sales for a furniture firm just to keep steady income rolling in. By 1896 P.A. had repaid so much of his debt that the old creditors started to return businesses to his leadership and ownership. From this point P.A.'s trajectory upward was virtually uninterrupted, and he became the most important figure in Rockford's industrial, commercial, and civic development for the next 31 years. Altogether, P.A. would come to own stock in fifty Rockford-based companies. He was one of the founders of the Swedish Building and Loan Association. Peterson served as president of Sundstrand Corporation. His diverse interests included Rockford Drop Forge, Rockford Class Bending Works, Rockford Life Insurance, Rockford Mitre Box, Mechanics' Machine, Haddorff Piano, Mechanics Tool, National Lock and Free Sewing Machine.P. A. Peterson: Immigrant Industrialist (Anna E. Carlson Heritage School. Illinois History/December 1996) In 1911, in response to a great need for more healthcare services, Rockford's Swedish-American community, under the leadership of P.A. Peterson, decided to build a new hospital on the East Side. (Most of Rockford's Swedes, including Peterson, were Lutherans who lived on the East Side, which had only the Roman Catholic St. Anthony's Hospital.) Peterson was the chairman of the board of trustees of Swedish American Hospital when it finally opened its doors on July 17, 1918 (construction had been slowed by the Great War), and served in this capacity until June 23, 1919.SwedishAmerican's history (SwedishAmerican Health System) Personal life P.A. and his wife, Ida, had no children of their own, but they adopted two girls. For years they lived at 1219 Seventh Street. P.A. never drove a car, so this location was ideal for walking: halfway between the heart of Rockford's Swedish-American commercial center, farther north up Seventh Street, and the east-west line of factories (and railroad tracks) stretching across the south end of the East Side, fronting along 18th Ave. In 1918 Peterson purchased the Lake-Peterson House, as it is now known, as a private residence. This was at the time that P.A. was chairman of the new Swedish- American Hospital on Charles Street, and the house was directly north at 1313 E. State St. Peterson donated the Lake-Peterson House to Swedish-American Hospital in 1919, provided he and his wife be allowed to remain in it until they died.Pehr A. Peterson (Lake Peterson Home) The somewhat oddly Gothic- tinged Victorian structure, on Rockford's main east-west street (State St. is U.S. 20, running from Chicago out to Dubuque, Iowa), is today used for hospital executive offices and is on the National Register of Historic Places. Peterson was a deeply religious member of Trinity Lutheran Church, one of several Rockford churches belonging to the Evangelical Lutheran Augustana Synod in North America (the Augustana Synod was the main Swedish-American denomination in America). He was a contributor to other churches, as well, and the Anti-Saloon League. He was reputedly very generous not only with his peers (even competitors) among Rockford's business leadership but also with his companies' workers, often cosigning loans for them and giving personal checks to their widows. Long before Peterson died in 1927 at age 80, he'd had an elementary school named after him. P.A. Peterson School stood on 21st Ave. between 8th and 9th Sts., a few blocks south of his old house on 7th St. and not far beyond the factories fronting on 18th Ave. On the day of Mr. Peterson's funeral, many Rockford commercial and industrial firms stayed closed in honor of Rockford's first citizen. Peterson bequeathed one-half million dollars to \\"build a home for the Swedish aged of Rockford.\\" The P.A. Peterson Home for the Aged finally opened in 1941 in a beautiful building at 1311 Parkview Avenue, on what was then the city's northeast edge, overlooking Sinnissippi Golf Course. (The home, not restricted to Swedish Americans, is now called the P.A. Peterson Center for Health and is a program of Lutheran Social Services of Illinois) In his will P.A. also gave another one-half million dollars to the Foreign Mission Board of the Augustana Synod and a like sum to establish a Rockford branch of the Young Men's Christian Association.About P.A.

Bramblett murdered each family member in their residence before setting it on fire, and in 1997 was sentenced to death for the murders. Bramblett was executed by electric chair on April 9, 2003.Bramblett v. Commonwealth of Virginia  Murders  At around 4:30 a.m. on August 29, 1994, a passerby reported a fire at the Hodges residence in Vinton, Virginia. Firefighters and police found fire burning throughout the house. Gaining entry, authorities found 37-year-old Teresa Lynn Hodges' body on a couch, still burning ‚Äî she had been strangled and doused with diesel fuel. On the second floor, they discovered William Blaine Hodges (aged 41) dead on a bed next to a .22 caliber gun with the barrel removed, shot through his left temple, but not burned. In a second bed they found daughters Winter (aged 11) and Anah (aged 3); both had been shot at close range, and Anah had sustained mild burns. Further inspection of the Hodges house revealed purposefully-disconnected telephone lines and the presence of a petroleum- based accelerant in several areas. Having found Blaine Hodges' body next to a gun, police at first theorized that Blaine had killed his family and then himself; Blaine, a former U.S. Postal Service employee, was about to serve six months in federal prison for embezzlement. Further investigation determined that the barrel of the murder weapon had been removed after Blaine had been killed, and that Blaine had been killed before the rest of his family.  Investigation  Earl Bramblett, from Spartanburg, South Carolina, was a close friend of the Hodges family. Police requested an interview with Bramblett, during which they told him the family had died in a fire, without mentioning the evidence of violence. Bramblett displayed anger and stated that the \\"son of a bitch offed his family and killed himself\\", which indicated prior knowledge and immediately made him a prime suspect. Soon police gathered additional incriminating evidence against Bramblett. A witness had seen a vehicle similar to Bramblett's driving past the Hodges home during the fire, without stopping. Drawings of stick figures with arrows that corresponded to the Hodges' bullet wounds were found at Bramblett's place of employment. Bramblett's sister provided police with a box he had left with her, which contained several audiotapes on which he spoke of his sexual attraction to 11-year-old Winter Hodges, and of his belief that the family, including Winter, was conspiring to set him up for child molestation charges. A DNA test on a pubic hair found in the bedroom where the girls were found was matched to Bramblett. A pair of jeans were found soaking at his place of employment, discovered by another employee after noticing water leaking through the door, and were determined to contain stains of the same flammable liquid used to start the fire at the Hodges's home. The bullets used to kill the victims were determined to be of the same composition as bullets found in a vehicle belonging to Bramblett. It was discovered that Bramblett punched his time card at work 20 minutes after the fire was started (the drive time from the Hodges home to his job was 20 minutes) and, after realizing his error, attempted to black out the entry on his time-card. In addition, two women testified that, in the 1970s, Bramblett had given them alcohol and molested them when they were eleven and fourteen years old.  Arrest and conviction  Bramblett was tried, convicted, and sentenced to death on December 16, 1997, after the jury deliberated for one hour.  Execution  After a clemency petition to Governor of Virginia Mark Warner was rejected, along with an appeal to the U.S. Supreme Court, Earl Bramblett was executed in the electric chair for the murder of the Hodges family at Greensville Correctional Center, Jarratt, Virginia, on April 9, 2003. He was sixty-one years old at the time of his death, choosing the electric chair over lethal injection as a form of protest. His final words were, \\"I didn't murder the Hodges family. I've never murdered anybody. I'm going to my death with a clear conscience. I am going to my death having had a great life because of my two great sons, Mike and Doug.\\" His body was cremated after the electrocution.https://www.findagrave.com/cgi- bin/fg.cgi?page=gr&GSln;=+Bramblett&GSfn;=Earl&GSbyrel;=all&GSdy;=2003&GSdyrel;=in&GSob;=n&GRid;=154105697&df;=all&  Disappearances of Tammy Akers and Angela Rader  Bramblett was a suspect in the 1977 disappearances of Tammy Akers and Angela Rader, who were both 14 years old and worked for him at the time. Bramblett reportedly told friends that he wished he had not \\"hurt Tammy\\" three years after she went missing, though he was never charged in either Akers's or Rader's disappearances and their whereabouts are still unknown.

Established in 1789, it was located at 22‚Äì23 Argyll Arcade. The firm manufactured a range of boats and sailing yachts, but were probably best known for their 0 scale model railway stock and accessories. They initially made only nautical models for the Admiralty, but by the late 19th century had expanded their business to commercial toy steam engines and railway locomotives. These were largely bought from English and French manufacturers, although the company rarely admitted to the fact. By the first years of the twentieth century the company could be ranked alongside Gamages of London in its retailing of mechanical metal toys, particularly shipping and rail related, and it issued a substantial range of seasonal catalogues. While most products offered in these were standard items by the great German makers such as Carette, Schoenner and M√§rklin, Clyde did commission bespoke products from the famous N√ºrnberg maker Gebr√ºder Bing, alongside others by a number of lesser-known Birmingham makers, such as Carson, mainly in gauge III (2.5 inches). There is no evidence of the company building any of its own railway products, but they did super-detail items in a workshop based in a converted drawing-room flat in Argyll Street. On the other hand, this workshop did manufacture wooden-hulled model boats to various levels. After the Great War, the company became a major agent for Hornby 0 gauge trains and also took an interest in a range of toy locomotives made by Bar Knight of Glasgow. It continued to retail German products and even some American-made items. Although it is the inter-war period that is remembered with most fond nostalgia, it was really a shadow of the quality the company aspired to pre 1914. However, Clyde continued to be an important focal point of Scottish model-making and it was active in encouraging amateur scratch-builders in the 1930s, offering substantial trophies for competition, alongside its retailing activities ‚Äî it had always held large stocks of fittings and fixtures for model makers and this was an important part of its business. Clyde continued to be active after the Second World War in 00 gauge trains, sailing yachts, diecast cars, steam toys and model aircraft materials, for which the shop was one of three in central Glasgow from which balsa wood and related materials were available up to the 1970s; the Clyde Model Dockyard Trophy was competed for annually amongst aeromodellers. Like Gamages, the shop became a victim of changing tastes and retail patterns in the 1960s, finally closing down in the early 1970s. In honour of the nostalgic place it has in the minds of many Scots, a full-scale re-creation of its frontage was built as part of the \\"1930s Glasgow Street\\" in the Glasgow Museum of Transport when it was rebuilt at Kelvin Hall. It was again re-re-created in the new Riverside Museum on Clydeside. https://archive.is/20120804082618/http://www.eastbank.btinternet.co.uk/shops.htmhttp://www.freewebs.com/odilon/otherbritishengines.htm References External links * ToySteamBible.org: Clyde Model Dockyard Category:Buildings and structures in Glasgow Category:Toy retailers Category:Toy steam engine manufacturers Category:1789 establishments in Scotland Category:British companies established in 1789 ","title":"Clyde Model Dockyard"},{"id":"24664295","text":"Anne Lise Kjaer (born 15 March 1962 in Denmark) is a London-based futurist and keynote speaker.

It selectively blocks Acid Sensing Ion Channel 1-a (ASIC1a), which is a proton-gated sodium channel.  Sources  Psalmotoxin is a toxin produced in the venom glands of the South American tarantula Psalmopoeus cambridgei.  Chemistry  The psalmotoxin structure can be classified as an inhibitor cystine knot (ICK) protein. Many ion channel effectors from snail, spider, and scorpion venoms share a similar ICK structure, although they possess very different pharmalogical profiles. Among ICK toxins, psalmotoxin is the only peptide known to act on homomeric ASIC1 channels. Psalmotoxin is a 40-amino acid peptide, possessing 6 cysteines linked by three disulfide bridges. The three-dimensional structure consists of a compact disulfide-bonded core from which three loops and the N and C termini emerge. The main element of the structure is a three-stranded antiparallel Œ≤-sheet.  Target  Psalmopoeus cambridgei, subadult Psalmotoxin can bind to a particular isoform of the Acid Sensing Ion Channel, the Acid Sensing Ion Channel 1 (ASIC1). The binding of psalmotoxin has an effect on both of the two splice variants known of ASIC1, ASIC1a and ASIC1b. ASIC1 has two transmembrane components. After the first transmembrane component it forms a large extracellular bridge with the second transmembrane component, an extracellular loop. This extracellular loop contains cysteine rich domains. Psalmotoxin specifically binds these cysteine rich domains in the extracellular loop of ASIC1. This implicates this domain is the receptor site of ASIC1 for psalmotoxin. ASICs are proton-gated sodium channels. ASICs open when H+ binds. This occurs when the H+-concentration in the environment of the neuron is slightly higher compared to resting H+-concentrations (pH = 7.4). The expression of ASIC1a is high in both the central nervous system and in the sensory neurons of the dorsal root ganglia. ASIC1b is only expressed in sensory neurons. Expression of ASIC1a in the central nervous system relates to the involvement of ASIC1a in higher brain functions, such as learning, memory and fear conditioning. Expression of ASIC1a and ASIC1b in sensory neurons relates to their involvement in nociception and taste.  Mode of action  Binding of psalmotoxin to ASIC1a is reported to increase the affinity of ASIC1a for H+. This increase in affinity for H+ results in the shift of ASIC1a into the desensitized state at resting H+-concentrations (pH = 7.4). The channel being desensitized means that the ion channel is bound to its ligand, H+, but is not able to let ions pass through the ion channel. The underlying mechanism of how this increase in affinity for H+ accounts for a shift of the ASIC1a channels into the desensitized state is not yet specified. Psalmotoxin also interacts with ASIC1b. In contrast to psalmotoxin binding to ASIC1a, binding of psalmotoxin to ASIC1b results in promoting the opening of the channel. This agonistic effect of psalmotoxin on ASIC1b only occurs in slightly acidic conditions (pH = 7.1).  Toxicity  The role of psalmotoxin in prey capture and the importance of ASIC1a channels as targets of venom components remains unclear.  Therapeutic uses  Psalmotoxin is currently not used for therapeutic purposes, but understanding the psalmotoxin/ASIC1a interaction may be of therapeutic value. Recently, it has been shown that activation of ASIC1a during the acidosis accompanying brain ischemia leads to significant Ca2+ influx, which contributes to neuronal cell death. Inhibition of ASIC1a by psalmotoxin significantly decreased ischemic neuronal cell death. Therefore, it is suggested that desensitized ASIC1's by pharmological intervention could be beneficial for patients at risk of having a stroke. For the same reasons psalmotoxin could contribute in the search for a cure for gliomas. Inhibition of ASIC1a in the amygdala by psalmotoxin could have an anxiolytic effect. As ASIC's play a role in nociception, psalmotoxin could be helpful in designing new analgesic drugs acting directly against pain at the nociceptor level.

Life Hall was born on February 7, 1886, in Saint Paul, Minnesota, to Montgomery and Mary Hall. As a young girl, she moved with her family, including sisters Ruth and Lulie, to Portland, where her father managed the express division of the Northern Pacific Railway. After surviving scarlet fever at the age of 12, or by some accounts after being injured in a fall, she used a wheelchair for the rest of her life. Leaving public school in fifth grade because of her paralysis, Hall continued her education by reading widely at home. Favorite authors included Emily Dickinson, Robert Frost, and Edna St. Vincent Millay. She began writing at about age 9, and continued writing as a hobby through her teen years. Seeking paid work that could be done at home, she turned to professional sewing, expanding on another of her childhood interests. Stitching bridal robes, baby dresses, and gowns for wealthy families, she worked near a window from which she could watch passers- by on the street. Her writing themes often involved sewing and what she saw from her window. In her 20s, she began writing poetry. In 1916, when she was 30, her first published poem appeared in the Boston Evening Transcript, and in 1917 her poetry appeared in The Masses, a New York publication with a national circulation. Eventually she had poems accepted by The Century Magazine, Harper's Magazine, The New Republic, The Nation, Sunset, and many others. Reviewer Pearl Andelson of Poetry said this of Hall's first collection, Curtains, in 1922, \\"Comes Hazel Hall with her little book, every word and emotion of which is poignantly authentic.\\" She died on May 11, 1924, at home in Portland, \\"after an illness of some weeks\\". Legacy Hazel Hall House in Portland Hall's home, located at 106 Northwest 22nd Place in Portland, is listed on the National Register of Historic Places as the Hazel Hall House. In 1995, the Oregon Cultural Heritage Commission erected a small park next to the house. The Oregon Book Award for poetry is jointly named for Hall and fellow Oregon poet William Stafford.

It was conceived in 1988 by Titusville physician Dr. Doyle E. Chastain, who wrote a letter to the Titusville City Council suggesting such a project. With a downtown redevelopment program in progress and a desire to further enhance the area by taking advantage of the riverfront, the proposal was welcomed by the council and the city's Community Redevelopment Agency. The result was the US Space Walk of Fame Foundation. Several volunteers including space pioneers created USSWOFF with the assistance of the City of Titusville, and the use of grants. The city provided the park infrastructure; and the foundation raised funds for the monuments, plaques, mission insignia markers and other space-related items to carry out the riverwalk's space theme. Engravings sold through the foundation enable space workers or their families to honor the worker by having his or her name engraved on the appropriate monument. In July 1994, the city dedicated the new riverfront area, named Space View Park, which provides the anchor point for the US Space Walk of Fame. The Mercury Monument and mission plaques, with cast bronze hand prints of six of the original seven astronauts, were dedicated on May 12, 1995; and the Mercury mission insigniaThese insignia were designed in 1970. were unveiled on May 23, 1997.

The event kicked off a week-long 30th anniversary celebration of the launch of Apollo 11 and the first manned Moon landing. The Apollo Monument dedication and an Apollo reunion were held on July 17, 2009 with Apollo 15 astronaut Al Worden. The Gemini and Apollo monuments also include cast bronze hand prints of the surviving astronauts who flew those missions. The Space Shuttle monument was dedicated in 2014. Museum The American Space Museum, located nearby at 308 Pine Street, illustrates America's history in space exploration by displaying hundreds of artifacts, including photos, hardware, flight suits, shuttle tiles, space patches and pins, and other memorabilia from personal collections of space workers. The museum also features several launch consoles from Launch Complex 36. The museum was the U. S. Space Walk of Fame Museum until the name changed in 2016 to the American Space Museum. In 2016, the museum updated exhibits, focusing on new interpretive signage, new artifacts and interactive displays.

Background Each summer in the 1920s, a fair was organized in Gillingham Park to raise funds for the local St Bartholomew's Hospital. The traditional highlight of the event, which took place at the end of the festivities, was a demonstration of firefighting and rescue by the Gillingham Fire Brigade. Each year, a house of wood and canvas, three stories and 40 feet high, was constructed in the park as the venue for a mock wedding reception at which two firemen, costumed as a bride and groom, would be entertaining their \\"guests\\": other firemen, Royal Naval Cadets from the nearby Chatham unit of the Volunteer Cadet Corps, and sea scouts. The display would involve the simulated break out of a small fire necessitating the rescue of the occupants from the upper levels of the building. Flares and smoke bombs were used to give the illusion of the structure being ablaze, and after everybody had been \\"rescued\\" from the building, a real fire was set to enable the fire brigade to demonstrate their firefighting skills. Disaster After the mock wedding, the six men and nine boys aged between 10 and 14 were ready to enact their staged rescue when the real fire was accidentally lit; the cause of this error is unknown. Flames instantly took hold and spread the full height of the structure, trapping the occupants inside. Other firefighters were immediately aware that they were now dealing with a genuine emergency rather than a demonstration, but initially most of the spectators did not realize anything was amiss, taking the cries for help they heard to be part of the performance, and reportedly cheering and applauding what they believed to be realistic and spectacular effects until they witnessed two boys with their clothing ablaze jump to their deaths from the top of the structure.Time Magazine, July 22, 1929 The fire was extinguished within a few minutes, but had been of such intensity that 13 people died at the scene. Two victims were rescued alive, but both died of their injuries in the hospital, St Bartholomew's, for which they had been intending to raise funds, bringing the final death toll to 15. The funerals of those who died were held on 17 July; all shops in Gillingham remained closed on that day and thousands of people lined the two mile funeral route.

Founded in 1989, as one of the country's first direct to customer car insurance companies, the company has expanded to offer a range of general insurance products. Since February 2012, Churchill is part of the Direct Line Group; policies are underwritten by the parent United Kingdom Insurance Limited. Churchill is notable for its advertising that features a talking nodding dog mascot. History Churchill Insurance Company Limited was launched by founder Martin Long in June 1989, as a direct car insurance provider. Long was backed by Winterthur, at that time a Credit Suisse subsidiary. Home insurance was added to the Churchill product range a year later. In 1994, the company began to use a bulldog as its mascot. In 1995, Churchill launched its first website, and a credit card. It also became the first United Kingdom insurer to offer motor insurance estimates via interactive media kiosks. In 1996, Churchill achieved accreditation with Investors in People and ISO9002. The same year, the nodding dog was introduced to its advertising and breakdown cover was added to the product range. The dog mascot is named Winston Churchill, after the former Prime Minister of the same name. In 1997, Churchill Insurance was named in Britain‚Äôs Best Employers for the first time, the year the company relocated to its current headquarters, Churchill Court. Travel insurance and pet insurance products were introduced. In October 1999, motorcycle insurance broker Devitt Insurance was acquired. The company also launched its first e commerce facility, enabling online car and home insurance quotes. In 2000, it acquired the Churchill.com domain name for online activity, and acquired NIG in February 2000, after announcing their intentions to acquire it in December 1999. In February 2002, Churchill bought Prudential's insurance business. In June 2003, the business was purchased by the Royal Bank of Scotland Group for ¬£1.1m. This brought Churchill into RBS' insurance division alongside Direct Line ‚Äì another company Long had been involved in launching. Following the bailout of RBS by the Government of the United Kingdom in 2008, the EU demanded that certain group assets be sold off, including the insurance division. In February 2012, Churchill became part of the new Direct Line Group, which was created ahead of a divestment that was completed in February 2014. Services Churchill offers a range of general insurance products, underwritten by United Kingdom Insurance: car, home, pet and travel insurance and breakdown cover, in association with Green Flag.

Advertising Churchill dog alt= In 1994, it was decided that the company needed a mascot to represent the Churchill brand, and differentiate it from the former British Prime Minister, Winston Churchill. A staff competition led to the adoption of a bulldog, a well known symbol of British identity. The first Churchill dog was a real bulldog called Lucas. The company first used a nodding dog in 1996.About us Churchill Insurance Churchill began selling nodding dog models in 1997. In the company's television advertising, the computer animated Churchill dog was asked whether he could save people money on their insurance and he responded with his catchphrase: \\"Oh yes!\\". The catchphrase is believed to be an impersonation of Potter the Janitor (played by Deryck Guyler) from the television series of the 1970s, Please Sir!. Churchill was voiced by Bob Mortimer. Older adverts had Mortimer's voice responding to questions posed by his comedy partner Vic Reeves. In April 2005, however, Reeves was removed from the adverts, after he was convicted of drink driving.Driving ban for comic Vic Reeves BBC News In 2004, a hot air balloon of Churchill was unveiled, and was the United Kingdom‚Äôs largest special shaped hot air balloon, measuring 34 metres wide by 24 metres high. Mortimer continued to provide the voice for the dog until at least January 2009. The balloon appears at numerous events across the country, notably the Bristol International Balloon Fiesta and the London Marathon. In 2006, a high profile \\"Challenge Churchill\\" campaign was launched, involving the people of Britain challenging the brand mascot to find them cheaper car and home insurance. In 2009, the company adopted a new strapline: \\"Count on Churchill\\". Television adverts were launched featuring the Churchill dog, alongside celebrities including Melanie Sykes and Roy Walker. In recent years, talking soft toys have been added to the range of Churchill merchandise,Buy a Churchill dog Churchill Dog Shop and the character has a page on social networking site Facebook. Walker began starring in the adverts in January 2009. During 2009, Churchill starred in twenty two pantomimes around the United Kingdom.Churchill in panto Churchill In August 2010, he made appearances at Pontins holiday camps, before returning for his second pantomime run. Martin Clunes featured in Churchill's television campaigns until November 2012, when he was removed after being banned from driving. Clunes was replaced by Dawn French in the firm's television adverts in February 2013. An advert, in May 2013, featured Churchill riding on a kids' ride, with Gary Numan's song \\"Cars\\" playing in the background. Churchill was once again redesigned in October 2019, where his long serving nodding dog design was changed, to a new, CGI version. Controversy In January 2012, Churchill, along with sister company Direct Line, was fined ¬£2.17m by the FSA after being found guilty of altering complaints files. In February 2013, Churchill received media attention after it appealed a High Court judgement in the case of Bethany Probert, who, in 2009 when she was 13 years old, was hit by a car driven by one of the insurer's customers whilst walking along a country lane.

It did not fly until 1924 and only one was built. Design and development The Lat√©co√®re 5 was a revision of the second Lat√©co√®re 4 as a night bomber for the BN4 programme, which called for a 1,500 kg (3,300 lb) bomb load. The construction and general appearance of the two types was similar, both having fabric covered wings of wooden construction, three engines and a metal framed fuselage. The wings and tail of the Lat√©co√®re 4 and 5 appeared almost identical, using the single outer interplane strut of the Lat√©co√®re 4's early arrangement. In fact the bomber had a span 2 m (6 ft 7 in) greater and larger wing area. The fuselage behind the wing leading edge was again similar; as far as is known the defensive armament intended for the bomber was never fitted, and it had three windows on each side, though not the continuous line of sliding openings seen on the transport. The main differences were in the pilot's cockpit and those that followed from a different choice of engine. The fuselage was significantly longer (3.3 m or 10 ft 10 in) partly because of the decision to seat pilot and co-pilot side by side and further forward, clear of the wing leading edge. From there, forward to the nose the top of the fuselage was now horizontal, rather than falling away downwards as on the civil aircraft. This change, giving a poorer forward view resulted from fitting the longer inline Lorraine 12 Ds in the bomber rather than the short Salmson radials of the Lat√©co√®re 4. A rectangular radiator immediately behind the two- bladed propeller provided cooling, replacing the external radiators of the transport. There was a serious dispute between the State and Lat√©co√®re about the engine choice; briefly, the former wished all BN4 machines to use more powerful Renault engines but failed to have them available, whereas Lat√©co√®re preferred the Lorraines on the grounds of a better power-to-weight ratio. The outer engines of the bomber were similarly mounted to those of the Lat√©co√®re 4 with bracing to the wing roots and fuselage, but in deeper and flatter sided cowlings which extended downward almost to the wing. These outer engines had similar rectangular radiators and propellers to that of the central one. Though the design was registered in January 1921, the first flight did not take place until 18 February 1924, four years after the Lat√©co√®re 4, partly because of the engine disputes. It was flown by Achille Enderlin and Vilet. It was taken to Villacoublay for official testing in the late summer of 1924; its fate thereafter is not known. No more Lat√©co√®re 5s were built; though the company considered equipping it as a transport, nothing was done. Numbering The first time the aircraft was officially referred to as the Lat√©co√®re 5 was in the documentation of the completion of contract in 1925. Before that it was normally termed the \\"Lat√©co√®re 4 (ou IV) BN4\\", though the initial contract referred to the Lat√©co√®re V.

Chase was named after Abraham Lincoln's Secretary of the Treasury, Salmon Portland Chase. It was a three-masted bark with a hull length of 106 feet that was designed for use as a training ship for the cadets of the Revenue Cutter Service School of Instruction.Evans, p. 95 Shortly after the creation of the Revenue Cutter School of Instruction, Captain J. H. Merryman, the Revenue Cutter Service's Superintendent of Construction, began work on the design for a school ship to replace . Chase went into service in the summer of 1878, with its homeport at New Bedford, Massachusetts. She made cadet cruises to Europe, the Azores, the West Indies, and along the eastern coast of the United States. When in New Bedford, she tied up just above the bridge at the north end of Fish Island, Massachusetts. Here she served as a berthing area for the cadets. The government leased buildings on the north end of the island and used the nearby Mitchell Boat Company buildings for classes, drills, and storage. Most classes, however, were held aboard the Chase which had accommodations for a dozen cadets. In the late nineteenth century the service briefly enjoyed a surplus of officer candidates, largely because the United States Naval Academy at Annapolis, Maryland was graduating more officers than the U.S. Navy could employ. In 1890 Chase was taken out of commission, and for the next four years the Revenue Cutter Service filled the ranks of its officer corps with Annapolis graduates. The 1890s, however, saw an expansion of the Navy, and in 1895 an Act of Congress provided for the retirement of numerous Revenue Cutter Service officers who were too ill or too old to perform their duties. The result was a shortage of junior officers, and a new lease on life for the service's training bark. Chase was taken into dry dock, cut in half, and lengthened by 40 feet; the new hull section made room for a total of 25 cadets.Evans, p 155 The alterations also seem to have affected Chase's sailing qualities. Virtually every photograph taken after the rebuilding shows staysails set on the mizzen stays but none on the main. In its new configuration Chase remained in service for two more decades, continuing to make practice cruises to Europe, including the port of Cadiz, Spain, in 1904, as well as the east coast ports of the United States. Her last official function was a visit to Hampton Roads, Virginia, for the Jamestown Tricentennial celebration of 1907. Her crew then transferred to USRC Itasca and Chase was given to the U. S. Marine Hospital Service where she saw service as a quarantine vessel. At the end of her government career she was refitted and reclassified as a detention barge.

It was founded by the Dominican sisters in 1934. Today it operates from one site in Colindale, Barnet in North London, England. The current headteacher is Mrs. Carolyn Laws (since January 2017). History The Dominican Sisters of the Congregation of St Catherine of Siena of Newcastle (Natal) in South Africa led the way in setting up St Rose's Convent Orange Hill Road in Burnt Oak (north London) in February 1930. This was an independent school where children stayed on in education until the age of 14. This led to the foundation of St James' Catholic Central School in 1934, and amalgamated with St Rose's School with Sr Mary Catherine Walsh as the first Headteacher (1934‚Äì69). This was in response to Cardinal Bourne, Archbishop of Westminster. Bourne had noticed that the new Watling housing estate had been built in north London by the London County Council intended to provide better quality housing for people then living in Islington and other parts of inner London - many of which lived in poor and sub-standard accommodation. Thus there was an opportunity to provide Catholic secondary education for the families of the Catholic parishes of north-west London. When it was set up, St James was the only mixed non-selective Catholic school in London. The other Catholic Secondary schools were single sex, selective and generally fee paying. In 1949 a further expansion followed when St. Thomas' Independent School in Stanmore was annexed to St. James'. In 1997 the school was reunited on one site in Colindale, and in 2004 it became a specialist Science and Sports College.http://www.st-james.barnet.sch.uk/ The former headteacher was Mrs. Niamh Arnull. The previous headteachers have been Sr Mary Catherine Walsh (1934‚Äì69), Sr Veronica Desmond O.P (1969 - 1984), Sr Mary Raymunda Jordan O.P (1984 - 1992), Mr. Kevin McSharry (1992 - 2005) and Mrs. Anne O'Shea (2005-2010).

Overview The Project Mathematics! series of videos is a teaching aid for teachers to help students understand the basics of geometry and trigonometry. The series was developed by Tom M. Apostol and James F. Blinn, both from the California Institute of Technology. Apostol led the production of the series, while Blinn provided the computer animation used to depict the ideas beings discussed. Blinn mentioned that part of his inspiration was the Bell science series of films from the 1950s. The material was designed for teachers to use in their curriculums and was aimed at grades 8 through 13. Workbooks are also available to accompany the videos and to assist teachers in presenting the material to their students. The videos are distributed as either 9 VHS videotapes or 3 DVDs, and include a history of mathematics and examples of how math is used in real world applications.

Contest, were created in 1991 for teachers and are only available on videotape. The content of the nine educational modules follows below. The Theorem of Pythagoras A right triangle with a square on each side In 1988, The Theorem of Pythagoras was the first video produced by the series and reviews the Pythagorean theorem. For all right triangles, the square of the hypotenuse is equal to the sum of the squares of the other two sides (a2 \\\\+ b2 = c2). The theorem is named after Pythagoras of ancient Greece. Pythagorean triples occur when all three sides of a right triangle are integers such as a = 3, b = 4 and c = 5. A clay tablet shows that the Babylonians knew of Pythagorean triples 1200 years before Pythagoras, but nobody knows if they knew the more-general Pythagorean theorem. The Chinese proof uses four similar triangles to prove the theorem. Today, we know of the Pythagorean theorem because of Euclid's Elements, a set of 13 books on mathematics‚Äîfrom around 300 BCE‚Äîand the knowledge it contained has been used for more than 2000 years. Euclid's proof is described in book 1, proposition 47 and uses the idea of equal areas along with shearing and rotating triangles. In the dissection proof, the square of the hypotenuse is cut into pieces to fit into the other two squares. Proposition 31 in book 6 of Euclid's Elements describes the similarity proof, which states that the squares of each side can be replaced by shapes that are similar to each other and the proof still works. The Story of Pi Pi is equal to the circumference of a circle divided by its diameter. The second module created was The Story of Pi, in 1989, and describes the mathematical constant pi and its history. The first letter in the Greek word for \\"perimeter\\" (œÄŒµœÅŒØŒºŒµœÑœÅŒøœÇ) is , known in English as \\"pi\\". Pi is the ratio of a circle's circumference to its diameter and is roughly equal to 3.14159. The circumference of a circle is 2 \\\\pi r and its area is \\\\pi r^2. The volume and surface area of a cylinder, cone sphere and torus are calculated using pi. Pi is also used in calculating planetary orbit times, gaussian curves and alternating current. In calculus, there are infinite series that involve pi and pi is used in trigonometry. Ancient cultures used different approximations for pi. The Babylonian's used \\\\tfrac{25}{8} and the Egyptians used \\\\tfrac{256}{81} . Pi is a fundamental constant of nature. Archimedes discovered that the area of the circle equals the square of its radius times pi. Archimedes was the first to accurately calculate pi by using polygons with 96 sides both inside and outside a circle then measuring the line segments and finding that pi was between \\\\tfrac{223}{71} and \\\\tfrac{22}{7} . A Chinese calculation used polygons with 3,000 sides and calculated pi accurately to five decimal places. The Chinese also found that \\\\tfrac{355}{113} was an accurate estimate of pi to within 6 decimal places and was the most accurate estimate for 1,000 years until arabic numerals were used for arithmetic. By the end of the 19th century, formulas were discovered to calculate pi without the need for geometric diagrams. These formulas used infinite series and trigonometric functions to calculate pi to hundreds of decimal places. Computers were used in the 20th century to calculate pi and its value was known to one billion decimals places by 1989. One reason to accurately calculate pi is to test the performance of computers. Another reason is to determine if pi is a specific fraction, which is a ratio of two integers called a rational number that has a repeating pattern of digits when expressed in decimal form. In the 18th century, Johann Lambert found that pi cannot be a ratio and is therefore an irrational number. Pi shows up in many areas having no obvious connection to circles. For example; the fraction of points on a lattice viewable from an origin point is equal to \\\\tfrac{6}{\\\\pi^2} . Similarity Discusses how scaling objects does not change their shape and how angles stay the same. Also shows how ratios change for perimeters, areas and volumes. Sines and Cosines, Part I (Waves) Visually depicts how sines and cosines are related to waves and a unit circle. Also reviews their relationship to the ratios of side lengths of right triangles. Sines and Cosines, Part II (Trigonometry) Explains the law of sines and cosines how they relate to sides and angles of a triangle. The module also gives some real life examples of their use. Sines and Cosines, Part III (Addition formulas) Describes the addition formulas of sines and cosines and discusses the history of Ptolemy's Almagest. It also goes into details of Ptolemy's Theorem. Animation shows how sines and cosines relate to harmonic motion. Polynomials How polynomials can approximate sines and cosines. Includes information about cubic splines in design engineering. The Tunnel of Samos How did the ancients dig the Tunnel of Samos from two opposite sides of a mountain in 500 BCE? And how were they able to meet under the mountain? Maybe they used geometry and trigonometry.* Early History of Mathematics Reviews some of the major developments in mathematical history.  Production  The Project Mathematics! series was created and directed by Tom M. Apostol and James F. Blinn, both from the California Institute of Technology. The project was originally titled Mathematica but was changed to avoid confusion with the mathematics software package. A total of four full-time employees and four part-time employees produce the episodes with help from several volunteers. Each episode took between four and five months to produce. Blinn headed the creation of the computer animation used in each episode, which was done on a network of computers donated by Hewlett-Packard.  Funding  The majority of the funding came from two grants from the National Science Foundation totaling $3.1 million. Free distribution of some of the modules was provided by a grant from Intel.  Distribution  Project Mathematics! video tapes, DVDs and workbooks are primarily distributed to teachers through the California Institute of Technology bookstore and were popular enough that the bookstore hired an extra person just for processing orders of the series. An estimated 140,000 of the tapes and DVDs were sent to educational institutions around the world, and have been viewed by approximately 10 million people over the last 20 years. The series is also distributed through the Mathematical Association of America and NASA's Central Operation of Resources for Educators (CORE). In addition, over half of the states in the US have received master copies of the videotapes so they can produce and distribute copies to their various educational institutions. The videotapes may be freely copied for educational purposes with a few restrictions, but the DVD version is not freely reproducible. The video segments for the first 3 modules can be viewed for free at the Project Mathematics! website as streaming video. Selected video segments of the remaining 6 modules are also available for free viewing. In 2017, Caltech made the entirety of the series, as well as three SIGGRAPH demo videos, available on YouTube.  Availability in different languages and formats  The videos have been translated into Hebrew, Portuguese, French, and Spanish with the DVD version being both English and Spanish. PAL versions of the videos are available as well and efforts are underway to translate the materials into Korean.

Biography Born in St. Louis, Phillip Wilson was a third generation musician. His grandfather, Ira Kimball, was a percussionist playing on the riverboats that traveled down the Mississippi to New Orleans. His recording debut was with Sam Lazar, noted for having one of the first interracial bands in the St. Louis area.City of Gabriels: the history of jazz in St. Louis, 1895-1973, Dennis Owsley, Reedy Press, August 8, 2006, After moving to Chicago, he became a member of the Association for the Advancement of Creative Musicians AACM and performed with the Art Ensemble of Chicago. He joined up with the Paul Butterfield Blues Band in 1967 at a time when the band membership changed greatly, including an added horn section. He recorded three albums with the group. Wilson's song Love March, written with Gene Dinwiddie, was performed at Woodstock and released in 1970 on the live album from the festival. Wilson, along with Dinwiddie and fellow former Butterfield Band member Buzz Feiten, formed the jazz-rock band Full Moon in the early 1970s. They recorded a self-titled album which is considered one of the finest early examples of jazz fusion. He was part of the loft jazz scene in 1970s New York, worked as a session musician for Stax Records in Memphis and with Jimi Hendrix at the Cafe Au Go Go and Generation Club in 1968, recorded with The Last Poets, Fontella Bass, Olu Dara, David Murray, Anthony Braxton, and Carla Bley. He worked extensively with Lester Bowie. In 1985, he and Bill Laswell co-produced the album Down by Law under the group name Deadline. Wilson was pursuing his musical career when he was stalked and murdered in New York City on March 25, 1992. As a result of the America's Most Wanted television program, Marvin Slater was convicted for premeditated murder in 1997 and sentenced to 33 1/3 years in state prison.\\"Phillip Wilson Remembered\\", St. Louis Jazz Notes, November 10, 2008 Discography As leader * Full Moon with Full Moon (1972) * Duet with Lester Bowie (Improvising Artists, 1978) * Esoteric with Olu Dara (Hat Hut, 1979) * Down by Law with Deadline (Celluloid, 1985) As sideman With Hamiet Bluiett * Endangered Species (India Navigation, 1976) With Lester Bowie * African Children (Horo, 1978) * I Only Have Eyes for You (ECM, 1985) * Avant Pop (ECM, 1986) * Twilight Dreams (Venture, 1987) * The Organizer (DIW, 1991) * Funky T.

The power station was commissioned at the end of the Second World War and served Johannesburg for over 50 years.  History  Planning for the construction of Orlando started in 1935, as the electricity demand of Johannesburg was rising faster than what could be met with the existing City Generating Station located in downtown Johannesburg. The location for the station was selected due to its proximity to water supply for coolant and railway lines for the delivery of coal. Construction started in 1939 with Merz & McLellan as consulting engineers, but completion was delayed due to the outbreak of the Second World War. The last phase of construction was completed in 1955. Until 1990 two Hunslet Austerity 0-6-0ST steam engines (Nos. 7805 Elizabeth and 7398 George) were used to move incoming coal trains through a wagon tipper at the power plant. The station was decommissioned in 1998 after 56 years of service. In 2006 work was started to transform the site of the power station into an entertainment and business centre. On 25 June 2014, the decommissioned power plant collapsed, killing 1 and trapping 5 others in the rubble.http://citizen.co.za/201279/abandoned-power-station-comes-crashing- down/ rap jumping down the cooling towers.  Cooling towers  Decommissioned cooling towers with vivid decoration in 2014 The two cooling towers are a prominent landmark in Soweto. They were built in 1951 to supplement the spray pond cooling system as this source of cooling was running at its capacity. Being supplied by sewage effluent from the Klipspruit Sewage Works, the spray ponds at Orlando were the first in South Africa to make use of this ready supply of coolant liquid. Both towers are painted, one functioning as an advertising billboard and the other containing the largest mural painting in South Africa. The towers are also used for bungee and BASE jumping from a platform between the top of the two towers as well as a bungee swing into one of the towers.  In film and TV  The tower was used for a Fast Forward on the seventh season of The Amazing Race. The task was for one team (Ray & Deana in particular) to walk across a suspension bridge spanning one of the cooling towers 30 storeys above the ground. In the movie Chappie the power station is the headquarter of the protagonists, the two iconic cooling towers and the main building are decorated with typical Die Antwoord artwork.https://www.imdb.com/title/tt1823672/locations The towers also appeared on the Dutch television series Wie is de Mol? where contestants in the premiere of the show's thirteenth season bungee jumped off of the towers.

The company focuses predominantly on movie and trailer music, and has supplied tracks to films such as Interstellar, Harry Potter, Pirates of the Caribbean, and X-Men. History Two Steps from Hell was founded in 2006 when Thomas Bergersen and Nick Phoenix joined forces to write original music for movie trailers. Bergersen moved from Trondheim, Norway to the United States in 2003, along with Phoenix, who began composing in 1997, before moving to Los Angeles. The two formed the company in early 2006, and have composed music for over 1,000 major motion picture trailers.  Name origin  With the founding of the company in 2006, Bergersen was looking for a name that would draw attention with the old adage in mind, \\"All PR is good PR.\\" The idea for the name came from \\"Two Steps From Heaven\\", a Norwegian nightclub that, according to Bergersen, had a similar theme going on.Interview with Thomas Bergersen and Nick Phoenix, Burst Magazine August 2013, S. 43. Founding and initial success (2006‚Äì2010) Two Steps from Hell mainly produces trailer music and epic music, although recently it has also been used for television shows and video games. Despite the company finding success for its music, the tracks were never officially released to the public until the May 2010 release of the commercial album Invincible. Invincible was approaching Gold record status. As of January 2017, Two Steps from Hell has published 10 public albums in addition to 20 demonstration albums, with almost 1,000 unique tracks in total. The album Sun, which was released on September 30, 2014, is the second solo album from Thomas Bergersen. Preview tracks were released from the album, titled \\"Cry\\" and \\"Sun\\", the former of which can be downloaded from Bergersen's official website. An official music video for \\"Sun\\" was also released on YouTube, preceding the announcement of a signed limited deluxe edition CD release set to include additional tracks and notes from Thomas, as well as a large-size poster featuring his artwork. Additionally, in July 2014 Two Steps from Hell released an e-book known as Colin Frake on Fire Mountain, which features a 75,000-word novel written by Nick Phoenix with illustrations by Otto Bjornik, as well as an original score also made available via a soundtrack release. A sequel entitled Colin Frake: Asclepius was released on April 2017. Two Steps from Hell's main graphic artist is Steven Gilmore, who has created album covers for almost every promotional and public release, including the logo of the company, with the only exception being the 2009 DVD release of their library, for which the album cover was created by Paul Zeaiter. Additionally, Thomas Bergersen's Illusions solo album features design by Jesper Krijgsman, while its sequel, Sun, features artwork created by Thomas himself.

Randazza (born November 26, 1969) is an American First Amendment attorney and a commentator on Infowars and CNN on legal matters. Early life and education Randazza was born in Gloucester, Massachusetts. He graduated from Gloucester High School in 1987. Randazza attended the University of Massachusetts Amherst, where he majored in journalism. Randazza worked as a journalist and in advertising in Washington, D.C., Palermo, Rome, New York City, and Miami. In 1996, Randazza was inspired to attend law school by the film The People vs. Larry Flynt. He attended Georgetown University Law Center and graduated in 2000. During law school, he interned for Denise Johnson of the Vermont Supreme Court. He continued his First Amendment education by attending the University of Florida, where he earned a master's degree in communications, writing his thesis on vote pairing, which was cited by the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals.Porter v. Bowen, 496 F.3d 1009 (9th Cir. 2007) Career Randazza is licensed to practice law in Massachusetts (2002), Florida (2003), California (2010), Arizona (2010), and Nevada (2012). Randazza's first case was representing a fraternity at Boston University when the brothers of that fraternity were accused of destroying their house and other misconduct. He then began practicing in Florida as a real estate attorney. He quickly returned to the First Amendment and media field, taking on representation of an adult bookstore in Fort Myers, Florida. Soon thereafter, he moved to Orlando, Florida where his practice in First Amendment and media law expanded. He started representing defendants in SLAPP suits, pornography businesses, protestors, in often unpopular constitutional law matters. In 2004, his University of Florida thesis gained attention as vote pairing became a minor issue during the 2004 election. Randazza was asked to debate the issue on Fox News, and thereafter has been a frequent legal commentator on television and in print. Randazza served as a professor of law at Barry University School of Law, located in Orlando, Florida. where he taught First Amendment law, copyright law, trademark law, and entertainment law. Randazza has a practice that primarily focuses on the areas of First Amendment litigation, adult entertainment, trademark and copyright litigation, and domain name arbitration disputes. He has represented a number of well- known adult entertainment companies including Kink.com, Bang Bus, and Milf Hunter. He also represents media businesses such as BME and bloggers in SLAPP suits. Randazza represents multiple far-right figures, including conspiracy theorists Alex Jones, Mike Cernovich, and Chuck Johnson; and neo-Nazi Andrew Anglin. Randazza defended a participant in the planning of the violent Unite the Right rally who used the pseudonym \\"Kristall.night\\" (cf. Kristallnacht). Kristall.night claimed that a federal subpoena against the app Discord following the deadly rally would reveal her identity and expose her to potential harm through doxing. Randazza has defended Anglin in a lawsuit filed by a Jewish realtor in Whitefish, Montana, whom Anglin had published the name and address of on his neo-Nazi website The Daily Stormer. Randazza had argued that Anglin was not responsible for the subsequent harassment and death threats the woman received, as the personal information was protected as free speech. This claim was rejected by U.S. District Court Judge Dana L. Christensen, who noted that Anglin was actively encouraging and participating in the plaintiff's harassment, and that calls to violence against a private individual are not protected speech. Multiple state bar disciplinary proceedings The State Bar of Nevada charged Randazza with alleged violations of Nevada Rules of Professional Conduct 1.4 (Communication), 1.7 (Conflict of Interest: Current Clients), 1.8 (Conflict of Interest: Current Clients: Specific Rules), 1.10 (Imputation of Conflicts of Interest), 1.15 (Safekeeping Property), 1.16 (Declining or Terminating Representation), 2.1 (Advisor), 5.6 (Restrictions on Right to Practice), and 8.4 (Misconduct).http://caseinfo.nvsupremecourt.us/public/caseView.do;jsessionid=CDCD8B17DEA64E07ADCC226BA9525E7D?csIID=47682http://www.pornnewstoday.com/index.php/2018/10/15/attorney- marc-randazza-of-randazza-legal-group-law-license-has-been-suspended-in- nevada/ On July 23, 2018, an automatic appeal was filed with the Nevada Supreme Court regarding a guilty plea and disciplinary recommendation made by the Southern Nevada Disciplinary Panel. The Disciplinary Panel had recommended a one-year suspension, stayed for 18 months, with the requirement that he avoid subsequent ethics complaints for the 18 months following entry of the order, complete 20 hours of CLE classes, and pay the costs associated with the proceedings within 30 days.https://www.nvbar.org/wp- content/uploads/Randazza.pdf The plea and disciplinary recommendation were only for the violations of Rules 1.8 and 5.6; the remaining charges were dismissed. In October 2018, Randazza was disciplined and the recommendation of the Disciplinary Panel was upheld by the Supreme Court of Nevada. The Nevada suspension was not put into effect.https://efactssc- public.flcourts.org/casedocuments/2019/188/2019-188_miscdoc_363155_f01.pdf On January 14, 2019, the Arizona State Bar issued a public reprimand and a suspension based upon some of the misconduct that took place in Nevada.https://azbar.legalserviceslink.com/attorneys-view/MarcJRandazza A new disciplinary case was opened in Arizona and California based upon further information and documentation of alleged misconduct by Randazza, to include allegedly lying in court documents related to the Alex Jones case in Connecticut.https://www.huffpost.com/entry/alex-jones-lawyer-marc- randazza_n_5c1c283ae4b08aaf7a86b9e4 However, beyond the reciprocal disciplinary proceedings, Randazza was not charged with any new violations and the Arizona suspension was not put into effect.https://web.flsd.uscourts.gov/uploads/adminOrders/2020/2020-29.pdf On May 2, 2019, in the Supreme Judicial Court for Suffolk County, Massachusetts, in a state bar disciplinary proceeding styled In re: Mark John Randazza, Case No. BD-2018-110, a hearing was conducted, which included an additional alleged ethical violation that the bar counsel claimed the State Bar of Nevada ignored.https://www.huffpost.com/entry/neo-nazi-andrew-anglins-lawyers-want- out-of-high-profile-harassment-case_n_5cc119e1e4b01b6b3efc7408 The Massachusetts Supreme Judicial Court did not find this additional ethical violation existed and issued a stayed suspension of the same term as Nevada. The Florida Supreme Court conducted a similar reciprocal disciplinary proceeding; it found no aggravating factors, with the Referee finding that there was \\"no clear and convincing evidence to suggest that anything [Randazza] may have done on behalf of his other clients was actually adverse to\\" his complaining clients. Thus, Randazza was given a reprimand and one year probation in Florida.https://efactssc- public.flcourts.org/casedocuments/2019/188/2019-188_disposition_150449_d39e.pdf Adult entertainment law Randazza has gained attention for handling high- profile First Amendment cases and for his defense of the adult entertainment field. Randazza was named one of the Top 50 newsmakers of the adult entertainment industry by XBIZ World Magazine for the year 2011. Anti- SLAPP He has represented the defendant in Beck v. Eiland-Hall, a case before the World Intellectual Property Organization (WIPO) filed by political commentator Glenn Beck, concerning a satire website parodying Beck. The WIPO arbitrator ruled against Beck in the case, and in favor of Randazza's client. In late 2011, Randazza and his firm effectively killed Righthaven, a \\"copyright troll\\" company briefly infamous for buying limited rights to copyrighted works for the sole purpose of bringing lawsuits against alleged infringers. On May 9, 2013, the United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit affirmed the lower court's decision dismissing the case for lack of standing. Righthaven complained of what it called Randazza's \\"scorched earth judgment enforcement efforts\\" in its legal filings. In 2013, Randazza lobbied the Nevada legislature to update Nevada's Anti-SLAPP statute. On June 8, 2015, Governor Sandoval signed Nevada Senate bill 444, which in its initial form, stood to largely repeal the Nevada Anti-SLAPP law. The initial form of the law was backed by casino mogul, Steve Wynn. Randazza lobbied to keep the statute in its speech-protective form. Arbitration proceedings On June 3, 2015, there was an interim arbitration award against Randazza involving Liberty Media Holdings LLC, for whom Randazza had been General Counsel from 2009 to 2012. The Ars Technica article on that case referenced a statement from Randazza's arbitration attorney to the Law Society of Upper Canada calling the arbitrator's neutrality into question. The arbitration dispute arose following Randazza's departure from Liberty and his filing of employment claims against them. Liberty's counterclaims against Randazza in the arbitration focused on allegations Randazza had negotiated bribes from opposing parties in copyright litigation, engaged in conflicts of interest, destroyed evidence, unjustly enriched himself, and committed other breaches of fiduciary duty. Following two and a half years of arbitration proceedings, the arbitrator issued an interim award in favor of Liberty and against Randazza on all claims. Following his arbitration loss, Randazza filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection. The arbitration was ultimately vacated in its entirety, by agreement, after a court refused to confirm the arbitration award. Klingon language On April 27, 2016, Randazza filed a friend of the court brief in the lawsuit by Paramount Pictures and CBS against Axanar Productions on behalf of the Language Creation Society. The lawsuit concerned a 21-minute fan-made short film, Prelude to Axanar. Paramount Pictures and CBS claimed, among other things, that the film infringed their rights by making use of the Klingon language. Randazza argued that Klingon is a living language, and, as such, is a \\"state of mind\\" ‚Äîa system or process, which cannot be copyrighted, unlike a work. Randazza contended that since Klingon was invented in the 1980s, the language has expanded past its origins, pointing to examples like dictionaries, translations of Shakespeare, the Klingon Language Institute, official government statements, a wedding conducted in Klingon, and translation service available through Bing. To support its point, portions of the brief were written in Klingon, employing the Klingon alphabet. Response to the brief was generally positive. Attorney and blogger Kevin Underhill called it \\"a terrific brief\\", and Attorney Ken White of Popehat wrote that \\"Marc continues to demonstrate that legal writing can be entertaining, irreverent, and persuasive at the same time.\\" In an article on the blog Mental Floss, Linguist Arika Okrent particularly praised the incorporation of the Klingon language into arguments. Ethan Chiel of Fusion called the brief \\"a joy to read\\" and remarked that it was \\"wonderful to see what is essentially (very serious) fun being had in demonstrating a point in a legal proceeding.\\" About three weeks after the brief was filed, in an interview on May 20, 2016, J. J. Abrams said that Paramount would drop the lawsuit \\"within the next few weeks.\\" Abrams further stated that he pushed the studio to stop the lawsuit because \\"we realized this is not the appropriate way to deal with the fans.\\" The Satanic Temple In May 2018 The Satanic Temple (TST) sued Twitter for religious discrimination with pro bono support from Randazza. In August, the Los Angeles chapter of TST disaffiliated in protest, calling Randazza a \\"Twitter troll and an agent of the alt-right.\\" Other Randazza has handled a number of \\"cameras in the courtroom\\" cases, defending the rights of the news media to attend and televise courtroom proceedings. Most notably, Randazza successfully argued this issue against Alan Dershowitz. In that case, Randazza represented Courtroom View Network in its quest to televise a highly publicized trial in Las Vegas involving the Las Vegas Sands. In July 2012, VegasInc and Avvo.com named Randazza one of Las Vegas' Top Lawyers. On Oct. 1, 2014, Randazza was named by Desert Companion Magazine to its top lawyers in Southern Nevada list.

He was Lord Mayor of London in 1726. Early life Eyles was the second but eldest surviving son of Sir Francis Eyles, 1st Baronet, and his wife Elizabeth, daughter of London merchant Richard Ayley. He married his cousin, Mary Haskin Styles, the daughter of Joseph Haskin Stiles by Sarah Eyles, the daughter of Sir John Eyles, elder brother of the first baronet.Cokayne, George Edward (1906) Complete Baronetage. Volume V. Exeter: W. Pollard & Co. . p. 22 His younger brother was Joseph Eyles, MP. Career Eyles was a Director of the East India Company from 1710 to 1714. He was elected as Whig Member of Parliament for Chippenham at the 1713 general election. From 1715 to 1717 he was a director of the Bank of England. He was elected MP for Chippenham again at the 1715 general election and voted consistently with the government. He succeeded to his father's baronetcy on 24 May 1716 and became Master of the Haberdashers Company and Alderman of Vintry on 19 June 1716. Also in 1716, he was appointed one of the commissioners to oversee estates forfeited to the Crown during the unsuccessful Jacobite rising of 1715, a post he held until 1725. From 1717 to 1721 Eyles served another term as Director of the East India Company. He was appointed Sheriff of London for 1720. He was also appointed a sub-governor of the South Sea Company in February 1721 in the aftermath of the South Sea Bubble. At the 1722 general election he was returned unopposed at Chippenham. He was knighted in December 1724 and served as Lord Mayor of London for the year 1726 to 1727. At the 1727 general election he was elected MP for the City of London.

Feminist constructivism focuses upon the study of how ideas about gender influence global politics.Baylis, Smith and Owens, The Globalisation of World Politics, 4ed, p267 It is the communication between two postcolonial theories; feminism and constructivism, and how they both share similar key ideas in creating gender equality globally.  Communication between the theories  Constructivism is a theory of knowledge which argues that humans generate knowledge and meaning through world interactions and ideas. Constructivists argue that international life is social, resulting from the ways people interact with each other (i.e. talk, follow norms, create rules, etc.). While there are similarities, feminist constructivists view relationships of power differently than traditional constructivists. Power and gender are considered \\"integral elements in processes of construction,\\" where as traditionalists believe power to be external. Feminist constructivists argue that the lack of problematization research as a social process of construction is logically inconsistent \\"with an ontology of becoming.\\" They also believe that differences between men and women, other than anatomical differences, were constructed due to socialization and cultural training. However, there are criticisms that take place between interactions of feminism with constructivism.Locher, Birgit, and Elisabeth Pr√ºgl. \\"Feminism And Constructivism: Worlds Apart Or Sharing The Middle Ground?.\\" International Studies Quarterly 45.1 (2001): Academic Search Complete. Web. 23 Feb. 2016. Many feminists do not agree with constructivism as an alternative middle ground due to most constructivists ignoring feminist literature and gender analysis. It's also pointed out that constructivism lacks the tools to explain how gender and power in politics influence each other, due to the social construction of power being under theorized.  Influence in politics  Major critiques in the feminist presence of global politics have not received as much attention in the media, due to more attention being given to the arguments of environmentalists and labor issues at anti-trade rallies, as opposed to those of feminist ideologies.Pr√ºgl, Elisabeth. \\"Toward A Feminist Political Economics.\\" International Feminist Journal of Politics 4.1 (2002): 31-36. Academic Search Complete. Web. 23 Feb. 2016. However, some places were found to be very ambivalent towards anti-globalization, an example being women in India who weren't concerned with the demands that linked trade liberalization with the enforcement of work standards.  Influence in research  Many dilemmas feminists observe is that there is some difficulty in measuring out the impact feminists had on international relations.Ackerly, Brooke, and Jacqui True. \\"Reflexivity In Practice: Power And Ethics In Feminist Research On International Relations.\\" International Studies Review 10.4 (2008): 693-707. Academic Search Complete. Web. 23 Feb. 2016. Feminist theory tends to reveal politics in every aspect of the research process, whether it's absence of action, silence of major concerns, oppression of feminist beliefs, and the power epistemology has on others preconceptions. In order to change this, many researchers utilize feminist research ethic, the commitment to inquire how one inquires. It involves being attentive to the power of knowledge, boundaries, marginalization, and silences, relationships and the power differentials between them, and the researcher's own situatedness. Epistemology plays a significant role, in that the researcher must destabilize themselves from our system of thought that goes into distinguishing fact from belief, which then allows the researcher to be objective in their studies. Another key component in feminist research ethic is boundaries, as in being attentive to them and their power to marginalize. It may include inclusion and exclusion of boundaries, as well as breaking them down. Having a feminist research ethic also requires the researcher to consider are relationships and how social, political, and economical actions are interrelated with other actions and lives.  Influence in leadership  When women or other members of minority groups obtain a position of substantial power in society, they most likely will encounter trouble garnering compliance for the use of their powers.Ridgeway, Cecilia L, Cathryn Johnson, and David Diekema. \\"External Status, Legitimacy, And Compliance In Male And Female Groups.\\" Social Forces 72.4 (1994): 1051-1077. Academic Search Complete. Web. 4 May 2016. This is primarily caused by the existing belief that gender is an institutionalized system of social practices for constituting males and females as different in socially significant ways and organizing inequalities in terms of those differences.Ridgeway, Cecilia L. \\"Gender, Status, And Leadership.\\" Journal of Social Issues 57.4 (2001): 637. Academic Search Complete. Web. 4 May 2016. Expectation states theory states that gender is deep seated within social hierarchy because the rules for gender systems that contain stereotypes are considered status beliefs, cultural schemas about the leadership position that are based on gender, race, ethnicity, education, or occupation.

Fliegerhorst M√ºnster-Handorf was one of the first Luftwaffe airfields, being established in 1935. After being captured by Allied Forces in April 1945, it briefly became an Allied airfield at the end of the war, then being used as a Garrison for the Royal Air Force as part of the Army of Occupation until 1949. RAF 469 Signals Unit, a mobile radar and DF station was situated on the intersection of the destroyed runways until at least 1953, with the operator and maintenance crews billeted at Boniburg Schloss near Hahndorf village until 1953 when a new camp was built at the airfield. Abandoned until 1960, the former airfield was used as a Dutch Nike missile base in 1960/61. It was later closed and today little remains except some concreted areas used as roads and some abandoned destroyed buildings in an industrial estate. History Fliegerhorst M√ºnster-Handorf was opened in 1935, one of the first Luftwaffe airfields of the reconstituted German Air Force. It was opened as a flight school, with Flugzeugf√ºhrerschule A/B 12 using Arado Ar 66 and other trainers. Luftwaffe use during World War II The base became an operational field in September 1939, shortly after World War II broke out. Kampfgeschwader 54 (KG 54) arrived in September with Heinkel He 111P medium bombers; and three Messerschmitt Bf 109E fighter units, Jagdgeschwader 3 (JG 3); Jagdgeschwader 51 (JG 51) and Jagdgeschwader 21 (JG 21) arrived during the Phony War period with France and Great Britain. The Luftwaffe, 1933-45 In addition, Jagdgeschwader 27 (JG 27) and Kampfgeschwader 1 (KG 1) were formed at M√ºnster-Handorf with Bf 109Es and He 111H's After the Battle of France and the war moved west into France and England, M√ºnster- Handorf became an airfield for R&R; and re-equipping combat units. Various units moved in and out of the airfield for brief periods of time, JG 77, a Bf 109E fighter unit and KG 3, a Junkers Ju 88A multirole bomber (KG) unit spent time at the field. In June 1943, Lehrgeschwader 1, a Ju 88A trining unit used the field through most of the year. With the increasing Allied bomber attacks on Germany in 1943, M√ºnster-Handorf was assigned to be part of the Defense of the Reich campaign by the Luftwaffe. Nachtjagdgeschwader 7 (NJG 7), a Ju 88G night fighter unit was formed at the base in February 1944 and flew night interceptor missions until September. It was replaced by Nachtjagdgeschwader 2 (NJG 2), also formed at the base which flew missions until November 1944 and Nachtjagdgeschwader 1 (NJG 1), which operated Heinkel He 219 night fighters until April 1945. Day interceptor units were JG 54 with Focke-Wulf Fw 190As and also Kampfgeschwader 76 (KG 76) were assigned to the field in late 1944 and early 1945. KG 76 possibly never being operational due to fuel shortages. Kampfgeschwader 2 (KG 2) flew Dornier Do 217 aircraft with V-1 flying bombs attached used the base during September 1944, then moved into the Netherlands to be closer to the British targets. The Luftwaffe interceptors and the V-1 flying bombs at M√ºnster-Handorf drew the attention of the USAAF Eighth Air Force, with no less than ten heavy bomber attacks on the airfield between December 1943 and March 1945.USAFHRA Document Search, HANDORF In addition, as the airfield in range of Ninth Air Force B-26 Marauder medium bombers and P-47 Thunderbolt fighter bombers in eastern France, attacks on the airfield by these tactical units with 500-pound General-Purpose bombs; unguided rockets and .50 caliber machine gun sweeps were frequent. These attacks would take place when Eighth Air Force heavy bombers (B-17s, B-24s) were within interception range of the Luftwaffe aircraft assigned to the base, with the attacks being timed to have the maximum effect possible to keep the interceptors pinned down on the ground and be unable to attack the heavy bombers.Derived from information in USAAF Film \\"Target For Today\\" (available at https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kkGL7vuC2A4) USAAF use 514th Fighter Squadron P-47 Thunderbolt \\"Skirty Bert III\\", M√ºnster-Handorf Airfield (Y-94), Germany, April 1945 At the end of March 1945, United States Army units moving to close the Ruhr Pocket captured M√ºnster-Handorf Airfield. On 5 April the IX Engineer Command 852d Engineer Aviation Battalion moved in and began patching the bomb craters of the airfield's concrete runway. The airfield was heavily damaged by the Allied bomb attacks and it took a week for the engineers to fill in bomb craters and lay down a 5000' asphalt runway over the concrete runway used by the Luftwaffe.

Air Force Combat Units of World War II. Maxwell AFB, Alabama: Office of Air Force History, 1983. . The pocket was made smaller and smaller, eventually forcing the surrender of over 300,000 German troops and their equipment. The victory in the Ruhr essentially eliminated serious opposition by the German Armed forces in Western Germany and afterward American ground forces swept east into Central Germany and Southern Germany, while British and Commonwealth forces moved into northern Germany against little organized resistance. With the end of combat on 7 May, the combat units moved out in June, the airfield being turned over to Air Technical Service Command. The ATSC 2d Air Depot Group moved in to manage the large number of excess Allied aircraft sent to Handorf, to be returned to the United States, sold to Allied countries, or to be scrapped. The Air Depot operated until the end of 1945, when in December, M√ºnster-Handorf was turned over to the Royal Air Force as part of the British Occupation Zone of Germany.Johnson, David C. (1988), U.S. Army Air Forces Continental Airfields (ETO), D-Day to V-E Day; Research Division, USAF Historical Research Center, Maxwell AFB, Alabama. Postwar use The destroyed base had little value to the RAF as an airfield, and the facility was used as a Garrison as part of the Army of Occupation until 1949 when it was closed. Most of M√ºnster-Handorf Airfield was removed during the 1950s as part of the reconstruction effort in West Germany, however in 1960 the former airfield was used by the Netherlands as a temporary Nike Anti- Aircraft Missile base for about a year until permanent facilities could be constructed. The base was closed in 1961, and the land turned over to the German government. Current Today, M√ºnster-Handorf Airfield is used as agricultural fields. However, there are many relics of the former wartime airfield which can be found. * Former maintenance area with several destroyed buildings left as rubble. * Aircraft dispersal parking with several destroyed buildings left as rubble. * Aircraft dispersal parking * Main runway, removed and today a thick vegetative area. * Dispersal area, probably remains of destroyed hangars in thick vegetation area. * The former Luftwaffe ground station (Also used by the British during their occupation) can be seen just to the northeast of the airfield, with several barracks, administrative buildings, an athletic field and large grass areas (probably the locations of destroyed buildings). In addition, many isolated remains of concrete taxiways, possibly a 2d runway can be viewed in aerial photography. Also the remains of the Dutch Nike missile pads can be seen as round concrete pads connected to single-lane roads.

Season summary As with the 2004 season, the 2005 K-League season was split up into first and second stages. Following the conclusion of the first stage, it did not bode well for a successful season for Daegu. They had won a mere 2 games of the first stage, placing the club 12th, ahead of only Gwangju in the first stage table. However, they fared much better for the second stage, winning 6 games, drawing 3, and losing 3. These results placed them third in the second stage table, and this translated into 8th place in the overall table. Their offensive spearhead was Brazilian import, Sandro Hiroshi, brought in for the 2005 season with Nonato and Jefferson having been loaned out for 2005 (to FC Seoul and Seongnam Ilhwa respectively). Hiroshi scored 10 goals from 24 games, which was the equal third highest overall for the season. Jin Soon-Jin finished the season as captain, after Hong Soon-Hak moved to one of Austria's most successful clubs, Grazer AK. Hong would ultimately only play 3 games in two years for his new club, before returning to Korea.

Resistance 3 is the final installment in the Resistance trilogy. Resistance 3 is the first in the series to support 3D and PlayStation Move and the first to introduce the PSN Pass program. The game shifts away from the military aspect of Resistance: Fall of Man and Resistance 2 and takes on a post-apocalyptic survival-horror feel. On April 8, 2014, online Resistance 3 servers, along with those for Resistance: Fall of Man and Resistance 2, were shut down by Sony. Gameplay The game retains mostly the same gameplay mechanics as its predecessor albeit with several changes. The weapon wheel and health bar from the first Resistance game return. There are also new environmental objects such as chimeran plants which explode when shot. The game sees a mixture of new and old weapons; returning weapons include the Bullseye, Magnum, Rossmore, Auger, Marksman and Carbine. New weapons include the Mutator, which shoots biological mist that causes enemies to eventually explode causing splash damage, the Deadeye sniper rifle, and a new food-can based explosive, the shrapnel grenade, which releases a shower of nails when it explodes. Weapons are upgradeable, and become more powerful the more they are used. Humans are forced to assemble their weapons from whatever scrap they can gather. The game features PlayStation Move support and Stereoscopic 3D. Additionally, players can utilize the PlayStation Sharp Shooter peripheral attachment. Multiplayer Resistance 3 featured an online 16-player competitive multiplayer component. It offers five modes: Team Deathmatch, Chain Reaction, Deathmatch, Breach, and Capture the Flag. It also includes a customizable progression system where players spend points earned by playing online to unlock customized loadouts that include various attributes. There is also a co-operative mode where players can team up to play through the story mode either online or split-screen. Game Informers podcast revealed that there would be no eight-player co-op as in Resistance 2. The multiplayer maps are set in locations around the world, such as the Fort Lamy prison in Chad; the Seaside of Glamorgan, Wales, UK; Alice Springs in Australia; New York City in the United States; the Trainyard in Bogota, Colombia. Some of the locations these maps take place in are not included in the story mode. Sony turned off the servers for the Resistance trilogy on April 8, 2014. Plot In 1953, shortly after Lt. Nathan Hale's death, Corporal Joseph Capelli, the only remaining member of the Sentinels, is dishonorably discharged for executing the former, despite having done it due to having turned into a chimera. Four years later, Capelli, now married to a woman named Susan Farley, is living with a community of survivors in Haven, Oklahoma. Despite their best efforts, they are discovered by Chimeran forces, who have launched a full-scale genocide against the human race, now that their virus can be cured. Capelli and his militia company fight off the attackers, but not before they summon a massive terraforming platform to destroy the town. While prepping for evacuation, Capelli runs into Dr. Fyoder Malikov, who explains that the Chimera have opened a wormhole in the middle of New York as part of their plan to permanently freeze the planet and render it uninhabitable for humanity. Capelli refuses to help him, but his wife begs him to reconsider, as their son is too weak to survive such a harsh environment. Stealing an old trawler, the two make their way up the Mississippi River, fighting off hordes of feral Chimera until the boat is destroyed by a Goliath. Upon awakening, they find that the currents have brought them to St. Louis, Missouri. With Malikov too injured to continue, Capelli enters the city and links up with a survivalist group known as the Remnants. In exchange for his help in fixing their transport, their leader, Charlie, agrees to take them to New York. A squad of Chimeran fighters ambush them near Mount Pleasant, Pennsylvania, forcing Capelli and Malikov to ditch the Remnants. After working together to evade enemy search parties, the two reach an abandoned coal town occupied by another group of survivors. They learn that the town priest, Jonathan Rose, vanished several days ago while hunting for \\"Satan\\", an oversized Chimera who lives in the nearby mines. Capelli tracks down Jonathan, and they manage to kill Satan. Out of gratitude, the townsfolk fix up an old coal train so they can resume their journey. While en route, a pack of bandits, the Wardens, assault the train. Capelli defeats them, but the train is subsequently overturned by a feral Widowmaker. Trapped under the wreckage, Capelli is forced to watch as Malikov is beheaded by the Warden leader, Mick. Taken to their hideout in Graterford Prison, he is forced to fight as a gladiator for the gang's amusement. Mick's lackey Herbert, a talented engineer, frees Capelli from confinement and tasks him with disabling the prison's defenses so he can stage a breakout. Despite Mick's interference, the plan succeeds and the Chimera lay waste to the prison and wipe out the Wardens. In the chaos, Capelli finds Mick and kills him. Now on his own, Capelli finally reaches New York City. After sending a farewell message to his family via radio, he fights his way through the Chimera until they overwhelm him with a mortar barrage. At the last second, the Remnants arrive and extract him. Charlie offers to take him home, but Capelli persuades him to help stage an attack on a nearby terraformer. By disabling the platform's controls and sabotaging its power core, the two are able to maneuver it into a collision course with the central tower, sealing the wormhole and returning Earth's temperatures back to normal. With the Chimera's chief advantage gone, human resistance groups around the world move to exterminate the Chimera and begin rebuilding all their nations. Capelli, meanwhile, is reunited with his wife and son, finally at peace with himself. Development In 2009, a promotional billboard for Resistance 3 was spotted on a location set for Battle: Los Angeles, a film by Columbia Pictures (a subsidiary of Sony) released in early 2011.(as the film is set in nearly one month prior to the game's release), Though neither Sony nor Insomniac Games commented on the appearance, Insomniac announced on May 25, 2010 that, in addition to creating a new multiplatform franchise, they would be developing multiple games exclusively for the PlayStation 3. The game was officially announced at Sony's Gamescom 2010 press conference in Cologne, Germany on August 17, 2010 alongside a live-action trailer for the game. On September 28, 2010, leaked concept art and screenshots were released onto a Flickr account which depict a number of different Chimera and two unidentified human characters (later confirmed in Game Informer's November 2010 cover story as Joseph Capelli and Susan Farley). When asked about the authenticity of the images, Insomniac replied with \\"no comment\\". The first gameplay was revealed at the Spike Video Game Awards, showing new weapons and enemies. Insomniac worked with Olly Moss to create the logo and box art. Downloadable content The downloadable content for Resistance 3 includes the \\"Survival\\" game packhttp://www.pushsquare.com/news/2011/09/resistance_3s_first_dlc_entitled_survival_pack_extends_multiplayer along with the \\"Brutality\\" game pack. The Survival pack includes: a Haven static theme, four new character skins for use in multiplayer, and a new multiplayer mode known as \\"Invasion\\".http://www.pushsquare.com/news/2011/09/resistance_3s_first_dlc_entitled_survival_pack_extends_multiplayer The Invasion mode forces Human and Chimeran teams to divide their resources with the goal of holding multiple control nodes on the map simultaneously. The more nodes a team holds, the faster they score points to achieve victory. The Brutality game pack is a survival-based wave mode which consists of the player roaming around a version of the Seaside multiplayer map, searching for new weapons along with ammunition and health to defend against the hordes of enemies. All weapons from the campaign can be found around the map and upgrade the more they are used. The game pack also includes seven tracks from the acclaimed heavy metal band Mastodon along with a prison theme and Mick Cutler skin for use in multiplayer. Both packs were removed in March 2014 from PlayStation Store, although only in Europe, around the same time of the multiplayer servers closure. However, the Brutality pack returned shortly after, possibly due to being also playable in singleplayer. Owners of specially marked copies of SOCOM 4 were able to download and play the beta on August 4 using the codes provided with that game, while PlayStation Plus subscribers in Region 2 territories gained access on August 10. On August 23, the beta opened to worldwide subscribers of PlayStation Plus. Insomniac announced that they would give away codes via Facebook and Twitter to join the beta. The public beta began on August 30. The beta offered two multiplayer modes: Team Deathmatch and Chain Reaction. These modes were playable on two maps. People that played the beta between August 30 and September 4 received a SRPA Nathan Hale skin for Resistance 3. The beta ended on September 4. Resistance 3 has two demos, one for purchasing Battle: Los Angeles on Blu-ray and the other is downloadable from the PlayStation Store. Global Resistance Global Resistance was a social media strategy game designed to promote the release of Resistance 3, where players could choose to play as Human or Chimera. Global Resistance had exclusive unlockable content for Resistance 3, like skins, artworks and videos. The game was disabled when the multiplayer servers for the Resistance trilogy closed on April 8, 2014. Special editions Resistance 3 came in two special editions. The Doomsday edition of Resistance 3 includes a copy of the game and a Move Controller bundle which includes the PlayStation Move controller, the PlayStation Move Sharp Shooter Attachment, the PlayStation Move navigation controller and the PlayStation Eye camera. The bundle was available in North America and Latin America. In Europe, the Survivor edition is available which includes Joseph Capelli's journal, Chimera firing range target, SRPA playing cards, a canvas satchel, SRPA hip flask and Fight for Freedom toy soldiers. Also released in Europe is the special edition which includes steelbook packaging, vinyl effect Blu-ray disc, SRPA Black Ops skin, infected Nathan Hale skin, air fuel grenade, special multiplayer title \\"Sentinel\\" and a multiplayer booster. Reception Resistance 3 received \\"favorable\\" reviews according to the review aggregation website Metacritic. IGN said, \\"In terms of tone, Insomniac has really amped up the gut-wrenching terror for Resistance 3. This is the darkest and most violent game in the series, and almost the entire second act of the game will have you on the edge of your seat.\\" Thierry Nguyen of 1UP.com said that \\"While Resistance 3 clearly steps forward as a improvement to the series, it's still not quite a great game overall.\\" GameSpot praised the game for its exciting, deep campaign and fun multiplayer and said, \\"No matter what your gaming setup, you're in for a treat. Resistance 3 offers a brand of excitement you won't find in any other shooter franchise.\\" Game Informer criticized the \\"bland environments\\", \\"predictable\\" level design, and \\"numerous glitches\\" that \\"halt the flow of the game entirely.\\" In Japan, Famitsu gave it a score of one nine, two eights, and one nine for a total of 34 out of 40. The A.V. Club gave it a B+, saying that the game \\"delivers the goods, make no mistake. They just happen to be the goods that gamers already had, dolled up in a shiny new package.\\" Common Sense Media gave it four stars out of five, saying, \\"It's not a perfect sci-fi shooter, but this new sequel from Insomniac Games is the best yet in the Resistance franchise.\\" The Daily Telegraph similarly gave it four stars out of five and said, \\"Connection issues aside, Resistance 3 really is one of the most enjoyable, memorable action games in years, on any platform. It has giant arachnids, constant action, and an awesome shotgun. It's visually stunning, artistically evocative. And most importantly, it's definitely got soul. And soldiers too, which is nice.\\" Digital Spy likewise gave it four stars out of five and said that the game \\"doesn't exactly rewrite the book on first-person shooters, but it offers thoroughly enjoyable gameplay, with a low learning curve, set against a strong narrative. Fans of the previous games will find much to love here, and even newcomers will find it a good jumping on point thanks to the intuitive controls.\\" The Guardian likewise gave it four stars out of five and said it was \\"fast, furious and entertaining throughout but lacks the uniqueness that would boost it to the very top of the FPS ladder.\\" However, Metro UK gave it a score of seven out of ten and said, \\"Although this is a considerably more interesting and accomplished game than any of its predecessors it's still nowhere near the cutting edge of the first person shooter genre. And we say that not just because of its abandonment of all that Halo introduced to the concept a decade ago.\\" Resistance 3 sold 180,000 copies in September and was seventh best selling game in the United States. In the UK it entered the PS3 software chart in fourth position in the first week of launch.https://www.eurogamer.net/articles/2011-10-14-resistance-3-sales-well- down-on-r2 References External links * Category:2011 video games Category:Alternate history video games Category:Cooperative video games Category:First-person shooters Category:Insomniac Games Category:Multiplayer online games Category:PlayStation 3 games Category:PlayStation 3-only games Category:PlayStation Move-compatible games Category:Post-apocalyptic video games Category:Alien invasions in video games Category:Resistance (video game series) games Category:Sony Interactive Entertainment games Category:Video game sequels Category:Video games developed in the United States Category:Video games set in the 1950s Category:Video games with stereoscopic 3D graphics Category:Multiplayer and single-player video games Category:Video games set in St. Louis Category:Video games set in Oklahoma Category:Video games set in Mississippi Category:Video games set in Pennsylvania Category:Video games set in Pittsburgh Category:Video games set in New York City Category:Video games set in Australia Category:Video games set in Chad Category:Video games set in Wales Category:Video games set in Japan Category:Video games set in Colombia ","title":"Resistance 3"},{"id":"24665347","text":"There have been two organization by this name, both were the student affiliates of the adult League for Industrial Democracy. *A group known originally as the Intercollegiate League for Industrial Democracy, existing as an autonomous section of the League for Industrial Democracy during the early 1930s.

Phrixotoxin-1 and -2 block A-type voltage-gated potassium channels; phrixotoxin-3 blocks voltage-gated sodium channels. Similar toxins are found in other species, for instance the Chilean rose tarantula. Sources Phrixotoxins are purified from the venom of the spider Phrixotrichus auratus , but they can also be produced by chemical peptide synthesis . Structure There are three different phrixotoxins: *Phrixotoxin-1 (PaTx1) ‚Äì which is composed of 29 amino acids *Phrixotoxin-2 (PaTx2) ‚Äì which is composed of 31 amino acids *Phrixotoxin-3 (PaurTx3 or Beta-theraphotoxin-Ps1a) ‚Äì which is composed of 34 amino acids Primary sequence and disulphide bond pattern of the phrixotoxins PaTx1 is 83.3% identical to PATx2, differing only by two acidic residues. Phrixotoxin-1 and -2 are similar to heteropodatoxin, which also has a blocking activity on Kv4.2 channels . Phrixotoxin-1, -2 and -3 contain an Inhibitor Cystine Knot (ICK) motif, and thus belong to the ICK peptide family. Target Phrixotoxin-1 and -2 bind to A-type, transient, voltage-gated potassium channels, near the S3 and S4 segments, where they negatively affect transmembrane movement of the voltage sensing domain in response to depolarizing voltages. They bind preferentially to the closed or inactivated state of Kv4.2 and Kv4.3 channels. Phrixotoxin-3 (PaurTx3) inhibits several voltage gated sodium channel subtypes (Nav1.1/SCN1A, Nav1.2/SCN2A, Nav1.4/SCN4A, Nav1.5/SCN5A, and Nav1.8/SCN10A) . Mode of action Phrixotoxins 1 and 2 specifically block Kv4.2 and Kv4.3 channels by altering the voltage-dependent gating properties of these channels. Inhibition results from a shift of the conductance-voltage relation and steady-state inactivation properties to more depolarized potentials. These toxins also change Kv4.2 and Kv4.3 kinetics of activation and inactivation by a concentration-dependent increase of the time-to-peak current and time constant of current inactivation . Phrixotoxin-3 modulates voltage-gated sodium channels by causing a depolarizing shift in gating kinetics and by blocking the inward component of sodium current, thus preventing the channels from opening to a moderate depolarization, resulting in a reduced firing rate of the neurons . Toxicity Phrixotoxin-1 Mice that are injected with phrixotoxin-1 can experience numerous, transient, adverse cardiac reactions, such as premature ventricular beats, ventricular tachycardia, and atrio-ventricular blocks. Neurological effects observed are motor impairment and convulsions. These effects are seen following both intravenous and intracisternal injection, making it likely that phrixotoxin-1 crosses the blood brain barrier . Phrixotoxin-3 Injection of this venom into mice causes immediate general ataxia, lack to response stimuli and semi-paralysis. Inability to stand and breathing reduction occurs within minutes. Flaccid paralysis and slowing of breathing eventually cause death .

Established by two brothers in October 1899, it has been trading continuously ever since, including during the aftermath of the San Francisco earthquake of 1906. The company is known for their legendary service and unmatched quality.  History  Congresswoman Pelosi greets employees of McRoskey Mattress Company in 2010. The company was founded by Edward and Leonard McRoskey at the intersection of Harrison and 16th Street.Business History: Home Furnishings Originally they had arrived in San Francisco as salesmen for a Chicago based engineering firm hoping to sell mattress making equipment to other manufacturers. Instead the McRoskeys decided to set up business for themselves as manufacturers of handmade mattresses. Only seven years later the city was hit by the earthquake and fire that followed, the company was the only manufacturer of mattresses to surviveDeBare, Ilana: \\"The Great Quake 1906-2006, Businesses weather a century: The small companies that survive adapt but stay true to their roots,\\" San Francisco Chronicle, April 2, 2006 and as such its products were in much demand by the inhabitants.Ryan, Joan: \\"A San Francisco Bed-Time Story: At the McRoskey Airflex Mattress Co. at Market and Gough, they make mattresses the old-fashioned way,\\" San Francisco Chronicle, May 17, 1998. In the 1920s the two brothers became competitors: Leonard continued to operate McRoskey & Co. while Edward opened his store at 1506 Market Street under the name of Edward L. McRoskey Mattress Company. In 1925, Edward built a new factory and showroom at 1687 Market Street where the company continues to retail today. He was very forward-thinking with the building‚Äôs construction and design, it was built out of reinforced concrete to help it withstand future earthquakes. In 1929, Edward‚Äôs brother Leonard passed away and his business was closed. On May 1, 1931, Edward L. McRoskey filed for his first patent for the McRoskey Tufting Machine, designed to help make the tufts stronger and requiring less needle work from the mattress makers. He later refined the process and invented a button threading machine that added buttons to mattress tufts. Additionally, he improved tufting even further by inventing a hand tool to be used for tufting, eliminating the need for a long upholstery needle and increasing the resiliency and springiness of the premium mattresses. Robin McRoskey Azevedo, CEO and third-generation owner of the McRoskey San Francisco. A woman in a predominantly male industry, she shifted the company focus from solely manufacturing, to building customer relationships; building the McRoskey brand from San Francisco‚Äôs best kept secret to a nationally recognized brand synonymous with quality sleep.  Ownership  Shortly after the move to Market and Gough, the second generation of McRoskey's, Edward's sons, Leonard and Robert, joined the firm. It is Robert's daughter (and therefore the granddaughter of one of the founders), Robin who heads the firm today.

Until middle age, his health was fairly good for the time. He contracted malaria in 1830 and 1835, the latter was the worst of the two cases. He contracted smallpox in 1863 during a 1863 to 1864 epidemic in Washington, D.C. Throughout his life he experienced periods of depression, which could be genetic, due to life experiences or trauma, or both. Lincoln took blue mass pills, which contained mercury. Based on his behavior and physical condition while taking the pills and after he quit taking them, Lincoln may have suffered from mercury poisoning. It has been theorized that Lincoln had Marfan syndrome or, more likely, Multiple endocrine neoplasia type 2B, both rare genetic diseases. Health and trauma Despite the following occurrences, Lincoln's health up until middle age was fairly good for his day. Trauma When he was nine years old, Lincoln was kicked in the head by a horse at the Noah Gordon Mill and was knocked unconscious for several hours. Other injuries or trauma throughout his life include having cut his hand with an axe at least once,Sotos, \\"Sourcebook\\", paragraph 1490. incurred frostbite of his feet in 1830‚Äì1831,Sotos, \\"Sourcebook\\", paragraph 930. was struck by his wife (apparently on multiple occasions),Sotos, \\"Sourcebook\\", paragraph 3589. and was clubbed on the head during a robbery attempt in 1828. Lincoln died from a bullet wound to the head in 1865.Sotos, \\"Sourcebook\\", paragraph 3582. Infectious disease * Malaria: Lincoln had malaria at least twice. The first was in 1830, along with the rest of his family.Sotos, \\"Sourcebook\\", paragraphs 2001-2007. They had just arrived in Illinois that year. The second episode was in the summer of 1835, while living in New Salem. Lincoln was then so ill that he was sent to a neighbor's house to be medicated and cared for.Sotos, \\"Sourcebook\\", pages 385-386. * Smallpox: November 18, 1863, while at the dedication of the Soldiers' National Cemetery, Lincoln was quite ill with smallpox. Long thought to have been only a mild case, recent work suggests it was a serious illness.Sotos, \\"Sourcebook\\", pages 411-431. Although it did not debilitate Lincoln, the disease did significantly affect his White House routine, and limited the advisors with whom he could meet. While caring for him, Lincoln's valet William H. Johnson contracted the disease and ultimately died in January 1864. Lincoln arranged and paid for Johnson to be buried at Arlington National Cemetery. Mental health Lincoln was contemporaneously described as suffering from melancholy, a condition which modern mental health professionals would characterize as clinical depression. Lincoln suffered depressed mood after major traumatic events, such as the death of Ann Rutledge in August 1835,Donald, p. 57. the cessation of his (purported) engagement to Mary Todd Lincoln in January 1841 (after which several close associates feared Lincoln's suicide),Donald, p. 88. and after the Second Battle of Bull Run.Donald, p. 371. During his life Lincoln experienced the death of multiple close family members, including his mother, his sister, and two of his sons, Eddie and Willie. Mary Lincoln felt her husband to be too trusting, and his melancholy tended to strike at times he was betrayed or unsupported by those in whom he put faith.Schreiner, p. 154. Whether he may have suffered from depression as a genetic predilection, as a reaction to multiple emotional traumas in his life, or a combination thereof is the subject of much current conjecture.Donald, p. 27. Lincoln often combated his melancholic moods by delving into works of humor, likely a healthy coping mechanism for his depression. Medication The recollections of Lincoln's legal colleagues (John T. Stuart, Henry Clay Whitney, Ward Hill Lamon, and William Herndon) all agree that Lincoln took blue mass pills,\\"Sourcebook\\". paragraphs 612-626. which were commonly prescribed for hypochondriasis and melancholia. It has been used since the 16th century to treat syphilis and by the mid-19th century was prescribed for a wide variety of ills. The active ingredient of blue mass is elemental mercury ‚Äì a substance now known to be a neurotoxin in its valproic stateHayden, p. 130. and has been known to be poisonous for centuries. Lincoln may have taken the blue mass pills for constipation,\\"Sourcebook\\". paragraphs 612-626. as well as hypochondriasis, or what has been called persistent constipation-melancholia complex. Both conditions which were well known by his friends and family to have significantly affected Lincoln throughout his life. Authors of Abraham Lincoln's Blue Pills: Did Our 16th President Suffer from Mercury Poisoning? find that it is a reasonable assumption that Lincoln had experienced mercury poisoning due to the differences in his behavior and physical condition when he was taking the blue mass pills versus when he stopped taking the pills. When he was taking the blue mass pills, he was prone to outbursts of rage, bizarre behavior, memory loss, and insomnia. His hands trembled when he was under stress. Taking the medicine made Lincoln feel \\"cross\\". These issues, described in detail by those who were close to him, are common symptoms of mercury poisoning. When he stopped taking the medicine, and during a period of profound personal and professional stress, he \\"behaves like a saint\\". Lincoln may also had long-term effects as the result of mercury poisoning, such as nerve damage that affected his gait. Shortly after his 1861 inauguration, Lincoln had a sudden and disquieting outburst of rage during a White House conversation. Finding that the blue mass pills made him \\"cross\\", Lincoln stopped taking them about August 1861 (5 months after his March inauguration). Then his anger greatly diminished, so much so that he rarely expressed anger and then only when it was situationally appropriate. Body habitus The habitus, or structure, of Lincoln's body attracted attention while he was alive, and continues to attract attention today among medical professionals.Sotos, \\"The Physical Lincoln\\", pages 194-204. * Height: as a child, Lincoln was tall, describing himself as \\"though very young, he was large of his age.\\"Sotos, \\"Sourcebook\\", paragraph 478. He reached his adult height of 6 feet 4 inches (1.93 m) no later than age 21. * Weight: although well-muscled as a young adult, he was always thin. Questionable evidence says Lincoln weighed over 200 pounds (90 kg) in 1831,Sotos, \\"Sourcebook\\", paragraph 363. but this is inconsistent with the emphatic statement of Henry Lee Ross (\\"The facts are Lincoln never weighed over 175 pounds in his life\\"),Sotos, \\"Sourcebook\\", paragraph 368. the recollection of David Turnham (\\"weighed about 160 lbs in 1830\\"),Sotos, \\"Sourcebook\\", paragraph 361. and a New Salem neighbor named Camron (\\"thin as a beanpole and ugly as a scarecrow\\"). Lincoln's self- reported weight was 180 lbs (81.5 kg) in 1859.Sotos, \\"Sourcebook\\", paragraph 369. He is believed to have weighed even less during his presidency.White, p. 108. The theory that Lincoln's facial asymmetries were a manifestation of craniofacial microsomia has been replaced with a diagnosis of left synostotic frontal plagiocephaly, which is a type of craniosynostosis. Genetic disorder theories Several claims have been made that Lincoln's health was declining before the assassination. These are often based on photographs of Lincoln appearing to show weight loss and muscle wasting. The theories are that he suffered from multiple endocrine neoplasia type 2B (MEN2B) or Marfan syndrome, rare genetic disorders. DNA analysis of a pillowcase stained with Lincoln's blood, currently in possession of the Grand Army of the Republic Museum and Library in Philadelphia may be able to resolve open questions about Lincoln's health. Marfan syndrome Based on Lincoln's unusual physical appearance, Dr. Abraham Gordon proposed in 1962 that Lincoln had Marfan syndrome. Testing Lincoln's DNA for Marfan syndrome was contemplated in the 1990s, but such a test was not performed. Lincoln's unremarkable cardiovascular history and his normal visual acuity have been the chief objections to the hypothesis, and today geneticists consider the diagnosis unlikely. Multiple endocrine neoplasia type 2B In 2007, Dr. John Sotos proposed that Lincoln had multiple endocrine neoplasia type 2B (MEN2B).Sotos, \\"The Physical Lincoln\\". This hypothesis suggests Lincoln had all the major features of the disease: a marfanoid body shape, large, bumpy lips, constipation, hypotonia, a history compatible with cancer‚Äîto which Sotos ascribes the death of Lincoln's sons Eddie, Willie, and Tad, and probably his mother. The mole on Lincoln's right cheek, the asymmetry of his face, his large jaw, his drooping eyelid, and pseudodepression are also suggested as manifestations of MEN2B. MEN2B is a genetic disorder, and recently it has been demonstrated that Lincoln's biological mother, Nancy Lincoln, had many of the same unusual facial features as her son, as well as a marfanoid appearance. Lincoln's longevity is the principal challenge to the MEN2B hypothesis: Lincoln lived long enough to be assassinated at age 56. Untreated MEN2B is generally understood to result in death by the patient's mid-thirties, but there are several reported cases of MEN2B patients surviving into their 50s with no or little treatment. The hypothesis could be proven by DNA testing. Debunked theories Syphilis Claims that Lincoln had syphilis about 1835 have been controversial. Syphilis was a common worry among young men before the introduction of penicillin because syphilis was somewhat common in that era. Physicians likened the fear of syphilis, syphilophobia, to the modern fear of AIDS, which is also deadly and incurable. Writing in 2003, biographer David Donald declared, \\"Modern physicians who have sifted the evidence agree that Lincoln never contracted the disease.\\" For instance, he did not have any of the signs of tertiary syphilis. Physicians suggest that he had syphilophobia. Spinocerebellar ataxia The theory that Lincoln was afflicted with type 5 spinocerebellar ataxia is no longer accepted.

FSU, coached by Bobby Bowden, had a 6-4-1 record going into the bowl game and Indiana, coached by Bill Mallory had a 6‚Äì5 record. Game summary Tailback Sammie Smith had his best game to date as a Seminole, rushing for 205 yards and two touchdowns, as the FSU scored a 27-13 win over Indiana in the 10th annual All-American Bowl. Although FSU was outgained in total yards and time of possession, Indiana seemed to be its own worst enemy, missing four scoring opportunities inside the FSU 31-yard line. The Hoosiers gained 383 yards to the Seminoles' 342 and held on to the ball almost 15 more minutes than FSU. The Hoosiers scored first in the game. After driving 60 yards in 13 plays, Pete Stoyanovich kicked a 35-yard field goal to give his team the 3-0 lead. FSU then opened up it running game and found that its weapon for the evening would be Smith, a redshirt freshman. He ran for 28 yards on four carries and caught a pass for 7 more as the Seminoles moved down field. Capping the drive, Sammie took it in from the 4-yard line. Hoosier lineback Van Waiters blocked the PAT attempt. FSU took a 6-3 lead. Following a missed 47-yard field goal attempt by Stoyanovich, FSU scored on a 9-yard run by Smith. The Seminoles would carry that 13-3 lead into intermission after another Indiana drive stalled with a missed field goal. The Hoosiers had moved to the FSU 5-yard line, but following a penalty and a Terry Warren sack of IU quarterback Dave Kramme, Stoyanovich missed from 41 yards. Florida State made it 20-3 on the first possession of the second half when Smith ran three times for 20 yards and the Holloman brothers, Darrin and Tanner, did the rest. The drive was sparked by a 36-yard reverse by Darrin, while senior fullback Tanner collected 15 yards, including the 8 yard TD. IU came right back on a long drive of its own, but Stoyanovich missed a third time, this time from 49 yards out. The Hoosier defense continued to hold the Seminoles and late in the third period, Indiana made an attempt to get back into the game. First, Tony Buford pulled in a 20-yard pass from Kramme at the FSU 37. Freshman running back Anthony Thompson then gained 17 tough yards on five carries to push the Hoosiers to the FSU 4. Fullback Andre Powell closed the gap to 20-10 with a two-yard plunge at the 1:19 mark of the quarter. Following a Danny McManus interception in the opening minutes of the fourth quarter, Indiana drove 56 yards on 7 plays and a Stoyanovich 30 yard field goal closed the score to 20-13. But FSU put its fans' worries aside, marching right back behind a handful of carries by Smith that netted 44 yards, and scoring on a 10-yard run by Tanner Holloman. For his performance, Smith was awarded the MVP trophy and the Seminoles finished the season with a 7-4-1 record. Indiana finished the season with a 6-6 record.

Wang Ye worship () is a Fujianese and Taiwanese folk religion, frequently considered an aspect of the Taoist belief system. Wang Ye is particularly worshiped in Southern Taiwan. The customary belief is that Wang Ye (), are divine emissaries who tour the world of the living on behalf of the celestial realm, expelling disease and evil from those who worship them. A temple that houses a Wang Ye is generally called ‰ª£Â§©Â∫ú (daitian fu: \\"palace representing heaven\\"), and the Wang Ye's visit is known as (), the object of the \\"hunting\\" being disease and bad luck. Such \\"hunting tours\\" take place on a regular cycle of a set number of years, usually three years. Origins of Wang Ye worship Wang Ye worship stems from belief in two main categories of supernatural beings, both of which are spirits of what were once, according to legend, real human beings. The first category of Wang Ye belief began with the legend of a kind-hearted intellectual who sacrificed himself by committing suicide in a well that contained toxic water, in order to stop the villagers from drinking the well water and thus prevented the pestilence from spreading. Therefore, to stop diseases, like pestilence, from spreading, people would pray and make offerings to those beings who committed their own lives for the public well-being. As time passed by, these great people are honored as Wang Ye and gradually became local Guardian Deities that are able to dispelling epidemic and diseases, and bestow blessings and good fortune. The second category comprises national heroes who are bestowed with the status of Deity by the celestial order of Jade Emperor due to their heroic deeds and great sacrifices in their lives. An example is the spirit of Koxinga, thus honored for his role in defending and protecting Han Chinese against the Qing invading forces in China and the Dutch colonial forces in Taiwan. The Wang Ye There are many Wang Ye: some traditions claim there are a total of 360, with 132 surnames among them. Wang Ye festivals Wang Ye festivals take place in various parts of Taiwan, mostly in the south. They generally involve processions of gods to ward away disease and bring good fortune, and end with the burning or launch of a replica boat. One of the grandest Wang Ye's festivals in Taiwan takes place in Donglong Temple (Êù±Ê∏ØÊù±ÈöÜÂÆÆ) which is located in the city of Donggang, Pingtung County, once every three years. The 2009 festival began on October 10 and culminated in the early morning of October 17, when a wooden boat was set on fire on the beach. The Nankunshen Daitian Temple, considered one of the Wang Ye's founding temple, was built in 1817 and is located in Beimen, Tainan.

It stars Shiloh Fernandez and Noah Segan as teenaged boys who discover a naked, female zombie, played by Jenny Spain. When one of them wants to keep her as a sex slave and the other objects, their friendship is tested. Plot Rickie and J.T. are two high school seniors who gaze at the girls they wish they could get, especially Joann, the object of Rickie's affection, whom he has known since he was a child. One day, they decide to cut class and end up in an abandoned psychiatric hospital. They discover a mute, naked woman in the basement, chained to a table. While J.T. is interested in raping her, Rickie refuses and, after failing to dissuade J.T., leaves but, certain that his story will not be believed, tells no one about the woman. The next day, the two return to the basement where J.T. reveals that the woman is undead, which he discovered after attempting to kill her three times. When Rickie finds that J.T. also invited their friend Wheeler to rape the woman, nicknamed \\"Deadgirl\\", he decides that it is time to free her. He is able to cut the chain on one hand before he hears J.T. and Wheeler approaching. He hides, and J.T. begins to rape her. After he notices that her hand is free, the woman attacks him and scratches his face. Rickie asks Joann out on a date, knowing she has a boyfriend. She rejects him, and Joann's boyfriend Johnny and Johnny's friend Dwyer beat up Rickie and Wheeler. Wheeler rebuts that they \\"have their own pussy now\\" and Johnny throws them in his trunk, and drives to the asylum with Dwyer to see Deadgirl. Rickie convinces Johnny to force Deadgirl to perform oral sex on him, and Deadgirl bites Johnny's penis, infecting him. The next day, Johnny races to the bathroom during class and his intestines burst out of his body, leaving him in the same undead state as Deadgirl. Having figured out that this is an infectious rotting disease, J.T. and Wheeler decide it is time to make a new Deadgirl with a fresh body. They lie in wait outside a gas station for a female victim. After an unsuccessful kidnapping, Joann confronts them about Johnny and they capture her. Rickie heads to the basement with a machete to free Deadgirl and finds Joann and Deadgirl tied up to each other, encircled by J.T. and Wheeler. J.T. tries to convince Rickie to let Joann be bitten while Wheeler starts to feel her up. Rickie defends her by slicing Wheeler's hand off while Joann unties Deadgirl, who feasts on Wheeler and J.T. Rickie and Joann flee but cannot escape through the locked entrance. Rickie runs off to find an escape route, and when he returns, Joann is gone. He returns to the basement, where Deadgirl knocks him down, breaks down the door, and escapes outside. Rickie finds Joann and sees that J.T. has stabbed her in the back. J.T. urges Rickie to let him bite her so she will live undead. Rickie assures Joan that he loves her and will save her. She coughs blood into his face and rejects him again, telling him to \\"grow up,\\" then asks for help. Later, we see a cleanly-dressed Rickie living a normal life. He goes back to the asylum's basement, where, tied up in bed in clean lingerie and romantic lighting, is his Deadgirl, Joann.

Anshumala Gupta, a Delhi- based former mechanical engineer from Indian Institute of Technology, Kanpur, founded the magazine. It targeted children between the age of 9 and 16. The magazine was started in 2004. It touched a circulation of 10,000 copies. Priced at Rs 10, it was one of the most popular magazines among children in Himachal Pradesh, Uttar Pradesh and Uttarakhand. The magazine is supported by Association for India's Development, a non-governmental organisation promoting sustainable, equitable and just development in India. The organisation supports grassroots organizations in India and initiates efforts in various interconnected spheres such as education, livelihoods, natural resources including land, water and energy, agriculture, health, women's empowerment and social justice. About the magazine Indradhanush means rainbow in Hindi and contained stories, poems, articles on science and do-it-yourself experiments. Some of the articles were from popular children's writers from India, while others were adapted and translated from work in other languages. Anshumala, with the help of a network of volunteers, distributed copies of the magazines to schools that pass them down to their students. The aim of the magazine was to build a unique space in children's lives, so that children's love for it made it run, children became first its customers, and then slowly evolved into writers, contributors, critics and editors too. The first and foremost objective of the magazine would be to generate an interest in reading in children who never saw anything good, other than their school books. The magazine must throw challenges to the child's intellect and inquisitiveness. Make the child think and question the natural as well as the social world around him/her. The magazine is not a pure science publication, but one which touches all aspects of life, with the subliminal messages of a scientific and humanitarian spirit.

Geography Location There were four separate villages called Amba, Fatehpur, Bahina and Mallarpur merged to form a small town Mallarpur. A glimpse of the past As one drives to Mallarpur, off the now busy highway, one will see a grand old ruin dominating the landscape for miles around. This is the Kacheri Baari or the Court House. Built in the late 18th century, this building must have been stunning in its heydays. As one enters through a once grand, but now rusted, metal gate, one comes into the front lawn, about 50 yards long. At the end of it, like a giant spider, sits the Kacheri Baari, a haunted house.http://www.m.ndtv.com/video/travel/india-s-most-haunted/inside-a- haunted-house-called-kacheri-badi-203739 There is a \\"Vanavasi Kalyan Ashram Hostel\\" near Amba at Mollarpur beside Ramkrishna Ashram.

Several historic buildings at the camp were placed on the National Register of Historic Places (NRHP) on January 22, 1996. Weedpatch Camp has its origins in the migrations during the drought that caused the Dust Bowl in the mid-1930s. Oklahoma was especially hard hit by the drought and many of the farmers there left. They migrated to California where they moved from farm to farm looking for work as farm laborers. They were joined by other migrant workers from Texas, Arkansas and Missouri. Housing for the migrants consisted of either squatter camps (tents pitched by the side of a road) or camps established by the farmers and growers. Because of the lack of hygiene and security that these types of camps offered, the Farm Security Administration (FSA) built labor camps consisting of permanent buildings with running water such as schools and libraries. The FSA also provided help locating work. The first administrator of Weedpatch Camp was Tom Collins. Between April 1935 and December 1936, the federal government's New Deal Resettlement Administration (RA) had relocated many struggling rural and urban families to planned communities. Weedpatch Camp, however, was constructed by the Works Progress Administration. It was located on the outskirts of the small towns of Arvin and Weedpatch. The camp now is located in an unincorporated area of Kern County just south of Bakersfield. The Library (left) and Post Office (right) buildings were moved and their exteriors restored. The camp originally consisted of canvas tents on plywood platforms for the residents and permanent buildings to house the community functions such as administration, community hall, post office, library and barber shop. Later, the residents' tents were replaced by permanent wood frame shacks. The buildings are single story wood frame structures. There are three buildings remaining from the camp that make up this National Register of Historic Places property: the community hall, the post office, and the library. The latter two buildings were moved next to the community hall to form the beginnings of a historic park on the property. In 2007, the exteriors of the library and post office buildings were renovated.Restoration, Weedpatch Camp, Accessed October 13, 2009. The Weedpatch Camp continues to assist and house migrant workers. The camp is significant in the history of California for the migration of people escaping the Dust Bowl. These migrants were known by the derogatory term of Okie and were the subject of discrimination from the local population. The plight of the Okies and a description of Weedpatch Camp were chronicled by novelist John Steinbeck in his book The Grapes of Wrath. The book is dedicated to camp administrator Collins who was the model for the character called Jim Rawley. Author Sonora Babb worked at the camp under Collins' supervision and wrote Whose Names Are Unknown, a novel depicting the experiences of a migrant family from Oklahoma that went unpublished until 2004 due to her publisher dropping the book shortly after The Grapes of Wrath was released and met with major success. Migrant advocate Dr. Myrnie Gifford revealed in a 1937 Kern County Public Health Department annual report that 25% of the Okies in Arvin Federal Labor Camp tested positive for a disease associated with agricultural dust exposure called \\"valley fever.\\" The camp was subsequently taken over by the Kern County Housing Authority, which administers it as the Sunset Labor Camp to assist migrant farm workers.

Biography Bianca Wallin grew up in Stockholm, Sweden. She was the daughter of the Swedish artist David Wallin (1876‚Äì1957) and his wife Elin Wallin (1884‚Äì1969), Stockholm. Her father got a scholarship, so the family lived in Rome in Italy and in Paris in France for a couple of years and moved back to Stockholm in 1913. From that time on Stockholm became her home city. Her brother was the artist Sigurd Wallin (1916‚Äì1999) and her uncle was the artist Carl E. Wallin (1879‚Äì1968). Her education was influenced by her father's work as an artist and already as a child she learned how to draw. As a daughter in this artistic family Bianca Wallin also early showed her own artistic talents, and she early knew that she wanted to become an artist. In 1935 Bianca Wallin married G√°bor Korn√©l Tolnai (1902‚Äì1982), a Hungarian Diploma Engineer from Budapest. They settled down in Bromma, a borough in the western part of Stockholm, and had three daughters, Eva (born 1939), Monika (born 1942) and Hillevi (born 1944). Studies After High School Exam in 1929 at Nya Elementarskolan for girls ‚Äì Ahlstr√∂mska skolan at Kommend√∂rsgatan 31 in Stockholm she wanted to become an artist. Bianca Wallin began to study for one year, in 1929‚Äì1930, at Edward Berggren and Gottfrid Larsson's Artist School in Stockholm to learn figure painting and drawing. The artist school was situated at Kungsgatan 28 in Stockholm. As teachers at the school Edward Berggren instructed in painting, Gottfrid Larsson in sculpture and Akke Kumlien in materials science. After the year at the preparatory art school she studied for five years, 1930‚Äì1935, at the Swedish Royal Academy of Fine Arts in Stockholm, Sweden, and there she received a genuine art education. Among the teachers at the Academy of Fine Arts were such famous artists as Isaac Gr√ºnewald and Wilhelm Smith in figure drawing and Albert Engstr√∂m in drawing. During the years 1932‚Äì1934, her teacher at the etching school was Emil Johansson-Thor, a painter and graphic artist. Oilpaintings thumb |250px|left|Coastal landscape with rocks in Arild (1946) \\"Travelling is a nice part of life\\", she said. Bianca Wallin liked to travel, because it gave her inspiration, change and a new ability to create. To get motives to paint she travelled a lot both in the north and south of Sweden, Scandinavia and other countries in Europe. She painted motifs from Germany, Hungary, France, the Netherlands, Denmark and Norway. As an artist Bianca Wallin mainly painted in oil, but she was also a drawer and graphic artist. She became very skilful to express what she saw. Her oil paintings were very realistic. Her works included landscapes, figure compositions, still-life pictures, flowers and portraits. She painted subjects from the coast of Scania (\\"Sk√•ne\\") in the south of Sweden, the Swedish Alps in the north of Sweden and the Archipelago. Exhibitions and portraits Prince Gustaf Adolf of Sweden (1939) She also arranged a lot of exhibitions of her own paintings, especially in Stockholm. After that she gained a good reputation and her talents in oil painting made her a name for herself, and she had a successful career. A number of well off people in Stockholm and other cities had commissioned portraits from her. Her skill as a portrait painter was also the reason why she was commissioned to paint a portrait of among others the Swedish Prince Gustaf Adolf in 1939. After some articles in the newspapers, she got the nickname \\"The Prince's Painter\\". Both the portrait in oil and a charcoal-drawing to this portrait are included in the collections of the Swedish King Carl XVI Gustaf. Some other portraits of well off people are now in different official buildings in Sweden. Bianca Wallin painted from early 1930s to late 1990s. Even at the end of the 1990s she was productive and an active artist. She liked to paint and she had a creator's joy in painting. She had a great interest in antiquities and she liked to visit auctions. \\"I will never be a senior citizen\\", she said, because she painted for her quality in life.

Museum The building was restored in 1990 by the Institute of Puerto Rican Culture with the goal of paying tribute to the works of Puerto Rican musicians in the most honorable way possible. The building is easily spotted as it is housed in a pastel-colored villa, intentionally meant to attract visitors. The museum exhibitions are presented in both Spanish and English. The museum building is located at the southeast corner of Isabel and Salud streets. The museum is \\"designed to produce the necessary visual and auditory impact on the audience so as to maximize the potential to draw the actual value of the unique Puerto Rican music\\".

Biography Isabel Bacardit was born in Barcelona, Spain, in 1960. She starts her artistic education at the School of Arts of Poblenou, with Miquel Sim√≥ as her teacher, then moves on to the Escola d‚ÄôArts Aplicades i Oficis Artistics (Llotja) in Barcelona. Starting as an abstract painter, she paints on materials she finds in the street: cardboard, wood, etc. Inspired by urban images, she paints using pigments mixed with sawdust and paper-paste to achieve densities and textures. Her compositions are based on primary colours. In 1984 she is selected for the Fifth Biennale of Barcelona- Young Contemporary Painting. In 1985 she takes part in the First Exhibition of Young Art in Madrid and in the First Biennale of Young Cultural Productions of the European Mediterranean. In 1986 she is again selected for the Second Exhibition of Young Art in Madrid. With the unexpected death of her partner, the painter Xavier Vidal i Banchs in 1984, Bacardit changes the theme of her work, taking inspiration now from the accidental changes of life. She creates a series of works based on The Disasters of War by Goya and paints proceeding from photographs of accidents taken from newspapers. She also changes her palette, turning to dark and earthen colours. In 1986, due to the works in preparation for the 1992 Olympics, her paintings reflect the transformation of Barcelona, taking machines and diggers as her main motives. In 1987 she illustrates the poem Helic√≥n by Bruno Montan√© Krebs.Bruno Montan√© Krebs She travels to Berlin, where she resides for a year.

In 1988 she moves to Mallorca, where she comes in contact with the theatre works of the Polish author Tadeusz Kantor. She creates the portfolio \\"The right to live in peace\\", with paintings inspired by the theatre of this author. In 1989 she takes up residence in Santa Coloma de Farn√©s (Spain). In the midst of nature she changes her themes dramatically. Her work finds inspiration in the landscape, light and silence. She leaves her work on the theme of death, with its dense materiality, behind, moving towards watercolours and transparencies. In 1990 she lives in Rio de Janeiro, where she works with organisations for the welfare of street children, gives painting classes and establishes her studio in the gallery Maria Teresa Vieira. In Salvador de Bahia she exhibits a series of erotic drawings at the University of Fine Arts. In 1991 she arrives in Chile. She exhibits in the gallery Buchi in Santiago de Chile and lives in Valparaiso. She collaborates with various artists: Edgard del Canto (painter),Official website of Edgard del Canto Alma Martinoia (painter), Ivo Vergara (painter), Cristina Correa (painter), Teresa Olivera (actress), Hernan Varela (stained glass artist) and V√≠ctor Barrientos Ormaz√°bal (actor and theatre director).

History Rhode Islanders were violently opposed to the passage of the Sugar Act in 1764, because the colony's main industry was producing rum from molasses. To collect the tax the British sent several ships to New England including . In 1764 crew members on another British ship, HMS St John had allegedly stolen goods from Newport merchants. Therefore, a group of Rhode Islanders took control of Fort George on Goat Island in Newport harbor and fired cannon shots at the British ship. The shots were one of the first open acts of rebellion against the British government in America. The Rhode Islanders were acting under orders from local officials, but dispersed before HMS Squirrel, a twenty-gun ship, arrived at the scene. St John successfully fled the harbor and played a part in moving gunpowder away from Nassau on 4 March 1776 following the amphibious raid on Fort Montagu.

Little River flows adjacent to the community, and the community is framed to the north and south by mountains. The mountains rising from the valley floor on both north and south reach approximately 1,200 feet in elevation, with the mountains behind them reaching approximately 1,600 feet. Major creeks in the immediate vicinity are Wildhorse Creek and Uphill Creek. Roads are few and far between in that part of the Little River valley. Oklahoma State Highway 144 traverses the valley east to west. Other major area roads are owned by the private timber companies operating in the mountains to the north and south. The most significant of these roads are often referred to as \\"highways\\" or \\"trails\\". They are dirt or gravel but are regularly maintained by the timber companies. The roads of most importance in the Fewell are Uphill Bowers Trail, Ferguson Trail, Blackfork Lateral Trail, all to the community's north; and the Nolia Trail to its south.Google Maps.

Throughout her life, she increased awareness around learning disabilities and encouraged for more action to be taken in order to give greater consideration to these individuals. Through the founding of her charity, she cemented this ethos, with the movement for greater aid to be given to those with learning disabilities continuing through the work of Mencap.  Biography  Judy was born Caroline Joyce Manning on 31 October 1909 in Hornsey, London. She went to Minchenden Grammar School before going on to study Economics and Political Science at Ruskin College, Oxford. While at Ruskin College Judy met John Fryd who she later married in 1936 before they moved to Leeds. Both Judy and John were very active members of the Labour Party throughout their lives. They were involved in the creation of the charity that is now known as Mencap. They were also associated with many other charities and organisations. Once relocated to Leeds, Judy and John had four children; Felicity, Patricia, Peter and Linda. Felicity, their oldest (born in 1938), had a learning disability and this sparked Judy‚Äôs realisation that there was no support systems in place in order to help those with learning disabilities along with their families. When Felicity was around three, Judy and John realised that ‚Äòsomething was not quite right‚Äô due to the fact that their daughter wasn‚Äôt able to use her language to communicate in the way that other children her age were. As a result of this, Felicity was taken to the local Child Guidance Clinic where she was assessed. The doctor concluded that Felicity had an IQ of 43 and seemed content to leave the matter there, not offering support or solutions as to how best to help Felicity. After several failed attempts to put Felicity into regular education, Judy managed to get Felicity a month trial at a boarding school for the ‚Äúmentally handicapped‚Äù in Surrey. Yet on the first day, Judy and John were informed that Felicity was not suitable for the school due to her challenging behaviour and requested her to be removed immediately. ‚ÄòJudy was deeply angered and frustrated by the lack of support and provision available‚Äô. As a result of this, in 1946 Judy wrote a letter to Nursery World Magazine asking all parents also having difficulties with a ‚Äúbackward child‚Äù to get in contact. There was a huge response with over 1,000 parents responding and consequently a group was formed of parents who pleaded their cause to local health and education authorities. This group grew into the Association of Parents of Backward Children (APBC), the forerunner of Mencap. Much of what Judy achieved came too late to directly benefit her own daughter, Felicity. Felicity began to realise that she struggled in ways that her brothers and sisters did not and this led to increasingly disturbed behaviour. She was admitted to an ill-suited mental hospital in St Albans at the age of 12 which grouped her with other ‚Äòpsychotic‚Äô individuals who in reality had very different problems to her. These issues persisted until late on in her life as doctors were unable to offer the right support for her needs. Felicity died in 1993 from pneumonia aged 55.  Later Life  During the 1950s and 1960s, the Association of Parents of Backward Children led by Judy advocated the need for support and the potential of people with learning disabilities. This was largely through their magazine ‚ÄòParents‚Äô Voice‚Äô which Judy was the editor of. One key achievement for Judy was a campaign which led to the 1964 Education Act. This reversed the previous stance that children with learning disabilities were ineducable, and provided funding for special needs teaching.

It is produced by Kyoto Animation, written by Fumihiko Shimo and directed by Tatsuya Ishihara and Yasuhiro Takemoto. It was released in Japanese theaters on February 6, 2010 and on DVD and Blu-ray Disc on December 18, 2010. The film has been licensed by Bandai Entertainment in North America and Manga Entertainment in the UK. With a length of 162 minutes, the film is the second-longest animated film ever made (only surpassed by Final Yamato, with its 70mm print release being only one minute longer). Plot Following on from the events of The Melancholy of Haruhi Suzumiya anime television series, the story takes place from December 16 until December 24, a month after the cultural festival. The SOS Brigade, led by Haruhi Suzumiya, makes plans to have a nabe party for Christmas. However, on the morning of December 18, Kyon arrives at school and finds that the very nature of his reality has changed; Haruhi and Itsuki Koizumi are missing, Ryoko Asakura has mysteriously returned, Mikuru Asahina does not recognize him and Yuki Nagato is an ordinary human. Only Kyon is aware that everything is different, and no one else remembers anything about Haruhi or the SOS Brigade. The only clue Kyon manages to find is a bookmark left by the alien version of Yuki before everything was changed, telling him to gather \\"keys\\" to run a program. While wondering about this clue, he gets to know the new Yuki, who appears to be quite fond of him. As December 20 comes, Kyon learns from Taniguchi that Haruhi was at another high school the whole time, along with Itsuki and others formerly from his school. By revealing his identity to her as 'John Smith', an alias he had used when he travelled back in time to assist a young Haruhi, Kyon manages to convince Haruhi to believe his story. With her assistance they gather the SOS Brigade together in the club room, thus bringing the keys necessary for a program built by alien Yuki. Wanting to go back to his interesting life, Kyon activates the program and goes back in time to the Tanabata of three years ago. After meeting up with the future Mikuru, he obtains an uninstall program from the past's Yuki, which needs to be shot at the culprit right after the change in the early hours of December 18. Returning to the present, they find the culprit, Yuki, who had borrowed Haruhi's power to change everyone's memories except Kyon's, giving him the choice of which world he would rather live in. Kyon questions himself about his choice and thinks to himself that a normal world without the SOS Brigade and Haruhi Suzumiya would be calm and peaceful and thinks Yuki was tired of everything she had to do like monitoring Haruhi's behavior and protecting Kyon, but finally decides that his original world was more interesting and fun. Kyon tries to install the program into Yuki but is stabbed by Ryoko, who had retained her psychotic behavior. Before Ryoko can finish him off, he is rescued by future counterparts of Yuki, Mikuru and himself. He wakes up a few days later in a hospital, where the world is back to normal, but almost everyone believes Kyon had been in a coma since December 18 after falling down the stairs. When Yuki mentions to Kyon how the Data Integration Thought Entity would punish her for her actions, Kyon tells her to let them know that if they ever try such a thing, he can tell Haruhi about him being John Smith and have her alter reality so the organization would cease to exist. As December 24 comes and his everyday life returns, Kyon decides there is still time before he has to go back in time to save himself and decides to join in on the Christmas party.

Until statehood the area was part of Wade County in the Apukshunnubbee District of the Choctaw Nation.Morris, John W. Historical Atlas of Oklahoma (Norman: University of Oklahoma, 1986), plate 38. Although the national capital and its stately Choctaw Capitol Building were located only 32 miles away, at Tuskahoma, Honobia was (and remains) isolated.  Geography  Honobia is located on Little River, near its confluences with Honobia Creek and Rock Creek. The community is located in a particularly picturesque part of the Little River valley. The river at this point is a fast-flowing mountain stream, and its narrow valley is framed by steep mountains on both north and south whose summits reach between 1,600 and 1,800 feet in elevation. The mountains are part of the Kiamichi Mountains.Honobia Topo Map in Le Flore County OK Oklahoma State Highway 144 connects Honobia with the rural communities of Fewell, Nolia, and Nashoba on the west‚Äîand with U.S. Highway 271 at Nashoba‚Äîand with the even more sparsely populated Pickens and Battiest areas on the east, and then with U.S. Highway 259. During recent years the Choctaw Nation has improved transportation in the Honobia area significantly by constructing a paved, all-weather road over the mountains from U.S. Highway 271 near Albion south over the steep mountain range to Honobia. Locals refer to this as the \\"Indian Highway.\\" To accomplish its route the Indian Highway travels in a series of switchbacks up the northern side of the mountains and down again on the southern side, allowing for scenic views and vistas.  Economy  Most of the areas to the North and South of Honobia are vast tree plantations owned by timber companies. As such these areas remain wildernesses covering many square miles. Logging provides an important source of jobs for residents. Additionally, locals promote an annual Bigfoot Festival and Conference dedicated to the cryptozoological creature, as popularized locally by an alleged 2000 sighting known as \\"The Siege of Honobia.\\" This is one of the only mainstay economical boosts to the Honobia area.

The canal itself was built during 1666-1681. A critical aspect of the Canal du Midi was the supply of sufficient water to feed the canal. Each boat traversing its length would require a large quantity of water in the locks in order to climb or descend. The original plan was to take water from the Sor River at Revel via the rigole de la plaine and transport it to the Bassin de Naurouze to provide a source of water for the canal. To placate mill owners fearful that they would lose too much water from the Sor, the rigole de la montagne would supplement the Sor upstream from the rigole de la plaine at Conquet. It was to collect water from the Alzau stream, as well as others, and divert them to the River Sor at Conquet. In 1664, Louis Nicolas de Clerville had the idea for a single large dam of the Laudot valley near Saint Ferreol, which became the Bassin de Saint-Ferr√©ol. He also had the idea of digging a tunnel through the Cammazes ridge to connect the rigole de la montagne to the reservoir in the valley without utilizing the Sor river at all. In 1686, the engineer, Marshal Sebastien Vauban, extended the rigole de la montagne from Conquet to connect it to the Bassin de St. Ferr√©ol. The path included a long, diameter tunnel at the village of Les Cammazes. To reduce leakage in some locations, the trench is lined with bricks. Beautiful walking paths accompany the waters flow. The following is translated from the French Wikipedia article of this same name: :The channel begins at the intake of the Alzau (altitude ) to Arfons in the Black Mountains and empties into the rigole de la plaine, which supplies water to the Canal du Midi. The trench collects waters from the southern slope of the Black Mountains. It collects water from different streams, especially Bernassonne, the Alzau, the Lampy, and Rieutord, and the dammed Galaube. It runs south of the reservoir Cammazes (which did not exist at the time of construction of the canal). :A little further south of the village Les Cammazes, the channel changes its slope and passes to the north side. To cross the mountain, it goes through a tunnel masonry arch, the arch of Vauban, also called Breakthrough Cammazes. The tunnel is long and wide. The bridge was designed by the architect Vauban, after the death of Riquet. The front of the exit tunnel was rebuilt in the 18th century. Before the digging of the tunnel, the Rigole Mountain fed the Sor River in Conquet at an altitude of . The Sor was captured by the trickle of the plain near Sor√®ze at the Bridge Crouzet (altitude ). Leaving the Breakthrough Cammazes, the channel flows into the stream of Laudot, which itself feeds the reservoir Bassin de Saint-Ferr√©ol.

The church was built in 1596, one of the first churches to be built in Scotland following the Scottish Reformation in 1560. In 1606, Prestonpans was created a parish in its own right following centuries of being part of the parish of Tranent. There had been a church to the south of Prestonpans, since the 12th century which was administered by the canons of Holyrude Abbey but that church, situated in the vicinity of Northfield House was destroyed by the earl of Hertford in 1544 during the Rough Wooing campaign against the Scots following the Scots' refusal to allow Princess Mary of Scotland. (the to-be Mary, Queen of Scots) marry Henry's son, Prince Edward.  Notable ministers  John Davidson, formerly of Liberton in Edinburgh was appointed first minister at the new church and financed the building of the church out of his own means. The land was gifted by the Hamilton family, the lairds of Preston. The Rev. Davidson was an outspoken man and was never afraid to criticise bishops when the need arose and even criticised the king, James VI of Scots. The good minister spent time in prison in Edinburgh in 1601 and, on his release, was banned from leaving the parish for life. The church, since 1596, has been served by 27 ministers. William Carlyle, father of Jupiter Carlyle, was minister at the time of the Battle of Prestonpans on September 21. 1745 and he wrote a report of the engagement having witnessed it from the church tower. William Cunningham was minister when the churches split in 1843. The Rev. J. Struthers was minister for 45 years around the end of the 19th century and the early 20th century. Moira Herkes was the first lady minister at Prestonpans when she arrived in 1988.  Changes  The church was extensively refurbished in 1774 and again in 1891 forming the edifice we see today. Only the clock tower and some surrounding masonry remains from the original 1596 church; the outline of the original west gable end can still be seen inside the roof. There was a major rift in the Church of Scotland and, in 1843, many of the congregation left the church, then known by its original name, Preston Church. The dissidents eventually built their own church, the Free Church of Scotland, later the United Free Church, in West Loan, just a few hundred yards from Preston Kirk. When the Church of Scotland and the United Free Church reunited in 1929, the former United Free Church congregation took the name Grange Church. Happily, the two congregations re-united in 1981 to form Prestongrange Parish Church. There are many interesting and intriguing grave stones in the kirkyard where a number of former ministers and even soldiers from the Battle of Prestonpans are buried.

This is a rare endemic found only on Kangaroo Island in South Australia.The Plant List Achnophora tatei F.Muell. Description Morphology Roots The rhizome of A. tatei is described as thick, hairless and vertical with bundles of short thick rootlets attached. Leaves A. tatei leaves are in a rosette form at the base of the plant, with a long narrow leaf shape (linear) and sheath at the base of the leaf. Flowers A. tatei flowers take the form of a scape (single flowering stem arising from the rhizome). The flower stems are red, thread-like, almost naked and about as long as the leaves. Flowers are one-headed, have a rosette of bracts (small leaf like structures) surrounding the flower (involucre) which are close to hemispheric (i.e. half of a sphere). The bracts of the flower are generally arranged in three rows of unequal length, with similar grades of size, and range in shape with the bract being egg-shaped with broader end at base (ovate) to the bract being egg-shaped with the narrow end at base (obovate). The bracts are 4 to 5 millimetres long and have dry and membranous margins. The receptacle or floral axis has conspicuous oblong (having a length greater than width) scales between the flowers. The ray-flowers are female in 1 row, with about 25 ligules which are narrow, blue and are an estimated 10 millimetres long. Disc-flowers are tubular,with the style-branches being slender (capillary). Anthers (pollen bearing structure which is part of the stamen) are blunt and rounded (obtuse) at the base. Taxonomy Etymology Achnophora tatei is commonly known as the Kangaroo Island Daisy. The genus name Achnophora is derived from the Greek word 'achne' which means chaff and 'phoros' meaning bearing. This refers to the clearly visible scales of the receptacle and pappus. Tatei is named after Ralph Tate (1840-1901), a British born botanist and geologist, who was a Professor of Natural Science at the University of Adelaide. Distribution and Habitat A. tatei is found along the south coast of Kangaroo Island, South Australia. The species is found in wet, swampy places. Conservation Achnophora tatei has been classified as a vulnerable species by the South Australian Government due to a restricted distribution and the impacts of increasing salinity.

The race was the counterpart to the Garden State Futurity for two-year-old male horses. In the early 1970s, growing competition from Keystone Racetrack in nearby Bensalem Township, Pennsylvania caused a sharp decline in revenues at Garden State Park which resulted in cancellation of the 1973 fall racing season. A fire destroyed the racetrack on April 14, 1977 and the Gardenia Stakes was shifted to the Meadowlands Racetrack at East Rutherford, New Jersey.

Principles of Development. Oxford University Press, 2002 Background  Differences to epigenetic  Morphogenetic robotics is related to, but differs from, epigenetic robotics. The main difference between morphogenetic robotics and epigenetic robotics is that the former focuses on self- organization, self-reconfiguration, self-assembly and self-adaptive control of robots using genetic and cellular mechanisms inspired from biological early morphogenesis (activity-independent development), during which the body and controller of the organisms are developed simultaneously, whereas the latter emphasizes the development of robots' cognitive capabilities, such as language, emotion and social skills, through experience during the lifetime (activity-dependent development). Morphogenetic robotics is closely connected to developmental biology and systems biology, whilst epigenetic robotics is related to developmental cognitive neuroscience emerged from cognitive science, developmental psychology and neuroscience.

Jumbo is located at .  History  A United States Post Office was established for Jumbo, Indian Territory on November 8, 1906. The post office took its name from the Jumbo Asphalt Company, a prominent local employer.George H. Shirk, Oklahoma Place Names, p. 113; Post Office Site Location Reports, Record Group 28, National Archives. Prior to Oklahoma's statehood, Jumbo was located in Jack's Fork County, a part of the Pushmataha District of the Choctaw Nation, in the Indian Territory.Morris, John W. Historical Atlas of Oklahoma (Norman: University of Oklahoma, 1986), plate 38. Jumbo was blessed by abundant natural resources, including asphalt. Hugh W. Adams (ca. 1836-1905), one of the original pioneers of Antlers, Oklahoma, and a prospector, located the asphalt vein at Jumbo.Antlers News, November 17, 1905. The Jumbo Asphalt Company established mining operations there and, by 1904, the community was known as Jumbo Mines.Antlers News, October 28, 1904. By 1905 the company was mining up to eight tons of asphalt per day, which it shipped to Moyers, Oklahoma via a dedicated tram line.Antlers News, February 3, 1905. The line stretched from Jumbo south through the Impson Valley, rounding the foot of Parker Mountain into Moyers, where it connected with the railhead at the St. Louis and San Francisco Railway. By 1906, Jumbo Mines was home to at least 40 families.Antlers News, May 11, 1906. This remained the case through recent decades, when the countryside around Jumbo emptied due to lack of economic opportunities and its churches, school, and post office closed. In November 1910, Jumbo was site of a horrible accident. The mine‚Äîwhose shaft was 280 feet deep, at which point it branched several hundred feet to the north‚Äîexperienced a lethal explosion. At least 14 miners were killed, and more died later of wounds. Several miners were blown up the shaft and out the mouth of the mine. Ten of the miners were buried side by side in the Jumbo Cemetery. At the time of the explosion, the mine was owned by the Choctaw Asphalt Company of St. Louis, Missouri. It continued to operate for years; today the mouth of its shaft is capped but may still be seen off the Jumbo Road.Antlers News, December 2, 1910. During the Great Depression the Works Progress Administration built a handsome public school at Jumbo. The school was built using native \\"red rock\\" gathered from nearby fields. The school still partially stands, although the back half was bulldozed during the 1990s by a local landowner for safety reasons, who cleared the land for cattle to graze. Jumbo's Impson family cemetery grave markers have been lost. Immediately prior to World War II a local farmer gathered the tombstones, stacked them under a tree, and ploughed the property for use as a field. The property today is overgrown with bois d'arc trees and difficult to access.Recollection of Kay Brown Black, local resident. During World War II Jumbo and Moyers were the site of mishaps with international repercussions, two of them fatal. British pilots operating from a Royal Air Force base in Texas, hampered by poor weather, crashed into White Rock Mountain and Big Mountain above Moyers, killing four crew men. Two planes were destroyed. A third plane crash-landed successfully at Jumbo, in a field known locally as the Bedford meadow owned by farmer and rancher Bill Perrin. Its pilot, John Wall, and navigator, \\"Wilbur\\" Wright, were unhurt and were kept overnight by a local family, Mr. and Mrs. E.F. Jordan. British military officers soon retrieved the airplane, which was salvageable. On February 20, 2000 the AT6 Monument was dedicated in the fliers' honor at the crash site on Big Mountain. Wall and Wright also attended, and had a happy reunion with the Perrin family. Over 1,000 people attended the ceremony, and the story was carried by the British Broadcasting Corporation and many newspapers around the world. More information on Jumbo and the Impson Valley may be found in the Pushmataha County Historical Society.  Geography  Jumbo is located in the picturesque Impson Valley. Buck Creek and Box Springs mountains frame the eastern side of its valley, and Long Mountain frames the western side. In recent years the territory to the west of Jumbo has been incorporated into McGee Creek State Park, particularly the area of Wildcat and Bugaboo canyons.  Transportation  Despite improvements in the local roadways, Jumbo remains physically isolated from other communities in Pushmataha and Atoka counties. This is ironic, as the four-lane Indian Nation Turnpike was built through Impson Valley, passing just to the east of the community, and opened in 1970. It features no interchange for Jumbo, however, causing local residents to venture to Daisy on the north to enter or exit the turnpike.

It became inactive on May 29, 1944. Purpose During World War I, the airplane was not generally used as a long- range fighting machine. However, during the period from 1919 to the start of World War II, the heavy bomber was created, capable of ranging far from its home base and carrying a lethal load of high explosives. It soon became clear that a warning system was needed to protect against this new threat. Technology at the outset of World War II consisted of mechanical sound detectors that were found to be inadequate to the job. It was also argued that while soldier lookouts would be valuable, their use would detract from other needed military operations.Aircraft Warning Service Volunteer, June 1944 Creation The answer was found in calling on civilian volunteers to act as airplane spotters. With the help of the American Legion, volunteers were organized in May 1941 into the Aircraft Warning Service, the civilian arm of the Army's Ground Observer Corps. On the east coast, the AWS was under the auspices of the Army Air Force's 1st Interceptor Command (later First Fighter Command or I Fighter Command) based at Mitchel Field, New York. On the west coast, the AWS was under the auspices of the 4th Interceptor Command (later Fourth Fighter Command or IV Fighter Command) based in Riverside, California. On both coasts, observation posts, information centers and filter centers were established. The United States entered World War II on Dec 7, 1941. Many of those who could not join the military for whatever reason were recruited to the AWS. Statistically, this led to a preponderance of women, apparent in the surviving material, but seemingly little recognized. Training All observers received extensive training in aircraft recognition. This training was so successful that it spilled over into the non-AWS population. Aircraft recognition became a significant hobby providing many with thousands of hours of entertainment and spawning many books and publications, including flashcards, on the subject. Many participated in contests and recognition \\"Bees\\". Recognition clubs and meeting flourished becoming a major social phenomenon of the day. Of significant note to the training effort was the use of black, hard rubber, spotter models for various aircraft. Today, often mistaken for poor quality toys, these models can be worth hundreds of dollars and need to be preserved as part of AWS history. As the war escalated, thousands of observation posts were established on the east coast from the top of Maine to the tip of Florida, and roughly inland as far as the western slopes of the Appalachian Mountains. On the west coast, posts ranged from upper Washington to lower California. Each post had its own code name and number. When aircraft were spotted, the volunteers would record their observations on forms or in log books and then quickly place a call to a regional Army Filter Center and verbally deliver a \\"Flash Message\\" which contained the organized data from the observation. One can imagine that aircraft approaching the coast would be spotted by multiple posts, resulting in multiple Flash Messages and, therefore, a reasonably accurate triangulation of position, speed, direction, altitude, etc. The training and intense watching bore dramatic fruit in the autumn of 1943 when observers at a post in West Palm Beach, Florida, saw and reported instantly the passage of a German aircraft bearing American markings over their post. The fact that the plane was one that had been captured in Europe and was being flown back to this country for examination detracted not one bit from the effectiveness of the recognition instruction. At the peak of operation, the Aircraft Warning Service of the First Fighter Command numbered some 750,000 individuals, of whom about 12,000 were in information and filter centers. Practice interceptions, run almost daily provided significant experience to ground officers and pilots working under simulated combat conditions. Because of its huge scope of operations on the East Coast it was able to save the lives of many young pilots by bringing speedy aid to those whose planes had crashed. A detailed account of life in an east coast observation post is offered by author Meade Minnigerode in his book, Essex Post, of which only 175 copies were published in 1944 by the Yale University Press. Information and Filter Centers To process the data from the observation posts, Information and Filter Centers were established in strategic, but secret, locations on both coasts. The Army called on Mrs. Adelaide Rickenbacker, wife of Capt. Eddie Rickenbacker of World War I fame to assist in recruiting for the centers. The bulk of the center personnel were women drawn from the ranks of housewives, office workers, actresses, entertainers, and executives. In the summer of 1943, the center volunteers were given a name ‚Äì Aircraft Warning Corps (AWC). Center personnel represented the information from the flash messages designations on markers placed on large regional plotting maps in windowless rooms. From balconies overlooking these maps, officers of the Army, including the Army Air Force, and Navy watched the flights moving across the boards. To plot these flights, to staff the battery of telephones and to transmit information from filter rooms to operation rooms and from one filter center to another volunteers worked 24 hours a day. Merit awards In the summer of 1943, a system of awards for services performed and outstanding accomplishments was established. There were elaborate awards ceremonies for those who \\"earned their wings\\" and Merit Awards for those who contributed thousands of hours. In addition to wings and merit awards, there were numerous printed certificates of award and appreciation. Normal insignia included arm bands for Observers and Chief Observers and the rare AWC patch for filter center workers.Personal collection of Larry Frederick Media On the east coast, to coordinate the interest of the volunteers and to provide a medium for important news and training information, the \\"Observation Post,\\" a semi- monthly publication of the Ground Observer Corps, was started in March 1942. This four page black and white newsletter gave way to a full-fledged monthly magazine, \\"Aircraft Warning Volunteer\\" in June 1943. The original editor was Capt. Frederick W. Pederson. The last publication was a commemorative issue in June 1944. On the west coast, The National Broadcasting Company hosted a famous 30 minute weekly radio broadcast, \\"Eyes, Aloft!\\" that provided similar AWS information over the air from August 17, 1942, to November 10, 1943, some 61 episodes. A principal actor was Henry Fonda.The Digital Deli, Eyes, Aloft! Disbandment On March 31, 1944, the IV Fighter Command was disbanded. On May 16, 1944, Henry L. Stimson, Secretary of War, wrote in a letter announcing the coming inactivation of the GOC, AWC and AWS, \\"This does not mean that the War Department is of the opinion that all danger of enemy bombing has passed. On the contrary, a small-scale sneak raid is still within the capabilities of our enemies. We must win this war in Europe and Asia, however, and the calculated risk we are assuming in reducing our air defense measures is justified by the offensive power we will thereby release.\\" With no fighters to scramble, no observers were necessary so inactivation was announced on May 29, 1944. On June 6, 1944, the allies invaded Europe.Letter from Henry L. Stimson, March 31, 1944 On May 27, 1944, Col. Stewart W. Towle, Jr. Commander of the Air Corps, wrote, \\"I want to express my personal appreciation and that of all the officers and men of this command to the volunteers who have served so loyally and efficiently with us in defense of the eastern seaboard. ... Your country, the Army Air Force, and your fellow Americans owe a debt of gratitude to the members of the Aircraft Warning Service.\\"Letter from Col. Stewart W. Towle, Jr. May 27, 1944.

Prior to Oklahoma's statehood Kiamichi was located in Wade County, Choctaw Nation.Morris, John W. Historical Atlas of Oklahoma (Norman: University of Oklahoma, 1986), plate 38. During the 1880s, the St. Louis-San Francisco Railway, more popularly known as the ‚ÄúFrisco‚Äù, built a line from north to south through the Choctaw Nation, connecting Fort Smith, Arkansas with Paris, Texas. The railroad paralleled the Kiamichi River throughout much of its route in present-day Pushmataha County. Train stations were established every few miles to aid in opening up the land and, more particularly, to serve as the locations of section houses. Supervisors for their respective miles of track lived in the section houses to administer the track and its right-of-way. These stations also served as points at which the trains could draw water. The site of Kiamichi was selected because of its proximity to the Kiamichi River, with its abundant water supply. Adjacent station stops were established to the north and south. The sparsely populated area, at that time known as Jack‚Äôs Fork County of the Choctaw Nation, in the Indian Territory, was home to Choctaw Indians who farmed or subsisted on the land. Few roads or trails existed. Transportation was provided by the Frisco Railroad, which offered six trains per day‚Äîthree in each direction‚Äîuntil it closed to passenger traffic during the late 1950s. It continued freight operations until 1981, when it closed altogether and its rails were removed. The loss of passenger rail coincided with the paving of U.S. Highway 271. Pushmataha County, during its early decades, was home to prosperous cotton farming industry and other agricultural pursuits. Cotton farming had taken place around Kiamichi since territorial times, and a sizable African-American population came to live there. In later decades, with the eclipse of cotton and other agriculture to cattle ranching, the African- American population departed for elsewhere, generally to the south, in search of greater social and economic opportunities. More information on Kiamichi, its former African-American residents, and the Kiamichi River valley may be found in the Pushmataha County Historical Society.

Approximately 28,000 lawyers are members of the ISBA. Unlike some state bar associations, in which membership is mandatory, ISBA membership is not required of lawyers licensed to practice in Illinois and ISBA membership is completely voluntary. The ISBA is headquartered in Springfield, Illinois. It also has an office in Chicago, Illinois. History The ISBA was founded on January 4, 1877, at a meeting held in the Sangamon County Courthouse in Springfield, Illinois, attended by 88 lawyers from 37 counties. According to the association‚Äôs constitution adopted at that time, the purpose of the association is: This first meeting elected Anthony Thornton as first president of the ISBA. In 1879, the ISBA gained notoriety after it granted honorary membership to Myra Bradwell and Ada Kepley after they were denied admission to the bar on the grounds that they were women. Responding to a request from the Supreme Court of Illinois on how to improve the quality of Illinois lawyers, in 1897 the ISBA and the Chicago Bar Association recommended that the court require lawyers to have at least a high school education; they also recommended creating what would become the Illinois Board of Admissions to the Bar. The Illinois Supreme Court accepted both recommendations. The ISBA would later lead a crusade against the unauthorized practice of law; in 1931, they brought a suit against People‚Äôs Stock Yards State Bank in which they persuaded the Illinois Supreme Court to declare that it had the inherent authority to punish anyone who practiced law without a law license. The ISBA spent decades lobbying for reform of Illinois' civil procedure, and this ultimately paid off in 1933, when the Illinois General Assembly passed the Civil Practice Act of 1933. In 1962, the ISBA led a campaign to change the judicial article of the Illinois Constitution. The ISBA also played a large role in developing the current Illinois Criminal Code (1961) and Illinois Code of Criminal Procedure (1963). In the 1970s and 1980s, the ISBA lobbied successfully to have Illinois adopt a regime of no-fault divorce and for independent administration of decedents' estates. The ISBA also played a role in creating the Illinois Institute for Continuing Legal Education, the Client Security Fund of the Bar of Illinois, the Lawyers‚Äô Assistance Program, and the Lawyers Trust Fund. Organization and activities The ISBA is currently divided into 40 substantive law divisions, allowing ISBA members the opportunity to meet other lawyers who practice in the same field. Each section publishes a newsletter to keep its members aware of substantive changes in the field of law. The sections also offer continuing legal education services for members. One of these sections, the Young Lawyers Division, is for lawyers 36 years old and younger, and is designed to give young lawyers an opportunity to meet and discuss issues peculiar to younger practitioners. The ISBA operates 26 standing committees and several special committees, councils, and task forces created by either the Assembly or the Board of Governors (see below for more information about the Assembly and Board of Governors). Each committee consists mainly of members appointed by the ISBA president. These committees study issues facing the legal community and make recommendations to the ISBA Assembly. The association sponsors a number of online and print publications, including: the Illinois Bar Journal, dozens of section newsletters, the Illinois Courts Bulletin, and its blog Illinois Lawyer Now. Members also receive E-Clips, a daily email newsletter summarizing legal news and case updates. Other ISBA highlights include: * Member benefits, including: Fastcase online legal research service, On-Demand online CLE courses, automated legal form builder IllinoisBarDocs, an online Career Center, an online Lawyer Referral Service, meeting space in its Chicago and Springfield offices, and the ability to purchase malpractice insurance through the ISBA Mutual Insurance Company. * Legal resources for the public, including: consumer guides covering dozens of legal issues and an online lawyer search tool called IllinoisLawyerFinder. *Awards recognizing professional achievement in the legal profession, the most prestigious of which is the ISBA Laureate Award. The Illinois State Bar Association‚Äôs Academy of Illinois Lawyers was founded in 1999 to recognize those who personify excellence in the legal profession. The Laureate Award, the Academy‚Äôs highest honor, is awarded to those deemed to exemplify the highest ideals of the profession. * Its charitable wing, the Illinois Bar Foundation that promotes pro bono work and other legal work in the public interest. The association also administers the annual ISBA High School Mock Trial Invitational, a mock trial tournament for high school students, with the winning team representing Illinois at the National High School Mock Trial Championship. The ISBA's supreme policy making body is the ISBA Assembly. The Assembly has 203 lawyer members elected on a pro rata basis from the judicial circuits. The Assembly routinely meets twice a year. It has taken positions on a number of important matters, including repeal of the death penalty in Illinois, support of civil unions, and support of U.S. ratification of the Convention to Eliminate All Forms of Discrimination Against Women (CEDAW). Between meetings of the Assembly, the ISBA is governed by a 27-member Board of Governors, which oversees the operations and management of ISBA and is subject to policies set by the 203-member Assembly. The Board of Governors is headed by the president of the ISBA. The president is elected by the Assembly.

Miller is located in southern Impson Valley, and lies at the southern foot of Long Mountain, which is to its west. Ten Mile Creek rises on Long Mountain, and it, along with its tributaries, water the floor of the valley, causing Miller to be excellently suited for cattle operations.Google Maps. Originally called Warren‚Äôs Store, the community took its name from its first commercial establishment, a store operated by Major W.J. Warren, a Confederate Army veteran who was a prominent local citizen during the waning days of the Indian Territory. As Dr. Miller‚Äôs cattle operations came to define the area, its name gradually shifted to what it is known as today. Prior to Oklahoma statehood, Miller was located in Jack‚Äôs Fork County of the Choctaw Nation. Its county seat‚ÄîMany Springs, located at present-day Daisy‚Äîwas to the north of Miller.Morris, John W. Historical Atlas of Oklahoma (Norman: University of Oklahoma, 1986), plate 38.

Durham is remembered for a controversial speech given in 1974 about Freemasonry and the Latter Day Saint movement. Biography Durham was born in Long Beach, California. He was one of the four children of Reed C. Durham, Sr. and Violet E. Cottrell. His father was a professor at Utah State University in Logan, Utah and served as bishop in the LDS Church three times. As a young man, Reed Jr. served as an LDS missionary for two years. Durham married Faye Lenore Davis and they began having children while he attended college in Logan. Education Having earlier attended school in California, Durham's higher education was in Utah. He received his M.S. from the Department of Speech at Utah State Agricultural College in 1957 (the year it became Utah State University), followed by his Ph.D. in history from Brigham Young University (BYU) in 1965, writing his dissertation on the Joseph Smith Translation of the Bible. Historian Donald Q. Cannon considered Durham's dissertation part of the \\"major scholarly contribution to the study of Mormon history\\" that occurred during the 1960s. Church Educational System Durham began teaching for the Church Educational System (CES) in 1955 while attending school in Logan. After receiving his master's degree, he stayed in Logan and in 1958 became associate director of the LDS Church's Institute of Religion adjacent to Utah State University. He was elected as a national vice president of Lambda Delta Sigma, the LDS fraternity, in 1959. By 1966 he was associate director of the Institute adjacent to the University of Utah in Salt Lake City, where he would serve for years as Institute Director and coordinator of Seminaries and Institutes throughout the Salt Lake Valley. Durham has taught religion at BYU and in 1972 he was awarded the Division Faculty Teaching Award by the BYU Division of Continuing Education. In addition to his church employment, Durham served in various ecclesiastical positions. For a time he taught Sunday school in his local ward (congregation) and he also was a member of the Sunday School General Board, planning and overseeing the church-wide Sunday School program. He also served in various auxiliaries and in two stake high councils. Historical community Durham was active in the historical community. In the 1960s he was involved with the Organization of American Historians. In 1970 Durham was one of several prominent LDS historians forming a committee that consulted the creation of the LDS Church Historical Department. Durham was an early supporter of Sunstone magazine, which was founded in 1974 by a former student. In 1974 Durham took a year off as Institute Director to work on a book in the church's 16-volume sesquicentennial history to be published in 1980. In the Mormon History Association (MHA) Durham served as its eighth president, from 1973‚Äì74, and second executive secretary, from 1969‚Äì71. While he was president, the MHA launched the Journal of Mormon History, whose inaugural issue received criticism from some CES personnel for an article by Jan Shipps about Joseph Smith. In 1974 he delivered a controversial presidential speech to the MHA which startled the LDS historical community, causing Durham to issue a letter of clarification and withdraw from future participation in the MHA. Later life After his year of research ended, Durham was offered the choice of returning as the Director of the Salt Lake Institute or a promotion to area director of LDS educational programs. He turned both down so he could focus on research and full-time Institute teaching, which he did for years. By 1991 Durham had been living in Logan, Utah where he still taught for CES. In 1994https://archive.org/stream/historyofbyuseme1994andr/historyofbyuseme1994andr_djvu.txt and 1995 he taught at BYU's travel study program in Nauvoo, Illinois, and he was a service missionary at Brigham Young University‚ÄìHawaii from 1996 to 1999. In 2009 he taught a class on the Book of Mormon to single adults in Providence, near Logan. 1974 Nauvoo speech At the Mormon History Association (MHA) conference in Nauvoo, Illinois, on April 20, 1974, Durham delivered his presidential address on the connections of Mormonism and Freemasonry, entitled \\"Is There No Help for the Widow's Son?\\". During a thunder storm that day, Durham discussed Masonic parallels with the LDS priesthood, the Masonic Enoch Legend, the occultic Jupiter Medallion attributed to Joseph Smith, and Masonic elements in Mormon temple design and ceremony. About the temple ceremony, Durham famously stated: > There is absolutely no question in my mind that the Mormon ceremony which > came to be known as the Endowment, introduced by Joseph Smith to Mormon > Masons initially, just a little over one month after he became a Mason, had > an immediate inspiration from Masonry. This is not to suggest that no other > source of inspiration could have been involved, but the similarities between > the two ceremonies are so apparent and overwhelming that some dependent > relationship cannot be denied. Durham said he was attempting to raise questions and he appealed to the historical community to clarify Joseph Smith's relationship to folk magic and Masonry, rather than burying their heads \\"in the traditional sand\\".\\"Arrington's optimism regarding honest discussion of Mormon history was tested in 1974 when Reed Durham, director of the LDS Institute of Religion at the University of Utah, presented a presidential address at the annual conference of the Mormon History Association in Nauvoo, Illinois. In his paper, Durham explored Joseph Smith's links with Masonry and his possession of a magical Jupiter talisman. Negative repercussions following Durham's appeal for an open discussion of the influence of folk magic and Masonry on Mormonism led to his public apology and reaffirmation of faith. The backlash which caused some Mormons to question Durham's faith continued in a number of public speeches made by Ezra Taft Benson in 1976 during which he criticized efforts to revise traditional interpretations of the history of his church.\\" Reaction Jan Shipps said the speech ignited an explosion, leaving attendees in a \\"tension-filled aftershock\\". It was the only time she saw Leonard J. Arrington angry, who had worked for years to open the church archives and now feared they would be closed. The next day, the Nauvoo Visitors' Center removed a Nauvoo Temple weather vane display, which Durham had shown in slides for its Masonic symbols.Melvin B. Hogan wrote, \\"I have been informed that the particular [weather vane] illustration referred to, in the Visitors' Center, had been removed when the Center opened the next morning.\\" The speech seemed to support critics who wanted to discredit Mormonism.\\"The anti-Mormon community was overjoyed at this presentation, while Dr. Durham's LDS colleagues were stunned and called his faith and good sense into question.\\" The Tanners, LDS critics, wrote, \\"We feel that Dr. Durham's identification of Joseph Smith's talisman is one of the most significant discoveries in Mormon history and that he should be commended for his research.\\" Durham's leaders were upset and he was rumored to have been disciplined. Durham denied that his church membership was ever threatened and he was even offered a promotion with CES, where he continued his career. The church had asked him \\"to do no more with the subject again\\" and \\"not to release information\\" and he declined public comment. His paper went unpublished and he ceased involvement in the MHA. Letter After friends and colleagues criticized his conclusions and questioned his faith, Durham circulated a letter to all participants.\\"Reed Durham was severely criticized by Mormon scholars and officials for giving this speech.\\" He stated that he had been misunderstood by not incorporating his faith into the speech. He reasserted his belief in Joseph Smith, the temple ceremonies and divine revelation. Many saw this as an apology.. Reprint of January 14, 2006 article.Durham \\"finally found it necessary to issue a letter in which he reaffirmed his faith in Joseph Smith and said that he was sorry for the 'concerns, and misunderstandings' that the speech had caused.\\" LDS writer Matthew B. Brown asserted that Durham's letter admitted to limited research and insufficient skill and knowledge.\\"From his letter we learn that (1) Dr. Durham had spent only a few months in researching his subject, (2) he was 'not skillful' in handling his material, and (3) he was not sufficiently 'erudite' in the matter. ... Erudition is defined as 'knowledge acquired by study or research,' in Random House Webster's Dictionary, 1996 ed., 221.\\" \\"Reed Durham admitted that his misconceptions about the temple came from a lack of learning.\\" Legacy Durham's speech became famous and made him into \\"a kind of pivotal figure in the Mormon (LDS) Church\\". It is still cited by critics of the Mormon temple rites, though his colleague Gilbert W. Scharffs believes Durham's statements have been exaggerated.\\"[The God Makers]' overdramatized account [of Durham's speech] is grossly exaggerated. In effect Durham merely said, 'Although we all know of Joseph Smith's association with Masonry, here's information that he was involved to a greater extent than what we have known.' ... Dr. Durham also told me he was trying to play the 'devil's advocate' in his Nauvoo speech, which is what many there, including myself, sensed. Unfortunately others took the words to further their purposes.\\" While Durham didn't publish his paper, unauthorized transcripts were made and circulated as the \\"underground presidential address\\", though Durham's notes and citations were absent.\\"Buerger gets this idea from Reed Durham's 'Widow's Son' lecture, but in his footnote he fails to tell readers exactly where Durham's quotation can be found. None of Reed Durham's transcribed comments are supported by any references, but they deserve to be scrutinized nevertheless.\\" Looking back during the 1980s, Durham privately wished he had presented some material differently, noting that the evidence for the Jupiter Talisman was actually quite weak. Matthew B. Brown claimed that Durham had abandoned his speech's claims.\\"But in recent years a number of publications have sprung up on the fringes of Mormonism that champion the very same anti- Mormon theory abandoned by Dr. Durham.\\" The speech is seen as one factors in the LDS Church's waning tolerance toward open and revisionist history during the 1970s and 1980s. It is thought to be one reason CES began to discourage its faculty from involvement in the MHA. Some Mormon historians, such as D. Michael Quinn, built upon the speech to argue that early Mormonism was heavily influenced by folk magic. Jan Shipps believed the speech was part of Mark Hofmann's inspiration in creating the Salamander Letter, a hoax document which seemed to support Quinn's and Durham's work linking Joseph Smith's religious experiences with \\"magic\\". Historical approach Durham was known for his unorthodox approach and research into LDS history and controversy.Durham obtained a statement by Bruce R. McConkie, which was later circulated, about the physical conception and birth of Adam. Durham's description the contested 1886 John Taylor revelation on polygamy has been used by Mormon fundamentalists to defend the validity of that revelation. Scott Kenney, one of Durham's Institute students who would later found Sunstone magazine, was inspired to study theology and teach Institute because of Durham's classroom explorations of controversial issues in a historical context, which highlighted the humanistic elements of the church. Despite his position as a local religious teacher for the church in his area, Durham was on good terms with Jerald and Sandra Tanner, well-known opponents of Mormonism, and was known to have purchased materials from them. In a 1972 speech he explained how he is motivated by the Tanner's criticisms: > I can't help but think that when they raise these issues it does something > to us to have to defend... When I see something that counters what I've been > taught or what I know or what I understand or what I feel, the way to > counter research...unpleasant to me is not by sticking my head in the sand > like an ostrich, but by more research. I may have to revamp, and knowledge > sometimes is a dangerous thing. But I will revamp, and I will understand > better my heritage. ...what I'm trying to say is that they have become, in a > sense, catalysts to sharpen our own historical understanding. We've had to > get on the stick and do some study, and do some homework that sometimes we > haven't done. In 1992, Durham remembered explaining to Sandra Tanner how he reconciled LDS historical controversies with his faith in the 1960s: > I explained to Sandra that I look at revelation as a process and that line > upon line a church or a prophet or anyone for that matter can learn and > improve. I told her that we all make mistakes and errors and said, 'But > Sandra, you look at it differently. If you find one little mistake with a > church or a prophet you believe they cannot be of God. I see a process of > growing and learning. God sometimes has trouble helping us because of our > limitations, not his. Oh sure, he could coerce us, but he doesn't and so we > can only progress as fast as our limitations let us.' His colleague Gilbert W. Scharffs said, \\"I have seldom found a man with a firmer conviction of Jesus Christ and the LDS Church. There are few in the LDS Church who have a deeper knowledge of LDS history and doctrine than Reed C. Durham, Jr.\\" Works ;Books . In 1972 the LDS Church planned a new sixteen-volume sesquicentennial history to be published in 1980, and Durham was commissioned to write the volume on the crossing of the Great Plains. However, these contracts were all canceled in 1981 and Durham's volume was never published, though he did write an article on the subject for the Encyclopedia of Mormonism and two journal articles on the Mormon pioneer sojourn in Iowa. ;Papers *. *. *. *. *.

Files produced by modern flow cytometers are written in the Flow Cytometry Standard format with an .fcs file extension. FlowJo will import and analyze cytometry data regardless of which flow cytometer is used to collect the data. Operation In FlowJo, samples are organized in a \\"Workspace\\" window, which presents a hierarchical view of all the samples and their analyses (gates and statistics). Viewing an entire experiment in a Workspace permits organizing and managing complex cytometry experiments and produces detailed graphical reports. FlowJo's ability to automate repetitive operations facilitates the production of statistics tables and graphical reports when the experiment involves many samples, parameters and/or operations. Within a workspace, samples can be grouped or sorted by various attributes such as the panel of antibodies with which they are stained, tissue type, or patient from whom they came. When an operation on a group is initiated, FlowJo can perform the same operation on every sample belonging to that group. Thus, you can apply a gate to a sample, copy it to the group, and that gate will be automatically placed on all samples in the group. FlowJo provides tools for the creation of histogram and other plot overlays, cell cycle analysis. calcium flux analysis, proliferation analysis, quantification, cluster identification and backgating display Development FlowJo became a commercial product in 1996.

He has been a member of the Democratic Party of the Northern Mariana Islands in the past, but is running for Governor of the Northern Mariana Islands in 2009 as an independent, with Representative Joe Camacho as his running mate. Biography Personal life Juan Pan Guerrero was born on December 10, 1949, at the United States Naval Hospital, in Maturana Hill, Saipan. He was the sixth of the twelve children of parents, Herman Reyes Guerrero and Maria Camacho Tenorio. Guerrero attended Mt. Carmel School on Saipan for elementary school. He attended high school at both Father Due√±as Memorial School, a Roman Catholic school for boys in Guam, and Rhodes Preparatory School in New York City. Guerrero also enrolled at Miami Dade Junior College and the Nebraska Business College for college. He resides in Gualo Rai, Saipan, the Northern Mariana Islands. Career Guerrero is the president of chairman of several CNMI based businesses, including Juan T. Guerrero & Associates, Inc. since 1991, the president and general manager of Herman's Modern Bakery, Inc. since 1972, and the president of the Insurance & Business Management Corporation since 1982. Guerrero was elected to the Northern Mariana Islands House of Representatives, where he served from 1984 to 1985 during the 4th Commonwealth Legislature. During his time in the House, Guerrero served as the chairman on the CNMI House Committee on Appropriations. He was later elected to the Northern Mariana Islands Senate from 1986 to 1990 during the 5th and 6th Commonwealth Legislatures. He was a member of the Committee on Resources and Economic Development and the Special Investigatory Committee while in the Senate. Juan Pan Guerrero was appointed to a four-year term on the Northern Mariana Islands Retirement Fund board of trustees in December 2006. He was elected the chairman of the board of trustees in 2007. He remained the chairman of the board of trustees until his resignation on August 6, 2009, to campaign for his 2009 gubernatorial run. Under Guerrero, the board of trustees filed a lawsuit against Governor Benigno Fitial's administration in a dispute over employer contributions. A court later ruled that the government of the Northern Mariana Islands owed the NMI Retirement Fund $231.6 million in employer contributions. Guerrero is also credited with leading the Retirement Fund to suspend payments to delinquent members, halting payments to people who were adopted as beneficiaries after a worker had retired, and suspending refund payments under his leadership. Candidacy for Governor of the Northern Mariana Islands Juan Pan Guerrero announced that he would run for Governor of the Northern Mariana Islands as an independent candidate. In a joint announcement on March 10, 2009, Guerrero announce that Republican Representative Joe Camacho will be his running mate in the 2009 Northern Mariana Islands gubernatorial election. Guerrero had admired Camacho's organization during his campaign for the CNMI House of Representatives in 2007. He promised that the campaign and potential gubernatorial administration would be a partnership between the two. Guerrero spoke to a crowd of supporters at the Lt. Governor announcement at Tan Marikita Caf√© in Garapan saying, \\"There is only one governor. However, the governor has traditionally delegated authority and responsibility to the lieutenant governor on certain issues and projects. There are many problems facing the CNMI today. It is only right and proper to delegate authority and responsibility so Joe's education, training, skills and experience can be fully utilized.\\" In a candidate's forum to the NMI Bar Association on September 17, 2009, Guerrero told those in attendance that he and Camacho were not answering to special interest groups. Guerrero, who has campaigned to make the NMI easier to do business, said the most important issues facing the Northern Mariana Islands are the economy, relations with the United States federal government, health care, government efficiency, the NMI Retirement Fund, education, the decline in tourism and infrastructure. Guerrero told the Bar that he supports a new, appointed Attorney General position should be created in the CNMI, with autonomous powers like the public auditor. He stated that politics should not be a consideration in the appointment of judges. On the issue of the U.S. federal government takeover of the Northern Mariana Islands immigration, Guerrero stated that the issue was too important for the government to pick an \\"arbitrary deadline\\" for federalization to take effect. Governor Fitial had filed a lawsuit against the U.S. government to stop the federalization of immigration. Guerrero said that the CNMI government should use its own government lawyers in the suit, instead of hiring private attorneys using taxpayer money.

The complex normal family has three parameters: location parameter Œº, covariance matrix \\\\Gamma, and the relation matrix C. The standard complex normal is the univariate distribution with \\\\mu = 0, \\\\Gamma=1, and C=0. An important subclass of complex normal family is called the circularly- symmetric (central) complex normal and corresponds to the case of zero relation matrix and zero mean: \\\\mu = 0 and C=0 . bookchapter, Gallager.R, pg9. This case is used extensively in signal processing, where it is sometimes referred to as just complex normal in the literature. Definitions Complex standard normal random variable The standard complex normal random variable or standard complex Gaussian random variable is a complex random variable Z whose real and imaginary parts are independent normally distributed random variables with mean zero and variance 1/2. Formally, where Z \\\\sim \\\\mathcal{CN}(0,1) denotes that Z is a standard complex normal random variable. Complex normal random variable Suppose X and Y are real random variables such that (X,Y)^{\\\\mathrm T} is a 2-dimensional normal random vector. Then the complex random variable Z=X+iY is called complex normal random variable or complex Gaussian random variable. Complex standard normal random vector A n-dimensional complex random vector \\\\mathbf{Z}=(Z_1,\\\\ldots,Z_n)^{\\\\mathrm T} is a complex standard normal random vector or complex standard Gaussian random vector if its components are independent and all of them are standard complex normal random variables as defined above. That \\\\mathbf{Z} is a standard complex normal random vector is denoted \\\\mathbf{Z} \\\\sim \\\\mathcal{CN}(0,\\\\boldsymbol{I}_n). Complex normal random vector If \\\\mathbf{X}=(X_1,\\\\ldots,X_n)^{\\\\mathrm T} and \\\\mathbf{Y}=(Y_1,\\\\ldots,Y_n)^{\\\\mathrm T} are random vectors in \\\\mathbb{R}^n such that [\\\\mathbf{X},\\\\mathbf{Y}] is a normal random vector with 2n components. Then we say that the complex random vector : \\\\mathbf{Z} = \\\\mathbf{X} + i \\\\mathbf{Y} \\\\, has the is a complex normal random vector or a complex Gaussian random vector. Notation The symbol \\\\mathcal{N}_{\\\\mathcal{C}} is also used for the complex normal distribution. Mean and covariance The complex Gaussian distribution can be described with 3 parameters: : \\\\mu = \\\\operatorname{E}[\\\\mathbf{Z}], \\\\quad \\\\Gamma = \\\\operatorname{E}[(\\\\mathbf{Z}-\\\\mu)({\\\\mathbf{Z}}-\\\\mu)^{\\\\mathrm H}], \\\\quad C = \\\\operatorname{E}[(\\\\mathbf{Z}-\\\\mu)(\\\\mathbf{Z}-\\\\mu)^{\\\\mathrm T}], where \\\\mathbf{Z}^{\\\\mathrm T} denotes matrix transpose of \\\\mathbf{Z}, and \\\\mathbf{Z}^{\\\\mathrm H} denotes conjugate transpose. Here the location parameter \\\\mu is a n-dimensional complex vector; the covariance matrix \\\\Gamma is Hermitian and non-negative definite; and, the relation matrix or pseudo- covariance matrix C is symmetric. The complex normal random vector \\\\mathbf{Z} can now be denoted as \\\\mathbf{Z}\\\\ \\\\sim\\\\ \\\\mathcal{CN}(\\\\mu,\\\\ \\\\Gamma,\\\\ C). Moreover, matrices \\\\Gamma and C are such that the matrix : P = \\\\overline{\\\\Gamma} - {C}^{\\\\mathrm H}\\\\Gamma^{-1}C is also non-negative definite where \\\\overline{\\\\Gamma} denotes the complex conjugate of \\\\Gamma. Relationships between covariance matrices As for any complex random vector, the matrices \\\\Gamma and C can be related to the covariance matrices of \\\\mathbf{X} = \\\\Re(\\\\mathbf{Z}) and \\\\mathbf{Y} = \\\\Im(\\\\mathbf{Z}) via expressions : \\\\begin{align} & V_{XX} \\\\equiv \\\\operatorname{E}[(\\\\mathbf{X}-\\\\mu_X)(\\\\mathbf{X}-\\\\mu_X)^\\\\mathrm T] = \\\\tfrac{1}{2}\\\\operatorname{Re}[\\\\Gamma + C], \\\\quad V_{XY} \\\\equiv \\\\operatorname{E}[(\\\\mathbf{X}-\\\\mu_X)(\\\\mathbf{Y}-\\\\mu_Y)^\\\\mathrm T] = \\\\tfrac{1}{2}\\\\operatorname{Im}[-\\\\Gamma + C], \\\\\\\\\\\\ & V_{YX} \\\\equiv \\\\operatorname{E}[(\\\\mathbf{Y}-\\\\mu_Y)(\\\\mathbf{X}-\\\\mu_X)^\\\\mathrm T] = \\\\tfrac{1}{2}\\\\operatorname{Im}[\\\\Gamma + C], \\\\quad\\\\, V_{YY} \\\\equiv \\\\operatorname{E}[(\\\\mathbf{Y}-\\\\mu_Y)(\\\\mathbf{Y}-\\\\mu_Y)^\\\\mathrm T] = \\\\tfrac{1}{2}\\\\operatorname{Re}[\\\\Gamma - C], \\\\end{align} and conversely : \\\\begin{align} & \\\\Gamma = V_{XX} + V_{YY} + i(V_{YX} - V_{XY}), \\\\\\\\\\\\ & C = V_{XX} - V_{YY} + i(V_{YX} + V_{XY}). \\\\end{align} Density function The probability density function for complex normal distribution can be computed as : \\\\begin{align} f(z) &= \\\\frac{1}{\\\\pi^n\\\\sqrt{\\\\det(\\\\Gamma)\\\\det(P)}}\\\\, \\\\exp\\\\\\\\!\\\\left\\\\\\\\{-\\\\frac12 \\\\begin{pmatrix}(\\\\overline{z}-\\\\overline\\\\mu)^\\\\intercal & (z-\\\\mu)^\\\\intercal\\\\end{pmatrix} \\\\begin{pmatrix}\\\\Gamma&C;\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\overline{C}&\\\\overline\\\\Gamma\\\\end{pmatrix}^{\\\\\\\\!\\\\\\\\!-1}\\\\\\\\! \\\\begin{pmatrix}z-\\\\mu \\\\\\\\\\\\ \\\\overline{z}-\\\\overline{\\\\mu}\\\\end{pmatrix} \\\\right\\\\\\\\} \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\[8pt] &= \\\\tfrac{\\\\sqrt{\\\\det\\\\left(\\\\overline{P^{-1}}-R^{\\\\ast} P^{-1}R\\\\right)\\\\det(P^{-1})}}{\\\\pi^n}\\\\, e^{ -(z-\\\\mu)^\\\\ast\\\\overline{P^{-1}}(z-\\\\mu) + \\\\operatorname{Re}\\\\left((z-\\\\mu)^\\\\intercal R^\\\\intercal\\\\overline{P^{-1}}(z-\\\\mu)\\\\right)}, \\\\end{align} where R=C^{\\\\mathrm H} \\\\Gamma^{-1} and P=\\\\overline{\\\\Gamma}-RC.

Circularly-symmetric central case Definition A complex random vector \\\\mathbf{Z} is called circularly symmetric if for every deterministic \\\\varphi \\\\in [-\\\\pi,\\\\pi) the distribution of e^{\\\\mathrm i \\\\varphi}\\\\mathbf{Z} equals the distribution of \\\\mathbf{Z} . Central normal complex random vectors that are circularly symmetric are of particular interest because they are fully specified by the covariance matrix \\\\Gamma. The circularly-symmetric (central) complex normal distribution corresponds to the case of zero mean and zero relation matrix, i.e. \\\\mu = 0 and C=0. bookchapter, Gallager.R This is usually denoted :\\\\mathbf{Z} \\\\sim \\\\mathcal{CN}(0,\\\\,\\\\Gamma) Distribution of real and imaginary parts If \\\\mathbf{Z}=\\\\mathbf{X}+i\\\\mathbf{Y} is circularly- symmetric (central) complex normal, then the vector [\\\\mathbf{X}, \\\\mathbf{Y}] is multivariate normal with covariance structure : \\\\begin{pmatrix}\\\\mathbf{X} \\\\\\\\\\\\ \\\\mathbf{Y}\\\\end{pmatrix} \\\\ \\\\sim\\\\ \\\\mathcal{N}\\\\Big( \\\\begin{bmatrix} \\\\operatorname{Re}\\\\,\\\\mu \\\\\\\\\\\\ \\\\operatorname{Im}\\\\,\\\\mu \\\\end{bmatrix},\\\\ \\\\tfrac{1}{2}\\\\begin{bmatrix} \\\\operatorname{Re}\\\\,\\\\Gamma & -\\\\operatorname{Im}\\\\,\\\\Gamma \\\\\\\\\\\\ \\\\operatorname{Im}\\\\,\\\\Gamma & \\\\operatorname{Re}\\\\,\\\\Gamma \\\\end{bmatrix}\\\\Big) where \\\\mu = \\\\operatorname{E}[\\\\mathbf{Z}] = 0 and \\\\Gamma=\\\\operatorname{E}[\\\\mathbf{Z} \\\\mathbf{Z}^{\\\\mathrm H}]. Probability density function For nonsingular covariance matrix \\\\Gamma, its distribution can also be simplified as : f_{\\\\mathbf{Z}}(\\\\mathbf{z}) = \\\\tfrac{1}{\\\\pi^n \\\\det(\\\\Gamma)}\\\\, e^{ -\\\\mathbf{z}^{\\\\mathrm H} \\\\Gamma^{-1} \\\\mathbf{z}} . Therefore, if the non-zero mean \\\\mu and covariance matrix \\\\Gamma are unknown, a suitable log likelihood function for a single observation vector z would be : \\\\ln(L(\\\\mu,\\\\Gamma)) = -\\\\ln (\\\\det(\\\\Gamma)) -\\\\overline{(z - \\\\mu)}' \\\\Gamma^{-1} (z - \\\\mu) -n \\\\ln(\\\\pi). The standard complex normal (defined in )corresponds to the distribution of a scalar random variable with \\\\mu = 0, C=0 and \\\\Gamma=1. Thus, the standard complex normal distribution has density : f_Z(z) = \\\\tfrac{1}{\\\\pi} e^{-\\\\overline{z}z} = \\\\tfrac{1}{\\\\pi} e^{-|z|^2}. Properties The above expression demonstrates why the case C=0, \\\\mu = 0 is called ‚Äúcircularly- symmetric‚Äù. The density function depends only on the magnitude of z but not on its argument. As such, the magnitude |zof a standard complex normal random variable will have the Rayleigh distribution and the squared magnitude |z|^2 will have the exponential distribution, whereas the argument will be distributed uniformly on [-\\\\pi,\\\\pi]. If \\\\left\\\\\\\\{ \\\\mathbf{Z}_1,\\\\ldots,\\\\mathbf{Z}_k \\\\right\\\\\\\\} are independent and identically distributed n-dimensional circular complex normal random vectors with \\\\mu = 0, then the random squared norm : Q = \\\\sum_{j=1}^k \\\\mathbf{Z}_j^{\\\\mathrm H} \\\\mathbf{Z}_j = \\\\sum_{j=1}^k \\\\\\\\mathbf{Z}_j \\\\|^2 has the generalized chi- squared distribution and the random matrix : W = \\\\sum_{j=1}^k \\\\mathbf{Z}_j \\\\mathbf{Z}_j^{\\\\mathrm H} has the complex Wishart distribution with k degrees of freedom. This distribution can be described by density function : f(w) = \\\\frac{\\\\det(\\\\Gamma^{-1})^k\\\\det(w)^{k-n}}{\\\\pi^{n(n-1)/2}\\\\prod_{j=1}^k(k-j)!}\\\\ e^{-\\\\operatorname{tr}(\\\\Gamma^{-1}w)} where k \\\\ge n, and w is a n \\\\times n nonnegative-definite matrix.

Urban renewal Innovista is also an urban plan to transform the area bordered by the Congaree River and Assembly, Blossom and Gervais Streets into a \\"vibrant place\\" to Live, Learn, Earn and Play in the heart of the city.\\"Innovista Strategic Plan\\" The Innovista plan includes The Innovation District, where technical and creative talent can live and work, and the planned Waterfront District, a 100-acre Riverfront Park along the Congaree River with an outdoor amphitheater, bicycle and pedestrian paths. History In 2005, the concept of Innovista was created by then-USC President Dr. Andrew Sorenson; Dr. Harris Pastides, then-USC Vice President for Research and Health Sciences and current USC President; and then-Columbia Mayor Bob Coble. At the time, USC research funding was growing significantly and the Carnegie Foundation had designated the university as an institution of \\"very high research activity,\\" its highest distinction given only to 62 public research institutions. USC's signature research areas included hydrogen fuel cells and other alternative energies, health sciences, nanotechnology and material sciences, environmental sciences, and software and technology. Innovista's initial plans called for construction of four buildings. Horizon I and Discovery I: designed for academic research; and companion buildings Horizon II and Discovery II: designed for private development and commercial firms. The public buildings were partially constructed and first occupied in 2009, however funding to complete these buildings was not available until late 2011. Horizon I and Discovery I are currently home to several internationally renowned researchers. The construction of the private buildings experienced obstacles including the failure of two private developers to obtain sufficient financing and the 2009 controversial firing of the second developer. In 2011, several existing private buildings were designated as preferred locations for Innovista affiliated firms including the Tower at 1301 Gervais Street also known as IT-oLogy @ Innovista; the USC-Columbia Technology Incubator; the SCRA USC Innovation Center; Midlands Technical College Business Accelerator; and IdeaLabs. Legislative support The South Carolina General Assembly passed a series of legislative acts designed to help South Carolina research institutions develop world-class research for commercialization. The Centers of Economic Excellence Act \\"SC Centers of Economic Excellence\\" helped USC attract an array of internationally recognized scientists through the associated public/private multimillion-dollar Centers of Economic Excellence Program. The Research University Infrastructure Act provided $58 million originally and another $14 million in additional funding to help finance the construction of the Horizon I and Discovery I buildings, and the Partners Act of 2006 assists high-tech firms and university startups find grant and seed funding. Select accomplishments The University of South Carolina's Arnold School of Public Health is a leader in biomedical research, health disparities, bioterrorism preparedness, and disease prevention. In 2006, the Arnold School opened its new $26 million LEED-certified research facility on Assembly Street with additional space in the Discovery I building on Greene Street. USC's Darla Moore School of Business, whose undergraduate international business program ranks number 1 in the nation, is relocating to the Innovation District, at Assembly and Greene Streets, to a new $90 million structure scheduled for completion by December 2013. The carbon-free, LEED- certified, 260,000 square foot facility will feature state-of-the-art classroom and meeting space, modern faculty and staff offices, a 500-seat auditorium for academic events and performances, and a rooftop terrace and pavilion.USC to build business school, lease old one to U.S., Columbia Regional Business Report, July 20, 2009New Darla Moore School of Business University of South Carolina professor Ken Reifsnider, a member of the National Academy of Engineers and the Scientific Advisory Board for the U.S. Air Force, creates high-performing, lower-cost composite alternatives for aerospace applications.
