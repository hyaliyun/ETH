It serves mainly to connect with the tourist region in the northern Harz (Goslar, Bad Harzburg and Wernigerode) with Hildesheim and Hanover. It is served by the HarzExpress, running between Halle, Halberstadt, Goslar and Hannover Hauptbahnhof. The most important station and junction of the line is Salzgitter-Ringelheim station. Route  Hildesheim Hauptbahnhof The line runs out of Hildesheim mostly towards the south-east along the Innerste river. The occasional designation of the route as the Innerstebahn (Innerste Valley Railway) is not officially used as it leads to confusion with the now closed Innerste Valley Railway between Langelsheim and Altenau, which was further upstream. In Gro√ü D√ºngen, the Lamme Valley Railway branches off. In Derneburg, there was a connection to the former Brunswick‚ÄìSeesen railway of the Brunswick State Railway Company. It continues through Baddeckenstedt and crosses the Brunswick Southern Railway at Salzgitter-Ringelsheim station. From about Othfresen it leaves the Innerste and runs through the former Grauhof junction to Goslar. History The rebuilt platform towards Goslar in Salzgitter-Ringelheim station Gatekeeper's house in Hockeln Even before the War of 1866, which effectively led to the abolition of the national borders between the Kingdom of Hanover, the Duchy of Brunswick and the Kingdom of Prussia, the Magdeburg‚ÄìHalberstadt Railway Company (, MHE) sought a connection from Halberstadt to the west. The first goal was to obtain a connection towards Kreiensen via Vienenburg. Operations began on the Halberstadt‚ÄìVienenburg railway in 1869. From there, the line via Grauhof and Langelsheim was built from 1875 to 1877, continuing to Neuekrug-Hahausen (on the Brunswick Southern Railway) and as the Innerste Valley Railway to Clausthal. Approximately at the same time, the Hanover-Altenbeken Railway Company (Hannover-Altenbekener Eisenbahn-Gesellschaft, HAE) planned a connection to the east, bypassing the cities of Hanover and Brunswick. In 1875, it completed the Elze‚ÄìL√∂hne railway (known as the Weserbahn or Weser Railway) from L√∂hne via Hamelin to Elze on the existing Hanoverian Southern Railway, which connected to the Lehrte‚ÄìNordstemmen railway to Hildesheim. It signed a contract with the MHE to build a line from Hildesheim to Grauhof and connect there. However, the HAE got into economic difficulties, so the project had to be taken over by the MHE. Freight was carried from Hildesheim via Grauhof to Vienenburg on 19 May 1875 and passenger traffic commenced on 30 June. On 1 May 1883, the Brunswick Railway, the successor to the privatized Brunswick State Railway, opened an extension to Goslar. At the same time the gap between Goslar and Langelsheim was closed. The line soon became part of a long-distance connection from the Netherlands and northern Westphalia via L√∂hne, Hildesheim and Halberstadt to Halle and Leipzig, continuing to some extent to the parts of the German Empire that are now in Poland and the Czech Republic. Freight traffic took the direct connection from Grauhof to Vienenburg, while passenger trains ran via Goslar and from 1912 also continued via Bad Harzburg and Wernigerode. In addition, rail services slowly increased for vacationers travelling from Hamburg and Bremen via Hanover to Goslar; some of these also conveyed through coaches via Halberstadt to Berlin. Through traffic ended with the division of Germany after the Second World War. In 1956, the line from Grauhof to Vienenburg was abandoned. However, the northern connection from the Harz to Hanover and Hamburg, served by D-Zug expresses and later InterRegio services, remained. Passenger services Local service from Hanover to Bad Harzburg via Goslar Since the reopening of the Heudeber- Danstedt‚ÄìBad Harzburg/Vienenburg railway (including the construction of some new line) in 1996, a service has run to Halberstadt and Halle. This route was served from the beginning with a Regional-Express service on the Hanover‚ÄìGoslar‚ÄìHalberstadt‚ÄìHalle route. For Expo 2000, the Goslar‚ÄìHildesheim line was developed for the operation of class 612 tilting diesel multiple units. There are also other local services between Bad Harzburg and Hanover, which serve all stations except Gro√ü D√ºngen station; Gro√ü D√ºngen is served only by trains on the Lamme Valley Railway and some trains in the morning towards Hildesheim. Passengers to Hildesheim can use the Regional-Express service from Goslar. An InterRegio service ended after Expo 2000, since then only regional services have run on the line.

She is best known for her leading roles opposite Gene Autry and Roy Rogers, and for her role as Dale Arden in Flash Gordon Conquers the Universe (1940). Biography Hughes was born in Chicago, Illinois, to Charles, an upholsterer, and Mable Hukill (n√©e Stift). Both of her parents were born in Chicago; her mother's grandparents were from Germany. She was raised in a rented house at 2122 Pearl Court in Chicago along with a cousin, Pearl Hukill. As a teenager, she was drawn to acting and participated in school plays. At the age of 14, she began acting and dancing in short musical comedies with an Oshkosh stock company. The following year, she appeared as Katie Conway in the Conway Sisters team, having learned to sing and play piano. In the late 1920s, she teamed with Frank Faylen to form the comedy dancing and singing team of Faylen and Hughes in which she played the \\"dumb girl\\" Kitty Hughes. In 1928, the 18-year-old Hughes married Frank Faylen. By the early 1930s, they were performing together in stock and vaudeville shows throughout Illinois and Wisconsin. In 1935, Hughes and Faylen moved to Hollywood to attempt movie careers. Hughes began her film career playing bit parts in George White's 1935 Scandals (1935) and Ceiling Zero (1936). After being signed on as a contract player by Warner Bros. in 1936, her first name was changed to Carol and she began to appear in credited speaking roles, mostly in B movies. By 1937, she was appearing in leading roles in films such as Meet the Boy Friend, Marry the Girl, Renfrew of the Royal Mounted, and The Westland Case. Hughes as Dale Arden in Flash Gordon Conquers the Universe, 1940 In 1938, Hughes transitioned to Western films appearing opposite Gene Autry in Gold Mine in the Sky (1938), Man from Music Mountain (1938), and Under Fiesta Stars (1941), and opposite Roy Rogers in Under Western Stars (1938). In 1940, she landed one of her best-known roles as Dale Arden in Flash Gordon Conquers the Universe (1940). Throughout the early 1940s, Hughes appeared in leading roles in Top Sergeant Mulligan (1941), The Miracle Kid (1941), My Son, the Hero (1943), She's for Me (1943), and The Beautiful Cheat (1945). As the decade progressed, however, she appeared increasingly in minor roles in films such as The Bachelor and the Bobby-Soxer (1947), Every Girl Should Be Married (1948), and Mighty Joe Young (1949). In 1947, Hughes returned to the stage to perform in Trouble for Rent. Hughes made brief returns to Western films in leading roles in Home in Oklahoma (1946) with Roy Rogers, and Stagecoach Kid (1949) with Tim Holt‚Äîthe latter film featured her last major screen role. Minor roles followed in D.O.A. (1950) and Scaramouche (1952). In the last years of her film career, Hughes appeared mainly in RKO film shorts and one television series episode. Hughes' husband Frank Faylen continued working as a character actor in films and television through the 1970s. He appeared in supporting roles in numerous films, including The Pride of the Yankees (1942), The Lost Weekend (1945), Frank Capra's It's a Wonderful Life (1946) in the role of Ernie the cabdriver, Road to Rio (1948), Gunfight at the OK Corral (1965), and Funny Girl (1968). He is best-known today for playing the father Herbert T. Gillis in the television series The Many Loves of Dobie Gillis (1959-1963). Hughes and Faylen raised two daughters, Catherine (or Kay) and Carol, both of whom became actresses. Their daughter Kay was the first wife of Regis Philbin. Their daughter Carol appeared in the television series Leave It to Beaver (1962‚Äì1963) and The Bing Crosby Show (1964‚Äì1965). Hughes and Faylen remained married for 57 years until his death in 1985. Hughes died on August 8, 1995, in Burbank, California, at the age of 85. She is buried next to her husband in San Fernando Mission Cemetery in Mission Hills, Los Angeles, California.

She first appeared in the series fifteen episode \\"The Kick Inside\\", broadcast on 10 September 2013. Zosia arrives at Holby City hospital to start her first year of the Foundation Programme. Zosia has vested interest in psychiatry and has worked on both Darwin and Keller wards mentored by Elliot Hope (Paul Bradley) and Sacha Levy (Bob Barrett) respectively. She is characterised as a forthright, intelligent and unafraid to challenge the hospital hierarchy. The show soon introduced Zosia's estranged father, Guy Self (John Michie). They share a dysfunctional relationship following the death of her mother. Their feud jeopardises Zosia's career and on one occasion she is thrown off Keller following a rude confrontation. Other storylines revolve around close colleagues Arthur Digby (Rob Ostlere) and Dominic Copeland (David Ames) and romances with Sebastian Coulter (Hadley Fraser) and Oliver Valentine (James Anderson), whom she later married. The character's most prominent story has been the depiction of bipolar disorder. Zosia begins to drink excessively, use drugs and her behaviour becomes uncontrollable. Through her eventual diagnosis the show explored stigma attached to the illness and treatment involving lithium. The story has received acclaim from mental health charities and organisations. Arfwedson chose to leave the role in 2017, and made her departure in the nineteenth series and returned for one episode in the following series. Arfwedson agreed to reprise the role in 2018 for an extended guest stint and Zosia appeared across two months in 2019. The character has been well received by critics. The Sun's Colin Robertson branded her the \\"feisty junior doctor\\". A South Wales Echo journalist praised her integrity regarding patient care. But one Daily Post reviewer felt that Zosia and Guy's storyline became \\"far-fetched\\". Casting Camilla Arfwedson attended three auditions to secure the role. Firstly she auditioned for casting directors and then with producers. The third audition was carried out on set wearing scrubs and reciting medical dialogue. The actress was determined to get the part because the character breakdown was fascinating. On 16 July 2013, it was announced that Arfwedson had been cast in Holby City and already began filming. The character was billed as a \\"plain-speaking F1\\", while executive producer Oliver Kent said \\"there are already some very strong opinionated characters in Holby City but none quite like Zosia. Zosia isn‚Äôt afraid to tell it how it is so viewers can expect sparks to fly!\\" Arfwedson added that she was excited to see how Zosia would develop. Development =Characterisation= The actress created character traits inspired by people she knew. She also recognises aspects of her own in personality in Zosia's persona. Zosia does not suffer fools and behaves in a \\"sexually voracious\\" manner. Arfwedson told Benita Adesuyan (Daily Express) that her character \\"likes to pin men down then discard them as she wishes. She‚Äôs very determined and ambitious, and she doesn‚Äôt really care about upsetting people.‚Äù Arfwedson rose to the challenge of portraying lengthy medical dialogue. She explained that because Zosia is \\"so bright and so good at what she does\\", she wanted Zosia to sound as convincing as possible when discussing patient cases. With a cool and collected manner she does not suffer fools gladly. Arfwedson attributes a \\"no filter\\" complex - she does not think about what she says or how other perceive her. In turn this paints her as unfeeling, \\"very matter of fact\\" and obsessive about work. She appears almost \\"robotic\\" but that is a facade to conceal personal issues. The actress concluded that \\"I think she has little social awareness and avoids building relationships due to her past experiences.\\" When she debuts on the wards of Holby City, Zosia wants everyone to know how \\"brilliant\\" she is. =Early career= Zosia spends time being mentored by Elliot Hope (Paul Bradley) on Darwin ward. But she soon gets bossy and he tries to remove her from his ward. Zosia forms part of a new team on the hospital's Keller ward consisting of herself, Arthur Digby (Rob Ostlere) and Dominic Copeland (David Ames). Harper said that Arthur is left confused by Zosia. He added that he has to fight for his place more with Zosia and Dominic placed on the ward. The show developed Zosia and Dom into a \\"best friend\\" partnership. When Dominic creates a false story of how his mother died, Arthur decides to expose him as a liar. But the truth does not faze Zosia as she aspires to be a psychiatrist, Dominic being a sociopath only makes him more interesting. The show's series producer Simon Harper announced that viewers would witness a \\"new side\\" to Zosia. The change comes following the arrival of Guy Self (John Michie) and it becomes clear that the \\"driven nature\\" is a family trait. Guy's arrival also makes Zosia's life unstable. Harper explained that \\"So far she's been very much in control and is very alpha for a junior doctor, but we're going to learn that there's more complexity and vulnerability behind the polished exterior.\\" Michie labeled the relationship between Zosia and Guy \\"strange and dyfunctional\\". Following the death of Zosia's mother, Guy began drinking and had affairs. This distanced the pair and Guy chose to come to Holby City not only to help his career. Michie said \\"he wants to retrieve the love of his daughter\\". This task is made extremely difficult because \\"she blames him for everything thats wrong in her life.\\" When Guy tries to make amends with Zosia she rejects him and makes it clear she only wants a professional relationship with him. But her animosity towards Guy begins to affect her career progression. The pair do develop some level of respect. As seen in a storyline where they bond over the treatment of a patient named Beth Forbes (Lois Chimimba). Zosia misdiagnoses Beth and Guy realises she has a brain aneurysm and tries to safe her life. However, an Inside Soap columnist reported that Zosia was only taking \\"baby steps\\" in her approach to repair their \\"damaged relationship\\". But Zosia's rude temperament soon gets her into trouble on the anniversary of her mother's death. Zosia is thrown off the Keller ward after confronting a patient's relative, Owen Saunders (Joe Claflin). She is then \\"hell-bent on drowning her sorrows\\". But Owen follows her to the bar and spikes her drink with GHB. Zosia is aware of is this and forces him to drink it causing him to fit. =Affair with Jesse Law= In April 2014, a new Consultant Anaesthetist Jesse Law is hired on Keller Ward. Jesse is an old friend of Guy's and is already acquainted with Zosia. Don Gilet who plays the character told Katy Moon from Inside Soap that Zosia calls him \\"Uncle Jesse\\" and this causes others to tease him. A reporter from the Grimsby Telegraph reported that the inclusion of patient Lindsey Kendal (Claire Sweeney) in Zosia's storyline would help develop a romance story with Jesse. Zosia is accused of not empathising with patients and is referred to as a \\"grumpy Kate Adie\\" on a feedback form. Jesse teases her over the event and suggests working on Lindsey's case to develop her rapport with patients. Arfwedson told a What's on TV reporter that Zosia is fond of Jesse because of his history with Guy. A fondness that develops into a flirtation. Zosia is \\"terribly efficient\\" getting the job done which causes her failure to empathise. Her bossy attitude means people are \\"terrified\\" of her. But Jesse is the only character within the show able to tease and amuse her. The actress added \\"[he makes] her laugh and he doesn't give in to her demands, which is even more attractive to her.\\" Zosia tries to deny the attraction but Dom helps esculate her feelings by passing judgement. Zosia decides to seduce Jesse following a series of flirtatious jibes. Afwedson explained \\"Zosia's a very predatory person - she's very animalistic in her approach and just pounces on Jesse with a kiss. But whether she's making a move on him out of genuine feelings or because of an agenda, who knows...\\" The pair continue their affair in secret but it soon becomes problematic. Arfwedson told Katy Moon from Inside Soap that Jesse really understands Zosia. She is played as an \\"ice queen\\" yet she just \\"melts\\" in his presence. Jesse tries to distance himself from Zosia and she attempts to win him creating negative consequences for her. The actress detailed the scenes in which Zosia sneaks into an important neurological operation to be close to him. But Jesse cannot cope with her distraction and she kisses him. But the move causes \\"everything to blow up in her face\\". The episodes which aired in July feature Jesse ending his relationship with Zosia for good when she becomes too serious about their future. But when Guy finds out about their affair he punches Jesse and he leaves Holby City. Arfwedson assessed that Guy could not accept Zosia and Jesse because the latter \\"is such a player\\" and has been sleeping with his daughter. =Bipolar disorder= One of the characters most prominent stories has been her battle with Bipolar disorder. Holby City story producer Kate Hall said that the show decided to explore the storyline when they learned about mental health statistics in medical professions. Those working in the system do not report their illness out of fear of being perceived as weak. Hall described the character of Guy as an \\"eminent neurosurgeon\\" who has no time for psychiatry. Hall said it allowed writers to explore the issue of stigma against Zosia's illness from both a professional and familial point of view. The story begins on-screen when Zosia behaves recklessly following her break- up with Jesse. She treats a cancer patient who reminds her of her dead mother. The experience leaves Zosia upset and she turns to recreational drugs to \\"numb\\" her pain. She then has a \\"wild night out\\" with Dom and comes into work after. Arthur is shocked by their state and has to cover for them. Ostlere who plays Arthur told Katy Moon (Inside Soap) that Zosia and Dom should be reported to their seniors. But Arthur feels compromised because he cares about them. He added that his socially awkward character was not able to deal with Zosia's outlandish behaviour. Zosia begins to feel unwell, collapses and stops breathing. Arthur breaks hospital rules and steals drugs to revive Zosia. The actor explained that \\"he's afraid they'll get found out and will all be struck off\\". The trio make a pact to keep the incident a secret, but Arthur worries that it will happen to Zosia again because she is so \\"emotionally fragile\\". Arfwedson branded the scenes \\"very high octane and very exciting\\". She likened the entire episode to a \\"mini-movie\\" and where Zosia is sweaty, greasy haired and looks bad. The actress concluded that personally it was \\"terrifying\\" to watch. Her behaviour continues, Arfwedson observed the character \\"spiral out of control\\" as she puts patients lives at risk, takes drugs and nearly burned down her flat. Zosia's mental state causes real concern for her father Guy. Zosia keeps a video diary where she discusses her thoughts and state of mind. He realises that she needs help and sends her to a rehab clinic. While there she is told that she has bipolar disorder but Guy refuses to believe it. Arfwedson stated that \\"mentally unstable\\" Zosia is \\"terrified of her ability to lose control, but she doesn't want to admit she's got this problem; that scares her more.\\" She fears that her career is ruined and her dreams of being a psychiatrist herself will be unattainable. The actress add \\"It leaves her wondering: 'How can I understand other people, if I can't understand myself?'\\" When she is discharged he ignores a psychiatrist's advice that Zosia undergoes more intense treatment. Zosia insists that she is of sound mind to return to work. As the CEO, Guy is able to let her return and even invites her to work alongside him in the operating theatre. But while in there he notices that Zosia is still unwell. She behaves in a \\"frenzied and disruptive\\" manner and Guy struggles to concentrate on the procedure and has her removed from the theatre. The actress described her character as having \\"waves of clarity where she feels almost super-human and everything makes sense\\". But then she start talking really fast, no one can understand her and she cannot understand why. At this point Guy accepts that he has been in denial and Zosia is ill. He lets Zosia remain at the hospital under the agreement that she takes her medication to control the health. Zosia begins to take a mood-stabilizing drug called Lithium and some that die from the illness refuse to take the drug. The actress explained that some real life patients with bipolar fear Lithium because they believe it changes their personality negatively. Zosia initially refused the treatment as she shared the same view of Lithium. Guy ensures she takes the medication and she obliges to keep her place at the hospital. Arfwedson wanted writers to write a more positive direction for Zosia following her diagnosis. She claimed \\"it's important for Holby to show that people with mental illness can be successful, can get help and that drugs aren't necessarily a bad thing.\\" Arfwedson found it \\"absolutely exhausting\\" to portray the condition. She admitted it was hard to get out of character because when she got home she would be learning lines for the following day. To avoid feeling manic herself, she would socialise, meditate and do yoga to forget about Zosia. The storyline had positive outcomes for viewers. People with the condition contacted the actress to credit her portrayal with saving their lives. Arfwedson said she found it \\"quite moving\\" to think she was making a difference in real life. =Friendship with Arthur Digby= One of Zosia's most prominent friendships has been with fellow trainee doctor Arthur. He lacks social skills and finds Zosia's personality difficult to deal with, but they both care about each other. They work closely together on Keller ward alongside Dom. In 2015, Producer Simon Harper decided to split up the trio having Zosia move to Darwin, Arthur to AAU and Dom staying on Keller. Harper said it was a difficult decision to make and it was discussed at length with executive producer Oliver Kent. But Harper wanted to tell stories reflecting real medical careers. He noted that \\"as they mature and progress, [they] would go on to their separate disciplines and wards [...] What's great about the changes is that gives them different stories.\\" He promised that the characters would continue to share scenes as they live together in a shared flat. Arthur is diagnosed with terminal cancer. Arfwedson said that her fictional counterpart cannot cope with his illness. She feels like a \\"spectator\\" watching on and unable to solve his problems. It really effects Zosia and she keeps her feelings hidden because she is so scared about Arthur's health. Having lost her mother and being unaware how advanced her cancer was, Zosia feels unequipped to deal with his prognosis and does not support him enough. Arthur's condition deteriorates and Zosia begins to unravel and it effects her work. The actress explained that Zosia is left fearing Arthur's illness will trigger a bipolar episode. She worries that if she fully acknowledges her best friend's condition then \\"she'll spiral out of control.\\" Ostlere said that his character's death would create an interesting story for Zosia. =Relationship with Oliver Valentine= Zosia begins working with Specialist registrar Oliver Valentine (James Anderson). A writer from Inside Soap assessed that there was a \\"mutual hatred\\" between the characters from the moment they met. They disagree over patient care and clash during surgery.The duo have to set aside their difference to avoid compromising patient's treatment. Despite their initial dislike the two character share more screen time and bond. They develop banter and a fun working relationship. A new psychiatrist, Sebastian Coulter (Hadley Fraser), arrives at the hospital and asks Zosia for a date. She agrees and they continue to spend time together. This creates a \\"love triangle\\" scenario and Oliver and Seb compete for her attention. Arfwedson told Allison Jones (Inside Soap) that she had fun working on the storyline with Anderson and Fraser. She explained that her character wants to see where her relationship with Seb could go. She views him as \\"articluate, good-looking and clever\\". But as she spends more time in his company she finds him controlling and selfish and makes the relationship more about him. Oliver does not seem a good match for Zosia in theory. He is \\"miserable\\" and \\"has a lot of baggage\\" following the death of his wife Tara Lo (Jing Lusi). But they share a good working relationship and she \\"gets a thrill out of their banter\\". The actress added \\"they are so harmonious on the wards that eventually, they might start to realise there could be something more to it.\\" Arfwedsen was glad to receive the storyline because she wanted Zosia to find love and move on from her troubles with a \\"positive figure within the hospital\\". Ultimately it would help her excel in her medical speciality. Holby City producer Simon Harper told Daniel Kilkelly from Digital Spy that Zosia and Oliver have a \\"delicious chemistry\\". He was keen to have the story play out slow paced to create anticipation for their eventual relationship. But noted that there was a danger viewers could become tired of waiting. He was happy with the success the pairing had already become. He noted that viewers on social media named them \\"Zollie\\" and branded it \\"one of the most successful romances we've ever played on the show.\\" They eventually get together but writers planned to create fresh relationship dramas for the pair. Zosia is happy with her relationship and wants to plan their future. She asks for a key to Oliver's flat but she is met with optimism from him. Then a pregnant patient Melissa Peters (Faye McKeever) arrives on Darwin ward. She recalls having a one-night stand with Oliver and claims he is the baby's father. They later find out Melissa has lied and Oliver is not the father. But the scenario damages Zosia and Oliver's relationship. When Zosia is named in the local newspaper as having bipolar disorder she is eager to prove it will not effect her surgical abilities. As her senior Oliver decides to pull rank and have her removed from a major operation. When she finds out the truth she ends their relationship. Arfwedson said that it was \\"very sad\\" because they love each other, but Zosia cannot move on from his betrayal. She believed Oliver made the correct decision, describing her character's mood as \\"explosive\\" and \\"not in a good place\\". She is \\"most hurt\\" that Oliver spoke to his colleague, Specialist registrar Mo Effanga (Chizzy Akudolu) privately about her state of mind, rather than discuss it with her first. Arfwedson thought it would be a \\"shame to lose\\" the on-screen romance as they have a \\"a lovely partnership\\". Zosia decides to give Oliver another chance. She tracks him down to a bar but finds him drunken and kissing staff nurse Cara Martinez (Niamh Walsh). The actress described Zosia's shock \\"As far as Zosia's concerned that really is the end for them. It‚Äôs very sad.\\" The pair later reunite and marry in the episode titled \\"Veil of Tears ‚Äì Part One\\". They face a number of issues including Zosia's disapproving father Guy, who she bans from the ceremony for trying to sabotage things. He then gets drunk and smashes the guest table and wedding cake inside their reception room. = Departure and returns= On 10 September 2017, Arfwedson announced her departure from Holby City on her social media account, after appearing in the serial for four years. She made her final appearance as Zosia on 26 September. Of her decision to leave, Arfwedson said \\"It's been a real honour to play Zosia and to work at Holby. I have loved playing her with all her ups and downs, battles with her mental health and close relationships. She has been inspiring and challenging in equal measure. A truly wonderful part to play.\\" The actress hoped that her character could return to the hospital in the future. Following her departure, Arfwedson told Laura-Jayne Tyler of Inside Soap that she had been asked to return in October to film one episode. She returned on 2 January 2018. On 19 September 2018, it was announced that Arfwedson had agreed to reprise the role of Zosia for an extended guest appearance. Holby City's Executive Producer Simon Harper said that the character was returning because of \\"popular demand\\" from the show's viewers. She is scheduled to return during February 2019. When Zosia returns to the ward she has a secret and feels lonely. Arfwedson told Laura-Jayne Tyler from Inside Soap that Zosia has worked hard at Yale but feels isolated and alone in the United States. She explained that \\"ultimately she's searching for stability\\" by returning to Holby. Jac is not pleased to see Zosia working back at the hospital. The actress said that \\"Zosia is like a protege to Jac, so her being back after spreading her wings and escaping her controlling father doesn't go down well.\\" In addition producers decided to keep Zosia and Oliver's current relationship status vague because Anderson had left the show. There are hints that Zosia has had an affair with an American but she still loves Oliver. They are on speaking terms but they are unsure of how his brain damage has progressed. Arfwedson did feel that her character had grown up while she had been away. She praised Zosia for being a role model for those suffering with bipolar disorder because her placement at Yale demonstrates that you can be successful. It emerges that Zosia's secret is that she is expecting a baby and five months pregnant when she returns. Following her return, Arfwedson appears as Zosia in a crossover two-part episode with Holby City sister show, Casualty, originally broadcast in March 2019. The character departed two months later in the series 21 episode \\"North and South\\", originally broadcast on 16 April 2019. Having been secretive about her pregnancy and avoiding having baby scans, Zosia admits that she plans to have the baby adopted. However, when she suffers a fall, Zosia has a scan confirming the baby's good health. In the aftermath, Zosia decides to return to America to raise the child and it emerges that Oliver is the father of the baby. As she leaves, Zosia speaks to Oliver, hinting that the couple could reconcile. The character's departure was not announced beforehand and it was confirmed following its broadcast that she had left the show again. Reception The Daily Express Adesuyan said that sweet is not a word anyone would use to describe the \\"forthright junior doctor\\" Zosia. Jamie Downham writing for Yahoo! said \\"super-smart junior doctor\\" who arrived on the Darwin ward with \\"in all her nightmarish glory\\". Trinity Mirror columnist Jane Simon said that Elliot had his hands full with Zosia and called her \\"way too clever for her own good\\". She also described her as \\"scarily confident, straight talking to the point of rudeness and not afraid to ask for what she wants.\\" Simon later noted a rise in neurological and psychiatry stories following Zosia and Guy's introductions. She branded her a \\"wannabe psychiatrist\\" and \\"stroppy junior doctor\\" - a Daily Mirror reporter went with \\"straight- talking\\". A writer from STV.tv said that they could not wait to watch Zosia learn the truth about her mother's death. But a writer from the Welsh Daily Post was not impressed. They quipped \\"these explanations are getting more far- fetched by the week. I'm just waiting for Guy to tell Zosia that her mother wasn't really her mother at all, but a secret agent working undercover for MI5.\\" A writer from the South Wales Echo praised Zosia for making it clear where her loyalties lie regarding hospital policy. They also noted that she is willing to risk her reputation to wipe the \\"self-satisfied smile of Guy's face\\". A Daily Mirror writer noted that Zosia is ambitious but had \\"bitten off more than she can chew\\" when she tried to treat a vulnerable patient in need of psychiatric help. Inside Soap's Laura-Jayne Tyler was happy with Zosia and Jesse's romance. She believed that it served as a good opportunity to see Guy \\"get a taste of his own medicine\\". A representative for Mental Health Support UK stated \\"due to Holby City being a medical drama, focusing on illnesses, it is not surprising that this representation of an individual coping with bipolar disorder is the most accurate and thought provoking.\\" Harriet Martin of Wessex Scene said that Arfwedson \\"arguably portrayed the illness with a relatively high degree of accuracy\\". Zosia's story secured Holby City a nomination for the \\"Soaps & Continuing Series Award\\" at the Mind Media Awards 2015. A writer from Mind stated \\"viewers follow her character through a heart- breaking journey of confusion, denial, treatment and acceptance.\\" In August 2017, Arfwedson was longlisted for Best Drama Star at the Inside Soap Awards. The nomination did not progress to the viewer-voted shortlist.

L. Lyons Memorial Stadium in Kirkwood In Missouri, the Turkey Day Game is an annual American high school football contest between Kirkwood High School's Pioneers and Webster Groves High School's Statesmen, two teams based in St. Louis County, Missouri. The contest has traditionally been played on Thanksgiving. History =1898 to 1923= The Kirkwood-Webster Groves rivalry celebrated its 100th anniversary in 2007. Newly found evidence shows that 2007 also celebrated the 100th known football game since 1898 between the two schools (whether or not there were games played during the 1899, 1900, and 1905 seasons still remains unknown) and the 77th game played on Thanksgiving Day between the varsity teams of the two schools. It was not regularly played on Thanksgiving until 1928. In addition to the unknown seasons of 1899, 1900, and 1905, there was no game in 1904 because Kirkwood did not have a team; there were two games held in 1906; three games held in 1907; and two games held in 1908. Annual games in 1909‚Äì10, 1912, 1915‚Äì17, 1919‚Äì21, and 1923 are recorded, but none were held on Thanksgiving; no games were held 1911, 1914, 1918 (due to World War I and the flu pandemic), nor between 1924 and 1927. The four-year hiatus in the 1920s came after a melee occurred on the field in 1923 that involved spectators from the stands. A referee called back all three of Kirkwood's touchdowns due to penalties, allowing Webster Groves to win the game 7‚Äì0. The win gave Webster Groves its eighth consecutive win and a 14‚Äì7‚Äì2 lead in the varsity series since 1898. =1928 to 1974= The game resumed in 1928 and was played continuously on Thanksgiving Day through 1974. While not the only Thanksgiving football game in Missouri during its early existence, the state's high school athletic commission shut down most others (one prominent example being the Mineral Water Bowl in Excelsior Springs) after 1950, while leaving the Kirkwood‚ÄìWebster Groves game intact. In 1975, when the then-St. Louis Cardinals hosted NFL games on Thanksgiving, the city resisted the move, in part because the Kirkwood-Webster Groves rivalry had already established itself (the Cardinals were never particularly popular in St. Louis, and the Dallas Cowboys, whose place the Cardinals had taken, were already a major national draw); the Turkey Day Game was not held that year. The Cardinals gave up on playing Thanksgiving games in 1977 after three games, and the hosting reverted to the Cowboys. For similar reasons, the Rams, during their 21-year tenure in St. Louis, never played on Thanksgiving. =1976 to 2019, 2021‚Äì= The game was also not held on Thanksgiving in 1980 or 1985. Two games between the two teams are recorded in 1983. The institution of the Show- Me Bowl, a statewide championship tournament for high school football in Missouri, has complicated the playing of the Turkey Day Game, much as state championships elsewhere in the United States have done; both Kirkwood and Webster Groves have typically been contenders for the state title since approximately 2002. The first time this would be an issue was the 1979 contest, in which Webster Groves played the JV squad for most of the Turkey Day Game, still managing to win, en route to the state title. In 1988, Webster Groves decided not to play the Turkey Day Game and chose to contest for the Show-Me Bowl instead. To allow the game to not be canceled because of such conflicts in future years, the two schools agreed to the \\"Turkey Day Agreement.\\"http://www.stltoday.com/sports/high-school/football/webster-groves- wants-to-prevent-kirkwood-from-first-championship- turkey/article_d78e4e4a-b0ea-11e6-8719-f34636b8fa56.html The agreement, which was based on the precedent set in the 1979 game, stipulates that in the event that either Kirkwood or Webster Groves advances to the Show-Me Bowl state championship game, the non-varsity members of the junior varsity and freshman squads play instead. The agreement was first invoked in 2002, and again in 2003 and 2006.Askeland, Kevin (2009-11-24). High school football a tradition on Thanksgiving Day. CBS Sports. Retrieved November 6, 2010. The Kirkwood and Webster Groves varsity teams did not meet in the Turkey Day Game for a four- year stretch between 2009 and 2012.

When the Rams left St. Louis in 2016, closing the Show-Me Bowl's permanent home venue, the Show-Me Bowl was split up so that the lowest class, the eight-man football class, and the largest, Class 6, are held the weekend before Thanksgiving. By this point, Kirkwood, which had been a Class 5 school as recently as 2013, had grown into Class 6, which resulted in Kirkwood being able to advance all the way to the 2016 Show-Me Bowl (which it won) and play the Turkey Day Game in the same year without invoking the Agreement; using their backup quarterback, Kirkwood won their fourth consecutive Turkey Day Game 17‚Äì6.Kvidahl, David (November 24, 2016).

It was the second time either team won both the state title and the Turkey Day Game in the same year, following Webster Groves's achievement of the feat in 1979 (coincidentally, the next year would begin the only other Kirkwood four-game winning streak in the game's record). (Webster Groves remains in Class 5 and thus must still invoke the Agreement should it ever return to the Show-Me Bowl; Kirkwood's promotion also ensures that neither team will face each other in the playoffs for the foreseeable future.) The Turkey Day Game site alternates between Moss Field (Webster Groves) on even years and Lyons Field (Kirkwood) on odd years.

Festivities The term Turkey Day in both Kirkwood and Webster has grown to encompass not only the football game itself, but the festivities in the week prior to Thanksgiving Day. Both schools participate in extensive activities surrounding Turkey Day during Thanksgiving week. The Friendship Dance is held every year at the high school not hosting that year's game, as a gesture of friendship between the schools. Each school names a Friendship Court and selects a Friendship Queen and King from the court. In addition, each grade level at both schools decorate a hallway in a unique theme, and are then judged. At both schools, the activities culminate in respective pep rallies both on the last day of school of that week (Tuesday) and the Wednesday night before the game. At both Kirkwood and Webster, there is a bonfire after the Wednesday night pep rally. However the game is considered to be a rivalry, it is difficult to say whether it exemplifies the characteristics of a rivalry due to the fact of Webster‚Äôs consecutive losses against Kirkwood.

The winner of the game takes possession of the Frisco Bell until the next game. The Bell was first awarded to Kirkwood, despite the game ending in a tie, because Webster Groves had lost the previous year's game. Since 1940, the loser has received the Little Brown Jug, which originally had painted the years and scores of the game on its back, but now has been replaced with the Centennial Jug, with the history of the coaches painted on it.

Career  Tischler completed his first PhD in musicology from the University of Vienna with the dissertation titled Die Harmonik in den Werken Gustav Mahlers (1937). The political situation in Europe forced him to leave Vienna, after having been sent to a concentration camp and given a tattoo number (per student Prof. Eric Street, Dayton Univ.) and he immigrated to the United States of America in 1938. His second PhD, with a dissertation titled The Motet in 13th Century France, was awarded by Yale University (1942) and was the first to be granted in the US in Musicology. Tischler then enlisted in the US Army and served from 1943 to 1945 and became a US citizen. From 1945 to 1947, he was appointed head of the music department at West Virginia Wesleyan College. In 1947 he joined the faculty at Roosevelt University in Chicago as Associate Professor of Music where he taught theory and music history. In 1950, he founded the Chicago Chapter of the International Society of Contemporary Music. Tischler remained at Roosevelt University until 1965 when he was appointed Professor of Musicology at the Indiana University Jacobs School of Music in Bloomington, where he remained until his retirement in 1985.  Grants, publications and papers  Grants from the American Philosophical Society, a Guggenheim fellowship, two National Endowment for the Arts grants, two from the Chapelbrook Foundation, and a grant from the American Council of Learned Societies aided Tischler in his research and publications. He wrote over 150 articles and 22 books, gaining him world-wide recognition in the field of medieval French music, especially of the so-called Notre-Dame school in Paris. He contributed to numerous festschriften, wrote many reviews in learned journals, and gave numerous lectures and papers at conferences and academic institutions all over the world.  Affiliations  Tischler was a member and chapter chair of the American Musicological Society and, in 2009, was honored as a member for more than 50 years. He was also an honorary member of the Austrian Musicological Society. He was a vital member of the Bloomington community, during which time he was a founding member of the Bloomington Chamber Music Society and the Bloomington Jewish Community Beth Shalom.  Family  Tischler married Louise Hochdorf in 1938, and had two children -- Judy (1943) and Len (1945). After Louise's death in 1957, he married Alice Bock in 1958. He had two more children with her -- Mark (1961) and Laura (1963).  Legacy  In recognition of Tischler's life and work, January 18, 2008 was named Hans Tischler Day in Bloomington by Bloomington Mayor Mark Kruzan.

History The Gilroy Dispatch traces its lineage to the Gilroy Advocate, which published from September 12, 1868 to April 28, 1949. In 1925, John N. Hall and Thomas Losey started the competing The Advocate, a six-day daily. In 1930, Hall sold his interest in the Dispatch to Lloyd E. Smith, who also bought the Advocate and merged it with the Gilroy Evening Dispatch. Smith published the Dispatch until 1939. George R. Kane, Patrick H. Peabody and Joseph Hoeteling purchased The Dispatch in 1949 from George W. Werner, its publisher since 1941. Kane‚Äôs group sold the publication to Jerry Fuchs and Millard Hoyle in March 1972. McClatchy Newspapers Inc. purchased it from Fuchs and Hoyle in August 1978. At the time of the sale it published three days a week and had a reported circulation of 6500. On February 28, 1997, McClatchy sold the Dispatch, along with the Hollister Free Lance, the Morgan Hill Times and the Amador Ledger, for $6.7 million to Independent Newspapers Ltd. of New Zealand. McClatchy‚Äôs filing with the U.S. Security and Exchange Commission reported a combined daily circulation of approximately 10,150, weekly circulation of 12,800 and $7.5 million in annual revenues for the year preceding the sale. Independent‚Äôs largest shareholder was Australia-based News Ltd., controlled by billionaire publisher Rupert Murdoch. The New Zealand group sold the papers in 1998 to Central Valley Publishing Holdings, Inc., an operator of 30 small market papers that was based in Festus, Missouri. Michigan publishers Anthony Allegretti and Steve Staloch gained control of Central Valley's assets in a 2004 private equity-backed management buyout, assembling a group that included community newspapers in San Diego County, Santa Cruz and California's Central Valley. Staloch and Allegretti left the company in 2013 and controlling shareholder, The Brookside Group of Stamford, CT, put its California newspapers on the market, selling its San Diego group in November. Return to Local Ownership Silicon Valley-based Metro Newspapers, headed by Dan Pulcrano, purchased the Mainstreet‚Äôs four remaining weeklies, including the Dispatch, in April 2014, marking the first time the Dispatch had been owned by a publisher based in the region in 36 years. South Valley Magazine The Dispatch and its sister paper, the Morgan Hill Times, launched South Valley magazine on July 15, 2016. The publication is home-delivered with the newspapers and distributed free at locations in the communities. Its logo was drawn by typographer Mark Davis and art directed by Roger Black. Return to Downtown After decades in a building at the south end of Monterey Ave., the Dispatch returned to downtown in August 2016, moving its offices to 64 W 6th St.  Awards  The Gilroy Dispatch won 11 awards over a broad range of news categories, including three first-place awards, in the 2004 annual California Newspaper Publishers Association‚Äôs Better Newspapers Contest.

Biography  Graduated with honours from the Chair of Physics of Oscillations, MSU Faculty of Physics in 1961. He returned to this department in 1963 to do a PhD course after working for three years as a junior researcher at the Institute of computer control. In 1967 he defended a PhD thesis on the topic \\"Diffracting beams in nonlinear media\\" under the supervision of academician R. V. Khokhlov. In 1974 he has passed habilitation and received a doctoral degree in physical and mathematical sciences. The topic of his Doktor nauk work was \\"Wave beams and pulses in nonlinear media\\". In 1977 he received a professor title at the Chair of General Physics and Wave Processes. Since 1966, he had worked at the Faculty of Physics ‚Äì first as a senior engineer, then assistant, senior lecturer, associate professor, and full professor (from 1976). In 1984‚Äì1989 he served as a head of Division of Radiophysics and Electronics. In 1989‚Äì1992 he worked as a dean of the Faculty of Physics. From 1988 till 2014 he was a head of the Chair of Photonics and Microwave Physics (previous department name until 2008 ‚Äì Department of Radiophysics).  Scientific achievements  Anatoly P. Sukhorukov at a work desk (1971) Anatoly. P. Sukhorukov has made fundamental contributions to the development of the theory of waves and nonlinear interactions in optics, radiophysics, and acoustics. Among his many achievements, the results discussed here were most valued by the scientist, as being most important and influential for the subsequent development of corresponding research fields. His scientific interests lied mainly in the area to nonlinear optics. He was one of the founders of modern theoretical nonlinear optics. He obtained, in particular, a number of pioneering results on self-focusing and parametric interactions, which were later confirmed in experiments. In a series of works on self-focusing (since 1966) he has developed for the first time the aberration-free theory of wave self-action, found exact solutions for ray patterns accounting for nonlinear aberrations, and numerically investigated different regimes of spatial resonant self-focusing. Many of his theoretical predictions have been confirmed in experiments: aberrational structures due to wave self-focusing in nematics, limited lifetime of spatial solitons in media with relaxation-type nonlinearity, dynamics of thermal defocusing in the presence of forced and free convection, self-deflection of beams in nonlinear moving media, laser-induced transparency of a cloudy medium and an ozone layer, adaptive compensation of beam distortions in nonlinear media. Anatoly Sukhorukov has derived the general paraxial equation describing beam diffraction in anisotropic crystals, and originated the paraxial theory for three-wave interactions of beams and pulses under the presence of phase- and group-velocity mismatches, diffraction, and group velocity dispersion. He has developed a spatio-temporal analogy between optical beams and pulses, and predicted the effect of diffraction-dispersion incoherence for modulated waves, which limits the efficiency of frequency conversion and results in parametric mutual focusing in quadratic media. He has also predicted the phenomenon of anomalous diffraction in the parametric amplifier, and determined the optimal conditions for high-efficiency generation of the second and third harmonics in focused laser beams. He has first investigated the possibility of total energy conversion in the process of double phase-matched interaction between three frequency harmonics. He has developed the theory of up- and down parametric frequency conversion under the presence of group velocity mismatch, described the formation of three-frequency optical dissipative solitons, parametric pi ‚Äì pulses, a giant parametric pulse (confirmed experimentally), calculated the modes of the parametrical amplifier with a pulsed pump, developed the theory of stimulated Raman scattering taking into account the relaxation time and group velocity mismatch, found the quasi- phase-matching conditions for slow and fast modes in 3D photonic crystals. He has predicted the existence of a new class of localized structures ‚Äì parametric three-frequency solitons in media with quadratic nonlinearity (results published in 1974, confirmed experimentally in 1995), also discovered a new type of wave self-focusing, namely, mutual ‚Äì focusing of just three beams at different frequencies in quadratic media. He has investigated the walk-off effect on quadratic solitons, analyzed dynamics of spatial soliton trapping and interactions in bulk media, in cavities (based on the full round- trip model), in gratings (model for counter-propagating waves); proposed parametric soliton model based on the analogy with coupling of three quasi- particles; considered the tunneling of slow parametric solitons through a bounded grating. He has analyzed the quasi-phase-matched hybrid interactions in periodically polled crystals (layer model), asymmetric modes of parametric solitons, properties of ultra-narrow quadratic solitons, propagation of ultra- short optical pulses inducing plasma generation, and parametric interactions of two non-axial vortices, methods of spatio-temporal vortices generation and recording, all-optical switching with parametric refraction and reflection. He developed the theory of dispersion managed interactions of few-cycle pulses in quadratically nonlinear layered media. He has investigated the nonlinear refraction, total internal reflection and scattering of optical beams and pulses in defocusing media with Kerr, cascaded quadratic, photorefractive, and thermal nonlinearities.  Educational activities  A. P. Sukhorukov in office with students and staff A. P. Sukhorukov devoted much efforts to educate students. He was one of the leading lecturers at the Faculy of Physics. He has developed and taught for over 40 years a one-year course on \\"Theory of waves\\". He has co-authored a textbook on the course subject, now in its 2nd ed., which became a reference book for students and researchers. Scientific school created by A. P. Sukhorukov on the topic of \\"Physics of wave interactions in inhomogeneous and nonlinear media\\" is building on traditions established at Lomonosov Moscow State University by academician R. V. Khokhlov. A. P. Sukhorukov has supervised more than 80 graduate students as the Faculty of Physics, 36 PhD students, and 8 habilitation works. Together with colleagues and students, he has successfully carried out multiple scientific projects. He has organized annual Russian schools-seminars on wave phenomena for students and young scientists during 1995‚Äì2014.  Publications  A. P.

He was briefly Minister of Justice in 1829, and was made a peer of France during the July Monarchy. He is known for his hostility to the press, and for trying to hold newspaper managers responsible for libels published after they had left the paper. Early years Pierre Alpinien Bertrand Bourdeau was born in Rochechouart, Haute-Vienne, on 18 March 1770. His father was an \\"advocate in parliament\\" in the provinces of Poitou, Angoumois, P√©rigord, who acted as counsel for the town of Rochechouart. Bourdeau registered as an advocate at the court of Limoges on 3 December 1790. Bourdeau joined the revolutionary movement enthusiastically, but during the Terror (5 September 1793 ‚Äì 28 July 1794) he was treated as a suspect and imprisoned at Limoges and then Tulle. He was released after 9 Thermidor. Bourdeau practiced as an advocate at the bar of Limoges until 1815. He was a freemason. After the first Bourbon Restoration Bourdeau was appointed deputy mayor of Limoges due to his royalist views. He was thrown out of office when Napoleon returned during the Hundred Days, but after the Bourbons returned from Ghent he was reinstated, and was appointed Attorney General at the Court of Limoges. Bourbon Restoration deputy Bourdeau was elected deputy for Haute-Vienne on 22 August 1815. In 1816 Bourdeau was appointed Attorney General at the Court of Rennes. He was reelected to the Chamber of Deputies on 4 October 1816 and on 13 November 1820. Bourdeau sat with the ultra-royalists. He voted for institution of provost courts, for the law against sedition, for the \\"amnesty law\\" of 12 January 1816, for the suspension of the freedom of the press. He even stated that ministers did not have to answer questions. To demand explanations would be to encroach on royal authority and show lack of confidence in the king's ministers. He also opposed the right of petition. On 25 February 1824 Bourdeau was reelected for Haute-Vienne (Limoges). Thinking that the Ministry of Joseph de Vill√®le would soon fall, Bourdeau joined the opposition and voted against the ministry. He was dismissed from his position as attorney general. He voted consistently against the administration of Vill√®le and Peyronnet. In 1825 he spoke out against the proposal for conversion of annuities, which he expected to result in rampant speculation. He opposed a proposed law on sacrilege in 1825, and the next year spoke against the encroachments of the clergy when discussing a petition from a village priest who asked for reconciliation of the civil and canon laws concerning marriage. In the run-up to the 1827 elections Bourdeau led a very successful drive in Limoges to convince eligible voters to register and support the liberal cause. Bourdeau's mandate was renewed in the election of 17 November 1827. After the fall of the Vill√®le ministry, in 1828 Jean Baptiste Gay, vicomte de Martignac, named him Director General of Registration and Domains, and Councilor of State. The next year he was named Undersecretary of State for Justice. On 14 May 1829 he was appointed Minister of Justice, holding office until the Martignac ministry fell on 8 August 1829. In his short term of office he displayed severity against the press. Four days after leaving the ministry Bourdeau was appointed first president of Limoges and Grand Officer of the Legion of Honor. He was reelected to the Chamber of Deputies on 23 June 1830. July Monarchy After the July Revolution of 1830 Bourdeau swore allegiance to the July Monarchy. That year he again registered at the bar of the court of appeal in Limoges, but continued his political activity. He was not reelected until 1834. On 21 June 1834 he was returned for Haute-Vienne (Limoges) and joined the government majority. His health obliged him to resign the next year. He was replaced by L√©on Talabot, who was elected on 23 January 1836. He was made a peer of France on 3 October 1837. In 1841 Bourdeau won an action for defamation against the newspapers La Gazette du Centre and Le Progressif de la Haute-Vienne. Le Progressif, a radical newspaper in Limoges, was fined 10,000 francs damages. When the newspaper was found to have insufficient funds, Bourdeau tried to have the sum made up by managers who had left the newspaper before the libel occurred. The court did not accept this system of retrospective complicity, which was publicized in the press of the time as \\"Bourdeau justice.\\" Alpinien Bourdeau died in Limoges, Haute-Vienne, on 11 July 1845.

During this ride, Lamb was reported to have broken eight world's records, eight British Empire records, nineteen Victorian standing and flying start records, and a similar number of Australasian records. Lamb won the Goulburn to Sydney race twice, in 1925 and 1926. The Goulburn to Sydney was a handicap race where the slower riders start first. On each occasion Lamb started from scratch, being the last group to start, and in winning the race, also set the fastest time. The win in 1926 was controversial because Lamb had swapped bikes with another competitor, which was contrary to the written rules, however an official from the NSW Cyclists Union had assured riders before the start that they would not be disqualified for changing bikes. In 1927 Lamb was again starting from scratch and again set the fastest time, but came 9th on handicap, with the winner JA Shaw starting 52 minutes before Lamb. Lamb's time in 1925 was 6h 17' 55\\" which was 6' 35\\" better that the amateur record and 1' 36\\" better than the best professional time for the race. In 1927 Lamb finished in 6h 00' 44\\". Newspapers at the time reported that Lamb was expected to be selected for the Australian team to the 1928 Summer Olympics in Amsterdam. Lamb won the Victorian Olympic Time Trial test race in October 1927, covering 126 miles in 6h 14'43\\", winning by over 24 minutes. He then won the Australian Olympic Time Trial test race in November 1927, covering 120 miles in 6h 08'14\\", winning by over 36 minutes. Lamb also competed in the Australian Olympic track trials but was not successful. Lamb was controversially overlooked for the Australian team, with no rider being sent for the road events and Dunc Gray and Jack Standen being sent for the track events. Australian professional cycling career After being overlooked for the Olympics, Lamb chose to turn professional in February 1928, for ¬£1,000 for the season. In his first race as a professional he won a 10-mile Motor-paced event in a season best time of 11' 56\\". Lamb again rode the Goulburn to Sydney in 1928, again from scratch, this time as a professional and came second behind Ken Ross, also from scratch. In 1929 Lamb won the Austral Wheel Race . He then spent six months riding in the United States, defeating motorpaced champion Franco Giorgetti, George Chapman, Charles Jaeger, and Francesco Zucchetti. Lamb also led the first 2 days of the 6 days‚Äô race at Chicago but had to withdraw due to injury. Lamb twice won the Australian national road race title in 1930 and 1932, by winning the Blue Riband for the fastest time in the Warrnambool to Melbourne.. Lamb set a record time of 6h 21' 18\\" in 1932, nearly 2 hours faster than his time in 1930. Lamb rode in the 1931 Tour de France in a combined Australia/Switzerland team including Opperman, Ossie Nicholson and Frankie Thomas. He finished in 35th place and was the last finisher. After the Tour de France, Lamb won the Grand Prix de Marseilles (motor pace) In 1932 Lamb won the Brisbane, Six Days with Jack Standen, defeating a quality field including Frankie Thomas, Opperman and Jack Fitzgerald. In 1933 Lamb rode 60 miles and 575 yards in an hour to break the motor paced record set by Opperman in 1930. He also won the Tour of Tasmania, a six-day stage race covering , beating Frankie Thomas by 1 second. In 1934 Lamb again won the Tour of Tasmania, titled the \\"Batman 1000\\" a race over 8 stages covering starting in Launceston and finishing in Ulverstone. Lamb narrowly defeated Ern Milliken with Opperman in 3rd place. Lamb had barely completed one long stage race when he set off in the next, for the rich prize purse in the Centenary 1000, a one-week race over seven stages covering that carried with it the Australasian road championship title. While Lamb did not feature in the early stages, his strength showed through on the arduous sixth stage, extended to 152 miles (245 km) after stage 5 had to be stopped at Mount Buffalo due to a torrential downpour of rain hail and sleet. Lamb was 3rd and fastest at Sale, and finished 3rd overall in the championship and the Australasian road championship title.

He is most known for having initiated the first Yukon land claim, in 1902. His leadership allowed the First Nations from the southern region of the Yukon to make the transition from a traditional way of life to a Euro-Canadian economy. In 2001, he was designated a Person of National Historic Significance.Boss, Jim National Historic Person Biography Chief Jim Boss of Lebarge and Chief John Fraser of Champagne during the 1948 Whitehorse Winter Carnival Boss in full war dress, 1950 Jim Boss was born to Mundessa (Old Man Chief) from Hutshi and Lande from Tagish. He had three sisters: Maggie Boss (Shuwateen), Jenny Boss (Tus√°xal) and Susie Boss(Shaan Tlein).Jim boss also had a brother named Yandeyelh, no known English name. His first job was to trade goods between the Coastal and Inland First Nations. At the onset of the Klondike Gold Rush in 1896, in an effort both to preserve his people's rights and to profit, he abandoned his previous profession to set up a roadhouse, with the help of his brother-in-law, Henry Broeren, near Horse Creek to service the sternwheeler traffic on Lake Laberge. This was the first of multiple roadhouses he would come to own.Parks Canada - News Releases and Backgrounders During this time he also had a lumber and fishing operation, and owned the Takhini Hot Springs. In addition, he taught the North-West Mounted Police how to survive in the Yukon. In 1900, he petitioned the Commissioner of the Yukon for a 1600-acre (647-hectare) reserve for his people, but was granted only 320 acres (129 hectares). Having received less than he wished, he began to draft a petition to the Superintendent of Indian Affairs. In 1902, Boss employed a Whitehorse lawyer, T.W. Jackson, to communicate with the Government of Canada requesting that they and the King, Edward VII, begin a treaty or land claims discussions with the Yukon First Nations.History of Yukon First Nations People In a letter to the Superintendent General of Indian Affairs, Boss demanded that Jackson write: \\"Tell the King very hard, we want something for our Indians because they take our land and game.\\"The History of Land Claims and Self-Government in the Yukon In his petition he included an estimated census of various tribes. His total was 810, even though before the eight years of the gold rush, there had been several thousand natives. This occurred due to the introduction of smallpox, influenza, measles and tuberculosis through those participating in the gold rush. The plea was denied. It was only in the 1970s, when the issue of First Nation territory was raised again, that Boss' petition was used to assert claims. By 1915, among the numerous businesses he ran during his life, he also operated one of the Yukon's fifteen fox fur farms. Boss was married three times. His first marriage was to Kathleen Kitty, whom he had a son, Fred. His second marriage was to Maude, with whom he had four children: Alice, David, Lena and Ned.

Three Twins opened a factory in Petaluma, California in 2010. In mid-2019 it moved all manufacturing operations to the former plant of Zurheide Ice Cream in Sheboygan, Wisconsin (which it had purchased in 2014); its corporate headquarters remained in Petaluma. On April 17, 2020, the company announced it was closing due to financial problems compounded by the coronavirus pandemic.

It is produced in Italy by Pallini S.p.A. a family-owned and operated beverage company based in Rome, Italy. It is 26% alcohol by volume, 52 proof. The limoncello was introduced in 1999, and is based on a 100-year-old Pallini family recipe. It is imported and distributed in the US by Castle Brands Inc (New York, NY). Company history Nicola Pallini (b. 1851) was a prominent merchant in Antrodoco, a town in the Abruzzi region of Italy. His businesses included coal imports, banking, chesnut farms, and general stores, for which he produced wine and various cordials. In 1922, the family moved the business to Rome. There it expanded its liquor production, finding success with Mistra', an anise-based liqueur. This is where they began producing handcrafted Romana Sambuca. In 1962, Giorgio and Nicola Pallini (Virgilio's sons) foresaw the growth potential of Romana Sambuca and decided to move the company out of the centre of Rome to a larger, modern facility, where it remains today. Living in New York in the 1970s, Virgilio Pallini Jr (current President) negotiated distribution in the US. The effect of this was an explosion of Sambuca Romana. Romana, as well as Disaronno and Galliano, was among the first Italian liqueurs to penetrate US market. After a few years Romana became the category leader with volumes around 300,000 9 liter case. Today the brand is owned by Diageo, but Pallini remains the exclusive producer. In 1999, the Pallini family introduced Pallini Limoncello, based on a traditional family recipe. Two more flavors, Pallini Raspicello and Pallini Peachello were also put into production. After 10 years Pallini Limoncello is the no. 1 premium Limoncello brand in the world and is distributed worldwide.  Production  Pallini Limoncello is made using sfusato lemons grown on the Amalfi Coast of Italy. The lemons arrived on the coast hundreds of years ago, carried by sailors from the Middle East.New York Times They have low acid levels and a delicate flavor, as well as a thick peel, which make them ideal for the production of limoncello. The lemons are handpicked, peeled and shipped to the production facility in Rome, where the lemon zest is steeped in neutral alcohol derived from sugar beets, making it the most suitable for liquors. This infusion process releases the oils in the zest into the alcohol, which imparts the lemon flavor. Beet sugar and E102 (Yellow 5) is then added to the infused alcohol, and it is bottled and shipped worldwide.Pallini Website  Certifications & Identifications  * PGI organic lemons * Gluten- free * Kosher * GMO Free product * Allergen (ex 2003/89) free * Pure natural Italian sugar  Flavors  *Limoncello ‚Äì traditional lemon-flavored Italian digestif *Raspicello ‚Äì liqueur made with a blend of raspberries, blueberries, cassis and black currants (26.0% alcohol by volume) *Peachello ‚Äì liqueur made with Italian white peaches (26.0% alcohol by volume)  Recent Reviews  In 2012, Pallini Limoncello received a 92 from the Beverage Tasting Institute,BTI website review as well as a 91 from the Ultimate Spirits Challenge, in which the brand was \\"highly recommended.\\"Ultimate Beverage Challenge website review The brand also received a rating of 90-95 from Wine Enthusiast in 2005.Wine Enthusiast website review Pallini Raspicello received a rating of 92 points from the Beverage Tasting Institute in 2012,BTI website review while Pallini Peachello received a rating of 90 points.BTI website review  References   External links  *Pallini Limoncello website *Pallini S.p.A. website *Castle Brands website Italian liqueurs Citrus liqueurs Products introduced in 1999 ","title":"Pallini Limoncello"},{"id":"42547001","title":"Hacking Team"},{"id":"42547003","text":"Bianco d'Alessano is a white Italian wine grape variety that is grown in the Apulia region of southern Italy, where it is often blended with Verdeca.

The grape has a long history of cultivation in Apulia, and in 2008 DNA analysis showed that the Iuvarello grape that has historically been grown in Calabria was, in fact, Bianco d'Alessano. Viticulture Bianco d'Alessano is a mid to late ripening grape variety that maintains high levels of acidity even when allowed to hang on the vine late into the growing season before harvest. In Australia, the grape tends to be harvested later in the season than it does in Italy. Wine regions Vineyards in the region of Apulia, where Bianco d'Alessano is grown. In 2000, there were of Bianco d'Alessano in cultivation in Italy with the vast majority of the plantings in Apulia, particularly in the Murgia region in the province of Taranto.

Several groups traditionally viewed as having a blastocoelomate condition are viewed here as acoelomates (e.g., Gastrotricha, Entoprocta, Gnathostomulida). Some of the coelomates groups (e.g., Arthropoda, Mollusca) have greatly reduced celomic spaces; often the main body cavity is a bloodfilled space called a hemocoel, and is associated with an open circulatory system. The Brachiopoda, Ectoprocta and Phoronida are viewed as lophophorates. In a phylogeny,Richard C. Brusca & Gary J.

Founded in 1984, it accommodates nearly 4,000 patients and 22,000 patient visits annually. History Milan Puskar Health Right, originally Morgantown Health Right, was founded in 1984 on the premise, \\"Every person has a right to health care regardless of their insurance status or ability to pay.\\" For its first few months Health Right operated out of a Baptist church until a retiring physician offered his Spruce Street office rent-free. With its first capital campaign, Health Right purchased a small building with three examination rooms at 154 Pleasant Street, which it outgrew within months. The clinic moved to its current location in May 2003. It was renamed in 2004 to honor Milan Puskar a businessman and philanthropist who generously supported the clinic since its inception. In 2008 the clinic went paperless adopting the HEALTHeWV electronic medical records system. The Marg M. Carney award for excellence in volunteerism was established by the clinic in 2013. The inaugural recipient was Bill McCutcheon, a dentist. Overview Milan Puskar Health Right is located at 341 Spruce Street in Morgantown, West Virginia, and has satellite clinics in Marion and Preston counties. Health Right provides health care, dental care, medications, case management, mental health, and social services. Nearly 4,000 patients make over 22,000 visits to Health Right a year. The clinic dispenses and fills about 62,000 prescriptions each year. Health Right's main clinic is open over 400 hours a month. There is a Teen Clinic and family planning services are offered. The Teen Clinic model they developed has been proposed as a way to make services more teen-friendly. The Homeless Care Clinic has 400 visits yearly. The Student and Faculty Experience Clinic (SAFE) is run by students of the West Virginia University School of Medicine. In 2008 and 2009 there were 142 volunteers including 21 physicians and 6 pharmacists. there were 34 nurse practitioners and physician assistants providing services at Health Right. The National Committee for Quality Assurance gives the clinic its highest rating for patient-centered care and recognizes it as a medical home. Health Right clients must be uninsured and have income no more than 150% of the federal poverty level. the poverty rate in West Virginia is almost 18% and 19% in Monongalia County. West Virginia was the state where it was most likely uninsured adults would go without healthcare and 22% of adult West Virginians did not have health insurance. Many of the clinic's clients are people who work but do not make enough to pay for health care. Some work for employers who do not offer health insurance, some work part-time and do not qualify for benefits and others cannot afford the insurance offered by their employer. In 2009 there was a waiting list of 200 to 300. Funding and support Milan Puskar Health Right Inc. is a 501(c)(3) nonprofit organization listed with GuideStar. It is a member of United Way of Monongalia and Preston Counties, United Way of Marion County, and the National Association of Free Clinics. Health Right received $8.4 million worth of in-kind donations in 2004. Health Right received funds in 2013 from a Community Development Block Grant for the Homeless Care Clinic. The Walmart Foundation awarded Health Right a grant in 2010. In 2008 Health Right received a grant from the American Medical Association Foundation to fund a health education program. Partnerships with West Virginia University Hospitals, Monongalia Health System, University Health Associates and Mylan Pharmaceuticals help the clinic fulfill its mission . West Virginia University School of Dentistry supports the dental care program. Continuing role Executive Director Laura Jones sees an important continuing role in providing education and access to health care for Health Right and free clinics despite the effects of the Affordable Care Act (ACA). She states, \\"We don't expect a drop in need\\" and, \\"Even with the passage of the health care bill, our work is needed as much as ever\\". In 2013 Health Right received a mini-grant to help with enrollment in health insurance options available under the ACA.

Content The cook book contains recipes supplied by members of MacLeod's constituency, of the Progressive Conservative Party of Ontario (her own party), and of the federal Conservative Party of Canada. The book's recipes include chickpea curry from Jason Kenney (a cabinet minister from Calgary who has the nickname \\"curry in a hurry\\"). Minister of National Defence and Member of Parliament from Nova Scotia Peter MacKay supplied a recipe for lobster bisque, while Prime Minister Stephen Harper shared his wife's salsa recipe. The cover features MacLeod dressed like Betty Crocker, holding a tray of cookies. Background and title During the 2007 Ontario election, Liberal blogger Warren Kinsella published an altered photograph of MacLeod, John Tory, and Scott Reid listening to Randy Hillier (another Canadian politician) speak. He placed thought bubbles over each of the listeners' heads, with MacLeod's suggesting that she would rather be baking cookies than attending the event. MacLeod, however, was visiting her father at that time, who was ill with cancer. Following backlash from other political candidates, Kinsella issued an apology, and noted that the joke did not go over well with his wife.

After serving during World War II as a major in the Royal Engineers, he joined the family business Yarrows of Scotstoun, Glasgow in 1946, becoming managing director when aged 38 and chairman, following the death of his father, Harold Yarrow, in 1962 when Sir Eric was aged 42. Later he became President of Yarrow plc until 1987, and was a non-executive director of the Clydesdale Bank from 1962 to 1985 then chairman until 1991. He is credited with steering successfully the distinguished Glasgow shipbuilding company through some of the most turbulent periods in the British shipbuilding industry's history and with enhancing the name and status of the family firm when many shipyards were failing. Critical to the success was maintaining and developing the relationship with the Royal Navy, where a Yarrow ship was traditionally regarded as a fast ship. (Yarrows having built the first destroyer to exceed 30 knots). Sir Eric went to great efforts to maintain and develop this reputation, leading to a stream of orders from the Royal Navy and overseas navies when new business was thin on the ground. As a result, Yarrows became a prime contractor on the Type 21, Type 22, Type 23 and Type 45 frigate programmes for the Royal Navy and remains involved in the Type 26 programme alongside the Govan yard. Yarrow was appointed a Vice-President of RINA in 1972 as well as serving as prime warden of the Shipwrights' Company (1970‚Äì71), among other charitable activities. Appointed Member of the Order of the British Empire (MBE) for military service in 1946, he succeeded as 3rd baronet in 1962, upon the death of his father, Sir Harold Yarrow Bt GBE, later becoming a Deputy Lieutenant for Renfrewshire in 1970. He is succeeded to the title by his eldest grandson, Ross.  Business career  The relationship with the Royal Navy was key to success of Yarrows, and during his career Sir Eric worked with 12 successive Controllers, the Navy's professional head of procurement. Sir Eric also believed in the need to travel in order to win business, believing that sitting in his office was unlikely to lead to orders. The countries he visited successfully included Thailand, Malaysia, India, Portugal, Iran, Ghana, Peru, Venezuela, Hong Kong, Chile and South Africa. Throughout his career at Scotstoun, Sir Eric was in favour of modernisation and this led, amongst other developments, to the building of the covered berth, which enabled indoor ship construction in comfort during long, cold, dark Scottish winters. The berth was enlarged to allow building of two Type 22 frigates under cover. Neighbouring yards were acquired to lengthen the waterfront and provide additional facilities, the price of one being negotiated on the golf course with Sir John Hunter. Similar far-sighted steps led to the establishment of the Yarrow Admiralty Research Department (YARD) as a separate subsidiary, an organisation which worked closely on engineering and design with the Royal Navy and other navies and shipping companies worldwide. This helped strengthen links with the RN, and Sir Eric deserves credit for building on the existing foundations for the exceptional partnership between the Navy and Yarrows which continues to this day. Most critically for the firm, the long-term investment and manufacturing credentials ensured that when the number of warship yards was dramatically reduced by the Navy in the 1970s, Yarrows was chosen as one of mainstream contractors alongside Swan Hunter, Vosper (for the Type 21s) and Cammell Laird. 5 out of 8 Type 21s, 10 out of 14 Type 22s, 12 out of 16 Type 23s and all the Type 45s were built at Scotstoun, demonstrating the firm's dominance in the market for medium-sized RN surface vessels. Sir Eric also took pride in a good working relationship with the trade unions and took time to ensure that employees were informed of successes and failures. Sir Eric was consistently against the concept of amalgamation of the yards on the Clyde, and turned down the invitation from the Minister of Technology, Tony Benn, to chair Upper Clyde Shipbuilders. Benn described him as a coward when he refused the role, a decision Sir Eric always regarded the best of his business life. UCS acquired a 51% stake in Yarrow Shipbuilders Ltd, (YSL) the shipbuilding subsidiary, when it became clear that the Royal Navy was likely to come under political pressure to exclude Yarrows from naval orders if the firm was not part of the UCS Group. A shotgun was in effect put at Sir Eric's head. As UCS lurched from crisis to crisis, in 1970 Sir Eric negotiated the extraction of YSL from UCS, thereby saving the shipbuilding name and commercial viability of Yarrows when UCS went into receivership in 1971. Had he been chairman of UCS, this would not have been possible and Yarrows would likely have fallen into receivership. The creation of a group holding company and a number of subsidiaries ensured that even if the shipbuilding entity was interfered with politically, other parts of the group could not be affected, which proved a wise move as it was not long before politics intervened again. The shipbuilding subsidiary of Yarrow and Co was nationalised in 1977 under the terms of the highly contested Aircraft and Shipbuilding Act. The successful and profitable yards were all swept into the net. There was a feeling in the firm that it was provocative that the last naval ship before nationalisation was launched by Audrey Callaghan, wife of the then Prime Minister, but with a certain amount of wry amusement in the family that the ship she named was . Sir Eric always felt the compensation terms were grossly inadequate, as they were based on profitability and the share price in 1972, when both profits and the stock market were depressed. He used to say that no one likes to be robbed, whether one's home, one's wallet or one's business. When in opposition the Conservative Party had fiercely challenged the enacted compensation terms, but lost interest in improving the terms once back in power. Sir Eric fought with other firms through to the European Court of Human Rights for improved compensation but the Court found in the (Conservative) Government's favour. Subsequently, Yarrow Shipbuilders was privatised by Thatcher from British Shipbuilders in a sale to GEC Marconi (for over five times the original price paid) and the original shipbuilding company now forms part of the defence interests of BAE systems, continuing to operate from the 1906 site on the Clyde, and currently partly responsible for the building of Type 26 destroyers, the next generation frigate for the Royal Navy. The firm also built some of the modules for the new Elizabeth Class aircraft carriers. What is less well known about the Yarrow business was that it had a very successful marine and land boiler section, something which stemmed from Alfred Yarrow's inventive genius, and which provided a counterweight to the dependence on naval ships, and when business was lean on the shipbuilding side. A number of technical advances led to more power being produced from a given size of boiler, and this proved important in terms of the power to weight ratio of boilers, essential in small vessels with cramped engine room space. Sir Eric was equally interested in sales on the land side, and Yarrow boilers were widely used in power generation installations in the UK, (CEGB and SSEB that were) and also in many countries overseas. Sir Eric particularly enjoyed his trips to South Africa, which somehow coincided with the depths of the Scottish Winter. There were also numerous sales of marine boilers to ships built by other shipbuilding companies, Yarrow boilers providing power for Cunard's Queen Mary in 1936 and the Queen Elizabeth in 1940. One year after nationalisation Sir Eric left the shipyard to focus on the parent company. In the early 1980s he fought off a bid for the Company from the Weir Group. After he was 65 he retired from the parent company, which consisted then mainly of YARD. He then became a non-executive Chairman of the Clydesdale Bank, (following his father's footsteps) a post he greatly enjoyed. During the time he visited all 270 branches of the Bank. He remembered being summoned to the chairman's house in Kilmacolm, Renfrewshire to be asked to join the \\"best bank board in Scotland\\". Subsequently, he had to have an introductory meeting with the chief executive. At this meeting the conversation went as follows: ‚ÄúYou must remember to be discreet and not share confidences with ladies at cocktail parties. The chairman does not like people being late for board meetings. The chairman does not like people leaving the board meetings early. Nor does he like it if directors say very much in between.‚Äù  Philanthropic and other interests  At home Sir Eric held appointments with a number of shipbuilding and other engineering organisations He was Deacon of the Incorporation of Hammermen in the Trades House in Glasgow in 1961, Prime Warden of the Worshipful Company of Shipwrights in 1970, and was made a Fellow of the Royal Society of Edinburgh in 1975. He also followed the family tradition of support for the Princess Louise Hospital at Erskine, acting as chairman of the board of governors for several years, and personally supporting many functions and fund-raising activities. He also took an active interest in the Burma Star Association, becoming president of the Scottish Branch in 1990.  Personal life  On 28 April 1951, he married Rosemary Ann Young (who died in 1957). They had one child, a son, Richard Grant Yarrow (born 21 March 1953; died 1987), who by his wife Sheila Allison (married 1982) had two sons, including Ross Yarrow (born 1985), who inherited his title. Yarrow married second, on 23 May 1959, Annette Elizabeth Fran√ßoise Steven, by whom he had three more sons ‚Äì Norman, Peter (twins, born 1960) and David Yarrow (born 1966). The couple divorced in 1975. Sir Eric lived in Renfrewshire with his third wife, Caroline Botting, n√©e Masters, whom he married in 1982.

They released their self-titled debut album on August 5, 2014. The band's musical style on the album has been described as hard rock, alternative metal, melodic metalcore and modern heavy metal. History In May 2013, As I Lay Dying frontman Tim Lambesis was arrested for soliciting the murder of his wife. The remaining members soon began experimenting and writing with vocalist Shane Blay of Oh, Sleeper. Lambesis' arrest negatively affected his relationships with As I Lay Dying, which resulted in the departure of all members except for Jordan Mancino, who had been sharing an ownership for the band's rights with Lambesis since 2006. After a short meeting, they decided to put discussions of the future of As I Lay Dying on hold. From 2013 to 2014, the newly formed Wovenwar had been in the process of making a self-titled debut album with the producer Bill Stevenson. The mixing for the album was done by Colin Richardson. The band's debut single, \\"All Rise\\", was released on April 21, 2014. On June 18, 2014, the band released a second single from the album, titled \\"The Mason\\". The album itself was released on August 5, 2014 through Metal Blade Records. The third single of the album, \\"Death to Rights\\", was the third-most added song on active rock radio in late February 2015.

He and his family would remain highly honored during the time of Wu's successor state Southern Tang.  Background  Li Decheng was born in 863, during the reign of Emperor Yizong of Tang. He was from Guangling (Âª£Èôµ, in modern Yangzhou, Jiangsu ‚Äî although an alternative account indicated that he was from Xihua (Ë•øËèØ, in modern Zhoukou, Henan).Zizhi Tongjian, vol. 258. In his youth, he came under the service of the late-Tang warlord Zhao Huang, who was then the governor (ËßÄÂØü‰Ωø, Guangchashi) of Xuanshe Circuit (ÂÆ£Ê≠ô, headquartered in modern Xuancheng, Anhui). As of 889, Zhao and his capital Xuan Prefecture () were under the siege by another warlord, Yang Xingmi the prefect of Lu Prefecture (Âª¨Â∑û, in modern Hefei, Anhui). The siege became desperate enough that Zhao's officer Zhou Jinsi () expelled Zhao and defended the city himself. Zhao tried to flee to Guangling (which was then under the control of the greater warlord Sun Ru, who then ruled Huainan Circuit (Ê∑ÆÂçó, headquartered at Guangling)), but was captured by Yang (and subsequently executed). It was said that during Zhao's expulsion and capture, only Li and another officer, Han Qiu (), did not abandon him, and apparently were also captured by Yang. Yang was set to send Li back into the city to try to persuade Zhou to surrender, but Li fell ill at that time, so Yang sent Han, whom Zhou promptly executed. However, the other officers in the city soon seized Zhou and surrendered. Impressed with Li, Yang gave the daughter of a clansman to him in marriage.  Service under Yang Xingmi during Tang  Yang Xingmi took over Xuanshe, which then- reigning Emperor Zhaozong (Emperor Yizong's son) then upgraded into Ningguo Circuit () and made Yang its military governor (Jiedushi). Yang then entered into an alliance with the major warlord Zhu Quanzhong the military governor of Xuanwu Circuit (ÂÆ£Ê≠¶, headquartered in modern Kaifeng, Henan), against Sun Ru. In 891, Sun, believing that he should destroy Yang first, decided to abandon Guangling and take his entire army south against Yang's Ningguo army. He thus set fire to the city of Guangling and departed it. In the aftermaths of the city's burning, Yang sent Zhang Xun () and Li Decheng to Guangling, to put out the fires in the city and to save the grain there so that the people would not starve. Subsequently, when another warlord, Shi Pu the military governor of Wuning Circuit (Ê≠¶ÂØß, headquartered in modern Xuzhou, Jiangsu) tried to head south to take over Huainan, Yang sent Li and Zhang Xun to face him, and they defeated and repelled him at Chu Prefecture (Ê•öÂ∑û, in modern Huai'an, Jiangsu), forcing him to withdraw; they also then used this opportunity to seize Chu's prefect Liu Zan () and take over that prefecture for Yang. Yang later defeated Sun, took over Huainan, and eventually took the entire region.Zizhi Tongjian, vol. 259. In 903, Tian Jun the military governor of Ningguo and An Renyi () the military prefect (ÂúòÁ∑¥‰Ωø, Tuanlianshi) of Run Prefecture (ÊΩ§Â∑û, in modern Zhenjiang, Jiangsu), both Yang's vassals, jointly rose in rebellion against him. Tian was soon defeated and killed by Yang's general Tai Meng (), and another Yang general, Wang Maozhang then put Run under siege,Zizhi Tongjian, vol. 264. but because An was a capable defender, the city's defense held up to spring 905, when Wang's forces finally entered the city by digging a tunnel in. Nevertheless, An held out in a tower, and initially, the Huainan forces did not dare to approach it. However, as Li, who participated in the siege effort, remained civil to An throughout the siege whereas the other Huainan generals were insulting, An stated to him, \\"You are polite. I am going to make myself your accomplishment.\\" An then descended the tower, surrendered to Li, and further gave his favorite concubine to Li. Li delivered him and his sons to Guangling, where they were executed.Zizhi Tongjian, vol. 265. Yang then commissioned Li as the prefect of Run.  During Hongnong/Wu  Later, by which time Tang had fallen and Yang Xingmi's domain, which was ruled successively by his sons Yang Wo and Yang Longyan, became known as Hongnong, and then Wu. However, the power soon fell effectively into the hands of the regent Xu Wen, as he and another general, Zhang Hao, had assassinated Yang Wo, and he then killed Zhang and supported Yang Longyan as Yang Wo's successor.Zizhi Tongjian, vol. 266. As Li, as the prefect of Run, had a habit of visiting the area outside the city at night, Xu came to suspect him of plotting against Xu's governance, and therefore moved him to Jiang Prefecture (Ê±üÂ∑û, in modern Jiujiang, Jiangxi). Realizing that Xu suspected him, Li sent his fourth son Li Jianxun to pay homage to Xu. Xu was impressed by Li Jianxun's studiousness, and believed that this showed Li Decheng was not intending rebellion. He further gave a daughter to Li Jianxun in marriage.Spring and Autumn Annals of the Ten Kingdoms, vol. 21. Li Decheng was later made the military governor of Weiwu Circuit (Â®ÅÊ≠¶, somewhat of an honorary title, as Weiwu was traditionally headquartered in modern Fuzhou, Fujian, then under the control of Wu's southeastern neighbor Min) and put in charge of Fu Prefecture (Êí´Â∑û, in modern Fuzhou, Jiangxi ‚Äî not the same Fuzhou as Weiwu's traditional headquarter site).Zizhi Tongjian, vol. 270.As Hongnong did not take over Fu Prefecture until 909, Li's commission likely came at that time or later. See Zizhi Tongjian, vol. 266. While he was at Fu, there was an occasion when the arrogant junior regent Xu Zhixun (Xu Wen's oldest biological son), hearing that Li had many singing girls in his household, demanded that Li give some to him. When Li responded that these singing girls were too old for Xu and that he would try to find younger and more beautiful ones for Xu, Xu responded to Li's messenger, \\"One day I will kill Li Decheng and take even his wife!\\" (However, this threat was never carried out, as Xu Zhixun himself was thereafter assassinated by the general Zhu Jin and replaced by his far more civil adoptive brother Xu Zhigao.) At some point (unclear when), another marital connection was made between the two families, as one of Li's daughters married Xu Zhigao's son Xu Jingda. In 919, when Yang Longyan declared himself the King of Wu (as an independent ruler away from any titles bestowed by the now defunct Tang state), Li Decheng was given the honorary chancellor title of Zhongshu Ling () and Pingnan Dajiangjun (). Shortly after, he was transferred to Baisheng Circuit (ÁôæÂãù, headquartered in modern Ganzhou, Jiangxi). Later, during the Dahe era (929-935) of Yang Longyan's brother and successor Yang Pu (who was then carrying the title of emperor), Li was made the military governor of Zhennan Circuit (ÈéÆÂçó, headquartered in modern Nanchang, Jiangxi). It was said that while Li had no great accomplishments on the battlefield, his seniority allowed him to become greatly honored. By 936, Xu Zhigao, who was then senior regent, was planning to have Yang Pu yield the throne to him. As he believed Li and Zhou Ben to be the most senior generals of the realm and that having their outward support would affirm his power, he had them go to Guangling to lead the officials in petitioning Yang Pu to do so, and then go to Jinling (where Xu was then stationed as regent) to petition him to accept. This led the senior official Song Qiqiu, who was a long-time friend of Xu's but opposed all this, to state to Li Jianxun, \\"Your honored father was a great contributor to Emperor Taizu [(i.e., Yang Xingmi)], but now his accomplishments are destroyed.\\"Zizhi Tongjian, vol. 280. Song also apparently wrote a letter to Li, trying to stop him. However, Xu soon accepted the throne, ending Wu and starting Southern Tang.Zizhi Tongjian, vol. 281.  During Southern Tang  After Xu Zhigao took the throne, he feasted with the high-level officials, and at the feast, Li Decheng showed Song Qiqiu's letter to him. However, Xu refused to read it, although Song nevertheless apologized. Xu bestowed on Li Decheng the honorary title Taishi () and created him the Prince of Nanping. After the transition, for some time, Yang Pu, whom Xu still honored with the title of \\"Rang Huang\\" (ËÆìÁöá, \\"emperor who yielded\\"), continued to reside at Wu's former palace at Guangling, but he was apprehensive and wanted to move out. Li Decheng also spoke in favor of moving Yang, and thereafter Xu sent Li Jianxun to Guangling to escort Yang and his family to the inner city of Run Prefecture, which Xu renamed Danyang Palace to serve as the Yang family's residence. In 939, Xu Zhigao changed his family name back from his adoptive family name of Xu to his original family name of Li and also took on a new personal name of Bian. A controversy thereafter evolved whether Xu Jingda, whose name was also then changed to Li Jingda, then the Prince of Xin, could remain married to Li Decheng's daughter, as Chinese traditions against endogamy prohibited the marriage between persons of the same family name. Li Bian issued an edict stating that due to the great accomplishments of Li Decheng, the marriage should remain intact; rather, he ordered that the Princess of Xin use Nanping as her family name. Li Decheng was later given the greater title of Prince of Zhao. He died in 940.

From 1948 to 1952 he represented the Liberal People's Party in the second chamber of the Riksdag. Sports career H√§ckner was Swedish champion in the javelin throw in 1913, 1914, 1917 and 1918. In all these years the two-handed format was used: the javelin was separately thrown with the right hand and the left hand, with the best results for both hands added together. In 1917 he broke Urho Peltonen's world record for this event, totalling 114.28 and throwing 61.81 with his better hand. As throwing the javelin with both hands soon became a rarity, H√§ckner's world record has never been officially broken. Norway's Olav Sunde achieved a total of 117.21 in 1930, throwing 66.86 with his better hand, but that record wasn't officially ratified as the competition had been unsanctioned.

Development started in 1949 at the Yaroslavl Automobile Plant Design Bureau as the YaAZ-225. It was planned to install a cab from the YaAZ-200, offset to the left. However, further technical documentation was passed on to MAZ where the design was substantially enhanced. Appearance The cab appearance changed slightly during production. On the early models the hood was the same width as the cab, in the later editions, it became much narrower. Initially, a guard was installed on the hood sides for safety while the engine was serviced, but was later removed. On the early models a chrome bison hood ornament was placed on the front of the hood while on later models the bison emblem was stamped into the sides. In addition, the early MAZ-525 grille externally resembled that of the MAZ-200. Variants In 1952, the MAZ-E-525D was developed to work in tandem with a 15m¬≥ D-189 tractor-scraper. In 1954, the joint efforts of MAZ, Institute of Mining and Kharkov Trolleybus Depot developed a trolley dump truck equipped with two D-202 trolleybus electric motors with total capacity of . In 1964, NAMI developed a similar truck called the DTU-25. In 1959, the MAZ-525 was used as a basis for the MAZ-541 aircraft tug, of which three were built. Also in 1959, the MAZ-525A tractor was developed as part of a road train with the 45-ton BelAZ-5271 semitrailer, but this did not enter production because the engine was not powerful enough. Production moved In 1959, production was transferred to the Belarusian Automobile Plant, where the truck was produced until 1965 under the name BelAZ-525. At the same time the MAZ bison on the side on the hood disappeared and was replaced with the \\"BELAZ\\" inscription. Use Operation of machines continued until the early 1970s. The MAZ-525 participated in virtually every major Soviet construction site in the 1950s and 1960s, as well as in overseas construction projects (e.g. in the construction of the Aswan Dam in Egypt).

He was Minister of Religious Affairs from 3 March to 8 August 1829. He caused a storm of protest from the other bishops in France when he signed an ordinance aimed at restricting the influence of the church in schools. Early years Fran√ßois-Hyacinthe-Jean Feutrier was born in Paris on 3 April 1785. He studied at the seminary of Saint-Sulpice under Abb√© Emery, and embraced a career in the church. He was ordained a priest on 27 May 1809. Feutrier was named secretary-general of the high chaplaincy by Cardinal Joseph Fesch. The cardinal also helped him to become a member of the council convoked in Paris by Napoleon to settle disputes between the French government and Pope Pius VII. He contributed to that council's resistance to the emperor's wishes. After the first Bourbon Restoration, Archbishop Talleyrand-P√©rigord of Reims, high chaplain of France, sponsored Feutrier, whose position in the high chaplaincy was confirmed by King Louis XVIII of France. Feutrier left during the Hundred Days when Napoleon returned from exile, despite the assurances of Cardinal Fesch, then was re-installed after the return of the king. He was soon made honorary canon of the royal chapel of Saint-Denis, then cur√© of La Madeleine, Paris. In this position he demonstrated piety, charity and great energy. His sermons were remarkable. On 8 May 1821 he pronounced the panegyric on Joan of Arc in Orl√©ans Cathedral. In February 1823 Feutrier was named vicar-general of the diocese of Paris and a member of the diocese council of the Archbishop, Mgr. Hyacinthe-Louis de Qu√©len. He was selected Bishop of Beauvais on 26 January 1825, confirmed as bishop on 21 March 1825 and ordained on 24 April 1825 by Hyacinthe-Louis de Qu√©len, Archbishop of Paris. Minister Mgr Denis-Luc Frayssinous, who had been Minister of Public Education and Religious Affairs in the Ministry of Jean-Baptiste de Martignac, was dismissed in 1828. A layman, Antoine Lefebvre de Vatimesnil, was given the Ministry of Public Education. Feutrier was appointed Minister of Ecclesiastical Affairs on 3 March 1828. On 16 June 1828 two ordinances by King Charles X of France were issued, one countersigned by Joseph-Marie, comte Portalis and the other by Feutrier. The first, intended to reduce the influence of the church in education, limited the number of pupils in ecclesiastic schools to 20,000, and obliged the pupils to start wearing the clerical habit after two years since the schools were considered junior seminaries. The other ordinance required all teachers to sign a document in which they declared that they did not belong to any unauthorized religious congregation. This was mainly aimed at the Jesuits. The bishops reacted angrily and Feutrier was denounced as a traitor. The bishops, headed by Clermont-Tonerre, addressed a memorandum of protest to the king. Charles X had to ask Pope Leo XII to intervene to calm things down. Feutrier left office on 8 August 1829 when the Martignac ministry was dismissed. He was given the title of Count and made a peer of France. He was a member of the Legion of Honor. His health gradually deteriorated, and he visited Paris to consult with doctors. Feutrier was found dead in his bed there on 27 June 1830, aged forty-five. An autopsy found the cause was an effusion on the brain.

Design Stretch Screamers were a line of toy monsters from the early 2000s that could be stretched, causing them to scream. They also featured a \\"balloon feature\\" that when squeezed, balls of colored liquid would pop out. Older models featured plastic hands that were prone to popping off of the rubber arms and the balloon effect was filled with an iridescent colored fluid. Newer models had soft rubber hands and gel and floating objects replacing the colored fluid inside the balloon effect. Stretch Screamers had several other toy lines including, Mini Stretch Screamers, Blister Beasts, Splat Bugz, and Stretch Screamers Oozers. At one point in the early 2000s, the toys were quite popular, so much so that they had their own McDonald's Happy Meal toy line in 2003.http://www.millionaireplayboy.com/toys/mcstretch.php However, they have since fallen into obscurity and have been discontinued and have been known to fetch high prices online. The toys have since been redesigned and re-released in both 2010 and 2016 in the UK and several other countries. nhttp://coolandcollected.com/yard-sale-finds-stretch-wolfman- dungeon-dice-and-pogs/ Toys Series 1 and 2 * \\"Mummy\\" Featured in the first TV ad, had an emaciated grey, semi-skeletal face with a red tongue and yellow eyes. it wore an Egyptian style cloth tunic which could be removed from the figure. When the head was squeezed its left eye would bulge out in a ball of bright yellow iridescent liquid. this figure shares a sound chip with the other mummy figures that would appear in the Blister Beast line as well as the 2010 and 2016 UK editions. It also appeared as the sound chip for the mini- dungeons from the mini Stretch Screamers line. * \\"Wolfman\\" Featured a wolf- like face with yellow cat-like eyes. It stood bipedal like the rest of the figures. It had yellow skin and a removable red open shirt. Its hard plastic lower half featured torn denim shorts and highly detailed sculpted in fur. The wolfman stretch screamer also featured a unique sound chip which none of the other figures would share. When the head was squeezed the \\"balloon effect\\" would protrude from the figures' right cheek. * \\"Ghoul\\" Heavily resembled Ghostface from the film Scream. The figure was covered in black bandages and a removable black cloak. When the head was squeezed a ball of red iridescent liquid would bulge out of the figure's mouth. This figure shares a sound chip with the Gross Gargoyle as well as the other ghoul figures that would appear in the Blister Beast line as well as the 2010 and 2016 UK editions. * \\"Frankenstein\\" Featured in the first TV ad alongside with the Mummy. The original Frankenstein figure strayed away from the traditional flat-top head Frankenstein design. The figure had long black sculpted in hair, pale green skin, yellow eyes and brown bolts in the temples. It featured a brown vest that tied together from the front. When the head was squeezed its brain would emerge in a pink ball of iridescent fluid. Its sound chip was the most reused. It is shared by Scary Cyclops, Rage and Lava from the Blister Beast line as well as the 2010 and 2016 UK editions. * \\"Scary Cyclops\\" Featured a Ray Harryhausen-esque design with singular eye, light blue skin, gold teeth and earring. It also had a slouched stature to emphasize its balloon effect. It had a removable brown shirt that tied together. The figure along with the rest of the characters in series 2 featured detailed squishy hands as opposed to series 1's hard plastic hands.

It shared a sound chip with the Frankenstein figure as well as the other ones featured under Frankensteins' description. * \\"Gross Gargoyle\\" Resembled less of a stone Gargoyle and more of a jaundiced skinned Demon or Goblin. It stood crouched with a hunched back to emphasize its balloon feature. Its face had a large nose and ears, a singular white horn jutting from its head, a wide-open mouth filled with sharp bright yellow teeth. Its eyes had yellow whites and red irises. It wore tattered red shorts and a removable dark green cloak that when removed reveals the figures' scoliosis inflicted spine. Its arms were particularly long and its wrists wore silver shackles with remnants of chains still attached. It is similar in gait to the Scary Cyclops except the hands only have 4 fingers on each hand instead of 5. When the body was squeezed a yellow mass filled with gel and rubber bones would emerge from the figures' back hump. It shares a sound chip with the Ghoul. * \\"Angry Alien\\" was a truly unique design. It was an alien with a light blue head with green compound eyes. It did not have a removable costume as its body was a purple and yellow space suit complete with hard plastic helmet over the head which would contain the balloon effect. The space suit had oxygen tanks on the back of the figure and tubes that would lead up to the helmet. It had squishy grey tri-fingered hands and hard almost claw-like bisected feet. The figure also had a detachable ray gun that would attach to a hole on its right thigh. When the body was squeezed it would cause the aliens' red brain to bulge up against the helmet. It had a unique sound chip that sounded shrill and other worldly that would not be shared by any of the other figures. * \\"Creepy Creature\\" was an aquatic fish-like monster baring some resemblance to the Gill Man. Like the Angry Alien, the figure did not have any removable clothing as its skin was green and scaly; complete with fins, webbed hands, bright green eyes, very large gills and an open mouth filled with several rows of short white teeth. When the body was squeezed, the balloon effect would emerge from the figure's chest in the form of a green mass with rubber organs. It had a unique sound chip that sounded of gurgling and belching. The McDonald's happy meal toy line also had creature figure that was very similar in design. * \\"Blister Beast\\" were a line of the Stretch Screamers series that featured 4 new characters that each had multiple balloon effects, 2 of which had larger heads where the balloon effects would come out while the other two had smaller heads and larger bodies to accommodate the balloon effects. *Mummy *Ghoul *Rage *Lava *Oozers *Drooler *Gunk *Slobber *Sludge *Splat Bugz *Fright Termite *Gross Roach *Splat Ant *Squishy Scorpion *Splatter Fly *Mushy Dragonfly *Mighty Mantis *Tarantula *Mini Stretch Screamers were a line of hard plastic Stretch Screamers figures that were held together by elastic cords.

Young Irelands won the County senior hurling championship, defeating Newcastlewest. They defeated Newcastlewest again in 1932 to capture their last county title. During the 1930s Young Irelands fielded Senior hurling teams in both Cork and Limerick on the same Sunday . In Cork they played St Finbarrs and at Limericks Gaelic Grounds they lined out another 15 against Cappamore. On another occasion, they traveled by train to Killarney, toured the Lakes, played a senior hurling match against Corks Glen Rovers and a Senior Football match against the local Dr. Crokes. In 1921, Killaloe born Bob Mc Conkey lifted the Liam McCarthy while in 1923 Paddy McInerney, who was born in O‚ÄôCallaghan's Mills but who moved to Limerick at a young age, captained the side. In 1932, Caherconlish born Mickey Fitzgibbon captained the Limerick side. Mick Kennedy originally from The Ragg in Tipperary captained the side that won Limericks First National hurling league title in 1933-34. Mick Murphy, Willie Gleeson, Paddy McInerney, Denny Lanigan, Bob McConkey, Mick Kennedy all won All Ireland Senior hurling medals with Limerick. In 1936, Young Irelands reorganized. In 1938 and 1939, the underage teams in hurling and football were successful Croom/Young Irelands In 1949. Young Irelands joined with the Croom club. The club officers wereChairman- L. Jones, Vice Chairman- Bob McConkey, Joint Treasurers- J.Cregan, Jack Cusack, Joint Secretaries- S.English, and Seamus O‚ÄôCeallaigh, Captain of Senior Hurling team-P. Cregan. Vice Captain- Jim Sadlier. The combined hurling team defeated Ahane in the first round of the championship. During the game, Joe Cregan assaulted and seriously injured an Ahane player, Mick Herbert. Cregan was arrested, convicted and sent to prison. Croom /Young Irelands were defeated by St Patricks later on in the championship At the end of the season the combined club was dissolved. Lanigan Memorial Park In 1953, Young Irelands moved to a field in Westfields off North Circular Road. The use of the field was given to them by the Lanigan brothers, Denny and Jack who were builders. Denny who was born in Granagh had played for Young Irelands and Limerick and was part of the famous half back line for the Limerick All Ireland winning team of 1917 that was called the Hindenburg Line. Denny, Jack Keane and Willie Hough formed this half back line. The club had hoped to set up a permanent base in Westfields with a pavilion and call it after their former great player Denny Lanigan. They set up the Lanigan Memorial Park Committee. They put more emphasis on their underage structure as they knew that they could not just rely on players transferring into Limerick. Young Irelands/Commercials Young Irelands and Commercials joined in the 1950s as sister clubs with Young Irelands running the hurling and Commercials the football. They fielded underage and adult teams and did relatively well throughout the sixties and early seventies. The club entered a credit scheme for the field in Westfields in 1970, but this new field never materialized and in the 1975 season they were renting a field in Blackwater, which was previously held by Parteen. Demise In 1981, Young Irelands failed to field any hurling team. The most players they could muster was 12. The club secretary Maurice Egan said in his report that the most promising development was the relationship between Young Irelands and the new club on the Southside of the city, which was formed in 1979 called Ballinacurra Gaels. Young Irelands and Commercials used Ballinacurra Gaels field, and they assisted them with work on their field. Seamus O' Ceallaigh had been a very prominent Young Irelands clubman throughout the years and he was instrumental in setting up Ballinacurra Gaels. Not long after this, Young Irelands hurling club ceased to be. Its sister club, Commercials soldiered on for another decade and disbanded in 1991. Young Irelands was never really a parish based club team in the classic sense, and this was to prove their ultimate downfall. While they had underage teams for most of their history and focused on developing this side of the club from the fifties on, they, like Commercials, were the club that any outsider who came to the city played for. The other clubs in the city had developed stronger roots and the locals could identify with them better. Things might have ended up differently if their field in Westfields was bought and developed for the use of Gaelic Games. This never materialized and the blue and gold of Young Irelands ended up fading out of existence.

Life  Anna Olsson was the first daughter and oldest surviving child of Olof and Anna Lisa Olsson. In 1869, a three-year-old Olsson and her parents emigrated from V√§rmland, Sweden. They settled in Lindsborg, Kansas, where Olof Olsson served as pastor. She would later use many experiences from her childhood on the prairie in her publications. Olsson's father accepted a professorship at Augustana College and Theological Seminary in 1877, and the family moved to Rock Island, Illinois. Olsson returned to Lindsborg in order to attend Bethany Academy in 1882 and 1883. In the fall of 1883, Olsson reunited with her family in Rock Island and enrolled at Augustana College. She studied German language and literature, and was interested in philosophy. She earned her B.A. in 1888, and was only the second women to graduate from the college. Olof Olsson and his children traveled abroad in Europe from 1889 to 1890. They spent time in Germany, Switzerland, and Italy. During this trip, Olsson continued her education in a German school and attended literature and philosophy lectures at the University of Zurich. From 1896 to 1898, she studied Italian, French, and literature at Augustana College. In March 1887, a year before Olsson graduated from Augustana College, her mother, Anna Lisa, died. Because of this loss, Olsson had to take on many of her mother's duties as a pastor's wife. She also looked after her younger siblings and maintained the household. It was only after her siblings were older and her father had died that she was able to focus on her career as a writer.  Career  Anna Olsson split her career between teaching and writing. She returned to Lindsborg, Kansas in 1888 to teach in the Children's Department at Bethany Academy. She left that position to travel Europe with her family. In 1895, Olsson accepted a position as the principal of Ladies' Hall at Augustana College. She served as principal until 1900, when she became an instructor of English at the college. Her first work, a story printed anonymously in Ungdomsv√§nnen, was published in 1901 while she was still teaching. Olsson left her position at Augustana College in 1902. Olsson wrote both fiction and non-fiction in Swedish and English, and often used a Swedish-American dialect in her texts. Her publications, written using the pen name Aina, were mostly aimed at children. According to a report prepared in order to designate her home as a historic landmark, Olsson was \\"as well known as Mark Twain and Harriet Beecher Stowe for her children's books,\\" although literary scholar Ann Boaden places her fame at a more moderate level. En pr√§rieunges funderingar, the book she is best known for, is a semi- autobiographical work about her family's immigration to the United States and their years living on the Kansas prairie. Olsson was also a popular contributor to Swedish and Lutheran periodicals, publishing her work in Ungdomsv√§nnen, Fosterlandel, Prairieblomman, Julrunan, and Julgranan, among others. Olsson continued to write until her death at the age of 79 on February 15, 1946. She and her siblings never married or had children. The home they lived in after their father's death was designated as a Rock Island landmark in 1996.  Works  *Fr√•n Solsidan. Rock Island, Illinois: Lutheran Augustana Book Concern, 1903.

It first aired on CBS in the United States on September 28, 2009. It is the 42nd episode overall. The episode features a guest appearance by American comedian Lewis Black. Plot Sheldon, Raj and Howard are at the comic book store and are surprised to see Leonard arrive, expecting him to be having sex with Penny. After Howard and Raj question Leonard, he characterizes their sex as \\"just fine\\" and \\"not bad, but not great\\". Later, Howard and Raj mock him about it which causes Sheldon to explain to Penny what Leonard said. She leaves in embarrassment, with Leonard following her. He tries to justify his actions, and asks her how she found the sex. When she characterizes it as \\"okay\\", they decide that discussing the problem will not make it better and decide to get very drunk before having sex. Unfortunately, they both end up constantly vomiting. Meanwhile, Howard and Sheldon get involved in an argument about the species of a cricket they can hear from the apartment. Sheldon insists it is a snowy tree cricket while Howard maintains that it is a common field cricket. They decide to make a bet, Sheldon staking his \\"Flash of Two Worlds\\" against Howard's Fantastic Four #48. After thoroughly searching the apartment, Sheldon climbs down the elevator shaft in the hallway and his flashlight's battery runs out. Howard and Raj hear the cricket and check the stairwell, leaving Sheldon in a darkened elevator shaft. They find the cricket and argue over a name, with Raj and Howard calling it \\"Toby\\" and Sheldon wanting to call it \\"Jiminy\\". They fail to identify the species, even with an insect guide. They settle the bet by taking the cricket to Professor Crawley (Lewis Black), Caltech's depressed entomologist, who has just lost funding for his lab. Howard is proven correct as it is a common field cricket, much to Sheldon's disappointment. Soon after, Sheldon talks to Penny and he tells her that she and Leonard can always go back to being friends. When he mentions to Leonard that he spoke to Penny about their sex life, he goes over to talk to her. They decide to just be friends, however it is clear that neither really wants that and they quickly start kissing.

Barry played Gaelic games with a number of clubs, beginning as a Gaelic footballer with Fermoy, with whom he featured in two county senior championship finals. His return to Limerick saw Barry switch codes to hurling and joined the Boher team, while he also lined out with the Young Irelands and Fedamore clubs. In 1916 Barry was selected for the Limerick junior football team, however, injury prevented him from lining out. He made his senior hurling debut during the 1917 championship.

Life Wense was born in Ortelsburg, then in East Prussia but today Szczytno in Poland, to a family of military and aristocratic background. In 1914 he began to study philosophy in Berlin. A keen musician, he played some of his own compositions to Arnold Schoenberg in 1915. From 1915 to 1918 he served in the German army.Anon1 (n.d.). He began publishing his poetry in 1917. He took part in the Spartacist uprising of 1919 in Munich. In the following years he pursued his music studies with Clara Zetkin, Hermann Scherchen and Ernst Krenek. Hans Heinz Stuckenschmidt ranked Wense in 1921 with Erik Satie, Igor Stravinsky and B√©la Bart√≥k.Lissek (n.d.), p.2 Some of Wense's early music showed traits of Dadaism, for example his 1919 opus \\"Music for piano, clarinet and suspended metal colander.\\"Davies (n.d.), section 2. A wealthy older artist, Hedwig Woermann (1889‚Äì1960), began at this period to support him financially; this support continued until 1945 and allowed him to follow his various pursuits.Anon1 (n.d.). Although Wense was gay, his friendship with Woermann was one of the deepest in his life.Gebhard and Nickel (2012), p. 53 In 1932 Wense first visited the region of Hesse-Kassel which was to become dear to him. He planned to write a book about hiking in the area between the towns of G√∂ttingen, Paderborn and Eschwege. In 1940 he settled in G√∂ttingen; throughout the Second World War he worked as a factory labourer. In the period 1946‚Äì1949 some of his aphorisms were published in a G√∂ttingen journal, but following this he published nothing for the remainder of his life.Anon1 (n.d.) At his death he left over 300 folders with about 30,000 pages of letters, photographs, reflections and translations, of which 13 contained musical compositions, including transcriptions of music by Gustav Mahler and Dietrich Buxtehude.Gebhard and Nickel (2012), p. 83 Wense was also involved in creating a detailed alphabetical index of esoteric extracts from world literature (edited posthumously as Von Aas bis Zylinder).

The name was reused in 2016 by Merim Brkiƒá who started the new Nanjing F.C. and adopted the same values as the original club. It has been frequently referred as Nanjing Football Club after the pinyin language reform, when Nanjing was gradually adopted as the standard spelling of the city's name in most languages that use the Roman alphabet. History The club was founded in early 1930 by David Crow, a silk trader from Manchester, England, employed by Jardine, Matheson & Co. LtdEWO Brewery Ltd.#cite note-TANDJ-1 one of the largest trading companies in the Far East at that time. As an attempt to integrate foreigners and Chinese nationals during the period known as the Nanking decade, Nanjing Football Club was the first sports team in China to include both Chinese nationals and foreigners playing side by side as equals. Its first batch of athletes included nationals from France, Italy, Korea, Peru, Portugal and the United Kingdom, as wells as citizens from Nanjing, Beijing, Chungking (Chongqing), Hangzhou, Shanghai and Suzhou. According to veteran sports journalist and writer Liu Zhongxian,Author#cite note-1 born in Nanjing, the team was \\"wildly popular due to the several nationalities of its players\\" but would only punctuate \\"as average quality\\". Three of its most renowned footballers ‚Äì Wang Xiaochuan, Li Huitang and Ping Li ‚Äì had also been defending the colors of the China National Team, founded in 1924, when the country joined F√©d√©ration Internationale de Football Association (FIFA) in 1932. Nanjing Football Club didn't own its headquarters, but its meeting point and training field was located in the vicinity of the Nanjing Botanical Garden, Memorial Sun Yat-Sen (Chinese: Âçó‰∫¨‰∏≠Â±±Ê§çÁâ©Âõ≠; pinyin: N√°njƒ´ng Zh≈çngshƒÅn Zh√≠w√πy√∫an), the first botanical garden in China. The club would disband shortly after the beginning of the Second Sino-Japanese War when Japan invaded China. The Japanese troops occupied Nanjing in December 1937 and carried out the brutal Nanking massacre, that left very little documentation of the club's history. =Crest and kit= A lone white star was adopted as the club's badge. Since its first match on June 6, 1930, the club colours were black and white stripes, inspired by traditional English team Notts County, the oldest football team in the world to currently play at a professional level.[3] The club did not have one specific colour for shorts, that could be either black or white. New Era In October 2016 the name Nanjing F.C name was brought back to life following the original traditions of bringing together foreigners from more than 20 countries and Chinese as equals. In the first season they managed win the 2017 scarlet cup, the 2017 BSN cup and come runners up in the Nanjing city league (8 a-side). =Mission Statement= The Nanjing Football Club is dedicated to providing a positive and safe environment for aspiring footballers to develop. We believe promoting football advocacy yields benefits in health and outlook for a lifetime. References * ^ Jump up to: a b c d Keswick, Maggie; Weatherall, Clara (2008).

Origins He was born 12 December 1616 the son of Martin Lluelyn of London. His Welsh origin is not certain, but is suggested by his surname and by the fact that his son George Lluelyn was described as \\"a Jacobitical, musical, mad Welsh parson\\" by the musical historian Dr Charles Burney (1726‚Äì1814).Burney, History of Music , 1789 , vol.3, p.495 note Education He attended Westminster School and Christ Church, Oxford, where he received the degrees of BA in 1640 and MA in 1643. Career during Civil War At the outbreak of the Civil War he sided with the Royalists and rose to the rank of captain. He was in Oxford in 1648 when the Roundheads captured that city and fled to London, where he practiced as a physician, later in 1653 gaining from Oxford University the degree of MD and in 1659 was elected a fellow of the College of Physicians. Restoration Following the Restoration of the Monarchy in 1660 he composed poetry in honour of King Charles II (1660‚Äì1685), by whom he was appointed his personal Physician Extraordinary. In 1660 he was appointed principal of St. Mary Hall, Oxford. In 1664 he moved his residence to High Wycombe in Buckinghamshire and resumed his practice as a physician, and entered local civic life as mayor and a JP. Literary career As a student at Christ Church, Oxford he wrote various plays including one staged in 1661 during a visit to the university by King Charles II.When Charles II visited Oxford in July 1661 a play was made by ‚ÄòDr. Llewellyn‚Äô (Cal. State Papers, Dom. 1661) However all his surviving published works are of poetry. =List of works= *Men Miracles, with other Poems (\\"By M. Ll. St. of Christ Church in Oxon\\") (1646), reprinted in 1656, in 1661 and in 1679, as \\"Lluellin's Marrow of the Muses\\". The title-poem, which is a satire in Hudibrastic vein and metre upon the traveller's tales of Mandeville and others, but especially of Tom Coryate, is followed by smaller pieces, of which as an example a spirited and humorous fishing-song is given in Brydges's Censura, vol. x, page 131. Several of them were sufficiently popular to be thought worthy of insertion in the subsequent additions to Wit's Recreations (1640) (see Mennis, Faceti√¶ [1874], ii. 378).Seccombe *Ode to Celia, which appeared in the collections of Ellis and Neale.

Lluelyn was also, like his friend Edward Gray, a contributor to Musarum Oxoniensium Charisteria (1638, quarto (Brydges, Restituta, i. 146)). There is a copy of verses by him prefixed to Cartwright's Plays and Poems (1651), and he seems to have taken a leading part in the presentation of plays at Christ Church, as in the minor poems appended to his ‚ÄòMen Miracles‚Äô (p. 80) is one addressed \\"to Dr. F[ell], Deane of Ch. Ch. ... when I presented him a Play\\". Another poem, probably written about 1640 and published with Men Miracles is addressed to \\"Lord B. on presenting him with a play\\". He also wrote a verse in honour of the Royalist commander Sir Bevil Grenville (died 1643) slain at the Battle of Lansdown, as displayed inscribed on his mural monument erected in 1714 in Kilkhampton Church, Cornwall.His authorship is inscribed at the bottom of the verse as \\"Martin L.

She was influenced by the Bauhaus movement and L√°szl√≥ Moholy-Nagy. After school, she turned to photography to encompass her interdisciplinary work, beginning in 1973 with the commercial process of diazotype and subjects reminiscent of performance art. Working for over 40 years, she is often inspired by the act of depicting a three-dimensional space onto a two-dimensional plane. She often uses mirrors, lights, and props for conceptually-based pieces. As she continues her practice, her work has continued to pure abstraction. Kasten has exhibited and lectured worldwide. She has had many commissions and residencies, including a Capp Street Residency. She has taught and influenced many photographers and artists and holds the position of Distinguished College Artist at Columbia College Chicago. She has won many awards, notably the John Simon Guggenheim Fellowship.Guggenheim Fellowship In 2015, Kasten was given the first career survey of her work, entitled \\"Barbara Kasten: Stages\\" at the Institute of Contemporary Art, Philadelphia.

Life and works Meyer was born in Gro√ü Strehlitz in the Prussian Province of Silesia (present-day Strzelce Opolskie in modern Poland). In 1867 he enrolled in the Breslau University (now University of Wroc≈Çaw) to study classical philology, Indo- European languages, Modern Greek, and Sanskrit. He was there influenced by philologists Martin Hertz and Adolf Friedrich Stenzler. In 1871 he defended his dissertation De nominibus graecis copositus. In the same year he was named assistant professor at the University of G√∂ttingen, and a year later professor of ancient languages in the same university. He went on to work as a gymnasium teacher in Gotha, from 1874 in Mal√° Strana, Prague at the intercession of Wilhelm von Hartel, and was appointed outside lecturer (Privatdozent) at the Charles University in 1876. The next year he was named professor of Sanskrit and comparative linguistics at the University of Graz, where he pursued studies of Ancient Greek, Turkish, and Albanian. During this period he published his study Contribution on the theory of word-formation in Greek and Latin (1872). Full professor at the University of Graz from 1881, Meyer started to focus his studies on albanology, and prepared the foundations of the discipling by publishing the following works: # Albanesische Studien, I, (1882); # Etymologisches W√∂rterbuch der albanesischen Sprache, Strassburg, (1891); # Kurzgefasste albanesische Grammatik, Leipzig, (1888); # Zum indogermanischen - Perfectum auf die albanesische Formenlehre, published in the Miscellanea di filologia e linguistica in memoriam by Napoleone Caix e Angelo Canello, Firenze, (1886); # Die lateinischen Elemente im Albanesischen, published by Gr√∂bers Grundriss, I, I. Auflage (1888) etj. Meyer is considered to be the linguist that scientifically proved that the Albanian language belongs to the Indo-European family. He is known to have held a long correspondence with Jeronim de Rada, an Albanian leading figure of the Albanian National Awakening. Gustav Meyer died on August 27, 1900 in Stra√ügang near Graz. In honour of his contributions to Albanology a grammar school in Tirana, Albania bears his name.

Schach is particularly associated with British cinema, where he was a leading figure in the boom of the mid-1930s. Life and career Schach was born as Max Schacherl to a Jewish family in ƒåenta, then part of the Austro-Hungarian Empire. He worked in Germany for many years as a journalist, and was particularly noted as a theatre and later film critic. He became involved in the German film industry during the silent era, working in a variety of roles at UFA, Emelka and Universal Pictures' German subsidiary. He personally produced several films, including some directed by Karl Grune. Schach emigrated to Britain in 1934 following the Nazi takeover in Berlin. In the wake of the international success of Alexander Korda's The Private Life of Henry VIII (1933) Schach secured financial backing from the City of London who wanted to invest in the growing British film industry. He oversaw a series of independent film companies which made large-budget productions aimed at international markets. Many of his films employed fellow European exiles from the Nazis, including Fritz Kortner and Richard Tauber and Karl Grune. Because of his lavish budgets Schach was able to attract figures away from more established film companies.Low p.138 While some of the films such as Abdul the Damned (1934) made money, a lot struggled to recover their large budgets. By 1937 a slump hit the British industry which saw several companies go out of business. While Alexander Korda was widely blamed for his extravagance at Denham Studios, historian Rachael Low believes that Schach and his associates were more responsible.Low p.208 The series of production companies that Schach oversaw ceased making films, generally after only one or two releases. The failure of Schach's film empire led to a lengthy legal case, and he never made another film. He continued to live in Britain, and died in London in 1957.

Bletchley Park Du Boisson joined the Women's Royal Naval Service (known as WRNS) during WWII and was stationed at the Newmanry sector of Bletchley Park, England. With others she operated code-breaking machines, such as the Tunny machine Heath Robinson. She was one of only four operators working with the Tunny but, to work efficiently, she had to learn how to operate the Heath Robinson as well. After the Colossus computer was developed, she operated it under the direction of a cryptographer. When more Wrens were posted, Du Boisson came off the machines and went into the Ops Rooms as a registrar. She was responsible for logging the tapes in and out and distributing them to the machines. Since she was one of only two people working in the Ops room, Du Boisson had a tremendous amount of work to do. She recorded the date and identity of each tape used on the Colossus and Tunny. She knew exactly where each tape was and the machine time spent on it. Moreover, she was also responsible for unwinding tapes into buckets and joining them into a loop. This was an essential step for operation, since the tape might not stand up to the speed of the machine. After many experiments, Du Boisson found a unique way to strengthen it by using a special glue, a warm clamp, and French chalk. After the war, the machines were smashed into fragments on the orders of Churchill. Later, Du Boisson worked as a typist in the Air Ministry. Career To perform the data analysis well, \\"Du Boisson and other operators in Wrens needed to first get the data from a partially electronic machine named Heath Robinson. If it could perform its analysis successfully, the resulting data would be run through the Tunny machine.\\" Most of the workers were between 20 and 22 years of age. They attended training sessions to get more familiar with the machines, how they operate and the maintenance procedures. The working shifts could last up to 70 hours per week because many machines kept running all the time and there were few people who knew how to operate them. It was necessary for those people to work three eight-hour shifts every day for several weeks. Moreover, due to this stressful workload, many errors in the operations started to appear. Due to limitations in the machines, when a mistake was found, in many cases, it was necessary to redo the work all over again. Living and working conditions Workers had to perform a series of strict jobs within a tight schedule. Due to restrictions on outside policies, workers had to spend most the time locked in rooms without proper ventilation and luminosity. Moreover, many employees even lived there, usually in attics that were not actually prepared. \\"The attic was cold and very damp,\\" and they had to \\"put newspapers in the bed to keep warm.\\" The poor conditions of the buildings and the machinery with lots of electrical cables also were not a good combination, since it was common to have fires. Also, the food was not good and the water that was sometimes contaminated. \\"We suffered from exhaust and malnutrition\\". Results Employees at Bletchley Park did not know what they were doing and how their work was going to be used. They were expected to simply follow orders given by their superiors and were prohibited from asking questions or making comments about their work. Like other members of Wrens, Du Boisson knew little of Bletchley's successes on the codebreaking. They got some information about what they had been doing once a month. They were also responsible for collecting information for the war. \\"Every German officer had a card and each time his name appeared in the message, all the details were noted. Once, we were told, a senior German officer has sent a coded message asking for the luggage of his mistress to be forwarded. Our people were delighted to read it since his regiment had not been heard of for several months.\\" Contribution The engineer who designed and constructed the prototype Colossus, Thomas Flowers, said \\"Bletchley Park changed the course of history and the praise that the cryptanalysts have received is well merited, but nothing has ever been said about the many people who worked like slaves for over a year to create Colossus and get it into service by D-day\\". Indeed, without the hard work of Du Boisson and other Wren girls, Colossus would not have been able to function well. The fact that the first fully satisfactory Colossus was put into service before D-day was no coincidence. They worked flat out for four months and met the deadline. The decoding at Bletchley Park did ensure that the Germans could not get there at the time that the American troops were landing. Eisenhower stated that without the information Bletchley had applied, the war would have gone on for at least two years longer than it did. Death Du Boisson suffered an infection and died in hospital on 1 February 2013.

The group formed in 1990 and consisted of Niall Vallely on concertina, Vince Milne on fiddle, Frank Torpey on bodhran, Gerry McKee on bouzouki, and Eoin Coughlan on vocals and bass. They have been described as one of the \\"most popular Irish bands of the 1990s,\\" and as \\"one of the more innovative and fiery Irish traditional bands\\". Origins of the band Originally the group included Liz Doherty on fiddle and John Spillane on vocals and guitar. Doherty and Spillane formed Nomos with Vallely, Torpey, and McKee at University College Cork. The band followed a musical path begun by artists such as The Chieftains, Clannad, Planxty, Altan, Natalie McMaster, and Eileen Ivers. The Sound The group's fiery sound centered on Vallely's innovative and dynamic concertina playing and Milne's flashy fiddling. Milne's contributions displayed both his West Cork heritage and his affinity for bluegrass. Vallely, of Armagh, also composed and played the low whistle. The rhythm contributions of Coughlan have been compared to Planxty and the Bothy Band, and the bassist/vocalist also writes some of the group's songs. Torpey hails from Wexford, while McKee was born in Lisburn.

He was murdered by the Maoists near a market in Basaguda, Bijapur district, Chhattisgarh. Both the Maoists and police were suspicious of Reddy's allegiance to the other side. Maoists believed he was assisting police to dislodge the Communist Party of India. The police arrested him for having close ties with the communists. Some journalists believed that Reddy was killed by other farmers. He was known for playing an active role in the people's movement in Basaguda over the last few decades.  Personal  Sai Reddy was born in 1962 and was from in Basuguda, an area hit hard by the insurgent Naxalites. Reddy was held by security in 1998 under the Essential Commodities Act and again in 2008 for suspected relationships with the Maoists. Many rural journalists supplement their incomes by selling agricultural products while also working as journalists, and Reddy also used this method to supplement his salary. His wife had a shop. He was living in Bijapur at the time he returned home.  Career  Sai Reddy was a rural journalist. He reported on rural topics, as well as on corruption cases. He had at least 20 years of experience and covered the conflict with the Maoists for that long. He was known by peers and employer as independent and critical of all sides and careful to check on facts and figures while reporting. Reddy's writings on the Naxal violence in the region gained him unwanted attention, and he was known to have angered the security forces, the anti- Maoist group Salwa Judum, and the Maoists. Tribal families in the Chhattisgarh area were subjected to violence during the insurgent conflict with the Indian authorities. Reddy was held by security in 1998 under the Essential Commodities Act and again in 2008 for suspected relationships with the Maoists. Around 2008, Reddy fled Chhattisgarh after his house was destroyed by fire and the police had arrested him, and returned later after apologising to the Moaists.  Death  Sai Reddy was murdered by 4 or more men after leaving the market in Basguda on 6 December 2013. The cause of death was from head and neck injuries that were caused by the stabbing and beating incident. The attack occurred during the afternoon in front of witnesses. Reddy had been receiving threats from the Maoists for some time. The Maoists officially took responsibility more than a month after the Reddy's murder. The Maoists used sharp-edged weapons on Reddy when they attacked him, and he died en route to the hospital. His troubles with the Maoists went back as far as 2008 when they torched his house.  Context  By the time Maoists killed Sai Reddy, over 1500 civilians in the area had been killed by the armed political group.  Impact  Sai Reddy was one of at least eight Indian journalists who were killed during 2013. The level of violence against journalists in 2013 in India surpassed the previous high level of violence reached in 1997 when seven were killed. Nemi Chand Jain was also killed in Chhattisgarh in February 2013. According to news reports, Jain was killed by the Maoists and the group had confirmed it, which makes Reddy the second journalist killed by the Maoist in 2013. He was one of 70 journalists killed worldwide in 2013.  Reaction  Within 45 days of Reddy's murder, the Maoists not only took responsibility for his murder but said they were mistaken about his working for the police. After his killing outside the market in front of eyewitnesses, police suspected Maoists and that was confirmed by a press release released after the attack. Journalists in Basaguda marched through the lands of the Maoists over a three- day period to protest his death and out of concern for their own safety.

He is notable for four principal things: his strong opposition to the philosophes and the publication of the Encyclopedie in 1759; his role in the expulsion of the Jesuits; his involvement in the Lally Tollendal Affair; and his ban on inoculation against smallpox in June 1763. In a pun on his name, Voltaire described him as ‚Äòni Hom√®re, ni joli, ni fleuri' ( = neither Homer, nor pretty, nor flowery, a sarcastic comment on his apparently dreary oratory). In one of his private letters, Voltaire described him as a ‚Äòlittle black balloon puffed up with stinking vapours‚Äô Guiragossian Diana, Voltaire‚Äôs Faceties,Librairie Droz, Geneva, 1963 p.56 Family He was the son of , of the Parlement of Paris and of Marie Francoise Le Maistre. His brothers were Guillaume-Fran√ßois-Louis Joly de Fleury (1710-1787) who succeeded their father in his post as Procurator General, and Jean-Fran√ßois Joly de Fleury (1718-1802), intendant of Dijon and Administrator General of Finances.

His opening statement was ‚ÄòSociety, the State and Religion present themselves today at the tribunal of justice‚Ä¶ their rights have been violated, their laws disregarded. Impiety walks with head held high‚Ä¶. Humanity shudders, the citizenry is alarmed.‚ÄôAllen, Garland E & MacLeod Roy M (eds), Science, History and Social Activism Kluwer Academic Publishers, Dordrecht 2001 p.49 These evils he blamed on ‚Äòa sect of so-called Philosophers (the Philosophes)‚Ä¶ who imagined a project‚Ä¶ to destroy the basic truths engraved in our hearts by the hand of the Creator, to abolish his cult and his ministers, and to establish instead Materialism and Deism.‚Äô As a result of his speech the Parlement banned the publishers of the Encyclopedie from selling any more copies, and established a commission of enquiry to look in detail at the content of the seven published volumes. In March 1759 Parlement revoked the Encyclopedie's permission to publish altogether.Allen, Garland E & MacLeod Roy M (eds), Science, History and Social Activism Kluwer Academic Publishers, Dordrecht 2001 p.53 After this ban, work on the remaining volumes of the Encyclopedie had to continue underground. De L‚ÄôEsprit and seven other publications were ordered to be lacerated and burned in front of the Palais de Justice on 10 February.Israel, Jonathan, Democratic Enlightenment: Philosophy, Revolution, and Human Rights 1750-1790 Oxford University Press 2011 p.79 In 1765 Joly de Fleury further demanded, and secured, a condemnation by Parlement of Voltaire's Dictionnaire Philosophique.Davidson,Ian, Voltaire, A Life, Profile Books, London 2010 p.359 Opposition to the Jesuits The Parlement of Paris and the Jesuit Order were often at odds in eighteenth-century France. In 1759 the Jesuits were expelled from Portugal Lacouture, Jean, Jesuits, The Harvill Press, London 1995 p.270 and tensions in France escalated around a complex fraud which involved a number of court cases in the 1750s and early 1760s.Lacouture, Jean, Jesuits, The Harvill Press, London 1995 p.275 On 6 August 1762, on the initiative of Joly de Fleury, the Parlement of Paris issued a decree depriving the Jesuits of all of their property. It required them to cease to live in their communities and to disperse. It forbade them to correspond with each other or to exercise any function.Daurignac JMS, History of the Society of Jesus from its Foundation to the Present Time J.Murphy, Baltimore 1878 p.46 Later Joly de Fleury regretted the part he had played in the suppression of the order, whose equal, he then said, could not be found in science and learning.Daurignac JMS, History of the Society of Jesus from its Foundation to the Present Time J.Murphy, Baltimore 1878 p.46 Opposition to inoculation The practice of inoculation against smallpox was introduced to Paris by an Italian doctor named Gatti and by 1763 he had inoculated ninety- seven people. However, there was public consternation when some of those he had inoculated did not remain in quarantine as prescribed, and went freely around the city, potentially risking the health of others. It was said that this was the origin of the epidemic that struck Paris in late 1762 and early 1763. Joly de Fleury responded to this emergency by asking the Paris Parlement to vote to refer the question of inoculation to the Faculties of Medicine and Theology at the Sorbonne. In June 1763 the Parlement ordered that no further inoculations take place in Paris until the Faculties had rendered their judgement on the matter. Inoculations were allowed to continue outside the city, and those already inoculated were required to maintain quarantine for six weeks.Bazin, H, Vaccination: A History from Lady Montagu to Genetic Engineering Editions Lohn Libby Eurotext 2011 p.44 This apparently pragmatic approach quickly foundered as the physicians could not agree and published rival reports. This started a war of polemics between proponents and opponents of the practice, which effectively became a proxy for the continued struggle between the philosophes and the clerical conservatives. Joly de Fleury was the object of much mockery and abuse during these exchanges.Williams, HN, Later Queens of the French Stage, Harper & Brothers London 1906 In particular, Joly de Fleury's efforts made him the target of one of Voltaire's satirical pamphlets, or fac√©ties. Not only did Voltaire hate him for his opposition to the philosophes, but he was also in favour of inoculation.Voltaire‚Äôs Faceties Librairie Droz, Geneva, 1963 p.56 The Lally Tollendal Affair Joly de Fleury was also involved in one of the longest-running and most acrimonious legal disputes in late eighteenth century France, the Lally-Tollendal case. Lally Tollendal was a French commander in India. Defeated by the British, he was taken as a prisoner of war to England. He was falsely accused of treason, and returned to France to clear his name.Davidson,Ian, Voltaire, A Life, Profile Books, London 2010 p.359 Joly de Fleury brought formal charges against him, but when his trial began in 1764, Lally Tollendal had not received any documentation of the charges, and was not allowed a defence lawyer. Throughout the trial, which lasted for two years, Lally Tollendal fought against Joly de Fleury's charges but on 6 May 1766 he was convicted and sentenced to death. On learning of his execution Voltaire began to campaign for his posthumous rehabilitation, which was obtained from Louis XVI in 1778. The case was considered to be one of the great miscarriages of justice in ancien regime France.

Martin (born February 23, 1953) is the current mayor of Stamford, Connecticut. A Democrat, he was elected Mayor of Stamford in November 2013 in a four candidate race with approximately 48% of the vote. He was sworn in on December 1, 2013. He previously served as the President of the Stamford Board of Representatives (city council) and on the Stamford Board of Finance.  Early life, career and family Martin was born and raised just outside Kansas City, Missouri. His mother worked as a public school counselor. His father was a lawyer and, later, a trial judge. In high school, Martin was selected as president of his school's National Honor Society chapter. Martin later attended Massachusetts Institute of Technology, where he received two BA degrees in Biology and Economics. He later earned an MBA from Stanford University in 1979. Following graduation from MIT, Martin took a job working for the Congressional Budget Office in the national security division. After graduation from Stanford Business School, he took a job working for CONRAIL as a planning manager. He joined PepsiCo after moving to Stamford, CT. He moved to Stamford with his future wife Judy in 1981 and within a couple of years purchased a home in North Stamford, where they have lived ever since. In the mid-1980s, Martin took a job at Michael Allen Company, a private consulting firm headquartered in Darien, Connecticut. Martin, who worked there until his election as Mayor, was one of five partners at the company and focused on bringing new approaches and greater efficiency to major pharmaceutical companies such as Abbott Labs, Genetech, Merck and Bristol-Myers Squibb. Martin and his wife, Judy, in 2008 founded the nonprofit charity The Starfish Connection, whose mission is to support academically talented students from low income families reach their potential and their dreams of attending college. Students enroll in a ten-year mentoring program beginning in Grade 3. In 2016, 57 students were enrolled in the program. In 2017 the first students, who entered the Starfish program 10 years earlier as 3rd graders, were successfully admitted to college. Martin has two daughters, Rachel and Sarah, who are both graduates of Stamford Public Schools. His wife Judy left a career in corporate America to become a reading teacher at one of Stamford's elementary schools, where she worked since 2007 until the week of her death on November 10, 2016. Administration =Budget= Martin made tackling unfunded pension and retiree healthcare benefits a budgetary priority. He will be the first Mayor to fully fund required pension contributions and retiree medical benefits, and will do more to pay down previously unfunded obligations than any prior Mayor. He cites the issue as critical to the long-term success of the city and its financial health. Stamford currently has a AAA bond rating, the highest possible rating, and that rating could be put in jeopardy without addressing these issues, according to the Mayor. Increases in paying down these long-term obligations accounted for significant portions of the City budget increase. The city boards approved a $525 million budget for fiscal year 2015‚Äì2016, representing a 2.59% tax increase. The city boards approved a $507.9 million budget for fiscal year 2014‚Äì2015, representing a 2.87% tax increase over the prior year. In his four years in office the average tax increase has been 2.79%, somewhat lower than the prior administration which had a 2.86% average tax increase. =Street Safety & Accessibility= The Stamford Street Smart Initiative, launched in September 2014, is a citywide public safety and awareness campaign in the City of Stamford. The initiative is focused on the three key areas of enforcement, engineering and education. The initiative is being led by Martin, in collaboration with the Police Department, Operations Department, Stamford Public Schools, and community organizations. New crosswalk signs, road stanchions, and \\"no turn on red\\" backlit signs were installed throughout the City in November 2014. Stamford Police implemented anti-distracted driving patrols that netted over 400 tickets. Martin supported the passage of a Complete Streets Ordinance, which passed the Stamford Board of Representatives unanimously. Stamford is the third city in Connecticut to pass a Complete Streets Ordinance. Martin in his 2015-16 budget request included funding to re-organize City transportation functions under the leadership of a Bureau Chief for Transportation, Traffic and Parking. The Mayor also pledged funding to synchronize City traffic lights, something that hasn't been done in over a decade. In May 2015, Martin announced a Downtown Bike Parking Pilot Program at the launch of Bike to Work Week. =Police Department= In February 2015, Martin announced plans to construct a new police headquarters to replace the original 1955 building. The building had been in need of improvements for many years and asbestos-containing material was discovered in the facility in 2014. Public safety officials & community members praised the plan. Martin announced his support for body-worn cameras in May 2015, and pledged to apply for federal grant funding. =Public education= Martin serves as a non-voting member of the city's Board of Education. Martin is the first mayor to regularly attend Board of Education meetings and has been active in supporting public education in Stamford. Under Martin's leadership, in September 2014, the City purchased the property at 200 Strawberry Hill Avenue from the Sisters of St. Joseph for $9.75 million. The 10.8-acre property is the former site of Sacred Heart Academy, which closed in 2006, and most recently served as the Stamford Campus for The Stanwich School. At the time of the purchase, Martin and education officials announced their hope to use the property to address overcrowding in the district's elementary schools. =Transportation= Martin has frequently spoken about the importance of rail to the city and the critical need for the state and federal governments to provide investment in the Metro North line. He cites it as the single most important factor influencing the future success of the city and region. Election 2013 Martin was elected in November 2013 with 48% of the vote, defeating the Republican candidate, Former Lieutenant Governor Michael Fedele, and petitioning candidates Kathleen Murphy and John Zito. Before competing in the general election, Martin won in the Democratic primary against State Representative William Tong in September 2013 with 52% of the vote. The primary race was among the most closely contested in the State. Democratic Governor Dannel Malloy, a former Mayor of Stamford, endorsed Representative Tong in the Democratic primary race, drawing criticism from local Democratic Party and their Chairman, who endorsed Martin. Martin campaigned vigorously for the nomination and focused on his experience in City Hall and his commitment to the city. Martin was heavily outspent in both races and contributed nearly $100,000 to his campaign. Katrina Mygatt Recycling Center July 2020 Martin closed the Katrina Mygatt Recycling Center all but two days a week. Now only open on Tuesdays and Saturdays.

Burruss was later angered by false allegations spread about Tucker and notably delivered the line, \\"I will drag you in this, bitch!\\", as she was pulled away from the incident. Rodney Ho from The Atlanta Journal-Constitution acknowledged the situation as \\"one of the most violent fights in the six-year history of the program\\", while Bailey commented on Watch What Happens: Live: \\"I've been on this show for four years and never, ever in the history of the whole show has anyone laid hands on each other.\\" While filming the reunion special at the Atlanta Biltmore Hotel on March 27, Moore implied that Williams was unfaithful during her marriage; after Williams called Moore a \\"slut from the '90s\\" and Moore yelled that Williams was \\"a dumb ho\\" from a megaphone, Williams dragged Moore across the floor by her hair. Moore was initially unable to complete a police statement because she was required to complete the reunion filming, although Williams was arrested and booked for misdemeanor battery on April 18. Moore later threatened to quit the series if Williams were to remain, commenting: \\"we've become angry with each other, we've threatened each other and gone to the edge. But at the end of the day, we know there's a line.\\" Earlier in December 2013, Williams received additional criticism for comments made during the eighth episode, \\"Ghosts of Girlfriends Past\\", wherein she indicated that she believed the Underground Railroad was an actual railroad line.

Early in life, as a medical student, Zlatiƒá became a high-ranking member of the then-illegal Communist Party. In World War II, he became the first Partisan physician in Croatia and one of the founders of Petrova Gora hospital. He was expelled from the Communist Party in 1949 and subsequently served two years in Goli Otok prison for siding with Stalin's position in the Tito‚ÄìStalin Split. After his release from prison, Zlatiƒá focused on scientific work; he is considered one of the founders of clinical pharmacology in Croatia. Zlatiƒá also had a long competitive career as a chess composer and was awarded the title of World Federation for Chess Composition Honorary Master in 1999. Early life Zlatiƒá was born in 1912 in Lani≈°ƒáe, a village in Istria, Croatia, into a Catholic family. His parents were teachers. After the Italian occupation of Istria in 1918, the family lived as refugees in Trieste and Slovenia, finally settling in Zagreb in 1921. In 1932, as a medical student, Zlatiƒá joined the movement against the 6 January Dictatorship of King Alexander and took part in demonstrations against the regime. In 1933, with his former schoolmates, he founded an illegal communist group. After joining the Communist Party in 1934, Zlatiƒá advanced through the party ranks and became one of the leaders of the League of Communist Youth of Yugoslavia in 1935. For his illegal political activities, in April 1935 Zlatiƒá was arrested and tortured by the police. He was tried before the Court for the Protection of the State and sent to Sremska Mitrovica prison. After his release in 1938, he made contact with Josip Broz Tito, head of the Communist Party of Yugoslavia. In the following years, Zlatiƒá spent most of his time establishing Communist Party cells in Zagreb, in accordance with Tito's instructions. In December 1939 he was arrested again and imprisoned in Lepoglava. Shortly after his release in 1940, Zlatiƒá passed his final exams and received a medical degree. World War II In August 1941, after the establishment of the Axis-aligned Independent State of Croatia, by Party decision Zlatiƒá was sent to the Kordun region to help provide medical care to Partisan troops. The medical field work proved to be very risky, as it involved hours of traveling on foot to reach the wounded, crossing guarded roads and railway tracks in the process. This led to a decision to build an improvised hospital in the Partisan-controlled area of Petrova Gora mountain. The hospital, co-founded by Zlatiƒá, became operative in October 1941. After it was discovered and destroyed by enemy forces, it was rebuilt in a different location on Petrova Gora. The new hospital remained undetected for the duration of the war, treating more than 5,000 patients. Apart from general medical work in the hospital, Zlatiƒá also performed minor surgery. Zlatiƒá's Kordun assignment ended in late 1943, when he became a member of the Politburo of the Communist Party of Croatia. He performed political duties until the end of the war. Goli Otok imprisonment and later life In 1946 Zlatiƒá became a Yugoslav envoy to Albania. After the Tito‚ÄìStalin split in 1948, in which Albania sided with the Soviet Union and against Yugoslavia, Zlatiƒá was summoned back to the country and named Minister of Industry. On several occasions he openly argued in favor of accepting Stalin's demands. For this, Zlatiƒá was removed from his post. In 1949 he was expelled from the Communist Party, arrested, and sentenced to two years' imprisonment in Goli Otok prison camp. In 1951 Zlatiƒá was released, having signed a public statement in which he denounced his views. He became an advisor in the Ministry of Health and, later, the head of the Ministry's newly established Medical Equipment and Drugs Department. He was instrumental in advancing the country's production, testing and procurement of modern medical equipment, drugs and vaccines. Still, despite offers, he declined to be readmitted to the Communist Party. Zlatiƒá's most important contributions were in the field of clinical pharmacology. He was an editor-in-chief of Pharmaca, a Yugoslav pharmaceutical journal established in 1965, and one of the creators of the Yugoslav Classification of Drugs, a work that predated the World Health Organization's Anatomical Therapeutic Chemical Classification System. Like many other former political prisoners, Zlatiƒá was monitored by UDBA, the Yugoslav secret police, using a wide network of informers which included his friends and coworkers. Reports about Zlatiƒá noted he still harbored sympathies for the Soviet Union, but had no interest in politics, having focused on his scientific work. He remained under close surveillance until 1964, and appeared as an UDBA's person of interest as late as 1986. Chess composition Although Zlatiƒá was a successful amateur chess player in his youth, he took up chess composition only in 1950, in Petrinjska Street prison in Zagreb, using chess pieces made of bread. After his release from prison, Nenad Petroviƒá, Croatian Grandmaster for Chess Composition, encouraged him to continue his work on chess problems. In the inaugural national chess composition championships, Zlatiƒá took gold in all four categories (two-movers, three-movers, helpmates and studies), and became an international competitor in the Yugoslav and, later, Croatian national chess composition team. The World Federation for Chess Composition awarded him the titles of International Judge (1958) and Honorary Master for Chess Composition (1999).

Its creation has been controversial, since the constitution reserves external action to the government of Spain exclusively. With the arrival of the new government of the Generalitat, the President Quim Torra convened the first meeting of its board of trustees since the beginning of the process of liquidation.

Activities  Public Diplomacy Meeting in Barcelona From 2013 to 2017 DIPLOCAT organized academic events to discuss both internationally relevant topics within Catalonia with international guests and the Catalan independence process in universities around the world. Examples of these events include debates in Lisbon, Utrecht, Oslo, Cambridge, Princeton, Sciences Po Paris, Stockholm and Tokyo. Diplocat also organized public events in Catalonia itself. In that sense, Diplocat invited Jeremy Rifkin to talk about the possibilities for Catalonia to implement the third industrial revolution, and also organized an international forum in Barcelona about reception and integration of refugees in the European Union. It also published articles in international press to explain the political situation in Catalonia; awards grants; organized an executive master's degree in diplomacy and foreign affairs; organized meetings with foreign members of parliaments to promote debate on the question of the \\"right to decide\\"; invited well-known figures from different fields of work or studies to visit Catalonia; participated in electoral observation missions; aided civil society organizations carrying out activities abroad; prepares informative documents explaining key aspects of everything related to Catalonia; and carried out digital diplomacy with activity on social networks - especially Twitter. They also carried out activities in the field of cultural diplomacy, such as the #BooksAndRoses campaign, which promotes giving roses and books in and around April 23, when Sant Jordi is celebrated in Catalonia, or supporting documentaries such as the one about the 40 years of Dutch soccer player Johann Cruyff in Catalonia. DIPLOCAT also gave the annual Catalan Business Diplomacy Award, aimed at recognizing those companies which identify themselves or their products and services as Catalan. The award was first created in 2013 by DIPLOCAT working together with PIMEC. It has been won by Aranow (2013), Scytl (2014), Moritz (2015), Ultram√†gic (2016) and Beabloo (2017). With Diplocat reactivated the award was restored and the company Munich was awarded in 2019. One of the first activities held by Diplocat once reactivated was a seminar on public diplomacy in Barcelona in which professor Nicholas Cull gave the key speech. In that conference the new secretary general Ms. Laura Foraster said that Diplocat's goals are to export \\"the image, assets and values of Catalonia abroad\\". = Impact in international journalism = The presence of DIPLOCAT has been acknowledged to improve the positive perceptions on Catalonia of the international journalists who had previously established contact with the consortium.

He was a deputy from 1815‚Äì20 and 1824‚Äì33, Minister of Commerce & Manufacturing (1828‚Äì29) and a peer of France. Early years Pierre Laurent Barth√©lemy Fran√ßois Charles de Saint-Cricq was born in Orthez, Pyr√©n√®es-Atlantiques, on 24 August 1772. He was the son of Jean-Paul-Louis de Saint-Cricq, knight of the military order of St. Louis, Governor for the King of the castles of Minerve and Puisserguier in Languedoc, and of dame Marie-Laurence-Jos√®phe- Rapha√´lle-P√©tronille de Mazanedo. His family had belonged to the French aristocracy for several centuries. His parents intended that he should become a priest, and sent him to school at the Barnabites monastery in Lescar, near Pau. However, when the French Revolution (1789‚Äì1799) broke out, he moved to Paris where he attended the university. Saint-Cricq married Jeanne-Cl√©mence Lenain de Tillemont (10 May 1770 ‚Äì 30 June 1828). They had three sons and one daughter. Their first son was born in 1796. The youngest child, Caroline, was born on 9 November 1810. Saint-Cricq did not appear in public life until the advent of Napoleon. He joined the Customs administration in the First French Empire, and quickly rose to the rank of division chief.

In 1820 he defended the Ministry of √âlie Decazes and supported restoration of censorship. He was reelected on 13 November 1820 deputy for Basses-Pyr√©n√©es. However, the Chamber annulled this election on 22 December 1820. He was returned for Basses-Pyr√©n√©es on 6 March 1824 and on 17 November 1827.

Guggenheim Museum. Her work fits within the second phase of Italian Futurism. Biography Cappa‚Äôs family was originally from Piedmont. She was the second of five children. Her mother, Amalia Cappa, was a numerologist and understood the properties of alphabetic letters and gave her four sons names that begin with the letter A and her only daughter, Benedetta, a name that began with B. Her mother was a cultured woman and a Protestant. Her parents were rigid, but affectionate in her upbringing. Cappa‚Äôs father, Innocenzo Cappa, was an official of the Ministry of Railways and later an officer in the Italian army. He died after returning from World War I, a tragic event that impacted her so deeply that she described her emotional and psychological state as a ‚Äúbroken core‚Äù. Her brothers Alberto and Arturo, a historian and a journalist, also had ties to the military and Italian politics, bringing the family in close contact with the Socialist Party and eventually many Futurist thinkers. The Cappas were a middle-class family. Benedetta Cappa had access to an education that allowed her to nurture her strong vocation to painting and literature. As a child, Cappa wrote poetry and took painting and piano lessons. She attended Vittoria Columna high school in Rome and graduated in 1914. During World War I she worked at an after-school program for underprivileged children. Her interest in educational science led her to explore the pedagogy of Maria Montessori, whose ideas and concepts treat learning as a primarily sensory experience. Cappa‚Äôs interest in tactile exploration continued and would later be reconfigured in her version of Futurist ideology. She received a degree in elementary education from the \\"Universita degli Studi di Roma\\" in 1917. Around 1917, Cappa‚Äôs brother‚Äôs activities with the Futurists and friendship with Futurist artist R≈Ø≈æena Z√°tkov√° inspired her to leave teaching. She began her training as a painter in the studio of Giacomo Balla, an abstract artist who created pieces that captured movement and light. Cappa initially modeled her choices of theme and style after her mentor, depicting dynamic objects and the impact they have on their surroundings. Balla became an important mentor and a lifelong friend. Cappa began to meet avant-garde artists, poets and writers who gathered in the studio. In 1918, she met Filippo Tommaso Marinetti at Casa Balla. Their friendship was first based on intellectual pursuits and they began exchanging letters in 1918. Initially, these are written with a certain formality on both parts and deal with Futurist ideas and a discussion of their literary works. By 1920 Marinetti is addressing his correspondence to B. Cappa Marinetti. Cappa and Marinetti married three years later. Artwork and influence Though she was an artist active in Futurist circles, Cappa felt labels were restrictive and initially rejected the designation. In a 1918 correspondence with F.T. Marinetti she writes, ‚ÄúI am too free and rebellious ‚Äì I do not want to be restricted. I want only to be me.‚Äù Despite entering her marriage with such determined independence, the considerable contributions made by Cappa are often overshadowed by the figure of Marinetti and the vociferous manner with which he directed the movement. Cappa‚Äôs body of work spanned a range of media that included pen, paper, paint, metal and textiles. She wrote poetry and prose, signed, and spoke as an individual, but only recently has she garnered independent recognition. In 1919, Cappa published Spicologia di 1 Uomo, a collection of poetry which incorporates ‚Äúunusual word placement, typographic experimentation, and visual and auditory correspondences‚Äù. Subsequently published in 1924, Le Forze Umane: Romanzo Astratto con Sintesi Grafiche (Human Forces: Abstract Novel with Graphic Synthesis), has a similar structure presented in an extrapolated form. Two images from this novel provide an interesting conceptual contrast. The first, Forze Feminile: Spirale di Dolcezza + Serpe di Fascino (Feminine Forces: Spiral of Sweetness + Serpent of Charm) consists simply of three curved lines, one of which provides a central axis for the other two. The linear composition of the second drawing, Forze Maschili: Armi e Piume (Masculine Forces: Weapons and Feathers), has numerous straight lines and arcs arranged in an impenetrable tangle. Cappa's publication of Le Forze Umane was one of three books she has written. The Women of Futurism M. Barry Katz The release of her book made many futurists question her allegiance with Futurism, for her book seemed to align more with Neo-Plasticism at the time by many male Futurists who have written reviews on Cappa's book. Cappa collected all of the reviews in her Librone which can be found at the Getty Research Institute.Getty Research Institute It was a decision made from many reviewers that Cappa's first book represents the unwillingness from the reviewers to accept a women's work as part of Futurism.Appropriating the Abstract: Benedetta's \\"Le forze umane\\" and Neoplasticism The action and aesthetic of the machine age is a trope within Futurism that appears frequently in Cappa‚Äôs artwork. One early abstract painting, Velocit√† di Motoscafo, (Velocity of a Motorboat), (1923-24), contains many of the elements that would come to mark Cappa‚Äôs painting style. Well defined, curvilinear shapes, painted in gradient tones are compositionally arranged to imply objects in motion: ‚Äú‚Ä¶ the interplay of ‚Äòforce lines,‚Äô become the subject‚Äù. The artist‚Äôs exploration of the machine continued with Luci + Rumori di un Treno Notturno, (Lights + Sounds of a Night Train), (ca. 1924) and with Aeropittura (1925). A trip to Latin America in 1926 was followed by a series of abstract paintings done in gouache on paper. As Cappa developed her artistic practice, her influence within the Futurist Movement expanded. Between the end of World War I and the early 1930s, there was an ideological transformation which led to the period commonly known as Second Wave Futurism. The notably misogynistic tone of the foundation texts was largely muted as the number of female Futurists increased. Several other themes, such as Technology, Speed, and Mechanization carried over into this new incarnation of Futurism. For this reason, Cappa‚Äôs oil painting Il Grande X (1931) is considered the culmination of one era and the prelude to another. In the two decades since F.T. Marinetti‚Äôs manifesto, the brash avant-garde movement had largely become the establishment. It was the Futurists‚Äô affiliation with the state establishment that would lead to one of Cappa‚Äôs most recognizable paintings, her mural series for the Conference Room at the Palazzo delle Poste in Palermo, Sicily. The building is an amalgam of works by several Futurist artists. Designed by the Rationalist architect, Angiolo Mazzoni, the Poste Italiane houses tile wall mosaics by Luigi Colombo Fil√¨a and Enrico Prampolini in addition to the murals by Benendetta. The shared themes of synthesis and communication are critical to the aesthetic program of the Futurist structure. Completed between 1933 and 1934, each painting depicts a form of information transfer, including terrestrial, maritime, aerial, radio, telegraphic and telephonic communication. The pale blue and green color palette, along with the use of tempera and encaustic media, were designed to invoke resonances with Pompeian frescos. The collection represents the idealized speed and efficiency of message delivery in the modern world. Exhibition history and legacy Cappa‚Äôs works were exhibited widely, along with the rest of the Italian Futurists, both during her lifetime and after, with major exhibitions as early as 1926 and up until the outbreak of World War II. She was a regular participant in the Venice Biennale, and was the first woman to have a painting reproduced in a Biennale catalog. A long pause ensued after the war, which lasted until the 1980s, when the works of the Futurists were, once again, starting to be appreciated.

Guggenheim Museum, New York The 1998 exhibition in Minneapolis was the first major international solo retrospective of Cappa‚Äôs works, but it is perhaps the comprehensive Futurists‚Äô exhibition at the Guggenheim in New York of 2014 that saw the most exposure for her work, as she was the best represented of the nine female artists included in the one of the most expansive exhibitions of Italian Futurism ever mounted, covering more than 360 works by some 80 artists. Indeed, it was Benedetta‚Äôs five monumental mural paintings, Sintesi delle Comunicazioni (Synthesis of Communication)(1933-1934), which closed the show, on loan for the first time ever, and placed as they were, at the apex of the exhibition. These murals are the best known of her works, stemming from the muralism movement of the second wave of Futurism, which began in the early 1930s. This new emphasis on murals by the Futurists was brought to prominence in 1934, when they published three articles on muralism in their new magazine, Stile Futurista. The effort was motivated by the younger Futurists, who thought the medium would allow them to utilize the panoptic and panoramic vision of the earlier, Aeropittura pictorial genre of the Futurists to best effect in creating the ‚Äútotal environment‚Äù in which they had long sought to immerse viewers with their works.(p. 317) Futurist murals were unique in that they would contain only imagery inspired by modern technology. The Futurists were also keen to have public commissions for their murals, and cited numerous venues they wished to embellish with them in pamphlets published to accompany their two mural exhibitions of 1934. Their wish list included numerous political and public venues, such as train stations, posts offices, schools, and even a seaplane base. Despite their efforts, the Futurists received few public mural commissions in the 1930s, with the exception of three mural-sized works for the new Palazzi delle Poste e Telegraphi (Post and Telegraph offices) in La Spezia, Palermo. La Spezia was an important port and also home to several military bases at the time. Almost all of Benedetta‚Äôs paintings which have survived were painted within a fifteen-year period. The earliest of these can be traced to 1924, when she created her well known Treno nella Note in Velocit√†, (Speeding Train by Night), as well as Velocit√† di Motoscafo, (Speed of a Motorboat), considered her finest piece of abstract painting. In addition to her rich artistic legacy, Cappa constantly reaffirmed in her works a desire that contributions by women would help to reduce aggression, although she did so in accordance with the Futurist‚Äôs revolutionary ideals. But even within the context of the male-dominated Futurist movement, and the marriage to its founder, Cappa insisted on direct action and participation for women: In her own words: ‚ÄúI believe that the feminine soul is at the dawn of her artistic expression...without copying the experiences of men.‚Äù(p. 69) References External links *Benedetta, WikiArt 1897 births 1977 deaths Italian Futurist painters Italian women painters Artists from Rome 20th-century Italian painters 20th-century Italian women artists Futurist painters ","title":"Benedetta Cappa"},{"id":"42548361","text":"Bobby Joe Pierce is an American politician and a Democratic member of the Arkansas Senate representing District 27 since January 14, 2013.

anti-Ukrainian billboard in Donbass. Referendums on the status of Donetsk and Luhansk oblasts, parts of Ukraine that together make up the Donbass region, took place on 11 May 2014 in many towns under the control of the self- proclaimed Donetsk and Luhansk People's Republics. These referendums sought to legitimise the establishment of the republics, in the context of the rising pro-Russian unrest in the aftermath of the 2014 Ukrainian revolution. In addition, a counter-referendum on accession to Dnipropetrovsk Oblast was held in some Ukrainian-controlled parts of Donetsk and Luhansk oblasts. The results of the separatist referendums were not officially recognised by any government, including those of Ukraine, the United States, the countries of the European Union, and Russia. The Ukrainian government said that the referendum was illegal, and a number of nations--such as Germany, the United States, France, and Britain--said that the referendum was unconstitutional and lacked legitimacy. The Russian government expressed \\"respect\\" for the results and urged a \\"civilised\\" implementation. Background Decree on holding the referendum in Donetsk. The referendums were modelled on a similar disputed referendum held in Crimea during the Crimean crisis. That vote ultimately resulted in the annexation of Crimea by the Russian Federation. The Ukrainian transitional president Olexander Turchynov said that the proclamation of the republics, along with protests in other eastern cities, was evidence of a \\"second stage\\" of Russian operations \\"playing out the Crimean scenario\\". After its proclamation, the self-proclaimed authorities of the Donetsk People's Republic announced that they would carry out a referendum on 11 May to determine the future status of the region, and legitimise the establishment of the Republic. Many government buildings in towns and cities across Donetsk and Luhansk oblasts became occupied by separatist insurgents as the Republic expanded its territorial control. As a result, the Ukrainian government launched a counter-offensive against insurgents in some parts of Donetsk Oblast. An agreement made in Geneva between the United States, European Union, Russia, and Ukraine was intended to demilitarise and de-escalate the conflict, but the leaders of the republics rejected it. They stated that Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov did not represent them, and that an agreement made by uninvolved parties was not binding on their behaviour. Instead, they said that they would only end their occupation of government buildings after the referendums. The referendums took place as mounting anger rose against the so- called \\"anti-terrorist\\" operations by Ukrainian forces against separatists, which resulted in civilian casualties.Ukraine: pro-Russia separatists set for victory in eastern region referendum World news. The Guardian. 11 May 2014. Russian president Vladimir Putin publicly asked pro-Russian separatists to postpone the proposed referendums to create the necessary conditions for dialogue on 7 May.

In the recording, the separatist said he wanted to postpone the referendum, due to the DPR's inability to control all of Donetsk Oblast. Barkashov said that he had communicated with Putin, and insisted on holding the referendum regardless of the separatist leader's concerns. He instructed the separatists to tabulate the results as 89% in favour of autonomy. Separatists stated that the recording was fake. Swiss left-wing newspaper Tages-Anzeiger reported that voters were able to vote as many times as they wanted. Internal Affairs ministry officials branded the vote a farce, and said that just over 32 percent of registered voters in Donetsk Oblast participated in the vote. According to Andrei Buzin, co-chair of GOLOS Association, there were significant irregularities in the organisation and holding of the referendum. Referendum in Donetsk Oblast =Organisation= A central election committee was set up to organise the referendum. Fifty-five local election committees, and 2,279 polling stations were to be established to carry it out. A number of towns refused to hold the referendum. To cover all the region's registered voters, 3.2 million voting ballots needed to be produced. They began to be printed on 29 April, and printing continued for eight days after that. The ballots used had no protective features to prevent mass-duplication, and were printed with standard commercial printers. Officials from the Donetsk regional administration said that the separatists would require at least 85 million US dollars to fund the referendum, and that it would cost at least 8 million for Donetsk city alone. According to authorities from the republic, however, the budget of the referendum was minimal, mostly being composed of donations from private citizens and businesses. Ballots, for example, costed only 9,000 US dollars to produce. By 10 May, fifty-three local election committees and 1,527 polling stations had been established. The Donetsk regional education superintendent informed reporters that they were forced under threat of death to organise polling stations in the schools. Two official electoral commissioners were kidnapped by separatists prior to the vote. =Question= A line to enter a polling place in Donetsk city, 11 May The chairman of the DPR, Denis Pushilin, said that the ballots were printed in both Russian and Ukrainian, and asked one question: \\"Do you support the declaration of state independence of the Donetsk People's Republic?\\" The Russian word used, —Å–∞–º–æ—Å—Ç–æ—è—Ç–µ–ª—å–Ω–æ—Å—Ç—å, (samostoyatel'nost) (literally \\"standing by oneself\\"), can be translated as either full independence or broad autonomy, which left voters confused about what their ballot actually meant.East Ukraine goes to the polls for independence referendum The Observer.

Details =States= The Western Blue Chip Economic Forecast includes forecasts on the following states in the Western United States: Arizona, California, Colorado, Idaho, Montana, Nevada, New Mexico, Oregon, Texas, Utah, Washington, and Wyoming. =Variables= The forecasts are published monthly and include estimates for the year-on-year percentage changes in the following variables for each state: * Personal income in current dollars * Wages and salary employment * Population (i.e., it measures population growth) * Single-family housing permits The forecasts are made both for the change from the previous calendar year to the current calendar year and from the current calendar year to the next calendar year. =Forecast sources= For each state, one can access, in addition to the consensus forecasts, forecasts from each of the sources that are on the panel. The forecast sources vary by state, though some forecast sources are common across states. For instance, for the state of Arizona, the forecast sources include the Arizona Department of Administration, Arizona Public Service, Wells Fargo, and many others. For the state of California, forecast sources include the California Department of Finance, Chapman University, the UCLA Business Forecasting Center, Wells Fargo, University of the Pacific, Woodbury University, and others. Reception =Academic reception= There has been some academic research into the accuracy of the Western Blue Chip Economic Forecast. A 2003 paper by Carol T. West (published just two years after the forecast became operational) pointed to the data set from the Western Blue Chip Economic Forecast as a valuable information source for future studies of the accuracy of regional forecasts. A 2009 paper by Phillips and Lopez used the Western Blue Chip Economic Forecast data to compare the accuracy of different forecasters and models, and found that some forecasters consistently outperformed others. Moreover, based on an informal survey of the most accurate forecasters, it found that they were likely to use formal statistical models rather than pure judgment. The Dallas Fed's model used to forecast growth in Texas was found to be one of the more accurate forecasting models. =Reception in financial press and blogs= The Western Blue Chip Economic Forecast has been cited in Forbes as one of the few sources of regional forecasts for the economy of the United States. It has also been cited in a number of regional business journals in discussions of regional economic prospects.

MCM-41 (Mobil Composition of Matter No. 41) is a mesoporous material with a hierarchical structure from a family of silicate and alumosilicate solids that were first developed by researchers at Mobil Oil Corporation and that can be used as catalysts or catalyst supports.Reichinger, M. (2007) Por√∂se Silikate mit hierarchischer Porenstruktur: Synthese von mikro-/mesopor√∂sem MCM-41 und MCM-48 Materialien aus zeolithischen Baueinheiten des MFI-Ger√ºststrukturtyps, Dissertation Ruhr-Universit√§t Bochum (in German)  Structure  MCM-41 consists of a regular arrangement of cylindrical mesopores that form a one-dimensional pore system. It is characterized by an independently adjustable pore diameter, a sharp pore distribution, a large surface and a large pore volume. The pores are larger than with zeolites and the pore distribution can easily be adjusted. The mesopores have a diameter of 2 nm to 6.5 nm.  Properties  Contrary to zeolites, the framework of MCM-41 has no bronsted acid centers because there is no aluminium contained in the lattice. The acidity of alumina-doped MCM-41 therefore is comparable to that of the amorphous alumosilicates. MCM-41 is not hydrothermally stable because of the slight wall thickness and the low degree of cross-linking of the silicate units.  Synthesis  To achieve a defined pore diameter surfactants are used that form micelles in the synthesis solution. These micelles form templates that help build up the mesoporous framework. For MCM-41 mostly cetyltrimethylammonium bromide (CTAB) is used. 900px The surfactant first forms rod-like micelles that subsequently align into hexagonal arrays. After adding silica species these cover the rods. Later, calcination leads to a condensation of the silanol groups so that the silicon atoms are bridged by oxygen atoms. The organic template is oxidized and disappears. Uses MCM-41, as the zeolites, are widely used as catalytic cracking. They are also used for separations.

Location  Fischbach lies in the southern part of the Palatine Forest, the German part of the Wasgau region, near the Franco-German border and in the heart of the cross-border Palatinate Forest-North Vosges Biosphere Reserve. The Biosphere House and its grounds are on the eastern edge of the municipality on the water meadows of the Saarbach stream.  Development and structure  The Biosphere House was set up as a decentralised project of the world exposition Expo 2000 in Hanover. The project is based on the modular principle and is continually being developed: Originally the Biosphere House was a single-storey building that opened in March 2000 as an information centre for the biosphere reserve. An important part of the centre is a multi-faceted multimedia exhibition. In March 2002, two years after its opening, the nature experience centre (Naturerlebniszentrum) was added. This consists of an exhibition room with adjacent accommodation and a restaurant, as well as an interactive circular path. This is 1,500 metres long and has 14 way stations with interesting information about the region; it is also pram- and wheelchair-friendly. The nature experience centre is frequently used by school classes. In June 2003 a treetop walkway was opened with a length of 270 metres and running through the treetops of the Palatine Forest over suspension bridges and plate bridges (Tellerbr√ºcke). The aerial high point and finish is an \\"eagle's nest\\", 35 metres high, from where there are good views over the biosphere reserve. To return to the ground there is a 45 metre long slide. In its first 3 years 467,000 people experienced the walkway. The Water Experience Path (Wasser- Erlebnis-Weg) was opened in 2006. The ca. 2 kilometre long route along the Saarbach comprises 14 stations, at which various aspects of water are presented, e.g. hydropower, water creatures and water quality. Also in 2006 the second floor of the main building of the Biosphere House was opened with an exhibition with an interactive history on the subject of waterbodies and stream valleys (Gew√§sser und Bacht√§ler).  Economics  Because visitor numbers were much higher than the original prognosis, the Biosphere House can fund its own routine operations and only resorts to state subsidies for its larger projects. About 45 employees ‚Äì 15 permanent and 30 seasonal ‚Äì work at the Biosphere House.

While not prescribed, the practice was generally that recipients must already have received the Military Merit Medal. The equivalent award for other ranks was the Pro Merito Medal of 1975. Although a rare occurrence, some officers were awarded both versions of the Southern Cross Medal, one such example being Vice-Admiral Lambert Jackson Woodburne DVR, SD, SM, former Chief of the Navy. In such cases, the post-nominal letters \\"SM\\" are used once only. Order of wear The position of the Southern Cross Medal of 1975 in the official order of precedence was revised three times after 1975, to accommodate the inclusion or institution of new decorations and medals, first upon the integration into the South African National Defence Force on 27 April 1994, again when decorations and medals were belatedly instituted in April 1996 for the two former non-statutory forces, the Azanian People's Liberation Army and Umkhonto we Sizwe, and again when a new series of military orders, decorations and medals was instituted in South Africa on 27 April 2003. Its position remained unchanged, as it was on 27 April 1994, upon the latter two occasions. ;South African Defence Force until 26 April 1994: Pro Merito Medal (1967) (PMM) Southern Cross Medal (1975) (SM) Pro Merito Medal (1975) (PMM) *Official SADF order of precedence: ** Preceded by the Pro Merito Medal (1967) (PMM). ** Succeeded by the Pro Merito Medal (1975) (PMM). *Official national order of precedence: ** Preceded by the Medal for Merit in the South African Prisons Service. ** Succeeded by the Pro Merito Medal (1975) (PMM).Republic of South Africa Government Gazette no. 15093, Pretoria, 3 September 1993 ;South African National Defence Force from 27 April 1994: Distinguished Service Medal, Silver Southern Cross Medal (1975) (SM) Pro Merito Medal (1975) (PMM) *Official SANDF order of precedence: ** Preceded by the Distinguished Service Medal, Silver of the Republic of Venda. ** Succeeded by the Pro Merito Medal (1975) (PMM) of the Republic of South Africa. *Official national order of precedence: ** Preceded by the Medal for Merit in the Prisons Service of the Republic of South Africa. ** Succeeded by the Pro Merito Medal (1975) (PMM) of the Republic of South Africa.Republic of South Africa Government Gazette Vol. 477, no. 27376, Pretoria, 11 March 2005, Description ;Obverse The Southern Cross Medal of 1975 is struck in silver, to fit in a circle 38 millimetres in diameter, and is 3 millimetres thick at the centre.

Her novels have been praised for their use of both Jamaican Creole and Standard English. Early life and education Jean Constance Creary was born in St. Andrew, Jamaica, the youngest of three children to parents who were school teachers. Her father was also a Methodist minister. They moved to the capital, Kingston in 1944, and then to St. James and Trelawny. She attended rural elementary schools, and then St. Hilda's High School in Brown's Town, St. Ann from 1949 to 1954 on a government merit scholarship. She earned another scholarship to pursue a bachelor's degree in English literature and language at University College of the West Indies (now UWI, Mona) from 1955 to 1958, and another scholarship for a master's degree in literature at Oxford University. Career In 1962, after Oxford, she returned to teach Old English and linguistics at University College of the West Indies. She also served as a consultant to Jamaica's Ministry of Education on education in Jamaica in the newly independent country, and served on various education committees. D'Costa continued her creative writing while teaching and consulting. Her two most popular novels, Sprat Morrison (1972) and Escape to Last Man Peak (1976), have been used in schools throughout Jamaica and the Caribbean region. Her novels are geared primarily towards children aged 11 to 13. She researched and wrote extensively on Jamaican creole culture., and published handbooks for service agencies in Jamaica, including the Kingston office of the United States Peace Corps. In 1980, D'Costa received a professorship at Hamilton College, New York, where she stayed until 1998. She taught Old English, Caribbean literature, creative writing, and linguistics. Themes Writing for children on the cusp of teenhood, D'Costa addresses \\"their need to relate to actuality ... and their need to retain some of the comforting illusions of childhood\\". To satisfy the latter need, she draws from Jamaican folklore and oral traditions for the plots, themes, and tone of her works. Prominent in Caribbean folklore are \\"duppy stories\\", in which ghosts or unsettled spirits return to haunt the land of the living. In her third novel, Voice in the Wind, for example, D'Costa addresses children's perceptions about death and the supernatural. She also references the oral tales that were traditionally told \\"at wakes and nine- nights\\". D'Costa paints a vivid picture of historical and contemporary Jamaican countryside. D'Costa often uses Jamaican Creole for dialogue alongside Standard English. Her use of language, together with her understanding that her works are models for children's own literary attempts, makes her books natural subjects for classroom discussion. Sprat Morrison has been required reading in the \\"first grade\\" of Jamaican high schools since 1972, while Escape to Last Man Peak and Voice in the Wind are assigned by many teachers. Students have corresponded with D'Costa and she has accepted invitations to speak in schools. Her works have been lauded for preserving and conveying Jamaican speech rhythms and dialect. Personal life D'Costa retired from Hamilton College in 1998, with the title of professor emeritus. She married David D'Costa, a journalist,in 1967. They relocated to Florida in 1997.

It is a sci-fi short film that depicts Palestine as a skyscraper, with each floor representing a city in Palestine. An earlier version of the project garnered attention when it was removed from a competition at the Mus√©e de l'Elys√©e allegedly due to its political connotations.  Plot  The film starts with a pregnant woman arriving at a train station. She makes her way up an escalator with a travel bag in hand. At the top of the escalator she uses a fingerprint and retinal scan to enter a lobby and walks over to the elevators. As she pushes the button, she looks over to a poster on the wall that reads \\"Nation Estate: Living the High Life\\". Next to the elevator is a directory for the building floors. Each floor is described as a city or area in Palestine. In the elevator, advertisements play on a television screen. The advertisements seems to address different social and political issues that Palestinians face today, such as water supply, food and travelling restrictions. The first stop the elevator makes is on the 13th floor, Jerusalem. As two other 'travelers' make their way off the elevator, you can see the Al-Aqsa Mosque. The next stop is Bethlehem. As the woman steps off the elevator and walks away, the city's old architecture can be seen as the basis for the floor. She walks into a tunnel that seems to be authentic stone and mortar from the outside, but is more modern on the inside. She stops at a door, and using a keycard in the form of a Palestinian flag, she opens up the door to an apartment. She sets the keycard down, and picks up a watering can. She heads over to a window, and in front of the window, there is a tree growing out of the ground and she waters it. Afterwards, she heads over to a cabinet and opens it up, revealing multicolored cans. When she grabs one and looks at it, it has a label that says 'Mloukhieh', a food native to the Middle East and North Africa. She returns the can and reaches for another, this time it is 'Marmaon'. She heats it up using a fingerprint and pours it out into a bowl, along with other food. She sets it down on the table and makes her way to the window. After pressing a button on the wall, the view changes into one of Jerusalem. The woman holds her belly as she looks on to the city.  Controversy  In 2011, a multimedia project of the same name by the film‚Äôs director, Larissa Sansour, was selected to be a part of the Lacoste Elys√©e Competition. However, after being shortlisted for a prize by the museum, Larissa was contacted by the museum staff, informing her that her film was deemed \\"too pro-Palestinian\\" by the people from Lacoste, allegations which the company later denied. The museum also requested that Sansour release a statement saying that she had \\"decided to pursue other opportunities.\\" After the work‚Äôs removal sparked outrage, Lacoste ended its sponsorship of the ¬£21,000 prize while the gallery in turn suspended its relationship with the company.

More specifically, it is the view that revolution is a necessary precondition for a transition from the capitalist mode of production to the socialist mode of production. Revolution is not necessarily defined as a violent insurrection; it is defined as seizure of political power by mass movements of the working class so that the state is directly controlled or abolished by the working class as opposed to the capitalist class and its interests.Thompson, Carl D. (October 1903). \\"What Revolutionary Socialism Means\\". The Vanguard. Green Bay: Socialist Party of America. 2 (2): 13. Retrieved 31 August 2020 ‚Äì via the Marxist Internet Archive. Revolutionary socialists believe such a state of affairs is a precondition for establishing socialism and orthodox Marxists believe that it is inevitable but not predetermined. Revolutionary socialism encompasses multiple political and social movements that may define \\"revolution\\" differently from one another. These include movements based on orthodox Marxist theory such as De Leonism, impossibilism and Luxemburgism as well as movements based on Leninism and the theory of vanguardist-led revolution such as Maoism, Marxism‚ÄìLeninism and Trotskyism. Revolutionary socialism also includes other Marxist, Marxist-inspired and non-Marxist movements such as those found in democratic socialism, revolutionary syndicalism, social anarchism and social democracy. Revolutionary socialism is contrasted to reformist socialism, especially the reformist wing of social democracy and other evolutionary approaches to socialism. Revolutionary socialism is opposed to social movements that seek to gradually ameliorate the economic and social problems of capitalism through political reform.

In 1875, the Social Democratic Party of Germany (SPD) published a somewhat reformist Gotha Program which was attacked by Marx in Critique of the Gotha Program, where he reiterated the need for dictatorship of the proletariat. The reformist viewpoint was introduced into Marxist thought by Eduard Bernstein, one of the leaders of the SPD. From 1896 to 1898, Bernstein published a series of articles entitled \\"Probleme des Sozialismus\\" (\\"Problems of Socialism\\"). These articles led to a debate on revisionism in the SPD and can be seen as the origins of a reformist trend within Marxism. In 1900, Rosa Luxemburg wrote Social Reform or Revolution?, a polemic against Bernstein's position. The work of reforms, Luxemburg argued, could only be carried on \\"in the framework of the social form created by the last revolution\\". In order to advance society to socialism from the capitalist 'social form', a social revolution will be necessary: In 1902, Vladimir Lenin attacked Bernstein's position in his What Is to Be Done? When Bernstein first put forward his ideas, the majority of the SPD rejected them. The 1899 congress of the SPD reaffirmed the Erfurt Program as did the 1901 congress. The 1903 congress denounced \\"revisionist efforts\\". = World War I and Zimmerwald = On 4 August 1914, the SPD members of the Reichstag voted for the government's war budget while the French and Belgium socialists publicly supported and joined their governments.

Revolutionary socialists, particularly Trotskyists, argue that the Bolsheviks only seized power as the expression of the mass of workers and peasants, whose desires are brought into being by an organised force‚Äîthe revolutionary party. Marxists such as Trotskyists argue that Lenin did not advocate seizing of power until he felt that the majority of the population, represented in the soviets, demanded revolutionary change and no longer supported the reformist government of Alexander Kerensky established in the earlier revolution of February 1917. In the Lessons of October, Leon Trotsky wrote: For these Marxists, the fact that the Bolsheviks won a majority (in alliance with the Left Socialist-Revolutionaries) in the second all-Russian congress of Soviets‚Äîdemocratically elected bodies‚Äîwhich convened at the time of the October revolution, shows that they had popular support of the masses of workers, peasants and soldiers, the vast majority of Russian society.

The project focuses on public works programs, which put millions of unemployed to work, saved families from destitution, and renovated the infrastructure of the United States. What is more, most New Deal public works - schools, roads, dams, waterworks, hospitals and more - continued to function for decades and tens of thousands still exist today. The centerpiece of the Living New Deal is a website that catalogs and maps the location of public works projects and artworks created from 1933 to 1943 under the aegis of federal government during the administration of President Franklin D. Roosevelt.The Living New Deal does not currently document the tens of thousands of public service projects sponsored by the WPA (and other New Deal programs), such as sewing rooms, archaeological digs and work on library catalogs, because of their uncertain locations and/or absence of surviving results. This online catalog identifies thousands of New Deal sites and pinpoints them on an interactive map. Sites can be searched by name, city, state, category, and agency. The website and its growing database show the vast imprint the New Deal had across the nation. The Living New Deal website was selected as one of the 10 best new sites on the web for 2014 by Slate Magazine,Slate Magazine Top Websites of 2014, Dec. 30, 2014 and has been mentioned in the Boston Globe, Vox, the San Francisco Chronicle, and other news outlets.Renee Loth, \\"When Public Buildings were revered,\\" Boston Globe, Nov. 28, 2014, retrieved May 25, 2017; Matthew Yglesias, \\"See every New Deal project in America, in one map,\\" Vox, October 28, 2014, retrieved May 25, 2017; John King, \\"Chasing Bay Area artifacts of the New Deal\\", SFGate, September 1, 2008, retrieved May 25, 2017. A constellation of economic stimulus policies and social programs enacted to lift America out of the Great Depression, the New Deal touched every state, city, town, and rural area. Yet, there is no national record of what the New Deal built, only bits and pieces found in local and national archives, published sources, and on occasional plaques and markers. This represents an enormous gap in the historic record and a collective failure of memory. The Living New Deal's goal is to uncover every New Deal public works site in all fifty states and build a public archive of photographs, documents, films, and stories from this pivotal period. As of mid-2017, the project had reached a total of 13,000 documented New Deal sites. In addition to the online archive, the Living New Deal works to highlight the legacy of the New Deal by: Plaque identifying a Works Progress Administration project *Acting as a clearinghouse for New Deal news and discussion. * Gathering stories of families whose lives were touched by the New Deal. * Engaging the public to protect New Deal public works sites from neglect and destruction. * Publishing articles, newsletters and teaching aids about the New Deal and its legacy, including the public television produced app 'Lets Get Lost' on New Deal Murals. * Compiling bibliographies and web links to sources of information about the New Deal. * Creating a New Deal online film archive. * Publishing pocket maps of New Deal sites in key cities, such as San Francisco and New York. * Sponsoring New Deal tours, lectures, conferences, film series, and other events. * Writing summaries of New Deal programs, and biographies of leading New Dealers. * Envisioning a national New Deal museum to record and celebrate the achievements of the era. The ultimate aim of the Living New Deal is to educate the general public, civic leaders and politicians about the New Deal and to show that it provides a proven model for reviving the economy in hard times, dealing with unemployment (especially among youth), rebuilding communities all across the country, restoring faith in government and renewing a sense of national purpose. In a time when so many people and places are hurting for good jobs and economic renewal, and the infrastructure of the country is crumbling, the New Deal can serve as an example for the present day. Organization The Living New Deal's research arm is based at the Department of Geography at the University of California, Berkeley and its policy arm is a California non- profit corporation. The Living New Deal is directed by Professor Emeritus Richard Walker of the University of California. Its founder and Project Scholar is Dr. Gray Brechin. The core operation is run by a team in the San Francisco Bay Area. Its national Advisory and Research Boards are made up of distinguished scholars from around the country, including New Deal historians Robert Leuchtenberg and Ira Katznelson, former Labor Secretary Robert Reich and former Council of Economic Advisors Chair Christina Romer, and members of the Roosevelt family. The Living New Deal relies on a network of Research Associates and other volunteers, including historians, teachers, students, artists, history buffs, librarians, journalists, and photographers to document New Deal sites throughout the U.S. They upload their discoveries, such as photographs, historic documents, news articles, and commentary to the Living New Deal's website. The information is verified by research assistants at Berkeley before being published. The Living New Deal is a crowdsourced project that invites anyone to volunteer and sign up as a research associate. History The Living New Deal began as an idea for a book by Dr. Gray Brechin in 2002, a few years before he became vice-president of the National New Deal Preservation Association. The concept quickly proved too ambitious for a single researcher. A group project was launched as the California Living New Deal in 2006, sponsored by the Institute for Research on Labor and Employment at the University of California, Berkeley, and the California Historical Society, with support from the Columbia Foundation (no longer extant). In 2010, it moved to the Department of Geography at UC Berkeley. In 2011, the Living New Deal project went national and dropped \\"California\\" from its name. Two years later, the project merged with New Deal Art Registry, assembled by Barbara and John Bernstein, an extensive online catalog of murals, sculptures, and mosaics by New Deal artists. Despite efforts to document them, many New Deal artworks that adorn public buildings have been decommissioned, privatized, or are threatened with demolition; many have already been lost or destroyed. The Living New Deal project has continued to grow rapidly, adding hundreds (even thousands) of New Deal sites to its map every year. New Deal's legacy of public works When President Franklin D. Roosevelt took office in 1933, America was in the depths of the Great Depression. The stock market crash of 1929 led the implosion and the downturn continued for over three years as thousands of banks and businesses failed and millions of people lost their life savings, farms, and homes. At the nadir, one-quarter of the U.S. workforce was unemployed and national output had fallen by one-third.Chandler, Lester. 1970, America's Greatest Depression, 1929‚Äì1941. New York: Harper and Row; Kindleberger, Charles. 1973. A World in Depression. Berkeley: University of California Press. To address the economic collapse and resulting human suffering, President Roosevelt declared a \\"new deal for the American people.\\" Within days of his inauguration, he had launched The New Deal, an innovative constellation of federal programs aimed at restoring financial stability, stabilizing industry and agriculture, increasing relief efforts, and employing millions of desperate workers.Leuchtenberg, William. 1963.

Put to Work: Relief Programs in the Great Depression, New York: Cornerstone Books. The economy began a rapid revival from 1933 to 1942, marred by a sharp recession in 1937. National output recovered to pre-Depression levels just before the outbreak of World War II, which absorbed the last of the mass unemployment of the era.Romer, Christina. 1992. \\"What Ended the Great Depression?\\" Journal of Economic History. 52, no. 4: 757‚Äì84; Field, Alexander. 2011. A Great Leap Forward: The 1930s Depression and US Economic Growth, New Haven: Yale University Press. The New Deal transformed American government and reformed American society in several important respects, such as reining in Wall Street, supporting home ownership, and introducing Social Security. But the visible hallmark of the New Deal was its vast array of public works, which put millions of people back to work and put much-needed funds into the hands of impoverished families and straitened communities. These were much more than \\"make work\\" programs, as they are often portrayed; New Deal's public works dramatically overhauled the nation's infrastructure, refashioned the American landscape, and modernized cities, towns, and rural areas across the country.Patterson, James. 1969, The New Deal and the States: Federalism in Transition, Princeton, NJ: Princeton University Press; Amenta, Edwin. 2000, Bold Relief: Institutional Politics and the Origins of Modern American Social Policy, Princeton, NJ: Princeton University Press; Cohen, Lizabeth, 2003,A Consumers' Republic: The Politics Of Mass Consumption In Postwar America, New York Alfred A. Knopf. The most famous of the so-called \\"alphabet soup\\" of New Deal public works agencies were the Public Works Administration (PWA), the Works Progress Administration (WPA), the Civilian Conservation Corps (CCC), the Tennessee Valley Authority (TVA), and the Federal Arts Project (FAP) within the WPA. But the administration also made huge investments in older agencies, such as the Treasury Department (Post Offices and the Treasury Section of Fine Arts), the Bureau of Reclamation, and the Bureau of Public Roads. Smaller but vital builder agencies were the Civil Works Administration (CWA), Rural Electrification Administration (REA), National Youth Administration (NYA), Resettlement/Farm Security Administration (RA/FSA), Soil Conservation Service (SCS), and Bonneville Power Administration (BPA).There are histories of almost every agency, e.g.: Lilienthal, David. 1953.

In less than ten years, the New Deal public works programs built and expanded a modern infrastructure that Americans still depend on, but that few are aware of. Every day people use roads, schools, auditoriums, parks, sewers, tunnels, sidewalks, forests, trails, and more without realizing these are the result of an all-out-effort by the Federal government, in alliance with state and local governments, to put people to work during hard times. Some historians have argued that these public works were the foundation for the health and prosperity of the nation for generations afterward.Leighninger, Robert. 2007.

Because of the swiftness by which the New Deal sprang into action and the huge scale and scope of its efforts, a great many of its accomplishments went unrecorded. Although the New Deal public works agencies built tens of thousands of public buildings‚Äîpost offices, airports, hospitals, museums, colleges, universities, and government buildings‚Äîmost of what was created remains unmarked. Moreover, in the post-war years, a concerted effort by the New Deal's critics to erase its memory destroyed many identifying markers on New Deal-era buildings and removed public artwork commissioned by the FAP and Treasury Department.Phillips-Fine, Kim. 2009.

Early life  Thomas Lee \\"Pee Wee\\" Butts was born August 27, 1919 in Sparta, Georgia, the birthplace of boxer Tommy \\"Hurricane\\" Jackson. He spent his childhood there and attended Washington High School. He played football and baseball for Washington High and was considered one of the best quarterbacks in the area.Holway, John. \\"Pee Wee Butts.\\" Voices from the great Black baseball leagues. New York: Dodd, Mead, 1975. 327-338. Print. The name \\"Pee Wee\\" came from his stature. At 5'7\\" and 140 pounds after a big meal, Butts was one of the smallest players on record.  The beginning  At age 17, Butts quit high school and began playing baseball with the Atlanta Black Crackers of the Negro American League in 1936. Because of his youth, opposing players tried to intimidate Butts by sliding spikes up into him. Here he also learned to throw side arm to get batters out at first.Porter, David L.. Biographical dictionary of American sports. New York: Greenwood Press, 1992. Print. The team moved to Indianapolis after Pee Wee's first two seasons and became known as the ABCs. In 1940, the Baltimore Elite Giants of the Negro National League came to town to play the ABCs and offered Pee Wee a tryout after the game. Pee Wee was hesitant to leave home, but he figured the Black Crackers/ABCs team was breaking up, so he might as well.  The Baltimore Elite Giants  For nine seasons in Baltimore, Pee Wee was a .280 hitter and he developed a reputation as one of the finest fielders in the game.\\"Pee Wee Butts.\\" Pee Wee Butts. N.p., n.d. Web. 14 Mar. 2014. . He only hit 3 home runs in nine seasons but made up for it in average and fielding ability. He often turned double plays with the help of Junior Gilliam. It is said that Pee Wee coached Gilliam into the fine fielder that he became. Pee Wee had a problem with nerves at first. He was so nervous in his first game in Baltimore that he threw 3 balls into the stands. His manager, Felton Snow gave him the nickname \\"Cool breeze\\" to help him feel comfortable. In 1949, Baltimore won the pennant and the team fell apart financially. Gilliam went to Springfield, Massachusetts to try out for the Minor Leagues and Pee Wee knew he also would be moving on.  Puerto Rico  For several seasons, Butts played in the off season in Puerto Rico in the late 1940s and early 1950s, after the Negro League season had commenced. In 1948, Butts hit .324 with the Santurce Crabbers.  End of career  When Gilliam left for the Dodgers, rather than have to start over with a new second baseman, Butts went to Canada to play for the Winnipeg Buffaloes of the Manitoba-Dakota League. Under manager Willie Wells, Butts batted .286 and the team won the pennant. Wells helped Pee Wee to tame his erratic arm by telling him to remain low after fielding so he would not have to rush his throws. One season in Canada was enough for Butts. He said it was too cold in Winnipeg and he went to Lincoln, Nebraska to play for the Class-A affiliate of the Philadelphia A's. Lincoln was none too kind to Pee Wee as he batted only .170 for the one season he was there. The organization wanted to send him to play for their Class B team, but Butts did not want to hold a roster spot from a young player who had a chance of moving up. He went back to the Negro Leagues for two seasons before playing his final season in 1955 with the Texas City Texans of the Big State league.\\"Thomas Butts Negro League Statistics & History - Baseball-Reference.com.\\" Baseball-Reference.com. N.p., n.d. Web. 14 Mar. 2014..  Almost to the Big Leagues  Two teammates of Butts', Jim Gilliam and Roy Campanella, made it to the major leagues. Gilliam was not as good a player as Butts was, but he was younger. Butts' coaches thought he would make it big;; people compared him to Phil Rizzuto. One Cuban pitcher who faced Butts when he played in Puerto Rico, Dolf Luque, even said that Butts could hit better than Rizzuto.  Retirement  After Pee Wee's final season in Texas, he said he just moped around for a year. He returned home to Atlanta and played in an old timer's game in 1969. He went to visit Roy Campanella after his career ending car accident.

The purpose of the legislation was to vest the German Society of Montreal, a charitable association founded in 1835 with corporate powers to better achieve its mission. The introduction of Bill 53 (A bill to incorporate the German Society of Montreal) followed a petition (Petition 126) by Henry Meyer, Ernest Idler, J. P. Seybold, Gottlieb Reinhard, Christian Beck and David Maysenholder, being officers and members of the German Society in February 1865.  Structure  The Act, which is consistent with other incorporation acts published in that time period, consists of a preamble followed by nine articles: # Certain persons incorporated # Management of affairs # By-laws continued. # Officers # Execution of Deeds # Corporation may collect subscriptions # Allowances made by Corporation not liable to be taken in execution # Annual report # Public Act The Act permits the Society to make and amend its by-laws in any way, \\"in so far as they are not repugnant to the laws of this Province [of Canada]\\"Act, s.3  Consolidation of Statutes after Confederation  After Canadian Confederation (1867), the powers of the provincial and the federal parliaments were divided. The Commission for the Revision and Consolidation of the General Statutes of the Province of Quebec found that acts like the German Society's incorporation act fell under provincial jurisdiction and should be considered private acts. As a result of the 1888 revision of the Statutes of Quebec, the Act to incorporate the German Society of Montreal was listed in Appendix B of acts considered to be acts of private nature, and was thus not consolidated in the Revised Statutes of Quebec.  Present Situation  The German Society continues to be governed under the provisions of the Act, together with by-laws passed under it. It has not sought to migrate its incorporation to the Province's Companies Act. In the provincial statutes, there has been no mention of the Act since its entry in Volume II of the Revised Statutes of the Province of Quebec in 1888.

In addition, the law specifically authorized commemorative coins to observe the 150th anniversary of the death of Dolley Madison, to honor George Washington, the 125th anniversary of the establishment Yellowstone National Park, and the 50th anniversary of Jackie Robinson's racial desegregation of Major League Baseball. It also established commemorative coin fundraising programs for the Black Revolutionary War Patriots Memorial, Franklin Delano Roosevelt Memorial, and National Law Enforcement Officers Memorial. Title II of the act established a fund for the National Law Enforcement Officers Memorial Maintenance Fund. The goal of the fund was to maintain the memorial, add names to it as warranted, and to establish a scholarship program for family members of law enforcement officers killed in the line of duty. Title III of the act established a program to study whether a commemorative coin program should be established to honor all 50 U.S. states. Legislative history The first commemorative coin authorized by Congress was the George Washington 250th Anniversary silver half-dollar, released in 1982. By the mid-1990s, however, an ever-growing number of groups were pressing Congress to authorize more commemorative coins, even though no official mechanism for their design, minting, and sales existed within the United States Treasury. H.R. 1776 was introduced in the United States House of Representatives on June 7, 1995 by Representative Nancy Johnson (R-Connecticut). H.R. 1776 created a commemorative coin program at the U.S. Mint whose purpose was to help regulate the numerous requests for commemorative coins received by Congress each year. The legislation regulated the coin program It was referred to the House Committee on Banking and Financial Services. Two related bills were also introduced in the House. The first was the Dolley Madison Commemorative Coin Act (H.R. 1684), introduced on May 23, 1995, by Representative Thomas J. Bliley, Jr. (R-Virginia). The second was the George Washington Commemorative Coin Act (H.R. 2026), introduced on July 13, 1995, by Representative Thomas M. Davis (R-Virginia). The Johnson bill lay in committee until September 1996. The Dolley Madison and George Washington commemorative coin bills were merged into H.R. 1776 in subcommittee, and commemorative coin programs the Jackie Robinson, Yellowstone National Park, the Roosevelt Memorial, and the Law Enforcement Officers Memorial added as well. By the time the Subcommittee on Domestic and International Monetary Policy favorably forwarded the bill to the full committee, H.R. 1776 had more than 318 co-sponsors in the House. Since more than 90 percent of the members of the House supported the legislation, the bill was called for a vote on the House floor on the evening of September 17, 1996, and it passed by voice vote. H.R. 1776 was considered by the United States Senate on October 3, 1996. (There were no committee hearings.) Senator Alfonse D'Amato offered an amendment (S. Amdt. 5428) which added the Black Revolutionary War Patriots Memorial to those commemorative coin programs authorized by the bill. The Senate agreed to the amendment by unanimous consent. The amended bill then passed the Senate with unanimous consent. On October 4, the House agreed by unanimous consent to the Senate bill. President Bill Clinton signed the measure into law on October 20, 1996. About the Commemorative Coin Act Title I of the act established the Commemorative Coin Program within the United States Treasury.

Surcharges from the sale of commemorative coins raised more than $484.9 million fiscal year ending on September 30, 2010. On April 23, 2003, President George W. Bush signed into law the American 5-cent Coin Design Continuity Act (Public Law 108-15). Title II of the act amended the United States Commemorative Coin Act of 1996. Organizations receiving funds from the sale of United States Mint commemorative coins were now required to raise private additional funds equal to the amount received from the United States Treasury. Any funds not so matched would be returned to the Treasury. A recipient organization has two years from the end of the program to meet the matching funds requirement. In fiscal 2013 alone, the U.S. Mint turned over $5 million in unclaimed surcharge income to the U.S. Treasury after recipients were unable to raise the matching funds.

In North America, it has been found from Newfoundland west to Manitoba, and south as far as Georgia and Alabama. In Eurasia, it ranges from southern Norway and Sweden south to France and Italy and it also occurs in the Caucasus.Altervista Flora Italiana, Lycopodium tristachyum Pursh includes line drawing, European distribution map The name tristachyum means three branched. Description Showing distinctive annual constrictions Diphasiastrum tristachyum is a perennial species of clubmoss. It grows from creeping underground stems which are often deeply buried at 5‚Äì12 cm deep; at nodes from this stem the above ground stems emerge. The upright stems can be tall or higher. From the main stem, several fan shaped \\"leaves\\" emerge, these are not true leaves but rather branched stems which appear to almost look like leaves, each branches 4-6 times. The stems all grow to a similar height at the top of the plant, giving it a flat topped appearance which is a diagnostic character for this species. The peduncle is ~9 cm long and often branches twice near the top to form four strobili; the strobili are ~6 cm long and 3-4mm in diameter with a rounded tip. The strobili contain the sporophyll which are 2.2-3.5 X 1.6-3mm in size, light yellow, deltoid shaped, with a long sharp pointed tip, the edges are rough and chaffy; the spore case is almost round and the spores themselves are convex on their sides. The branches are 1-2.2mm wide and square with rounded angles when viewed in cross-section. The blue-green leaves are scale like, four-ranked and lanceolate to subulate. It can be distinguished from similar species by annual constrictions along these branches. Ground cedar prefers dry and sandy areas with poor soils, this allows it to grow in barrens and other xeric sites. It can tolerate sterile acidic soils which are often found within coniferous forests. Ground cedar also prefers to grow in open areas where other plants are not growing densely. Plants growing in the shade are more diffusely branched than those which grow in bright sun, but branchlets are always more rounded than those of either D. complanatum or D. digitatum.

Through investigative journalism, Epstein takes the reader through his experiences regarding what makes the difference between an amateur and a pro-athlete. The book was published in August 2013 by Penguin Books. Overview This book explores the question of nature versus nurture as it pertains to training for athletes in sports using anecdotes which favor both sides of the argument. These anecdotes are combined with the results of statistical studies to give the reader an understanding of the magnitude that biology plays in athletics. Topics such as the effects of gender, race, genetics, culture, and physical environment are discussed as contributors to success in specific sports. The chapters are: # In Search of Sports Genes # Beat by an Underhand Girl: The Gene-Free Model of Expertise # A Tale of Two High Jumpers (Or: 10,000 Hours Plus or Minus 10,000 Hours) # Major League Vision and the Greatest Child Athlete Sample Ever: The Hard and Software Paradigm # Why Men Have Nipples # The Talent of Trainability # Superbaby, Bully Whippets, and the Trainability of Muscle # The Big Bang of Body Types # The Vitruvian NBA Player # We Are All Black (Sort Of): Race and Genetic Diversity # The Warrior-Slave Theory of Jamaican Sprinting # Malaria and Muscle Fibers # Can Every Kalenjin Run? # The World's Greatest Accidental (Altitudinous) Talent Sieve # Sled Dogs, Ultrarunners, and Couch Potato Genes # The Heartbreak Gene: Death, Injury, and Pain on the Field # The Gold Medal Mutation # Epilogue: The Perfect Athlete =Race and sport= Epstein explores racial differences in sports performance and examines both nature and nurture arguments for why certain populations (such as Jamaicans and Kalenjin) are overrepresented among top performers in the 100 meters sprint and marathons respectively. Epstein examines the argument that Kalenjin tend to have a body type conducive to distance running in part due to Allen's Rule. He also explores the contribution of growing up and training at altitude, as well as the phenomenon of running to and from school. In the course of his research, Epstein followed geneticist Yannis Pitsiladis to Jamaica, where he explored folklore that Jamaican sprinters descend from a warrior class of maroons. Pitsiladis analyzes DNA in Jamaica, and finds no special signature that links maroons and sprinters, and concludes that the genetic evidence does not support the island folklore. Rather, both Epstein and Pitsiladis place considerable emphasis on the popularity of the national high school track and field championships as part of the Jamaican sprint dynasty. In chapter 10 of the book, Epstein discusses problems with classifying athletes as simply \\"black,\\" as he notes that there is more genetic diversity within Africa than in all of the rest of the world combined. He refers to work on global genetic diversity and migration from Yale's Kidd Lab to emphasize the point. He also notes that genetic diversity does not break down into discrete races in the way that people often assume. Reception The book received positive reviews from The New York Times, Science, Nature, and The Guardian. Deleted chapter In August 2013, on the website io9, Epstein published what was called a \\"deleted chapter\\" from the book on epigenetics.

During the First World War he became an ace, shooting down five German aircraft, before returning to England to work as a flying instructor and test pilot. He was killed in July 1918, when an experimental aircraft he was flying crashed in France. Early career Gordon Bell was awarded Aviator's Certificate #100 by the Royal Aero Club in 1911, making him one of the earliest qualified pilots in the country.Flight 8 July 1911 As with many early aviators, he had learned at the Brooklands flying school.Flight 1 Aug. 1918 He then moved to France, where he worked for Robert Esnault- Pelterie's aircraft firm R.E.P.; while demonstrating one of their aircraft to potential buyers in Turkey, he became the first person to fly across the Sea of Marmara. Over the following years, he became famous in flying circles, and was considered one of the most skilled pilots in the country. By 1914, he had flown over sixty different models of aircraft. However, his reputation had been damaged by a fatal accident at Brooklands in 1913, where Gordon Bell's aircraft crashed whilst flying low over the airfield.

Founded in the late 18th century, the farm is noted for innovations in dairy farming practices introduced in the 1920s by Maurice Downs. It is also one of a small number of surviving farm properties in the town, and was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 2002. Description and history Spring Hill Farm is located in a rural setting in southeastern Lebanon, on bounded at its southern and western sides by Meriden Road and Laplante Road. The farm complex is located near the road junction, containing a main house, barn, and other smaller outbuildings. The main house is a -story brick structure built c. 1799, and a barn constructed c. 1929 but incorporating an early 19th-century structure, as well as lumber salvaged from other period barns. Only the lands immediately north and east of the complex are open fields; the balance of the property is wooded. When Maurice Downes, a native of Wilmot, New Hampshire, purchased this property in 1913, it included the house and three 19th-century English barns. Downes was educated in agricultural practices at the University of New Hampshire, and introduced the high-producing Holstein cow to the area for dairy production; it is now the dominant milk-producing breed in the region. In the 1920s he adapted one of the barns to house all of the dairying operations under one roof, enlarging it by using materials recycled by disassembling the other two barns. His structure included a concrete floor, and a trolley-based mechanism for removing manure to an exterior manure shed, all innovative developments in the area.

He is also an author, public speaker and public health advocate. In 2013 O'Sullivan was declared Nga Toa Whakaihuwaka (Supreme MƒÅori of the year), and in 2014 he was declared New Zealander of the Year 2014 for bringing health programmes to disadvantaged in rural areas. Early life and education O'Sullivan grew up in the Auckland suburb of Howick and was raised by his single Pakeha mother after she left his alcoholic and violent father. His sister, Nikki, is three years older. He attended school at Pakuranga College and Timaru Boys' High School. Each school expelled him before his mother sent him to Hato Petera College as a boarder. O'Sullivan completed his high school education as dux, head boy, sports champ and a kapa haka star. After graduating from Hato Petera College he spent 2 years working for Customs after dropping out of a science degree programme and becoming a father. At the age of 21 he was accepted into Auckland Medical School on a MƒÅori preferential admission scheme. O'Sullivan graduated from Auckland Medical School in 2001. Career and health programmes After graduating from medical school, O'Sullivan went to work in the Bay of Plenty where doctors working in isolated and deprived places like Murupara and Kaingaroa influenced him. After five years in the Bay of Plenty, he was offered a job by a Kaitaia MƒÅori health provider and returned \\"home\\" to his iwi affiliations, namely Te Rarawa, through his grandmother from Pukepoto. In 2012 O'Sullivan had a public falling out with his employer after a difference of opinion over how to deal with patients who couldn't afford to pay for medical treatment. With his wife Tracy, he set up a company Navilluso Medical, which set up the MOKO foundation in 2013. The MOKO foundation started a number of healthcare initiatives.. In March 2018 O'Sullivan announced that he was moving his business to Auckland, citing the difficulties of growing such a business in a rural area. =Te Kohanga Whakaora= On 19 November 2012 O'Sullivan and his wife, Tracy, set up the low-cost health clinic \\"Te Kohanga Whakaora\\" (The Nest of Wellness). The clinic was based in the Kaitaia Hospital. The aim was to make basic healthcare accessible for people in the Far North who were unable to afford it. The clinic had emergency prescription funds donated from New Zealanders around the country. =Manawa Ora Korokoro Ora= In October 2012 O'Sullivan started the MOKO programme (\\"Manawa Ora Korokoro Ora\\" healthy heart, healthy throat), Northland's first full-time, school-based health clinic providing medical care to 2000 children within a 25 km radius of Kaitaia. Health Ministry provided support with additional funding from the charity KidsCan.. The program focuses primarily on preventing rheumatic fever by taking a throat swab from every child with a sore throat. The programme also provides basic medical care for nits, skin and chest infections with nurses and health workers visiting each primary and intermediate school three times a week. There are also two GP sessions each week to take care of more complex cases. =Kainga Ora= The \\"Kainga Ora (Well Home)\\" initiative promotes the idea that wellness begins in safe, warm homes. The initiative commenced in 2012 when O'Sullivan drove around Kaitaia and called in to some of the most rundown looking houses. He found families living with children who were sick due to the condition of their homes. He recruited labour and donated materials to help repair the homes. =iMOKO= iMOKO started in 2014 as an extension the vMOKO programme. Trained nurses and health workers collected data including photographs and forward it to O'Sullivan's practice in Kaitaia. Photographs were taken as required and O'Sullivan provided a diagnosis or passed the data on for a higher-level diagnosis. iMOKO also provides the capability to send required prescriptions to a nearby pharmacy for collection. The programme saves families long trips to the clinic at Kaitaia, runs efficiently, and can detect disease in the early stages. By November 2016, 4000 children in approximately 35 early childhood centres, K≈çhanga Reo, primary, intermediate and secondary schools participated in this healthcare model. =MaiHealth= In 2017, two virtual health clinics were opened: the first in the doctor-less town of Patea; the second in Kaitaia. The clinics enable patients to attend and access healthcare under the iMOKO model with the assistance of trained healthcare workers. In November 2017 the Accident Compensation Corporation and the Ministry of Health announced they would provide O'Sullivan's company, Navilluso Medical, $NZ1.4 million over two years to develop its MaiHealth model =Coronavirus pandemic= During the COVID-19 Pandemic he publicly criticised the residents of Kaitaia for breaching the lockdown conditions, only to admit later on 22/4/2020 that he had breached the level 4 lockdown by going kayaking. Advocacy On 23 May 2017, O'Sullivan disrupted a screening of the anti- vaccine propaganda film Vaxxed in Kaitaia, and criticised the movie before performing the Haka. He addressed the audience, saying that: His action was supported by the Health Minister at the time, Jonathan Coleman. O'Sullivan featured in a video supporting the End of Life Choice Bill which had passed the first reading in the New Zealand Parliament in December 2017. Politics O'Sullivan plans to enter politics in 2020. He considers himself apolitical and will seek the best way to achieve the social change he sees necessary. O'Sullivan has made no decision on which party he will choose; he has been in talks with The Opportunities Party about their leadership, and approached by the National Party, but is considering all parties. He was a supporter of the MƒÅori Party and had intended to seek its leadership, however he wanted to be the sole leader and abandon the party's co-leadership model.

Hancock was born in Chippenham to Jacob Hancock (1845-1913), a cloth weaver, and his second wife Mary (nee Harding, subsequently Pepler, c1859-1910), also a cloth weaver. Although widely reported to have thirteen siblings, Florence was one of at least 20 children - both parents had previously been widowed, with children from those relationships. She was the second child of Jacob and Mary, the others being Walter Hancock (1890-1914), Wilfrid Hancock (1895‚Äì96), Wilfred George Hancock (1896-1962), Lily Mabel Hancock (1898-1979), Ernest Edwin Hancock (1899-1953), and William John Hancock (born and died 1902). In addition, members of Jacob's earlier family - William (1866‚Äì99), Joseph (1868-1943/9), Albert (1870-1952), Charles (1873-c1940), Martha (1875‚Äì78) and Mary (1876-1944) - also lived with the family, as did some of Mary's older children from her marriage to Frederick Pepler - Thomas (b&d; 1878), Rosa Augusta (1879‚Äì80), Rose (1881-?), Laura (1882-1973), Frederick (1884-1915), Florence (1885‚Äì86) and Herbert James Vincent (1887-1952). Two of her brothers - Walter and Frederick - were killed on active service in the early years of the First World War. It is reported that her interest in unions and workers rights was sparked by her father, who took her to see an address by David Lloyd George, future prime minister of the UK, when she was around the age of 10. Her official biographies report that Hancock cared for her younger siblings in her youth, as she was orphaned before turning eighteen. However, while her mother died when she was seventeen, and as the oldest girl the role of keeping the house fell to her and her half-sister Laura (who lived with the family at the time), she did not lose her father until the age of twenty. She started work in Chippenham's Waverley cafe, in the market place, at the age of twelve, then, two years later, took a job for Nestl√© in a factory making condensed milk. Her half- brother Joseph also worked in the same factory. In 1913, she was a founding member of a branch of the Workers' Union at the factory, and when the sacking of two other founders led to a strike, she took a prominent role.\\"Hancock, Dame Florence May\\", Oxford Dictionary of National Biography Hancock joined the Independent Labour Party in 1915, and was also very active in the Labour Party, supporting Charles Duncan's campaigns in Clay Cross. In the 1920s she was chair and secretary for the Gloucester Independent Labour Party. She became a full-time district organiser for the Workers' Union in 1917, and continued as an organiser as the Workers' Union became the Transport and General Workers Union (TGWU). She also became involved in the campaign for the Trades Union Congress (TUC) to create a women's section. When it did so, she moved to Bristol and served on the committee, and then from 1935 on the General Council of the TUC. The TUC appointed her as their delegate to the International Labour Organization, and she served as the Chief Women's Officer of the TGWU from 1942, moving to London to do so. In 1947/8, she served as President of the TUC, and she served on several government committees. Awards In 1942, Hancock was awarded the OBE, followed in 1947 by the CBE, and in 1951 a KBE. In later life, she served as a Governor of the BBC, a director of the Daily Herald and Remploy, and as governor of Hillcroft College. Marriage Hancock married John Donovan in 1964, a colleague from the TGWU. Although the couple lived in Bristol, where Hancock had spent much of her single life, she died in Chippenham in 1974, while visiting one of her sisters.

Built about 1848, it carried the Boston and Maine Railroad's former Northern Line. It is one of a small number of 19th-century stone arch bridges in the state, and the only one known in central western New Hampshire. The bridge was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1985. The railroad right-of-way has been functionally abandoned, and the bridge may become part of a continuation of the Northern Rail Trail. Description and history The Stone Arch Underpass is located in western Lebanon, on Glen Road, a rural-industrial route paralleling the Mascoma River, which flows to its south. The river is also roughly paralleled by the former right-of-way of the railroad. The underpass is an architecturally distinctive and unusual construction, oriented in a roughly east‚Äìwest orientation. The arch of the bridge is high, wide, and deep. The bridge is faced with roughly cut granite blocks of irregular size, with voussoir stones wide and high forming the arch. Modern metal tie rods have been added to the arch, and the bridge is capped in concrete, which provides the foundation for the rail bed. The total length of the bridge is about . The arch is narrow enough that there is room for only a single lane of traffic. The Northern Railroad was incorporated in 1844, and began service in 1848 between Concord, New Hampshire and White River Junction, Vermont. This underpass was built as part of the construction of that service. While no detailed records indicate who designed it, it may have been the work of the railroad's chief engineer, H. R. Campbell.

Early life and career  Joyner grew up in San Mateo, California, and spent some time in Medford, Oregon, after his family moved there. He was always interested in art and attended the Academy of Art University in San Francisco. He began working as a commercial illustrator in 1984 and created the cover art for several video games, such as Tales of the Unknown, Volume I: The Bard's Tale, Realm of Impossibility, and Archon II: Adept.  Robots and donuts  In 1999, he chose to focus only on topics that he likes. He started painting with four different elements: Mexican masks, San Francisco city life, old newspaper cartoons and Japanese robots. He found that the robots were the most popular feature with his friends. He had been collecting toy robots for about 20 years and wanted to bring them to life. In 2002, he felt that he needed another element to work off of. Inspired by the film Pleasantville, in which Jeff Daniels paints donuts, Joyner added donuts. The donuts have been featured as both objects of desire and adversaries to the robots. Sales and reach Joyner paints approximately 20 paintings a year with his original works selling from anywhere from $3000 a piece to $75,000. George Lucas is one of his most famous buyers. Several of his paintings are used as set pieces in the TV show The Big Bang Theory. An adaptation of his 2007 work \\"The Collator\\", \\"Submerged\\", is featured on the album cover for the Ben Folds Five album The Sound of the Life of the Mind. His painting \\"Malfunction\\" is used on the cover of Robot Law, a scholarly volume on robotics law and policy edited by Ryan Calo, A. Michael Froomkin, and Ian Kerr.

Background and release  About the release of the EP, Kitty said: \\"I exist in the real world now. It's going to be nice because people won't be able to just say that I'm a meme anymore.\\" The title of the EP is a reference to the song \\"\\"D.A.I.S.Y. Age\\" from the De La Soul album 3 Feet High and Rising (1989).  Composition  D.A.I.S.Y. Rage is a cloud rap EP. The EP's lyrical themes have been described as \\"teenage girl problems\\". \\"Dead Island\\" uses the \\"dancehall\\" beat from \\"Pon De Floor\\" by Major Lazer. Critical reception D.A.I.S.Y. Rage received generally positive reviews from music critics. At Metacritic, which assigns a weighted mean rating out of 100 to reviews from mainstream critics, the album received an average score of 78, based on five reviews, which indicates \\"generally favorable reviews\\". Jon Hadusek of Consequence of Sound described Kitty's rhyme schemes as \\"bizarre\\", and the beats as \\"simple and unobtrusive.\\" In his opinion, the three last tracks of the extended play (\\"Scout Finch Bitch\\", \\"R.R.E.A.M.\\", and \\"Hittin Lixxx\\") were weaker than the other tracks because Kitty seemed to be \\"playing it safe\\", writing them. Richard Petty of No Ripcord described the opening track of the extended play as \\"Balam Acab-like aqueous soundscapes\\", combined with \\"whimsical Disney reminiscent samples\\". Petty called \\"Dead Island\\" the highlight of the EP, complimenting the \\"blissful and hazy production, backed by the propulsive dancehall beats of Major Lazer‚Äôs Pon De Floor\\". He criticized Antwon's guest appearance, saying \\"his relatively gruff voice [contrasts] harshly with Kitty‚Äôs hushed vocals and [provides] something of a shock to the system over sliced up DSOTM-era Pink Floyd samples\\". Petty called \\"R.R.E.A.M.\\", \\"a pastiche of the Wu Tang classic\\", the hardest song to listen to because of the \\"glitchy synths\\" which \\"[seemed] to [be recreating] motion sickness\\" but complimented Kitty's \\"[clever] mining [of] her innocent and relatively youthful age for comedic effect\\", singing about antihistamines for their intended use instead of recreational use with codeine. Carrie Battan of Pitchfork noted that D.A.I.S.Y. Rage \\"[feeds] on warm, sparkly beats and topical rap nerdery asserted with a defiantly Disney Channel attitude\\", just like Kitty's previous EP, Haha, I'm Sorry (2012). Battan compared Kitty's additude in the song \\"$krillionaire\\" to that of Holden Caulfield from J. D. Salinger's The Catcher in the Rye (1951), citing the line \\"I hate everyone that wants to be a millionaire / So freakin' bad / So freakin' bad\\" as an example. She also pointed out that the song \\"No Offense!!!!!\\" might be about Kitty's friend, Danny Brown\\", citing the line \\"You're about as fraudulent as a mirage out in the desert / Blue peacock / You're puffing out your feathers / To bring a bunch of bitches backstage into your dressing room / So you could treat it like a petting zoo\\" as support of that suggestion. Battan also described Kitty's voice as \\"still saccharine, her tone precious to the point of sounding infantile\\".

He was noted for his membership in the initial pioneer company, and later for acting as Captain of the First Handcart company of Mormon Pioneers during their emigration from Liverpool, England to the Salt Lake Valley in 1856. Note: most of the information in this article comes from Edmund Ellsworth's autobiography first published in 1956.http://www.public.asu.edu/~ellswork/EdmundsBiography.htm Birth and early history Edmund was born near Paris, Oneida County, New York, but knew little of his Ellsworth family heritage, except the report that his paternal grandfather had fought under General George Washington in several battles. Somewhere around the time of his birth, his father's death was reported by an uncle due to \\"the yellow fever\\" while working on the St. Lawrence waterway. That uncle also dispossessed Edmund's mother and her two children. Edmund also recorded in his autobiography that his mother's subsequent remarriages did not create a very desirable living situation. Nauvoo period, 1840-1846 Around the age of 19 or 20, Edmund journeyed down the Mississippi River and upon hearing that his mother had joined the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter Day Saints, Edmund decided to \\"save his mother from this delusion\\". He was later baptized with his sister Charlotte and her husband in February 1841, arriving in Nauvoo, Illinois in October of that year. Following his arrival, he worked at the quarry where stone for the Nauvoo Temple was being cut. A journal entry from his son indicates that in 1860 \\"my father resigned his command of the 2nd Battalion of the Nauvoo Legion\\",Ellsworth, German E., and Mary Smith Ellsworth. _Our Ellsworth Ancestry, pg.128_. Salt Lake City: Utah Printing, 1956. meaning that Edmund was a commissioned officer, a facet of Edmund's life in Nauvoo about which not much has been recorded. The following year, Edmund married Elizabeth Young, the oldest daughter of Brigham Young and Miriam Works. He later referred to Brigham as \\"Father\\", having never known his own father while growing up. During the Nauvoo period, Edmund worked at a sawmill, did odd jobs, and participated in electioneering for Joseph Smith's 1844 campaignJoseph Smith#CITEREFQuinn1994 for the US Presidency States until he was called home following the assassination of Joseph Smith Jr. and Hyrum Smith at Carthage, Illinois on June 27, 1844. He also reported seeing the visage of the Prophet Joseph Smith after Smith's death upon Brigham Young at a time when church leadership was in question, along with \\"most of the congregation\\". First migration to Utah, 1846-1847 In February 1846, most of the Latter Day Saints living in Nauvoo, Illinois began migrating by wagon train towards \\"the West\\" where they believed that they would be allowed to worship and peace, outside the boundaries of the United States of America as they existed at that time. Edmund made smaller trips back and forth on behalf of Brigham Young to obtain needed items, and also participated in cutting hay, hunting for needed meat, participation in Pitt's Brass Band. As part of the Vanguard company he and operated a ferry near Fort Laramie, Wyoming made by constructing three large hewn-out canoes and framing them together. Although he did not arrive on July 24, with the first pioneer company, Brigham Young promised the ten men who stayed behind to run the ferry that they would share in the honors for the Pioneer's Vanguard Company,http://www.mendonutah.net/1847_vanguard_company.htm and as such his name is included with others at the This is the Place Monument in Salt Lake City, Utah. Edmund and his family arrived in the Salt Lake Valley on 12 October 1847. Mission to England, 1854-1856 Edmund was appointed to act as a missionary in 1854, along with Franklin D. Richards who was one of the LDS Apostles, and eight others. He continued to serve in leadership throughout the areas of service, until such time as he was instructed in the winter of 1855-1856 to act as the Captain of the First Handcart Company, made primarily up of new members emigrating from England to the Salt Lake area. The group first traveled by ship across the Atlantic, and riverboat to Iowa City, Iowa. Edmund was a logical choice for this leadership position, given his prior pioneering experience from the vanguard company in 1846-1847, carpentry, and hunting skills, etc. Handcart Company leader, 1856 The First Handcart Company departed from Iowa City, Iowa on June 9, 1856 arriving in Salt Lake City, Utah on September 26, 1856. The company had about 280 different people, 3 wagons, and 56 handcarts. The experience of the first company was useful in that due to the green timber, the wheels and axles broke more frequently than expected, and that by tinning the axles and adding iron to the rims, the carts made much better mileage and broke much less frequently. Coupled with axle greasing, these innovations were incorporated into carts travelling in the years 1857-1860. Family tradition is that he passed by his own house and tipped his hat to his family while seeing to the settlement of the handcart pioneers before returning home. Note that by comparison to two of the last two Handcart Companies in 1856, their passage was relatively successful with few deaths along the trail. Later years in Utah and Idaho, 1856-1880 Following the settlement of the handcart pioneers, Edmund lived with his families in the Salt Lake County and Weber County areas until 1880, serving in a variety of ecclesiastical and \\"small government\\" positions, including the obtaining and driving the pilings for several bridges and superintending the construction of pilings for roads south from the Ogden area towards Salt Lake City, and North to an area called the Hot Springs. Polygamy and Arizona arrest In early LDS church history, a number of men participated in church-sanctioned polygamy, including Edmund Ellsworth, who had a total of four wives. Elizabeth Young (m.1842), Mary Ann Dudley (m.1852), Mary Ann Bates (m.1856), and Mary Ann Jones (m. 1856). The latter two \\"Mary Anns\\" were both members of the First Handcart Company. He settled with two of the families, intending to bring the other families later, to Show Low, Apache County, Arizona. He was arrested for co-habitation in 1884,http://www.findagrave.com/cgi- bin/fg.cgi?page=gr&GSln;=Ellsworth&GSiman;=1&GScid;=2202004&GRid;=17294964& close to the age of 65, and sentenced to a fine of $300 which he did not have, or sixty days in jail. Edmund chose not to pay as he did not have the money and also because paying the fine would have forced the starvation of his families. After transport to the Yuma Territorial Prison, Edmund and other served their sentences through the heat of much of the summer, reaching Show Low on 10 August 1885. While the heat had nearly killed him while in prison, he also reported that it had \\"sweat the heart disease out of him\\", and that his health was greatly improved. Last years He later moved with one family to the then predominantly LDS area incorporated in 1883 as Mesa, Arizona, where Mary Ann (Bates) Ellsworthhttp://www.findagrave.com/cgi- bin/fg.cgi?page=gr&GSln;=ellsworth&GSiman;=1&GSsr;=41&GScid;=2171898&GRid;=20104095& is buried, and lived there just prior to his death. He also attended the dedication of the Salt Lake Temple in 1893, and died on 29 December 1893 after six weeks of illness, the result of heart failure. Legacy Because of the large families, Edmund Lovell Ellsworth's impact on LDS history in the west and especially with family groups in Idaho, Northern Utah, and Arizona, is hard to measure. Edmund's son Edmund III was later part of the settlement near the Moapa River what is now Clark County, Nevada, and many other Ellsworth descendants have served both church and country in both World Wars. At a family reunion held in 1986, family historians stated that Edmund's families had nearly 5,000 living descendants, a number that has likely tripled or quadrupled since that time. Most are members of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints (LDS Church).

It is an installment in the RollerCoaster Tycoon series, the second to be released for mobile devices, after Frontier Games made a port of RollerCoaster Tycoon 3 for iOS. The original creator of the series, Chris Sawyer, had no involvement with the development. The game was initially released as payware, but has since become free-to-play. Gameplay The person playing, the \\"Tycoon\\", is able to build and maintain rides such as carousels, bumper cars, roller coasters and a ferris wheel. The Tycoon is able to build food stands that sell ice cream, pizza, hot dogs, etc. to earn money for future builds. The ticketing booth, along with regular restaurants, a daycare center, and souvenir shop, among others, also provide money. Rollercoasters can be either custom built or pre- built, made of wood, steel, titanium, or carbon and edit it later. The Tycoon must constantly add and maintain attractions to attract Peeps, the game's consumers. As rides break down, Peeps start to leave and the parks' Buzz level, the percentage of people that love the park, goes down. Repairing rides raises the Buzz level and Peeps return. Earning money and completing quests earn the Tycoon experience, money and/or tickets, rare tokens used for the same purposes as regular coins. Every time a quest is completed, a new quest comes up with a different reward. Leveling up earns money and tickets and unlocks new attractions. On 9 January 2016, two new coasters in which are hanging and bobsled were added along with the option to create new parks and build a big empire. People could also take part in a campaign mode similar to those of earlier games. Reception On Metacritic, it has a score of 35 out of 100, from 13 critic reviews, indicating \\"generally unfavorable reviews\\". The game was criticised because of its micro-transactions, excessive wait timers and features removed from previous RollerCoaster Tycoon games. Chris Schilling for Eurogamer also criticised the music, calling it \\"irredeemably bad\\", giving the game a score of 1 out of 10.

When the Germans took over control over Sand≈æak in 1943, Paƒçariz was appointed as the commander of the SS Polizei-Selbstschutz-Regiment Sandschak. Forces under his command were referred to as Paƒçarizovci (belonging to Paƒçariz). He allegedly led his forces while riding a black horse. During the final days of World War II in 1945, Paƒçariz was captured, put on trial, and was found guilty for massacres of civilians and subsequently was executed as a war criminal as a result.  Early life  Paƒçariz was born in the village of Bioƒça, near Berane in 1900. His father was a local hod≈æa (khawaja). In 1912, during the First Balkan War, his village was set ablaze by the Army of Montenegro, from which his family fled first to Lozna near Bijelo Polje, and then to Brodarevo where his father became the local imam. In 1922, the Chetniks killed his father because he supported the local outlaw Jusuf Mehonjiƒá. Until that time, Sulejman was a member of the Yugoslav gendarmerie. After the murder of his father, Sulejman joined the outlaws of Mehonjiƒá for a short time and returned to the gendarmerie. Before 1930, he accepted the position of imam in Hisard≈æik, and in 1938, he would accept the position of military imam in the city of Bar.–ú–∏–ª—É—Ç–∏–Ω –ñ–∏–≤–∫–æ–≤–∏—õ - –ù–î–• –£ –°–†–ë–ò–à–ò –£—Å—Ç–∞—à–∫–∏ —Ä–µ–∂–∏–º —É –ü—Ä–∏–±–æ—ò—É, –ü—Ä–∏—ò–µ–ø–æ—ô—É, –ù–æ–≤–æ—ò –í–∞—Ä–æ—à–∏ –∏ –°—ò–µ–Ω–∏—Ü–∏(–∞–ø—Ä–∏–ª‚Äì—Å–µ–ø—Ç–µ–º–±–∞—Ä 1941, –ü–æ—Å–ª–µ–¥–∏—Ü–µ —É—Å—Ç–∞—à–∫–µ —É–ø—Ä–∞–≤–µ –ù–î–• –∏ —Ä–µ—Ü–∏–¥–∏–≤–∏ —ö–µ–Ω–µ –ø–æ–ª–∏—Ç–∏–∫–µ –ø—Ä–µ–º–∞ –º—É—Å–ª–∏–º–∞–Ω–∏–º–∞, Publishers: –î–†–£–®–¢–í–û –ò–°–¢–û–†–ò–ß–ê–†–ê –°–†–ë–ò–à–ï ‚Äû–°–¢–û–à–ê–ù –ù–û–í–ê–ö–û–í–ò–ã‚Äú, –ò–ù–°–¢–ò–¢–£–¢ –ó–ê –°–†–ü–°–ö–£ –ö–£–õ–¢–£–†–£ –ü–†–ò–®–¢–ò–ù–ê- –õ–ï–ü–û–°–ê–í–ò–ã, Belgrade 2017 p.290  World War II  A song and drawing from \\"Osvit\\" magazine, published in Sarajevo during World War II = Within Usta≈°e = At the beginning of the Yugoslav theatre of World War II, the Usta≈°e occupied the region of Sand≈æak and appointed Paƒçariz, together with some other prominent Muslims from Sand≈æak, as military officers of the Sand≈æak Muslim militia. They were initially given the ranks of Major and primarily engaged the royalist Chetniks within the region and outside of Sand≈æak. By September of 1941, the Usta≈°e handed control over Sand≈æak to the Italians. = Within forces of Italy = At the end of the autumn season, Montenegrin communists attempted to negotiate with Paƒçariz but failed to convince him and his subordinates to join the Yugoslav Partisans. Afterwards, Paƒçariz mobilized Muslims who lived in Prijepolje on the right bank of the Lim river, and in the former municipalities of Velika ≈Ωupa and Selja≈°nica to be armed in case of any offensives made by the Chetniks or the Partisans. He received arms and military equipment from the Usta≈°e and later from the Italians.

The militiamen refused to surrender their arms, and a skirmish ensued, in which two of them were killed while one Chetnik was wounded. Motivated to avenge the death of his two men, the militia attacked the part of Kosatica that was populated by Serbs, then capture, brutally torture and kill seven Serbs from Kosatica after the battle.  Battle of Sjenica  On the 22nd of December 1941, forces of the Muslim militia from Hisard≈æik and Sjenica, commanded by Paƒçariz, were successful in repelling the attack from the Partisans who attempted to capture Sjenica. In this battle, 18 Partisans were captured. Paƒçariz occasionally visited them in Sjenica's prison. In February 1942, Paƒçariz engaged the Italian forces in Prijepolje that attempted to carve a path to Sjenica and escort 18 Partisans who were captured the following battle. The Italians intended to exchange captured Partisans for captured Italians. He escorted 13 Partisans to Prijepolje, leaving 5 wounded Partisans in Sjenica. All the Partisans that Paƒçariz brought to the Italians were killed in the Puriƒáa stream, below Srijete≈æ. Paƒçariz later established the so called flying platoon of his most loyal men. He used it to forcefully mobilize people and to force wealthier Muslims to buy arms from him. Those who opposed to him were brutally beaten and terrorized, and sometimes killed. Together with other commanders of Muslim militia (including Husein Rovƒçanin), he participated in a conference in village of Godijeva, and agreed to attack Serb villages near Sjenica and other parts of Sand≈æak. = Within forces of Germany = Following his appointment to the post of H√∂here SS-und Polizeif√ºhrer Sandschak (Higher SS and Police Leader Sanjak) in September 1943, Karl von Krempler came to be known as the \\"Prince of Sand≈æak\\" after his relatively successful formation of the SS Polizei-Selbstschutz- Regiment Sandschak. He went to the Sand≈æak region in October and then took over command of around 5,000 militiamen of the Sand≈æak Muslim militia, headquartered in Sjenica. This formation was sometimes thereafter called the Kampfgruppe Krempler (Krempler's guerrillas) or more derisively the \\"Muselmanengruppe von Krempler (Krempler's muslim guerrillas)\\". As the senior Waffen SS officer, Karl von Krempler appointed Paƒçariz as the formal commander of the unit, but as the key military trainer and contact person with German arms and munitions, remained effectively in control.\\"The Moslem Militia and Legion of the Sandjak\\" in Axis Europa Magazine, Vol. II/III (No. 9), July‚ÄìAugust‚ÄìSeptember 1996, pp.3-14.

She served primarily as a convoy escort in the Battle of the Atlantic. She was named for St. Marys, Ontario, however there was already a ship by that name within the Commonwealth navies so they chose the nickname of the town for its representation. After the war she was re-purposed as a weather ship for use by the Department of Transport of Canada. Stone Town was ordered 1 February 1943 as part of the 1943‚Äì1944 River-class building program. She was laid down on 17 November 1943 by Canadian Vickers Ltd. at Montreal, Quebec and launched 28 March 1944. She was commissioned into the Royal Canadian Navy on 21 July 1944 at Montreal. Background The River-class frigate was designed by William Reed of Smith's Dock Company of South Bank-on-Tees. Originally called a \\"twin-screw corvette\\", its purpose was to improve on the convoy escort classes in service with the Royal Navy at the time, including the Flower-class corvette. The first orders were placed by the Royal Navy in 1940 and the vessels were named for rivers in the United Kingdom, giving name to the class. In Canada they were named for towns and cities though they kept the same designation. The name \\"frigate\\" was suggested by Vice-Admiral Percy Nelles of the Royal Canadian Navy and was adopted later that year. Improvements over the corvette design included improved accommodation which was markedly better. The twin engines gave only three more knots of speed but extended the range of the ship to nearly double that of a corvette at at 12 knots. Among other lessons applied to the design was an armament package better designed to combat U-boats including a twin 4-inch mount forward and 12-pounder aft. 15 Canadian frigates were initially fitted with a single 4-inch gun forward but with the exception of , they were all eventually upgraded to the double mount. For underwater targets, the River-class frigate was equipped with a Hedgehog anti-submarine mortar and depth charge rails aft and four side-mounted throwers. River-class frigates were the first Royal Canadian Navy warships to carry the 147B Sword horizontal fan echo sonar transmitter in addition to the irregular ASDIC. This allowed the ship to maintain contact with targets even while firing unless a target was struck. Improved radar and direction-finding equipment improved the Royal Canadian Navy's ability to find and track enemy submarines over the previous classes. Canada originally ordered the construction of 33 frigates in October 1941. The design was too big for the shipyards on the Great Lakes so all the frigates built in Canada were built in dockyards along the west coast or along the St. Lawrence River. In all Canada ordered the construction of 60 frigates including ten for the Royal Navy that transferred two to the United States Navy. War service Beginning in September 1944, Stone Town performed workups in Bermuda. Upon her return she was assigned to the Mid-Ocean Escort Force group C-8 as a trans-Atlantic convoy escort. She was named Senior Officer's Ship and remained with the group crossing the Atlantic until May 1945, returning to Canada that month. On 22 July 1945 Stone Town began a tropicalization refit at Lunenburg in preparation for service in the southern Pacific Ocean. This meant installing water-cooling and refrigeration abilities and changing the camouflage pattern. However, work was stopped on 24 August due to the surrender of Japan. Stone Town was paid off on 13 November 1945 at Lunenburg and laid up for disposal at Shelburne. Postwar service In 1950 Canada became responsible for operating weather ship P (Peter) in the Northern Pacific Ocean. As a result, the Government of Canada re-acquired Stone Town and her sister ship and sent them for conversion to weather ships at Sorel, Quebec.Macpherson states that Stone Towns conversion was done in Halifax. They were repainted with black hulls and white superstructures and buff funnels with black tops, and sent out to the position of weather ship P as CGS St. Catharines and CGS Stone Town respectively. Once at that position they were to provide positional information for long range, propeller flights over the Pacific and weather forecasting and measurement of winds aloft. In 1962, she was transferred to the newly formed Canadian Coast Guard and repainted in their colours. She remained at this post until 1967 when she was relieved by CGS Quadra. She was sold in 1968, supposedly for conversion to a fishing vessel. Her ship's bell was given to St. Marys, Ontario and is currently on display at the St. Marys Museum.

As an artist, he uses a wide range of media to communicate his concepts to the public ‚Äî‚Äì from painting to graphic art, from installations to conceptual photography and digital art. Biography Georgy's ancestors were German ‚Äì hence the surname, but due to his Russian origin, it has been often erroneously anglicized just as Kizevalter or Kisevalter. He graduated from Moscow Lenin Pedagogical Institute in 1977. In 1976-89, he was one of the original members of the Russian conceptual performance group Collective Actions. In the mid 1970s ‚Äì 1980s, he was very close to the circle of artists like Ilya Kabakov, Viktor Pivovarov, Erik Bulatov, Ivan Chuikov et al., and actively participated in such unofficial artistic formations of the time as the AptArt movement, the Moscow Archive of New Art (MANI), and the Avantgardists' Club in Moscow. In 1996, he decided to move to Canada, but returned to Russia at the end of 2006. In the early 1990s, Kiesewalter arranged a number of broadcasts on arts and culture issues on Radio Liberty in Munich, Germany. He is also the author or co-author of several books and many articles on contemporary art and photography published in Russia. In 1997, he received an Open Society Institute grant to help publish his first book about Moscow's unofficial artists, The Communal Body of Moscow. His works can be found in many private and institutional collections, including the Tretyakov Gallery (Moscow), the Jane Voorhees Zimmerli Art Museum at Rutgers, the State University of New Jersey, and the Duke University Museum of Art (USA), Kunstmuseum in Bern, Switzerland, Centre Georges Pompidou, Paris; the National Centre for Contemporary Arts, the Moscow Museum of Modern Art, Garage Museum of Contemporary Art and Ekaterina Cultural Foundation (all in Moscow), the Kolodzei Art Foundation (New Jersey ‚Äì Moscow), and many others.

This allows the rifle to comply with parts of California's firearms laws. The name came about in relation to a 1999 California law which said that a \\"bullet or ammunition cartridge is considered a tool.\\" The 2012 court case Haynie v Pleasanton validated that a bullet button is legal and rifles that have one installed are not considered assault weapons. In 2016, California law was changed to prohibit the sales of firearms with bullet buttons. History After certain rifles with detachable magazines and certain other features were classified as assault weapons under California State law, gun owners and manufacturers sought various ways to obtain certain styles of rifles similar to those determined to be assault weapons. One of the most common modifications is the use of a part known as a bullet button, which modifies a rifle so that the magazine is not removable without the use of a tool (a bullet was defined as a tool per state law). The bullet button was invented and named by Darin Prince of California in January 2007. Prince also holds the US Trademark for Bullet Button USPTO trademark registration number 77663672. The bullet button recesses a small release within a block that replaces the magazine release. The recessed button to detach the magazine cannot be pressed by the shooter's finger. Firearms with this feature no longer have a \\"detachable magazine\\" under California's assault weapons definition, and therefore may be exempt depending on the other requirements. Many tools have been devised to make it easier and faster to release a magazine from a rifle, as California law states that the user must use an external tool not attached to the rifle. California Senator Leland Yee, who was later convicted of arms trafficking, attempted to have the bullet button outlawed in California, as did U.S. Senator Dianne Feinstein at the federal level; both attempts failed. On April 20, 2016, California state lawmakers gave initial approval of a bill that prohibited the sale of rifles with the bullet button. This was in response to a December 2015 terrorist attack in San Bernardino, California, despite the fact that the perpetrators, Rizwan Farook and Tashfeen Malik, used rifles that had their bullet buttons illegally removed. In July, the legislation was signed by the governor, and sales of bullet button-equipped rifles in late 2016 were reported by the Los Angeles Times to have doubled in anticipation of a January 1, 2017, ban on sales of new such rifles.

She first appeared in the thirteenth series episode \\"Rescue Me\\", broadcast on 7 June 2011. Eddi was a Senior Nurse at Holby City Hospital. She was introduced along with fellow nurse Chantelle Lane (Lauren Drummond) by the show's then executive producer, Johnathan Young. Potts was approached by the Holby City casting director for the role. She loved the character breakdown and filmed her own audition to send to the casting director. Potts was offered the role on the strength of her audition and she signed a yearlong contract. Eddi is portrayed as being straight- talking, no-nonsense, loyal and compassionate. Eddi believed the nurses did the most important job in the hospital and she had very forthright opinions. Exploration of the character's backstory began when her younger brother, Liam (Luke Tittensor), was introduced and it was revealed that Eddi had run away from home to escape their alcoholic mother. Potts pointed out that Eddi herself liked to drink to deal with her many issues. The character had a relationship with Luc Hemingway (Joseph Millson), which proved popular with viewers. Eddi also became involved with locum consultant Max Schneider (John Light) and developed an addiction to painkillers. Eddi departed on 23 October 2012, after Potts left the role. Her departure was not announced prior to the episode's airing, in order to surprise viewers. Creation and casting On 14 May 2011, Daniel Kilkelly from Digital Spy announced that actresses Sarah-Jane Potts and Lauren Drummond had joined the cast of Holby City as new regular nurses Eddi McKee and Chantelle Lane respectively. Kilkelly reported the actresses would make their debuts during Holby City's thirteenth series in June 2011. Of the new characters, the show's then executive producer, Johnathan Young, commented \\"We're delighted to welcome Sarah Jane and Lauren to Holby City. They've brought a new dynamic to the team with two very different characters in the formidable Eddi and the vivacious Chantelle. We have some fantastic storylines ready for them and I'm excited to see what lies ahead.\\" Potts was in the United States when she was approached by the Holby City casting director about the role of Eddi. After reading the character breakdown, Potts loved the idea of Eddi so much that she filmed her own audition and sent the tape over to the casting director. She was then offered the role on the strength of her audition and signed a yearlong contract. Potts admitted that she had previously shied away from long-term roles, but she had no hesitations about signing up to play Eddi. She added that her first week on set was a shock due to the number of scenes they film in a day, but she thought it was good training. Potts made her first screen appearance as Eddi during the episode broadcast on 7 June 2011. Development =Introduction and characterisation= Eddi arrived at Holby with Ian Ross (Danny Nutt), who had been in an accident. When she revealed that she was a nurse, Sacha Levy (Bob Barrett) \\"carjoled\\" her into working in AAU with him. During her shift, Eddi managed to make the ward work more efficiently and controlled the chaos. Seeing that Eddi could be an asset to the hospital, Sacha then offered her a permanent job at Holby, and she accepted. Sarah Ellis from Inside Soap commented that while Sacha was wowed by Eddi, she doubted that everyone would be as welcoming, as Eddi was a straight-talker and some of the staff found themselves on the receiving end of her \\"forthright opinions.\\" Potts said Eddi did not take any nonsense from people and her philosophy was that the nurses did the most important job in the hospital, so if they were happy, then the place would run like clockwork. Potts added \\"But if anyone makes problems for the nurses, Eddi will make problems for them!\\" A writer for the BBC's Holby City website described Eddi as being \\"loyal\\", \\"compassionate\\", \\"tough\\" and \\"uncompromising\\". Series producer Myar Craig-Brown called Eddi \\"very sarcastic, ironic and witty\\", but thought that she also exuded warmth. Craig- Brown thought the relationship that developed between Eddi and Sacha was interesting and one to watch. During her time in the show, it was hinted that Eddi liked to drink. Potts pointed out that drinking did appear to be the only way Eddi could deal with her many issues. Potts hoped the storyline would explored further, especially as Eddi's mother was an alcoholic. She also thought it would be fun to see Eddi lose her grip. Potts added that studies had shown people with alcoholics in their families became predisposed to it themselves. =Brother= In March 2012, Eddi's younger brother, Liam (Luke Tittensor), was introduced. Eddi was \\"spooked\\" when a female patient revealed personal details about her, but she then saw the patient kissing Liam. Eddi was not comfortable with Liam's arrival and it was revealed that Eddi ran away from home to escape their alcoholic mother, leaving Liam to pick up the pieces. Knowing that Liam had been in trouble with the police, Eddi worried that he had run away. She then decided to fix things with her brother by calling his youth rehabilitation scheme to organise his transfer to Holby. A spokesperson told Inside Soap's Katy Moon that Eddi may have bitten off more than she can chew. When Liam began a work placement on the wards, Eddi struggled with his effect on her professional life. Potts called Liam unpredictable and said Eddi did not trust him, even though he claimed he was on his best behaviour. Luc Hemingway (Joseph Millson) reckoned that Liam needed a helping hand, but Eddi could not see it because she is his sister and had been \\"emotionally polluted\\" by their upbringing. Potts quipped that the fact Liam and Luc were forming a bond annoyed Eddi even more. When Liam began to neglect his duties on AAU to watch Luc in surgery, Eddi became frustrated with him and at one point she pulled him out of theatre and asked him to leave the hospital. Luc then offered to become Liam's mentor. =Relationship with Luc Hemingway= Eddi first met Luc Hemingway on the roof of the hospital. They later clashed when a hungover Eddi drunkenly climbed onto the roof of Luc's camper van and woke him up. They later disagreed over the treatment of a patient, but it was clear there was an attraction between them. Millson explained that Eddi usually had the upper hand with everyone, but she initially could not work Luc out and thought he was making fun of her. Millson said it took a seven or eight episodes for her to realise that Luc liked her. Speaking to Laura Pledger from the Radio Times, Millson later said the writers were focussed on developing the relationship between Luc and Eddi. He called them \\"a very unlikely pair\\" and thought their relationship was fun and not predictable like others. He commented, \\"Strangely, [that] feels much more real and I think ‚Äì if indeed anything ever does happen ‚Äì it'll be in a really realistic way, not in a kind of violins and roses way.\\" Potts called Luc \\"socially inept\\" and said that every time Eddi took a step closer to him, he would do something to make her step back again. She revealed that she got fan- mail from people who wanted Eddi and Luc to get together, but Potts thought if they became a couple, it would be \\"the most dysfunctional relationship on the planet!\\" Luc later declared his feelings for Eddi and they shared a kiss, but shortly after Luc left the hospital. Upon his return, Luc could not wait to see Eddi again and Millson said that Luc had fallen in love with Eddi, which he did not do very often. However, the first time he saw Eddi, she was kissing locum consultant Max Schneider (John Light). Luc became jealous of Max and Millson thought that Eddi was attracted to Max because he was the opposite to Luc. Luc told Eddi what he thought of Max, but she did not agree and turned what he said back on him. Millson quipped, \\"It's a real touch√© moment.\\" When asked how Eddi was feeling about Luc being back, Potts said Eddi was really angry with Luc and she did not understand why he was back, because he did not explain himself. Potts also said that all Eddi wanted to know was the reason why Luc left. The actress added that Eddi thought Luc was only back to ruin things for her. =Max Schneider and drug addiction= New locum consultant Max Schneider caused problems for Eddi as soon as he arrived on AAU. When Max encouraged Eddi to clear the beds, she discharged a patient, who Max had cleared, and he later collapsed and had to be readmitted. Eddi was unaware that Max laid the blame on her and she agreed to go out for a drink with him. Max later stole some drugs from the hospital and framed a female patient, claiming she was a drug dealer. This led to Eddi administering the wrong dose of medication and being blamed for the drugs going missing. When Eddi found Max high on drugs, he managed to dupe her and then get her into trouble with Henrik Hanssen (Guy Henry). When some prescription painkillers went missing, Luc suspected Max had taken them, but Eddi backed him up and believed that he was innocent. Luc managed to get a sample of Max's hair, so he could prove he was a drug user, and a worried Max asked Eddi to go to Brighton with him. Eddi agreed to leave, but when she went to get Max's bag she found the painkillers and realised he was a drug addict. Luc also learned the truth and Max left the hospital. Potts said that Eddi believed Luc had ruined her chance at happiness with Max. When Eddi was later seen with a box of painkillers, Potts commented that if she took them it would be \\"the start of a slippery slope.\\" Eddi did become addicted to painkillers and Luc tried to help her overcome that addiction. Eddi initially refused to face up to her problem and tried to run away. However, her body reacted to the lack of drugs in her system and she could not carry on. Luc then managed to get Eddi to accept how much of a hold the medication had over her. =Departure= During the episode broadcast on 23 October 2012, Eddi left Holby to get help for her addiction. Shortly after the episode aired, it was confirmed that Potts had left the show after more than a year in the show. Producers did not announce her departure prior to the episode's airing, in order to surprise viewers. Of her departure, Potts stated \\"I am proud that I have been a part of this fantastic programme and I'm really thankful that I have had the opportunity to work on this show. I'd never say never to coming back ‚Äì I absolutely love the programme and all the people at Holby.\\" Consultant series producer Justin Young said he was sad to see Potts leave, but knew that her character would only be part of the show for a short time. He praised Potts for creating \\"a fantastic character\\" and being part of the one of the most popular couples in the show's history. He added \\"Sarah- Jane was great to work with and we miss her. It's the end of Luc and Eddi's story for now, but who knows what the future might hold?\\" Reception A Daily Post columnist believed Eddi and Chantelle \\"could be the answer to all Sacha's problems\\". A critic for the Daily Mirror disliked Eddi, saying \\"she's totally full of herself, and kind of annoying, but still preferable to nurse Tait\\". A reporter for the Daily Record observed \\"Eddi may appear to have put her wild youth behind her, but when it comes to hospital hierarchy, her rebellious side comes to the fore.\\" Of Eddi's and Luc's first meeting, a Daily Mirror reporter commented that she made \\"the classic mistake this week of assuming a strange bloke she bumps into on the hospital roof is a patient.\\" Another reporter for the publication thought the arrival of Eddi's brother made her \\"face up to demons in her past\\". The Daily Mirror's Jane Simon hoped Eddi was \\"secretly in love with Luc\\" when she asked for a ward transfer to get away from him. Simon later noted the speed in which Eddi's drug addiction occurred, saying \\"In less than a month, Eddi's brand new addiction to the fictional painkiller Camoxidan led to her making a public exhibition of herself at Chrissie and Sacha's wedding.\\" After Luc took Eddi away on a break, Simon quipped \\"When she's not throwing up, it's actually quite romantic.\\" The Eddi and Luc pairing proved popular with viewers, who dubbed them \\"Team Leddi\\".

Morales did not finish university studies. Morales was a director of Instituto Nacional de Fomento Cooperativo (The National Institute for Cooperativism) for twelve years and President for eight years. In his roles, he promoted agricultural cooperatives. Morales was a vocal opponent of the Central American Free Trade Agreement, which he claims created many political enemies for him. Morales was involved in helping Luis Guillermo Sol√≠s become PAC's presidential candidate and was originally tapped by Sol√≠s as a political advisory. Internal problems with PAC In 1994, Morales was found guilty of falsification of documents and embezzlement. The issue stemmed around payments for an airplane ticket to Spain. Morales disputes that he should pay interest on the ticket. In addition, Morales owes millions of col√≥nes worth of debt to private and cooperative interests. When the fact was revealed at a national assembly, several prominent PAC members asked Morales to step down as a deputy candidate, including founding member Ott√≥n Sol√≠s and presidential candidate Luis Guillermo Sol√≠s. On 12 January 2014, PAC's Ethics Commission opened hearings on Morales. The issue caused a brief stir within the party, with Morales accusing Ott√≥n Sol√≠s of having \\"elastic ethics.\\" Ott√≥n Sol√≠s threatened to leave the party should Morales remain; however, he eventually said he was satisfied with the Ethics Commission hearings. Through the matter, Morales claimed that Ott√≥n Sol√≠s was persecuting him unjustly. Because he was administratively and bureaucratically a member of PAC, he was still allowed to run under the party's banner and remain during national and local assemblies. Election as deputy Morales could not be removed from the party in time for the elections, therefore he was elected as a deputy. There is still a possibility that Morales will not be seated with other PAC candidates in the assembly.

It also produces a rye whiskey. Jefferson's works in four step process for making bourbon which is: Distill, age, cut to proof and bottle putting more time and focus into the maturation process. The Jefferson's brand was initially applied exclusively to bourbon distilled by other companies. Jefferson's acquired Kentucky Artisan Distillery in Crestwood, Kentucky. 25% percent of barrels warehoused for aging in 2017 were produced at Kentucky Artisan Distillery. The other 75% are produced by independent distilleries. History Jefferson's Bourbon was launched in 1997 by Trey Zoeller, a native Kentuckian, and his father Chet, a bourbon historian. He founded a company called McClain & Kyne after Zoeller's past relatives, including an 8th generation grandmother arrested in 1799 for moonshining. McClain & Kyne was purchased by Castle Brands around 2005. Asked about the name, Zoeller reportedly said, \\"I had no marketing budget. I simply wanted a recognizable face associated with history and tradition.\\" In June 2015, Castle Brands announced a 20% purchase of Copperhead Distillery Company, which owns and operates Kentucky Artisan Distillery. The brand began with Jefferson's Reserve, then expanded with the addition of Jefferson's Presidential Select, and Jefferson's Small Batch. Jefferson's now produces several varieties of bourbon and rye, including some limited edition offerings. Production In addition to conventional bourbons, ryes, and whiskeys, the label also produces some other noteworthy products.

Depot history In the late 1890s, business leaders in Andalusia posted a $5000 prize for the first rail line to pass through the town. The Central of Georgia Railway claimed the prize, completing the track in September 1899, and built a depot on land donated by residents. The town flourished with the new rail connection; population rose from 551 in 1900 to 2,480 in 1910. The last Norfolk Southern train, successor to the Central of Georgia, departed Andalusia on March 31, 1983. The wooden depot is similar in design to other small-town stations along the Central of Georgia line. The one-story, gable-roofed structure is clad with board and batten siding. Two front rooms with separate entrances were used as passenger waiting rooms. At the opposite end of the station is a large freight room. The agent's office spans the width of the building between the two, and features a gabled bay window. See also: The building was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1984. Museum The building was re-opened as a history museum in 1987; named after the Three Notch Trail of which two streets (East Three Notch Street and South Three Notch Street) in Andalusia are also named. Operated by the Covington Historical Society, the museum focuses on County history and area railroad history. Displays include many photographs, a bottle collection, historic cameras and accessories, tools and military artifacts. Other buildings in the museum include a restored post office with a period schoolroom in back, a pioneer log cabin and a country store. There are also two cabooses and a CSX motor car with a model railway layout outside the depot building.

The Yellow Chief tells the story of a southern mulatto slave who runs away to become a Cheyenne Indian chief in the Rocky Mountains, seeking revenge on his cruel plantation owners as they emigrate to the West. The novel was published in 1870 as a pulp western dime novel in London, and was afterwards published as Part II of Mayne Reid's The White Squaw (1871). It is one of 75 adventure \\"romance\\" novels that Mayne Reid wrote in his lifetime, including The Rifle Rangers (1850), The White Chief (1855), The Scalp Hunters (1856), and The Headless Horseman (1866). The Yellow Chief  Plot Summary  Starting in Vicksburg, Mississippi preceding the abolition of slavery, The Yellow Chief begins on the plantation of the Blackadder family. Blount Blackadder, the 18-year-old son of the plantation owner Squire Blackadder, punishes a mulatto slave, Blue Dick, out of revenge over a girl, a quadroon named Sylvia. The 'punishment of the pump', a frequent act at the Blackadder plantation, consists of placing the victims head directly under the painfully cold stream of a water pump. Daughter Clara Blackadder watches the shameful punishment, only daydreaming about the Irishmen Edward O'Neil, who her father forbids her from marrying. Whilst murdering Sylvia in the woods in the process, Blue Dick proceeds to escape the plantation, never to return. After experiencing bankruptcy five years later, the Blackadders sell their plantation and travel west in covered wagons to start a new life in California. A Choctaw Indian named Woboga guides them through the journey, and later turns out to be a spy for the antagonist Cheyenne Indian group led by Yellow Chief, who wants secret revenge against the Blackadder family. Through Woboga, Yellow Chief and his men find the ex- Mississippi planters corralled in an enclosed gorge in the Rocky Mountains by Bijou Creek of the South Platte River. They attack with gunfire, killing Squire Blackadder in the process, and capture the rest of the group as prisoners. Meanwhile, Edward O'Neil, who has since left Mississippi to the Colorado mountains to escape his heartbreak over Clara Blackadder, travels as a fur trapper with his experienced, older companion, 'Lije Orton. The two trappers overhear Yellow Chief's attack of the corralled emigrants and decide to receive help from the mountain men of Fort Saint Vrain. O'Neil sees that Clara is of those imprisoned and becomes determined to save her. Yellow Chief's men create a wooden cross to emulate crucifixion for their white captives. As the Yellow Chief first administers a \\"dose\\" of cold water onto the \\"crucified\\" Blount Blackadder, the plantation emigrants begin to feel suspicious. It isn't until Mr. Snively sees the Yellow Chief wash off his war paint in a waterfall, revealing his mulatto \\"yellow\\" skin, that the Yellow Chief's true identity as Blue Dick is revealed. Another secret reveals itself when the Yellow Chief threatens Clara Blackadder to the \\"punishment of the pump.\\" Old Nan, an elder of the Blackadder slaves, comes forth to inform Blue Dick (the Yellow Chief) that he and Clara are blood siblings through master- slave relations. Squire Blackadder's relation to Blue Dick only maddens him even more, as Blue Dick threatens to make Clara his slave. After much strategic planning, 'Lije Orton, Edward O'Neil, and mountain man Black Harris track down Yellow Chief and his Cheyenne troupe and manage to kill them all with little difficulty. The emigrants continue their journey to California, leaving Clara behind to start a life on the east coast with O'Neil. Together they raise children and are often visited by 'Lije to be updated on the mountain life.  Main Characters  * Squire Blackadder - owner of the Blackadder plantation, as well as Blount and Clara's father.

She reveals that Clara and Blue Dick are blood-related.  Historical Background  This novel was written in 1869, but begins in Mississippi in 1849 before the abolition of slavery. While describing the cruelties of the punishment of the pump, Mayne Reid recalls that this \\" is a tale of twenty years ago.\\" In the years that The Yellow Chief takes place, America was undergoing the California Gold Rush, alluded in the Blackadder's emigration to California from Mississippi. The publication of Uncle Tom's Cabin around the mid 19th century beckoned a rise in anti-slavery novels such as this one. European immigration of workers was booming during this time in American history, as well as industrialization through the railroad system. The invasion of railroads into the western plains is mentioned at the very end of The Yellow Chief, as 'Lije Orton comes to visit Clara and Edward in Manhattan. By describing the rails as \\"penetrating\\" the prairies, readers can assume Mayne Reid's bitter reaction to industrialization, as his romantic view of America's uncharted territories reigns throughout the novel. Frontispiece of George A. Crofutt's Great Trans- Continental P.R.R. Tourist's Guide 1870 The events of The Yellow Chief precede the Civil War, but still allude to issues of anti-slavery and abolitionism, as events of tension such as Bleeding Kansas were going on at this time in American history. The real geographical places of the Bijou Creek at the South Platte River of The Yellow Chief are regions of the unorganized territories of the United States, east of the Rocky Mountains. This would later become Colorado. Although led by fictional characters in the novel, Fort Saint Vrain was a real notable fur trading post in this region. Native American tribes and mountain men engaged in trade at this structure, which would employ James Beckworth and Sacajewea's son Jean Baptiste Charbonneau in its existence. Captain Mayne Reid = Allusions to Mayne Reid's life = Mayne Reid often based his novels off of real events and experiences. The novelist was born in Ballyrony, Ireland, similarly to The Yellow Chief's Irish-born protagonist, Edward O'Neil. Mayne Reid immigrated to America in 1839 and become a provisions clerk in Louisiana. Soon after in 1841, he moved to Natchez, Mississippi, close to the hypothetical site of the Blackadder's plantation. Before moving to Philadelphia and becoming a lieutenant in the Mexican‚ÄìAmerican War in 1846, Mayne Reid is said to have travelled West on personal adventures. Although he claims to have based his western adventure novels off of these real experiences, there is no real evidence that Mayne Reid's western travels ever actually happened. According to close friend Edgar Allan Poe, Mayne Reid was a \\"colossal but most picturesque liar.\\" Preceding the Mexican‚ÄìAmerican War, Mayne Reid spent his money freely and declined into bankruptcy in 1866. The Blackadder family similarly experienced bankruptcy at the beginning of the novel, forcing them to move westward. Mayne Reid relates messages of anti-slavery in his novel when describing the inhumane punishments of slaves given by the Blackadder planters. This relates to Mayne Reid's experiences in Louisiana, where he was said to have left his job after refusing to whip slaves.  Genre  The Yellow Chief combines many popular adventure fiction narratives of the 19th century, including plantation narrative, frontier fiction, and the Indian attack narrative. Through this cross of genres, Mayne Reid was able to show a broad overview of America's expansion, slavery abolition, and sharing the land with Indians. Like many of Mayne Reid's novels, it contributed to the growing interest and myth of the American \\"Wild West\\". The novel follows convention of imperial adventure fiction, exemplifying values of the genre such as the nationalist and sacrificing male hero, a damsel in distress, and the dangers of 'the other', as well as a desire to conquer them. Although the slaves are mostly written into the novel with a sympathetic tone, the Indians are portrayed as hostile and frightening, with the racially ambiguous Yellow Chief being the most feared. While characterizing retribution attacks on the romanticized natural lands of the Rocky Mountains, Mayne Reid also adds to the imperial adventure fiction tradition of toiling fear of retaliation with desire of the foreign romance.  Plot  Many 19th century pulp western authors, Mayne Reid included, often returned to the same set trope of plot, characters, and conclusions in their novels. Mayne Reid was most noted for marrying off all his characters at the end of his stories. The Yellow Chief also features a common plot theme of Mayne Reid, in which a heroine's \\"weak brother\\" becomes caught in the clutches of a villain seeking revenge. Although The Yellow Chief was a dime novel, the cliff hangers throughout the plot seem to occur in the tradition of serial novels of 19th century literature. Many unrealistic coincidences and plot twists are presented to the reader, such as Blue Dick, the Blackadders, and O'Neil ending up in the same area of the Rocky Mountains. As a very short read, only 168 pages long, the different developments of action don't have much build-up. The plot of the novel, although maybe suspenseful for a 19th-century reader, comes across as frivolous and implausible to the contemporary reader.  English Western  Mayne Reid's novels were published in London, placing The Yellow Chief under the tradition of English Western literature. Comparative to westerns by American novelists, English Westerns were largely written for a juvenile audience, with an emphasis on physical dangers of the West and a high interest in experiences such as the Gold Rush and trapper life. English Westerns also abide to the theme of the West being a temporary place to visit - as the male hero, such as Edward O'Neil, is given the opportunity to learn and \\"wrest a good living\\" on the frontier, and then immediately returning to society. With an outsider's perspective, Mayne Reid's English Western will often glorify the scenery of the West, but also falsely portray imaginary aspects of the environment and Native people, such as physical descriptions of the Cheyenne people adorning full-face paint. English Western authors have little knowledge of the animals of the American West and their behaviors, often presenting them in a very menacing way, such as the horse stampeded at the end of The Yellow Chief. The Yellow Chief  Anti-Slavery & Minority Presence  The Yellow Chief is considered a work of anti-slavery literature. The novel deals with issues of perceptions of race in 19th century America, questioning the humanity and hypocrisy of slaveholders who adhere abusive punishments onto slaves; especially since Blue Dick is blood-related to the Blackadders, and racially ambiguous. Mayne Reid was born in Ireland and considered a British novelist, giving The Yellow Chief a foreign and critical perspective on these American race relations. Mayne Reid's most famous anti-slavery novel, The Quadroon A Lover's Adventures in Louisiana (1856) was about an interracial love story and the inner turmoil of a white man who has fallen in love with a quadroon slave woman. In the disclaimer of The Quadroon, Mayne Reid states the purpose of his anti-slavery novel is \\"neither to aid the abolitionist, nor glorify the planter\\". Another novel, Osceola, The Seminole, or The Half Blood deals with an Indian leader, similar to Yellow Chief, whose ancestry consisted of a white plantation owner and a Seminole mother. Mayne Reid's experiences in America as a slave overseer in the south, an Indian fighter, and an officer in the Mexican War gave him the authority to write these stories, and also lent him the conventional biases of white American society. The Yellow Chief holds harmful descriptions of African Americans and American Indians as savages and animalistic. When describing a slave boy running away on all fours from the grip of the Yellow Chief, Mayne Reid emulates ideas of Darwin and the devolution of humans. Often referring to the Cheyennes as \\"skunks\\", Mayne Reid characterizes the Yellow Chief's gang as frequent drunks, making them easily manipulated to the fur trader's attacks.  Critical Reception  Mayne Reid was a household name for literature in the 19th century. His American West novels were extremely popular among boys, and many of his books have been translated into different languages such as Polish and Russian. Mayne Reid is especially popular and appreciated in the former Soviet Union.Butler, S. R. (2006). Away o'er the waves: The transatlantic life and literature of captain mayne reid. (Order No. 3239828, The University of Texas at Arlington). ProQuest Dissertations and Theses, , 747-747 p. Retrieved from http://search.proquest.com/docview/304906159 United States President Theodore Roosevelt was a huge fan of Mayne Reid. Some attribute Mayne Reid's novels to Roosevelt's pursuits of American national park expansion during his presidency. Many English Westerns, such as those written by Mayne Reid's contemporaries G.A. Henty and R.M. Ballantyne, are criticized for being Christian imperialistic instruction manuals for \\"youthful empire-builders,\\" and not actually caring about the West. While Mayne Reid's later juvenile novels have also been critiqued as poor, his early romances for adults such as The Yellow Chief have been praised as his best. Through a naturalist focus on the frontier and aware warnings of human mistreatment, The Yellow Chief can be seen as one of the more meaningful examples of 19th century English Westerns.

It is approximately long and flows through Warton Township in Potter County and Leidy Township in Clinton County. The watershed of the stream has an area of . The main rock formation in the watershed is the Pottsville Formation. A number of bridges cross the stream. There are no state roads and virtually no township roads in the watershed of Hammersley Fork. However, there are dirt roads and gravel roads, and several stream crossings in the watershed. The first settlers arrived in the watershed in 1827 and the first roads in the area were constructed several years later. Industrial activities such as logging were common in the watershed in the early 20th century, but there is currently virtually no such activity there. Wild trout naturally reproduce in the stream throughout its entire length. Most of the creek has a substantial riparian buffer. Course Hammersley Fork begins in central Eulalia Township, Potter County, near the Sinnemahoning Creek watershed. It flows southeast to Elk Lick Knob, where it receives the tributary Black Mark Hollow. The stream then turns south and flows into a valley, passing Bunnell Ridge. The valley gets deeper and the stream receives several small tributaries. It turns southwest shortly downstream of the mouth of Elkhorn Run. In the southern reaches of the township, the stream receives the tributary Bell Branch and turns south-southeast, exiting Eulalia Township. Upon leaving Eulalia Township, Potter County, Hammersley Fork enters Leidy Township, Clinton County and continues south, passing by Susquehannock State Forest. The stream continues south for some distance and crosses Pennsylvania Route 144. Immediately after crossing Pennsylvania Route 144, the stream reaches its confluence with Kettle Creek. Hammersley Fork joins Kettle Creek upstream of its mouth. Hydrology The concentration of alkalinity in Hammersley Fork ranges from . Particles in the stream include coarse sand and fine gravel. The stream experiences relatively high water temperatures and in July 2003, its temperature between Dry Hollow and Bunnell Run ranges from . Between Dry Hollow and Nelson Branch, the temperature ranged from . The sediment load in Hammersley Fork is per year. The nitrogen load is per year, while the phosphorus load is less than half a pound per acre per year. Between the mouth of Dry Hollow and the mouth of Bunnell Run, the waters of Hammersley Fork are a Rosgen type F and a Rosgen type C stream. The upper part of the stretch of the stream between Dry Hollow and Nelson Branch is a Rosgen type C stream. The middle part of the stretch is a Rosgen type B stream and the lower part is a Rosgen type F to D stream. Geography and geology The elevation near the mouth of Hammersley Fork is above sea level. The elevation of the stream's source is between above sea level. The Pottsville Formation is the main rock formation in the watershed of Hammersley Fork. The highlands northwest of the Hammersley Fork watershed range from to and the highest elevation in the watershed is above sea level. The elevation range in the watershed is . At its mouth, the stream is wide. The average basin slope is 16.24 degrees. There are numerous gravel bars in the lower reaches of the stream. This width is maintained because deposition in the area is often removed. There is also a headcut in the lower reaches of the stream. At the headcut, it splits three ways for . A spot on Hammersley Fork near its mouth is the only location in the Kettle Creek watershed that has been channelized. Hammersley Fork flows over bedrock or large cobbles for much of the stretch between Dry Hollow and Nelson Branch. From the mouth of Nelson Branch to downstream, the stream mostly flows in the central part of its valley. The tributary Nelson Branch has a patch of erosion that is high and long. There is a floodplain at the mouth of Hammersley Fork. Two bridges cross Hammersley Fork near its mouth. One carries Pennsylvania Route 144 and the other carries Hammersley Avenue. Watershed The watershed of Hammersley Fork has an area of , making it the second-largest sub-watershed of Kettle Creek after Cross Fork. There are of streams in the watershed. The mouth of the stream is in the United States Geological Survey quadrangle of Tamarack. However, its source is in the quadrangle of Short Run. The stream also passes through the quadrangle of Hammersley Fork. A number of camps and residences are on the left bank of Hammersley Fork upstream of the mouth. There are a number of dirt roads and gravel roads on the edge of the upper reaches of the stream's watershed. However, there are no state routes and almost no township roads in the watershed. However, much of the upper part of the watershed can only be accessed on foot. There are five road crossings of the stream and its tributaries. There is some agricultural land along the stream. History and recreation Hammersley Fork was entered into the Geographic Names Information System on August 2, 1979 and its identifier is 1199877. It is named after J. P. Hammersley. Jacob \\"Old Jake\\" Hammersley and Archie Stewart settled at the mouth of Hammersley Fork in 1827, with Hammersley settling on the east bank of the stream and Stewart settling on the west bank. They were the first settlers to come that far upstream in the Kettle Creek watershed. Additionally, the two constructed a gristmill on the west bank of the stream. There were no roads in the watershed by 1833. Later in the 1800s, Nathan Tuttle operated a gang mill on the stream. A settlement, also called Hammersley Fork, was created on the stream by 1852. In 1902, John Gartsee started a village called Hammersley in the middle reaches of Hammersley Fork. Its intended purpose was as a supply point for logging camps in the area. By 1902 to 1910, there was a network of railroads in the watershed. Logging was a large industry in the watershed of Hammersley Fork in the early 1900s, but there have been almost no industrial activities in the area since then. An old railroad grade is located on Hammersley Fork. Fish have been stocked in the stream since the 1930s or 1940s. A two-span steel stringer/multi-beam or girder bridge carrying T545 over Hammersley Fork was built in 1933 and repaired in 2010. The bridge is long. A two-span bridge was built over the stream in 1962 and repaired in 2011. This bridge is long and carries Pennsylvania Route 144. The Cherry Springs Civilian Conservation Corps camp was built near the headwaters of Hammersley Fork in 1933. The Hammersley Trail, which is part of the Susquehannock Trail System, passes by the mouth of Hammersley Fork. Biology Wild trout naturally reproduce in Hammersley Fork from its headwaters downstream to its mouth. Great blue herons have been observed at the headwaters of Hammersley Fork, despite the fact that they are more commonly found in large river valleys. Little yellow stoneflies also inhabit it. Brown trout first appeared in the stream in the 1920s after being stocked in Cross Fork and in the 1940s the brown trout populations significantly increased. The Forrest H. Duttlinger Natural Area is located on Hammersley Fork. Most of the stream flows through this natural area. It is a 1521-acre area that includes a 158-acre area of old-growth hemlock trees. The Hammersley Wild Area is also located in the watershed. The stream's watershed is a Pennsylvania Natural Diversity Inventory Biological Diversity Area. The Pennsylvania Department of Environmental Protection also classifies the watershed as an exceptional-value area. From the mouth of Hammersley Fork to upstream of the mouth, the canopy cover ranges from 0 to 50 percent. Much of the creek, however, has a significant riparian buffer. The canopy coverage of the section of Hammersley Fork between Dry Hollow and Bunnell Run is 62 percent on average. However, the lower part of this section has 86 percent canopy coverage. The upper part of the stretch of the stream between Nelson Branch and Dry Hollow has a canopy coverage of 93 percent. The middle part of this section has a coverage of 58 percent and the lowest part has a canopy coverage of 89 percent. The tree coverage at the confluence of Nelson Branch with Hammersley Fork is 70 percent. The canopy coverage up to downstream of the confluence averages 40 percent. Tree species in this stretch include hemlock, red maple, river birch, sycamore, and willow.

The settlement was the site of the Frog Lake Massacre part of the Cree uprising of the North-West Rebellion in western Canada. Led by Wandering Spirit, young Cree warriors attacked the village of Frog Lake in the District of Saskatchewan of the Northwest Territories on 2 April 1885, where they killed nine residents. The bell was one of twenty identical bells purchased by Bishop Vital-Justin Grandin for the Diocese of St Albert. For a time the bell was believed to have been taken from the church of Batoche after the Battle of Batoche. History After the massacre the bodies of Fafard, Marchand, Delaney and Gowanlock had been hurriedly placed in the cellar under the church by several of the M√©tis residents who were now captive. They, at great risk, also moved the bodies of Quinn and Gouin into the cellar of a house near where they were killed but were refused permission to touch the other victims. The church, the rectory and all the buildings of the Frog Lake settlement were burned on April 4, 1885 (the day before Easter). All that remained of the mission was the bell tower and the cemetery. On June 14 the Midland Battalion (the advance guard of Major-General Strange) arrived and buried the bodies in the cemetery. The bell which was still suspended from the fire blackened bell tower by the church on June 8 disappeared. Bishop Vital-Justin Grandin suspected that the soldiers had taken the bell but a search found no trace. Father Laurent Legoff o.m.i. (in charge of the St. Raphael Mission at Cold Lake) also mentions that the bell of the Frog Lake Mission had been taken from the bell tower. General Strange upon learning of the theft blamed the military teamsters. Several years later the Canadian government reimbursed the Mission for their lost bell. In 2014 evidence that soldiers from the Midland Battalion had indeed stolen the bell surfaced in Ontario. The Midland Battalion served in the Alberta Column of the North West Field Force until it was demobilized on 24 July 1885.Canadian Forces Publication A-DH-267-003 Insignia and Lineages of the Canadian Forces. Volume 3: Combat Arms Regiments. Charles H. Winslow who was a captain in the Midland Battalion and received the North West Canada Medal for his participation in the North West Rebellion wrote of the bell: William Young, a private of the Millbrook Company in the Midland Battalion who received the North West Canada Medal for his participation in the North West Rebellion, also mentioned the bell in his diary on Friday July 25, 1885: Authentication The bell was kept in Millbrook, Ontario until 1991, when it was stolen from the Royal Canadian Legion hall. It resurfaced in 2013 in M√©tis hands. The M√©tis believed it to be the Bell of Batoche. The Frog Lake bell had been misidentified as being from Batoche in a Canadian Centennial yearbook published by a local historical society. Questions about its authenticity as the Bell of Batoche ensued until April 2014 when Le Mus√©e de Saint-Boniface Museum director, Philippe Mailhot, acknowledged that there was enough evidence to conclude that the \\"Bell of Batoche\\" which is in the possession of the museum was actually the \\"Bell of Frog Lake\\" taken from the Frog Lake Mission in 1885. Evidence that corroborated the bell's Frog Lake origin was discovered by the CBC in 2014. A series of handwritten certificates and notes indicated that the original Batoche bell was donated in 1937 to another Catholic mission in St. Laurent de Grandin, about from Batoche. That church burned down in 1990, destroying the bell except its clapper and a few pieces of copper. The church was rebuilt, and the bell's fragments are kept in the new church's shrine in a locked glass case.

It is a topic commonly studied in the domain of positive psychology. It can also be referred to simply as the up-regulation of positive emotions. Traditional psychology attempts to develop methods of coping and dealing with negative emotions. Positive psychology uses the concept of savoring as a way to maximize the potential benefits that positive experiences and emotions can have on peoples' lives. The opposite of Savoring is known as dampening. Dampening is a method of dealing with positive affect by trying to feel worse, or down-regulate positive emotions. Fred Bryant, a social psychologist at Loyola University Chicago, is considered to be the father of savoring research.http://greatergood.berkeley.edu/article/item/10_steps_to_savoring_the_good_things_in_life He introduced the concept of savoring as being mindfully engaged and aware of one's feelings during positive events. By being engaged one can increase happiness in both the short and long run. So savoring is not merely the experience of positive emotions, but the deliberate effort to make a positive experience last.  Major Theories  Psychological theories on savoring describe various facets of the construct such as its manifestation, operationalization, strategies to facilitate its occurrence, and its association with well-being. Work done by Fred Bryant in 2005 discusses savoring as manifesting in the following three forms: # Anticipation- or savoring in the form of the enjoyment of a forthcoming positive event # Being in the moment- savoring by lengthening and strengthening the present positive experience. Bryant, Smart & King (2005) suggest that such focus creates stronger, more intense memories to later be recalled in reminiscing # Reminiscing-Recalling memories in order to re-experience and thus savor positive emotions Quoidbach, Berry, Hansenne & Mikolajczak (2010) have also worked on savoring theory and offer four general strategies for facilitating savoring: # Behavioral display- Using non-verbal cues to express one's positive emotions # Be Present- Having intentional, attentive focus on the current positive moment; also closely related to mindfulness. # Capitalizing- A social aspect in which an individual \\"communicates and celebrates with others\\" # Positive Mental Time Travel (past or future-focused)- reminiscing on or anticipating positive events  Major Empirical Findings  Jose, Lim, and Bryant (2012) distinguish between two types of savoring: trait and state-based savoring. Trait-based savoring has been shown to be a more stable, generalized disposition to savor events in one's daily life while state-based savoring is a momentary episode of savoring behavior. While both appear important in terms of overall effects of savoring, trait savoring has the potential to be expressed through dampening, a response that depresses positive events. In terms of age effects, Ramsey & Gentzler (2014) found that savoring can play an indirect role in subjective well-being across ages as savoring was reported to be greater for younger participants who perceived that they had more time left in their lives. Smith & Bryant (2012) and Bryant & Yarnold (2014) showed a relationship between savoring tendencies and personality styles. Through studies about vacation enjoyment and college undergraduate achievement ideation, they showed that Type A people tend to not savor experiences as much as Type B people. Type A college students tend to enjoy the achievements in the present moment rather than savor the feelings for a future time because by doing so they might miss an opportunity for future achievement. Type B people also tend to enjoy vacations more than Type A people because of the savoring effect. Conventional wisdom states that money doesn‚Äôt buy happiness ‚Äì and recent research by Jordi Quoidbach and colleagues has shown that wealthier people report less savoring ability. In the same study, Quoidbach and others found that when exposed to a reminder of wealth, people were less able to savor and enjoy a piece of chocolate. Besides wealth, it has been found that self-esteem also affects savoring ability and emotional regulation. Wood et al (2003) found that people with low self-esteem are less likely to try and savor a positive experience and also more likely to dampen their feelings when they feel good. One study showed that the higher a person‚Äôs self-esteem the more they were expected to enjoy, celebrate and savor their own success.  Applications  Positive emotions are linked to a variety of outcomes. According to Barbara Fredrickson‚Äôs Broaden-and-Build Theory (2001), positive emotions can serve as a key element to human flourishing. Flourishing entails having high levels of social, emotional, and psychological well-being.Snyder, C. R., Lopez, S. J., & Pedrotti, J. T. (2011). Positive psychology: the scientific and practical explorations of human strengths (2nd ed.). Thousand Oaks, Calif.: SAGE. Fredrickson's research also finds that they improve psychological resiliency, emotional well-being, counteract negative emotions, and broaden thought and action capabilities. Therefore, if one can increase the duration of positive emotions via savoring, then theoretically one should be more likely to reap the benefits of these more intense emotions. Martin Seligman, American psychologist and one of the most avid supporters of the field of positive psychology, has posited that savoring strategies can be used in therapeutic settings. Supporting this position, research has found that savoring strategies have been found to help people build stronger relationships, improve their mental and physical health, and as a method of finding creative solutions to problems. It has also been shown to reduce feelings of hopelessness and increase positive affect. Some examples of savoring strategies provided by Quoidbach and his colleagues (2010) are prolonging positive emotions through nonverbal behavioral displays like facial expressions, consciously attending to a positive experience by focusing your attention (called \\"being present\\" by Quoidbach and his colleagues), capitalizing on a positive experience by celebrating and discussing it with others. A final savoring strategy proposed by Quoidbach is positive mental time travel. This involves either reminiscing on a past positive experience or anticipating a future positive event.  Controversies  As mentioned earlier, trait based savoring may be expressed negatively in the form of dampening. Dampening has been classified as a savoring response in opposition to amplifying, a process that increases positive emotions by focusing on how their experiences went right. In this way, savoring may be connected with rumination. Some empirical literature contradicts previous findings regarding increase of positive affect. Hurley & Kwon (2011) had participants savor their moments and to recall positive experiences from their past week. The researchers found that depressive symptoms decreased in the savoring group as compared to the control group, yet positive affect remained unchanged. However, the researchers did consider the possibility that it takes time for the skills of savoring to develop to the point that they are able to influence positive emotions. Another consideration was that that was possible they would have observed such effects if the study lasted longer. Savoring has also been questioned in terms of its usefulness across cultures. Miyamoto & Ma found that although most individuals do prefer to enjoy their positive experiences, Easterners (East Asians) have a tendency to do so at a lower rate than Westerners (European Americans in this study). The study suggests that cultural scripts play a large role in how emotion regulation is carried out. For instance, while both cultures hold that positive emotions are good and negative ones bad, the amount of emphasis placed upon each differs. For Westerners, positive emotions are very desirable and negative ones very undesirable, as compared to Easterners who hold that positive emotions are moderately desirable and negative ones moderately undesirable. The culture for Easterns seems to be more reserved in all expressions of emotions as compared to a more open Western style.  Conclusion  Though there are controversial studies that do not provide supportive evidence in favor of the positive effects of savoring, most researchers and their data support that savoring does indeed have positive effects for cultivating individual well-being. To take advantage of the benefits effects of savoring, Jose et al. (2012) and Quoidbach, Hansenne, and Mikolajczak (2010) discuss strategies that can be used to help people develop savoring as a skill including (but not limited to): # Sharing your good feelings with others # Taking a mental photograph by being acutely aware in the moment with intentions on recalling the mental photograph later # Sharpening your sensory perceptions by being attentive to the present moment # Comparing the outcome to something worse # Getting absorbed in the moment # Counting your blessings (giving thanks) # Avoid \\"killjoy\\" thinking by looking on the bright side # Behaviorally communicating positivity to others via positive facial expressions # Limiting \\"time is too fleeting\\" perceptions These strategies are not mutually exclusive. = Future Directions of Savoring Research= Bryant et al. (2011) said that three unresolved issues in savoring research are: finding the specific neuropsychological processes involved with different savoring strategies, developing methods of measuring and analyzing savoring in real time, and finding the different developmental processes through which people acquire different savoring strategies. They also note that other areas of future research can include cultural differences and similarities in savoring, the relationship between savoring and negative emotions and outcomes, savoring intervention efforts, and the evolutionary implications of savoring.

Print. The story is a third-person narrative that follows the journey of Reverend Thomas Owen as he seeks to carry out missionary work in south central Africa, specifically in the tribe of Amasuka. The novel starts in England in the parish of Reverend Thomas Owen and moves to South Central Africa, where the tribe of Amasuka (People of Fire) is located, which is where the majority of the novel takes place. While there, he encounters Hokosa, the chief of the Wizards who essentially wishes him to prove that his God is greater than their god through trials of lightning. The novel is placed in the imperialist literature of 19th-century England. Just like many of his other works, this novel is inspired by Rider Haggard's experiences of South Africa and British colonialism. The character Noma is meant to be representative of the theme of female authority and feminine behavior. Some scholars have called the novel ‚Äúa tale of victorious faith.‚Äùhttps://librivox.org/the-wizard-by-h-rider-haggard/ It has received both praise and criticism for its representation of the imperialist novel and of womanhood.  Synopsis  The novel begins on a Sunday afternoon in summer at a church in the Midland county called Busscombe. Reverend Thomas Owen had a preacher for the day called a ‚ÄúDeputation,‚Äù who was sent to arouse the indifferent to the duty of converting the savage tribes by collecting money. As the ‚ÄúDeputation‚Äù told about his experience with a south central African tribe called the ‚ÄúSons of Fire,‚Äù Reverence Owen became very interested in the mission to convert this tribe of Amasuka and converting them. Reverend Owen ultimately decides to take on this task and gives his old job to the ‚ÄúDeputation.‚Äù Two years go by as Reverend Owen lives in a hut outside of the tribe's town and he sends his newly converted native of the tribe, John, to send a message to King Umsuka which is that Reverend Owen wants to learn their language so that he can administer the word of God to them. After being warned that the People of Fire have their faith too, John informs Rev. Owen that if he cannot perform the magic they want him to perform, he will be killed. Reverend Owen learns of Hokosa and Hafela's plot to kill the king with poison in order to gain the throne through a vision. Rev. Owen learns of the anecdote to the poison in another vision of the Tree of Death and uses this knowledge to his advantage by giving it to Umsuka to revive him at the Feast of the First-Fruit and therefore ‚Äúproves‚Äù his God's power over the People of Fire's god. In the ‚ÄúFirst Trial by Fire,‚Äù Hokosa and Umsuka show Rev. Owen their god ‚Äì an oddly sized stone ‚Äì and explain that the lightning god knows Hokosa and the other wizards so they will not harm them, but will harm Rev. Owen if he goes through the trial in the plain full of iron. When the lightning from the storm does not harm Rev. Owen, the People of Fire respect him but many are convinced it is magic, not the work of God. In the second trial by Fire, Hokosa and his counsel stand on one side of the plain while Rev. Owen, John, and Nodwengo stand on the other with the cross and the instructions that whoever is left standing is more powerful. After the storm, the only ones left standing are Hokosa, Rev. Owen, John, and Nodwengo ‚Äì finally proving that Rev. Owen's God is more powerful, even though many in the tribe were still suspicious of this new religion. After the death of Umsuka and the rise of Nodwengo, Hokosa and his new wife, Noma, go to the grave of Umsuka to ask for his counsel through magic. Umsuka speaks through Noma's body and tells him that he will conquer Rev. Owen but that at his death he will await his trial for his sins during his life. Following this event, Noma gives birth to a stillborn child and Hokosa tells her that she must go on a journey of purification. On this journey he instructs her to find Hafela and give him the message that Hokosa will help him regain his throne if he is made second in command. Hokosa sends poison and poison fruit with a woman from the town and the fruit is given to Rev. Owen to eat. After feeling regret for his actions, although it is too late for Rev. Owen, Hokosa asks for forgiveness and is converted to Christianity and is ultimately baptized by Rev. Owen. In the meantime, Noma has found Hafela and tells him of the plans to fight Nodwengo. When Noma comes back to Hokosa, she learns that Hokosa has already told Rev. Owen and Nodwengo of all the plans that Hafela has to attack the town so that they may be ready when the time comes. After Rev. Owen's death from the poison given to him, the fight between the army of Nodwengo and Hafela ensues. On the second day of the battle, Noma makes a plan to bring Hokosa out in the open so that they can kill him since he is the one with Rev. Owen's power now. Hokosa is captured and crucified on top of the Tree of Death. As Hokosa is dying on the cross, he instructs Nodwengo to spare the life of Hafela's army so that peace can be in the land. Hafela says he will go and take his servants with him and stabs himself in the heart and dies. Noma climbs the Tree of Death to Hokosa, stabs him in the heart and jumps from the tree, lands on a rock and dies. The cross ultimately prevails in the end. = Character List = Thomas Owen: preacher who goes to Sons of Fire to convert them to Christianity Deputation: missionary who came to speak to Rev.

R. Haggard = Haggard was an English writer of adventure novels set in predominantly Africa. He was also involved in agricultural reform throughout the British Empire. His stories, sited at the end of Victorian literature, continue to be prevalent and important. In 1875, Haggard's father sent him to South Africa to take up a position as the secretary to Sir Henry Bulwer, Lieutenant Governor of the Colony of Natal. Three of his books, The Wizard (1896), Elissa: The Doom of Zimbabwe (1899), and Black Heart and White Heart: A Zulu Idyll (1900), are dedicated to Burnham's daughter, Nada, the first white child born in Bulawayo and was named after Haggard's 1892 book Nada the Lily. In addition, Haggard helped to establish British control over the Boer republic as well as raise the Union flag over the capital, Pretoria, in May 1877.H. Rider Haggard Many critiques claim there is a heavy emphasis on South African race relations and on the large number of native authors in that region.Tucker, Martin. \\"Africa in Modern Literature: A Survey of Contemporary Writing in English.\\" Books Abroad 43.1 (1969): 159. Print. According to Rebecca Stott, ‚ÄúThe penetration of Africa in Haggard‚Äôs novels is a way for the male characters to prove their strength, virility and manliness.‚Äù During the late 9th century, public attention had focused much of its time to Africa. Furthermore, she explains that Haggard's literary career began in the 1880s when public interest in Africa had reached a peak and when he himself had just returned from six years of public service in South Africa.Stott, Rebecca. \\"The Dark Continent: Africa as Female Body in Haggard's Adventure Fiction.\\" Feminist Review 32 (1989): 69-89. Print. = Publication = The Wizard was first published in 1896 in London.Mullen, R. D. \\"The Books of H. Rider Haggard: A Chronological Survey\\". Science Fiction Studies 5.3 (1978): 287-91. Print. = Genre = The Wizard is a strong example of the adventure romance that was popular at the end of the 19th century, while still being very prevalent today. Adventure romance is a subgenre of the romance genre. They are often characterized with romantic suspense featuring strong heroes and fast-moving plots. In 19th century British literature, adventure romance typically takes place in a foreign space, usually a colonial enterprise of the British empire. This novel has some significant developmental effects on the development of the adventure novel as well. For example, Reverend Owen's movement from England to south central Africa is common in the adventure novel. In addition, H. Rider Haggard has been credited with the invention of the romance genre by many critiques. This novel is also an example of the imperial adventure novel, which is evident from the colonialism and its effect on the novel. The idea of missionary work that was very prevalent in the 19th century shapes some of the major themes of the novel through the lens of the imperial adventure novel. Critiques such as Richard F. Patteson explain that the imperialist adventure novel involves exploration of uncharted regions by Europeans, which is essentially what this novel portrays.  Themes  = Imperialism = Colonial imperialism in the British Empire is prevalent through the idea that Christianity can be used to convert the colonies under England and make them more ‚Äúcivilized,‚Äù in other words, more British. New imperialism began in the last quarter of the 19th century when there was further expansion of British power, particularly in Africa and there was more emphasis on English forms of civilization. This new imperialism became known as the ‚ÄúBritish view of the world.‚Äù According to Richard F. Patteson, author of the article ‚ÄúManhood and Misogyny in the Imperialist Romance,‚Äù the imperialist romance flourished between 1880 and 1920 and, ‚Äúis essentially and adventure story involving the exploration by Europeans of previously uncharted regions.‚Äù He further claims that H. Rider Haggard first popularized this theme of imperialism in the form of romance and ultimately established a degree of influence.Patteson, Richard F. \\"Manhood and Misogyny in the Imperialist Romance.\\" Rocky Mountain Review of Language and Literature 35.1 (1981): 3-12. Print. This theme is seen in the novel in Reverend Owen's mission to convert the People of Fire to Christianity. He travels to a foreign place, which is also an African region of the British empire, in an effort to spread the word of the Christian God. This establishes the idea of new imperialism through the lens of the \\"British view of the world\\" by attempting to bring British values to foreign lands. = Christianity and Missionary Work in the 19th Century = Pastors from Britain completed the missionary work done in Africa during the 19th century, for the most part. They would seek to change the tribes ‚Äúsavage ways,‚Äù which in turn brought up the racism that is an underlying theme in many of Haggard's novels. The idea of the Christian God as the ultimate God and the idolatry seen in the novel underlies the theme of this missionary work. For example, the People of Fire idolatrize a rock and lightning, but Reverend Thomas Owen conquers this idolatry in the First and Second Trial by Fire, therefore proving that his God was the greatest and could conquer all. According to critique Richer Patteson, ‚ÄúThe Europeans' goals are usually ambivalent: the intention to convert the heathen or establish a benevolent order is frequently associated with an equally strong desire for wealth and power. Often the white men stumble upon ruins of an ancient civilization (presumed to be white), and just as often, they encounter two native factions - one \\"barbarous,\\" the other willing to be \\"civilized\\" by the European visitors.‚ÄùPatteson, Richard F. \\"Manhood and Misogyny in the Imperialist Romance.\\" Rocky Mountain Review of Language and Literature 35.1 (1981): 3-12. Print. = Female Authority and Sexuality (The New Woman) = The character Noma is an example of the New Woman and the idea that Haggard consistently portrays in many of his novels that in order to prevail in society, the New Woman must be stopped and then taught that her actions are not moral or correct. In late-Victorian Britain, women and womanhood was beneath manhood and were ‚Äúseen, not heard.‚Äù Noma seems to be the opposite of what a typical woman during this time period would be. She worshiped power and sought to become the most powerful by attempting to seduce two men (Hokosa and Hafela). Ultimately, however, this power struggle was her downfall that is a common trend in Haggard's novels. Haggard traditionally seemed to dislike women in power, so this downfall of Noma is seemingly typical of the novel. In addition, Noma's sex appeal is a theme that can be associated with the idea of the New Woman. She successfully seduces two men in the novel, both of which hold a position of power. Not only does she wish to obtain this power, but she is also attracted to sorcery and magic. Because this is her downfall, Haggard defeats the ‚ÄúNew Woman ideal‚Äù. According to Patteson, ‚ÄúFemale characters appear in all genres of popular literature, but the roles they are assigned seldom present women in a very favorable light. With the exception of the sentimental romance or \\"love story\\" - a form specifically aimed at a female audience - women do not usually figure as protagonists. Instead their function is to support, or to foil, the actions of male heroes in a variety of ways. Women are identified with the earth, while the men who bring light to various dark continents are linked to the sun, moon, and stars. Nearly every imperialist romance includes the hero's descent into a womb-like cave or mine shaft from which he usually escapes by summoning his \\"masculine\\" inner resources - courage, self-control, and ingenuity. One of the greatest dangers frequently faced by the explorers is power in the hands of a woman. This power is characteristically wielded through a combination of sexual enticement and maternal possessiveness. The fear and hatred of women evident everywhere in the imperialist romance can be explained partially, at least, by the imperialists' hunger for domination. Victorian imperialism was a masculine imperative. The most common complaint against women in the imperialist romance is their interference between friends. Not infrequently male friends are said to be bound by \\"'a love passing the love of a woman.\\"'12 Women threaten such friendships, and marriage is presented as a betrayal of male camaraderie.‚ÄùPatteson, Richard F. \\"Manhood and Misogyny in the Imperialist Romance.\\" Rocky Mountain Review of Language and Literature 35.1 (1981): 3‚Äì12.

According to Patricia Murphy, author of the article ‚ÄúThe Gendering of History in She,‚Äù the New Woman is another manifestation of all women, whose dangerous effects upon men replicate those of her mythic counterparts. She explains that discourse on time play an important role in the construction of gender positions in late-century novels responding to the New Woman, such as Haggard's novels.Murphy, Patricia. \\"The Gendering of History in She.\\" SEL: Studies in English Literature 1500‚Äì1900 39.4 (1999): 747‚Äì72.

In 1965, Haggard was called a writer of a consistently high level of ‚Äúliterary skill and sheer imaginative power‚Äù by Roger Lancelyn Green, one of the Oxford Inklings.H. Rider Haggard Anne McClintock and Laura Chrisman, both critiques, read Haggard as an important indicator of public opinion on African matters and a representative of the British imperial presence in southern Africa. Monsman, another critique, referred to many of the films made from Haggard's African novels and suggests that Haggard was ‚Äúa century ahead of popular cultural curve.‚ÄùGerald, Monsman. \\"H. Rider Haggard on the Imperial Frontier: The Political and Literary Contexts of His African Romances.\\" Choice Reviews Online 44.03 (2006): 44-1395. Print. In addition, Patrick Brantlinger claims that Haggard's novel is an adolescent quality that permeates most imperialist literature, ‚Äúas it would fascist culture in the 1920s and 1930s.‚Äù Africa was a setting where British boys could become men and British men, like Haggard's heroes, could behave like boys with license. Africa was a great testing ground for moral growth and moral deterioration. It forms part of a genre of 'innocent' adventure fiction, designed for the white man or boy, and promising the absence of petticoats and conventional romance.Stott, Rebecca. \\"The Dark Continent: Africa as Female Body in Haggard's Adventure Fiction.\\" Feminist Review 32 (1989): 69-89.

He was Hildalgo's ‚Äúright hand‚Äù and rose to become the agent for the soccer star Juan Sebasti√°n Ver√≥n. He was later able to leave HAZ and form his own businesses, reportedly partly due to his connections with Kirchner, whom Pires has described as a ‚Äúgood friend,‚Äù and businessman L√°zaro B√°ez.http://www.eldia.com.ar/edis/20130520/Vinculan- Miguel-√Ångel-Pires-negocios-Kirchner-Lazaro-Baez-20130520112236.html Pires gained the support and confidence of B√°ez after having befriended the latter's son. Through B√°ez, he met M√°ximo Kirchner, son of the then and current presidents, and as a result he met N√©stor Kirchner himself. Between 2009 and 2010, Pires established the firms MP Sports SA, Building Sports SA, and PIRVI SA Paralelamente. He formed these businesses together with his then boyfriend, Cristian Villalba. Pires works, or has worked, as an agent for many major Argentinian soccer players, including Nelson Ben√≠tez, Mat√≠as S√°nchez, Mauricio Carrasco, Agust√≠n Ori√≥n, Pablo Lug√ºercio, Juan Sebasti√°n Ver√≥n, Gast√≥n Fern√°ndez, Maximiliano N√∫√±ez, Jonatan Silva, Mauricio Carrasco, and Mariano Gonz√°lez. He is closely connected to the team Estudiantes.http://www.infobae.com/2012/02/09/631172-el-prestamo-enzo-perez- lo-pago-la-brujita-veron Before becoming involved directly with Kirchner, Pires was reportedly engaged in a money-laundering operation with B√°ez that involved the Racing Club. The Seprin website reported in 2012 that ‚Äúat least 8 very important politicians washed money via the transfer of players and this is the basis of the fortune of Miguel Pires y Cristian Villalba.‚Äù The site outlined in detail Pires' involvement in the sale and purchase of players and money laundering, and his ties with B√°ez. Seprin also stated that the Fiscal Investigative Unit had been looking into Pires‚Äô finances, but did not look beyond his financial dealings with B√°ez and other principals in this particular case. In May 2013, journalist Jorge Lanata of the television program Periodismo Para Todos (Journalism for All) charged in a now-famous report on high-level government corruption that Pires, when selling the contracts of various soccer players to the team Racing, had been serving as a front man for Kirchner and Kirchner's son M√°ximo, in accordance with an arrangement made with them and Baez in 2005. Among the players were Marcos C√°ceres, Pablo Lug√ºercio, Leandro Gonz√°lez,http://opisantacruz.com.ar/home/2013/05/20/ahora-a-lazaro-le- aparece-%E2%80%9Cotro-farina%E2%80%9D-miguel-√Ångel-pires-amigo-de-martin-y- daniel-alvarez-funcionario-municipal/16281 Rub√©n Ram√≠rez, Nicol√°s Cabrera, Pablo Lug√ºercio, Gabriel Mercado, and Nicol√°s Pellerano. The purchases had allegedly been a way of laundering money and are considered an important part of the web of corruption surrounding the administrations of Kirchner and his wife, Cristina Fern√°ndez de Kirchner, known as the ‚ÄúK money trail.‚Äù Lanata said that Pires had become a millionaire ‚Äúovernight‚Äù due to his connections with B√°ez and Kirchner, who each had given him money to buy players and enabled him to lead a luxurious life. Pires, who had grown up in a poor neighborhood, now lived in a fashionable part of Buenos Aires and drove Porsches and Ferraris, Lanata revealed. Lanata suggested that Pires had prospered not only as a result of money laundering, but also through overpricing, bribes, and other illegal activities. A writer for OPI (Organizaci√≥n Period√≠stica Independiente) Santa Cruz opined that the transgressions by Pires and others that had been revealed so far by Lanata appeared to represent ‚Äúthe tip of the iceberg of‚Ä¶an enormous mass of corruption‚Äù that remained to be uncovered. Pires was in a relationship with Cristian Vallaba for eighteen years. He left Vallaba in November 2012 to be in a relationship with Julio Coronel.http://elsensacional.infonews.com/nota/farina-el-nuevo-roviralta- gay/http://miguepires.blogspot.com/ Coronel was formerly the partner of celebrated Argentinian actor and entrepreneur Ricardo Fort, who died in 2013 and whose family owns a major confectionery company. The day after Lanata's report aired, Fort spoke to Lanata on Radio Mitre, telling him that Pires had given Julio ‚Äúeverything he had with me: cars, credit cards, travel.‚Äù The difference, Fort said, was that his own money had been honestly earned by his family, while Pires's money had been ‚Äústolen from the people.‚Äù Fort noted that while Pires said he did not wish to be known, Julio had posted on Facebook photos of the Lamborghini he had just bought in Miami. Fort also said that he had received threats by phone and text message, presumably from people connected with Pires, who bragged ‚Äúthat they had very strong government connections‚Äù and that they would do something to me.‚Äù It was reported in January 2014 that Pires, who was in the middle of a legal struggle over Vallaba‚Äôs assets, including ‚Äúapartments and houses worth millions of dollars,‚Äù had ‚Äútaken refuge‚Äù in Miami in the wake of the money-laundering scandal. ‚ÄúHe cannot set foot on Argentinian soil,‚Äù said a source close to Pires, because if he does, he will ‚Äúend up behind bars.‚Äù The source added that Vallaba was in possession of ‚Äúvery strong pieces of evidence that could harm him and leave him much worse off than he is now.‚Äù Personal life Pires is openly gay and his relationships with Vallaba and Coronel have made him a subject of considerable attention in the Argentinian gossip columns.http://www.laconceptradio.com/2013/03/continua-mas-gay-que-nunca-la- novela-de.html Pires has a home in Miami and an apartment in calle Viamonte in Buenos Aires.

During its peak years (19151930), the Standard was one of Philadelphia's most famous and successful black theaters. Its exceptional success can be attributed to its owner, John T. Gibson, an African-American man who envisioned affordable entertainment for people of color.  Opening  The Standard Theatre (or Standard Theater) originally opened in 1888 on the 1100 block of South Street. The Standard was primarily a venue for local and traveling vaudeville programs.Brian E. Alnutt, African-American Amusement and Recreation in Philadelphia, 18761926 (PhD diss., Lehigh University, 2003), 224. The Standard was located near Philadelphia's neighborhoods with the highest black population: for instance, 23% of Philadelphia's African-American citizens lived in the 7th ward of South Philadelphia alone.Alnutt, African-American Amusement and Recreation, 93. The theater would occasionally showcase African- American productions, such as in November 1897, when the theater presented Bob Cole and William Johnson's A Trip to Coontown, a musical created and performed by African-American men.Alnutt, African-American Amusement and Recreation, 95. In spite of this, the Standard maintained segregated admissions, alienating many of the African-American residents in the neighborhood. Before 1914, the Standard Theatre had seen occasional yet sporadic African-American ownership. For example, a group of African-American investors from New York City led by Gibson Young leased the theater in 1913, with the promise of \\"altogether coloured management.\\" In spite of its initial great success, business declined. By that October the Standard was again leased to non-African- Americans, which returned to practicing segregation. This was a great emotional loss to the African-American community, who saw the Standard Theater finally becoming a site of entertainment for their own color.Alnutt, African- American Amusement and Recreation, 132.

In an interview almost two years after his purchase, Gibson said the following: \\"When I bought the New Standard theater, I felt that there was a field in this city for good clean Negro vaudeville at popular prices.\\"J.H. Gray \\"Gibson's Standard Theatre\\" The Freeman (Indianapolis: 10/09/1915) Gibson's premiere show opened with J. Lubrie Hill's Darktown Follies, a musical comedy featuring Southern rural characters. The Freeman described the event as a \\"decided success\\", and one that \\"Philadelphia can be proud of... the citizens will rally around Manager Gibson.\\" The original ticket prices ranged from 25 cents to $1.00.J.H. Gray \\"Gibson's Standard Theatre\\" The Freeman (Indianapolis: 01/31/1914) In May, Gibson officially bought the Standard, becoming its sale owner and manager.

Gray \\"Gibson's Standard Theatre\\" The Freeman (Indianapolis: 05/23/1914) In its first two years, the Standard Theatre presented a variety of performances at low cost. The musical repertoire included southern folk songs, antebellum plantation songs, vaudeville numbers, musicals, and blues. The theater also showed fantastic performances, including magicians, acrobats, and animal performances. For example, a performance in February 1915 featured the Monkey Cabaret Orchestra, consisting of eight monkeys in the orchestra who accompanied more monkeys performing on stage with a dog.J.H. Gray \\"Gibson's Standard Theatre\\" The Freeman (Indianapolis: 02/06/1915) Gibson took pride in his performers.

Gray \\"Gibson's Standard Theatre\\" The Freeman (Indianapolis: 08/14/1915) In November 1915, Gibson finished renovations on the Standard Theatre. The renovations included newly painted interior, gilded ceilings, and increased seating to 2,000. While renovating his theater, Gibson employed African-American painters, artists, and construction workers in his efforts to spread wealth among the African-American citizens in the area.J.H. Gray \\"Gibson's Standard Theatre\\" The Freeman (Indianapolis: 11/06/1915) After this point, Gibson claimed to have a standing offer for $180,000 for the theater, which he regularly declined: \\"Commercialism has nothing whatever to go with my project,\\" he said. \\"My idea is to give my people the best of it all the time.\\"J.H.

The Standard Theater was one of only 59 theaters owned by a single person in Philadelphia. The Washington Bee credited his success to his optimism loyalty to African-Americans: \\"Despite his great wealth, Mr. Gibson is a race man. His affections are remarkably developed. His heart is large. It is necessary at times to retrain his willingness. He is an apostle of optimism. His wide, his home, his theater, his city, his state, his country are the finest.

Gibson, \\"The Richest Colored Man in Pennsylvania\\" The Washington Bee (D.C.: 06/06/1918)  1920s  During the 1920s, the Standard Theatre peaked in its success. A major factor in this success was increased ticket sales. Massive audience turnouts resulted in part from new waves of African-American Philadelphians. In the beginning of the twentieth century, millions of African-American Americans fled to northern cities, escaping southern segregation and Jim Crow laws. This movement became known as the Great Migration. In the 1910s, Philadelphia's African-American population increased by 50%, reading a total of 134,220. This growth continued through the twenties, reaching 219,559 by 1930.Matthew J. Countryman, \\"Why Philadelphia?\\" Civil Rights in a Northern City: Philadelphia, http://northerncity.library.temple.edu/content/historical-perspective/why- philadelphia Newly arrived performers and audience members alike sought out theaters that hired and catered to African-American Philadelphians. In the early 1920s, the Standard embodied African-American entertainment in Philadelphia. Gibson responded to growing audiences and monetary success by purchasing the nearby Dunbar Theater in 1921.\\"Standard Theatre Historical Marker,\\" Explore PA History, last modified 2011, http://explorepahistory.com/hmarker.php?markerId=1-A-62 In the 1920s, jazz flourished in Philadelphia. Jazz music infiltrated the mainstream music culture, receiving praise from more conventional musicians. For instance, the conductor of the Philadelphia Orchestra Leopold Stokowski compared jazz music to \\"the injection of new... blood into a dying aristocracy.\\"Russell L. Johnson, \\"'Disease Is Unrhythmical': Jazz, Health, and Disability in 1920s America,\\" Health and History 13, no. 2 (2011): 29. As jazz music became more recognized as socially respectable music, the Standard's audiences became more integrated as non-African-Americans Philadelphians came to more shows. While the shows had always been integrated, the increased number of non-African- American audience members contributed to Gibson's high earnings. Perhaps reacting to the influx of non-African-American audience members, African- American critics began to change their tastes in performances. Sandy Burns, a comedian who specialized in blackface performance, received rave reviews from Freeman papers in the teens. But by 1926, his performance received scathing reviews, and he was criticized as \\"a past master at portraying the old razor- slashing Negro.\\"Alnutt, African-American Amusement and Recreation, 255. While vaudeville comedy still lit the stage, Gibson changed his focus to musical performers, specifically big bands. It is during this period that The Standard Theater showcased some of the top names in jazz at the time. In 1927, Duke Ellington and his Washingtonians performed for two weeks at the Standard Theatre.Mark Tucker, The Duke Ellington Reader (Oxford: University of Oxford Press, 1993), 241. In December 1929, Louis Armstrong performed in the Standard, fronting for the Luis Russell Band.James Lincoln Collier, Louis Armstrong: An American Genius (Oxford: Oxford University Press, 1983), 218. Following Ellington and Armstrong's lead, numerous big band leaders added the Standard as a stopping point on their tours.  Closing  Standard Theatre Historical Marker In 1931, Gibson sold the Standard Theatre due to his losses from the Great Depression. As big band music began its decline, the Standard Theater was turned into a movie theater, losing its performance space for live musicians and performers. The theater officially closed in 1954 and was demolished in 1957. In 1992, the Pennsylvania Historical & Museum Commission placed a historical marker to commemorate the theater and its owner. It is placed at the theater's original location, on the 11th block of South Street.\\"Standard Theatre Historical Marker,\\" Explore PA History, last modified 2011, http://explorepahistory.com/hmarker.php?markerId=1-A-62  Other notable performers  A young Ethel Waters found inspiration in the performances she saw at the Standard. Early in her career, she often imitated acts she had seen when performing in other cities. In 1917, she returned to Philadelphia and performed at the Standard: \\"My return to Philadelphia turned into something of a triumph when we were booked for two weeks at the Standard Theatre, where I'd watched shows from the peanut gallery. It was still the city's leading Negro showhouse, and the engagement meant I was recognized in my home town as an established professional performer.\\"Ethel Waters, \\"His Eye is on the Sparrow: An Autobiography\\" (De Capo Press, 1992), 107. Although Waters moved to New York in 1919, she would still perform at the Standard whenever she passed through Philadelphia, most notably performing for a week in June 1928.Alnutt, \\"African-American Amusement and Recreation,\\" 253. The Whitman Sisters consisted of four sisters (Essie, Mabel, Alberta, and Baby Alice) who performed vaudeville routines all along the eastern coast. Their acts included tap dancing, musical numbers, comedy sketches, and crossdressing. The Whitman Sisters regularly performed at the Standard throughout the late teens as the star act of the show.\\"The Whitman Sisters,\\" American Vaudeville Museum, last modified 2011, http://www.vaudeville.org/profiles_Q_Z/index_files/Page1126.htm Bessie Smith began to regularly perform at the Standard in 1923.

Moved to the front soon after, it helped defend the Soviet lines west of the Ukrainian capital for more than a month, but was then destroyed in the encirclement of Kiev. A new division was formed in early 1942. It served in the early fighting against the German summer offensive of 1942 until its losses forced it to be withdrawn for rebuilding. In September it was redeployed, and played a leading role in defending the northern part of the central city and Mamayev Kurgan hill in the Battle of Stalingrad, and later in the reduction of the trapped German 6th Army during Operation Ring, for which it was raised to Guards status as the 79th Guards Rifle Division shortly after the battle ended. A third 284th was raised a few months later. It served on the quiet fronts of the Far East for most of the rest of the war before fighting briefly against the Japanese in Manchuria in August, 1945. The unit continued to serve well into the postwar period under other designations.  1st Formation  The division began forming on July 10, 1941, at Romny in the Kharkov Military District.Walter S. Dunn, Jr., Stalin's Keys to Victory, Stackpole Books, Mechanicsburg, PA, 2006, p. 77. The commanding officer, Col. Gennady Petrovich Pankov, was appointed the same day; he would lead the division throughout its 1st Formation. Its basic order of battle was as follows: * 1043rd Rifle Regiment * 1045th Rifle Regiment * 1047th Rifle Regiment * 820th Artillery Regiment.Charles C. Sharp, \\"Red Tide\\", Soviet Rifle Divisions Formed From June to December, 1941, Soviet Order of Battle World War II, Vol. IX, 1996, p. 61 Just three weeks after forming the 284th was railed to the Kiev Defense Sector. By August 12 it was assigned to 37th Army of Southwestern Front, and helped to defend the direct approaches to Kiev for the next month,David Stahel, Kiev 1941, Cambridge University Press, Cambridge, UK, 2012, map on p. 210 but this left it hopelessly trapped when the German forces linked up far east of Kiev in September. The division was effectively destroyed later that month, although it was not officially removed from the Soviet order of battle until December 27.Sharp, Red Tide, p. 61  2nd Formation  On December 15 a new rifle division, the 443rd, began forming at Tomsk in the Siberian Military District. Kombrig Sergei Aleksandrovich Ostroumov was given command on that date. On January 27, 1942 it was re- designated as the new 284th Rifle Division.Dunn, Jr., Stalin's Keys, p. 99 With most of its personnel of Siberian origin, it became known unofficially as the ‚ÄúTomsk‚Äù division, although there were also large numbers of men from Novosibirsk and Kemerovo as well.Jochen Hellbeck, Stalingrad, trans. C. Tauchen & D. Bonfiglio, Perseus Books Group, Philadelphia, PA, 2015, p. 331 Its order of battle remained the same as the 1st Formation. =Operation Blue= The unit spent about three months in training in Siberia before being sent to the front. On February 27, Col. Nikolai Filippovich Batyuk took command, which he would hold for the remainder of the 2nd Formation. The division was assigned to the new 48th Army in Bryansk Front. When Operation Blue began on June 28 it had not yet arrived in that Army, and was under direct command of the Front.Combat Composition of the Soviet Army, 1942, p. 125 In the first two days of the offensive a gap about 40 km wide and 35‚Äì40 km deep was torn in the Front's defenses by the 4th Panzer Army. As a fresh unit, the 284th was ordered into the gap, along with the 1st Destroyer (Antitank) Division, to set up an all-around defense at Kastornoye. By June 30 the two divisions were defending the town with \\"exceptional stubbornness\\". On July 3 they came under further attack from 9th Panzer Division, which elected to bypass to the south of the position, forcing the Soviet units to withdraw northeastwards to avoid encirclement. However, even with more antitank assets on hand than usual, the 284th took considerable losses during its retreat. By July 14 it regained the Soviet lines northwest of Voronezh. Within days it was subordinated to Operational Group Chibisov, which was formed from assets of Bryansk Front under command of the Front's deputy commander, Maj. Gen. Nikandr Evlampievich Chibisov. The plan was for this Group to attack the German 2nd Army in a salient west of Voronezh. It was intended to begin on July 17 but in the event was put back to the 21st.David M. Glantz, To the Gates of Stalingrad, University Press of Kansas, Lawrence, KS, 2009, pp. 111, 132, 135, 143-44, 253-55 The division was in a very poor condition to support this offensive. On July 20 division commissar Tkachenko reported its state as follows: The commissar went on to urgently request vehicles (including ambulances, of which there were none), small arms and support weapons, draught horses, and a closer supply base. After the first day of fighting Tkachenko further reported that the lack of high-explosive shells forced the artillery to fire armor-piercing rounds at enemy firing points and troops; there were no cartridges for the submachine guns; many of the men's uniforms and footwear were worn out; and it was impossible to commit the replacements into the fighting because of the lack of weapons.Igor Sdvizhkov, Confronting Case Blue, ed. & trans. S. Britton, Helion & Co., Ltd., Solihull, UK, 2017, p. 26 The 284th was the right-flank division of the Group; 340th Rifle Division was on its left. On July 21 the division, stretched over a wide sector and with no armor support, made no progress at all, and was accused by the commander of the 340th of failing to attack. On the following day, as the 340th began to make some progress southwards, it became more difficult to keep contact with the 284th. General Chibisov decided to solve the problem by committing his fresh reserve 237th Rifle Division, backed by the 201st Tank Brigade, into the gap. Beginning its attack on the morning of July 23, the commander of the 237th later complained of getting no support from its flanking units, and that some of the 284th had even pulled back. By the next day the Germans had brought in their backstop, the 9th Panzer Division, directly threatening the green 237th. Colonel Batyuk, watching the armor deploying from a distance, noted its openly intimidating nature, observing, \\"All of the enemy's actions were designed to affect morale.\\" He further reported: Batyuk reported losses of 20 men killed, more than 150 wounded, and 16 missing in action, plus three guns damaged and under repair. He also reported around 14 knocked-out or burned-out German tanks in front of his positions.Sdvizhkov, Case Blue, pp. 118-20, 127, 155-56, 164-65, 170 Just after midnight on July 25 Batyuk was ordered to go on the attack once again at 0500, but this effort again made little impression. The division tried again on the 26th, and gained a little ground towards Spasskoe before being forced back to its start line. This was its last attempt; the division's ranks were extremely thin, although morale remained strong. On July 29 the offensive ended, and within days the 284th was pulled from the line,Sdvizhkov, Case Blue, pp. 177, 291-92 arriving in Sverdlovsk in early August for rebuilding.Sharp, \\"Red Swarm\\", Soviet Rifle Divisions Formed From 1942 to 1945, Soviet Order of Battle World War II, Vol. X, Nafziger, 1996, p. 108 A large number of the needed replacements were recruited locally, but the division also received several thousand sailors from the Pacific Fleet.Hellbeck, Stalingrad, p. 331 =Defense of Stalingrad= On August 31 the restored division was in 4th Reserve Army, located 250‚Äì350 km northwest of Stalingrad. Less than ten days earlier, the first forces of German 6th Army had reached the Volga River north of the city. On September 17 the division was assigned to 62nd Army and began arriving on the east bank, its first elements crossing the Volga in the early morning of the 21st. The 284th's initial assignment would be to fill the gap between the 95th Rifle Division, which had begun crossing the day before and was responsible for the defense of Mamayev Kurgan, and the 13th Guards Rifle Division, which had been desperately defending the city center over the past few days. Although the division was back up to a strength of about 10,000 men, it was still lacking weapons, and on arrival only the 1043rd Rifle Regiment was completely equipped, so it was the first to cross. It was briefly held in reserve, before moving forward to relieve the exhausted troops of the 112th Rifle Division from Mamayev Kurgan to the Krutoi Ravine. On September 22, two regiments of the German 295th Infantry Division pierced the defenses of the 112th and reached the west bank of the Volga at several points \\"after difficult fighting.\\" Later in the day the now-armed 1047th and 1045th Rifle Regiments arrived in time to drive back these tenuous footholds.Glantz, Armageddon in Stalingrad, University Press of Kansas, Lawrence, KS, 2009, pp. 37, 136, 156, 199-201 Col. N.F. Batyuk (holding the phone) in his headquarters with members of his staffIt was the intention of Lt. Gen. Vasili Ivanovich Chuikov, commander of 62nd Army, to counterattack the German positions with his newly-arrived forces, but these efforts came to very little. By the end of the day on September 25, the 284th reported a total strength of 7,648 men. It was deployed as follows: \\"1047th Rifle Regiment is along the northern bank of the Krutoi Ravine, with its right flank anchored on the line of the railroad to Artemovskaia Street. 1043rd Rifle Regiment is fighting along the (incl.) Artemovskaia Street line, with its left flank at the line of the railroad to the northern bank of the ravine (east of Nekrasovskaia Street). The 1045th Rifle Regiment is in the army's reserve.\\" The division would remain in this general area, between the central city core and the main factory district, for the remainder of the battle.Glantz, Armageddon, pp. 209, 213, 244 6th Army renewed its offensive on September 27, now driving on the factory district, but also attempting to clear Mamayev Kurgan on the way. 95th Rifle Division was badly hit by the relatively fresh 100th J√§ger Division and lost most of the hill. Meanwhile, the 100th J√§ger's 369th Croatian Regiment joined with the 516th Regiment of the 295th Division to assault the defenses of the 1045th Regiment southeast of the hill, penetrate into the \\"Tennis Racquet\\" region and seize the Meat Combine (abattoir). The remaining regiments of the 295th were to attack eastwards along the Dolgii and Krutoi Ravines, crush the 1043rd and 1047th Regiments, and reach the Volga, cutting 62nd Army in half. Stiff and often fanatical resistance by all three regiments stopped these drives well short of their goals. The division lost about 300 men killed or wounded during the day.Glantz, Armageddon, pp. 254-55, 269 The 95th Rifle Division, supported by two battalions of the 1045th Regiment and massive air strikes by 8th Air Army, counterattacked Mamayev Kurgan on September 29 and retook the survey marker near the crest, although they were stopped short of the water tank at the very top. Apart from this, the rest of the division was deployed abreast from north to south, defending a strip of land from the south slope of the Kurgan to its left boundary with 13th Guards. This all came at a cost, and by the evening of October 1 the 284th was reduced to a strength of 3,496 men. On October 3 a renewed attack by the 295th Infantry drove the forces of the 95th and 284th off the north slope of the hill and back through the Military Clothing Factory to positions on the south bank of the Bannyi Ravine. However, similar attacks against the main positions of the division made no progress; the 295th had also taken many losses. For several days a lull in the fighting set in, and on October 9 the 284th was ordered to occupy the sector held by two regiments of the 95th so they could be redeployed to the factory district. During this time the division received replacements and men returned from hospitals and aid stations, and on October 10 reported a strength of 5,907 men, making it the second-strongest division in 62nd Army after 13th Guards, which was being replenished by the same means.Glantz, Armageddon, pp. 280, 282, 289, 323-24, 351, 371 Lt. Gen. V.I. Chuikov (left), commander of 62nd Army, and Lt. Gen. K.A. Gurov, army commissar, examine Sgt. V.G. Zaitsev's sniper rifle.During October, a senior sergeant of the 2nd Battalion, 1047th Rifle Regiment, Vasili Grigorievich Zaitsev, was brought to Colonel Batyuk's attention. Zaitsev was one of the replacements transferred from the Pacific Fleet in August and was gaining a reputation as a highly effective sharpshooter with the standard Mosin‚ÄìNagant rifle.Frank Ellis, The Stalingrad Cauldron: Inside the Encirclement and Destruction of the 6th Army, University Press of Kansas, Lawrence, KS, 2013, p. 272 Batyuk recommended him for sniper training, and later ordered him to set up a sniper training school of his own. Before being wounded in January, 1943, Zaitsev was credited with an estimated 300 kills, and became a Hero of the Soviet Union in March.Glantz, Armageddon, p. 713 The German offensive was renewed on October 17 in the factory district, and as a result of the 308th and 138th Rifle Divisions falling back near the Barrikady Factory, General Chuikov was forced to relocate his headquarters to a bunker south of the Bannyi Ravine, about 800 metres east of the 284th's front line trenches. It would remain in this position for the duration of the battle. On October 20 Chuikov reinforced a counterattack towards the Barrikady with a battalion of the 1043rd Regiment; he now enjoyed some flexibility in employing his scant reserves. In his after action report on October 24, Chuikov reported: An advance by the 14th Panzer Division in the Khvost Ravine south of the Barrikady on October 27 threatened the ferry landing where the 45th Rifle Division was crossing the Volga. Chuikov had to build a counterattack force from staff and rear services, 30 men recently discharged from aid stations, and three patched-up tanks to retake lost ground. Meanwhile, the 6th Company of 1045th Regiment reinforced the defenses of the 193rd Rifle Division's 895th Regiment along Dolinskaya and Umanskaia Streets. On November 1 the main body of the 284th continued to hold its primary position, a front 3,600 metres wide and from 100 ‚Äì 800 metres deep, the deepest frontage now that the 6th Army held 90 percent of the city. Since this sector was not under German attack in November, the division contributed with assault groups which attacked enemy pillboxes and dugouts, especially at night. It also repulsed an attack up the Bannyi Ravine by a company of enemy infantry on November 10. On the same day, two battalions of the 92nd Rifle Brigade crossed the Volga into the 284th's sector to join the 1043rd Regiment in second echelon; Chuikov feared a major German attack on the Chemical Factory, which never occurred.Glantz, Armageddon, pp. 511, 608-09, 629, 632 In the following days German 6th Army made what turned out to be its final bid for the factory district. The Krasnyi Oktiabr plant was mostly in German hands, and Batyuk was ordered \\"to allocate part of its 1043rd Regiment to relieve the left wing battalion of 112th [Guards] Regiment (39th Guards Rifle Division) on the night of November 12‚Äì13 and prepare its sector for a firm defense.\\" By the end of the 13th, the division probably had no more than 1,200 men remaining on the west bank, although the official total reported by 62nd Army on November 20 was 4,696. That last date is significant, as the day previous the Soviet forces outside the city began Operation Uranus.Glantz, Armageddon, pp. 660, 670, 701 =Operation Uranus= Lt. Gen. V.I. Chuikov and Col. N.F. Batyuk observe the battlefield, December, 1942Chuikov was under orders to continue to take the fight to the enemy so as to assist the counterattacking forces outside. On November 21, the 1047th and 1045th Regiments, supported by part of the 92nd Rifle Brigade, launched an attack at 1400 which retook the crest of Mamayev Kurgan from 100th J√§ger Division. Further attacks on the next day again failed to take the water tank. On the 23rd the assault on the hill made only minor gains, as did an attack towards the Krasnyi Oktiabr. After a break of 24 hours, the best the division could do on the Kurgan was to improve its positions slightly. On November 29 the 284th lost 105 men killed or wounded in similar efforts; furthermore the 62nd Army was suffering severe shortages of supplies due to the partly-frozen Volga, and on the 30th it was finally ordered to go over to the defense.Glantz, Endgame in Stalingrad, Book One, University Press of Kansas, Lawrence, KS, 2014, pp. 288, 294, 333, 367, 461, 508 Further attacks on the hill took place on December 3. On that day, 295th Infantry Division reported 78 casualties, but the 284th made no significant gains in territory and was now down to an estimated strength of 1,500 men. The fighting was halted once again until December 14, when the division struck again, this time at 100th J√§ger, with similar results. On the 28th a larger effort was ordered, involving the 45th Rifle, 39th Guards Rifle, and 284th Rifle Divisions, plus 92nd Rifle Brigade, to drive the Germans off the hill and away from the Krasnyi Oktiabr and the southern half of its workers' settlement area. This failed to reach its goals, but made gains against a weakened enemy.Glantz, Endgame in Stalingrad, Book Two, University Press of Kansas, Lawrence, KS, 2014, pp. 168-69, 204, 355 =Operation Ring= During the first ten days of January, 1943, the 284th, along with the divisions and brigade above, and later joined by 95th Rifle Division, made preparations for Operation Ring, the reduction of the German pocket. This involved reconnaissance, seizing and holding individual buildings, and destroying enemy firing points and bunkers. Also during this period Chuikov redeployed the 348th MG-Artillery Battalion of the 156th Fortified Region into the city along the Dolgii Ravine between the 284th and 13th Guards; this allowed Batyuk's troops to consolidate on a shorter line. When Ring began on January 10 the division's specific mission was to attack with all three rifle regiments abreast to take Mamayev Kurgan and destroy the enemy units there. In the event, although the water tank was finally taken, the desperate German defenses held.Glantz, Endgame, Book Two, pp. 415-17, 444-46 Over the next few days, further transfers from 156th Fortified Region allowed 13th Guards to redeploy northwards onto the right flank of the 284th. By nightfall on January 17, additional gains had expanded the area of 62nd Army's bridgehead in the city by about 50 percent. A lull set in over the next few days, but on January 22 Chuikov ordered his men back to the attack, but again only limited gains were made. The final act began on January 26, when Don Front renewed its offensive along its entire line. The 284th and 13th Guards were carefully briefed with recognition signals and radio call signs to secure a smooth link-up with 21st Army, which came at 1100 on the 284th's sector. The German pocket was now cut in two, and the division was assigned to help reduce the south pocket. Attacking alongside the 52nd Guards Rifle Division of 21st Army on the 28th the men of the 284th drove their old foes of the 295th and 100th J√§ger Divisions back to the southern bank of Dolgii Ravine.Glantz, Endgame, Book Two, pp. 492, 516, 530-32, 546 On January 30 the division, now together with 173rd Rifle Division, pressed southward towards the northern part of the city's center. An advance of more than a kilometre broke the back of the 295th's defenses and penetrated to the northern edge of 9th January Square and the western end of Solnechnaia Street. On the 31st the 284th captured the square and linked up with troops of 64th Army. On the same day, Field Marshal Friedrich Paulus surrendered his 6th Army, but the north pocket continued to hold out. Showing remarkable stamina, the division rejoined 62nd Army to join its attack there on February 1. It teamed up with 45th Rifle Division and the 34th Guards Regiment of 13th Guards, and was reinforced with engineer tanks and an antitank regiment, with the objective to seize the worker's village of the Barrikady factory, and then into the rear of Bread Factory No. 2. As so often before, the gains made that day were minimal, but it made little difference as the German forces in the pocket laid down their arms on the morning of February 2. While most of the divisions of 62nd Army were transferred in the next few weeks, the 284th (soon redesignated 79th Guards Rifle Division) would remain in 62nd Army (soon redesignated 8th Guards Army) for the duration of the war and into the postwar era.Glantz, Endgame, Book Two, pp. 550, 557, 563, 567-68, 577 General Chuikov acknowledged the performance of the 284th as among the best in his Army,Glantz states that 13th Guards got \\"greater praise and attention\\" in Soviet accounts of the battle because Rodimtsev was Russian while Batyuk was Ukrainian. Armageddon, p. 753 and also had rough praise for Batyuk:Following the surrender of 6th Army, on February 8 the division was awarded the Order of the Red Banner for \\"exemplary fulfillment of command tasks\\" and its \\"valor and courage\\". On March 1, in further recognition of the division's prowess both on the defense and during the offensive that crushed the trapped German force, it was redesignated as the 79th Guards Rifle Division.Sharp, Red Swarm, p. 108  3rd Formation  The final 284th Rifle Division was one of six new divisions formed in the Transbaikal in July, 1943. Its order of battle remained the same as the first two formations. Col. Vasilii Stepanovich Elikhov was assigned to command on July 15. It served in the Transbaikal Front, in 17th Army, for the duration. Colonel Elikhov was replaced by Col. Aslan Usupovich Badzhelidze on April 21, 1945. When the Soviet Union declared war on Japan on August 9, 1945, the division joined in the advance into Manchuria. This advance was mostly unopposed, and this formation of the 284th saw very little, if any, combat.Sharp, Red Swarm, p. 108 For its efforts, the division was awarded the honorific Khingan. In October, 1945, the division became the 14th Mechanized Division at Nerchinsk, part of the 6th Guards Tank Army. On June 4, 1957, it was redesignated as the 89th Motor Rifle Division.

Origin of name  The name \\"Barri√®re d'Enfer\\" comes from the street \\"Rue d'Enfer\\" (now called \\"Rue Denfert-Rochereau) which leads there after crossing the Rue de Faubourg-Saint Jacques. Some historians think the street was named because it was \\"a place of debauchery and robbery\\", while others believe that the name comes from a corruption of the Latin via inferior (in contrast with Rue Saint- Jacques, which was known as the via superior). According to Michel Roblin, the name may be derived from the nickname en fer (\\"of iron\\") given to a door on the Wall of Philip II Augustus.  History  The two neo-classical pavilions that make up the Barri√®re were built in 1787 by the architect Claude Nicolas Ledoux, both of which exist still. The buildings are decorated by friezes depicting dancers sculpted by Jean Guillaume Moitte. The tollhouses was designed for collecting the octroi, or taxes on goods entering the city. The main streets originating from the Barri√®re d'Enfer were the Boulevard d'Enfer (now a part of the Boulevard Raspail), the Rue d'Enfer, and the Boulevard Saint-Jacques. The third act of the opera La Boh√®me by Giacomo Puccini portrays Mimi leaving the city via the Barri√®re d'Enfer to visit a tavern. The Barri√®re is also mentioned in Victor Hugo's novel Les Mis√©rables: :\\"How did those children come there? Perhaps they had escaped from some guardhouse which stood ajar; perhaps in the vicinity, at the barri√®re d'Enfer, or on the esplanade de l'Observatoire, or in the neighboring carrefour, dominated by the pediment on which could be read: invenerunt parvulum pannis involutum [\\"they discovered the infant wrapped in swaddling clothes\\"], there was some mountebank's booth from which they had fled [‚Ä¶].\\" One of the buildings that defines the Barri√®re d'Enfer.  Description  The Barri√®re consists of two identical buildings on either side of the Avenue du Colonel-Henri-Rol-Tanguy, which is itself located along the axis of the Avenue Denfert-Rochereau and Avenue du G√©n√©ral-Leclerc. The entrance to the catacombs at the eastern pavilion. * No. 3 (the eastern building) is the building of the Inspector General of Quarries. The entrance to the Catacombs of Paris is located next to building No. 1. * No. 4 (the western building) houses of the Highway Service. Beneath the building starting in August 1944 were the headquarters of Colonel Henri Rol-Tanguy, from which he gave orders pertaining to the French Resistance and the Liberation of Paris. In commemoration of this, a portion of the Place Denfert-Rochereau between the two buildings was renamed avenue du Colonel-Henri-Rol-Tanguy on the 15th of March 2004, on the sixtieth anniversary of the Liberation of Paris.

Culture influences how people seek psychological help, their definitions of social structure, and coping strategies. Overview Research shows that cultural factors affect notions of perceived happiness. The current general literature discusses positive psychology into two categories: Western and Eastern. Cultural psychologist Richard Shweder argues that these factors help shape what people deem is good, moral, and virtuous. Westerners seek rewards on more of a physical plane, while Easterners seek to transcend the physical plane to a spiritual one.Shweder, R.A., Much, N.C., Mahapatra, M., & Park, L. (1997). The \\"Big Three\\" of Morality (Autonomy, Community, Divinity) and the \\"Big Three\\" Explanations of Suffering. In A. Brandt & P. Rozin (Eds.) Morality and Health. New York: Routledge Western literature generally stresses autonomy, individuality, and personal satisfaction, while Eastern work generally focuses on harmony, collective cooperation, and group satisfaction. Despite cultural differences in many concepts of interest to positive psychology, the overwhelming majority of intervention studies are conducted using samples drawn from Western cultures. History In the late 1800s and early 1900s, anthropologists and psychologists used race and culture as factors that influence positive and negative behaviors and attitudes.{Snyder, Lopez, Pedrotti (2011). Positive psychology: The scientific and practical explorations of human strengths (2nd ed.)} This led to a culturally deficient perspective, used for some groups to assert dominance over others through eugenics. American psychologists G. Stanley Hall and Henry Goddard Hall were among some of the notable figures to adopt this view. By the mid 20th century, the dominant viewpoint was that culture did not predetermine life outcomes; instead differences were the consequence of environmental factors. The culturally different perspective holds that unique strengths can be highlighted within every culture. David Satcher was among the first to emphasize the influences of culture on mental health. Cultural differences occur both between and within nations. Social psychologists have supported the notion that humans are \\"social animals\\".  Major theories  Psychologists Charles R. Snyder, Shane J. Lopez, and Jennifer T. Pedrotti identify two major influential western traditions ‚Äì Athenian and Judeo-Christian ‚Äì and four major eastern traditions ‚Äì Confucianism (China), Taoism (China), Buddhism (Japan), and Hinduism (Southeast Asia) ‚Äì relevant to positive psychology. =Western philosophy= * The Athenian view (held by Aristotle and Plato) stems from discussion of virtue and human strength. It emphasizes the importance of a political community, or \\"polis\\", and states that people with good human virtue arrange themselves into a society and model good behavior. * The Judeo- Christian approach discusses the importance of the virtues of faith, hope, charity, fortitude, justice, temperance, and wisdom. It states that laws and rituals serve to cultivate strengths within society. =Eastern philosophy= * Confucianism stresses that leadership and education are central to morality. Emphasis is placed on taking care of others within the group. Virtues are used to achieve enlightenment, or the good life. * Taoism portrays the concept of \\"The Way,\\" referring simultaneously to direction, movement, method, and thought. Tao is the energy surrounding and flowing through everyone, and The Way must be achieved through experience, rather than teaching alone. * Buddhism refers to the teachings of the \\"Enlightened One,\\" which state that life is full of suffering brought on by human desire and attachment. There is, however, a possible end to the suffering through transcendence and ultimate understanding. Virtues are of utmost importance, and include love, joy, compassion, and composure * Hinduism emphasizes the interconnectedness of all things. It advocates for the harmonious union among all individuals, who should strive for ultimate self betterment and also encouraged to be good to others. Good deeds are motivated by the process of karma =Cultural differences in the concept of well-being= Joshanloo (2014) identifies and discusses six broad differences between Western and non-Western conceptions of well-being. His analysis is based on his survey of the accounts of happiness and optimal functioning provided in Western as well as non-Western traditions, including Hinduism, Buddhism, Taoism, Confucianism, and Sufism. These six major domains of difference are as follows: *Self-Transcendence versus self- enhancement. The way cultures define the self is of great importance in conceptualizing happiness. Whereas the Western concept of the self is primarily based on the ideals of individualism, eastern traditions tend to regard the self as a small part of the collective and the cosmos. Consistent with the Western understanding of the self, enhancing autonomy, independence, self-esteem, and a strong ego is considered to be a vital ingredient of a good life in these cultures. In contrast, in Asian traditions, the individual self is de-emphasised in one way or another. For example, in Buddhism, the existence of an individual self is considered an illusion. *Eudaimonism versus hedonism. In contemporary Western psychology, scientific analysis of individuals' mental well-being and quality of life is mainly undertaken in the field of subjective well-being, which has been formulated based on a hedonic understanding of well-being. A hedonistic conceptualization of happiness is in accord with the core values and ethos of modern Western culture, namely liberal modernity, hedonism, and romantic individualism. However, hedonism as a way of pursuing happiness is not equally favored in eastern traditions. In these traditions, positive emotions and pleasures are considered too temporary and marginal to be the criterion against which happiness is measured. Non- Western conceptualizations of happiness are thus more consistent with eudaimonism, which emphasizes virtues in defining happiness. *Harmony versus mastery. Consistent with the Western dominant way of thinking about humankind and its relationship with the environment, qualities such as environmental mastery and control are highly valued in Western cultures. In contrast, in eastern cultures where interpersonal harmony and adjustment are emphasized, people reach a sense of well-being basically through promoting mutual sympathy and harmony with others and the whole cosmos. These perspectives value self- transcendence, interdependence, softness, flexibility, and adjustment to the environment rather than autonomy and independence. *Contentment versus satisfaction. Life satisfaction has been stressed over the past four decades in Western psychological literature on mental health. Life satisfaction is believed in the Western thought to result from need or desire satisfaction. However, contentment, in non-Western cultures, involves satisfaction as well as many other qualities and experiences. It is understood as a delicate balance between joy and sorrow that should be preserved in both happy and sad times. It involves accepting any failure or misery one faces with composure, dignity, and gracefulness. This sense of contentment is believed to result from the realization of the transcendent self. Whereas the contentment is spiritually loaded, life satisfaction is not associated with morality and spirituality. *Valuing versus avoiding suffering. A potential consequence of a hedonistic conceptualization of happiness that stresses the maximization of subjective well-being (consisting in part of the absence of negative emotions) is that such a conceptualization, which seems to be dominant in the West, makes it difficult to accept hardship, negative affect, and unhappiness as possible integral parts of a good life. Having this in mind, eastern eudaimonistic theories of well-being accept the existence of negative feelings and anhedonia in a truly happy life. From an eastern point of view, one should be able to embrace both positive and negative sides of life. *Relevance versus relative irrelevance of spirituality and religion. In dominant Western lines of research where materialistic values and moral pluralism are valued, religion and spirituality are studied mainly as predictors of mental well- being, and they are not involved in formulating it. In contrast, in non- Western cultures, spirituality and religion are interwoven in individuals' understanding and experiencing of life in general and happiness in particular. Happiness for many non-Westerners is formulated based on religious and metaphysical worldviews. Transcendence, spirituality, mystical experience, following religious duties, and practicing religious rituals are essential for these people's sense of happiness. =Viewpoints within positive psychology= There are different approaches within the field of positive psychology. With the support of numerous sources, Bacon presents the idea that there are two \\"cultures\\" in positive psychology, or two different ways to view the positive psychology construct of personal strengths: focus culture and balance culture. In focus culture, individuals are focused on developing and expressing their personal strengths. Balance culture is instead oriented towards balancing and bringing harmony within oneself and among others. Bacon argues that individuals ascribing to the focus culture will differ in their life experience and life path than those who believe in the balance culture. Bacon believes that the strengths can be categorized into these two cultures and goes into depth explaining why creativity is the prototypical strength in the focus culture and why wisdom represents an ideal strength in the balance culture. Rather than tying culture to a certain ethnic or cultural group, Bacon and others argues that there are two different cultures, or schools of thought, within positive psychology. These two cultures reflect a new way to categorize strengths (Bacon, 2005). Approaches There are two main approaches to cross-cultural positive psychology. One perspective, termed 'culturally-free' believes that there are numerous human strengths that are valued universally, and that the pursuit of happiness is common across cultures. Proponents of this side view their approach as descriptive and objective, claiming its results \\"transcend particular cultures and politics and approach universality\\". The other approach views values as culturally embedded, meaning that cultural values of the researchers influence their work. The Diagnostic and Statistical Manual 5 (DSM-V) takes this view and includes information throughout the manual to increase cultural sensitivity and further the awareness of a multicultural perspective in clinical practice. Some of the additional information includes insight into cultural differences in key symptoms of disorders, as well as suggestions on how to take cultural context into account during treatment. Also, Western traditions fostered more individualistic societies while eastern traditions fostered more collectivistic societies. Individualistic cultures value the self above the group. Collectivistic cultures value the group above the individual. Key western values (Individualism) :* Autonomy/personal freedom :* Competition :* Personal achievement :* Self-oriented :* Future-oriented :* Hope :* Uniqueness (seen through commodities, names, attitudes, performances, attributes, etc.) Key eastern values (Collectivism) :* Seeks to cultivate interdependence :* Sharing/cooperation :* Conformity/desire to fit in (fosters duty to group and dependence) :* Promote harmony/avoiding conflict :* Going with the flow :* Loyalty to family and friends :* Past-oriented :* Group-oriented :* Compassion There are distinct differences between the thought processes used by Westerners and Easterners resulting in differing worldviews. For example, in seeking happiness, Westerners give priority to \\"life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness\\" as well as goal-directed thinking. Easterners, on the other hand, may be more accepting in their situation, and put more weight on inner life balance. The virtue of harmony appears to be a pillar of Eastern culture. Edward C. Chang did a series of quantitative studies in order to showcase the importance of understanding the equivalence of traits and constructs across cultural groups. For example, Asian Americans were more pessimistic than Caucasians, but the two groups were not all that different on their levels of optimism. Joseph G. Ponterotto et al. have suggested that the ability to navigate and adapt to the increasingly diverse context of the world, is an important strength. People high on this are said to have \\"multicultural personalities\\". It adjusts for differences between cultures. Kristoffer G. van der Zee and Jan P. van Oudenhoven created the Multicultural Personality Questionnaire (MPQ), and identified five factors that describe personality style: cultural empathy, open-mindedness, emotional stability, initiative, and flexibility. This may correlate with enhanced well being. Psychology researcher Daphna Oyserman and her colleagues advocate for a less static view of separate cultures (East vs. West), and suggest exploring more dynamic ways explaining the ways in which these cultures operate. Different cultures can operate together, rather than being seen as conflicting (it is not \\"me vs. we\\").  Major empirical findings  There has been a recent effort by researchers to explore how concepts of Positive Psychology differ between cultures, as well as how culture influences how individuals view the good life. For example, Snyder's chapter (2009)Snyder, C. (2009). Positive Psychology Within a Cultural Context. In Oxford handbook of positive psychology (pp. 49-57). Oxford: Oxford University Press. explores the way in which culture affects positive psychology. More specifically, Snyder acknowledges the fact that culture impacts individual's understanding of strengths and weaknesses. Snyder claims that it is important to understand the cross section of positive psychology and culture, because it allows one to not only understand people within a culture but it also enables one to appreciate people from different cultures. Snyder outlines two schools of thought in the positive psychology field that pertain to how we should view strengths within a cultural context: culture-free and the culturally embedded perspective. Those ascribing to the culture-free perspective believe that strengths are not affected by culture and that there are universal strengths. The culturally embedded perspective argues that one must take into account culture when one is considering strengths, because they believe strengths manifest themselves differently in different cultures (Snyder, 2009). Dahlsgaard, Peterson, and Seligman's (2005) meta-analysis presents historical and psychological evidence supporting the contention that there are universal virtues that exist across cultures. They are courage, justice, humanity, temperance, wisdom, and transcendence. These authors note that these virtues have been represented in ancient texts within Confucianism, Taoism, Buddhism, Hinduism, Christianity, Islam, Judaism, and from Athenian scholars. Each of these core virtues was represented in these schools of thoughts and became entrenched in the societies and cultures that ascribe to these religions and belief systems. Thus, these core virtues of courage, justice, humanity, temperance, wisdom, and transcendence are valued equally across these different cultures (Dahlsgaard et al., 2005). Another virtue put forth by Seligman in attaining the good life is forgiveness. Previous researchers have not looked extensively at how forgiveness occurs in non-Western cultures, yet virtue is a very culturally embedded value. The research that has explored the virtue of forgiveness in non-Western cultures has found that there are not significant differences in overall levels of forgiveness, yet the reasons behind forgiving and the meaning of forgiveness varies between collectivist and individualistic cultures. For example, forgiveness in individualistic cultures is focused on a particular individual, while Eastern cultures see forgiveness in a broader, community context. Since forgiveness is a key virtue in positive psychology and a relevant topic in counseling, it is important to research forgiveness more thoroughly in a variety of cultures in order to better understand how different cultures view forgiveness. In studies that highlight differences between Western and Eastern cultures, discrepancies in values and emotions have been found when comparing the United States and China. It is often concluded that people in Eastern cultures are less happy than those in Western cultures, but research indicates that there is more value placed on suffering and transcendence in Eastern cultures than in the United States. It is also commonly believed that there is less happiness experienced by people in Eastern cultures because there is less individuality, but Eastern cultures are socialized in a much more collectivist mindset and develop into adults that are more concerned with finding a place in one's community rather than standing out, as Americans are. These differences in particular indicate that there should be further research into cultural differences to avoid mistakes in classifying behavior and psychological functioning. Kubokawa and Ottaway's literature review examines how emotions vary across culture, suggesting that applications of positive psychology need to adapt to different cultural contexts. The authors use self-criticism as an example: self-criticism is considered as detrimental to one's well-being in Western cultures, whereas collectivistic cultures value self-criticism as an important tool for personal growth, and consider it useful in aligning with societal norms (Heine et al., 2001). The authors also discuss a study conducted in Asian Americans and Caucasians that examined optimism and pessimism. The study found that while Asian Americans rated higher in pessimism than Caucasians, they did not differ in levels of depressive symptoms, indicating that the association between pessimism and depression might not apply in Asian cultures the way it does in Western cultures. In general, many negative emotions in Western cultures do not hold the same connotations in East Asian cultures, leading the authors to suggest that classification of certain emotions as positive and negative is not universal, and that research in positive psychology should cater to these cultural aspects.Kubokawa, A. and Ottaway, A. (2009). Positive Psychology and Cultural Sensitivity: A Review of the Literature. Graduate Journal of Counseling Psychology, 1(2), 130-138 Kubokawa and Ottaway also present research that discredits the cultural relevance of the Values in Action Classification of Strengths (VIA) created by Peterson and Seligman. Peterson and Seligman (2004) identified six universal characters strengths and virtues that are valued by all cultures: courage, justice, humanity, temperance, wisdom, and transcendence. These virtues in turn led them to create a subset of 24 strengths common to all cultures. However, Christopher and Hickinbottom (2008) argue that the VIA Classification of Strengths is an oversimplification of cultures, and that while the values might be similar across cultures, the meaning that Peterson and Seligman ascribed to them are Western-orientated and might not translate well into more collectivist cultures. =Cultural differences and the good life= Previous research has demonstrated that the good life, as defined by subjective well-being, is rooted in predominantly Western ways of thinking. But, throughout history, subjective well-being has often become less vital in comparison to the needs to the larger community. This change results in individuals feeling subjective well-being in response to the success of their community rather than from their individual experiences. For example, the people of Bali see life as having two realms, everyday life and the spiritual world. Due to this dichotomy, it is difficult to examine subjective well-being without considering both realms, which occurs when positive psychology uses Western ways of thinking about the world. Another cultural difference in how one conceptualizes the good life can be seen in the beliefs of the Aps√°alooke tribe, a Native American tribe in the US. Research has shown that for members of the Aps√°alooke tribe, life satisfaction is deeply rooted in the belief that one's life is intertwined with others in their tribe. Due to this feeling of collectivity, satisfaction is taken from helping others. This example is just one of many in which other cultures differ in the concept of satisfaction from the concept of satisfaction in an individualistic culture. In addition, a difference between collectivist and individualist cultures is the conceptualization of positive and negative emotions, including happiness. For example, research indicates that individualism moderates the relationship between hedonism and happiness, such that hedonism is more strongly related to happiness in more individualistic (vs collectivistic) cultures. In individualist cultures, individuals attempt to avoid negative emotions, but in Eastern communities, some negative emotions are viewed as a virtue. One example of this is that collectivist cultures value shame because they view it as an opportunity to better themselves. So, when Western conceptualizations are applied to Eastern cultures, researchers run the risk of psychological imperialism. How does the culture of consumerism relate to positive psychology? Past research has shown that consumer culture and the pursuit of extrinsic goals leads to diminished well being, in comparison to pursuing intrinsic goals that lead to an increase in well-being. These findings not only occur in America, but the same results occurred in samples across a variety of countries, including Romania, Germany, Russia, Singapore, and South Korea. These countries represent both individualistic and collectivist cultures, which demonstrates that one possible universal in positive psychology across cultures is the importance of the pursuit of intrinsic goals. = Cultural differences in well-being, meaning, and hope = Maygar-Moe, Owens, and Conoley identified specific cultural considerations that affect how practitioners should engage with concepts and theories in positive psychology within counseling settings. The literature review specifically addresses well-being, meaning, and hope. Well- being Wealthy, individualistic cultures experience higher levels of social well-being than underprivileged, collectivistic cultures (Diener, Diener, & Diener, 1995). Self-esteem was also more predictive of life satisfaction in individualistic cultures than in collectivistic cultures (Suh, Diner, Oishi, & Triadis, 1998).  Meaning  Research suggest that searching for meaning is viewed more positively in interdependent culture: Steger, Kawabata, Shimai, and Otake (2008) found that when comparing Japan (example of interdependent culture) and the U.S. (example of independent culture), the Japanese sample was high in searching for meaning while the U.S. sample was higher in experiencing meaning. Additionally, the search for meaning in the Japanese sample was positively related to presence of meaning, unlike in the U.S. sample. Research also indicates that national levels of globalization can moderate the relationship between \\"thinking about the meaning of life\\" and life satisfaction. That is, in more globalized cultures, this relationship is negative, whereas in less globalized cultures, this correlation is positive.  Hope  Maygar-Moe, Owens, and Conoley argue that while previous research supports the idea that is hope is universally a positive expectancy variably, the cultivation of hope varies based on cultural makeup. European Americans ‚Äì life satisfaction serves as a source of agentic hope and positive affect was found to be predictive of pathways of hope. Therefore, European Americans would benefit most from interventions that improve life satisfaction and positive affect (Chang & Banks, 2007). African Americans ‚Äì lack of negative problem orientation was the strongest predictor for agentic, and positive problem orientation was the best predictor of pathways thinking. Therefore, African Americans would benefit best from interventions that simultaneously reduce a negative problem orientation and increase a positive problem orientation (Chang & Banks, 2007). Latinos ‚Äì life satisfaction was the only predictor of pathways thinking, and rational problem solving was the best predictor of agentic thinking, therefore, Latinos would benefit most from interventions aiming to increasing rational problem solving and that would lead to higher life satisfaction (Chang & Banks, 2007). Asian Americans ‚Äì positive problem orientation was the strongest predictor of pathways thinking, while positive affect was the strongest predictor of agentic thinking. Therefore, Asian Americans would benefit best from interventions that promote positive affect and a positive problem orientation (Chang & Banks, 2007).  Applications  Culturally appropriate psychoeducational and counseling interventions would benefit from more empirical research on culturally embedded positive psychology. Cross-cultural studies would help with the application of psychological treatment and recovery, along with improving the general understanding of the psyche of diverse populations of people. This is not only important for the differences between Western and Eastern civilizations, but has implications for the various cultural and ethnic groups within the United States of America, a society that has been considered a \\"melting pot\\" and has grappled with these issues throughout history. One important aspect of American culture that should be addressed is that of consumerism. Since the negative effects of the culture of consumption transcends specific cultures, it can become a common theme across counseling practices of positive psychology to encourage pursuing intrinsic values and the good life, and avoid pursuing extrinsic goals and the \\"goods\\" life. In addition, a culturally-embedded approach would allow professionals outside the mental health field to utilize methodology and concepts from psychology to motivate and help people. Specifically, employers in any field of business would be able to find techniques that are culturally appropriate for encouraging employees to be better engaged in their careers and to find meaning in their work. This can effectively be applied to the cultural network groups that many companies organize for employees, such as women's and African-Americans' networks, that allow for employees and employers to increase the understanding of perspectives and cultural sensitivity in the workplace. Furthermore, teachers and administrators would be better equipped to address issues in educational achievement and behavioral development amongst diverse groups of students. Since there is currently strong criticism of the public education system for the achievement gap amongst students based on race and socioeconomic status, it would be especially helpful for educational authorities to understand the disparities that students may face due to aspects of their background. Teachers would benefit from knowing how to better foster a love of learning, creativity, optimism, resilience, leadership, and teamwork in diverse groups of students in order to prepare students for achievement in the future. The concept of achievement is tied to the aforementioned topics for many children. When achievement seems possible for all students, regardless of their cultural backgrounds, they may be more likely to persistently pursue attaining it. = Applications of strengths theory across cultures = Virtues and strengths are valued differently across cultures, which in turn means that attempts to build strengths using positive psychology within counseling settings can only be successful if they include important cultural considerations. For example, Chang (1996) found that Asian Americans reported higher levels of pessimism than Caucasians, however within that population pessimism was not found to contribute to depression and was associated with positive problem-solving strategies. This suggests that while pessimism is considered a weakness in some cultures, it might actually serve as a strength in others: defensive pessimism, for example, leads people to set lower expectations for themselves. This supports the idea that applications of positive psychology to cultivate strengths need to be altered to fit the clients' cultural backgrounds.  Controversies  = Overstatement of sample and cohort differences = Individual differences in the way people experience positive and negative emotions affect study results in a way that makes sample and cohort differences less important than the studies stress. More specifically, the conception of the self is key in positive psychology, and cross cultural differences in the conception of the self make it difficult to generalize results. Those individual differences often account for much of the variations between groups, and are often not taken into account. =Nonstandardized measurement of emotion = The first two problems converge for an even larger issue: the measurement of emotion is far from accurate. However, many studies and researchers use \\"oversimple checklists and questionnaires without follow-up or exploration of their adequacy.\\" Without in-depth explorations, the possibilities of finding observations about the flow of events in an emotional encounter is minimal. Thus, with very subjective results and the inadequacy to rule out other causal connections, the measurement of positive emotion itself is flawed. With the cultural aspect of positive psychology, the problems largely consist of the definition of positive emotions and notions of a positive life. Many of the ideals that are associated with a positive psychology are notions that are deeply ingrained within Western cultures, and do not necessarily apply to all groups of people. In relation to the previous point about measuring positive emotion, many of the social conditions in emotion measurement are ignored. \\"Positive psychology is doomed to being narrow and ethnocentric as long as its researchers remain unaware of the cultural assumptions underlying their work.\\" A large part of the literature debates whether positive psychology is innately culture-free or culture-embedded. Those who advocate culture-free positive psychology state that happiness is a universal trait, whereas advocates of culture-embedded positive psychology believe that the cultural context reach happiness differently, depending on their culture. Nonstandardized measurements of emotion are also due to the fact that pleasant hedonic experiences are expressed in very different ways across cultural groups, hindering researchers' ability to choose universal terms that will accurately describe these experiences without completely disregarding their cultural context. For example, Mesquita and Frijda (1992) argue that the word for \\"happiness\\" not only changes across languages, it also describes a different emotional experience. In English, happiness refers to a \\"high arousal, exuberant experience,\\" while its equivalent in Hindi, sukhi, refers to a low-arousal experience of peace and happiness, and in Kenya, for the Kipsigis, \\"happiness\\" is a lack of negative experiences, indicating a quiet and calm state. This makes it challenging for researchers to study positive psychology across cultures, as different interpretations of these terms could lead to invalid assumptions about specific emotions.Mitamura, C., Leu, J., Campos, B., Boccagno, C., and Tugade, M.

Formed in 1962, the squadron administered air force training and performed at air shows throughout Portugal. Between 1963 and its disbandment in 1992, the squadron lost nine pilots.  History  The squadron's heritage began in the early 1960s when Basic Flight Instruction Squadron No. 2 (, E.I.B.P. 2), \\"Os Panchos\\", was constituted at Air Base No. 1 (, BA1), flying the Cessna T-37 Tweet entering service with the Portuguese Air Force (PoAF). Together with Basic Flight Instruction Squadron No. 1 (, E.I.B.P. 1), which flew the North American T-6, formed the Basic Flight Training Group (, G.I.B.P.). The first twelve T-37C aircraft arrived in December 1962 as kits and were assembled at the OGMA workshops in February 1963. The remaining 18 aircraft arrived in batches of six, with the deliveries taking place in March 1964, June 1964, and the last six in January 1965. =Activation= The squadron (E.I.B.P. 2) was assigned the flight instruction of the aeronautic flight course's students of the Military Academy and was divided into two flights (): Esquadrilha n¬∞ 1, \\"Feras\\" (Beasts), and Esquadrilha n¬∞ 2, \\"√Åguias\\" (Eagles). Later it was also assigned the role of instructing the basic flight courses, at first alongside E.I.B.P. 1, which was later transferred to Air Base No. 7 (, BA7. In 1964, the squadron formed and started to train a new air force flight demonstration team called the \\"Panchos\\" with the objective of performing a demonstration at a festival in Alverca in July of the same year. However, the demonstration was canceled and the team was inactivated after an accident during a training exercise resulted in the loss of an aircraft and the death of the pilot. Portuguese Air Force T-37C in formation Upon reactivation the following year, the demonstration team continued its training and started to perform at air shows. In 1969, the team's name was changed to \\"Diabos Vermelhos\\" (Red Devils). The number of demonstrations was increased. In 1970 the team was inactivated during the Colonial War. The flight demonstration team was temporarily reactivated in 1973, as \\"Os Panchos\\", to perform at the commemoration of the centennial birth of Alberto Santos-Dumont. In 1976 the team was reactivated and in 1977 the Portuguese Air Force officially established the flight demonstration team Asas de Portugal as the national aerobatic flying team. In 1977 the squadron was re-designated as 102 Squadron and transferred to Air Base No. 11 (, BA11) as part of the reorganization of the Air Force's operational structure of 1978 and became the only squadron to administer basic flight training. The squadron was disbanded on August 8, 1992, when the T-37C was officially retired from service. =Losses= On February 3, 1964, the first crash of a PoAF T-37C occurred, killing both pilots.

They developed and launched a prototype which they tested in a variety of conditions, frequently updating and balancing and ultimately arrived at the Nippa design. Nippa began selling in 2004 under the Azzura Marine Group. Touting the simple to rig and simple to sail dinghy for five- to fourteen-year-olds. They marketed it to sailing clubs as buoyant, stable and exciting with hull features that complemented bumpy water and great for developing a training fleet. Ian donated 10 Nippas to the Avalon Sailing Club in 2004 to encourage use. =First Nippa to the United States= The first Nippa to arrive in the United States was sailed out of Santa Cruz, California by Philippe Kahn's Pegasus Racing Team Sailing Manager, Anthony Young. =The Nippa Class Association= Nippa noted that \\"As demand grows the Nippa Class Association will be rolled out.\\" however, it is not obvious at this time if the class association was established or not. As of 2006, Nippas had been sold locally in Victoria, New South Wales, Queensland and Western Australia and internationally in South Africa, the United States and England. In 2006, Nippa Sailing was working towards a national championship to be held in Sydney in January 2006. =Class rules= The Nippa is a one design class. It is intended that the Nippa will be raced in one-up and two-up formats. There are solid class rules that include: age restrictions for competition, restrictions on fittings and any changes to the equipment. There are guidelines on how a Nippa regatta will be conducted. A class association will issue class memberships and measurement certificates to ensure fair competition and a good flow of information. Design The Nippa is a stable computer designed hull shape, constructed of very rigid Vacuum molded E Glass with PVC Foam Core for durability and with minimal fittings (Ronstan) for simplicity of learning and use, for instance, there is no mainsheet cleat. The rig is designed of lightweight carbon and anti-corrosive materials and the mast is unstayed. =Features= * Boom mounted mainsheet block * Cockpit bag for storage * Permanent tow rope eye attached to the bow for safety. * Flush centerboard case to allow easier movement in the cockpit and no retention of water in the cockpit. * Lanyards on all loose fittings so parts won't be lost. * Two-piece baffled mast for ease of transport and positive buoyancy. =Costs= The Nippa was sold from the factory and included a cradle and \\"everything you need to sail the Nippa\\" for A$4,800. Individual spars and blades could also be purchased directly from the factory: *Mast: A$335 *Boom: A$180 *Centerboard: A$250 *Rudder Blade: A$150 *Rudder, Rudder Box & Tiller Extension: A$315 *Mainsail: A$486 =Color= The Nippa sails and decals are available in seven colors, including: Orange, Red, Pink, Green, Dark Blue, Mid Blue and Yellow. The colors were designed as a marketing tool for children as well as an identification tool for parents. =Design awards= * A Commendation Award for Sailing Trailerable Category, Boat Of The Year Awards, 2005 See also Dinghy References External links Dinghies ","title":"Nippa (dinghy)"},{"id":"42551393","text":"The Binalong railway station and telegraph office is the older of two closed railway stations in Binalong on the Main Southern railway line in New South Wales, Australia. The station opened in November 1876 as the terminus of the Bowning-Binalong section of the line. Following a fire to the original wooden building in 1883, a new stone and brick building was constructed. This was in use until 1916 when the line was deviated in conjunction with duplication. The station house and telegraph office remain today as a building of important historical significance in the town. History Railway staff at Binalong station A telegram slip from Binalong telegraph office from February 1901 The southern railway or as it was known at the time 'the Great Southern Railway' was extended from Bowning to Binalong in November 1876 and then to Harden (at that time named Murrumburrah) in March 1877. The well known Amos Brothers had the contract for the extension works. The first train arrived in Binalong on Wednesday 2 November 1876 after the 14 mile stretch of track from Bowning was opened. The two engine train consisted of 20 carriages when it stopped at the contractor's camp just outside Bowning. Here Alexander Amos and his employees joined various dignitaries in a luncheon to celebrate this portion of track's completion. The train then moved on to Binalong where despite the importance of the event there was little recognition by the Binalong townsfolk. The day before, John Whitton, Engineer-in-Charge for the New South Wales Railways, inspected the track and was reportedly extremely pleased at the excellence of the work that was 'unsurpassed, if even equalled, by any other portion of the existing railways'. Station fire On Sunday 22 April 1883, the original wooden station building was destroyed by fire. A coroner's inquest failed to find a cause of the fire despite hearing evidence from many witnesses. Special praise was given to a young fettler, William Nettleton, who bravely risked injury to save three chairs. Just over a month later Binalong was celebrating the completion of the brickwork of the new, sturdier station. George Reynolds, the bricklayer, was toasted by the attendees for his work. The celebratory atmosphere also saw toasts to the Queen, the district engineer, the inspector, the carpenters, the Press and the station master and his wife; Mr and Mrs Rae. Binalong train collision At 4:20am on Saturday 17 April 1915 the limited express train from Melbourne collided head on with the Temora mail train which was standing at the platform. 30 passengers were injured. One passenger, Robert Thomas, was taken to Yass Hospital and later died. A coroner's inquest heard that the night officer, 27-year-old John Sylvester Cotter, on hearing the approaching express train, inadvertently lowered the signals for the wrong line, sending the express train straight into the train standing at the station instead of bypassing it on the loop. With Cotter freely admitting his mistake, the coroner's inquest found him guilty of manslaughter. He was sent to stand trial at the criminal court in Sydney, where he was found not guilty. The driver of the express from Melbourne, Henry Byrnes, was commended for his quick reaction to the impending collision in applying the brakes early. The coroner said that if any man deserved the Victoria Cross it was driver Byrnes. The driver of the Temora mail train, Alfred Spike, was also commended for managing to get his train moving in reverse and thus considerably reducing the force of the impact. Eva Rebecca Thomas, the widow of the one fatality of the incident, took the chief of the railways to court claiming ¬£2000 in compensation. The railways admitted negligence and ¬£1425 was awarded, to be shared by his widow and eight children. After decommission Binalong station after decommission With the advent of longer and heavier trains and the growth in railway traffic, two tracks and easier gradients were needed on the Great Southern Railway. At many points, the line was deviated to ease gradients, particularly those against Sydney-bound goods trains, and these deviations nearly all resulted in longer, more winding alignments, which are still in use. One of the locations where an easier gradient was needed was through Binalong, and the deviation necessitated the relocation of the railway station. The original Binalong station and telegraph office was decommissioned on 22 December 1915. Since then it has been in use as a private residence and for agricultural uses. A previous owner was James Doran, who was a well known race horse trainer. Doran's horse 'The Green Isle' held the one-mile record at Victoria Park. Since the late 1970s it has had 3 different private owners who have each had a keen interest in preserving the historical aspect of the building. In the 1980s the owner of the station building acquired the brake van of the Southern Highlands Express, which is still on site today.

Proto was elected to the board of directors of the Long Wharf Theater, and served on the board of directors of the Shubert Theatre (New Haven). In 1981, Proto received the Distinguished Alumnus Award from Southern Connecticut State University. He had given the Commencement Address in 1976. In 1981, Proto returned to Washington, D.C., where he served as general counsel to President Jimmy Carter's Nuclear Safety Oversight Committee (NSOC).Following the accident at Three Mile Island, President Carter appointed a commission chaired by Dartmouth President John G. Kemeny. NSOC's purpose was to examine nuclear power plant safety, make recommendations, and oversee implementation of the Kemeny Commission recommendations. Arizona Governor Bruce Babbitt, who had been a member of the Kemeny Commission, chaired NSOC. Proto attended the International Atomic Energy Commission Conference in Stockholm; led research efforts in emergency planning and efforts on the effect of conditioning bank lending and insurance practices on upgraded safety measures; and, with others, critiqued various utility emergency planning exercises and NRC decisions. Proto also has written about the corporate and government failure to ensure nuclear safety.http://toahighcourt.com/pdf/Three_Mile_Island_NTProto.pdf From 1983 to 1989, Proto entered private practice in New Haven. He represented the city and state in various constitutional and environmental litigation in Washington, D.C.; Connecticut; and New York.Representative cases during this period included Connecticut Trust for Historic Preservation v. I. C. C. and City of New Haven (Intervenor), 841 F.2d 479 (2nd Cir. 1988) Rails to Trails Act, Farmington Canal (Connecticut) (briefing and oral argument); Mall Properties, Inc. v. Marsh, Department of Army and City of New Haven (Intervenor), 672 F. Supp. 561 (D.

Proto was appointed a visiting lecturer at Yale College in 1988 and 1989, where he taught the history and law of nuclear power. Proto returned to Washington, D.C., to join Verner, Liipfert, Bernhard, McPherson and Hand and begin teaching at Georgetown University's Public Policy Institute (now the McCourt School of Public Policy).At Georgetown, Proto developed interdisciplinary courses on environmental values and energy choices (coal, oil, and nuclear power), on global warming and the failed legislation to deal with it, and on cities‚Äîthe history of urban policy, architecture, transit, race, highways, culture, sprawl, and new urbanism. He represented, pro bono, the National Trust for Historic Preservation and Protect Historic America (involving such authors as David McCullough, James Alan McPherson, and Pulitzer Prize-winning journalist Nick Kotz) in their successful effort to stop Disney from building a theme park in Virginia.\\"Opponents of Disney Park Find Allies in Congress,\\" New York Times, June 13, 1994; \\"How Washington Insiders Ambushed Mickey Mouse,\\" Washington Monthly, December 1994. He drafted a unique statutory scheme at the behest of the State of Hawaii that resulted in the conveyance of Kaho'olawe Island from the United States to Hawaii for the special use of Native Hawaiians.Culture Into Law: The Conveyance of Kaho'olawe Island (1995, Honolulu) and Kaho'olawe: The Lawyer's Duty (2005, University of Washington Law School). His work led, in part, to the publication of his second book, The Rights of My People: Liliuokalani's Enduring Battle with the United States, 1898 to 1917. The book explored the skilled and courageous efforts of former Queen Liliuokalani on the continental United States to regain one million acres of land taken in the 1898 annexation by the United States. Proto also focused on the disquieting role played by lawyers. In December 2013, he donated the Rights of My People papers to the University of Hawaii Law School. In 2002, Proto became a partner at Schnader Harrison Segal & Lewis.His work included the ultimately successful effort to stop the use of the Mirant coal- fired power plant in Alexandria, Virginia, and, in 2011 and 2012, the Title VII Civil Rights and environmental lawsuit on behalf of Arlington County, Virginia, that stopped the construction of a toll road in Northern Virginia. The suit (U.S. District Court [DC]) focused on the measurable and disparate pollution harm to minority schools, day care centers, and elderly citizens. After more than a year of litigation, Virginia withdrew the planned road that was to run through Arlington, through Alexandria, and into the District of Columbia. In 2004, he was elected to the board of directors of the Roosevelt Institute for a three-year term. In the summer of 2004, he served as counsel to Congresswoman Rosa DeLauro (D-Conn.) in her capacity as chair of the Democratic Party Platform Drafting Committee. He served as chair (1995‚Äì2010) of the American Friends of Wilton Park, a British-American educational organization with origins in World War II. In 2010, he served as a senior adviser to the United States Naval Academy's Foreign Affairs Conference on \\"National Security Beyond the Horizon: Changing Threats in a Changing World.\\" Later that year, he was elected a Fellow in the Royal Geographical Society.  Selected writings  Proto's articles have been published in various newspapers, magazines, and journals. From 1997 to 2002, Proto undertook an examination of the lives of Bartolomeo Vanzetti and Nicola Sacco and the cultural and legal setting for their 1921 trial and 1927 execution. In 2002, with the support of Mayor John DeStefano, Jr., and Congresswoman Rosa DeLauro, Proto served as chair of New Haven's year-long commemoration of the seventy- fifth anniversary of the execution. Proto also co-adapted from the original Dutch (with director Tony Giordano) the musical drama, \\"The American Dream: The Story of Sacco and Vanzetti.\\" It was performed at the Shubert Theatre (New Haven) in 2002. In the preface to Sacco and Vanzetti, which encompasses the history and persons involved in this almost seven-year inquiry and literary effort, Proto wrote the following: \\"This body of work has reflected my intention to encourage a colloquy about the meaning and effects among Italian immigrants and Italian Americans of the fight for the lives of Bartolomeo Vanzetti and Nicola Sacco. It was not a lonely journey. From the outset, numerous people engaged thoughtfully and, at times, provocatively in such a colloquy‚Ä¶. Raw, often dormant, experiences and recollections emerged with a comfort not previously allowed or accepted. Memories among the elderly had been seared by the lives of Vanzetti and Sacco.\\" His recent writings include a work of short fiction, Absent in Body, Present in Spirit, as well as works on his adventurous exploits with friends in the Northwest and book reviews on Louis Brandeis and T. E. Lawrence. In 2016, Proto's one-person play on the 1933 U.S. Senate hearings into the causes of the 1929 stock market crash, The Reckoning, Pecora for the Public, premiered in Seattle. A reviewer said: \\"Possibly it is the best solo play ever written.\\"Marie Bonfils, review of The Reckoning, Pecora for the Public, Drama in the Hood, March 8, 2016, http://www.dramainthehood.net/2016/03/the-reckoning-pecora-for-the-public/. The video trailer for the play is available at https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BqlBBuIE7Wc. Proto's most recent book, Fearless: A. Bartlett Giamatti and the Battle for Fairness in America, explores the early years of the Italian American professor of Renaissance literature who would later become Yale's first non-Anglo-Saxon president and the commissioner of Major League Baseball.Neil T.

Current interests  Proto is a member of the District of Columbia Bar and the United States Supreme Court Bar. His peers recognize him for exceptional ethical conduct and legal skill.Martindale Hubbell, which is peer-driven, conferred an annual ranking of the highest order (AV) on Proto during his last decade of practice. According to Proto's notification: \\"Less than 14% of U.S. Attorneys are AV rated.\\" He continues to reside in Washington, D.C., occupied by writing, teaching, and exploring new creative threads. His interests frequently take him abroad to Royal Geographical Society conferences and events; to the Pacific Northwest for hiking, sailing, kayaking, and snowshoeing; and to the Northeast to maintain close ties with family members and friends.

He has played in Major League Baseball (MLB) with the New York Mets from 2014 to 2016, including his tenure as the team's primary starting third baseman for most of the 2015 season. Campbell has also played for the Hanshin Tigers of Nippon Professional Baseball (NPB). Early life Campbell was born on April 9, 1987 in Norwich, Connecticut, the younger of two children to Hugh Baird \\"Duke\\" Campbell and Amy B. Campbell (n√©e Burgess). His father was a school principal at the Norwich Free Academy as well as a baseball and basketball coach, while his mother, a 1977 NFA graduate, served as assistant principal and principal at Hebron Elementary School until her 2015 retirement after previously having spent 27 years working in Preston School District at Preston Veterans School in a variety of roles, including as a onetime principal- designee. Due to his parents' long careers in education, Campbell encouraged New Yorkers to choose educators as New York Daily News Hometown Heroes. Baseball career =High school= Campbell attended the Norwich Free Academy and played on the school's varsity baseball team beginning in his freshman year. Campbell played first base his freshman year, then moved to third in tenth grade and to shortstop as a junior, setting himself up for the versatility he would become known for on a professional level. Campbell was part of the 2003 team that won the Connecticut state high school championship. While in high school, Campbell was named to Baseball America's preseason All- America and All-Northeast first teams; he also received All-Conference and New Haven Register All-State accolades. Described by coach John Iovino as a \\"complete, and I mean complete\\" player, as a senior, Campbell served as team captain and set Norwich Free Academy career records for hits, home runs, batting average, stolen bases, runs, walks and at bats, hitting nearly .500 on the season in the leadoff spot. Even as a Major Leaguer, Campbell reflected fondly upon his teenage years, saying: \\"My favorite memories of playing baseball is playing for NFA, because you are playing with all of your best friends and having fun. That's what this game is about.\\" =College= After being spotted by then-coach Peter Hughes, Campbell was offered a scholarship to play college baseball for Boston College, where he was teammates with Pete Frates, who would later originate the ALS Ice Bucket Challenge. As a freshman with the Eagles, Campbell hit .260, batting sixth and starting at third base. He improved his batting average to .350 with 20 doubles and 41 RBI in 52 games as a sophomore. As a junior, he hit .306 with 18 doubles, 43 runs and 41 RBI in 53 games. At Boston College, Campbell gained the appellation \\"Soup\\" from his teammates, a name which he would later carry into his professional career. Campbell was described by Eagles coach Mik Aoki as a \\"good, sarcastic Northeasterner\\" with a dry sense of humor, a good teammate and a humble player who could easily blend into any clubhouse environment. =New York Mets= Campbell was drafted by the New York Mets in the 8th round of the 2008 MLB Amateur Draft, although he attempted to avoid following too closely the media coverage of the event, opting instead to go golfing with his father Hugh. Campbell, who had suspected that he would be chosen before the 15th round, only found out of his being picked by the Mets when he happened to check his computer before leaving for the links. Minor Leagues Campbell began his professional career in low-A with the Brooklyn Cyclones in 2008, hitting .260 and fielding .949 at third base, his main position. He split 2009 between the Savannah Sand Gnats, where he hit .248, and St. Lucie Mets, with whom he had 6 hits in 22 at-bats. In 2010, he played for the GCL Mets (going 3-for-11 at the plate), St. Lucie (with whom he hit .335 in 46 games) and the Binghamton Mets (with whom he hit .279 in 50 games). With Binghamton in 2011, he batted .247. With Binghamton again in 2012, he hit .297, earning a spot on the Eastern League Mid-Season All-Star team. He reached Triple-A for the first time in 2013, hitting .314 with 25 doubles, eight home runs and 66 RBI in 120 games for the Las Vegas 51s. Regard his big-league aspirations, Campbell told the Norwich Bulletin in 2013: \\"You think about it [a promotion] constantly, but you also understand that it's out of your control and the only thing you can do is go out and play hard. I've said it before: Nobody plays baseball to play in Triple-A. Everybody wants to play in the big leagues.\\" Campbell was described by his coaches as a cerebral and quiet player who took a while to gain his swing in the minors. After feeling that he had not received enough playing time on the Cyclones, Campbell approached Edgardo Alfonzo, his manager, and volunteered to play the outfield, ushering in a new era of versatility for his professional career. Wally Backman, Campbell's onetime manager in Las Vegas, agreed, saying that Campbell \\"didn't care where he played, he just wanted to play.\\" As a minor leaguer, Campbell developed a solid work ethic which enabled him to be versatile and yet skilled; he would eat peanut butter sandwiches and drink protein shakes before arriving at the ballpark early each day to practice fielding both on the infield and outfield and to take practice swings in the batting cage. Campbell also honed his hitting technique in the minors, where he learned to quiet his swings, pay attention to his hand position and study opposing pitchers. In one game in 2013, Campbell came in to pitch for the 51s, giving up 4 runs on a walk and 4 hits (including a home run) in one inning, which he ended by striking out Nolan Arenado. 2014 Campbell was promoted to the Mets from Las Vegas on May 10, 2014, in what his father Hugh described as a \\"glorious weekend\\". He made his debut batting against the Philadelphia Phillies in the bottom of the sixth inning pinch-hitting for Lucas Duda with the bases loaded, hitting a sac-fly to right fielder Marlon Byrd on a 1-0 count driving in Daniel Murphy for his first major league RBI off pitcher Jake Diekman. On May 11, Campbell got his first major league hit, a single in the bottom of the fourth inning off pitcher Cole Hamels. On May 21, he hit his first major league homerun, a two run home run off Los Angeles Dodgers' pitcher Hyun-jin Ryu. On July 7, during a game between the Atlanta Braves and New York Mets at Citi Field, in the bottom of the 9th inning and the game tied at three, Juan Lagares bunted towards third base to advance base runner Eric Campbell to second base. Braves third baseman Chris Johnson fielded the ball and threw to shortstop Andrelton Simmons, who was covering second base. Simmons was in no danger of being hit by the runner, yet the umpires ruled the runner out, calling it was a neighborhood play. Mets manager Terry Collins argued that it could not have been a neighborhood play, since it was a bunt play and recording a double play would be almost impossible. Simmons was moving away from 2nd base, and didn't record an out at 1st, either. Therefore, Collins claimed the only reason Simmons had to come off the base was an errant throw. The umpires accepted the claim and reviewed the play, and after review the out call was overturned. This led to an argument and ejection of Braves manager Fredi Gonz√°lez, who later said about the call that it was one of the worst calls he'd seen in his life. The Mets would go on to win the game 4-3 in 11 innings. Campbell finished the 2014 season appearing in 85 games with a batting average of .263 in 190 at-bats. He had 50 hits, 16 RBIs, 3 home runs, 17 walks and 16 runs scored, while striking out 55 times. 2015 Before the 2015 season, Campbell learned how to catch; although he had never previously caught professionally, he said that \\"if another position needs to be added, I'm all for it.\\" Campbell began the 2015 season with the 51s. On April 15, Campbell was called up to the Mets after David Wright was placed on the disabled list with a strained right hamstring. On May 5, he was demoted to make room for catcher Johnny Monell on the roster. He was recalled to the Mets replacing Dilson Herrera who was placed on the DL due to a fractured tip of his middle finger on May 15. On August 10, he was sent back to the 51s to make room for Michael Cuddyer coming off the 15-day disabled list. He was recalled on September 1 due to expanded rosters. Campbell finished the 2015 season appearing in 71 games with a batting average of .197 in 173 at-bats. He had 34 hits, 19 RBIs, 3 home runs, 26 walks and 28 runs scored, while striking out 37 times. The Wall Street Journal dubbed Campbell \\"baseball's unluckiest hitter\\" in 2015 based on statistics compiled by Inside Edge which showed that his rate of \\"well-hit\\" balls was much higher than his actual batting average. 2016 Campbell made the Mets' roster for Opening Day in 2016. On April 12, Campbell was demoted after making three appearances primarily as a Pinch runner and Pinch hitter to make room for Rafael Montero. Campbell was promoted again when Jacob deGrom was placed on the Family Emergency List three days later. On May 3, Campbell teamed up with Mets oufielder Curtis Granderson to read books (such as Green Eggs and Ham and If You Give a Pig a Pancake) to children at Corona, Queens' P.S. 92, following in the footsteps of former readers Wilmer Flores, Daniel Murphy, Bobby Parnell, Sean Gilmartin, Josh Edgin and Kirk Nieuwenhuis. On May 31, Campbell was demoted back to the 51s to make room for newly acquired first baseman James Loney. Campbell was batting .159 with one home run and five RBIs in 30 games. After the conclusion of the Triple-A season, Campbell was called back up to the Major Leagues. He was outrighted off the 40-man roster on November 2, 2016, assigned to the Triple-A Las Vegas 51s; after his outrighting, Campbell declared free agency. =Hanshin Tigers= In December 2016, Campbell signed with the Hanshin Tigers of Nippon Professional Baseball's Central League. Campbell described his decision to go play in Japan one motivated by a need for a \\"change of scenery\\"; he also commented that his game had become rusty after a few years of irregular playing time in the Mets organization. 2017 Campbell began spring training with the rest of the Tigers on February 1, 2017, but was soon sidelined by a case of viral gastroenteritis from February 16‚Äì18. Shortly after returning from his bout with sickness, Campbell injured his wrist in an intrasquad game. Diagnosed with an inflamed left wrist, Campbell began his first season in Japan hurt. Describing the incident as a \\"tough time to get injured\\", Campbell commented that his resulting unfamiliarity with Japanese pitchers was likely to make his adjustment to the game in Japan tougher. Campbell characterized Japanese pitchers' spin rates as more important compared to American pitchers', noting that even those who threw the ball slower still managed to create the illusion of a faster pitch. After a brief rehab stint with the Tigers' minor-league team, Campbell made his NPB debut on April 25, 2017. Campbell described the language barrier in Japan a point of difficulty for him, saying that the need for interpreters had led him to become a more quiet player in the clubhouse and dugout. Campbell also noted that most Japanese teammates and fans did not understand his nickname \\"Soup\\"; resultingly, he would be forced to explain the commonality of the nickname for Americans named Campbell, after the famous Campbell Soup Company. =Miami Marlins= On February 17, 2018, Campbell signed a minor league contract with the Miami Marlins. He elected free agency on November 2, 2018. =Oakland Athletics= On January 24, 2019, Campbell signed a minor league deal with the Oakland Athletics. Campbell re-signed with Oakland on November 25, 2019. Personal life Campbell married his childhood sweetheart, Kristin Elizabeth Hammond, in Norwich on December 6, 2014. Kristin, a fellow 2005 graduate of the Norwich Free Academy, works as an educator.

Biography Anne Nicol was born to Jason Theodore and Lucy Edna (n√©e Sowle) Nicol on November 25, 1926, in Tomah, Wisconsin. Her mother died when Anne was two years old. Anne Nicol graduated from high school at age 16 and earned an English degree from the University of Wisconsin‚ÄìMadison in May, 1949. She married Paul Joseph Gaylor the same year, and they had four children: Andy, Annie Laurie, Ian, and Jamie. Gaylor started the first private employment agency in Madison, Wisconsin, which she sold in 1966. She then became editor of the Middleton Times-Tribune. Abortion advocacy In 1967, while editor of the Times-Tribune, Gaylor wrote an editorial calling for legalized abortion in Wisconsin. She later joined the Association for the Study of Abortion, the Wisconsin Committee to Legalize Abortion, and Zero Population Growth. In 1970 first-trimester abortions were legalized in Wisconsin, and she began the Zero Population Growth Referral Service to refer women to abortion providers. However, there were still few doctors who provided abortions in the state, so Gaylor often referred women to Mexico and New York. She also served on the Board of Directors of NARAL, now known as NARAL Pro-Choice America. Gaylor, along with University of Wisconsin chemistry professor Robert West, founded the Women's Medical Fund to expand the services provided by the ZPG Referral Service. The organization was incorporated as a nonprofit in 1976. It provides small grants (on average about $200) to women who are unable to pay the full costs of their abortions. Funding comes from individual donors and foundation grants. In the past the Fund advertised its services, but now referrals come directly from abortion clinics. The organization is run entirely by volunteers, with no paid staff, and Gaylor answers many of the referral calls herself. It has paid out nearly $3,000,000 to abortion providers on behalf of patients. In 2009 the organization paid out $162,202 to its clients, and Gaylor took about 800 phone calls. By 2010, Gaylor had written checks to help pay for 18,986 abortions. Gaylor wrote Abortion Is a Blessing in 1975. The book argues for liberalization of abortion laws and details her experiences advocating for reproductive rights. It is currently out of print, but the full text is available online. Freedom From Religion Foundation Freedom From Religion Foundation logo While working on abortion rights issues, Gaylor felt the need to address what she saw as the root cause of women's oppression: religion. She felt that the existing women's rights organizations were not confronting this issue, so she founded the Freedom From Religion Foundation (FFRF) in 1976, along with her daughter Annie Laurie and John Sontarck. She served as the president and executive director until her retirement in 2005. The group is currently headed by her daughter and son-in-law, Dan Barker. She worked as a consultant for the FFRF and held the position of president emerita. While she was president the group grew from three to over 19,000 members in all 50 U.S. states and Canada. FFRF is a nonprofit organization that promotes the separation of church and state and educates the public on matters relating to atheism, agnosticism, and nontheism. Under her leadership, the foundation was involved in several high- profile legal cases, including one that ended the teaching of Christian doctrine in a Tennessee public school and another that overturned a law that made Good Friday a state holiday in Wisconsin. Gaylor produced the first atheist commercials that ever aired on television, on Madison's Channel 3. She also appeared on television and radio programs such as Crossfire, Larry King's radio show, and Oprah Winfrey's A.M. Chicago as a spokesperson for FFRF. In 1999, the FFRF published The World Famous Atheist Cookbook, edited by Gaylor. Death Her husband died of brain cancer in 2011, and she moved into a retirement home outside of Madison, Wisconsin in 2012. She died in a hospice after she was hospitalized and later had a fall.

Henry and set in a fictitious Central American country called the Republic of Anchuria. It takes its title from the poem \\"The Walrus and the Carpenter\\", featured in Lewis Carroll's Through the Looking Glass. Its plot contains famous elements in the poem: shoes and ships and sealing wax, cabbages and kings. It was inspired by the characters and situations that O. Henry encountered in Honduras in the late 1890s. Chapters ::The Proem: By the Carpenter Cabbages and Kings can be classified as fix-up novel. In the last chapter of the book, \\"The Vitagraphoscope\\", O. Henry suggests that it is a \\"vaudeville\\" that is \\"intrinsically episodic and discontinuous\\". Some characters do their turn ‚Äî the vaudeville term for an act ‚Äî and disappear, and others reappear if only briefly. New York Times Book Review, Dec 17 1904 \\"The incidents embracing as they do, a variety of subjects, hang loosely together, so loosely in fact, that at times one finds no apparent connection between them at all, and yet in the end one sees how each is intimately related to the other. ... Written by a less able hand than O. Henry's the book might have been a sad jumble, perhaps comprehensible to none but the Walrus‚Äîbut as it is, one finds a joy in its every obscurity.\\" \\"Banana republic\\" In one of the chapters, \\"The Admiral\\", inspired by the author's experiences in Honduras, where he had lived for six months, he refers to Anchuria as a \\"small maritime banana republic\\"; naturally, the fruit was the entire basis of its economy. https://www.theatlantic.com/politics/archive/2013/01/is-the-us-on-the-verge- of-becoming-a-banana-republic/267048/ According to a literary analyst writing for The Economist, \\"his phrase neatly conjures up the image of a tropical, agrarian country. But its real meaning is sharper: it refers to the fruit companies from the United States that came to exert extraordinary influence over the politics of Honduras and its neighbors.\\"http://www.smithsonianmag.com/smart-news/where-we-got-term-banana- republic-180961813/#geHDsKSeDYOltxOK.99Where did banana republics get their name?, The Economist The expression \\"banana republic\\" has been used widely since that time, particularly in political commentaries.
