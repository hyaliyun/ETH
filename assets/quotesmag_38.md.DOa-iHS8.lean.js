Takemoto.  Origin  Enthusiasts of the 1990 Nintendo video game Super Mario World modified the game's assets to create levels incredibly difficult to play. One release of three such modifications, Kaizo Mario World, associated the Japanese word for \\"remodel\\" with this genre of gameplay. These platforming games are designed to test the player's patience and skill while incorporating elements of mischief and discovery. For example, a Kaizo game might require the player's character to perform precise, technical jumps to cross a large gap only to hit an invisible block near the gap's end that sends the player-character to its death, making the player restart the level. The original Kaizo game was also known as \\"Asshole Mario\\". Since Kaizo games are custom releases, they were traditionally played in video game emulators or cartridges that let users load their own games. Creators and fans of Kaizo games developed into a \\"scene\\" that expanded with the release of Super Mario Maker, a 2015 video game that let players easily create custom levels for each other without modifying another game's code. Members of the Kaizo community play, rate, and compare games for discussion on Discord, YouTube, and Twitch. They are often entertaining to watch simply for their intense difficulty. Some games feature in-jokes to the community. Kotaku described the community as \\"friendly, competitive, and creative\\" with famous players alongside new players. Kaizo creators often create their games in sections by using save states. They eventually stitch the sections together to play the cohesive whole. Notable Kaizo creators include BarbarousKing, PangaeaPanga and GrandPooBear, who also speedrun and livestream games in the genre. Noteworthy games within the genre include Grand Poo World, Quickie World, Super Dram World, Super Panga World, Invictus, and Kaizo Mario trilogy. Kaizo games have also featured at Games Done Quick speedrun marathons. This scene continued with the release of Mario Maker sequel in 2019; one notable creation took World 1-1 from Super Mario Bros. (1985) and added \\"dozens of twirling fire bars\\", making the level nearly impossible.

She was also active in building the town of Pocatello, Idaho through her work with various civic and religious organizations.  Early life  Minnie Frances Hayden Howard was born August 23, 1872 in Memphis, Missouri to Jacob and Carina Jane Wood Hayden. She studied first to become a teacher. After her marriage to a young medical student, William Forrest Howard, on August 23, 1894 in Larned, Kansas, she attended and graduated from Kansas University Women's Medical School. She accompanied her husband while he studied surgical procedures in Vienna, Austria.  Life in Pocatello  Howard moved to Pocatello with her husband in 1901 or 1902. They established medical practices and became active, respected members of the community. They had four sons, all of whom went on to become doctors themselves. Howard was an early president of the Southeast Idaho Historical Society, the first co-chairman of the Red Cross for both Bannock and Caribou Counties, and put together other civic organizations such as the Art and Travel Club and the County Social Welfare Board. Guided by pioneer Ezra Meeker and native Jim Broncho, Howard verified the original location of Fort Hall and drove the effort to erect a monument there, also taking part in the organization and direction of the Oregon Trail Memorial Association. Howard chaired, served as president of, or was a member of Daughters of the American Revolution, Descendants of Mayflower Association, Scientific Temperance Investigation, Women's Christian Temperance Union, Women's Study League, Federated Women's Club, Department of Indian Welfare, and Pocatello Women's Club. She was also an active member of the First Congregational Church, Pocatello, writing a history of the church in November 1928. Howard was crucial in the campaign to secure funding from Andrew Carnegie and Pocatello city council support to build the Pocatello Public Library, a Carnegie library later renamed the Marshall Public Library. Two years after the library opened, the Howard family built and inhabited a home next door. Howard was an avid writer, penning numerous columns in The Pocatello Tribune, a portion of which were collected into a published history of Bannock County.  Death  After a lifetime of leadership, service, and scholarship, Howard died at the Bannock Nursing Home on September 2, 1965, at the age of 93.

History Polish Hill was mainly founded by immigrants from Poland in the late 1800s and early 1900s. They were mainly from Podkarpackie Voivodeship and migrants from the small township of Pulaskifield, Missouri who were also of Polish ancestry. The hill also had a small influx of Slovak immigrants, being so close to Podkarpackie. Together the Poles founded St. Joseph's Polish Catholic Parish at Vermont Avenue and Mill Street, on what became known as \\"Polish Hill\\". The community of people there was very large so the founding's of churches such as St. Benedict's and St. Casimir were founded by other Polish people to attend Mass. Sts. Cyril and Methodius was founded by the Slovak people and was also attended by more Poles. Many Eastern European immigrants in the area worked in local meatpacking plants. The Slavic community slowly started drifting apart. St. Benedict, St. Joseph, Sts. Cyril and Methodius and St. Casimir all co-joined to create All Saints Catholic Parish in the former church of St. Joseph. For over thirty years, the residents of Polish Hill have celebrated Polski Day with a parade and food festival during the first week of May each year to commemorate the signing of the Polish Constitution on May 3, 1791. Today, the community is mainly Hispanic, but continues the Polski Day tradition, resulting in Cinco de Mayo celebrations featuring kielbasa and sauerkraut. Notable residents include World Series-winning St. Louis Cardinals pitcher Ray Sadecki, who attended St. Joseph's Polish Roman Catholic School, and whose grandparents ran a grocery store in Polish Hill.

Crutchfield is credited with writing a total of 138 radio and television stories and scripts for Gunsmoke, a body of work that is second only to the number of episodes written by John Meston, the series' co-creator.John Meston is credited with writing 379 episodes for the radio and television versions of Gunsmoke between 1952 and 1965.Barabas, SuzAnne and Gabor, Barabas (1990). Gunsmoke: A Complete History and Analysis of the Legendary Broadcast Series. Jefferson, North Carolina: McFarland and Company, 1990, pp. 39, 113, 142, 613. While Gunsmoke is the most prominent showcase for Crutchfield's writing talents, he also composed original stories and adapted works by other authors for the CBS radio anthology series Escape as well as other weekly radio and television series and at least two feature films. Early life and career Les Crutchfield was born in Kansas in 1916, the elder of two sons of Golda Mary (née Pottorff) and Leslie Dillard Crutchfield.\\"Fifteenth Census of the United States: 1930\\", Leslie D. Crutchfield family, \\"Hutchinson City\\", Kansas, April 18, 1930. FamilySearch, digital copy of original census page. Retrieved March 4, 2019. His father, a native of Missouri, worked in Hutchinson as a warehouse foreman for a harvester manufacturer. Young Les received an extensive education, although in college the future writer was drawn initially to science and engineering as careers. He studied geology, mining, and metallurgy as an undergraduate, and in graduate school concentrated on chemistry, mathematics, and psychology.Barabas, p. 36. After college Crutchfield applied his training in geology and chemistry and in the late 1930s worked as an \\"explosives consultant\\" for mining companies in Arizona. Soon, however, he returned to academia to accept an engineering position at the California Institute of Technology (Caltech) in Pasadena. CBS scriptwriter \\"Around 1946\\", while still working at Caltech, Crutchfield met Norman Macdonnell, a producer and director for CBS Radio's West Coast or \\"Hollywood\\" division, which operated in the facilities of network affiliate KNX in nearby Los Angeles. Not long after they met, Crutchfield drafted some potential stories for network programs and gave them to Macdonnell. His writing apparently impressed CBS staff, for he was soon hired to assist in developing scripts for several popular radio series produced at KNX, including the anthology series Escape, Suspense, and Romance.Barabas, pp. 24, 36. By 1948 Crutchfield had firmly established himself as a scriptwriter. In fact, in July that year he identifies his profession on his California marriage license as \\"Radio writer, Independent\\". Crutchfield's early years as a CBS scriptwriter are not as well documented as his work for later radio, television, and film projects, but records do show that by 1947 he was adapting stories for Escape. His first script for the series was also its premiere broadcast—an adaptation of Rudyard Kipling's story \\"The Man Who Would Be King\\"—presented on July 7, 1947.

Gunsmoke on radio During Crutchfield's first years working for CBS, Macdonnell began collaborating with another scriptwriter, John Meston, on developing new weekly series. One series the two men proposed to the network was an \\"'adult Western'\\" that would present character-driven \\"Old West\\" stories set in and around Dodge City, Kansas in the 1870s.Barabas, pp. 15–16, 24–25. After their proposal was approved for production, Macdonnell and Meston invited Crutchfield to join their team of writers for the new project, which had been titled Gunsmoke. Its first episode, \\"Billy the Kid\\", was written by Walter B. Newman and aired on CBS Radio on April 26, 1952.Barabas, pp. 359–60. The new Western quickly became popular with audiences, and Crutchfield quickly became a frequent contributor of stories and scripts. In addition to himself, Macdonnell, Meston, and Newman, seven other writers furnished content for Gunsmoke in the 1952–1953 radio season. Nevertheless, Meston and Crutchfield's work that year comprises the great majority of the broadcasts, together accounting for 48 of the 71 episodes presented. In 1953, The New York Times reviewer Jack Gould praised the series' writing and credited its quality foremost to Meston and Crutchfield, whom he described as \\"craftsmen in their field\\".Gould, Jack (1953). \\"Radio in Review: 'Gunsmoke,' a Western Well Off the Beaten Path, Presented by C.B.S.

A total 480 episodes were broadcast on the radio version of Gunsmoke. His most prolific year writing for Gunsmoke on radio was the 1956–1957 season, when he furnished 38 of its 52 episodes.Barabas, pp. 404–11. Gunsmoke on television When CBS also started a televised version of Gunsmoke in 1955, Crutchfield wrote episodes for that series as well. He created teleplays for the \\"small screen\\" while still composing scripts for Gunsmoke's ongoing radio counterpart and for Yours Truly, Johnny Dollar and Fort Laramie. Crutchfield's first episode for Gunsmoke on television is \\"Reed Survives\\", initially broadcast December 31, 1955. He then composed the teleplay for Meston's story \\"No Handcuffs\\" that aired three weeks later. For the next decade Crutchfield continued to provide stories and scripts periodically for the televised series. His final script for Gunsmoke, one co-written with Paul Savage, is \\"Mistaken Identity\\" broadcast on March 18, 1967, five months after Crutchfield's death.Barabas, pp. 448–49, 613. \\"Festus\\" Ken Curtis (left) in 1974 portraying \\"Festus\\", the character Crutchfield created 12 years earlierThe most enduring character Crutchfield created in his many Gunsmoke stories and scripts is Festus Haggen.Barabas, p. 116.

Many internal combustion engines use cast iron and steel extensively for their strength and low cost. Aluminum offers lighter weight at the expense of strength, hardness and often cost. However, with care it can be substituted for many of the components and is widely used. Aluminum crank cases, cylinder blocks, heads and pistons are commonplace. The first airplane engine to fly, in the Wright Flyer of 1903, had an aluminum cylinder block.\\"The Wright brothers: Inventing a Flying Machine\\", Smithsonian National Air and Space Museum. (retrieved 10 June 2019) All-aluminum engines are rare, as the material is difficult to use in more highly stressed components such as conrods and crankshafts. The BSA A10 motorcycle engine had aluminum conrods, while the Škoda 935 Dynamic auto engine had an aluminum crankshaft.  Russian Aluminum ICE project  An aircraft engine made 90 percent from aluminum alloys was developed by scientists and engineers Novosibirsk State Technical University. Work on it was carried out for four years. The engineers of NSTU, while working on this engine, applied the development of Institute of Inorganic Chemistry SB RAS. The designers were assisted by scientists Alexei Rogov and Olga Terleeva. The crankshaft and main engine gearbox are made of aluminum. This allows reduction of mass by 40-50 percent, while maintaining the same power, compared to a conventional steel engines. A prototype engine was tested on ordinary AI-95 gasoline. Tests were going on throughout 2018 and completed in early 2019. As a result, the high performance characteristics of the heavy-duty coating, which the aluminum parts are processed with, were confirmed. According to the professor of the Aircraft and Helicopter Engineering Department of the Faculty of Aircraft of NSTU, Ilya Zverkov, this engine was developed for the aircraft Yak-52 by order of the Russian Aviation Revival Foundation, which is based at the Mochishche airfield.

He had a close friendship and collaboration with Ingeborg Refling Hagen and her circle, and was one of the artists that decorated Stein School in Nes, which is now a museum. Among other things, he painted a scene from the old Norse sagas in the hall at the school. The painting De eligerede mænd (The Elected Men) is considered Dal's chief work.

After about the highway crosses Battle Creek, a tributary of the Solomon River. It continues north to an intersection with Ivy Road, which connects to Rock City, a group of 200 spherical boulders designated as a National Natural Landmark. Here K-106 levels out and transitions to farmlands, as it continues north past an AG by Air airport. As it passes by the airport it crosses Salt Creek then curves east. It continues east for then curves northeast and enters the city of Minneapolis. As it enters the city it crosses the Solomon River then a Union Pacific Railroad track. It then curves east at and begins to follow 1st Street. It then turns south at Rothsay Avenue and leaves 1st Street. It continues south then turns east and begins to follow Laurel Street then passes Highland Cemetery as it exits the city. As it continues east it crosses Lindsey Creek then soon reaches a diamond interchange with US-81. Past US-81 the highway curves southeast and begins to parallel US-81. After just over , K-106 curves east. It continues through flat rural farmlands before intersecting North 180th Road. It continues for then curves north and ends later at Ottawa State Fishing Lake. The Kansas Department of Transportation (KDOT) tracks the traffic levels on its highways, and in 2018, they determined that on average the traffic varied from 190 vehicles per day at the eastern terminus to 1850 vehicles per day just west of the junction with US-81. K-106 is not included in the National Highway System. The National Highway System is a system of highways important to the nation's defense, economy, and mobility. K-106 does connect to the National Highway System at its junction with US-81. All but of K-106's alignment is maintained by KDOT. The entire section within Minneapolis is maintained by the city. History Before state highways were numbered in Kansas there were Auto trails, which were an informal network of marked routes that existed in the United States and Canada in the early part of the 20th century. The former Blue Line follows K-106's southern terminus. The highway crosses the former Sunflower Trail and Meridian Highway in Minneapolis. K-106 was assigned by the Kansas Department of Transportation (KDOT) on July 8, 1944, when US-81 was moved slightly east to a new alignment. At that time it began at the Minneapolis city limits and ran east along Laurel Street to US-81. In a May 25, 1949 resolution, a road was extended from the north side of the city east along 10th Street to US-81 and became known as K-106N and the original K-106 became K-106S. Between 1953 and 1956, K-106S and K-106N became K-106, a complete loop through the city. On July 11, 1956, KDOT passed a resoulution to extend K-106 southward to K-18, and the section along Laurel Street formally known as K-106N was eliminated. The portion of K-106 from Heartland Drive east to Ottawa Lake was originally K-93. In a June 14, 1994 resolution, K-93, which was designated May 1, 1936, was added to K-106 when a new alignment of US-81 was built.

The term reflects the fact that researchers can choose between multiple ways of collecting and analyzing data, and these decisions can be made either arbitrarily or because they, unlike other possible choices, produce a positive and statistically significant result. Their widespread use represents an inherent methodological limitation in scientific research, and contributes to an inflated rate of false-positive findings. They can also lead to overestimated effect sizes. Though the concept of researcher degrees of freedom has mainly been discussed in the context of psychology, it can affect any scientific discipline. Like publication bias, the existence of researcher degrees of freedom has the potential to lead to an inflated degree of funnel plot asymmetry. Furthermore, studies with smaller sample sizes are more susceptible to the biasing influence of researcher degrees of freedom. Examples Steegen et al. (2016) showed how, starting from a single raw data set, applying different reasonable data processing decisions can give rise to a multitude of processed data sets (called the data multiverse), often leading to different statistical results. Wicherts et al. (2016) provided a list of 34 degrees of freedom (DFs) researchers have when conducting psychological research. The DFs listed span every stage of the research process, from formulating a hypothesis to the reporting of results. They include conducting exploratory, hypothesis-free research, which the authors note \\"...pervades many of the researcher DFs that we describe below in the later phases of the study.\\" Other DFs listed in this paper include the creation of multiple manipulated independent variables and the measurement of additional variables that may be selected for analysis later on.

During the Second World War, Lagadinova contributed to the Bulgarian resistance against Nazi occupation, earning the nickname “Амазонка” or “The Amazon.” She was the younger female fighter in Bulgaria, beginning her contributions to the war effort at 11 years old and actively fighting at age 14. Following the Allied victory in 1945, she pursued a PhD in agrobiology, before serving as a research scientist at the Bulgarian Academy of Sciences. There, she developed a new strain of wheat, Triticale, which helped to boost the productivity of collective farms. For this discovery, she was awarded the Order of Cyril and Methods by the Bulgarian Government. In 1968, Lagadinova accepted the position as Secretary of the Fatherland Front and President of the Committee of the Bulgarian Women's Movement. In these roles, she played a significant role in the creation and enforcement of legislation to benefit women in the workplace, including maternity leave laws. She was also a notable figure in global politics, working with other international activists to forge a coalition of national women's organisations, and becoming a member of the UN Institute for Training Women in 1985. She died on October 29, 2017, in a retirement facility in Sofia, Bulgaria.  Early life  Razlog, Bulgaria, where Elena Lagadinova was born. The Pirin Mountains, where she escaped to in 1944, are visible in the distance. Lagadinova was born in the mountain town of Razlog, Bulgaria in 1930. She came from a low-income background and she lost her mother at the age of four. Her father raised her and her two brothers. In her early life, she was surrounded by discussion of the revolution and political commitment, with Lagadinova's father being an early supporter of the Bulgarian Communist Party. Additionally, her oldest brother, who was eighteen years older had fled to the Soviet Union to pursue work in the Communist International. Lagadinova experienced the Second World War through her family. Her entire family in some form or another were fighting fascism in her native Razlong. She hid the identities of her family members, namely her brothers, and the actions of her father which were her contributions early in the war. Furthermore, she helped supply nearby villages with necessary resources during the war. At fourteen, Lagadinova committed herself to becoming a freedom fighter with her father and brothers, making her one of the youngest partisans to fight in her area at the time.  World War II  Bulgaria was allied with the Nazis during World War II. In 1941 Bulgaria passed the “Law for the Protection of the Nation,” which eliminated the civil rights of Bulgarian Jews. In 1941, Bulgaria also supported the Germans in the invasion of the Balkans, occupied most of Eastern Yugoslavia and deported up to 20,000 Jews from their occupied territories. Elena Lagadinova's entire family, and much of the resistance fighting against the Nazis at the time, were Communists. In 1944, the Bulgarian monarchy sent the gendarmerie to eliminate the partisan threat and showed up to her family home in Razlog with grenades. She managed to escape to the Pirin Mountains. After escaping to the mountains, Lagadinova started fighting in the summer of 1944 and became the youngest female partisan fighter in Bulgaria during World War II. She started contributing to the war effort at eleven years old, and by fourteen was fighting along with her brothers in World War II against the Nazi allied Bulgarian monarchy. Lagadinova was also an iatak, helper of the other partisans, that would deliver messages to her other family members during the war.Brilliant, Fredda, ed. \\"Madame Elena Lagadinova.\\" In Women in Power, 74-88. New Delhi: Lancer International, 1987. Lagadinova's job was more dangerous, because as an iatak she had to remain within the cities and had a greater chance of getting caught and killed. While Lagadinova survived, her brother Assen was captured and decapitated by the germanderie during the war. Her nickname during the war was “The Amazon” (Амазонка). Throughout the war posters and propaganda slogans were made based on her. She earned her nickname through her courage and tenacity for fighting. From Sofia to Moscow various different children's magazines praised her courage and strength with the slogan for boys and girls to “be brave like the Amazon.\\" After the Allied victory in 1945, Lagadinova was sent to the Soviet Union to complete her education. She studied at the Timiryazev Academy in Moscow, (formally named the Moscow Agricultural Institute) considered to be the “oldest internationally renowned institute in Russia.” There, she earned a doctoral degree in biology.  Contributions to plant genetics  Following the end of the war, Lagadinova pursued a PhD in agrobiology at the Timiryazev Academy in Moscow and conducted additional research in England and Sweden. She returned to Sofia to serve as a research scientist and agricultural geneticist at the Bulgarian Academy of Sciences. She served as a research scientist for thirteen years; her research helped develop a new robust hybrid strand of wheat Triticale which helped boost the productivity of collective farms. In 1959, the Bulgarian government awarded Lagadinvoa the Order of Cyril and Methods to recognize her achievements in the field of plant genetics.  Political career  A Party Cadre assigned to oversee Lagadinova attempted to politically influence the Bulgarian Academy of Science's research program, an action which prompted Lagadinova to write a letter to Soviet Premier Leonid Brezhnev. In her letter, she raised concerns over the Party Cadre's lack of technical expertise interfering with her research efforts and made recommendations for the Soviet Union. Her letter was intercepted by Todor Zhivkov, the General Secretary of the Bulgarian Communist Party. In 1968, Zhivkov coerced Lagadinova to accept a position as the Secretary of the Fatherland Front and president of the Committee of the Bulgarian Women's Movement. The Bulgarian Politburo wished to promote education to ensure the incorporation of women into the formal labour market. The country passed laws that supported the formal training of women in many previously male dominated fields such as engineering and reduced women's dependence on men, through legalizing abortion services and relaxing divorce laws. By 1965, Bulgaria was projected to have the most women in the workforce in the world. These policies resulted in a decrease in the birth rate, which raised concerns for the future labour supply of the state. The state believed that Lagadinova's background in science would aid the state in devising a solution to the declining population. Many government officials began to consider outlawing abortion, like neighboring Romania in order to boost the birth rate. In order to generate data, Lagadinova led the Committee of the Bulgarian Women's Movement (CBWM) to collaborate with the Central Statistical Agency and the editorial board of the Woman Today, the most circulated women's magazine in Bulgaria. In 1969, The CBWM received over 16,000 responses from working women. Their findings indicated that the majority of Bulgarian women wished to have more children, but she felt overworked and unable to balance both work and maternal duties. The survey also revealed that 12% of Bulgarian children under the age of seven were left without supervision during the work day. The CBWM recommended that the state provide women with paid maternity leave and expand the availability of kindergartens and creches. The CBMW also played a large role in the enforcement of legislation that benefits women in the workplace, such as limiting working hours for mothers, and addressing the lack of quality women's clothing. By 1975, Bulgarian women were promised a 120-day maternity leave, with an additional six months of paid leave at the national minimum wage. Women were guaranteed unpaid leave for three years, and after were promised a space in a kindergarten. Employers were legally obligated to hold a woman's position in a mother's absence.  Contribution to internationalism and women's rights  Lagadinova contributed to women's right by improving the lives of families in the Eastern and Western Bloc. During her presidency of the Committee of the Bulgarian Women's Movement (CBWM) she worked with the Women's International Democratic Federation (WIDF) which aimed to bring women both at the eastern and western bloc of the Cold War together to stop the aggression. Elena also provided material and logical support for new women committees and movements across Asia and Africa. At the third World Conference on Women in 1985 in Nairobi, she was elected as a general rapporteur. From that year onwards till 1988, she also became the member of the UN Institute for Training Women. In 1973, thanks to Elena's persistence and advocacy, the Bulgaria government passed a law which allowed maternity leave up to three years for each child, with a guarantee of a secured job and years of maternity counted towards retirement. She also pressured the government to commit to building thousands of new kindergartens. Lagadinova worked with other international activities during the United Nations 1975's International Year of Women, setting up international coalitions of women's organisations in the 1970s and 1980s to pressure governments to fund maternity leaves. Thanks in part to her work, all countries except Papua New Guinea, Suriname, Liberia and the United States, now legally guarantee some form of paid maternity leave.  Awards  In 1959, Lagadinova Lagadinova was awarded the Order of Cyril, by the Government of Bulgaria for her work in plant genetics. In 1991, Lagadinova received the prestigious “Presidential Medal of Outstanding Achievement” by the Claremont Graduate School in California.  Death  In 1989, Lagadinova retired from public life. Twenty-seven years after retirement, Lagadinova had an interview with Kristen Ghodsee, in which she advised, “You must fight for something you believe in.” On October 29, 2017, Lagadinova died in her sleep at Sofia, Bulgaria.

It was created in September 2004 through the merger of the University of Auckland and the Auckland College of Education. Since 2018, the Faculty has been headed by Dean Mark Barrow. History The Faculty of Education was established in 1 September 2004 through a merger of the University of Auckland's School of Education and the Auckland College of Education. The Auckland College of Education had been established in 1881 to provide teacher training in the Auckland region. In 1977, the University of Auckland had established its own School of Education to compete with the Auckland College after the New Zealand Government relaxed its policy on teacher training providers. The Faculty of Education's first Dean was Dr John Langley, who had previously headed the College of Education. In 2008, he was succeeded by Graeme Aitken, who served until late 2017. In 2015 the Faculty changed its name to Faculty of Education and Social Work to better reflect the research and qualifications offered. In 2018, Mark Barrow became the Dean of Education and Social Work. On 30 September 2018, the Dean of Education Mark Barrow confirmed that the Faculty would be relocating from its Epsom campus to the University of Auckland's City Campus. An article in the Herald noted there are plans to sell the site to the Māori tribe Ngāti Whātua. From February 2020 the Faculty will deliver teaching qualifications from a newly established University Campus located in central Manukau. Locations and facilities The Faculty of Education and Social Work's main campus is in Epsom, a suburb in central Auckland. The Faculty also has satellite campuses in Manukau in South Auckland and in Whangarei in Northland. Courses and programs The Faculty of Education and Social Work consists of five schools: the School of Counselling, Human Services and Social Work, the School of Critical Studies in Education, the School of Curriculum and Pedagogy, School of Learning, Development and Professional Practice (LDPP), and the School of Māori and Indigenous Education (Te Puna Wānanga). Other associated institutions include the Centre for Learning and Research in Higher Education (CLEaR) and the Kohia Centre, which focuses on professional development for educators and social workers. The Faculty also offers a range of bachelor, graduate diploma, postgraduate diploma, MA, and PhD education programs at early childhood, primary, and secondary education levels.

It was founded in 1965 in Turin as an avant-garde experimental collective of architects, designers, poets and artists. Its founders were Franco Audrito, Roberta Garosci, Enzo Bertone, Paolo Morello, and Paolo Rondelli. Studio 65 played an important role in the Radical movement in Italian design in 1960-70s. Some of the most famous products designed by them is the Bocca sofa and Capitello chair. Other notable projects include the Leonardo sofa, which became one of the icons of the Radical Design movement, interior design of the Casa Canella apartment, the Palladian Villa, as well as the Barbarella night club. Other members of the Radical design movement from Turin were Piero Gatti-Cesare Paolini-Franco Teodoro, LIBIDARCH, Ceretti-Derossi-Rosso, Guido Drocco, Franco Mello, and Piero Gilardi. Currently the firm has offices in Turin, Jeddah, Riyad and Bali.  Bocca Sofa  Bocca sofa was designed in 1970 as part of the project for a new fitness center in Milan, that Studio 65 was commissioned to complete. The sofa was a tribute to Salvador Dali's surrealistic portrait of Mae West. It was produced by Gufram, an Italian furniture manufacturer. The original name was Marilyn, and it was dedicated to Marilyn Monroe as well as the owner of the gym, Marilyn Garosci. According to one of its designers, Franco Audrito, the sofa \\"spoke out about our obsession with appearance.\\" The Bocca sofa is still in production.  Capitello Chair  The iconic Capitello Chair was created in 1971, and was also manufactured by Gufram. Like most of the design objects created by Radical Design movement, they were controversial and provocative, aiming to destabilize expectations. As a marketing slogan, they used the statement \\"To sit on the past.\\" As M. Didero writes, \\"sitting on history\\" became a clear-cut statement that it was possible to break with traditions and the overwhelming weight of Modernism and to fight for your ideas via imaginative expression.\\" Marilyn/Bocca, Leonardo and Capitello are part of the Vitra Design Museum permanent collection. .

United States, 510 U.S. 163 (1994), is a United States federal court case in which the Supreme Court of the United States decided that commissioned military officers, who are appointed by the President by and with the advice and consent of the United States Senate, may be assigned to act as military judges without the need to be confirmed a second time by the Senate. Facts The Petitioner Eric J. Weiss was a member of the United States Marine Corps who pled guilty to one count of larceny in violation of the Uniform Code of Military Justice. Upon review, the Navy-Marine Corps Court of Military Review affirmed the conviction. Weiss appealed to the Court of Military Appeals, arguing the judges in his case had no authority to convict him because they had not been properly appointed under the Appointments Clause. The military trial judge who presided over his case was assigned to the same by the case by the Judge Advocate General of the service from among those United States military officers appointed by the President and confirmed by the Senate. Weiss argued the assignment was invalid and that the military judge was required to be appointed by the President rather than assigned by the Judge Advocate General. The Court of Military Appeals rejected this argument, affirmed his conviction. Decision A unanimous Supreme Court ruled against Weiss, holding the method of appointment of the military judge was constitutional. The Court began by ruling that military judges are officers of the United States because they exercise significant authority under the laws of the United States and, therefore, must be appointed in conformity with the Appointments Clause. However, all military judges, as military officers, are appointed by the President and confirmed the Senate. Weiss argued that, prior, to assuming duties as a military judge, the military officer had to be reappointed. The Court rejected this argument, holding that military officers may be assigned to different duties within the military without running afoul of the Appointments Clause as long as the new assignment is germane to the office for which they were originally appointed. As all military officer have a duty to exercise control over the armed forces, serving a military judge was germane.

November 2018 17 November: \\"Act I\\" Gilets jaunes protest in Mont-de-Marsan, Landes A protest on 17 November cutting the road near Belfort The protests began on 17 November 2018, and attracted more than 300,000 people across France with protesters constructing barricades and blocking roads. John Lichfield, a journalist who witnessed the riots, described them as insurrectional. In addition to roads, protesters also blocked as many as ten fuel depots. On this first day of protests, a 63-year- old pensioner was run over by a motorist in Le Pont-de-Beauvoisin while she was demonstrating at a roundabout at the entrance to a commercial zone. A motorcyclist died after being struck the same day by a van trying to get around a barricade. By 21 November casualties had climbed to 585 civilians and 115 police injured, with 16 civilians and 3 police severely wounded. Protests also occurred in the French overseas region of Réunion, where the situation developed into looting and riots. Schools on the island were closed for three days after protesters blocked access to roads. On 21 November, President Macron ordered the deployment of troops to the island to calm the violence. 24 November: \\"Act II\\" With the protests in Paris having raised tensions the previous week, the Interior Ministry agreed to allow a gathering on 24 November at the Champ de Mars. The protests attracted 106,000 people all across France, only 8,000 of whom were in Paris, where the protests turned violent. Protesters lit fires in the streets, tore down signs, built barricades and pulled up cobblestones. Police resorted to tear gas and water cannons to disperse the protesters. On 26 November, an official estimated that the riots in Paris during the two previous days had cost up to €1.5m in damage. Two hundred additional workers were assigned to assist with the cleanup and repair work. December 2018 1 December: \\"Act III\\" A gilets jaunes demonstration in Belfort on 1 December A protest called \\"Act 3 – Macron Quits\\" was organised for 1 December. Yellow jackets briefly occupied the runway at Nantes Atlantique Airport and prevented access to Nice Côte d'Azur Airport. Vinci Autoroutes reported tollbooths were blocked on 20 major arteries all across France. In Marseille, where demonstrations have been frequent since the 5 November collapse of a building and the evacuation of the surrounding neighbourhood, an 80-year-old Algerian woman trying to close her shutters was hit by shards from a police tear gas canister, later dying while in surgery. A second motorist was killed on the third weekend after crashing his van into stopped lorries at a barricade on the Arles bypass. More than 100 cars were burned in Paris during the protest on 1 December, and the Arc de Triomphe was vandalised. On the following Monday, Paris Mayor Anne Hidalgo estimated the property damages at €3–4 million. 8 December: \\"Act IV\\" A gilets jaunes demonstration in Paris on 8 December 2018 Protests turned violent for the second week in a row in Le Puy-en-Velay. Civil unrest marred the Festival of Lights in both Lyon and Saint-Étienne. The A6 motorway was again blocked north of Lyon in Villefranche-sur-Saône. In Bordeaux, after two hours of skirmishes between the police and protesters, rioters took advantage of the situation to set fires and pillage the local Apple Store. Paris experienced protests for the fourth consecutive week. Many shops were boarded up in anticipation of violence, with The Louvre, Eiffel Tower and the Paris Opera also closed. Police assembled steel fences around the Élysée Palace and deployed armoured vehicles on the streets in an attempt to limit the violence. 10 December: Macron's televised address In his 10 December speech to the French people in response to the movement, Macron pledged a €100 per month increase in the minimum wage in 2019, the exclusion of charges and taxes on overtime hours in 2019, and on any 2018 end-of-year bonuses paid to employees. Macron likewise announced that pensioners on low incomes would be excluded from an increase in the CSG in 2019. He stood by his replacement of the solidarity tax on wealth with increases in property taxes. The broadcast was watched by more than 23 million people, making it the most-viewed political speech in French history. After investigation, it became apparent that the minimum wage itself would not be raised by €100 a month but that those eligible would see an increase in the activity bonus paid by the CAF. On 11 December, after having declared a state of economic and social emergency the day before, Macron invited representatives of the French banks to the Elysée to announce that the banks had agreed to freeze their prices in 2019 and to permanently limit incident-related fees to €25 a month for people in extreme financial difficulty, as determined by the Bank of France. 15 December: \\"Act V\\" In the wake of the 2018 Strasbourg attack, the government asked protesters to stay off the streets. According to the Paris prefecture estimates, there were 8,000 police for 2,200 demonstrators in Paris. The Minister of the Interior estimated that 66,000 people protested in France on 15 December. Conflict arose in Bordeaux, Toulouse, Marseille, Lyon and Paris. At the end of the day, the Interior Minister called for the roundabouts, occupied since 17 November, to be liberated. 22 December: \\"Act VI\\" A gilets jaunes demonstration in Belfort on 22 December Demonstrations continued throughout the country. The Ministry of the Interior announced a participation figure almost half that of the previous week with 38,600 demonstrators throughout France, including 2,000 in Paris according to the Prefecture of Police. Versailles Palace was preventively closed for the day. Éric Drouet, the 33-year-old truck driver who is one of the most followed yellow jackets on Facebook, was arrested for organising an undeclared demonstration and participating in a violent assembly. He had called on Facebook for demonstrators to meet at Versailles but then revised the call to Montmartre after it had been announced that Versailles would be closed. Authorities say that Drouet was carrying a truncheon and would be summoned in court where they would seek to prevent him from coming to Paris. Protesters blocked border traffic to Switzerland at Cluse-et-Mijoux. They were dispersed after one hour by police. Similar operations were conducted at the Spanish, Italian, German, and Belgian borders. Two distribution platforms were blocked in Montélimar: EasyDis (Groupe Casino) and Amazon. Overall, at least 220 people were arrested in the country, including 142 in Paris. A motorist was killed on 21 December when his car hit a truck that was stopped at a blockade in Perpignan, the tenth fatality overall. 29 December: \\"Act VII\\" Demonstrations in front of Radio France (Paris) Much quieter than in the first weeks on a national level, there was a significant confrontation in Rouen, Normandy, after fires were set in front of the local branch of the Banque de France. In Paris, the protesters demonstrated in front of the headquarters of BFM-TV, Libération and France Télévisions. Victor Glad suggests that the same crisis of representation motivating the citizens' initiative referenda is also behind the gilets jaunes criticism of the traditional media. January 2019 5 January: \\"Act VIII\\" According to French Ministry of the Interior, the first demonstrations of 2019 brought 50,000 people into the streets across France. A door to Rennes' city hall was damaged, while government Spokesman Benjamin Griveaux was evacuated from his office on Rue de Grenelle (Paris) through the garden, after rioters hijacked a forklift to break down the door to the Ministry. There were also skirmishes in Bordeaux, Nantes, Caen & Rennes. Women's role, both in defining the movement's objectives and in communicating at roundabouts, is--for editorialist Pierre Rimbert--a reflection of the fact that women make up the majority of workers in \\"intermediary professions\\" but are three times more likely to be classed as \\"employees\\" than men according to an INSEE study in 2017. Women organized separate demonstrations in Paris, Toulouse and Caen. According to one of the organizers, the goal was to have a \\"channel of communication other than violence\\". A civil servant and former light-heavyweight boxing champion was filmed fighting with two gendarmes on a footbridge about one of the gendarmes' use of force. One month later the civil servant was sentenced to serve one year of sleeping in jail, which allowed him to continue to work. The interior minister announced that over 60% of the traffic enforcement cameras in the country had been vandalised. This was up from estimates of 50% in early December. 12 January: \\"Act IX\\" Attendance increased in the ninth straight weekend of protests, with at least 84,000 demonstrating on 12 January for economic reform across France, including 8,000 in Paris, 6,000 in Bourges, 6,000 in Bordeaux, and 2,000 in Strasbourg. Government officials deployed 80,000 security forces nationwide, vowing \\"zero tolerance\\" for violence. The CRS (riot police) resorted to tear gas in most major cities. On the streets of Paris, protesters marching \\"noisily but mostly peacefully\\", singing the French national anthem, were met by 5,000 riot police officers, armored vehicles and barricades. Citing the 5 January attack on the Dijon gendarmerie and terror threats, the police communication service said that some CRS agents were authorized to carry semi-automatic weapons. This was confirmed by the Paris prefecture. Small groups of people left the designated protest route and threw projectiles at police. Around the Arc de Triomphe, riot police fired water cannon and tear gas at protesters after being hit with stones and paint. 244 people were arrested nationwide; 156 in Paris. A \\"massive\\" gas explosion caused by an apparent gas leak in a bakery in northern Paris killed four people, including two firefighters already at the scene investigating the leak, and injured dozens more. The explosions occurred early on 12 January, while Paris was under heavy guard in anticipation of the day's demonstrations. The French Interior Minister told the media that \\"responsibility triumphed over the temptation of confrontation\\" and that protesters marched in Paris \\"without serious incident\\". 19 January: \\"Act X\\" Tribute to the dead during the movement (Paris, act 10) As in week IX, police estimated that 84,000 people demonstrated across France, including a peak of 10,000 in Toulouse for a short period, 7,000 in Paris (where protesters demonstrated on the Left Bank for the first time), 4,000 in Bordeaux, and 2,500 in both Marseille and Angers. This weekly protest is the first to happen after the launch of the \\"Great National Debate\\" by President Emmanuel Macron. 26 January: \\"Act XI\\" Nationwide demonstrations continued for an eleventh straight week on Saturday, 26 January. The French interior ministry estimated crowds of 69,000 across the country, and local police estimated 4,000 in Paris. A high-profile member of the protest movement, Jérôme Rodrigues, was maimed after being shot in the face by police with a flash-ball launcher, resulting in the loss of his right eye. Dozens of people have been similarly injured during the course of the yellow vests protests. \\"I was deliberately targeted. I am a figure of the movement, at least in the Paris protests, and police pointed their fingers at me many times during previous demonstrations, so I think they knew very well who they were shooting at,\\" Rodrigues told the media. The following day, an estimated 10,000 people marched in Paris in a foulards rouges (\\"red scarves\\") counter-protest in opposition to the yellow vests. February 2019 2 February: \\"Act XII\\" On Friday, 1 February 2019, Edouard Philippe went to Bordeaux and informed merchants that an agreement had been found with insurers to treat insurance damage claims in successive weeks as part of a single event (with a single deductible). He also announced that the ten cities most affected by degradations, including Bordeaux, would receive €300,000. On Saturday, 2 February, between 10,000 and 13,800 people protested in Paris, with thousands more in Tours, Valence, Marseille, Bordeaux, Toulouse, and other French cities. In Valence, the downtown shopping district was boarded up; the city had removed trash cans, park benches and protective fencing around trees in preparation. Paving stones had been tarred over to eliminate the risk of their being used as projectiles. According to the préfecture, 1850 people demonstrated in downtown Tours, which had likewise been boarded up. A Gilets jaunes protest in Paris, 9 February 2019 The demonstrations of \\"Act XII\\" focused on denouncing the number of serious injuries caused by police violence during anti-government demonstrations. According to the French government, around 2,000 civilians were injured in protests between November 2018 and February 2019, including four serious eye injuries. The government agency that investigates police abuses has opened 116 investigations into police conduct during the protests, ten of which concern serious eye injuries suffered by protesters. A group of 59 lawyers published an open letter denouncing the treatment of protesters in the courts, including rushed judgments against protesters without regard for their rights, which they contrasted with the slow pace of investigations into reports of police violence. Earlier in the week, France's highest court denied a request to ban police from using \\"flash balls\\" or \\"defensive ball launchers\\", known as LBDs, that shoot rubber projectiles, which have been blamed for a number of serious injuries. French Interior Minister Christophe Castaner admitted in media interviews that the weapon could cause injuries and had been used more than 9,000 times since yellow vests demonstrations began. The day before the Act XII protests, the government warned the public that police would not hesitate to use the weapons to combat violence by demonstrators, since they had been authorized by the court. On Saturday, thousands in Paris participated in a \\"march of the injured\\" calling for the weapon to be banned. Injured protesters marched at the front, some wearing eye patches with a target sign on them. Jerome Rodrigues, a well-known participant in the movement who lost an eye in the previous week's demonstrations, was received warmly with applause by the crowds. Most of the demonstrations during Act XII were peaceful. As in prior weeks, 80,000 security officials had been mobilized, including 5,000 in Paris. In Paris, police used tear gas and water cannons at Place de la Republique in the city centre to force demonstrators back after clashes with protesters, some hooded or masked, and some who set fire to bins and a scooter. Despite these incidents, the media reported that demonstrations \\"remained relatively calm compared to previous weekends.\\" Two police officers were injured and two protesters arrested in Morlaix; two officers injured and one demonstrator arrested in Nantes; and in Lille, where between 1,800 and 3,000 protesters marched, 20 were arrested. The twelfth week of protests occurred as the French parliament was considering a new law proposed by Macron's governing party restricting the right to protest. The proposed law would outlaw covering one's face during a street demonstration (whether with a helmet, mask, or scarf), punishable by a €15,000 fine or imprisonment, and allow local police to establish blacklists of people not allowed to participate in street protests. The proposed law was opposed by some members of parliament inside and outside Macron's party. 16 February: \\"Act XIV\\"  Bordeaux, 9 Feb. 2019 About 41,500 protesters (5,000 in Paris) took to the streets again on Saturday 16 February, for the 14th consecutive weekend. In Paris, a group of individuals involved in the march confronted the high-profile Jewish philosopher and academician Alain Finkielkraut with anti-Semitic verbal abuse. Police stepped in to protect him, and Macron later said that this behaviour was an \\"absolute negation\\" of what made France great and would not be tolerated. The man leading the insults against the philosopher on published video-recordings of the event was detained for questioning on Tuesday on charges of hate speech. Police indicated he was close to the Salafi movement in 2014. March 2019 16 March: \\"Act XVIII\\"  Leaders of the movement stated on 8 March 2019 that a protest (which had already been dubbed \\"The Ultimatum\\") was currently being planned for the following weekend of 16 March. 200 people were taken into custody in Paris after the Champs-Elysées was again targeted by rioters. Luxury stores including Fouquet's, Hugo Boss and Xiaomi were among the 80 businesses damaged, pillaged or set ablaze. Anne Hidalgo, the Mayor of Paris, called upon the government to do something about the political and social fracture. In response, the French government announced it would deploy the military, in addition to extra police and gendarmery forces. The soldiers will be drafted from Operation Sentinelle, active since the January 2015 terror attacks in Paris.

The \\"Laws of Manu,\\" a Hindu treatise on statecraft (c. 400 BC) forbids the use of poison and fire arrows, but advises poisoning food and water. Kautilya's \\"Arthashastra\\", a statecraft manual of the same era, contains hundreds of recipes for creating poison weapons, toxic smokes, and other chemical weapons. Ancient Greek historians recount that Alexander the Great encountered poison arrows and fire incendiaries in India at the Indus basin in the 4th century BC. The Art of War described the use of fire weapons against the enemy. Arsenical smokes were known to the Chinese as far back as c. 1000 BC and Sun Tzu's \\"Art of War\\" (c. 200 BC) advises the use of fire weapons. In the second century BC, writings of the Mohist sect in China describe the use of bellows to pump smoke from burning balls of toxic plants and vegetables into tunnels being dug by a besieging army. Other Chinese writings dating around the same period contain hundreds of recipes for the production of poisonous or irritating smokes for use in war along with numerous accounts of their use. These accounts describe an arsenic-containing \\"soul-hunting fog\\", and the use of finely divided lime dispersed into the air to suppress a peasant revolt in 178 AD. The earliest recorded use of gas warfare in the West dates back to the fifth century BC, during the Peloponnesian War between Athens and Sparta. Spartan forces besieging an Athenian city placed a lighted mixture of wood, pitch, and sulfur under the walls hoping that the noxious smoke would incapacitate the Athenians, so that they would not be able to resist the assault that followed. Sparta was not alone in its use of unconventional tactics in ancient Greece; Solon of Athens is said to have used hellebore roots to poison the water in an aqueduct leading from the River Pleistos around 590 BC during the siege of Kirrha. The earliest archaeological evidence of gas warfare is during the Roman–Persian wars. Research carried out on the collapsed tunnels at Dura-Europos in Syria suggests that during the siege of the town in the third century AD, the Sassanians used bitumen and sulfur crystals to get it burning. When ignited, the materials gave off dense clouds of choking sulfur dioxide gases which killed 19 Roman soldiers and a single Sassanian, purported to be the fire- tender, in a matter of two minutes.Science Daily, dated January 19, 2009 Sciencedaily.com“Death Underground: Gas Warfare at Dura-Europos,” Current Archaeology, November 26, 2009 (online feature) http://www.archaeology.co.uk/cwa/world-news/death-underground-gas-warfare-at- dura-europos.htm (accessed October 3, 2014)Samir S.

Quicklime (the old name for calcium oxide) may have been used in medieval naval warfare - up to the use of \\"lime-mortars\\" to throw it at the enemy ships.Sayers W. The Use of Quicklime in Medieval Naval Warfare // The Mariner's Mirror. - Volume 92 (2006). - Issue 3. - PP. 262-269. Historian and philosopher David Hume, in his history of England, recounts how in the reign of Henry III (r.1216 - 1272) the English Navy destroyed an invading French fleet, by blinding the enemy fleet with quicklime. D’Albiney employed a stratagem against them, which is said to have contributed to the victory: Having gained the wind of the French, he came down upon them with violence; and gassing a great quantity of quicklime, which he purposely carried on board, he so blinded them, that they were disabled from defending themselves.David Hume, History of England, Volume II. In the late 15th century, Spanish conquistadors encountered a rudimentary type of chemical warfare on the island of Hispaniola. The Taíno threw gourds filled with ashes and ground hot peppers at the Spaniards to create a blinding smoke screen before launching their attack. Early modern era Christoph Bernhard von Galen tried to use toxic fumes during the siege of the city of Groningen in 1672. Leonardo da Vinci proposed the use of a powder of sulfide, arsenic and verdigris in the 15th century: :throw poison in the form of powder upon galleys. Chalk, fine sulfide of arsenic, and powdered verdegris may be thrown among enemy ships by means of small mangonels, and all those who, as they breathe, inhale the powder into their lungs will become asphyxiated. It is unknown whether this powder was ever actually used. In the 17th century during sieges, armies attempted to start fires by launching incendiary shells filled with sulfur, tallow, rosin, turpentine, saltpeter, and/or antimony. Even when fires were not started, the resulting smoke and fumes provided a considerable distraction. Although their primary function was never abandoned, a variety of fills for shells were developed to maximize the effects of the smoke. In 1672, during his siege of the city of Groningen, Christoph Bernhard von Galen, the Bishop of Münster, employed several different explosive and incendiary devices, some of which had a fill that included Deadly Nightshade, intended to produce toxic fumes. Just three years later, August 27, 1675, the French and the Holy Roman Empire concluded the Strasbourg Agreement, which included an article banning the use of \\"perfidious and odious\\" toxic devices. Industrial era Lyon Playfair proposed the industrial manufacture of cyanide artillery shells for use during the Crimean War. The modern notion of chemical warfare emerged from the mid-19th century, with the development of modern chemistry and associated industries. The first recorded modern proposal for the use of chemical warfare was made by Lyon Playfair, Secretary of the Science and Art Department, in 1854 during the Crimean War. He proposed a cacodyl cyanide artillery shell for use against enemy ships as way to solve the stalemate during the siege of Sevastopol. The proposal was backed by Admiral Thomas Cochrane of the Royal Navy. It was considered by the Prime Minister, Lord Palmerston, but the British Ordnance Department rejected the proposal as \\"as bad a mode of warfare as poisoning the wells of the enemy.\\" Playfair's response was used to justify chemical warfare into the next century: :There was no sense in this objection. It is considered a legitimate mode of warfare to fill shells with molten metal which scatters among the enemy, and produced the most frightful modes of death. Why a poisonous vapor which would kill men without suffering is to be considered illegitimate warfare is incomprehensible. War is destruction, and the more destructive it can be made with the least suffering the sooner will be ended that barbarous method of protecting national rights. No doubt in time chemistry will be used to lessen the suffering of combatants, and even of criminals condemned to death. Later, during the American Civil War, New York school teacher John Doughty proposed the offensive use of chlorine gas, delivered by filling a 10-inch (254 millimeter) artillery shell with two to three quarts (1.892.84 liters) of liquid chlorine, which could produce many cubic feet of chlorine gas. Doughty's plan was apparently never acted on, as it was probably presented to Brigadier General James Wolfe Ripley, Chief of Ordnance. A general concern over the use of poison gas manifested itself in 1899 at the Hague Conference with a proposal prohibiting shells filled with asphyxiating gas. The proposal was passed, despite a single dissenting vote from the United States. The American representative, Navy Captain Alfred Thayer Mahan, justified voting against the measure on the grounds that \\"the inventiveness of Americans should not be restricted in the development of new weapons.\\" World War I Gas casualties from the Battle of Estaires, April 10, 1918 A Smelling Case to allow officers to identify the gas by smell and thus act appropriately for protection and treatment The Hague Declaration of 1899 and the Hague Convention of 1907 forbade the use of \\"poison or poisoned weapons\\" in warfare, yet more than 124,000 tons of gas were produced by the end of World War I. The French were the first to use chemical weapons during the First World War, using the tear gases ethyl bromoacetate and chloroacetone. They likely did not realize that effects might be more serious under wartime conditions than in riot control. It is also likely that their use of tear gas escalated to the use of poisonous gases. A Canadian soldier with mustard gas burns, ca. 1917–1918. One of Germany's earliest uses of chemical weapons occurred on October 27, 1914, when shells containing the irritant dianisidine chlorosulfonate were fired at British troops near Neuve-Chapelle, France. Germany used another irritant, xylyl bromide, in artillery shells that were fired in January 1915 at the Russians near Bolimów, in present-day Poland.\\"The First World War\\" (a Channel 4 documentary based on the book by Hew Strachan) The first full-scale deployment of deadly chemical warfare agents during World War I was at the Second Battle of Ypres, on April 22, 1915, when the Germans attacked French, Canadian and Algerian troops with chlorine gas. A total 50,965 tons of pulmonary, lachrymatory, and vesicant agents were deployed by both sides of the conflict, including chlorine, phosgene, and mustard gas. Official figures declare about 1.3 million casualties directly caused by chemical warfare agents during the course of the war. Of these, an estimated 100,000-260,000 casualties were civilians. Nearby civilian towns were at risk from winds blowing the poison gases through. Civilians rarely had a warning system put into place to alert their neighbors of the danger. In addition to poor warning systems, civilians often did not have access to effective gas masks. Football team of British soldiers with gas masks, Western Front, 1916 World War I-era chemical ammunition is still found, unexploded, at former battle, storage, or test sites and poses an ongoing threat to inhabitants of Belgium, France and other countries. Camp American University where American chemical weapons were developed and later buried, has undergone 20 years of remediation efforts. After the war, the most common method of disposal of chemical weapons was to dump them into the nearest large body of water. As many as 65,000 tons of chemical warfare agents may have been dumped in the Baltic Sea alone; agents dumped in that sea included mustard gas, phosgene, lewisite (β-chlorovinyldichloroarsine), adamsite (diphenylaminechloroarsine), Clark I (diphenylchloroarsine) and Clark II (diphenylcyanoarsine). Over time the containers corrode, and the chemicals leaked out. On the sea floor, at low temperatures, mustard gas tends to form lumps within a \\"skin\\" of chemical byproducts. These lumps can wash onto shore, where they look like chunks of waxy yellowish clay. They are extremely toxic, but the effects may not be immediately apparent. Interwar years Between World War I and World War II, chemical agents were occasionally used to subdue populations and suppress rebellion. Lenin's Soviet government employed poison gas in 1921 during the Tambov Rebellion. An order signed by military commanders Tukhachevsky and Vladimir Antonov-Ovseyenko stipulated, \\"The forests where the bandits are hiding are to be cleared by the use of poison gas. This must be carefully calculated, so that the layer of gas penetrates the forests and kills everyone hiding there.\\"Nicolas Werth, Karel Bartošek, Jean-Louis Panné, Jean-Louis Margolin, Andrzej Paczkowski, Stéphane Courtois, The Black Book of Communism: Crimes, Terror, Repression, Harvard University Press, 1999, hardcover, 858 pages, During the Rif War in Spanish Morocco in 1921–1927, combined Spanish and French forces dropped mustard gas bombs in an attempt to put down the Berber rebellion. (See also: Chemical weapons in the Rif War) In 1925, 16 of the world's major nations signed the Geneva Protocol, thereby pledging never to use gas in warfare again. Notably, while the United States delegation under Presidential authority signed the Protocol, it languished in the U.S. Senate until 1975, when it was finally ratified.  Use by Italians in Libya and Ethiopia  In violation of the Geneva Protocol,Ronald Bruce St John, Libya: Continuity and Change (Routledge, 2015), p. 16. Italy used mustard gas and other \\"gruesome measures\\" against Senussi forces in Libya (see Pacification of Libya, Italian colonization of Libya).Saskia van Genugten, Libya in Western Foreign Policies, 1911–2011 (Palgrave Macmillan, 2016), p. 31.

Tucker, \\"Senussi and Sultan of Darfur Rebellions\\" in Encyclopedia of Insurgency and Counterinsurgency: A New Era of Modern Warfare (ed. Spencer C. Tucker: ABC- CLIO, 2013), p. 498. Beginning in October 1935 and continuing into the following months Fascist Italy used mustard gas against the Ethiopians during the Second Italo-Abyssinian War in violation of the Geneva Protocol. Italian general Rodolfo Graziani first ordered the use of chemical weapons at Gorrahei against the forces of Ras Nasibu.\\"Chemical Weapons\\" in Historical Dictionary of Ethiopia, 2d ed. (eds. David H. Shinn & Thomas P. Ofcansky: Scarecrow Press, 2013). Benito Mussolini personally authorized Graziani to use chemical weapons.Rainer Baudendistel, Between Bombs and Good Intentions: The International Committee of the Red Cross and the Italo-Ethiopian War, 1935-1936, pp. 264-67. Chemical weapons dropped by warplane \\"proved to be very effective\\" and was used \\"on a massive scale against civilians and troops, as well as to contaminate fields and water supplies.\\"William R. Cullen, Is Arsenic an Aphrodisiac?: The Sociochemistry of an Element (Royal Society of Chemistry, 2008), p. 241. Among the most intense chemical bombardment by the Italian Air Force in Ethiopia occurred in February and March 1936, although \\"gas warfare continued, with varying intensity, until March 1939.\\" J. F. C. Fuller, who was present in Ethiopia during the conflict, stated that mustard gas \\"was the decisive tactical factor in the war.\\"Jeffrey Legro, Cooperation Under Fire: Anglo-German Restraint During World War II (Cornell University Press, 2005). Some estimate that up to one-third of Ethiopian casualties of the war were caused by chemical weapons.Walter Laqueur, The New Terrorism: Fanaticism and the Arms of Mass Destruction (Oxford University Press, 1999), p. 57. The Italians' deployment of mustard gas prompted international criticism. In April 1936, British Prime Minister Stanley Baldwin told Parliament: \\"If a great European nation, in spite of having given its signature to the Geneva Protocol against the use of such gases, employs them in Africa, what guarantee have we that they may not be used in Europe?\\"Edward M. Spiers, Chemical and Biological Weapons: A Study of Proliferation (Macmillan: 1994). Mussolini initially denied the use of chemical weapons; later, Mussolini and Italian government sought to justify their use as lawful retaliation for Ethiopian atrocities. After the liberation of Ethiopia in 1941, Ethiopia repeatedly but unsuccessfully sought to prosecute Italian war criminals. The Allied powers excluded Ethiopia from the United Nations War Crimes Commission (established 1942) because the British feared that Ethiopia would seek to prosecute Pietro Badoglio, who had ordered the use of chemical gas in the Second Italo-Abyssinian War, but later \\"became a valuable ally against the Axis powers\\" after the fascist regime of Mussolini fell and, after the rise of the Italian Social Republic, Italy became a co-belligerent of the Allies. In 1946, the Ethiopians under Haile Selassie again sought \\"to prosecute senior Italian officials who had sanctioned the use of chemical weapons and had omitted other war crimes such as torturing and executing Ethiopian prisoners and citizens during the Italian-Ethiopian War.\\" These attempts failed, in large part because Britain and the U.S. wished to avoid alienating the Italian government at a time when Italy was seen as key to containing the Soviet Union. Following World War II, the Italian government denied that Italy had ever used chemical weapons in Africa; only in 1995 did Italy formally acknowledge that it had used chemical weapons in colonial wars.\\"Introduction\\" in Italian Colonialism (eds. Ruth Ben-Ghiat & Mia Fuller: Palgrave Macmillan, 2005), p. 6. Nerve agents The chemical structure of sarin nerve gas, developed in Germany in 1939 Shortly after the end of World War I, Germany's General Staff enthusiastically pursued a recapture of their preeminent position in chemical warfare. In 1923, Hans von Seeckt pointed the way, by suggesting that German poison gas research move in the direction of delivery by aircraft in support of mobile warfare. Also in 1923, at the behest of the German army, poison gas expert Dr. Hugo Stoltzenberg negotiated with the USSR to build a huge chemical weapons plant at Trotsk, on the Volga river. Collaboration between Germany and the USSR in poison gas continued on and off through the 1920s. In 1924, German officers debated the use of poison gas versus non-lethal chemical weapons against civilians. Chemical warfare was revolutionized by Nazi Germany's discovery of the nerve agents tabun (in 1937) and sarin (in 1939) by Gerhard Schrader, a chemist of IG Farben. IG Farben was Germany's premier poison gas manufacturer during World War II, so the weaponization of these agents cannot be considered accidental.Corum, James S., The Roots of Blitzkrieg, University Press of Kansas, USA, 1992, pp.106-107. Both were turned over to the German Army Weapons Office prior to the outbreak of the war. The nerve agent soman was later discovered by Nobel Prize laureate Richard Kuhn and his collaborator Konrad Henkel at the Kaiser Wilhelm Institute for Medical Research in Heidelberg in spring 1944. The Germans developed and manufactured large quantities of several agents, but chemical warfare was not extensively used by either side. Chemical troops were set up (in Germany since 1934) and delivery technology was actively developed. World War II Imperial Japanese Army Chapei in the Battle of Shanghai Despite the 1899 Hague Declaration IV, 2 - Declaration on the Use of Projectiles the Object of Which is the Diffusion of Asphyxiating or Deleterious Gases, Article 23 (a) of the 1907 Hague Convention IV - The Laws and Customs of War on Land, and a resolution adopted against Japan by the League of Nations on May 14, 1938, the Imperial Japanese Army frequently used chemical weapons. Because of fear of retaliation, however, those weapons were never used against Westerners, but against other Asians judged \\"inferior\\" by imperial propaganda. According to historians Yoshiaki Yoshimi and Kentaro Awaya, gas weapons, such as tear gas, were used only sporadically in 1937 but in early 1938, the Imperial Japanese Army began full-scale use of sneeze and nausea gas (red), and from mid-1939, used mustard gas (yellow) against both Kuomintang and Communist Chinese troops.Yuki Tanaka, Poison Gas, the Story Japan Would Like to Forget, Bulletin of the Atomic Scientists, October 1988, p. 16-17 According to historians Yoshiaki Yoshimi and Seiya Matsuno, the chemical weapons were authorized by specific orders given by Emperor Hirohito himself, transmitted by the chief of staff of the army. For example, the Emperor authorized the use of toxic gas on 375 separate occasions during the Battle of Wuhan from August to October 1938.Y. Yoshimi and S. Matsuno, Dokugasusen Kankei Shiryô II, Kaisetsu, Jugonen Sensô Gokuhi Shiryoshu, 1997, p.27-29 They were also profusely used during the invasion of Changde. Those orders were transmitted either by prince Kotohito Kan'in or general Hajime Sugiyama.Yoshimi and Matsuno, idem, Herbert Bix, Hirohito and the Making of Modern Japan, 2001, p.360-364 The Imperial Japanese Army had used mustard gas and the US-developed (CWS-1918) blister agent lewisite against Chinese troops and guerrillas. Experiments involving chemical weapons were conducted on live prisoners (Unit 731 and Unit 516). The Japanese also carried chemical weapons as they swept through Southeast Asia towards Australia. Some of these items were captured and analyzed by the Allies. Historian Geoff Plunkett has recorded how Australia covertly imported 1,000,000 chemical weapons from the United Kingdom from 1942 onwards and stored them in many storage depots around the country, including three tunnels in the Blue Mountains to the west of Sydney. They were to be used as a retaliatory measure if the Japanese first used chemical weapons. Buried chemical weapons have been recovered at Marrangaroo and Columboola. Nazi Germany Battle of Kerch, May 1942. During the Holocaust, a genocide perpetrated by Nazi Germany, millions of Jews and other victims were gassed with carbon monoxide and hydrogen cyanide (including Zyklon B).Patrick Coffey, American Arsenal: A Century of Weapon Technology and Strategy (Oxford University Press, 2014), p. 152-54.James J. Wirtz, \\"Weapons of Mass Destruction\\" in Contemporary Security Studies (4th ed.), ed. Alan Collins, Contemporary Security Studies (Oxford University Press, 2016), p. 302. This remains the deadliest use of poison gas in history. Nevertheless, the Nazis did not extensively use chemical weapons in combat, at least not against the Western Allies,Callum Borchers, Sean Spicer takes his questionable claims to a new level in Hitler-Assad comparison, The Washington Post (April 11, 2017). despite maintaining an active chemical weapons program in which the Nazis used concentration camp prisoners as forced labor to secretly manufacture tabun, a nerve gas, and experimented upon concentration camp victims to test the effects of the gas. Otto Ambros of IG Farben was a chief chemical-weapons expert for the Nazis.Germany and the Second World War, Vol. 5, Issue 2 (Clarendon Press, 2003), p. 764. The Nazis' decision to avoid the use of chemical weapons on the battlefield has been variously attributed to a lack of technical ability in the German chemical weapons program and fears that the Allies would retaliate with their own chemical weapons. It also has been speculated to have arisen from the personal experiences of Adolf Hitler as a soldier in the Kaiser's army during World War I, where he was gassed by British troops in 1918. After the Battle of Stalingrad, Joseph Goebbels, Robert Ley, and Martin Bormann urged Hitler to approve the use of tabun and other chemical weapons to slow the Soviet advance. At a May 1943 meeting in the Wolf's Lair, however, Hitler was told by Ambros that Germany had 45,000 tons of chemical gas stockpiled, but that the Allies likely had far more. Hitler responded by suddenly leaving the room and ordering production of tabun and sarin to be doubled, but \\"fearing some rogue officer would use them and spark Allied retaliation, he ordered that no chemical weapons be transported to the Russian front.\\" After the Allied invasion of Italy, the Germans rapidly moved to remove or destroy both German and Italian chemical-weapon stockpiles, \\"for the same reason that Hitler had ordered them pulled from the Russian front--they feared that local commanders would use them and trigger Allied chemical retaliation.\\" Stanley P. Lovell, Deputy Director for Research and Development of the Office of Strategic Services, reports in his book Of Spies and Stratagems that the Allies knew the Germans had quantities of Gas Blau available for use in the defense of the Atlantic Wall. The use of nerve gas on the Normandy beachhead would have seriously impeded the Allies and possibly caused the invasion to fail altogether. He submitted the question \\"Why was nerve gas not used in Normandy?\\" to be asked of Hermann Göring during his interrogation after the war had ended. Göring answered that the reason was that the Wehrmacht was dependent upon horse-drawn transport to move supplies to their combat units, and had never been able to devise a gas mask horses could tolerate; the versions they developed would not pass enough pure air to allow the horses to pull a cart. Thus, gas was of no use to the German Army under most conditions.Stanley P. Lovell, Of Spies & Strategems (Englewood Cliffs, New Jersey: Prentice-Hall, 1963), p. 78. The Nazis did use chemical weapons in combat on several occasions along the Black Sea, notably in Sevastopol, where they used toxic smoke to force Russian resistance fighters out of caverns below the city, in violation of the 1925 Geneva Protocol.Chris Bellamy, Absolute War: Soviet Russia in the Second World War (Knopf, 2008). The Nazis also used asphyxiating gas in the catacombs of Odessa in November 1941, following their capture of the city, and in late May 1942 during the Battle of the Kerch Peninsula in eastern Crimea. Victor Israelyan, a Soviet ambassador, reported that the latter incident was perpetrated by the Wehrmacht's Chemical Forces and organized by a special detail of SS troops with the help of a field engineer battalion. Chemical Forces General Ochsner reported to German command in June 1942 that a chemical unit had taken part in the battle. After the battle in mid-May 1942, roughly 3,000 Red Army soldiers and Soviet civilians not evacuated by sea were besieged in a series of caves and tunnels in the nearby Adzhimushkay quarry. After holding out for approximately three months, \\"poison gas was released into the tunnels, killing all but a few score of the Soviet defenders.\\"Merridale, Catherine, Ivan's War, Faber & Faber: pp. 148-150. Thousands of those killed around Adzhimushkay were documented to have been killed by asphyxiation from gas. In February 1943, German troops stationed in Kuban received a telegram: \\"Russians should be eventually cleared out of the mountain range with gas.\\"Гречко, p. 468. The troops also received two wagons of toxin antidotes. Western Allies in case of a German invasion. Pictured is a chemical warfare bulk decontamination vehicle. The Western Allies did not use chemical weapons during the Second World War. The British planned to use mustard gas and phosgene to help repel a German invasion in 1940–1941, and had there been an invasion may have also deployed it against German cities. General Alan Brooke, Commander-in-Chief, Home Forces, in command of British anti-invasion preparations of the Second World War said that he \\"...had every intention of using sprayed mustard gas on the beaches\\" in an annotation in his diary.Alanbrooke, 2001. Entry July 22, 1940. The British manufactured mustard, chlorine, lewisite, phosgene and Paris Green and stored them at airfields and depots for use on the beaches. The mustard gas stockpile was enlarged in 1942–1943 for possible use by RAF Bomber Command against German cities, and in 1944 for possible retaliatory use if German forces used chemical weapons against the D-Day landings. Winston Churchill, the British Prime Minister, issued a memorandum advocating a chemical strike on German cities using poison gas and possibly anthrax. Although the idea was rejected, it has provoked debate.BBC2 Newsnight, 1/5/81; The Guardian, 7,9,13,20,30/5, 2/6/81; The Times, 11/5/81, 20/5/81, 15/6/81; The Listener, 25/6, 2/7, 17/8/81; Daily Telegraph, 18,21,25,29/5, 2,11/6/81; Encounter magazine, Vol.58-9 no.2; New Society, Vol.60; Bulletin of the Atomic Scientists, Vol.4 no.4 and 'Churchill's Anthrax Bombs - a debate', Vol.4 no.12, November 1987. In July 1944, fearing that rocket attacks on London would get even worse, and saying he would only use chemical weapons if it were \\"life or death for us\\" or would \\"shorten the war by a year\\", Churchill wrote a secret memorandum asking his military chiefs to \\"think very seriously over this question of using poison gas.\\" He stated \\"it is absurd to consider morality on this topic when everybody used it in the last war without a word of complaint...\\" The Joint Planning Staff, however, advised against the use of gas because it would inevitably provoke Germany to retaliate with gas. They argued that this would be to the Allies' disadvantage in France both for military reasons and because it might \\"seriously impair our relations with the civilian population when it became generally known that chemical warfare was first employed by us.\\"\\"Paxman and Harris\\", p132-35. In 1945, the U.S. Army's Chemical Warfare Service standardized improved chemical warfare rockets intended for the new M9 and M9A1 \\"Bazooka\\" launchers, adopting the M26 Gas Rocket, a cyanogen chloride (CK)-filled warhead for the 2.36-in rocket launcher.. CK, a deadly blood agent, was capable of penetrating the protective filter barriers in some gas masks,https://www.cdc.gov/niosh/ershdb/EmergencyResponseCard_29750039.html and was seen as an effective agent against Japanese forces (particularly those hiding in caves or bunkers), whose gas masks lacked the impregnants that would provide protection against the chemical reaction of CK.. While stockpiled in US inventory, the CK rocket was never deployed or issued to combat personnel. Accidental release On the night of December 2, 1943, German Ju 88 bombers attacked the port of Bari in Southern Italy, sinking several American ships—among them the , which was carrying mustard gas intended for use in retaliation by the Allies if German forces initiated gas warfare. The presence of the gas was highly classified, and authorities ashore had no knowledge of it, which increased the number of fatalities since physicians, who had no idea that they were dealing with the effects of mustard gas, prescribed treatment improper for those suffering from exposure and immersion. The whole affair was kept secret at the time and for many years after the war. According to the U.S. military account, \\"Sixty-nine deaths were attributed in whole or in part to the mustard gas, most of them American merchant seamen\\" out of 628 mustard gas military casualties. The large number of civilian casualties among the Italian population was not recorded. Part of the confusion and controversy derives from the fact that the German attack was highly destructive and lethal in itself, also apart from the accidental additional effects of the gas (the attack was nicknamed \\"The Little Pearl Harbor\\"), and attribution of the causes of death between the gas and other causes is far from easy. Rick Atkinson, in his book The Day of Battle, describes the intelligence that prompted Allied leaders to deploy mustard gas to Italy. This included Italian intelligence that Adolf Hitler had threatened to use gas against Italy if the state changed sides, and prisoner of war interrogations suggesting that preparations were being made to use a \\"new, egregiously potent gas\\" if the war turned decisively against Germany. Atkinson concludes, \\"No commander in 1943 could be cavalier about a manifest threat by Germany to use gas.\\" Post-World War II After World War II, the Allies recovered German artillery shells containing the three German nerve agents of the day (tabun, sarin, and soman), prompting further research into nerve agents by all of the former Allies. Although the threat of global thermonuclear war was foremost in the minds of most during the Cold War, both the Soviet and Western governments put enormous resources into developing chemical and biological weapons. Britain Porton Down was first established in 1916 and became the centre for the development of chemical weapons. In the late 1940s and early 1950s, British postwar chemical weapons research was based at the Porton Down facility. Research was aimed at providing Britain with the means to arm itself with a modern nerve-agent-based capability and to develop specific means of defense against these agents. Ranajit Ghosh, a chemist at the Plant Protection Laboratories of Imperial Chemical Industries was investigating a class of organophosphate compounds (organophosphate esters of substituted aminoethanethiols), for use as a pesticide. In 1954, ICI put one of them on the market under the trade name Amiton. It was subsequently withdrawn, as it was too toxic for safe use. The toxicity did not go unnoticed, and samples of it were sent to the research facility at Porton Down for evaluation. After the evaluation was complete, several members of this class of compounds were developed into a new group of much more lethal nerve agents, the V agents. The best-known of these is probably VX, assigned the UK Rainbow Code Purple Possum, with the Russian V-Agent coming a close second (Amiton is largely forgotten as VG). On the defensive side, there were years of difficult work to develop the means of prophylaxis, therapy, rapid detection and identification, decontamination and more effective protection of the body against nerve agents, capable of exerting effects through the skin, the eyes and respiratory tract. Tests were carried out on servicemen to determine the effects of nerve agents on human subjects, with one recorded death due to a nerve gas experiment. There have been persistent allegations of unethical human experimentation at Porton Down, such as those relating to the death of Leading Aircraftman Ronald Maddison, aged 20, in 1953. Maddison was taking part in sarin nerve agent toxicity tests. Sarin was dripped onto his arm and he died shortly afterwards. In the 1950s the Chemical Defence Experimental Establishment became involved with the development of CS, a riot control agent, and took an increasing role in trauma and wound ballistics work. Both these facets of Porton Down's work had become more important because of the situation in Northern Ireland. In the early 1950s, nerve agents such as sarin were produced— about 20 tons were made from 1954 until 1956. CDE Nancekuke was an important factory for stockpiling chemical weapons. Small amounts of VX were produced there, mainly for laboratory test purposes, but also to validate plant designs and optimise chemical processes for potential mass production. However, full-scale mass production of VX agent never took place, with the 1956 decision to end the UK's offensive chemical weapons programme. In the late 1950s, the chemical weapons production plant at Nancekuke was mothballed, but was maintained through the 1960s and 1970s in a state whereby production of chemical weapons could easily re-commence if required. United States In 1952, the U.S. Army patented a process for the \\"Preparation of Toxic Ricin\\", publishing a method of producing this powerful toxin. In 1958 the British government traded their VX technology with the United States in exchange for information on thermonuclear weapons. By 1961 the U.S. was producing large amounts of VX and performing its own nerve agent research. This research produced at least three more agents; the four agents (VE, VG, VM, VX) are collectively known as the \\"V-Series\\" class of nerve agents. Between 1951 and 1969, Dugway Proving Ground was the site of testing for various chemical and biological agents, including an open-air aerodynamic dissemination test in 1968 that accidentally killed, on neighboring farms, approximately 6,400 sheep by an unspecified nerve agent. From 1962 to 1973, the Department of Defense planned 134 tests under Project 112, a chemical and biological weapons \\"vulnerability-testing program.\\" In 2002, the Pentagon admitted for the first time that some of tests used real chemical and biological weapons, not just harmless simulants. Specifically under Project SHAD, 37 secret tests were conducted in California, Alaska, Florida, Hawaii, Maryland and Utah. Land tests in Alaska and Hawaii used artillery shells filled with sarin and VX, while Navy trials off the coasts of Florida, California and Hawaii tested the ability of ships and crew to perform under biological and chemical warfare, without the crew's knowledge. The code name for the sea tests was Project Shipboard Hazard and Defense—\\"SHAD\\" for short. In October 2002, the Senate Armed Forces Subcommittee on Personnel held hearings as the controversial news broke that chemical agents had been tested on thousands of American military personnel. The hearings were chaired by Senator Max Cleland, former VA administrator and Vietnam War veteran. ;United States chemical respiratory protection standardization In December 2001, the United States Department of Health and Human Services, Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health (NIOSH), and National Personal Protective Technology Laboratory (NPPTL), along with the U.S. Army Research, Development and Engineering Command (RDECOM), Edgewood Chemical and Biological Center (ECBC), and the U.S. Department of Commerce National Institute for Standards and Technology (NIST) published the first of six technical performance standards and test procedures designed to evaluate and certify respirators intended for use by civilian emergency responders to a chemical, biological, radiological, or nuclear weapon release, detonation, or terrorism incident. To date NIOSH/NPPTL has published six new respirator performance standards based on a tiered approach that relies on traditional industrial respirator certification policy, next- generation emergency response respirator performance requirements, and special live chemical warfare agent testing requirements of the classes of respirators identified to offer respiratory protection against chemical, biological, radiological, and nuclear (CBRN) agent inhalation hazards. These CBRN respirators are commonly known as open-circuit self-contained breathing apparatus (CBRN SCBA), air-purifying respirator (CBRN APR), air-purifying escape respirator (CBRN APER), self-contained escape respirator (CBRN SCER) and loose- or tight-fitting powered air-purifying respirators (CBRN PAPR). Soviet Union There were reports of chemical weapons being used during the Soviet–Afghan War, sometimes against civilians.The Story of Genocide in Afghanistan Hassan KakarReport from Afghanistan Claude Malhuret Due to the secrecy of the Soviet Union's government, very little information was available about the direction and progress of the Soviet chemical weapons until relatively recently. After the fall of the Soviet Union, Russian chemist Vil Mirzayanov published articles revealing illegal chemical weapons experimentation in Russia. In 1993, Mirzayanov was imprisoned and fired from his job at the State Research Institute of Organic Chemistry and Technology, where he had worked for 26 years. In March 1994, after a major campaign by U.S. scientists on his behalf, Mirzayanov was released.Yevgenia Albats and Catherine A. Fitzpatrick. The State Within a State: The KGB and Its Hold on Russia - Past, Present, and Future, 1994. (see pages 325–328) Among the information related by Vil Mirzayanov was the direction of Soviet research into the development of even more toxic nerve agents, which saw most of its success during the mid-1980s. Several highly toxic agents were developed during this period; the only unclassified information regarding these agents is that they are known in the open literature only as \\"Foliant\\" agents (named after the program under which they were developed) and by various code designations, such as A-230 and A-232. According to Mirzayanov, the Soviets also developed weapons that were safer to handle, leading to the development of binary weapons, in which precursors for the nerve agents are mixed in a munition to produce the agent just prior to its use. Because the precursors are generally significantly less hazardous than the agents themselves, this technique makes handling and transporting the munitions a great deal simpler. Additionally, precursors to the agents are usually much easier to stabilize than the agents themselves, so this technique also made it possible to increase the shelf life of the agents a great deal. During the 1980s and 1990s, binary versions of several Soviet agents were developed and designated \\"Novichok\\" agents (after the Russian word for \\"newcomer\\"). Together with Lev Fedorov, he told the secret Novichok story exposed in the newspaper The Moscow News. Use in conflicts after World War II North Yemen The International Red Cross hospital at Uqd, North Yemen, where the use of chemical weapons was alleged to have occurred The first attack of the North Yemen Civil War took place on June 8, 1963 against Kawma, a village of about 100 inhabitants in northern Yemen, killing about seven people and damaging the eyes and lungs of 25 others. This incident is considered to have been experimental, and the bombs were described as \\"home-made, amateurish and relatively ineffective\\". The Egyptian authorities suggested that the reported incidents were probably caused by napalm, not gas. There were no reports of gas during 1964, and only a few were reported in 1965. The reports grew more frequent in late 1966. On December 11, 1966, fifteen gas bombs killed two people and injured thirty-five. On January 5, 1967, the biggest gas attack came against the village of Kitaf, causing 270 casualties, including 140 fatalities. The target may have been Prince Hassan bin Yahya, who had installed his headquarters nearby. The Egyptian government denied using poison gas, and alleged that Britain and the US were using the reports as psychological warfare against Egypt. On February 12, 1967, it said it would welcome a UN investigation. On March 1, U Thant, the then Secretary-General of the United Nations, said he was \\"powerless\\" to deal with the matter. On May 10, 1967 the twin villages of Gahar and Gadafa in Wadi Hirran, where Prince Mohamed bin Mohsin was in command, were gas bombed, killing at least seventy- five. The Red Cross was alerted and on June 2, 1967, it issued a statement in Geneva expressing concern. The Institute of Forensic Medicine at the University of Berne made a statement, based on a Red Cross report, that the gas was likely to have been halogenous derivatives—phosgene, mustard gas, lewisite, chloride or cyanogen bromide. Rhodesian Bush War Evidence points to a top-secret Rhodesian program in the 1970s to use organophosphate pesticides and heavy metal rodenticides to contaminate clothing as well as food and beverages. The contaminated items were covertly introduced into insurgent supply chains. Hundreds of insurgent deaths were reported, although the actual death toll likely rose over 1,000. Vietnamese border raids in Thailand There is some evidence suggesting that Vietnamese troops used phosgene gas against Cambodian resistance forces in Thailand during the 1984-1985 dry-season offensive on the Thai-Cambodian border.\\"KPNLF says Vietnamese Using Suffocant Gas,\\" Bangkok World, January 4, 1985, p. 1.\\"Viets Accused of Using Gas Against Rebels,\\" Associated Press, February 19, 1985.\\"Thais Report a Clash with Vietnamese Troops,\\" Associated Press, February 20, 1985. Iran–Iraq War Victims of the 1987 chemical attack on Sardasht, West Azerbaijan, Iran Chemical weapons employed by Saddam Hussein killed and injured numerous Iranians and Iraqi Kurds. According to Iraqi documents, assistance in developing chemical weapons was obtained from firms in many countries, including the United States, West Germany, the Netherlands, the United Kingdom, and France. About 100,000 Iranian soldiers were victims of Iraq's chemical attacks. Many were hit by mustard gas. The official estimate does not include the civilian population contaminated in bordering towns or the children and relatives of veterans, many of whom have developed blood, lung and skin complications, according to the Organization for Veterans. Nerve gas agents killed about 20,000 Iranian soldiers immediately, according to official reports. Of the 80,000 survivors, some 5,000 seek medical treatment regularly and about 1,000 are still hospitalized with severe, chronic conditions. According to the Foreign Policy, the \\"Iraqis used mustard gas and sarin prior to four major offensives in early 1988 that relied on U.S. satellite imagery, maps, and other intelligence. ... According to recently declassified CIA documents and interviews with former intelligence officials like Francona, the U.S. had firm evidence of Iraqi chemical attacks beginning in 1983.\\" Halabja In March 1988, the Iraqi Kurdish town of Halabja was exposed to multiple chemical agents dropped from warplanes; these \\"may have included mustard gas, the nerve agents sarin, tabun and VX and possibly cyanide.\\"On this day: 1988: Thousands die in Halabja gas attack, BBC News (March 16, 1988). Between 3,200 and 5,000 people were killed, and between 7,000 and 10,000 were injured. Some reports indicated that three-quarters of them were women and children. The preponderance of the evidence indicates that Iraq was responsible for the attack. Persian Gulf War The U.S. Department of Defense and Central Intelligence Agency's longstanding official position is that Iraqi forces under Saddam Hussein did not use chemical weapons during the Persian Gulf War in 1991. In a memorandum in 1994 to veterans of the war, Defense Secretary William J. Perry and General John M. Shalikashvili, the chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, wrote that \\"There is no evidence, classified or unclassified, that indicates that chemical or biological weapons were used in the Persian Gulf.\\"Jonathan B. Tucker, Evidence Iraq Used Chemical Weapons During the 1991 Persian Gulf War, The Nonproliferation Review (Spring-Summer 1997), pp. 114-22. However, chemical weapons expert Jonathan B. Tucker, writing in the Nonproliferation Review in 1997, determined that although \\"[t]he absence of severe chemical injuries or fatalities among Coalition forces makes it clear that no large-scale Iraqi employment of chemical weapons occurred,\\" an array of \\"circumstantial evidence from a variety of sources suggests that Iraq deployed chemical weapons into the Kuwait Theater of Operations (KTO)—the area including Kuwait and Iraq south of the 31st Parallel, where the ground war was fought—and engaged in sporadic chemical warfare against Coalition forces.\\" In addition to intercepts of Iraqi military communications and publicly available reporting: Nerve agents (specifically, tabun, sarin, and cyclosarin) and blister agents (specifically, sulfur-mustard and lewisite) were detected at Iraqi sites. The threat itself of gas warfare had a major effect on Israel, which was not part of the coalition forces led by the US. Israel was attacked with 39 scud missiles, most of which were knocked down in the air above their targets by Patriot missiles developed by Raytheon together with Israel, and supplied by the US. Sirens warned of the attacks approximately 10 minutes before their expected arrival, and Israelis donned gas masks and entered sealed \\"safe\\" rooms, over a period 5 weeks. Babies were issued special gas-safe cribs, and religious men were issued gas masks that allowed them to preserve their beards.Israeli Responses to the Threat of Chemical Warfare, Prof. Gerald Steinberg, Published in Armed Forces and Society, Vol. 20., No. 1 Fall 1993, pp.85-101 (Faculty of Chemistry, Bar Ilan University website)The Gulf War, Netanel Lorch (published on the Israel ministry of foreign affairs website)The distribution of special gas masks for bearded men in footnote 19 about Prof. Yosseph Shilhav's research. Sticking Together page 139, Yakov Kop and Robert E. Litan (Google Books) In 2014, tapes from Saddam Hussain's archives revealed that Saddam had given orders to use gas against Israel as a last resort if his military communications with the army were cut off.Saddam gave orders to fire chemical weapons at Tel-Aviv if he was toppled in first gulf war January 25, 2014 (Times of Israel website) In 2015 The New York Times published an article about the declassified report of operation Avarice in 2005 in which over 400 chemical weapons including many rockets and missiles from the Iran-Iraq war period were recovered and subsequently destroyed by the CIA. Many other stockpiles, estimated by UNSCOM up to 600 metric tons of chemical weapons, were known to have existed and even admitted by Saddam's regime, but claimed by them to have been destroyed. These have never been found but are believed to still exist.The chief U.N. weapons inspector said on Monday that Iraq could not account for stocks of anthrax and a deadly nerve gas that it said it had destroyed January 27, 2003, CnnDeadly arsenals Joseph Cirincione et al. Page 343 quoting UNSCOM reports. (Google Books) Angola During the Cuban intervention in Angola, United Nations toxicologists certified that residue from both VX and sarin nerve agents had been discovered in plants, water, and soil where Cuban units were conducting operations against National Union for the Total Independence of Angola (UNITA) insurgents. In 1985, UNITA made the first of several claims that their forces were the target of chemical weapons, specifically organophosphates. The following year guerrillas reported being bombarded with an unidentified greenish-yellow agent on three separate occasions. Depending on the length and intensity of exposure, victims suffered blindness or death. The toxin was also observed to have killed plant life. Shortly afterwards, UNITA also sighted strikes carried out with a brown agent which it claimed resembled mustard gas.Helen E. Purkitt, Stephen F. Burgess: The Rollback of South Africa's Chemical and Biological Warfare Program, Air University, Counterproliferation Center, Maxwell Airforce Base, Alabama, 2001 As early as 1984 a research team dispatched by the University of Ghent had examined patients in UNITA field hospitals showing signs of exposure to nerve agents, although it found no evidence of mustard gas. The UN first accused Cuba of deploying chemical weapons against Angolan civilians and partisans in 1988. Wouter Basson later disclosed that South African military intelligence had long verified the use of unidentified chemical weapons on Angolan soil; this was to provide the impetus for their own biological warfare programme, Project Coast. During the Battle of Cuito Cuanavale, South African troops then fighting in Angola were issued with gas masks and ordered to rehearse chemical weapons drills. Although the status of its own chemical weapons program remained uncertain, South Africa also deceptively bombarded Cuban and Angolan units with colored smoke in an attempt to induce hysteria or mass panic. According to Defence Minister Magnus Malan, this would force the Cubans to share the inconvenience of having to take preventative measures such as donning NBC suits, which would cut combat effectiveness in half. The tactic was effective: beginning in early 1988 Cuban units posted to Angola were issued with full protective gear in anticipation of a South African chemical strike. On October 29, 1988, personnel attached to Angola's 59 Brigade, accompanied by six Soviet military advisors, reported being struck with chemical weapons on the banks of the Mianei River. The attack occurred shortly after one in the afternoon. Four Angolan soldiers lost consciousness while the others complained of violent headaches and nausea. That November the Angolan representative to the UN accused South Africa of employing poison gas near Cuito Cuanavale for the first time. Falklands War Technically, the reported employment of tear gas by Argentine forces during the 1982 invasion of the Falkland Islands constitutes chemical warfare.The Argentine Fight for The Falklands, Lieutenant-Commander Sanchez-Sabarots However, the tear gas grenades were employed as nonlethal weapons to avoid British casualties. The barrack buildings the weapons were used on proved to be deserted in any case. The British claim that more lethal, but legally justifiable as they are not considered chemical weapons under the Chemical Weapons Convention, white phosphorus grenades were used.Falkland Islanders at war, Bound, Graham, Pen and Sword Books Limited, . Syrian Civil War Some of the victims of the Ghouta, Syria attack, August 21, 2013 Sarin, mustard agent and chlorine gas have been used during the conflict. Numerous casualties led to an international reaction, especially the 2013 Ghouta attacks. A UN fact-finding mission was requested to investigate alleged chemical weapons attacks. In four cases the UN inspectors confirmed use of sarin gas. In August 2016, a confidential report by the United Nations and the OPCW explicitly blamed the Syrian military of Bashar al-Assad for dropping chemical weapons (chlorine bombs) on the towns of Talmenes in April 2014 and Sarmin in March 2015 and ISIS for using sulfur mustard on the town of Marea in August 2015.Syria Used Chlorine in Bombs Against Civilians, Report Says, The New York Times, Rick Gladstone, August 24, 2016 retrieved August 25, 2016. In 2016, Jaysh al-Islam rebel group had used chlorine gas or other agents against Kurdish militia and civilians in the Sheikh Maqsood neighborhood of Aleppo. Many countries, including the United States and the European Union have accused the Syrian government of conducting several chemical attacks. Following the 2013 Ghouta attacks and international pressure, Syria acceded to the Chemical Weapons Convention and the destruction of Syria's chemical weapons began. In 2015 the UN mission disclosed previously undeclared traces of sarin compounds in a \\"military research site\\". After the April 2017 Khan Shaykhun chemical attack, the United States launched its first attack against Syrian government forces. On 14 April 2018, the United States, France and the United Kingdom carried out a series of joint military strikes against multiple government sites in Syria, including the Barzah scientific research centre, after a chemical attack in Douma. Terrorism and anti-terrorism For many terrorist organizations, chemical weapons might be considered an ideal choice for a mode of attack, if they are available: they are cheap, relatively accessible, and easy to transport. A skilled chemist can readily synthesize most chemical agents if the precursors are available. In July 1974, a group calling themselves the Aliens of America successfully firebombed the houses of a judge, two police commissioners, and one of the commissioner's cars, burned down two apartment buildings, and bombed the Pan Am Terminal at Los Angeles International Airport, killing three people and injuring eight. The organization, which turned out to be a single resident alien named Muharem Kurbegovic, claimed to have developed and possessed a supply of sarin, as well as four unique nerve agents named AA1, AA2, AA3, and AA4S. Although no agents were found at the time Kurbegovic was arrested in August 1974, he had reportedly acquired \\"all but one\\" of the ingredients required to produce a nerve agent. A search of his apartment turned up a variety of materials, including precursors for phosgene and a drum containing 25 pounds of sodium cyanide. U.S. Navy Seabees don their M40 Field Protective Mask The first successful use of chemical agents by terrorists against a general civilian population was on June 27, 1994, when Aum Shinrikyo, an apocalyptic group based in Japan that believed it necessary to destroy the planet, released sarin gas in Matsumoto, Japan, killing eight and harming 200. The following year, Aum Shinrikyo released sarin into the Tokyo subway system killing 12 and injuring over 5,000. On December 29, 1999, four days after Russian forces began an assault of Grozny, Chechen terrorists exploded two chlorine tanks in the town. Because of the wind conditions, no Russian soldiers were injured.Ксения Мяло. Россия и последние войны XX века: к истории падения сверхдержавы. Глава 5: Чеченский узел. М.: Вече, 2002 Following the September 11, 2001 attacks on the U.S. cities of New York City and Washington, D.C., the organization Al-Qaeda responsible for the attacks announced that they were attempting to acquire radiological, biological, and chemical weapons. This threat was lent a great deal of credibility when a large archive of videotapes was obtained by the cable television network CNN in August 2002 showing, among other things, the killing of three dogs by an apparent nerve agent. In an anti-terrorist attack on October 26, 2002, Russian special forces used a chemical agent (presumably KOLOKOL-1, an aerosolized fentanyl derivative), as a precursor to an assault on Chechen terrorists, which ended the Moscow theater hostage crisis. All 42 of the terrorists and 120 out of 850 hostages were killed during the raid. Although the use of the chemical agent was justified as a means of selectively targeting terrorists, it killed over 100 hostages. In early 2007, multiple terrorist bombings had been reported in Iraq using chlorine gas. These attacks wounded or sickened more than 350 people. Reportedly the bombers were affiliated with Al-Qaeda in Iraq, and they have used bombs of various sizes up to chlorine tanker trucks. United Nations Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon condemned the attacks as \\"clearly intended to cause panic and instability in the country.\\" Chemical weapons treaties The Protocol for the Prohibition of the Use in War of Asphyxiating, Poisonous or other Gases, and the Bacteriological Methods of Warfare, or the Geneva Protocol, is an international treaty which prohibits the use of chemical and biological weapons in warfare. Signed into international Law at Geneva on June 17, 1925 and entered into force on February 8, 1928, this treaty states that chemical and biological weapons are \\"justly condemned by the general opinion of the civilised world.\\" Chemical Weapons Convention States parties to the Chemical Weapons Convention in 2015. Light colored territories are those states parties that have declared stockpiles of chemical weapons and/or have known production facilities for chemical weapons. The most recent arms control agreement in International Law, the Convention of the Prohibition of the Development, Production, Stockpiling and Use of Chemical Weapons and on their Destruction, or the Chemical Weapons Convention, outlaws the production, stockpiling, and use of chemical weapons. It is administered by the Organisation for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons (OPCW), an intergovernmental organisation based in The Hague. References Bibliography * CBWInfo.com (2001).

It was proposed by the French government who were concerned about aircraft from foreign nations flying over their territory and was attended by representatives from 19 European nations. The key question considered by the conference was whether nations had the right to prevent foreign aircraft overflying their territory. Opinion was divided between those nations that wished a wide freedom of movement for aircraft and those that, for reasons of national security, wished to control which aircraft crossed into their country. The conference went into recess in June 1910 but did not reconvene due to differences of opinion and then later the outbreak of the First World War. Hence, no agreement was signed. Its deliberations, however, influenced the development of international aviation law. Background In 1908, France became concerned about the regulation of aviation after at least 10 German balloons crossed into French territory carrying more than 25 aviators of whom the majority were German officers. The following year, French Minister of the Interior, Georges Clemenceau, issued an order for local authorities to hold any balloons that came their way, detain them to collect customs duties, and to make enquiries as to the purpose of their flight. Although there had been rulings in domestic courts relating to trespassing balloons, and the dropping of munitions from balloons had been previously included in the International Peace Conference of 1899, at the time of the conference in 1910 there was no international law in place about aviation and flights were largely unregulated. In the previous year, Louis Blériot used an aircraft to fly across the English Channel from France to England, without any thought of the legal or diplomatic consequences. During this time, Germany was testing its early Zeppelins and flying them over Switzerland without any permission from the Swiss. Subsequently, French concerns about control of their airspace led them to call for the 1910 conference to develop international regulations covering aviation. At the same time, they aimed to consider the fundamental question of who had the right to fly over a nation's territory. Attendees In attendance were representatives of 19 European nations; Austria-Hungary, Belgium, Bulgaria, Denmark, France, Germany, Great Britain, Italy, Luxemburg, Monaco, Netherlands, Portugal, Romania, Russia, Serbia, Spain, Sweden, Switzerland, and Turkey. More distant countries such as the United States were deemed unable to fly as far as Europe, and so not invited to participate. A questionnaire was sent to each representative prior to the conference in order to establish their preliminary views, however, it avoided the topic of air sovereignty. This question was later added to the conference programme in the same layout as stated in the German preliminary response. The Conference The conference was the first political effort to develop the doctrines of international law relating to aerial navigation. Delegates disagreed about the right of foreign aircraft to fly over national territory. Germany and France supported the idea of wide freedom and national treatment of foreign aircraft. This view was opposed by Britain, Austria-Hungary and Russia, who backed the view there should be complete sovereign right to the overlying airspace for national security reasons. France The French delegation was led by Louis Renault, who was also the president of the conference. Along with Germany, France supported the idea of wide freedom and national treatment of foreign aircraft. However, the French Government held the opinion of Paul Fauchille who stated that \\"Air navigation is free. Nevertheless subjacent States reserve rights necessary to their self-preservation; that is, to their own security and that of the persons and goods of their inhabitants.\\" Germany Germany had consulted Ferdinand von Zeppelin prior to accepting the invitation, and completed a thorough preliminary document before the conference commenced. They were clear that freedom of airspace was their proposal. United Kingdom The British held the view that there should be complete sovereign right to the overlying airspace for national security reasons. They did not uphold the opinions of British professor of international law John Westlake, who although held the same view to some extent, also advocated the right of innocent passage. Italy The Italian delegates endorsed prohibited zones on a military basis. Russia Russia endorsed free landing, but the need for prohibited zones. It requested that further discussions take place on the question of the rights of a sovereign State in the airspace above its territory. Belgium Clarification as to the rights to the airspace above their lands and waters was requested by Belgium. Agreement By the time the conference adjourned, delegates had agreed the terms of a draft agreement covering: *Nationality, registration and certificates for aircraft *Licenses and logbooks for crew *Rules of the road *Transport of explosives *Aircraft equipment *Provisions for public aircraft A declaration of prohibited zones was also agreed. There was general agreement that airspace above individual states was under the control of that state and therefore that states may designate airspace zones where international flights would be prohibited.Sand, Peter H. & Jorge de Sousa Freitas & Geoffrey N. Pratt, \\"An Historical Survey Of International Air Law Before The Second World War\\". McGill Law Journal, Vol. 7, No. 1, pp. 29–42 (pp. 29–30). It was the question of what restrictions and to what extent these restrictions could be applied that was not largely agreed. Conclusion and legacy The conference went into recess on 29 June 1910 and was planned to reconvene on 29 November 1910, however, due to political differences and, later, the outbreak of the First World War, it never did. The conference therefore ended without a signed agreement. Despite the absence of a final agreement, an examination of the conference drafts and debates shows that it was decided, in principle, that individual nations had the right to authorise or deny flight over their territory. The conference also identified a number of issues that became significant in future aviation regulations. The Aerial Navigation Act 1911, passed by the British Parliament, gave Britain authority to close British airspace to all foreign aircraft and the conference's codes resurfaced in the Paris Convention of 1919. It also influenced the Chicago Convention on International Civil Aviation of 1944.

It was filmed in Adelaide, South Australia, in early 2019, both on location in the city and suburbs and in the Glenside studios of the South Australian Film Corporation. Plot Based on a book by one of the escapees, Jenkin, Inside Out: Escape from Pretoria Prison, the film tells the true-life story of political prisoners Tim Jenkin (played by Radcliffe) and Stephen Lee (played by Webber), two white South Africans who, along with other prisoners, hatched a plot to break out of Pretoria Central Prison in 1979 after being imprisoned on charges of \\"producing and distributing 18 different pamphlets on behalf of banned organisations\\" (including the ANC) during the apartheid era in South Africa. Some of the other political prisoners, including Denis Goldberg, helped to create and refine the details of the planned escape. Cast *Daniel Radcliffe as Tim Jenkin *Daniel Webber as Stephen Lee *Ian Hart as Denis Goldberg *Mark Leonard Winter as Leonard Fontaine *Nathan Page as Mongo *Grant Piro as Captain Schnepel *Adam Ovadia as Van Zadelhoff *Adam Tuominen as Jeremy Cronin *Tim Jenkin as a prisoner in the prison waiting room (extra, non-speaking role) Production The film was written and directed by Francis Annan. The film is an Australia-UK co-production, co-financed by Arclight Films, New York-based Magna Entertainment and with the assistance of the South Australian Film Corporation. Sam Neill was originally cast as Goldberg, in May 2017. Filming commenced on location in Adelaide, South Australia, in March 2019, with some scenes being shot at Mitcham railway station and others in the centre of the city, in Pirie Street. Jenkin spent some time in Adelaide, advising Radcliffe on accent and other aspects of the film, as well as playing as an extra, playing a prisoner next to Radcliffe in the visiting room. The film contains two pieces of music by the Austrian composer Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart: The Dies Irae from his Requiem Mass in D minor and the Kyrie from his Mass in C minor. Release Escape from Pretoria was released on 6 March 2020 in the United Kingdom by Signature Entertainment and in the United States by eOne and Momentum Pictures. It was released for rental on digital platforms iTunes, Sky Store, Amazon Prime Video and Virgin on the same date, and had a limited cinema release in the UK, US and some other countries. It became available to buy on DVD and Blu-ray from 20 April 2020. The film was screened on 11 July 2020 at select cinemas in Adelaide as part of Adelaide Film Festival, after cinemas had just reopened in the wake of the COVID-19 pandemic in Australia. Reception On the review aggregator website Rotten Tomatoes, the film holds an approval rating of 71% based on 38 reviews, with an average rating of 6.4/10. The website's critics consensus reads: \\"Escape from Pretoria doesn't quite do justice to the fact-based story it's dramatizing, but that lack of depth is offset by suitably gripping jailbreak action.\\" On Metacritic, the film has a weighted average score of 56 out of 100, based on 7 critics, indicating \\"mixed or average reviews\\".

The metal bridge is a pedestrian walkway of nearly 300 meters, built in 1923, to shorten the walk for workers reaching factories on both sides of the river. The construction was patronized by Vicenzo Douglas Scotti, then Count San Giorgino della Scala. The bridge is suspended by four cables and passes over 30 meters above the river. Until 1990, it held the record as the longest such bridge in the world, till it was overtaken by the Kokonoe Yume Bridge in Kokonoe, Ōita, Japan.Il Borgo dei Celti, agritourism website.

The short was selected by more than a hundred festivals internationally and won more than thirty awards, and was selected for two anthology films in the US: Seven Hells (2014), and All Hallows' Eve 2 (2015). Plot On Hallowe'en night, in a West Village townhouse, babysitter Elizabeth carves a Jack O'Lantern out of a pumpkin with the help of Jack, the boy she is looking after, his terrier Oscar barking and watching excitedly. She is vexed because her boyfriend Elliott is running late. The job done, she puts the seeds on a tray and cooks them in the oven. After, all three of them eat a few seeds, when Jack begins to choke. Elizabeth tries to perform the Heimlich maneuver but fails and the boy passes out. Not knowing what else to do, she takes a knife and attempts to perform a tracheotomy so he can breathe. Blood spurts when she cuts a hole in his neck, and she notices something that may be the seed and attempts to dig it out with the knife; it turns out to be a long vine. Jack's abdomen swells underneath his shirt and explodes. Horrified, Elizabeth notices her own belly beginning to swell. Using the knife, she cuts across it in the manner of a Caesarean section, and pumpkins and thick vines explode from her body, and her head slumps down. Oscar whines. Outside, Elliott finally arrives and enters the townhouse. He is heard calling for her briefly, and vines are seen creeping quickly within across the windows. Cast *Helen Rogers as Elizabeth *Tyler Rossell as Jack *Brazen (dog) as Oscar *Steven Anderson Jr. as Elliott Production Background and inspiration Bryan Norton had been Antonio Padovan's directing teacher at the New York Film Academy, where Padovan directed his first two short films, Socks and Cakes and his student thesis, Perry St.. Norton was now the Academy's Chairperson. They decided to use Norton's access to equipment and crew to their advantage. Padovan said: \\"We've always talked about making a movie based in the West Village in fall ... Because it photographs very well\\". After toying with a few unfeasible ideas, Norton jokingly said: \\"We could even make a movie just about a pumpkin ... And we came up with this idea.\\" Writing and casting Norton and Padovan were admirers of Helen Rogers' work in V/H/S; the segment \\"The Sick Thing\\" led them to reconceive Jack Attack's lead role. Originally, the central characters were imagined as a mother and son, with the former part to be cast with an age-appropriate genre favorite, as Norton explained: > It was going to be written for someone I grew up with as a horror fan ... > Kristy Swanson, Angela Bettis, Catherine Mary Stewart, who's an old friend; > we looked at so many people. Then we saw V/H/S and were like, \\"Let's write > it for a babysitter.\\" Filming Jack Attack was filmed on location in the West Village and on a soundstage at Rollin Studios in Brooklyn. Release Jack Attack premiered at the Fantasia International Film Festival, where it was paired with The Conjuring on opening night (18 July 2013). It was selected by more than a hundred festivals internationally, including Milan, Sitges, Fantafestival, Melbourne, Fantastic Fest, and the New York City Horror Film Festival. At the Calgary Underground Film Festival, the short was paired with Drew Bolduc's Science Team (2014). In Los Angeles, the film was shown at Mann's Chinese Theatre. Anthology films The short has since achieved a wider release as part of two anthology films in the US: Seven Hells (Gateway Films, Best of Fest, and Hands Off Productions), made up of seven award-winning horror and dark comedy shorts, was released in theaters \\"just in time for Halloween\\", in October 2014. All Hallows’ Eve 2, nominally a sequel to All Hallows' Eve, is also a standalone film from Ruthless Pictures containing nine story segments. Jack Attack is the first segment. Home media and streaming The film is available in its entirety on Vimeo. All Hallows' Eve 2 was released in VOD and digital formats on October 6, 2015, and had a DVD release on February 2, 2016. A DVD featuring both All Hallows' Eve and the \\"sequel\\" as a \\"Halloween double feature\\" was released on September 13, 2016. Reception Critical response Thomas M. Sipos said Jack Attack is a \\"one-note film\\", but it deserved its award at Shriekfest, appreciating \\"Gordon Yu's beautiful, golden- hued cinematography\\". Richard Whittaker of the Austin Chronicle called Jack Attack \\"ghoulishly entertaining\\", while Jo Satana called it \\"punchy and strangely whimsical\\". A Canadian reviewer agreed, noting the \\"genuinely sweet interactions between Elizabeth and Jack, with both actors giving good, believable performances\\" which are \\"almost heartwarming\\", elements which are daring and \\"quite effective\\" in a horror film: > There are times when Jack Attack goes into some pretty gruesome and even > frightening places, but it's not done in a mean-spirited fashion. In fact, > Jack Attack blends a tasty mix of horror and fun, which is really the > perfect recipe for capturing the spirit of Halloween. ... Jack Attack > features an impressively high level of production value, which is matched by > great sound design and gruesomely satisfying special effects. A Screen Anarchy reviewer suggested the film was \\"the perfect morsel to whet the appetite of a festival audience before a feature presentation\\", saying the directors \\"employ a slow burn\\", the small cast forming a \\"nuanced trio in order to twist the knife a bit further\\". Selected accolades Jack Attack is said to have won more than thirty awards or honors, including but not limited to the following: ;Awards *Fantasia, 2013 • Audience Award for Best Short (Bronze) *Shriekfest, 2013 • Best Super Short Film * (Audincourt, 2013) • Best Special Effects *New Orleans Horror Film Festival (New Orleans, 2013) • Best Short Film *Terror Film Festival (online) 2013 • Best Horror Short Film ;Special mention *Fantafestival • Honorable mention (Bryan Norton, Antonio Padovan, Joseph Zaso) ;Nominations *Sitges Film Festival, 2013 • Maria Best Short Film *Milan International Film Festival • Best International Short Film *Terror Film Festival, 2013 • Best Director of Photography • Best Editing • Best Special Effects Related works In 2014, Norton said he was writing a feature-length film that would incorporate Jack Attack as a subplot, \\"but basically will be Greenwich Village in New York City on one crazy Halloween night.\\" References External links *Official online release on Vimeo *Jack Attack on IMDb Category:2013 films Category:American films Category:American short films Category:American drama films Category:American horror films Category:Halloween horror films Category:Horror short films ","title":"Jack Attack (film)"},{"id":"60215848","text":"Hongzhuang (Chinese: 红庄) is a station of Line 4, Suzhou Rail Transit.

Dafa translates to Daihatsu in Chinese which means that it is a rebadged Daihatsu model.  Overview  A Huali Dafa TJ 6350B The Huali Dafa is well known for its low cost and reliability. It is highly identifiable by its slightly curved \\"snub\\" shape. For this reason it is commonly nicknamed the \\"bread car\\" . Production of the Huali Dafa was discontinued some time ago, but hundreds of thousands remain on the roads of China. By far, its most common color is maroon, followed by silver. The Huali Dafa was used as a taxicab in the 1980s until it was replaced by Xiali and Volkswagen cars in the 1990s. The first Dafas looked very similar to the 1981 Daihatsu Hijet, but two major facelifts left late versions looking quite different, with body colored bumpers and grille accompanying a slightly elongated nose. Originally, the Dafa's internal code was TJ110 (1984-1989). After 1989 model codes switched to TJ6320 and TJ6350 for minivans, while trucks were called TJ 1010SL, TJ 1010A, and TJ 1013F. These were built alongside the facelifted TJ6330 and TJ 1010FL/FLA (introduced in 1998 for the 1999 model year) until production of all versions ended in 2002. Huali produced two rebadged versions of the first- generation Daihatsu Terios known as the Huali Dario and the first-generation Daihatsu Move known as the Huali TJ5015XFY or Happy Messenger sold from 2003 to 2008. The Huali TJ5015XFY forms the basis for an electrical version, sold in the United States as the Miles ZX40.

Exhibits   Bowden Spacelanders  Four of the last Bowden Spacelanders Benjamin Bowden, a British industrial designer, designed a space- age fiberglass bicycle in 1946. Bowden named the design the Spacelander; it entered production in 1960 and sold for $89.50. Only 522 Spacelander bicycles were made in the original run. By the 1990s only a few dozen were estimated to have survived. Morrow collected 17 of the proposed 38 left in the world. The Bowden Spacelanders are some rarest bicycles in the museum. Given their scarcity and good condition, they are valued over $50,000 each.

While in high school, Giannulli began a social media career on YouTube and Instagram; as of 2019, both accounts have amassed more than one million followers. Giannulli's fraudulent acceptance to the University of Southern California was a prominent part of the 2019 college admissions bribery scandal. Early life and education Giannulli is the daughter of actress Lori Loughlin and fashion designer Mossimo Giannulli. Giannulli has an older sister, Isabella, and a half-brother, Gianni. In 2017, Giannulli crashed her car while singing along to Stevie Wonder's \\"Signed, Sealed, Delivered I'm Yours\\" as she filmed herself with her mobile phone, prompting expressions of concern about her driving habits among her social media followers. In 2018, Giannulli graduated from Marymount High School in Los Angeles, California and enrolled at the University of Southern California. As of October 2019, both Giannulli sisters are no longer enrolled at USC. 2019 college admissions bribery scandal In 2018, according to an indictment by the United States Government, Giannulli posed for a photo on an ergometer rowing machine. The photo was later submitted as part of her application to the University of Southern California (USC) with the implication she was a competitive rower, though she was not and had no interest in becoming one. At the same time, it is alleged, her parents paid $500,000 in bribes to a coach at the university to designate her and her older sister Isabella as athletic prospects for the team, enabling them to gain admission to the school. According to the federal criminal complaint against her father, Olivia Jade was confused about how to complete the USC application, and an employee of the alleged conspiracy's ringleader ultimately had to fill it out on her behalf. Teen Vogue has reported that \\"it is undetermined if Olivia Jade knew about the alleged scheme\\". Before starting classes at USC, Giannulli prompted criticism when she posted a statement to her YouTube channel in which she said, referring to her upcoming attendance at USC, \\"... I do want the experience of like game days, partying ... I don't really care about school, as you guys all know.\\" According to Newsweek, Giannulli had been actively giving advice on applying to university to her social-media followers days before federal agents arrested her parents on fraud charges for their alleged involvement in the conspiracy. On March 13, 2019, media sources reported that when news of the scandal broke, Giannulli was in the Bahamas on Rick Caruso's $100 million yacht.Invictus at Super Yacht Fan.com Giannulli is friends with Caruso's daughter Gianna, and Caruso is the chairman of the USC Board of Trustees. Repercussions On March 14, 2019, two days after the scandal broke, Sephora distanced itself from Giannulli, announcing that the company would be ending its makeup partnership with her. TRESemmé also dropped her as a sales partner. Some media outlets had reported that Giannulli dropped out of USC due to fears of being \\"viciously bullied\\"; however, a university spokesperson later confirmed that Giannulli remained enrolled at the school. Giannulli was also subjected to public shaming and generalized ridicule through social and traditional media after allegations of the scandal surfaced. Giannulli's social media platforms were inundated with critical comments and she ultimately disabled the comment features on her Instagram account. Slate writer Heather Schwedel said that Giannulli checked \\"all the right boxes for ridicule\\", while comedian John Oliver, speaking on Last Week Tonight with John Oliver, opined that \\"death threats\\" were inappropriate but a limited period of joke-making at Giannulli's expense would be socially acceptable. On December 2, 2019, Giannulli broke her silence on the scandal in a video posted to her YouTube account titled \\"Hi Again.\\" However, she did not address the scandal directly, saying in the video that she had been legally barred from doing so. USC scheduled a hearing in March 2019 to determine if Giannulli should be identified as a \\"disruptive individual\\", which could result in a lifetime ban from the university. In October 2019, the USC Registrar confirmed that Olivia and her sister were no longer enrolled at the university, but due to student privacy laws, the university did not confirm if the sisters were expelled. Career While in high school, Giannulli started a lifestyle YouTube channel. She then started an Instagram account. Each account has over a million subscribers/followers and were monetized through commercial endorsements and advertisements for Amazon, Sephora, and other companies. Giannulli appeared in a 2016 episode of the game show Tap that Awesome App, competing for a prize for charity. In 2018, Giannulli trademarked \\"Olivia Jade\\" and \\"Olivia Jade Beauty\\". Her applications had at first not been processed by the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office due, in part, to what media outlets described as \\"poor punctuation\\".

It was founded by Ashok Row Kavi in the year 1990. It is one of India's leading gay magazines supporting gay people, to address issues faced by transgender community. The aim of the magazine was to mobilize the gay community and articulate the rights of gay people. From 1994,’ Humsafar Trust' a non-profit organization started to publish the newsletter. The periodicals were shut down in the year 2002 and started to republish in 2009.  History and Development  Bombay Dost highlights the issues of sexuality and HIV/AIDS. Initially, it publishes articles focusing on gay men and MSM (men-having-sex-with-men) community to navigate the problems faced by gay people in society. Bombay dost is an important milestone in the history of the queer gay movement in India. Ashok Row Kavi and Suhail Abbasi, were the two gay men who brought out the first issue of the newsletter. The first issue was a 16 pages article which was a form of an instruction manual for the gay men informing them about how to manage their lives, how to live safely, how to gain confidence and how to lead their lives. Due to funding and logistical problems the magazine was suspended in the year 2002. The editors did not intend to close down the magazine but the financial problems did not let the magazine exist more. When it relaunched in the year 2009 the laws of India were much more hospitable and generous to the gay community.  Founder: Ashok Row Kavi  Ashok Row Kavi (born 1947) is an activist and journalist in India. He began his career as a journalist in the year 1974 and retired as a journalist in the year 1990. Then as an activist for LGBTQ community in society, Ashok founded a gay magazine Bombay Dost featuring the issues of the transgender community. He was the first person to talk about homosexuality publicly. He is the founder-chairperson of Humsafar Trust and fighting for the gay rights in society to build respect for LGBTQ community in minds of people. His dream was to remove the cloth of invisibility that surrounded the LGBTQ community. Row Kavi received Shivananda Khan HERO Award in November 2017 for improving the lives of transgender people and all those people affected by HIV across the country.  Publications and content  The major competition at the time of its relaunch was widespread communication through the use of the digital platform. It is mostly available in form of hard copy only due to the belief that there are thousands of people who do not have access to digital media which deprives them of knowledge if available online only. Until it shut down, the magazine was available in two languages Hindi and English but after its relaunch it was restricted to the English language. It was originally distributed as an annually or bi-annually magazine. Until 2002, the newsletter was originally available through roadside vendors wrapped in brown paper. But after its relaunch the magazine was also available in various bookstores as to cover a larger group of people. Apart from Indian people, Row Kavi has also received letters from people of Tajikistan, Afghanistan, Dubai and Iran. In earlier years of the magazine, editors received around 3,000 letters weekly through 'Khush Khat' or 'Happy letters’ a platform where readers exchange their correspondence. There were also demand of magazine from various Asian countries like Pakistan, Central Asian Republic and some more.  Publisher: Humsafar Trust  The Humsafar Trust has its origin from the magazine Bombay Dost. It was set by the editors of the magazine in the year 1990 as a non- profit organization. It is India's oldest gay organization working with the Government of India. Ashok Row Kavi is the Chairperson and Vivek Anand is the CEO along with Suhail Abbasi and Sridhar Rangayan as the co-founder of the organization. Started just as a Bombay-based organization, Humsafar Trust today works in around 29 cities and promotes different community initiatives in the country. The major objective of it is to provide health care and support services, to work towards the sexual gender issues and human rights of the LGBTQ community. It offered face-to-face counselling services to the community to know the root causes of such stereotypes.  Issues covered  Bombay Dost had covered various mainstream issues to strengthen the rights of the LGBTQ community. During the starting phase of magazine, it consists of all the major issues of world mainly focusing the local news because of the absence of digital platform in those days. There were many columns like Papa Passion (about health issues), Khush Khat and Pushtak (views of people about the issues) and entertainment section. The 1991 issues highlight an account of disturbance in the Asian Lesbian Conference, 1991 held in Bangkok where Lesbians from every part of the world participated. Highlights were also about Indian-American woman Urvashi Vaid selected to lead National Gay and Lesbian Task Force (NGLTF) In 1995 the magazine highlighted the bromance of actors Akshay Kumar and Saif Ali Khan in their movie Main Khiladi Tu Anari. The 1996 magazine had an introduction about Poison Pudi, a self-styled diva and story about Bombay guys who discovered that they are gay after their marriage as they got to know about their attraction towards men. The edition of 1991 focuses on the introduction of the Internet and its impact on the magazine with articles on the gay movement of India. The 2002 issue had an eight-page article describing the police raid on Naz Foundation in the year 2001 and about the petition filed by the Naz foundation against Section 377. The magazine also raised many current issues and problems faced by the transgender community. After the revival of Bombay Dost on 16 April 2009, the new imprint on the cover page was focusing on being Bolder than ever. The magazine highlighted the conflicts focused on religion and sexuality with talks of Ghalib Shiraz Dhalla, Syed Ali Arif and Gwyneth Mawlong on the issue. It was in total 56 pages which dealt with and features all the gay issues both in India and abroad.  Events  In the year 2015, Bombay Dost and Humsafar Trust initiated a project named 'LIKHO'. The objective of the project was to inspire and train the aspiring new generation of LGBTQ community to put forth their views on issues related to homosexuality and medical problems like HIV. Eventually, after the project, Bombay Dost and Humsafar Trust organized 'Likho' awards in association with Blued, world largest social networking gay app. The motive is to recognize and encourage the people for their contribution in writing and media on issues concerning homosexuality and the transgender community. It was conducted first in the year 2016 and after that every year it is being conducted by the organization.  Works  After its relaunch, things have changed from that it was before. Just before shut down of the magazine Naz Foundation, a non-profit organization appealed Delhi High Court against Section 377 of Indian Penal Code. People then eventually started to support gay relationship. It was not that entire population was in favor but things were on much more positive high than before. Post its relaunch people were willing to pick the magazine, put it into their studios, stores and libraries showering their support towards the community. According to Row Kavi one of the aims of Bombay Dost after its 25th issue was to trains interns or deserving youth in journalism. The matter also became more contemporary focusing on the policies and politics that will create a bigger change. One thing that also worked in the favor of Bombay Dost after its relaunch was to have celebrities on the cover page. In the year 2010, for the first time, Bombay Dost featured the identifiable queer people by using their own names as the cover page of magazine opposing the celebrity support for the cause. On 20th anniversary issue of the magazine, Bombay Dost features Imran Khan on the cover page. Imran becomes the first top Bollywood actor to feature on any of the cover of the gay magazine. In 2013 Bombay Dost featured Master Chef Vikas Khanna on the cover page by putting emphasis on young faces of the country to bring a wave of change by their views. In 2015 on the 25th anniversary for the first time, Bombay Dost featured a woman actress Kalki Koechlin on the cover page of the newsletter. In the year 2016, the periodical featured Manoj Bajpayee on its cover page addressing his performance as a gay professor in Aligarh, a biographical drama. Celina Jaitley, former Miss India and an Indian Bollywood actress supported and came at the relaunch of the magazine in the year 2009 with her outspoken campaign and support for the gay rights in India.  Challenges  The biggest challenge for the magazine was the distribution mechanism. In initial years, Kavi and other members were able to find a couple of street-side vendors to sell their magazine. The vendors used to put the stuff behind some other titles and providing the magazine only when buyers express their desire for the magazine. The vendors then go away and come back with a magazine in a brown paper envelope.Eventually as the time passed some of the stores started to keep the magazine and situation changes. The challenge was that a single magazine was going through a number of hands. It was because if a person purchases a magazine (which was also very rare), it was read by hundreds of people as people use to left it in public places and offices. It was resulting in losses as demand was very less as compared to supply. Therefore, slowly and gradually Bombay Dost was sold in various large bookstores and also available online. People also had started to purchase the magazine with due respect and honor for the community.

He served as the president of the Rockefeller Foundation for twelve years (1936-1948). He was an ardent internationalist and supporter of the League of Nations, standing as its Undersecretary in its provisional organisation before resigning after the U.S. Senate's failure to ratify the Covenant of the League of Nations. After stepping down from his position as Undersecretary, he started his law firm and grew closer to John D. Rockefeller Jr., which would lead to a long and fruitful relationship as a friend and adviser. From his position as a trustee on the board of the Rockefeller Foundation as well as numerous other Rockefeller philanthropies, he moved to being the president of the foundation. Fosdick lead the organisation through the difficult years of World WarII before retiring and becoming an author, documenting the history of the foundation and Rockefeller Jr.'s life.  Early life  Raymond Blaine Fosdick was born on June 9, 1883, in Buffalo, New York, the son of Frank Sheldon Fosdick and Amy Weaver Fosdick. He grew up in a middle class and devoutly religious family.Revoldt 7-8. While his older brother Harry went on to become a Baptist clergyman, Raymond grew to question religious teachings, later separating himself from his family's religious beliefs.Revoldt 10. He grew up in a household that valued literature and learning highly; with the family often gathering around their living room table, as the children chose books to read from their extensive library.Revoldt 9. This passion for reading was instilled in Raymond from a young age and carried with him into adulthood. He began apprenticing to become a writer and would go on to publish an extensive list of books throughout his life.Revoldt 9. Raymond was educated at Princeton University where he completed his bachelor's degree in 1905. For his master's degree, Fosdick attended New York Law School, graduating in 1908.Venzon 234.  Early career  After graduation, Fosdick started his career working as a public investigator for the city of New York before being appointed Commissioner of Accounts.Ford 39. After having had developed a deep admiration for Woodrow Wilson while being a student of his at Princeton University, Fosdick was nominated as auditor and comptroller of the Democratic National Committee in 1912 despite the fact he was a lifelong Republican.Folly and Palmer 115. The offer came at Wilson's direct request, who told Fosdick in a letter that he would \\"feel greatly honoured that a former pupil, who has distinguished himself in a position of trust, should turn to me at this time\\".Revoldt 69. Fosdick first met John D. Rockefeller Jr. while investigating the issue of \\"white slavery\\" and prostitution, as the latter was the chairman of the special Grand Jury in Manhattan which was looking into the matter.Fosdick, European and American Police Systems 124. Rockefeller later hired Fosdick to conduct a study on police systems in Europe on behalf of the Bureau of Social Hygiene. While the Bureau's work tented to focus on the issue of prostitution, Fosdick's goal was to provide an accurate description of the overall policing methods and arrangements implemented in Europe to provide guidelines for future police reform in the United States.Fosdick, European Police Systems 2. This eventually led to the publication of another report by Fosdick on the American police systems, which would remain incomplete until 1920 because of the interruption caused by World WarI.Fosdick, American Police Systems 5. The publication of his reports meant Fosdick began to gain wider public recognition, leading Secretary of War Newton Baker to appoint him as Chairman of the Commission on Training Camp Activities (CTCA) in 1916 during the Mexican border conflict.Sandos 622. He was tasked with tackling social hygiene issues in military training camps, such as diseases linked to the ripe prostitution trade and morally corrupt behaviour due to the availability of alcohol. He advocated that Baker should both publicly condemn and act to suppress alcohol and prostitution to clean up troop camps while providing resources for healthier recreational activities like sports.Bristow 6. He then went on to serve as special representative for the War Department in France, administering similar prohibitions for troops on the Western Front.Folly and Palmer 115. At the end of the First World War, Fosdick became a civilian aide to General John J. Pershing during the Paris Peace Conference of 1919.Folly and Palmer 115. He was instructed to spend time on the field with American troops and use his expertise to write up reports about their overall morale.Fosdick, \\"Training Camps in World War I\\", 176. Fosdick would subsequently be appointed by President Wilson as Undersecretary to the provisional organisation of the League of Nations, all while being personally concerned that he was not qualified for such an immense task.Brown and Fee 1285. He would later resign, after less than a year in office due to the U.S. Senate's failure to ratify the Covenant of the League of Nations.Folly and Palmer 115. Disappointed, he would nevertheless continue to be a strong internationalist public voice in support of the Wilsonian dream of the League of Nations, notably through his function as President of the League of Nations Non Partisan Association.Venzon 234.  Relationship with Rockefeller  After leaving his position at the League of Nations, Fosdick established a law firm with two partners, James. C Curtis and Chauncey Belknap, with John D. Rockefeller Jr. being his first client.Fosdick, Chronicle of a Generation: An Autobiography 214–215. This marked the beginning of an even closer partnership between the two men. Fosdick advised Rockefeller Jr. on labour relations in businesses in which he had an interest in. He became chairman of the Industrial Relations Counselors Inc., which attempted to prevent labour relations crises from impacting Rockefeller Jr.'s public image and portray him as a \\"liberal industrial statesman\\".Revoldt 346-347. Fosdick used his role as an adviser to Rockefeller to nudge the latter's ardent support for prohibition. He used his position to progressively distance Rockefeller Jr from his association with prohibitionist lobbying groups such as the Anti- Saloon League.Revoldt 357-358. Rockefeller was eventually brought round to Fosdick's view on the issue, commissioning him to the Liquor Study committee on alcohol regulation problems.Folly and Palmer 115. As a result of his close professional relationship with Rockefeller Jr., Fosdick also served as a trustee on numerous philanthropic organisations linked to the Rockefeller foundation including the General Education Board and International Education Board.Brown and Fee 1285. He was also pivotal in the creation of philanthropic organisations such as the China Medical Board, which was created by Rockefeller Jr. as a result of Fosdick's earlier survey of China's medical problems.Revoldt 363. Between 1920 and 1935, Fosdick became an integral part of the Rockefeller Foundation as a trustee and its various philanthropies, serving as a leading voice and adviser to Rockefeller Jr.  President of the Rockefeller Foundation  In 1936, Fosdick became the president of the Rockefeller Foundation and served for the next twelve years.Miller, Fosdick, Raymond Blaine (09 June 1883–18 July 1972). He was the fourth president after John D. Rockefeller Jr., George E. Vincent, and Max Mason. His position as president meant he had to step down from other positions elsewhere, most notably the League of Nations Non-Partisan Association. His long history of involvement in philanthropic and internationalist circles had led to numerous trustee positions, all of which he saw as being a conflict of interests to his new position.Fosdick, Chronicle of a Generation: An Autobiography 252-253. Under his leadership, the Rockefeller Foundation flourished. Previously, the foundation had struggled with maintaining internal cohesion and cooperation, with disagreement and rivalry found at every level of the organisation. One of Fosdick's primary goals at the onset was to restore harmony, and, within eighteen months, he had implemented numerous policy changes that brought the various factions back together and rejuvenated the atmosphere at the foundation.Revoldt 421-422. One of the achievements Fosdick was most proud of was the development of a yellow fever vaccine, which had been an ongoing project funded by the Rockefeller Foundation for many years.Fosdick, Chronicle of a Generation: An Autobiography 260. The foundation also played an important role in the Mexican Agricultural Program, which was a revolutionary plan that started in 1943 to maximise crop production and would go on to kickstart the Green Revolution.Miller, Fosdick, Raymond Blaine (09 June 1883–18 July 1972). Other key achievements were stopping the sudden invasion of malaria into South America and the spread of modern medicine throughout China.Fosdick, Chronicle of a Generation: An Autobiography 272-274. Due to his strong passion for internationalism, Fosdick pushed the foundation beyond the impressive research capabilities it had developed to put greater focus on international knowledge dissemination. This meant that rather than handing out a few large research awards, the foundation would focus on distributing a larger amount of small grants around the world.Revoldt 425. His desire for cooperation and internationalism, which he had hoped would draw the world together at a time of heightening tensions, was dashed in 1939 when the Second World War broke out. It didn't take him by surprise though, as in the years leading up to the war he worried about the increasing tide of totalitarian regimes and what he called the impending \\"intellectual blackout\\", where the academic and research links that the foundation had fostered internationally would be snuffed out.Fosdick, Chronicle of a Generation: An Autobiography 265. Fosdick had done his best to avoid this conclusion by continuing to support research and other programs regardless of politics, even in Nazi Germany, until the war began.Revoldt 425. World War II would go on to be a defining period of Fosdick's presidency. It was a disaster for the foundation, as the research and values it had sought out for years suddenly began to crumble. In his autobiography, Fosdick wrote: > World War II was a disaster for The Rockefeller Foundation as it was for all > agencies everywhere that were dedicated to human welfare. We saw the > destruction in wide stretches of Europe and Asia of the libraries, > laboratories and public health institutes which Vincent and Rose had so > hopefully fostered. An even greater tragedy was the disappearance or death > around the world of hundreds of trained peoples – doctors, nurses, > scientists and scholars – who represented the promise of the future, and > whose creative work the Foundation had supported over long years.Fosdick, > Chronicle of a Generation: An Autobiography 264-265. Fosdick's focus immediately went to preservation. One of their first objectives was to rescue academics and researchers who were displaced or endangered. By 1945, the Rockefeller Foundation had saved 303 scholars, including seven Nobel Prize winners – two of whom would go on to be a part of the atomic bomb project.Revoldt 428. The foundation also helped develop detailed maps of Europe that laid out important cultural monuments and distribute them to Allied bombing headquarters, as a way to protect these historical structures during military operations.Fosdick, Chronicle of a Generation: An Autobiography 255-266. Additional efforts included providing thirty-four million yellow fever vaccine doses to the Allied forces and sending doctors into the city of Naples to deal with a typhus epidemic shortly after being captured by Allied armies. They also funded microfilming projects across England, to preserve historical books and documents from the German bombing raids. After the war, the foundation also funded the rebuilding and restocking of laboratories and libraries throughout Europe.Fosdick, Chronicle of a Generation: An Autobiography 266. The most controversial role of the foundation was the fact that twenty-three of the leading scientists on the atomic bomb project had their specialized training paid for through fellowships from the Rockefeller Foundation, a fact that would leave Fosdick uneasy for years after the end of the war.Fosdick, Chronicle of a Generation: An Autobiography 267. In 1948, at the age of sixty-five, Raymond Fosdick retired from the Rockefeller Foundation.Miller Fosdick, Raymond Blaine (09 June 1883–18 July 1972). During his time as president of the foundation, 200 million dollars were spent towards developing research and academic studies as well as protecting human welfare.Fosdick, Chronicle of a Generation: An Autobiography 272. After his retirement, he spent three years writing The Story of the Rockefeller Foundation, a history of the foundation from its inception. It was published in 1952. He would also go on to write John D. Rockefeller, Jr.: A Portrait, a biography published in 1956.Miller Fosdick, Raymond Blaine (09 June 1883–18 July 1972).  Family life  Fosdick married his first wife, Winifred Finlay, in Montclair, New Jersey on December 2, 1910.New York Times \\"Raymond B. Fosdick Weds.\\" Winifred had struggled with her mental health and was seeking treatment for a nervous disorder.Fosdick, Chronicle of a Generation: An Autobiography 116. On April 4, 1932, she committed suicide after killing their two children: Susan 15 years of age and Raymond Jr. who was nine years old at the time.United Press \\"LAWYER'S WIFE KILLS CHILDREN, TAKES OWN LIFE.\\" In Fosdick's personal autobiography, he mentions the personal grief he felt after reading his wife's letters, realising that her mental deterioration was much worse than he initially thought.Fosdick, Chronicle of a Generation: An Autobiography 249-250. Fosdick eventually remarried in April 1936 to his second wife Elizabeth Miner, a Smith College graduate who also worked on his staff.Fosdick, Chronicle of a Generation: An Autobiography 295.

S. Mithran, and produced by Kotapadi J. Rajesh under his production house KJR Studios. It stars Sivakarthikeyan, Arjun, Abhay Deol, Kalyani Priyadarshan and Ivana in prominent roles. This film marks the Tamil debuts of Deol and Kalyani Priyadarshan. The story was written by P. S. Mithran, Pon Parthiban, Savari Muthu and Antony Bhagyaraj. The music for the film is composed by Yuvan Shankar Raja, with cinematography done by George C. Williams, and editing done by Ruben. The film was released worldwide on 20 December 2019. A Telugu dubbed version titled Shakthi was released on 20 March 2020. Prior to its release, filmmaker Bosco Prabhu accused Mithran for plagiarizing his story. In April 2020, the Madras High Court issued an interim order banning the film from television and streaming platforms, due to which it was taken down from Prime Video. The ban was lifted in May 2020 once the issue was resolved. Plot Sakthivel \\"Sakthi\\" is a young boy who dreams of becoming a superhero, like Shaktimaan. After being ridiculed by his teacher and classmates for believing that Shaktimaan is real, Sakthi tries to prove it by falling off the terrace of his school, injuring himself in the process. His father (Azhagam Perumal) tries to convince Sakthi that Shaktimaan is fictional by showing the disclaimer of actor Mukesh Khanna advising viewers that the events depicted in the show are purely fictitious, causing Sakthi to abandon his hopes of becoming a superhero. Years later, Sakthi (Sivakarthikeyan) and Inbaraj \\"Ink\\" (Robo Shankar) are friends who earn their livelihood as educational brokers and run a xerox shop in their neighbourhood that houses a certificate forgery unit to help the needy secure their desired jobs at the expense of huge commissions. Sakthi bumps across Meera (Kalyani Priyadarshan), a social worker at an educational fair, and falls in love with her. Meera happens to be the inspiration of Mathi (Ivana), a brilliant girl who aspires to become an aeronautical engineer. Mathi devises an engine that runs on saltwater as a measure to help her father (Elango Kumaravel) and many other thwart the problem of rising petrol prices. Meera soon learns of Sakthi's true profession and confronts him, where she learns the reason behind his dark profession; his father disowned him after Sakthi confessed to him that, inspite of securing district rank in the higher secondary examinations, he had sold his certificate in order to obtain money to save his father through surgery as he was suffering from a fatal lung infection. Meera advises him to help Mathi secure an admission in an engineering college without any payment, in order to justify his actions. Sakthi tries to secure admission for Mathi but to no avail. He learns that the only way to help Mathi secure a seat is to demonstrate the practical applications of her engine, which is rejected by Sathyamoorthy (Arjun), Mathi's teacher who runs a school for the academically weak but brilliant children. Sakthi bypasses his warnings and demonstrates the engine at an educational fair by attaching it to an autorickshaw. This attracts the attention of the henchman of Mahadev (Abhay Deol). In turn, he promises a seat for Mathi with a full scholarship. The next day, the autorickshaw is seized by the police, and Mathi is arrested on grounds of Patent violation. The court convicts her guilty of the charges, which distraught her. She attempts suicide by falling off a running train. Sakthi takes her to the hospital, only for the doctors to delay her treatment, and she eventually succumbs to her injuries. Sakthi and Ink are also convicted guilty and are placed on the wanted list for aiding Mathi. Sakthi, on the run, decides that the only way to avenge Mathi's death and prove her innocence is to confront the company issuing the patents. Due to his experience in forging certificates, he easily fishes out the fact that the patent was forged by the company under Mahadev's orders but is attacked in the process when he is rescued by Sathyamoorthy wearing a mask. Sathyamoorthy explains to him that Mahadev is a corrupt business tycoon whose aim is to wipe out innovation in work culture. He also subdues brilliant students and subjects them to lobotomy, rendering their frontal cortex unusable, therefore reducing them to his \\"puppets\\". He uses their innovations to sell them to foreign companies and earn profits. Sathyamoorthy also explains his past; being an advocate of innovation and logical thinking, he tried various ways to inculcate the same in the school curriculum but was faced with opposition and his school was eventually detonated by Mahadev's men, killing the brilliant students. Sathyamoorthy survived the incident, but was beaten up and paralysed by Mahadev's cronies, when he went to avenge them. Thereafter, Sathyamoorthy secretly nurtured the surviving children away from Mahadev in the outskirts of the city. Sakthi, upon hearing Sathyamoorthy's story, decides to fight the system along with him and the children, donning the mantle of the \\"Mask.\\" Using the gadgets developed by the children and Sathyamoorthy's training, Sakthi fights through Mahadev's henchmen and eventually learns the truth. Sathyamoorthy apparently sacrifices himself in the struggle, prompting Sakthi to telecast the innovative inventions of students and explaining to the audience that children should be given the freedom to follow their passion and not be just mere bookworms. He also tells the parents to check their childrens' rough notebooks to find out their interests and desires and encourage the same. Sakthi's father, who happens to hear the telecast, finds Sakthi's rough book and realizes his mistake of mistreating Sakthi. In the final fight, Mahadev's plans are foiled and Sakthi subjects him to lobotomy, disabling him permanently. Six months later, Sakthi, while still on the wanted list, runs the school along with Meera on the outskirts of the city. A police officer (Prem) approaches him and takes him in his jeep around the city, where Sakthi finds major developments in the city due to the innovations of Mathi and other brilliant students. The officer tosses away the documents relating to Sakthi's charges as he had opened his eyes about his child's dreams and requests Sakthi to continue on with the mantle of the Mask. In the post- credits scene, it is also revealed that Sathyamoorthy is alive and is helping Sakthi in his missions.

Reception  The Times of India rated the film 3.5 out of 5, stating that \\"A superhero story origin, that's also a spiritual sequel to Shankar's Gentleman\\". Behindwoods rated the film 2.5 out of 5, stating that \\"Hero is a watchable Super-Hero drama with some inspiring moments.\\" Firstpost rated the 3/5, stating that \\"Mithran has given a neat commercial entertainer, which also calls for a rethink of our educational policy.\\" Sify rated the film 3.5 out of 5 stating that \\"Hero is a must watch for families this holiday season, which has a relevant message on the modern-day educational system.\\" India Today rated the film 2.5 out of 5 stars, stating that \\"Hero had all the potential to become a proper superhero film sensible to Tamil cinema standards. But, the lumbering narrative (in a few portions), exaggerated scenes and illogical loopholes ruin the entire experience.\\" Sudhir Srinivasan rated the film 3 out of 5 stars, stating that \\"Hero takes its messaging very, very seriously. The film is a scathing criticism of the education system. It attacks colleges, pressurising parents, the spineless government, and above all, a syllabus that stifles originality and creativity, and in the words of Mahadev (Abhay Deol), “that is designed to create labourers.” Moorthy (Arjun) says as much.\\" The Indian Express rated 2 out of 5 stating that \\"Sivakarthikeyan’s superpower is being super preachy.\\" Baradwaj Rangan of Film Companion reviewed it as \\"The film is surprisingly understated. It steers clear of massy \\"hero\\" moments, and there's a lot of clear, clean thinking in the writing.\\" Haricharan Pudipeddi reviewed the film as \\"PS Mithran’s Hero is the Gentleman tribute we needed and it’s a film that pretty much gets everything right.\\" Box office The film collected in the first weekend and in the second weekend in Chennai. The film collected in 10 days in Chennai. Legal issues Prior to the film's release, aspiring filmmaker Bosco Prabhu reported Mithran to South Indian Film Writers Association, accusing him of plagiarizing his script registered with the association in 2017 and making it into Hero. After a scrutiny with 18 EC members, film director K. Bhagyaraj who is the head of the association, pointed out the plots of Hero and Bosco's scripts were both the same. Mithran denied any plagiarism, claiming the film had a different plot. Post the association's decision, Bhagyaraj sent Mithran a letter telling him to compensate and give Bosco credits for Hero's story. When Mithran did not respond and went ahead with the film's release, Bhagyaraj insisted Bosco to go to court, assuring him of the association's support. Feeling the members of the association compared the core plots instead of screenplay, Mithran stated that the film's story was incorporated from many stories found in newspaper articles and real-life incidents. He also wrote back to the president of the Writers' Association, denying any plagiarism of Bosco's script, and requesting them to compare and reviews both scripts before reaching a conclusion. In 2020, months after the film started streaming on Prime Video, the court gave a judgement in favor of Prabhu and issued an interim order that resulted in the film being banned from television airings and getting taken down from Prime Video. In May 2020, the case was resolved and the film was reinstated on Prime Video.

The aim of the MVP in Sauri was to halve extreme poverty of villagers living below US$1 between 2000 and 2015. The overarching goal was achieving sustainable development through progress in public health, education, infrastructure, and agricultural productivity.Amrik Kalsi, \\"An Island of Success in a Sea of Failure? The MDGs and Sauri Millennium Village in Kenya\\" (PhD diss., The University of Queensland, 2015), . The experiment in Sauri aimed to provide further learnings for Kenya's Ministry of State of Planning, National Development (MPND) to replicate development initiatives in eight other Kenyan districts. As well, the lessons would help develop a more comprehensive plan for the Kenya Vision 2030 for Macro-economic Growth (KV2030), which is the Kenyan government's commitment to realize the Millennium Development Goals and the elimination of poverty by 2030. Although Kenya adopted integrated rural development (IRD) approaches to target economic growth and poverty since the 1970s, close to eighty percent of the Sauri population lived below the US$1 a day poverty line in 2004 (prior to the adoption of the MVP).Pedro Sanchez et al., \\"The African Millennium Villages\\". PNAS 104, no.43 (October 23, 2007) . Sauri was first chosen due to its high incidence of poverty and hunger. Some of the initial MVP interventions were increasing food production, controlling malaria, constructing a functional clinic and safe drinking water points, and building community capacity. The Sauri Millennium Village Project (SMVP) began in December 2004 with an annual investment of US$2.75 million, which was a record-breaking monetary amount used to alleviate poverty in an African community of its small size.Sam Rich, \\"Africa's Village of Dreams\\" in Woodrow Wilson International Centre for Scholars, quoted in Amrik Kalsi, \\"An Island of Success in a Sea of Failure? The MDGs and Sauri Millennium Village in Kenya\\" (PhD diss., The University of Queensland, 2015), 2. Jeffrey Sachs, the MVP founder, described Sauri as a village \\"that's going to make history\\" and \\"to end extreme poverty\\" in The Diary of Angelina Jolie and Dr. Jeffrey Sachs in Africa, a 2005 MTV documentary.The Diary of Angelina Jolie and Dr. Jeffrey Sachs in Africa, by Andrew Huang, MTV, aired September 14, 2005, https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uUHf_kOUM74 The degree of success or failure found in the SMVP is considered a defining turning point in the development debate – in determining whether developed countries should invest more or reduce foreign development aid. This project's success is under intense scrutiny within Kenya. It is widely known that the MVP has shown short-term results in helping Sauri establish agricultural, educational, and health programmes, and attracting other financial and infrastructural investments from other NGOs.Hellen Kimanthi and Paul Hebinck, Castle in the Sky': Sauri Millennium Village in Reality\\", International Institute of Social Studies, no.38 (February 2016): 2, . On the other hand, it is argued that these programs lack long-term sustainability, undermine the complexity of poverty, create new yet confusing power structures, and lack clear exit strategies. These issues further challenge the longevity of development in Sauri and pose potentially problematic implications.  Background  Sauri is located in the Siaya County about 50 kilometers north of the third largest city of Kisumu in Kenya. The county itself is situated in the former Nyanza Province, in western Kenya. SMVP is a conglomeration of 11 villages covering a 132 square kilometer area, and consists of a population of approximately 60,000 people. The Luo are the dominant ethnic group in the area and speak the Dholo language. The climate is tropical and humid throughout the year in the region. Sauri has a bimodal rainfall pattern with the long rains season from March to June and the short rains from September to December. Water sources in Sauri include protected and unprotected springs, shallow wells, piped water and rainwater harvesting. Agriculture is the primary livelihood for residents, with maize, beans, sorghum, and cassava being the most common crops grown in the region. Cotton and tobacco are also harvested as the two main cash crops.Billystrom Aronya Jivetti, \\"Exploring the Impact of the Millennium Village Promise on Community Networks: The Case of Sauri Millennium Village in Western Kenya\\" (PhD diss., University of Missouri, 2012), . Most livelihood activities that locals engage in are pertinent to poverty alleviation. Beyond subsistence farming, residents also rely on remittances sent from people living and working outside the village. Due to the challenging climate and limited availability of land, Sauri is often subject to low crop yields, which is a major cause for food shortage and undernutrition. At the initiation of the MVP, there was a high prevalence of degraded soils resulting from years of nutrient depletion that occurred because farmers could not afford fertilizers.Richard J. Deckelbaum et al., \\"Econutrition: Implementation Models from the Millennium Villages Project in Africa\\". Food and Nutrition Bulletin 27, no. 4 (December 2006): . Poor soil conditions further perpetuated low crop yields. Prior to the establishment of the Millennium Village, initial assessments of the district reveal heavy disease burdens in terms of malaria, tuberculosis, HIV infection, high levels of malnutrition, respiratory and diarrheal diseases. There were limited antimalarial bed nets available and food was generally cooked indoors over fires. In terms of education, there are three primary schools and one secondary school near the western border of Sauri.  Poverty initiatives and implementations   Poverty and aid initiatives in rural Kenya  Siaya County in western Kenya has a long history of financial aid initiatives.Hellen Vilita Kimanthi, \\"Interlocking and Distancing Processes. An analysis of farmers' interactions with introduced crop production technologies in Sauri Millennium Village, Kenya\\" (MSc Thesis., Wageningen University, 2014), http://edepot.wur.nl/309855 Nyanza Province has been the focus of Kenyan integrated rural development (IRD) approaches since the 1970s, as it is one of the three most impoverished districts of the country. Poor infrastructure, low productivity, and infectious diseases impede poverty alleviation despite efforts from the Kenyan government to promote economic development. Programs such as the District Focus for Rural Development (DFRD) and the Constituency Development Fund (CDF) were introduced in 1983 and 2003, respectively, to support grassroots participation in the implementation of economic development.. International non-governmental organizations began assistance programs in Sauri in the 1990s. Among others, Heifer International and CARE Kenya worked with the International Centre for Research in Agroforestry (ICRAF) and the semi-autonomous government organization Kenya Agricultural Research Institute (KARI) to assist in poverty alleviation. In collaboration, local, national, and international non- governmental initiatives provided assistance in agriculture, disease-control, and poverty reduction.  Goals  As the first and largest Millennium Village, implementations in Sauri began in December 2004. To overcome the self-perpetuating factors of extreme poverty, the MVP provided the population of Sauri with $120 per person annually. $30 were supplied by the Kenyan government, while $60 came directly from the MVP and $20 from other NGOs. An additional $10 were contributions from the village through redistribution programs such as the school feeding projects. The goal of the MVP was to improve four target areas of agricultural productivity, health, education and infrastructure through multiple, simultaneous interventions in two phases. During the first phase, a baseline evaluation of Sauri was made and local leadership structures were established to engage the community in the four target areas.Mutuo et al., \\"Baseline Report - Millennium Research Village Sauri, Kenya\\" (New York: Earth Institute at Columbia University, 2007), quoted in Hellen Vilita Kimanthi, \\"Interlocking and Distancing\\", 41. The second phase put an emphasis on commercialization and connecting Sauri to local market structures.Mutuo et al., \\"Baseline Report\\" quoted in Kimanthi, \\"Interlocking and Distancing\\", 42.  Agriculture  Maize-based subsistence farming is the primary economic activity in Sauri.Bernadette M. Wanjala and Roldan Muradian, \\"Can big push interventions take small-scale farmers out of poverty? Insights from the Sauri Millennium Village in Kenya\\", World Development, no. 45 (May 2013): . In 2005, the first year of the project, fertilizer and high- yield seeds were introduced to increase the output of maize. With support of the Kenyan NGOs, SACRED Africa, and the Teso District-Akkuranut Development Trust, the Kenyan Ministry of Agriculture directly provided training in improved agriculture techniques prior to planting to the people of Sauri.Stephanie Diepeveen, \\"Putting Empowerment into Practice: Evaluating the Potential for 'Development as Freedom' in the Millennium Villages Project\\", Undercurrent 5, no.1 (March 2008): 9, http://search.ebscohost.com/login.aspx?direct=true&db;=aph&AN;=36363917&site;=ehost- live&scope;=site While the MVP provided all inputs in 2005, inputs were subsidized by 50% in 2006. For the remaining years, the MVP did not provide subsidies, but helped Sauri farmers obtain finance and loan opportunities. In order to gain access to markets and generate income, a cereal bank was established to store the produce. From 2006 onwards, additional training in the diversification of crops and various agricultural projects, such as dairy goat farming, beekeeping, and fish farming were sponsored by the MVP.  Education  Through school feeding programs and free education, the MVP sought to increase primary school attendance. All primary schools in the Sauri cluster became part of the school meals program, an initiative based on yield donations from local farmers who were required to donate 10% of their produce to schools in exchange for subsidized seeds and fertilizers. Other interventions included the construction of primary and secondary schools, new classrooms and the improvement of school infrastructure, electricity and the access to safe drinking water.Hope Michelson & Katherine Tully, \\"The Millennium Village Project and Local Land Values/ Using Hedonic Pricing Methods of Evaluate Development Projects\\", World Development, no.101 (January 2018): . Educational teacher trainings were provided by local libraries and Teacher Training Colleges through the Ministries of Education. The training sessions contributed to greater quality of education while free meals gave the children incentives to enrol.  Health  When first interventions were launched in Sauri, there was only one hospital without a doctor to provide care for the entire population. Between 2005 and 2008, three new clinics and a dispensary were built. Health personnel was hired and trained with the support of the Ministry of Health. In addition to developing better health facilities, one major focus of the MVP was disease control. To stop the spread of Malaria, the MVP distributed free insecticide-treated Olyset nets to all households of Sauri. Long-lasting malaria prevention was to be achieved through training sessions and the durability of those mosquito nets.  Infrastructure  Improvements in infrastructure were implemented to increase access to markets, water sources, schools and other institutions. Through turbines and pumps, piped water became available to Sauri residents. Further, the MVP subsidized access to an improved electric grid.Mutuo et al., “Annual Report for Sauri, Kenya Millennium Research Village July 2005 to June 2006”, Millennium Villages Project (July 2005 to June 2006) quoted in Michelson and Tully, \\"The Millennium Village Project\\", 380.  Performance and impacts  The outcomes of the SMVP's interventions have been varied since the start of its implementation in 2005. In order to evaluate the performance of the SMVP, baselines were established using either the conditions of the area prior to the project's execution or the conditions of areas in close proximity to Sauri.  Agriculture  Agricultural productivity limitedly increased after farmers received fertilizers and improved seeds, and training on diversifying their crops. As a result, about 10.1 more bags of crops per hectare were being produced on average by Sauri farmers than those outside the village. However, whether or not this increment in crop yields increased the farmers’ disposable income to reduce poverty levels is not well understood, because more indicators are needed to track how income expenditure changed over the lifespan of the project. Nevertheless, crop diversification on farmland to produce more than just the region's staple maize crop, has helped to spark a transition from subsistence farming to income generation.Generose Nziguheba et al., \\"The African green revolution: Results from the millennium villages project,\\" Advances in agronomy, no. 109 (2010): .  Education  The provision of universal primary education was one of the satisfactory outcomes of the project. Although the Kenyan Government's set of goals to develop the Siaya district cannot be disregarded, the SMVP's strategic location unquestionably attracted greater inputs of investment. This led to improvements in four key areas: free primary education, increased school infrastructure, provision of school meal programs, and improved teacher training. With the enrolment raised to 98% by 2010, all of Sauri's 20,400 primary school children are reportedly receiving daily school meals consisting of locally grown food, as more sustainable food practices are developed within the community.Fieldwork and Earth Institute, \\"Baseline Report\\", 2007, quoted in Amrik Kalsi, \\"An Island of Success in a Sea of Failure? The MDGs and Sauri Millennium Village in Kenya\\" (PhD diss., The University of Queensland, 2015), 111. In addition, the ranking of the Kanyuto Sauri Primary School has significantly gone up from being in the top 200 to being in the top 10 in the district. This is largely attributed to the better nutritional status of the student body at the school. However, it has been reported that some children are left out of the lunch meal program if their family fails to provide a designated amount of maize and bean contributions per pupil.  Healthcare  Previous to the initiation of the SMVP, the population was victim to critical rates of mother-child mortality, undernutrition, anemia, malaria, and intestinal parasites, amongst other health issues. The prevalence rate alone for HIV AIDS was 30% and 43% for malaria in the population before interventions began. In response, the MVP introduced the Sauri Community Dispensary to provide healthcare services that were much nearer to access as compared to the hospital they normally had to travel to. To tackle the spread of malaria, 513 mosquito nets were distributed to households in 2005.Paola Mejía et al., \\"Physical condition of Olyset nets after five years of utilization in rural western Kenya\\", Malaria journal 12, no. 1 (2013): . Their performance was not as high as expected, due to the fact that only 57% of villagers used the nets following the indications of the healthcare workers that provided the nets. Nonetheless, they were used on a regular basis and those that were still in good condition five years later presented a statistically low 5.26% prevalence of malaria parasites in one of the household members using the nets. As a result of the initiatives carried out to reduce the prevalence of malaria and other health concerns particularly in children, public health improved significantly.  Infrastructure  With the development of infrastructure and access to public amenities, the expectation for the price of land was that it would increase significantly as compared to the rate of increase of the area just outside of Sauri. However, these prices have been rising at comparable rates, suggesting that the price increase within and outside of Sauri is not necessarily due to the outcomes of the project, making its impact in this regard somewhat ambiguous for development agencies. Grain banks and storage facilities were set up prior to harvesting seasons in order to reduce the amount of postharvest losses that resulted from the surplus of crop yields. Because productivity increased, farmers had surpluses they could store in these grain banks and improve the food security of the community during lower productive harvesting seasons. These storages were improved in the second year of the project to maintain optimal conditions of the grains over longer periods of time.  Community engagement  One of the key concerns of the MVP was to engage local people and create “bottom-up”, sustainable processes of development.Diepeveen, “Putting Empowerme However, many foreign experts and leadership structures were introduced to Sauri. Although training sessions and interest groups experienced high participation and fostered local community leaders, they did not represent the traditional village administration. Luo power structures in the Sauri sub-location are organized through a chief, village elders and specific age and gender roles that would sometimes interfere with implementations of the MVP.  Social networks  The notable impacts on the community and change in Sauri's social network structures were some of SMVP's unintended consequences. The development initiatives in Sauri became sources of networking. Many interest groups, cooperatives, and development organizations became involved and formed stronger ties within the community. Agricultural groups were formed and provided participants with opportunities to create personal networks that initially generated more collaboration and further boosted locals’ expectations for the project. Once they learned to benefit from the formal services, they opted to strengthen them, rather than return to previous, less skilled groups they had before the project. Community members also held \\"barazas\\", which became their preferred setting for organizing community meetings, voicing any concerns, or solving disputes between each other. Village elders had a key role in these interactions, as well as in bridging communication between government agencies and MVP participants. Many villagers also had religious affiliations, which became another form of networking that the MVP deeply impacted. Church organizations could unite community members and act as safe locations for them to receive what was perceived as organized and transparent support. Nevertheless, as the project continued villagers developed a growing concern at the declining trend in collaboration. The lack of trust in the outcomes, failed promises, lack of transparency with MVP resources among the leaders, and inaccessibility by the MVP team were all constraints that began to inhibit collaboration. For example, Jeffrey Sachs began to arrive with police escorts to Sauri, which raised fear amongst the villagers and distanced them from other leaders and project managers. Given that time is a major variable in the emergence of benefits yielded by the project's interventions, some of the outcomes of the SMVP will take longer to be capitalized into fungible value. MVP investments discontinued in 2015 once the term for intervention expired and the village was expected to be self-sustaining. However, a number of performance indicators suggest that the village was not prepared to continue operations independently.  Criticisms   Community engagement  One of the largest criticisms of SMVP is that it is a top-down approach to development that lacks consultation and a feedback loop.Hellen Kimanthi and Paul Hebinck, Castle in the Sky': Sauri Millennium Village in Reality\\", Colloquium Paper, no.38 (February 4–5, 2016): 1, https://www.iss.nl/sites/corporate/files/38-ICAS_CP_Kimanthi_and_Hebinck.pdf. The “Big Five” development interventions that Sachs identified for Sauri—basic health, education, communication services, safe drinking water, and sanitation—were seen as one-size-fits-all solutions to poverty.Kimanthi and Hebinck. “‘Castle in the Sky’,” 2. SMVP claimed to have incorporated local knowledge through consultation, but that was largely inadequate. In surveys, villagers were assumed to be a homogenous group of similarly poor individuals, and their responses were taken as mutual. This method did not consider that Sauri villagers were not all equally poor or poor in the same way, and therefore had varying interests, wants, and needs.Edward Carr, “The millennium village project and African development problems and potentials,” Progress in development studies, no.8 (October 2008), quoted in Kimanthi and Hebinck, “‘Castle in the Sky’,” 2. For example, large farmers that produced goods for the world market were more business-oriented, as opposed to small subsistence farmers.Japhy Wilson, “Model villages in the neoliberal era: the Millennium Development Goals and the colonization of everyday life,” Journal of Peasant Studies, no. 41 (December 2013), quoted in Kimanthi and Hebinck. “‘Castle in the Sky’,” 2. Unable to consider these divergences, SMVP's initial goals were not comprehensive enough.  Social relations  By introducing a model that benefitted wealthy farmers, and systematically disadvantaged poor and subsistence farmers, agricultural interventions exacerbated social inequalities. SMVP introduced a package of hybrid seeds and fertilizers to improve agricultural productivity. These packages were initially handed out free of charge, but were later only available to be purchased. Small subsistence farmers did not have the money to buy these packages, while wealthier farms had more purchasing power and continued to reap the benefits of higher crop yields.Kimanthi and Hebinck. “‘Castle in the Sky’,” 8. Despite an overall welfare gain of this intervention, the gains did not trickle down to the poorest of the poor in Sauri. Instead, by neglecting to consider social relations and long term consequences, it further harmed relations between villagers by exacerbating .  Choice of location  Sauri may also not have been the best place to receive a Millennium Village designation. The objective of MVP was to reduce poverty in the poorest communities in the world, but Sauri had been receiving funding and assistance throughout the 1990s. Since the early 1990s, the International Center for Research on Agroforestry (ICRAF) and Kenya Agricultural Research Institute (KARI) have been conducting research on soil fertility in Sauri.Kimanthi and Hebinck. “‘Castle in the Sky’,” 4. Further, Africa Now, a UK non-profit group, began funding the building of spring-protection cisterns in Sauri in the late 1990s.Kimanthi and Hebinck. “‘Castle in the Sky’,” 4. If the MVP model were to be truly tested for its potential to eradicate poverty in the most dire communities, some critics, like the journalist Victoria Schlesinger, believe that it would have been more logical to make Millennium Villages out of destinations that have never received external funding or support.Victoria Schlesinger, “The continuation of poverty. Rebranding foreign aid in Kenya,” Harpers, (May 2007), quoted in Kimanthi and Hebinck. “‘Castle in the Sky’,” 5. While the response has been that Sauri was chosen because of its high levels of poverty and hunger despite having received assistance, critics have accused project managers of choosing Sauri due to its higher potential for success, which would bode well for the MVP model.Schlesinger, “The continuation,” quoted in Kimanthi and Hebinck. “‘Castle in the Sky’,” 5.  Evaluation of impacts  Weak impact evaluation has also created quite a stir among critics and observers of SMVP alike. Careful project assessment is a necessary mechanism for weeding out project inefficiencies, improving resource allocation, and measuring up project outcomes against its goals. However, MVP data has very strict access, and independent researchers are not allowed to access these files or request interviews with MVP staff members to gain a better understanding of the project.Kimanthi and Hebinck. “‘Castle in the Sky’,” 6. As a result, the public has continually questioned the MVP's data collection methods. In June 2010, a public midterm evaluation of MVP impacts was released for five Millennium Villages, one of which was Sauri.Michael A. Clemens, \\"When does rigorous impact evaluation make a difference? The case of the Millennium Villages\\", Journal of Development Effectiveness 3, no. 3 (2011): . This report compared Sauri's post-intervention circumstances with pre-intervention conditions. It did not take into account what may have occurred in Sauri in the absence of MVP intervention. For example, if Sauri had not been designated a Millennium Village, the government may have implemented similar initiatives, like building schools, improving infrastructure, allocating money to vaccination, or improving teacher training programs. Such changes, if successful, would have also improved standard of living and reduced poverty in Sauri. Because MVP impact evaluation reports did not consider these counterfactuals, MVPs have also been criticized for exaggerating their successes.

Megargee, Martin C. Dean, and Mel Hecker, Volume II, part B, pp. 1038–1039. Towards the end of December 1941, the women learnt that the ghetto would soon be liquidated. Some women fled, finding refuge with local farmers. Some women later reached the Šiauliai Ghetto. On 30–31 December 1941, those women who remained in the ghetto were taken to Rainiai and shot. Aftermath In total, of those women who escaped the ghetto, some 64 survived when the Soviet army liberated the area from the Nazis.

Rogell and written by Adele Buffington and Fred Allen. The film stars Ken Maynard, Eugenia Gilbert, James Mason, Charles Hill Mailes, Jack McDonald and Blue Washington. The film was released on December 23, 1928, by First National Pictures. Plot In a story set in the Wild West, an anonymous killer plots to steal a gold mine from its rightful owner. Tim Kelly (Maynard) and Joe Bridges (Mason) are summoned to Gold City, a long abandoned mining town, by a mysterious masked phantom. Tim learns he is to inherit a gold mine there which is still active, but he receives a dire warning from the killer telling him to leave town. It turns out the phantom who summoned them there was Tim's father, and Tim discovers the killer's identity is Joe Bridges, who was trying to get the mine for himself. As Bridges attempts to leave town with the gold, he accidentally rides off a cliff to his death. Cast *Ken Maynard as Tim Kelly *Eugenia Gilbert as Sally Ann Drew *James Mason as Joe Bridges *Charles Hill Mailes as Benedict *Jack McDonald as Simon *Blue Washington as 'Blue' *Ben Corbett as Gang Member *Tarzan as Tarzan the horse Production Ken Maynard had earlier mixed the horror and western genres with his 1926 film The Haunted Ranch, and its success led to The Phantom City. Phantom City was regarded as one of Ken Maynard's best silent films, but in 1932 when the film was remade with sound as Haunted Gold (starring John Wayne), the silent version dropped out of circulation. Both versions featured African American actor Blue Washington doing his racially offensive \\"scared Negro\\" routine. The John Wayne remake utilized a lot of stock footage from the Ken Maynard version. Director Rogell later moved into directing television westerns such as Broken Arrow in the 1950s.Workman, Christopher; Howarth, Troy (2016). \\"Tome of Terror: Horror Films of the Silent Era\\".

Other provisions included making the Land and Water Conservation Fund permanent, protecting a number of rivers and historic sites, and withdrawing land near Yellowstone National Park and North Cascades National Park from mining. Passage of the bill was hailed as a rare bipartisan environmental victory. Legislative history Signing of the Act in the Oval Office, March 12, 2019 The last major bill passed regarding public lands was the Omnibus Public Land Management Act of 2009. Since then many bills had been introduced but never passed; the Act incorporates over more than 100 pieces of legislation, collectively introduced by some 50 senators and a range of representatives.

The Senate voted for the bill 92–8 on February 12, 2019, and the House of Representatives passed it 363–62 on February 26. President Donald Trump signed it into law on March 12, 2019, as P.L. 116-9. Following initial passage, an addendum named the bill for John Dingell, Jr. to honor the recently deceased former Congressperson who had sponsored multiple landmark conservation laws during his lengthy tenure, and was known as being an avid outdoorsman and conservationist.

She is a federal deputy in the LXIV Legislature of the Mexican Congress, representing the tenth federal electoral district of Puebla. Life Radio and TV Salvatori, a graduate of the Universidad Madero with a degree in communications, gained fame in radio and television. In 2009, she appeared on the program '. She also presented the news for TV Azteca Puebla between 2011 and 2014. In January 2015, while she worked at Tribuna Comunicación-owned XHPBA-FM and hosted a program known as Ta'Carbón, she posed on air as an IMSS doctor to joke about a woman being beaten by her husband. That drew the ire of activists, including one who had been invited on her show. In addition, she was reported twice to the National Council to Prevent Discrimination. The next month, she was fired after a confrontation with Ana Patricia Montero Rossano, the director of the station, whom she accused of organizing harassment against her. Salvatori would marry Ana's brother, Mario Montero Rosano, in May 2015. Three months after getting married, she resumed broadcasting her show online. On 18 January 2018, Salvatori began a new program at Grupo ORO-owned XECD-AM 1170. However, one month later, she left the station in order to attend to her pregnancy, though rumors were already circulating about a potential run for office. Run for federal deputy Despite initially denying the candidacy, Salvatori secured the nomination from the 10th federal district under the Juntos Haremos Historia coalition banner, with her bid ultimately being assigned to the Social Encounter Party (PES). During the campaign, she gave birth to a baby boy. As the race neared its end, Salvatori filed a complaint against Ana Cristina Ruiz Rangel, one of her opponents, for gender violence. As a federal deputy Upon winning election, Salvatori was assigned to four commissions, including a secretary post on the Radio and Television Commission and a slot on the bicameral commission that controls Canal del Congreso.

She also called for a ban on bullfighting and wrote a bill to outlaw it at the federal level. In March 2019, Salvatori brought her son Mario onto the floor of the Chamber of Deputies and delivered a speech about verbal insults hurled toward mothers by other women, saying she was \\"fed up with being called a bad mother\\" for exercising her profession and posting photos of herself on social media.

He pioneered the use of surgical staples, the treatment of chest wall deformities, and non-operative management of intussusception. Early life and education Ravitch was born in 1910 in New York City. He attended the University of Oklahoma, where he was a member of the Phi Beta Kappa Society and graduated with a degree in zoology in 1930. He received his M.D. from Johns Hopkins University in 1934 and remained at Johns Hopkins to complete his surgical training, which he finished in 1943 under the mentorship of Alfred Blalock.  Career  During the Second World War he served as an army major directing a team of surgeons at the 56th General Hospital in France. He returned to Johns Hopkins at the conclusion of the war, becoming a professor of surgery in 1946. In the late 1940s he developed a new treatment for intussusception, a pediatric condition in which part of the intestine folds into itself. His technique involved the use of a barium enema which could reduce intestinal pressure without the need for surgery. He also pioneered a new surgical procedure for the correction of pectus excavatum, a chest wall deformity, which became known as the Ravitch procedure. Ravitch moved to New York City in 1952 as a professor of surgery at Columbia College of Physicians and Surgeons and as the director of surgery at Mount Sinai Hospital. He returned to Baltimore after three years to resume his role of professor of surgery at Johns Hopkins and was also appointed surgeon in chief of Baltimore City Hospitals. After visiting the Soviet Union in 1958 and noticing their surgeons' use of fairly crude staplers surgical staples as a time-saving replacement for suturing by hand, Ravitch and Félicien M. Steichen spent several years designing and testing surgical staplers for use in the United States; their design reached the market in 1967 and would eventually become ubiquitous in operating rooms. Ravitch spent three years at the University of Chicago Medical School from 1966 to 1969 as the head of the pediatric surgery division, before moving to the University of Pittsburgh. In Pittsburgh he served as surgeon in chief at Montefiore Hospital. He continued to teach as a professor of surgery at Pittsburgh until his death in 1989 from colon cancer and prostate cancer. Legacy Ravitch served as president of the American Surgical Association in 1983–1984. During the course of his career he published 453 papers, 101 book chapters and 22 books, and was the editor of 20 medical journals. He is regarded as one of the founders of the subspecialty of pediatric surgery, and he and Félicien Steichen are credited with introducing surgical staples to the United States. He was regarded as an authority on the treatment of various deformities of the chest wall. In 1985, Johns Hopkins University established the Mark M. Ravitch, M.D. Endowed Professorship in Surgery.

Power output was from a single- stage free power turbine and was initially a very modest . During early post- war helicopter development, the use of cold and hot rotor tip-jets was widely investigated.

Ultrasound is an excellent method for the study of the penis, such as indicated in trauma, priapism, erectile dysfunction or suspected Peyronie's disease.Originally copied from: CC-BY license Ultrasound is an imaging modality that, in addition to being well tolerated and widely available, is considered an excellent method for the evaluation of many penile diseases. Penile trauma, priapism, Peyronie's disease, and erectile dysfunction are some of the conditions in which penile ultrasound finds significant applicability. Currently, linear transducers have a maximum frequency of 12-15 MHz, which increases the definition on ultrasound images. Although penile evaluation is usually performed when the penis is flaccid, in some situations, such as in cases of erectile dysfunction, the examination should be performed during erection, by injection of vasoactive drugs into the corpora cavernosa. The penis should be positioned in the anatomical position (over the abdomen) and evaluated in the transverse and longitudinal directions, from the glans toward the base of the penis. In specific situations, such as in the evaluation of Peyronie's disease, the penis should also be positioned on a towel/sheet or on the testicular sac, with a lateral approach. Anatomy and physiology Figure 1: Normal penile anatomy, dorsal and cross-sectional view showing two hypoechoic images corresponding to the corpora cavernosa, with an echoic line that surrounds them and corresponds to the tunica albuginea. Figure 2: Longitudinal section of the penis under right lateral access. Note the cylindrical structure, corresponding to the corpus cavernosum (thick arrow), in the superior portion and the corpus spongiosum (thin arrow), adjacent to the corpus cavernosum, in the inferior portion. The corpora cavernosa are homogeneous and relatively hypoechoic cylindrical structures lined with tunica albuginea, a thin membrane that has a thickness of approximately 2 mm when the penis is flaccid and 0.25 mm when it is erect. The corpus spongiosum, a ventral, medial body that is more echoic than the corpora cavernosa, is also covered by the tunica albuginea and contains the urethra. As can be seen in Figures 1 and 2, it is more dilated and prominent in its proximal segment, known as the bulb, and in its distal segment, constituting the glans. Buck's fascia is superficial to the tunica albuginea and covers all of the structures described. Venous drainage is performed by the deep and superficial dorsal veins of the penis. The dorsal arteries of the penis are located adjacent to the deep dorsal vein and a cavernous artery is located in the center of each corpus cavernosum. On color Doppler, the cavernous arteries present single phase flow. In the flaccid penis (Figure 3), the normal cavernous arteries show a systolic peak between 11 and 20 cm/s. At the beginning of erection, the systolic and diastolic flows undergo progressive increases. When vein occlusion begins, the diastolic flow decreases progressively, and once stiffness is established, it becomes negative. Figure 3: Longitudinal, ventral ultrasound of the penis, with pulsed mode and color Doppler. Normal flow pattern of the cavernous artery in a flaccid penis. Penile trauma Penile trauma can result from a blunt or penetrating injury, the latter being rarely investigated by imaging methods, almost always requiring immediate surgical exploration. In the erect penis, trauma results from stretching and narrowing of the tunica albuginea, which can undergo segmental rupture of one or both of the corpora cavernosa, constituting a penile fracture. File:Ultrasonography of ruptured tunica albuginea.jpg|Figure 4 A: Ultrasound of the penis, right lateral view. Longitudinal section showing rupture of the tunica albuginea with an adjacent 1.92 cm hematoma (between calipers), due to trauma. Priapism Priapism is defined as a painful and prolonged penile erection, with or without sexual stimulation. Color Doppler ultrasound is the imaging method of choice for the investigation of priapism, because it is noninvasive, widely available, and highly sensitive. By means of this method, it is possible to diagnose priapism and differentiate between its low- and high-flow forms. Figure 5: Color Doppler ultrasound demonstrating a hypoechoic collection that corresponds to hematoma with arteriovenous fistula secondary to traumatic injury of the penis due to impact with bicycle handlebars, resulting in high-flow priapism. Peyronie's disease Peyronie's disease is characterized by fibrotic thickening of the tunica albuginea, which can lead to curvature of the penis and difficulty in achieving an erection. Penile fibromatosis (Peyronie's disease) is marked by the formation of fibrous plaques identified as areas where the tunica albuginea is thickened. Although plaques are more common on the dorsum of the penis, they can also be seen on the ventral face, lateral face, or septum. File:Ultrasonography of orpus cavernosum calcification.jpg|Figure 6: Transverse ultrasound of the penis, in a ventral view, in the middle portion of the penis. Note the echoic image with posterior acoustic shadowing, corresponding to calcification (arrow), in the left corpus cavernosum. Erectile dysfunction Most cases of erectile dysfunction of organic causes are related to changes in blood flow in the corpora cavernosa, represented by occlusive artery disease, most often of atherosclerotic origin, or due to failure of the veno-occlusive mechanism. Preceding the ultrasound examination with Doppler, the penis must be examined in B mode, in order to identify possible tumors, fibrotic plaques, calcifications, or hematomas, as well as to evaluate the appearance of the cavernous arteries, which can be tortuous or atheromatous.

It was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1972. History Nathan Benedict was born in 1809 in Walton, New York. He apprenticed as a carpenter, and in 1835 same to Michigan. In 1842 he married Louisa Prentice of Marshall, and from 1842 until 1852 he worked as a carpenter and builder in Marshall. In approximately 1844 he constructed this house for his own use. In 1854, the house was purchased by Dr. Henry L. Joy. Joy was born in Ludlowville, New York, in 1822, and graduated from Jefferson Medical College of Philadelphia in 1849. He married Carolyn Schuyler in 1851 in New York, then came directly to Marshall. The Joys added the tower to the home in about 1857. Joy served in a number of municipal offices, including serving as Marshall's mayor in 1877. The Joys live in the house until their deaths: Henry's in 1892 and Carolyn's in 1893. The couples four sons lived in the house after their deaths. It was eventually sold to Richard Walters, and in 1944 to Robert J. Sackett. Description The Joy house is a two-story frame structure with clapboards and a gabled roof, built in a style somewhat reminiscent of the Italian Villa style. The windows are double-hung sash units with plain trim. The most distinctive feature of the house is the three-story corner tower, with a pyramidal roof and crocketed finial somewhat like a pagoda. The tower has box cornices, and two front windows with bracketed balconies and cornices. The front porch is also bracketed, and framed by square columns.

History and profile Zonneland was first published in 1920, and by 1922 had 100,000 subscribers. It was a catholic magazine, directed and published by the Averbode Abbey. It shared some elements with Petits Belges, but the French language version had less purely catholic contents and more stories and general information. Between 1929 and 1934, Petits Belges was replaced by a magazine for girls (Stella) and one for boys (Cadet). In 1930, the first of the long-running series of Vlaamse Filmpjes (complete stories of 32 pages, published every week or every two weeks) was inserted as a supplement to Zonneland. By 1935, Zonneland had dropped to 60,000 subscribers, while Petits Belges only was printed in 28,000 copies. In 1936, Father Daniel De Kesel became the new editor-in-chief, and started writing articles using the pen name \\"Nonkel Fons\\". He remained in charge until 1984. The magazines had to suspend publication between September 1943 and November 1944 due to the censoring and paper shortage during the war. In 1966, Zonneland had nearly 120,000 subscribers, and by 1976 this had increased to 135,000.

Nationwide recurring electrical blackouts in Venezuela began in March 2019. Experts and state-run Corpoelec (Corporación Eléctrica Nacional) sources attribute the electricity shortages to lack of maintenance and to a lack of technical expertise in the country resulting from a brain drain; Nicolás Maduro's administration attributes them to sabotage. Since March, various nationwide blackouts occurred in the country. The first widespread blackout began on 7 March 2019 at 4:56 pm local time (GMT-4); it lasted through 14 March, when power was restored to much of the country. It was the largest power outage in the country's history, and affected the electricity sector in Venezuela in most of its 23 states, as well as Roraima border state of Brazil, causing serious problems in hospitals and clinics, industry, transport and in water service. At least 43 deaths resulted. On 12 March, power returned to some parts of the country, but Caracas remained only partially powered and western regions near the border with Colombia remained dark. Power outages persisted in some areas for many days after 14 March. Between 14 and 16 of Venezuela's 23 states were again without power from 25 March to 28 March; at least four people died as a result of the three-day lack of power. Another blackout started in the evening of 29 March, followed by another 24 hours later. During the month of March, Venezuela was without power for at least 10 days overall. The ongoing power outages have worsened the crisis in Venezuela and \\"suffering, cutting off water supplies and leaving hospitals and airports in the dark\\". On 31 March, Maduro announced a 30-day plan to ration power, and Juan Guaidó announced that Japan was prepared to make investments in Venezuela to help solve the power outages. Another major national blackout occurred on 22 July.  History  Most of Venezuela's power comes from one of the largest hydroelectric dams in the world, Guri Dam in Bolívar State, Venezuela on the Caroni River; as of 2019, 70–80% of Venezuela's power comes from Guri. Venezuela has a history of electrical blackouts dating at least to 2010; Juan Nagel wrote in Foreign Policy in 2016 that the problems resulted from \\"massive government corruption [...] and the country’s disastrous energy policies\\". Univision also reported that the problems in the energy sector resulted from corruption and \\"lack of maintenance and investment\\". A report from Transparency Venezuela said that maintenance was abandoned for twenty years beginning in 1998. The aging infrastructure made the problems worse, and critics were silenced; a union leader for state power workers was arrested in 2018 by the Bolivarian Intelligence Service for warning that a blackout was likely. The private company, Electricidad de Caracas was owned by the United States' AES Corporation until 2007; according to The Wall Street Journal, \\"Venezuela's power grid was once the envy of Latin America\\". Then-President Hugo Chávez created the state-run Corpoelec by nationalizing the electric sector and expelling private industry in 2007; hence, the state has been solely responsible for energy supply for over ten years. Univision says Chávez \\"admitted failures (...) such as the 'insufficient' availability of the thermoelectric generation plant and the limitations of the national electric power transmission network and distribution systems\\"; he signed a decree in 2010 declaring a \\"State of Emergency of the National Electric Service\\". Chávez had Corpoelec speed up projects, and bypassing the process of public bidding for projects, he \\"authorized 'contracting by direct award',\\" which facilitated corruption. In 2009, the Chávez administration declared a national electric emergency and invested $100 billion US dollars towards solving it. The Chávez administration \\"distributed million-dollar contracts without bidding that enriched high officials of his government and the works were never built\\", according to Univision. The Wall Street Journal stated that the government awarded electrical contracts to companies with little experience in the energy sector. Billions of dollars were awarded in contracts for projects that were never completed, leading to international investigations of \\"high officials of the Chavez regime today persecuted for plundering the coffers of the Bolivarian Republic\\". Critics say that one company, Derwick Associates, was given projects although they had no previous experience; Derwick denies any bribes were involved. Of 40 energy projects approved between 2010 and 2014 analyzed by Transparency Venezuela, 17 are not completed as of March 2019, none are operating at capacity, and overcharging by billions of dollars was identified. Hugo Chávez in Brasilia in 2011 Further complicating the technical matters, the administration of Corpoelec was handed over to a Venezuelan National Guard Major General, Luis Motta Domínguez, who had admitted to a lack of experience in the energy industry. Restarting an aging power grid requires specialists and equipment that may no longer be available in Venezuela, as a result of a brain drain; thousands of workers have left the country, or have left Corpoelec because of \\"meager wages and an atmosphere of paranoia fed by Mr. Maduro's ever-present secret police\\", according to experts cited by The New York Times. There were two major blackouts in 2013. In 2016, Venezuela had a severe electricity crisis that caused blackouts, industry shutdowns, and the decision by then-President Nicolás Maduro to cut back on government employees' work hours. Maduro's administration has put rationing in place several times, and changed the country's clocks to accommodate a daytime commute. Nagel wrote in 2016, \\"... there are two main reasons for the crisis: excessive electricity consumption and insufficient production. And the root of both of these problems is bad governance: populism, poor planning, inflexible ideology, and overwhelming corruption.\\" And in 2017, there were more than 18,000 power outages nationwide. In 2017, the National Assembly investigated the $100 billion invested in the electrical system and determined that over $80 billion was embezzled, that more than 14 thermoelectric stations were not functioning, and that neither the electrical transmission nor the distribution system had adequate maintenance. Attempts to explain the ongoing power failures, despite the billions of dollars spent, have led to public scorn and ridicule on social media; in 2018, Motta Dominguez said on Instagram, \\"Comrades! In some cases, faults in the electrical system are produced by animals such as: rats, mice, snakes, cats, squirrels, rabbits, turkey vultures, etc., that are looking for burrows, nests or hiding places, and are introduced into the system's equipment causing the failure.\\" In March 2019, two Venezuelan citizens—Jesús Ramón Veroes and Luis Alberto Chacín Haddad, who live in the US and have long associations with Corpoelec's Motta Domínguez—were charged in Florida District Court with money laundering, violating the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act, and \\"misappropriation, theft and embezzlement of public funds by or for the benefit of a public official\\"; the complaint alleges millions of dollars were transferred from Corpoelec to their Florida bank accounts in 2016 and 2017.  Causes  alt= Most of Venezuela's largest cities are powered from the San Geronimo B substation, connected to the hydroelectric power plant at the Gurí Dam \\"via one of the longest high-voltage lines in the world\\". Sources cited by Corpoelec indicated a vegetation fire occurred on three lines of between the dam and the Malena and San Gerónimo B substations. The fire overheated the lines, triggering load rejection mechanisms that protect the lines connected to the dam. According to the School of Electrical Engineering of the Central University of Venezuela, the momentary loss of power at the Gurí Dam caused the turbines to increase their speed, creating an overload on electrical systems. The university further stated that the safety control systems in Gurí were activated to reduce the increased energy input, but the system became uncontrollable and forced operators to disconnect the generators in the dam. When the generators were disconnected, the electrical frequency could not be regulated and overloaded power plants located in Caruachi and Macagua. Because thermal power plants in Venezuela are not being operated due to the shortages of fuel provided by PDVSA, fluctuations in electrical frequencies exacerbated the power grid and contributed to continued blackouts. Satellite images by NASA show that the vegetation fire in the Guri started a day before the blackout. Vegetation near power lines in Venezuela had not been pruned since 2018 – a particularly serious situation because of the dry season. Engineers and analysts quoted by The Guardian say the cause is underfunding and mismanagement, including the deployment of soldiers to operate electrical substations instead of electricians. A fault affected three large cables from the Simón Bolívar Hydroelectric Plant, which supply 80% of Venezuela's power. One cable lost power between the Malena and San Gerónimo B substations on the main network, which caused the other two to also lose power. The engineer Miguel Lara, ex-manager of the Office of Planning of the Interconnected System, quoted by El Pitazo, declared the thermal plants did not start and that the rapid response generation plants did not work, so the electric service during the blackout was restored only in some areas. The New York Times quoted José Aguilar, a Chicago-based Venezuelan power industry expert and consultant for reinsurance companies, who reviewed country-wide power levels during the blackout and said the government had attempted to restart Guri multiple times, leading to an explosion at a nearby substation. Aguilar said these restart attempts had damaged \\"something else in the system, destabilizing the grid yet further (...) Obviously, they are hiding something from us.\\" The blackout occurred on Thursday 7 March; The New York Times said Corpoelec workers and a manager said no date had been set by 11 March for restart; that they were asked not to report to work that Monday; and the Times added, \\"[t]heir names have been withheld to protect them from government reprisals.\\" Another backup substation, San Geronimo A, is connected to a smaller plant at Matagua, and was able to send a weaker, intermittent current during the blackout. The government had built over a dozen backup plants powered by diesel or natural gas; none of them functioned during the outage. The New York Times said the supply of fuel required to run thermal power plants has been affected by US sanctions. The administration of Nicolás Maduro blamed US sabotage for the outage without providing any evidence, according to the BBC and The New York Times. Maduro alleged that the US had used advanced technology for a cyberattack on the grid. Jorge Rodríguez, communications minister for the Maduro administration, pointed to Twitter posts by US Senator Marco Rubio, Secretary of State Mike Pompeo, and acting president Juan Guaidó, alleging that they demonstrated inside information about the blackout. Guaidó said Maduro's administration had failed to maintain the electrical grid. Venezuelan energy experts cited by El Pitazo have rejected the theory that the blackout was caused by sabotage, since the area of the Gurí Dam is heavily guarded by members of the Armed Forces, where it operates a special command and the internal security of Corpolec. These specialists have also pointed out that Gurí was constructed before the Internet existed, does not use the Internet, hence does not allow for hacking. A risk management consultant cited by El Nacional dismissed the statement by government officials and assured that the design of the hydroelectric plant system does not allow \\"attacks\\" of that type. He said, \\"These systems can not be attacked remotely. They are closed control systems designed for generating turbines to work synchronously,\\" and that would be \\"like hacking a refrigerator or a blender.\\" and * as analyzed at * The term \\"electromagntic attack\\" often used, for a blackout of this magnitude, to refer an electromagnetic pulse (EMP) generated by a high-altitude nuclear explosion, similar to those tested by the US in Starfish Prime or by Soviet Union's Project K. Sharon Burke from New America, a non partisan think tank, consider that such an event would be noticeable by other nations. David Weinstein, chief security officer at Claroty, a security company that specializes in protecting infrastructure, considers unlikely the use of electromagnetic bursts to knock out the Venezuelan electric grid and states that \\"the power fails easily in Venezuela anyway, so it’s almost like a waste of the capability\\". Lisandro Cabello, secretary of the state of Zulia governorship from the PSUV party, said the explosions in electrical substations in that state were caused by kites.  Effects  The most vulnerable sectors of society were affected, with power, water, food, transportation and medical shortages. France 24 reported that the country lost US$200 million daily according to Carlos Larrazabal, the head of Fedecámaras; he said the biggest losses were in the food sector. Torino Capital investment bank estimated that US$1 billion was lost from Venezuela's GDP as a result of the power outages. Also available online.  Food and water  With the blackout, already existing shortages of food and medicine were aggravated; refrigerated food products were damaged, and meat, fish and dairy retailers without refrigeration had to close. With ongoing disruption in refrigeration, Fedecameras said that production of meat, milk and vegetables were cut in half. One bakery said it had lost all bread dough for one day, which was equivalent in value to 56 times the monthly minimum wage. Due to the lack of electricity, the water distribution system also had shortages. José de Viana, an engineer and former president of Hidrocapital, the municipal water company in Caracas, said that the 20,000 liters per second of water that Caracas needs fell to 13,000 during the blackouts, and later completely stopped. He said that 90% of the thermoelectric plants that work as a backup if power fails are not operational because of lack of maintenance, or they have been simply disconnected, and that \\"the most important population centers in the country [had] zero water supply for more than four days. Not a single drop of new water has been entering Caracas since Thursday, 7 March\\". According to The Washington Post, analysts said that two-thirds of Venezuela's population (20 million people) were without water, partially or completely, in the weeks after the blackouts. In Caracas, beginning 11 March, hundreds of people swarmed the polluted Guaire River in the center of Caracas to fill plastic containers with contaminated water, or collected water from streams at El Ávila National Park. Others tried to catch water from the city's sewer drains. Hundreds of people lined up at the foot of El Ávila hill to collect water from its streams. Long lines were reported in the state of Carabobo to buy water, ice and fuel, while in the state of Lara people bathed in the sewers. The head of the infectious disease department at the University Hospital of Caracas, Maria Eugenia Landaeta said that, without access to clean water, the chance of people contracting bacterial infections increased, and that doctors had seen during the blackouts \\"surges in diarrhea, typhoid fever and hepatitis A\\", while non-sterile water and lack of hygiene was contributing to postpartum infections. The University Hospital goes months without dependable water or power supply, and depends on water tanks and power generators.  Telecommunications and banking  An explosion occurred at an unidentified power station in the state of Bolívar on 9 March, causing additional, concurrent outages that disabled 96% of Venezuela's telecommunications infrastructure. With most of telecommunications unavailable, both access to news in Venezuelan and reports on the situation abroad were significantly reduced. Shortages of the Venezuelan bolívar have been aggravated by the blackout. During the first days of the blackout the use of payment cards was not possible, as electricity and internet were not available, and some banks were closed. This problem, with the scarcity of cash, pushed some shops to accept only foreign currency, mostly the US dollar. The need to use hard currency frequently led to the US dollar becoming dominant for transactions whilst banking was unavailable, overriding fears of the Maduro government's loose currency controls theoretically banning foreign currency, which supposedly accelerated the process of the popular currency defaulting to US dollars. After the blackout ended, many shops and other transactions kept prices in dollars, with people publicly using and talking about the spending; about 30% of all transactions in Venezuela were being done in dollars at the time.  Hospital conditions and deaths  As of 13 March, there have been at least 43 reported deaths. At least 26 were as a direct result of a prolonged loss of electricity, though doctor Julio Castro clarified that this was based on the records of 40 primary medical centers, and the number is certainly higher. Withholding his name for fear of government reprisals, The New York Times cited a \\"top medical official\\" who said there were 47 deaths in the main hospital in Maracaibo, half of which he attributed to the blackout. The Coalition of Organizations for the Right to Health and Life (Codevida) announced that 15 patients on renal dialysis died because these services were unavailable. El Pitazo reported that six deaths were registered in the hospital of Acarigua-Araure, in Portuguesa, two of which were direct results of blackout. The hospital was not able to work at full capacity because of fuel shortages. Several patients with gunshot wounds – who could have received treatment – had amputations instead, for concern of \\"fatal complications if the blackout continued\\". Efecto Cocuyo reported that an 86-year-old man fell and died after fracturing his skull in Lara. Patients were robbed on two floors of a hospital that had lighting only in the emergency room from a generator when an armed group gained access to the hospital. With no light, pregnant women in another hospital had to be sent outside. The government denied any deaths caused by the blackout; the health minister said that reports linking deaths to the blackout were false.  Infrastructure and industry  The blackout caused the Caracas Metro to shut down and public transportation to come to a standstill; the lack of transportation affected the ability of personnel to get to their jobs, for example, in the medical industry. Restarting a power grid requires technical expertise that may no longer be present in Venezuela, and requires planning to balance and \\"handle the power surges and fluctuations involved in bringing power back online\\". Since the original outage, there have been ongoing electrical substation explosions, causing further outages, including one in southeastern Caracas, and a chain of explosions at substations in Maracaibo. According to Conindustria, the industrial sector lost about $220 million during March due to the blackouts. The blackout damaged elements of petroleum delivery, operations were disrupted, and some damaged installations cannot be brought back online quickly; Venezuela's long-term oil production capacity could be affected. Ali Moshiri, who oversaw Chevron operations in Venezuela, said he had warned the government for years that the oil fields needed independent power supplies, but his advice had not been heeded; he said, \\"All of the oil field production is tied into the public grid and if the public grid goes down, those fields get shut in.\\" The International Energy Agency says that because of the economic situation in Venezuela, and problems with the electricity supply, the entire Venezuelan industry is at risk of collapsing. Venezuela was once one of the three top producers of OPEC crude oil; ten years ago, it produced over 3 million barrels per day (BPD), and in February 2018, 2 million BPD. Production \\"has been declining for years due to economic collapse\\"; in March, Venezuela lost another 150,000 barrels per day in production. An oil expert told France 24 that production completely ceased at one point during the blackouts. The lack of power caused most of Venezuela's oil rigs to be shut down, and for a short time, cut the country's production in half. Unnamed sources told Bloomberg that, because of the power outages, output had dipped as low as 600,000 BPD, although Bloomberg says that production averaged 890,000 BPD for the month of March, and Venezuela told OPEC it produced 960,000 BPD. Wills Rangel, a former director of PDVSA, said the Orinoco Belt has not yet recovered from the blackouts; cleaning or repairing pipes that clogged while the heating system that helps the heavy crude move through pipelines was down could take months. Four upgraders—\\"facilities that convert the extra-heavy oil to more commercial blends\\"—require power and have not resumed production as of 5 April 2019, as the power grid has not been stabilized. (By April, Venezuela's exports were steady at a million barrels daily, \\"partially due to inventory drains\\".) Five days without power \\"wiped out what little was left of Venezuela's heavy industry\\" in steel, aluminum and iron, according to The New York Times. Because of the blackout, equipment used to make aluminum at the state-run Venalum, a subsidiary of Corporación Venezolana de Guayana, was damaged and the entire industry shut down. Venezuela's largest steelmaker SIDOR ceased operating permanently after the blackout. Its production had been gradually decreasing since the company was nationalized in 2008 by Hugo Chávez. A former director said that Chávez had \\"received it as a productive and solvent company; but management coming from the military world, unaware of 'steel manufacturing' activity, together with the 'absence of strategic planning and investments, led to a sustained fall in production'.\\" The Alcasa aluminum plant and at least three other iron smelters also shut down. Many of the heavy industry plants had been operating at low capacity because of poor management, with laborers reporting to work because free meals were offered.  Education  Classes in primary schools, high schools and universities were suspended.  Looting  During the night of 9 March and the early morning of 10 March, there was looting at Avenida San Martín in Caracas; locals tried to drive away the looters. Later that night, tanks of the Bolivarian National Police (PNB) traveled through the area without stopping the attempted looting. At 1:30 in the morning, two tanks arrived in the area and fired tear gas bombs at the looters then remained to guard the area. In the early hours, people were looting a supermarket in La Florida, mostly taking liquor and personal hygiene items. A worker at the store said that they found leftover candles, which were presumably used to find entrance to the building. On 10 March, another group tried to loot the supermarket at the La Pirámide shopping center in Baruta Municipality. National Police officers arrested at least 50 people. According to Fedecámaras, in only two days, more than 350 stores were looted in the state of Zulia, and The New York Times said 523 stores were looted during the week in Maracaibo. Authorities either responded late or ignored the looting in many cases, and withdrew from most places except one area in the west of Maracaibo, where around 400 people tried to loot until soldiers of the Venezuelan National Guard (GNB) arrived. Hundreds of buildings were looted in the city, not only because of a lack of electricity but also a lack of supply of gasoline and drinking water; 70% of the Delicias Norte shopping center was looted, 30 stores in Centro Sambil were looted, and the Curva de Molina sector was completely destroyed. At a bakery in the center of the city a group of people threw a tear gas bomb before looting. Businesses in Barcelona, Anzoátegui were looted on 11 March and 29 people were arrested.  Power rationing  On 31 March, Maduro announced a 30-day plan to ration power. The president of Venezuela's Electrical and Mechanical Engineering Association said the power grid was \\" barely generating between 5,500 and 6,000 megawatts, when it has the capacity to generate 34,000 megawatts\\". Maduro's administration announced that the workday would be shortened to 2:00 pm, that schools would remain closed, and that access to water would be a priority. On 5 April, Corpoelec published a power rationing schedule, indicating that Caracas and part of Miranda state would not be rationed, and rationing would be implemented in five three-hour blocks for at least 30 days. The governor Omar Prieto announced on 9 April that the electricity rationing in the Zulia state would last up to 12 hours per day.  Investigation and arrests  The blackout came in the midst of the 2019 Venezuelan presidential crisis, that started when the National Assembly declared that Nicolás Maduro's 2018 reelection was invalid and the body declared its president, Juan Guaidó, to be acting president of the nation. Maduro's Prosecutor General Tarek William Saab announced an investigation of Guaidó for sabotage of the power grid, alleging he was an \\"intellectual author\\" of the \\"attack\\". Maduro called on the colectivos, saying, \\"The time has come for active resistance\\". US State Department special envoy to Venezuela Elliot Abrams labeled this a \\"breakdown in law and order\\", and said, \\"That's calling for armed gangs to take over the streets (...) Perhaps it is a sign of Maduro's lack of confidence in his own security forces.\\" The United States withdrew all embassy personnel from Venezuela. National Assembly deputy Juan Andrés Mejía announced that the legislature had communicated with and sought assistance from Brazil, Colombia, Germany, Spain, the United States and several Caribbean island countries, and asked that OLADE (Latin American Organization for Energy) send a commission to investigate the cause. Maduro said he would ask Russia, China, Iran and Cuba for help in investigating the cyberattack on the power grid, and that two people had been arrested in connection with the attack. Between the evening of 11 March and the morning of 12 March, Bolivarian Intelligence Service agents raided the Caracas residence of journalist , arrested him, and detained him at El Helicoide, accusing him of instigating the blackout. He was released after a hearing, and was charged with \\"instigation to commit a crime\\", was obligated to appear before the courts every eight days, and was prohibited from leaving the country, making declarations to the media or participating in public demonstrations. Roberto Marrero, Guaidó's chief of staff, was arrested by SEBIN during a raid on his home in the early morning hours of 21 March. He was accused of terrorism and involvement in the blackout. During the 2019 Venezuelan presidential crisis, the US had repeatedly warned Maduro not to go after Guaidó; Haaretz reported that the arrest of Guaidó's number-two person was a test of the US. A risk consultant for London's IHS Markit, Diego Moya-Ocampos, said to Bloomberg that \\"the regime is testing the international community and its repeated warnings against laying a hand on Maduro's rival [Guaidó] ... if they can’t touch him, they'll go after those close to him.\\" Also available online with a subscription. Nicholas Watson of Teneo Intelligence told The Wall Street Journal that \\"Marrero's arrest looks like a desperate attempt to break Guaidó's momentum .. The weakness in the regime's position is visible in the fact that arresting Guaidó himself would be seen as a step too far.\\" Sequels Second Two weeks after power was restored from the 7 March blackout, Venezuela was still enduring ongoing power outages; on 25 March, another widespread blackout occurred. The Guardian reported that half the country was affected, and other media sources said 14 to 16 of Venezuela's 23 states were without power. The Caracas Metro shut down, shops closed early to avoid looting, private and government workers were sent home, and 91% of telecommunications were down. Oil exports in Puerto José were halted due to lack of electricity. The BBC reported that Information Minister Jorge Rodríguez \\"had gone on state TV earlier to repeat the now-familiar assertion that opposition sabotage rather than a lack of maintenance had caused the afternoon blackout, saying hackers had attacked computers at the country's main hydroelectric dam.\\" Maduro later claimed that the blackout was caused by a rifle, \\"probably by a sniper hired by the opposition\\", causing ridicule from Venezuelans. Guaidó said, \\"despite the persecution and intimidation, there are honest people in Corpoelec\\" who inform us about the cause of the outage, which he said was an electrical fault in the San Jerónimo – La Horqueta – La Arenosa line that caused an overload in the substations. Rodríguez stated that most of the service was reestablished in record time; power was restored in the evening but went out again during the night. As the blackout continued, businesses were closed for three days, and school and universities were cancelled. In the hospitals monitored by the group Physicians for Health (Medicos por la Salud), four patients died because of the blackout. Three were elderly women in Caracas and Maracay, who could not be moved in time to an emergency room because elevators were not working due to the power outage, and one was an elderly man who died in San Cristóbal. Of the hospitals that were monitored, 71% were without water, and 53% had power from generators. Most cities had recovered from the blackout by 28 March, and oil exports in Puerto José were restarted. End of March–Early April Intermittent service continued after the first two widespread blackouts. Another blackout started in the evening of 29 March. A fourth blackout occurred on 30 March, at the same time in the evening (7:10 pm local time) as the third, affecting at least 20 states. Classes in schools and universities restarted on 3 April. On 9 April, power was again out in parts of Caracas and in more than 20 states of the country; this blackout occurred even after a rationing plan was put in place and at places and times where and when the plan called for power to be on. About 90% of the country’s telecommunications infrastructure went offline.  July  Another major national blackout occurred on the evening of 22 July. Nineteen states were affected. NetBlocks measurements, indicate that only 6% of the country telecommunications remained active. Non-stop state TV transmissions were off the air. Subway transportation was also affected on rush hour traffic. Work and schools were suspended the following day. Maduro's administration reiterated the \\"electromagnetic attack\\" allegations as the cause of the blackout. This blackout happened on the eve of an expected public assembly by Juan Guaidó. \\"They tried to hide the tragedy by rationing supplies across the country, but their failure is evident: they destroyed the system and they don’t have answers,\\" said Guaidó during the blackout. Power returned to Caracas the following day. According to the new energy minister, Freddy Brito, power had returned to five of the states on 23 July.  Reactions  The National Assembly declared a state of emergency as an answer to the nationwide blackout. The Lima Group held Maduro entirely responsible for the outage. Declaring that the Group stands in solidarity with \\"the Venezuelan people [who] have been suffering for years\\", the Group issued a statement saying the \\"situation only confirms the existence and magnitude of the humanitarian crisis that the Maduro regime refuses to recognize.\\" The statement said, \\"Only a legitimate government that emerged from free and democratic elections can carry out the reconstruction of the institutions, infrastructure and economy of the country that Venezuelans need to recover their dignity, the exercise of civic freedoms and the respect of their human rights.\\" China offered to help restore the electrical system. A spokesperson for the Chinese Foreign Ministry said they hoped the cause could be found quickly; without further detail, he said that China had received reports that the power grid had gone down due to a hacking attack and that \\"China is willing to provide help and technical support to restore Venezuela’s power grid.\\" Russian Foreign Ministry Spokeswoman Maria Zakharova said that Russia agrees with Maduro that Western sabotage caused the power outage in Venezuela. She alleged that \\"it was an attempt to remotely influence control systems at major electrical substations where Canadian-made equipment is installed\\". President of Bolivia Evo Morales labeled the outage \\"a cowardly act of terror\\" and rejected what he called the continuous meddling of the US in Venezuela's affairs. President of Cuba Miguel Díaz-Canel condemned the \\"aggression against Venezuela\\" and labeled the sabotage a \\"terrorist attack\\". US special envoy for Venezuela, Elliott Abrams, denied any US responsibility, saying, \\"This is a multiyear decline in Venezuela. The situation there, due to the mismanagement, the economic policies and the sheer corruption of this regime, are the cause of those problems.\\" During the second blackout, on 26 March Guaidó said the \\"blackout shows that the dictator is incapable of finding a solution to the crisis\\". He criticized that after government officials claimed that the cause of the blackout was a cyberattack, they changed the narrative to claim it was produced by \\"sabotage\\", stressing that the electric facilities are heavily militarized. Following the fourth blackout, Guaidó said that he will enlist help from the Japanese government to address the blackouts, and that Japan's many electricity-related companies were prepared to invest in Venezuela to help improve the power situation. Chavista deputy Eduardo Labrador, representing the Maduro government PSUV party in Zulia state, asked in mid-March that Motta Domínguez, in office since 2015, be dismissed as head of Corpoelec. On 1 April, Motta Domínguez was fired and replaced by a 65-year-old electrical engineer, Igor Gavidia León. In May, Gavidia León was replaced with engineer Freddy Brito.  Protests  Guaidó \\"took to the streets\\" to question Maduro's governance during the first two days of the blackout. According to The New York Times, \\"Maduro did not address the nation and his public silence has fed the tension gripping Caracas\\". Protests against Maduro in Caracas and other cities were called for 9 March, and went on despite the closure of the Caracas Metro and the lack of social media. The rally headed by Guaidó, took place near the presidential palace in Miraflores; The Washington Post labeled the manifestation as \\"unusual\\" as it was held in a sector usually associated with Maduro supporters. Heavy police presence blocked the streets with anti-riot shields. During the second nationwide blackout, Guaidó summoned new protests that would precede Operation Freedom (), a decisive massive rally through Caracas. According to Guaidó, the goal of the protests is to increase political pressure, but rehearsals are needed as the operation cannot be organized \\"from one day to the next\\". After Maduro's government talked about a cybernetic and electromagnetic attack, and about a sniper, Guaidó asked what would be the next version. Thousands of Venezuelans participated in a rally on Saturday, 30 March, against the recurring blackouts. Guaidó toured around Miranda state and Caracas giving several speeches. A rival pro-Maduro march was held the same day to protest against \\"imperialism\\" and in \\"defense of liberty\\". Anti-riot police used tear gas against several opposition groups in areas where the Maduro supporters were active. Cacerolazos were reported in Caracas after blackouts resumed on Saturday night. The next day, protests against the lack of electricity and water occurred in Caracas and other cities. Some of the protests occurred close to the presidential palace. Maduro called again on the colectivos, asking them \\"to defend the peace of every barrio, of every block\\". Videos circulated on social media showing colectivos threatening protesters and shooting in the streets; two protestors were shot. On Sunday night, police fired at protesters after they set burning barricades.  Public opinion  According to a March poll by Meganálisis, 84.3% of Venezuelans reject the electrical sabotage theory. A poll by Hercon Consultores of 1,000 voters surveyed between 26 March and 4 April 2019 found similar – that 87.5% of Venezuelans reject the theory.

She spent the majority of her career as a professor of radiology at Temple University. Early life Mary Blakely was born on August 12, 1922 in Binghamton, New York, to Stuart Banyar Blakely and Miriam Brothers Blakely. After graduating from Bryn Mawr College and finishing first in her class, she went on to study medicine at Columbia University College of Physicians and Surgeons, again finishing first in her class in 1948. Her father, a physician himself, had wanted his daughter to become a nurse rather than a doctor, but Mary persisted with her choice of a medical career with her mother's encouragement. Soon after graduating M.D., Blakely married George R. Fisher III, a classmate from medical school. Career Fisher worked as an intern at Boston's Massachusetts General Hospital and completed her residency in radiology at New York City's Presbyterian Hospital. She then spent a year as a fellow with Groover, Christie & Merritt Radiology, a private radiology practice located in Washington, D.C. Her first position as a fully qualified radiologist was at the Veterans Administration Hospital in Philadelphia, where she worked for eight years before moving to Philadelphia General Hospital for 15 years. In 1975, when Philadelphia General Hospital closed, one of her former residents who was by now working as head of diagnosis at Temple University recruited her to Temple. She remained at Temple University as a professor of radiology until her retirement in 2003.

Legends of Scottish saints : readings, hymns and prayers for the commemorations of Scottish saints in the Aberdeen Breviary (Four Courts Press: Dublin). This omission raises doubts regarding Lesmo and claims for his Sainthood. A Breviary is a compendium of all the necessary liturgical texts for Divine Office. In the early sixteenth century, Bishop Elphinstone of Aberdeen at the request of James IV of Scotland, set out to provide a new Scottish Breviary. A project that was designed to exhibit the uniqueness of the Dioceses in Scotland. The existing Breviary was known as the Sarum Breviary. Elphinstone was assisted in this endeavour by a group of his closest Canons and advisors. Members of this group included Hector Boece (Principal. Of King’s College, Old Aberdeen) and Canon Alexander Galloway the Royal Notary and Diocesan Clerk for Diocese of Aberdeen. They searched across Scotland for evidence for Scottish Saints. The Breviary was the first published book by the Edinburgh publisher Chepman & Myllar in 1507. The book was known as the Breviarium Aberdonense. The Project was not entirely successful as few copies of the Breviary were sold before the Scottish Reformation of 1559/1560.

In 1871, a private Scottish Episcopal Church chapel was dedicated to Lesmo by Bishop Thomas Suther, Bishop of Diocese of Aberdeen and Orkney. The chapel was part of a grand building scheme by William Cunliffe Brooks on his new estate. The chapel has a fine stained-glass window commemorating Lesmo. The exact date is unknown. It may have been made by Clayton and Bell. Lesmo stands in front of what looks like the South side of the church. Below is the aphorism, \\"LUX IN EREMO\\"; translated as \\"Light in the Wilderness\\". It has been suggested that \\"LUX IN EREMO\\", might be code for \\"LUX IN ER(S)MO\\". A second text along the bottom of the window reads “VIXIT AD 731 COLITUR 9 DEC” “He lived in AD731 – Commemorate him on the 9th. December”. Almost certainly the face of St Lesmo in this panel is based on a photograph or cartoon of Cunliffe Brooks. It is a common practice for a donor to incorporate something of their person in a stained-glass window. Cunliffe Brooks also used a strong pictorial representation in a stained-glass insertion in his house. In this a conductor -modelled on him – is seen with four musicians. The designer of the window gave Lesmo a staff with a scallop shell on his left shoulder suggesting a pilgrim saint. The scallop shell referring to Saint James who is the patron saint of pilgrims and of the Camino de Santiago. It is unknown where the stained-glass was originally located as its current position, in the north wall, was the location of the original entrance into the chapel. Looking at the Lesmo window from the outside, the lintel contains an inscription “VENITE ADOREMUS” - “Come Ye, Let us Adore”. This phrase is part of the well-known traditional carol, O Come All Ye Faithful – “Adeste Fideles”. 294x294px Lesmo as a Saint It is claimed that he \\"ministered\\" to travellers on the Firmounth path. The Firmounth is one of several ancient roads or paths that allowed travellers from the south of Scotland to access Deeside. For details of the various paths see, Haldane, A. R. B. 2008. The drove roads of Scotland (Birlinn: Edinburgh) If there had been a \\"holy hermit\\" in the eighth century, it is likely that places would have been named after him. There are no examples of the name \\"Lesmo\\" in Aberdeenshire. There are two occurrences of a place name containing \\"Les\\" in Aberdeenshire: Mains of Lesmoir - Lat 57,20.6, Long 2,52.3; Milton of Lesmore - Lat 57,20.6, Long 2,53.3. In 1900 a forester in Glen Tanar build a substantial house in Aboyne and named it \\"St Lesmo's Tower\\". This house served as a rectory for the Scottish Episcopal Church, St Thomas, in Aboyne for some time. See, https://online.aberdeenshire.gov.uk/smrpub/master/detail.aspx?Authority=ASH&refno;=NO59NW0092 There are some claims for a Hermit’s Cave or Hermit’s Well in Glen Tanar. A Hermit’s Well was recorded near Porphyry Bridge on a 1955 UK Ordnance Survey map. This location, near the Water of Tanar, is about 4 kms. to the SW of St Lesmo’s Chapel and Glen Tanar House. This site is not marked on the latest Ordnance Survey map. 425x425px The exact location of this well is unknown. There is a Monk's Well marked on some maps adjacent to the Firmounth Road. It is probable that Monk's Well might have been applied to this spring by William Cunliffe Brooks. The Name Lesmo Scots Gaelic gives no clues to the possible derivation of the name \\"Lesmo\\". The authoritative source of Celtic place-names in Scottish Gaelic is; \\"Watson, William J. 2002. The History of the Celtic place-names of Scotland (Birlinn: Edinburgh)\\". \\"Lesmo\\" has no explanation. Reversing some of the letters of the name might provide a possibility. For example, there is evidence for an E l m o known as ELMO or Erasmus in Fife. The place-name Lesmahagow refers to a community near Lanark. No connection between Lesmahagow, Erasmus, Elmo or Lesmo is found in this part of Scotland. Scottish Gaelic: Lios MoChuda) St. Lesmo's Chapel in Glen Tanar In the early 1600s a family named Garden, acquired property in Glen Tanar. In c.1639 they took up residence in what was called the House of Braeloine. In 1869 Sir William Cunliffe Brooks became tenant of the Glen Tanar estate. Cunliffe-Brooks insisted in calling the glen Tana. He claimed the origins of the place-name came from the Scots Gaelic \\"tana\\" - narrow. Giving the English \\"narrow glen\\". See McConnochie, Alexander Inkson. 1895. Deeside (Smith: Aberdeen), p . 86Braeloine House was in ruins and Cunliffe Brooks undertook an extensive building programme. He built a chapel from the ruined walls of the old Braeloine House, incorporating into it, as the entrance, a yett or arched iron gateway. See, Dictionary of Scottish Architects http://www.scottisharchitects.org.uk/building_full.php?id=210023 William Cunliffe Brooks, Vanity Fair, 1879-08-02 The chapel was built with a thatched roof and stained-glass windows. The spaces between the stones of the walls are dotted with small pebbles. A technique called locally cherry-cocking. In the chapel, the rafters were whole trees minus the bark; and the joists were twisted branches of locally grown Scotch Fir (Pinus sylvestris). The pulpit and seats were in the same style, coated with stainless varnish. The ceiling was emblazoned with gilded stars with convex centres of silvered glass. The altar piece was covered with rich purple and surmounted by an oil painting of the Virgin and Child. The altar steps were of local granite. At a later stage, deer skulls with antlers were hung from the roof with the year they had been shot and the initials of the marksman imprinted on them. An organ was placed at the west end of the Chapel. Outside a bell was hung which was cast to order and bears the inscription \\"St Lesmo\\". The Chapel was consecrated on 15 November 1871. 527x527px 443x443px The Bishop, at the consecration said, \\"….. we dedicate and consecrate it as a chapel to the sacred name of God, to His service and worship … and in pious memory of the holy hermit St. Lesmo ….\\" In 1871 the Marquess of Huntly owned the ground on which the chapel was built. However, in 1872 this ground was feued to the Bishop of Aberdeen and Orkney and his successors as Trustees of the Scottish Episcopal Church solely for use as an interdenominational private chapel. The chapel is used for private weddings. The figure to the right marks the location of the \\"St. Lesmo\\" stained-glass window. [*] The Status of St. Lesmo The lack of evidence for a saint called Lesmo does not mean that there is no oral history. Lesmo is recorded in many authors in guide books and descriptions of the Glen Tanar Estate. https://www.glentanar.co.uk/ The status of sainthood is generally a matter for the Western Christian Church. The Catholic Church does not officially recognise him. He has not been awarded a Saint’s Day. The Church of Scotland and other Reformed Churches do not recognise the beatification or canonisation of individuals. The Scottish Episcopal Church allows a dedication to an individual, for example to a Church, if there is community support. It is probable that during the eight century, many anchorite hermits would have been found along the River Dee, Aberdeenshire. A likely location to the west of the Cairn O’Mount path would be the Firmounth path. Many heritage paths cross the Mounth in the NE of Scotland. See http://www.heritagepaths.co.uk/pathdetails.php?path=126A hermit or acolyte of one of the early Christian evangelists, e.g. St Ternan (Banchory) , or St Erchard (Kincardine O’Neil) may have lived on or near the Firmounth path. A \\"Lesmo\\" could have been such a hermit. St. Lesmo lives on the dedication made by William Cunliffe Brooks with the name of his chapel and in the stained- glass window.

Hayes House, is a single-family home located at 303 North Kalamazoo Street in Marshall, Michigan. It was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1972. It is often cited as one of the finest examples of Greek Revival architecture in Michigan. History Dr. Andrew L. Hayes arrived in Marshall from New Hampshire in 1831, the young community's first doctor. He purchased land, built a shanty, and planted some crops. He built a more substantial log cabin, then brought his family to join him. Hayes prospered, and in 1836 purchased four adjacent lots on which to construct a house. He completed a portion of the new home in 1837, and his family moved in while the remainder of the house was completed in 1838. The Hayes family lived in the house for over thirty years, during which time it became one of the social centers of the community. A large conservatory was added in 1877. The house has gone through a number of subsequent owners, many of them prominent members of the Marshall community. It became known as \\"Stonehall\\" around the beginning of the 20th century. It was also used as a home and day school for girls, some time between 1910 and 1924. Description Stonehall is a two-story sandstone Greek Revival house, with a basement and a third-floor ballroom. The house features a prominent a portico containing five slender, unfluted Doric columns, a circular window in its tympanum, and white painted wood trim. Four tall windows face the portico.

It has large, robust, hard and leathery leaves, with a white woolly hairy, nontransparent underside, while the felty hairs on the top are lost with age. Only at a few occasions, flowers have been observed, in June, October and December, always after a fire. The flower heads sit individually at the at tip of white-woolly scapes, with 14–16 purplish pink to white ray florets surrounding a yellow disc. M. robusta is an endemic species that is restricted to rocky mountain slopes in the Western Cape province of South Africa.  Taxonomy  This species of fire daisy was described based on a specimen collected by Elsie Elizabeth Esterhuysen in 1973 in the Jonkershoek Mountains near Stellenbosch at an altitude of about . It was first recognised as a separate taxon by Ulricke Zinnecker-Wiegand in 2011, who regarded it a subspecies and named it M. hirsuta subsp. robusta. In 2012, John Manning and Peter Goldblatt raised it to the rank of species making the combination M. robusta.  Description  aged leavesMairia robusta is a perennial, herbaceous plant of up to high. Its leaves are all in a rosettes at the base. The leaf blade is narrowly to broadly inverted egg-shaped or narrowly to broadly ellipse-shaped, long and 1–3 cm (0.6–1.2 in) wide, narrowed at its foot into a broad petiole-like base, with a blunt or pointy tip, a wavy toothed margin in the upper half, or sometimes almost entire with a few peg-like teeth. The upper surface is initially woolly, sometimes white- woolly, but the hairs are lost with age. The lower surface has two layers of hairs, a dense, persistent, soft, white or pinkish, cobweb-like layer that is overlaid by longer woolly hairs. The lower leaf surface is not visible through the layers of hairs. In each rosette, there is mostly just one, unbranched flower stalk of up to about , with the same indumentum as the leaf lower surface, with several line-shaped to triangularly line-shaped bracts of up to 4 cm (1.8 in) long, decreasing in size upwards, with a single flower head at its tip. The bracts that jointly surround the florets in the same head form a broadly bell-shaped involucre of about 3 cm (1.4 in) in diameter. The line- shaped bracts have the same indumentum as the underside of the leaves, except for the (eventually) hairless base of the inner bracts. They are arranged in five to six whorls, each 11–17 mm (0.45–0.67 in) long and -1 mm (0.03–0.06 in) wide, with purplish, pointed or stretched tips. The involucre envelops the base of fourteen to sixteen bright purplish pink, pink or white, female ray florets have a strap of about long, with a tube of about cm (0.2 in) long that carries glandular hairs. The style of the ray florets is about cm (0.2 in) long and the two line-shaped branches in which it splits are long. In this species, staminodes in the ray florets are absent. The ray florets encircle many yellow disc florets. The lower part of the disc florets consist of a tube of long, set with glandular hairs, the five lobes at the top are about long. The disc florets contain both inferior ovaries topped by a forked style and five fertile anthers that form a tube around the style shaft. These anthers are about long, and have triangular appendages at their tip of about long. The style of the disc florets is about long and the two line-shaped branches in which it splits are long and have a delta-shaped appendage at both tips. Surrounding the base of the corollas of both ray and disc florets are two whorls of white to straw-coloured pappus bristles. The outer whorl consists free barbed bristles of long, alternating with the pappus of the inner whorl. The inner whorl consists of feathery bristles of long, with or without barbs and fused at their base in a ring. The pappus extends beyond the disc floret tubes. The eventually brown, dry, one-seeded, indehiscent fruits called cypsellae are cylindrical to spindle-shaped, rarely egg-shaped in outline, about 3–4 mm (0.14–0.18 in) long and wide, with four or five prominently raised, mostly dark brown ribs. The cypselae of both ray and disc florets are covered with many shiny yellowish glands. They are also covered in dense, silky twin hairs of about long, which are cleft deeply and have two almost equally long branches. The seed skin has no further adornment.  Differences with  M. robusta can be distinguished from M. hirsuta by its large, robust, hard and leathery leaves, with a white woolly hairy, nontransparent underside.  Distribution, ecology and conservation  M. robusta can be found from Bainskloof Pass in the north, through Stellenbosch Mountain and the Hottentots Holland Mountains, to the coast near the Kogelberg in the south. It grows on the upper rocky slopes near the summit in a fynbos vegetation. Although the distribution range of this species is restricted to about , it occurs in well- protected mountains, and it is therefore considered a species of least concern.

Sharp sand (as used in the building industry) is not suitable for such use. Many homeowners with children build sandpits in their backyards because, unlike most playground equipment, they can be easily and cheaply constructed. Children play in a communal sandbox History German sand gardens were the first organization of children's play in public spaces. The German \\"sand gardens\\" were an 1850 offshoot of Friedrich Froebel's work on kindergartens. Sand gardens were introduced to America by Marie Elizabeth Zakrzewska, starting in her home city of Boston. Inspired by the German sand gardens she observed while visiting Berlin in the summer of 1885. Joseph Lee is considered the \\"founder of the playground movement. Physical description The \\"pit\\" or \\"box\\" itself is simply a container for storing the sand so that it does not spread outward across lawns or other surrounding surfaces. Boxes of various shapes are often constructed from planks, logs, or other large wooden frames that allow children easy access to the sand and also provide a convenient place to sit. Small sandpits are also available commercially. These are usually made from plastic or wood and are often shaped like an animal or other objects familiar to children. They sometimes also have lids to cover the sand when not in use, so that passing animals cannot contaminate the sand by urinating or defecating in it. Having lids also prevents the sand in outdoor sandpits from getting wet when it rains, although some dampness is often desirable as it helps the sand hold together. Prefabricated sandpits may also be used indoors, especially in day care facilities. Materials other than sand are also often used, such as oatmeal, which are necessarily non-toxic and light enough to easily vacuum up. Sandpits can have a solid bottom or they can be built directly onto the soil. The latter allows free drainage (which is useful if the top is open) but can lead to contamination of the sand with soil if the children dig down to the ground. The sand gets dirty over time and is eventually replaced. Many schools and playgrounds in North America have replaced sand around play structures with a wood chip mixture, as it is cheaper.

British military commander Lord Chelmsford had intended to raise a large auxiliary force to support his invasion of Zululand but was opposed by the civilian government of the Colony of Natal, led by its governor Henry Ernest Gascoyne Bulwer, who would have to finance the unit. Bulwer eventually allowed a smaller force (of 2,800 men) to be raised with the stipulation that it not be deployed outside of Natal. This unit was to serve only on a part-time basis, receive no training and fight with the traditional weapons of spear and shield. Following the defeat of the British force during the Battle of Isandlwana the Border Guard was strengthened and equipped with a limited number of firearms. The unit saw action by guarding the border during British raids and defending against Zulu counter-raids. One of the Border Guard commanders was responsible for negotiating the surrender of a number of Zulu chiefs in the border region towards the end of the war.  Origin  The British High Commissioner for Southern Africa Sir Henry Bartle Frere had been attempting to form a confederation of British possessions in Southern Africa. As part of this ambition the annexation of Zululand was planned, this led to the Anglo-Zulu War of 1879. As part of preparations for this war the British military commander Frederic Thesiger (later and more commonly known as Lord Chelmsford) implemented defensive measures in the neighbouring British Colony of Natal. Natal's border with Zululand lay along the Mzinyathi (Buffalo) and Thukela (Tugela) rivers. Natal was split into seven defensive districts of which three directly bordered Zululand. In order to defend this border Chelmsford sought to raise a 6,000-strong auxiliary force. This would supplement the existing Natal Native Contingent (NNC) which was under military control and expected to participate in the forthcoming invasion. The existing Natal volunteer military units were insufficient to ensure defence of the colony as many had been earmarked to form part of the invading force.  Formation  The Natal government would have to pay the costs of any force raised specifically for the defence of the colony. They were unwilling to finance the auxiliary force proposed but did agree to fund a border guard unit of reduced scope. The Natal Border Guard was subsequently raised from 20 December 1878 by a levy on the African men residing in each defensive district. Officers were provided by white volunteers, resident in the border areas. The unit initially numbered some 2,800 men who rotated between active service and reserve duty. Those on reserve were allowed to return home to tend to their crops and livestock, a measure that limited costs by reducing the need for the government to provide food, shelter and clothing. The men initially received no formal training, uniform or weapons and were expected to fight in their traditional tribal style with spears and shields. The units were organised on tribal lines under the leadership of local chiefs. Recruitment was slow; there was little enthusiasm as payments due to the chiefs were delayed and the population was demotivated by the recent implementation of a hut tax. Some units of the Border Guard were still not fully formed by April 1879. Chelmsford commenced his invasion of Zululand in January 1879 and intended that the campaign would be over with the submission of the Zulu people before the rivers fell low enough to permit a Zulu counter invasion of Natal. The Natal Border Guard was formally under the control of the civilian government of the colony but Governor Henry Ernest Gascoyne Bulwer conceded that operational control lay with Chelmsford. At the outset of the war the Border Guard were posted to fixed points at or near fordable points (known locally as drifts) on the border rivers at points where no British or colonial garrison was provided. These posts were typically 300–350 strong. The Border Guard were nominally commanded by the commandants of each defensive district. Due to their deployment and expected duties the unit was also known as the \\"River Guards\\".  Service   First invasion  The British invasion force crossed into Zululand on 11 January 1879 in three columns. At the outset of the war the Border Guard in the Sand Spruit Valley near to Umsinga were under the command of British Colonel Anthony Durnford who was tasked with defending the border at this location. Durnford was soon, however, ordered to move up to the border crossing at Rorke's Drift in support of Chelmsford's no. 3 column. On 22 January he was ordered to bring his men (not including the Border Guard) to the British camp at Isandlwana, within Zululand. Durnford and his men were wiped out in the British defeat at the Battle of Isandlwana later that day. The same day as the battle, the Klip River Border Guard district commandant was told by the leader of the unit stationed downstream from Rorke's Drift that a large Zulu force was massing at the Mangeni Valley to raid into Natal. The district commandant doubted this intelligence which came from a Natal native and was passed on by a farmer acting in a temporary capacity as a stand-in for a Border Guard officer. The district commandant gathered his Border Guard on the Natal side of the river to counter the threat but, after a reconnaissance concluded that the informant had mistaken men of Chelmsford's 3rd Regiment of NNC for Zulu forces. They later assisted the men of the 2nd NNC under Harcourt Mortimer Bengough to cross the river. Bengough's battalion withdrew after learning of the British defeat and together with the Border Guard took steps to defend Natal.  Interim period  Following the defeat at Isandlwana the Border Guard was strengthened with additional levies from the interior regions of Natal. A contingent at Weenen, formed from men from the disbanded 3rd Regiment NNC and the Newcastle Scouts – an African mounted unit numbering some 50 men – was used to support the Border Guard. A number of Zulu-speaking interpreters were posted to the unit on detachment from the Royal Durban Rifles. In April the unit received an issue of obsolete Pattern 1853 Enfield rifled muskets, sufficient to arm one quarter of the men. Some units of the Border Guard were reinvigorated by the receipt of firearms and requested to be able to join British forces on raids into Zululand. Chelmsford was in favour of this but opposition from Bulwer and Frere confined the Border Guard to Natal. By May 1879 the expanded unit numbered some 7,700 men. The Border Guard had acted in support of a British raid into Zululand in March by garrisoning the drifts on a stretch of river. Later in the month a unit was ordered by British Major Twentyman to cross the river and burn some Zulu homesteads but refused to do so, in accordance with their standing orders – the Border Guard did exchange fire with a Zulu force across the river. Twentyman protested to the colonial authorities to relax the restrictions but this was to no avail. In April the Border Guard took possession of a fort – known as Fort Montgomery – at the Middle Drift that had been constructed by the NNC to support a raid in Zulu territory. During this time there were also Border Guard units at Mgonweni Dirft, Kwelbomvu Drift, Shushu, Ngubana Drift and Mpisi Drift. Other Border Guard posts were Fort Lucas and Thring's Post Fort in the sixth defensive district. A fallback position for the Border guard was established at Hullett's Stockade in Kearsney on the northern portion of the Natal coast. A reprisal raid carried out by the Zulu in June at the Middle Drift may have demonstrated the wisdom of Bulwer's original non-antagonistic defensive strategy for the border. A unit of African Amangwani Scouts formed part of the Border Guard reserve until April 1879 when they were brought under military control to augment the cavalry of the second invasion force.  Second invasion  The British second invasion began on 31 May 1879. The Border Guard may have taken possession of Fort Bengough, between Greytown and Helpmekaar, from the 2nd Regiment NNC who took part in the invasion. In July some men of the Border Guard were drafted into an unarmed carrier corps to provide logistical support for the British column. However the men proved less efficient than the previous method of ox wagon transport and the unit was soon disbanded. The Border Guard at the Middle Drift proved unable to effectively confront a Zulu raid there in July. The dispute between Bulwer and Chelmsford over the deployment of the Border Guard came to an end on 15 July 1879 when Garnet Wolseley assumed the role of supreme British civil and military commander in the region. In August 1879 Henry Fynn, who had raised the Border Guard of the Umsinga region, negotiated the surrender of the Zulu chiefs along the Mzinyathi River. The Natal Border Guard was disbanded following the end of the war, there is no record of the date this occurred but the NNC disbanded in September and the related Natal Pioneers in October.

It is connected to Meadowmere Park in Lawrence, Nassau County, New York, which is part of the Five Towns area of southwestern Nassau County. Meadowmere is surrounded by Nassau County, and comprises just four streets and six blocks, bordered on the west by Hook Creek and on the east by Rockaway Boulevard. History JFK overflight at Hook Creek A footbridge across Hook Creek joins Meadowmere with Meadowmere Park, a neighborhood in the village of Lawrence in Nassau County. The spring for the creek originates under the Green Acres Mall. The creek was engineered and emerges on the Queens side in nearby Hook Creek Park before flowing through 300 acres of wetlands to Jamaica Bay, subsequently passing between the two hamlets. The mall was built in 1956 on the northern portion of Curtiss Airfield. Prior to 1956, the mall was once a small airport which operated until 1947. Before that, as part of Roosevelt Field, in May 1927, operating from a hangar at Curtiss Field, Charles Lindbergh used the Roosevelt Field runway for the takeoff of the Spirit of St. Louis on his flight to Paris during his solo transatlantic trip. In 1963, as part of planning the parkways of New York state, Parks Commissioner Robert Moses used eminent domain to seize portions of Hook Creek for a failed extension of the Nassau Expressway. The homes seized were demolished and ultimately the extension was never built. Since then, there have been plans to complete the expressway. In 2007, the city began installing a sanitary sewer system in Warnerville and neighboring Meadowmere because some septic tanks had flooded into Jamaica Bay. Rising sea levels and increased storm surges such as Hurricane Sandy devastated the communities and many homes on the waterfront were lost, with residents living for months out of the volunteer firehouse in Meadowmere Park. Streets there had been raised 3–4 feet but that was not enough for Sandy’s surges, which placed most homes under 5 feet of water. As a result many homes are in the process of being elevated in Meadowmere Park and the wooden bridge will be strengthened and widened to accommodate emergency vehicles. Even in normal weather, the streets in Meadowmere flood with each high tide. Geography Meadowmere Park bridge on Hook Creek Unlike the rest of the borough of Queens, the hamlet has 3 roads that do not conform to Queens street naming convention, simply named 1st, 2nd and 3rd Streets. The Rockaway Boulevard side separates the streets from the Five Towns Shopping Center. One of the main roads of importance in Queens, Rockaway Boulevard, runs through Rosedale to Meadowmere, where traffic come to a halt at Meadowmere's two traffic signals that separate southeast Queens from Lawrence. Meadowmere Park bridge The bridge and hamlet of Meadowmere Park is the only portion of Nassau county that is located west of Queens. It is along the main East-West flight path to the John F. Kennedy International Airport's runway which is approximately away from the Hook Creek Bridge. By 1969, the bridge was in need of repair. In 2016, $2.4 million in grant funding was secured to repair the 110 year old foot bridge and in 2018 the first contract of $243,615 was approved by the Hempstead town board. The bridge will be redesigned to provide emergency access for ambulances in addition to the other narrow meandering road of East Avenue, the only road into the small Island. Meadowmere at Hook Creek Opposition to replacement has since stymied the upgrade, residents wanting the current bridge fixed while Nassau town supervisors say the grants are for replacement and improving vehicular access. Warnerville Warnerville is adjacent to Meadowmere. It is surrounded on three sides by Jamaica Bay just to the southeast of John F. Kennedy Airport and comprises just three streets, bordered by Rockaway Boulevard on the east,  References  External links * Map of Queens neighborhoods * History of Queens County: Jamaica New York: W.W.

After training at the University of Jena in Germany, he returned to Buenos Aires, where he taught and practiced medicine for many years. Wernicke introduced microscopy to Argentinian medicine, and founded the study of parasitology, microbiology, and general pathology in Argentina. He served as President of the Argentine Medical Association from 1894 to 1897, and was president of the Second Latin American Scientific Congress, in Montevideo, Uruguay in 1901. A Festschrift was published in his honor in 1909. Early life Roberto Enrique Martin Wernicke's parents were Robert Heinrich (Roberto Enrique) Wernicke (May 29, 1826, Kelbra - January 24, 1881, Buenos Aires) and Ida Augusta Beltz (or Baltz) von Hagen. Both were from Germany. They married around 1851. Wernicke had several siblings and half-siblings, among them the painter Julia Wernicke (1860-1932). Wernicke's childhood was spent in Baradero about 160 km northwest of the city of Buenos Aires, where his father settled for health reasons and ran a school. Wernicke completed his secondary studies in Buenos Aires. University of Jena In 1872, Roberto Wernicke moved to Germany where he entered the University of Jena, working with William Thierry Preyer. Wernicke graduated in 1876 after publishing a thesis on experimental studies of the physiology of the embryonic heart. Wernicke was one of the first to study the embryonic development of chicken hearts, using sand and water baths to maintain a constant temperature for the developing eggs. A translation of the work was published in the Anales de la Sociedad Científica Argentina (Annals of the Argentine Scientific Society). Career in Buenos Aires In 1878, Roberto Wernicke returned to Buenos Aires. In 1884, he received the degree of Doctor of Medicine, after presenting a thesis sponsored by José Teodoro Baca, on the topic \\"Una primera lección de examen clínico\\" (\\"A first lesson in clinical study\\"). Soon after, he became Assistant Professor of the Chair of General Pathology in the Faculty of Medicine at the University of Buenos Aires. Roberto Wernicke taught in room IX of the Hospital de Clínicas. His younger brother Otto Wernicke also became a doctor at the Hospital. Roberto Wernicke was known for arriving early and being a demanding instructor. In 1884, Wernicke established a Laboratory for Contagious Diseases in Animals. Between 1884 and 1887, Wernicke carried out early experiments in photomicrography. In 1886, the National Department of Hygiene sent him to Rosario to assess the situation created by the presence of cholera in the area. After some difficulties, he was able to impose sanitary criteria and set up a lazaretto outside the city for those who had contracted the disease. In 1888, Wernicke founded the Laboratorio de la Sociedad Rural Argentina (Laboratory of the Argentine Rural Society) with the support of La Rural's president, Estanislao Zeballos. In his laboratory, a group of young medical students, veterinarians and biologists, began to study the new specialty of bacteriology. Wernicke introduced microscopy to Argentinian medicine, along with the study of parasitology, microbiology, and general pathology. He followed closely the work of European scientists such as Louis Pasteur and Robert Koch. In 1889, Wernicke called attention to the dangers of hydatid cysts, a zoonotic disorder caused by Echinococcus granulosus. The parasite can be found in sheep organs, which if eaten by dogs can travel in their faeces to infect humans. Wernicke, who had studied hydatidosis in domestic animals for some years, noted a sharp increase in human cases due to both increased human immigration and the importation of Lincoln sheep which were herded with dogs. Wernicke wrote to the Minister of the Province of Buenos Aires, Manuel Bernardo Gonnet. This led to a project to establish rural and industrial safety codes in 1891, and the passage of National Law 3959 establishing guidelines for the inspection of businesses such as slaughterhouses, meat- packing plants to prevent disease and contamination of food. In 1890, Wernicke was promoted to Professor of General Pathology in the Faculty of Medicine, holding that position until October 1907. His students included Guillermo Seeber, who described the parasite Rhinosporidium seeberi, and Alejandro Posadas, who with Wernicke first described the fungal disease Coccidioidomycosis. Wernicke was a founding member and served two terms as President of the Asociación Médica Argentina (Argentine Medical Association) from 1894-1895 and from 1896-1897. He was vice-president of the First Latin American Scientific Congress held in Buenos Aires on April 11, 1898, where he led the medical sciences section. At the Second Latin American Scientific Congress, held in Montevideo from March 20 to 31, 1901, he served as president of the board as well as being president of the coordinating committee in Argentina and the official delegate of the Argentine government. He also presented a paper on amyloid degeneration. In 1907, Wernicke formally retired from the University, stepping down from the Chair of General Pathology, and the positions of Academician and Counselor of the School of Medicine. In a ceremony on October 30, 1907, the Board of Directors granted him the title of \\"Honorary Professor\\", in recognition of \\"his services to the city, the nation and the profession\\". His students and colleagues published a Libro d'e Oro (Golden Book) as a festschrift in his honor. Wernicke continued to see patients in his private practice. He served as president of the Academia Nacional de Medicina de Buenos Aires from 1912-1913. Roberto Wernicke died in Buenos Aires on October 14, 1922.

Reception  Several scholars, mainly associated with Poland's Institute of National Remembrance, have criticized Dalej jest noc for using unreliable sources, for ignoring the context of Germany's draconian occupation policies and practices, for some authors' alleged personal interests, for selective treatment of witness statements (questioning Polish witnesses' statements, while taking at face value witness statements that were in line with authors' theses), and for presenting rumors and gossip as actual proven facts.Tomasz Domański, \\"Korekta obrazu?

Historian Jacek Borkowicz writes in the Polish newspaper Rzeczpospolita that, using data from the book, he concludes that the actual number of Jewish victims of Poles was much lower, at most 40,000, while around 50,000 and possibly as many as 100,000 Jews were saved by Poles. Jacek Borkowicz, \\"Pogruchotana pamięć o Zagładzie\\" [\\"Mangled Memory of Genocide\\"], Rzeczpospolita: Plus Minus, 17 May 2018. Tomasz Domański writes in Rzeczpospolita that the authors speak of a \\"Polish-German administration\\", whereas there was no Polish administration in German-occupied territories, and that the authors' use of materials is tendentiously selective. He also criticizes the misleading use of the expression \\"Polish Police\\" (the Blue Police was a German-run entity based on conscripted prewar Polish police officers) and the lack of a common definition of \\"county\\". Wraca spor o udzial w Zagladzie Historian Piotr Gontarczyk charges the book with \\"scholarly mystification\\". As an example of gross inaccuracy, Gontarczyk gives the book's description of events in the Bochnia Ghetto in German-occupied Poland. Gontarczyk writes that the book \\"makes the Jewish Ghetto Police disappear, replacing it with Polish police.\\" The Bochnia Ghetto, he says, witnessed \\"scenes out of Dante, with the participation of the Jewish Ghetto Police (Jüdische Ordnungstdienst); there were no Polish police [inside Jewish ghettos], but the book... says the bunkers [in which some Jews hid, hoping to escape deportation to German extermination camps] were searched by Polish police.\\"Piotr Gontarczyk, \\"Między nauką a mistyfikacją, czyli o naturze piśmiennictwa prof.

One of the book's authors, Dagmara Swałtek-Niewińska has replied that Gontarczyk is incorrect, and that the book discusses the Jewish Ghetto Police in numerous places, and she in turn charges Gontarczyk with not having read the book thoroughly and with drawing incorrect conclusions from a cursory reading. Historian writes that the study is based on solid analysis of sources. He notes the naming of perpetrators and co-perpetrators – individuals who took over Jewish property – and participation by the Polish Blue Police, Baudienst, fire brigades, and military guards. He writes that the study is important in deconstructing some political myths and propaganda in Polish history writing, journalism, church pronouncements, and politics. He concludes that the two volumes are \\"solid and reliable scholarship\\".Chrobaczyński, Jacek. \\"Osaczeni, samotni, bezbronni... Refleksje po lekturze książki Dalej jest noc.

Karolina Koprowska, writes that the book focuses on micro-history studies and case- study analysis. She calls it a unique book with both a clear scholarly goal and a political message, taking a clear stance in the ongoing discussion in Poland about Polish-Jewish historical relations. She writes that the book is valuable for its solid methodology, rare and personal focus on micro-history, and demonstration of how significant were varying local characteristics, which resulted in widely different and not fully generalizable circumstances that Jews faced in different parts of occupied Poland. She does note that the book may, however, lack an overarching methodological conclusion and does not attempt a new grand theory of Polish-Jewish wartime history.

Tomasz Roguski's review of the book focuses particularly on the chapter by Jan Grabowski. Roguski writes that the book deals with an interesting topic that needs further research. He commends the authors for pioneering work but criticizes some of its methodology, its use of some primary sources to the neglect of others, its too narrow focus, and its statistical conclusions.Tomasz Roguski, \\"Dalej jest noc. Losy Żydów w wybranych powiatach okupowanej Polski, red. Barbara Engelking i Jan Grabowski\\", Glaukopis, no. 36, pp. 335–356. Adam Kopciowski writes that \\"the study was based on an impressive range of sources. Its authors’ widespread search for sources included many archives in Poland, Israel, the United States, Germany, Ukraine, Belarus and Russia. These include the acts of the German and Polish administration, ... the Polish underground state, the government–in-exile, Jewish self-help organizations, the Polish language press published by the Nazis, the underground press, the acts from the post-war trials in Poland and Germany, as well as the records of Jewish and Polish witnesses. The authors managed to develop an exhaustive picture of a previously under studied stage of the Holocaust of the Polish Jews. They developed an excellent methodology which—it is to be hoped—will be applied to subsequent studies of this type concerning the remaining parts of the General Government.\\" Litigation against editors Dalej jest noc accuses Edward Malinowski, sołtys of the Polish village of Malinowo, of having been responsible for the deaths of dozens of Jews who, during World War II, were in hiding from the Germans.

It is located between Galernaya ulitsa, Novo-Admiralteysky canal and Admiralteysky canal. Official address: St. Petersburg, ul. Galernaya, 58-60. A monument of architecture in the style of classicism.  Construction  The first owner of the estate in the second half of the XVIII century was the Cabinet Secretary of Catherine II Alexander Khrapovitsky. In 1790 the building was bought by the Senator Peter Myatlev. Senator Peter Myatlev A Swiss-Italian architect Luigi Rusca has expanded and rebuilt the house for him in the classical style. It was the first independent work of the future famous master. During the reconstruction, which was carried out in 1792-1796, the complex of the estate was merged with another building, which was located on a neighboring plot — the former house of the architect Savva Chevakinsky. In 1798, for a short time the palace was owned by Prince Platon Zubov, who had purchased it from Myatlev. Quite soon it was acquired from him by the wife of Paul I - Empress Maria Feodorovna.  The palace in the possession of the Counts Bobrinsky  The further history of the palace is connected with the family of Counts Bobrinskys. In the XIX-early XX century, many representatives of this family held high positions in the state hierarchy and at the court, were engaged in scientific and social activities. The Bobrinskys were among the major landowners and property owners of Russia. In 1897, the total value of land, real estate, financial assets of the Bobrinsky family was 17.5 million rubles (several billion rubles in 2019 prices).Минарик Л.П. Экономическая характеристика крупнейших земельных собственников России конца XIX - начала XX в. М, 1971. However, this wealth was jointly owned by the members of the family. Although the personal wealth of quite numerous individual family members could not be compared to the wealth of the richest Russian aristocrats (princely couple of the Yusupovs or Prince S. Abamelek- Lazarev), the Bobrinskys undoubtedly belonged to the most influential Russian families. The proximity of the family to the reigning house, their marriages with representatives of other noble families, the participation in court and public life, along with the accumulated wealth ensured Bobrinskys’ prominent place in the narrow (several dozen families) circle of the supreme Russian aristocracy. The status of the family was reflected in the status of their St. Petersburg home - the Bobrinsky palace. For more than a century, it was one of the centers of social and political life of the capital. Alexey Grigorievich Bobrinsky In 1798, Alexei Grigorievich Bobrinsky, the illegitimate son of Catherine the Great and Grigory Orlov, became the first owner of the estate. In 1796 he was created a Count by his half-brother Emperor Paul I. The estate on Galernaya street was presented to him as a gift by the Empress Maria Feodorovna. Soon after that, having left military service, A. G. Bobrinsky left for his Bogoroditsk manor near Tula where spent almost all his time, only occasionally visiting St. Petersburg. After the death of her husband in 1813, Countess Anna Vladimirovna Bobrinskaya continued to raise children in Bogoroditsk, spending winter in her house in Moscow. In the 1820s, the family settled in the St. Petersburg Palace, which was then expanded and re- decorated. In the 1830s, the Palace hosted multiple receptions, balls, salons, amateur performances, masquerades, and soirees. Alexey Alexeyevich Bobrinsky The eldest son of Alexey Grigorievich, Count Alexey Alexeyevich Bobrinsky and his wife Sophia Alexandrovna Bobrinskaya continued the traditions of the house. The palace was repeatedly visited by Emperor Nicholas I and Empress Alexandra Feodorovna. The salon of the junior Countess Bobrinskaya was frequented by the literati P. A. Vyazemsky, V. Zhukovskysky, the brothers Vielgorskys, as well by the Imperial Chancellor Prince A.M. Gorchakov. Alexander Pushkin, also regularly visited the Palace. In his diary for 1833-35 it is mentioned that he visited Bobrinskys' dinners (in particular during this period – on December 6, 1833 and on February 28, 1834). On January 17, 1834 he was at a ball in the Palace and left the following record: “A ball at the Count Bobrinsky’s - one of the most brilliant”.А. С. Пушкин. Собрание сочинений в 10 томах. М.: ГИХЛ, 1959—1962. Том 7. История Пугачева, Исторические статьи и материалы, Воспоминания и дневники. Count Alexey Alexeyevich Bobrinsky was one of the founders of the joint-stock company for the construction of Russia’s first railway. In 1835, in order to raise additional funds for the company and to convince those who doubted the technical capabilities of the railway, he built a section of the railway in the garden of the palace, on which a trolley loaded with stones was moving. The Count was also one of the first Russian photographers. Portraits of the Count’s family members made by daguerreotype in 1842-43 are among the earliest Russian daguerreotype portraits. Some of them were made in St. Petersburg, and likely in the palace. These daguerreotypes were part of the photo collection of the Counts Bobrinskys, now they are in the collection of the State Hermitage Museum. From 1856 and up until his death in 1868, the Count lived in the estate of Smela near Kiev. Alexander Alexeyevich Bobrinsky The role of the palace as one of the centers of the social life of St. Petersburg was maintained by the next representative of the family Count Alexander Alexeyevich Bobrinsky. He held the position of St. Petersburg Governor in 1861-64, in the years 1869-72 was the provincial leader of the nobility, and since 1858 held various positions at the Imperial court. In the second half of the XIX century, the collection of paintings, weapons and books in the Bobrinsky palace was open to the public. A memorial room of Count G. G. Orlov was created in the palace.Кальницкая Е.Я. Исторические предпосылки и характер зарождения музейной деятельности в памятниках архитектуры Петербурга XVIII века // Известия Российского государственного педагогического университета им. А. И. Герцена. 2008. № 81. С. 182-190. The last owner (since 1903) of the estate from the Bobrinsky family — Count Alexey Alexandrovich Bobrinsky. He was a historian, an archaeologist, and a statesman. Alexey Alexandrovich Bobrinsky In 1905, Count Alexei Alexandrovich Bobrinsky was elected the Chairman of the \\"National Union\\", a political association (which, however, did not last long), the key principles of which were \\"autocracy, consultative Zemsky Sobor, the fight against constitutionalism\\". The Union consisted of about 350 people (representatives of the highest bureaucracy, generals, nobility, including 8 senators, 15 generals, 41 nobility leaderx, 35 representatives of the titled nobility). The meetings of members of the \\"National Union\\" were held at the Bobrinsky palace. One of the members of the Union, V. I. Gurko, wrote: > I recall vividly the meeting of the Union in Galernaya street, in the cozy > mansion of Count A. A. Bobrinsky. In a comparatively small room, covered > with a soft carpet and lined with cabinets filled with countless > archaeological objects obtained from the excavations carried out by the > Count, at an oblong table, with the light of several candelabra softened by > pink shades, the founders of the Union gathered and seriously discussed > issues they could not influence.

Черты и силуэты прошлого: Правительство и общественность > в царствование Николая II в изображении современника. М., 2000. С. 452. After the establishment of the State Duma in the Russian Empire, Count A. A. Bobrinsky made several attempts to become a deputy of the Duma. He managed to become a member of the third Duma in 1907. In 1912, in connection with his appointment to the State Council, he left the Duma. A supporter of the right- wing parties and a monarchist, Count A. A. Bobrinsky has undertaken a number of steps aimed at bringing together conservatives in the State Council and the Duma. During those years, balls and social meetings at the palace gave way to both closed meetings of politicians of the right wing, and to regular political routs, attended by numerous invited guests. For instance, on November 6, 1911 (a few days before hearings in the State Council about the law on transition from one religion to another) the palace hosted a rout, which was attended by more than 100 people (members of the State Council and the State Duma, senior clergymen, scholars etc.). The meeting was devoted to the discussion about the freedom of the Russian Church. The report on the need of the official state recognition of the right not to belong to any religious confession, was delivered by famous Church publicist and lawyer Nikolai Dmitrievich Kuznetsov. According to Kuznetsov, the report caused almost a storm in the right parties and in the Church.Богданова Т. Из академических \\"историй\\": замещение кафедры церковного права в Московской Духовной академии в 1910 году // Вестник церковной истории (Москва). 2007. № 1 (5). С. 31-77. Unlike balls and salons of the XIX century, political discussions of the 1910s in the palace were visited not only by the aristocracy, but also by representatives of other social strata, who in the recent past had almost no chance to be invited as guests to the palaces of the aristocracy. In 1911, a banquet was held at the palace in honor of the election of Count A.A. Bobrinsky the Chairman of the Supervisory Board of the Russian-English Bank. In his speech, the count expressed the hope that by placing capital in Russian industrial enterprises, the British \\"will develop them to the appropriate size and, on the one hand, contributing to the prosperity of both countries, on the other hand, will contribute to the friendly rapprochement of the two great empires\\". With the beginning of the WWI, Count A. A. Bobrinsky allowed using the palace facilities for the infirmary of the red cross. In the revolutionary 1917, a part of the palace was occupied and used as barracks by revolutionary battalions (female and Latvian), while another part of the building continued to be used as an infirmary. After the revolution the banking accounts of the Count were arrested. He had no money for the maintenance of the building. Although the Provisional government, headed by Kerensky, promised to appoint a pension to the Count as to a former member of the State Council, the revolution of October 1917 put an end to these hopes. A. A. Bobrinsky in early 1918 attempted to achieve an agreement with the Bolsheviks about the appointment of a pension and a compensation for the cost of maintaining the infirmary, but with no success.Смирнов А. С. Граф Алексей Александрович Бобринский и новая власть // Проблемы истории, филологии, культуры. 2015. №2. After the events of October 1917, private palaces of Petrograd were under serious threat. In the post-revolutionary chaos and amidst food shortages, rumors (often exaggerated) about the treasures hidden in the palaces of the nobility, as well as about the contents of their wine cellars, fueled the interest of gangs of rioters and robbers. In the summer of 1918, on August 1, several palaces, including the palace of A. A. Bobrinsky on Galernaya street, were nationalized, which saved them from complete looting. After the decree on the nationalization was issued, A. A. Bobrinsky moved to the South of Russia, then to Kiev. He moved to Constantinople in 1920 and to France in 1921, where he lived until death in 1927. The collection of paintings, artefacts and furniture from the palace were distributed among museums.  The palace during the Soviet period  In the 1920s, the building housed a department of the Russian Museum. In 1925, the palace hosted an exhibition \\"Merchant portrait of XVIII-XX centuries\\" with a partial \\"reconstruction\\" of historical and typological interiors. After 1929 the building housed the Central Geographical Museum, created by V. P. Semenov-Tianshansky. The Museum organized thematic exhibitions, visited by tens of thousands of people. All schoolchildren of Leningrad and a lot of foreign tourists passed through the museum. With the departure of Semenov-Tianshansky from the position of the Museum head, the Museum’s decay began. Eventually the Museum was transferred to Leningrad University. At the beginning of 1941, by a decree of Leningrad City Council the Museum was closed downПолян П. М. „Любимое детище\\" В. П. Семенова-Тян- Шанского // Природа, 1989, № 3. С. 83-90. Then the palace became home to the Faculty of geography of Leningrad State University, and from 1960s – to the Institute of Complex Social Research (NIKSI), as well as the psychological faculty of Leningrad State University. No complex restoration of the Palace was carried in the Soviet years, so the premises (including the Palace halls) gradually fell into decay.  The palace today  On December 13, 2001, the Bobrinsky palace was transferred to St. Petersburg State University. In 2003, urgent repair and restoration works began, as in several rooms there was a threat of collapse of the walls. The restoration lasted for about 8 years. The grand opening of the Bobrinsky palace after the restoration took place on August 31, 2011. Currently the Palace is the home of the Faculty of Liberal Arts and Sciences of St. Petersburg State University.  Architecture  The Facade from the yard The estate’s plan is typical for the urban estate of the late XVIII century. The complex is formed by three interconnected buildings, the main house is located in the depth of the plot. In 1846-1850, the palace was partially rebuilt by the architect Garald Andreyevich Bosse. The main facade of the palace overlooks the courtyard, which is surrounded by low-rise wings and a fence with a gate. The wings around the courtyard were built in 1883. The central building of the complex is distinguished by rich decoration of the main and garden facades. Its middle part is marked with a portico decorated with four Ionic columns; the portico unites the first and the second floors. The columns are topped with marble statues standing on the entablature and embodying the seasons. The statues were made by an unknown Italian sculptor in the first half of the XVIII century. Between the second and the third floors there is a strongly protruding cornice. The main entrance to the palace is from the Galernaya street. The entrance to the yard is decorated with monumental gates with busts on the pylons. Only the central risalit of the building is visible through the narrow openings of the entrance gate. The garden façade facing the Admiralteysky canal is enlivened with rounded protruding sides and a Corinthian order portico. The garden is separated from the embankments by a stone rustic fence (along the embankment of the Novo- Admiralteysky canal) and a through lattice (along the Admiralteysky canal, early XIX century). At the junction of the fences at the southern end of the garden, opposite the Khrapovitsky bridge, there is a small two-storey pavilion (its author is also Luigi Ruska), crowned with a low dome. Its facades along the perimeter are decorated with arched windows. The design of the pavilion is complemented by balconies on the second floor and a descent into the garden from the inside. The stone fence is decorated with copies of ancient busts (the end of the XVIII century, recreated in the 1970s). Crimson drawing room  Interiors  The interior of the palace was rebuilt in 1822-1825 by the architect Andrey Alekseevich Mikhailov the 2nd. He created a suite of rooms on the garden side. The surviving ceiling paintings of the White hall and of the Dance hall were supposedly executed by the painter Giovanni Batista Scotti. To date, the interiors of 15 rooms have been partially or entirely preserved. These include the suite of rooms (Crimson drawing room, Blue drawing room, White hall, Dance hall, etc.), overlooking the garden. The decoration of the interiors is done in the Empire style.

History  Before 1930 alt=William E. Boeing in 1929 In 1909 William E. Boeing, a wealthy lumber entrepreneur who studied at Yale University, became fascinated with airplanes after seeing one at the Alaska-Yukon-Pacific Exposition in Seattle. In 1910 he bought the Heath Shipyard, a wooden boat manufacturing facility at the mouth of the Duwamish River, which later became his first airplane factory. In 1915 Boeing traveled to Los Angeles to be taught flying by Glenn Martin and purchased a Martin \\"Flying Birdcage\\" seaplane (so-called because of all the guy-wires holding it together). The aircraft was shipped disassembled by rail to the northeast shore of Lake Union, where Martin's pilot and handyman James Floyd Smith assembled it in a tent hangar. The Birdcage was damaged in a crash during testing, and when Martin informed Boeing that replacement parts would not become available for months, Boeing realized he could build his own plane in that amount of time. He put the idea to his friend George Conrad Westervelt, a U.S. Navy engineer, who agreed to work on an improved design and help build the new airplane, called the \\"B&W;\\" seaplane. Boeing made good use of his Duwamish boatworks and its woodworkers under the direction of Edward Heath, from whom he bought it, in fabricating wooden components to be assembled at Lake Union. Westervelt was transferred to the east coast by the Navy before the plane was finished, however, Boeing hired Wong Tsu to replace Westervelt's engineering expertise, and completed two B&Ws; in the lakeside hangar. On June 15, 1916, the B&W; took its maiden flight. Seeing the opportunity to be a regular producer of airplanes, with the expertise of Mr. Wong, suitable productive facilities, and an abundant supply of spruce wood suitable for aircraft, Boeing incorporated his airplane manufacturing business as \\"Pacific Aero Products Co\\" on July 15, 1916.Boeing History Narrative – Beginnings – Biplanes by the Sea Retrieved November 4, 2010. The B&W; airplanes were offered to the US Navy but they were not interested, and regular production of airplanes would not begin until US entry into World War I a year later. On April 26, 1917, Boeing changed the name to the \\"Boeing Airplane Company\\". Boeing was later reincorporated in Delaware; the original Certificate of Incorporation was filed with the Secretary of State of Delaware on July 19, 1934. Replica of Boeing's first plane, the Boeing Model 1, at the Museum of Flight In 1917, the company moved its operations to Boeing's Duwamish boatworks, which became Boeing Plant 1. The Boeing Airplane Company's first engineer was Wong Tsu, a Chinese graduate of the Massachusetts Institute of Technology hired by Boeing in May 1916. He designed the Boeing Model C, which was Boeing's first financial success. On April 6, 1917, the U.S. had declared war on Germany and entered World War I. With the U.S. entering the war, Boeing knew that the U.S. Navy needed seaplanes for training, so Boeing shipped two new Model Cs to Pensacola, Florida, where the planes were flown for the Navy. The Navy liked the Model C and ordered 50 more. In light of this financial windfall, \\"from Bill Boeing onward, the company's chief executives through the decades were careful to note that without Wong Tsu's efforts, especially with the Model C, the company might not have survived the early years to become the dominant world aircraft manufacturer.\\" When World War I ended in 1918, a large surplus of cheap, used military planes flooded the commercial airplane market, preventing aircraft companies from selling any new airplanes, driving many out of business. Others, including Boeing, started selling other products. Boeing built dressers, counters, and furniture, along with flat-bottom boats called Sea Sleds. In 1919, the Boeing B-1 flying boat made its first flight. It accommodated one pilot and two passengers and some mail. Over the course of eight years, it made international airmail flights from Seattle to Victoria, British Columbia.. On May 24, 1920, the Boeing Model 8 made its first flight. It was the first airplane to fly over Mount Rainier. P-12 air superiority fighter In 1923, Boeing entered competition against Curtiss to develop a pursuit fighter for the U.S. Army Air Service. The Army accepted both designs and Boeing continued to develop its PW-9 fighter into the subsequent radial- engined F2B F3B, and P12/F4B fighters,Boeing P-12/F4B Fighter , retrieved November 5, 2010. which made Boeing a leading manufacturer of fighters over the course of the next decade. In 1925, Boeing built its Model 40 mail airplane for the U.S. government to use on airmail routes. In 1927, an improved version, the Model 40A was built. The Model 40A won the U.S. Post Office's contract to deliver mail between San Francisco and Chicago. This model also had a cabin to accommodate two passengers. That same year, Boeing created an airline named Boeing Air Transport, which merged a year later with Pacific Air Transport and the Boeing Airplane Company. The first airmail flight for the airline was on July 1, 1927.Boeing History—Beginnings... Mail and Boa abroad Retrieved November 5, 2010. In 1929, the company merged with Pratt & Whitney, Hamilton Aero Manufacturing Company, and Chance Vought under the new title United Aircraft and Transport Corporation. The merger was followed by the acquisition of the Sikorsky Manufacturing Corporation, Stearman Aircraft Corporation, and Standard Metal Propeller Company. United Aircraft then purchased National Air Transport in 1930. On July 27, 1928, the 12-passenger Boeing 80 biplane made its first flight. With three engines, it was Boeing's first plane built with the sole intention of being a passenger transport. An upgraded version, the 80A, carrying eighteen passengers, made its first flight in September 1929. 1930s and 1940s In the early 1930s, Boeing became a leader in all-metal aircraft construction, and in the design revolution that established the path for transport aircraft through the 1930s. In 1930, Boeing built the Monomail, a low-wing all-metal monoplane that carried mail. The low drag airframe with cantilever wings and the retractable landing gear was so revolutionary that the engines and propellers of the time were not adequate to realize the potential of the plane. By the time controllable pitch propellers were developed, Boeing was building its Model 247 airliner. Two Monomails were built. The second one, the Model 221, had a 6-passenger cabin. In 1931, the Monomail design became the foundation of the Boeing YB-9, the first all-metal, cantilever-wing, monoplane bomber. Five examples entered service between September 1932 and March 1933. The performance of the twin-engine monoplane bomber led to a reconsideration of air defense requirements, although it was soon rendered obsolete by rapidly advancing bomber designs. In 1932, Boeing introduced the Model 248, the first all-metal monoplane fighter. The P-26 Peashooter was in front-line service with the US Army Air Corps from 1934 to 1938. In 1933, the Boeing 247 was introduced, which set the standard for all competitors in the passenger transport market. The 247 was an all-metal low-wing monoplane that was much faster, safer, and easier to fly than other passenger aircraft. For example, it was the first twin-engine passenger aircraft that could fly on one engine. In an era of unreliable engines, this vastly improved flight safety. Boeing built the first 59 aircraft exclusively for its own United Airlines subsidiary's operations. The direction established with the 247 was further developed by Douglas Aircraft, resulting in one of the most successful designs in aviation history. The Air Mail Act of 1934 prohibited airlines and manufacturers from being under the same corporate umbrella, so the company split into three smaller companies – Boeing Airplane Company, United Airlines, and United Aircraft Corporation, the precursor to United Technologies. Boeing retained the Stearman facilities in Wichita, Kansas. Following the breakup of United Aircraft, William Boeing sold off his shares and left Boeing. Clairmont \\"Claire\\" L. Egtvedt, who had become Boeing's president in 1933, became the chairman as well. He believed the company's future was in building bigger planes.Herman, Arthur. Freedom's Forge: How American Business Produced Victory in World War II, pp. 291–3, 36–7, 332, Random House, New York, NY. . Work began in 1936 on Boeing Plant 2 to accommodate the production of larger modern aircraft. From 1934 to 1937, Boeing was developing an experimental long-range bomber, the XB-15. At its introduction in 1937, it was the largest heavier- than-air craft built to date. Trials revealed that its speed was unsatisfactory, but the design experience was used in the development of the Model 299 prototype four-engine bomber of 1935, which was developed into the YB-17 of 1936, and the Model 314 flying boat that first flew in 1938. Overlapping with the period of the YB-15 development, an agreement with Pan American World Airways (Pan Am) was reached, to develop and build a commercial flying boat able to carry passengers on transoceanic routes. The first flight of the Boeing 314 Clipper was in June 1938. It was the largest civil aircraft of its time, with a capacity of 90 passengers on day flights, and of 40 passengers on night flights. One year later, the first regular passenger service from the U.S. to the UK was inaugurated. Subsequently, other routes were opened, so that soon Pan Am flew with the Boeing 314 to destinations all over the world. In 1938, Boeing completed work on its Model 307 Stratoliner. This was the world's first pressurized-cabin transport aircraft, and it was capable of cruising at an altitude of – above most weather disturbances. It was based on the B-17, using the same wings, tail, and engines. Boeing B-29 assembly line in Wichita, Kansas, 1944 During World War II, Boeing built a large number of B-17 and B-29 bombers. Boeing ranked twelfth among United States corporations in the value of wartime production contracts.Peck, Merton J. & Scherer, Frederic M. The Weapons Acquisition Process: An Economic Analysis (1962) Harvard Business School p.619 Many of the workers were women whose husbands had gone to war. In the beginning of March 1944, production had been scaled up in such a manner that over 350 planes were built each month. To prevent an attack from the air, the manufacturing plants had been covered with greenery and farmland items. During the war years the leading aircraft companies of the U.S. cooperated. The Boeing-designed B-17 bomber was assembled also by Vega (a subsidiary of Lockheed Aircraft Corp.) and Douglas Aircraft Co., while the B-29 was assembled also by Bell Aircraft Co. and by Glenn L. Martin Company.Herman, Arthur. Freedom's Forge: How American Business Produced Victory in World War II, pp. 118, 297–8, Random House, New York, NY. . In 1942 Boeing started the development of the C-97 Stratofreighter, the first of a generation of heavy-lift military transports; it became operational in 1947. The C-97 design would be successfully adapted for use as an aerial refueling tanker, although its role as a mode of transport was soon limited by designs that had advantages in either versatility or capacity. Boeing 377 Stratocruiser of BOAC After the war, most orders of bombers were canceled and 70,000 people lost their jobs at Boeing. The company aimed to recover quickly by selling its Stratocruiser (the Model 377), a luxurious four-engine commercial airliner derived from the C-97. However, sales of this model were not as expected and Boeing had to seek other opportunities to overcome the situation. In 1947 Boeing flew its first jet aircraft, the XB-47, from which the highly successful B-47 and B-52 bombers were derived. 1950s The Boeing 707 in British Overseas Airways Corporation (BOAC) livery, 1964 B-52 bomber Boeing developed military jets such as the B-47 Stratojet and B-52 Stratofortress bombers in the late-1940s and into the 1950s. During the early 1950s, Boeing used company funds to develop the 367–80 jet airliner demonstrator that led to the KC-135 Stratotanker and Boeing 707 jetliner. Some of these were built at Boeing's facilities in Wichita, Kansas, which existed from 1931 to 2014. Between the last delivery of a 377 in 1950 and the first order for the 707 in 1955, Boeing was shut out of the commercial aircraft market. In the mid-1950s technology had advanced significantly, which gave Boeing the opportunity to develop and manufacture new products. One of the first was the guided short-range missile used to intercept enemy aircraft. By that time the Cold War had become a fact of life, and Boeing used its short- range missile technology to develop and build an intercontinental missile. In 1958, Boeing began delivery of its 707, the United States' first commercial jet airliner, in response to the British De Havilland Comet, French Sud Aviation Caravelle and Soviet Tupolev Tu-104, which were the world's first generation of commercial jet aircraft. With the 707, a four-engine, 156-passenger airliner, the U.S. became a leader in commercial jet manufacturing. A few years later, Boeing added a second version of this aircraft, the Boeing 720, which was slightly faster and had a shorter range. Boeing was a major producer of small turbine engines during the 1950s and 1960s. The engines represented one of the company's major efforts to expand its product base beyond military aircraft after World War II. Development on the gas turbine engine started in 1943 and Boeing's gas turbines were designated models 502 (T50), 520 (T60), 540, 551 and 553. Boeing built 2,461 engines before production ceased in April 1968. Many applications of the Boeing gas turbine engines were considered to be firsts, including the first turbine-powered helicopter and boat. 1960s 707 and 747 formed the backbone of many major airline fleets through the end of the 1970s, including United (747 shown) and Pan Am (707 shown) Lufthansa Boeing 727 A Boeing 737, the best-selling commercial jet aircraft in aviation history Vertol Aircraft Corporation was acquired by Boeing in 1960, and was reorganized as Boeing's Vertol division. The twin-rotor CH-47 Chinook, produced by Vertol, took its first flight in 1961. This heavy-lift helicopter remains a work-horse vehicle to the present day. In 1964, Vertol also began production of the CH-46 Sea Knight. In December 1960, Boeing announced the model 727 jetliner, which went into commercial service about three years later. Different passenger, freight, and convertible freighter variants were developed for the 727. The 727 was the first commercial jetliner to reach 1,000 sales. On May 21, 1961, the company shortened its name to the current \\"Boeing Company\\".\\"The Boeing Log Book\\", various volumes, published by Boeing Historical Archives. Boeing won a contract in 1961 to manufacture the S-IC stage of the Saturn V rocket, manufactured at the Michoud Assembly Facility in New Orleans, Louisiana. In 1966, Boeing president William M. Allen asked Malcolm T. Stamper to spearhead production of the new 747 airliner on which the company's future was riding. This was a monumental engineering and management challenge and included the construction of the world's biggest factory in which to build the 747 at Everett, Washington, a plant which is the size of 40 football fields. In 1967, Boeing introduced another short- and medium-range airliner, the twin-engine 737. It has since become the best-selling commercial jet aircraft in aviation history. Several versions have been developed, mainly to increase seating capacity and range. The 737 remains in production as of February 2018 with the latest 737 MAX series. The roll-out ceremonies for the first 747-100 took place in 1968, at the massive new factory in Everett, about an hour's drive from Boeing's Seattle home. The aircraft made its first flight a year later. The first commercial flight occurred in 1970. The 747 has an intercontinental range and a larger seating capacity than Boeing's previous aircraft. Boeing also developed hydrofoils in the 1960s. The screw-driven USS High Point (PCH-1) was an experimental submarine hunter. The patrol hydrofoil USS Tucumcari (PGH-2) was more successful. Only one was built, but it saw service in Vietnam and Europe before running aground in 1972. Its waterjet and fully submersed flying foils were the examples for the later Pegasus-class patrol hydrofoils and the Model 929 Jetfoil ferries in the 1980s. The Tucumcari and later boats were produced in Renton. While the Navy hydrofoils were withdrawn from service in the late 1980s, the Boeing Jetfoils are still in service in Asia. 1970s In the early 1970s Boeing suffered from the simultaneous decline in Vietnam War military spending, the slowing of the space program as Project Apollo neared completion, the recession of 1969–70, and the company's $2 billion debt as it built the new 747 airliner. Boeing did not receive any orders for more than a year. Its bet for the future, the 747, was delayed in production by three months because of problems with its Pratt & Whitney engines. Then in March 1971, Congress voted to discontinue funding for the development of the Boeing 2707 supersonic transport (SST), the US's answer to the British-French Concorde, forcing the end of the project. Commercial Airplane Group, by far the largest unit of Boeing, went from 83,700 employees in 1968 to 20,750 in 1971. Each unemployed Boeing employee cost at least one other job in the Seattle area, and unemployment rose to 14%, the highest in the United States. Housing vacancy rates rose to 16% from 1% in 1967. U-Haul dealerships ran out of trailers because so many people moved out. A billboard appeared near the airport: In January 1970, the first 747, a four-engine long- range airliner, flew its first commercial flight with Pan American World Airways. The 747 changed the airline industry, providing much larger seating capacity than any other airliner in production. The company has delivered over 1,500 Boeing 747s. The 747 has undergone continuous improvements to keep it technologically up-to-date. Larger versions have also been developed by stretching the upper deck. The newest version of the 747, the 747-8, remains in production as of 2018. Boeing launched three Jetfoil 929-100 hydrofoils that were acquired in 1975 for service in the Hawaiian Islands. When the service ended in 1979 the three hydrofoils were acquired by Far East Hydrofoil for service between Hong Kong and Macau. During the 1970s, Boeing also developed the US Standard Light Rail Vehicle, which has been used in San Francisco, Boston, and Morgantown, West Virginia. 1980s The narrow-body Boeing 757 replaced the 727. This example is in Turkmenistan Airlines livery. The Boeing 767 replaced the Boeing 707. This example is in Qantas livery. In 1983, the economic situation began to improve. Boeing assembled its 1,000th 737 passenger aircraft. During the following years, commercial aircraft and their military versions became the basic equipment of airlines and air forces. As passenger air traffic increased, the competition was harder, mainly from Airbus, a European newcomer in commercial airliner manufacturing. Boeing had to offer new aircraft and developed the single-aisle 757, the larger, twin- aisle 767, and upgraded versions of the 737. An important project of these years was the Space Shuttle, to which Boeing contributed with its experience in space rockets acquired during the Apollo era. Boeing participated also with other products in the space program and was the first contractor for the International Space Station program. During the decade several military projects went into production, including Boeing support of the B-2 stealth bomber. As part of an industry team led by Northrop, Boeing built the B-2's outer wing portion, aft center fuselage section, landing gear, fuel system, and weapons delivery system. At its peak in 1991, the B-2 was the largest military program at Boeing, employing about 10,000 people. The same year, the US's National Aeronautic Association awarded the B-2 design team the Collier Trophy for the greatest achievement in aerospace in America. The first B-2 rolled out of the bomber's final assembly facility in Palmdale, California, in November 1988 and it flew for the first time on July 17, 1989. The Avenger air defense system and a new generation of short-range missiles also went into production. During these years, Boeing was very active in upgrading existing military equipment and developing new ones. Boeing also contributed to wind power development with the experimental MOD-2 Wind Turbines for NASA and the United States Department of Energy, and the MOD-5B for Hawaii. 1990s Air France 777-300ER Boeing was one of seven competing companies that bid for the Advanced Tactical Fighter. Boeing agreed to team with General Dynamics and Lockheed so that all three companies would participate in the development if one of the three companies' designs was selected. The Lockheed design was eventually selected and developed into the F-22 Raptor.Miller, Jay. Lockheed Martin F/A-22 Raptor, Stealth Fighter. Aerofax, 2005. . In April 1994, Boeing introduced the most modern commercial jet aircraft at the time, the twin- engine 777, with a seating capacity of approximately 300 to 370 passengers in a typical three-class layout, in between the 767 and the 747. The longest range twin-engined aircraft in the world, the 777 was the first Boeing airliner to feature a \\"fly-by-wire\\" system and was conceived partly in response to the inroads being made by the European Airbus into Boeing's traditional market. This aircraft reached an important milestone by being the first airliner to be designed entirely by using computer-aided design (CAD) techniques.Norris, Guy and Mark Wagner. Boeing 777: The Technological Marvel. Minneapolis, Minnesota: Zenith Imprint, 2001. . The 777 was also the first airplane to be certified for 180 minute ETOPS at entry into service by the FAA. Also in the mid-1990s, the company developed the revamped version of the 737, known as the 737 \\"Next-Generation\\", or 737NG. It has since become the fastest-selling version of the 737 in history, and on April 20, 2006, sales passed those of the \\"Classic 737\\", with a follow-up order for 79 aircraft from Southwest Airlines. In 1995, Boeing chose to demolish the headquarters complex on East Marginal Way South instead of upgrading it to match new seismic standards. The headquarters were moved to an adjacent building and the facility was demolished in 1996.\\"Boeing to Raze Company Headquarters Building; Will Relocate to Adjacent Building\\" August 4, 1995. In 1997, Boeing was headquartered on East Marginal Way South, by King County Airport, in Seattle. In 1996, Boeing acquired Rockwell's aerospace and defense units. The Rockwell business units became a subsidiary of Boeing, named Boeing North American, Inc. In August 1997, Boeing merged with McDonnell Douglas in a US$13 billion stock swap, with Boeing as the surviving company. Following the merger, the McDonnell Douglas MD-95 was renamed the Boeing 717, and the production of the MD-11 trijet was limited to the freighter version. Boeing introduced a new corporate identity with completion of the merger, incorporating the Boeing logotype and a stylized version of the McDonnell Douglas symbol, which was derived from the Douglas Aircraft logo from the 1970s. An aerospace analyst criticized the CEO and his deputy, Philip M. Condit and Harry Stonecipher, for thinking of their personal benefit first, and causing the problems to Boeing many years later. Instead of investing the huge cash reserve to build new airplanes, they initiated a program to buy back Boeing stock for more than US$10 billion.: Himmel, hilf!, DIE ZEIT, September 20, 2011 (de). Means: mismanagement, heaven help! In May 1999, Boeing studied buying Embraer to encourage commonality between the E-Jets and the Boeing 717, but this was nixed by then-president Harry Stonecipher. He preferred buying Bombardier Aerospace, but its owner, the Beaudoin family, asked for a price too high for Boeing which remembered its mid-1980s purchase of de Havilland Canada, losing a million dollars every day for three years before selling it to Bombardier in 1992. 2000–2009 International Space Station Boeing Everett Factory in 2011 In January 2000, Boeing chose to expand its presence in another aerospace field of satellite communications by purchasing Hughes Electronics. In March 2001, Boeing announced the pending relocation of its headquarters from Seattle to one of three cities: Chicago, Dallas, or Denver. All three had offered packages of multimillion-dollar tax breaks, and the selection of Chicago was announced on May 10; the move was completed in early September, just before 9/11. Its offices are located in the Fulton River District just outside the Chicago Loop.\\"Contact Us.\\" Boeing. Retrieved on May 12, 2009. In October 2001, Boeing lost to its rival Lockheed Martin in the fierce competition for the multibillion-dollar Joint Strike Fighter contract. Boeing's entry, the X-32, was rejected in favor of Lockheed's X-35. Boeing continues to serve as the prime contractor on the International Space Station and has built several of the major components. Boeing began development of the KC-767 aerial refueling tanker in the early 2000s. Italy and Japan ordered four KC-767s each. After development delays and FAA certification, Boeing delivered the tankers to Japan from 2008\\"Boeing Delivers First KC-767 Tanker to Japan\\" .

Boeing In 2004, Boeing ended production of the 757 after 1,050 aircraft were produced. More advanced stretched versions of the 737 were beginning to compete against the 757, and the planned 787-3 was to fill much of the top end of the 757 markets. Also that year, Boeing announced that the 717, the last civil aircraft to be designed by McDonnell Douglas, would cease production in 2006. The 767 was in danger of cancellation as well, with the 787 replacing it, but orders for the freighter version extended the program. After several decades of success, Boeing lost ground to Airbus and subsequently lost its lead in the airliner market in 2003. Multiple Boeing projects were pursued and then canceled, notably the Sonic Cruiser, a proposed jetliner that would travel just under the speed of sound, cutting intercontinental travel times by as much as 20%. It was launched in 2001 along with a new advertising campaign to promote the company's new motto, \\"Forever New Frontiers\\", and to rehabilitate its image. However, the plane's fate was sealed by the changes in the commercial aviation market following the September 11 attacks and the subsequent weak economy and an increase in fuel prices. Subsequently, Boeing streamlined its production and turned its attention to a new model, the Boeing 787 Dreamliner, using much of the technology developed for the Sonic Cruiser, but in a more conventional aircraft designed for maximum efficiency. The company also launched new variants of its successful 737 and 777 models. The 787 proved to be a highly popular choice with airlines and won a record number of pre-launch orders. With delays to Airbus' A380 program several airlines threatened to switch their A380 orders to Boeing's new 747 version, the 747-8. Airbus's response to the 787, the A350, received a lukewarm response at first when it was announced as an improved version of the A330, and then gained significant orders when Airbus promised an entirely new design. The 787 program encountered delays, with the first flight not occurring until late 2009.\\"Boeing 787 first flight announced\\". BBC News Online, August 27, 2009. After regulatory approval, Boeing formed a joint venture, United Launch Alliance with its competitor, Lockheed Martin, on December 1, 2006. The new venture is the largest provider of rocket launch services to the U.S. government. In 2005, Gary Scott, ex- Boeing executive and then head of Bombardier's CSeries program, suggested a collaboration on the upcoming CSeries, but an internal study assessed Embraer as the best partner for regional jets. The Brazilian government wanted to retain control and blocked an acquisition. On August 2, 2005, Boeing sold its Rocketdyne rocket engine division to Pratt & Whitney. On May 1, 2006, Boeing agreed to purchase Dallas, Texas-based Aviall, Inc. for $1.7 billion and retain $350 million in debt. Aviall, Inc. and its subsidiaries, Aviall Services, Inc. and ILS formed a wholly owned subsidiary of Boeing Commercial Aviation Services (BCAS). Realizing that increasing numbers of passengers have become reliant on their computers to stay in touch, Boeing introduced Connexion by Boeing, a satellite-based Internet connectivity service that promised air travelers unprecedented access to the World Wide Web. The company debuted the product to journalists in 2005, receiving generally favorable reviews. However, facing competition from cheaper options, such as cellular networks, it proved too difficult to sell to most airlines. In August 2006, after a short and unsuccessful search for a buyer for the business, Boeing chose to discontinue the service. On August 18, 2007, NASA selected Boeing as the manufacturing contractor for the liquid-fueled upper stage of the Ares I rocket. The stage, based on both Apollo-Saturn and Space Shuttle technologies, was to be constructed at NASA's Michoud Assembly Facility near New Orleans; Boeing constructed the S-IC stage of the Saturn V rocket at this site in the 1960s. The Boeing 787 Dreamliner on its first flight Boeing launched the 777 Freighter in May 2005 with an order from Air France. The freighter variant is based on the −200LR. Other customers include FedEx and Emirates. Boeing officially announced in November 2005 that it would produce a larger variant of the 747, the 747-8, in two versions, commencing with the Freighter version with firm orders for two cargo carriers. The second version, named the Intercontinental, is for passenger airlines. Both 747-8 versions feature a lengthened fuselage, new, advanced engines and wings, and the incorporation of other technologies developed for the 787. Boeing also received the launch contract from the U.S. Navy for the P-8 Poseidon Multimission Maritime Aircraft, an anti-submarine warfare patrol aircraft. It has also received orders for the 737 AEW&C; \\"Wedgetail\\" aircraft. The company has also introduced new extended range versions of the 737. These include the 737-700ER and 737-900ER. The 737-900ER is the latest and will extend the range of the 737-900 to a similar range as the successful 737-800 with the capability to fly more passengers, due to the addition of two extra emergency exits. The record-breaking 777-200LR Worldliner, presented at the Paris Air Show 2005. The 777-200LR Worldliner embarked on a well-received global demonstration tour in the second half of 2005, showing off its capacity to fly farther than any other commercial aircraft. On November 10, 2005, the 777-200LR set a world record for the longest non-stop flight. The plane, which departed from Hong Kong traveling to London, took a longer route, which included flying over the U.S. It flew 11,664 nautical miles (21,601 km) during its 22-hour 42-minute flight. It was flown by Pakistan International Airlines pilots and PIA was the first airline to fly the 777-200LR Worldliner. On August 11, 2006, Boeing agreed to form a joint-venture with the large Russian titanium producer, VSMPO-Avisma for the machining of titanium forgings. The forgings will be used on the 787 program.\\"Boeing and VSMPO-AVISMA Announce Titanium Agreement\\", Boeing, August 11, 2006. In December 2007, Boeing and VSMPO-Avisma created a joint venture, Ural Boeing Manufacturing, and signed a contract on titanium product deliveries until 2015, with Boeing planning to invest $27 billion in Russia over the next 30 years. Корпорация ВСМПО-АВИСМА In February 2011, Boeing received a contract for 179 KC-46 U.S. Air Force tankers at a value of $35 billion. The KC-46 tankers are based on the KC-767. Graphic representation of the XM1202 Mounted Combat System vehicle Boeing, along with Science Applications International Corporation (SAIC), were the prime contractors in the U.S. military's Future Combat Systems program. The FCS program was canceled in June 2009 with all remaining systems swept into the BCT Modernization program.\\"Future Combat System (FCS) Program to Army Brigade Combat Team Modernization\\". U.S. DoD, June 23, 2009. Boeing works jointly with SAIC in the BCT Modernization program like the FCS program but the U.S. Army will play a greater role in creating baseline vehicles and will only contract others for accessories. Defense Secretary Robert M. Gates' shift in defense spending to, \\"make tough choices about specific systems and defense priorities based solely on the national interest and then stick to those decisions over time\\" hit Boeing especially hard, because of their heavy involvement with canceled Air Force projects. Unethical conduct In May 2003, the U.S. Air Force announced it would lease 100 KC-767 tankers to replace the oldest 136 KC-135s. In November 2003, responding to critics who argued that the lease was more expensive than an outright purchase, the DoD announced a revised lease of 20 aircraft and a purchase of 80. In December 2003, the Pentagon announced the project was to be frozen while an investigation of allegations of corruption by one of its former procurement staffers, Darleen Druyun (who began employment at Boeing in January) was begun. The fallout of this resulted in the resignation of Boeing CEO Philip M. Condit and the termination of CFO Michael M. Sears.\\"Ex-Boeing CFO Pleads Guilty in Druyun Case\\", The Washington Post, November 16, 2004. Harry Stonecipher, former McDonnell Douglas CEO and Boeing COO, replaced Condit on an interim basis. Druyun pleaded guilty to inflating the price of the contract to favor her future employer and to passing information on the competing Airbus A330 MRTT bid. In October 2004, she received a sentence of nine months in federal prison, seven months in a community facility, and three years probation.\\"Ex-Air Force Official Gets Prison Time\\". The Washington Post. Retrieved on August 16, 2013. In March 2005, the Boeing board forced President and CEO Harry Stonecipher to resign. Boeing said an internal investigation revealed a \\"consensual\\" relationship between Stonecipher and a female executive that was \\"inconsistent with Boeing's Code of Conduct\\" and \\"would impair his ability to lead the company\\". James A. Bell served as interim CEO (in addition to his normal duties as Boeing's CFO) until the appointment of Jim McNerney as the new Chairman, President, and CEO on June 30, 2005. Industrial espionage In June 2003, Lockheed Martin sued Boeing, alleging that the company had resorted to industrial espionage in 1998 to win the Evolved Expendable Launch Vehicle (EELV) competition. Lockheed Martin claimed that the former employee Kenneth Branch, who went to work for McDonnell Douglas and Boeing, passed nearly 30,000 pages of proprietary documents to his new employers. Lockheed Martin argued that these documents allowed Boeing to win 19 of the 28 tendered military satellite launches. In July 2003, Boeing was penalized, with the Pentagon stripping seven launches away from the company and awarding them to Lockheed Martin. Furthermore, the company was forbidden to bid for rocket contracts for a twenty-month period, which expired in March 2005. In early September 2005, it was reported that Boeing was negotiating a settlement with the U.S. Department of Justice in which it would pay up to $500 million to cover this and the Darleen Druyun scandal. 1992 EC-US Agreement notes Until the late 1970s, the U.S. had a near monopoly in the Large Civil Aircraft (LCA) sector. The Airbus consortium (created in 1969) started competing effectively in the 1980s. At that stage the U.S. became concerned about European competition and the alleged subsidies paid by the European governments for the developments of the early models of the Airbus family. This became a major issue of contention, as the European side was equally concerned by subsidies accruing to U.S. LCA manufacturers through NASA and Defense programs. Europe and the U.S. started bilateral negotiations for the limitation of government subsidies to the LCA sector in the late 1980s. Negotiations were concluded in 1992 with the signing of the EC-US Agreement on Trade in Large Civil Aircraft which imposes disciplines on government support on both sides of the Atlantic which are significantly stricter than the relevant World Trade Organization (WTO) rules: Notably, the Agreement regulates in detail the forms and limits of government support, prescribes transparency obligations and commits the parties to avoiding trade disputes. Subsidy disputes In 2004, the EU and the U.S. agreed to discuss a possible revision of the 1992 EC-US Agreement provided that this would cover all forms of subsidies including those used in the U.S., and in particular the subsidies for the Boeing 787; the first new aircraft to be launched by Boeing for 14 years. In October 2004 the U.S. began legal proceedings at the WTO by requesting WTO consultations on European launch investment to Airbus. The U.S. also unilaterally withdrew from the 1992 EU-US Agreement. The U.S. claimed Airbus had violated a 1992 bilateral accord when it received what Boeing deemed \\"unfair\\" subsidies from several European governments. Airbus responded by filing a separate complaint, contesting that Boeing had also violated the accord when it received tax breaks from the U.S. Government. Moreover, the EU also complained that the investment subsidies from Japanese airlines violated the accord. On January 11, 2005, Boeing and Airbus agreed that they would attempt to find a solution to the dispute outside of the WTO. However, in June 2005, Boeing and the United States government reopened the trade dispute with the WTO, claiming that Airbus had received illegal subsidies from European governments. Airbus has also responded to this claim against Boeing, reopening the dispute and also accusing Boeing of receiving subsidies from the U.S. Government. On September 15, 2010, the WTO ruled that Boeing had received billions of dollars in government subsidies. Boeing responded by stating that the ruling was a fraction of the size of the ruling against Airbus and that it required few changes in its operations. Boeing has received $8.7billion in support from Washington state. 2010–2016 In summer 2010, Boeing acquired Fairfax, VA-based C4ISR and combat systems developer Argon ST to expand its C4ISR, cyber and intelligence capabilities. Naturalized citizen Dongfan Chung, an engineer working with Boeing, was the first person convicted under the Economic Espionage Act of 1996. Chung is suspected of having passed on classified information on designs including the Delta IV rocket, F-15 Eagle, B-52 Stratofortress and the CH-46 and CH-47 helicopters. In 2011, Boeing was hesitating between re-engineing the 737 or developing an all-new small airplane for which Embraer could have been involved, but when the A320neo was launched with new engines, that precipitated the 737 MAX decision. On November 17, Boeing received its largest provisional order for $21.7billion at list prices from Indonesian LCC Lion Air for 201 737 MAX, 29 737-900ERs and 150 purchase rights, days after its previous order record of $18billion for 50 777-300ER from Emirates. In 2012, Boeing announced it would close its facility in Wichita, Kansas (pictured). On January 5, 2012, Boeing announced it would close its facilities in Wichita, Kansas with 2,160 workers before 2014, more than 80 years after it was established, where it had employed as many as 40,000 people. In May 2013, Boeing announced it would cut 1,500 IT jobs in Seattle over the next three years through layoffs, attrition and mostly relocation to St. Louis and North Charleston, South Carolina − 600 jobs each. In September, Boeing announced their Long Beach facility manufacturing the C-17 Globemaster III military transport would shut down. In January 2014, the company announced US$1.23billion profits for Q4 2013, a 26% increase, due to higher demand for commercial aircraft. The last plane to undergo maintenance in Boeing Wichita's facility left in May 2014. In September 2014, NASA awarded contracts to Boeing and SpaceX for transporting astronauts to the International Space Station. In June 2015, Boeing announced that James McNerney would step down as CEO to be replaced by Boeing's COO, Dennis Muilenburg, on July 1, 2015. The 279th and last C-17 was delivered in summer before closing the site, affecting 2,200 jobs. Also in 2015, Boeing reportedly started the studies of the 797/NMA, after revealing that a replacement of its own 757 would be a replacement rather than a re-engining. In February 2016, Boeing announced that Boeing President and CEO Dennis Muilenburg was elected the 10th Chairman of the Board, succeeding James McNerney. In March, Boeing announced plans to cut 4,000 jobs from its commercial airplane division by mid-year. On May 13, 2016, Boeing opened a $1billion, factory in Washington state that will make carbon-composite wings for the Boeing 777X to be delivered from 2020.  CSeries dumping petition   2017–present  In October 2017, Boeing announced plans to acquire Aurora Flight Sciences to expand its capabilities to develop autonomous, electric-powered and long- flight-duration aircraft for its commercial and military businesses, pending regulatory approval. In 2017, Boeing won 912 net orders for $134.8billion at list prices including 745737s, 94787s and 60777s, and delivered 763 airliners including 529737s, 136787s and 74777s. In January 2018, a joint venture was formed by auto seat maker Adient (50.01%) and Boeing (49.99%) to develop and manufacture airliner seats for new installations or retrofit, a $4.5billion market in 2017 which will grow to $6billion by 2026, to be based in Kaiserslautern near Frankfurt and distributed by Boeing subsidiary Aviall, with its customer service center in Seattle. Boeing CEO Dennis Muilenburg and President Trump at the 787-10 Dreamliner rollout ceremony On June 4, 2018, Boeing and Safran announced a 50-50 partnership to design, build and service auxiliary power units (APU) after regulatory and antitrust clearance in the second half of 2018. This could threaten the dominance of Honeywell and United Technologies in the APU market. At a June 2018 AIAA conference, Boeing unveiled a hypersonic transport project. On July 5, 2018, Boeing and Embraer announced a joint venture, covering Embraer's airliner business. This is seen as a reaction to Airbus acquiring a majority of the competing Bombardier CSeries on October 16, 2017. In September 2018, Boeing signed a deal with the Pentagon worth up to $2.4billion to provide helicopters for protecting nuclear-missile bases. Boeing acquired the satellite company Millennium Space System in September 2018. On March 10, 2019, an Ethiopian Airlines Boeing 737 MAX 8 crashed just minutes after take-off from Addis Ababa. Initial reports noted similarities with the crash of a Lion Air MAX 8 in October 2018. In the following days, numerous countries and airlines grounded all 737 MAX aircraft. On March 13, the FAA became the last major authority to ground the aircraft, reversing its previous stance that the MAX was safe to fly. On March 19, the U.S. Department of Transportation requested an audit of the regulatory process that led to the aircraft's certification in 2017, amid concerns that current U.S. rules allow manufacturers to largely \\"self-certify\\" aircraft. During March 2019 Boeing's share price dropped significantly. In May 2019 Boeing admitted that it had known of issues with the 737 MAX before the second crash, and only informed the Federal Aviation Authority of the software issue a month after the Lion Air crash. On April 23, 2019, the Wall Street Journal reported that Boeing, SSL and aerospace company The Carlyle Group had been helping the Chinese Peoples Liberation Army enable its mass surveillance on ethnic groups such as the Uighur Muslims in the Xinjiang autonomous region in northwestern China as well as giving a high-speed internet access to the artificial islands in the South China sea among others through the use of new satellites. The companies have been selling the new satellites to a Chinese company called AsiaSat which is a joint-venture between the Carlyle Group and the Chinese State-owned CITIC which then sells space on these satellites to Chinese companies. The companies stated that they never specifically intended for their technology to be used by China's Ministry of Public Security and the Police. On July 18, 2019, when presenting its second-quarter results, Boeing announced that it had recorded a $4.9 billion after-tax charge corresponding to its initial estimate of the cost of compensation to airlines for the 737 MAX groundings, but not the cost of lawsuits, potential fines, or the less tangible cost to its reputation. It also noted a $1.7 billion rise in estimated MAX production costs, primarily due to higher costs associated with the reduced production rate. On November 18, 2019, Boeing (49%) and Embraer (51%) announced a joint venture to market the C-390 Millennium tactical transport aircraft, called Boeing Embraer – Defense, to operate after the regulatory approvals and closing conditions. The joint ventures with Embraer, for commercial and military aircraft, were both canceled in April 2020, as Boeing was heavily affected financially by the grounding of the 737 MAX and the impact of the 2019–20 coronavirus pandemic on aviation. Boeing claimed that Embraer had failed to meet required conditions by April 24, while Embraer accused Boeing of manufacturing \\"false claims\\" in order to avoid its commitments, and stated that it would pursue \\"all remedies against Boeing for the damages incurred\\". The Master Teaming Agreement for marketing of the C-390 continued, though the prospects of international sales facilitated by Boeing diminished. In late April 2020, due to the 737 MAX grounding, Boeing left behind studies for the New Midsized Airplane/797 in favor of refreshments of its geriatric 757 and 767, alternatively called the 757-Plus and 767X. In May 2020, the company cut 12,000 jobs due to the drop in air travel during the COVID-19 pandemic. In July 2020, Boeing reported a loss of $2.4 billion as a result of the pandemic and grounding of the 737 MAX aircraft. As a result of the profit loss, the company announced that it is planning to do more job and production cuts. Future concepts In May 2006, four concept designs being examined by Boeing were outlined in The Seattle Times based on corporate internal documents. The research aims in two directions: low-cost airplanes, and environmental-friendly planes. Codenamed after some of The Muppets characters, a design team known as the Green Team concentrated primarily on reducing fuel usage. All four designs illustrated rear-engine layouts. * \\"Fozzie\\" employs open rotors and offers a lower cruising speed. * \\"Beaker\\" has very thin, long wings, with the ability to partially fold-up to facilitate easier taxiing. * \\"Kermit Kruiser\\" has forward swept wings over which are positioned its engines, with the aim of lowering noise below due to the reflection of the exhaust signature upward. * \\"Honeydew\\" with its delta wing design, resembles a marriage of the flying wing concept and the traditional tube fuselage. As with most concepts, these designs are only in the exploratory stage, intended to help Boeing evaluate the potentials of such radical technologies. In 2015, Boeing patented its own force field technology, also known as the shock wave attenuation system, that would protect vehicles from shock waves generated by nearby explosions. Boeing has yet to confirm when they plan to build and test the technology. The Boeing Yellowstone Project is the company's project to replace its entire civil aircraft portfolio with advanced technology aircraft. New technologies to be introduced include composite aerostructures, more electrical systems (reduction of hydraulic systems), and more fuel-efficient turbofan engines, such as the Pratt & Whitney PW1000G Geared Turbofan, General Electric GEnx, the CFM International LEAP56, and the Rolls-Royce Trent 1000. The term \\"Yellowstone\\" refers to the technologies, while \\"Y1\\" through \\"Y3\\" refer to the actual aircraft.

When cells divide, there are many internal or external factors that would lead to a stoppage of division. This stoppage could be permanent or temporary, and could occur in any one of the four cycle phases (G1, S, G2 and M), depending on the status of cells or the activities they are undergoing. During the process, all cell duplication process, including mitosis, meiosis as well as DNA replication, will be paused. The mechanisms involve the proteins and DNA sequences inside cells. __TOC__  Permanent cell cycle withdrawal  Permanent cell cycle withdrawal refers to the forever stoppage in divisions of cells. In organisms, cells do not divide endlessly. Certain mechanisms are present to prevent cells from indefinite division, which is mostly done by programmed failure in DNA synthesis. By adapting the above mechanism, cells are prevented from over dividing. The process also enables cells to proceed to senescence, which are further stages of cell life and growth.  Mechanism  The permanent cell cycle withdrawal is mainly done by the wearing off of DNA sequences during S Phase, the second stage during a DNA replication progress. Such progress occurs in the end sequences of the whole linear chromosome named telomeres. Telomeres are sequences of repetitive nucleotides which serve no genetic use. During the replication process, the DNA replication enzymes are not able to copy the ending sequences at the telomere. Those sequences, located at the end of the telomere and chromosome, would hence get lost gradually. Once all of these sequences have been worn out, the useful genetic information in the cell’s chromosome would also get lost. This prevents cells from cell dividing, withdrawing cells from the cell division cycle. Therefore telomeres act as the buffer for cells to continue dividing and when telomeres are worn out, cells lose their dividing function. Not all cells carry out cell cycle withdrawal. In some cells, such as germ cells, stem cells and white blood cells, the withdrawal process do not occur. This is to ensure that these cells continue dividing for body growth or reproduction. Such phenomena is brought about by the presence of telomerase, which would catalyse the reaction of adding nucleotide sequences to the ends of telomeres. It replenishes the telomeres that are lost during DNA replication, compensating for enough telomerase sequence so that the useful DNA content would not be damaged. This allows such cells to have continuous division. Some other cells do not have the mechanism of cell cycle withdrawal because they don't even contain the function of cell division. Red blood cells, for example, do not contain genetic material when mature, and hence will not carry out cell cycle or its withdrawal. Some organisms also do not withdrawal mechanism. Eukaryotic organisms are such examples. The DNA structure in these organisms are in the form of circular chromosomes, meaning there would be no “ends” appearing in their DNA. Therefore the wearing off of DNA would not occur, and the genetic information would remain the same, and no withdrawal would happen. This is to prevent the stopping of cell division in eukaryotic organisms, or even withdrawing from the basic reproduction procedures of eukaryotic cells.  Significance  There are several significance with regards to the withdrawal of cell cycle, one of which is to prevent unlimited cell division in somatic cells. This is to prevent too many cells from accumulating inside an organism’s body, ensuring that cells in different organs are contained in a fixed proportion for achieving optimal function. The stoppage of exponential growth in cells also avoids cell growth diseases, such as tumours or cancer, from occurring in organism bodies. Studies have discovered the linkage between the abnormal replenishing of telomere, overactivity of telomerase, and cancer growth. Here, telomere act as a barrier against cells from dividing abnormally, hence providing a stable environment for body functions. The withdrawal process also prevents diseased cells, or cells with mutated or damaged DNA, from continuing to divide and increasing the percentage of abnormal cells inside the body. It can further allow these cells to stop their functions and differentiations to undergo a programmed cell death process called apoptosis. Furthermore, the withdrawal process could allow cells to encounter further parts of their cell life, namely senescence and natural apoptosis. During normal body activities, cells divide, grow and differentiate into different cell types and serve different functions. The above procedures are also known as senescence. After senescence, body cells would start to become old, and several functions would be lost during the process. As these cells with limited functions are inefficient in performing body activities, they are programmed to self demolition under the presence of apoptotic signals, such as caspase proteins and Bcl-2 family regulation proteins. Before such process, the cell cycle withdrawal ensures that these aged cells are not divided into other daughter cells before death, so as to maintain the age level of cells in organisms to perform efficient body activities.  Temporary cell cycle withdrawal  Temporary cell cycle withdrawal, also known as cell cycle arrest, refers to the short-term stoppage in cell division. This mechanism often happens in organisms' bodies, mainly due to the reasons of abnormality in growth factors or the replication of DNA. In these cases, the withdrawal starts when abnormality is detected, and ends once the detected errors have been repaired. This process makes sure that cells are functioning properly after dividing, and to prevent mutations from occurring.  Mechanism  The mechanism is brought about by positive and negative regulators, and has specific checkpoints to signal cell cycle to stop. The cell cycle goes on only when a go ahead signal was received by the checkpoints, meaning the stages of cell cycle are operating as usual. Cyclins and cyclin-dependent kinases (CDK) are major positive regulators, and appear throughout the cell cycle. The CDK appear as positive regulators, which withdraws cells from their cycle if a certain type of cyclin is not detected in the process of cell division. Throughout the cell cycle, three cyclins, namely G1/S, S and M, would appear an different stages of the cell cycle respectively. The CDK detects the presence of these cyclins by binding with these cyclins and produce a type of target protein to move the cell cycle forward. Once the cyclins are absent, it means the previous process in cell cycle is not finished yet, and hence the cell cycle comes to a halt until the whole process is made. The detection of G1/S, S and M cyclins takes place in G1 phase, at the end of G1 phase, and at the end of G2 phase respectively. There are two main types of negative regulators in the cell cycle that arrests the cell cycle, and has to be removed in order to resume the process. The first one is retinoblastoma protein, which prevents the cell from getting too large and to prohibit the premature transition from G1 to S phase. It functions by binding to transcription factors, for example E2F, so that the DNA could not be replicated until the cell has grown to a certain extent and the retinoblastoma protein is phosphorylated. Another type of negative regulator is p53, which halts the cell cycle process upon detection of DNA damage so as to provide to for repairing. This regulator can also induce apoptosis when the DNA damage is too large and cannot be repaired. Checkpoints in cell cycles include DNA replication checkpoints and spindle assembly checkpoints. DNA replication checkpoints are located at the G1, S and G2 phase to check if DNA is normal, and withdraws the cell from cycle if the DNA is damaged or has undergone incomplete replication. The spindle assembly checkpoints, on the other hand, ensures that the chromosomes in cells are segregated properly by microtubules in cells during mitotic cell division. If errors occur when the microtubules are attaching to the centromere, the centre of a chromosome, the cell cycle will halt until the error is corrected. Possible errors include microtubules not attached properly to the centromere, or chromosomes are not segregated in half.  Significance  The significance of cell cycle arrest is merely to ensure that cells do not undergo improper division. Once such division occurs, the cell cycle automatically stops until repairs have been made, or directly proceed to the stage of apoptosis once the damage is irreparable. Like permanent cell cycle withdrawal, this mechanism is to prevent damaged cells from continuing to develop or even worse, dividing and spreading.

It was evolved from the T29 Heavy Tank and T30 Heavy Tank in 1945, sporting a modified anti- aircraft gun. Extra armor plating was applied to the rear of the turret bustle as a counterweight for the heavier 120mm T53 main gun. The vehicle was deemed too heavy and no production orders were placed.  Development  In 1945, encounters with heavy German tanks and tank destroyers such as the Tiger II and Jagdtiger lead to a new project to counter these new threats. It was built on the same chassis as the earlier T29 and T30, which was a lengthened version of the T26E3 chassis.

It is the 2019 entry in the Power Rangers franchise. The show follows Devon Daniels, Ravi Shaw, Zoey Reeves, Nate Silva, and Steel as they are recruited by Grid Battleforce to defend the Morphin Grid from Evox. Beast Morpher Power Rangers The Beast Morpher Rangers are a government- funded team formed by Grid Battleforce from Morph-X combined with animal DNA. Blaze and Roxy were the original candidates for the Red and Yellow Rangers until Evox corrupted the morphing process and infected their bodies; producing clones who became his loyal Avatars while the real ones were rendered comatose. Following this, Devon and Zoey took their place by accident. However, their Morph-X was semi-corrupted by Evox, causing them to receive varying weaknesses. The Rangers transform using Beast-X Morphers in conjunction with Morph-X Keys and each wield a Beast-X Blaster and Saber, which can be combined to form the Beast-X Cannon. In season two, Nate developed the Beast-X Visors, which allow Devon, Ravi, and Zoey to combine with their Beast Bot partners and assume Beast-X Mode to enhance their animal powers. Devon Daniels Devon Daniels is the leader of the Beast Morpher Rangers and the son of Mayor Adam Daniels. Originally, he was not meant to be the Red Ranger as he was not associated with Grid Battleforce. After he snuck in and witnessed Evox’s first attack, he became the Red Ranger. As the Red Beast Morpher Ranger, he was fused with cheetah DNA, which allows him to move at superhuman speeds. Due to Evox's corruption however, Devon will instantly become frozen whenever he sees or hear anything related to dogs. Devon also controls the Racer Zord, which has a car mode, a cheetah mode, and a humanoid battle mode. While piloting the Racer Zord, he can access the Cheetah Beast Blaster to destroy Gigadrones. In season two, Devon gains control of the Beast-X King Zord which has a motorcycle mode, a lion mode, and its own humanoid battle mode. In season one, Devon temporarily acquired a battlizer called Red Fury Mode, which enhanced his strength. As it ran on Fury Cells that slowly corrupted him however, he was forced to discard it. Devon Daniels is portrayed by Rorrie D. Travis. Ravi Shaw Ravi Shaw is a Grid Battleforce cadet, son of Commander Shaw, and the only original candidate who survived Evox's first attack. He was in a relationship with Roxy before he broke up with her to embrace his duties as a Ranger. He later felt guilty for pushing her aside after her Avatar's creation left her comatose and eventually revived her before mending their relationship. As the Blue Beast Morpher Ranger, he was fused with gorilla DNA, which gives him superhuman strength. Due to Evox's corruption, Ravi will overheat and become enraged whenever he overuses his powers enough to attack friend and foe alike. Ravi also controls the Wheeler Zord, which has a truck mode and a gorilla mode. Ravi Shaw is portrayed by Jasmeet \\"Jazz\\" Baduwalia. Zoey Reeves Zoey Reeves is a former laundry girl at Grid Battleforce who became the Yellow Ranger after Roxy was rendered comatose. Zoey displays an optimistic approach to solving problems. As the Yellow Beast Morpher Ranger, she was fused with jackrabbit DNA, which gives her powerful jumping and kicking abilities. Due to Evox's corruption, Zoey will become exhausted over time and must consume carrots to replenish her energy. Zoey also controls the Chopper Zord, which has a helicopter mode and a jackrabbit mode. Zoey Reeves is portrayed by Jacqueline Scislowski. Nate Silva Nate Silva is a child prodigy, chief researcher, and head of technology at Grid Battleforce. He developed Morph-X for use as a clean, sustainable energy source and created the Rangers' powers and arsenal. Being a genius, Nate is a quick thinker in situations that require it; such as when he gave Devon, Ravi, and Zoey their powers to protect the Morphin Grid. When he was kidnapped by the Avatars and forced to build a robot body for Evox, Nate was able to subvert the plot by fusing himself with mantis DNA, which allows him to use martial arts, and become the Gold Beast Morpher Ranger. Following this, he officially joined the other Rangers in the field. Nate also pilots the Wrecker Zord, which has a crane truck mode, a mantis mode, and a humanoid battle mode. Nate Silva is portrayed by Abraham Rodriguez. Steel Steel is a stag beetle/scarab beetle-like android whom Nate built after he was captured by the Avatars and forced to build a robot body for Evox. When Nate subverted their plot, he inadvertently fused said robot body with scarab beetle DNA and his human DNA. As a result, \\"Steel\\" became the Silver Ranger as well as a \\"brother\\" of sorts to Nate. As the Silver Beast Morpher Ranger, he was fused with scarab DNA, granting him superhuman stamina. Steel also pilots the Jet Zord, which has a jet mode and a scarab beetle mode. Steel is voiced by Jamie Linehan. Grid Battleforce Grid Battleforce is a secret organization that was created to use Morph-X and keep their enemies from gaining control of the Morphin Grid. Commander Shaw Commander Shaw is Grid Battleforce's commander and Ravi's mother. Commander Shaw is portrayed by Teuila Blakely. Beast Bots The Beasts Bots are the robotic partners of the Beast Morpher Rangers. Each one was developed based on their Rangers' animal motifs. When combined with the Rangers' Zords, the Beast Bots provide a Beast Mode while their heads take on the form of control devices. In season two, Nate developed the Beast-X Visor, which can digitize the Beast Bots and transform them into armor for their Ranger partners' Beast-X Modes. * Cruise (voiced by Kelson Henderson) - The cheetah-like partner of Devon who suffers from short-term memory loss. Unlike the other Beast Bots, Cruise can transform into Devon's personal motorcycle. * Smash (voiced by Charlie McDermott) - The gorilla-like partner of Ravi, who has a tendency for giving hugs. * Jax (voiced by Emmett Skilton impersonating Danny DeVito and Derek Stephen Prince) - The jackrabbit-like partner of Zoey who dislikes being called \\"cute\\". Betty and Ben Burke Betty Burke and Ben Burke are sibling cadets of Grid Battleforce, the former being the eldest and most sensible while the latter is the most eager and impulsive. Though they have good intentions, their clumsiness can occasionally get the better of them. They work as a receptionist and security guard respectively, but can also provide assistance to the Rangers in combat. Betty and Ben are portrayed by Kristina Ho and Cosme Flores respectively. General Burke General Burke is a member of Grid Battleforce and the father of Betty and Ben. While he acts sternly, he cares for his children and has childish moments. In season two, he secretly established the Beast-X King Zord to help protect the world and rehired Megan to help develop the Zord's programming. General Burke is portrayed by Mark Wright. Blaze Blaze is a karate instructor at the Riptide Gym and the original Red Ranger candidate. He develops a rivalry with Devon after the latter defeats him. While becoming the Red Ranger, Evox corrupted the process; putting Blaze into a coma and creating an evil avatar based on him that continued his rivalry with Devon. When his avatar is destroyed, Blaze comes out of his coma and makes amends with Devon; becoming fast friends before returning to his karate instructor job. Blaze is portrayed by Colby Strong. Roxy Roxy is the original Yellow Ranger candidate and Ravi's girlfriend. Before the series took place, they were in a relationship until Ravi broke up with her to focus on their ranger duties. While becoming the Yellow Ranger, Evox corrupts the process; putting Roxy in a coma and creating an evil avatar based on her. When her avatar is destroyed, Roxy comes out of her coma and helps the Rangers foil one of Evox's plans using her evil counterpart's knowledge. Roxy later rekindled their relationship with Ravi and joined her Aunt Regina at Collins Industries. Roxy is portrayed by Liana Ramirez. Megan Megan is a Grid Battleforce Zord technician who attempted to steal Nate's job through dishonest means, such as blackmailing Zoey to get close to him before sabotaging one of his experiments to make him look incompetent. After her deception was revealed, she was immediately fired by Commander Shaw. Megan returned months later after joining General Burke's secret project to create the Beast-X King Zord to protect the global Morph-X towers; overseeing the designing and programming herself. After Evox's minions corrupted it, Megan reconciled with Nate and the Rangers before helping them regain control of the Zord. Following this, she is officially welcomed back to Grid Battleforce. Megan is portrayed by Madeleine Adams. Allies Doctor K Doctor K is a scientist and ally of the RPM Rangers from another reality. She helped the Beast Morpher Rangers separate Mayor Daniels from Evox.

In doing so, Evox created evil avatar clones of Blaze and Roxy, put the real ones into comas, and corrupted the Beast Morpher Rangers' animal DNA. However, he and his Avatars were sent to the Cyber Dimension, where they formed an alliance with Scrozzle to obtain enough Morph-X to send Evox back to Coral Harbor. After stealing a Morph-X Tower, Scrozzle constructed a robot body for Evox, who used it to overpower the Rangers before they destroyed the tower during his teleportation attempt. Unbeknownst to them however, Evox possessed Mayor Daniels after he came to the Cyber Dimension to save his son. Ever since, Evox secretly worked to collect Morph-X once more to continue his plans and undermine the Rangers as Mayor Daniels while maintaining control over his host. Despite his best efforts, the Rangers eventually discover his secret and separate them; forcing Evox to alter his plans. Evox is voiced by Andrew Laing, under the pseudonym of Randall Ewing.

Scrozzle Scrozzle is a robot and the de facto ruler of the Cyber Dimension after he fled there to hide from Vargoyle. When Evox and the Cybervillains arrived in the Cyber Dimension, Scrozzle reluctantly formed an alliance with them; lending them his gadgetry skills, Tronics, Robotrons, and Gigadrones. He uses his talents to create teleporters to travel between the Cyber Dimension and Coral Harbor, re- purpose Morph-X Keys for the Cybervillains to transform, create Robotrons via the Robotron-Maker, and create giant Gigadrones that feed on Morph-X. Scrozzle dislikes having to work with the Cybervillains as he views them as incompetent, though he did work with them once to betray Vargoyle. After the Cybervillains successfully stole a Morph-X Tower, Scrozzle began construction on a robot body for Evox before preparing to teleport him back to the real world. However, the Rangers stormed the Cyber Dimension and foiled the latter plot, though Scrozzle was able to escape with his Robotron-Maker. Scrozzle plotted his revenge against the Rangers, but was foiled by Steel and the Beast Bots. In between seasons, Scrozzle commandeered a crystalline dimension as a new base for Evox. To expand their ranks, Scrozzle scanned Blaze and Roxy for their DNA so he could combine it with back-up data on the fallen Cybervillains and spare robot parts to create robot versions of them. To ensure they survive, he also programmed the Robot Maker to recreate their bodies when they fall in battle. Scrozzle is voiced by Campbell Cooley.

Once he did, Vargoyle received an upgrade originally meant for the Cybervillains, who put aside their differences to get payback. Vargoyle continued to prove himself to Evox by easily defeating the Rangers in a second fight and building a weapon from a blueprint he stole from the Avatars for his master plan. After creating Shockatron and Shockadrone to distract the Rangers, Vargoyle used his Memory Pulsator to alter Coral Harbor's citizens' memories so the Cybervillains could steal three mega- transporters. Though the Rangers failed to stop them, Devon was able to destroy Vargoyle after he was betrayed by his allies.

She had been launched in Queen Anne's County, Maryland, and had been commissioned as a privateer on 12 September 1812. Joseph and Mary was armed with four guns and had a crew of 73 men. Narcissus chased her for three hours. As Narcissuss boats approached, the men on Joseph and Mary fired on them, killing one man and wounding another. Joseph and Mary surrendered the moment the men on the boats prepared to board. There were three wounded men aboard her. Before her capture, Joseph and Mary had recaptured the American ship Piscataqua, which subsequently bilged, and a schooner that she sold in Haiti. On 1 January 1813 Narcissus captured the brig Viper and the schooner Shepherd. Shepherd, of 134 tons (bm), Captain Robert Hart, had a crew of 18 men and was armed with two 6-pounder and two 4-pounder guns. Narcissus captured her off Cape St Blare. On 1 June 1813 HMS Narcissus slipped into Chesapeake Bay under the cover of darkness and attacked the USRC Surveyor. A Royal Navy boarding party of approximately 65 sailors and marines closed on Surveyor in small boats with muffled oars to conceal their approach. British forces navigated away from the cutter's six-pound deck guns and boarded the ship. A fierce effort by Surveyors crew to repel Royal Navy and Royal Marine boarders followed, described by British Lt John Crerie as one in which \\"her deck was disputed inch-by-inch\\" in a \\"gallant and desperate\\" defense. During the engagement, Royal Marine Captain Thomas Ford was mortally wounded by Captain Samuel Travis of Surveyor in a cutlass duel. Still, outnumbered more than two- to-one, Captain Travis ultimately ordered the ship's surrender. In tribute to the ferocity of Surveyors resistance, Crerie returned Travis' sword to him and he was paroled at Washington, North Carolina on 7 August 1813; the remainder of the crew were transferred to a British prison camp in Halifax, Nova Scotia. Surveyor defends herself from attack by sailors from the Narcissus On 13 July 1814 Narcissus captured Governor Shelby, Captain John H. Hall, was a letter of marque schooner of 184 tons (bm), built at Queen Anne's County, Maryland, in 1812 and commissioned on 11 December 1813. She was armed with three 4-pounder guns and had a crew of 11 men. On 9 October 1814 Narcissus was contacted by HMS Dispatch, which requested support in taking the USRC Eagle, which had run aground in Long Island Sound. Upon returning to the site of Eagle, Narcissus and Dispatch found that the damaged Eagle had been re-floated. Eagle retreated and was beached and her crew moved to the shore to direct musket fire against British barges attempting to attach tow cables to the wrecked hulk. By noon on 13 October, the Royal Navy had managed to take Eagle under tow and she was captured. Fate Narcissus was used as a convict ship from December 1823 until she was sold for breaking up in January 1837.

Howell was an American screenwriter, producer, and assistant director active primarily during the 1930s. She was one of few women to hold an assistant directing position at the time.  Biography  Maude was a Los Angeles native born to John Howell and Mary Tappanier. She attended Stanford University, where she studied theater and acted in plays, graduating in 1911. After graduation, she worked as the drama teacher at Manual Arts High School in Los Angeles before becoming a stage manager at a stock company in Detroit. She became stage manager at George Arliss's company in 1923, and had ambitions of becoming a producer (another position women weren't represented in at the time). She worked with Arliss in the U.S. and in London for five years. During her association with Arliss, who had gotten involved in the motion picture industry, she began writing scripts for the screen. One of her first credited efforts was on the 1930 adaptation of The Green Goddess. She'd also take on work as an assistant director and producer at the company as the decade wore on, due to her longstanding association with Arliss, not always receiving credit for these roles. They both retired by the end of the 1940s, and Howell died in New Orleans, Louisiana, in 1964.

The perpetrators, 17-year-old Guilherme Taucci Monteiro and 25-year-old Luiz Henrique de Castro, both former students at the school, killed five students and two school employees. Before the attack, in a car shop near the school, the pair also killed Monteiro's uncle. After the shooting, Monteiro killed his partner and then committed suicide. The attack was the second major school shooting in Brazil after the Realengo massacre in 2011.  Attack  Earlier in the day, the gunmen shot three times and killed Monteiro's uncle, Jorge Antônio Moraes in a nearby car shop. The two attackers drove to the school in a white Chevrolet Onix that Castro had legally rented at Localiza Hertz. School cameras recorded the attackers entering the school at around 9:40 a.m. local time, one after the other, with a delay of around 10 seconds. Monteiro entered the building first, hiding his face from students while retrieving a hidden gun. He then turned around and began shooting at two school staff members as well as several students at a distance of approximately in front of him, before entering the main patio in search of more potential victims. He disappeared from camera and then moved on to the institution's linguistics center. By this time, Castro appeared on camera entering the building in a hurry while holding several weapons, including a bow which he eventually left on the floor. He approached the corpses lying on the ground and struck them with a hatchet. Fleeing students started to run from the patio towards the school entrance hall. On the way, they encountered Castro, who was still in the entrance hall. Other students who had hidden themselves when they first heard gunshots were able to avoid being shot. Five students between 14 and 17 years old and two school staff members were killed. The school was locked down by police, who searched it and found a bow and arrow, a crossbow, possible Molotov cocktails and a wired bag. A bomb squad was dispatched to the scene and found that it was a fake explosive. Perpetrators The shooters were Guilherme Taucci Monteiro (July 5 or 13, 2001 – March 13, 2019) and Luiz Henrique de Castro (March 16, 1993 – March 13, 2019). Monteiro lived with his grandparents as his mother had addiction problems. Both the attackers had been pupils at the targeted school with Monteiro dropping out of school due to bullying the previous year. The attackers had been close friends since childhood. They had planned the attack for a year and, inspired by the Columbine High School massacre, they hoped the attack would draw more attention than the Columbine massacre. According to some reports, both perpetrators were influenced by Dogolachan, a far-right imageboard known for inciting terrorism and violence where they had been asking for weapons and support. On this imageboard Luiz was known as luhkrcher666 and Guilherme as 1guY-55chaN. In a statement from Monteiro's mother, Monteiro had reportedly been bullied because of his acne. She also stated that he had been harassed by a fellow pupil. A third suspect, not directly involved in the attack, stated that the perpetrators also intended to carry out rapes. The perpetrators might have been influenced by Elephant, a movie about a school shooting in which a murder-suicide between the shooters end the movie. Victims PMESP vehicles on the scene Police at the entrance of the school Police at the school Weapons used in the attack Two victims were school staff members. The first victim to be shot was Marilena Ferreira Vieira Umezu, a pedagogical coordinator. Five high school students were killed, four of whom died in school and one on his way to the hospital. The attack also left eleven students wounded, who were taken to nearby hospitals. Two of these victims, who presented a more serious clinical condition, were transferred to Hospital das Clínicas in São Paulo.

João Doria, governor of São Paulo, canceled his routine activities and flew to Suzano in a helicopter along with Rossieli Soares, the state's Secretary of Education; Colonel Salles, military police commander; and army general João Camilo Pires de Campos. Doria lamented the attack and decreed 3 days of mourning in the state. President Jair Bolsonaro lamented the tragedy and expressed his condolences to the victims' families on a tweet posted 6 hours after the tragedy. Ricardo Vélez Rodríguez, Minister of Education, expressed solidarity: \\"My condolences to the families. I express my contempt towards that demonstration of violence. I'll be closely following the investigation\\". Onyx Lorenzoni, Chief of Staff, also tweeted his condolences. Damares Alves, Minister of Women, Family and Human Rights, lamented the event and offered support by the Ministry. Rodrigo Maia, President of the Chamber of Deputies, expressed his solidarity towards the families of victims and said that \\"it's time for Brazil to unite forces and competences to understand what happened and prevent new massacres like that one from occurring\\". Davi Alcolumbre, President of the Senate, expressed his condolences and tweeted: \\"I hope that the real causes behind that tragedy be discovered\\". As a result of the shooting, many congress members brought the question of gun control back into debate, with some criticizing the relaxation of gun laws. Dias Toffoli, President of the Supreme Federal Court, read a note during an ordinary plenary section on March 13 in which he expressed his solidarity towards the families and friends of the victims and to society as a whole, which \\"is also a victim of that kind of tragedy\\". He also stated: \\"we can't let hatred enter our society\\". The tragedy was followed by Brazilian media and attracted attention of international media including BBC News, Le Figaro, Focus, El País and The Guardian.

By 500 BCE, the ancient Kuru-Panchala realm had already declined and given way to influences from the eastern Magadha region. Greater Magadha is a concept in studies of the early history of India. It is used to refer to the political and cultural sphere that developed in the lower Gangetic plains during the Vedic age. The śramaṇa culture of Greater Magadha developed separately from the orthodox Brahmin-oriented śrauta culture to its west, that was characteristic of the upper Ganges basin (the Ganga-Yamuna doab). The name derives from a later kingdom, Magadha, that arose in the same region after the Vedic period had ended. Overview The concept was developed in a book by the indologist Johannes Bronkhorst (2007), where he defines the region to comprise modern day Bihar and eastern Uttar Pradesh. According to J.D. Long, although the inhabitants of Greater Magadha revered the same deities as the śrauta Brahmins, they developed an ideological opposition to the sacrifice and ritual slaying of animals, even going so far as to regard all violence as undesirable in the path towards liberation (mokṣa or nirvāṇa). Out of the ideological opposition between these two cultural spheres – the orthodox śrauta realm of Kuru-Panchala in the west, and Greater Magadha in the east – developed the two main spiritual ideologies of Vedic India. Śrauta practiced by Brahmanas, which placed a lot of importance on the system of sacrifice and ritual correctness, arose out of the culture of the erstwhile Kuru-Panchala realm, while the śramaṇa tradition, which placed emphasis on the spiritual striving towards liberation, that developed in Greater Magadha, later to give rise to the Buddhism and Jainism.

Monitoring and evaluation (M&E;) of Education for Sustainable Development is widely discussed in literature on ESD, including debates regarding methodology and strategies for interpreting the data.  Purposes and benefits of monitoring ESD  New information, analysis and predictions feed into ‘improve[d] decision making and action- taking’ to guide and reorient programmes. This process increases understanding about the elements necessary to promote ESD learning in a particular context, and can influence other stakeholders. The desired outcome is wider social learning and enhanced ESD knowledge and skills, potentially resulting in diverse activities that promote not just better learning but the ultimate goal of ESD: sustainable living throughout life. A main requirement of effective M&E; in education and learning is clear objectives, also called competencies, which stem from defined concepts in a subject. The more dynamic aspects of ESD cannot be boxed into a measurable definition because they centre on the unknown and the emergent: they revolve around new concepts and ideas produced by learners to help populations confront global issues such as climate change. It is not always possible to know what to monitor because learners are partially leading the process. Differentiating ESD from two subject areas is challenging because it is often lumped together with – its precursor, environmental education (EE), and global citizenship education (GCED), which runs complementarily. There is a governance and accountability angle to M&E; of ESD. It involves verifying that all learners have access, that the process is inclusive and that the learning provided is suitable. At the national level, it is crucial that education authorities be in a position to account for how a significant share of public expenditure (supplemented by sizeable private investment) is ensuring the right of all children, youth and adults to basic educational opportunities that lead to effective and relevant learning. M&E; also accounts ‘for ensuring equal opportunity for post-basic education and training’. Monitoring is not only concerned with learning, but effective learning for all, and therefore operates from a position of social justice. It helps to keep special interests and the marketization of education in check, by regulating the private sector to ‘ensure the application of standards adopted by education professionals working in both public and private sectors’. M&E; aims to protect and uphold access to quality education for all people throughout life by reining in potentially dominant special interest forces.  Historical efforts in ESD monitoring  From 2005 to 2014, UNESCO worked on prioritizing and advancing ESD. Based on United Nations General Assembly Resolution 57/254, the UN Decade of Education for Sustainable Development (DESD) was conceived as a way to foreground principles and practices of sustainability and marry them with education and learning. This marriage aimed to strengthen ESD worldwide with a view to effecting positive, sustainable change in the ways that people – in this case, learners – make choices and live their lives in relationship to others and their local environment, ultimately transforming broader social behaviour and its effects on the planet. The conclusion was that it was necessary to monitor efforts to observe the kind of progress being made. This information could be fed back into the process leading to changes and improvements resulting in better ESD learning. The common practice was to measure ESD through inputs, including the ‘development of strategies, plans, coordinating mechanisms and resources’. This approach reflected a more top-down approach to M&E; often driven by national reporting to international agencies. It was also representative of a belief that inputs inevitably lead to outputs. However, the effect of inputs and throughputs on ESD learning proved difficult to see. This suggested three things: * equating inputs with outputs amounted to a leap of faith, and was not backed up by the evidence. Accordingly, different or a combination of M&E; strategies were needed; * DESD activities were not making an immediately observable difference on the ground; and * more information was needed about the context, educational process and so on. Such input-output thinking often goes hand-in-hand with an overly focused conversation about indicators (which are sometimes presented as the solution in themselves). This mix reflects the balance and tension between translating global and local concerns into goals and targets, and having indicators that help collect information on activities that demonstrate progress towards them. Both are important, as the wider call for sustainable development is a response to overarching, multifaceted (global) problems, such as climate change and specific (local) manifestations and effects on different places for actual people. During the Decade, the DESD Monitoring and Evaluation Expert Group (MEEG) developed various ESD indicators as part of their Global Monitoring and Evaluation Framework. Early involvement of stakeholders and establishing agreed-upon goals will be vital to addressing this indicator development challenge’. Coordination between National Commissions and designated working groups led to various types of indicator development bodies each with different purposes. This strategy resulted in an open and connected process that was part of a larger M&E; scheme. An outcome from the Decade is that many M&E; experts now believe in evaluating programmes and practices at multiple levels and stages of the educational process. Possible multipronged frameworks involve large-scale student assessments and country-level and lower assessments related to contextualized ESD aims and purposes. This may include evaluation of the learning environment focusing on pedagogy and learner engagement, and formative assessments to improve professional practice among teachers through peer engagement.  How countries monitor ESD  Finding data on how countries monitor ESD has proven difficult. References in the literature to country approaches to M&E; invariably follow the model of collecting and analysing policies, capacity-building efforts, implementation, earning objectives, teacher and curriculum, partnerships and networks, and so on. There is little mention of holistic schemes or systems operating in unison. Some instances provide decontextualized discussions about indicators and assessments to evaluate learning outcomes. As these discussions are not part of a larger whole or anchored to country activities, they lose their concrete value and simply amount to a reiteration of oversimplified, input leads-to-output thinking without any information about what happens between inputs and learning outcomes. There are a few examples of studies where M&E; of ESD within countries could have been inquired about and pointed to, but were not for some reason. The United Nations Economic Commission for Europe (UNECE) Initiative on Education for Sustainable Development includes an objective to ‘promote research on and development of ESD. However, the ten- year evaluation report on implementation does not provide examples of monitoring, and notes only that more and better practices are needed. The United Nations University Institute of Advanced Studies (UNU-IAS) and the Institute for Global Environmental Strategies (IGES) collaborated on a research project with the UNESCO Asia and Pacific Regional Bureau for Education on M&E; for ESD in 2011 to 2012. The study covered nine countries in North and Southeast Asia over two rounds of surveys using a mixed-methods approach (both quantitative and qualitative with a bridge connecting the two data sets). Similar to the UNECE report, key input, content and process areas were examined. There is lengthy discussion in the final report about the benefits and deficiencies of monitoring, but an absence of country cases to illustrate these points. Examples of what is described and promoted as good practice can be useful. A publication developed by UNESCO in 2013 entitled National Journeys towards Education for Sustainable Development offers some detail and analysis of M&E; in countries within the five world regions, focusing on: Costa Rica, Morocco, South Africa, Sweden and Viet Nam. In the case of Costa Rica, monitoring is addressed but mostly in relation to sustainable human development through the annual report, State of the Nation. Further leadership is mentioned as a key concern – one that also impacts M&E.; According to the report, Morocco does not appear to have a comprehensive ESD M&E; approach in place, including indicators. Accordingly, the report advocates for using SWOT (strengths, weaknesses, opportunities and threats) to evaluate performance. Versions of this approach are also applied to other country profiles in the report. According to the publication, South Africa has a strong tradition of M&E; in ESD, and implemented the National Environmental Education Project for General Education and Training (NEEP-GET). This is ‘one of the largest, most comprehensive formative monitoring and evaluation (FME) processes’, which focused on ‘contextual monitoring and longitudinal studies, as well as critical appraisals of key issues’. In Sweden, the Institute for Research in Education and Sustainable Development (IRESD) is ‘one of the most expansive and acclaimed research environments for education and sustainable development in Sweden’. However, the report does not provide information on how this links to monitoring ESD. According to the publication, Viet Nam's approach is focused on ‘project based mechanisms and indicators’. This includes manuals and guidelines for M&E; of ESD, and relevant teacher training. Evidence shows that many countries are only getting started. The process of developing holistic, multipronged M&E; systems for tracking ESD is still in the early stages. More needs to be done (and documented) with an emphasis on the driving reason for monitoring ESD in the first place: to gain information to make good decisions about policies, provision, institutional support, resources, and so on, that lead to better ESD learning and, ideally, broader sustainable behavior.

The plant's leaves grow in pairs sometimes clumped together, however the leaves separate in the center and are widely divergent from one another, forming a large fissure between the leaves. This is unlike the majority of its genus, for the leaves tend to grow next to one another without too much separation of most species. The leaves can be colors such as light and dark gray sometimes with tinges of green. The flowers are yellow and can grow to be larger than the leaves themselves. A seed pod will form from the center of the flower if it is pollinated.

A school, housing 100 students, was located on the third story of the building, leading to the story gaining significant coverage in local and international media.  Background  According to Akinwunmi Ambode, the governor of Lagos State, the primary school and nursery had been operating illegally in a residential building. Ambode stated that many buildings in the area were certified \\"distressed\\" and had been marked for demolition, but that landlords resisted the efforts of the government to demolish the buildings, opting to refurbish them for further use. A resident of the area stated that the building in question had been marked for demolition twice before the collapse.  Collapse  The collapse occurred in the Lagos Island district in Lagos, Nigeria at mid-morning on 13 March 2019. The collapsed building—which was slated to be demolished—was in poor condition, but was illegally being used to house commercial businesses, residential apartments, a primary school, and a nursery. The collapse of the structure killed several people and left over 60 people trapped in the rubble; many of those trapped were children from the third floor primary school. Over the next few days, rescue efforts succeed in recovering 45 people from the building, while another 20 were reported as having died in the collapse. According to neighborhood residents, the building was known to be in bad shape, and Ambode confirmed that the bottom two floors of the building had settled. Residents reported that only the absence of many students (who were participating in an out-of-school sporting event) prevented the death toll from being higher.  Effects  Following the collapse of the building, the State Building Control Agency (LASBCA) conducted integrity testing on buildings in the area and found that 150 buildings were in certified structural distress. The LASBCA procured court approval to demolish 80 of these buildings, and began demolition efforts two days following the collapse, giving little warning to residents.

A fact check conducted by ABC News in 2018 found \\"Aboriginal people in Australia have never been covered by a flora and fauna act, either under federal or state law\\". Law professor Helen Irving has identified the \\"Flora and Fauna Act\\" myth as part of a series of myths about the 1967 referendum and the evolution of Aboriginal civil rights in general. Notable incidents Linda Burney, the first Aboriginal woman elected to the New South Wales Legislative Assembly and Australian House of Representatives, incorrectly claimed in her maiden speech in 2003 that she had spent the first ten years of her life under the Flora and Fauna Act. In 2018, actress Shareena Clanton claimed that her mother \\"was not considered a human being until the referendum came through from the Flora and Fauna Act in 1967\\". In July 2020, the Australian Broadcasting Corporation (ABC) published an interview with Victor Bartley, an indigenous man, in which he claimed that he had \\"received a letter back stating I was exempt from national service because I was Indigenous under the National Flora and Fauna Act [...] to this day I still don't know if I'm a kangaroo or a flower\\". The ABC's fact-checking department had concluded in 2018 that \\"Aboriginal people in Australia have never been covered by a flora and fauna act, either under federal or state law\\". Origin Academic and indigenous rights activist Marcia Langton, in speaking to the ABC, said she first heard the term \\"Flora and Fauna Act\\" mentioned by filmmaker Lester Bostock at a council meeting in Canberra in the 1970s. Langton stated that she believed Bostock meant it in a metaphorical sense and she \\"had no idea that this would grow into the urban myth that it is today\\". She went on to say \\"We were not classified under the 'flora and fauna act' but we were treated as animals.\\" According to the Western Australian Museum, the New South Wales National Parks and Wildlife Act 1974 and similar acts in other states may have encouraged the development of the myth, as they included Aboriginal heritage sites in their purview. Before the creation of separate indigenous affairs departments, some states administered the area through combined departments that also dealt with wildlife. For example, Western Australia had a Department of Aborigines and Fisheries (1909–1920) and the federal government had a Department of the Environment, Aborigines and the Arts (1971–1972).

The system used two-needle instruments that presented a display using the same code as that on the optical telegraph of Claude Chappe. The Chappe telegraph was extensively used in France by the government, so this arrangement was appealing to them as it meant there was no need to retrain operators. Most needle telegraph systems moved the needles by means of an electromagnet driven by battery power applied to the line at the sending end. In contrast, the Foy-Breguet telegraph used electromagnets but they did not directly drive the needle. Instead, they operated the detent of a clockwork mechanism which released the needle to move on one position at a time. The Chappe telegraph existed in some other countries, but no country besides France tried to duplicate the Chappe telegraph, or any other optical telegraph, as an electrical telegraph. Generally, each electrical telegraph system had a new code developed specifically to suite it. This was problematic for international communications, and in 1855 France abandoned the Foy–Breguet telegraph in favour of the Morse telegraph to bring them into line with the German–Austrian Telegraph Union. Many central European countries were members of this union and they had adopted the Morse system for better interoperability.  Development  The Foy–Breguet telegraph code The first attempt to bring the electrical telegraph to France was made by Samuel Morse in 1838. He demonstrated his system to the French Academy of Sciences and made a bid for the contract to install a telegraph along the line of the Paris to Saint- Germain railway. However, the French government decided that they did not want to entrust the construction of telegraph lines to private companies. Private operation of telegraph systems had been illegal in France since 1837 and all telegraph infrastructure was owned and operated by the state. Electrical telegraph could only start in France if the government sponsored it. France had the most extensive optical telegraph system of any country, developed for military purposes by Claude Chappe in the revolutionary and Napoleonic periods. There were strong arguments put forward for the superiority of optical telegraphs over electrical telegraphs. Chief amongst these reasons was that electrical systems were vulnerable to attack by saboteurs. In an optical system, only the telegraph stations needed to be defended. An electrical system was impossible to defend over its many hundreds of miles of exposed wires.Holzmann & Pehrson, pp. 92–93 Alphonse Foy, the chief administrator of the French telegraphs, had a further objection to the Morse system. He believed that his illiterate telegraph operators would not easily be able to learn the Morse code. He did not, however, entirely reject the electrical telegraph. After the Morse system was rejected in 1839, Foy investigated the Cooke–Wheatstone telegraph in use in England. Foy realised that the needle telegraph displays used by the Cooke–Wheatstone system could be adapted to display the symbols of the French optical telegraph. He asked Louis-François- Clement Breguet to design such a system. It was first tested on the Paris Saint-Cloud to Versailles line in 1842.Huurdeman, p. 72–73 Funding for an electrical telegraph was approved in 1844. Foy specified that the new telegraph must show the same display as the Chappe telegraph so that there was no need for operator retraining. This required the display to have three moving parts; the Chappe telegraph had a pivoted crossbar (the regulator) with two moveable arms (the indicators), one at each end of the regulator. A design meeting this requirement was submitted by Pierre-Antoine Joseph Dujardin. Implemented as a needle telegraph, the arrangement required three moving needles, which in turn required three signal wires. The wires were a significant part of the cost of installation; the Morse system, for instance, required only one wire.Holzmann & Pehrson, p. 93 In May 1845, Foy ran a comparative test between the Dujardin, Breguet, and Cooke-Wheatstone systems on the Paris, Saint Germain to Rouen line.Huurdeman, p. 73 Foy rejected the Dujardin system in favour of the one by Breguet, even though the Dujardin system more fully mimicked the Chappe system than Breguet's. The Breguet design required only two signal wires, but at the expense of having only two moveable needles. These represented the indicators of the Chappe system. The regulator was simply a marking on the face of the instrument, not a moving part—it was permanently in the horizontal position. The disadvantage of doing this is that it drastically reduced the available codespace which in turn impacted the speed a message could be transmitted.Holzmann & Pehrson, pp. 93–94 The rejection was perhaps due to the economic reason, or perhaps because Breguet was better acquainted with Foy. Breguet had a long history of working with the French telegraph. His grandfather, Abraham-Louis Breguet, a watchmaker, had worked with Chappe on the design of the optical telegraph and Louis inherited the business. The Chappe system used a large codebook with thousands of predetermined phrases and sentences. 92 codepoints were used to specify the line and page of the codebook (see ). There were some early attempts to use a reduced codebook on the Foy–Breguet system, but this was soon dropped in favour of a purely alphabetic code.Holzmann & Pehrson, pp. 93–94 France compared to other countries Many other European countries installed optical telegraphs.Holzmann & Pehrson, p. 179 Napoleon extended the Chappe system into conquered territories.Holzmann & Pehrson, pp. 72–73 Other countries developed their own systems, but none of them were as extensive as that in France.Huurdeman, p. 37 Only the system of Abraham Niclas Edelcrantz in Sweden even came close.Holzmann & Pehrson, p. x Consequently, other nations did not have such a strong desire for backward compatibility as France and were able to move to the electrical telegraph sooner. France was unique in requiring the electrical telegraph to mimic the optical telegraph.Aitken & Foulc, pp. 17–18 Operation An operator's manipulator showing the crank handle and notches The display of Foy–Breguet telegraph instruments consists of two needles each pivoted at its centre. One half of each needle is coloured black and the other half white. The black part of the needles is meant to represent the indicators of the Chappe telegraph. The white part of the needles is ignored. A bar is marked on the faceplate of the instrument between the pivot points of the needles. This is meant to represent the regulator of the Chappe telegraph, but in the Foy–Breguet system it is purely decorative – it does not move. Each needle can take on any one of eight positions, moving in steps of 45°, resulting in a codespace of 8×8=64 codepoints.Shaffner, pp. 325–329 Unlike other needle telegraphs, the motive force that rotates the needles is not provided by the electric current on the telegraph line. Instead, it is provided by a clockwork mechanism that has to be kept wound. The winding keys can be seen in the image of the instrument hanging on chains either side of the instrument face. There is a separate key and a separate mechanism for each needle. When it is desired to wind the mechanism, the key is attached to a square winder situated directly below each needle. When current is applied to one of the telegraph lines, the detent of the corresponding clockwork mechanism is released by means of the armature of an electromagnet and the needle advances by 45°. When the current is cut off the detent is again released and the needle advances a further 45°.Shaffner, pp. 325–328 The current is applied to both the sending and receiving instrument so that the sending operator can view the resulting transmission.Shaffner, pp. 330–331 The operator controls the transmission by means of two manipulators. Each of these manipulators has a crank handle which can be set in any one of eight notched positions corresponding to the eight possible positions of one of the needles. As the crank handle is turned through the notches, the battery is alternately connected and disconnected from the line and the local instrument. Thus, current is alternately applied and removed from the mechanism turning the needles.Shaffner, pp. 329–330 A drawback of the Foy–Breguet system was that it did not use repeaters over long distances. Other major telegraph systems used relays for this purpose and there were efforts to apply this technology to the French system. This was unsuccessful, which meant that the French system had to employ operators to retransmit messages in some places.Shaffner, p. 330 The requirement to provide two lines could not be met, or was not economic to meet, on some routes. A single-needle instrument was developed to fill this need. This instrument was mechanically identical to one half of the two-needle version. In fact, it was possible to use one side only of a two-needle instrument with a single line if desired. The coding was the same on the one-needle device except that the positions of the two indicators of each character were sent sequentially instead of in parallel. This reduced the transmission speed to 16–18 wpm.Shaffner, p. 333  Connection to England  Telegraphy over the England-France submarine cable. Foy–Breguet telegraph in the foreground and Cooke–Wheatstone telegraph in the background. A submarine telegraph cable was laid from England to France by the Submarine Telegraph Company in 1851.Haigh, p. 193 In the UK, the Cooke and Wheatstone telegraph was in use which used a different code.Shaffner, p. 221 This meant that at the English end, both a Foy–Breguet operator and a Cooke–Wheatstone operator were required so that messages could be recoded between the two systems.Roberts, ch. 13 The Foy–Breguet system was faster to send and read (between 24 and 46 wpm) than the Cooke–Wheatstone. A Foy–Breguet operator could instantly see the letter being transmitted from the visual pattern, whereas the Cooke–Wheatstone operator had to count the left and right deviations of the single needle.Shaffner, pp. 331-332  Withdrawal  For a decade France maintained a mixture of optical telegraph and electrical telegraph systems on its network. The Foy-Breguet system ensured that operators could easily be transferred from the optical to the electric systems, although many optical operators (semaphorists) declined to become telegraphists when their lines were updated. The semaphorists were largely rural workers on isolated stations used to taking on the responsibilities of carrying out mechanical repairs by themselves. After all, if the equipment broke down, they no longer had the means to call for assistance. Telegraphists were located in offices with management and service personnel on hand. They were forbidden from attempting any kind of repair and had a more paperwork intensive job. Despite its advantages in the French context, the uniqueness of the French system eventually led to its decline.Shaffner, p. 325Butrica, p. 21 During the 1850s, as international telegraph traffic grew, having different telegraph systems in different countries became increasingly problematic. Direct connections were not possible and operators had to be employed to recode messages crossing borders. The code that was later to become known as International Morse Code was adopted in several countries. It was first used on Hamburg railways and was devised by Friedrich Clemens Gerke. This code was a heavily modified version of the original American Morse code and was known as the Hamburg code or Gerke code.Coe, p. 69 Gerke's code was adopted in 1851 by the German-Austrian Telegraph Union which represented many central European countries.Turnbull, p. 77 In 1855, France also adopted the code and replaced the Foy–Breguet telegraph equipment with the Morse system.Holzmann & Pehrson, p. 94  References   Bibliography  * Aitken, Frédéric; Foulc, Jean- Numa, From Deep Sea to Laboratory 1, John Wiley & Sons, 2019 .

It is a succulent plant native to the desert climate of Southern Africa, where is receives an average yearly rainfall of 464mm. The succulent plant is named after Mortiz Kurt Dinter, a German botanist of the late 19th and early 20th century. He was a collector of exotic succulents and his collection numbered around 8,400 pressed specimens. Description Lithops dinteri has leaves growing in pairs, and those pairs forming clumps of leaves. The leaves are thick, and hardly possess any stem. They have a small gap between them, out of which a yellow flower can blossom. The color of the sand or soil they grow in can determine the color of their lobes. Colors can range from red, to brown, to grey, and to cream. The leaves can also present red dots of the top, varying in number and size from plant to plant. The sides of the leaves are usually a purplish-green.

Over time, these T cells commonly spread throughout the mucosal lining of a portion of the GI tract (particularly the jejunum and ileum of the small intestine), lead to GI tract nodules and ulcerations, and cause symptoms such as abdominal pain, weight loss, diarrhea, obstruction, bleeding, and/or perforation. In 2008, the World Health Organization defined a specific type of lymphoma, enteropathy-associated T cell lymphoma (EATL), as having two different types: EATL type I, a lymphoma occurring in patients with the chronic, autoimmune GI tract disorder, celiac disease, and EATL type II, a similar bowel lymphoma that was not associated with celiac disease. However, subsequent studies found significant clinical, pathologic, and pathophysiological differences between these two types of lymphoma. Consequently, the World Health Organization (2016) redefined these lymphomas as separate entities, terming the celiac disease-associated lymphoma as enteropathy-associted T cell lymphoma (EATL) and the lymphoma not associated with celiac disease as monomorphic epitheliotropic intestinal T cell lymphoma (MEITL). MEITL is only 1/5 to 1/10 as common as EATL. The Organization (2016) also termed a third type of intestinal T cell lymphoma that could not be classified as ATL or MEITL as intestinal T cell lymphoma, not otherwise specified. MEITL is a highly aggressive GI tract lymphoma which typically has had very short survival times following its diagnosis. The disease often occurs in elderly patients who are afflicted with other ailments and consequently have little tolerance for the standard chemotherapy regimens that are used to treat other types of lymphomas. Moreover, these therapeutic regimens have shown little effectiveness in treating MEITL. To date, the best but still only marginally effective therapeutic interventions for the disease have been treatments that incorporatr hematopoietic stem cell transplantation into chemotherapy plus surgical (when needed to treat local bowel issues such as obstruction or perforation) regimens.  Presentation  MEITL has been seen more often in Asians and individuals of Hispanic descent, in males (male to female ratio of ~2 to 1), and in mature or elderly individuals (median age ~60 years). Patients may present with irregular bowel movements, abdominal pain, hematochezia (i.e. the anal passage of fresh blood), B symptoms (i.e. fever, night sweats, weight loss), loss of appetite, and/or bowel perforations and/or obstructions.  Pathophysiology  The malignant T cells in MEITL can be identified by: their expression of cluster of differentiation (i.e. CD) cell surface molecules CD3, CD8, and CD56; by their failure to express CD4, CD5, or CD30; and, in particular, by their overexpression of megakaryocyte-associated tyrosine kinase. They are not infected with the Epstein-Barr virus and therefore do not express this virus's products (e.g. EBER1 or EBER2). In most individuals with the disease, these T cells are γδ rather than αβ T-cells based on their expression of γδ rather than αβ T-cell receptors. They also commonly express cytotoxic T cell activation markers such as TIA1, granzyme B, and perforin and therefore may have derived from or be related to cytotoxic T cell lymphocytes. However, in up to 25% of cases the malignant cells in MEITL also express markers of B cell lymphocytes. Detection of these \\"tumor marker\\" molecules on or in the lymphocytes of diseased tissues is critical for diagnosing MEITL; however, it does not clearly establish the original type of lymphocytes which became MEITL's malignant cells. This issue requires further studies. MEITL is thought to arise from intraepithelial lymphocytes that normally reside in the epithelial lining of the GI tract and over time acquire abnormalities that promote their survival, proliferation, avoidance of the immune system, and thereby malignancy. These cells are not infected with the Epstein-Barr virus and therefore have not become malignant as a consequence of this virus's malignancy-producing effects on lymphocytes as it does in other types of GI tract lymphomas. Rather, the malignant T cells in MEITL bear various genetic abnormalities that may promote their malignancy. Restriction fragment length polymorphism studies indicate that these cells have abnormal gains in minisatellites, i.e. repetitive small DNA sequences, in chromosomes 1, 5, 7, 8, 9, 13, 16, and 18. These minisatellites disrupt the production of some genes but the potential relevancies of these disruptions have not been defined. Genetic abnormalities commonly found in MEITL that do have potentially pro-malignant effects include: * Losses on the short (i.e. \\"p\\") arm around position 21.3 on one of the two inherited chromosomes 9. This results in a loss of heterozygosity for two genes, the CDKN2A gene which encodes cyclin-dependent kinase Inhibitor 2A, a protein that regulates cell proliferation and the CDKN2B gene which encodes multiple tumor suppressor 2, a protein that regulates cell death and tumor formation. * A similar loss of heterzygosity on the p arm of chromosome 17 at positions 12 through 13.2. This results in the loss of one of the inherited TP53 genes. TP53 encodes tumor suppressor p53, a protein that regulates cell proliferation, death, and tumor formation. * Mutations in JAK-STAT signaling pathway genes (i.e. JAK3 and STAT5B). This pathway regulates cell proliferation, death, and tumor formation. * Mutations in MAPK/ERK pathway genes (i.e. BRAF and KRAS). This pathway regulates cellular proliferation. * Mutations in the GNA12 gene. This gene encodes Gα12, a G alpha subunit that is required for stimuli to regulate cell function through Gα12-coupled receptors. * Mutations in the chromatin remodeling gene, SETD2. This gene encodes SET domain containing 2, a protein that acts to reduce the occurrence of gene deletions and tumor formation. * Mutations in the CREBBP gene. This gene encodes CREB-binding protein, a protein that activates various transcription factors some of which are implicated in tumor development. * Increased expression of the Myc proto- oncogene. When over-expressed, this genes product, the transcription factor, MYC, stimulates other genes to make their products, some of which stimulate cell proliferation. Further studies are required to determine which, if any, of these genetic abnormalities play a role in the development and/or progression of MEITL and therefore are therapeutic targets for treating the disease.  Diagnosis  The symptoms of MEITL are generally non-specific. The diagnosis depends on endoscopic findings in the GI tract, histological findings on biopsied specimens from involved areas of the GI tract, evidence of disease involvement outside of the GI tract, and the differentiation of MEITL from other GI tract lymphomas and benign lymphoproliferative diseases. Endoscopy typically shows multiple raised and/or ulcerated lesions involving the jejunum or ileum, and less commonly, the duodenum, stomach, or colon. These lesions may occur at multiple sites or spread throughout large areas of the GI tract. Biopsied tissues show abnormally broad intestinal villi caused by the infiltration of sheets of uniformly-sized lymphocytes. These lymphocytes may also infiltrate and disrupt the architecture of nearby intestinal crypts and the epithelial lining. Unlike celiac disease-associated EATL, the lesions usually have little evidence of inflammatory cells (particularly lymphoplasmacytoid cells, i.e. cells showing a mixture of B cell and plasma cell morphological features) or of infiltration of the epithelium lining by the types of lymphocytes seen in celiac disease. The lymphocytes in these lesions are T cells expressing the marker molecules and genetic abnormalities given in the above Pathophysiology section. CT scans commonly reveal involvement of mesenteric lymph nodes. Advanced cases have involvement of the bone marrow and/or dissemination into other organs.  Differential diagnosis  MEITL must be differentiated from the following GI tract disorders with which it shares some common features. * Enteropathy-associated T cell lymphoma (EATL): By definition, MEITL differs from EATL in that EATL specifically occurs in patients with celiac disease. In cases where the presence of celiac disease is not obvious, EATL is differentiated from MEITL by: its occurrence primarily in individuals of Northern European descent, the presence of inflammatory plasmacytoid cells in its lesions, by the tendency of its lesions to consist of γδ rather than αβ T-cell receptor-expressing lymphocytes, by its T cells that express CD30 but not CD56 or megakaryocyte- associated tyrosine kinase. and by most (95%) individuals with EATL being of either the HLA-DQ2 or HLA-DQ8 rather than other HLA-DQ haplotypes. * Extranodal NK/T cell lymphoma, nasal type (ENKTCL-NT): ENKTCL-NT is a lymphoma that usually involves nasal and oropharyngeal airways but may involve lower areas of the GI tract with lesions that micmc MEITL. Unlike MEITL, it is more commonly due to the proliferation of NK rather than T cell lymphocytes, in all cases is caused by lymphocytes that are infected with the Epstein-Barr virus and therefore express this virus's products, and in almost all cases is caused by lymphocytes that do not express CD3 and have not rearranged their T cell receptors. * Anaplastic large cell lymphoma, ALK positive (ALCL,ALK+): ALCL,ALK+ is a subtype of anaplastic large cell lymphoma. It commonly involves the malignant proliferation of T cells in tissues outside of the GI tract but in some cases the disease involves primarily the GI tract. Unlike MEITL, ALCL,ALK+ occurs most commonly in young individuals and individuals from Western Countries and most often involves tissue infiltrates of large, anaplastic-appearing T cells which express a fusion gene involving the ALK gene (which encodes Anaplastic lymphoma kinase), but do not express CD3, CD8, or CD56. * Peripheral T-cell lymphoma not otherwise specified (PTCL-NOS): PTCL-NOS is a heterogenous group of T cell lymphomas that involves lymph nodes, bone marrow, liver, spleen, and/or GI tract. Rarely this lymphoma may present in the GI tract without overt evidence of involvement of other tissues. Unlike MEITL, the T cells in this disease exhibit genetic abnormalities in TET2, IDH2, DNMT3A, RHOA, CD28, and VAV1 genes but in general do not have the genetic abnormalities or express the molecular markers found in MEITL. * Natural killer cell enteropathy (NKCE): NKCE is a benign disease of the GI tract which has GI tract lesions and symptoms that mimic MEITL. Unlike MEITL, NKCE involves the proliferation of non-clonal NK cell lymphocytes which exhibit activation markers (e.g. granzyme B, perforin, and T-cell intracellular antigen-1) but no genetic abnormalities. * Indolent T cell lymphoproliferative disorder of the gastrointestinal tract (ITCLD-GT): ITCLD-GT is a generally benign disease of the GI tract that has in some cases progressed to an aggressive lymphoma. It presents with clinical signs and GI tract lesions which may mimic MEITL. These lesions involve infiltrations of T-cells that unlike the T cells in MEITL proliferate slowly, are homogenously small-sized, CD56-negative, may express CD4, and usually do not express CD8.  Treatment  There is no standard treatment for MEITL. Most individuals have been treated by surgical resections of involved areas with or without anthracycline-based chemotherapy. In these cases, responses have been short- lived and/or poor with 1 year overal survival rates, 1 year progression free survival rates, and median survival times of 36%, 21%, and 7 months, respectively. A retrospective study of patients treated with resection, chemotherapy and autologus hematopoietic stem cell transplantation had a higher 1-year and 5-year overall survival (100%, 33%) compared to one-year survival (73%) and five-year survival (14%) without transplantation; a second retrospective study supported the usefulness of transplantation in that high- dose lymphoma chemotherapy followed by transplantation and standard-dose lymphoma chemotherapy with or without surgical resection increased 5-year overall survival from 22 to 60% and 5-year disease progression-free survival from 22 to 52%. While further studies, particularly randomized controlled trials, are needed to investigate the best treatment(s) for MEITL, the use of lymphoma chemotherapy, hematopoietic stem cell transplantation, and, where needed, surgical resections are the currently recommended treatments for MEITL.

Sidoo played for the University of British Columbia Thunderbirds, and is an inductee in the UBC Sports Hall of Fame and the BC Football Hall of Fame. In 2019 the FBI named Sidoo as one of several parent perpetrators in the 2019 college admissions bribery scandal, and he later pleaded guilty to mail fraud conspiracy. On July 15, 2020, Sidoo was sentenced to 90 days in prison, one year supervised release and a $250,000 fine. Sidoo reported to SeaTac Federal Dentention Center on September 23, 2020.  Early life  Sidoo is of Indian- Canadian descent and grew up in New Westminster, B.C., the son of a sawmill- working immigrant father from Punjab in northern India and a stay-at-home mother. From 1978-1982, he attended the University of British Columbia on a football scholarship. At UBC, he played for the school's team, the Thunderbirds. After graduating university, Sidoo was drafted into the Canadian Football League, becoming the first Indian-Canadian to have been by a CFL.team. He played professional football in the CFL.for the Saskatchewan Roughriders and BC Lions from 1983 to 1988.\\"Vancouver's David Sidoo Named in U.S. College Admissions Scandal\\" - Bloomberg After retiring from football, Sidoo started working in the field of brokerage. Sidoo later was one of the founding members who sold an energy company, American Oil & Gas, to the Hess Corporation. At the start of 2019, Sidoo was the CEO of Advantage Lithium, a mining company.  Philanthropy  Sidoo is known for his philanthropic work in British Columbia, through his personal contributions and the charitable organisations founded by his family through there various business ventures. In recognition of his charitable work, Sidoo received the Order of British Columbia this past July and the Queen Elizabeth II Diamond Jubilee Medal and the Non-Resident Indian Award in 2012. In 2015, Sidoo created the 13th Man Foundation supporting the UBC Football program. The 13th Man Foundation is dedicated to providing student-athletes of UBC with exceptional athletic and academic opportunities. In 2015 the foundation donated $800,000 to setup the UBC Football Academic Centre. Located just steps away from Thunderbird Stadium, the UBC Football Academic Centre provides a space for all players to receive academic tutoring and advising. With more than 1,800-square-feet of multi-functional space, the centre is also used for team meetings, game preparation and academic supervision. The facility will help ensure the success of current players and serve as an essential tool in the recruitment of top student-athletes who visit the Point Grey campus in hopes of suiting up for the Thunderbirds Football program. The Sidoo Family Athletics Endowment, which dispenses aid to student athletes, is the largest of its kind at UBC, where Sidoo served on the board of governors.  Legal issues  In March 2019, Sidoo was named as one of the alleged parent perpetrators of the 2019 college admissions bribery scandal. Multiple sources reported on allegations Sidoo had paid money to illegally aid his two sons in getting accepted into American colleges. As alleged in the FBI indictment, Sidoo paid $100,000 to have a test-taker impersonate his older son, so that the latter's SAT test scores were improved. The scores were sent to Chapman University, which his son later attended. According to the FBI, Sidoo paid an additional $100,000 to have his younger son's test taken in the same, fraudulent way. CBC News later reported that Sidoo had also paid a test-taker to fake a high school exam on behalf of his son in 2012. The affected scores were sent to Yale, Georgetown and the University of California, Berkeley, the latter of which his younger son eventually attended. The FBI indictment noted that Sidoo had been in contact with other perpetrators of the college admission scandal in 2018, and in October of that year recorded a phone call in which Sidoo discussed obtaining a GMAT score for his older son, who intended to apply to business school. Sidoo pleaded not guilty before a federal court in Massachusetts on 15 March 2019. In light of the 2019 college admissions bribery scandal, Sidoo stepped down as the CEO of Advantage Lithium, East West Petroleum, and Seaway Energy Services. Sidoo also resigned as a director of American Helium, Meridius Resources Ltd., Liberty Defense Holdings Ltd., and National Green Biomed Ltd. in mid-March 2019. Sidoo pleaded guilty to fraud in the aforementioned matter on March 13, 2020. The sentencing took place on July 15, 2020, and he was sentenced to 90 days in prison, one year supervised release and a $250,000 fine.

Heremans is a condensed matter experimental physicist at The Ohio State University where he holds titles as Ohio Eminent Scholar and Professor in the Department of Mechanical and Aerospace Engineering, with courtesy appointments in the Department of Physics and Department of Materials Science and Engineering.CV in Ohio State He is a member of the National Academy of Engineering and fellow of the American Physical Society and the American Association for the Advancement of Science. His research focuses on magneto- transport, thermal, and thermoelectric properties of electrons, phonons, and spin in narrow-gap semiconductors, semimetals, and nanostructures. Prior to OSU, Professor Heremans worked as a research scientist and research manager at GM Research Lab from 1984-1998 and the Delphi Research Labs (1999-2005), where he developed tunable IR diode lasers and magnetic sensors. Education Prof. Heremans was educated at the École Polytechnique de Louvain, the college of engineering of the Catholic University of Louvain (Université Catholique de Louvain) where he received Bachelor of Science degree in Electrical Engineering (Ingénieur Civil Electricien) in 1975 followed by a Doctor of Applied Sciences degree (Docteur en Sciences Appliquées) in Applied Physics in 1978. His Ph.D. training included a Research Fellowship with the Belgian Institute for Research in Industry and Agriculture (IRSIA). Following his formal education, Prof. Heremans worked as invited postdoctoral scientist, including at the Oersted Institute at the University of Copenhagen, where he worked under the direction of Prof. Ole P. Hansen, the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, where he worked under the direction of Prof. Millie Dresselhaus, and the Institute for Solid State Physics at the University of Tokyo, where he worked under the direction of Prof. Seichi Tanuma. Concurrently with these postdoctoral assignments, he worked as a researcher for the Fonds National Belge de la Recherche Scientifique. Career and research Prof. Heremans’ research involves experimental investigation of electron, magnon, and phonon transport properties; narrow-gap semiconductor physics (primarily InSb, PbTe, and BiSb alloys), semimetals (primarily bismuth and graphite), and nanostructures. His early work at GM focused on PbTe-based infrared diode lasers and other properties of semiconductors (e.g. he showed that molten carbon is a metal). In the 1990s, Prof. Heremans developed the geometrical magnetoseebeck and magnetoresistance effects, the latter of which resulted in commercial position sensors used on crank and camshafts by GM. In the early 2000s, his work on quantum wires resulted in the discovery of large thermopowers due to size-quantization effects. In 2008, his team published evidence that resonant levels increase the thermoelectric figure of merit, zT, in PbTe by distorting the electronic density of states. The focus of his laboratory switched to spin caloritronic effects around 2010. In 2012, his team published data proving the giant spin-Seebeck effect in a non-magnetic material; they demonstrated that the giant spin-Seebeck effect in InSb is as large as the largest thermopower values ever measured. In 2015, his team published experimental proof that phonons in diamagnets respond to magnetic fields, proving that heat and sound can be controlled magnetically. In a recent review paper, he outlines the difficulties in obtaining truly electrically insulating topological insulators. Most recently, he and several colleagues developed goniopolar materials, materials that, due to the specific shape and topology of their Fermi surface, display simultaneous n- and p-type behavior of the same charge carriers, depending on the direction and type of measurement. In his career, he has published over 250 publications in refereed journals and conference proceedings. These publications have been cited over 11,000 times, with his most-cited paper \\"Enhancement of Thermoelectric Efficiency in PbTe by Distortion of the Electronic Density of States,\\" which has been cited more tha 1800 times. He has been issued 39 U.S. patents and co- edited two books. Honors and awards In 1987, Prof. Heremans was named fellow of the American Physical Society for his pioneering work in the thermal conductivity of low-dimensional materials and electronic magnetostriction; and for the study of electronic and thermal properties of narrow-gap semiconductors, semimetals, and graphite intercalation compounds. In 2011, he was named fellow of American Association for the Advancement of Science, and he was elected to the National Academy of Engineering in 2013. Prof. Heremans has won several awards at OSU: the Clara M. and Peter L. Scott Award for Excellence in Engineering Education (2014), the Lumley Interdisciplinary Research Award (2013, 2019), the Lumley Award (2010), the Innovators Award (2010), and the Inventor of the Year Award (2011). At General Motors he was the recipient of the Charles L. McCuen Award (1994), the John M. Campbell Award (1989) and the Boss Kettering Award (1994). At Delphi he was elected to the Inventors Hall of Fame (1999), Gold Level (2004), and won the Scientific Excellence Award (2003).

Synopsis In the present day, a woman is walking with her dog when she comes across a skull buried in the ground. She digs up two skeletons, side by side. In 1820, Otis \\"Cookie\\" Figowitz is a quiet chef traveling with a group of fur trappers in the Oregon Territory. Contrary to Cookie's gentle and quiet demeanor, the fur trappers are loud and aggressive, harassing Cookie for not bringing them enough food while scavenging. One night, he comes across King-Lu, a Chinese immigrant on the run for killing a Russian man. They have a pleasant conversation and Cookie, having made a friend, allows Lu to hide in his tent for the night and watches him escape across the river the next day. When the group reaches Fort Tillicum, Cookie receives his pay and leaves the group of fur trappers. He goes to a bar where a man harasses another patron. The patron, having brought his infant son, asks Cookie to watch the baby while he fights the man who harasses him. All of the patrons leave the bar to go watch the fight except Cookie and another man, who is revealed to be Lu. Cookie and Lu are delighted to see each other again and Lu invites Cookie to his shack. Cookie is initially hesitant to go as he agreed to watch the man's baby, but Lu convinces him to leave. They spend several days together at the shack and bond. Lu talks about his past traveling the world and Cookie talks about his ambitions, saying that he would like to one day open either a bakery or a hotel in San Francisco. Cookie learns of the first ever milk cow being brought into the territories to service Chief Factor, a wealthy English man with the only proper house in the settlement. According to rumors in the bar, he intends to use the cow's milk only for his tea. The cow's mate and calf died on its journey to Oregon, making it the only cow. Cookie sees that the cow is left out in the open by Factor's property and reminisces on his days as a baker's assistant and tells Lu about how he would like some of the cow's milk as he could use it to make baked goods, such as cookies and biscuits. Lu suggests that they steal the cow's milk at night when it isn't being watched. Together they come up with a plan to sneak onto Factor's property, with Cookie milking the cow and Lu keeping watch from a tree, being ready to signal in case anything goes wrong. While milking the cow, Cookie forms a bond with it, expressing sympathy for the cow losing its mate and calf. They manage to get enough milk to bake a batch of biscuits without being caught. While Cookie is unsatisfied with the result, wishing it could be sweeter, Lu points out that it tastes better than any food the outpost has and that it could easily sell for a lot of money. They take their biscuits to the market and offer to sell them. When asked how they're made, Lu claims it's a \\"Chinese secret\\" and doesn't say much else. The biscuits become popular instantly and they sell out their first batch within minutes. In the days that follow, lines begin to form for people to try their biscuits. Cookie works on the recipe by adding honey and Lu works on his sales technique. A boy who works for Factor and watches the cow attempts to buy a biscuit, but he is cut in line and barely misses his chance to try the last one of the day. One day, they are asked to reserve at least one biscuit for Factor, who has become aware of their business and is intrigued. Factor buys one and loves it, complimenting Cookie on his baking and saying that it reminds him of London. While Cookie is flattered by Factor's compliments, Lu becomes wary, believing that Factor will recognize the taste of his milk. Factor asks Cookie to make a clafoutis for an upcoming meeting he has with a local captain and a Native American chief. At the meeting, Factor offers tea with cream to the captain, remarking that despite the high quality breed of his milk cow, it is producing very little milk, which puts both Cookie and Lu on edge. He takes the captain, the chief, Cookie and Lu to see the cow. The cow recognizes Cookie and nuzzles him, causing the two men to become more alert. After this meeting, Cookie wants to end the business and move on with Lu, but Lu wants to sell one more batch of biscuits, saying that they just need a little more money before they're ready to move on, arguing that Factor is a fool who is still completely unaware of their plans. Cookie reluctantly agrees and they go back the next night to milk the cow one more time. A man living inside of Factor's estate happens to walk outside that night. Lu, seeing him, attempts to signal to Cookie that the plan has gone wrong. While learning on the branch in an attempt to get Cookie's attention, the branch snaps. Cookie leaves the cow, knocking over the milk in the process, and goes to check on Lu. The man who went outside sees the noise and alerts everyone in the house, believing that they are under attack. Cookie and Lu run off and after a quick inspection of the yard, the captain finds the overturned milk bucket and the stool Cookie used, deducing that someone has been stealing Factor's milk. Factor realizes that Cookie and Lu are the ones responsible and declares that he intends to kill them. A hunt ensues and Factor and his men corner Cookie and Lu at a cliff by the river. Cookie and Lu split up after Lu jumps in the river and swims away in an attempt to escape while Cookie instead hides in nearby bushes. Cookie tries to run away after Factor's men leave but falls down a hill and sustains a head injury. He wakes up in a shack owned by a native American couple, saying that he needs to find his friend. Meanwhile, Lu hires a man who owns a canoe to take him downstream. He eventually returns to the shack, intent on taking the money from the tree they have hid it in. He hides after seeing Factor's security arrive at the shack and destroy it, seeing that they believe the shack to be abandoned. After they leave, he retrieves the money from the tree. Cookie regains his strength and returns to the shack. He walks by the cow, which is now surrounded by a fence. Unbeknownst to him, the boy who watched the cow and was denied the last biscuit saw him, and begins to follow him by himself while carrying a gun. Lu and Cookie reunite at the shack. When they reunite, Lu recommends they get a ride on the nearest boat going south. Cookie, still suffering from his head injury, has difficulty keeping up while Lu encourages him to keep going, both of them unaware that they are being followed by the boy. Eventually Cookie lies down, his injury getting worse. Lu clutches the bag of money for a moment, seemingly considering leaving Cookie. However, he instead chooses to lie down beside him, saying that they will be safe there. They both lie down in the same position as the skeletons found in the opening.

He had assembled immense collections of antique jewellery, rings, wine glasses, snuffboxes, stamps. He took a prominent part in both local and national politics, serving on the Local Board and its successor the Urban District Council, founding the Frome Art School and helping to create the Frome Literary and Scientific Institution (now the Frome Museum). He worked with the leading bronze sculptors of his day. Note: A number of misapprehensions as to Singer's statuary output exist both in books and on the web. The following works have no connection with Singer's art foundry in Frome: Eros in Piccadilly Circus, the lions in Trafalgar Square or Peter Pan in Kensington Gardens.  Early life  John Webb was born in Frome, Somerset as the only son of Joseph Singer by his second wife. Joseph was an architect and builder, though he was listed as a mason at his son's birth, living in the Butts, and as a carpenter on a daughter's birth in 1820. John Webb was named after his uncle, a farmer at Roddenberry near Longleat, who had been murdered six years before. His father died when he was 3, leaving his widow destitute with six children. His family were not well off, as he received his education from the Frome Blue Coat Charity School, as a ‘hat boy’, meaning he was of charity status, educated at the expense of the trustees. Opposite his family home in the Butts, Frome was a foundry for casting bells. He made an unsuccessful attempt to cast a toy cannon in iron, but failing that made it of lead. In 1834 he was apprenticed for five years to a local watchmaker, Thomas Pitt. He managed his employer's business in Eagle Lane, just off Bath Street, and took it over in his own right as a watchmaker, clockmaker and jeweller in 1848.  The first metalwork  In October 1843 he married Arabella Kenwood (c1830-1909) in Frome. They had a son, Kenwood John, who died in infancy. In September 1846 they had a daughter, Ellen Mabel (1846-1936). His wife died In February 1848. Later in 1848 he was asked by a local vicar to make a pair of candlesticks. In 1851 Singer attended the Great Exhibition, observing the range of products and styles available to him; he had his own elaborate and decorative designs on display. In that same year he moved into 25 Market Place, a larger and more public display for his watchmaking business, at the same time as providing workshops for his church work and living quarters for himself and soon afterwards his family. The name 'Singer' is still visible, engraved on the window above the door lintel. Two forges in nearby Justice Lane and more workshops in Eagle Lane just behind no 25 were established. In January 1852 he married Sarah Doswell from nearby Beckington. Between 1853 and 1862, they had three children, sons Walter Herbert and Edgar Ratcliffe and daughter Amy Mary. J W SingerIn that same period of his family life, his business expanded greatly. A major contract was with the Reverend J W E Bennett, who had taken over the parish church of St John the Baptist in 1852, which was then in a state of disrepair. They both were in favour of ornate church décor in the Gothic Revival style that originated with the Oxford Movement and Pugin. Singer's craftsmen were kept busy for four years; much of the brass is still in the church today. Elsewhere large altar crosses may be seen in the cathedral churches of Madras, Ripon, Gloucester and Salisbury. In his obituary in the Somerset Standard in 1904 it was stated that over 600 churches were lit by candle, oil and gas, including Bristol Cathedral, on fixtures from his foundry. In 1866 Singer acquired a new permanent site for a factory in Cork Street, setting up a new furnace and recruiting craftsmen from Belgium, France and Switzerland. He re-introduced into England the process of repoussé. Among these new recruits were sand- moulders; their skills were deployed in castings for the ecclesiastical side of the business, but then proved invaluable when statuary was requested when sand-casting was essential. > \\"Mr J W Singer, of the Market Place, Froome, has been engaged, for the last > twelve years, in the manufacture of medieval metal work, in silver, brass, > and iron, which has been principally employed for ecclesiastical purposes. > Nearly one hundred places of worship and other public edifices have been > supplied by him......Hundreds of candlesticks, etc., of exquisite > workmanship, have been sent to Oxford alone, where they are extensively used > in the Colleges. Mr Singer is at present engaged in manufacturing enamelled > medieval jewellery in silver....From fifteen to twenty hands are generally > employed....The articles mostly manufactured are altar-rails and standards, > gates, and candlesticks....The great merit of Mr Singer's productions is the > variety and taste of his designs, all of which are the result of his own > genius....\\" On one occasion a local, titled lady brought back some brasswork from Italy and inquired Singer of its antiquity. He replied “Only about five or six months”. It had been cast in his foundry and sent to Italy.Frome Museum, Document DB 4737 D8388, Notes for an exhibition in 2001 He travelled extensively on the continent throughout his working life, partly to add to his magpie collections of jewellery, partly to study alternative techniques and designs. His work was shown at international exhibitions to general acclaim: Paris 1855, Manchester 1857, London 1862, Paris 1867, London 1871 and 1872. In 1864 he founded the Frome Art School, using his own home for the first classes, visiting the South Kensington Art Schools in London for guidance on syllabus and exams. He wanted to apprentice pupils from the Frome Blue Coat School, needing artist craftsmen, skilled in creative design and not just in mechanical production. The project ultimately failed under economic pressures; he was innovating well in advance of the Arts & Crafts Movement under the leadership of Morris and Ruskin. In 1902 his educational foresight led to the School of Art and Science, built in Park Road, which ultimately formed the core of the later Technical College. Singer was much engaged in public service. He enrolled in the Frome Volunteers in 1860, when a war with France seemed likely. He served for twenty years and became a Colour Sergeant. He was a Trustee of the Frome Charities. He was elected to the Local Board in 1882 and again in 1888. At the Keyford Asylum, he donated money for girls of good character to receive a marriage portion. As a former pupil of the Blue School, he gave money for boys to learn swimming at the newly opened Victoria Jubilee Public Baths. He wrote articles for the local newspapers on the lives and deeds of leading people of his day and in the past: he called them 'Frome Worthies'.  In the family  All of three children from his second marriage went to the South Kensington Art Schools, studying under the sculptor, Dalou. Walter Herbert (1853-1922) was awarded a travelling scholarship from the Goldsmiths Company and won several prizes: Paris 1878, London 1881 and Melbourne 1881. Edgar Radcliffe (1857-1947), his second son, kept a sketchbook of work he had seen in the South Kensington Museum, today known as the Victoria and Albert Museum, from which many designs found themselves into work at the foundry. His daughter, Amy Mary (1862-1941) was the artist of the Digby Memorial in Sherborne, Dorset: this is an ornate stone cross with four bronze figures of St Aldhelm, Bishop Roger, Abbot Bradford and Walter Raleigh. She studied further in Paris at the Académie Colarossi. Amy shared a studio with Camille Claudel who came to stay with the Singer family in Frome in 1886. Rodin was Amy and Camille’s patron. He gave them lessons and critiqued their work. There is a letter from Singer to Rodin in the Musee Rodin archive thanking him for this. There is a photo of Camille and the Singer family outside North Hill Cottage where they lived from the early 1880s. Amy exhibited five times at the Royal Academy Summer Exhibition from 1882 - 1887, mostly in terracotta, the last being a bust of her future father-in-law. In 1889 in St John’s Church Amy married Fountain Elwin who had exhibited a sculpture at the RA; he was a direct descendant of Pocahontas.  Monumental works  Onslow Ford's statue of General Gordon seated on a camel In 1888 Singer was invited to attend a meeting of leading sculptors, including Hamo Thornycroft, Onslow Ford and Thomas Brock, who were concerned about the quality of work of British foundries compared with those of France or Belgium. He told them he had recently added a new statue area to his existing works. He was capable of creating large sand castings. Critically he could offer the 'lost wax' or cire perdue method of casting which was needed for detail - a method then almost unknown in England - which he had learned from the continent and from the craftsmen he had brought to Frome. This method of reproduction allowed for fine delineation of faces and hands as well as feature work. Almost immediately his order book expanded. Thornycroft asked Singer to cast a panel for a statue of General Gordon destined for Melbourne. This was exported in March 1889. Singer then cast a large equestrian statue by Hems of William III for the Clifton Street Orange Hall in Belfast. Even taller was a statue of General Gordon on a camel, an ambitious project which necessitated raising the roof of the workshop. Thereafter it was known as the 'Camel Shed'. Onslow Ford created the plaster form; it had highly complex elements: a refined face, ornamented jacket, a rattan cane, intricate saddlebag tassels and the camel's harness, all requiring the 'lost wax' method. It stands at the Royal Engineers Barracks at Chatham Dockyard. A copy by another bronze founder once stood in Khartoum; shortly after Sudan achieved its independence, the statue was removed and reinstalled at Gordon's School, near Woking in 1959. Frederic Lord Leighton: \\"The Sluggard\\", Victoria and Albert Museum\\"The Sluggard\\" by Frederic Leighton became very important for Singer. A life-sized bronze, also known as \\"Athlete awakening from sleeping\\", was first exhibited in 1886 at the Royal Academy. From 1890 Singer produced reduced-scale versions in bronze, organised by Arthur Collie, one of the first people to sell reductions of large works. It became one of the most reproduced statuettes of the time; it was still in the Singer trade catalogue of 1914. Brock's statue of Richard Owen (1895) still occupies a space in the Natural History Museum that Owen created; once in the Main Hall, it was moved in 2009 to accommodate one of Darwin, his scientific rival. Another major statue was that of \\"Cromwell\\", again by Thornycroft, placed outside the Palace of Parliament. Singer delivered the statue on time in 1898, but the then Prime Minister, Lord Roseberry delayed the unveiling till the following year, concerned about demonstrations. Instead, it proved to be exceptionally popular. In the same year Alfred Drury's controversial eight Leeds nymphs were installed. Then Thornycroft's massive statue of \\"King Alfred\\" was unveiled in Winchester for the millennial commemoration of his death, 17 foot high from the base to the top of his arm. \\"Boadicea and her Daughters\\", Singer's most well-known piece has a complex history. The project was begun back in 1850 by Thornycroft's father, Thomas. By 1870 it was largely complete, special attention being paid to the outlines, avoiding drapery that would confuse the outline at a distance. Both Hamo Thornycroft and his mother, Mary also worked on it. His father died in 1885. When the London County Council decided to open the supposed tumulus of her burial on Parliament Hill in 1894, Thornycroft proposed that a statue be erected on the site, submitting his father's plaster model as evidence: > \\"I should like to point out that the group is not only a monument to > Boadicea, but also to 'British pluck', which in this group is shown with so > much force as to appeal at once to all who examine it.....My father's group > has a tale to tell to men unborn....\\". At first Thornycroft contributed £100 to the estimated cost of £6000. In the end he paid £2000 for the whole casting by Singer. When the Society of Antiquaries rejected the tumulus as Boadicea's burial place, a new site was proposed on the Embankment, on the south-west end of Westminster Bridge where the statue stands today, after the final assembly on site in 1902. Boadicea group; the Elizabeth Tower or 'Big Ben' behind.The Iceni queen is now more properly named Boudica, or Boudicca as Tacitus wrote her name, rather than Boadicea. This was a complex piece for Singer: Boudica herself with a spear, her other arm upraised, two crouching daughters with bared breasts, two horses reinless, a chariot, scythes on both wheels. As part of Queen Victoria's Jubilee celebrations in 1897, Albert Parrott, a manager at Morris Singer, recalled his memories as a nine year old in Frome: > \\"I was fascinated by the team of five horses trying to pull the bronze > casting of one of the horses up the steep incline leading from the centre of > the town......On a wagon in the same procession one of the casters from the > J. W. Singer & Sons foundry was busy pouring molten zinc into a steel die > carrying an impression of Her Majesty to produce medallions. The die was > mounted on a platform.....as fast as the medals were poured, down came the > guillotine to cut off the runners. The medals slid down a chute at the back > of the wagon, the natives of Frome burning their hands scrambling for them > as souvenirs.\\"  Collections  J W Singer was a phenomenal collector of all kinds of things: rare and antique jewellery (15 collections in total, three of which he gave to the South Kensington Museum, now the Victoria and Albert Museum), rings (some 400 from 17th - 18th centuries), wine glasses (700+), snuffboxes, stamps, china, pottery, bookplates, chatelaines. He had a fine collection of cacti, winning a prize in 1894 at the Royal Horticultural Society for a display of 160 plants. The V & A have examples from the jewellery collection he bequested to them, and examples of metalwork that they bought from him on display in the Jewellery and Metalwork galleries (the metalwork is older and not cast by Singer’s but from his collection). Apart from \\"The Sluggard\\" (see illustration above), the V & A have three fine examples of products from his workshops: an alms dish, a wall sconce designed by Herbert and Edgar and a large brass pricket candlestick; these are not currently on display, except in the online catalogue.  Legacy  After the death of J W Singer in 1904 at Knoll House in Gentle Street, his two sons, Herbert and Edgar took charge of the firm, under the continuing and colourful chairmanship of William Bull. The statuary work continued, including noteworthy castings: Thornycroft's \\"Gladstone\\" in the Strand, Pomeroy's \\"Justice\\" on the Old Bailey, Fehr's fantastical Welsh Dragon on the top of Cardiff's City Hall and eight large lions for the Cecil Rhodes Memorial in Cape Town, South Africa. 150 lion's head bronze mooring rings, designed by Gilbert Bayes, were installed in 1910 along the Thames Embankment beside the County Hall. Other works include \\"Hampden\\" in Aylesbury (1912) marking the Civil War, and gates at the Bowes Museum and Cliveden.Fehr's Welsh dragon on Cardiff City Hall Church work fell away during this period, fashions were changing. In 1914 Singer & sons amalgamated with a rival, Spital & Clark of Birmingham. Herbert and Edgar Singer took back seat positions on the board, still chaired by William Bull, knighted in 1905, MP for Hammersmith. Statuary production was put on hold; the company struggled. In July 1915, after Lloyd George became Minister of Munitions, contracts were won to support the war effort. New equipment was brought in. From July 1916 to December 1918, the work force grew to 700 men and women. The firm produced 1.6 million shell cases plus 71.5 million .303 cartridges plus gun mountings, parts for aeroplane engines, fuze body stampings and submarine mines, 23,400 tons of metal. After WWI, with a reduced staff, orders for metal stampings, wrought iron work, war memorials, ecclesiastical metalwork and statuary resumed. All kinds of bronze work were in demand from home and abroad: statues, wreathes, emblems, friezes, tablets, as well as entrance doors and revolving doors for the Hong Kong & Shanghai Bank in Shanghai, lift enclosures for flats in Brook Street, London, lighting standards for Reading Bridge and the gates for Africa House in Kingsway, London.Frome Museum, document D1348, reprint from The Architectural Review Two of the largest commissions were Fehr's 1924 Shanghai Allied War Memorial (the Angel and all of the other bronzes were removed by the Japanese in 1943) and friezes for the Scottish National War Memorial (1927) at Edinburgh Castle by Alice Meredith Williams. Among the many monuments Singer & Sons created were Thornycroft's \\"Peace\\" in Luton, Fehr's Keighley memorial with its rare depiction of a sailor and the simple infantryman at Trowbridge by Bentham, typical of many war memorials cast by Singer & Sons: \\"beauty of design, appropriateness and excellence of execution\\". During the 1920s, Singer & Sons lost some trade and craftsmen to a new business, Morris Art Bronze Foundry in Lambeth. From May 1927 the statuary and art metalwork side of Singers was gradually transferred to London, along with some craftsmen, under a financial arrangement, to create the Morris Singer Company, which moved to Basingstoke in 1967. During WWII, the factory switched to making war material. The firm took over the old Cockey gas works at Welshmill to produce metal brass rods for making fuse bodies. Jim Garrett, as an apprentice, observed: > I went to work at Singers, that would have been about 1943...The siren would > go, and we all had to move somewhere else in case they dropped a few bombs, > or something. But, in the event, it didn't happen, so they abandoned that > idea, because it stopped the production. Making shell-noses...for the army. Charlie Robbins: detail from Frome's Servicemen Memorial, cast by Singer & SonsMetal stampings continued in Frome. The company was absorbed by the Delta Metal Group in 1956. In 2000 production was relocated to Handlemaker Road in Frome and the old site was sold for housing. The factory now concentrates on water sprinklers for fire protection in the ownership of Tyco.  Singer in Frome today  Re-gilding the sign at 25 Market Place, Singer's workplace and home; Camilla Rose, traditional sign writer & gilder, top; new sign completed, belowThe work of the foundry can be seen in several different locations. The Frome Museum has window balustrades and metal banister supports on the interior cantilever or torsion staircase of 1865-9. His house at 25 Market Place has window balustrades on the first floor. In 2019 the original sign above the door lintel was re-gilded, funded by the Frome Society for Local Study. The Church of St John the Baptist has a brass screen to the Chancel and a forged metal one to the Lady Chapel. There is a brass lectern and brass candlesticks in the church, but it is uncertain that these are Singer products; he did make such items for the church, but there has been some clearance of excess Victorian items. The Holy Trinity Church has a rood screen installed in 1903-06, now repositioned in a chapel to one side. New gates for the Blue House were provided by the Singer company in 1994 in response to an appeal by the trustees; a plaque is placed on the wall to the left of the entrance. A Singer's Trail has been created: a walk round key sites related to J W Singer and his foundry, in the 200th anniversary year of his birth. Information boards have been placed at several locations along the trail. A leaflet is available from Frome Town Hall, Frome Museum or the Discover Frome Information Point. In July 2019 'Casting the World: the story of J W Singer & Sons, Frome' was published as part of the town's celebrations; this includes newly discovered photographs of the workshops. In November 2019 a plaque from the Frome Society for Local Study was installed on the Old Courthouse, Waterloo, where Singer established his Frome Art Metalworks in 1866. On 3 August 2014 a memorial to Frome Servicemen was installed outside the Memorial Theatre, opposite the Town Hall on Christchurch Road West. This is dedicated to the fallen of WWI, WWII and the Falklands conflict. The statue on the memorial is a lifesize cast of Charlie Robbins, an employee of Singer both before his enlistment in WWI and after his demobilisation. He retired from Singer in the late 1950s and died in 1981 aged 89. The plaster was modelled by Edgar Thomas Earp and cast in 1922. After being rediscovered in the late 1970s/early 1980s, it was placed in front of the Singer Factory in Waterloo, close to the centre of the town. In 1999, while the factory was being relocated, the statue was sent to Morris Singer in Basingstoke to have its rifle strap and other elements repaired or added. On its return it was placed outside what became the Tyco site in Handlemaker Road, till it was gifted to serve as the memorial on a 99 year lease to Frome Town Council. It is the only statue cast by Singer that never really left Frome.

She worked at the National Zoo from 1978 to her retirement in 2011. She managed the National Zoo’s panda breeding program as early as 1987, but rose to national prominence following the birth of panda cub Tai Shan (giant panda) in 2005. Internationally known as “the Panda Lady,” her responsibilities as a curator at the National Zoo included overseeing the budget, exhibit design, construction, and supervising personnel. She was also responsible for the zoo’s primates, including gorillas, orangutans, gibbons, and macaques. She is included in the American Association for the Advancement of Science's Spotlight on African American Scientists.  Early life and education Stevens' father was in the United States Army, so she moved around during her childhood. She lived in Okinawa, Japan, and Bangkok, Thailand where she came in contact with various animals. Stevens said, \\"I was that kid who, at age 3 and 4, was picking up caterpillars and holding snakes.\\" When she was ten years old, Stevens began taking horseback riding lessons. Of horseback riding, Stevens said, \\"I think that was my earliest interest in veterinarian medicine, just by watching the vet work on the horses at the polo club there in Bangkok.\\" Stevens attended high school in Washington DC and earned her Bachelor of Science degree in Zoology/Pre-Veterinary Medicine in 1977 from Michigan State University. She also completed the Association of Zoos and Aquariums' Professional Management Development for Zoo and Aquarium Personnel in 1986.  Career  After graduating from university, Stevens moved to Washington, D.C. in 1978 and began working as an animal keeper at the National Zoo. In 1981, she was promoted to management. She began managing the primate program in 1981 and the giant panda program in 1987. Part of her responsibilities included \\"daily operations, personnel, budget, long-range planning, record keeping, research, education, exhibit design, and construction.\\" In 2005, Lisa Stevens was the Assistant Curator overseeing the giant panda program when Tai Shan (giant panda) was born; Tai Shan was the first surviving panda born at the National Zoo and the third panda cub born in the US. She was the primary spokeswoman for interviews about Tai Shan’s birth and her colloquial descriptions of his early adventures made her a popular interviewee. She was profiled in the Chicago Tribune and featured in the Animal Planet documentaries “A Panda Is Born” (2005) and “Baby Panda’s First Year” (2006), which were packaged together in a 2008 re-release.

In 2016, Berkeleyside became the first news site in the U.S. to launch a direct public offering, offering up to $800,000 in preferred stock to California residents. The direct public offering closed in 2018, after Berkeleyside raised $1 million from more than 350 readers. In 2017, Berkeleyside received a $60,000 grant from the Lenfest Institute to teach other news organizations how to launch a direct public offering.  History  Berkeleyside was founded by Frances Dinkelspiel, Lance Knobel and Tracey Taylor in response to the cutbacks in local news that affected the Bay Area. All three worked as journalists before starting the site. Frances Dinkelspiel is also the author of two books, Tangled Vines: Greed, Murder, Obsession and an Arsonist in the Vineyards of California, from 2015, and Towers of Gold: How One Jewish Immigrant Named Isaias Hellman Created California, from 2008. Berkeley is a city of 120,000 residents. Its culture and politics are heavily influenced by the presence of the University of California, Berkeley, campus in the center of the city.

Early life and Marriage  Julia Warde was born at Carleton as the younger daughter of Revd William Warde, previously vicar of Campsall, and his wife Marianne (). On her father's death in 1868, she and her elder sister Mary Ann jointly inherited Hooton Pagnell Hall, near Doncaster, which had been bought by the family of Sir Patience Warde in 1704. Mary died in 1880, leaving Julia as sole inheritor. In 1878 she married William Wright Aldam, son of William Aldam MP and owner of Frickley Hall, taking the name Warde-Aldam. They had two sons, William St. Andrew (1882–1958), who inherited the Hooton Pagnell estate, and John Ralph Patentius (born 1892) who inherited the Frickley estate. On Willam's father's death in 1890, the couple also inherited Healey Hall in Northumberland, and in 1899 they purchased the estate of Ederline in Argyllshire. Lych gate given by Warde-Aldam to Hooton Pagnell church Mining of coal on the various estates, including at Frickley Colliery in South Elmsall (named after the Warde-Aldams' Frickley estate), brought a great deal of wealth to the couple. Julia took a keen interest in the houses and estates, most significantly at Hooton Pagnell hall, which she remodelled substantially, giving its current crenellated gothic appearance, and added the East wing, as well as a gatehouse building in a gothic style. She also added a dining hall and master bedroom to Healey Hall, and restored the churches in both Hooton Pagnell and Frickley. Described as \\"a flamboyant benefactor with a fondness for seances\\" she had a wide range of interests, including collecting a notable collection of 2,000 book-plates. She was a keen amateur artist, and numerous paintings attributed to her survive.  St Chad's Hostel  St Chad's Hostel, constructed by Warde-Aldam in 1903-4 In 1902, Frederick Samuel Willoughby, vicar of Hooton Pagnell, founded St Chad's Hostel to train men for the ministry. Warde-Aldam was the project's major benefactor, and provided a new building for the hostel in 1903-4. She continued to support the hostel while it remained in the village until 1916, though does not seem to have had involvement with it after it moved to Durham as St Chad's Hall (now St Chad's College, Durham). After the closure of the hostel, the building was given by the family to the village to serve as a village club.  Hospital Commandant  In September 1914, a month after the Britain's entry into the First World War, Warde-Aldam opened up Hooton Pagnell hall as the Hooton Pagnell Auxiliary Military Hospital. She took on the role of Red Cross Commandant and matron of the hospital, and was honoured with an MBE in the 1918 Birthday Honours(GBE, KBE, DBE, CBE, OBE, MBE (6717–6749), and the Royal Red Cross, Second Class.  Later life, death and legacy  William Warde-Aldam died in 1921, while Julia herself died in 1931. In the early 21st century, increased awareness of Julia Warde-Aldam's involvement in the early years of St Chad's College, Durham led to the college recognising her as a co-founder, and in 2019 commissioning a new portrait by Alice Channon which was placed in the college dining hall alongside that of fellow co-founder Douglas Horsfall.

A Gaelic Irish force under Felim McFiach O'Byrne ambushed an English army of about 500, under Sir Henry Harrington, which was marching from Rathdrum to Wicklow. The English army was routed and lost about 250 men. Background The O'Byrnes had been allied to Hugh O'Neill, Earl of Tyrone since the outbreak of the Nine Years' War in 1593. Fiach McHugh O'Byrne had worked together with O'Neill, so much that he was described as the earl's \\"right arm in Leinster\\".Sir Geffrey Fenton to Sir Robert Cecil, 10 May 1597 (Cal. S. P. Ire., 1596-7, pp 257-8). However, when Fiach was killed in 1597, the power of the O'Byrnes seemed to wane. When Robert Devereux, 2nd Earl of Essex was appointed Lord Lieutenant of Ireland in 1599, he ordered Harrington into County Wicklow to deal with the O'Byrnes and their allies, the O'Tooles. Harrington's force consisted of five foot companies, but four of them were inexperienced levies recently raised in England. The only experienced foot company was that of Captain Loftus, whose men were mostly Irish. The companies were organised into a regiment under the command of Sir Alexander Radcliffe. To this was added fifty horsemen commanded by Captain Charles Montague. Harrington wanted to take his troops out to scout the Irish fortifications on the ford of the Avonmore River at Rathdrum, and possibly to give his raw troops some experience in field craft.Jackson, 'A Wicklow skirmish', p.58 His first attempt to view the Irish position on 28 May failed. Harrington returned to his camp about a mile from the ford.Report by Captain Mallory, on the overthrow near Wicklow, [July] 1599 (Cal. S. P. Ire., 1599-1600, pp 87-9). A second effort to view the Irish fortifications was made on 28 May, but this was turned back due to poor weather. Harrington ordered the men to march back to Wicklow town. The battle The English army stretched out in a column; in the lead was the van, then the baggage, followed by the battle and then the rear. Captain Atherton, the Sergeant-Major of the army, had little doubt that the weight of any Irish attack would fall on the rear of the column.A true discourse of the service at Wicklow by Captain Atherton, 12 July 1599 (Cal. S. P. Ire., 1599-1600, pp 83-7). Thus, the horse (cavalry) were placed at the rear. The army had marched little over a mile before the Irish shot (musketeers and caliver-men) began skirmishing with the rear of Harrington's force. The Irish tried to take a ford to block the advance, but the English secured the crossing, with the shot of the English rear skirmishing with the Irish, allowing the rest of the army to pass unhindered. The march continued two miles to another ford, with the rear continuing to hold O'Byrne's Irish shot at bay.Sir Henry Harrington to Sir Robert Cecil, 12 July 1599 (Cal. S. P. Ire., 1599-1600, pp 81-3). Again the English shot secured the crossing, as Irish fire slackened, possibly due to a shortage of gunpowder.Cal. S. P. Ire., 1599-1600, pp 81-7 Harrington placed 40–50 shot behind an earthen bank on the left flank of the column on the far side of the ford. The Irish brought up a stand of pikemen, but their attack was limited to the English left, as the right of the column was shielded by thick gorse bushes.Described as ‘high furze’ by Atherton Atherton gathered 60–80 men to counter-attack the Irish pike. The English shot behind the bank were to hold their fire until Atherton attacked, but instead prematurely fired a single volley at the Irish pike then abandoned their position. Without the support from their shot, Atherton's men refused to charge the Irish, then withdrew to the main body of the English column. Atherton found that the English shot had fled the column, abandoning the main stand of English pike. Now exposed to Irish gunfire, the English pike became disordered as they pressed to make the river crossing. Exploiting the English confusion, the Irish pike charged into the English rear, killing many without resistance. Montague's English cavalry charged to support the panicking infantry, but the Irish pike square opened, allowing the horse to pass through. The Irish pike speared the English horse as they passed, including Montague who was wounded by a pike thrust to his side.The declaration of Piers Walsh, lieutenant to Captain Adam Loftus, 2 June 1599 (Cal. S. P. Ire., 1599-1600, pp 59-60) Despite their officer's best efforts, the English soldiers' resistance collapsed. The rout continued with the Irish slaughtering Harrington's men to within one and a half miles of Wicklow town. All the English companies lost their colours, except for Captain Loftus, but they were later recovered by the English horse.Report by Captain Linley on the overthrow near Wicklow, 12 July 1599 (Cal. S. P. Ire., 1599-1600, pp 89-91) After the battle, Radcliffe estimated the English army had lost 250 men killed, missing or deserted.Sir Alexander Radcliffe to Sir Robert Cecil, [June] 1599 (Cal. S. P. Ire., 1599-00, pp 68-9). Aftermath The first English reports suggested that they lost the battle due to the inexperience of most of their troops. Harrington at first blamed the English pikemen for refusing to fight, but at the court- martial in July, Harrington, supported by two of his officers (Captains Linley and Mallory) blamed Captain Loftus and his Lieutenant Walsh. This was convenient, as Loftus had died from his wounds and could not refute their accusations. Their version was supported by a map drawn of the battle, possibly by Montague (Harrington's nephew).Jackson, A Wicklow Skirmish, p. 61 Loftus and Walsh were found guilty by the court-martial. Loftus was already dead but Walsh was executed by firing squad. Mallory and Linley were not found guilty but they were cashiered, losing command of their foot companies. The men in Loftus' company were sentenced to death but this was commuted to decimation by drawing lots. Even by Elizabethan standards this was deemed overly harsh.O'Neill, The Nine Years war, p. 97 Though Harrington was not charged with misconduct, he was never given command of a force this size again.

The boat has a draft of with the standard keel fitted. The fresh water tank has a capacity of . The boat is normally fitted with a small outboard motor for docking and maneuvering. The motor is mounted in the starboard lazarette and can be swung up when not in use and the hull opening covered with a hatch. The boat's galley is located on the starboard side. It includes a sink and a single- burner alcohol stove, which both slide under the cockpit for stowage.

These can be dislocations or stacking faults that are close to the surface of the sample, low angle grain boundaries or atomic steps. Unlike the use of transmission electron microscopy (TEM) for the investigation of dislocations, the ECCI approach has been called a rapid and non-destructive characterisation techniqueSSD group, University of Strathclyde, University of Strathclyde, Glasgow. Retrieved on 03 March 2019.  Mechanism  The word channelling in ECCI, and, similarly, in electron channelling patterns refers to diffraction of the electron beam on its way in the sample. With enough spatial resolution, very small crystal imperfections would change the phase of the incident electron wave-function, and this, in turn, would be reflected in the backscattering probability, showing up as contrast (sharp change in backscattered intensity) close to a dislocation.  Background  While we now talk about ECCI being a SEM technique, there was a significant gap of about thirty years between the prediction that defects ought to show up as contrast in the backscattered electron images of the SEM and the development of ECCI as an accessible technique for the user of a standard SEM. In the meanwhile the field emission gun (FEG) had to be developed and integrated in the commercial SEM in order to improve the spatial resolution for channelling applications. Shortly after, Wilkinson used ECCI to investigate clusters of misfit dislocations lying more than 1 μm underneath the surface at the interface of Si-Ge layers grown on Si. They noted that at this depth the spatial resolution is too low to resolve individual dislocations. However, they still concluded that the \\\\mathbf{g} \\\\cdot \\\\mathbf{b} = \\\\mathbf{g} \\\\cdot \\\\mathbf{b} \\\\times \\\\mathbf{u} = 0 invisibility criteria can be applied similarly to TEM. These pioneering ECCI investigations were made on highly tilted samples (40^{\\\\circ} - 70^{\\\\circ}), with side-mounted backscattered electron (BSE) detectors, similarly to the electron backscatter diffraction (EBSD) set up. When applied to metals ECCI tended to be used in a low tilt ( <10^{\\\\circ} ) configuration. This set up offers a number of advantages: the standard Si-diode detector can be mounted on the pole piece offering a large BSE signal collection angle and the interaction volume is minimised granting higher spatial resolution. The downside to this geometry is the reduction in BSE signal which, for metals, is less of an issue than for semiconductors due to higher atomic numbers. A comprehensive overview of the applications of ECCI for metallic materials has been made by Weidner and Biermann. From 2006 Trager-Cowan's group showed that using ECCI in the characterisation of nitrides is an excellent idea. Since then ECCI has been used in the forescatter geometry to reveal extended defects and morphological features of GaN samples. Picard et al. also argued that the \\\\mathbf{g} \\\\cdot\\\\mathbf{b} dislocation type identification criterion can no longer be applied due to surface relaxation. They used simulations instead to determine the Burger vectors of dislocations instead, laying the grounds for a non-destructive dislocation characterisation method. Literature continues to call ECCI a new technique even though it has been around for almost forty years. There are a number of reasons for this including the fact that it resisted being standardised such that every group has their own method of acquiring ECC-images depending on the material studied, the SEM abilities and the available detectors. Different groups proposed flavours of ECCI to distinguish between procedures. Gutierrez-Urrutia et al. and Zaefferer and Elhami coined the term controlled ECCI (cECCI) for a low tilt geometry ECCI aided by crystallographic information obtained form EBSD maps acquired at 70^{\\\\circ} tilt. Similarly, Mousour et al. used low tilt ECCI together with high resolution selected area channelling patterns to characterise dislocations in fine-grained Si steel and labelled it accurate ECCI (aECCI).

The immediate cause of the crisis was a prolonged drought that caused the water in the reservoir of the Simón Bolívar Hydroelectric Plant to reach very low levels. This occurred during a new occurrence of the El Niño climate phenomenon, which began to develop since July 2009. Although various measures were taken to overcome the crisis, one of the most controversial was the implementation of a program of electrical rationing throughout the country, except in the capital Caracas, which was ultimately officially suspended in June 2010, due to the recovery of reservoirs due to the rains, and not to interrupt the transmission of the 2010 FIFA World Cup. Although on 29 August of that year the Guri Dam reservoir reached its optimum level of operation, power cuts have continued to occur in the interior of the country, although with less frequency and duration, this time driven by failures in other parts of the system. The situation of \\"electrical emergency\\" decreed by the government on 21 December 2009 was suspended on 30 November 2010; however, on 14 May 2011, after the country experienced two national blackouts, the government of Hugo Chávez announced a temporary rationing plan and acknowledged that the electricity system continued to face \\"generation weaknesses\\" that they did not expect to surpass until end the year. The energy problem was widely politicized in Venezuela: in addition to the drought, the Chávez government also blamed wealthy sectors of the population of the crisis, assuring that they wasted electricity. The Venezuelan opposition responded by holding the government itself responsible, accusing it of not having made the necessary investments to keep pace with the country's electricity consumption growth, as well as having neglected the electricity infrastructure, which was completely nationalized a few years before. According to United Nations Economic Commission for Latin America and the Caribbean (ECLAC), the electricity crisis was one of the factors that contributed to the economic crisis that Venezuela experienced since 2009, which in turn is credited with giving way to the ongoing crisis in Venezuela. Furthermore, this crisis also influenced the notable increase in votes that the Venezuelan opposition experienced in the 2010 parliamentary elections. Causes and characteristics Venezuela, the main oil exporter in South America, suffered from a long drought that significantly reduced the volume of water in the dams of hydroelectric plants. For 2009, 73% of the electric energy consumed by Venezuelans depended on these plants. Additionally, the country's electricity consumption has been increasing by 6% per year, a percentage that exceeds the growth rate in the electrical supply that has been installed. Most of Venezuela's power comes from one of the largest hydroelectric dams in the world, Guri Dam in Bolívar State, Venezuela on the Caroni River; as of 2019, 70–80% of Venezuela's power comes from Guri. Venezuela has a history of electrical blackouts dating at least to 2010; Juan Nagel wrote in Foreign Policy in 2016 that the problems resulted from \\"massive government corruption [...] and the country’s disastrous energy policies\\". Univision also reported that the problems in the energy sector resulted from corruption and \\"lack of maintenance and investment\\". A report from Transparency Venezuela said that maintenance was abandoned for twenty years beginning in 1998. The aging infrastructure made the problems worse, and critics were silenced; a union leader for state power workers was arrested in 2018 by the Bolivarian Intelligence Service for warning that a blackout was likely. The private company, Electricidad de Caracas was owned by the United States' AES Corporation until 2007; according to The Wall Street Journal, \\"Venezuela's power grid was once the envy of Latin America\\". Then-President Hugo Chávez created the state-run Corpoelec by nationalizing the electric sector and expelling private industry in 2007; hence, the state has been solely responsible for energy supply for over ten years. Univision says Chávez \\"admitted failures (...) such as the 'insufficient' availability of the thermoelectric generation plant and the limitations of the national electric power transmission network and distribution systems\\"; he signed a decree in 2010 declaring a \\"State of Emergency of the National Electric Service\\". Chávez had Corpoelec speed up projects, and bypassing the process of public bidding for projects, he \\"authorized 'contracting by direct award',\\" which facilitated corruption. Low level of the Guri reservoir Simón Bolívar Hydroelectric Plant, on the Guri Dam The main power plant of the hydroelectric system is the Simón Bolívar Hydroelectric Plant, with a generation capacity of 10,000 MW, but which generated only 5,000 MWh after being affected by the drought, and by the beginning of February 2010, the level of the dam had dropped nine meters below its optimum level. If the level of the Guri reservoir falls below 240 masl, some turbines in the plant could not work, and the country's electricity supply would decrease. The government foresaw that if nothing were done, this level would be reached in May 2010, so it began to execute a series of measures that seek to reduce electricity demand and minimize Venezuela's dependence on hydroelectric power plants. By the end of March 2010, this date had been postponed to June 2010. The possibility that the Guri reservoir reached the critical level was first seen by President Hugo Chávez on 31 January 2010, by ensuring that if the companies did not reduce their electricity consumption \\"70% of the country would be left without electric service\\". On 9 March, Chávez was more emphatic about it, declaring: Subsequently, on 18 March, the Minister of Electric Power, Alí Rodríguez Araque, announced that there will be no electrical collapse, and that they planned to operate the Simón Bolívar hydroelectric plant below the safety level, although, he admitted, with limitations in the generation of electricity. He also accused the Venezuelan opposition of causing fear in the population by talking about \\"collapse.\\" Operating below this level is dangerous because steam could enter the turbines, a phenomenon known as cavitation, that can cause mechanical damage to them. By April 15, 2010, the Guri reservoir reached 8.79 meters above the collapse level; however, the next day its level increased by one centimeter, the first increase reported in months. On 23 April, the Minister of the Environment, Alejandro Hitcher, assured that the Guri would reach a normal growth rate within fifteen or twenty days. However, according to Miguel Lara, former general manager of the Interconnected Systems Operation Office, the crisis continued due to problems in the thermal generation park and transmission lines, although he recognized that it is unlikely that the Guri will collapse. Thermal park deficiency The National Electric Corporation, the public body that manages all electricity generating companies, acknowledged that by the end of 2008, 79% of thermoelectric plants were more than 20 years old, and that 30% were unavailable due to technical problems. In addition, of the plants that were working, many did not do so at full capacity: 3,800 MW were generated, when the installed capacity was 9,051 MW. Planta Centro, Carabobo One of the main thermoelectric plants in the country, Planta Centro, has an installed capacity of 2,000 MW, divided into five units of 400 MW each. In the last few months only two units were operational, generating about 450 MW. Although the funds to reactivate an additional unit were delivered months before, for the start of the crisis the work was 21 months behind. Subsequently, on 27 March, a unit was stopped for maintenance. By the beginning of April 2010, Planta Centro operates only with a unit of 400 MW, which is only generating 250 MW. Electrical specialists believe that Planta Centro is unlikely to recover in the short term, claiming lack of maintenance in recent years as the main cause. Other plants presented similar situations: the Pedro Camejo plant produced 50% of its capacity \\"for reasons of fuel and associated transmission\\"; and the Josefa Camejo plant operated at 33% of its capacity. Additionally, operating plants have reduced their generation since the beginning of the crisis: Plant Tacoa in Vargas had to shut down a unit of 377 MW in April, and plant Ramon Laguna stopped two machines that generated 253 MW in Zulia. Disparity in the increase in demand and electric supply Even before the 2009-2010 drought, there was already a disparity between the increase in supply and demand for electricity in Venezuela; the latter had been increasing at a rate of 7% per year since 2005. This deficit has been criticized by the opposition, alleging that in previous years the Venezuelan government did not make the necessary investments to increase power generation capacity at the same rate as the increase in demand. On the other hand, the government has accused sectors of the population of \\"wasting\\" electricity, and has highlighted the fact that Venezuela is the country with the highest electricity consumption per capita in Latin America. According to figures from the Office of Operation of Interconnected Systems, the Chávez government completed less than half of the investments in thermoelectric energy generation planned in 2005. Alí Rodríguez has denied that the government has not made the necessary investments, although he acknowledged that there are delays in the execution of projects. Saturation of distribution and transmission lines On 21 April 2010, a power cut was reported from the east to the west of the country, affecting 15 of the 24 states of Venezuela. Due to the distribution of the fault, Ciro Portillo, former vice president of Enelven, has assured that it is due to overload in one of the three transmission lines that start from the Guri. Before the crisis, the transmission lines were transmitting 1,000 MW over their capacity during the peak hours. The high temperatures Venezuela experiences between April and May also influence the saturation of these lines. The company Enelven, responsible for the affected areas, has not reported on the causes of this energy slump. For its part, the National Management Center has reported that Cadafe- Occidente overloads transmission lines daily. Responses  Investments  In 2009, the Chávez administration declared a national electric emergency and invested $100 billion US dollars towards solving it. The Chávez administration \\"distributed million-dollar contracts without bidding that enriched high officials of his government and the works were never built\\", according to Univision. The Wall Street Journal stated that the government awarded electrical contracts to companies with little experience in the energy sector. Billions of dollars were awarded in contracts for projects that were never completed, leading to international investigations of \\"high officials of the Chavez regime today persecuted for plundering the coffers of the Bolivarian Republic\\". Critics say that one company, Derwick Associates, was given projects although they had no previous experience; Derwick denies any bribes were involved. Of 40 energy projects approved between 2010 and 2014 analyzed by Transparency Venezuela, 17 are not completed as of March 2019, none are operating at capacity, and overcharging by billions of dollars was identified. In 2017, the National Assembly investigated the $100 billion dollars invested in the electrical system and determined that over $80 billion was embezzled, that more than 14 thermoelectric stations were not functioning, and that neither the electrical transmission nor the distribution system had adequate maintenance. Installation of thermoelectric plants President Chávez set a goal of installing 6,000 MW in 2010 through thermoelectric plants, an increase in the electricity supply greater than what has been installed during his then-eleven years in office. In addition, the estimated cost of the plan was of more than US$5,000 million. On 24 April, Minister Alí Rodríguez announced that 600 MW were installed in the first quarter, and they plan to install an additional 1,100 MW in the second quarter of 2010. It also reduced the goal of incorporating generation in 2010, from 6,000 MW to 5,000 MW. On 22 October, Minister Alí Rodríguez lowered even more the annual goal of incorporating electric power generation, going from 5,000 MW to 1,450 MW, with plans to reach 2,000 MW \\"soon\\". Rationing in Caracas Initially, an electric rationing plan was implemented in Caracas, the Venezuelan capital, but it was suspended days later amid protests, which also led to the departure of then-Minister of Electric Energy Ángel Rodríguez, who was replaced by Rodríguez Araque. A new electricity service charge scheme was implemented for users who consume more than 500 kWh per month, who have been identified as \\"high consumers\\" by the government. In addition, industries were ordered to reduce by 20% its electricity consumption, with a penalty of temporary interruption of the service in case they did not reach the goal. According to the director of the Chamber of Commerce of Caracas, this last measure was an attempt by the government to \\"blame the companies for the crisis\\". Rationing in the rest of the country In the rest of Venezuela, an electric rationing system was implemented by zones. Before Holy Week in 2010, the power supply was cut by about 3 hours at a frequency of 3 or 4 days. On average, outside of Caracas, Venezuela experienced an interruption in electrical service of between 9 and 12 hours a week. However, the results were not as expected; between January and February, a reduction in demand of 3% was experienced, while the goal set by President Chávez was 20%. After Easter, the frequency and duration of electricity supply cuts would increase in all of Venezuela except in Caracas: The Venezuelan inside the country experienced daily cuts of four hours, that is, more than 20 hours per week. The Venezuelan government ruled out interrupting the electricity supply in Caracas, even if the Guri reservoir reaches the emergency level. In this case, rationing would be accentuated in the Venezuelan territory corresponding the Guiana Shield, eastern Venezuela, and the Central-Falcón zone. The Venezuelan opposition criticized the idea of applying rationing to the rest of Venezuela except the capital as \\"discriminatory\\". At the end of April, Corpoelec ordered greater rationing, this time without prior notice and at night. Blackouts due to this cause have been reported in the states of Aragua, Anzoátegui, Mérida, Sucre, Táchira and Zulia. Reduction of activities in basic industries SIDOR's basic industries in Venezuela's side of the Guiana Shield have been hit hard by the crisis, whose production had already fallen by 40% in December 2009, after the Electricity Ministry set a 300 MW consumption limit; before the crisis, SIDOR consumed 800 MW. By February 2010, SIDOR operated at only 45% of its capacity, and 30,000 tons of metal billets were imported to Brazil to meet national demand. The government did not rule out paralyzing the activities of these industries completely, due to the high energy consumption that their processes require. In addition, three power plants were acquired to allow SIDOR to generate its own energy. It was expected that by the end of May 2010, the first of these plants would start generating the first 175 MW out of a total of 425 MW. Import of electric power from Colombia In 2011, due to the crisis and electricity deficit, electrical energy began to be imported from Colombia. The transfer is made through Cuestecitas-Cuatricentenario, through the exclusive commercial representative Isagen. Electric exports to Venezuela are also made from Norte de Santander through the San Mateo-Corozo circuit, with which Isagen has a connection contract through which 27.52 GWh have been exported. Official suspension of rationing and new blackouts On 22 May, the Venezuelan government announced the suspension of rationing on weekends and holidays, and off peak hours throughout the country. Rationing would then be maintained only on weekdays during peak hours, due to the partial recovery of the reservoirs thanks to the arrival of rains and the inauguration of some electrical works. On 10 June, President Chávez ordered the suspension of rationing, although he acknowledged that if peak hours were to exceed the limit of the transmission lines, rationing could be applied in that period. In addition, the state of electrical emergency would be maintained, as well as the rationing schedule in the public offices, at least until 30 July 2010. Chávez also acknowledged that the production of the basic companies of Guayana \\"went to the ground, but the worst is over\\". On 17 June, the Minister for Electric Power, Alí Rodríguez, declared that the electricity crisis had not ended, but that \\"the worst has happened.\\" The suspension of rationing was carried out due to the recovery of the reservoirs for the rains and not to interrupt the transmission of the 2010 FIFA World Cup. However, despite the fact that the Guri reservoir reached its maximum level at the end of August 2010, power cuts have continued to happen. According to the newspaper El Tiempo, Barcelona and Puerto la Cruz, two cities of Anzoátegui state, went almost 62 hours without electricity in a period of six days, due to faults in circuits and substations. In other parts of the country, the blackouts would be driven by faults in the transmission lines, and because several units of the Simón Bolívar Hydroelectric Plant is under maintenance. Chavismo spokespeople also hinted that there was \\"sabotage\\", claiming that they believed it was \\"very suspicious\\" that the blackouts intensified when the Guri reservoir reached its peak, others have accused the Venezuelan opposition directly, and even the United States of sabotage. However, there has also been recognition of inefficiency on the part of the government: Consequences Venezuela presented a GDP contraction of 3.3% in 2009, leading the energy crisis to prolong the recession in 2010. Additionally, the transfer of power generation from hydroelectric to thermoelectric increased domestic consumption of petroleum products and natural gas, causing a drop in Venezuelan exports, that had already experienced a 17% drop in 2009. The Minister of Energy and Mines, Rafael Ramírez, calculated that Venezuela would need 100,000 barrels of diesel fuel a day to maintain the thermoelectric plants working, once they are all operational. Although the government has blamed the El Niño phenomenon exclusively for the crisis, several polls indicate that the majority of Venezuelans blamed the Chávez government, accusing him of not having invested enough to offset the demand. For his part, Chávez accused the opposition of seeking political gains from the energy crisis. There were two major blackouts in 2013. In 2016, Venezuela had a severe electricity crisis that caused blackouts, industry shutdowns, and the decision by then-President Nicolás Maduro to cut back on government employee's work hours. Maduro's administration has put rationing in place several times, and changed the country's clocks to accommodate a daytime commute. Nagel wrote in 2016, \\"... there are two main reasons for the crisis: excessive electricity consumption and insufficient production. And the root of both of these problems is bad governance: populism, poor planning, inflexible ideology, and overwhelming corruption.\\" In 2017, there were more than 18,000 power outages nationwide.

With previous events in 2015 and 2016, the collapse intensified in 2017, when in September an alleged theft of cables left the city of Maracaibo (considered the second most important municipality in the country) and its surroundings without electricity. Since then long and short- term blackouts have been reported, which also cause the suspension of water supply, failures in cable television, telephone coverage and Internet access, among other services, as well as difficulty conducting business transactions, caused by the scarcity of banknotes and the dependence on the large-scale use of the point of sale terminals as well as electronic payments (such as wire transfers) that are deficient in the absence of electricity and the Internet, resulting in closing of establishments, absence of work, damage of food and electrical appliances, the decrease in quality of life, among other factors, which added to the high temperatures suffered by citizens, affect the normal development of the population. Authorities such as the national government and the government of Zulia (headed by governor Omar Prieto) have attributed these failures to an alleged sabotage, but the opposition and experts denounce that it is due to lack of maintenance, also arguing that only less than half of what is consumed regularly is produced, reason for which there is \\"cargo administration\\" (rationing). The National Assembly of Venezuela, of opposition majority, declared the region in a state of electrical emergency. The service has also been interrupted but to a lesser extent in other states such as Bolívar, Carabobo, Falcón, Mérida, Miranda, Nueva Esparta, Táchira, Vargas and the country's capital Caracas. The Minister of Electric Power and president of the National Electric Corporation (Corpoelec) threatened with the maximum penalty (25 to 30 years in prison) those who commit acts of sabotage. On 28 September 2018, the minister announced the suspension of the rationing. However, power cuts in the year 2019 regained strength, again registering rationing in different areas of the entity. Blackouts 2017 According to the Association of Engineers of Zulia, there were 25 blackouts in two days in Zulia, between 17 and 18 October, because only 2,000 of the 3,000 megawatts needed to satisfy the electricity demand are produced, while an official of Corpoelec affirmed that the blackouts were due to the high temperatures, affecting several municipalities, including Maracaibo. On 29 November, during the baseball game between the Navegantes del Magallanes and the Águilas del Zulia at the Estadio Luis Aparicio El Grande, the electricity went out from 7:45 p.m. until 9:15 p.m., due to an alleged sabotage. On 24 December, there was a blackout that lasted approximately 21 hours, in response to this, the Bolivarian Intelligence Service (SEBIN) stated \\"they are sabotaging, maximum alert\\", also, several Twitter users said \\"Nochebuena en penumbra\\" (\\"Christmas Eve in twilight\\"), the blackout started at 5:00 p.m. approximately. 2018 On 11 January, the Llano Alto and Juan de Ávila sectors of Maracaibo were without electricity for 12 hours, and absence of telephone service was also reported. On 15 January, a three-hour blackout occurred in the Raúl Leoni Parish of Maracaibo. On 22 February, in the east of the city of Maracaibo and the eastern communities of Lake Maracaibo, there was no electricity service from 10 pm until 3 am, the affected sectors were Circunvalación 3, Sabaneta, Lago Azul, La Paragua, El Milagro, La Floresta, Veritas, and La Rotaria; also, there was the absence of electric service in La Cañada, San Francisco, Cabimas and Ciudad Ojeda. Due to explosions in transformers, on 7 March a blackout occurred from 1 am. until 6:30 a.m. For twelve minutes there were several fluctuations. On 18 April, a 12-hour blackout took place in 9 municipalities in the state of Zulia, including in the south of the state, in Moralito, 40 km from El Vigía, due to three destroyed substations, object of an alleged sabotage; the governor Omar Prieto affirmed that an \\"exhaustive investigation\\" would be carried out. On 23 April, a second explosion of a substation left without electricity for 19 hours in several areas of Maracaibo. For six hours, sectors of eastern Maracaibo were without electricity on 3 May; when electricity was restored, several slumps and failures occurred. On 11 July, great part of the city of Maracaibo and its surroundings were left without electricity. The deposed governor-elect of the entity, Juan Pablo Guanipa, called the inhabitants to protest against said failure. In August, the capital of the state of Zulia, Maracaibo, spent up to a week without electricity due to a fire that occurred in the warehouses of an electrical transmission wiring located in the General Rafael Urdaneta Bridge, the main communication channel in that region. After the restoration, rationing was applied for four hours a day. On 31 August, at dawn, there was an explosion at the Las Tarabas substation that caused the suspension of service in the northern part of the city for more than 18 hours. At the end of August, the government again denounced wire theft. In September, the capital was again in the dark for more than two days after a reported failure in Sur del Lago de Maracaibo. Although the governor of Zulia announced that the electric system was stabilized, multiple sectors of the entity were left without service on 29 September 2018. On 24 October 2018, part of the state suffered a blackout that Corpoelec attributed to a fault in the Yaracuy-El Tablazo line, but citizens reported that the failure could be due to the explosion at the Punta Iguana electric substation in Santa Rita, located near the bridge over the lake, which had to be closed. On 28 October another breakdown occurred, this time on the Arreaga Central line after the fall of a tree, according to authorities, which caused electrical failures in several sectors of Maracaibo. On 23 December, the government reported that there was a new cutting of cables and damage to the towers of the Las Peonias substation, which according to the governor of the entity affected approximately 200MW of the electricity system, causing blackouts in various sectors. Rationing Until 23 September, the entity was under heavy rationing from the end of 2017 with regular hours of 4 to 6 hours a day, which according to circumstances could increase to 8, 10 and up to 12 hours divided into several rounds a day (early in the morning, morning, afternoon and/or evening). People from Zulia have repeatedly denounced that the schedules did not notify or respect them, as well as that the constant fluctuations could damage their electronic equipment. The Minister of Electric Energy, Luis Motta Domínguez, announced the suspension of the rationing on 23 September 2018, informing that the sublacustrine cable was reconnected and a turbo generator with 150 megawatts (MW) entered service for the Zulia state. Despite the announcements, blackouts have continued to occur, to which the authorities have responded that it is due to breakdowns.

The 1929 facade is symmetrical and shows a Tudor Revival influence, and shallow arch entries at north and south ends of the building are prominent features of the Broadway Avenue exposure. The brick cornice is inset with a diamond pattern. In 1949 the elementary school was expanded with north and south wings containing additional classrooms and an auditorium. The expansion is compatible with the original structure, and the building was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1982.The nomination form had not been digitized by March 2019. A copy of the nomination, contained in the Boise Public Schools Thematic Group and listed as Site 9, is on file at the Merle W. Wells Research Center at Idaho State Archives in Boise. With History A school had existed in South Boise from 1873, and the building was approximately one mile east of the present site of Garfield School. The wood frame building was heated by a potbelly stove which caused a fire that destroyed the school in 1889. In 1890 the first Garfield School was constructed at the northeast corner of Broadway and Barber Road (Boise Avenue), and it was named for recently assassinated President Garfield. The name was chosen by J.H. Gallaher in exchange for his donation of a school bell. Garfield School was replaced by a brick school, also named Garfield, in 1899.Carrie M. Gekeler was a teacher at the new Garfield School, and Gekeler Lane is named for her pioneer family. The 1890 and 1899 Garfield Schools were constructed on land originally known as the Ryan Homestead, later owned by Gallaher, and the schools were part of the Gallaher Addition. Garfield School was a stop on the 1905 Interurban Railway. In 1927 enrollment was 264 students at Garfield School, and in 1928 enrollment topped 300 students. By 1928 more than 100 children were transported from South Boise to schools north of the Boise River, partly because of overcrowded conditions at Garfield, and the school district had already begun construction of Whitney School and had begun an expansion of Lowell School. The architectural firm of Tourtellotte & Hummel was awarded the design contract for a new South Boise school to be built on the southeast corner of Boise Avenue & Broadway, across from the original Garfield, and their plans included a 2-story, 8-classroom building with a basement auditorium. The building was designed to enable future expansion. The South Boise parent teacher association (PTA) was given naming rights, and after some discussion the PTA chose the name, \\"Garfield.\\" Contractor J.O. Jordan & Sons received the construction contract. The new building was completed in January, 1930, and it opened with an enrollment of 365 students, but the school district continued to rely on the old building for classrooms, lunch room, and music room. The two buildings became known informally as old Garfield and new Garfield. In 1949 new Garfield was expanded with 13 additional classrooms, new offices, and a new auditorium. J.O. Jordan & Sons received the building contract. A plan to demolish old Garfield, realign Garfield Street, and build a city park near new Garfield was advanced by the school board in 1950. Old Garfield was demolished later that year, although a city park was not constructed. References External links  Garfield School website Further reading * J.

Biography Encarnación Bustillo Salomón was the daughter of Adelaida Salomón y San Martín, a native of Roa, and Fermín Bustillo y Pereda from Villacomparada de Rueda. Her maternal grandparents Sergio and Ramona came from Valladolid and Villanueva de los Caballeros, Palencia, while her paternal grandparents Antonio and Encarnación were natives of Villarcayo and Villacomparada de Rueda. Her family moved to Valladolid, where her father worked as a lawyer. Encarnación began her artistic studies there, and years later she moved to Madrid to continue them. Her teachers were Marceliano Santa María and Fernanda Francés. She was a prolific artist who presented works to various exhibitions during the first half of the 20th century. The date and place of her death are unknown. Artistic career In 1901 the magazine Última Hora dedicated a few lines to the work representing flowers and fruits that Bustillo had presented at the Exhibition of Fine Arts and Decorative Art. To the critic, her work was a typically feminine product, fruit of the sensitivity and special conditions of women. At that time, and in the eyes of some critics, the work of women painters was of a lower rank than that of men, and in their critiques there are paternalistic tones, totally different from those dedicated to men. In 1903, the Boletín de la Sociedad Castellana de Excursiones dedicated an article to the first feminist exhibition held in Madrid at the Salón Amaré, in which women artists presented themselves individually \\"forming an artistic community worthy of consideration.\\" Bustillo was one of the exhibitors with two works, and in the opinion of the same critic, \\"the dead flowers and game that she now exhibits are the work of a pure palette and a sincere study that predict successive advances in her career.\\" In this Salón Amaré exhibition, which emulated those held in Barcelona's Sala Parés, around 40 painters participated in the First Feminist Exhibition, including, in addition to Bustillo, Julia Alcayde (1855–1939), Fernanda Francés (1862-1939), and (1864–1917). The criticism was totally favorable and the Álbum Ibero Americano cited them all. In 1904 she presented at a fine arts exhibition with a painting of a column and planter, and she participated in numerous national exhibitions from 1901 to 1945, as well as in the Autumn Salons from 1942 to 1952, presenting easel paintings as pieces of decorative art, according to the titles of said works. The press covered her participation in the various national exhibitions, such as the Exhibition of Fine Arts in Madrid in 1926. She also presented works at the National Exhibitions of Cuba and Panama from 1909 to 1916, where she won notable prizes (a gold medal at the Cuba exhibition in 1909 and a silver in 1911, as well as a silver at the Panama exhibition of 1913). In 1945 Bustillo presented the painting entitled Vendedoras de pescado (Fish Vendors) at the National Exhibition of Fine Arts, which was described by ABCs critic, as \\"a picture of a strong racial type\\". In 1946 she participated in the First Women's Fine Arts Salon, an initiative to open a space for female artists who had usually been excluded. The Salon was a success; the critics considered it representative of the moment and Bustillo participated in the portrait category. Las camareras de la Virgen Las camareras de la Virgen (1915) Encarnación Bustillo Salomón's best-known work is Las camareras de la Virgen (The Virgin's Waitresses). It is a 207 x 259 cm oil painting. It shows a group of waitresses in front of the image of the Virgin Mary, adorned for a party, who present a tray to the mayor, who gives a donation. The elderly waitress is richly attired, sporting an ostentatious scapular around her neck. The landscape in the background recalls the north of Burgos. Bustillo presented it to the National Exhibition of Fine Arts in 1915, receiving a Third Class Medal. It is now on display at the Museo de Burgos.

It was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1972. History In 1904, Congress appropriated funds for the construction of a new post office in Battle Creek. Albert Kahn was chosen as the architect, one of the first commissions he completed after opening his own Detroit office. Kahn produced plans for the building by the end of the year. Contractor Charles A. Howind was awarded the contract to complete the building, and it was dedicated in 1907. In 1930–1931, an addition was constructed, carefully following the style of the original, which approximately doubled the post office's size. In 1968, a new post office was built and the old one vacated. It was eventually refurbished into office space. Description The old Battle Creek Post Office is a stone-and-brick structure measuring approximately 112 feet long and 75 feet deep. The 1930–1931 addition, although carefully matched in style, obscures the symmetry of the original design. Stone quoins run along the corners, and a stone balustrade and a denticulated stone cornice run across the top. Both the original structure and the matching addition have two stone arched windows measuring approximately 8 feet wide and 16 feet high, decorated with a cast- iron grillwork.

Financed by French capital, it was introduced in 1958 by President Charles de Gaulle during the height of the Algerian War in an attempt to quell uprisings of Algerian independence. The plan was structured based on the former Maspétiol Report, and the report entitled “Les perspectives décennales du développement économique de l'Algérie”, and officially commenced on October 3, 1958 after de Gaulle gave his speech in the Algerian city of Constantine. The long-term impact and progress made by the Constantine Plan ran through many spheres of Algerian society including education, public service and administration, housing, and land distribution in French Algeria. The plan was intended to serve two purposes: to weaken support for the Front de libération nationale (FLN) in Algeria and to prevent the spread of communism, keeping Algeria in the Eurafrica sphere. In the long run, the plan proved to be unsuccessful in most of its goals as its promises were either not kept or were poorly implemented. The Constantine Plan failed to quell the Algerian War (1954-1962), which led to Algeria's independence in July 1962.  Origins  Much of the planning and legislature surrounding the Constantine Plan was developed from a compilation of earlier reports which had aimed to establish Algeria's overall situation.  Maspétiol Report  Rapport général [dit Rapport Maspétiol], or the Maspétiol Report, also referred to as The Maspétiol Commission (1955) was a report that calculated the amount of French investment necessary in order to develop Algeria's economy. By taking into consideration colonies or countries whose size and developmental levels were similar to Algeria's, the report provided a quantitative and statistical basis for development. Roland Maspétio, who headed the study, stated that the French economy was fully capable of funding Algerian development, citing Les Trente Glorieuses, the period between 1945 and 1975 wherein France saw great economic development.  Les perspectives décennales du développement économique de l'Algérie  “Les perspectives décennales du développement économique de l'Algérie”, or “The 10 year perspectives of the economic development of Algeria” followed the Maspétiol Report in 1957. It was drafted by a group of young civil servants formed by the Algerian General Government. The report mapped out Algeria's economic prospects for the period spanning 1957-1966. The report also analyzed Algeria's current economic conditions in order to explain hurdles — such as Algeria's rapidly growing population — which the country would face in the coming years. It would be presented to French authorities in 1957, and would ultimately contribute heavily to the contents of Charles de Gaulle's speech in 1958.  Charles de Gaulle’s speech  A Statue of Charles de Gaulle in Dinant On October 3, 1958, French president Charles de Gaulle appeared before the people of Algeria, in the city of Constantine, and unveiled plans for a new development project to be financed by Metropolitan France. De Gaulle reaffirmed France's determination for renovation and his commitment towards developing French Algeria. He made bold promises for sweeping changes meant to improve every factor of Algeria's social, cultural, and economic system. He asserted that it was only through this transformation that Algeria would prosper, further elaborating that peace would be achieved, but only France was willing and able to provide the necessary aid to help Algeria accomplish these goals. De Gaulle denounced “extremism”, stating that turning towards extremist groups for guidance is a foolish endeavor that will only lead to destruction and that these groups that incite unrest and wage war on France are not capable of providing Algeria with the same means that France is offering to give them. The speech noted a dichotomy of choice between either war or brotherhood. De Gaulle made it clear that of the two he preferred brotherhood, but only under French terms. Historical experts have identified the speech as being perceived by De Gaulle as an opportunity to undermine the growing unrest and support for the Front de libération nationale (FLN), or the National Liberation Front in Algeria. This claim is based on the fact that the speech came during the peak of the Algerian War as France and the FLN were locked in a heated battle for Algerian independence. The Constantine Plan also served as an attempt to keep Algeria squarely in the Eurafrican zone. By taking hold of the country's economic development, France hoped to be able to prevent the spread of communism.  Conditions in Algeria prior to the Constantine Plan   French colonialism in Algeria   Education  Prior to France's conquest of Algeria in 1830, the Algerian educational system only provided schooling until the secondary level. Education was also not state run, and instead, was funded by wealthy religious donors. Primary and middle school education focused on teaching reading and writing in Arabic as well as memorization of Qur’anic verses. Secondary education taught theology, jurisprudence, and law, and took place in mosques or independent quarters known as madaris. French officials initially promised that they would continue to allow the operation of Qur’anic schools. In practice, new French legislation undermined the pre-existing system to spread French culture. Over time, many of these schools were forced to shut down due to lack of funding. French officials created state-run publicly funded schools that competed with traditional Qur’anic schools. Consequently, the French administration's influence on Algeria's educational system steadily grew. Moreover, the roles of colonial officials were expanded, the instruction of French was added to all curriculums, and more focus was placed on non-religious programs such as arithmetic, history, and geography. However, as free modern Arabic schools that did not teach French had developed throughout the 1930s, French officials refused to shut down Arabic Ulama schools due to the fact that French public schools were beginning to lack the capacity to take in more students by the 1950s. Constructing enough schools and training enough teachers to cope with approximately two million 5 to 15 year old Algerians was a colossal task and financial burden for French administrators. Because of the French government's refusal to close Ulama schools, the Arabic schools provided education to those the French could not. The increasing demands for education later informed decisions regarding Algerian education in the development of the Constantine Plan. Public service and administration A result of France's steadily growing influence on the Algerian education system was the gradual replacement of various institutional leaders. After the French government installed state run madaris, they stipulated that any man charged with teaching at a level leading directly to higher education had to be educated at one of France's state run schools. Approved representatives at all levels of administration— from school officials to Muslim preachers — were installed to influence Algerian culture from the ground up. This policy was applied to such an extent that an Algerian minister commented prior to the implementation of the Constantine Plan, that of the 864 administrative high posts, 8 were Muslim held.  Goals  The Constantine Plan was an ambitious project that aimed to increase wages, housing, and public infrastructure across colonial French Algeria. It was an overarching program meant to target all levels of Algeria's society. The plan focused on modernizing Algeria in order to mitigate the socio-economic discrepancy that had existed both statistically and in the eyes of the colonial French government between the Algerian people and Europeans. The plan would ultimately be the result of several years of work completed by economists, academics, and statisticians. Workers in Algeria constructing a house, 1956 It promised comprehensive improvements including, but not limited to: # Raising national revenue by 7.5% # Increasing the number of children able to access education to 1.5 million # The creation of large-scale industry, especially metallurgical and chemical industries through the use of oil and gas from the Sahara # Creation of housing for a million people # Increasing of employment levels through the creation of 400,000 new Algerian- based jobs, and an additional 100,000 France-based jobs for Algerians. # Redistribution of 250,000 hectares of land. # Promising that at least 10% of France's judiciary, administrative, and education roles would be set aside for Arab Algerians.De Gaulle, Charles. \\"Discours Du Plan De Constantine.\\" Translated by Halsall Paul. Speech, Algeria, Constantine, October 3, 1958. July 1998. Retrieved from https://sourcebooks.fordham.edu/mod/1958degaulle- algeria1.asp. The implementation of the plan necessitated the creation of le Conseil supérieur du plan, or the Constantine Plan Superior Council. With 43 members, the original council was led by three individuals. The First was Pierre Massé, a top French government official who served as both the Commissioner General regarding equipment and modernization and the council chair. Alongside Pierre Masse were Salah Bouakouir, the Secretary of both economic affairs and the general delegation, and Jean Vibert, the general director of the Constantine Plan and of economic research. In the project's planned 5-year run, France promised to commit 350 million francs towards agriculture, forestry and hydraulics and another 460 million francs towards the development of industry and energy.  Results   Industry and employment  Estimations state that 80,000 new jobs had to be created every year in order to keep up with the exponential growth of Muslim workers entering the Algerian economy. Despite this fact, only 400 new factories were either built or planned to be built in the two years following the implementation of the Constantine Plan. These 400 factories would have only provided 28,000 of the needed 80,000 jobs, and even then these numbers were over inflated and the true number was believed to be only half of the estimated 28,000. Following years did not see an increase in the rate of job growth, and the planned 400,000 new jobs would not have been possible in the 5-year span first set about by the Constantine Plan. In promising the creation of these 400,000 new jobs, the industries in which these jobs would be created had not yet been determined. The agriculture industry was already oversaturated (about 65% of the male working population), and the service industry was also considerably developed due to the war (about 20% of the male working population). Most of the jobs would eventually be created in heavy industry (mining, energy, construction) fuelled largely by the public infrastructure works financed by the plan itself, as well as hydrocarbon research and extraction given the plan to utilize gas and oil reserves in the Sahara. Ultimately, the plan would create 106,810 new jobs — approximately 25% of its originally promised numbers.  Education  After the plan's first year of implementation, the enrollment rate of Muslim children in schools doubled; however, over half of the country's school-age children continued to lack access to any kind of formal education. The schools were heavily dependent on French capital and teachers, and were ultimately criticized for being unsustainable. Additionally, with funding being concentrated in urban centres, the accessibility issue intensified in rural regions.  Public service and administration  Following the implementation of the Constantine Plan and General de Gaulle's promise to open up new administrative posts for Arab Algerians, Muslim participation in administration increased from 21,000 to 37,000. Muslim involvement in military ranks also saw exponential growth as more and more posts became open to the greater Muslim population. House construction in Constantine, Algeria, 1961  Housing  De Gaulle's promise to create more housing culminated in the creation of both Le campagne de mille villages and Les villages de regroupement. While Le campagne de mille villages served its purpose of housing 1 million Algerian people, Les villages de regroupement brought together 2 million, many of whom were forcefully removed from their villages, and subjected to abject poverty.  Land distribution  The redistribution of land ended in failure. Originally promising to redistribute 250,000 hectares amongst 15,000 families, the plan managed to redistribute less than 20% of their promised goal. By 1961 only 41,000 hectares had been distributed to 1800 families. The plan ultimately failed to address chronic land shortage, a pressing problem of economic survival in the Algerian countryside given that 6.5-million Algerians at the time still depended on an agricultural sector in which about 22,000 settler-owned farms produced a volume of saleable produce equivalent to that of approximately 600,000 Algerian-owned smallholdings.  Legacy  If the purpose of the Constantine Plan was to reduce popular support for the FLN, then the shortcomings of the Constantine plan doomed the public relations aspect to failure. The launching of the Constantine Plan is viewed by scholars as largely an attempt to further integrate Algeria into France's sphere of influence, particularly in an economic sense. Since many of the bodies created by the plan continued to operate after 1962, the plan cannot be solely identified as a colonial phenomenon or an effort to subjugate Algeria. Criticisms Historian Martin Thomas adopted a critical outlook on the plan. Although the plan was meant to be a transformative development scheme, Thomas believed that the execution of the Constantine Plan was doomed to fail due to sheer financial issues arising from France ramping up costly military operations such as its nuclear program. In regard to domestic reaction, Algerian socialists believed the plan was proof that de Gaulle shared similar values referring to public infrastructure projects, state-funded employment, and public housing. Others believed the plan as a whole to be a misguided economic solution to a program that was primarily political. Dorothy Pickles, in her book Algeria and France From Colonialism to Cooperation, argues that even if the Constantine Plan had accomplished all that it had set out to do it still would not have been enough to meet all of Algeria's growing needs and fully develop it to a level equal to Europe, as Charles de Gaulle claimed. For Pickles, the goals set about by the plan would have no doubt eased France's plan for the creation of a new French Algeria, “but they [were] only the beginning of the beginning”.

The young scientist later left his homeland to work in the United States of America. The Lika Museum in nearby Gospić administers the site. History The Memorial Center was opened to the public on the 150th anniversary of Tesla's birthday, 10 July 2006, by the President of the Republic of Croatia. The original memorial site was first established as a museum in 1956, but it was damaged during the Croatian War of Independence when a projectile fell on the commercial building next to Nikola Tesla's house. The fire was eventually put out by the Croatian Army who deposited furniture and other objects it saved in the Museum of Lika. The Croatian authorities restored the complex and reopened it in a 2006 ceremony, with the highest dignitaries of Croatia and Serbia attending. After the war it was renovated, improved, equipped and opened as Memorial Center in 2006. Architecture and exhibits On its surface area of 1.37 square kilometres, the memorial complex contains various components: museum in the birth house* of Nikola Tesla (where the details of his life are shown in a permanent exhibition of artefacts, documents, photographs and audiovisual material), then orthodox church of St. Peter and Paul, an old agricultural building, village cemetery, Tesla’s testing station, stone monuments, benches and river banks designed by architect Zdenko Kolacio, metal statue of Nikola Tesla made by sculptor Mile Blažević, open-air auditorium, prototypes of some Tesla’s inventions* (induction motor, Tesla’s turbine, rotating magnetic field, Tesla coil), multimedia center etc. Various scientific and educational activities or presentations are occasionally organized in the Memorial Center.

The electoral law was codified for the first time through a 2012 Presidential Decree. Articles 1, 2, and 3 deal with how the parliamentary seats are allocated to the various constituencies, while articles 99 and 100 legislate the method of parliamentary apportionment for political parties in an election. In both cases, Greece uses the largest remainder method. Up to and including the 2019 Greek legislative election, Greece will continue to employ a semi-proportional representation system with a 50-seat majority bonus. The next election will see the electoral system change to proportional representation, as the majority bonus will cease to be applied since it was abolished in 2016. This article is reflective of this method. The election after next will revert to semi-proportional representation with a sliding scale bonus after it was passed in parliament in 2020. Background A black/white ballot box for lead ballots in a caricature about the 1920 Greek legislative election. Greek parliamentary constituencies correspond to the former prefectures of Greece with the exception of constituencies in Thessaloniki and Attica, which are divided into two and eight constituencies respectively. Constituencies have generic names, with constituencies which are broken up receiving Greek numerals to differentiate each other, with Thessaloniki A () for example translating to \\"first (electoral district) of Thessaloniki\\". The break-up of Athens B introduced Arabic numerals to the names as well, for example Athens B1 (). As of December 2018, Greece is divided into 59 electoral constituencies of varying sizes. The smallest constituencies are single-seat, while the largest, Athens B3, is represented by 18 members of parliament. Prior to the 2018 reform, which saw Athens B broken up into three smaller constituencies (Athens B1, Athens B2, and Athens B3), Athens B was the largest constituency in the country with 44 MPs, dwarfing the second-largest constituency of Thessaloniki A with 16 MPs. The Constitution of Greece includes provisions relating both to the constituencies and the number of MPs. Article 51 sets the minimum number of MPs at 200 and the maximum at 300, while Article 53 regulates the way in which constituencies and the electoral law can be changed, while also specifying that up to one twentieth of the total number of MPs (5%, or between 10 and 15 depending on the size of the parliament) may be elected on a national level instead of in constituencies. 12 MPs (4%, or one twenty-fifth) are elected in this manner. Proportional representation (PR) was first introduced in Greece in the 1926 election, replacing the older approval voting system in use since 1864. Under that system, voters cast lead ballots in ballot boxes corresponding to the number of candidates running in a constituency, placing their lead ballot in the white partition for approval and the black partition for disapproval; the candidates with the highest approval counts were selected until all seats were filled. A majoritarian system was later adopted, with voters voting on party lists and the candidates with the most votes (even if below 50%) being elected. The introduction of PR created unstable governments and it has been re-established a number of times since, most recently in 1989, before being abolished. Reinforced proportional representation favouring the largest party, the type of electoral system used now, was first used in 1951. Overall, Greece has changed its electoral law regarding apportionment in the parliament on average once every 1.5 elections. The majority bonus was introduced in 2004 to replace the older method of reinforcing the proportional system. Under the previous system, seats were awarded in two or three stages, with increasing quota requirements for each stage. In its explanatory report regarding the law, the Hellenic Parliament committee responsible for that piece of legislation concluded that reinforcing the proportional system through a simple majority bonus would significantly lower the malapportionment factor of Greek elections, since it would ensure that all seats are awarded completely proportionally with the exception of the winning party, which would receive a boost equal to 13.33% of the total seats. In particular, political parties would at a minimum be awarded at least 87% of the seats they would be entitled to if the system was not reinforced, as opposed to 70% under the previous law. The bonus was increased to 50 seats in 2009 (a boost of 16.66%), and this was first applied in the May 2012 Greek legislative election. The majority bonus was abolished in 2016 but will still be applied at the 2019 Greek legislative election, with elections held after that using proportional representation. As part of the ongoing 2019 revision to the Constitution of Greece, the Syriza- led government also wants to enshrine proportional representation in the Constitution. The Constitution would define 'proportional representation' as any system with a margin of error of less than 10% between percentage of the national vote received and percentage of seats awarded, and a maximum electoral threshold of 3% of the national vote. New Democracy, the main opposition party, claims that proportional representation would result in weak governments like it did in the French Fourth Republic and the Weimar Republic. The 1864 Greek Constitution previously specified approval voting as the official electoral method, until the introduction of proportional representation in 1926; no constitution since then has specified the type of electoral system to be used. Apportionment of seats allocated to the constituencies The constituencies of Greece, colour-coded by number of seats after the 2018 apportionment. The number of seats per constituency is calculated by first figuring out the national quota by dividing the total legal population of Greece as recorded in the last census by the number of seats elected in constituencies (288). The integer of the division of the population of each constituency by the national quota, disregarding the decimals (marked k in the function below), is the number of seats allocated to that constituency; a constituency with a sum of 5.6 is awarded 5 seats. If there are seats left empty in the first round of allocations, all 59 constituencies are ranked in descending order of leftover decimals and a seat is awarded to any constituency with a k larger than or where x is the number of seats which remained empty in the first allocation; if there are 9 unassigned seats, the constituencies with the 9 highest leftover decimals are awarded a seat each. The mathematical formula below is a summary of this allocation process: \\\\text{Constituency seats} = \\\\left \\\\lfloor {\\\\text{(total legal population of the constituency)} \\\\over \\\\text{(total legal population of Greece)}/288} \\\\right \\\\rfloor \\\\begin{cases} +1, & \\\\text{if } k_n \\\\geqslant k_x \\\\\\\\\\\\ +0, & \\\\text{if } k_n < k_x \\\\end{cases} The use of integers only to determine the number of seats in the first allocation means that there are always seats left empty for allocation in the second step, since the number of seats allocated by rounding down is always less than the number of seats a constituency is entitled to. In the 2018 apportionment of seats, 263 seats were awarded to constituencies in the first step and 25 in the second; Evrytania and Lefkada received no seats in the first step, but received one seat each due to their leftover decimals in the second step. Apportionment of seats allocated to parties in legislative elections The electoral apportionment method of Greece in a flow chart visualisation. The first step in determining the result of a Greek legislative election is to find the electoral quota () of each party on a national level. This is done by taking the number of votes received by each party polling at least 3% nationally and multiplying it by 250, thereupon dividing that sum by the total number of votes cast for political parties which have received at least 3% of the national vote; the number of seats elected in constituencies, without the 50-seat majority bonus. The integer of this calculation gives the number of seats that each party is awarded, in proportion to its electoral result. As with the allocation of seats to the constituencies, if there are any seats left vacant in the first allocation, the political parties are ranked in descending order of leftover decimals and a seat is awarded to any constituency with a k larger than or where x is the number of seats which remained empty in the first allocation. This formula below is a summary of this calculation process: \\\\text{Quota} = \\\\left \\\\lfloor {\\\\text{(total number of votes for each party polling over 3}\\\\% \\\\text{ nationally)} \\\\times 250 \\\\over \\\\text{(total number of votes cast for all parties polling over 3}\\\\% \\\\text{ nationally)}} \\\\right \\\\rfloor \\\\begin{cases} +1, & \\\\text{if } k_n \\\\geqslant k_x \\\\\\\\\\\\ +0, & \\\\text{if } k_n < k_x \\\\end{cases} Because the number of votes is multiplied by 250 rather than 300 it ensures that there are always 50 seats left vacant for the majority bonus. The national quota is used later in order to 'correct' the results in the constituencies, ensuring that the 50 seats of the majority bonus are left vacant as intended. This provision was abolished in 2016, along with the majority bonus, and in elections after 2019 the total number of votes received by a party will be multiplied by 300 instead of 250. The 12 MPs elected nationally In accordance with the constitution, several seats in the parliament are elected on a national level. These MPs are elected through party-list proportional representation using the largest remainder method, with the whole of Greece acting as a single 12-seat constituency. The seats are allocated by first finding the national quota for these 12 seats, dividing the total number of votes cast for all parties which have received at least 3% of the vote nationally by 12, and then dividing the total number of votes for each party which has received at least 3% of the national vote by the national quota for the 12 seats. The integer of this calculation is the number of seats each party is awarded in this apportionment. If there are any seats left vacant in the first allocation, the political parties are ranked in descending order of leftover decimals and a seat is awarded to any party with a k larger than or where x is the number of seats which remained empty in the first allocation. This formula below is a summary of this calculation process: \\\\left \\\\lfloor {\\\\text{(total number of votes for each party polling over 3}\\\\% \\\\text{ nationally)} \\\\over \\\\text{(total number of votes cast for all parties polling over 3}\\\\% \\\\text{ nationally)} \\\\div 12} \\\\right \\\\rfloor \\\\begin{cases} +1, & \\\\text{if } k_n \\\\geqslant k_x \\\\\\\\\\\\ +0, & \\\\text{if } k_n < k_x \\\\end{cases} The 7 MPs elected with First Past the Post Seven constituencies of Greece (Evrytania, Grevena, Kefalonia, Lefkada, Phocis, Samos, and Zakynthos) have only a single MP each. They are mostly islands, and their legal population ranges from 26,796 in Evrytania to 44,963 in Phocis. Each seat is awarded to the party which has received the most valid votes in each of the single-seat constituencies, provided that that party has received at least 3% of the national vote. This means that if a party is very popular in a single-seat constituency but has not received 3% of the vote nationally, it is disqualified. There is no requirement for a party to reach 50% of the vote before being awarded the seat, as a simple plurality is enough. In this case, the system employed is first-past-the-post or plurality voting. The 231 MPs elected proportionally The apportionment of the 231 MPs proportionally-elected in constituencies is by far the most complex step of all the processes, and involves a number of stages. In the first stage, the electoral quota of each constituency is calculated by dividing the total number of votes cast for all parties in the constituency (regardless of if they achieved 3% of the national vote) and dividing it by the number of seats in that constituency. The total number of votes cast for each party in the constituency is then divided by the constituency quota, and the integer of that calculation corresponds to the number of seats awarded to that party, so that a sum of 5.6 would award 5 seats. Any parties which have received more seats than they have candidates are awarded the same number of seats as their number of fielded candidates. To fill any seats left empty after the first stage, the difference in seats each party is entitled to in accordance with the national quota established before the apportionment of seats began minus the total number of seats that have been awarded to each party so far is calculated. The number of 'unused votes' for each party in the constituency is then calculated, by multiplying the number of seats it has been awarded in the constituency, times the electoral quota established for that constituency. Empty seats in two- and three-member constituencies are awarded, in order and one by one, to the parties which have the highest number of unused votes in that constituency. If any party has been awarded more seats so far than it is entitled to in accordance with the national quota, one seat is removed from it in three-member (and if necessary two-member) constituencies, until it has the same number of allocated seats as it is entitled to. If there are still constituencies with empty seats, all constituencies with empty seats are ranked in descending order of the unused votes of the political party with the smallest number of valid votes on a national level (that has secured at least 3% of the national vote), and one seat is awarded to that party in those constituencies where it is showing the highest number of unused votes, until that party has reached the number of seats it is entitled to in accordance with the national quota. If there are still seats left empty, this procedure is followed for all other parties in ascending order of total valid votes (that have secured at least 3% of the national vote) until all seats have been allocated. The 50 seats of the majority bonus The 50 seats of the majority bonus can either be awarded to party which has achieved a plurality of votes or to an electoral coalition provided that the average percentage of votes received by the members of the coalition is larger than the percentage of votes received by the political party which has a plurality of votes on a national level. The judgement on whether an organisation is a political party or a political coalition rests with the Supreme Civil and Criminal Court of Greece. If, in exceptional circumstances, the electoral arithmetic results in a situation where the largest party is awarded more seats than there are seats available including the bonus, as a result of the re-allocation of empty seats in the constituencies, then the majority bonus can be reduced so that the largest party can keep the seats awarded to it in the constituencies. Malapportionment The Gallagher index (or Least Squares Index), was developed by Michael Gallagher as a means of measuring the electoral disproportionality or malapportionment between the percentage of votes parties receive in an election versus the percentage of seats allocated to them. Greece's \\"notorious\\" 'reinforced proportionality' system produces Gallagher Indices more closely approximating those of first-past-the-post systems rather than proportional systems like Denmark or New Zealand. Taking the examples of the Gallagher Indices of selected countries in their last election, the September 2015 Greek election had an index of 9.69. The United Kingdom, Australia, and Canada, all first-past-the-post systems, scored 6.47, 11.48, and 12.01 respectively in their last elections (the United Kingdom's Indices prior in the four elections prior to the last one averaged between 15 and 17). France's two-round system produced an index of 21.12, while Denmark and New Zealand, using proportional representation and mixed-member proportional representation, scored 0.79 and 2.73. Greece used proportional representation in the legislative elections of June 1989, November 1989, and 1990, which had lower Gallagher Indices of 4.37, 3.94, and 3.97. When the majority bonus was raised from 40 seats to 50 in the May 2012 election, the Gallagher Index nearly doubled from 7.29 in 2009 to 12.88.

She was born in Panama City in Republic of Panama in 1942. Eleta studied Fine Arts at Finch College and then later studied Social Investigation in The New School of Social Research in New York. Her study of Social Investigation lead her to tell the life stories of a variety of different people in varying social classes throughout Latin America. In the 1970’s, she took courses at the International Center of Photography (ICP) in New York with Ken Heyman and George Tice, who were both photographers. She then went on to teach at the Universidad Nacional de Costa Rica. She currently lives and works in Portobelo, Panama and has done so since the mid 1970s.

Artistic collections  Servitude Series In her description of this series Eleta writes, \\"Two continents, two countries, two residences and two generations bear silent witness … In this series I sought to discover the differences between the older and younger generations as they related to servitude. Spain Victor finds his personal identity within his role as servant. He is the personification of his art. For him, there is no division between his role and his being. There is no questioning, only a humoristic pride which dresses his person. Purit a (later infiltrated as a terrorist) is one who questions, one who challenges and defies: Her energy, like that of a caged feline was palpable, and could be felt thumping about the enormity of the house. What might she be contemplating? I often wandered....Panamá as Rosa polished the silver, each piece engraved with the family´s coat of arms, she paused periodically to study her own reflection: Most of her life had been spent within the confines of this family residence, which she had grown to consider her own, given that she had scarcely known any other. During The United States’ invasion of Panamá, Romi decided to grab a hunting rifle, which she found in my brother´s closet. The people in our neighborhood were frightened, imagining seen Noriega´s “dignity batallions” looting and burning nearby houses. I had never witnessed such intensity in Romi as I did the moment she brandished that weapon. As I photographed her, I remember thinking: Honestly, who would she really like to shoot?\\" (http://www.sandraeleta.com/en/collections.html). Portobelo Series In her description of the Portobelo series Eleta writes, \\"It could be said that with this series, my life and photography became one. When I arrived in Portobelo, in the early seventies’, I began photographing those who engaged me in some profound way, who seemed to resonate that which I felt deepest within me. Naturally wanting to more, I drew nearer and dug deeper, hoping to fathom the very depths of their souls. I of course understood that I could not accomplish this alone, but eventually, winning their trust, they revealed themselves to me willingly, allowing their auras to repose in my lens. Then, much like an invitation to dance, we found ourselves locked in a mutual rhythm, completely unencumbered, completely in-tune. It was in this way the protagonist of this story revealed themselves to me: Josefa, a healer of the “evil eye,” locally known as a “curandera”; Palanca, who only seemed to find solace in the arms of his grandmother, Ventura; Putulungo, the octopus fisherman, who much like his prey could instantly change his interior from light to dark; Dulce, a little girl light in years, but possessing all the wisdom and tenacity of her cimarrón ancestors; Catalina, Queen of the Congos. It could also be said, that with this series my photographic identity was born, and that as I came face to face with these images for the first time, I felt I was looking at myself, but from a renewed point of view (http://www.sandraeleta.com/en/collections.html).

Before the Iranian Revolution, he was a member of the People's Mujahedin of Iran (MEK). After joining the Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps, he was appointed as a leader of the Red Handkerchief during the Iran-Iraq War. Vesali was killed in Gilan-e Gharb at the age of 30. Biography Vesali left Iran to receive military training. He was arrested and imprisoned by the Pahlavi dynasty because of his support for MEK. He was released in late 1976 and did not continue his activities with MEK. In the beginning of the Islamic Revolution, Vesali was responsible for the Barrack-3 forces' mission to find and arrest members of the Forqan Group. After the Iranian Revolution, Vesali became a member of the Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps and was one of the founders of the Foreign Intelligence department. He was then moved to the west of Iran after several attacks had occurred there. He formed groups of soldiers and called them \\"Red Handkerchief\\".

T. Barnum. The daughter of a successful English cotton mill owner, she started a relationship with Barnum, who was 40 years her senior. After the death of Barnum's first wife in 1873, they married the following year in both London and New York City. After his death in 1891, Barnum left Fish a large annuity, making her a wealthy widow. Four years later, after an accidental meeting in Egypt, she married Demetrius Callias Bey, an Ottoman diplomat, nobleman and businessman. Their marriage in New York City was sensationalised in the American press but was cut short by the early death of Callias in 1896. Two years later, she entered into a mutually beneficial business-like marriage with the Baron Lucien D'Alexandry D'Orengiani, a French nobleman. She lived out the rest of her life in Europe as a baroness and died in 1927. She was cremated and buried next to her second husband. A posthumous biography was published by The New Yorker magazine. Early life Nancy Fish was born in Blackburn, Lancashire on 22 April 1850 to Martha (née Shaw) and John Fish, a Manchester cotton mill owner. John Fish credited his own business success to reading the autobiography of the successful businessman P. T. Barnum. In 1858, her father met Barnum at a lecture at the Free Trade Hall in Manchester and thanked him for the inspiration he had provided. The two subsequently became close friends; John Fish named a pair of his engines \\"Barnum\\" and \\"Charity\\" (after Barnum's wife) and threw a party for General Tom Thumb when he was exhibiting in England; Barnum dedicated a chapter of his autobiography to John Fish. Due to her father's business success, by 1871 Nancy Fish and her family had moved to a large house in the relatively upmarket North Meols, near Southport, Lancashire. Around this time, Fish began writing letters to Barnum. Marriage to Barnum P. T. Barnum, pictured in 1885, was Fish's first husband. Fish accompanied Barnum during his European tours and was in constant communication with him through writing. It was rumoured that they were already in a relationship prior to the death of Barnum's first wife Charity on 19 November 1873. Indeed, upon hearing of Charity's death, Barnum travelled to Southport to be with Fish and her father John, and did not attend his wife's funeral. Fish married Barnum twice in 1874, at the Strand in London on 14 February and then at a Greek Orthodox church in New York City on 15 September in front of a large crowd. They honeymooned at the Windsor Hotel in New York City. She was 40 years his junior and described in the American press as \\"a young pretty Lancashire lass\\". The marriage was reported to be a happy one, with Barnum's children from his first marriage being devoted to their new stepmother, despite their similar ages. Together the couple planned, built and furnished a new house in Bridgeport, Connecticut called Marina. Barnum died on 7 April 1891, leaving his widow $100,000, their home Marina, and an annuity of $40,000. The large size of the legacy displeased Barnum's children. As a widow, she applied for and received an American passport and travelled Europe before returning to the United States. On 4 July 1893, she unveiled the statue of her late husband at Seaside Park in Bridgeport. Fish does not appear as a character in the 2017 Barnum-inspired musical film The Greatest Showman, despite in reality being his wife during some of the film's events. Marriage to Callias In 1894, Fish visited Egypt where she was presented with a mummy that was being donated to the Scientific Society in Bridgeport. It was on this trip that she met Demetrius Callias Bey, an Ottoman diplomat, nobleman and olive industry businessman of Greek descent. They had supposedly met when she fell from the Great Pyramid and was caught by Callias. The same year, she put Marina on the market and left Connecticut. Fish married Callias on 8 August 1895 at Annunciation Greek Orthodox Church in New York City, and only a few close friends knew of the ceremony. After their wedding ceremony they sailed to Paris and travelled Europe before arriving at Callias's estates on the island of Melita. Fish soon learned that Callias, who spoke little English, had exaggerated his wealth and, upon her return to New York City in March 1896, there were rumours that the couple would separate. However, this was denied by her close relatives. Callias died of liver failure on 22 September 1896 while Fish was in the United States, after which she sailed to Europe and never returned. Later life After the death of her second husband, Fish moved to Paris where she lived in an apartment near the Arc de Triomphe. In 1898, she married a French nobleman, Lucien Hyppolyte Ferdinand Marie, Baron d’Alexandry d’Orengiani. The marriage was mutually beneficial and business- like, the baron was able to clear his debts with some of Fish's money, and Fish gained the title of baroness and societal connections. As a baroness Fish kept residences in Paris, Aix-les-Bains and Menton. She socialised with American expatriates, French nobility, members of P. T. Barnum's family, and European royals including Empress Eugénie. Her French husband died in 1919, by which point he and Fish were living separately, however this did not stop her from being the lead mourner at his funeral. Death Fish died in Paris on 23 June 1927, possibly due to complications from a series of strokes she suffered eighteen months earlier. News of her death was telegraphed to Bridgeport, Connecticut, and reported in the New York Times. She was cremated and then buried next to her second husband in the English Square of Grand Jas cemetery in Cannes, Provence-Alpes-Côte d'Azur, France.Graveon cgpc06.org (Alley 15/2) A posthumous biography was published in The New Yorker magazine in April 1936.

It is one of only three species in the order Velatida to be found in shallow water in the tropics. The young are brooded in a cavity underneath a \\"supradorsal\\" membrane. Taxonomy and evolution This starfish was first described in 1882 by marine biologist Percy Sladen as Retaster insignis, Retaster being a small segregate genus of Pteraster. In 1940, the genus had to change its name after Walter Kenrick Fisher noted that the type species of Retaster he had himself designated (as Perrier, the original coiner, had failed to do so), Pteraster capensis was in fact a sound species of Pteraster, which automatically made the former genus a synonym of the latter. The genus known as Retaster required a new name, and the one Fisher coined was Euretaster, with R. insignis as its type species. The order Velatida are presumed to be the earliest lineage of living sea stars to diverge from the ancestral line, their closest living relatives being the abyssal sea daisies in the order Peripodida. The three members of the genus Euretaster are the only tropical, shallow-water species in the order Velatida, the remaining members living at abyssal depths. It might be presumed that the order has its origin in deep water, however there are numerous shallow-water fossils of velatidans dating from the Cretaceous period and it seems that these ancient forms have largely been driven out of shallow water habitats by competition from recent, more-advanced taxa. Description This small starfish is star- shaped and has five stubby arms. The aboral (upper) surface has an inflated appearance due to it being covered by a \\"supradorsal\\" membrane; this is supported by bundles of spinelets borne on the flat plates that are arranged in a mosaic pattern on the cuticle below. This membrane encloses a supradorsal cavity filled with sea water, which is connected to the water column by a central osculum (aperture), which opens and closes periodically. The membrane has a reticulated pattern of ridges and small conical protrusions. It is patterned in some combination of red, white and brown. Distribution and habitat Euretaster insignis is native to the tropical western central Pacific Ocean from the intertidal zone down to about . It is found on coral reefs, rocky coasts, sand and muddy rubble. Ecology The sexes are separate in Euretaster insignis. Instead of being planktonic, the developing embryos are brooded in the supradorsal cavity, and even receive nourishment from the mother in the form of a mucosal secretion from the cuticle; they receive this because their presence irritates the lining of the cavity causing it to secrete the fluid in a process that has been described as \\"cannibalistic ectoparasitism\\". The larvae are brooded until they are about in diameter at which time they are liberated as juvenile starfish into the sea.

The death of the Governor required the calling of a special gubernatorial election for 2 June 2019. This election was made simultaneous with special elections from five municipalities in the state whose initial 2018 elections had been nullified. Timeline In the immediate aftermath of Alonso's death, Jesús Rodríguez Almeida, the general secretary of government, was named as the acting governor of Puebla, though state law would require the state legislature to appoint an interim leader and call a special election. On January 21, the state legislature selected 85-year-old Guillermo Pacheco Pulido, former Puebla City mayor and president of the state Supreme Court, as interim governor. A week later, on the 28th, the legislature set the election date for June 2, with the winner taking office on August 1. On February 6, the organization of the state election was taken on by the National Electoral Institute (INE), including the gubernatorial race and special elections in five municipalities. The TEPJF had voided elections in the five municipalities—Ocoyucan, Cañada Morelos, Ahuazotepec, Mazapiltepec de Juárez and Tepeojuma—as a result of violations in the handling of ballot papers and irregularities at polling places. Coalitions and common candidacies Juntos Haremos Historia en Puebla (Morena-PT-PVEM) On March 13, the INE approved the coalition Juntos Haremos Historia en Puebla (Together We'll Make History in Puebla), consisting of the National Regeneration Movement (Morena), Labor Party (PT) and Ecologist Green Party of Mexico (PVEM). The Social Encounter Party (PES), which lost its national and state registrations in the wake of 2018, will participate in three of the five municipal special elections, as it had been a part of the original races. Morena will select its candidate by way of a poll of its members, between senator Alejandro Armenta Mier, 2018 candidate Miguel Barbosa Huerta, and senator Nancy de la Sierra Arámburo, though the final results will not be made public. PAN-PRD-MC The National Action Party, Party of the Democratic Revolution and Citizens' Movement will run a common candidate: Enrique Cárdenas Sánchez, history professor and former rector of the Universidad de las Américas. As a result of the common candidacy (as opposed to a coalition), each party will retain its own political advertising. Other parties Institutional Revolutionary Party The national organization of the Institutional Revolutionary Party selected Alberto Jiménez Merino, an agricultural scientist and former rector of the Universidad Autónoma Chapingo, as its candidate on March 5. New Alliance Party Nueva Alianza announced on March 5 that it would not run a candidate in the election.

Description  Fossils of Spheniscus muizoni The holotype material consists of a partial postcranial skeleton, subcomplete left and right coracoid, subcomplete right scapula, a subcomplete left and right humerus, the left complete ulna, proximal and distal end of the right femur, the complete right and proximal end of the left tibiotarsus, the proximal end of the left fibula, the right complete tarsometatarsus, the cranial portion of the sternum with articular sulcus for coracoid and fragment of the craniolateral process, two fragmentary thoracic vertebrae from the caudal region, seven caudal vertebrae and a fragmentary synsacrum.Göhlich, 2007, p.287 Paratype fossils of the species consist of isolated bones; a distal fragmentary half of left coracoid, the right subcomplete coracoid, a left complete ulna, left complete radius, right complete carpometacarpus, the distal end of a right femur, the cranial end of pygostyle and a rib fragment without ends. The body mass of the penguin species has been estimated to , making it smaller than the Magellanic penguin at and distinctly smaller than the Humboldt penguin, but larger than the Galapagos penguin, which has a body mass of . Detailed comparisons with extant and fossil species of Spheniscus suggest that the available postcranial bones of S. muizoni morphologically correspond best with those of Spheniscus urbinai from the same formation, aside from that the latter is distinctly larger. Based on the morphological similarity of Spheniscus muizoni S. urbinai and their stratigraphical succession within the Pisco Formation, it can be supposed that the first gave directly rise at least to the latter.S. muizoni is the only known penguin species from the Cerro la Bruja locality and is unknown from any older or younger deposit in or outside the Pisco Formation. Spheniscus muizoni is not only the oldest penguin species in the Pisco Formation, but also representing the stratigraphically oldest record for the extant genus Spheniscus in general.Göhlich, 2007, p.296  Paleoecology  Atocetus iquensis Pelagornis The Pisco Formation has a long age range, from about 15 Ma (Middle Miocene; Colloncuran) to approximately 2 Ma (Early Pleistocene; Uquian in the SALMA classification). The formation at the Cerro la Bruja paleontological site is characterized by tuffaceous sandstones, siltstones and diatomaceous siltstones with a basal conglomerate. Hardgrounds are present at the location. The depositional environment of the Pisco Formation at this locality is interpreted as a shallow to deeper shelf setting.Cerro la Bruja at Fossilworks.org The fossil record indicates a faunal change of Spheniscus species within the stratigraphically older sequence of the Pisco Formation. While Spheniscus megaramphus is found at the Late Miocene Montemar Norte location, and Spheniscus humboldti is recovered from the Early Pleistocene Yauca locality,Stucchi, 2007, p.370 S. muizoni occurs exclusively in the oldest deposits (latest middle/earliest late Miocene, 13–11 Ma; Serravallian, or Laventan SALMA) and was probably replaced by the persistent S. urbinai, which is found in strata dating from the Late Miocene to the Early Pliocene (9 to 3.5 Ma).Göhlich, 2007, p.297Stucchi, 2007, p.369 The formation in other, mostly younger, locations has provided an exceptionally rich faunal assemblage of toothed whales, baleen whales, dolphins, seals, swimming sloths (Thalassocnus),De Muizon et al., 2004 and other birds (among which other Spheniscus penguins). Acrophyseter deinodon At Cerro la Bruja, fossils of rays (Myliobatis sp.), sharks (among which megalodon), other birds (Pelagornis), bony fish (Triglidae, Xiphiidae and Alosinae),Báez Gómez, 2006, p.66 and the cetaceans Acrophyseter robustus,Lambert et al., 2008 Atocetus iquensis,De Muizon, 1988, p.131 Brachydelphis mazeasi,De Muizon, 1988, p.82 and Belonodelphis peruanus were found.De Muizon, 1988, p.192 In all extant Spheniscus species pelagic school fish (mostly anchovies) is the dominant prey; cephalopods and crustaceans are subordinate. Because the skull of Spheniscus muizoni is lacking, no information is available on the shape of the bill, which varies at least in some extant penguin genera and their preferred diet.

It was built about 1908, during a period of major residential development of the area, and is a good example of Colonial Revival architecture in brick and stone. The building was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 2013. Description and history The Samuel Edelman Apartments are located in a mainly residential area of Dorchester, on the north side of Norfolk Street between Elmhurst and Darling Streets. It is a single building, three stories in height, organized with four entrances placed pairwise in surrounds flanked by projecting rounded bays. The exterior is mainly brick, with a stone water table, stone corner quoining, sills and lintels, and stone entrance surrounds. Each section of the building houses three residential units, one on each floor. The apartment block was probably built about 1908, when an occupancy permit was issued for its addresses. During this period there was a broad migration into the more residential areas of Dorchester from the densely populated neighborhoods of Boston's North and West Ends, and the city of Chelsea. Although a significant portion of this migration was Jewish, census records show that most of this building's early occupants were from a diversity of backgrounds, and it is not until a second wave of Jewish migration in the 1930s that its occupancy was mainly Jewish. Most of the occupants had middle-class occupations.

The vehicles were converted dustbin lorries manufactured by Shelvoke and Drewry and adapted for use by elderly people. \\"The service was the brainchild\\" of Bill W. R. Gates, a businessman who had made his fortune in New Zealand before returning to his native England. He registered the name Tramocar as a trademark and procured and converted 13 vehicles for use on various routes around the town. Tramocar services ran from 1924 until 1942—latterly operated by bus company Southdown Motor Services, which introduced a further two Tramocars—but a replica vehicle is still operational at a museum in West Sussex. Background Until the late 18th century Worthing was a \\"small and primitive settlement\\" in the parish of Broadwater, consisting of a manor house, modest housing for fishermen, common land and some fields. The development of nearby Brighton as a fashionable resort encouraged slow growth, helped in 1804 by the opening of a turnpike which connected the village to London and other parts of Sussex. Growth continued throughout the 19th century as Worthing became popular with convalescents and retired people. Borough status was granted in 1890, by which time the population was nearly 15,000. By the early 20th century, public transport consisted of railway services to Brighton, London and nearby towns, and buses (successively horse-drawn, steam-powered and petrol-driven) to Brighton and within the town. The Worthing Motor Omnibus Company was founded in 1904 to provide competition with horse-drawn vehicles. The Shelvoke and Drewry Freighter Many Shelvoke and Drewry Freighters were used for waste collection, as in this example. In September 1923, in response to demand for a vehicle able to carry heavy and bulky loads without requiring lifting gear, the specialist commercial vehicle design and manufacturing company Shelvoke and Drewry of Letchworth, Hertfordshire introduced the \\"Freighter\\" (or \\"S.D. Freighter\\"). This was a small but high-capacity lorry with an unusually low loading height— above the ground—and a \\"remarkably small\\" turning circle of , giving it flexibility and manoeuvrability. It was also easy to control, as all braking, acceleration and gear change actions were undertaken using a multi- function handle similar to those found in trams. A tiller served to steer the vehicle. The handle would not operate without a safety pedal being depressed, and there was also an emergency footbrake. The vehicle was an \\"instant success\\", and about 2,500 were produced in the 15 years to 1938. Although suitable for various functions, the Freighter was \\"primarily built for municipal use as a dustcart\\". Several municipal transport operators also put them to use in the construction of tramways, where they were well suited to carrying lengths of rail and other construction materials. Shelvoke and Drewry envisaged the Freighter as a lorry: it was \\"not really intended for the passenger carrying market\\". Bill Gates Bill (W.R.) Gates was born in London in 1883 or 1884. After travelling extensively, including to New Zealand where he owned a business, he moved to Worthing in the early 1920s and lived at 141 Brighton Road, the main seafront road and a busy bus route. He regularly noticed elderly people struggling to get on and off the high-stepped Southdown Motor Services motor buses in use at the time. Deciding there was a gap in the market for this need and for a new route running along the whole seafront from East Worthing to West Worthing, he ordered two S.D. Freighters and commissioned a London-based coachbuilder to convert them from dustbin lorries into buses. The body was designed around the characteristics of the chassis, with its transverse-mounted front engine, short wheelbase, small solid wheels and even weight distribution across both axles. Behind the front wheel, two shallow steps with handrails led to an interior with a centre aisle flanked by five rows of paired seats and four single seats on the door side, with four seats across the rear giving a total capacity of 18 passengers. The wide, deep seat cushions were designed to be \\"of maximum comfort\\" to elderly people. The sides were partly open, but fabric blinds offered some protection from the weather; the rear opening was glazed. Introduction of Tramocar services On 8 January 1924, Bill Gates applied to Worthing Borough Council for a licence to operate one converted S.D. Freighter on a route between Worthing Pier and Sea View Road to the west. The application was granted in April 1924. He registered the name \\"Tramocar\\" as a trademark, and at Easter 1924 the first Worthing Tramocar service ran on its route along the seafront. The event was reported in the Worthing Herald newspaper, which illustrated the vehicle. By early June 1924 a second vehicle was delivered by the coachbuilders, and the service level was doubled with effect from 9 June. On that Whit Monday, one of the drivers estimated he had carried 1,200 passengers, each paying a 2d. single fare. Bill Gates sometimes drove the vehicles as well. Meanwhile, he established a garage on Wordsworth Road where the drivers would perform maintenance on the Tramocars on Sundays, when no services ran. The solid tyres needed regular skimming to maintain their shape, which was done by a local engineering company. A third vehicle entered the fleet in October 1924, followed by others in March 1925 and July 1927. Battery-powered lamps were used instead of the oil lamps fitted on the first vehicles. A bigger change took place in 1930, when three new vehicles were added to the fleet. These had larger wheels with pneumatic tyres, giving a better ride quality and a higher top speed of at the expense of the low floor level: the entrance had to be placed higher and the steps were made steeper, \\"to the dismay of [the elderly] as they had become used to the lower floor level of the earlier models\\". The original 1924 vehicles were sold as surplus to requirements in 1934 to Jersey's municipal bus operator. The introduction of the new vehicles, which were also fully enclosed, allowed the initial \\"Waterfront service\\" to be expanded to new routes. Their original \\"rather unappealing\\" appearance was also improved. From the third vehicle onwards, the body was modified to put the entrance at the rear, and two extra seats were added. From June 1933, an improved version of the Shelvoke and Drewry chassis was combined with a \\"handsome-looking 26-seater body\\" designed by Thomas Harrington Coachbuilders, one of the largest companies in nearby Hove and a major producer of bus bodies. The final new vehicles delivered under Bill Gates's ownership of the company arrived in 1934 and had conventional steering, as tiller steering mechanisms were now illegal on new vehicles. Southdown ownership Southdown moved the Tramocars to their depot on the seafront. Southdown Motor Services had formed in 1915, absorbing the former Worthing Motor Omnibus Company and two others, and by 1921 operated six bus routes using conventional vehicles. Their headquarters was in central Worthing, although they operated across Sussex. On 1 April 1938 Southdown bought Tramocars Ltd from Bill Gates, who had been given medical advice to reduce his activities. The limited company was formed in 1932 with Gates and his wife as sole directors and shareholders. It had been consistently profitable, and Southdown paid £15,750 for the shares. The original garage was closed and vehicles were stabled at the Southdown garage on the seafront. In July 1938 Southdown withdrew two of the older vehicles and replaced them with the final new Tramocars: these were of \\"a very advanced\\" design with an overhauled chassis, a rear engine and a newly designed 26-seater body (again by Thomas Harrington Coachbuilders) with a central entrance. The floor was now even higher, negating Bill Gates's original concept for a vehicle \\"specially designed for the elderly\\". The red and gold livery used on all the pre- Southdown Tramocars was also replaced with Southdown's cream and green house colours on these new vehicles, although no others were repainted until May 1939. Also in 1939, Southdown began to replace Tramocars with conventional single-deck buses such as Dennis Falcons and Leyland Tigers. The three oldest Tramocars were sold in 1938, another went in 1940, two more were sold to a vehicle dealer in 1941 and the last seven vehicles in the fleet were disposed of in July 1942. More Leyland Tigers had superseded them, and wartime reductions in services (particularly in April 1941) reduced the peak vehicle requirement. Routes and services The eastern terminus of Tramocar services was Splash Point, an open air swimming pool (left of picture) on Brighton Road. The first Tramocar service ran on 21 April 1924 along Worthing seafront from the pier to Sea View Road, just short of Grand Avenue—the main road of West Worthing, laid out in the 1870s. The eastern terminus was soon extended to Splash Point, an outdoor swimming pool and leisure centre, as originally proposed in the licence application. The success of this experimental service, and the demands of residents in the Grand Avenue area (which was poorly served by Southdown), led him to order a second vehicle and seek permission to extend the route along Grand Avenue to railway station. After the third and fourth vehicles were acquired, Gates applied successfully to increase the service frequency to every 10 minutes. A special late-evening express service from Worthing Pier, with a higher fare of 3d., was authorised in March 1926, and Sunday services were also operated during that summer. Gates's next applications for route extensions were unsuccessful as they were thought to impinge on Southdown routes, but in 1930 a new service was given permission. This was operated separately from the original route, and the two routes each had a 20-minute frequency. After West Worthing station, the second route ran back towards the town centre, passing the central library and main post office before turning there and returning via the same streets. This was almost a circular service, and Gates applied unsuccessfully to extend the route from the post office to the pier and Splash Point along the central shopping streets (Chapel Road and South Street). After requests by shopkeepers in Rowlands Road, another major shopping street, Gates diverted one route to run along there in 1934. At the same time both routes were upgraded to a 15-minute frequency. No further route extensions were made, although Gates had unfulfilled ambitions of serving the new housing in the rapidly developing Goring-by-Sea area. Both routes were reduced in 1935: route 1 had its frequency cut to one bus every 10 minutes, and route 2 now terminated at West Worthing station and no longer continued to the central library and post office (only route 1 now served this section). After Southdown took over in 1938, the routes were renumbered twice before being merged into a single route. Postwar events The last link to the \\"interesting event in the history of Worthing's public transport\\" was removed in February 1946 when the former Tramocar route 1, now renumbered 11, was rerouted. Nevertheless, many older residents still referred to the replacement Leyland buses as \\"Tramocars\\" throughout the 1950s, reflecting the 18-year history of Gates's vehicles in the town and the popularity among elderly residents of the service, with its \\"unorthodox\\" and \\"quaint little vehicles\\" and comfortable interiors. After selling his business to Southdown, Gates retired and returned to New Zealand for some time before moving back to Worthing, where he died in 1947. The former Tramocars had various fates. The original two vehicles were sold for use in Jersey in 1934; the fourth was bought by a laundry in nearby Portslade in 1938; a few months later a vehicle dealer in Middlesex bought the third and fifth; numbers 6 and 7 both ended up abandoned in Sussex (at Shoreham Airport and on a caravan site respectively) despite being sold to a vehicle broker in London; Brighton Corporation bought number 8 and converted it into a mobile canteen; and of the seven remaining Tramocars sold by Southdown in July 1942, four were used in Staffordshire as transport for wartime munitions workers and the status of the other three is unknown. A 1920s Shelvoke & Drewry freighter chassis was acquired by preservationists in the 1990s and was used to build a replica Worthing Tramocar. The chassis belonged to a municipal dustbin lorry built for the city of Truro in Cornwall. The replica was built at the Amberley Museum & Heritage Centre, where it is housed as an exhibit and gives rides around the site. It bears the registration number BP 9822, the number of the first Tramocar in the fleet. In July 1997, it was driven from the museum to Worthing where it was one of the attractions of a five-day fair on the seafront.

It was first published in hardback on May 26, 2015 by HarperCollins Publishers. Upon its release it was named a CBC Canada Reads Finalist, OLA Evergreen Award and a KOBO Emerging Writer Prize. The book is known for its inclusion of Cree Law and its commentary on Canadian Colonialism.  Plot summary  Birdie follows the journey of titular character Birdie, on her way to Gibsons, British Columbia from her home in northern Alberta. Birdie has ventured to Gibsons in order to find Pat John (Jesse from the Beachcombers) who she views as representative of a healthy Indigenous man. Birdie's journey to Gibsons served as the impetus for the spiritual journey that Birdie goes on, which exists outside of linear time.  Characters  * Bernice/Birdie: Bernice is the main character, a Cree woman, and the story centres around her journey healing from extensive trauma. She is also referred to as Birdie, an affectionate nickname. In the dreamscape, she sometimes appears as her birdself. * Auntie Val: Bernice's aunt, also known as littlemother whom Bernice lives with her for period of time. Val participates in Bernice's healing by coming to her niece and caring for her in her presumed despondency. * Skinny Freda: Freda is Bernice's cousin and childhood friend. Bernice attempted to protect Freda throughout their childhood. Freda comes to rescue Bernice from her despondency, and is a key component in Bernice's healing throughout the novel. * Maggie: Bernice's mother, representative of Missing and Murdered Indigenous Women and Girls. Maggie's character appears most often outside of linear time, showing up in dreamscapes and visions Bernice has about her past. * Lola: Lola is Bernice's boss at Lola's Little Slice of Heaven where Bernice works as well as lives. Lola's character appears in the present timeline and facilitates the calls to Freda and Val to come and take care of Bernice when Bernice becomes despondent. Lola participants in Bernice's healing journey alongside Freda and Val.  Themes   Cree traditional knowledge   Pimatisewin  In the novel, Pimatisewin represents the tree of life whose health is inexplicably tied to Bernice's. Pimatisewin is regarded as a relative by both Bernice and Maggie, and is used by Lindberg to portray non-human bonds of kinship and the obligations implicit in those bonds. Lindberg, in the author interview, explains that Pimatisewin is a Cree word that roughly translates to \\"the good life\\" in English. Eenou Pimaatisiiwin, as it is sometimes spelled, is an essential aspect of Cree traditional knowledge and represents an element of Cree survival.  Acimowin  Acimowin means story in Cree. Throughout the novel, usually at the end of chapters, these stories, or acimowin, get told as an oral history of the lessons Bernice learns throughout her journey. Acimowin represent the way in which Cree people pass down certain life lessons.  Cree law  A central tenet of Cree law, called Wahkohtowin, is used in the novel Birdie. The principle of Wahkohtowin is that people treat one another with respect and care. Through the use of story, Lindberg explores situations in which these laws are broken. Lindberg has said that the obligations of this law have been broken by people in Bernice’s life, and her childhood home lacked reciprocal obligations.  Historical context   Indian Act  Auntie Val, when she tells a bit of her story, relates that her grandmother's people had not signed their rights away to the Treaty Commissioner. Val goes as far as to say that \\"her people. . .have not been colonized or 'Indian Acted' to death, but because they did not sign any treaties their family was not legally allowed to live on the reserve in Loon Lake. Lindberg expands on this point in the author interview when she states that Bernice's family had a home on the reserve but they could not inhabit that house because they were not status Indians. The Indian Act was one of the ways in which the Canadian government tried to control Indigenous identity while simultaneously dispossessing Indigenous peoples of their lands.  Missing and murdered indigenous women  Birdie deals with the ongoing Canadian political issue of Missing and murdered Indigenous women. 84%of Indigenous women experience violence, with 10% of all missing person cases in Canada being Indigenous women and girls. In the context of Birdie, Maggie represents this fraught history between Canada and Indigenous women. Maggie disappears at the end of the novel, Lindberg writing \\"she chose this city and this neighbourhood because she knows someone like her can disappear here\\" which speaks to the significance of the problem. Lindberg's choice to include a commentary on MMIW stems from her advocacy work in the area.  Reception  Métis scholar and professor Aubrey Hanson wrote about Birdie in her article, \\"Reading for Reconciliation? Indigenous Literatures in a Post-TRC Canada.\\" Hanson argues that Birdie demonstrates the possibilities of non-Indigenous people reading Indigenous texts for the resurgence of Indigenous communities. At CBC Canada Reads in 2016, 10,000 copies of Birdie were donated to Canadian schools by Bruce Poon Tip, the defender of Lindberg’s novel. He believed that Birdie is important to the reconciliation process between Canada and Indigenous communities.

The word \\"Comfa\\" is used by non-practitioners as a generic term for spirit possession in Guyana. However, the word \\"Comfa\\" is also a term to define the greater folk religion involving spirit possession originating in Guyana. History The origins of Comfa come from the many religious traditions of the many peoples who settled in Guyana. Of these beliefs the main influences seem to be Christianity and African practices, specifically Kongo religion. The main Kongo influences on Comfa are the cosmology believed and the idea that the world can be altered through the creation of charms. Comfa can be traced back to early worship of the water spirit \\"Watermamma\\" (known as Mami Wata elsewhere) amongst enslaved Guyanese. After emancipation Christian missionaries began to try populate Guiana and their teachings began to influence early Comfa beliefs. By the 1880s a man named Joseph MacLaren from Grenada along with Nathaniel Jordan founded a church in Guiana and formally began teaching Comfa practices under the title of \\"Faithism,\\" popularly called the Jordanites. Beliefs Cosmology The cosmos are made up of a realm known as the \\"Heights\\" inhabited by Christian figures like angels, biblical prophets, and apostles. At the center of the universe is nature and humans. Below the natural world is the \\"Terrestrial Realm\\" where dead souls dwell. God resides outside of these realms because he is the creator and protector of all things. Because these spirits have already gone through life they possess a wisdom to advise those who are currently living. Of these spirits there are differences, there are entrees, deities, family, and friends spirits. The entrees are spirits embodying seven different ethnic groups that shaped Guyana, Africans, Indigenous people, Chinese, Dutch, East Indians, English, and Spanish. The deity spirits are the Hindu gods. The family and friends spirits are those who are family or friends of the deities or entrees. The terrestrial spirits reside in the sea and in creeks but spirits still close to Mother Earth may still reside on Earth. Mother Earth is the entity that spurs on life on Earth. Within Mother Earth rests graveyard residing spirits and wandering spirits who have been called for but never returned to the graveyard. Orisha worship and Ifa practices coming from Yoruba religion are also present in the practices and worldview of Comfa. Worship At Celestial Services a worshiper may pray to god and ask for things he/she desires, and certain spirits may be asked to assist in realizing these desires. At a Work service the spirits of an Entree may be called upon while practitioners dance to the beat of drums. Spirits may pass by and manifest themselves in the practitioners.

Biography  Maciej Trapola was an Italian architect working primarily in Poland in the early 17th century. Trapola's architectural style was Baroque with characteristics of Mannerism. Most, if not all of Trapola's structures were built in the Polish town of Nowy Wisnicz for then owner Stanislaw Lubomirski. Lubomirski was a Polish general who had inherited ownership of the town from his father. During the time of Lubomirskis ownership he ordered Trapola to build several structures as well as fortifications for existing structures. Trapola is also credited with the urban planning of Nowy Wisnicz into its current grid layout. The main focal points of the grid layout are the Town Square and Town Hall.  Legacy  Some of Trapola's work can still be seen in the small Polish region of Nowy Wisnicz. The Nowy Wisnicz castle continues to sit proudly atop the hill overlooking the small town and featured the fortifications that were added by Trapola around 1615-1621. Another example of Trapola's work in Nowy Wisnicz is the Assumption of the Blessed Virgin Mary Catholic Church. This church is still actively used to this day.

The location is in a small alley adjacent to the Pistoia Cathedral, within the most ancient set (first set) of city walls. In the 19th century, the palace was donated to the diocese and now is used as both Diocesan museum and for the display of the collection donated by Clemente Rospigliosi. Description The original owners of the structures at this site was the Dondoli family, but later sold to the Rospigliosi-Sozzifanti family in the 16th century. They rebuilt the house and adjacent structures into the present structure. They were related to the Rospigliosi family owning the Palazzo Rospigliosi a Via del Duca, where Giulio Rospiglio, later Pope Clement IX was born in 1600.Pistoia e il suo territorio: Pescia e i suoi dintorni: guida del forestiero, by Giuseppe Tigri, Tipografia Cino, Pistoia (1853): pages 162. The pope supposedly may have stayed in this palace during his visit to Pistoia. Clemente Rospigliosi, who died in 1981, endowed the palace to the diocese with instructions to preserve it and some of the contents in part as a museum dedicated to his papal ancestor. The Rospigliosi collection held furniture, decorations, and artworks including fresco decorations that bedecked the palace during the Pope's visit to his native town. Among the works are an altarpiece by Fra Paolino and a Bath of Bathsheba by Sebastiano Vini. Other painters in collection are Jacopo Vignali, Lorenzo Lippi, Felice Ficarelli, and a Death of Germanicus attributed to a follower of Nicolas Poussin. Among the works by Giacinto Gimignani displayed are: *Joseph and the Wife of Potiphar *Labors of Hercules *Adam, Eve with Cain and Abel *Brothers expose the Coat of Joseph *Joseph explains the dreams to the Pharoah The Diocesan Museum was moved from the Bishop's palace on via Puccini here in 1968.

Pressed by his haste to get home as soon as possible, he does not notice that a lady has slipped a silk stocking into his suit pocket which, upon his return, is immediately discovered by Molly. She and George Bagnall, a friend of the family, learn that in another similar case, it ended in divorce. Judge Moore, their mutual friend, thinks it well to teach the two quarrelsome spouses a lesson and suggests that Molly get a divorce. She, although reluctantly, agrees to separate from her husband. While the two are at the seaside, visiting friends, the young wife is unable to hide her unhappiness.

He married Sarah Dale, daughter of Rev. Hugh Dale. His brothers Hon. Edward, James and Stephen Cornwallis were also Members of Parliament. Cornwallis was returned unopposed as Member of Parliament for the family seat of Eye at the 1727 British general election with his elder brother Stephen. He voted regularly with the Government and was appointed Equerry to Prince of Wales in about 1731. He spoke against the repeal of the Septennial Act in 1734. At the 1734 British general election he was returned unopposed with his brother again. In 1737, he gave up his post of equerry to the Prince when the Prince of Wales went into opposition, because the pension he had from the King was worth more than the salary from his place. He was returned unopposed with his brother again at the 1741 British general election. At the end of Walpole's Administration he voted with the Opposition on Pulteney's motion for a secret committee to inquire into the war, on account of which his brother, Lord Cornwallis, turned him out of doors next day.

Background Sivo grew up in Nadi, Fiji. He played his junior rugby league for the Gundagai Tigers. Sivo started his rugby league career playing for the Gundagai Tigers before playing for St. Mary's in the Ron Massey Cup. Sivo then moved to the Mounties signing with their NSW Cup team in 2016, scoring 35 tries. The Cessnock Goannas had an opportunity early on to sign Sivo, but failed to see his superstar potential. Sivo signed with the Penrith Panthers until the end of the 2018 season, scoring 12 tries in his first season with the club. In 2018, Sivo signed a two-year deal with the Parramatta Eels. Playing career 2019 Sivo made his NRL debut in Round 1 of the 2019 NRL season against the Penrith Panthers. Sivo scored his first NRL try against the Sydney Roosters in round 3 of the 2019 NRL season, scoring two tries in a losing effort. In Round 6 2019 against Wests Tigers, Sivo scored a try as Parramatta won the match 51–6 in the opening NRL match to be played at the new Western Sydney Stadium. In Round 8 2019 against St George, Sivo scored 2 tries for Parramatta, one of which was a length of the field try. Parramatta would go on to win the match 32-18 after being down 14-0 earlier in the game. In Round 13 2019 against Cronulla-Sutherland, Sivo scored 2 tries in a losing effort as Parramatta were defeated 42–22. In Round 19 2019 against the New Zealand Warriors, Sivo famously palmed off New Zealand player Blake Ayshford on his way to the try line. Fox Sports commentator Andrew Voss said of Sivo's fend on Ayshford “If you can get a charge for palming blokes in the sternum, Sivo’s looking at 10 weeks,”. Sivo later scored a try in a 24–22 victory. In round 25 against Manly-Warringah, Sivo scored a hat-trick as Parramatta won the match 32–16 at the Western Sydney Stadium. The victory saw Parramatta finish 5th on the table at the end of the 2019 regular season. Sivo finished the 2019 NRL season with 20 tries in his rookie season, one behind Israel Folau's record of 21 tries in a rookie NRL season. In the elimination final against Brisbane, Sivo scored two tries as Parramatta won the match 58–0 at the new Western Sydney Stadium. The victory was the biggest finals win in history, eclipsing Newtown's 55–7 victory over St George in 1944. The match was also Parramatta's biggest victory over Brisbane and Brisbane's worst ever loss since entering the competition in 1988. 2020 In round 8 of the 2020 NRL season, Sivo scored four tries as Parramatta defeated North Queensland 42-4 at Bankwest Stadium. In round 11 against Wests Tigers, Sivo scored two tries as Parramatta won the game 26-16 at Bankwest Stadium.

Controversy On 28 December 2019, it was reported that Sivo had been arrested whilst on holiday visiting family in Fiji. Sivo was later charged with one count of indecent annoyance. It was alleged that Sivo harassed a female bartender at a pool party, tugging on her skirt in order to get her attention. Sivo was granted bail at Nadi Magistrate's Court but was banned from leaving Fiji and was ordered to reappear at court on 7 January 2020. The Parramatta club released a statement saying \\"The club takes these incidents seriously and will be monitoring the situation closely, As with any legal matter, it is important that we follow due process, and the club will review all information available regarding the alleged incident.

Schaal (born 7 July 1940) is an American landscape architect, educator, and firm leader notable for the broad range and diversity of his projects, including regional studies, national parks, corporate and university campuses, site planning, botanical gardens, downtowns, highways, cemeteries, and public and private gardens.Herb Schaal Landscape Architecture Papers at North Carolina State University Special Collections Research Center https://www.lib.ncsu.edu/findingaids/mc00622/summary Schaal is one of the first landscape architects to design children's gardens, beginning in the 1990s with Gateway Elementary, Gateway Middle, and Gateway Michael Elementary school grounds in St. Louis, Missouri, the Hershey Children's Garden at the Cleveland Botanical Gardens, and Red Butte Garden and Arboretum. Early life Schaal grew up in Oakland, California, where he spent many hours in the neighborhood empty lot exploring nature, digging tunnels, and building forts. His connection to nature deepened as a Boy Scout and camp counselor.Herb Schaal Oral History and Lecture at North Carolina State University Special Collections Research Center https://www.lib.ncsu.edu/findingaids/mc00615 He was also influenced at an early age by his father, Rudolf J. Schaal, a landscape architect who emigrated from Germany in the 1930s. As a teenager, Schaal accompanied his father to job sites and learned the craft of shaping the ground, building structures, and planting. After high school, Schaal attended California State Polytechnic University, Pomona and received the Bachelor of Science in Landscape Architecture degree in 1962. Career Denver Botanic Gardens-20 Little pond Coastal Maine Botanical Gardens - DSC03163 General view - San Francisco Botanical Garden - DSC09831 Schaal's first year of practice was for Kenneth R. Anderson Associates in California. In 1964, he moved to Raleigh, North Carolina to work for his former instructor, Richard Moore. Moore had become the chair of the landscape architecture department at North Carolina State University's School of Design and principal of his private practice office, Megatech. In 1966, Schaal accepted a full-time teaching position at the State University of New York College of Environmental Science and Forestry, where he earned a master's degree in landscape architecture four years later. He taught design and graphics with an emphasis on using perspective drawing as part of the design process. He developed the “Proportional Method of Perspective Drawing,” which was subsequently taught in American landscape architecture programs. This method is described in Nicholas Dines’ book, Landscape Perspective Drawing, where the author recounts a meeting over coffee with Schaal in the 1970s where Schaal “sketched a one-point perspective depth proportioning system on a table napkin that eliminated the need to project from a measured plan.” In 1970, Schaal joined the San Francisco office of Eckbo Dean Austin and Williams, later known as EDAW. His first project used geographic information system technology and an association with Jack Dangermond, founder of Esri, to site a power plant and transmission lines for the Pacific Gas and Electric Company (PG&E;) Davenport Project near Santa Cruz, California. This project established a new service for the firm which led to many large area siting studies. Schaal was then recognized as an authority on utility siting and later became an associate author of a text book on the subject. In 1974, desiring a more rural lifestyle for his family Schaal moved to Fort Collins, Colorado, where he acquired the High Meadows Ranch near Rocky Mountain National Park and established EDAW’s Rocky Mountain Office. As an EDAW principal, vice president, and board member for 18 years, he played a role in the firm's growth from 4 to 32 offices worldwide. In 1980, Schaal began providing planning and design services for the Denver Botanic Gardens, including the design of the Alpine Rock Garden, which was recognized by Garden Design Magazine as the “premier example of the art of rock gardening in North America” and national park projects including work for three of the most prestigious parks: Yellowstone National Park, Grand Canyon National Park and Yosemite National Park. During this period, Schaal also established and directed the EDAW Summer Student Program at his High Meadows Ranch, which for over 25 years, recruited promising landscape architecture students from universities to participate in real national and international projects with EDAW principals. The American Society of Landscape Architects recognized the importance of the program in 2000 with the Landscape Architecture Award of Excellence. Under Schaal's guidance EDAW’s Rocky Mountain Office grew to over 40 employees in various disciplines addressing a wide range of award-winning projects, including parks of all scales, zoos, botanical gardens, urban design, trails, waterfronts, highways and streetscapes, office parks, and environmental studies. Schaal stepped down from overseeing the office in 1988 and concentrated his efforts on sustainable planning and design of university campuses, public gardens, and private estates. During this period, he completed dozens of projects at Washington University in Saint Louis. Building on his experience with the Denver Botanic Gardens, he created master plans and designed gardens for over 20 botanical gardens and arboretums nationwide, including the Coastal Maine Botanical Gardens. In the design of children’s environments, Schaal is credited with systematically including all five senses and applying Howard Gardner’s theory of multiple intelligences. Schaal has designed “over 20 unique children’s gardens across the country,” including at the Cheyenne Botanic Gardens, the first public children's garden to be Platinum certified by Leadership in Energy and Environmental Design (LEED); the 4-acre children's garden at Morton Arboretum; and the Olson Family Roof Garden at St. Louis Children's Hospital, a horticultural therapy garden. Schaal's sustainable design work related to estates is typified by projects like Mark Rockefeller’s Eagle Rock Ranch and South Fork Lodge in Swan Valley, Idaho where Schaal was asked “to spearhead long-term improvements and environmental restoration” including “the of creation of a submerged wetland wastewater treatment system” adjacent to the Snake River. After EDAW was acquired by AECOM in 2005, Schaal remained as a principal. He continued his work on public gardens including an ambitious master plan and innovative memorial garden design for the 300-acre historic Bellefontaine Cemetery in St. Louis, Missouri. Schaal retired from AECOM in 2012 and spends most of time gardening, painting, consulting, and managing the forest at his High Meadows Ranch. The American Society of Landscape Architects has recognized his work with more than 60 regional and national awards. In 2008 Schaal was named Designer of the Year by the American Horticultural Society, which “established him as one of the most acclaimed contemporary landscape architects.” His work has been characterized by evocative drawings, on-site collaborative workshops, orderly assemblies of environmental decision-making factors, attention to sustainability, and sense of place. Schaal's drawings, design and planning reports, publications, and project photography are archived at the North Carolina State University Libraries Special Collections Research Center.Herb Schaal Landscape Architecture Papers at North Carolina State University Special Collections Research Center https://www.lib.ncsu.edu/findingaids/mc00622/summary Family Schaal married Cynthia J.

History  The Society for Freshwater Science was founded in 1953 in Havana, Illinois by 13 charter members, and was called the Midwest Benthological Society. It was later known as the North American Benthological Society before being renamed the Society for Freshwater Science.  Membership  Currently, SFS has over 1800 members. The majority of members are students and are from North America. Members are employed in academia, consulting, federal and state agencies, and other governmental positions.  Annual Meetings  SFS hosts an annual meeting for its members. On occasion, SFS has partnered with other scientific societies, such as the American Geophysical Union (AGU), the Association for the Sciences of Limnology and Oceanography (ASLO), the Phycological Society of America, and the Society of Wetland Scientists to host joint meetings.  Journal  The main publication of the Society is the journal Freshwater Science. 4 issues are published each year. The journal was first published in 1982 and called Freshwater Invertebrate Biology. In 1986 the title was changed to Journal of the North American Benthological Society, and the title was changed again in 2012 to Freshwater Science. About once a year the journal publishes open-access fact sheets called BRIDGES that cover new ideas in aquatic science using non-technical language.  Awards & Programs  SFS gives out awards annually to its members, including naming members as SFS Fellows. Recent SFS Fellows include Emily Bernhardt, Lucinda Johnson, Jennifer Tank, Valeria Souza, R. Jan Stevenson, Nancy Grimm, Mary Power, N. LeRoy Poff, Matt Whiles, Jeremy Monroe, Alan Covich, and Richard Hauer. The Instars mentoring program supports underrepresented groups in freshwater science. Students who are accepted into the program as mentees are assigned a graduate student mentor who helps them network at the Annual Meeting. SFS partners with the Stroud Center to provide an aquatic invertebrate taxonomic certification program for its members.  Outreach  SFS has several programs focused on outreach to broader audiences. 'Making Waves' is a podcast hosted by society members that comes out semi- monthly and discusses freshwater science for a general audience. Society members also maintain media libraries through Flickr for general use. SFS holds a leaf pack workshop at the annual meetings for local environmental groups and educators. Finally, a group of SFS members recently developed the Ecological Evidence Exchange to create a publicly available database of scientific information to inform environmental management.

It was again discussed in March 2014, but the majority did not approve the measure. Marriage As a reaction to the 2015 Supreme Court of Justice of the Nation's ruling on same-sex marriage (in which it ruled same-sex marriage bans unconstitutional), a member of PRD announced on 18 June 2015 that she would submit a bill to reform the state's Civil and Family codes to give same- sex couples the same rights as heterosexual married couples.

It was released on September 3, 2019.  History  Google released the first beta of Android 10 under the preliminary name \\"Android Q\\" on March 13, 2019, exclusively on their Pixel phones, including the first-generation Pixel and Pixel XL devices where support was extended due to popular demand. Having been guaranteed updates only up to October 2018, the first-generation Pixel and Pixel XL devices received version updates to Android 10. The Pixel 2 and Pixel 2 XL were included, after being granted an extended warranty period which guaranteed Android version updates for them for at least 3 years from when they were first available on the Google Store. A total of six beta or release-candidate versions were released before the final release. The beta program was expanded with the release of Beta 3 on May 7, 2019, being made available on 14 partner devices from 11 OEMs; twice as many devices compared to Android Pie's beta. Beta access was removed from the Huawei Mate 20 Pro on May 21, 2019 due to U.S. government sanctions, but was later restored on May 31. Google released Beta 4 on June 5, 2019 with the finalized Android Q APIs and SDK (API Level 29). Dynamic System Updates (DSU) were also included in Beta 4. The Dynamic System Update allows Android Q devices to temporarily install a Generic System Image (GSI) to try a newer version of Android on top of their current Android version. Once users decide to end testing the chosen GSI image, they can simply reboot their device and boot back into their normal device's Android version. Google released Beta 5 on July 10, 2019 with the final API 29 SDK as well as the latest optimizations and bug fixes. Google released Beta 6, the final release candidate for testing, on August 7, 2019. On August 22, 2019, it was announced that Android Q would be branded solely as \\"Android 10\\", with no codename. Google ended the practice of giving major releases titles based on desserts, arguing that this was not inclusive to international users (due either to the aforementioned foods not being internationally known, or being difficult to pronounce in some languages). Android VP of engineering Dave Burke did reveal during a podcast that, in addition, most desserts beginning with the letter Q were exotic, and that he personally would have chosen queen cake. He also noted that there were references to \\"qt\\"—an abbreviation of quince tart—within internal files and build systems relating to the release. The statue for the release is likewise the numeral 10, with the Android robot logo (which, as part of an accompanying rebranding, has also been changed to only consist of a head) resting inside the numeral \\"0\\". Android Q emblem Android 10 was officially released on September 3, 2019 for supported Google Pixel devices, as well as the third- party Essential Phone and Redmi K20 Pro in selected markets. The OnePlus 7T was the first device with Android 10 pre-installed. In October 2019, it was reported that Google's certification requirements for Google Mobile Services will only allow Android 10-based builds to be approved after January 31, 2020. , 33.34% of Android devices run Android 10 (API 29), making it the most-used version of Android.  Features   Navigation  Android 10 introduces a revamped full-screen gesture system, with gestures such as swiping from either side edge of the display to go back, swiping up to go to the home screen, swiping up and holding to access Overview, swiping diagonally from a bottom corner of the screen to activate the Google Assistant, and swiping along the gesture bar at the bottom of the screen to switch apps. The use of an edge swiping gesture as a \\"Back\\" command was noted as potentially causing conflicts with apps that utilize sidebar menus and other functions accessible by swiping. An API can be used by apps to opt out of handling a back gesture within specific areas of the screen, a sensitivity control was added for adjusting the size of the target area to activate the gesture, and Google later stated that the drawer widget would support being \\"peeked\\" by long- pressing near the edge of the screen, and then swiped open. The traditional three-key navigation system used since Android \\"Honeycomb\\" remains supported as an option, along with the two-button \\"pill\\" style navigation introduced in Android 9.0 Pie. Per Google certification requirements, OEMs are required to support Android 10's default gestures and three-key navigation. OEMs are free to add their own gestures alongside them. However, they must not be enabled by default, they must be listed in a separate area one level deeper than other navigation settings, and they cannot be promoted using notifications. The two- key gesture navigation system used on Android Pie is deprecated, and may not be included on devices that ship with Android 10. However, it can still be included as an option for continuity purposes on devices upgraded from Pie.  User experience  Android 10 includes a system-level dark mode. Third- party apps can automatically engage a dark mode when it is active. Apps can also present \\"settings panels\\" for specific settings (such as, for example, internet connection and Wi-Fi settings if an app requires internet) via overlay panels, so that the user does not have to be taken outside of the app in order to configure them.  Privacy and security  Several major security and privacy changes are present in Android 10: apps can be restricted by users to only having access to location data when they are actively being used in the foreground. There are also new restrictions on the launching of activities by background apps. For security (due to its use by clickjacking malware) and performance reasons, Android 10 Go Edition forbids use of overlays, except for apps that received the permission before a device was upgraded to Android 10. In February 2019, Google unveiled Adiantum, an encryption cipher designed primarily for use on devices that do not have hardware-accelerated support for the Advanced Encryption Standard (AES), such as low-end devices. Google stated that this cipher was five times faster than AES-256-XTS on an ARM Cortex-A7 CPU. Therefore, device encryption is now mandatory on all Android 10 devices, regardless of specifications, using Adiantum if their CPU is not capable of hardware-accelerated AES. In addition, implementation of \\"file-based encryption\\" (first introduced in Android Nougat) is also mandatory for all devices. On devices shipping with Android 10, security patches for selected system components (such as ANGLE, Conscrypt, media frameworks, networking components, and others) may be serviced via Google Play Store, without requiring a complete system update (\\"Project Mainline\\"). In order to license Google mobile services, manufacturers must support these updates for specific modules, while the remainder are marked as \\"recommended\\" but optional. Selected modules within this system use the new APEX package format, a variation of APK files designed for housing and servicing low-level system components. A major change to storage access permissions known as \\"Scoped storage\\" is supported on Android 10, and will become mandatory for all apps beginning with Android 11. Apps are only allowed to access files in external storage that they had created themselves (preferably contained within an app-specific directory), and audio, image, and video files contained within the Music, Pictures, or Videos directories. Any other file may only be accessed via user intervention through the Storage Access Framework. Apps must have a new \\"read privileged phone state\\" permission in order to read non-resettable device identifiers, such as IMEI number. TLS 1.3 support is also enabled by default.  Platform  Platform optimizations have been made for foldable smartphones, including app continuity when changing modes, changes to multi-window mode to allow all apps to run simultaneously (rather than only the actively-used app running, and all others being considered \\"paused\\"), and additional support for multiple displays. \\"Direct Share\\" has been succeeded by \\"sharing shortcuts\\". As before, it allows apps to return lists of direct targets for sharing (such as a combination of an app and a specific contact) for use within share menus. Unlike Direct Share, apps publish their targets in advance and do not have to be polled at runtime, improving performance. Native support has been added for MIDI controllers, the AV1 video codec, the Opus audio codec, and HDR10+. There is also a new standard API for retrieving depth information from camera photos, which can be used for more advanced effects. Native support for aptX Adaptive, LHDC, LLAC, CELT and AAC LATM codecs was added as well. Android 10 supports WPA3 encryption protocol and Enhanced Open, which introduce opportunistic encryption for Wi-Fi. Android 10 adds support for Dual-SIM dual- standby (DSDS), but is initially only available on the Pixel 3a and Pixel 3a XL. Android 10 Go Edition has performance improvements, with Google stating that apps would launch 10% quicker than on Pie.

Texas Gulf Sulphur Co.SEC v. Texas Gulf Sulphur Co., 401 F.2d 833 (1968) (en banc). is a case from the United States Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit which articulated standards for a number of aspects of insider trading law under Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act and SEC Rule 10b-5. In particular, it set out standards for materiality of inside information, effective disclosure of such information, and what constitutes a \\"misleading\\" statement. Texas Gulf Sulphur represented the first time a federal court held that insider trading violated federal securities law and remained the leading case on insider trading for a decade. Over time, the U.S. Supreme Court embraced some of its holdings while rejecting others. The case continues to receive significant scholarly attention.  Facts and Procedural History  The dispute centered on the actions of a dozen employees of the Texas Gulf Sulphur Co. (TGS) following the discovery of major mineral deposits in Canada.Texas Gulf Sulphur, 401 F.2d at 843. After TGS conducted exploratory drilling and found evidence of significant deposits, it decided to acquire surrounding land. TGS’ president instructed the exploration group not to share the information with others. During this time, several TGS employees and outsiders who had received tips from them purchased TGS stock.Texas Gulf Sulphur, 401 F.2d at 844. In addition, a group of employees accepted stock options from TGS without informing the Board of the finds. After newspapers reported TGS had uncovered significant mineral deposits, the company released a statement disclaiming the reports.Texas Gulf Sulphur, 401 F.2d at 844-45. Several days later, at 10:00 a.m., TGS read a statement to the press confirming a major find, and the news was reported on the Dow Jones ticker tape at 10:54 a.m.Texas Gulf Sulphur, 401 F.2d at 846-47. Several TGS employees had bought company stock before the announcement, and one placed an order after the announcement but before the Dow Jones report.Texas Gulf Sulphur, 401 F.2d at 847. The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) brought claims against twelve TGS employees as well as the company itself for violating section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act and SEC Rule 10b-5.Texas Gulf Sulphur, 401 F.2d at 839-42. The suit alleged the employees had, variously: bought TGS stock on the basis of material nonpublic information; divulged nonpublic information to outsiders; or accepted stock options without disclosing material information to the Board. The SEC also sued the company itself on the grounds that its first statement was deceptive. A federal district court concluded that information about the exploration only became material several days before the company's first statement, and therefore only inside activity after that point and before the company fully disclosed its findings were unlawful.Texas Gulf Sulphur, 401 F.2d at 842. In addition, the court held that the press release was not unlawful.  Opinion of the Court  Judge Waterman wrote the majority opinion, which included holdings on a number of legal issues related to insider trading and false or misleading statements.  Insider Trading   \\"Disclose or Abstain\\"  The court endorsed a “disclose or abstain” rule for insider trading which required anyone with material inside information about a company to either disclose it to the public or abstain from trading in the company's stock.Texas Gulf Sulphur, 401 F.2d at 848. Notably, this obligation under Rule 10b-5 applied to anyone possessing such information, including people that “may not be strictly termed an ‘insider.’”  Materiality  The court then addressed what qualifies as “material” inside information, the threshold for the duty to disclose or abstain.Texas Gulf Sulphur, 401 F.2d at 848-49. It held that only information about situations which, if disclosed, would have a substantial effect on stock price was material. Further, whether information about an event is material depends on the probability the event will occur balanced with the magnitude of the event.Texas Gulf Sulphur, 401 F.2d at 849. In the case of TGS, information about the initial finds was material despite being “remote,” since knowing such a vast mine might have been found could have affected TGS's stock price.Texas Gulf Sulphur, 401 F.2d at 849-50. Therefore, the court concluded that all trading by people who knew about the initial finds violated Rule 10b-5, setting the point at which the information became material earlier than the district court.Texas Gulf Sulphur, 401 F.2d at 852.  Tipper and Tippee Liability  On the issue of tipper-tippee liability, the court held that by sharing material information with corporate outsiders who then bought TGS stock, an employee violated Rule 10b-5. While not deciding whether those outsiders (the “tippees”) would equally have violated the rule if they had known the information was not disclosed, the court remarked that their conduct \\"certainly could be equally reprehensible.”Texas Gulf Sulphur, 401 F.2d at 852-53.  Effective Disclosure  The court stated that, before insiders can trade on material information, the information had to have been effectively disclosed in a way that insured it was available to investors.Texas Gulf Sulphur, 401 F.2d at 853-54. Even though word of an article reporting a significant find by TGS had reached New York before the company read its statement to the press, these early reports were deemed insufficient. In addition, the court held that reading a news release is only the first step in disseminating information.Texas Gulf Sulphur, 401 F.2d at 854. Therefore, a TGS employee who traded after the statement was read but before Dow Jones reported the news should have waited until it appeared on “the media of widest circulation,” the Dow Jones ticker.  Good Faith Defense  Employees who traded before Dow Jones reported the news but claimed they honestly believed the news had become public raised a “good faith” defense. The court rejected this argument, holding that specific intent to defraud is not necessary to establish 10b-5 liability; a defendant's negligence suffices. In this case, because the TGS employees’ beliefs that the news was public were not reasonable, they had acted negligently and were liable.Texas Gulf Sulphur, 401 F.2d at 856.  Accepting Stock Options  As to receiving stock options from TGS, the court held that members of top management had a duty to disclose any material information before doing so. Therefore, an employee who failed to do so violated Rule 10b-5.Texas Gulf Sulphur, 401 F.2d at 856-56.  Misleading Statements   “In connection with”  TGS argued that its first public statement was not unlawful because it was not issued “in connection with the purchase or sale of any security,” as required by Rule 10b-5. Specifically, the statement had not produced any unusual market activity, nor had TGS made the statement intending to affect the company's stock price for internal benefit.Texas Gulf Sulphur, 401 F.2d at 857-58. The court rejected these arguments and held that the \\"in connection with\\" prong only requires a false or misleading statement be made “in a manner reasonably calculated to influence [investors].”Texas Gulf Sulphur, 401 F.2d at 862. TGS's statement met this standard.Texas Gulf Sulphur, 401 F.2d at 864. However, the court endorsed a good faith defense, which it had rejected for insider trading. Specifically, if corporate management could show it disseminated information in good faith after diligently determining it was “the whole truth,” there would be no 10b-5 violation.  \\"Misleading\\"  The court held that the test for determining if a statement was misleading under 10b-5 is whether a reasonable investor would have been misled.Texas Gulf Sulphur, 401 F.2d at 863. Because the district court had applied the wrong standard (whether the drafters had exercised reasonable business judgment), the court remanded without deciding if the first statement was misleading.  Concurring Opinion by Judge Friendly  Judge Friendly wrote a separate concurring opinion expressing his concern about the possibility of private suits for large money damages based only on negligently prepared press releases. In his view, a merely negligent violation of Rule 10b-5 (such as TGS's release of its first statement) would not necessarily establish a private claim for damages.  Concurring Opinions by Judges Kaufman, Anderson, and Hays  Judge Kaufman wrote a concurring opinion, joining the majority as well as Judge Friendly's call to provide more guidance on private damages claims.Texas Gulf Sulphur, 401 F.2d at 869 (Kaufman, J., concurring). Judge Anderson concurred in the majority opinion and elements of Judge Friendly's discussion of private claims.Texas Gulf Sulphur, 401 F.2d at 869 (Anderson, J., concurring). Judge Hays filed an opinion concurring with most of the majority opinion, but dissenting as to the proper remedies for certain violations.Texas Gulf Sulphur, 401 F.2d at 869-70 (Hays, J., concurring in part and dissenting in part).  Dissenting Opinion by Judge Moore  Judge Moore, joined by Chief Judge Lumbard, dissented from the majority opinion and drew fault with almost every element of it. Judge Moore objected to the majority's standard for materiality, arguing that relying on the potential impact that information might have on stock price would sweep in almost any fact related to a company.Texas Gulf Sulphur, 401 F.2d at 875 (Moore, J., dissenting). On the question of stock options, the dissent would have held that it is acceptable for top managers who have undisclosed information to accept options, as long as the managers did not exercise them before the information became public.Texas Gulf Sulphur, 401 F.2d at 877-78 (Moore, J., dissenting). Judge Moore further objected to the majority's “reasonable investor” standard for judging misleading statements and would have instead deferred to management's business judgment.Texas Gulf Sulphur, 401 F.2d at 878 (Moore, J., dissenting). As to the proper meaning of “in connection with,” the dissent called for a requirement that the defendant either have acted with a fraudulent purpose or have made trades. In Judge Moore's view, the majority's standard would bring all public corporate statements within the scope of 10b-5.Texas Gulf Sulphur, 401 F.2d at 886 (Moore, J., dissenting). Most fundamentally, he objected to the “unrealistic approach” the majority took to corporate press releases, which he believed set an overly exacting standard and subjected corporations to judicial second guessing.Texas Gulf Sulphur, 401 F.2d at 888-89 (Moore, J., dissenting).  Philosophy Behind the Opinion  The majority drew heavily on what it viewed as the core policy behind Rule 10b-5, that “all investors trading on impersonal exchanges [should] have relatively equal access to material information.”Texas Gulf Sulphur, 401 F.2d at 848, 851-52. The court stated that the inequities of an unlevel playing field should not be \\"shrugged off as inevitable in our way of life” nor remain uncorrected. As a matter of judicial interpretation, Texas Gulf Sulphur construed federal securities laws to realize Congress's “broad remedial design,” and interpreted section 10(b) as a “catchall.”Texas Gulf Sulphur, 401 F.2d at 855, 859. Justice Rehnquist later criticized this approach in Blue Chip Stamps v. Manor Drug Stores, where he famously criticized securities law developments as “a judicial oak which has grown from little more than a legislative acorn.”Blue Chip Stamps v. Manor Drug Stores, 421 U.S. 723, 737 (1975).  Relevance   Importance at the Time  The Texas Gulf Sulphur decision represented the first time a federal court held that insider trading violated federal securities laws. The SEC in Cady, Roberts & Co. (1961) had extensively treated insider trading and set out the \\"disclose or abstain rule,\\" but as an agency opinion, it did not have precedential value in federal courts.In the Matter of Cady, Roberts & Co., 40 S.E.C. 907 (1961). After the Second Circuit issued its opinion, the Supreme Court declined review.Coates v. SEC, 394 U.S. 976 (1969).Kline v. SEC, 394 U.S. 976 (1969). Absent controlling Supreme Court rulings on the issues, Texas Gulf Sulphur became the \\"pre-eminent insider trading rule\\" for the next decade.  Later Treatment of Texas Gulf Sulphur by Courts  Over the years, the Supreme Court addressed many of the Second Circuit's holdings, rejecting some and adopting others. In Chiarella v. United States (1980), the Court rejected the rule that anyone with material inside information must disclose or abstain from trading.Chiarella v. U.S., 445 U.S. 222, 227-28 (1980). Instead, the Court held that a fiduciary or similar relationship between the parties to a transaction was needed for this duty to apply. While Texas Gulf Sulphur held that material information included facts which “in reasonable and objective contemplation might” affect a company's stock price,Texas Gulf Sulphur, 401 F.2d at 849 (emphasis added). the Supreme Court in TSC Industries, Inc. v. Northway, Inc. (1976) set the standard at whether \\"a reasonable shareholder would consider it important.\\"TSC Industries, Inc. v. Northway, Inc., 426 U.S. 438, 448-49 (1976) (emphasis added). Rejecting Texas Gulf Sulphur's negligence standard for 10b-5 violations, the Court required \\"scienter\\" be shown.Ernst & Ernst v. Hochfelder, 425 U.S. 185, 193 (1976) (private claims).Aaron v. SEC, 446 U.S. 680, 691 (1980) (government actions). On the other hand, the Supreme Court followed Texas Gulf Sulphur in broadly construing the \\"in construction with\\" element. In addition, the Court endorsed Texas Gulf Sulphur's “probability-magnitude test” as a factor for determining materiality in Basic, Inc. v. Levinson (1988).Basic Inc. v. Levinson, 485 U.S. 224, 238-39 & n.16 (1988).  Continued Relevance  Texas Gulf Sulphur has been called \\"perhaps the most important federal case under the U.S. securities law.\\" Certain of its holdings remain good law today. In addition, the \\"price impact\\" test the court used to determine materiality has been adopted in jurisdictions outside the U.S.  Further reading   Selected Scholarship  *Texas Gulf Sulphur 50th Anniversary Symposium Issue, 71 SMU Law Review 625-1014 (2018). *Victor Brudney, Insiders, Outsiders, and Informational Advantages Under the Federal Securities Law, 93 Harvard Law Review 322-76 (1979). *Karla Harbin Fox, SEC Rule 10b-5: Tippee Liability Revisited, 22 American Business Law Journal 385-406 (1984). *A.C.

It runs from Vesterbrogade in the northwest to Halmtorvet in the southeast and is intersected by Istedgade. Located close to Copenhagen Central Station, the street is dominated by hotels. History Gartner Hintze's house Helgolandsgade was not established until circa 1880, making it one of the youngest streets in the Inner Vesterbro area. The site was prior to that part of Gartner Hintze's market gardens. The main building faced Vesterbrogade and the area down towards the railway (now Halmtorvet) was planted with fruit trees and fruit bushes. The street was named after the island of Helgoland to commemorate the Battle of Helgoland in 1864. Notable buildings No. 4: Lanterns on the facade of Hotel Hebron Many of the buildings in the street are hotels. Hotel Hebron (No. 4) was opened by the Inner Mission in 1898 and is still owned by the association. The building was designed by Christian Mandrup-Poulsen. The 200-room First Hotel Mayfair (No. 3) is operated by First Hotels. The chain's Hotel Excelsior in Colbjørnsensgade on the other side of the block was merged with the hotel in 2016. Hotel Axel Guldsmeden (No. 11) is Guldsmeden Hotels' flagship hotel in Copenhagen. The Andersen Boutique Hotel and Hotel Absalon, located on each their corner with Istedgade, are both operated by the Andersen Fonden. Borgerdydskolen's former building (No. 6) was designed by Frederik Levy (1851-1924). The school was founded in Nørregade in 1787 and a branch was later opened in Christianshavn. It was later disjoined from the parent institution and moved to Helgolandsgade in 1893. Værnehjemmet Bethania (No. 8) was built as a home for unmarried women at the initiative of Regitze Barner. The National Romantic building was designed by Emil Jørgensen. No. 2 is from 1875 and was designed by Georg Wittrock and Johan Schrøder.

She was the author of Histoire de la IVe République (\\"History of the Fourth Republic\\"), published in 6 volumes from 1965 to 2012.  Biography  In her autobiography Toutes fenêtres ouvertes (\\"All Windows Open\\", 2017), Georgette Elgey wrote extensively about what she called \\"one of the last major upper-class scandals of the French Third Republic\\": her birth out of wedlock. Her father Georges Lacour-Gayet was an eminent historian, member of the Academy of Moral and Political Sciences, who was, at the time of her birth, 72 years old and a widower. Her mother Madeleine Léon, then in her mid-twenties, belonged to the Jewish upper-class – she was the great- granddaughter of Michel Lévy, France's first Jewish general. After Lacour- Gayet refused to marry her, Léon fought for years for Georgette to be officially recognised as his daughter, eventually losing in court but leaving the old man's reputation in shatters. From her father's marriage, she had three half-siblings Jacques, Thérèse and Robert Lacour-Gayet, who were considerably older than she. Robert also later became a historian. Madeleine Léon was a convert to Roman Catholicism and Elgey was baptised as a child; yet, because of their Jewish roots, mother and daughter had to flee Paris and live in hiding during the occupation of France by Nazi Germany. After the war, Elgey studied stenography and worked as a secretary at a school of journalism. She started attending the school's classes and, although she never graduated, she caught the attention of the school's director Jacques Kayser, who introduced her to the historian Robert Aron. Through Aron, Elgey landed her first journalist assignments at La NEF, a magazine he directed alongside Lucie Faure. It was then she chose the nom-de-plume Georgette Elgey, from the French pronunciation of her father's initials, L.G. Elgey also made her first steps as a historian thanks to Aron, whom she assisted in the writing of his Histoire de Vichy (\\"History of Vichy\\"), published in 1954. She worked as a journalist at L'Express and Paris-Presse and was editor-in-chief at Le Nouveau Candide, a magazine she helped launch in 1961. She however quit journalism in 1962 because, in her own words, she could not be \\"true to herself\\" in a line of work that required \\"too many compromises\\". On the advice of Roger Stéphane, she then started working on what was to become her magnum opus, a history of the French Fourth Republic adequately titled Histoire de la IVe République. Published in the 1960s, the first two volumes were well received, with praise directed at Elgey's innovative use of oral testimonies in her historical research. Histoire de la IVe République took almost 50 years to complete, with the sixth and final volume published in 2012. In the 1970s, Elgey also worked as a senior editor for her publisher, Fayard, and after François Mitterrand was elected President of France in 1981, she joined his team as a technical adviser, in charge of the presidency's archives. From 2007 to 2016, she headed France's Conseil supérieur des archives (\\"Higher Archives Council\\"). She was made Commander of the Legion of Honour in 2009.

This council was established in 1963 with the main objective of creating a census to achieve social and economic goals via long-term and medium-term planning. As a Crown corporation, the council reports went directly through the prime minister to the Parliament. Doctor Silvia Ostry and Judith Maxwell were the two women who were separately appointed to serve for seven years each as chair of the council. Maxwell’s role of chair as the Chief Executive Officer meant she had to supervise and direct the work and staff of the council. At the time of her appointment, government officials suggested to her that they felt the council did not have a significant impact on policy debates. Her task was to implement the solutions required for the growth of the council. Her ways to solve these issued were subtle and distinctive. She focused on the consistency between the council’s economic policy goals and those of mainstream economics, along with the logical concerns for social policy implications. Under her leadership, the council achieved new levels of success by expanding its research plan to simultaneously address a wide range of topics that interest citizens for their advantage in the political science and sociology disciplines. Here she was also responsible for making the council’s reports more legible and topic oriented. Canadian Policy Research Networks From 1994 to 2005, she became the President of the Canadian Policy Research Networks.

In the 19th century, it was known as Foki during the period of Qing rule. Under Japanese rule, it was known as Fūki Kaku from the Japanese pronunciation of the same characters.

The still unapproved draft of the 4th edition of the Limits of Oceans and Seas amends the name to its pinyin form Fugui but moves the boundary of the South China Sea from Fugui to Taiwan's southern cape Eluan. Cape Fugui is also considered part of the northern border of the Taiwan Strait.. History The Japanese administration erected a building on the cape in 1896 as the endpoint of an undersea cable.. It was destroyed during the Second World War. The present lighthouse was erected by the Taiwanese government in 1949 to help guide shipping and received its present black-and- white octagonal tower in 1962. It was opened to the public in 2015, but entry is only permitted on the weekends as it remains an active radar station of the Taiwanese Air Force. Park Cape Fugui or Fuguijiao Park surrounds the headland.. It includes a rocky beach with ventifacts (wind-shaped rocks) and lush tropical vegetation. There is a walking trail around the cape from Fuji Harbor (t, Fùjī Yúgǎng) to Laomei Village and the brick Laomei Maze. Old barracks from the Taiwanese armed forces have been converted into an arts center. In September and October, the park forms part of Shimen District's kite festival.

The al-Hawl refugee camp (also al-Hol refugee camp) is a refugee camp on the southern outskirts of the town of al-Hawl in northern Syria, close to the Syria-Iraq border, which holds individuals displaced from Islamic State group-occupied territory. It is controlled by the US-backed Syrian Democratic Forces (SDF). As of April 2019, the camp's population was 74,000 having grown from 10,000 at the beginning of the year. The refugees are women and children of many countries primarily from Syria and Iraq. History The camp was originally established for Iraqi refugees in early 1991, during the Gulf war, and was later reopened after the 2003 invasion of Iraq as one of three camps at the Iraqi–Syrian border. Demographics While at the beginning of 2019 the camp held about 10,000 people its size increased dramatically with the collapse of ISIS. By April 2019, the camp's population was estimated at 74,000. An estimate in September 2019 indicated that the camp held about 20,000 women and 50,000 children from the former Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant (ISIL) guarded by 400 SDF militia fighters. Administration and conditions in the camp In the context of the Syrian Civil War and the takeover of al-Hawl by the SDF, the camp, alongside the Ayn Issa refugee camp has become a center for refugees from the fighting between the SDF and ISIL during the SDF campaign in Deir ez-Zor and the camp held approximately 10,000 refugees in early December 2018. In April 2018, a typhoid outbreak killed 24 people in the camp. During the Battle of Baghuz Fawqani in December 2018, the camp saw a massive influx of refugees in a series of massive civilian evacuations, with people fleeing the fierce fighting between the SDF and ISIL. Conditions along the road to the camp, including in screening centers for ISIL operatives, have been described as \\"extremely harsh\\" with limited food, water, shelter and no health services. As of 4 February 2019, at least 35 children and newborns had also reportedly died either en route or shortly after arriving in the camp, mostly due to hypothermia. Aid organizations feared dysentery and other diseases could break out from the overflowing camp. The UN stated that 84 people, mostly children, died on the way to al-Hawl since December 2018. Families of Daesh fighters are kept at a separate guarded section of the camp after repeated violent incidents between them and other members of the camp. In February 2019, Zehra Duman, an Australian who married an Australian jihadi fighter shortly after her arrival, told her mother she and her two young children were living in the camp. She told her mother that there was a terrible shortage of food, and she feared her six-month-old daughter would starve to death. In early 2019, pregnant British citizen and former ISIL member Shamima Begum was found in the al-Hawl camp. Her newborn son died within weeks of birth. In March 2019, the former American citizen and former ISIL member Hoda Muthana and her 18-month- old son were also reported to be living in the camp. At least 100 people have died during the trip, or shortly after arriving at the camp since December 2018. In April 2019, women and girls at the camp told a female journalist, \\"Convert, convert!\\" urging her to recite the shahada. They told her, \\"If you became Muslim and cover (your body and face) like us and became a member of our religion, you would not be killed\\". Many of them prayed for the caliphate of ISIL to return. The women justified the genocide of Yazidis by ISIL and ISIL's taking of Yazidi sex slaves. An Iraqi woman said, \\"If they don't convert to Islam and they don't become Muslim like us and worship Allah, then they deserve it.\\" In a report published in April 2019, BBC journalist Quentin Sommerville described the camp as \\"an overflowing vessel of anger and unanswered questions,\\" where some women \\"cling to their hate-fuelled ideology, others beg for a way out - a way home.\\" Quentin quoted a Moroccan-Belgian woman, a former nurse who grabbed her niqab saying: \\"This is my choice. In Belgium I couldn't wear my niqab - this is my choice. Every religion did something wrong, show us the good.\\" The woman saw there was no need to apologise for the IS attack in Brussels in 2016 and blamed the West and its air-strikes on Baghouz for their dire conditions. A report in the Washington Post from September 2019 describes the increased radicalization within the camp where conditions are dismal, security lax, and people who do not follow ISIS ideology live in fear. Speaking at the Council on Foreign Relations (CFR) the US Deputy Defense Secretary Michael Mulroy stated that many of the children in the camp are learning the ways and beliefs of ISIL and that he believes that they have only one view and one philosophy at the camp. He also claimed that if the international community doesn't come up with a way to rehabilitate them and reintegrate them into society, that he believes it would be the next generation of ISIL. \\"We need to pick one. We need to fund it. And we need to do something,\\" he said. \\"If we don't do it as an international community, not just the United States, it's a problem that our kids will be dealing with.\\" https://www.c-span.org/video/?464882-1/syria-discussion- council-foreign-relationshttps://www.mei.edu/publications/jannah-or-jahannam- options-dealing-isis-detainees On 28 November 2019, the Syrian Arab Red Crescent announced that over 36,000 of the camp's inhabitants had received aid from the organization at clinics established in the camp and via a mobile medical team there. In October 2020, in ana attempt to address the situation of the overpopulation of the camp, it was announced that the authorities of the Autonomous Administration of North and East Syria (AANES) decided to release all the Syrian nationals from the camp, which account for about half of the population of the camp. There would still remain over 25'000 Iraqi and 10'000 people from other nationalities in the refugee camp. Repatriation Repatriation is difficult as many camp residents have become radicalized and pose a potential threat to their home country. Sommerville indicated that \\"western governments prevaricate\\" or may not have plans to take people back.

During his career, he completed over 500 portraits of notable people in New York and Michigan; as well as many people who can no longer be identified. He also painted for brief periods in Canada and Jamaica. There is no record of any formal artistic training he may have had. Biography He was one of four sons born to Samuel Morton Bradish (1777-1812), a surveyor from Worcester, Massachusetts, and his wife Mary Finch (1778-1843).Historical Collections Vol.21 @ Google Books. After his father's death, his family moved to Fredonia, where he grew up. From 1837 to 1846, he was an itinerant portrait painter, based in Rochester, New York. He was married in 1839, to Lydia Douglass-Houghton; daughter of Judge Jacob Houghton (1777-1861), originally of Boston,McClurg mansion and Museum and Lydia Douglass (1780-1871). Her brother, Douglass Houghton, would become the first State Geologist of Michigan. They had 3 children. After 1846, he returned to Fredonia, but also traveled extensively. The year 1849 found him in Kingston, Jamaica, where he sent some specimens of fish to the University of Michigan.The Michigan Alumnus #41 @ Google Books This was prompted by the fact that his younger brother, Josiah (1810-1892), who had become a surveyor like his father, had gone to Michigan in 1836, at the invitation of Houghton, and settled there permanently a few years later. In 1850, Alvah was induced to follow him and settled near Detroit. Two years later, he was engaged to lecture on the fine arts at the University, and presented with an honorary Master of Arts degree,University History; Faculty. along with the title of Professor. For six years, however, he received no compensation and was not allowed to teach; merely accumulating relevant materials. He finally obtained permission to teach a few courses and, in 1861, the senior class requested that he be permitted to lecture them. In 1863, the courses he had been teaching were summarily discontinued. He then quit his position and returned to Detroit, where he lived for the remainder of his life. His notable sitters during his University period included Lewis Cass, Gov. Austin Blair, Mayor Zina Pitcher, Joseph Campau (a merchant), and University President Henry Philip Tappan. He continued to paint well into the 1880s. His body was returned to Fredonia for burial. References Writings by Bradish * Memoir of Douglass Houghton, first state geologist of Michigan.

Foreign policy Yemen conflict In April 2019, Trump vetoed a bipartisan bill which would have ended US support for the Saudi-led military intervention. With 53 votes instead of the 67 needed, the United States Senate failed to override the veto. The legal arguments and policies of the Obama administration were cited as justification for the veto. The US Deputy Assistant Secretary of Defense Michael Mulroy stated that US support was limited to side-by-side coaching to mitigate civilian casualties and if the measure had passed it would do nothing to help the people of Yemen and may only increase civilian deaths. Mulroy supported the United Nation's peace talks and he pushed the international community to come together and chart a comprehensive way ahead for Yemen.

It protects a relatively undeveloped portion of the Ukrainian forest-steppe landscape, about 75 km east of the Carpathian Mountains in western Ukraine, and about 400 km southwest of Kyiv. The canyon is known for its varied geological formations, including two of the longest caves in the world. It is in the administrative districts of Borshchiv Raion, Zalishchyky Raion, Buchach Raion, and Monastyryska Raion in Ternopil Oblast. Topography The park's boundaries follow the Dniester River for 100 km as it flows from northwest to southeast in western Ukraine. For much of this length the park is only about 5 – 10 km wide, centered on the river. There are over 50 significant caves in park, cut in the Travertine rock. These include the Ozerna (105 km) and Optymistychna (230 km) caves. The largest waterfall in Ukraine - Dzhurynskyi - is in the park. As with most National Nature Parks in Ukraine, the main park includes many smaller nature reserves, local park sites, historical monuments and natural attractions open to public visits. Climate and ecoregion The official climate designation for the Dniester Canyon area is 'Humid continental climate - warm summer sub-type' (Köppen climate classification Dfb), with large seasonal temperature differentials and a warm summer (at least four months averaging over , but no month averaging over . The park is in the southern edge of the Central European mixed forests ecoregion. Public use The park is sectioned into four zones: a reserved zone, a regulated recreation zone, a stationary recreation zone and a business zone. There are a number of tourist trails and much of the territory is near developed areas for services.
