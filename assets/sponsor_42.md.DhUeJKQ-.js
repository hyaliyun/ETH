It is now a part of the Hanover S-Bahn network. History  Hamelin station The railway line was built by the Hanover-Altenbeken Railway Company (, HAE). The first section opened to Hamelin on 13 April 1872 and the whole Hanover‚ÄìAltenbeken line was completed on 19 December 1872. After the financial decline of the HAE, it was nationalised in 1880 and operated as part of the Prussian state railways. The originally single-track line was duplicated between Hamelin and Altenbeken in 1908 and between Hannover and Hamelin in 1913. As a result of the division of Germany after 1945 it lost freight traffic, which had been important for decades, because traffic shifted to the north-south direction. Electrical operations commenced on the line in the summer of 1971. The original starting point was Hannover Localbahnhof (local station), later called S√ºdbahnhof (south station), north of Bismarckstra√üe that had a connection to the railway yards at Pferdeturm, now used for sidings, which gave a further connection to the line to Lehrte and Brunswick. From 1880 trains operated from the newly built Hannover Hauptbahnhof. In southern Hanover the line ran along the street today called Altenbekener Damm to Linden/Fischerhof station. The current route, which continues further south, was opened on 26 June 1909 as part of the Hanover freight train bypass. The former railway bridges over the Leine and the Ihme are still preserved as pedestrian bridges. The branch line was opened in 1873 from Linden to Linden-K√ºchengarten, which was used mainly for coal from the Deister. The line was closed in 1930. The original Holtensen b. Weetzen station was renamed at the beginning of the 21st century as Holtensen/Linderte. Former Kaiserrampe station near Springe It was originally proposed that the line between Springe and Bennigsen would run further south to directly serve Eldagsen, which was larger at that time than Springe. Since this route was not selected, Eldagsen station was built just outside V√∂lksen, largely financed by Eldagsen. The station and Eldagsen were connected by buses, initially horse-hauled. In 1935 the station was renamed Eldagsen- V√∂lksen. In about 2000, the station was renamed as V√∂lksen-Eldagsen. Kaiserrampe (Emperor platform) station was opened between V√∂lksen/Eldagsen and Springe (west of the present bridge over the B 217) in 1887. From there, the Emperor rode over the 2.5 km long and chestnut-lined Kaiserallee (Emperor's Alley) to a hunting lodge in Saupark Springe, a game reserve. The station was last used by the German Emperor in 1912. The Kaiserallee and the old station buildings still exist today. It is planned to build stations in Hanover on the line at Waldhausen and Braunschweiger Platz to improve interchange with the Hanover Stadtbahn, but no definite dates have been set. Operations  Class 425 electric multiple unit Since 2000 the line has been part of the Hanover S-Bahn and since December 2004 it has been served by S-Bahn line S 5 on the Hanover Airport‚ÄìHannover Hbf‚ÄìHamelin‚ÄìAltenbeken‚ÄìPaderborn route. The trains run every hour, but on Sundays only every two hours between Bad Pyrmont and Paderborn. The frequency of services is improved by additional services at the Hanover end of the line: S 1 and S 2 operate on the line to Weetzen and additional S5 services operate between Hanover and Hamelin. They are operated by DB Regio Niedersachsen, using electric multiple units of DB classes 424 and 425 at speeds of up to 140 km/h. The average speed is 69 km/h.

Background The Aragon front was, from the beginning of the war, a secondary front, but also a primary objective for the Republicans. The Nationalists maintained a weak position, defending a large line which stretched from the Pyrenees to the city of Teruel, and from there down to the Montes Universales and the birth of the Tagus. Thus, it was a tempting target to the numerically superior Republican troops, especially Huesca and Teruel, which were besieged. In order to support the Republican offensive at Brunete and to force the Nationalists to maintain their troops in this front, the Republicans in Aragon planned to launch a small offensive at Albarrac√≠n. Developments of the operations Republican offensive In rapid deployment on the heights that surround Albarrac√≠n, forces of the 42nd Republican division took positions to attack the city. The town was weakly garrisoned and the Republicans were in a commanding position. On July 5, the Republicans broke through enemy lines and on the 7th they made it into the city. The inhabitants were conquered quickly and almost in its entirety, with the exceptions of two concentrated pockets of resistance in the barracks of the Guardia Civil and the cathedral, composed of civilians with some Nationalist military support. The 60th mixed brigade did most of the operation, being supported by the other two brigades. On the other hand, the majority of the 59th Brigade was directed towards Gea de Albarrac√≠n to reinforce the positions while the 61st brigade went to Monterde (which it took control of). After the Republican advance, most of the Francoist defenders took positions on the higher part of Albarrac√≠n while the Aviaci√≥n Nacional bombarded the Republican enclaves; from this point on, the Republicans were on the defensive. Rebel Counterattack The rebel forces, composed largely of units of the Legion and Moroccan Regulars, began their advance on the roads penetrating the Sierra de Albarrac√≠n Comarca. On July 9, the Nationalist troops reorganized to form three columns under the command of General Miguel Ponte. The Republican troops received orders on July 11 to maintain their position in Albarrac√≠n at all costs and to wipe out the Francoist resistance which remained in some of the buildings of the city, which had been without food or water since the 8th. The Nationalists mounted a counterattack which beat back Republicans and on the 14th of July, Ponte's troops broke through the Republican positions and retook Albarrac√≠n. On the 16th, amid fierce Republican resistance (who were taking advantage of the area's terrain) and hard fighting, the Nationalists recovered all the positions they had lost at the beginning of the offensive. Taking advantage of the momentum from the counterattack, the Nationalists moved towards the Montes Universales and again broke through the Republican resistance, which was unable to cope with the rebel advance, and on the 21st the rebels took over several Republican towns. On July 31, the Republicans forces disintegrated in the face of the Nationalist offensive, which continued through the Montes Universales. The Nationalists halted their advance and military actions ended on August 11. Result The battle had no influence on either the Aragon front or the Battle of Brunete, although the nationalists moved forward a few kilometers and conquered some inhabitants, reinforcing their defensive positions on the southern flank of Teruel. This area remained fairly calm until the end of the war.

Synopsis Deutsch views the Enlightenment of the 18th century as near the beginning of an infinite sequence of purposeful knowledge creation. Knowledge here consists of information with good explanatory function that has proven resistant to falsification. Any real process is physically possible to perform provided the knowledge to do so has been acquired. The Enlightenment set up the conditions for knowledge creation which disrupted the static societies that previously existed. These conditions are the valuing of creativity and the free and open debate that exposed ideas to criticism to reveal those good explanatory ideas that naturally resist being falsified due to their having basis in reality. Deutsch points to previous moments in history, such as Renaissance Florence and Plato's Academy in Golden Age Athens, where this process almost got underway before succumbing to their static societies' resistance to change. The source of intelligence is more complicated than brute computational power, Deutsch conjectures, and he points to the lack of progress in Turing test AI programs in the six decades since the Turing test was first proposed. What matters for knowledge creation, Deutsch says, is creativity. New ideas that provide good explanations for phenomena require outside-the-box thinking as the unknown is not easily predicted from past experience. To test this Deutsch suggests an AI behavioural evolution program for robot locomotion should be fed random numbers to see if knowledge spontaneously arises without inadvertent contamination from a human programmer's creative input. If it did Deutsch would concede that intelligence is not as difficult a problem as he currently thinks it is. Deutsch sees quantum superpositions and the Schr√∂dinger equation as evidence for his many worlds quantum multiverse, where everything physically possible occurs in an infinite branching of alternate histories. Deutsch argues that a great deal of fiction is close to a fact somewhere in the multiverse.Beginning of Infinity, p. 294 Deutsch extols the usefulness of the concept of fungibility in quantum transactions, his universes and the particles they contain are fungible in their interactions across the multiverse structure. Deutsch explains that interference offers evidence for this multiverse phenomenon where alternate histories affect one another without allowing the passage of information, as they fungibly intertwine again shortly after experiencing alternate events. According to Deutsch, our perspective on any object we detect with our senses is just a single universe slice of a much larger quantum multiverse object. Deutsch speculates on the process of human-culture development from a genetic basis through to a memetic emergence. This emergence led to the creation of static societies where innovation occurs, but most of the time at a rate too slow for individuals to notice during their lifetimes. It was only at the point where knowledge of how to purposefully create new knowledge through good explanations was acquired that the beginning of infinity took off during the enlightenment. His explanation for human creativity is that it evolved as a way to faithfully reproduce existing memes, as this would require creative intelligence to produce a refined rule set that would more faithfully reproduce the existing memes that happened to confer benefit (and all the other memes too). From this increased creative ability, the ability to create new memes emerged and humans thus became universal constructors and technological development accelerated. Deutsch criticizes Jared Diamond's resource luck theories as to why the West came to dominate the other continents outlined in his book Guns, Germs, and Steel. For Deutsch, the sustained creation of knowledge could have arisen anywhere and led to a beginning of infinity; it just happened to arise in Europe first. Deutsch extols the philosophical concept of optimism, where although problems are inevitable, solutions will always exist provided the right knowledge is sought out and acquired. Reception David Albert, a philosophy professor at Columbia University, has described the book in a New York Times review as \\"brilliant and exhilarating\\" but presenting, instead of a \\"tight, grand, cumulative system of ideas,\\" a \\"great, wide, learned, meandering conversation\\". He also states that Deutsch does not present \\"a live scientific hypothesis,\\" but \\"[a] mood informed by profound and imaginative reflection on the best and most advanced science we have\\". Doug Johnstone writes in The Independent that Deutsch's \\"examination of the multiverse theory of quantum physics is great. But when he tries to apply his ideas to aesthetics, cultural creativity and moral philosophy, he seems on shakier ground and is less commanding as a result\\". Peter Forbes, also writing in The Independent, has a more positive take on Deutsch's ideas and mode of thinking. The Economist's review says The Beginning of Infinity is \\"equally bold\\" as Deutsch's previous book The Fabric of Reality, and \\"its conclusions are just as profound. Mr Deutsch argues that decent explanations inform moral philosophy, political philosophy and even aesthetics. He is provocative and persuasive.\\" Kirkus Reviews' take is that the book is \\"A philosophical exploration of progress, surprisingly lucid and thought-provoking\\".

The Chinese Argentine community is one of the fastest growing communities in Argentina. As of 2018, the community was made up of 200,000 people. History Since the 20th century, the Chinese in Argentina came in three waves. The first wave of immigrants came from small coastal towns between 1914‚Äì1949. The second wave of immigrants arrived from Taiwan in the 1980s and over the years, they have become accustomed to the porte√±o lifestyle. A considerable number of people from Hong Kong and the southern coastal region of China immigrated during the second wave. The third wave came in the 1990s, hailing mostly from China, mostly from the less developed province of Fujian. This group is filled with young drifters who came often through the illegal smuggling route originating in China's Fujian Province.Danwei: Chinese media, advertising, and urban life. - Chinese in Argentina - The Chinese Diaspora in Latin America by Nancy Liu However, many of the small supermarkets that are present in many neighbourhoods of Buenos Aires come from the community present during the third wave of immigration. Recently, there has been a fourth and newer wave of Chinese immigration who are mostly ambitious and educated members of China‚Äôs growing middle-class who are looking to find their place in China‚Äôs growing economy. Young employees of Chinese companies have recently arrived to work for at least two years. Today, many Chinese Argentines usually run supermercados chinos (Chinese supermarkets), which dominate the second tier of grocery stores in Buenos Aires. Tintorer√≠as (Dry Cleaners) for laundry are also a common Chinese-run business. Discrimination Since the Argentine economic crisis, many small Chinese-owned businesses have faced significant crime. Robberies are frequent, with one Chinese supermarket reportedly robbed up to 14 times in one year. Also, stories of family members shot at gunpoint in their store are not uncommon. Also, tensions have arisen with other immigrant groups as well. In June 2006, the union of truck drivers began a boycott of Chinese-owned stores. This was due to an alleged gun-related incident between a driver and a store owner, which involved illegal firearms.Los camioneros ratifican el boicot a los s√∫per y autoservicios chinos - Clar√≠n. Shortages in stores were reported due to a lack of deliveries until the boycott was officially lifted the following month.Los camioneros firmaron oficialmente la tregua con los supermercados chinos - Clar√≠n.

Filmarchiv Austria, Wien 2000, . Schwarzer was born in Javornik, then part of the Austro-Hungarian Empire and now located in the Czech Republic. Career Logo for Saturn-Film, 1908 In the early 1900s, Schwarzer resettled in Vienna and became a portrait and family photographer and chemist. To supplement his income, Schwarzer began making erotic photos which were used on naughty postcards common to the era. In 1906, he became interested in the men's-only theatre nights organized in Austrian cinemas that showed adult films, so-called Herrenabende (\\"night shows for men\\"). Seeing that money could be made from these types of films, Schwarzer organized the Saturn-Film company in 1906 to produce such films in competition to the French product then being exclusively shown. Before Schwarzer's productions, erotic films in Austria were supplied by the French Path√© brothers. Saturn-Film was the first native film production company based in Austria. Schwarzer produced and directed these erotic feature films, with basic plots (artist and model, bath scene) which allowed for voyeurism and female nudity but not, he insisted, pornography. Each film contained young local women fully nude. Unlike his predecessors, Schwarzer conducted his business as a public company, advertising in local newspapers, motion picture trade journals and adding a logo to his films like any other European producer. Saturn-Film also published a regular film catalog within its first couple years of existence. Despite this effort, Saturn-Films often appeared shorn of their logos and rendered anonymously like other, similar subjects once they got further afield of Vienna. In 1911, Saturn-Film was raided and closed down by the police as a part of a crackdown on erotic materials in Vienna. The authorities destroyed the main film vault which at that time consisted of 52 productions.Michael Achenbach, Paolo Caneppele, Ernst Kieninger: Projektionen der Sehnsucht: Saturn, die erotischen Anf√§nge der √∂sterreichischen Kinematografie. Filmarchiv Austria, Wien 2000, . Censorship prevented Saturn from rising again. Johann Schwarzer tried to get a fresh start in film distribution, but without the ‚Äòspicy‚Äô films he had become famous for. After three months, he abandoned the effort and left Vienna for Africa. He resurfaced in April 1914, when he married the young Olga Emilie Jarosh-Stehlik. Schwarzer was an army reservist who was called up with the outbreak of World War I on 28 July 1914. He was made a second lieutenant by the time he perished in battle at Wirballen, Poland on 10 October of that year.IMDb: Johann Schwarzer Legacy Saturn- Film consciously chose to advertise its films as being erotic, rather than pornographic. A quote from its 1907 catalog, probably written by Schwarzer, states \\"our films are of a purely artistic tendency, and we avoid tasteless subjects in favor of beauty.\\" Schwarzer's adult films were more professional in quality then their French and Argentine counterparts and were the most widely distributed and popular adult films made in the first decade of the 20th century. Despite the destruction of the main film vault in 1911 about a half of the 52 films produced by the company still exist in archives throughout Europe. Filmarchiv Austria has included four of Schwarzer's works in the Europa Film Treasures site; Das Sandbad (1906), Baden Verboten (1906), Das Eitle Stubenm√§dchen (1908) and Beim Fotografen (1908).

The event drew at least a million visitors and was the first international colonial exhibition, with 28 different nations presenting their colonial trade and wealth. The event was the brainchild of Edouard Agostini, a French entrepreneur. Agostini, who had previously been involved in organizing the 1878 Exposition Universelle in Paris, presented his plans to the city of Amsterdam and King William III of the Netherlands in 1880. The Dutch government was initially hesitant, but Agostini managed to secure funding from Belgian and French investors. The location chosen for the exhibition was an unused area of land behind the Rijksmuseum, which at that time was still under construction. This area is now Museumplein square. The main building was designed by the French architect Paul Fouquiau in \\"Moorish\\" style. It was constructed of wood covered with plaster and painted cloth, in order to give the impression of marble. Between the building's two large towers, a large cloth in \\"Indian\\" style was hung, with plaster heads of elephants and other animals. The building contained pavilions representing 28 different nations, including France, Germany, the United Kingdom, Belgium, Japan, the United States, China, Canada, the Ottoman Empire, Siam (Thailand), Transvaal, and the host country, the Netherlands. Items on show in the main building included a telephone, wood- and metalworking machines, and a safe large enough to fit eight people. The building's colonial section presented products such as tobacco and rubber, as well as a reconstructed Javanese-style settlement (kampung) with \\"natives\\". At that time, it was not considered degrading or racist to put humans on display; in fact, it became a regularly featured spectacle at such exhibitions (see further: Human zoo). Other structures included a music pavilion; the pavilion of the city of Amsterdam; the Dutch colonial pavilion; a Japanese bazar; various shops; and Dutch, English and German restaurants. In front of the Dutch colonial pavilion was a statue of Jan Pieterszoon Coen who, as governor- general of the Dutch East Indies, played a large part in the Dutch conquest of the Indonesian archipelago. A canal with a bamboo bridge and a Chinese junk intersected the exhibition grounds. Effects The exhibition, bringing more than a million visitors from around the world to Amsterdam, provided the city with a huge economic boost. A number of hotels were expanded or newly built in order to profit from the large number of visitors, including the Hotel Americain, the , and Hotel Krasnapolsky. The expansion of the Krasnapolsky included the glass-roofed Wintertuin lounge, with electric lighting, which at that time was considered a real novelty. In Amsterdam, modern-day remains of the exhibition are the front gate of the Vondelpark and a collection of items in the Tropenmuseum which were on show in the Dutch colonial pavilion. Some items from the Dutch colonial pavilion were also donated to the ethnological museum of Artis zoo and, after this museum was closed, ended up in the Tropenmuseum as well. However, the lion's share of the thousands of items from this pavilion was donated to the National Museum of Ethnology in Leiden. Some parts of the German restaurant are now in the Veenkoloniaal Museum in Veendam. Heineken still uses the label Dipl√¥me d'Honneur on its beer bottles, an honour that was bestowed on the brewer at the 1883 colonial exhibition.

Although seldom mentioned in historical works, it was one of the most protracted battles of the Civil War. History After having been overwhelmed in Aragon, the Segre River became for the Spanish Republic a crucial line not only for halting the devastating eastward advance of the rebel armies, but also to ensure that the vital hydroelectric dams of the Pre-Pyrenees did not fall in Francoist hands.El Pa√≠s - Regreso a la batalla del Segre Beginning in April there were constant battles in the Segre Front along a long defensive line of republican positions and fortifications. During most of 1938 there would be numerous attacks, counterattacks and skirmishes from both sides along the Segre River.Ram√≥n Salas Larrazabal (2006); p√°g. 1972 A great number of manpower and material was sent to the Eastern Army of the newly created Eastern Region Army Group in that front. The Spanish republic was able to hold unto that line until the beginning of January 1939 when it became impossible to keep holding the resistance in the Segre against the overwhelming pressure of the rebels.

After the fall of the Aragon front, a Republican division, in April 1938, was surrounded by the Nationalists in the Cinca River Valley. The division, despite being heavily outnumbered, managed to hold until 6 July and then crossed the French frontier. Background After the Battle of Teruel, the Nationalists led by the general Fidel D√°vila, launched an offensive in the Aragon front on March 1938. The Nationalists broke the Republican lines, pursued them and by April, the Nationalists reached the Mediterranean sea at Vinar√≤s and the River Segre, occupying Aragon. One republican division was isolated by the Nationalist advance in the valley of the Alto Cinca river, near the French Frontier. By the end of March, the 43rd division of the Republican Army, led by Antonio Beltran, nicknamed El Esquinazado (The Dodger), was surrounded by the Nationalist troops in the Cinca River Valley.Thomas, Hugh.

In this front the Nationalists concentrated a force of 14,000 men with 30 guns and overwhelming air power. Virtually isolated, without ammunition reserves, and outnumbered, the Republican troops managed to halt the Nationalist attacks due to the difficult terrain, the bad weather, and the dogged resistance of the troops, but by the end of May it became clear that further resistance was impossible.:es:Bolsa de Bielsa The Republican troops evacuated 4,000 civilians to France and then retreated slowly across the French frontier.

It is a player-driven persistent-world MMORPG set in a science fiction ground setting. Players pilot customisable robots on various islands connected by several teleports. These islands are either alpha ('safe' from attacks by players) or beta/gamma, meaning players can freely engage each other. Players of Perpetuum are able to participate in a number of in-game professions and activities, including mining, logistics, missions, manufacturing, trading, artifact hunting and combat (both player versus environment and player versus player). The range of activities available to the player is facilitated by a character advancement system based upon extension points accumulation (EP) in real time, even while not logged into the game. Perpetuum was first released worldwide via a digital distribution scheme on 25 Nov 2010, following a period of closed and open beta testing. The first major upgrade was the version of Perpetuum dubbed Terra Incognita, which was released on 4 May 2011. The second (current) major upgrade was released 1 June 2012, and is dubbed Gamma Frontier. The main feature of the upgrade is 24 new terraformable islands where player-built settlements (networkable buildings and defensive structures) can be constructed. The game closed on 25 January 2018. Since April 2014, Perpetuum has dropped its subscription payment model for a pay to play payment model. As of May 2014, the game has been released on Steam, being previously greenlit. Setting Set somewhere after 2208, the back story of Perpetuum explains that humanity, in search of alternative energy sources, has stumbled upon technology to create tiny particle-sized wormholes, creating shortcuts through spacetime. After sending miniature probes out to map known extrasolar planets, one of them stumbled upon a planet designated Nia, home to a synthetic, robot- like lifeform. It was soon discovered these lifeforms have unique and efficient ways to produce energy, so it was to become an objective for conquest. Earth-based IT specialists found a way by using probes to hack into the alien information system, enabling them to take over several lifeforms and set up a base, facilitated by the fact that most of the alien lifeforms were already divided by a long-standing war and were unable to respond quickly to the takeover. Now that the conquest has begun, the aliens have reinforced their networks and the war will have to be decided on the ground. As it stands, human pilots known as agents control their robots remotely, participating in the Perpetuum Project, with their main goal to transfer as much energy as possible back to earth. Nia is home to three alien factions: the Pelistal Empire (green, preferring missile launchers), the Nuimqol Union (blue, preferring railguns) and the Thelodica Clan (yellow, preferring lasers). The faction representing Earth is known as the Syndicate, which will also provide new agents with an Arkhe, a weak but fully featured beginner robot. Alpha islands are represented by a syndicate foothold, also providing security for agents against other agents. Gameplay Players start the game by either selecting a previously-created character or by creating a new one. Each Perpetuum account allows for up to three characters to be made. When players create a new character they start by choosing one of the three Earth megacorporations (ICS, Truhold-Markson, Asintec), followed by schools (combat, industrial, logistics) and further specializations. These choices also affect starting extensions and attributes. Choosing an Earth megacorporation also determines for which alien faction you'll receive starting extensions for, but by no means limit or determine what faction the player eventually can or cannot use. Universe The playing environment in Perpetuum consists of several islands, and have either alpha, beta or gamma status. Islands are connected by a teleport network. Alpha islands are relative safe; player vs player (PvP) can not be initiated unless players activate their PvP flags, and NPC's are (with some rare exceptions) of relative low difficulty and/or value. Beta islands offer more of rarer resources, more challenges and higher rewards, but players can always attack each other. Additionally, beta island offer corporation-owned outposts, to be conquered from other corporations in what is known as an intrusion. This system was later improved, with a more organic mechanic, where ownership of an outpost must be reinforced by completing small objectives randomly set every 8‚Äì16 hours, ensuring the owner has a convincing foothold in the area. All islands originally belonged to one of the three alien factions, and feature faction-specific textures and architecture. Advancement Unlike most other massively multiplayer online games, player characters in Perpetuum advance continuously over time by the accumulation of extension points (EP), a passive process that occurs in real world time so that the advancement process continues even if the player is not logged in. One (1) EP is assigned every minute to a player's account's EP pool, from which the player can install abilities, or extensions, to any of up to 3 characters. Any extension can be installed, depending on their prerequisites, but their rank (1 to 9) and attributes determine the cost for increasing levels. Although older players seem to have the advantage (having acquired more EP), younger players can install a wide assortment of extensions straight away, while older players will pay an increasingly larger amount of EP for smaller nominal advantages. Additionally, if a new player is willing to specialize, they can catch up quickly. Economy The in-game economy in Perpetuum is an open economy that is largely player-driven. Non-player character (NPC) merchants sell low level modules and ammo. The players themselves gather the necessary raw materials to manufacture a large portion of all of the robots, modules and ammunition in the game. NPC robots can be looted for items, kernels (to be sold or used for research, providing base knowledge to build items) and materials. The in-game currency is called NIC, an abbreviation for Nian Credit (the events of the game take place on the planet Nia). The amount of money or materials in the universe is not fixed and, as such, the economy operates under supply and demand. The game provides support for the trading of in-game resources, including graphs of item price history. Some players operate primarily as traders, buying, selling and transporting goods to earn profits. Others operate primarily as producers, purchasing components or raw materials and transforming them, sometimes on massive scales, into useful items such as modules, robots, ammunition, or various technologies wanted by players. Others still operate as miners, collecting and sometimes processing the raw materials used in manufacturing to sell on to others in bulk. Robots Robots in Perpetuum are organized into four general classes: Light robots, assault robots, mechs and heavy mechs. With the 3 alien factions, the game follows a rock-paper-scissors scheme, where each faction is weak to one faction, but strong to the other. Additionally, there is a fourth industrial faction, but they feature no significant offensive capabilities. Each robot has a different set of characteristics and can be fitted with different combinations of modules subject to their fitting requirements. Robots have a wide variety of characteristics, including (but not limited to) reactor size, CPU (robot's computer processing power), accumulator size and accumulator recharge rate (functionally, a battery for activating high powered systems), armor, maximum velocity, locking range, time and maximum number of lockable targets. Robot systems also receive bonuses to performance depending on the level of various appropriate extensions that have been activated by the robot's pilot. These bonuses usually correspond closely to the particular role that the robot has been designed for, and thus vary as widely as the roles of the robots. One of the most important characteristics of a robot is the slots it has available for fitting modules. Each robot has a number of slots available, ranging from a handful to ten or more. Slots and modules come in three variants: head, legs, and chassis slots, with head modules fitting in a corresponding head slot and so on. Generally speaking, head slots can be considered electronics (such as scanners or sensor amplifiers), legs slots for engineering and chassis slots are for offensive and industrial modules. Players and communities Players have several options when playing Perpetuum in regards to how they interact with the community. Some activities can be completed as a solo player, but most activities are more suitable for groups of players, for example corporations (similar to guilds in other MMOs). Corporations are run by a Chief Executive Officer (CEO), who also controls the corporation's assets. Several other roles can be given to other corporation members, covering aspects such as finances, storage space, production, promotion, recruitment and diplomacy.

Student selection for a Grandes √âcoles is based chiefly on national assessment in competitive written and oral exams. These exams occur mostly two years after graduation. Between graduation and the exams, students follow what are called classes pr√©paratoires, as part of a higher selection system. of horticulture. It was founded in 1874, on initiative of Pierre Joigneaux and the first Director was Auguste Hardy, to promote French agricultural education (Under the Act of 16 Dec. 1873). The school was located in the ‚ÄúPotager du Roi‚Äù (the King's kitchen garden) in Versailles where the former Institut National Agronomique had been established in October 1848 at the end of the Second Republic.Potager du Roi At first it was named Ecole Nationale d'Horticulture, being changed to Ecole Nationale Sup√©rieur d'Horticulture (ENSH) in 1961. In 1976, the Ecole Nationale Sup√©rieure du Paysage (ENSP) was separated from the ENSH, and both remain located at the Potager du Roi. In 1995, the ENSH was transferred to Angers, while the ENSP remained at Versailles. Three year later, the ENSH was officially combined with the national school of practitioners of horticulture and landscape (Ecole National des Ing√©nieurs de l'Horticulture et du Paysage ENITHP) in Angers to produce the Institut National d'Horticulture et de Paysage (National Institute for Horticulture and Landscape Management).History of the school Diploma of the Ecole Nationale d'Horticulture, 1903 History In October 1848 France's agricultural education was reformed through the creation of the Institut National Agronomique at Versailles specialising in the vegetable garden. In 1849, Auguste Hardy, agronomist, became Head Gardener of the Institute, replacing Mr Massey in the garden and beginning student education. At the end of the Republic, the Institute is abandoned because the Emperor, like his royal predecessors, preferred the garden as a simple source of provisions. However, in 1865 Hardy created a school dedicated to the development of new fruit varieties using improved techniques, more greenhouses and sheltered areas. After 1866 many organisations vied for control of the school until in 1872 Pierre Joigneaux proposed l'√âcole Nationale d'Horticulture (ENH), which was opened in 1874. It was to be self-financing from the sale of the products of the garden maintained by fifty \\"student- workers\\". Its mission was: \\"the training of expert gardeners who are able, after two years of theoretical and practical studies, to spread and popularize good horticultural practices and principles in our departments.\\" The garden was considered ideally situated: \\"considering all the horticultural wealth gathered at Versailles, nowhere could provide a training more complete and more varied.\\" The school then continued its tradition of production and experimentation. A weather station was installed, and different research programmes were implemented on cultivation, preservation of the fruit, chemical treatments. Greenhouses now covered the space between the Figuerie and Rue Satory near the gate of the King. It still uses some of these greenhouses. In 1889 a winter garden full of ornamental species was established, the covered area being 5,600 m2. The school was now at the forefront of French horticulture and had developed an international reputation with alumni taking leading positions in botanical gardens and farms worldwide. Hardy also accentuated the botanical nature of the ENH, implementing a school of Botany with 1900 plant species, a rose garden with 800 plants. After winter 1879-80, whose cold destroyed nearly 10,000 trees, new cultivars were introduced: 309 varieties of apples and 557 varieties of pears. More than thirty forms of fruit-producing trees were in the garden: spiral, triangular prism, fan, cords, and candelabras. In 1891 with the death of Auguste Hardy, Jules Nanot maintained the reputation of the Jardin du Roi and the ENH. Student education included studies of the architecture of the gardens and greenhouses taught by Darcel (a colleague of Alphand), and then by the famous landscape architect √âdouard Andr√©, between 1892 and 1905, and his son Ren√©- √âdouard Andr√©, who succeeded Duprat. Gradually, the teaching of the landscape architecture and design increased, creating a distinctive Versailles genre and its disciples. The program involves a thorough knowledge of plants, the science of architecture, optics, and project management. This lead in 1945 to a course on \\"the landscape and art of gardens\\". In 1961, the ENH awarded a diploma of horticultural engineer and became a National College recruiting students who had already completed their higher education and were seeing more theoretical and modern research. Merger The Institut National d'Horticulture et de Paysage (National Institute for Horticulture and Landscape Management) was established in 1997 as a merger of two grandes √©coles, the Ecole Nationale Sup√©rieure d'Horticulture (ENSH) at Versailles and the Ecole Nationale des Ing√©nieurs de l'Horticulture et du Paysage (ENITHP) at Angers. On July 2008, the Institut National d'Horticulture et de Paysage at Angers and the Agrocampus Rennes (in Rennes), merged again to form a new grande √©cole called Agrocampus Ouest. Agrocampus Ouest consists in two centres: * one in Angers, * the other at Rennes. Angers'centre of Agrocampus Ouest (or INHP) is located on the campus of Angers-Technopole, and this is now the only public higher education establishment specialising in horticultural engineering, and one of the few specialising in landscape design. Together with other educational and research establishments, the INHP researches the ecophysiology of plant development and production systems, genetic resources and plant breeding, plant protection, seed physiology, horticultural sectors of the economy, and forms in the landscape.

Up to 1,300 people were killed and at least 2,000 wounded. It is considered the first carpet bombing from air in history. Background On March 1938, the Nationalists started an offensive in Aragon, after the Battle of Teruel. On 15 March, the French government, led by L√©on Blum, decided to reopen the Spanish frontier and Russian supplies began to pass to Barcelona. Then, Mussolini decided to carry out massive air bombings against Barcelona in order to \\"weaken the morale of the Reds\\". Mussolini thought, like the Italian general Giulio Douhet, that aircraft could win a war with terror. The bombing Between the 16th and 18th of March in 1938, Barcelona was bombed by bombers of the Italian Aviazione Legionaria, the branch of the Italian Air Force fighting in the Spanish Civil War These bombers flew from Mallorca with Spanish markings. The first raid came at 22:00 on March 16th by German Heinkel He 51s. After that, there were 17 air raids by the Italian Savoia-Marchetti SM.79 and Savoia-Marchetti SM.81 bombers at three hour intervals until 15:00 on March 18th. Barcelona had little anti-aircraft artillery and no fighter cover. The Spanish Republican Air Force (FARE) didn't send fighters to Barcelona until the morning of March 17th. The repeated wave of attacks carried out by the Italians would render irrelevant the air-raid alarm system since it would no longer be clear if the sirens were announcing the beginning or the end of an attack. Furthermore, they used delayed-fuse bombs designed to pass through the roof and then explode inside the building and a new type of bomb which exploded with a strong lateral force, so as to destroy things and persons within a few inches of the ground. The bombings affected all the city and the bombers didn't attempt to destroy military targets. On the night of the 18th the working class districts were badly hit. The Italian bombers dropped 44 tons of bombs, and there were more than 1,000 civilians dead (Beevor: 1,000 dead and 2,000 wounded; Preston: around 1,000 dead; and Thomas: 1,300 dead and 2,000 wounded). Aftermath The attack was condemned by Western democracies all around the world. The American Secretary of State, Cordell Hull said: \\"No theory of war can justify such conduct. . . . I feel that I am speaking for the whole American people!\\".Foreign News: Barcelona Horrors Time Magazine, 28 March 1938 Franco was not initially informed of the attacks and was displeased; on 19 March, he asked for the suspension of the bombings, for fear of \\"complications abroad\\".Thomas, Hugh. The Spanish Civil War. Penguin Books. 2006. London. p.785Payne, Stanley G., and Jes√∫s Palacios. Franco: A personal and political biography. University of Wisconsin Pres, 2014, p.194 Mussolini, on the other hand, was very pleased with the bombings. Italian Foreign Minister and Mussolini's son-in-law Galeazzo Ciano said that: \\"He was pleased by the fact that the Italians have managed to provoke horror, by their aggression instead of complacency with their mandolins. This will send up our stock in Germany, where they love total and ruthless war.\\" Later in the year, the British journalist John Langdon-Davies - who had been present in Barcelona at the time - published an account of the attacks. He reported that the bombers had glided in at high altitude to avoid being detected by the (pre- radar) acoustic aircraft detection means available, and only restarted their engines after releasing their bomb loads, which he termed the \\"silent approach\\" method. The effect of this was that the aircraft were not detected and the alert sounded until after their bombs had exploded on target. Along with the variance of the times between each individual attack, this had a demoralizing effect on the civilian population, which suffered prolonged anxiety quite out of proportion to the number of bombs dropped over a long period of time. Coupled with the fact that there was little discernible military value in the choice of targets within the city, and the cessation of the attacks for no apparent reason, Langdon-Davies determined that the raids constituted a deliberate experiment in the use of such tactics in preparation for their application in any subsequent conflict by the Germans and Italians against the United Kingdom. * Footnotes External links *Time, Barcelona Horrors, 28 March 1938 *Catalunya martir (1938).

In March 1938 a huge Nationalist force of 150,000 men and more than 900 planes started an offensive in Aragon, breaking the Republican front.

The offensive was a failure for the Spanish Republic and many lives and military material were wasted. History The offensive was planned by General Vicente Rojo Lluch as a morale-lifting counterattack by Republican military units after the defeats suffered at the Aragon fronts.

In order to retake at least the bridgehead of the left bank the 27th, 60th and 72nd divisions of the XVIII Army Corps of the Spanish Republic counterattacked between the 12 and the 15 April. The Republican soldiers however, were mostly very young men ‚Äì some only 17 years old, hastily recruited and ill-trained ‚Äì who, despite their enthusiasm, were not successful. Again, another series of efforts to reconquer the Balaguer bridgehead took place between 22 and 29 May, but these were again fruitless and the Republican units had to withdraw in the face of the overwhelming superiority of the enemy, leaving many casualties behind. Last effort After almost three months, together with the wider Republican offensive of the Battle of the Ebro, there was again a series of combats to retake the bridgehead at Balaguer. The attacks were made between 9 and 11 August but the Republican forces were defeated again, being smashed against the superior firepower of the rebel lines.

A swift and decisive operation, it was masterminded and carried out by the Francoist military and ended up becoming a bloodbath for the Republican troops. Although it was one of the major battles in the Spanish Civil War, the relevance of the closing of M√©rida pocket was eclipsed by the onset of the Battle of the Ebro which took place roughly at the same time at the other end of the Republic.Francisco Al√≠a Miranda, Angel Ram√≥n del Valle Calzado & Olga M. Morales Encinas, La guerra civil en Castilla-La Mancha, 70 a√±os despu√©s. p. 515 History The M√©rida pocket The M√©rida pocket was the westernmost border of the Spanish Republic in 1937; protruding westwards towards M√©rida, a town that had been secured by rebel forces in 1936 at the time of the Battle of M√©rida. The pocket was a wedge of Republican territory between the rebel- held areas to the northwest and to the southwest until relatively late in the conflict. But in May 1938 the Francoist high command issued a plan to take this territory that had been in Republican hands since the Extremaduran front had stabilized in 1937. Allegedly there was the danger that the Republican Army from that position could easily attack the strategic town of M√©rida and even cut in two the Nationalist zone ‚Äîhence the notion that it was like a kind of \\"open\\" door or window that had to be closed. Therefore, after the rebel military had reached the Mediterranean in the east, the activity on the Extremaduran front was revived with the aim to conquer that territory in an operation named \\"Closing of M√©rida pocket\\".AGC.

The battle and its aftermath The offensive was planned by the Francoists in two phases: First the line of the high course of the Z√∫jar River was reinforced between the 14 and 20 June. Secondly the offensive would be carried out between 20 and 24 July encircling and trapping the Republican troops entrenched in the place. The swiftly-executed rebel pincer movement from the flanks of the pocket caught the Republicans by surprise. The battle began when rebel forces of General Saliquet from the north advanced southwards on 20 July. After four days of pounding enemy lines they met the northwards advancing armies of General Queipo de Llano at Campanario on 24 July. The combats resulted in a massive slaughter of loyalist troops belonging to the Extremaduran Army (Ej√©rcito de Extremadura) led by Colonel Ricardo Burillo. The fast victory allowed the Francoist territory to expand eastwards, reaching La Jara comarca in Toledo Province.Lucas Molina Franco, Pablo Sagarra & √ìscar Gonz√°lez, Grandes batallas de la Guerra Civil espa√±ola 1936-1939 This rebel military operation was responsible for one of the greatest losses in human lives among Spanish Republican Army soldiers in Extremadura.

History The Siege of Gandesa or Second Battle of Gandesa was part of an attempt by the Spanish Republican Army to recapture lost territory following the Battle of the Ebro, when six fully equipped republican divisions were able to successfully cross the Ebro River. The republican move initially caught the rebel faction by surprise, but the latter displayed greater logistic superiority and quickly brought in a convoy of troops from Lleida, including Regulares shock troops, the Spanish Legion and fanatical Falangists as reinforcements.

Among the attackers the XV International Brigade, who had led the Battle of Gandesa a few months before, also took part in what would be its last battle in Spain.Hugh Thomas (1976); p. 904 (Spanish edition) After its initial success, the ambitious republican offensive failed and the front stabilized in a line from Serra de P√†ndols in the west through Gandesa and neighbouring Vilalba dels Arcs, as far east as the Serra de Cavalls range and north to Serra de la Fatarella. Defended by the Nationalist 50th Division, the republican troops launched repeated attacks against Gandesa town, the wall of the local graveyard bearing the brunt of much of the combat action.La Batalla del Ebro Disregarding the advice of fellow generals Garc√≠a Vali√±o and Yag√ºe and Aranda who preferred to hold the front as it was and initiate an offensive in the North towards Barcelona, Franco wanted to regain the lost territory at any price. His plan was to keep ramming against the republican lines with repeated frontal counterattacks despite the heavy number of casualties on his own side. General Aranda compared the lack of progress at Gandesa to a fruitless fight of two rams, but Franco concentrated on the fact that he had the best of the Republican Army caught up in a 35 km long line and if he annihilated it, there would be not enough manpower on the side of the Spanish Republic to continue the war.Juan Eslava Gal√°n, Una historia de la Guerra Civil que no va gustar a nadie, Planeta, p. 142-145 After months of confrontation, on 2 November the nationalists dominated all the high points of the P√†ndols and Cavalls ranges and by 10 November all republican positions south of the Ebro were abandoned in a hasty retreat. There were a very high number of casualties on both sides; the Nationalist armies could bear them, but the republican military would not recover from the heavy losses inflicted.

This battle involved the Spanish Republican Army. The main goal of the offensive was to occupy the city of Zaragoza. The main action of the offensive was the battle of Belchite. Background In August 1937, the commander in chief of the Republican Army, Vicente Rojo, decided to launch an offensive in the Aragon front in order to take the regional capital, Saragossa. The main goal of the offensive was to stop the Nationalist offensive against Santander. Furthermore, Saragossa was the communications centre of the whole Aragon front.Thomas, Hugh. (2001). The Spanish Civil War. Penguin Books. p. 704 Opposing forces In the Aragon front the Republican Army had deployed the Army of the East, led by the general Pozas and his chief of staff Antonio Cordon. This army had six divisions (Lister's 11th Division, 26th Division, 27th Division, Walter's 35th Division, 43rd Division; and Kleber's 45th Division). Furthermore, the Republicans had 200 aircraft and many T-26 and BT-5 tanks.Thomas, Hugh. (2001). The Spanish Civil War. Penguin Books. London. p. 704 Opposing them, the Nationalists had three low-quality divisions (51st, 52nd and 105th divisions), and 15 aircraft (obsolete Heinkel He-46 light bombers and He-51 fighters).Thomas, Hugh. (2001). The Spanish Civil War. Penguin Books. London. p. 704 The offensive The Republican plan was to break through at seven different points between Zuera and Belchite in order to divide any Nationalist counter-attack. The 27th Division would occupy Zuera, turn left and attack Zaragoza. Kl√©ber's 45h Division would attack south- eastwards towards Saragossa and the 43rd Division would cross the Ebro and cut the highway from Quinto to Saragossa. But the main attack was concentrated up the south side of the Ebro Valley, with Modesto's V Corps (11th Division and 35th Division). The Republican attack began on August 24 with no artillery bombardment in order to maintain the advantage of surprise. The 27th Division occupied Zuera, the 45th Division reached Villamajor de G√°llego (six kilometres from Saragossa) and the 25th Division took Cod√≥, despite fierce Nationalist resistance. Nevertheless, Lister's 11th Division failed to occupy Fuentes de Ebro and almost all its BT-5 tanks were destroyed. Fuentes del Ebro Lister had to take the fortified town of Fuentes del Ebro in order to open the road to Zaragoza. Forty-eight BT-5 tanks carrying Spanish troops would cross the Republican lines and attack the town from the front, supporting by the troops of the XV International Brigade. Nevertheless, the attack was ill-planned. The tanks were not suited to carrying troops, very little reconnaissance was carried out, there was virtually no artillery preparation and the tanks became bogged down in the mud. The attack failed and the republican army lost 19 of its 48 tanks and more than 300 men (according to Hugh Thomas 12 tanks destroyed out of 40)Thomas, Hugh. (2001). The Spanish Civil War. Penguin Books. p. 705. An American member of the International Brigades said:http://bobrowen.com/nymas/soviet_tank_operations_in_the_sp.htm > Courage and heroism are plentiful in Spain and the Spanish people have no > lack of it. What they need is tactics. And as for tactics, on 13 October, > Regiment BT was bankrupt. Belchite On 26 August, the 25th Division took Quinto, but the delays in the Republicans' advance had given the Nationalists time to bring up reinforcements (Barron's 13th Division and Saenz de Buruaga's 150th Division and 80 aircraft from the Madrid front) and the attack on Zaragoza failed.Thomas, Hugh. (2001). The Spanish Civil War. Penguin Books. p. 705. Modesto then decided to capture the small (3,800 inhabitants) and well fortified town of Belchite. The Republican army cut the water supply of the town and the heat was appalling, but the defence of the besieged forces was vigorous.Thomas, Hugh. (2001). The Spanish Civil War. Penguin Books. p. 705. The attack on Belchite started on 1 September and, after five days of heavy bombardment and bloody combat, the Republicans managed to occupy it. The offensive ended on 6 September.Beevor, Antony. (2006). The Battle for Spain. The Spanish Civil War, 1936-1939. Penguin Books. London. pp. 296‚Äì298 Aftermath The offensive was a complete failure. The Nationalists did not stop their offensive against the Northern Republican held zone. The Republicans only advanced ten kilometres and took a handful of small towns. Furthermore, the Republican Army suffered heavy losses of armament and tanks. Indalecio Prieto said: \\"So many troops to take four or five pueblos does not satisfy the ministry of defence\\".Thomas, Hugh. (2001). The Spanish Civil War. Penguin Books. p. 705.

Background After the defeat of the Battle of Ebro, the Republican Army was broken and would never recover. The Republicans had lost most of their armament and experienced units. At the beginning of December, the Nationalists concentrated an army of 300,000-340,000 men led by General Davila in order to conquer Catalonia.Thomas 2001 p. 844 Then, Vicente Rojo, Commander in chief of the Republican army, decided to launch a diversionary offensive in the central zone in order to divert Nationalists forces from the Nationalist offensive against Catalonia. Plan P In 1937 Vicente Rojo had planned an offensive through Extremadura towards the Portuguese frontier in order to cut in a half the Nationalist held zone; the plan for this offense was code named Plan P. However, the Republican government rejected the plan. In December 1938, Rojo decided to launch the offensive anyway. One Republican army would attack through Extremadura towards Cordoba while one brigade would land at Motril, advance towards M√°laga and start an uprising in Andalusia against the Nationalists. The offensive was intended to start on 8 December, but the amphibious assault at Motril was called off just as the troops were ready to leave and the Generals Miaja and Matallana rejected the plan.Beevor 2006 p.372Thomas 2001 p.845. The Republican offensive on Extremadura did not start until 5 January, after the start of the Nationalist offensive against Catalonia. The battle Opposing forces The Republicans had assembled the Estremadura Army, to be led by the General Antonio Escobar Huertas. Among its constituent units were with the XXII Corps led by Colonel Juan Ibarrola, consisting of the 47th Division, 70th Division, and the 10th Divisions, the Agrupacion Toral led by the Major Nilamon Toral, consisting of the 6th, 28th and 52nd divisions. Additionally four mixed brigades of infantry and cavalry were attached to the army in a formation referred to as Column F. Despite its size, many of its troops lacked weapons and equipment. Opposing the Republicans, the Nationalists had seven divisions (10th, 40th, 74th, 81st, 60th, 112th and 122nd divisions) led by General Queipo de Llano. Republican Offensive On 5 January, the XXII Corps began the offensive, breaking the Nationalist lines at Hinojosa del Duque and opening a breach of 8 km long in the Nationalist forces. On 6 January, the Republican forces broke the Nationalist's second line and occupied Fuente Obejuna and on 7 January they occupied Los Blazquez and Peraleda del Zaucejo. But the Republican advance halted before Pe√±arroya. The Republican offensive was halted by the Nationalists air attacks and the adverse weather conditions causing the Republican tanks to become bogged down in mud. At the time the Republican offensive was halted, it had taken 500 square kilometres of little strategic value.Beevor 2006 p.376 Nationalist counteroffensive On 17 January, the Nationalists began a counteroffensive, retaking Peraleda del Zaucejo on 22 January and Fuente Obejuna on 25 January. By 4 February, the Nationalists had regained all the territory conquered by the Republicans and General Escobar ordered the remaining Republican forces to withdraw. Aftermath The offensive was a complete failure. The Republican forces occupied briefly a large territory, but the Nationalist offensive against Catalonia continued and on by February all Catalonia had been occupied by the Nationalists.

It is found in the Atlas Mountains of Morocco and Algeria. It was formerly considered a subspecies of the Asian crimson-winged finch. It has an average length of 13 cm. and a wingspan of ca. 32 cm. It is light brown overall, with a whitish mid-belly, a black cap and a pinkish pattern on the wings and tail. The female is slightly duller than the male. This species lives on rocky mountainsides, often at high elevation. It can be found in barren landscapes with little vegetation, and sometimes nests in rock crevices. It feeds on seeds, and during the winter descends in flocks to agricultural fields to find food. The female lays and incubates 4 or 5 blue, lightly speckled eggs. This species has a disjunct range in the High Atlas of Morocco and on the Aur√®s Mountains in north-east Algeria. At Oukaimeden, Morocco Morphology Differences between African and Asian birds There are several differences between Asian crimson-winged finches and African birds: African birds have a rosy-tinged grey-white central chin and throat, with a narrow brown breast-band below it, whereas this whole area is solidly tawny-brown on Asian birds; the brown breast and flank markings on Asian birds are more extensive than on African birds; and African birds have less black on the crown than Asian birds (on males it often tends to be restricted to the forecrown). Male birds also differ compared to the Asian birds in that they lack the extensive pink in their uppertail-coverts and have no black spots on their breast-sides, less distinct black markings on the mantle and ear-coverts, and almost no red on the face.

Background After the fall of Catalonia, the island of Menorca, the only Balearic island held by the Republic, was isolated from other Republican-held territory by the Nationalist naval blockade. Francisco Franco informed the British government that Mussolini's Italian troops would abandon the Balearic Islands after the war and the British government agreed to arrange the surrender of the Republican garrison.Beevor, Antony. The Battle for Spain. THe Spanish Civil War, 1936-1939. Penguin Books. London. 2006. p. 385 The rising On 8 January 1939 Admiral Luis Gonz√°lez de Ubieta was transferred to Menorca to take the command of the Spanish Republican naval base at Puerto Mahon. He also was given the authority to command all the Republican military forces on the island.Diario oficial n¬∫22, 22 de enero de 1939 On 7 February, the Royal Navy cruiser came to the Mah√≥n harbour with a Nationalist emissary, Fernando Sartorius, on board. Sartorius said to the Republican commander, Luis Gonz√°lez Ubieta, that the Nationalist forces would occupy the island on 8 February, but the Republican officers and supporters would abandon the island. The same day, three battalions of the Republican garrison, led by a member of the Fifth column, the officer Juan Thomas, occupied Ciutadella, after killing the Republican commander Marcelino Rodr√≠guez. One brigade of Republican troops arrived from Mahon, and defeated the rebel troops after a brief engagement and surrounded Ciutadella. Nevertheless, the Republican officers believed that the fight was useless, desired to abandon the island and the British arranged the surrender of the island to the Nationalists on board of HMS Devonshire. On 8 February, Italian and Spanish Nationalist bombers attacked Mah√≥n. The same day the Devonshire sailed to Marseille with 452 Republican refugees on board.Thomas, Hugh. The Spanish Civil War.
