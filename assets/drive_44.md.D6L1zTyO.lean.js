The organization has locations in all three regions of Tennessee, including campuses in Millington, Brentwood, and Chattanooga.  History  In 1891, a group of women from Nashville's First Baptist Church, led by Mrs. Georgia Eastman, founded the Tennessee Baptist Orphans' Home. The Tennessee Baptist Orphans' Home was first housed in the Delaware Hotel in West Nashville. In 1911, land was purchased from Major C.T. Cheek and the orphans' home was moved to its present location in Brentwood. For many years children were served at this one location. In 1950 a second campus was opened in Memphis, and in 1954 one followed in Chattanooga. By the 1950s most of the children in residence were from homes in crisis, not orphans, so board members decided in 1953 to rename the ministry to more accurately reflect its work‚ÄîTennessee Baptist Children's Homes.  Services  *Residential Care TBCH provides on-campus homes for children who are not in state custody, but whose parents or family members cannot currently provide the day-to-day care they need. These family-style homes are staffed by Christian couples serving as houseparents for up to eight resident children. *Foster Care TBCH, through The George Shinn Foster Care Program, partners with Tennessee‚Äôs Department of Children‚Äôs Services (DCS) to provide certified foster families for children who are in state custody. The program includes on-going support, direction and advocacy for foster parents by Foster Care Case Managers employed by TBCH. *Family Care TBCH provides resources for families in communities across Tennessee. They compile and maintain a network of supportive and equipping resources available through churches and other local organizations.  Locations  When family crisis prevents a child from remaining in his/her home or with other family members, the Tennessee Baptist Children's Homes is there to accept children into its residential care program. Through this program, eight children live together as an active, giving family unit in campus cottages with a married couple who serve as houseparents. Each cottage is a large, family-style home with a kitchen, family room, study area, an apartment in each cottage for the houseparents, and four bedrooms for up to eight children (two children per room). These residential campuses are located in the three regions across Tennessee: *Brentwood: The Brentwood campus is also the location of the administrative home office for the organization. *Chattanooga *Millington: Millington hosts The Ranch at Millington, not just a residential campus, but also a working ranch. Other locations include offices for their Foster Care in Jackson, and Knoxville, and approved foster care homes in dozens of other cities and towns.  Funding  The TBCH does not accept government funding. Instead, it relies on individual donors, churches, and Estate planning.  Controversies  The TBCH has been behind a number of bills to make adoption by those of the LGBTQ community illegal working with the conservative community of Tennessee.

It depicts the Annunciation on the central panel, while the surrounding panels and the outside of the wings are covered in various pairs of male saints. Description The Master of the Legend of Saint Ursula's mastery of oil painting is evident in this beautifully-preserved triptych. His craftsmanship made him one of the premiere painters in late fifteenth century Bruges. The central panel of this triptych shows the moment of the Annunciation, as the Archangel Gabriel interrupts Mary's prayers to announce her selection. His vestments link Gabriel to the Mass, and so tie the Annunciation itself to the sacraments. His banner reads Ave Gratia Plena (Hail, full of grace), the first words of his salutation to her. The dove hovering over Mary's head symbolizes the Holy Spirit impregnating her. The bedroom setting is appropriate, since the triptych depicts the moment her marriage to God is consummated. The flowers behind her are traditional symbols for Mary: lilies for her purity and columbine for her sorrow. The wings of the triptych contain an array of saints in verdant landscapes. The upper left panel has Jerome and Francis; lower left, Bernardino of Siena and Anthony Abbot; upper right, John the Baptist and Benedict; lower right, Michael and Christopher. When not in use, the wings would have been closed to conceal the brilliant interior, leaving visible only grisaille portraits of Paul and Bernard resembling statues. Acquisition The IMA acquired this artwork one particularly hectic week in 1997, when they also purchased major works by Willy Finch and Richard Edward Miller. On December 3, associate curator of pre-1800 paintings and sculptures Ronda Kasl traveled to Sotheby's London branch to bid on the triptych. Relying on stealth, she stayed out of the bidding at first and allowed her competitors to dismiss her as a scholarly observer. She then blindsided them around the $1 million mark, battling it out with a prominent New York art dealer before securing the artwork for $1.25 million. After this triumph, she rode the Tube back to her hotel. The acquisition was funded by the Lilly Endowment and Anonymous Art Fund. As part of the IMA's permanent collection, it has the accession number 1997.138. See also * Annunciation Triptych (Lorenzo Monaco) ReferencesExternal links *IMA page.

More recent reviews have questioned this however. It is believed to interact with the low-molecular weight chromium (LMWCr) binding substance to amplify the action of insulin. Today, the use of chromium as a dietary supplement for the treatment of diabetes mellitus type 2 is still controversial. This is because most of the clinical studies that have been conducted around chromium have been administered only for short periods of time on small sample populations, and have in turn yielded variable findings. To better understand the potential role chromium may play in the treatment of type II diabetes, long-term trials need to be conducted for the future. History The notion of chromium as a potential regulator of glucose metabolism began in the 1950s when Walter Mertz and his co-workers performed a series of experiments controlling the diet of rats. The experimenters subjected the rats to a chromium deficient diet, and witnessed an inability of the organisms to respond effectively to increased levels of glucose within the blood. They then included \\"acid-hydrolyzed porcine kidney and Brewer's yeast\\" in the diet of these rats, and found that the rats were now able to effectively metabolize glucose. Both the porcine kidney and Brewer's yeast were rich in chromium, and so it was from these findings that began the study of chromium as a regulator of blood glucose. The idea of chromium being used for the treatment of type II diabetes was first sparked in the 1970s. A patient receiving total parenteral nutrition (TPN) had developed \\"severe signs of diabetes\\", and was administered chromium supplements based on previous studies that proved the effectiveness of this metal in modulating blood glucose levels. The patient was administered chromium for a total of two weeks, and by the end of this time-period, their ability to metabolize glucose had increased significantly; they also now required less insulin (\\"exogenous insulin requirements decreased from 45 units/day to none\\"). It was these experiments that were performed in the 1950s and 1970s that paved the foundation for future studies on chromium and diabetes. In 2005, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration approved a Qualified Health Claim for chromium picolinate with a requirement for very specific label wording: \\"One small study suggests that chromium picolinate may reduce the risk of insulin resistance, and therefore possibly may reduce the risk of type 2 diabetes. FDA concludes, however, that the existence of such a relationship between chromium picolinate and either insulin resistance or type 2 diabetes is highly uncertain.\\"FDA Qualified Health Claims: Letters of Enforcement Discretion, Letters of Denial U.S. Food and Drug Administration, Docket #2004Q-0144 (August 2005). In 2010, chromium(III) picolinate was approved by Health Canada to be used in dietary supplements. Approved labeling statements included: \\"...provides support for healthy glucose metabolism.\\" The European Food Safety Authority (EFSA) approved claims in 2010 that chromium contributed to normal macronutrient metabolism and maintenance of normal blood glucose concentration. A 2016 review of meta-analyses concluded that whereas there may be modest decreases in fasting plasma glucose or gylcated hemoglobin that achieve statistical significance, the changes were rarely large enough to be expected to be relevant to clinical outcome. Human studies Looking at the results from four meta-analyses, one reported a statistically significant decrease in fasting plasma glucose levels (FPG) and a non-significant trend in lower hemoglobin A1C (HbA1C). A second reported the same, a third reported significant decreases for both measures, while a fourth reported no benefit for either. A review published in 2016 listed 53 randomized clinical trials that were included in one or more of six meta-analyses. It concluded that whereas there may be modest decreases in FPG and/or HbA1C that achieve statistical significance in some of these meta-analyses, few of the trials achieved decreases large enough to be expected to be relevant to clinical outcome. Proposed mechanism of action The mode of action through which chromium aided in the regulation of blood glucose levels is poorly understood. Recently, it has been suggested that chromium interacts with the low-molecular weight chromium (LMWCr) binding substance to potentiate the action of insulin. LMWCr has a molecular weight of 1500, and is composed solely of the four amino acid residues of glycine, cysteine, aspartic acid and glutamate. It is a naturally occurring oligopeptide that has been purified from many sources: rabbit liver, porcine kidney and kidney powder, bovine liver, colostrum, dog, rat and mouse liver. Widely distributed in mammals, LMWCr is capable of tightly binding four chromic ions. The binding constant of this oligopeptide for chromium ions is very large, (K ‚âà 1021 M‚àí4), suggesting it is strong and tightly binding. LMWCr exists in its inactive or apo form within the cytosol and nucleus of insulin-sensitive cells. When insulin concentrations within the blood rise, insulin binds to the external subunit of the insulin-receptor proteins, and induces a conformational change. This change results in the autophosphorylation of the tyrosine residue located on the internal √ü-subunit of the receptor, thereby activating the receptor's kinase activity. An increase in insulin levels also signals for the movement of transferrin receptors from the vesicles of insulin-sensitive cells to the plasma membrane. Transferrin, the protein responsible for the movement of chromium through the body, binds to these receptors, and becomes internalized via the process of endocytosis. The pH of these vesicles containing the transferrin molecules is then decreased (resulting in increased acidity) by the action of ATP-driven proton pumps, and as a consequence, chromium is released from the transferrin. The free chromium within the cell is then sequestered by LMWCr. The binding of LMWCr to chromium converts it into its holo or active form, and once activated, LMWCr binds to the insulin receptors and aids in maintaining and amplifying the tyrosine kinase activity of the insulin receptors. In one experiment that was performed on bovine liver LMWCr, it was determined that LMWCr could amplify the activity of protein kinase receptors by up to seven- fold in the presence of insulin. Furthermore, evidence suggests that the action of LMWCr is most effective when it is bound to four chromic ions. When the insulin signaling pathway is turned off, the insulin receptors on the plasma membrane relax and become inactivated. The holo-LMWCr is expelled from the cell and ultimately excreted from the body via urine. LMWCr cannot be converted back into its inactive from due to the high binding affinity of this oligopeptide for its chromium ions. As of currently, the mechanism through which apo-LMWCr is replaced within the body is unknown.

Family life Vranck was the son of Gielis Vrancken, a burgomaster of his native Zevenbergen. He studied law, probably abroad, and practiced law before the Hof van Holland (high court of the province of Holland) since 1578. He married twice. The name of his first wife apparently has been lost, but he remarried in 1615 with Elisabeth van Westerbeek, daughter of Nicolaas van Westerbeek, Lord of Katendrecht, and Margaretha van Roon. He died without issue. Career In 1583 he was appointed Pensionary of the city of Gouda, which he henceforth represented in the States of Holland. Here he became a close ally of the Land's Advocate of Holland, Johan van Oldenbarnevelt. Vrancke was very much opposed to the attempts of the States-General of the Netherlands to procure a new sovereign, after the departure of the Duke of Anjou. When the Treaty of Nonsuch nevertheless introduced a kind of English protectorate over the budding republic, with the arrival of the Earl of Leicester and English representatives on the Council of State of the Netherlands, Vrancke became one of the fiercest opponents of English influence and policies. Leicester encouraged the extreme Calvinist and democratic faction in the Republic's politics against the Regenten, of which Vranck was a leader. =The Deduction= In 1587 one of the English members of the Council of State, Thomas Wilkes, launched an attack on the pretensions of the Regenten to sovereignty with a \\"Remonstrance\\" to the States of Holland, asserting that \\"by default of a legal prince\\"Wilkes didn't want this to apply to England that had a legal prince in Elizabeth I of England sovereignty belonged to the People, and not to Regenten who at best represented that People. Such an attack on their legitimacy could not be left unchallenged by the States, who commissioned Vranck to write a blistering reply, which he did in the form of his Deduction (with the very long nameSee Works below.). This pamphlet took the form of a historical dissertation, going back 800 years to the mythical origins of the county of Holland and its political institutions, and \\"proving\\" that since time immemorial sovereignty had resided in the vroedschappen and nobility, and that it was administered by (not transferred to) the States, next to the Count of Holland (whose place had recently been declared vacant by the Act of Abjuration). In other words, in this view the republic already existed so it did not need to be brought into being. Vranck's conclusions reflected the view of the States at that time and would form the basis of the ideology of the States-Party faction in Dutch politics, in their defense against the \\"monarchical\\" views of their hard-line Calvinist and Orangist enemies in future decades. This dissertation was received with great enthusiasm by the States, who later had it entered in the Groot Placaetboeck (codex of Dutch laws). It formed the basis of constitutional expositions by Hugo Grotius (Liber de antiquitate reipublicae Batavicae; On the Antiquity of the Batavian Republic, 1610) and Simon van Slingelandt. The States were so enamored of Vranck that they offered him the post of deputy-Land's Advocate, under Van Oldenbarnevelt, but he had to decline, because the city of Gouda refused to let him go. However, two years later, in 1589, his contract as Pensionary was not renewed. =Career after 1589= After his dismissal by Gouda Vranck again took up his law practice in The Hague. In 1590 he represented the cities of Gouda and Haarlem in an important lawsuit against the city of Rotterdam about a dam (the Hildam) in the Rotte river. In 1592 he was appointed a justice in the Hoge Raad van Holland en Zeeland (Supreme Court of the provinces of Holland and Zeeland). In this capacity Vrancke was sent as an intermediary by the States-General in 1597 to resolve a conflict between the city of Groningen and its Ommelanden. Meanwhile, he had declined an offer by the States of Utrecht to succeed Floris Thin as pensionary, and a similar offer of the city of Leiden. In the period after 1592 relations between Vranck and Oldenbarnevelt cooled, as they were opposed on important policy questions. Vranck, together with Willem Usselincx, was very much in favor of giving the proposed Dutch West India Company (W.I.C.) in the years leading up to the Twelve Years' Truce a similar status as the Dutch East India Company, because he expected the new company to cause the Spanish Empire, with which the Republic was fighting the Eighty Years' War, much harm in its American possessions. As Oldenbarnevelt knew that for that reason a truce would become impossible if the plans for founding the company proceeded, he frustrated the plans of Vranck and Usselincx for the W.I.C. Later Vranck opposed the Erastian stance of Oldenbarnevelt and Grotius in the conflict with the Contra- Remonstrants, which he thought too extreme. He was no Contra-Remonstrant himself, though, as witnessed by his tolerant stance in religious matters expressed in the polemical Wederlegghinge (Refutation) that he wrote against a pamphlet by Franciscus Haraeus' (Impartial explanation of the causes of the war in the Netherlands), in itself a reaction to the work of Grotius (which in turn was based on Vranck's own work).

The term \\"embedded democracy\\" was coined by political scientists Wolfgang Merkel, Hans- J√ºrgen Puhle, and Aurel Croissant, who identified \\"five interdependent partial regimes\\" necessary for an embedded democracy: electoral regime, political participation, civil rights, horizontal accountability, and the power of the elected representatives to govern.Merkel (2004) p.33 The five internal regimes work together to check the power of the government, while external regimes also help to secure and stabilize embedded democracies.Merkel (2004) p.36-27 Together, all the regimes ensure that an embedded democracy is guided by the three fundamental principles of freedom, equality, and control.Merkel (2004) p.43-45Buhllman et. al (2008) p.7 Embedded democracy The ideal embedded democracy is guided by the three fundamental democratic principles of freedom, equality, and control.Merkel (2004) p.43-45 Merkel uses Robert Dahl's definition of political equality, which includes equality \\"before the law and in the political process.\\" Buhllman et. al p.7 While equality can infringe upon freedom, an embedded democracy should establish a balance between equality and freedom; to preserve the equality-freedom equilibrium, there must be checks on government power (horizontal and vertical accountability).Buhlmann et. al p.9 =Internal regimes of embedded democracy=Democratic electoral regime Merkel writes about five different forms of internal embeddedness, with democratic electoral regime occupying the central position because \\"it is the most obvious expression of the sovereignty of the people, the participation of citizens, and the equal weight allotted to their individual preferences.\\"Merkel (2004) p.38 Democratic electoral regime is the backbone of an embedded democracy because it differentiates between authoritarian regimes and democratic regimes.Merkel (2004) p.38 For a democratic regime, equal political rights are a requirement, and \\"the citizens of the state should be included\\" in the political process. Four factors support the democratic electoral regime: \\"universal, active suffrage, universal, passive right to vote, free and fair elections and elected representatives.\\" In order to maintain a democratic electoral regime, all four factors must be present.Dahl (1989) p.221 Voters must all be able to vote in free and fair elections, without coercion, to elect representatives for themselves in the government. An electoral democracy is a form of government in which the democratic electoral regime is present, but other attributes of liberal embedded democracies are lacking. Merkel writes that the \\"electoral democracy merely entails that the election of the ruling elite be based on the formal, universal right to vote, such that elections are general, free and regular.\\"Merkel (2004) p.38 Freedom House uses its own set of criteria for determining whether or not a state is democratic, which include the existence of free and fair elections Furthermore, \\"the most popular definition of democracy equates it with regular elections.\\" The principle of democratic electoral regimes is an important one for embedded democracy because electoral regimes are the base of democracies; electoral regimes act as the foundation for the other internal regimes due to the importance of elections for democratic processes.Merkel (2004) p.40 Political participation The internal regime of political participation is closely related to the electoral regime.Merkel (2004) p.38 According to Merkel, participatory rights \\"make the public arena an independent political sphere of action, where organizational and communicative power is developed.\\" Merkel (2004) p.39 Political participation is facilitated by freedom of expression, freedom of assembly, the right to petition, and freedom of the press.Merkel (2004) p.39 In Merkel's vision of embedded democracy, citizens are able to form independent interest groups and organize parties to help them express their political preferences.Merkel (2004) p.39 Political participation is not limited to traditional institutionalized channels for expression; it can take place in arenas like the private media and civil society.Merkel (2004) p.39 Some scholars of democracy disagree with Merkel's assertion that frequent political participation is the ideal for a representative democracy. Joseph Schumpeter sees direct participation as limited to elections in a representative democracy; in the intervals between elections, citizens allow representatives to speak for them.Pateman (1970) p.3 Robert Dahl argues that only a small portion of the population will be active in political participation and warns that mass participation in a representative democracy could lead to dictatorship.Pateman (1970) p.9 In weak or failed states, \\"low- intensity citizenship\\" is often commonplace. This means that many people are denied their full political rights or choose not to exercise them.O'Donnell, Guillermo. \\"Poverty and Inequality in Latin America: Some Political Reflections,\\" in Vi'ctor E. Tokman and Guillermo O‚ÄôDonnell (eds), Poverty and Inequality in Latin America (Notre Dame, IN: University of Notre Dame Press, 1998), p.195‚Äì215 Political participation in modern democracies is frequently weakened by public apathy and disinterest in government.Pateman (1970) p.1 As government bureaucracies have grown in size, people have generally participated in political processes less frequently, especially those in low socioeconomic groups.Pateman (1970) p.2 Some countries have more equitable voting patterns than others; for instance, Denmark has less income inequality than the United States as well as higher rates of political participation. However, political participation does not depend solely on income distribution: it is also influenced by individual motivation and group affiliation.p. In some cases, individuals whose economic status predisposes them to political apathy are more likely to participate if motivated by identification with a large group.Verba et. al (1987) Proponents of deliberative democracy believe that the ideal democracy allows individuals to participate equally in discussions. In Fishkin's vision of deliberative democracy, interest groups or parties do not dominate a discussion.Fishkin (2009) Fishkin acknowledges difficulties in achieving mass participation: people view their opinions as statistically insignificant, and they are often uneducated about political topics and easily influenced by the media. In modern democracies, most citizens avoid discussing politics with people they disagree with, which limits the potential for conciliation and compromise. While the internet can provide a forum for deliberation and potentially change participation patterms, it may also increase political polarization.Fishkin (2009) Deliberative polling may offer one means for political participation.Fishkin (2009)Democracy, Representative and Participatory. (2008). In W. A. Darity, Jr. (Ed.), International Encyclopedia of the Social Sciences (2nd ed., Vol. 2, pp. 283-285). Detroit: Macmillan Reference USA. Civil rights The first two partial regimes of embedded democracy, the democratic electoral regime and political rights of participation, must be supplemented by civil rightsMerkel (2004) p.39Buhlmann et. al p.15 Civil rights are central to the rule of law in an embedded democracy.Merkel (2004) p.39 Merkel defines the rule of law as ‚Äúthe principle that the state is bound to uphold its laws effectively and to act according to clearly defined prerogatives.‚Äù Merkel (2004) p.39 The rule of law contains and limits state power. The core of liberal rule of law lies in constitutional rights. These rights protect individuals against executive and legislative actions that infringe on an individual‚Äôs freedom. Independent courts are also an important aspect of the rule of law.Buhlmann et. al p.18 Courts need the authority to review the behaviors of the executive and legislative branches. Merkel calls the courts ‚Äúconstitutional custodians of the legislature and supervisors of executive conformity to law.‚Äù Merkel (2004) p.39-40 Civil rights are negative rights of freedom against the state.Merkel (2004) p.39 These rights need to be protected from any majority of citizens or parliament to prevent a tyranny of the majority. Alternative models for assessing democracies Defective democracy is an alternative to terms such as electoral democracy, illiberal democracy, or partial democracy, all of which describe governing systems that meet only some of the conditions required for a full democracy.Merkel (2004) p.34 Merkel argues that using embedded democracy as the basis for assessing real regimes is a more nuanced method than the quantitative rankings released by organizations like Freedom House which are often used to categorize a democracy as liberal, semi-liberal, or illiberal.Merkel (2004) p.35 Embedded and defective democracies are primarily categorized based on their institutions rather than their purposes or outcomes. This is in keeping with the procedural approach to democratic scholarship followed by scholars such as Schmitter and Huntington. An embedded democracy can be considered a type of consolidated democracy, meaning that the democratic regime in an embedded democracy is seen as legitimate and stable.Merkel (2004) p.33 Political scientists debate the definition of democratic consolidation, but at minimum, a consolidated democracy is entrenched so that democracy is considered \\"the only game in town.\\" Some scholars, like Merkel, take a maximalist approach to defining consolidated democracy by specifying the partial regimes of consolidation. Gunther considers three dimensions of consolidation‚Äîinstitutional, attitudinal, and behavioral‚Äîwhile Linz and Stepan highlight five arenas for consolidation: civil society, political society, rule of law, the state apparatus and economic society.Puhle and Hans-J√ºrgen (2005) Other scholars have developed multidimensional models of democracy that are similar to Merkel's embedded democracy model. For instance, Dahl defines polyarchy based on seven distinct criteria: elected officials, free elections, inclusive suffrage, the right to run for office, freedom of expression, alternative information, and associational autonomy. Some scholars critique Merkel's model for merely describing the institutional elements found in a liberal embedded democracy and then categorizing other \\"hybrid regimes\\" as diminished subtypes of democracy. Jayasuriya and Rodan point out that Merkel's model fails to account for how and why regimes form. M√∏ller and Skanning praise Merkel's work for creating a cohesive system of democratic subtypes but argue that Merkel suffers from the \\"radial delusion,\\" meaning that it lacks a hierarchical structure, which makes it difficult to conduct consistent empirical analyses of democratic regimes. According to M√∏ller and Skanning, there are also inconsistencies between Merkel's original papers on embedded and defective democracy and later works by his colleagues Aurel Croissant and Hans-J√ºrgen Puhle.

(May 1816 ‚Äì 25 October 1882) (Goode sounds like 'good') was a South Australian merchant closely associated with the Murray River town of Goolwa. History Goode was born in the parish of Thornbury, Herefordshire, England, in May 1816. In 1851 he arrived in South Australia, and in 1852 pitched his tent in Goolwa and shortly afterwards built a wooden general store and dwelling house near where the police station later stood. In those days Goolwa was known as \\"The Elbow\\", and Port Elliot as \\"The Knob\\", and the few residents were located in huts, the day of houses not having arrived for a locality so far away from the metropolis. Goolwa was at the entrance through the Murray Mouth through which Captain Cadell's steamer the Lady Augusta made its first trip up the river as far as Swan Hill with Governor Young and party, and from where William Randell in Mary Ann made the same trip with little fanfare. The River Murray Steam Navigation Company followed, the tramway to Port Elliot was constructed, and the famous attempt at a breakwater there, later abandoned. It became a major transport hub before the construction of the road network, particularly of wool and wheat. As Goolwa prospered his business grew with it, and necessitated the erection of commodious premises in Cadell Street. In 1873 he took over the business and stock of competitor Emanuel Cohen. Around 1880, with failing health, he gave up the business to his two sons, Thomas and Edward Goode, and retired to his residence \\"Thornbury\\", a short distance from the township. He suffered considerably before dying, and was buried in the Currency Creek cemetery. In March 1884 the shop was largely destroyed by fire, and was rebuilt within the old walls, which had survived largely intact. In 1952 Thomas Goode & Co. of Goolwa celebrated the 100th year of trading in Goolwa, for most of that time in the same premises, and at that time under the managership of Harold Goode. The shop was still standing in 2011, as a homewares and clothing store \\"Chantillie Place\\", owned by local resident Peter Smith.http://alexhistory.pbworks.com/w/page/28618251/Goode%27s%20Store Alexandrina Local History: Goode's Store Other interests Mr Goode was chosen as Goolwa's first mayor, and for a number of years filled the office of Justice of the Peace also. The Southern Agricultural Society many times re- elected him as its President, and he was frequently urged to accept nomination to the House of Assembly, but he always declined. He believed in the practicability of the Goolwa canal scheme (which would have cut a direct route from the town to the sea; a scheme for which a parliamentary Bill was passed but never implemented), and advocated its formation with great energy, gathering a great deal of information and making some valuable diagrams and models illustrating how it could be carried out. In those days of limited populations in country villages medical attendance was a scarce article, but fortunately for Goolwa Mr. Goode had considerable skill and knowledge in surgery and pharmacy (he was a member of the Pharmaceutical Society of Great Britain), and his advice and medicines were greatly valued, without fee or reward, as many owners of broken legs and arms could testify. Family :A related Goode family came from Kyre Magna, Worcestershire: Thomas, Charles, Henry Abel, William and Benjamin Powell Goode on the Hope in 1858. William, B. P., H. A. Goode worked a shop at Yankalilla Charles Rufus Goode came out in 1860, A further brother, Matthew arrived on the South Australian in 1868. Two sisters, Ann and Elizabeth (ca. 1837 ‚Äì 28 May 1925) who married a Mr. Porter, had daughter Mrs David Herbertson also migrated to South Australia. Thomas Goode snr. JP. (May 1816 ‚Äì 25 October 1882) and Mrs. Goode (died ca. 10 May 1859) had a daughter Fanny (ca. 1855 ‚Äì 27 January 1911) and two sons: =Tom Goode= Thomas \\"Tom\\" Goode jun. (1846 ‚Äì 14 July 1921) born in Hereford, came out with his parents, was educated at St Peter's College and for a few years in England but returned to take over the business when his father took ill. He also held interests (as Goode & Johnston) in steamers serving Lakes Albert and Alexandrina, and owned the paddle-steamer City of Oxford. He was a Justice of the Peace and a Commissioner of Affidavits of the Supreme Court, was at one time Mayor of Goolwa, and was President of the local Agricultural Society, and also of the Regatta Club and Institute. He was also President of the British and Foreign Bible Society. Tom Goode acted as deputy electoral returning officer for a long period, was captain of the local rifle club, and was a non- commissioned officer of cavalry under Lieut.-Col. Higgins at the time of the visit of the Duke of Edinburgh to Adelaide. He was present at the opening of the bridge over the creek at Ashbourne, and at the laying of the foundation stone of the Adelaide G.P.O., which ceremonies were performed by the Duke of Edinburgh. He was also a member of the Encounter Bay School Board of Advice, a local preacher in the Methodist Church, and superintendent of the Sunday school for 40 years, a member of the Corinthian Lodge of Freemasons, and Past Master of the Grand Lodge of South Australia. He died after a brief illness and a subsequent operation. He married (1) Jane Harkes Johnston (ca. 1850 ‚Äì 23 March 1896) (a daughter of Capt. Thomas Johnston, a pioneer river trader; brother Edward married her sister Alison) on 22 March 1872. They had seven sons and four daughters.

Their children were: *T(homas) Charles Goode, of Mypolonga (1873 ‚Äì 22 June 1947) After leaving college he was employed by his uncle at Matthew Goode & Co., of Adelaide, then after assisting in his father's business at Goolwa, went to Broken Hill, where he ran a drapery business. He returned to the River Murray, and traded on the Lower Murray and Lakes. When the Mypolonga irrigation settlement was opened, he was one of the original settlers. He was later in charge of a number of steamers for the Murray Shipping Co. and for A. H. Landseer. Ltd. During the last two years he was part-owner, with P. W. Richards, of the excursion steamer Renmark. Mr. Goode was a local Methodist preacher. He died at his son's home in Yankalilla. :His first wife was Janet Harkes Dickson ( ‚Äì 18 June 1904), a daughter of Capt. James Dickson, of Goolwa on 9 November 1898. He married again, to Esther Julienne \\"Ethie\\" Gibson on 6 May 1908. He left two sons and two daughters: Keith Goode (Goolwa), David Goode (Yankalilla), Jean (Mrs. D. Hill of Mypolonga) and Betty (Mrs. C. Groth of Torrens Vale). *Catherine or Katherine \\"Kitty\\" Goode (1875‚Äì ) married Charles William Rogers (ca. 1870 ‚Äì 3 February 1949) on 22 May 1901. Charles was a senior Commonwealth Public Servant and prominent in the Unley Methodist Church and Sunday School; Catherine was active in Unley branch of the Woman's Christian Temperance Union, serving as president and secretary. *Arthur Goode (1877 ‚Äì 9 June 1912) was a commercial traveller in Western Australia for Goode Durrant and Co. *Francis \\"Frank\\" Goode (14 June 1879 ‚Äì ca. May 1951) was educated at the Goolwa public school and Prince Alfred College. On leaving school he entered the Goolwa post office and later spent 11 years in Adelaide, first on the staff of the Bank of Adelaide and later in the employ of Matthew Goode and Co. In 1906 he began a business at Meningie, using a converted Echuca steamer Undaunted and later at Narrung as well. In 1937 he sold his business and took the position of clerk of the Meningie District Council, in which he served until a few months before his death at Meningie. :In 1911 he married Adeline Cross, who, with two sons, F. William and T. M. \\"Max\\" Goode, and three daughters, Mary (Mrs. Bob Bond) and her twin Marjorie, and Eleanor H. (Mrs. Hope R. Watts), survived him. *Harold Dakin? Deykin? Goode (9 April 1881 ‚Äì ) took over the Goolwa store. He was very active in the community, serving as auditor for the Goolwa Council from 1904 to 1931 (and mayor in 1931), committee member of the Goolwa Regatta Club, Goolwa Athletic Club, Goolwa Bowls Club, Goolwa Institute and Alexandra Bowling Association, including many stints as secretary or president of these organisations. He was president of Goolwa Regatta Club from 1930 to 1933, Mayor from 1929 to 1932, secretary of the Goolwa Institute, on the finance committee of the South Coast Hospital, Justice of the Peace and president of Goolwa Bowling Club.

Retrieved 21 February 2013 The group began recording for Specialty Records in Los Angeles in 1947, and established a national reputation for their innovative and rhythmic musical style. Alexander also carried out A&R; functions for Specialty, identifying new recording acts. In 1949 he heard the teenage Sam Cooke sing with the Highway Q.C.'s, and the following year, after Cooke had joined the Soul Stirrers, he signed the group to a recording contract. Alexander also brought several other gospel groups to the label, but devoted much of his attention to the Soul Stirrers, increasingly seeing Cooke as someone who could become a commercially successful teen idol by performing secular rather than spiritual music. Peter Guralnick, Sweet Soul Music: Rhythm And Blues And The Southern Dream Of Freedom, Canongate Books, 2002 The Soul Stirrers, with Cooke, and the Pilgrim Travelers, with Alexander, toured extensively together in the early and mid 1950s. With Alexander's encouragement and guidance, Cooke began recording as a solo singer in 1957. He achieved great commercial success both before and after leaving Specialty and joining first Keen and then, in 1960, RCA. Alexander established the Kags Music firm in 1958, and in 1960 he and Cooke joined together as business partners to establish SAR Productions, with the aim of recording and marketing both gospel and rhythm and blues recordings. They later established the Derby label to record pop music, Jay Warner, American Singing Groups: From 1940 to Today, Hal Leonard Corporation, 2006, pp.53-54 and also collaborated as songwriters on songs such as \\"Stand By Me Father\\", \\"That's Where It's At\\", and \\"Together Let's Find Love\\".

Published on June 5, 2012, the novel is narrated by Alina Starkov, a teenage orphan who grows up in the Russia- inspired land of Ravka before her entire life changes after she unexpectedly harnesses a power she never knew she had in order to save her best friend. Plot summary Alina Starkov is a teenaged orphan, a citizen of the Kingdom of Ravka. She grew up with Malyen Oretsev at an orphanage in Keramzin, which is sponsored by a wealthy patron. As the story begins they are marching to the Unsea (also referred to as the Fold), a perpetually dark, barren, strip of land cutting most of Ravka off from the sea. Periodic expeditions are sent across to take goods to the sea and bring back imports. The crossing is dangerous because the Unsea is inhabited by monsters named volcra. Early in their crossing, the volcra attack, and, while saving Mal, Alina displays an extraordinary Grisha talent. The Grisha are people with the ability to manipulate the elements to use as weapons, e.g. to call fire, to summon wind, to stop hearts. Alina can summon light. The leader of the Grisha, the Darkling, immediately rushes Alina to the capital of Os Alta, saying her power is unique and valuable and makes her an assassination target by enemies of Ravka. While there she meets other Grisha. She struggles to fit in and to believe in her abilities, and begins rigorous training. She feels a strong attraction to the Darkling, which he seems to reciprocate. During two encounters they kiss, and Alina is confused by her reactions to the kisses. After demonstrating her power to the King and his court, Alina is told by her tutor Baghra that she must flee, that the Darkling is using her, that the Darkling created the Unsea, and that he intends to enslave her and use her Grisha power to conquer the world. Baghra also reveals that she is the Darkling‚Äôs mother. Two weeks into her flight, she is nearly captured, being saved by Mal. Mal has a nearly supernatural ability to track and was sent to find her, which he did. But instead of turning her in, he helps her escape. They decide to hunt the magic stag in the far north. If Alina kills the stag and makes a necklace of his antlers, her powers will be greatly amplified. After much time and effort they find the stag, just as they realize how much they love each other. Alina refuses to kill the stag, and the stag acknowledges this. At that moment the Darkling and his minions appear. The Darkling kills the stag and places the antler necklace on Alina, making her his absolute slave, unable to disobey him in the slightest. They quickly return south to the major crossing point of the Unsea. The Darkling forces Alina to protect the ship during the crossing. Near the other side, the Darkling extends the Unsea, causing great death and destruction. He then throws Mal off the ship, onto the Unsea, to be devoured by monsters. In desperation, Alina finally realizes that her act of mercy, sparing the stag, gives her the possibility to break free of the Darkling's enslavement. Her love of Mal grants her the strength she needs. Alina breaks free, leaps out of the ship, saves Mal, and destroys the ship. The book ends with Mal and Alina taking passage across the True Sea, escaping from Ravka and the Darkling. Development Shadow and Bone is Bardugo‚Äôs first novel. When Entertainment Weekly questioned Bardugo about her inspiration for the series, she explained, \\"In most fantasy, darkness is metaphorical; it‚Äôs just a way of talking about evil (darkness falls across the land, a dark age is coming, etc.). I wanted to take something figurative and make it literal. So the question became, 'What if darkness was a place?' What if the monsters lurking there were real and more horrible than anything you‚Äôd ever imagined beneath your bed or behind the closet door? What if you had to fight them on their own territory, blind and helpless in the dark? These ideas eventually became the Shadow Fold.\\" Bardugo was inspired to model her fantasy world, Ravka, after the Russian Empire of the early 1800s. When asked why she chose such a peculiar setting, Bardugo explained, \\"I think there‚Äôs tremendous power in the images we associate with Russian culture and history, these extremes of beauty and brutality that lend themselves to fantasy. And honestly, as much as I love broadswords and flagons of ale‚Äîand believe me, I do‚ÄîI wanted to take readers someplace a little different. Tsarist Russia gave me a different point of departure.\\" Publication Bardugo progressed through the steps of querying agents to accepting representation to being offered a three-book deal in an unusually quick 37 days. The Grisha series went to auction on December 1, 2010 and was sold to Henry Holt and Co./Macmillan on December 3, 2010. Shadow and Bone, the first book in the trilogy, was published in June 2012. Sequels and related works Book 2 in the trilogy, Siege and Storm, was published in June 2013. The final book in the trilogy, Ruin and Rising, was published in June 2014. The Six of Crows (2015) and Crooked Kingdom (2016) duology are set in Grishaverse, as is a standalone collection of stories, The Language of Thorns. King of Scars, a new story set in the same world as the Grisha trilogy, was published in 2019 and features characters from both the original trilogy and Six of Crows. According to NPR, \\"Specifically, it is about Nikolai Lantsov, king of Ravka, former soldier, former pirate and privateer (known occasionally as Sturmhond), former bright star of Bardugo's other books.\\" Adaptations In September 2012, Holly Bario, president of DreamWorks‚Äô production, announced that he had picked up the movie rights to Shadow and Bone. David Heyman, who produced the Harry Potter films, was announced as producer. Jeffrey Clifford, president of his Heymaker Films, would also produce the film. In January 2019, Netflix ordered an eight-episode series based on the Grisha Trilogy and the Six of Crows duology with Eric Heisserer as showrunner. Production began in October 2019 with Jessie Mei Li as Alina Starkov, Ben Barnes as General Kirigan (The Darkling), Archie Renaux as Malyen Oretsev, Sujaya Dasgupta as Zoya Nazyalensky, Daisy Head as Genya Safin, and Simon Sears as Ivan.

She is of the Quarian alien race. Within the series, she is a skilled technician and the daughter of Rael'Zorah, a member of the quarian judicial review Admiralty Board. Ash \\"Liz\\" Sroka voices Tali in each of her appearances. Outside of the trilogy, Tali appears in Mass Effect: Homeworlds, a comic series with individual issues on each of several Mass Effect 3 squadmates. Tali was initially the only quarian in the series. In the sequels, more extreme variations of her design were discarded in favor of revisions on her previous look. The Mass Effect 3 development team considered her removal from the squad, but ultimately chose to include her due to staff interest. The team also debated whether to reveal her masked face. Tali has been received positively, with placements on several \\"top character\\" lists, and is one of the more popular characters in the series. Her unveiled face was a popular online discussion topic, and was criticized after its reveal for its stock photo origins. Various merchandise for the character, as with other of the series' squadmates, has been released. Character overview Tali is a quarian, one of a nomadic alien race driven from their homeworld, Rannoch, by a race of software-based intelligences which they created, the geth. As a quarian, Tali must wear a full-body environmental suit due to her race's weaker immune systems, which also has the effect of hiding her physical appearance and facial features. Tali is first introduced on her Pilgrimage, a quarian rite where young adults leave to obtain a gift for a captain so as to be allowed to join their crew. Having completed this after the first game, her design in Mass Effect 2 and 3 reflects her new maturity.Mass Effect 2: Collector's Edition Art Book. In both Mass Effect 2 and Mass Effect 3, Tali's default appearance can be changed to various alternate outfits; Mass Effect 2 unlocks one outfit by completing her loyalty mission while another requires buying the \\"Alternate Appearance Pack 2\\", and Mass Effect 3 offers one alternate from the start and unlocks another by buying the From Ashes DLC. She is a skilled technician and engineer, and renowned in the quarian Migrant Fleet, the spaceship collective home to the race. She has additional pressure to excel as the daughter of Admiral Rael'Zorah, though the Admiralty position is not technically hereditary. Her father was also strict and had high expectations, and tried to set an example for the rest of the fleet; this made him distant and saddened Tali. Thanks to her father, she also received some of the best military training available on the fleet. Tali is very loyal to the fleet, and her voice actress Liz Sroka describes her as willing to sacrifice her life for it. Sroka uses an accent described as \\"unidentifiable pseudo- Eastern European, quarian Gypsy\\" to voice the character. Sroka described her as being \\"grounded in her beliefs\\" but also having a certain \\"humility\\" to her. Sroka also underlined her vulnerability, which she felt was one of the character's strengths. She described the possible romance with player- character Commander Shepard as her \\"sexual awakening\\", which she also felt helped demonstrate the character's vulnerability. Tali's name changes over the course of the series. Her birth ship was the Rayya, as evidenced by her full name, Tali'Zorah nar Rayya, in the first game. At the start of Mass Effect 2, she is called Tali'Zorah vas Neema, showing that, having completed her Pilgrimage, she has become part of the crew of the Neema. During her loyalty mission in 2, her name changes to Tali'Zorah vas Normandy, as she officially joins Commander Shepard's Normandy SR-2 crew. Creation and development upright Tali initially served as the only example of a quarian. Initial concept drawings for Tali and the quarians were finished before the geth's, but the final geth design then influenced the quarian look. More extreme designs for her Mass Effect 2 appearance were discarded for a \\"more polished\\" version of her original \\"iconic\\" look instead. Her final new appearance was chosen as it distinguished the character from other quarians introduced in the second game. Tali's Mass Effect 3 redesign proved difficult due to the team's passionate views about her character, though ME3s art director, Derek Watts, felt that most fans had been supportive of the changes to characters' designs. During BioWare's naming meetings, prior to the release of the first game, Tali's name had been \\"Talsi Orah\\", with Orah as the familiar name. However, this was changed for both its connotations of softness, which did not fit with the direction they wanted to take the character, and its awkward pronunciation. New York City actress Ash (\\"Liz\\") Sroka voices Tali throughout the Mass Effect trilogy, her first role in a video game. Sroka auditioned for three different roles: the female Commander Shepard, Tali'Zorah, and one other female character. After initially receiving the role of Tali, she was still unsure of how much material there was. Ginny McSwain gave voice direction, and would generally take two takes‚Äîthe first to use, the second as back-up, and occasionally a third or more if the recording did not fit with what she wanted. Recording sessions would generally last about four hours. Sroka herself is not a gamer, though she says she enjoys the character of Tali and is happy to have landed the role. Like Garrus Vakarian, Tali was not an option for player romantic pursuit in the first game as the developers were unsure whether the alien characters would be emotionally compelling. Tali's romance event tree was added in Mass Effect 2 due to fan demand and her ability to express human emotion. This romance, if pursued in the second game, can be continued in Mass Effect 3. The romance event tree in 2 was written by Patrick Weekes. Mass Effect 2 lead writer Mac Walters commented that \\"[t]he choice should be in 'who' you romance, not so much 'how'\\", with each of the characters having different-natured romances depending on their individual personalities. Each squad member in Mass Effect 2 had music composed for them, intended to convey their character; BioWare gave the composers detailed character studies for each to help. Tali's theme was created by Jimmy Hinson, who had generally made game remixes beforehand. Hinson worked from his home in Tennessee and made his pieces using FL Studio 9. Although they were given full access to the game's content, Hinson chose to avoid looking beyond what he absolutely needed to look at to write the tracks, due to wanting to experience the game fresh upon its release. In addition to Tali, Hinson also wrote tracks for Samara and Grunt, as well as various other tracks in the game. The game artists regularly drafted variations on Tali's face throughout the series' development. BioWare's position on whether to reveal her face was a long- standing internal debate, and the developers announced they were still unsure during Mass Effect 3s development. Concept artist Matt Rhodes felt it would interesting to see how players compared her personality to her appearance, and how they would respond to an appearance that challenged their expectations as \\"a little too alien, just a little too repellant\\". They were aware that either decision would likely annoy some people, and that no reveal could universally fit all views of Tali. BioWare wished to unveil her face in a \\"tasteful way\\" outside of the game engine, and decided that a gift from Tali would be the best way. A stock photo was used to ensure the face's closeness to a real photograph. An in-game photo of Tali's face is available as a gift to the player-character Commander Shepard upon pursuing her Mass Effect 3 romance event tree. BioWare considered not making Tali a squadmate in Mass Effect 3. Some writers, such as Weekes, felt passionately about her inclusion, which led the team to believe that the players could share his passion. Preston Watamaniuk, lead designer for the Mass Effect series, found Tali's death in 3 was the toughest for him to plan, though felt it needed to be possible due to the option of wiping out the quarians. Appearances=Mass Effect= The first game of the trilogy, 2007's Mass Effect, marks Tali's first appearance. Whilst on her Pilgrimage, Tali discovers that a rogue Spectre (elite agent of the galaxy's central government), Saren, is working with the geth and has attacked Eden Prime, humanity's first space colony. She arranges for a meeting to trade with the Shadow Broker, but is betrayed by its organizer, the thug Fist, who pretends to organize a meeting but instead has sent her into an ambush. Commander Shepard, the player-character, rescues her. Tali gives the evidence to the Commander, and Saren consequently loses his Spectre status. Shepard is then sent to hunt down Saren, and Tali joins the player-character's squad. Tali can join the player-character on missions and is available for personal conversation aboard Shepard's spaceship, the Normandy. Onboard the Normandy, Tali is initially excited to be there, intrigued by the advanced technology used to power the Normandy, and stays in the engine room as a result. The next time Shepard speaks to her, though, Tali now seems saddened and withdrawn. She tells Shepard that she's losing sleep since the Normandy 's engines run so quietly compared to ships in her home flotilla, where quiet ships indicate a bad engine or a malfunctioning air filter, plus the ship, due to how it's spread out, seems emptier. This results in Tali feeling slightly homesick and she ponders if the true purpose of the Pilgrimage is to remind her people of what they still have. The next time Shepard speaks to her, Tali's spirits are back up, having adjusted to living on the Normandy, plus how the crew has been treating her like one of their own, especially Shepard. She thanks Shepard for this, saying that Quarians are treated as second-class citizens by other races and Shepard is the first to treat her as an equal. If the player completes a particular side-mission involving the geth and then speak to Tali afterward, she will ask if she can have a copy of the geth data that Shepard recovered, explaining that it is exactly what she needs to complete her Pilgrimage. If the player allows her to have a copy, Tali is overly happy, promising to pay back Shepard by helping them defeat Saren. If the player declines, Tali will still promise to stay to fight Saren, but will then leave afterward so she can finish her Pilgrimage. =Mass Effect 2= Tali returns in the 2010 sequel, during the game's second mission on the human colony world Freedom's Progress, leading a group of quarians in search of a quarian named Veetor, who is on his own Pilgrimage. The colony has been attacked by the \\"Collectors,\\" its human colonists abducted, and Tali agrees to work with Shepard in order to help search for Veetor, over the objections of her team. The quarian team rush to Veetor's location only to be defeated by mechanical guards that have been reprogrammed to shoot on sight by the fearful Veetor; Shepard's squad arrives too late to save all of the quarians, but they manage to eliminate the guards and calm Veetor. After learning what Veetor witnessed during the attack, Shepard can either send Veetor back to the Migrant Fleet with Tali to be treated for his trauma, or to hand the quarian over to Cerberus, Shepard's employers, for further questioning about the Collectors. Tali later appears on the planet Haestrom, a former quarian colony, where Shepard is sent to recruit her. She and a team of quarian soldiers were sent to investigate a star aging faster than usual and are under attack by a geth patrol that spotted their activity. After Shepard eliminates the attacking geth and meets her in the bunker in which she had been trapped with her equipment, Tali departs with Shepard on the mission to investigate and stop the Collectors, receiving permission from the Admiralty Board after the fact. Tali's \\"loyalty mission,\\" an optional mission that reveals more of a squad member's past which is meant to increase loyalty, puts her on trial before the Admiralty Board, facing possible exile for bringing active geth parts to the Flotilla, a charge she denies. Tali admits to Shepard that she did send her father inert geth components to develop more effective weapons, but asserts that they could not spontaneously activate. When the Normandy crew arrives on the vessel hosting the trial, Tali is referred to as \\"Tali'Zorah vas Normandy,\\" an unexpected revelation that she has been formally reassigned without any notice; this development means that Shepard, as Tali's captain, will represent her in trial. The admirals reveal during the trial that geth have taken over a ship, the Alerei, and that Tali's father was on the ship when the geth took over and he is presumed dead. Given the evidence supporting the grave accusations, Tali has the option to board the Alerei to search for evidence of her innocence and to clear the geth infestation; on board the Alerei, Tali and Shepard discover her Rael'Zorah's remains and logs documenting his experiments on the geth, reactivating and assembling the components Tali sent him, and that he is to blame for the attack. Tali asks Shepard not to reveal the information they discover, as it would disgrace his otherwise good name. At the trial, the player chooses whether Shepard withholds the new evidence (Tali is exiled with Rael'Zorah's good name intact), submits it (Tali is innocent at the cost of her father's reputation), or incites the crowd to show popular support for Tali and her previous service record (Tali is found innocent without disgracing her father). Tali can die during the final mission of the game‚Äîthe \\"Suicide Mission\\"‚Äîdepending on the player's choices. Her chances of dying increase if the player submits the evidence against her will, or does not complete her loyalty mission. =Mass Effect 3= Unless the player imports a Mass Effect 2 saved game where Tali cannot appear in Mass Effect 3, Tali shows when the Commander moves to recruit the quarian fleet in the fight against the Reapers, powerful sapient cyborgs with intentions to destroy all life. Tali joins the squad, and her conversation options tell of the quarians' new attack on the now Reaper-allied geth, in a bid by the quarians to try and reclaim their homeworld. Depending on the player's choices in the second game, Tali may either be an Admiral or merely an advisor on how to defeat the geth. Eventually, the player must choose between saving the geth or the quarians, or, if certain conditions are fulfilled, negotiating a stand-down and saving both parties. If the player sides with the geth and lets the quarians die, Tali kills herself; otherwise, she fully joins the squad and can be found interacting with other Normandy crew members. Admiral Shala'Raan vas Tonbay fulfills Tali's role in saved games where Tali cannot appear in-game. Shala'Raan does not join Shepard's squad. The downloadable add-on Citadel adds a number of character moments for Tali, including (depending on dialogue and event choices or whether Shepard is in a romance with her) revealing her love of romantic movies, her talent for singing and doing impressions of the Normandy, and the fact she cannot hold her liquor very well. =Mass Effect: Homeworlds= The second issue of the comic Homeworlds was revealed to focus around Tali's past. Released on May 30, 2012, the issue tells of the beginning of her Pilgrimage, and the events leading up to her appearance in the first game. Originally intending to take the quarian ship Honorata to the planet Illium, along with Keenah'Breizh, in search of valuable items, they discover geth activity on an unidentified ice planet. Tali extracts the memory core from one of the geth, and discovers a recording of a conversation between Saren and Matriarch Benezia discussing the attack on Eden Prime. Once they arrive at Illium, the crew is attacked a group of mercenaries including Commander Jacobus, hired by Saren, leaving Tali and Keenah the only survivors. The two stowaway on a ship to the Citadel, though are uncovered and turned over to C-Sec once they arrive. Though they try to tell of the evidence they have found, they are ignored and told to leave the Citadel. Later, they are suddenly attacked by Jacobus, injuring Tali and mortally wounding Keenah. After being chased through the Citadel, Tali eventually traps Jacobus in an incinerator, killing him, though Keenah collapses and dies. Tali then arrives at Dr. Michel's clinic, who treats her wounds. She is told to go to the bar Chora's Den by Barla Von, and put into contact with the Shadow Broker, setting the stage for her entry into the first Mass Effect game. Reception Tali has received a positive critical response. Writing for UGO, Evan Saathoff listed Tali as his fourth best video game companion, comparing her as the \\"innocent, girl next door experience\\" to the sexiness of Halo's Cortana. GamesRadar's Carolyn Gudmundson listed Tali as one of several video game characters she'd \\"go gay for\\", noting her \\"kind personality and air of mystery\\", as well as her technical genius and accent. Upon hearing news for a potential Mass Effect film, Dan Ryckert of Game Informer looked at the different characters and felt Famke Janssen would be best suited to play the role of Tali‚Äîdue to having a similar body to the character and having played Xenia Onatopp, a Russian-accented soldier, in the 1995 Bond film GoldenEye. Within the trilogy, Tali is one of the most popular characters, with various sources describing her as a fan favorite. Steven Hopper, writing for IGN, listed her as his second favorite Mass Effect teammate after Garrus Vakarian, praising her \\"endearing geekiness\\" and the story that follows her. Similarly, UGO's Sal Basile listed her as the fourth best squadmate in Mass Effect 3, giving credit to her in-game abilities. Kate Gray from Kotaku was shocked and horrified by Tali's sudden death as an unforeseen consequence of her decision making during her initial Mass Effect 3 playthrough, which made her realized that for her, Tali had changed over the course of the trilogy \\"from a voiced collection of tech skills into a person whose input and companionship I valued... not, at least, until it was too late\\". Kirk Hamilton, of Kotaku, also felt her one-on-one dialogue scene in the Citadel DLC was the best out of all the squadmates'. A reader's poll published by IGN in December 2014 for their top ultimate RPG party choices placed Tali at #20 under the reserves section. Another reader's poll published by PC Gamer in 2015 reveal that Tali was the third most popular love interest for Shepard, and was overall the second most popular Mass Effect character. A poll of series fans held for the 2016 edition of Guinness World Records: Gamer's Edition showed that Tali was the second most popular romantic choice among respondents, with 28% of the vote, just behind Liara T'Soni at 29% of the vote.\\"Guinness World Records 2016: Gamer's Edition.\\" Guinness World Records. September 2014. Page 95. In a 2016 article, PC Gamer ranked Tali the sixth best companion of the Mass Effect series. PC Gamer staff praised the character's story arc which spans across the entire trilogy, and \\"her personal conflict with Legion is a genuinely tense balancing act, and Tali's loyalty mission deepens your understanding of the geth/quarian conflict and the quarian customs\\". The first person named after a Mass Effect character, Tali'Zorah, was born on 7 January 2014. Her parents are fans of the Mass Effect series. Nevertheless, PC Gamer's Andy Kelly listed the character as one BioWare character he hated, expressing confusion at her popularity and calling her \\"One of the dullest characters in BioWare history.\\" =Tali's face= Tali's face, as depicted in a photo in Mass Effect 3. The image was criticized for its stock photo origins. Tali's unmasked face and its potential appearance have been subject to discussion by both critics and fans. Video game developer for BioWare Casey Hudson, in an interview, acknowledged depictions of Tali's face as the most common fan art. Jordan Boughman, writing for GamesRadar, highlighted a piece of fan art that he enjoyed and which a BioWare developer had retweeted. Before the face was revealed, IGN's Scott Nichols ran an article about the possibility of revealing the face, concluding that fans did not just want to see her face but also \\"the expressions it can make, adding yet another level of emotional depth and complexity to a fan favorite character\\". GamesRadar's Mikel Reparaz listed it as one of the 12 gaming mysteries he wanted solved in 2011, and hoped that it would be something unusual-looking; this sentiment was echoed by fellow GamesRadar writer Tyler Nagata, who felt that the face should be ugly. PC Gamer's Tom Francis also included the face in their list of 15 things he wanted to see in Mass Effect 3. Once the face was revealed, it was met with wide criticism from fans, particularly for being a stock photo (of Miss England model Hammasa Kohistani). GameZone's Matt Liebl felt that the issue was not as big as fans had made it out to be. Some fans proceeded to make their own faces, such as a piece by deviantArt artist \\"K4ll0\\" that Kotaku's Luke Plunkett compared favorably to the actual face. Promotion and merchandise Like other characters in the trilogy, Tali has been subject to various merchandise. DC Direct included Tali their first line of Mass Effect 2 squadmate figures, first revealed in January 2010 and then released in April 2011. A second figure was announced during Comic-Con 2012, as part of Square Enix's second line of Play Arts Kai Mass Effect figures (along with the female Shepard). BioWare also officially endorsed an originally fan-made plushie of the character, selling it on their online store. Dark Horse's Mass Effect playing cards feature Tali as the Queen of Hearts, alongside other Mass Effect 2 characters in other roles.

According to Latvian folk epics and omens, lietuvƒìns is the soul of a murdered (strangled, drowned or hanged) person cursed to live in this world as long as it has been meant to live. By some beliefs, it is the soul of an unbaptized child. It attacks both people and domestic animals. Sleep paralysis is thought to be torture or strangling by a lietuvƒìns. When under attack, one must move the toe of the left foot to get rid of the attacker. It is also said that lietuvƒìns is able to penetrate into houses, even through keyholes and, aside from nightmares, can strangle the victim.  Appearance  In Latvian folk culture, lietuvƒìns is usually described as a labored wretched child. It is small in height, moves fast, and comes at noon or night. Sometimes, but rarely, it turns into ugly vicious women reminiscent of a witch. It always leaves through the same place: where it entered. Commonly it‚Äôs some hole or crack in the wall; also it can be a keyhole or slot in the door. Moreover, old omens also say that lietuvƒìns rides and strangles sleeping people or domestic animals (cases about horses and cows are described in folklore more often). A victim rapidly gets tired, loses strength, and gets covered in sweat because of such tortures. Absolutely weakened, sometimes the victim is able to see just a bit of lietuvƒìns and feel that it is lying on top with all its weight and doesn‚Äôt give any opportunity to move or run away. It becomes harder to breath and eventually lietuvƒìns leaves, leaving his victim on the verge of death. However, in Latvian folklore, it is mentioned that lietuvƒìns doesn‚Äôt torture animals and people who were born in the daytime.  Methods of protection  According to folk traditions, there are some methods to get rid of lietuvƒìns. = Lietuvƒìns's cross = Double and simple lietuvƒìns‚Äô cross In the fight against lietuvƒìns the most important role is played by so-called lietuvƒìns‚Äô cross (Latvian: lietuvƒìna krusts) that can be two types - simple and double. Simple looks like a five-pointed star (pentagram) and double or big cross looks like two pentagrams put together (in Latvia it can be also named auseklis). Particularly auseklis symbolizes the morning star, the victory of light in the battle against darkness. Lietuvƒìns‚Äô cross in general stands for safety, protects against ghosts and, especially, lietuvƒìns, but auseklis is considered to be the strongest variant of the lietuvƒìns‚Äô cross. Such crosses can be often seen on doors, thresholds, windows and other things. It can be drawn also on cows‚Äô and horses‚Äô hoofs, and even people, who suffer from lietuvƒìns, draw lietuvƒìns‚Äô cross on their nails. Very significant thing about this method is that lietuvƒìns‚Äô cross has to be drawn in one step, otherwise it won‚Äôt work and lietuvƒìns can come even in the house, where this cross is drawn. Also, correctly drawn lietuvƒìns‚Äô cross works until the person, who did it, doesn‚Äôt erase it. = Fix the hole where lietuvƒìns comes from = The hole, crack or keyhole, which is entrance for lietuvƒìns, has to be fixed with a piece of mottled wood. It should be cut with left hand and brought to the house with a thick part first. Everything has to be done at night when a lietuvƒìns has already come in. Without finding an exit, the creature often turns into a beautiful young woman and stays in the house while the exit is closed. But just as it opens, the lady immediately escapes. = Move a toe = When under attack, a person must move the pinky or big toe of the left foot to get rid of the lietuvƒìns. It instantly runs away. = Find lietuvƒìns‚Äô body and bury with honors = If lietuvƒìns‚Äô bones are buried in the cemetery with honors, then its soul won‚Äôt ever bother anyone else again. In the moment of burying, a thunderstorm rises and lightning strikes, so it means that the poor lost soul is taken to another world.  Protection of farm animals  The best protection is lietuvƒìns‚Äô cross, but there also exist other ways how to get rid of this creature. Farm animals can be protected from lietuvƒìns with a knife, comb, or scythe attached to their back. In that case, lietuvƒìns can be hurt by blades or sharp objects. The creature also might be caught in a moment of confusion, but only behind the animal‚Äôs left ear. In that moment, it is suggested to hit him with a rowan stick, so it will run away and won‚Äôt come back. For lietuvƒìns it could be hard to get the animal if its back is oiled. It will be greasy, so the creature won‚Äôt be able to ride an animal. As well as by some reasons lietuvƒìns tries to avoid animals with a cut right ear.

Tests performed at the hospital revealed significantly elevated white blood counts, however neither Erin nor her parents were aware of these blood test results until after her death. Erin's father, Dr. Carl Flatley, DDS, MSD, a retired endodontist from Dunedin, Florida, researched the causes of sepsis in the months that followed his daughter's death, later noting with frustration that he had lost his daughter to \\"something he had never even heard of.\\" In 2003, he founded the Sepsis Alliance in order to change clinical practice in the United States by educating doctors and emergency room workers about sepsis. > \\"You don't want to panic people. We all get infections and, thank God, most > of them heal,\\" he says. \\"So this is what I tell people: If you're feeling > bad all over and have a high temperature and either high or low blood > pressure, those are all indications that your whole system has been > infected. It could be sepsis.\\" Funding Sepsis Alliance is a patient advocacy non-profit organization funded by contributions from individual donors, corporations, and foundations. In addition to these major sources of funding, Sepsis Alliance is a named beneficiary from several annual fundraisers, and also generates income from sepsis-related materials. Sepsis awareness In 2010, Sepsis Alliance commissioned its first public survey, designed to gauge public perception of sepsis. Prepared by Harris Interactive, the survey asked 1,004 adults whether they were familiar with sepsis. According to the survey, 66% of respondents had never even heard of sepsis. Among those who had heard of sepsis, 35% did not know what sepsis was, while 55% thought that sepsis was a type of infection. Thomas Heymann, President of Sepsis Alliance, noted, \\"The fact that only one-third of respondents had even heard of sepsis, let alone understood what it was, reinforces the urgent need for increased public awareness of sepsis.\\" Awareness is increasing slowly, as seen in annual surveys. The 2013 survey, also prepared by Harris Interactive, found that only 44% of adult Americans had heard of sepsis. Among over 2,500 U.S. adults, younger Americans were significantly less likely to have heard the term \\"sepsis,\\" with 57% of U.S. adults ages 18‚Äì34 indicating that they had never heard of it, (compared to 47% of those age 35‚Äì44, 39% of those age 45‚Äì54 and 36 percent of older Americans aged 55+). In addition, women were much more likely to have of sepsis, with 49% of women saying they have, compared to 38% of men confirming they had heard the term. The 2015 survey revealed similar findings. The survey found that American adults were more familiar with rarer illnesses than sepsis. For example, 86% reported knowing about Ebola, 74% knowing about ALS, and 76% knowing about malaria, while only 47% of Americans were as aware about sepsis. Results of the 2016 survey noted that about half of Americans had heard of sepsis. In 2018, sepsis awareness rose to 65%. The 2018 survey, conducted by Radius Global Market Research, revealed that awareness of sepsis rose to a new high with 65% of adults in the U.S. reporting they have heard the term sepsis. However, while the word sepsis is more well known, the survey also demonstrated that awareness of sepsis symptoms is still low; 36% of respondents said they did not know the symptoms and only 12% could correctly identify four common sepsis symptoms. In 2017, Sepsis Alliance commissioned a survey to assess parent knowledge of sepsis in relation to their children. The survey, also conducted by Radius Global Market Research, found that while 77% of parents surveyed were familiar with the word sepsis, only 28% could identify the common signs of pediatric sepsis. While as many as 92% of pediatric sepsis cases begin in the community, 41% of parents believed that their children could only develop sepsis while hospitalized. On July 26, 2011, Rachael Ray featured a segment called \\"What Is Sepsis\\". The segment featured Dr. Flatley and Dr. James O'Brien, an intensive care unit (ICU) doctor and Director at Sepsis Alliance. In a pre-taped segment, Dr. O'Brien introduced viewers to Jennifer Ludwin, a survivor of H1N1 influenza. Ludwin's legs and most of her fingers were amputated due to complications from sepsis. Ludwin, a graduate student at the time at The Ohio State University, went on to become a speaker on H1N1 and sepsis, even appearing in her own TEDxTalk in April, 2012. In 2016, Sepsis Alliance partnered with The Michigan Health & Hospital Association's Keystone Center to raise awareness about sepsis across the state through a series of events. Sepsis Awareness Month In 2011, Sepsis Alliance launched Sepsis Awareness Month. Sepsis Awareness Month is promoted every September through social media, and online and traditional media. Supporters are encouraged to participate in awareness activities, such as photo challenges, slogan contests, wearing red and black ribbons, and distributing sepsis awareness materials. The Know Sepsis tagline is also promoted among healthcare professionals, and facilities are encouraged to promote sepsis awareness through workshops, lectures, and special events. It's About TIME campaign In the spring of 2018, Sepsis Alliance launched a broad-based national campaign to raise awareness of sepsis as a medical emergency. The campaign centered around the acronym T-I-M-E which stands for: * _T_ emperature: higher or lower than normal * _I_ nfection: patient may have signs and symptoms of an infection * _M_ ental decline: patient may be confused, sleepy, difficult to rouse * _E_ xtremely ill: patient may express feelings of severe pain or discomfort, with statements like \\"I feel like I might die.\\" Angelica Hale, a finalist in the reality television program \\"America's Got Talent,\\" was recruited as the spokesperson for the campaign. Hale was diagnosed with sepsis at the age of four. World Sepsis Day and Global Sepsis Alliance Sepsis Alliance was one of the original founding members of the Global Sepsis Alliance (GSA), which supports the efforts of caregivers as they seek to better understand and combat sepsis. Sepsis Alliance and other members of the GSA hosted the Merinoff Symposium on September 29, 2010, bringing together global experts on sepsis to help create a public definition of sepsis, a molecular definition of sepsis, and a global call to action to recognize sepsis as a medical emergency. GSA and its member organizations launched the first global World Sepsis Day on September 13, 2012 and it continues to be celebrated on that day annually around the world. Hospitals and healthcare organizations, such as Cookeville Regional Medical Center in Tennessee and Via Christi Pittsburg medical center in Kansas, have used this day to showcase their efforts in sepsis detection and prevention. In the U.S., Sepsis Alliance marked the occasion by hosting its first-ever Sepsis Heroes event, designed to recognize sepsis survivors, doctors, and healthcare providers that have helped raised awareness of sepsis in the community. Held in New York City, Sepsis Heroes was one of the first Sepsis Alliance-produced events to bring both survivors and healthcare professionals in one location. Earlier recipients of the Sepsis Heroes awards included Jen Ludwin, the North Shore-LIJ Health System, and the founders of two local fundraisers dedicated to raising funds and awareness of sepsis. Previous Sepsis Heroes events have honored Gary Black, New York State Governor Andrew M. Cuomo, GE Healthcare Education Services, David Goldhill, Mark Lambert, and the Surviving Sepsis Campaign.

The film played at the 2013 SXSW Film Festival and was released in theaters May 3, 2013. The filming locations were New York, NY and New Fairfield, CT. Plot Paolo, a screenwriter staying in Connecticut to write a screenplay, meets and falls in love with Djuna (Jos√©phine de La Baume), only to discover that she is a vampire who survives by consuming the blood of animals. She confesses to him, but he refuses to believe her, so she requests for him to chain her up so she can prove it to him. Revealed in her true form, Paolo is unafraid. He releases the chains that bind her and joins her, receiving her \\"kiss of death\\" and is turned into a vampire. The two continue to live in Djuna's large summer house which is actually owned by Xenia (Anna Mouglalis), a leader in the vampire community and theatre actress. It is a half-way house of sorts for vampires in Xenia's community. Their happy life together is disturbed by the arrival of Mimi (Roxane Mesquida), Djuna's out-of-control and less morally sound sister who has come to live at the house after she killed a man in Amsterdam. Mimi claims she only plans on staying a week and proceeds to generate chaos in their lives. She feeds on human after human, forbidden in their community, seduces Paolo, and offers Xenia a virgin - Anne (Riley Keough), who is a fan of Xenia in the theatre. Irene is the caretaker of the summer house (Ching Valdes-Aran). Her family has been caretakers for generations due to a unique blood disorder that makes their blood undesirable to vampires. She overhears Djuna telling Xenia that her sister Mimi has been attacking humans, although Xenia tries to deny it. Mimi is seen recklessly driving her car towards the house, loses control, and crashes. After a small time skip, it is evident dawn is approaching while Mimi is still strapped in the car. She wakes up and races to the house, only to fall short within sight but already burning from the sun. She sees Irene and begs her to help, but Irene ignores her desperate plea and, instead, pulls a cigarette out and lights it from Mimi before smoking it. Next, Paolo and Djuna are preparing to leave the summer house. Paolo is saying how they're set to go stay with their friends in Italy. As they leave the house, a black trash bag near the entrance tips over. Djuna, Paolo, and Irene look back at it, find nothing of interest, and continue on their way.

It began in 1974, when Allis-Chalmers's construction equipment business was reorganized into a joint venture with Fiat SpA,.. which bought a 65% majority stake at the outset. Allis-Chalmers's construction equipment business was often not profitable during the 1950s and 1960s. It faced stiff competition from companies such as Caterpillar, Case, Euclid, John Deere, Fiat MMT, and others. The 1974 formation of a new company, Fiat-Allis, was essentially a divestment. Over the next decade, Fiat continued to invest in Fiat-Allis, more so than Allis-Chalmers did. The two parent firms disagreed on decisions made at, and about, Fiat-Allis. In 1985, the joint venture ended. Fiat bought out Allis's remaining minority stake (which had shrunk from its original 35%). Fiat renamed the company Fiatallis.. trackhoe Cooperation with Hitachi yielded Fiat-Hitachi branding for some years. Fiatallis was eventually sold to CNH, of which Fiat is a major stockholder. CNH retired the Fiatallis brand and merged the company's assets with others from Case and New Holland Machine Company.

It consists of multiple symbols representing liberty and sovereignty on a bleu celeste shield. According to government specifications, the coat of arms should be depicted without the shield only when on the flag, but the version lacking the shield is often used counter to these regulations. History In 1871, for the 50th anniversary of Guatemala gaining independence, president Miguel Garc√≠a Granados asked the mint to produce a design to commemorate the event. The Swiss engraver Juan Bautista Frener designed the shield, and Granados decided to adopt it as the national coat of arms, abandoning the previous coat of arms which had conservative symbolism. In Executive Decree No. 33 of 18 November, the coat of arms was described: > The arms of the republic will be: a shield with two rifles and two swords > crossed with a wreath of laurel on a field of light blue. The middle will > harbor a scroll of parchment with the words \\"Liberty 15 of September of > 1821\\" in gold and in the upper part a Quetzal as the symbol of national > independence and autonomy. The flag and coat of arms were further regulated in detail in a 12 September 1968 decree by the government of president Julio C√©sar M√©ndez Montenegro, specifying the elements, colors, and the specific shade of blue on the shield. Symbolism The elements of the coat of arms have the following symbolism: *The Quetzal is the national bird of Guatemala, and represents freedom and independence of the nation. *The crossed Remington rifles are the type used during the 1871 Liberal Revolution, and represent the will to defend Guatemala's interests. *The crossed swords represent justice and honor. *The laurel wreath represents victory. *The parchment at the center reads \\"Liberty 15 of September of 1821\\", the date Guatemala gained independence from Spain.

It was released on March 26, 2013. The album was recorded over a ten-year period at the band's studio \\"ST Studio\\", while additional recording took place at Interscope Studios, Stall #2 and Titan Studio. 13 is Suicidal Tendencies' first album containing original material since 2000's Free Your Soul and Save My Mind, although they had re-recorded their older material and released a handful of new songs on Friends & Family, Vol. 2 (2001), Year of the Cycos (2008) and No Mercy Fool!/The Suicidal Family (2010). 13 is also the band's only studio album with guitarist Nico Santora, bassist Stephen Bruner and drummer Eric Moore, and features five of Suicidal Tendencies' former members (Mike Clark, Ron Brunner, Dave Hildago, Josh Paul and Tim \\"Rawbiz\\" Williams), who are credited as \\"additional musicians\\". Background and recording Since at least 2002, there had been speculation of a Suicidal Tendencies album featuring all-new original material, with extensive reports that many tracks had been recorded with longtime producer Paul Northfield, known for his work with progressive metal bands like Dream Theater, Queensr√øche and Rush. On September 11, 2002, Muir posted a message on the band's official website, stating that they would be in the studio \\"working on new ST songs\\", although he said the band was already in the studio before their European tour and were \\"really happy with the results\\". He also mentioned that the band would \\"record some new songs\\" before he would \\"go leave town on a business trip\\" and was hoping for an early 2003 release. In January 2003, it was reported that Suicidal Tendencies were set to enter the studio later in the month to begin work on the album. The band explained, \\"We've got a number of meetings and people coming from all over. We'll leave it at that for now. However, by the end of the month we should have a good idea as to how we plan on proceeding, and what we hope to accomplish musically and individually in the coming year. When decisions are made, we'll let you know.\\" On October 10, 2003, Suicidal Tendencies mentioned on their official website that the band would be releasing \\"at least one, and possible two ST CDs\\" in 2004. On October 21, 2004, Suicidal Tendencies announced on their official website that they were still working on the new album and stated that this had \\"been a major highlight, proud spot and focal point for the band in terms of creativity and ability to move forward with its various musical and visual projects.\\" The band also stated that they were working producer Paul Northfield on both the Suicidal album and new Infectious Grooves album. Later that month, the band issued the following statement in an effort to clear up possible misunderstandings with regards to their new project Return to Venice and the Suicidal Tendencies album. The band explained, \\"Return to Venice will be released before the real new Suicidal Tendencies album.\\" Because of Mike Muir's back status, the band decided to release the compilation first. Obviously this album will have different artwork than the \\"new-cover-photo- idea\\", which has just been sent out to the guy who's gonna finalize the cover concept. Also, Return to Venice will feature a compilation of bands attached to Suicidal Records and/or Venice and will contain no re-recordings of the classic 1985 Welcome to Venice.\\" On January 16, 2006, Muir posted an update on the band's official website that Suicidal Tendencies had returned to the studio again to begin work on the album, stating that Northfield had \\"flown back into town\\" and work had \\"started on the new Suicidal Tendencies CD\\". He also stated that the band would be \\"sorting, working on and finishing up all the projects\\" that the band hoped \\"to released in the next year...of course starting with the new Suicidal Tendencies CD\\" and wouldn't \\"be rushing back to do any shows or making any touring plans 'till after\\" the album would be completed. On March 3, 2006, Suicidal Tendencies posted the following update on the new album on their official website: Asked in February 2008 when the new album was expected to be released, Muir replied: In February 2010, Mike Muir had noted that the new Suicidal Tendencies album would be released in late 2010, although this release date had already passed and at the band's performance at the FunFunFun Fest lineup at Waterloo Park in Austin, TX on November 7, 2010, he informed the crowd that a new album would be released in 2011. However, in May 2011, Muir told KillYourStereo.com that the new album would likely be released in 2012 as he was working on a Cyco Miko album in October, which would have a \\"taste of new Suicidal, old unreleased Suicidal, new Infectious Grooves, old Infectious Grooves and a bunch of other stuff as well.\\" In November 2011, Mike Muir stated that Suicidal Tendencies had completed three new albums and they were \\"just putting them together in a time frame.\\" On May 31, 2012, rhythm guitarist Mike Clark received a head injury during an incident at their May 31 concert in Santa Cruz, resulting in a concussion that also required nine staples to a gash on his head. Clark was replaced by Nico Santora. On December 5, 2012, Muir told Australia's Tone Deaf that Suicidal Tendencies were tracking drums at Dr. Dre's exclusive Interscope Studio, and recording \\"hundreds and hundreds of tracks\\" that they like. On February 21, 2013, it was reported that Suicidal Tendencies would release their new album, now called 13, on March 26. Title The album's title has various meanings. The album's title is a reference to the fact that it contains 13 songs, and that it is Suicidal Tendencies' first full-length in 13 years. Also, 13 is Suicidal Tendencies' 13th studio release (counting Controlled by Hatred/Feel Like Shit...D√©j√† Vu, Still Cyco After All These Years, Six the Hard Way and No Mercy Fool!/The Suicidal Family) and was released in 2013, the 13th year of the 21st century. It shares the same title as Black Sabbath's 13, which was released three months later, and Megadeth's TH1RT3EN, which was released in 2011. The title is also similar to Anvil's 2007 album This Is Thirteen. The number is also a reference to the alleged gang affiliation of the band, as \\"13\\" is heavily used in California Mexican- American Sure√±o gang culture. Reception Fred Thomas of AllMusic rated the album three-and-a-half stars out of five, and states, \\"Thirty years after their debut, they return with 13, their first album of new material in 13 years and coincidentally their 13th album. Produced by Suicidal frontman Mike Muir, the album includes 13 tracks of the type of petulant, cathartic, thrashy hardcore the band is known for and includes cameos by Larry Linkogle and Jimmy Fitzpatrick of Metal Mulisha as well as a gang of professional skaters adding their voices to the track \\"Show Some Love... Tear It Down.\\"\\" 13 was Suicidal Tendencies' first album since 1994's Suicidal for Life to enter the Billboard 200; however, the album debuted at #187, making it Suicidal Tendencies' lowest chart position at the time.

It was built in 1842 for David Evans whose family had owned the land for some time. History Set on a hillside to provide panoramic views to the southwest over Pembrokeshire, the S-shaped building was erected in 1824 for Dr. Evans. Built out of stone with two storeys, the two hipped end panels frame a flat central- door entrance on the three-panel house. The main door opens to an axial passage which passes numerous living room doors to the large rear kitchen, also enabling access to both main and servants staircases. Considerable alterations were made to the interior in the twentieth century when the house was used as a hotel. The layout resembles that of Scolton Manor which was also designed by local architects William and James Owen. In 1905 the estate was bought by Victor James Higgon, whose wife Catherine Octavia Edwards was the last of the Tucker family to live at Sealyham House. Modern times The Grade II listed entrance lodge The Hall and the associated entrance lodge both became Grade II listed buildings in January 1963. The Hall was for a time converted into a hotel and restaurant in 1979 by executive chef, Derek Stenson and his partner John Neville, the former sous chef at the Dorchester Hotel. Now privately owned, the gardens are often opened to the public under the National Gardens Scheme, with entrance and tea and cake available for a fee donated to charity. Set on a hilltop, the garden offers extensive views and features lawns, broadwalks, pergolas, sculptures, water garden, wild flower meadow, heather garden, gravel garden and stumpery.

Before London  Wess was born in 1861 in Ukmergƒó, Russian Empire (now Lithuania), to a Hasidic baker. At the age of twelve, he was apprenticed to a shoemaker. He also worked as a factory machinist in Dvinsk (now Daugavpils, Latvia). In 1881, Wess immigrated to England to avoid military service.  Activities in London  \\"The Club in Berner Street\\", drawing from the Pictorial News, 6 October 1888. After arriving in London, Wess joined the Hackney branch of the Socialist League and became one of the founders of the International Working Men's Educational Club, which was located at 40 Berner Street (now called Henriques Street) in the East End. He later became its secretary and the overseer in the printing office there. In 1888, he was the first witness called at the inquest into the death of Elizabeth Stride, a hypothesized victim of Jack the Ripper. Wess became heavily involved in the local labour movement and \\"[...] played an important part in the Jewish trade-union movement in Britain. He helped to establish almost all of the Jewish unions in the 1880s and 1890s.\\" In one case, he was the secretary for the strike committee of a group of East London tailors during their strike from 27 August to 2 October 1889. As secretary, he ensured that the strikers and their families had their basic needs fulfilled by obtaining donations from philanthropists and other trade unions, including ¬£100 from the dockers' union. The next year, Wess became the founding secretary of the East London Workers' Unions, later becoming the secretary of the International Tailors, Machinists and Pressers' Trade Union and the United Ladies' Tailors and Mantle Makers' Association. He also helped to set up a Jewish cooperative bakery on Brushfield Street in Spitalfields. In the same year, he began to help in the typesetting of Freedom, an anarchist newspaper started in 1886. He became the manager of the Freedom Press in 1891 and went on speaking tours alongside Pyotr Kropotkin, Errico Malatesta, Louise Michel, and Saul Yanovsky. When Yanovsky left for the United States, he was briefly replaced by Jacob Kaplan as the editor of Arbeyter Fraynd (Worker's Friend), a weekly Yiddish anarchist newspaper. Kaplan, however, was quickly replaced in October 1895 by the more experienced Wess. By the beginning of the 20th century, Wess' participation in the Jewish trade union movement had been reduced. He took up a job as a bookkeeper in a tobacco factory and in 1904, he stayed with Tom Keell, the compositor and new manager of Freedom. In February 1906, Wess and Lilian Wolfe (Keell's partner and another member of the Freedom publishing group), were setting up the Arbeyter Fraynd Club on Jubilee Street, Whitechapel. By June of that year, he and Rudolf Rocker were serving on another tailors' strike committee. Wess spent 1928‚Äì1929 rebuilding the London Freedom Group, only for it to close down in 1931. By the late 30s, Wess had revived it again and had become involved in solidarity work for the Spanish Revolution with Emma Goldman. By 1946, he was still active as a speaker within Jewish radical circles in London, making a speech to commemorate the 55th anniversary of the first publication of the Freie Arbeiter Stimme (Free Worker's Voice or Free Voice of Labor). He died on 23 May of that year at the age of 84 and was cremated at Golders Green Crematorium. In his obituary, he was noted as an atheist, as a number of anarchists were at the time.

French reportedly spent $40,000 and 8 years developing an artificial intelligence program to analyze Susann's works and attempt to create a novel that Susann might have written. A legal dispute between the estate of Jacqueline Susann and the publisher resulted in a settlement to split the profits, and the book was referenced in several legal journal articles about copyright laws. The book had two small print runs totaling 35,000 copies, receiving mixed reviews. Creation The novel's creation spanned the fields of artificial intelligence, expert systems, and natural language processing. Scott French first scanned and analyzed portions of two books by Jacqueline Susann, Valley of the Dolls and Once Is Not Enough, to determine constituents of Susann's writing style, which French stated was the most difficult task. This analysis extracted several hundred components including frequency and type of sexual acts and sentence structure. \\"Once you're there, the writer's style emerges, part of her actual personality comes out, and the computer can be programmed to make a story.\\" French also created several thousand rules to govern tone, plotting, scenes, and characters. The text generated by Hal, the computer, was intended to mimic what Susann might have written, although the output required significant editing. French credits Hal's work with \\"almost 100% of the plot, 100% of the theme and style.\\" French estimates that he wrote 10% of the prose, the computer Hal wrote about 25% of the prose, and the remaining two-thirds was more of a collaboration between the two. A typical scenario to write a scene would involve Hal asking questions that French would answer (for example, Hal might ask about the \\"cattiness factor\\" involved in a meeting between two key female characters, and French would reply with a range of 1 to 10), and the computer would then generate a few sentences to which French would make minor edits. The process would repeat for the next few sentences until the scene was written. Legal issues Jacqueline Susann's publisher was skeptical of the legality of Just This Once. Susann's estate reportedly threatened to sue Scott French but the parties settled out of court; the settlement involved splitting profits between the parties but the terms of the settlement were not disclosed. The publication of Just This Once raised questions in the legal profession concerning how copyright law applies to computer-generated works derived from an analysis of other copyrighted works, and whether the generation of such works infringes on copyright. The publications on this topic suggested that the copyright laws of the time were ill-equipped to deal with computer- generated creative works. Reception The book's publisher Steven Shragis of Carol Group said of the novel, \\"I'm not going to say this is a great literary work, but it's every bit as good as anything out in this field, and better than an awful lot.\\" The novel received some positive early reviews. In USA Today, novelist Thomas Gifford compared Just This Once to another novel in the same genre, American Star by Jackie Collins. Gifford concluded: \\"If you do like this stuff, you'd be much, much better off with the one written by the computer.\\" The Dead Jackie Susann Quarterly declared that Susann \\"would be proud. Lots of money, sleaze, disease, death, oral sex, tragedy and the good girl gone bad.\\" Other reviews were mixed. Publishers Weekly wrote, \\"If the books of Jacqueline Susann and Harold Robbins seem formulaic, this debut novel of sin and success in Las Vegas outdoes them all. And that, in a way, is the point.... All novelty rests in the conceit of computer authorship, not in the story itself.\\" Library Journal stated \\"French invested eight years and $50,000 in a scheme to use artificial intelligence to fulfill his authentic, if dubious, desire to generate a trashy novel a la Jacqueline Susann. Shallow, beautiful-people characters are flatly conceived and randomly accessed in a formulaic plot ... a sexy, boring morality tale. Of possible interest to computer buffs for its use of Expert Systems and the virtual promise of more worthy possibilities; others should read Susann.\\" Kirkus Reviews wrote: \\"The deal here is that author French is not the author, he's just the midwife, having allegedly programmed his computer to write about our times just the way Susann would... almost perfectly capturing glamorous Jackie's turgid but E-Z reading prose style and ultrareliable mix of sex, glitz, dope 'n' despair.... One wonders, though, if French's tale spinning PC will do as well on the talkshows as Jackie did. The computer weenies have been trying to tell us for years, garbage in-garbage out.\\" See also *Procedural generation *The Policeman's Beard is Half Constructed References 1993 American novels American romance novels Novels about artificial intelligence Natural language processing ","title":"Just This Once"},{"id":"38599971","text":"Darreh-ye Pir (, also Romanized as Darreh-ye Pƒ´r and Darreh Pƒ´r; also known as Dar Pƒ´reh) is a village in Dasht-e Zarrin Rural District, in the Central District of Kuhrang County, Chaharmahal and Bakhtiari Province, Iran.

Most vehicles shipped in the U.S. are cars and trucks, but many brokers handle boats, RVs, motorcycles and other types of vehicles as well. Auto transport is classified as \\"specialized freight trucking\\" under NAICS code 484230. Overview An auto transport broker is part of the personal vehicle freight business industry chain. In the U.S., these broker companies must have proper licensing and authority from the FMCSA to be allowed to broker vehicles for customers. The individual or business that needs to move a car or other vehicle is the shipper; the shipper contacts a broker to have their vehicle shipped or transported. Once a broker is booked, the broker's job is to find a carrier, which is the individual or company that actually employs drivers and operates the car transport equipment. Brokers are employed because they have access to freight load boards, where they can post the job and find carriers that have transportation resources in the area. They can also get lower shipping prices by getting competing bids by different carriers. However, brokers and carriers are not always separate entities - a number of auto transport companies handle both brokerage and transport. Statistics The US Department of Transportation keeps statistics on cargo shipments, showing over $651 billion worth of motorized and other vehicles (including parts) moved by truck in 2007. Of that number, $452bn of cargo was moved via for-hire truck. Official statistics about the size of the secondary auto transport market, number of commercial- size car carrier vehicles on the road and number of vehicles shipped aren't kept by the DOT. With the advent of the Internet, the auto transport industry has seen an influx of new brokers, attracted by the low cost of starting a brokerage business online. While this encouraged greater competition and lower costs in the industry, government agencies have also seen a \\"dramatic increase in complaints against auto transporters and auto transport brokers\\" due to Internet fraud. Licensing requirements Auto transport brokers in the USA are subject to government licensing. The candidate must obtain an Operating Authority number from the Federal Motor Carrier Safety Administration by filling out a form on the FMCSA website. There is a small application processing fee. Brokers are also required to obtain a bond. Known as a Freight Broker Bond, it exists to cover losses by the motor carrier, in case the broker commits fraud or other lapses. Prior to 2012, the minimum bond was $10,000, although many brokers chose to obtain higher amounts. 2012 regulations The Moving Ahead for Progress in the 21st Century Act, signed by President Obama on July 6 of 2012, introduced a number of new regulations for auto transport brokers. The chief among them is raising the minimum broker bond from $10,000 to $75,000. The new provision goes in force on October 1, 2013, and has applied to all existing brokers retroactively. The BMC-84 Freight Broker Bond is paid for on an annual basis. The freight broker bond cost is figured as a percentage of the bond amount depending on * Credit of ownership (credit score, age/status of any Public Records) * Years in Business * Financials * Experience Other rules include: * A license status review by the FMCSA every five years; the FMCSA also has the power to revoke a broker's license in case of unethical practices. * A 3-year relevant experience and certified training requirement to obtain a broker license, bringing auto shipping broker qualification requirements in line with the ocean shipping industry. * Tighter regulation of \\"interlining,\\" the practice of freight carriers hiring other carriers to \\"perform all or part of the services the originating carrier is obliged\\" to provide. Now, carriers that contract all or part of the job to other carriers will need to procure separate broker authority from the government. A transport company will also be required to notify its customers what role (carrier, forwarder or broker) it plays at each stage of the transport job, as well as which USDOT body regulates the activity. =Industry Reactions= The Association of Independent Property Brokers & Agents (AIPBA), a property broker trade group that claims 1,400 members, has petitioned and lobbied against higher bond requirements when these have been proposed in the past, and has harshly criticized the new law. The founder & president of AIPBA, James Lamb, has called the law a lobbyist- driven attempt to \\"eliminate small brokers from the market\\" and establish an oligopoly that charges customers more and pays carriers less. The National Association for Minority Truckers (NAfMT) has also come out against the higher bond requirements. NAfMT CEO Kevin Reid called the $75,000 bond an \\"unreasonable barrier to entry for would-be entrepreneurs.\\" He also spoke out against the new restrictions on owner-operators brokering out excess freight. The NAfMT has joined efforts by AIPBA to repeal the stricter surety requirements. Other industry associations have been supportive of the law. The Owner-Operator Independent Drivers Association (OOIDA), a group that represents independent trucking owner-operators, has been a key force behind the new regulations. While the final rules in MAP-21 fell short of the OOIDA's wishes, Todd Spencer, executive vice president of the organization, praised them as a \\"win-win\\" for truckers and legitimate brokers. The Transportation Intermediaries Association (TIA), a major third-party logistics trade organization, has also advocated for the new FMCSA regulations through its lobbying arm TIAPAC as a way to protect motor carriers from both incompetent and unscrupulous brokers. TIA board member Ken Lund acknowledged that the new bond may be difficult for smaller brokers to pay, but defended it as \\"reasonably priced\\" and useful to prevent fraud.

Therefore, it is too dim to be seen with the naked eye. =Orbit= Kepler-37b orbits its parent star at a distance of about 15 million kilometers (9.3 million miles), with a period of roughly 13 days at a distance of 0.1 AU (compared to Mercury's distance from the Sun, which is about 0.38 AU). The outer two planets in the system have orbital periods within one percent of the 8:5 and 3:1 resonances with Kepler-37b's period. Discovery Kepler-37b, along with two other planets, Kepler-37c and Kepler-37d, were discovered by the Kepler space telescope, which observes stellar transits. After observing transits of Kepler-37b, astronomers had to compare it with the size of the parent star. The size of the star was obtained using asteroseismology; Kepler-37 is currently the smallest star to be studied using this process. This allowed the size of Kepler-37b to be determined \\"with extreme accuracy\\". To date, Kepler-37b is the smallest planet discovered around a main-sequence starThe pulsar planet PSR B1257+12 A has a comparable mass. The actual size of PSR B1257+12 A is unknown, but is likely comparable to Kepler-37b. outside the Solar System. Detection of Kepler-37b was possible due to its short orbital period, relative brightness, and low activity of its host star, allowing brightness data to average out quickly. The discovery of Kepler-37b has led Jack Lissauer, a scientist at NASA's Ames Research Center, to conjecture that \\"such little planets are common\\".

Synopsis A unit of new recruits sent to patrol Gaza during the First Intifada in 1989. A washing machine is deliberately pushed from the roof of a building as the patrol moves past, killing one of the soldiers. The perpetrator cannot be found. Four of the young soldiers are assigned to uncomfortable, boring, surveillance duty atop the roof, interacting with the Arab family that lives in the building.

History The Cymreigyddion Society was stated in later accounts to have been founded in 1795,Leathart 1831, p. 26. although a reference to a meeting on 19 November 1794 suggests that it may have assembled informally at a slightly earlier date.Jenkins and Ramage 1951, p. 129. It was established by a group of twelve expatriate Welshmen resident in London, most if not all of whom were members of the existing Gwyneddigion Society (founded 1770), and who included Jac Glan-y-gors (John Jones). At a slightly later date Iolo Morganwg (Edward Williams) was also a member.Jenkins and Ramage 1951, pp. 129‚Äì31. The last record of the Society's existence, when it was clearly barely surviving, is from 1855; and it had disappeared by 1858.Jenkins and Ramage 1951, pp. 135‚Äì6. Activities The Society's Rules appear to have been settled in 1797, printed in 1798, and revised in 1810 and 1827.Jenkins and Ramage 1951, p. 129. Meetings were held regularly on Thursday evenings, and mainly consisted of debates: in the early days, this seems to have been what distinguished the Cymreigyddion from the Gwyneddigion, among whom debating had fallen into abeyance.Jenkins and Ramage 1951, pp. 129‚Äì30. Other activities included a strong social element and the dispensing of charity.Jenkins and Ramage 1951, pp. 131‚Äì2. Proceedings were held in both Welsh and English, and one of the Society's objects was the teaching of English to Welsh newcomers to London.Jones 2001, p. 81.Leathart 1831, p. 29. In its later years it held lectures and organised eisteddfodau, and seems to have acquired a radical political character.Jenkins and Ramage 1951, pp. 132‚Äì3. The Society was (like the Gwyneddigion) anti-Methodist, and revelled in the disgrace of the preacher Edward \\"Ginshop\\" Jones, sued in a breach of promise case in 1801: it published a 24-page booklet containing the texts of Jones's love-letters, which had been read out in court, and a ribald ballad about the affair by Glan-y-gors.Jenkins and Ramage 1951, p. 124. The Cymreigyddion always seems to have been a more \\"democratic\\" body than the Gwyneddigion, and in the early 19th century, as the Gwyneddigion fell into decline, the Cymreigyddion to some extent took over the membership of the older society.Jenkins and Ramage 1951, pp. 127‚Äì8, 130. Legacy The name Cymreigyddion was adopted by several literary and cultural societies in Wales itself in the early part of the 19th century, probably in conscious imitation of the London society.Jenkins and Ramage 1951, pp. 130‚Äì1.

Indian Affairs in Colonial New York; The Seventeenth Century. University of Nebraska Press (1997). pg 80Bailyn, Bernard. The Barbarous Years: The Peopling of British North America: The Conflict of Civilizations, 1600-1675. Alfred A. Knopf (2012). pg 221 A mixed force of 130 Dutch and English soldiers led by Captain John Underhill launched a night attack on the village and destroyed it with fire. 500 to 700 members of the Wappinger Confederacy were killed while the New Netherland force lost one man killed and fifteen wounded. More casualties were suffered in this attack than in any other single incident in the war. Shortly after the battle several local Wappinger Confederacy sachems sued for peace. Background Kieft's War began in 1640 as a result of escalating tensions over land use, livestock control, trade and taxation between the Dutch West India Company colony of New Netherland and neighboring native peoples. In September 1639 Director Willem Kieft decided to levy a tax in pelts, maize or wampum on Indian peoples surrounding New Amsterdam. In May 1640 the Director ordered each of the inhabitants to provide themselves with a gun and organized them under corporals. The conflict began when members of the Raritan tribe attacked a sloop sent to trade with them in the spring of 1640. Several Raritan, Dutch colonists and Dutch livestock were killed on Staten Island in 1640 and 1641. Kieft placed bounties of wampum on the Raritan which bought him the alliance of several Indian groups. These included the Indians of western Long Island as well as the Tankiteke of the Wappinger Confederacy led by their sachem Pachum. The Tankiteke inhabited present-day eastern Westchester County, New York and Fairfield County, Connecticut.Cook, S.F. The Indian Population of New England in the Seventeenth Century. University of California Press (1976). pg 69 The Dutch then came into conflict with the Wecquaesgeek of the Wappinger Confederacy in present-day Westchester County over the murder of a Dutch settler on Manhattan. The Dutch launched an abortive expedition against the Wesquaesgeek in 1642. That year also saw the beginning of armed conflict with the Hackensack tribe of present-day New Jersey with the murder of two Dutch colonists. In February 1643 the Wesquaesgeek were attacked by musket-wielding MohawkSteele, Ian Kenneth. Warpaths: Invasions of North America. Oxford University Press (1994). pg 116 from the vicinity of Fort Orange and sought shelter on Manhattan and in Hackensack territory. On February 25 the Dutch killed between 80 and 120 of the Wesquaesgeek in surprise attacks at Corlaer's Hook in Manhattan and the Pavonia Massacre in Hackensack territory. There was subsequently conflict between the Dutch and Indians of Long Island. Tentative treaties were negotiated with the Hackensack, Wesquaesgeek and Long Island Indians, but the former Tankiteke ally Pachum brought the Wappinger Confederacy into war with the Dutch in August 1643. The Wappinger tribe attacked Dutch ships along the Hudson River beginning with an incident in their territory in present-day Poughkeepsie, New York. Soon other Indian groups rejoined the war and all of the Dutch settlements in present-day Westchester and New Jersey were destroyed or abandoned. The Siwanoy, who lived along the Long Island Sound between Hell Gate and Norwalk, killed 18 settlers including religious dissenter Anne Hutchinson in an attack near present-day New Rochelle.LaPlante, Eve. American Jezebel, the Uncommon Life of Anne Hutchinson, the Woman who Defied the Puritans. (2004). pg 237 The colonial government responded to the Indian attacks by training and arming Dutch and English residents. The Englishman Captain John Underhill, a renowned veteran of the Pequot War of 1637, was recruited from the English New Haven Colony town of Stamford to lead this force. Underhill had co-led the attack in what came to be known as the Mystic massacre. In this engagement the New England forces surrounded a Pequot village and set it on fire, killing between 400 and 700 inhabitants. The colonial government also appealed to the Dutch government and to the New Haven colony for men and supplies. The only support forthcoming was food and animal feed from the New Haven colony. On the cusp of the New Year, John Underhill was dispatched with a force of 120 men to the town of Greenwich in response to local Wappinger Confederacy attacks. Greenwich was settled by English colonists but had agreed to Dutch suzerainty in exchange for protection. After much searching, the colonial force was finally directed to a party of Indians by the residents of the adjacent town of Stamford. Underhill's force managed to kill or capture twenty Indians in a surprise attack. A raid was soon launched on the Wesquaesgeek which managed to destroy two villages and much of the Indians' stored winter food. Underhill next participated in an attack on the Indians of western Long Island in February 1644. The colonial force managed to kill 120 Indians in attacks on two villages. Only one colonial soldier was killed and three were wounded. The massacre John Underhill returned to Stamford to acquire information on the whereabouts of the Indians. He encountered the guide who had led them in the initial unproductive phase of the last expedition in the region. The guide was anxious to demonstrate his good will and offered to lead Underhill to a large concentration of Indians nearby. As a result, three yachts delivered 130 colonial soldiers to Greenwich under the joint command of General John Underhill and Hendrick van Dyck Ensign. The army was forced to spend a night in Greenwich due to a winter storm. The next day the army marched out into the surrounding hilly country. Traveling conditions were so poor that some men had to crawl at stages. The army came within a mile of the Indian village by eight in the evening. After resting for a couple of hours, the army crossed two rivers and surrounded the village which was located in the hollow of a great hill. The village was called \\"Nanichiestawack\\" meaning \\"Place of Safety\\"\\"(Kelly T. In Their Footsteps. New York Times. May 2, 2004). The Lenape were gathered for a pow wow during a winter ceremony of celebration in their place of safety on sacred lands of their ancestors with special guests from local tribes. The Siwanoy and Tankiteke were attempting to integrate the tribes with blessings on the land and people. Scholars and local historians do not agree on the actual site of the massacre. Some historians believe it to be located on the border of modern Bedford and Pound Ridge Townships adjacent to the Pound Ridge reservation where two rivers intersect beneath what later became a mine in the 1930s of Rose Quartz. Others assume it to be located between Routes 104 and 172.(Westchester Historical County Bulletin, 1951) It consisted of three orderly rows of houses each 80 paces long. The Dutch report states that the Indians had gathered there for a winter festival. The night attack on the village was conducted under the light of a full moon. The Indians were awake when the colonial force launched its attack. In the initial phase Dutch reports suggest 180 Indians were killed outside of the houses while one colonial soldier was killed and twelve wounded. The village was sufficiently encompassed by the attacking force such that the Indians could not escape. The survivors holed up in the houses and fired arrows at the assaulting army. In a repetition of the tactics employed in the Mystic massacre, John Underhill and his co-commander ordered the village set on fire with the inhabitants inside including mostly Women, children and tribal elders. The Dutch account reported on this phase of the battle, according to Underhill, \\"What was most wonderful is, that among this vast collection of Men, Women and Children not one was heard to cry or to scream.\\"Journal of New Netherland. pg 17 Only eight Indians survived the battle of whom three were severely wounded. According to the surviving tribes, more than 600 Native Americans from 7 tribes had been killed in the massacre. Reports by colonists claim between 500 and 600 killed by Underhill's troops most of whom were burned alive. Members of the Wappinger confederacy; Raritan, Wecquaesgeek, Tankiteke, Siwanoy. The survivors included a medicine man and his grandson who arrived the next day to the sight of burnt family members. In total the colonial force lost only one man and fifteen wounded. The Native Americans were unprepared for war as they had nurtured a strong relationship with local officials and possessed memorandum of agreement based on mutual respect for the land with local officials. John Underhill violated these agreements and was wounded in the attack. The army remained at the battle site for the night and departed the next morning. The army arrived in Stamford by the afternoon and was welcomed by the inhabitants. The army left Stamford and arrived at New Amsterdam after two days. A Thanksgiving celebration was held on the return of the army. Aftermath The enormous devastation wrought on the Indians at the Pound Ridge Massacre and at preceding battles compelled several sachems to seek peace with the colonial government. S.F. Cook roughly estimates the combined Siwanoy and Tankiteke population as only 1800 in 1620. Four sachems arrived in Stamford and concluded a truce with Kieft on April 6, 1644. Soon afterwards representatives of the Matinecoc tribe on Long Island agreed to a truce, although several nearby tribes continued fighting. The war would muddle on for another year with neither side taking decisive action. Several Indian bands made peace with the colonial government in the spring of 1645, but a final peace agreement with all of the belligerent parties was not agreed until August 31, 1645. Peter Stuyvesant was chosen to replace Willem Kieft as the Director of New Netherland in early 1645 due to great dissatisfaction with Kieft's administration. However, Kieft would continue at his post for two more years, drowning en route to the Netherlands in late September 1647 when recalled by the Company to defend his actions as governor.

John Muir Wood, (1805-1892) was a Scottish musician, piano maker, music publisher and an early amateur photographer. Early life John Muir Wood was born in Edinburgh on 31 July 1805, the son of Andrew Wood and Jacobina Ferrier. Wood's father was a partner in the Edinburgh piano manufacturing and music publishing firm of Muir, Wood and Company, and later Wood, Small and Company. In 1799 his company won a royal warrant as \\"Musical Instrument Makers of His Majesty.\\" Wood was named for his father's initial business partner, John Muir (d. 1818). His father's later business partner was George Small. Music Wood's interest in music likely stemmed from his father's profession as a piano manufacturer and music publisher in Edinburgh. As a youth in Edinburgh Wood received training as a pianist, eventually travelling to Paris and Vienna to continue his musical studies. In 1828 Wood returned to Edinburgh as a music teacher, later entering the family business. With his brothers, George (1812-1893) and Robert (1797-1871), he operated the piano and music publishing firm of Wood & Co. in Edinburgh. After relocating to Glasgow, Wood established John Muir Wood & Co. on Buchanan Street. Wood's music businesses were quite successful and through his work he was involved in arranging many classical music concerts in Glasgow. One of those concerts was the visit of Fr√©d√©ric Chopin to Scotland in 1848, which Wood coordinated with London-based piano-manufacturer James Shudi Broadwood. In 1884, Wood edited a new edition of George Farquhar Graham's \\"Songs of Scotland\\". Photography Wood never pursued photography for profit. The focus of his photographs included individual portraits, group scenes, streetscapes, ruins and rural landscapes. He travelled to remote locations for his photography. Wood's knowledge of photography may date from his friendship in the 1840s with the eye surgeon Dr. Jasper MacAldin, who shared his knowledge of optics and chemistry. MacAldin was also a subject in several of Wood's portraits. In 1841, Wood toured the west of Scotland with landscape painter James Eckford Lauder (1811-1869). After settling in Glasgow, Wood took paddle steamers, as well as more traditional boats, to explore and photograph the Clyde, Largs, Arran, the Isle of Bute and other Scottish locales. Wood produced his photographs using a calotype process. He also experimented with the addition of various metals, such as copper, tin, gold and uranium in an attempt to produce different color tones and more permanent images. Wood's collection of more than 900 images, believed by experts to be the first serious series of landscape pictures of Scotland, are part of the collection of the National Galleries of Scotland. An exhibit of this collection was held at the National Gallery of Scotland in 2008. The collection is permanently held at the Scottish National Portrait Gallery. A selection of Wood's photographs, entitled \\"Photography of John Muir Wood\\", by Sarah Stevenson, et al., was published in 1988. Personal life On 22 January 1851 in Gorbals, Lanark, Scotland, John Muir Wood married Helen Kemlo Stephen. The couple raised a large family together. Muir Wood died at Cove, Dumbartonshire (now Argyll and Bute), Scotland on 25 June 1892. Wood's body was returned to Glasgow and was buried in the Glasgow Necropolis.Wikisource:Wood, John Muir (DNB00) John Muir Wood is the great- grandfather of Sir Alan Muir Wood (1921-2009), a British civil engineer known as the father of modern tunneling. Sir Alan and his son, Dr. Paul Muir Wood, were instrumental in donating John Muir Woods photographic images to the National Galleries of Scotland.

The song was also released as the B-side to \\"Rebels\\" and it was included on the compilation The Best of Everything. Recording While this song was recorded there was tension between the bandmates, each having a different vision for what the final versions of the song and the album would sound like. It was during the recording sessions for this album that Petty broke his hand after punching a wall out of frustration. The song, along with the rest of the album was recorded at Sound City Studios in Los Angeles, California. Reception The song was met with generally positive reviews from several major sources such as Rolling Stone, which called it \\"a fierce defense of his Southern roots and an ambitious fight for his creative honor.\\" Most reviews for the whole album specifically mentioned this song as a highlight. Live performances The song was included on the 2009 collection The Live Anthology and in the 2018 posthumous collection An American Treasure. The featured performance is from the band's Gainesville, Florida, show on September 21, 2006. History Tom Petty said: \\"That may be my favorite among my songs - just in terms of a piece of pure writing. I remember writing it very vividly. It was in the middle of the night and I was playing it on the piano at home in Encino. I was just singing into my cassette recorder and suddenly these words came out.\\" Petty also mentioned his mother, Katherine, who died in 1980 in the song, and stated he didn't go to her funeral because of his hatred for funerals and because his presence would have raised a commotion.https://www.songfacts.com/facts/tom-petty-the- heartbreakers/southern-accents ReferencesExternal links * Tom Petty official website * Tom Petty songs 1985 songs Songs written by Tom Petty ","title":"Southern Accents (song)"},{"id":"38600717","title":"13.13"},{"id":"38600726","text":"Netperf is a software application that provides network bandwidth testing between two hosts on a network.

His research focuses on the biochemistry and molecular biology of DNA repair and homologous recombination. His lab combines fluorescence microscopy, optical trapping and microfluidics to manipulate and visualize single molecules of DNA and the enzymes involved in processing and repairing DNA. He calls this scientific approach, \\"visual biochemistry\\". Stephen Kowalczykowski was elected to the American Society for Arts and Science in 2005, the National Academy of Sciences in 2007 and was a Harvey Society Lecturer at Rockefeller University in 2012.  Education and career  Stephen Kowalczykowski studied Chemistry (B.S.) at Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute in 1972 and earned his Ph.D. in Chemistry/Biochemistry at Georgetown University in 1976. His dissertation title was \\"Physical-Chemistry studies of Sickle Cell Hemoglobin.\\" He then worked as a postdoctoral researcher with Dr. Peter von Hippel at the University of Oregon Health Sciences Institute, where he began studying the physical chemistry of protein-nucleic interactions. He began his academic research career at Northwestern University Medical School in 1981 and later moved to the University of California at Davis in 1991. He is one of the world's foremost experts on RecA, the defining member of a ubiquitous class of DNA strand-exchange proteins that are essential for homologous recombination, a pathway that maintains genomic integrity by repairing broken DNA. His lab has made significant contributions to the fields of DNA repair, homologous recombination and the biophysics of DNA helicases.  Scientific contributions  A few of his lab's notable scientific contributions include the structural and molecular mechanism of DNA end resection by RecBCD (E. coli) and DNA2-Sgs1-RPA and regulatory stimulation by Top3-Rmi1 and Mre11-Rad50-Xrs2 (S. cerevisiae), the kinetics of RecA filament nucleation and growth and regulation by RecFOR (E. coli), the purification and molecular mechanism of the human breast cancer susceptibility gene BRCA2 (humans), the mechanism of the Holliday junction dissolution by the Bloom's Syndrome helicase (BLM) homologue, Sgs1 (S. cerevisiae), and the mechanism of the 3-dimensional homology search catalyzed by RecA (E. coli).

It is usually a surgical complication seen after extensive pelvic surgery (such as cancer surgery) and is most commonly found in the retroperitoneal space. Spontaneous development is rare. Signs and symptoms Many lymphoceles are asymptomatic. Larger lymphoceles may cause symptoms related to compression of adjacent structures leading to lower abdominal pain, abdominal fullness, constipation, urinary frequency, and edema of the genitals and/or legs. Serious sequelae could develop and include infection of the lymphocele, obstruction and infection of the urinary tract, intestinal obstruction, venous thrombosis, pulmonary embolism, chylous ascites and lymphatic fistula formation. On clinical examination the skin may be reddened and swollen and a mass felt. Ultrasonography or CT scan will help to establish a diagnosis. Other fluid collections to be considered in the differential diagnosis are urinoma, seroma, hematoma, as well as collections of pus. Also, when lower limb edema is present, venous thrombosis needs to be considered. Cause The risk of the development of a lymphocele is positively correlated to the extent of the removal of lymphatic tissue during surgery (lymphadenectomy). Surgery destroys and disrupts the normal channels of lymph flow. If the injury is minor, collateral channels will transport lymph fluid, but with extensive damage, fluid may accumulate in an anatomic space resulting in a lymphocele. Typical operations leading to lymphocysts are renal transplantation and radical pelvic surgery with lymph node removal because of bladder, prostatic or gynecologic cancer. Other factors that may predispose of lymphocele development are preoperative radiation therapy, heparin prophylaxis (used to prevent deep vein thrombosis), and tumor characteristics. After radical surgery for cervical and ovarian cancer studies with follow-up CT found lymphoceles in 20% and 32%, respectively. Typically they develop within 4 months after surgery. Management It has been suggested that suction drains placed during surgery and non-peritonisation (not closing the posterior peritoneum) may reduce the possibility of lymphocele development. Smaller lymphoceles can be managed expectantly, and many lesions will regress over time. For symptomatic lesions a number of approaches are available and include fine needle aspiration with US or CT guidance, catheter insertion and drainage (with possible use of sclerosants), and surgical drainage. Sex and masturbation may cause the lymphocele to grow if it is in the genital area. It is suggested to avoid these activities for around four to six weeks. Some exercises may also help to shrink it.

Built in 1895-98, it is an imposing Victorian brick building of unusual sophistication for a small rural community. It presently houses the town's library and municipal offices. It was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1974. Description and history The Stewart Free Library is set on the west side of Corinna's town center, on the west side of a small green formed by the junction of Nokomis Road and St. Albans Road (Maine State Route 43). It is an imposing 2-1/2 story structure of brick with granite trim, with a four-story tower rising from the center of the front (east-facing) facade. The building is symmetrically arranged, three bays wide, with gabled dormer-like projections flanking the tower on the hip roof, and a pair of tall chimneys rising at the rear of the building. The main entrance is located at the base of the tower in a round-arch opening, with a pair of narrow sash windows at the second level. The flanking bays have groups of three sash windows, those on the first floor topped by a rounded granite lintel, those on the second by a rectangular lintel. Stewart Library, 2012 The building was a gift to the community by native son Levi M. Stewart, who had amassed a fortune in business in Minnesota. Stewart retained Minneapolis architect William Harrison Grimshaw to design the building, which was built by a Bangor, Maine contractor between 1895 and 1898. At its completion it was considered to be one of the finest public buildings in the state. Stewart also donated 3,000 volumes to start the library collection, and then bequeathed his personal legal and literary collection to the library, as well as a trust fund for its maintenance. The building memorializes Stewart's parents.

Because, by design, such appliances are air-tight when closed, a person entrapped inside will have a low supply of oxygen. Early refrigerators could only be opened from the outside, making accidental entrapment a possibility, particularly of children playing with discarded appliances; many such deaths have been recorded. Modern designs close with a magnetic mechanism that can be opened from the inside, reducing the danger of accidental entrapment. History The original \\"refrigerator\\" was a household appliance that kept food cold using blocks of ice; now called the \\"icebox\\", these cabinets became popular in the 1800s and early 1900s. The first modern electrical refrigerator to see widespread use was the General Electric \\"Monitor-Top\\" refrigerator, introduced in 1927, and refrigerators became common in the United States in the 1930s. Regardless of the cooling technology, doors on the units were sealed shut using a mechanical latch. After World War II when production of refrigerators resumed, old refrigerators were often disposed of. By the mid-1950s, deaths were not uncommon for children in the United States. For example, statistics for the 18 months from January 1954 to June 1956 show that 54 children were known to have been trapped in household refrigerators, and that 39 of them died. As the issue rose in prominence, people were asked not to abandon refrigerators and to detach the doors of unused refrigerators. At least one state, Oklahoma, enacted legislation making the abandonment of a refrigerator with a latch in a location where a child might find it illegal. At least as early as 1954, alternative methods of securing air-tight closures had been suggested, such as in patent 2767011, filed by Francis P. Buckley et al. in 1954 and issued in 1956. Starting in the mid-1950s, volunteers and health inspectors searched out abandoned refrigerators in order to detach doors and break latches. However, these efforts were not entirely effective, and children were still dying inside refrigerators that had not been found and dismantled. The Refrigerator Safety Act in 1956 was a U.S. law that required a change in the way refrigerator doors stay shut. It was codified at 15 U.S.C. 1211‚Äì1214 as Public Law 84-930, 70 Stat. 953, on 2 August 1956. The act applied to all refrigerators manufactured in the United States after 31 October 1958, and is largely responsible for the adoption of the magnetic mechanism that is used today instead of a latch. Individual American states also have similar laws, such as California and Washington. Around the world, manufacture of latch refrigerators has been replaced by that of ones with magnet-closing doors. The number of U.S. and Canadian deaths due to suffocation in refrigerators declined a significant amount in the years following federal legislation. A 1985 study of suffocation deaths in the United States showed a sharp decline in the early 1960s, followed by a plateau and gradual decline to the early 1980s. The Refrigerator Safety Act was a factor in the decline, in combination with other factors such as \\"reduced exposure and increased parental supervision\\". Entrapment hazards Hazardous items for refrigerator deaths are \\"places with a poor air supply, a heavy lid or a self-latching door\\". Children playing games ‚Äì such as hide and seek ‚Äì may crawl inside a small secret place, such as an appliance, and become trapped. The water-tight or air-tight seal prevents them from getting air, and the appliance's noise insulation prevents their screams from being heard. Suffocation follows. Any of the following pieces of equipment can put children at risk for refrigerator death: * Refrigerator, especially those with a latch * Icebox * Freezer * Cooler * Clothes washer and dryer * Toy box or toy chest Examples * Three South African children died after becoming locked in an abandoned refrigerator. * Two sisters died in Novgorod Oblast, Russia, when they hid in their grandmother's refrigerator. * Two siblings and a friend ‚Äì ages 1, 4, and 6 ‚Äì climbed inside a chest freezer that was sitting, unused and unplugged, in their family's yard in Florida, United States. A hasp for a padlock had been installed, but the unit was not locked. After the children climbed inside, the lid fell and the hasp engaged, which prevented them from getting out. * Two brothers in Kyrgyzstan ‚Äì ages 4 and 6 ‚Äì died while playing hide and seek, when they became trapped in an abandoned refrigerator that had been built with an \\"automatic locking system.... The type of fridge was particularly popular in the Soviet era and was specially built so that it could not be opened from the inside.\\" * A toddler suffocated after being trapped in a front-loading washing machine while playing with his brother. Prevention Product design can be used to mitigate risk. An example is substitution of magnetic strips for sealing doors, instead of latches. In addition, appliances should be recalled when a danger is identified. Public education is effective. Education programs may include public service announcements, pamphlets, advertisements in magazines and newspapers, articles in newspapers, and school-based programming to educate children. One such example is a 1971 public information film shown in the United Kingdom called 'Children and Disused Fridges', which became well-known due to its frightening message. A Canadian study showed that the most effective safety education was \\"targeted, simple, action-oriented messaging\\" especially when \\"combined with strategies to change behaviour.\\" Common education campaigns focus on parent awareness and reminding owners that appliance doors should be removed before discarding. Parents or caregivers can lessen the risks of refrigerator deaths. Spaces can be made safer by childproofing against entrapment. A refrigerator bar or lock prevents access to appliances; some jurisdictions, such as Austria, distribute free childproofing supplies. Doors that lead to spaces containing dangerous equipment, such as utility rooms and campers, should be kept locked. Proper supervision of children will reduce opportunities for entrapment.

In the Mexican War, he took part in the capture of Vera Cruz, and in the Civil War, he captured four blockade-runners and destroyed four others. As a Rear-Admiral during a violent revolt in Panama in 1873, he was able to protect American and European property, earning official thanks from many nations. Early life  Almy was born in Newport, Rhode Island the son of Samuel Almy, who had been brought up as a Quaker, but was \\"read out\\" of the Society for marrying out of the fold.

In his reports to the Navy Department Rear-Admiral Paulding noted that, \\"Lieutenant- Commander Almy performed his part of the work exceedingly well, and is an officer who can be relied upon at all times.\\" Almy also commanded the Fulton in the Paraguay expedition of 1858‚Äì59. Almy then served at the New York Navy Yard before being commissioned as commander on April 24, 1861. During the Civil War, he commanded firstly the in the South Atlantic Blockading Squadron under Admiral Du Pont from 1862 to 1863, then the in the North Atlantic Blockading Squadron under Admiral Lee in 1864, and finally the in the South Atlantic Blockading Squadron under Admiral Dahlgren in 1865. While in command of the Connecticut, Almy captured four noted blockade-runners with valuable cargoes, and destroyed four others. Almy was promoted to captain on March 3, 1865, and commanded the Juniata in a cruise to the South Atlantic, operating off the coasts of Brazil and Africa in 1865‚Äì67. While on the Brazilian coast, he rescued the crew of the shipwrecked Brazilian brig Americo, receiving the thanks of the Emperor of Brazil.

In 1875, Almy was presented with the Order of King Kamehameha I by King KalƒÅkaua of Hawaii, after organising the King's trip to the United States on U.S. Naval vessels. In July 1876, after serving for two years and ten months in the Pacific, Almy returned to the United States, and having reached the mandatory age, was retired in April 1877, having served for a total of twenty-seven years and ten months at sea, the longest of any officer of the navy up to that time, as well as fourteen years and eight months on shore. Almy was the first naval officer to serve as the Commander-in-Chief of the Military Order of the Loyal Legion of the United States, succeeding former President Rutherford B.

The research group also runs an outreach program and was involved in the making of the theatrical movie More than Honey.  History  Reports about dramatic declines in a number of global honeybee populations, especially in commercially managed stock, resulted in an inquiry of the Australian Parliament into the future of the Australian honey bee industry. A house standing committee on Primary Industries and Resources finally published a report on 16 June 2008 that summarised the situation of the honeybee industry in Australia. Among a large number of recommendations, the report identified an urgent need for more research to address existing and future problems of Australian honeybees, the bee industry and recommended a substantial increase in funding for honeybee research. The need for additional and coordinated research into honeybees stimulated in a number of initiatives from Australian researchers and research institutions. However, it became clear that the geographical isolation of Western Australia and the ban to import bees or some bee products into the state requires the buildup of a specific research hub. CIBER was formally set up as the Collaborative Initiative for Bee Research at the University of Western Australia in 2008 and was renamed in 2011 to Centre for Integrative Bee Research. The name change coincided with the introduction of a new logo, that is currently still in use. In 2017 CIBER shifted its operations from the University of Western Australia to the University of California, Riverside campus. See http://ciber.ucr.acsitefactory.com/  Research  The interdisciplinary approach is one of the core characteristics of CIBER‚Äôs activities, which run along two different gradients: First, CIBER connects several disciplines of research including the molecular and nano sciences, evolutionary biology, and sociobiology, as well as economics. Second, CIBER bridges fundamental and applied sciences by generating new knowledge in areas of practical interest for honeybee industry partners. CIBER uses a number of modern molecular technologies such as genomics and proteomics to identify molecules involved in physiological processes such as reproduction or immunity. Research conducted at CIBER pioneered a novel scientific field in research known as evolutionary proteomics. The central idea is to understand how evolutionary processes operate on the molecular level. Researchers at CIBER conducted the first large scale analyses of the proteins present in glandular secretions supporting honeybee sperm, such as seminal fluid and spermathecal fluid. For experimental work, CIBER maintains and breeds its own bee stock of around 60 colonies, kept at an apiary on the campus of the University of Western Australia. During the winter month, most of the bee stock is moved north to overwintering grounds. CIBER personnel is represented in a number of National boards and councils to provide expertise and advice on issues about honeybees, for example the RIRDC Honeybee Advisory Board, the Primary Producers Committee or the Asian Honeybee Transition to Management Scientific Advisory group.  Collaboration with the honeybee industry  A number of research projects are done in collaboration with local beekeepers. To do this, CIBER received funding in 2009 from the Australian Research Council to conduct research on male honeybee fertility together with Better Bees of Western Australia as an industry partner. Better Bees of Western Australia is a group of 8 commercial beekeepers. Each individual beekeeper owns and maintains some of the 24 bee lineages that are recognized as part of \\"The Western Australian Bee Breeding Program\\". The aim of the honey bee breeding program is to maintain a genetic pool of honey bee breeding stock for the WA apiary industry to use in maintaining a healthy population of managed honeybees. In 2013 CIBER and Better Bees received a second grant from the Australian Research Council to study the fungal disease Nosema and its interactions with the honeybee immune system.  CIBER outreach  The research and activities of CIBER are communicated to the broader public through an outreach program, which includes the organisation of public lectures and seminars, the showing of bees to the public and in schools and exhibitions, as well as activities during the yearly honeybee week. In 2011, CIBER and the Perth based museum SciTech organised an exhibition \\"The Science of Honeybees\\", which initially ran for 6 months at SciTech, then toured through schools and libraries in Western Australia. The success of the exhibition inspired plans for a permanent CIBER - Honeybee exhibition at SciTech, which was scheduled to open in 2013. CIBER also maintains its own facebook page, which allows interested users to follow ongoing activities at CIBER as well as get updated information on honeybees in general. CIBER is also involved in organisation of the yearly Honey Week, which is held annually in May. Honey week is an Australia-wide initiative to showcase bees and beekeeping to the public. The outreach activities of CIBER were awarded with the Premier's Science Award of Western Australia in 2014, acknowledging its success in raising community awareness about the importance of honeybees in the environment.  More than Honey movie CIBER was involved in the making of the theatrical documentary More than Honey by Swiss film maker Markus Imhoof, which was released into several European movie theatres in 2012. The group provided scientific advisory for the film, and some of the research conducted at CIBER is featured in the film. The movie had its world premiere on 11 August 2012, concluding the Locarno film festival in Switzerland and was later on shown at the Toronto International Film Festival (TIFF) in September 2012. The documentary was the most successful Swiss film of 2012 and is the most successful Swiss documentary movie of all time. The movie was awarded more than 25 international prizes such as the German and Swiss Film Awards for best documentary, and became the Swiss candidate for a nomination in the category of Best Foreign Language Film at the 86th Academy Awards (Oscar) . CIBER actively promoted screenings of the movie in Australia as part of the German Film Festival and maintains the official English and German blog of the movie.  Future Bees Fund  For fund raising purposes and in order to finance activities such as bee research, beekeeping and outreach activities, CIBER set up the Future Bees Fund in 2013, which is a non-profit fund located at the University of Western Australia. A board consisting of representatives from research and the bee keeping industry decides on the usage of funds available and to help publicise the fund activities.

The applications connect to popular information systems including Excel or Salesforce.com and business intelligence systems such as Cognos and corporate databases such as Microsoft SQL. The app is currently used by over 20% of the Fortune 50 and has been downloaded more than 600,000 times. Company history MeLLmo Inc. (makers of Roambi) was founded in 2008 by Santiago Becerra, Jaime Zuluaga, David Becerra, and Quinton Alsbury, based in San Diego, California. The idea for the company came as Santiago Becerra, standing in line to buy his first iPhone in June 2007, realized the business potential of the mobile device. He sought to create a better display for common business data. The goal initially was to create a touch-based data visualization app exclusively for the iPhone. At the time, the iOS App Store was not available to distribute software, so the company found difficulties convincing others of their prospect. In 2008, before Apple released their first iOS Software Development Kit that allowed people to develop native applications for the iPhone, Roambi was already developing a basic app. The company remained in stealth mode until May 2009, when it launched Roambi on the iPhone as a free app. When the iPad was announced in January 2010, Roambi decided to develop a new version of the app for the tablet‚Äôs launch. Roambi developed the app to leverage the unique aspects of the iPad, such as the larger screen size, and included new analytic features. The app was ready the day the iPad was released in April 2010. In June 2011, MeLLmo released Roambi Flow, an app that allows users to create and present magazine-style publications on the iPad by integrating text with charts and graphs created in Roambi Analytics. In June 2013, MeLLmo released \\"Roambi Business\\" a secure cloud-based platform. At the same time, the company launched a North American partner program with more than 20 partners trained and certified to work with Roambi Business to sell the service and provide implementation and development services around the application. The program was designed to increase Roambi's engagement and extend its ability to reach end users. The company previously had over 100 partners outside the United States.

Al-Safira is also next to important weapon factories and the government's largest chemical weapons stockpiles.  Battle  Situation in as-Safira mid-March 2013 On 6 February 2013, violent clashes took place between Al-Nusra Front and several other rebel battalions and government forces south of Al-Safira city, along with violent bombardment on some areas of the city. On February 8, 2013, it was reported that government forces were stationed at defense establishments and had set up checkpoints on the route to Khanasser, but rebel battalions controlled the streets of the city.https://now.mmedia.me/lb/en/nowsyrialatestnews/rebels-kill-soldiers- after-mass-casualties-in-north-syria, February 8, 2013 Several parts of Safira continued to be bombarded by government forces, in an attempt to reclaim the city. Rebels from Al-Nusra Front and other jihadist groups surrounded the defense plant where many Army troops were stationed. Seven soldiers were killed when Al-Nusra fighters attacked a military checkpoint south of the defense plant. According to opposition activists, 112 rebels had been killed in the previous 72 hours. Much of the local population fled the city as a result of the violence. The opposition group SOHR reported that a convoy of Army reinforcements arrived at the factory after the fighting had ended. Later, it was reported that another convoy that was sent to the city was attacked by rebels and halted. The stalemate in al-Safira continued for almost two weeks, with a war of attrition being waged between government troops still remaining in the city and rebel forces. However, on 19 February it was reported that, although unable to recapture the city, government reinforcements did manage to secure the road south of it and connect with troops at the plant, which had been under siege by rebels who could not capture it. The Army reinforcements further pushed north towards Aleppo, but were once again halted by rebels at the town of Tell Aran. By this point, rebel forces had lost more than 200 fighters while attempting to stop the Army reinforcements.  Aftermath  In early March, government troops captured the last village on the road between Aleppo and al-Safira, re-establishing a land supply route between central Syria and Aleppo's airport. As of late April, rebel forces that were still managing to hold most of the city were coming under constant Army bombardment. Islamic rebels also continued to mount failed attacks against the military factory, in attempts to capture it. On October 13, 2013, it was reported by Xinhua that the town was besieged by the government forces.Syrian army advances as rebels rain down Damascus . 2013-10-13.

It is one of ten rathas (\\"chariots\\") carved out of pink granite within the group of monuments of the Pallava Period at Mahabalipuram, a UNESCO-inscribed World Heritage Site since 1984. The ratha is an example of monolith Indian rock-cut architecture dating from the late seventh century during the reign of King Mahendravarman I and his son Narasimhavarman I. Initially constructed with a Shiva Linga, it is now deified with a Ganesha deity after the linga was removed. Geography The temple is located in Mamallapuram, now known as Mahabalipuram, on the Coromandel Coast in the Bay of Bengal of the Indian Ocean, within the Kanchipuram district. Within the UNESCO-inscribed area, there are scores of other monuments. It is located on a hillock to the northwest and on the backside of the rock with the rock relief of Arjuna's Penance (or Descent of the Ganges). Situated from the Varaha Cave Temple, the Ganesha Ratha is west facing. History The Ganesha Ratha is a fully completed rock-cut structure, while nearby rathas are incomplete. The current stone ratha is a replica of a wooden version which preceded it. Its construction is credited to Narasimhavarman I who reigned 630-688AD. While it is conjectured that this ratha was built prior to the other rathas of the area, there is no historical evidence to confirm it. The temple was originally dedicated to Lord Shiva but in the 1880s, villagers replaced the Shiva Linga with an image of Ganesha, after formally seeking permission from the District Collector, and may have been attributed to George V of England. The original Shiva Linga is installed under a tree nearby. Along with several other monuments, this temple gained UNESCO World Heritage Site distinction in 1984 as \\"Group of Monuments at Mahabalipuram\\". Architecture=Layout= Kudus (Horse-shoe shaped dormer windows) carved on the cornices for the entire length, above the pillars It is built to a rectangular plan which measures , and is in height on the exterior. The interior rectangular chamber measures , and is in height. The ratha is three tiered and studded with images and other architectural features which are found in other South Indian temples. The facade is a columned verandah flanked by sculptures of dwarapalakas (guardians). The columns are mounted on seated lions which are the typecast design of Pallava architecture. There are also two pilasters, which are also lion mounted, and they face each other. It is a rock cut structure. The cornices above the pillars have Kudu (Horse-shoe shaped dormer windows) depictions along its entire length and these kudus are also depicted at the gable ends of the roof. Below the gabled roofs, on both long ends windows are carved in horseshoe shape with three doors, the central door has a sculpture of a human head with a trident akin to Shiva. At the other end of the gable, this sculpture is missing. In the back wall between the pilasters, images are not carved. The roof covering above the top floor is large, vaulted, and wagon-shaped, with arches at the corners. The top of the vaulted roof is fitted with a series of nine vase-shaped finials each consisting of a pot and trident. =Features= There are 18 inscriptions in Grantha and NƒÅgarƒ´ scripts of the Sanskrit language inscribed on its west portico. Out of the fourteen verses in these inscriptions, the twelfth verse is ascribed to Narasimhavarman I's grandson, Paramesvaravarman I, surnamed Atyantakama, who as the Pallava king was known as Atyantakama, Atyantakama-Pallaveshvara- Griham.

In other words, melharmony aims to create chords and counterpoints based on the melodic rules of evolved systems across the world. Melharmony thus blends the two primary, yet diverse concepts in world music - melody and harmony. It was originally proposed and developed by musician-composer N. Ravikiran.The Hindu, 26 March 2013 British-American composer Robert Morris further developed it from the standpoint of Western theory. Melharmony is a style of music that takes into consideration the rules and aesthetics of melody-centric systems like Indian classical as well as harmony-anchored systems like Western classical and jazz but is not limited to only those. Definition and approach Melharmony has been defined as \\"harmony and vertical layers of music with an emphasis on the rules and principles of highly evolved melodic systems\\".Morris, Robert and Chitravina N. Ravikiran, \\"Ravikiran's Concept of Melharmony: An Inquiry into Harmony in South Indian Ragas,\\" Music Theory Spectrum, 28/2:255-76. It was initially seen as a unique classical fusion engaging Western and Indian classical systems, though it has subsequently also been a synthesis of melodic rules of India's classical music with jazz, Brazilian and other world cultures. American composer and music theorist Robert Morris notes, \\"Melharmony therefore suggests that voice leading should be derived from the melodic and combinational structure of a mode (raga). Further, while almost any note combination could be workable when rendered successively, only certain combinations will be palatable when rendered simultaneously, which makes melharmony all the more intricate.\\" While a number of systems like the Raga system of Indian Carnatic Music/Hindustani classical music, Chinese Music and Makam system of Persia or have been built upon solid melodic principles dating back to thousands of years, Indian and Chinese systems, which use twelve-tone musical system like Western classical music would be easier to \\"melharmonize\\" as opposed to Persian/Arabic systems, some of which could have as many as nine micro-tonal intervals or comma within every whole toneKurt Reinhard: The New Grove: Dictionary of Music and Musicians. vol. 19. ed. London: Macmillan, 1980 Morris further notes that melharmony could apply to African combinations as well and it also fits older forms of western music that evolved out the monophonic plainchant of the 10th century, CE. Until about 1550, western melodies were based on modes. Classical Western harmony and melharmony Classical Western approach to harmony has been Triad-centric for centuries though other important tools include ostinato, contrary movements, rhythmic augmentation or diminution, imitation etc. are also vital techniques. However, extrapolating a triad-centric approach to melodic systems like Indian Carnatic classical which have intricate rules for hundreds of modes (ragas) often creates conflicting results. Melharmony shifts the focus from triad-centric harmony to fragmentation for creating multiple parts. If fragmentation were to anchor harmony in close alliance with melodic rules of diverse systems, one will be able to employ triadic harmony, ostinato and other tools around it, which will result in reconciling both melodic and harmonic approaches. Melodic principles in melharmony Melharmony functions on a sophisticated set of principles that also take into consideration melodic rules and structure. Melodic systems in many parts of the world have tended to expand horizontally, exploring more scales and modes with specific ascending and descending sequences as opposed to the primary Major or Minor scales which form the core of harmonic systems. An instance of this would be the Carnatic music of India where each raga (mode) demands integrity to scale, sequence, key phrases (fragmentation), hierarchy of notes within its structure and so forth. In other words, each raga is not merely a melodic mode or scale but a unique melodic scheme. Melharmony pays attention to these rules while creating multiple parts. Illustration Illustration 1 - Sequence of notes: The sequence of a raga Kadanakutoohalam is C D F A B E G C - C B A G F E D C. Even though it is using the same notes as C major, a major chord like C-E-G will not sound as appropriate in a melharmonic context as E-G-C. D-F-A would work very well but in the case of E-G-B, an inversion (B-E-G) could be a good option. F-A-C, G-B-D and A-C-E would also be non-appropriate. Illustration 2 - Hierarchy of notes: Arabhi uses a simple sequence: C D F G A C - C B A G F E D C. But B and E are employed only fleetingly in this raga, which eliminates several chord options including C-E-G (in any permutation). However, careful choices such as F-A-D (rather than D-F-A) can make the melody come alive since all three notes are dominant in this raga. Illustration 3 - Ornamentation of notes: Raga Shankarabharanam, (one of the \\"Big-6\\" modes in Carnatic) is the equivalent of the major scale: C D E F G A B C - C B A G F E D C. But several chords that are routinely employed in Western compositions may not sound appropriate to the raga's character, because of certain ornamentation which include oscillation of notes like D, F and A, a force imparted to B which almost pushes it to the high C and so forth. Chord triads which sound appropriate in a melharmonic context (such as diminished B-D-F ) are more exceptions to the rule. The above illustrations do not imply that melharmony is limited in scope. Quite the converse since there are diverse harmonic options in many ragas which can be explored and employed appropriately. Similar melharmonic options can be created for any highly evolved melodic system. Performance repertoire Melharmonic compositions employ a diverse forms, some of which are original. They also employ musical forms of Western classical such as daprice,Capriccio (music) √©tude and concerto for various instruments and also forms like geetam and krti (also spelt as kriti), which are used in Indian Carnatic music. They often showcase ragas novel to Western audiences and often feature inventive rhythmic cadences,cadence (music) mathematical codas and embedded sequences suggestive of melodic improvisation. Melharmonic arrangements of traditional Indian composers including Tyagaraja, Oottukkadu Venkata Kavi and Muthuswami Dikshitar have been performed by various professional symphonies & chamber orchestras, string orchestras, quartets and quintets ensembles as well as Jazz, Rock & world music groups. Melharmony plays a dynamic role in Jazz and world music concerts, when coupled with interesting rhythms. It has been acknowledged to have had a ‚Äúprofound influence on many musicians' notions of improvisation‚Äù.  Melharmony festivals  Melharmony festivals featuring two master composers who were contemporaries from the diverse worlds of melody and harmony such as OVK-Bach Festival centered on the creations and contributions of Oottukkadu Venkata Kavi (1700 - 1765) from the East and Johann Sebastian Bach (1685 - 1750) from the West or Tyagaraja (1767-1847)‚ÄîMozart (1756‚Äì91) Festival and Dikshitar (1775-1835)‚ÄîBeethoven (1770-1827) Festival have pioneered a new era in world music attracting musicians, composers, orchestras, conductors, scholars, students and listeners of both cultures alike. The highlight of such festivals are performances of traditional Eastern melodic and Western harmony-centric repertoire and a climactic section of Melharmonic arrangements of pure melodic works performed by Western orchestras and ensembles. Scholarly sessions, contests, student and community music and dance events as well as skits/plays centered on the master composers also enhance the artistic and academic experience. General Melharmony Festivals and events have been held in Gottingen, Germany, Goetheanum Switzerland, London, Bradford, Manchester and other cities in UK and in various cities in USA including Houston and Minneapolis. Melharmony in schools and colleges Since melharmony gives practical perspectives in different world music systems effortlessly, it has been increasingly used to provide educative and exciting performing experience for orchestra students in schoolsSun Prairie Star, USA 12 Feb 2016 in cities such as Madison, Houston, Middleton, Round Rock, Oregon, Sun Prairie, Sacramento, Minneapolis etc. in United States, from Middle School to Youth Symphony Levels. Orchestras have been part of melharmony residencies and camps and performed pieces in their concerts. Academic papers and college courses  Prof. Robert Morris' (Chair of composing, Eastman School of Music, NY) paper - 'Ravikiran's Concept of Melharmony: An Inquiry into Harmony in South Indian Ragas\\" in the Society for Music Theory Conference in Nov 2005, Boston, USA, brought out several theoretical aspects of Melharmony that could be applied by both composers and students of Western systems. In the New York AAWM Conference (June 2016), Morris shared recent developments on two-voice frameworks and the harmonization of Indian ragas, citing melharmony. Papers, panel discussions and lectures presented in various conferences in Amsterdam, Houston, Orlando and other cities have highlighted diverse aspects of the concept. Eastman School of Music, Rochester, NY presented a college credit course on the subject in August 2015. Other institutions such as the Massachusetts Institute of Technology in Boston, the University of Georgia in Columbus, the University of Colorado in Boulder, and Leeds College of Music in the UK, have presented workshops or classroom lectures on melharmony.

Though MRIA is located close to many tourist attractions such as Yala National Park, it lacks adequate transport links, accommodations, facilities, etc. As the airport is located in a rush and dry zone of the country, the area became suffering for foreigners that caused a very less passenger traffic in the airport. In 2004 a report produced by the International Air Transport Association claimed that money would be better invested in a second runway at the BIA than a new airport. Aviation experts have claimed that the runway orientation of the airport makes the aircraft face dangerous crosswinds. And only one taxiway has been built and that makes very hard time for taking off and landings as the pilots have to turn their airplane for 180 degrees, plus the air traffic handling capacity has become very poor. Sri Lankan pilots were also not consulted when the airport was planned. In addition, environmentalists have criticised MRIA's being built in an elephant and migratory bird habitat. During the planning stages of the project, environmentalists had warned of the threat to wildlife, but construction went ahead.Kuruwita, Rathindra (18 February 2016). \\"Development ‚Äì at what cost?\\" .

It covers an area of almost 2.2 square kilometers. The village is linked to the Torkham-Jalalabad highway, the Rodat district, and to Samarkhil, also a village within Bihsud District. The Kunar River flows to the north side of the village. Demographic Information The village is divided into three sub- areas (Wahdat, Girdi Kas elay and Dag Kelay). The total populations of the village is around 7,410 persons which, the adult population (aged 15 and above) are 3,920 (1890 male and 2030 female). Children (aged less than 14) are 3,490 (1,660 boys and 1830 girls). The numbers of households in Girdi Kas is estimated 920 households Girdi Kas villagers are 100% Pashtun. The population of two sub-areas (Girdi Kas Kelay and Girdi Kas Dag Kelay) is from Mohmand tribe, and the people of Wahdat sub-areas are Pashtun tribes (320 families) from Mohmand. 80 families from Khugyani, 400 families from Shinwari, with a few others (120 families) from other Pashtun groups. Socio-economic Facilities There is only one primary school with 6 classrooms. The Girdi Kas Primary School located in Girdi Kas Dag Kaly sub-areas has a total of 350 students (114 girls and 236 boys) and 6 male teachers. Approximately 100 children commute to middle-level schools in neighboring Kama District, but the distance and time and cost needed for commuting prevent more children to seek post-primary education. There is no health facility in the village which the people are going for the treatment to the neighbors‚Äô districts nearest clinics. According to UNHCR survey, the most common diseases in the village are diarrhoea, typhoid, and malaria. When the nearest CHC does not provide the satisfactory service, the villagers choose to travel to city hospitals in Jalalabad or to Peshawar, of Pakistan. The vast majority of the village people uses shallow well for the potable water. Most of the community people have their own open latrines and bathrooms. The source of irrigation water is Kumar-Kabul River. It is reported that irrigation water becomes scarce, due to River water flow change, from September to March. The villagers have a traditional water management system. In water-lacking season the farmer are irrigating their land by rotation. The total agricultural area is about 450 ha which 330 ha is irrigating by the local made intake and the rest is still under the treating of seasonal floods which not irrigating regularly. Agriculture and animal husbandry are the primary livelihood activities inside Girdi Kas Village, followed by small-numbered other jobs such as shop keeping and governmental employment. However, there are not enough job opportunities in the village therefore the men are seeking for daily labor outside the village. Most of the young people of the community migrate to other cities to work in order to earn money for their families. As to the differences within the village, Wahdat sub-areas people suffer more from joblessness. Although this sub-area has the biggest male population and the percentage of working people is less. Prior to the prolonged conflict, Girdi Kas was famous for its agricultural production. Unfortunately, the village is yet to recover its previous abundant crop. According to the respondents in the village, the volume of agricultural production is not satisfactory. There is no major selling place (such as market and bazaar) for the village's crops nearer than Jalalabad. Most crops are sent and sold in Jalalabad. The commercial activities within the village are very modest. There are approximately 25 small shops in the village, which serve for the residents‚Äô everyday life, although too small in scale to be called an industry. Local Institution of Water Management In Girdi Kas village has a tribal shura with 16 members, led by a landlord. The shura has functioned as the mediating body of the in- village problems and conflicts. Each of the three sub-areas has a male Community Development Council (CDC) that functions as a receptor body of outside support from aid communities and government. The village has a water management system run by Mirab.

The main drawbacks of mosh are additional prerequisites to the server, that it lacks some special features of SSH (such as connection forwarding) and the lack of a native Windows client. Design Mosh works at a different layer from SSH. Whereas SSH transmits a stream of bytes in each direction (from server to client or client to server) using TCP, Mosh runs a terminal emulator at the server to figure out what should be on the screen. The server then transmits this screen to the client at a varying frame rate, depending on the speed of the network.Winstein, Keith. \\"Mosh: An Interactive Remote Shell for Mobile Clients\\", USENIX Annual Technical Conference 2012, Boston, Mass., 14 June 2012.

Servers not fulfilling these prerequisites cannot be used by mosh. Examples of such systems include servers behind firewalls which restrict connections to the ssh-port via TCP.

Jayanath is the only Commando to receive this decoration.  Action during Operation Jayasikurui  In May 1997, the Sri Lankan government forces launched an offensive named Operation Jayasikurui against the Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam (commonly known as LTTE or Tamil Tigers). This operation was intended to regain the main supply route to the isolated Jaffna peninsula by linking up the towns of Killinochi and Vavuniya. By December 1997, the offensive had reached Maankulam. At the time, Jayanath was a Captain in the 2nd Commando Regiment attached to the army's elite 53 Division. On 4 December, he led a squadron of commandos to destroy an identified artillery position in Tamil Tiger-held Maankulam. However, upon arriving at their target, they discovered that the artillery position was a decoy, and immediately came under direct and artillery fire from Tamil Tiger units who had been waiting in ambush. Jayanath pressed forward with a small group, attempting to draw their fire and allow the rest of his men to escape. The group was soon pinned down and Jayanath ordered a defensive perimeter and radioed for reinforcements, expressing confidence that his group could hold out until they arrived. However, the reinforcements met with heavy resistance and failed to reach the group, and Jayanath was ordered to attempt to break through the Tamil Tiger positions. By this time, his group had taken heavy casualties from the constant artillery fire and repeated assaults on their positions. Attempting to break out in that situation would have meant leaving behind the wounded, and Jayanath refused the order. He informed his commanding officer that he would not leave as long as even one of his men were alive, and that they would hold out against the enemy assaults as long as possible and would not surrender. Jayanath kept fighting until he was shot in the head and killed, and the group was almost completely destroyed when their positions were eventually overrun. The mission ended in disaster for the army with approximately 180 men killed.  Parama Weera Vibhushanaya  Jayanath was posthumously promoted to the rank of Major and recommended for the Parama Weera Vibhushanaya, Sri Lanka's highest military award for gallantry, for his actions during the mission to assault artillery positions during Operation Jayasikurui. The award was approved over a year later in 2001. Chandrika Kumaratunga, the then President of Sri Lanka, awarded the medal to his next- of-kin on 24 April 2001. To date, Jayanath is the only Commando who has received the Parama Weera Vibhushanaya. Along with Colonel Fazly Lafir who was posthumously awarded the medal at the same time, Jayanath was one of the first members of a special operations unit and also one of the first army officers to receive the award.

The alien invaders were represented by large rubber ants purchased at a dime store for 19 cents apiece. Earthlings under mind control by the aliens were portrayed as having all-white eyes. The special effect was achieved by applying white tape to the actors' eyelids. The destruction of the alien headquarters (the TV station where Ray worked) was depicted using stock footage of a nuclear explosion from an old 16mm documentary found in the television station's film archive. =Score= The film score is a public domain recording of Moussorgsky's Pictures at an Exhibition, taken directly from a \\"cheap record album\\".

Main Street, opened in 1927. It has 700 guest rooms. The hotel has a checkered history, but as of 2017 it was being renovated and redeveloped into a mix of hotel rooms and residential units. History The Cecil was built in 1924 by hotelier William Banks Hanner, as a destination for business travelers and tourists. Designed by Loy Lester Smith in the Beaux Arts style, the hotel cost $1 million to complete and boasted an opulent marble lobby with stained-glass windows, potted palms, and alabaster statuary. Hanner had invested confidently in the enterprise, with the knowledge that several similar hotels had been established elsewhere downtown, but within five years of its opening, the United States sank into the Great Depression. Although the hotel flourished as a fashionable destination through the 1940s, the decades beyond saw the hotel decline, as the nearby area known as Skid Row became increasingly populated with transients. As many as 10,000 homeless people lived within a four-mile radius. By the 1950s, the hotel had gained a reputation as a residence for transients.Cond√© Nast Traveler article (14 December 2012) In 2007, a portion of the hotel was refurbished after new owners took over.Cond√© Nast Traveler article (14 December 2012) In 2011, the Cecil Hotel was rebranded as \\"Stay on Main\\", complete with a new website; its old website, thececilhotel.com, expired at the end of 2013. In 2014, the hotel was sold to New York City hotelier Richard Born for $30 million, and another New York-based firm, Simon Baron Development, acquired a 99-year ground lease on the property. Matt Baron, president of Simon Baron, said he was committed to the preservation of architecturally or historically significant components such as the hotel's grand lobby, but his company planned to completely redevelop the interior and fix the \\"hodgepodge\\" work that had been done in more recent years. Beyond renovating rooms, the developer also plans a rooftop pool, gym, and lounge. Construction is projected to be complete by 2021. In February 2017, the Los Angeles City Council voted to deem the Cecil a Historic-Cultural Monument, because it is representative of an early 20th century American hotel and because of the historic significance of its architect's body of work. Reputation for violence and suicide As the area where the Cecil Hotel is located began to decline, suicides and other violent deaths on the premises became more frequent. The first documented suicide at the Cecil was reported in 1931, when a guest named W.K. Norton died in his room after taking poison capsules. Throughout the 1940s and 1950s, more suicides at the Cecil occurred. By the 1960s, longtime residents had begun to call the Cecil \\"The Suicide.\\" In addition to suicides, the Cecil's history includes other kinds of violence and disturbing happenings. It also became a notorious rendezvous spot for adulterous couples, drug activity, and a common ground for sex workers. In 1947, Elizabeth Short, dubbed by the media as the Black Dahlia, was rumored to have been spotted drinking at the Cecil's bar in the days before her notorious, and to date unsolved, murder. In 1964, a retired telephone operator named \\"Pigeon Goldie\\" Osgood, who had been a well-known and well-liked long- term resident at the hotel, was found dead in her room. She had been raped, stabbed, and beaten, and her room ransacked. A man named Jacques B. Ehlinger was charged with Osgood's murder, but he was later cleared; her death remains unsolved. Perhaps most infamously, in the 1980s the hotel was rumored to be the residence of serial killer Richard Ramirez, nicknamed the \\"Night Stalker\\". Ramirez had been a regular presence on the skid row area of Los Angeles, and according to a hotel clerk who claims to have spoken to him, is rumored to have stayed at the Cecil for a few weeks. Ramirez may have engaged in part of his killing spree while staying there. Another serial killer, Austrian Jack Unterweger, stayed at the Cecil in 1991, possibly because he sought to copy Ramirez's crimes. While there, he strangled and killed at least three sex workers, for which he was convicted in Austria. He hanged himself shortly after his conviction. In 2013, the Cecil (by then re-branded as the \\"Stay on Main\\" although still maintaining the original Hotel Cecil signs and painted advertisements on its exterior) became the focus of renewed attention when surveillance footage of a young Canadian student, Elisa Lam, behaving erratically in the hotel's elevator, went viral. The video depicts Lam repeatedly pressing the elevator's buttons, walking in and out of the elevator, and possibly attempting to hide from someone. It was recorded shortly before her disappearance; her naked body was subsequently discovered in a water supply cistern on the hotel roof, following complaints from residents of odd-tasting water and low pressure. How she got into the cistern remains a mystery. The Los Angeles County Coroner ruled her death accidental due to drowning, with bipolar disorder being a \\"significant\\" factor. Cultural references On March 27, 1987, the band U2 performed an impromptu live concert on the rooftop of a one-story building on the corner of 7th and Main in Downtown Los Angeles, next door to the Cecil Hotel. The performance, with the hotel featured as a backdrop, was filmed and commercially released as a music video for the release of the band's song \\"Where the Streets Have No Name\\". The hotel is also known as the inspiration for Barton Fink. It was also the inspiration for American Horror Story season 5, \\"Hotel\\". It was the setting for The NoSleep Podcast season 3 episode, \\"The Cecil Hotel\\", which adapted a horror fiction short story loosely based on the death of Elisa Lam that took place in the hotel in 2013. The hotel can be seen in the background of Blink-182's video \\"The Rock Show\\". The song is from the group's fourth album, Take Off Your Pants and Jacket (2001).

After attending local Islamic school, he joined Hirgigo primary school which was founded by Pasha Saleh Ahmed Kekia in 1944. After finishing elementary and middle school he traveled to Addis Ababa to complete his secondary school and attend teacher training college. While in Addis Ababa, he was active in establishing a Muslim student association. After graduating from teacher training college, he returned to Hirgigo and worked as a teacher and later a principal of the school. Osman understood the importance of education and the lack of proper education institutes in Eritrea and especially in the lowlands of Eritrea, therefore he used to encourage and send his students to Sudan and Egypt in pursuit of further education. Osman Saleh Sabbe has six children (2 sons and 4 daughters) & his brother Mahmoud Saleh Sabbe was one of the ELF prisoners who was freed by ELF operation from Adi Quala prison in February 1975. Exile In the late 1940s and early 1950s during his time in Addis Ababa, Eritrean politics was in a crossroad, where Eritrean nationalist movement was springing. Like many Eritrean patriot Osman had a strong stand on the need for Eritrean independence and his activities were put under surveillance by the Ethiopian authorities and forced to exile to Aden, Yemen in 1960. Revolutionary leaders such as Romadan Mohammed Nur, Alamin Mohammed Said and Ibrahim Affa that made great contribution towards the struggle of Eritrean Independence were some of his students from Hirghigo School., Historical Dictionary of Eritrea, By Dan Connell, Tom Killio Osman Saleh Sabbe died of a sudden illness in 1987 in a hospital in Cairo, Egypt. Political life Osman dedicated his life to the struggle of Eritrean independence and became the backbone of Eritrean revolution during the dark and desperate years. After exile, Osman focused his activity in bringing follow Eritreans in exile into strengthening the fight for independence agenda. During this time Osman had participated in the Eritrean Liberation Front (ELF) leadership and was appointed as head of foreign affair. He succeeded in raising awareness of the Eritrean struggle for independence across the Middleastern and African countries such as Yemen, Somalia, Saudi Arabia, Egypt, and Syria. Achievements Some of Osman's achievements were 1\\\\. Creating awareness and sympathy to Eritreans and Eritrean cause across the world, Fifteen Years on grievous Absence of Martyr: Osman Saleh Sabbe 2\\\\. Proving full military logistic supply to Eritrean Liberation Army from friendly countries across the world 3\\\\. Enabling Somalian government to issue Somali diplomatic passport to Eritrean revolutionary leaders 4\\\\. Enabling Eritrean refugees in the Mideast and North Africa to get residence permit 5\\\\.

Together with the Ankogel Group, Goldberg Group, Glockner Group, Schober Group, Kreuzeck Group, Granatspitze Group, Venediger Group and the Villgraten Mountains the group is part of the High Tauern. The Rieserferner mountains extend across the Austrian state of Tyrol and the Italian province of South Tyrol (Trentino-South Tyrol region). The mountains mainly lie in South Tyrol, where the greater part is protected within the Rieserferner-Ahrn Nature Park. The Rieserferner Group forms the southwesternmost part of the High Tauern, its foothills running towards the southwest as far as Bruneck in the Puster Valley. Its name is derived from the Rieserferner, a glacier on the northern flank between the Hochgall (highest summit in the range at ) and the Schneebiger Nock (). The Rieserferner Group is rather small in comparison with other Alpine ranges. It is, however, popular with climbers and hikers due to its prominent and steep, partly glaciated summits.  Neighbouring ranges  The Rieserferner Group is bounded by the following other mountain ranges of the Alps: * Venediger Group (to the north) * Villgraten Mountains (to the southeast) * Dolomites (to the south) * Zillertal Alps (to the west)  Boundary  To the north, the Klammljoch saddle forms the boundary. In the east it runs from there along the valley of the Arventalbach past the Jagdhausalm to its confluence with the Schwarzach. In the west the boundary of the range runs from the Klammljoch along the Klammlbach stream until it joins the Knuttenbach. In the east the boundary continues along the Schwarzach until its confluence with the Staller Almbach. In the southeast and south it runs along the Staller Almbach to the Staller Saddle. From there it goes along the Antholz valley to Olang in the Pustertal and downstream along the Rienz to Bruneck. In the west the boundary is formed by the valleys of the Tauferer Tal and the Reintal.

In this instance, simulators are special purpose devices designed to provide insight about specific physics problems.

Quantum simulators may be contrasted with generally programmable \\"digital\\" quantum computers, which would be capable of solving a wider class of quantum problems. A universal quantum simulator is a quantum computer proposed by Yuri Manin in 1980 and Richard Feynman in 1982. Feynman showed that a classical Turing machine would experience an exponential slowdown when simulating quantum phenomena, while his hypothetical universal quantum simulator would not. David Deutsch in 1985, took the ideas further and described a universal quantum computer. In 1996, Seth Lloyd showed that a standard quantum computer can be programmed to simulate any local quantum system efficiently. A quantum system of many particles is described by a Hilbert space whose dimension is exponentially large in the number of particles. Therefore, the obvious approach to simulate such a system requires exponential time on a classical computer. However, it is conceivable that a quantum system of many particles could be simulated by a quantum computer using a number of quantum bits similar to the number of particles in the original system. As shown by Lloyd, this is true for a class of quantum systems known as local quantum systems. This has been extended to much larger classes of quantum systems. Quantum simulators have been realized on a number of experimental platforms, including systems of ultracold quantum gases, polar molecules, trapped ions, photonic systems, quantum dots, and superconducting circuits.Nature Physics Insight ‚Äì Quantum Simulation. Nature.com. April 2012. Solving physics problems Many important problems in physics, especially low-temperature physics and many-body physics, remain poorly understood because the underlying quantum mechanics is vastly complex. Conventional computers, including supercomputers, are inadequate for simulating quantum systems with as few as 30 particles. Better computational tools are needed to understand and rationally design materials whose properties are believed to depend on the collective quantum behavior of hundreds of particles. Quantum simulators provide an alternative route to understanding the properties of these systems. These simulators create clean realizations of specific systems of interest, which allows precise realizations of their properties. Precise control over and broad tunability of parameters of the system allows the influence of various parameters to be cleanly disentangled. Quantum simulators can solve problems which are difficult to simulate on classical computers because they directly exploit quantum properties of real particles. In particular, they exploit a property of quantum mechanics called superposition, wherein a quantum particle is made to be in two distinct states at the same time, for example, aligned and anti- aligned with an external magnetic field. Crucially, simulators also take advantage of a second quantum property called entanglement, allowing the behavior of even physically well separated particles to be correlated. Trapped-Ion Simulators A trapped-ion simulator, built by a team that included the NIST and reported in April 2012, can engineer and control interactions among hundreds of quantum bits (qubits). Previous endeavors were unable to go beyond 30 quantum bits. As described in the scientific journal Nature, the capability of this simulator is 10 times more than previous devices. Also, it has passed a series of important benchmarking tests that indicate a capability to solve problems in material science that are impossible to model on conventional computers. The trapped-ion simulator consists of a tiny, single-plane crystal of hundreds of beryllium ions, less than 1 millimeter in diameter, hovering inside a device called a Penning trap. The outermost electron of each ion acts as a tiny quantum magnet and is used as a qubit, the quantum equivalent of a ‚Äú1‚Äù or a ‚Äú0‚Äù in a conventional computer. In the benchmarking experiment, physicists used laser beams to cool the ions to near absolute zero. Carefully timed microwave and laser pulses then caused the qubits to interact, mimicking the quantum behavior of materials otherwise very difficult to study in the laboratory. Although the two systems may outwardly appear dissimilar, their behavior is engineered to be mathematically identical. In this way, simulators allow researchers to vary parameters that couldn‚Äôt be changed in natural solids, such as atomic lattice spacing and geometry. Friedenauer et al., adiabatically manipulated 2 spins, showing their separation into ferromagnetic and antiferromagnetic states. Kim et al., extended the trapped ion quantum simulator to 3 spins, with global antiferromagnetic Ising interactions featuring frustration and showing the link between frustration and entanglement and Islam et al., used adiabatic quantum simulation to demonstrate the sharpening of a phase transition between paramagnetic and ferromagnetic ordering as the number of spins increased from 2 to 9. Barreiro et al. created a digital quantum simulator of interacting spins with up to 5 trapped ions by coupling to an open reservoir and Lanyon et al. demonstrated digital quantum simulation with up to 6 ions. Islam, et al., demonstrated adiabatic quantum simulation of the transverse Ising model with variable (long) range interactions with up to 18 trapped ion spins, showing control of the level of spin frustration by adjusting the antiferromagnetic interaction range. Britton, et al. from NIST has experimentally benchmarked Ising interactions in a system of hundreds of qubits for studies of quantum magnetism. Pagano, et al., reported a new cryogenic ion trapping system designed for long time storage of large ion chains demonstrating coherent one and two-qubit operations for chains of up to 44 ions. Ultracold Atom Simulators Many ultracold atom experiments are examples of quantum simulators. These include experiments studying bosons or fermions in optical lattices, the unitary Fermi gas, Rydberg atom arrays in optical tweezers. A common thread for these experiments is the capability of realizing generic Hamiltonians, such as the Hubbard or transverse-field Ising Hamiltonian. Major aims of these experiments include identifying low-temperature phases or tracking out-of-equilibrium dynamics for various models, problems which are theoretically and numerically intractable. Other experiments have realized condensed matter models in regimes which are difficult or impossible to realize with conventional materials, such as the Haldane model and the Harper- Hofstadter model. Superconducting Qubits Quantum simulators using superconducting qubits fall into two main categories. First, so called quantum annealers determine ground states of certain Hamiltonians after an adiabatic ramp. This approach is sometimes called adiabatic quantum computing. Second, many systems emulate specific Hamiltonians and study their ground state properties, quantum phase transitions, or time dynamics. Several important recent results include the realization of a Mott insulator in a driven- dissipative Bose-Hubbard system and studies of phase transitions in lattices of superconducting resonators coupled to qubits.

Biography Gabbana was born in Milan to a father who worked in a printing factory and a mother who worked for a laundry service. His family is from Veneto: his father was born in Ceggia and his mother in Cessalto. He graduated from the Istituto Superiore per le Industrie Artistiche, a design institute in Rome. Career Dolce & Gabbana store in Shanghai In 1980, Gabbana met Sicilian Domenico Dolce through Dolce's employer, designer Giorgio Correggiari. Correggiari, who died in 2012, was extremely influential on the pair, Gabbana said in 2013: \\"He was not very famous. But for us he was important. He taught us especially what 'not' to do.\\" In 1983, Gabbana and Dolce left Correggiari to work on their own; two years later, they launched Dolce & Gabbana S.p.A. (D&G;). In October 1985, the Dolce & Gabbana brand made its fashion show debut at Milano Collezioni's Nuovi Talenti (New Talents). In March 1986, D&G; released its first collection and held its own show, \\"Real Women.\\" In 1987, the first D&G; store opened in Milan, at 7 Via Santa Cecilia. In 1988, D&G; established a partnership with Dolce's father, Saverio, who owned the manufacturing company Dolce Saverio in Legnano, near Milan. D&G; continued to expand, holding its first fashion shows in Tokyo (April 1989) and New York (April 1990), and releasing new collection lines, including its first lingerie and beachwear line in July 1989, and its first menswear line in January 1990. In November 1990, D&G; opened its New York City showroom at 532 Broadway in SoHo, Manhattan. D&G; released its first fragrance, Dolce & Gabbana Parfum, in October 1992. In 1993, the Italian designers received worldwide fame when Madonna chose D&G; to design the costumes for her Girlie Show World Tour. They have since gone on to design for Monica Bellucci, Kylie Minogue, Angelina Jolie and Isabella Rossellini. Later additions to the D&G; line included ties, belts, handbags, sunglasses, watches and footwear. By 2003, the company sold more products in Italy than Armani, Gucci, Prada, and Versace. In 2009, nearly 25 years after D&G; opened, the company had 113 stores and 21 factory outlets, a staff of 3,500 people and an annual turnover of more than ‚Ç¨1 billion. Personal life Gabbana and Dolce were an open couple for many years. Following their success, they lived in a 19th-century villa in Milan, and owned several properties on the French Riviera. They ended their long-time relationship in 2003, but the pair still work together at D&G.; As of March 2015, Gabbana was the 28th richest person in Italy with a net worth of approximately US$1.56 billion, according to Forbes. =Legal troubles= In 2013, both Stefano Gabbana and Domenico Dolce were convicted of tax evasion and sentenced to a 20-month suspended sentence in prison. An Italian court found the pair guilty of failing to declare millions of euros of revenue earned through a D&G; subsidiary company, Gado, based in Luxembourg. They denied the charges and appealed the case; in October 2014 they were both cleared of wrongdoing by the appellate court. =IVF position= In March 2015, singer-songwriter Elton John called for a boycott of the D&G; brand after Dolce referred to babies born through in vitro fertilization as \\"chemistry children and synthetic children\\" in an interview. This sparked a war of words, with Gabbana later calling John a \\"fascist\\" and calling for a counter-boycott. However, he later clarified that his views on IVF were separate from that of Dolce. When asked on CNN whether he supported IVF, he responded: \\"Yeah, I don't have anything bad (to say), because the beauty of the world is freedom\\" and \\"We love gay couple. We are gay. We love gay couple. We love gay adoption. We love everything. It's just an express of my private point of view.\\" = Sinophobic comments on Instagram = On 21 November 2018, Gabbana was publicly exposed on Instagram for making racially charged comments regarding China, including \\"China ignorant dirty smelling mafia\\" and calling China \\"a country of shit\\".Morwenna Ferrier, \\"Dolce & Gabbana postpones Shanghai show amid racism row\\", The Guardian, Wed 21 Nov 2018.Associated Press, \\"Dolce & Gabbana calls off China show amid accusations of racism on social media\\", NBC News, 21 Nov. 2018.

Along with Stefano Gabbana, he is one half of the luxury fashion house Dolce & Gabbana (D&G;). Since founding D&G; in 1985, Dolce has become one of the world's most influential fashion designers and an industry icon. Early life and education Dolce was born in Polizzi Generosa, Sicily, in 1958. His father was a tailor and his mother sold fabrics and apparel. He moved to Milan to attend the fashion design school Istituto Marangoni, but he dropped out before graduating, confident he knew enough to work in the industry. His dream was to work for Armani. Career Dolce & Gabbana store in Kobe, Japan In 1980, Dolce met Stefano Gabbana through Dolce's employer, designer Giorgio Correggiari. In 1983, Gabbana and Dolce left Correggiari to work on their own; two years later, they launched Dolce & Gabbana S.p.A. (D&G;). In October 1985, the Dolce & Gabbana brand made its fashion show debut at Milano Collezioni's Nuovi Talenti (New Talents). In March 1986, D&G; released its first collection and held its own show, \\"Real Women.\\" In 1987, the first D&G; store opened in Milan, at 7 Via Santa Cecilia. In 1988, D&G; established a partnership with Dolce's father, Saverio, who owned the manufacturing company Dolce Saverio in Legnano, near Milan. D&G; continued to expand, holding its first fashion shows in Tokyo (April 1989) and New York (April 1990), and releasing new collection lines, including its first lingerie and beachwear line in July 1989, and its first menswear line in January 1990. In November 1990, D&G; opened its New York City showroom at 532 Broadway in SoHo, Manhattan. D&G; released its first fragrance, Dolce & Gabbana Parfum, in October 1992. In 1993, the Italian designers received worldwide fame when Madonna chose D&G; to design the costumes for her Girlie Show World Tour. They have since gone on to design for Monica Bellucci, Kylie Minogue, Angelina Jolie and Isabella Rossellini. Later additions to the D&G; line included ties, belts, handbags, sunglasses, watches and footwear. By 2003, the company sold more products in Italy than Armani, Gucci, Prada, and Versace. In 2009, nearly 25 years after D&G; opened, the company had 113 stores and 21 factory outlets, a staff of 3,500 people and an annual turnover of more than ‚Ç¨1 billion. Personal life Dolce & Gabbana were an open couple for many years. Following their success, they lived in a 19th-century villa in Milan, and owned several properties on the French Riviera. They ended their long-time relationship in 2003, but the pair still work together at D&G.; As of October 2015, Dolce was the 27th richest person in Italy with a net worth of approximately US$1.74 billion, according to Forbes. =Legal troubles= In 2013, both Domenico Dolce and Stefano Gabbana were convicted of tax evasion and sentenced to a 20-month suspended sentence in prison. An Italian court found the pair guilty of failing to declare millions of euros of revenue earned through a D&G; subsidiary company, Gado, based in Luxembourg. They denied the charges and appealed the case; in October 2014, they were both cleared of wrongdoing by the appellate court. =IVF position= In March 2015, Dolce's comments about in vitro fertilization (IVF) sparked a social media storm of criticism. In an interview with Panorama magazine, Dolce said, \\"I am gay. I cannot have a child. I believe you cannot have everything in life.... You are born from a father and a mother. Or at least that is how it should be. For this reason I am not convinced by what I call children of chemistry, or synthetic children. Uteruses for rent, sperm chosen from a catalogue.\\" British singer-songwriter Elton John, who has children by IVF with his husband David Furnish, called for a boycott of the D&G; brand. This sparked a war of words, with Gabbana later calling John a \\"fascist\\" and calling for a counter-boycott.

A worker collects effloresced saltpetre from deposits, transporting it then to be concentrated in the factory (A) boilers. A nitrary is a place of production of potassium nitrate or saltpetre used primarily for the manufacture of gunpowder. The saltpetre occurs naturally in certain places like the \\"Caves of Salnitre\\" (Collbat√≥) known since the Neolithic. In the \\"Cova del Rat Penat\\", guano (bat excrements) deposited over thousands of years became saltpetre after being leached by the action of rainwater.  Manufacture  The process involved burial of excrements (human or animal) in the fields prepared for that purpose beside the nitraries, watering them and waiting until the leaching process did its job; after a certain time, operators gathered the saltpetre that \\"came out\\" to the ground surface by efflorescence. Then they transported it to be concentrated by ebullition in the boiler plant.  History  Besides \\"Montepellusanus\\", during the thirteenth century (and beyond) the only supply of saltpetre across Christian Europe (according to \\"De Alchimia\\" in 3 manuscripts of Michael Scot, 1180‚Äì1236) was \\"found in Spain in Aragon in a certain mountain near the sea.\\" In fact in 1561, Elizabeth I of England at war with Philip II of Spain, became unable to import the saltpetre (of which the Kingdom of England had no home production), and had to pay \\"300 pounds gold\\" to the German captain Gerrard Honrik for the manual \\"Instructions for making salpetre to growe\\" (the secret of the \\"Feuerwerkbuch\\" -the nitraries-).SP Dom Elizabeth vol.xvi 29-30 (1589) In 1783, Giuseppe Maria Giovene and Alberto Fortis together discovered a \\"natural nitrary\\" in a doline close to Molfetta, Italy, whose name is Pulo di Molfetta. The two scientists discovered that saltpetre formed inside the walls of the caves of the doline, under certain conditions of humidity and temperature.necrologio-giovene, pag. 39 Prior to the discovery, nitraries were widespread all over the Kingdom of Naples. Manure was collected by the government and used to make saltpetre, which was a key ingredient for gunpowder. After the discovery, it was suggested that manure could be used for agriculture, in order to increase the production, rather than to make gunpowder. The discovery also generated issues; in particular, it was initially challenged by some scholars. Subsequently, chemist Giuseppe Vairo and his pupil Antonio Pitaro confirmed the discovery. This undoubtedly damaged producers of artificial saltpetre, and some scholars, most likely supported by the producers, tried to dismiss the discovery. Following the above discovery, naturalists sent by academies from all Europe came in large number to visit Pulo di Molfetta, since the saltpeter was a fundamental ingredient in the production of gunpowder and these deposits were of considerable strategic interest.elogio-storico, pagg. 8-10 Soon, the government started to extract saltpetre from Pulo di Molfetta and today the doline still contains the remains of the ancient plant used to extract saltpetre, making it a site of industrial archaeology. Pulo di Molfetta is currently not open to tourists.

The club was found not guilty of charges related to tanking, but senior coach Dean Bailey and general manager of football operations Chris Connolly were both found guilty of related charges. Background In August 2012, AFL Integrity Officer Brett Clothier announced a full investigation into Melbourne's 2009 season, regarding allegations that the Demons had tanked games during the season in order to secure a priority draft pick that year, available to clubs winning fewer than five games. The press had published such allegations previously, but the investigation was prompted most specifically by statements from former Melbourne player Brock McLean during a television interview in July 2012, when he revealed that he requested to be traded from the club at the end of 2009 because he was dissatisfied with its match strategies during that time. Melbourne club officials, led by board chairman Don McLardy, denied the tanking allegations. Then-coach Dean Bailey had previously made statements, interpreted by some as an admission of tanking, at the press conference which followed his sacking as coach in August 2011.Demons sack Dean Bailey AFL Fox Sports Bailey was quoted as saying: =Notable matches in question= Throughout the AFL's investigation into Melbourne's 2009 season, three matches in particular were investigated: * Round 17, 2009 vs Sydney Swans: Coach Dean Bailey made seven changes to the team that was defeated by by 46 points the previous week. In the match, Melbourne made 67 interchange rotations, down from its season average of 85. * Round 18, 2009 vs : Richmond came from three goals behind to win a very close match by four points after Jordan McMahon kicked the match winning goal after the final siren. During the match, coach Dean Bailey placed several players in unusual positions. These included placing ruckman Paul Johnson and midfielder James McDonald in the backline; playing forward Brad Miller in the ruck; placing defenders James Frawley and Matthew Warnock in the forward line, as well as leaving Russell Robertson and Colin Sylvia out of the game for Michael Newton and rookie Jake Spencer. The Herald Sun later accused Bailey of making these changes during the match in an attempt to throw the match. * Round 22, 2009 vs : Dean Bailey moved James Frawley off St Kilda forward Nick Riewoldt, despite Frawley having limited Riewoldt's effect on the game; he shifted Lynden Dunn onto Riewoldt, and Riewoldt kicked three goals before Frawley was reassigned to him; by that time, Melbourne was in a position where it was unable to win the match. Additionally, Liam Jurrah was benched in the third quarter despite kicking two goals; he did not return to the field until late in the final quarter. Outcome The investigation lasted 203 days and Clothier interviewed over 50 people associated with the club. The league released its findings in February 2013, and found the club not guilty of tanking. However, it did find Dean Bailey and then-general manager of football operations Chris Connolly guilty of \\"acting in a manner prejudicial to the interests of the competition\\". This related most specifically to a meeting in July 2009, which became known colloquially as \\"the vault\\", in which Connolly allegedly openly discussed the potential benefits to the club of tanking. The guilty parties received the following penalties: * Connolly, who was still at the club in 2013 but serving in a role outside the football department, was suspended outright from serving in any position at any club until 1 February 2014; he was subsequently sacked by the club in October 2013 though this was not directly linked to the tanking scandal.Connolly sacked by Melbourne, The Age, 11 October 2013 * Bailey, serving in 2013 as an assistant coach at the Adelaide Crows, was suspended from his position for the first sixteen weeks of the 2013 season, preventing him from having any contact with the Crows' playing group during that time. * The Melbourne Football Club, which was complicit to the infraction in its capacity as Connolly's and Bailey's employer, was fined $500,000. None of Melbourne, Connolly or Bailey contested these penalties.

It is considered holy, as per Hindu mythology and many Hindus prefer to bathe and immerse the ashes and the bones left after cremation of dead bodies, here at Damodar Kund due to a belief that the departed souls would get moksha here. It may be mentioned here other such famous places for immersion of ashes and bones ( Hindu rite of asthi-visarjana ) are in Ganga at Haridwar and Triveni Sangam at Prayag.At the Three Rivers TIME, February 23, 1948. The water of the lake has properties of dissolving the bones. The lake is 257 ft long and 50 ft broad and only 5 feet deep. It is surrounded by a well built ghat. The steps for going up the Girnar hills start near Damodar Kund. At the foothills of Ashwatthama Hill in Girnar mountain range base, southerly to Damodara Kund is the Damodar Hari Temple. The idols here are supposed to have been installed by Vajranabha, the grandson of Lord Shri Krishna, the one who also is credited with Dwarkadhish Temple and many other. Historically, these temples are supposed to have been built or renovated by a Suryavanshi ruler named Chandraketpur, who is also accredited to have built the temples of Shiva at Bhavnath, a testament to his tolerance for all belief systems. The place underwent renovation during the regime of King Skand Gupta of Gupta dynasty in the year 462 AD. Lord Damodar here is considered by vaishnavaits as Adhipati of Girnar Kshetra. Covering an area of 32 acres, the temple is constructed using pink sandstone and consists of an inner Nij Mandir and an outer Solaha Mandapa, each topped with a Shikar, supported by an array of around 84 exquisitely carved pillars. Nij mandir's shikhar is 65 feet tall and the sabhha Mandap's shikhar is 30 feet tall. The statue of Damodarji is found in the form of Chaturbhuj, each arm holding a conch, discus, mace and lotus, along with Sri Radha Rani. Both the idols are sculpted from black stone and are heavily decorated with gold and silk. There are other sub shrines dedicated to Lord Balarama, Sri Revati and Lord Ganesha. There are several other ancient temples nearby with on and outside temple complex. Devotees are seen taking a holy dip in the sacred bathing tank, Damodar Kund, before offering prayers at the temple. The sewa of Shri Damodarji is being performed here in the Samprant-Yug by Vaishnav tradition. Shri Damodarji is the Ishtdev of the Giri Narayan Brahmin community and several other local communities. As per the traditional belief, Giri Narayan community is living here since around 12000 years ago. The Damodar Kund is closely attached to the life of Narsinh Mehta, the famous 15th century Gujarati poet and devotee of Krishna, who used to come to bathe at Damodar Kund and is said to have written many of his prabhatiyas (morning prayers), in the natural surrounding here at the Damodar lake, at picturesque foothills of Girnar. At present, there is also a temple of Narsinh Mehta, which is built near temple of Damodar, to commemorate the association of this great saint-poet with Damodar Kund and ancient temple of Damodar here. This temple was built in decade of 1890 during reign of Nawab Sir Muhammad Bahadur Khan III at behest of his Diwan Haridas Viharidas Desai, who used to public money by organizing lottery to build the temple and foot steps leading up the mount Girnar.Census of India, 1961: Gujarat published by India. Office of the Registrar General, 1965, pp 818. Narsinh Mehta in one of his verses mentions this fact as quoting self as under :- Close to Damodara Kund, on the westerly to the Damodarji temple is Revati Kund. The kund is 52 ft long, 52 feet broad and 37 feet deep. Because of the depth dip here is not safe for all. Revati, who was the daughter of King Raiwat, took form from the fires of pruthesthi yagna. It is said that Raivata Kakudmin or simply Kakudmi left Dwarka and moved to Girnar Hill after Revati was married to Lord Balarama. Hence, mount Girnar was also known as Raivatachal, Raivatgiri, Revatak Parvat or simply Raivata. And Junagadh was also referred to similarly. Baithakji of MahaPrabhuji is located close to Revati Kund. The founder of Pushti Sampradaya Shrimad Vallabhacharayaji (MahaPrabhuji) once visited Damodar pilgrim, where he remitted the shrimad Bhagwat. This is 64th seat of Shri Mahaprabhuji. Close to Revati kund is another mythological place, cave of Muchukunda. The cave has a temple of Lord Krishna, and a Shiv Linga established either by Lord Krishna himself or by Muchkundh. This is the place where Kalayavan, the great Yavana or Greek warrior king, who was chasing Lord Krishna was killed by Muchukunda's gaze in the Indian epic MahƒÅbhƒÅrata. There is another holy lake, Mrigi Kund located nearby in Bhavnath temple premises. Hindus prefer to bathe in all these lakes to get rid of their sins.Fairs and Festivals of India: Chhattisgarh, Dadra and Nagar Haveli, Daman and Diu, Goa, Gujarat, Madhya Pradesh, Maharashtra by Madan Prasad Bezbaruah, Dr. Krishna Gopal, Phal S.

Alternate spellings (romanizations) include \\"Ougonkan\\" or \\"Ogon-kan\\". It has also been called \\"Golden orange\\" in Kanagawa Prefecture.  History  The variety has long been known in Kagoshima Prefecture as but, precise origins are unknown.. This source further cites: , , and According to one assertion, it has been known in Higashi-ichiki-ch≈ç (ja) and its neighborhood (now Hioki, Kagoshima) since the Meiji Period. Anecdotally in this Hioki area, it has been told that the variety was either introduced by the Jesuit Francisco de Xavier, or brought back from the Korean Peninsula during the campaigns in the late 16th century (Hideyoshi's invasions of Korea).. It has been suggested that the name \\"≈ågonkan\\" was dubbed by who introduced the variety to Ehime Prefecture, but this too is poorly documented.  Fruit  The small fruit has a diameter of 4 to 5 cm, weighing 60 to 80 g. The rind, which is bright yellow, can be peeled by hand but with difficulty. It issues a distinct fragrance, and is considerably sweet tasting, with some balancing acidity. Harvested from February to April. Seedless (Self-incompatibility) traits have been observed. Its fragrances is similar to the Hyuganatsu, which is another bright yellow citrus that is larger-sized, but somewhat sweeter by comparison. And like the Hyuganatsu, the white pith (albedo) may be eaten. The rind's cold-pressed oil has been studied for fragrance factors, and was found to contain limonene (roughly 80%), followed by the monoterpene Gamma-terpinene (10%), trans beta- farnesene, and myrcene, showing similarity to Hyuganatsu's peel profile, though with quantitative differences in concentrations.

She never ceased to defend the honor of her husband.Philippe Bourdrel, Histoire des juifs de France, Vol. 1, Albin Michel, 7 janvier 2004, 464p.  Life  The Hadamard family hailed from Koblenz, and spread to Metz and then settled, in the early nineteenth century, in Paris. David Hadamard, Lucie's father, was a diamond merchant in Paris. The couple organized many receptions. In one of them, Lucie met Alfred Dreyfus, a classmate of her cousin Paul Hadamard. The couple became engaged during the winter of 1889-1890. They were married in Paris on 18 April 1891, celebrated at the Grand Synagogue of Paris, on the 21st by the Chief Rabbi of France, Zadoc Kahn who stood with the Dreyfusards afterwards. The couple moved near the Champs-√âlys√©es, at Rue Fran√ßois-Ier. They went on a honeymoon trip to Italy and then to Switzerland, before returning by making a stop in Mulhouse. The couple had two children, Pierre-L√©on (1891-1946) and Jeanne (1893-1981). Lucie was interested in literature, played the piano and kept reading her favorite historian: Numa Denis Fustel de Coulanges. = Dreyfus affair = In 1894, her husband was arrested, the Dreyfus Affair breaks out. She addressed a petition to the chamber and a petition to the Pope on the 16 September 1896. Called as a witness by Emile Zola, President Delegorgue refused that she be heard. She saw her request for revision of 3 September 1898 be accepted.Oeuvres de Jean Jaur√®s: L'Affaire Dreyfus, Fayard, 13 juin 2001, 902 p. Lucie visited her husband daily in Parisian prisons and then on the √éle de R√©. She has an important correspondence with her husband, even when he is exiled to Devil's Island. Alfred, Lucie, Pierre L√©on and Jeanne She published some letters to raise public awareness of the innocence of her husband. She was in Rennes and waited for his appearance during his second trial on 1 July 1899. He was sentenced again to ten years of imprisonment. On the 19 September 1899, √âmile Loubet granted him a presidential pardon. On the 29th, √âmile Zola wrote in L'Aurore an open letter to Madame Alfred Dreyfus: It was necessary to wait until 12 July 1903, Zola had been dead since nearly four years, so that the judgment of Rennes could be broken without referral. Her husband was finally rehabilitated, and rejoined the army and was knighted the Legion of Honor on 21 July 1903. Throughout the proceedings, she has left the conduct of the defense of her husband to his brother-in-law, Mathieu Dreyfus. In her correspondence with her friend, H√©l√®ne Naville, with humility, she calls her: During the First World War, she volunteered, and in 1933, she obtained a nursing certificate. Alfred Dreyfus died in Paris of a heart attack on 12 July 1935. She survived him for more than ten years. During the Second World War, Lucie is hosted in a convent in Valencia under the name of Madame Duteil where only the mother superior knew her true identity. Her granddaughter, Madeleine Levy, Jeanne's daughter, was arrested by French police in Toulouse. She was deported to the East, and died of typhus in Auschwitz in January 1944, aged 25.

It states that, if G is a 2-vertex-connected graph, then the square of G is Hamiltonian. it is named after Herbert Fleischner, who published its proof in 1974. Definitions and statement An undirected graph G is Hamiltonian if it contains a cycle that touches each of its vertices exactly once. It is 2-vertex-connected if it does not have an articulation vertex, a vertex whose deletion would leave the remaining graph disconnected. Not every 2-vertex- connected graph is Hamiltonian; counterexamples include the Petersen graph and the complete bipartite graph K2,3. The square of G is a graph G2 that has the same vertex set as G, and in which two vertices are adjacent if and only if they have distance at most two in G. Fleischner's theorem states that the square of a finite 2-vertex-connected graph with at least three vertices must always be Hamiltonian. Equivalently, the vertices of every 2-vertex-connected graph G may be arranged into a cyclic order such that adjacent vertices in this order are at distance at most two from each other in G. Extensions In Fleischner's theorem, it is possible to constraint the Hamiltonian cycle in G2 so that for given vertices v and w of G it includes two edges of G incident with v and one edge of G incident with w. Moreover, if v and w are adjacent in G, then these are three different edges of G.; . In addition to having a Hamiltonian cycle, the square of a 2-vertex-connected graph G must also be Hamiltonian connected (meaning that it has a Hamiltonian path starting and ending at any two designated vertices) and 1-Hamiltonian (meaning that if any vertex is deleted, the remaining graph still has a Hamiltonian cycle).; It must also be vertex pancyclic, meaning that for every vertex v and every integer k with 3 ‚â§ k ‚â§ |V(G)|, there exists a cycle of length k containing v., answering a conjecture of . If a graph G is not 2-vertex-connected, then its square may or may not have a Hamiltonian cycle, and determining whether it does have one is NP-complete.; . An infinite graph cannot have a Hamiltonian cycle, because every cycle is finite, but Carsten Thomassen proved that if G is an infinite locally finite 2-vertex-connected graph with a single end then G2 necessarily has a doubly infinite Hamiltonian path. More generally, if G is locally finite, 2-vertex-connected, and has any number of ends, then G2 has a Hamiltonian circle. In a compact topological space formed by viewing the graph as a simplicial complex and adding an extra point at infinity to each of its ends, a Hamiltonian circle is defined to be a subspace that is homeomorphic to a Euclidean circle and covers every vertex.; . Algorithms The Hamiltonian cycle in the square of an n-vertex 2-connected graph can be found in linear time , improving over the first algorithmic solution by Lau; . of running time O(n2). Fleischner's theorem can be used to provide a 2-approximation to the bottleneck traveling salesman problem in metric spaces.; . History A proof of Fleischner's theorem was announced by Herbert Fleischner in 1971 and published by him in 1974, solving a 1966 conjecture of Crispin Nash-Williams also made independently by L. W. Beineke and Michael D. Plummer.. For the earlier conjectures see Fleischner and . In his review of Fleischner's paper, Nash-Williams wrote that it had solved \\"a well known problem which has for several years defeated the ingenuity of other graph-theorists\\".. Fleischner's original proof was complicated. V√°clav Chv√°tal, in the work in which he invented graph toughness, observed that the square of a k-vertex-connected graph is necessarily k-tough; he conjectured that 2-tough graphs are Hamiltonian, from which another proof of Fleischner's theorem would have followed.; . Counterexamples to this conjecture were later discovered, but the possibility that a finite bound on toughness might imply Hamiltonicity remains an important open problem in graph theory. A simpler proof both of Fleischner's theorem, and of its extensions by , was given by ,; . and another simplified proof of the theorem was given by .; .

It is active during the night hours, and is able, when threatened, to swiftly burrow beneath the sand. It feeds mainly on mollusks such as clams, steadying them with its legs and then, using its pincers, either prising the valves apart or breaking them. Distribution This species can be found in Mombasa, Seychelles, Aldabra Island, Madagascar, Mauritius, Andamans, Japan, Taiwan, Borocay, Palau, Indonesia, Papua New Guinea, Shark Bay, Abrolhos Islands, New Caledonia, Hawaiian Islands, Marquesas, Society Islands.

The two villages are administrated separately but are physically contiguous with the main demarkation between them being the Bassi Pathana Road which passes between them. History Kalaur's exact origins are not known but it is considered one of the oldest villages in the area due to its size and also because there can be found remains of older settlements when digging underground. Nandpur is a relatively much newer settlement, while its exact settlement date is not known, it is at least 300 years old as the village was already settled during the lifetime of Guru Tegh Bahadur, the 9th Guru of Sikhs. Guru Tegh Bahadur, while on his way to Delhi where he was eventually executed, stayed and rested in Nandpur. To commemorate this event, there was a Sikh Gurudwara located in Nandpur known as Bhora Sahib. In the 2000s, the Shiromani Gurdwara Parbandhak Committee, took control of the Gurudwara on basis of historical grounds. The old Gurudwara, which is now completely underground due to centuries of settlement around it, was closed up and a new Gurudwara commemorating Guru Tegh Bahadur was built beside it. Nandpur receives its name from Nando Kaur, who was the daughter of a large Jat landowner in Kalaur. She was married to a farmer from the village Sujapur, located in Ludhiana district some 90 km to the west of Nandpur. While it is no longer known why, Nando and her husband and his extended family eventually moved and settled to the south of Kalaur and started farming Nando's fathers' lands. As a result, most of the Jatt residents of Nandpur have Hans ( ‡®π‡®æ‡®Ç‡®∏, ‡§π‡§æ‡§Ç‡§∏) family name which is not found elsewhere in Fatehgarh Sahib but is common in Sujapur and surrounding area.  Demographics  According to Census India 2011, Nandpur has a population of 2880 while Kalaur has a population of 2106. Even separately, Nandpur and Kalaur the 2nd and 3rd largest villages in Bassi Pathana Tehsil. Nandpur & Kalaur are located 8.4 km from Bassi Pathana and 14.5 km from Fatehgarh Sahib.

The Future of Health and Fitness. The Next Web. Retrieved from https://thenextweb.com/insider/2011/09/17/the-future-of-fitness-and-health/ (21 February 2013). Runtastic develops activity tracker apps and services such as training logs, detailed data analysis, comparisons to other users, and many more functions to help users improve their overall fitness. On 5 August 2015, adidas bought Runtastic for ‚Ç¨220 million ($240 million). On 25 September 2019, the Runtastic channels were rebranded to adidas Runtastic. History The first owner in history was Sovar. The initial idea was born during a project at the University of Applied Sciences Upper Austria for tracking sailboat races. As the target group was too small, the founders decided to focus on more popular sports, such as: running, biking, or walking. Subsequently, Florian Gschwandtner, Christian Kaar, Ren√© Giretzlehner, and Alfred Luger founded the company, Runtastic, in October 2009 in Pasching, Upper Austria. In August 2015, it was announced that adidas had acquired Runtastic for ‚Ç¨220 million ($240 million), this included the 50.1% stake Axel Springer bought in the company back in 2013, making Runtastic entirely owned by adidas. At the beginning of 2019, Runtastic turned away from its multi-app strategy and focused on developing its two most important apps. These were rebranded in September of the same year. The ‚ÄúRuntastic‚Äù app became ‚Äúadidas Running,‚Äù and the ‚ÄúResults‚Äù app became ‚Äúadidas Training‚Äù. Products The company provides optimized tracking solutions for collecting, managing, and analyzing running and training data, as well as curated content. =Apps= Runtastic offers two apps that track outdoor and indoor fitness activities: adidas Running and adidas Training. The company now offers its apps in 14 languages to cover a large part of the global market. As of September 2020, the combined apps have more than 312 million downloads. =Blog= In addition to its apps, the company runs the adidas Runtastic blog as part of a comprehensive fitness approach that provides users with information, tips and guidance to accompany them on their health and fitness journeys. Reception The broad acceptance of multi-functional mobile devices generally helped reviews of products that make good use of all the extra functionality (e.g. GPS-tracking, audio and video recording and playback, web-syncing, social sharing). This can be seen in reviews of company products, for example from The Verge, TechCrunch, VentureBeat, or The Next Web. The company has also carried out several awareness and sustainability campaigns that enjoy wide resonance among users, media and opinion leaders. The Run Wild campaign, for example, partnered with the United Nations Environment Programm (UNEP) to challenge users to virtually race against a Mongolian snow leopard and raise awareness for threatened wildlife. Among others, the challenge was featured in Runner's World.

Tat Marina came into public attention when she was doused with acid at the age of 16 years in a jealousy attack, reportedly arranged by a wife of a high-ranking Cambodian government official. The acid attack occurred in a broad daylight. No arrest of the perpetrators was made in the assault of Marina. Tat Marina is now married with two children and lives as a political refugee in the United States. Early life Marina sold fruit shakes when she was 14 years old, growing up in poverty, in order to earn enough to pay for her father's medical fees and feed the rest of her family. She started spending some of her extra money going to small karaoke places to practice singing, in the hope of being a karaoke star. In 1998, Tat Marina was hired by a production company which produced karaoke videos. There, she was caught in a relationship with a married man who was known as a high-ranking government official. At the beginning, he lied to her that he was a Cambodian American doing business in Cambodia. Marina was feeding her 3-year-old niece in a downtown market in Phnom Penh when suddenly a few men pulled her to the ground and beat her unconscious. The woman known as a wife of a Cambodian high-ranking official poured five litres of nitric acid. The attackers also scarred themselves with some acid during the attack. No arrest was or has been made in the assault. Marina's face was disfigured. She lost both her ears, half her hearing and her sense of smell. When giving the interview to the Phnom Penh Post, Marina said that she believed the woman was the wife of Svay Sitha, now head of the Council of Minister's Quick and Press Relation Unit. He reported his wife, Khoun Sophal, who was eventually charged with the crime but has so far evaded authorities. Marina collaborated with an American documentary maker, Skye Fitzgerald, on a video documentary about her, \\"Finding Face\\". In 2008, a creative writing class at Stanford University have written and illustrated a graphic novel titled \\"Shake Girl\\", partially based on Tat Marina's story. After acid attack She flew to Vietnam and the United States for free medical surgery while assisted by her half-brother, Ta Sequndo, a Cambodian American medical assistant living in the United States. In 2010, her family members feared for their safety and later fled Cambodia. They are now residing in the Netherlands.

S. Eliot's 1939 poetry book Old Possum's Book of Practical Cats. It was adapted into a musical number in Andrew Lloyd Webber's 1981 musical Cats, and has also been quoted in other films, notably Logan's Run (1976). The poem describes to humans how cats get their names. Poem The poem uses a short rhythmic dialogue to describe how cats get or choose their names. It states that \\"a cat must have THREE DIFFERENT NAMES\\"; specifically, one that is \\"familial\\", one that is \\"particular\\", and one that is \\"secretive\\". English professor Dorothy Dodge Robbins noted that the many examples of feline names given in the poem by the Missouri-born poet were heavily influenced by his love and adoption of British culture: \\"After all, his are the monikers of distinctly London cats; they are not the practical names of Midwestern barn cats.\\" Familial names are typically common human names that the cat's \\"family use daily\\". Examples given include \\"Victor or Jonathan, George or Bill Bailey,\\" the last of which was derived from the 1902 song \\"Won't You Come Home Bill Bailey\\". The poem also suggests \\"fancier\\" familial names derived from ancient and mythological figures such as \\"Plato, Admetus, Electra, and Demeter.\\" Particular names are said to be \\"peculiar\\" yet \\"dignified\\", and Eliot's examples include the invented names of \\"Munkustrap, Quaxo, Coricopat, Bombalurina, and Jellylorum.\\" Robbins speculates that the name \\"Coricopat\\" was derived as a linguistic variation of the \\"Calico Cat\\" from Eugene Field's poem \\"The Duel\\". On the \\"ineffable\\" secretive names of cats, Eliot declares that \\"no human research can discover\\" them for \\"THE CAT HIMSELF KNOWS, and will never confess.\\" Cats In Cats, \\"The Naming of Cats\\" is the second song of the musical. It is entirely spoken and presented as a slow, eerie chant which breaks the fourth wall, acknowledging the audience and explaining to them how cats are given their names. While it is delivered by the cast in unison, whispered in natural rhythmic dialogue, the chant never follows a singsong style as the voices are spoken at different pitches and varying inflections. As the number is performed, cast members venture out into the audience before retreating backstage as the song transitions to Victoria's dance solo. The music is a fragmented and dissonant variation of a theme introduced in the overture. It has no constant key signature or harmonic structure. Many of the characters‚Äô names are taken from the poem, including Bombalurina, Demeter, and Munkustrap. In other media In the 1976 movie Logan's Run, Peter Ustinov's character recites a shortened version of the poem. References Further reading * Poetry by T. S.

Introduced in 1950, it was operated by the Soci√©t√© Nationale des Chemins de fer fran√ßais (\\"French National Railway Corporation\\") (SNCF), and was regarded as the company's flagship train. The train was named after the Mistral, a strong, cold and usually dry regional wind blowing from north or northwestern France to the coast of the Mediterranean around the Camargue region. History The Mistral began its existence in 1950 as a mostly steam locomotive-hauled Rapide (express train) between Paris-Gare de Lyon and Marseille-Saint-Charles. Two years later, in 1952, its route was extended to Nice-Ville. By 1965, when it was integrated into the Trans Europ Express (TEE) system, it had become completely electric locomotive-hauled. In the 1970s, Le Mistral included some unique amenities, among them a \\"bookstall, bar and hairdressing salon\\".Nock, O.S. (1978). World Atlas of Railways, p. 86. New York: Mayflower Books (original publisher: Artists House, London, UK). . The train also had two restaurant cars; the Wagons-Lits Company provided the on- board catering.Thomas Cook Continental Timetable (June 1975 edition), p. 69. Peterborough, UK: Thomas Cook Publishing. In 1975, a writer for Fodor's called Le Mistral \\"perhaps the most luxurious train in Europe\\". The train's final day as a TEE was 26 September 1981,Thomas Cook International Timetable (September 27‚ÄìOctober 31, 1981 edition), pp. 6, 144, 148. as the next day saw the introduction of the first TGV service in France, in that same corridor,\\"TGV Paris ‚Äì Sud Est\\". Thomas Cook International Timetable (September 27‚ÄìOctober 31, 1981 edition), p. 65. and the downgrading of Le Mistral to a two-class \\"Rapide\\" train, albeit continuing to use the same first-class coaches for the train's first-class section. Le Mistral was discontinued entirely in 1982, after being replaced by TGV service. Speed Still steam-hauled in 1964, the Mistral was one of the fastest trains in France, with an average speed of on the Paris ‚Äì Dijon section, as well as an average speed of 129 km/h on its Valence ‚Äì Avignon section. It also had the distinction of being the train with the \\"world's fastest schedule for [a route of] over 500 miles\\", averaging on its Paris ‚Äì Marseille section. Slower speeds on the more \\"rugged country\\" between Marseille and Nice brought the average speed down to over the full 1,086 km route from Paris to Nice, which was nevertheless a relatively high average speed for 1964. Soon after that, electrification of the route was completed, and Le Mistral began being hauled by modern electric locomotives; starting in 1969, it was Class CC 6500 locomotives. This change along with new passenger coaches increased the train's average speed and shortened the travel time, the latter going from 10 hours, 21 minutes, in 1964 to just over 9 hours in June 1969.\\"Table 12: Le Mistral\\".

They are located on the hillock of the town, overlooking the Coromandel Coast of the Bay of Bengal in Kanchipuram District in Tamil Nadu, India. They are cut and decorated with panels in the Mamalla style of the Pallava period in the 7th century. They are differentiated from the Adiranchanda cave temples which are dated to the Mahendraverman period of the 8th century. Remnants seen in the caves also indicate that they were plastered and painted when built. One of the most impressive sculpture panels, bas-reliefs, carved on the walls in the caves is that of the goddess Durga (a form of goddess Shakti) who killed Mahishasura the buffalo-headed demon which has a natural beauty with elegance of sense of movement. Many of the caves of the Pallava period have remained incomplete. The procedure in creating these caves involved creation of a smooth rock face, then cutting columns through the polished rock faces of required size and then carving bas-reliefs on the walls of the cave. Geography The site is in the Kanchipuram district, approximately from Chennai city (previously, Madras) and about from Chingelpet. History The caves reflect a transitional style architecture evolved during the rule of kings Mahendra Varman I and Rajasimha or Narasimhavarman I known as Mamalla and this style was continued by his son Parameshvaravarman I. Historical research has also confirmed that Mahabalipuram town came to be established only after it was named after Mamalla and the caves and rathas are dated to his period during the year 650 AD. That Mahabalipuram was a busy port and prosperous during Mamalla's rule is attested by the fact that Xuanzang, the Chinese traveller stayed here in 642 AD as a guest of the court recording the greatness of the town and its king. Thirumangai Alvar, a vaishnava saint of Tamil Nadu has also recorded glowingly about the town's richness as seen from the loaded ships exporting goods. The caves excavated during this period though similar to the earlier caves but were more sophisticated in their decorations. The Varaha Cave temple or Mandapa has fluted columns separating the openings. Certain Greco-Roman architectural styles could also be discerned and the sitting statues are said to have likeness to the sitting styles seen in European architecture, as against the Indian cross legged style. The style thus created at Mahabalipuram became a forerunner for Dravidian style of architecture. The Pallavas were great patrons of art. Features They have distinctive styles which do not compare with the Gupta period sculptures of North India. In these caves, the carvings of the faces of the human figures are oval shaped with high cheekbones. The body looks slim with tapering limbs. They have several striking mythological scenes carved in relief. Vishnu rescuing the earth, Vishnu taking three strides, and Gaja Laksmi and Durga are all in the Adi- Varaha Cave. Mahishasura Mardhini is in Durga Cave. Krishna lifting mountain is seen in the Pancha-Panadava cave. The relief carving in the Pallava caves is generally shallower than the Deccan caves. The main figures are slender, delicate and elegant. Their hair dresses and crowns are simple and they show no jewellery. Another particular feature noted in the caves is that the lingas are individual carvings and in prismatic shape. However, the drainage as normally provided in the form of pranala or water chute with the linga to drain the abhisheka (Hindu ritual) offering water is not provided in the caves. Landmarks=Krishna= The Krishna Cave Temple is dated to mid-7th century. Its excavated entry is seen with columns leading to a hall. A notable carving inside the cave is a sculpted panel which brings out the myth of Krishna lifting the Govaradhan hill to protect the cow herds and gopis (milk maids) from heavy rains and floods, and also scenes of Krishna frolicking with the milk maids. =Mahishasuramardini= Vishnu in a reclining pose lying on a serpent in Mahishasuramardini cave temple. The Mahishasuramardini Cave Temple is close to the lighthouse on the top of the hill. It has two carved frescoes of Durga, the mother goddess at both ends of the long hall of the cave. She is shown seated on lion her mount or vehicle with all her weapons. The depiction also features her posture of slaying the buffalo headed Mahishasura. At the other end of the hall, opposite to the Durga panel, the scene carved is of Vishnu in a reclining posture on the bed of Ananta multi-hooded serpent. He is surrounded by the divine beings of heaven appealing him to continue with the creation of the universe. There is also a third chamber which shows a carved fresco of Vishnu. =Varaha= Bas-relief inside the Varaha Cave The Varaha Cave Temple (also known as Adivaraha) is dated to the 7th century. The most prominent sculpture is that of Vishnu in the incarnation form of a boar lifting mother earth from the sea. Also carved are many mythical figures. In the entry porch carved on the rock face the columns are carved on lion bases. At the centre of the rear wall, guardian figures are depicted flanking a shrine. The side walls have carved sculpture panels of Vishnu as Trivikrama and Vishnu in the incarnation of Varaha, the boar, lifting Bhudevi, the earth goddess. =Trimurti= The Trimurti Cave Temple is dated to the early 8th century. It has separate sections in a sequenced dedicated to each of the Hindu trinity gods of Brahma, Vishnu and Shiva or Maheshwara. The three shrines are cut out from the rock-face. Each shrine is flanked by pilasters with guardian figures. On the rear wall of the cave, individual carvings of Brahma, Vishnu and Shiva attended by devotees are carved. =Kotikal= The Kotikal Cave Temple is dedicated to goddess Durga. Its entrance faces west and is in continuation of the Dharmaraja Mandapa. The rock cut fa√ßade has two supporting pillars and two pilasters in Mahendravarman style of architecture with an octagonal shaft built over a cubical base, and a similar top. The cave chamber inside is long, wide and has a height of . There is also a small chamber on the rear wall flanked by female dvarpalas (guards); the dvarapala on the left, facing to the front, is carved in a standing posture with one hand holding a club and the other hand holding a sword. The dvarapala on the right is carved with one hand holding a dhanush (bow) and the other arm is resting on her waist. The dvarpalas are in a dancing pose, called tribhanga (triple break). Though there is no deity inside this shrine now, it is conjectured that the sanctum inside housed goddess Durga with the female guardians protecting her at the entrance to the cell. =Tiger= Tiger Cave The Tiger Cave Temple (also known as Yali) is dated to the early 8th century. It is a shallow cave but is unusual and unique when compared to the other caves here. The entrance to the cave faces south-east. It is close to the Atiranachanda Mandapa and located at Saluvankuppam village, to the north of Mamallapuram. This is a refined cave which is carved about above the ground level and has a pavilion which is closed on three sides. The front cavern is in height and has a width of . Approach to the cavity is over a series of steps, and the protection parapets on either side of the staircase are decorated with lions. The two niches on either side of central cavity do not have any carvings. It has been carved out of a boulder with a portico which has sculpted garland of eleven yali heads, mythical animals in the shape of tigers. The main carving here is that of Durga riding a tiger. It is also inferred that this cave may have been used for holding open-air shows or as utsava mantapa (festival pavilion) for the festival of Indra. The lion pilasters carved at the corners of this cavity also show a female riding a ferocious looking lion, which is reported as the first of its kind in Mahabalipuram caves, and hence credited to the Pallava King Rajasimha; there is also a carving of its creator Rajasimha. =Atiranachanda= The Atiranachanda Cave Temple is east facing. It is situated at Saluvankuppam village, about away on the Mahabalipuram ‚Äì Chennai road. Its layout is t in length and in width on plan, with a height of . The fa√ßade carved on the rock face has two pillars and two pilasters, typical of Mahendravarman style, with an octagonal shaft with square base at the top and the bottom. The corbels of the pillars are curved and of roll-moldings. Horizontal friezes in the form of mini shrines are also carved above the corbels, though incomplete. There are three chambers in the cavern with the central chamber being a square of , whereas the other cells are integral to the wall. =Panchapandava= The Panchapandava Cave Temple is near the open air bas-relief of Arjuna's Penance. The cave entrance is east facing and is the largest cavern at length. The cave is unfinished. The length of the opening is indicative of creating a circumambulatory passage within the cave to go round the main shrine. At present only a small chamber has been carved at the center and has remained attached to the main rock. At the entrance, the curved cornice has a series of shrines with the four central shrines projecting out. The vaulted roofs of the shrines are carved with horse-shoe (kudu) shaped windows and each houses another smaller shrine. The niche below the kudu has a carved deity. Ferocious looking lions are also carved. From the architectural features carved here it is conjectured that this style could be assigned to Narasimhavarman I Mamalla period extending to Narasimhavarman II Rajasimha period.

Thus the deep water becomes aerobic, the phosphate dissolution is reduced significantly and the mineralization of sediments improves. Scientific evidence shows that it is possible to keep the deep water aerobic all year round via technical ventilation measures and thereby to recover the natural balance of lakes effectively.Steinberg, C., Bernhardt, H.: Handbuch Angewandte Limnologie ‚Äì 14. Erg.Lfg. 4/0 Verlag: H√ºthig Jehle Rehm, 2002, .  Eutrophication  In stratified, eutrophic lakes an oxygen deficit in deep water is created during summer stagnation. As a result of elevated nutrient inputs, the trophic level of many lakes increases continuously. Elevated phosphorus concentrations may lead to stronger algae growth and a corresponding increase in oxygen consumption in the deep zones. In the anaerobic environment of deep water sludge accumulates, while concentrations of ammonium, iron, manganese and toxic hydrogen sulfide increase in the water body. The hypolimnion is now not only hostile, but the anaerobic conditions also cause increased phosphate dissolutions from the sediments into the deep water. These additional nutrient loads create further problems after the next full circulation. Particularly in terms of drinking water production in reservoirs and dams with respect to the existing regulations of the Drinking Water Ordinance,Verordnung √ºber die Qualit√§t von Wasser f√ºr den menschlichen Gebrauch (Trinkwasserverordnung) vom 21. Mai 2001. Zuletzt ge√§ndert durch Art. 3, Abs. 1, 2 vom 5. Dezember 2012. In: BGBl., Teil 1, Nr. 24: 959-969 (2001) und BGBl. I S. 2562 (2012) these deteriorations in water status are a serious problem. The deep water aeration can prevent this process.  Technical measures for hypolimnetic aeration  TIBEAN or TWBA stands for the German Tiefenwasserbel√ºftungsanlage which means \\"deep water aeration system\\". The TIBEAN series are floating or submersible plants. They consist of one or more upstream pipes, where the water is aerated while rising up, a degassing chamber where the aerated water is freed of gases and one or more downstream pipes where the vented, degassed water is pumped back into the hypolimnion. In the degassing chamber, additional nutrient absorbers and/ or nutrient precipitation devices can be implemented. TIBEAN: technical components and functional principal = Technology = At the lower end of the plant atmospheric air is inserted into the water by an ejector. A mixture of water and oxygen is forced upwards in the upstream pipe. At the end of the upstream pipe the mixture flows into the degassing chamber. Residual gases are separated from the oxygenated water. The gas escapes into the atmosphere, the oxygenated water flows back through the downstream pipe. The outlet provides a laminar flow and a horizontal outflow into the hypolimnion.Jaeger, D.: TIBEAN ‚Äì a new hypolimnetic water aeration plant. Verb. Internat. Verein. Limnol. 24: 184-187, 1990Klapper, H.: Eutrophierung und Gew√§sserschutz. Stuttgart, Jena: Gustav Fischer, 1992, Thanks to the flow and mass transfer calculations which are performed in the context of the technical configuration, the optimal set- up can be determined. = Individual parts = # Floating tanks # Upstream pipe (Telescope) # Degassing chamber # Mixing device # Suction fence # Covering fence # Downstream pipe # Oxygen input # Submersible pump with ejector # Main ballast tanks = Material = TIBEAN can be made of polyethylene, polypropylene, stainless steel and an aluminium-manganese alloy.  Applications  TIBEAN systems are highly variable and cover a very wide range of applications with an oxygen input from 1.5 to 60 kg/h, an application depth of 5 to 50 m, and a flow rate from 600 to 7500 m3/h. The objectives for waterbody restoration or aquatic therapy can vary, depending on the priority. Therefore, the possibilities of deep water aeration systems as TIBEAN are diverse: * Conservation of deep zones as aerobic habitat for fish and other higher organisms.Doke, J.L., Funk, W.H., Juul, S.T.J., Moore, B.C.: Habitat availability and benthic invertebrate population changes following alum treatment and hypolimnetic oxygenation in Newman Lake, Washington. In: J. Freshwat. Ecol. 10: 87-100,1995.Wehrli, B., W√ºest, A.: Zehn Jahre Seenbel√ºftung: Erfahrungen und Optionen. EAWAG, D√ºbenedorf-Z√ºrich, Schweiz,1996, * Reduction of nutrient concentration in surface waters. * Prevention of sludge formation, increased ammonium production and the formation of toxic hydrogen sulfide. * Cost reduction for drinking water production. * Targeted treatment of deep water with coagulants. = Drinking water production in water reservoir dams = Especially in respect of drinking water production, deep-water aeration allows a significant reduction of production costs and facilitates further technical treatment of the hypolimnetic water. Since water for drinking water production is drawn from below the thermocline in most reservoirs, an improved hypolimnetic water quality has direct influence on the production of drinking water. With regard to the applicable limiting values of drinking water regulations, the following effects can be achieved via deep-water aeration:  pH and corrosion  For the pH of drinking water, the threshold value is 6.5‚Äì9.5. pH values outside the neutral range (pH 6.5‚Äì7.5) are principally critical, since they provide an indication of the corrosion behaviour of water. Slightly acidic water (pH 4‚Äì6.5) usually corrodes galvanized iron pipes, but also copper and asbestos cement pipes.Die Bedeutung einzelnen Trinkwasserparameter, Wasserverband Gro√üraum Ansfelden, 29.08.2003, http://wasserverbandansfelden.riscompany.net/medien/download/50330502_1.pdf This process is known as acid corrosion. Practical experience has shown that the use of unprotected steel pipes is only possible at neutral pH values. By lower pH values, the removal of the pure zinc layer is promoted.Wasserqualit√§t: Spezialteil Korrosion, www.waterquality.de, know-how online, http://www.waterquality.de/trinkwasser/K.HTM As a result of the dissolved salts and gases, natural cold waters usually show a slightly alkaline reaction. These properties are created by setting the equilibrium concentrations of dissolved carbon dioxide in the form of bicarbonate ions and carbonate ions. Higher alkaline pH values (pH 9‚Äì14) in the presence of oxygen as an oxidant lead to so-called oxygen corrosion. To avoid the described acid or oxygen corrosion, buffer solutions are added to the raw water for drinking water production. By the pH-stabilizing effect of hypolimnetic aeration, the application of these buffer solutions can be reduced, thus reducing operating costs.  Iron and manganese  For concentrations of iron and manganese in drinking water, the threshold values are 200 ¬µg/l and 50 ¬µg/l respectively. Although they serve as essential trace elements in drinking water, slightly elevated iron and manganese concentrations are undesirable from a technical and hygienic point of view. At low oxygen concentrations, iron and manganese are dissolved as ions. The naturally occurring iron and manganese is mainly present as divalent, soluble ferrous or manganese compound. At very high concentrations, a yellow water colour is noticeable. When this water is aerated, the oxidation creates ferric iron/ manganese, with iron forming red- brown and manganese forming black precipitates. These precipitates cause staining and turbidity of the water and lead to laundry stains. The precipitates can also narrow pipes and deposit on mountings. Iron levels above 0.3 mg/l and manganese levels above 0.5 mg/l become noticeable as an unpleasant metallic taste. Providing an aerobic hypolimnetic environment, deep-water aeration oxidizes and precipitates dissolved iron and manganese compounds, before the water is treated in a suitable facility for drinking water production. In this way further operating costs for the removal of dissolved iron and manganese compounds can be realized. The amount and mobility of iron species also influences the redox-controlled phosphorus household.Lean, D.R.S., McQueen, D.J., Story, V.R.: Phosphate transport during hypolimnetic aeration. Arch. Hydrobiol. 108, 269-280, 1986. Divalent iron compounds successively diffusing from anaerobic sediment layers are oxidized at the boundary zone between aerobic water and anaerobic sediment, and accumulate at the top sediment layer. The stronger this accumulation, the more effective the aerobic boundary between sediment and water can act as a diffusion barrier for phosphate.  Nutrient concentrations and sludge formation  As already mentioned, the deep-water aeration can reduce nutrient concentrations significantly. Aerobic conditions promote nitrification and subsequent denitrification thus contributing to nitrogen discharge of the system. The chemical and microbial oxidation of reduced substances such as hydrogen sulfide and methane as well as the intensified degradation of organic matter can reduce the sludge formation. Aerobic conditions in the deep-water are also an important factor to decrease the redox-controlled redissolution of phosphorus from the sediment and to allow reprecipitation of released phosphorus. In this way the deep-water aeration additionally reduces costs for drinking water production by waiving denitrification stages or reducing the use of costly flocculants.  Planning and design  The final design of plants is carried out in different phases. The first step should always be a morphometric measurement of the water body in order to assess the depth profile and the associated requirements for the technical design, and later on to determine the optimal location of the plant. The exact technical design requires the evaluation of various measurements of parameters such as nutrient concentrations, temperature stratification, pH, temporal variations of oxygen concentrations as well as calculations of flow rates, mass transport quantities and distribution of suspended solids in the hypolimnion.

Early life He was born to the royal family of the Zamorin Rajas of Calicut in 1585. Though much is not non about parents and childhood, it is said he had education from Anayath Krishna pisharody and Desamangalath varrier. He grew up into a poetic genius and a farsighted ruler.http://www.chintha.com/kerala/krishnanattam- history-origin.html Contributions Only two of his books are available now - Krishnanattam (text is also called Krishnageethi) and Purva bharatha chambu, both written in Sanskrit. The later was completed in A.D 1643, 10 years before Krishnanattam. His other books are believed to be destroyed in the fire which gutted Zamorin palace when Hyderali of Mysore attacked in 1766. Krishnageethi The Sanskrit text based on which Krishnanattam was created was written on A.D 1653, aged 68. It consists of eight plays: Avataram, Kaliyamardanam, Rasakrida, Kamsavadham, Swayamvaram, Banayuddham, Vividavadham, and Swargarohanam. It is based on 10th and 11th skandhas of Bhagavata Purana dealing solely with the story of Krishna. It has also gained inspirations from Gita Govinda of Jayadeva, Sree krishna vilaasam Mahakavya and Narayaniyam of Melpathur Narayana Bhattathiri. Krishnan The opening sloka of Krishnanattam is: Krishnanattam kalari in Guruvayur near 'Office Ganapathy' temple where the art is taught. Apart from such slokas it is also adorned by many padyageethams like that of Gita Govinda of Jayadeva. It is a masterpiece work in Sanskrit by a Keralite. =The stories= Staged at Melpathur auditorium during utsavamThe eight plays are: Avataram, Kaliyamardanam, Rasakrida, Kamsavadham, Swayamvaram, Banayuddham, Vividavadham and Swargarohanam. its easily memorised by a mnemonic \\"a-ka-ra-ka-swa-bha-vi-swa\\". On the ninth day, Avatharam is repeated. The various benefits of Krishnanattam as an offering are: * Avatharam for a birth of a child. * Kaliyamardhanam to remove the effect of poison. * Rasakreeda well being of unmarried girls, to end disputes between couples. * Kamsavaddham to remove enemies. * Swayamvaram for a happy matrimony. * Bana yuddham to remove impoverishment, for good farm production. * Vividha vadham to eliminate poverty and increase yield from farms. * Swargarohanam for peace of a departed soul. The legend KrishnanattamKing Manaveda told Vilwamangalam about his ambition to view Krishna. The next day the Swamiyar told him that Guruvayurappan has given his consent and Manavedan can see Guruvayurappan playing in the early hours of the morning at the platform of the Elanji tree. He could only see and not touch Him. When as per this agreement, Manavedan saw Guruvayurappan in the form of little child Sri Krishna, he was so excited that he forgot himself and, rushed to embrace little Sree Krishna.Guruvayoorappan immediately disappeared saying, \\"Vilwamangalam did not tell me that this will happen \\".However, Manavedan got one peacock feather from the head gear of Bhagavan Krishna.. The peacock feather was incorporated in the headgear for the character of Sri Krishna in the dance drama Krishnanattam based on his own text krishnageethi which is composed of 8 chapters. It was performed near the sanctum sanctorum of the Guruvayur Temple. On the ninth day, Avatharam was repeated as the Zamorin felt that it was not auspicious to end the series with the demise of Lord Krishna. The blessed art form is still maintained by Guruvayur devaswom and staged as an offering by devotees. Late life After advent of Krishnanattam at age of 68 he was till his demise involved in improvising the dancedrama. He died at Thrissur in 1658 and was cremated at Guruvayur south of Guruvayurappan temple. A statue was built at this place, which at present is located near panjajanyam guest house in guruvayur.

She was born at Aker in √òvre Eiker as a daughter of hospital manager Johannes Albrecht Dons (1839‚Äì1921) and Johanne Marie Fleischer (1850‚Äì1943). She was a sister of aviator Hans Fleischer Dons. The family moved to Kristiania in 1883. She finished middle school at Nissen Girls School in 1891, worked some years as a private teacher for the Bugge family in Rosendal and graduated from Asker Teachers' Seminary in 1897. She worked as a primary school teacher in B√¶rum until 1900, then in Kristiania from 1900 to 1917. She was also a leading figure in YWCA already from her early twenties. She had undergone a Christian awakening while living in Rosendal, and was in 1897 selected as a teacher for a Norwegian Missionary Society program in colonial South Africa, but she was prevented by illness. From 1917 to 1939 she served as the national secretary of children's work in the Norwegian Missionary Society. During her tenure, the number of local missionary associations for children rose from about 300 to 1,100. In the Norwegian YMCA-YWCA Association she served as deputy chair from 1905 to 1917 and 1932 to 1941. She was also a co-founder of the Women Teachers' Missionary Association in 1902 (chair 1905 to 1946), the Missionary Workers' Ring in 1907, the Norwegian Christian Teachers' Association in 1909 (now a part of KPF) and the Norwegian Missionary Studies Council in 1911. In 1910 both the Women Teachers' Missionary Association and the Missionary Workers' Ring became member bodies of the Norwegian National Women's Council, and Dons was a board member here from 1910 to 1916. Together with people like Bolette Gj√∏r, in 1904 she proposed successfully that women be granted voting rights within the Norwegian Missionary Society. She also headed a campaign in 1911, together with five other women, to grant women the right of speech in churches of Norway. She contributed to the magazine Norges Kvinder and edited the magazines Missionshilsen, Vort blad and Misjonsselskapets barneblad. She also penned several books. Dons was awarded the King's Medal of Merit in gold in 1962, and was proclaimed an honorary member of the Norwegian National Women's Council in 1965. She did not marry. She died in June 1966 in Oslo.

History In the late 1842 Maykov went for Western Europe and spent two years abroad, mostly in Rome. The result of this visit was the collection of poems published as a separate edition in 1847. Sketches of Rome, according to the modern biographer E.Mayorova, were highly important for Maykov's development as it demonstrated the enriched linguistic palette and opened for him some new artistic possibilities. The idea of Sketches of Rome has been to some extent prompted by Nikolai Gogol's novelet Rome, publushed by Moskvityanin in 1842, which rather upset Belinsky with its 'slavophiliac' tendency \\"to look awry at Paris and myopically at Rome,\\" as he put it.The Complete Belinsky. Vol. VI, 427, 661. In Sketches of Rome Maykov created the gallery of citizens of the ancient city, each expressing one feature of the national character or another, much in the tradition of Russian \\"natural school\\" movement. The modern Rome here comes across as a healthy alternative to the 'capitalist' Paris, torn by conflicts and scandals. Like the young Prince in Gogol's novel, Maykov's character sympathizes with the classical Rome, its pictures of nature as well as the people reminding him the images from poems of Hellas. The better half of this second book amounts to (according to the biographer Fyodor Pryima) the ruminations over the ruins of Rome (\\"Games\\", \\"Ancient Rome\\", \\"Upon Visiting the Vatican Museum\\", \\"Campagna di Roma\\" and others). One poem of the book, \\"Palazzo\\", mentioning 'stolen freedom', had problems with censorship. Another vaguely political piece, \\"Anachoret\\" (1846), has its hero envisaging the times when \\"the poor will tear off their shackles\\" and \\"some evil crook won't be honoured like he was God\\", but returning after 20 years spent in the desert finds the world not changed for the better. Criticism The biographer Fyodor Pryima, writing of the author's second collection, opined: \\"When trying to portray modern life Maykov lacks dynamics and expressiveness... His \\"Girls from Albano by the Fountain\\" represents a sketch by a painter who sees the life of contemporary Italy as if through the prism of the classic art. The author not only doesn't try to conceal the fact that his impressions are secondary, he emphasizes this by introducing to the picture first the German artist who actually paints these girls, and then himself, a Russian poet dreaming of making a verbal sketch of the same.\\" In many instances, according to Priyma, Maykov's view is static and often self-effacing.

In December, 2016, it was announced that she would serve as director of the School's library science graduate program beginning in July 2017. Past professional positions University of British Columbia: Haythornthwaite began working for the University of British Columbia. at the School of Library, Archival and Information Sciences at the University's iSchool in 2010. Haythornthwaite was a director and professor at the University. She also had further roles at the University as she was a member of a number of committees including the UBC Scholarly Communications Steering Committee and the UBC advisory committee for policy review on information systems and assets use and security. Haythornthwaite is interested in how the Internet and Information and Communication Technologies (ICTs) can support learning, work and the social interaction between people. This interest can be seen throughout her research which focuses on this area. Her research is conducted through the analysis of Social Networks. Institute Of Education, University of London: Commencing 2009 and finishing in 2010 Haythornthwaite was a Leverhulme Trust visiting professor at the Institute of Education, University of London. The year at the Institute of Education entailed research, writing and public presentations on the topic of Learning Networks. This research encompassed overlapping themes of social networks, computer networks and learning. A result of Haythornthwaite's time at the Institute of Education was the book E-learning Theory and Practice, co-authored with Institute of Education Professor Richard Andrews. Graduate School of Library and Information Science (GSLIS), University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign (UIUC): Commencing 1996 and finishing in 2010 Haythornthwaite was employed at the UIUC Graduate School of Library and Information Science (GSLIS), University of Illinois at Urbana- Champaign (UIUC). In Haythornthwaite's time at GSLIS UIUC, she held a number of academic positions: from 1996 to 2002 Haythornthwaite was Assistant Professor GSLIS, UIUC, 2002‚Äì2008 Haythornthwaite was Associate Professor GSLIS, UIUC. In 2008 Haythornthwaite was made Professor GSLIS, UIUC and remained in this post until 2010. Co-authored works Haythornthwaite has written many journals, articles and has co-authored five books to date. These books focus on the Internet, E-learning and the culture and communities in online education. =E-learning Theory and Practice= Written by both Haythornthwaite and Richard Andrew, E-learning Theory and Practice came out in 2011. This book aims to help those involved in E-learning to gain an understanding of new learning practices and for the learners themselves to gain an understanding of their role as active participants in both classroom and lifelong learning. =Handbook of E-Learning Research= Haythornthwaite co-edited with Richard Andrews The SAGE Handbook of E-learning Research in 2007. This book provides the reader with substantial literature reviews of E-learning research. This book contains the basics of E-learning as well as new perspectives in the area. =AoIR Internet Annual, Volume 4= In 2006 Haythornthwaite worked with Mia Consalvo to produce AoIR Internet Annual, Volume 4. This book is a collection of highlights from a number of scholars who made contributions at the 2005 Association of Internet Researchers conference or AoIR conference. =Learning, Culture and Community in Online Education: Research and Practice= In 1996 the Graduate School of Library and Information Science at the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign began the Library Experimental Education Program (LEEP). This allowed learners from across the US and the world to take part in an Internet-based program which enabled them to earn a master's degree. The aim of this book was to bring together new research concerning online education and used the LEEP program as a model to show the benefits of online education, and was edited by Haythornthwaite and Michelle. M. Kazmer. =The Internet in Everyday Life= Edited by Haythornthwaite and Barry Wellman, the Internet in Everyday Life concentrated on 19 studies. These studies were used to discuss the domestication of the Internet in day-to-day life and also brought about the idea of new questions and methodologies that may need to be asked in the future of Internet Studies. Commentary on Haythornthwaite's work=The Internet in Everyday Life= Writing about Haythornthwaite and Wellman's popular 2002 edited volume, The Internet in Everyday Life, Mary Chayko of the College of Saint Elizabeth stated that the arguments in the book relied too heavily on quantitative research data, the nature of which would result in the contributors' findings soon becoming obsolete.Mary Chakyo, Review of The Internet in Everyday Life, http://groups.chass.utoronto.ca/netlab/wp- content/uploads/2012/05/The-Internet-in-Everyday-Life-Review.pdf Robert E. Wood supported this in his review of the book as well, as seeing a need for more contextual research, stating that \\"The studies make important statements at this level ‚Äî based mainly on large-scale surveys and quantitative analyses ‚Äî but collectively also point toward the need for more fine-grained and context-specific studies\\". Wood also describes the \\"vast generalisations\\" the contributors make during a number of the book's chapters.Robert E. Wood, \\"The Internet in Everyday Life (review)\\", http://muse.jhu.edu/login?auth=0&type;=summary&url;=/journals/social_forces/v082/82.3wood.pdf Kris Cohen of the University of Surrey and Chicago took this notion a step further during his review of the book, telling of a narrative that has appeared in similar literature and is present in 'The Internet in Everyday Life'.Kris Cohen, Review of Internet in Everyday Life, http://www.socresonline.org.uk/10/1/reviews/cohen.html This narrative describes how 'qualitative and quantitative researchers, social scientists and Humanities researchers, continue to work, each in our own worlds, heedless'. Cohen raises another issue with 'The Internet in Everyday Life', criticising the book as being too 'polemic'. Cohen states that a 'study of [Internet] users in Pittsburgh, which suggested that heavy internet use might lead to depression and isolation, received national attention from the media' by Kraut et al. (1998) is a reference to thirteen out of twenty (65%) of essays referenced in the book, and eighteen out of twenty essays (90%) respond explicitly to the moralistic question set forth by Kraut et al., \\"thereby accepting its terms and conditions\\". Cohen also sees a contradiction in this bias, with Haythornthwaite setting out to address Kraut et al.'s moralistic question by 'rejecting the question' itself, whilst the other contributors get trapped in that paper's moralistic framework. =Learning Culture and Community in Online Education: Research and Practice= In her mainly positive review of Haythornthwaite's paper 'Learning, Culture and Community in Online Education: Research and Practice', Nora Wright of the University of California found one problem with the paper, in that it appears less approachable to students and researchers than the content would suggest. Wright states that the paper is not for \\"library information science people only, although it may seem to be at first glance\\".Nora Wright, \\"A Review of Learning, Culture and Community in Online Education: Research and Practice\\", http://kairos.technorhetoric.net/10.1/binder.html?reviews/wright/index.html Conference appearances Hawaii International Conference on System Sciences: Haythornthwaite is one of the organizers of the Social Networking and Community event.

It was a very controversial tour, because the South African authorities imposed the exclusion of Maori players from the team. This racist politicy created much controversy in New Zealand. (see Halt All Racist Tours) Later tours New Zealand Rugby union then refused any other tour for the successive ten years until Maori and Samoan player participation was accepted in 1970. In that occasion South African authorities, gave them the title of \\"Honorary Whites\\", but controversies remained. In 1976, all the African countries boycotted the Olympic Games in protest at the All Blacks' tour of South Africa. Then, the 1981 Springboks' tour, was contested by a large part of New Zealand public opinion, with riots and demonstrations. In 1985 public opinion convinced NZRU to cancel another tour in South Africa. Only with the end of apartheid, in 1992 did the controversy end.

Career  Durrant-Peatfield obtained his medical degrees at Guy's Hospital London, in 1960 and worked for two years at Croydon University Hospital before entering general practice.

Bolette Gj√∏r, c. 1880s Bolette Margrethe Gj√∏r, n√©e Nissen (11 May 1835 ‚Äì 4 November 1909) was a Norwegian writer and inner missionary. She was born in Trondheim as a daughter of merchant Martinus Nissen (1800‚Äì1836) and Ida Susanne Amalie Hagerup (1808‚Äì85). After her father died when she was only one year old, her mother married anew and they moved to Romedal. She was a sister of Rikke Nissen, niece of Hartvig Nissen, grandniece of Henrich Steffens and a first cousin of Prime Minister Francis Hagerup. In October, 1872, she married vicar Julius Gj√∏r (1839‚Äì1916), a son of Magnus A. Gj√∏r. She attended her uncle's Nissen Girls School from 1849, and later learnt English. In her early twenties she underwent a Christian awakening in the milieu surrounding Gisle Johnson. She dedicated the rest of her life to missionary organizational work for women, inspired by the practical work of Gustava Kielland and the pious ideas of Henriette Gislesen. Her missionary work really started in 1862, having moved back to Romedal where she ran her own school and sunday school, missionary women's association and care for the poor. In 1873, she followed her husband who became vicar in Stor-Elvdal, in 1878 further to the recently built St. Jacob's Church, Oslo. In Kristiania, she became a teacher at the Christiania Deaconess House (Diakonissehuset Christiania), now Lovisenberg Diaconal University College which was founded by Cathinka Guldberg. She founded later women's missionary societies. The number of such societies rose from about 1,700 to 3,500 during Gj√∏r's time. They were not formally connected to the Norwegian Missionary Society (Det Norske Misjonsselskap), where women did not have voting rights, but nonetheless contributed with two thirds of the organization's income. Gj√∏r gathered support to grant women elective rights in the Norwegian Missionary Society, an endeavor which became successful in 1904. She was also a member of the discussion Club of 1903, founded by Marie Michelet and Fredrikke Aars, and founded the Missionary Workers' Ring in 1907 together with Henny Dons among others. She also led the Mission School for Women from 1900 to 1909. Between 1884 and 1894 she issued fifteen books under the pen name Margrethe. She edited the Norwegian Missionary Society's magazine for women, Missionsl√¶sning for Kvindeforeninger from its inauguration in 1884 as well as B√∏rnebibliotheket, the magazine issued by the Norwegian Sunday School Association (Norsk S√∏ndagsskoleforbund) from 1893 to 1901.

Domestic silk moths are closely dependent on humans for reproduction, as a result of millennia of selective breeding. Wild silk moths are different (having not been selectively bred) from their domestic cousins; they are not commercially viable in the production of silk. In India, the major mulberry silk producing states are Karnataka, Andhra Pradesh, West Bengal, Tamil Nadu and Jammu & Kashmir which together accounts for 92 % of country's total mulberry raw silk production. Karnataka produces 9,000 metric tons of mulberry silk of a total of 14,000 metric tons produced in the country, thus contributing to nearly 70% of the country's total mulberry silk.

The term commonly refers to wood-burning stoves for domestic heating, although it is also applied to cooking stoves. It is distinct from a clean-burning-fuel stove, which typically burns clean fuels such as ethanol, biogas, LPG, or kerosene. Studies into clean-burning stoves have shown that they reduce the emissions of dangerous particulates and carbon monoxide significantly, use less fuel than regular stoves, and result in fewer burn injuries. However, the emissions they produce are still much greater than the safe limits, and they do not appear to be effective at reducing illnesses such as pneumonia induced by breathing polluted air, which may have many sources.  Use  Such stoves are commonly used for domestic heating, although they can also be used for cooking. They have been proposed for introduction to developing countries in order to improve air quality. In addition to their practical use, they can be considered to have an aesthetic aspect by \\"add[ing] some charm to the d√©cor\\".  Development  A research summary of the development of such stoves was published in 1982 by Flow Research Inc. Stoves introduced in the 1980s burnt wood pellets rather than logs. By 1986, a directory was available listing 75 such stoves which had satisfied emission testing.  Operation  Clean- burning stoves can be catalytic (using catalytic converters) or noncatalytic. The noncatalytic designs recirculate smoke to achieve fuller combustion. Once the stove is warmed to within operating temperatures, it produces no visible smoke, emitting mostly water and carbon dioxide. Non-catalytic stoves have higher emissions than the new catalytic stoves do when the latter are operated correctly (). A conventional stove in 1984 emitted particulates amounting to approximately 20g/kg (0.3oz/lb). Research by the United States Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) was reported in 1986 to show that conditions such as asthma, bronchitis and emphysema may be aggravated by the use of conventional stoves.  Regulation  The EPA was reported as announcing plans in 1987 to encourage manufacturers to design stoves with reduced emissions. Clean-burning stoves are authorised for use in smoke control areas in some countries by organisations such as the EPA.

Her father died when she was only one year old, and she grew up in Romedal after her mother married Severin Henrik R√¶der (1800‚Äì1878). She was a sister of Bolette Gj√∏r, niece of Hartvig Nissen, grandniece of Henrich Steffens, great-granddaughter of Martinus Lind Nissen and a first cousin of Prime Minister Francis Hagerup. She did not marry, but was an aunt of Claus Riiber. She was homeschooled until 1847, when she enrolled in Lotz Girls School in Christiania. Her sister Bolette also moved to attend school in the capital, and underwent a religious awakening in the milieu of Gisle Johnson. Nissen became familiar with this awakening, and the network of women's missionary associations which her sister worked to establish. At the same time, in 1851 a Deaconess House was established in Stockholm, Sweden to educate nurses in a Christian setting. Through numerous magazine articles Nissen began agitating for such an institution in Christiania. In 1868 the Deaconess House (now: Lovisenberg Diaconal University College) was founded with Cathinka Guldberg as manager. Nissen travelled in Germany to study similar institutions there, and was subsequently hired as a teacher at the Deaconess House in 1870. In 1877 she wrote Norway's first textbook in nursing, L√¶rebog i Sygepleie, under the pseudonym R.N. The following year she visited a similar institution in Bergen; in 1878 her sister moved to Christiania and was hired at the Deaconess House as well. From 1884 to 1891 Nissen edited the magazine Fra Diakonissehuset. Between 1885 and 1888 she stayed in Germany to overcome rheumatism.

Florence Mildred was baptized in the Warminster Minister Church, St. Denys, on 8 March 1874. In 1881 the family lived in Warminster in a villa with a governess, a nurse and two housemaids. Her father was a cheese factor, or manufacturer of local and traditional cheeses. There were four children in the family noted in the census of 1881. After a local education her parents sent her to a private boarding School named Duncan House in Cleveden, Glasgow, and later to a finishing school, Clapham Park Ladies College, in south London. In 1892 she took a teaching post. From June 1898 until October 1903 she attended the Grand Ducal Victorian Pensionat in Karlsruhe, Germany as a teacher of English, Italian and French. She described herself as a 'Modern Language Mistress in large Schools'. In 1906 she returned to England and became a teacher at the prestigious Godolphin School in Salisbury. She is recorded as being a 'Boarder', aged 37 years and single, in the 1911 national census of England. She was an Assistant Mistress (Modern Languages). This group consisted of a Head, six female teachers, a housemaid and a cook. Three other female teachers came from South Africa, Russia and Austria respectively. She later became a Senior Language Mistress at the Godolphin school, where she remained until 1914.West Midlands Police Museum, Sparkhill Police Station, 639 Stratford Rd. Birmingham.

In a School Year Book the Headmistress of the school at the time, Miss Douglas wrote:  Patrol Volunteer at Bristol and Bath  Apart from London's Metropolitan Police commissioning of a report by a \\"female on females in custody\\" in 1907, there was not any consideration given to women working within the Police Force. In 1910 five women got together as a group to draw the attention of the Police Authorities to the fact that there were no women Constables in the force, even though many women were arrested and were temporary prisoners in police custody. Matrons were employed as civilian staff to look after women and children only. They had been established for many years and were usually the wives of serving police officers. Two women in particular sought to point out this lack of a woman Constable presence was wrong. They each had a relative in political high office. One of these women was Edith Tancred (1873‚Äì1957) Tancred became a campaigner for the requirement of women police.

She worked at the Police Station in Endless Street which was purpose built in the 1880s as the third Police Station within the city; it housed all the offices needed for the City Force, a Parade ground in its centre and it had several stables at the back. The Chief Constable had his accommodation there. Like all Chief Constables, Frank Richardson employed the wives or close relatives of serving officers to accommodate the needs of women and children who came into police custody. He decided a dedicated policewoman was best suited for this task in his force. Later, in June, at an important meeting in London, his decision was vindicated. Lady Nott-Bowes addressed the Chief Constables Association held at the Waldorf Hotel, London, on 23 May.

Because she was attested she had the same rights as a male constable, thus setting a nationwide precedent. Her appointment was confirmed by the Salisbury Watch Committee and also by her new employer, The Birmingham Watch Committee, when she took up the appointment there in 1925. The oath she took was the same as for male constables: She joined as a Constable and was promoted rapidly. Her commencing salary on joining the Force was ¬£210. per annum.

Dorothy Peto maintained she would not accept a rank below Inspector, whereas White did accept the lower rank. Most important of all to Constable and then Sergeant White was the fact that she now could receive a pension like her male counterparts. Chief Constable Richardson took steps to ensure she would get her pension by clearing her with the Salisbury Watch Committee on appointment as someone who was superannuated, writing a letter to her Chief Constable at her next posting in 1925 stating \\"Miss White is entitled to reckon the period between 26 May 1918 and 26 May 1925 as 'Approved Service' within the meaning of Section 8 (1) of the Police Pensions Act 1921.\\" The Home Office in London set up the Baird Committee in 1920The Baird Committee on Women Police began sitting in 1920.

Viewed 2014http://www.ric.edu/faculty/rpotter/lwyles.html On 16 November 1921 the Metropolitan Commissioner of Police, Sir Nevil Macready, who was considered to be setting the standard throughout England, issued an order that with the possibility of women being appointed in the Police Service they would be in line with requirements for male officers; \\"a minimum height would be established, though at 5 feet 4 inches this was considerably lower than that for men.\\" (White was officially documented as being five feet five and one half inches tall so qualified in stature.) Macready added that women with dependent young children would be barred from service, women officers were not to be sworn in as constables, and they would not have the right to a pension. Salisbury, Gloucestershire, Liverpool and Glasgow had attested women Constables but it appears only White of Salisbury paid into a pension and had equality with male constables. In 1925 Peto left the City of Birmingham Police Force, and White applied to the City of Birmingham for Peto's post. The choice of force may have been coincidental with the Peto post becoming vacant, but the Richardson family had strong connections with Birmingham since Frank Richardson (Senior) (Chief Constable of Hereford from 1882‚Äì1920) started his police career in Birmingham in 1871.Book, Policing Hereford and Leominster, authors Hadley and Forrest, published May 1989. . White very quickly made contact with Sir Leonard Dunning (17 June 1860‚Äì8 Feb 1941),http://www.thepeerage.com. still the Chief Inspector of the Constabulary, asking him if he would give her a reference for the post in Birmingham. Dunning duly wrote to the Chief Constable of Birmingham City Police, Sir Charles Rafter (1857‚Äì 23 August 1935), from his home in Horsham. White also wrote a letter to Chief Constable Rafter stating she would welcome getting experience from a larger force. Two weeks later White sent her application for the post to Birmingham. This she did on Chief Constable Frank Richardson's office notepaper, adding she did so with his permission as well as his agreement that she should apply for the post. She also wrote another letter to Chief Constable C.H. Rafter in April 1925, reiterating the monetary conditions that she was expecting in her new position relating to her pay i.e. Salary, Detective Allowance, Plain Clothes Allowance, Boot Allowance, and she added five percent of Pensionable Pay being deducted towards the Superannuation Fund. Chief Constable Rafter replied with a personal letter to White giving very precise details of what would be expected of her in her duties as a Lady Enquiry Officer in the Birmingham City Police Force. He added that his \\"Force needs a broad minded woman of the world\\" and noted that \\"If your Chief Constable approves of your joining this police force I would seek the approval of your Watch Committee about allowing you to count your previous police service in the Salisbury Force towards pension in this Force\\". White often referred to her possible new position as being a Lady Enquiry Officer, a female detective. She could not be attested, as there was no provision for it in the Birmingham Force at the time; it was to be 1930 before the rules were changed in Birmingham. Two women, Evelyn Miles (1867‚Äì1939) who would become a Sergeant later and Rebecca Lipscombe were policewomen since 1918 but were not attested and therefore did not have the same powers or status as their male counterparts. White journeyed from Salisbury to Birmingham on 23 April 1925 for an interview with the Chief Constable at the Chief Constable's Office in Corporation Street, Birmingham. White was accepted for the post of Lady Enquiry Officer with the Birmingham Police Force, Detectives Office. She had to accept the title \\"Lady Enquiry Officer,\\" as opposed to \\"Policewoman\\". Her previous attestation was held in abeyance. Peto was very pleased with the outcome: she wrote in her Memoirs that on her resignation she had the consolation of promoting the appointment in her post of Sergeant White of Salisbury, who had trained at the Bristol School and was admirably qualified, in her view, to take over and develop the work in Birmingham.Memoirs of Miss Dorothy Peto.

Chief Constable Frank Richardson wrote an open letter certifying White has his \\"written sanction to take up office\\" with the Birmingham City Police. The necessary permission of the Birmingham Watch Committee was obtained for White to be transferred into their Force. At the end of May Chief Constable Richardson wrote in a letter to Sir Charles Rafter that she had been a great benefit to his Force, and he recommended her release to her and Birmingham's benefit. At this time Sergeant White was summoned to appear at a meeting of the Salisbury Council Watch Committee. There, as the Salisbury and Winchester Journal reported: Sergeant White was to be officially released from the Salisbury Force on 2 June 1925. However, she had written on 23 May to the Chief Constable of Birmingham, saying that she envisaged travelling from Salisbury to Birmingham on 3 June.

Birmingham's police force was divided into five Divisions--A. Division located in Steelhouse Lane, B Division in Ladywood Road, C Division in Kenyon Street, D. Division in Victoria Road, Aston and E Division in Mosley Street--plus the police headquarters which incorporated R Division, the Detectives Office, which was in a large complex in the city centre.

From 3 June, she attended the Birmingham Police School to take instruction on General State Law, amendments to the Vagrancy Law, Punishments on Incest, Evidence and Procedure Taking of Statements and Elementary First Aid. On 18 June she passed her course with the note from her instructor, \\"A keen hardworking woman with a very high standard of intelligence and should make a reliable person for her class of work.\\" The Birmingham Watch Committee were very interested in her and as early as May a councillor, Miss Wilson, had written to Sir Charles Rafter saying she wanted to make her acquaintance on arrival as soon as possible. On 23 June 1925, White took up her full duties when an internal memorandum was circulated that she should be notified of all cases of indecent assault where women were witnesses. From her arrival White was renting an apartment in Harborne Road, Birmingham. Her appointment had been ratified on 1 July by the Watch Committee. Later, on 8 July 1925, the Chief Constable asked the Judicial subcommittee that: In her first year White dealt with 577 investigations and wrote to her Superintendent that her experience of the last six weeks had convinced her that her work as a C.I.D. Enquiry Officer was in excess of what one woman could reasonably be asked to accomplish, She soon had two assistants allocated to her. In September 1927 there appeared to be an issue with her not getting a rent allowance for her accommodation. This request had to go before the Judicial subcommittee of the Watch Committee where a payment of 10/- a week was approved. The Chief Constable recommended approval. In recognition of her work her salary was increased from 1 October 1926. In order to be recalled in an emergency, White had to write a specific letter to her Superintendent asking permission to go to Oxford from the early morning of 25 December 1927 until the last train back on 26 December 1927. Meanwhile, her colleague Dorothy Peto, whom she had known since her 1914‚Äì17 days in Bath and Bristol, had taken a post in Liverpool, not in the uniform police service, but as a Director of ten policewomen in 1930.

The Commission noted with satisfaction the Birmingham Force was starting to appoint women police constables. (By 1935, the women's police department had seventeen female officers, including uniformed and plain-clothes women constables and a woman enquiry officer (White) attached to the detective department.) The Detective Department by now had its own offices in Steelhouse Lane, adjoining the new central police station. By 1930 the Birmingham City Police thus allowed the attesting of women as police officers. White, already an attested Sergeant, was immediately promoted to the rank of Inspector on 1 April 1930, making her in all probability the first attested female Inspector in the country. Dorothy Peto was attested as a Constable in mid April 1930.Book, Memoirs of Miss Dorothy Peto Page62.

This included Inspector White and any newly attested female constables. At the time of women being allowed to be attested in the Birmingham City Police, the Birmingham City Council Watch Committee asserted that new recruits had to be unmarried. This did not apply to Rebecca Lipscombe and Evelyn Miles, who had been instrumental in fighting for women to be attested in the Birmingham City Police. Some correspondence and internal memoranda showed that in 1931 White was using tram discs, supplied by the Police Authority, in the city while travelling between her office, the Explosives Department, the Lock Up, and the Summoning Office and Public Carriage Office. But, like all Birmingham police officers, the discs could not be used for travel between their home and their place of work within the city centre. This situation had arisen because she was working 'split shifts' which meant travelling in and out from home twice a day which doubled her travelling costs. At the end of 1933 there were many amendments to the Vagrancy Act 1824 which came under review;Book, Memoirs of Miss Dorothy Peto Page 88 the protection of women was quite dominant and White's personal importance in CID increased. Peto was credited with using the Children and Young Persons Act 1933 to take ownership of cases involving child abuse and based on that establish a special role for policewomen. In 1933 the majority of interviews with women involved in indecency was being taken by policewomen where, like Birmingham, they were available. With the advent of new female recruits into the Birmingham Force, both uniform and others, their accommodation had to be increased. In 1935, White's duties increased with her receiving the authority to inspect premises and books of private employment agencies. In May 1935, White received the King's Jubilee Medal, and in March 1936 she received a special payment of one guinea for apprehending a person obtaining goods by false pretences and a person committing abortion.

On 26 February 1937, White had applied to her Superintendent for retirement. He conveyed the request to the Chief Constable. There was no precedent for a woman to retire and receive a pension, despite the fact she had been paying into the fund since 1918. She had to send many letters (25 in all) to confirm her pension would be paid, writing to the government in Whitehall, London. The Watch Committees of Salisbury and Birmingham were consulted. In both 1925 and 1930 White had her superiors confirm her pensionable pay status. It was argued by some that she should serve the full 25 years to get a pension but, as a gentleman from the Home Office in Whitehall, wrote that she would be aged 69 years by this time, or 74 to get her full pension. Again, her Chief Constable came to her aid: he suggested she should be considered a special case, quoting a section of Stone's Justices' Manual, and that she had been of great benefit to his force. White herself suggested she retire on a reduced pension of 19/60ths or she could not afford to retire at all. The Home Office suggested that she should receive a part- pension if the Watch Committees of Salisbury and Birmingham agreed to it. Birmingham Watch committee agreed to the pension arrangements. Salisbury readily agreed and Birmingham agreed after her Chief Constable wrote that he wanted her to leave in a happy state of mind. Her record was 'Exemplary' and the reason for retirement given as 'Superannuation'. In a report to the Chief Constable from her Office Superintendent at the Birmingham C.I.D. Corporation Street he says : \\"During the whole of her Service she has carried out her duties in a most efficient and capable manner as an Officer of great skill and ability.\\" Her retirement was reported in the Police Review and Parade Ground Gossip.Retirement: Inspector White.

The Dos Leyendas show took place on March 15, 2013 in CMLL's main venue, Arena M√©xico, Mexico City, Mexico. The event was to honor and remember CMLL founder Salvador Lutteroth, who died in March 1987. Starting in 1999 CMLL honored not just their founder during the show, but also a second lucha libre legend, making it their version of a Hall of Fame event. For the 2013 show CMLL commemorated the life and career of wrestler and lucha film star Rayo de Jalisco Sr.. This was the 15th March show held under the Homenaje a Dos Leyendas name, having previously been known as Homenaje a Salvador Lutteroth from 1996 to 1998. The main event was a tag team Lucha de Apuestas, or bet match, where each team \\"bet\\" their mask or hair on the outcome of the match. The team of Stuka Jr. (betting his mask) and Rey Cometa (betting his hair) defeated La Fiebre Amarilla (\\"The Yellow Fever\\"), forcing Okumura to have his hair cut off, and Namajague to unmask and reveal his real name, Kyosuke Mikami. One of the featured matches of the undercard was a second lucha de apuestas matchwhere the Mexican National Women's Champion Estrellita defeated La Amapola, forcing Amapola to be shaved bald as a result. In the finals of the 2013 CMLL Torneo Nacional de Parejas Increibles La Sombra and Volador Jr. defeated Atlantis and √öltimo Guerrero to win the tournament. The show also included a match with longtime rivals Rayo de Jalisco Jr. and Universo 2000 in addition to two further matches. Production=Background= Since 1996 the Mexican wrestling company Consejo Mundial de Lucha Libre (Spanish for \\"World Wrestling Council\\"; CMLL) has held a show in March each year to commemorate the passing of CMLL founder Salvador Lutteroth who died in March 1987. For the first three years the show paid homage to Lutteroth himself, from 1999 through 2004 the show paid homage to Lutteroth and El Santo, Mexico's most famous wrestler ever and from 2005 forward the show has paid homage to Lutteroth and a different leyenda (\\"Legend\\") each year, celebrating the career and accomplishments of past CMLL stars. Originally billed as Homenaje a Salvador Lutteroth, it has been held under the Homenaje a Dos Leyendas (\\"Homage to two legends\\") since 1999 and is the only show outside of CMLL's Anniversary shows that CMLL has presented every year since its inception. All Homenaje a Dos Leyendas shows have been held in Arena M√©xico in Mexico City, Mexico which is CMLL's main venue, its \\"home\\". Traditionally CMLL holds their major events on Friday Nights, which means the Homenaje a Dos Leyendas shows replace their regularly scheduled Super Viernes show. The 2013 show was the 18th overall Homenaje a Dos Leyendas show. =Storylines= The Homenaje a Dos Leyendas show featured six professional wrestling matches with different wrestlers involved in pre- existing scripted feuds, plots and storylines. Wrestlers were portrayed as either heels (referred to as rudos in Mexico, those that portray the \\"bad guys\\") or faces (t√©cnicos in Mexico, the \\"good guy\\" characters) as they followed a series of tension-building events, which culminated in a wrestling match or series of matches. The main event for the 2013 Dos Leyenda show was a direct result of a long-running slowly building storyline between the Japanese duo of Namajague and Okumura, collectively known as La Fiebre Amarilla (\\"The Yellow Fever\\") and Mexican high-fliers Stuka Jr. and Rey Cometa. Namajague, the masked identity of New Japan Pro Wrestling (NJPW) rookie Kyosuke Mikami, made his debut in CMLL a few weeks prior to the 2012 Homenaje a Dos Leyendas show as part of CMLL's working arrangement with NJPW. He was immediately teamed up with Okumura, CMLL's resident Japanese wrestler who often acts both as a tag team partner, mentor, and translator for Japanese wrestlers touring with CMLL. In the year since Namajague's debut La Fievre Amarilla had several unsuccessful title matches against Stuka Jr. and Fuego for the latter's CMLL Arena Coliseo Tag Team Championship. Through the series of Arena Coliseo Tag Team matches Namajague began targeting Stuka Jr. specifically, more intent on hurting and humiliating him including tearing Stuka Jr.'s mask open during the match. In late 2012 the two began facing off on opposite sides of Six-man tag team matches on various weekly Super Viernes shows, CMLL's main weekly show. In November Stuka Jr. often teamed with Rey Cometa to take on the Japanese team and Puma King, initially as a continuation of the storyline between Rey Cometa and Puma King, who had unmasked Rey Cometa at the CMLL 79th Anniversary Show, but began to morph into focusing on the escalating issues between Stuka Jr./Rey Cometa and Fiebre Amarilla. On the November 2, 2012 Super Viernes the match started out with Rey Cometa and Puma King being the focal point of the match, but Okumura won the third and deciding fall for his team when he took advantage of a distracted referee to land an illegal low blow on Stuka Jr. A few weeks later, on the November 23 Super Viernes La Fiebre was on the opposite side of Rey Cometa once again and Namajague tried once again to win the match by illegal means, only to be caught by the referee and disqualified as a result of his actions. On the last Super Viernes of 2012 La Fiebre teamed up with Vangelis to defeat the team of Fuego, Rey Cometa and Stuka Jr. The victory earned La Fiebre another match against the CMLL Arena Coloseo Tag Team Champions. During the title match Namajague, Namajague tried to trick Stuka Jr. into getting disqualified by pulling his own mask off and throwing it to Stuka Jr. to make it look like it was pulled off, which is a disqualification offense in Lucha Libre. Stuka Jr. reacted quickly before the referee noticed and put the mask back on Namajague and then pinned his surprised opponent. The January 4, 2013 Super Viernes saw the rivalry continue as Stuka Jr. and Okumura was on opposite sides of a six-man tag team match, won by Stuka Jr.'s team, while Rey Cometa defeated Namajague by disqualification when Namajague tried to use a low blow on his opponent. Over the next coulple of weeks Stuka Jr. and Namajague found themselves on opposite sides of six-man tag team matches, teaming with a number of different partners which did not always include Rey Cometa or Okumura. Both Rey Cometa and Namajague took part in the 2013 CMLL Reyes del Aire (\\"Kings of the Air\\") tournament on February 2, 2013 but due to their interaction and a mistimed move Namajague ended up landing wrong during a dive to the floor and had to be taken to the hospital, while moments later Rey Cometa also ended up hurt. Both accidents looked so bad that it put their participation in the follow week's Super Viernes in question, but in the end Rey Cometa teamed with Stuka Jr. and El Hijo del Fantasma to take on and defeat Namajague, Okumura and Misterioso Jr.. Following the February 8 match Stuka Jr. challenged Namajague to put his mask on the line in a Lucha de Apuesta, or bet match, an offer that Okumura \\"in his role as leader of Fiebre Amarilla\\" declined the challenge, wanting to face Stuka Jr. himself. Rey Cometa responded to that challenge by issuing a team challenge, with himself and Stuka Jr. against La Fiebre Amarilla for the team's mask and hair to be on the line. During the introductions to a six-man tag team match on February 15, 2013 Stuka Jr. and Namajague started to argue while still in the aisle to the ring, only for Stuka Jr. to be attacked from behind by another Namajague. The first Namajague was revealed as Okumura as the two beat Stuka Jr. down. The Japanese team lost the match by disqualification after unmasking Stuka Jr. in the second fall. Following the match Okumura said they accepted the tag team challenge. On Thursday February 21, 2013 CMLL held a press conference announcing, among other things, that the match between the two teams would officially take place at the 2013 Homenaje a Dos Leyendas as the main event of the show. On March 3, 2013 La Ola Amarilla defeated Stuka Jr. and Fuego to win the CMLL Arena Coliseo Tag Team Championship in a match that ended in controversy as Stuka Jr.'s shoulder was not on the mat during the count of three, something the referee did not see. Another featured match on the 2013 Homenaje a Dos Leyendas would be the finals of the 4th annual Torneo Nacional de Parejas Increibles (\\"National Incredible Pairs Tournament\\") that started with a qualifying block on the March 1st Super Viernes, followed by a second qualifying block on the March 8th Super Viernes show. The tournament is based on the Lucha Libre Parejas Increibles match type where two wrestlers of opposite allegiance, portraying either villains, referred to as \\"Rudos\\" in Lucha Libre wrestling terminology or fan favorites, or \\"tecnicos\\". At times some of the team members were part of a pre-existing scripted feuds or storylines with each other. In previous years the winning team has been given a trophy and general recognition while the storyline tension between one or more of the other teams has led to main event matches on major CMLL shows later in the year. The team of La Sombra and Volador Jr., former teammates and holders of the CMLL World Tag Team Championship, turned enemies defeated the team of Mr. Niebla and Shocker in the Block A semi-finals to earn a spot in the finals of the tournament. Block B saw the odds on favorite team of rivals Atlantis and √öltimo Guerrero qualify for the finals by defeating the teams of Valiente and P√≥lvora, and Diamante Azul and Euforia in the preliminary rounds and then defeated the team of Drag√≥n Rojo Jr. and Niebla Roja to earn a spot in the finals. Despite being involved in a long running storyline between the two they worked together without problems, harking back to the time where both wrestlers were part of Los Guerreros de la Atlantida (\\"The Warriors of Atlantis\\") The 2013 Torneo Nacional de Parejas Increibles would feature two teams that used to team up on a regular basis but had since then developed long running, heated rivalries. On February 21, 2013 CMLL held a press conference to officially announce that the Homena a Dos Leyendas would pay tribute to Rayo de Jalisco (\\"The Lighting from Jalisco\\") and brought out Rayo's son, Rayo de Jalisco Jr., as part of the announcement. Rayo de Jalisco Jr. had not worked for CMLL since 2010 but made a special appearance due to the company honoring his father. During the press conference Rayo de Jalisco Jr.'s long time rival Universo 2000 interrupted Rayo de Jalisco Jr. and the two ended up challenging each other to a match that would take place at the 2013 Homenaje a Dos Leyendas, although the exact nature of the match was not announced at the time. The rivalry between the two wrestlers hailed back to at least 1997 where Universo 2000 defeated both Cien Caras and Rayo de Jalisco Jr. to win the CMLL World Heavyweight Championship. Universo 2000 defended the title three times during his reign: against Brazo de Plata, M√°scara Sagrada, and Rayo de Jalisco Jr., before losing the championship to Rayo de Jalisco Jr. on September 13, 1998. Universo 2000 regained the title on December 10, 1999 Universo 2000's second reign became a recordbreaking reign in several areas, it was the longest to date as it lasted 1,225 days. He also became the champion with most successful title defenses in one reign including eight defenses against Rayo de Jalisco Jr. during their long running rivalry. After being masked since his debut in 1985 Universo 2000 lost a Lucha de Apuesta match to El Canek in the main event of the 71st Anniversary Show, on September 17, 2004, the match also included Rayo de Jalisco Jr. and Dr. Wagner Jr. and originally came about due to the Universo 2000/Rayo de Jalisco Jr. rivalry. Following his unmasking Universo 2000 won the 2004 Leyenda de Azul (Blue legend tournament). In subsequent years both Universo 2000 and Rayo de Jalisco Jr. left CMLL. In 2005 Rayo de Jalisco Jr. suffered another serious injury, he injured both his knees in a match against Universo 2000's brother M√°scara A√±o 2000, where his legs got caught on the ropes as he jumped out of the ring and he tore ligaments in both knees. The injury kept him out of the ring for almost half a year but in the end Rayo de Jalisco Jr. was able to make a full recovery and return to the ring. The incident was used by several promoters as well as Rayo de Jalisco Jr. himself to create more interest in matches between himself and Universo 2000, Cien Caras and M√°scara A√±o 2000. Rayo de Jalisco Jr. made his return to CMLL in May, 2010, siding with the CMLL loyalists in their feud with Los Invasores, especially Invasore members Universo 2000 and M√°scara A√±o 2000, reiginting the long running storyline between them. But Rayo, Universo and Cien Caras only worked a select few dates for CMLL before leaving again. The official match between the long time rivals saw each team up with participants of the 2013 Torneo Parejas Increibles, only in this case they were on opposite sides instead of teaming up. Rayo de Jalisco Jr. would team up with Shocker and Rush while Universo 2000 would team up with Shocker's rival Mr. Niebla and Rush's rival El Terrible. Shocker and Mr. Niebla had a long backstory between then, having actually worked together as a regular tag team in the late 1990s. In 1998 the two defeated Dr. Wagner Jr. and Emilio Charles Jr. to win the CMLL World Tag Team Championship and would subsequently defend the tag team championship against teams such as Blue Panther and Black Warrior, Bestia Salvaje and Scorpio Jr. and the Hermanas Dinamita (Cien Caras and Universo 2000). In October, 1998 Mr. Niebla suffered an injury during a match, an injury that was so severe that Mr. Niebla was forced to vacate the Tag Team title. Upon his return Mr. Niebla continued to team with Shocker but the team were not able to win the Tag Team title back. On September 24, 1999, at the CMLL 66th Anniversary Show, the team of Nr. Niebla and Shocker faced Atlantis and Villano III in a Relevos suicida match, a match where the losing team would fight each other for their mask. In the main event match of CMLL's 66th Anniversary show, Atlantis and Villano III defeated the much less experienced team, afterwards Mr. Niebla defeated Shocker to unmask him. In the years since Shocker's unmasking the two have wrestled each other on numerous occasions, both in CMLL and other promotions. The two teamed up for the Parejas Increibles tournament and made it to the semi-final but lost to La Sombra and Volador Jr. when the tension between the two became a distraction in the match. The rivalry between Rush and El Terrible started when El Terrible defeated Rush in the finals of a tournament to determine a holder of the CMLL World Heavyweight Championship on January 1, 2012. The two were also paired up for the 2012 Torneo Nacional de Parejas Increibles, and in the weeks leading up to the tournament Rush stated that he was willing to set aside his differences with El Terrible as he wanted to win the Parejas Increibles tournament, despite the two having developed a heated rivalry over the last number of months. After getting along and qualifying for the final match Rush and El Terrible's miscommunication and dissension allowed their opponents to win the match and the tournament. Following the match Rush took a microphone and berated both El Terrible and the fans for their actions that night and then followed it up by challenging El Terrible to a Luchas de Apuestas, hair vs. hair match at a later date. El Terrible did not accept the challenge at that point in time. The two faced off in the main event of the CMLL 79th Anniversary Show in a Lucha de Apuestas, hair vs. hair match that was won by Rush. The storyline continued to develop in the months following the anniversary event and included El Terrible successfully defending the CMLL World Heavyweight Championship against Rush on January 22, 2013. The two rivals were simply unable to get along from the beginning, causing them to be eliminated in the first round of the Parejas Increibles tournament by Drag√≥n Rojo Jr. and Niebla Roja. The second Luchas de Apuestas match announced for the 2013 Homenaje a Dos Leyendas show would see two wrestlers from CMLL's female division both put their hair on the line in a one-on-one match between Estrellita and La Amapola. For years La Amapola had been the top ranked female wrestler in CMLL, including a record long run with the CMLL World Women's Championship. Before 2010 Estrellita worked for 10 years for CMLL's main Mexican rival AAA, but in September 2010 Estrellita appeared in CMLL as part of a group called Los Invasores, former AAA wrestlers playing off a storyline that they were \\"invading\\" CMLL. This marked the first time that Estrellita worked as ruda (Bad guy character). She made her first appearance at a major CMLL show when she teamed up with Tiffany and Mima Shimoda only to lose to Dark Angel, Luna M√°gica and Marcela as part of the 2010 Sin Piedad show. A few months later she would split from Los Invasores as she had a falling out with Tiffany and returned to her tecnica ways. In the fall of 2012 Amapola and Estrellita began facing off more and more as part of six-man tag team matches, often with La Amapola attacking Estrellita before or after the match, targeting the \\"outsider\\" repeatedly. Estrellita defeated Princesa Blanca to win the Mexican National Women's Championship, CMLL's secondary female title, which made her a bigger target for La Amapola. In the weeks leading up to the announcement of the Luchas de Apuestas match Estrellita had made several challenges to her rival, trying to get La Amapola to put her hair on the line against Estrellita. Each time La Amapola refused, citing that she would not risk her hair unless she got a match for the Mexican Nation Women's Championship in return. The Championship match was not mentioned when the hair vs. hair match was announced for Homenaje a Dos Leyendas. In the days leading up to the event Estrellita stated during an interview that she had often been criticized for her wrestling skills which made her work harder and seek out the hardest opponents to beat and that win or lose she hoped her efforts in the match would silence some of these critics. The second match of the night saw long time rivals as captains of opposite teams as La M√°scara teams with M√°scara Dorada and Valiente and Averno leads the rest of his group Los Hijos del Averno (\\"The Sons of Hell\\"; Mephisto and Ephesto) against each other. The rivalry between the two dates back to early 2011 when the two began a long running, very high-profile storyline feud between the two. The highlight of the storyline came at the 2011 Juicio Final show where La M√°scara defeated Averno in a Luchas de Apuestas match and forced Averno to unmask as a result. The two clashed on multiple occasions after the mask match, with the tension being evident in almost all matches. The two were teamed up for both the 2012 and the 2013 Torneo Nacional de Parejas Increibles tournaments. During the 2012 tournament the team only coexisted long enough to defeat the team of Valiente and Ol√≠mpico in the first round, but the dissension between the two cost them their second-round match to eventual tournament winners Atlantis and Mr. Niebla. In the 2013 tournament the duo defeated El Hijo de Fantasma and El Felino in the first round, but lost to La Sombra and Volador Jr. in the second round. M√°scara Dorada and Mephisto had also teamed up for the 2013 Torneo Nacional de Parejas Increibles, not so much out of any existing storyline reasons as perhaps more to develop a rivalry between the two. They defeated M√°ximo and Mr. √Åguila in the first round, but were defeated by Shocker and Mr. Niebla in the second round of the tournament. The first match of the show featured a rare teaming of the father/sons team of El Felino teaming with Puma and Tiger, something that had only happened on rare occasions and never at a major CMLL event before. The Casas family (Felino and sons) would face off against two thirds of Los Reyes de la Atlantida (\\"The Kings of Atlantis\\") Delta and Guerrero Maya Jr., teaming up with Trit√≥n for a match that had no real storyline behind it. =Homage to Salvador Lutteroth and Rayo de Jalisco= In September 1933 Salvador Lutteroth Gonz√°lez founded Empresa Mexicana de Lucha Libre (EMLL), which would later be renamed Consejo Mundial de Lucha Libre. Over time Lutteroth would become responsible for building both Arena Coliseo in Mexico City and Arena Mexico, which became known as \\"The Cathedral of Lucha Libre\\". Over time EMLL became the oldest wrestling promotion in the world, with 2018 marking the 85th year of its existence. Lutteroth has often been credited with being the \\"father of Lucha Libre\\", introducing the concept of masked wrestlers to Mexico as well as the Luchas de Apuestas match. Lutteroth died on September 5, 1987. EMLL, late CMLL, remained under the ownership and control of the Lutteroth family as first Salvador's son Chavo Lutteroth and later his grandson Paco Alonso took over ownership of the company. In 2013 CMLL decided that their Homenaje a Dos Leyendas show would pay tribute to M√°ximino \\"Max\\" Linares Moreno, better known to the wrestling world as Rayo de Jalisco Rayo de Jalisco's wrestling career spanned 49 years, from 1950 until his retirement in 1989, shortly after losing a high- profile Luchas de Apuestas to Blue Demon and was forced to unmask. Over the years he formed highly successful duos with both Blue Demon and El Santo, Rayo and El Santo won the Mexican National Tag Team Championship on two occasions. He also won the NWA World Middleweight Championship three times and the Occidente Welterweight Championship. Linares, as Rayo de Jalisco, also starred in a number of Lucha films in the early 1970s including, Superzam el Invencible (\\"Superzam the invincible\\"), El Robo de las Momias de Guanajuato (\\"The Robbery of the Mummies of Guanajuato\\"), Vuelven Los Campeones Justicieros (\\"Becoming the Champions of Justice\\") and El Triunfo de los Campeones Justicieros (\\"The Triump of the Champions of Justice\\"). In 1996, he was inducted into the Wrestling Observer Hall of Fame. Linares' son made his professional wrestling debut in 1975 and has worked for most of his career as Rayo de Jalisco Jr. and is still an active wrestler. His grandson currently wrestles under the ring name Rayman, after at one point working as \\"El Hijo de Rayo de Jalisco Jr.\\" (\\"The Son of Rayo de Jalisco Jr.\\"). Rayo de Jalisco Jr. had worked for CMLL as recent as 2010, Event The Dos Leyendas show featured a new entrance set up by CMLL, featuring three large video screens and separate staircases for the rudos and tecnicos to come down during their introductions. The crowd was estimated to be over 14,000 spectators in total, which was a significant improvement compared to the attendance of the Super Viernes shows of the previous weeks, which had drawn less than half those numbers. In the opening match La Dinast√≠a Casas (\\"The Casas Dynasty\\") of El Felino and his sons Puma and Tiger shows their team unity with their black and white ring gear as well as Puma and Tiger both wearing masks that combined their own mask design with that of their brother. While the team of Delta, Guerrero Maya Jr. and Trit√≥n came ready to fight El Felino was fired up and motivated by teaming with his sons, which showed in his performance in the match. Puma and Tiger had been at odds at times before the show, but there was no signs of dissension during the match as La Dinast√≠a Casas won both the second and third fall, taking the final fall with Tiger and Puma pinning their opponents. The second match clearly demonstrated that Los Hijos del Averno (Averno, Mephisto and Ephesto) work as a well functioning team due to their many years of experience from teaming together, the three managed to win the first fall over La M√°scara, M√°scara Dorada and Valiente in convincing fashion, so much so that the Arena Mexico crowd were cheering for the team despite them being the rudos in the match. During the second fall the high flying moves and skills of M√°scara Dorada was the only time the crowd would cheer for the tecnico side, supporting them as they won the second fall. In the third and deciding fall Averno got the pinfall victory for his team, giving Los Hijos del Averno a very appreciated victory. Just as in the previous match, the Arena Mexico crowd was decidedly \\"pro rudo\\" for the first Luchas de Apuestas match, supporting La Amapola as she faced off against \\"La M√°s Bonita\\" Estrellita in the third match of the night. Throughout most of the match the crowd chanted for La Amapola and booed when Estrellita was in control of the match. Estrellita was seconded by La M√°scara for this important match while La Amapola had Ephesto in her corner for the night, neither corner man was based on any existing, ongoing storylines. Estrellita won the first fall in quick fashion when she used the La Casita cradle hold to get the three count. In the second fall La Fleur Lethal, as La Amapola is also known, got the upper hand and quickly evened the score between the two. The third fall was longer, more drawn out than the first two falls combined and saw La Amapola almost win on more than one occasion. In the end Estrellit trapped her opponent in an armbar submission hold and managed to keep La Amapola away from the ring ropes. With no way of escaping La Amapola reluctantly gave up and lost the third fall and thus the match. A visibly infuriated La Amapola stood in the center of the ring as all of her long blond hair was shaved off as per the match stipulation, she even grabbed the clippers and did part of the shaving herself. After the haircut Estrellita displayed La Amapola's hair, celebrating a victory that seemed to not be popular with the Arena Mexico crowd but was expected. CMLL held their tribute to Rayo de Jalisco and Salvador Lutteroth after the ring was cleared from the Luchas de Apuetas match. Rayo de Jalisco Sr. came to the ring wearing his trademark lightingbolt mask and was accompanied by his son as well as Atlantis and M√°scara Dorada for the ceremony. The fans showed their appreciation of the lucha libre legend by giving him a standing ovation as he was presented with a plaque commemorating the event. Atlantis and M√°scara Dorada escorted the almost 80-year-old Rayo de Jalisco to the back while Rayo Jr. remained in the right for the fourth match of the night. Rayo Jr.'s partner Rush was introduced to the crowd, but before they could bring out Shocker Universo 2000 came through the crowd and attacked Rayo de Jalisco Jr. from behind. Moments later Shocker, Mr. Niebla and El Terrible all rushed to the ring and the opening portion of the match was chaos with all six wrestlers in the ring at the same time. The brawl saw the wrestlers pair off with their natural rivals, Shocker and Mr. Niebla, Rush and El Terrible and Rayo de Jalisco Jr. and Universo 2000. The rudo team took advantage of the confusion and cheated their way into winning the first fall. During the second fall Universo 2000 made a mistake, giving Rayo de Jalisco Jr. the opportunity to tie the match up at one fall each. During the third and final fall the 53-year-old Rayo de Jalisco Jr. actually leap off the top rope onto Universo 2000 on the floor. The third fall ended without a decisive victory as Universo 2000 decided to land a foul, low kick on Rayo de Jalisco Jr. drawing a disqualification from the referee. Both sets of finalists for the 2013 Torneo Nacional de Parejas Increibles had stated that they were willing to set aside their rivalry for at least one night to win the tournament, a sentiment that the former \\"Super Sky Team\\" of La Sombra and Volador Jr. demonstrated by wearing similar right gear to the ring. They both wore black masks, shirts and tights with white markings reminiscent of the \\"skeleton\\" image used by Volador Jr.'s uncle L.A. Park and Volador Jr.'s father Super Parka. Despite statements that they would get along the team of Atlantis and √öltimo Guerrero had some problems during the first fall causing them to lose to La Sombra and Volador Jr. With the second fall being their last change the former Los Guerreros de la Atlantida began to work together more, relying on their many years of experience as a team, winning the second fall when they both applied Atlantis' Atlantida, a spinning backbreaker rack, to the former Super Sky Team to gain a submission victory in the second fall. The third fall proved to be the tipping point between Atlantis and √öltimo Guerrero while La Sombra and Volador Jr. managed to set aside their personal differences for one night. The third and final fall was won by Volador Jr. and La Sombra when La Sombra pinned Atlantis after a top rope Asai Moonsault. While the winners celebrated Atlantis and Guerrero argued and almost fought before being separated by CMLL officials. After the match both wrestlers made challenges for the other to put their mask on the line at a future date, before settling on the shorter term with a singles match between the two for the follow week's CMLL Super Viernes show, proposed as a match with no referee and thus no disqualification. The main event match between the Mexican team and the Japanese La Fiebre Amarilla started out with the tecnico side showing a bit of unity as Stuka Jr. wore a mask that was a combination of his own and the mask style Rey Cometa had worn until September, 2012. Namajague also wore a mask created specifically for the occasion, featuring long, bright red hair attached to his mask. Okumura and Namajague sought to get an easy advantage by jumping their opponents before the bell, but based on the two teams previous history Stuka Jr. and Rey Cometa were prepared for it and took control of the match for the early parts of the match. After several minutes of being on the defensive La Fievre Amarilla double teamed their way into control of the match and won the first fall of the match. The rudo duo continued to dominate throughout most of the second fall, but this time the Mexican team was able to overcome this and even the match with one fall to each team. Initially the crowd was quiet for the match, but by the end of the second fall the Mexico City fans were solidly cheering \\"Mexico\\" to support the home team. At one point a mistake between Stuka Jr. and Rey Cometa saw the team almost fight each other, each thinking the other one intentionally knocked them down. After a few moments cooler heads prevailed and Stuka Jr. and Rey Cometa turned their attention back towards their Japanese rivals for the third and final fall. In the third fall Stuka Jr. pinned Okumura to eliminate him from the match, while he himself being pinned by Namajague only moments later. This left Namajague and Rey Cometa in the ring, with the next elimination deciding which side lost the match. After several moments of high flying, fast-paced wrestling Rey Cometa was able to execute a 450 degree splash off the top rope to Namajague for the final elimination. The crowd showed their appreciation for the performance of both Mexicans, cheering them on as brightly colored confetti dropped from the ceiling covering the defeated Okumura and Namajague. While Stuka Jr. and Rey Cometa celebrated Okumura had all his hair shaved off while sitting in the middle of the ring, paying off on the \\"bet\\" he placed on the match. Subsequently, Namajague removed his wrestling mask to show the audience his face and announced that his name was Kyosuke Mikami, 29 years old and five years as a professional wrestler to close the show. Aftermath The main event was not the end of the storyline between Rey Cometa and Namajague as they continued to clash in the weeks after the Dos Leyendas show, including one match where Namajague attacked Rey Cometa with a pane of glass, breaking it over Cometa's head. Stuka Jr. and Okumura only played a very small part in the storyline as the two agreed to a one-on-one Lucha de Apuestas at the Arena Mexico 57th Anniversary Show where both men would put their hair on the line. Backstage after the show Atlantis challenged √öltimo Guerrero to name the date and he would put his mask on the line against Guerrero in a Luchas de Apuestas. The challenges between Atlantis and √öltimo Guerrero led to them being booked in the main event of the March 22, 2013 CMLL Super Viernes show, albeit in a regular one-on-one match and not the \\"No disqualification\\" match that Atlantis suggested after their tournament loss. In the weeks following the show CMLL held a press conference where the two wrestlers signed a contract for a Lucha de Apuestas between the two with both men putting their masks on the line. No official date was given for the match but there was speculation that it would take place at the CMLL 80th Anniversary Show in October 2013. The two rivals found themselves on opposite sides in the semi- finals of the 2013 Gran Alternativa tournament. The tournament saw Atlantis team up with rookie Hombre Bala Jr. while √öltimo Guerrero teamed up with Guerrero Negro Jr.. After both teams won their first two matches the semi- finals saw Atlantis and Hombre Bala Jr. defeat the two Guerreros to earn a spot in the finals of the tournament. In the week following his tournament victory Atlantis was quoted as saying that \\"√öltimo Guerrero would look good in my trophy case\\". The truce between La Sombra and Volador Jr. that allowed them to win the tag team tournament only lasted until the next time the two rivals were in the same ring. On Sunday February 17, 2013 La Sombra teamed up with Marco Corleone and M√≠stico La Nueva Era against Volador Jr. Euforia and √öltimo Guerrero. During the match Volador Jr. attacked both La Sombra and the referee, causing a disqualification before leaving the ring and his confused partners behind. Reception Prior to the show Alez Ruiz Glez, writer for the Mexican SuperLuchas Magazine stated that the show looked very attractive and he would expect good matches, especially the Apuesta matches. The Cub's Fan of the Luchablog website was surprised to see the tag team Luchas de Apuestas match as the main event since it was usually featured in the second or third match of the shows leading up to Homenaje a Dos Leyendas. =Results=References 2013 in professional wrestling 2013 ","title":"Homenaje a Dos Leyendas (2013)"},{"id":"38603916","text":"Johann Beck may refer to: * Johann Nepomuk Beck (1827‚Äì1904), Hungarian operatic baritone * Johann Heinrich Beck (1856‚Äì1924), American composer and conductor * Johann Georg Beck (1676‚Äì1722), German engraver * Johann Tobias Beck (1804‚Äì1878), German theologian ","title":"Johann Beck"},{"id":"38603932","text":"Valter Vissarionovich Sanaya (also spelled Walter Sanaya; ; 24 September 1925 ‚Äì 29 October 1999) was a Soviet football player.

History Before partition of India in 1947, there was a rail link to Lalmonirhat Junction, now in Bangladesh, through Geetaldaha and Mogalhat. Even in 1955 the line was there when there were talks between India and Pakistan for resumption of rail links. Up to the 1960s there was a railway link from Cooch Behar to Dhubri via Golokganj. It was then known as the Assam Line Railway Service. The links were disturbed with bridges being washed away. The entire area had metre gauge tracks. Northeast Frontier Railway converted the Alipurduar‚ÄìBamanhat branch line to road gauge in 2007. The Alipuduar- Bamanhat branch line up to Geetaldaha was earlier part of Cooch Behar State Railway. The Geetaldaha-Bamanhat sector was part of what was called the Assam Line Railway Service. Prior to the partition of India, the prestigious Assam Mail used to travel from Santahar to Guwahati. The map alongside presents the position as it stands today (2020). The international border was not there when the railways were first laid in the area in the 19th-20th century. It came up in 1947.

It is the negative of Bhava which means being, becoming, existing or appearance. Overview Uddayana divides PadƒÅrtha (Categories) into Bhava (existence) which is real, and Abhava (non-existence) which is not real. Dravya (substance), Gu·πáa (quality), Karma (action), Samanya (community or generality), Visesa (particularity or partimerity) and Samavaya (inherence) are the marks of existence. Abhava has not been categorically defined by the Vaisheshika School of Hindu philosophy but is of four kinds viz ‚Äì 1) Pragabhava i.e. Prior non- existence, 2) Pradhvamsabhava i.e. Posterior non-existence, 3) Atyantabhava i.e. Absolute non-existence, and 4) Anyonyabhava i.e. Mutual non-existence. # Pragabhava i.e. Prior non-existence, is the non-existence of an effect in its material cause before production; it has a beginning it has an end because it is destroyed by the production of the effect. Without prior non-existence there cannot be an effect. # Pradhvamsabhava i.e.Posterior non-existence, is the non-existence of an effect by its destruction; as such it has a beginning but no end i.e. it cannot be destroyed. # Atyantabhava i.e. Absolute non- existence, or absolute negation is non-existence in all times i.e. denial of an absolutely non-existent entity in all times and in all places. It is the state of absolute abstraction. # Anyonyabhava i.e. Mutual non-existence, is denial of identity between two things, which have specific nature. Negation other than mutual negation is negation of relation. The process with which the sound value collapses into the point value of the gap existing between the first and the next syllable of the first letter of the Rigveda, Agnim, is Pradhvamsabhava, the silent point of all possibilities within the gap is Atyantabhava, the structuring dynamics of what happens within the gap Anyonyabhava, and the mechanics by which the sound emerges from the point value of the gap i.e. emergence of the following syllable, is Pragabhava; this mechanism is inherent in both syllables. The Vaisheshika, the Nyaya, the Bhatta Mimamsa and Dvaita schools hold Abhava as a distinct category. Recognised as a reality by the Nyaya school, Abhava is often stated to be the reality of the greatest moment in the pluralistic universe and is connected with Mukti. It is a relative word, for there can be abhava only when previously there is bhava; moreover it is an event occurring in time. The Nyaya and the Siddhantin maintain that the cognition of abhava is due to perception involving special kind of contact or sense contact. Abhava is that unmanifest level from where the concrete Bhava arises or emerges. Vasubandhu has referred to Sunyata having the characteristic of the own-being of abhava, rather than a characteristic consisting of bhava which Sthiramati observes is in fact not redundant, which means abhava does not negate bhava. Abhava refers to particular entities and not to Being ; it is a theoretical or logical denial of the existence of some particular impossibility. The acceptance of abhava as an independent padartha having ontological reality of its own is a peculiar feature of Indian philosophical tradition. Dharmakirti considered abhava as an anumana. He had brought in the idea of imaginary presence of that whose absence was apprehended in order to explain the specificity of the absence.

It is the only trilobite known with just two thorax segments outside most members of the Agnostida order. It can be distinguished from Agnostida by the very wide subquadrate glabella (about half the cephalon), parallel-side or widening forward in the largest specimen, with the full front side touching the border. Two species are known, one, T. idahoensis, only from pygidia.  Etymology  Thoracocare is derived from the Greek Œ∏œéœÅŒ±Œæ (thorax) meaning \\"breastplate\\" and ·ºÄŒ∫Œ±œÅŒÆœÇ (akares) meaning \\"tiny\\".  Distribution  *T. minuta is known from the Middle Cambrian of the United States (Glossopleura-zone, Spence Tongue Member, Lead Bell Shale/Spence Shale Formation, Idaho, 42.0¬∞ N, 112.0¬∞ W). *T. idahoensis was collected from the Middle Cambrian of the United States (Glossopleura-zone, north side of Two Mile Canyon, Malad Range, and the top bed of the Naomi Peak Limestone, both in Idaho; lower and middle Albertella-zone, Belted Range, Nevada)  Ecology  Thoracocare minuta occurs in the same deposit as Pagetia rugosa, Pentagnostus bonnerensis, Elrathina spencei, Oryctocare sp., Oryctocephalus walcotti, and Ogygopsis typicalis. Scholars consider that Thoracocare minuta may have lived in the water column (a pelagic lifestyle) rather than on the seafloor.  Description  Thoracocare is a very small to minute trilobite (1.7 ‚Äì 3.6 mm long in adulthood), with an elliptical body outline. The headshield (or cephalon) and tailshield (or pygidium) are of approximately same size (or isopygous) with 2 thoracic segments between them. The central raised area of the cephalon (or glabella) is broad, subrectangular, tapering slightly to the back in larger specimens and touching the frontal border, and without transverse furrows. Fixed cheeks are subtriangular. Free cheeks are rarely present. Dorsal sutures are proparian. The pygidium is subcircular, about 1‚Öî√ó as wide as long. The segmentation of the pygidial axis (or rhachis) and pleura is indiscernible or very weak. The rhachis is about ‚Öì of the pygidial width anteriorly, tapering evenly backwards. There is no pygidial border. There may be small spines extending from the frontal corners of the pygidium. = Differences with other Corynexochida = All other known corynexochoid genera have at least five thorax segments. Other early (Middle Cambrian) species also differ by having less wide glabellas and better defined pygidial furrows. = Differences with Agnostida = In Thoracocare minuta the glabella is more than ‚Öì of the width of the cephalon, is parallel sided or expands forward and reaches the frontal border. It also lacks a pygidial border.

Established in 1936, it is situated next to the historic Beyazƒ±t Tower within the main campus of the university at Beyazƒ±t Square in Fatih district of Istanbul, Turkey. History Soon after the foundation of the Faculty of Science at Istanbul University in 1933, German astronomer Erwin Finlay-Freundlich was invited to direct the Department of Astronomy. He suggested to establish an observatory. The observatory building with dome was designed by architect Arif Hikmet Holtay. Its grounbreaking took place in December 1935, and the construction, conducted by Ekrem Hakkƒ± Ayverdi, was completed within six months. It became ready for use in the summer of 1936. As the main instrument of the observatory, an astrograph was ordered to Carl Zeiss Jena in Germany on December 11, 1935. The instrument arrived in Istanbul disassembled in twelve pieces on September 25, 1936, and was installed in the observatory's dome. The facility started its observations in the fall of 1936. It is the first modern observatory of Turkey. The air and light pollution in downtown Istanbul, where the observatory is located, make it impossible to conduct night observations. For conducting night sky studies, the department initiated a project to establish an observatory at the Onsekiz Mart University in √áanakkale, which was realized in 2002. Instruments Currently, the observatory consists of following telescopes and instruments: ;Astrograph * Diameter: * Focal ratio: f/5 * Focal length: * Max. size of photographic plate at focal plane: ;Photosphere telescope * Diameter: * Focal ratio: f/15 * Focal length: Used for the observation of sun spots and plage areas. ;Chromosphere telescope * Diameter: * Focal ratio: f/19 * Focal length: Used for the observation of the structure and interesting phenomena of Sun's chromosphere supported with a monochromator (H-alpha Lyot filter)and a camera (Canon F-1) placed on the focal plane. ;Pilot telescope * Diameter: * Focal ratio: f/13 * Focal length:  References External links Astronomical observatories in Turkey Observatory Buildings and structures in Istanbul Fatih 1936 establishments in Turkey ","title":"Istanbul University Observatory"},{"id":"38604033","text":"Nick Jr. India is a channel devoted to toddlers and a part of the Nickelodeon India franchise.

Personal life She was born in Bergen as a daughter of priest Johan Cordt Harmens Storjohann (1832‚Äì1914) and Nanna Storjohann, n√©e Holmboe (1838‚Äì1898). She spent several childhood years in London, where her father was stationed, and later attended school in Germany and the UK. She was a maternal granddaughter of Hans Holmboe and first cousin of Marie Joys. In September 1888 he married theologian Simon Themstrup Michelet (1863‚Äì1942). The couple had three daughters, and one son who died young. Simon Michelet also had a sister named Marie (1872‚Äì1960); she married mathematician Elling Holst. Career Michelet started her career in the public sphere as a children's writer. Her books were originally meant for her own children, but reached a wider audience. Titles include Puk (1901), Hos mormor (1902), I Svalehuset (1902) and Usynlige magter (1906). She was also a teacher at Sandvika Middle School from 1905 to 1910. They resided at Vallerlien in B√¶rum,1900 Census where Simon Michelet's second cousin Christian Fredrik Michelet served as mayor. In the 1910s she mostly wrote books that supported Christianity, motherhood and family, such as Det kristne hjem (1913) and Den selverhvervende kvindelige ungdom (1915). She also began contributing extensively to periodicals and weekly magazines for women. Her organizational platform was Hjemmenes Vel (\\"Welfare of Homes\\"), which sought to improve domestic conditions for women and families. The first had been established in 1898, and in 1915 Michelet was a main initiator behind the foundation of Hjemmenes Vels Landsforbund, a national association. She chaired this organization from 1915 to 1934, overseeing the name change in 1933 to the Norwegian Housewives' Association (from 1997: the Norwegian Women and Family Association). Michelet also chaired the Nordic Housewives' Association from 1933 to 1937, whereupon she became honorary president, and was a leading figure in the International Council of Women. Michelet also served as deputy chair of De norske sedelighetsforeninger, for the combat of vice, from 1902 to 1920. Locally she founded and chaired Asker and B√¶rum Women's Council from 1906 to 1921. Together with Henny Dons and Bolette Gj√∏r among others, she founded the Missionary Workers' Ring in 1907.

His feast day is 4 July. John (or Terence) Carey was an Irish layman, born in Dublin, and servant of Blessed Thomas Bosgrave and was put to death with Blesseds Thomas Bosgrave, John Cornelius (a priest, born of Irish parents in Bodmin in Cornwall), and Patrick Salmon, another lay helper also of Dublin birth, at Dorchester in Dorset in 1594. They were all beatified in 1929. The persecution was part of a crackdown by the Elizabethan government after the passing of the Jesuits, etc. Act 1584, which made it an offence punishable by death to seek ordination to the priesthood overseas and return to England. See List of Catholic martyrs of the English Reformation. Those apprehended suffered a \\"traitor's death\\": partial choking by hanging, then evisceration whilst still alive, and quartering. The authorities hoped that by staging such spectacles the arrival of young, idealistic missionary priests (most of whom were English), inspired by the Counter-Reformation, would be brought to a \\"dead end\\". John Cornelius was chaplain to the Arundell family, which service took him to Chideock Castle, where he was arrested. The two lay helpers, John Carey and Patrick Salmon, were servants at the castle. Thomas Bosgrave was a relative of the Arundells. John Cornelius was accused of high treason, by virtue of being a Catholic priest and returning to England. He joined the Society of Jesus whilst imprisoned. The two lay helpers refused the offer of amnesty though abjuration of their allegiance to Catholicism and conversion to the Protestant faith. John Cornelius suffered the \\"traitor's death\\"; John Carey and the others were hanged. When he mounted the scaffold, Carey is reported as saying aloud \\"Oh, precious collar!\\".

John Higgin was born at Lancaster on 3 August 1823. He was the only child of an infantry officer, Captain Robert Higgin, of the 12th Regiment. His mother, Anne Maria Bellew, a Roman Catholic, who towards the close of 1822, had married Captain Higgin, was the daughter of John Bellew, of Castle Bellew, County Galway, and cousin of Lord Bellew. She was co-heiress under the will of her uncle, Major-general Bellew, heir-at-law of the O'Briens, earls of Thomond. Educated during his earlier years at Lancaster Grammar School, Higgin was entered in 1842 as a student at St Mary Hall, Oxford. On attaining his majority in the autumn of 1844 he assumed his mother's maiden name, and dropped his patronymic. He was induced to do this by the circumstance of his being descended maternally from the senior branch of the O'Briens, and thus a descendant from Teige the second brother of Donough, the fourth earl, brother of Daniel O'Brien, 1st Viscount Clare. Soon after entering the university, he became known as a frequent and effective speaker at the Oxford Union. Bellew met a young widow, Eva Maria Money, and they married on 27 March 1847. Together, they had four children: Evelyn Montesquieu Gambier (born 25 October 1847), Eva Sibyl (born October 1848), Harold Kyrle Money (better known as the famous late 19th century and early 20th century stage actor Kyrle Bellew; born 28 March 1850), and Ida Percy Clare (born 17 June 1852). Bellew received a mensa et thoro from his wife in 1855 on the grounds of adultery and took custody of their children, eventually divorcing her in 1861 and marrying Emily Louisa Wilkinson (n√©e East) in that same year.\\"COURT OF DIVORCE. (Before the Judge Ordinary.) BELLEW V. BELLEW AND EDEN.\\", [The Sun], 15 January 1861; accessed 7 October 2019. Bellew's aptitude for oratory encouraged him to take up a clerical career. Ordained in 1848, he was appointed a curate of St. Andrews in Worcester, and in 1850 transferred to a curacy at Prescot, Lancashire. In the following year he went to the East Indies. There, almost immediately upon his arrival in 1851 at Calcutta, he was nominated chaplain of St. John's Cathedral there. He held that position for four years, during part of which he also wrote for the Morning Post and edited the Bengal Hurkaru. Returning to England in 1855, he was appointed assistant minister of St. Philip's, Regent Street. In 1857 he assumed the sole charge of St. Mark's Hamilton Terrace, Marylebone. That office he held for five years; in 1862 he became incumbent of Bedford Chapel, Bloomsbury. Between 1855-67 he became known as one of the most popular London preachers. It was said that no preacher of his time had greater oratorical gifts by nature, and that no man had taken greater pains than he to improve and cultivate them. He published sermons, a novel (Blount's Tempest), and some work on poetry. In 1868, he converted to Roman Catholicism, his mother's faith and gave up Anglican holy orders on 13 August 1870. In so doing he gave up an income of around ¬£1,000 a year. Bellew continued to write, but became particularly known for his public readings, which were thought comparable to those of Charles Dickens and Fanny Kemble. However, making two American expeditions in rapid succession exhausted Bellew, and he died in his 51st year on 19 June 1874, at 16 Circus Road, St John's Wood, London. He was buried at Kensal Green Cemetery.

He was the son of John Bellin of Chigwell, Essex, and born at Doctors' Commons in London. He trained under the Huguenot James Basire the younger (1769-1822) before spending several years in Rome, where he came to know J. M. W. Turner, Frederick Catherwood and Bertel Thorvaldsen. While in Rome he made some excellent copies of celebrated pictures, and acquired great facility as a draughtsman. Christian Ignatius Latrobe by Samuel Bellin, after Thomas Barber On his return to England, about 1834, he devoted himself to engraving, and became one of the leading workers in mezzotint and the mixed method. His plates, which are all from pictures by popular English painters of the day, include 'The Meeting of the Council of the Anti-Corn Law League,' after J. R. Herbert; 'Heather Belles,' after John Phillip; 'The Council of War in the Crimea,' after Augustus Egg; 'The Gentle Warning,' after Frank Stone; 'The Heart's Resolve,' and 'The Momentous Question,' after Sarah Setchell; 'Milton composing \\"Samson Agonistes,\\"' after J.

The Yoga 11 gets its name from its ability to change form factors thanks to the two-way hinge used to mount its display. It was discontinued on July 17, 2013, due to the poor sales of Windows RT devices.Lenovo drops Yoga 11 hybrid with Windows RT from its online sales PCWorld Features=Design= The Yoga 11 and Yoga 13 computers get their name from their unique design that enables the devices to rotate their screen backwards to become tablet devices. According to PC Pro, \\"The hybrid design is immensely flexible. Prop the Yoga 11 up in 'tent mode', and the touchscreen can be angled just so. Lay the keyboard facing the desk, and the screen can be tilted back and forth while sturdy-feeling hinges keep the display from flopping backwards. Fold the screen all the way back, and hidden magnets hold it clamped shut against the underside, transforming it into a tablet.\\" The Yoga 11 has slim chassis with a matte orange exterior finish and an all-black interior that weighs 2.79 pounds. It has a full-size QWERTY keyboard. According to TechRadar, the \\"large, well-cushioned keys offer a far better experience than Microsoft Surface, and there's a large trackpad as well.\\" =Specifications= The Yoga 11 is powered by a quad-core Nvidia Tegra 3 that runs at a maximum clock speed of 1.3GHZ and features an integrated graphics processor. The Tegra 3 is also found in numerous Android-based tablets. 2GB of RAM comes standard. This relatively small amount of RAM is sufficient due to the reduced memory requirements of Windows RT applications. The Yoga 11 is sold with solid state drives in 32GB and 64GB capacities. The Yoga 11 runs the Windows RT operating system. Microsoft Office 2013 ships pre-installed. Like all Windows RT devices, the Yoga 11 cannot run software designed for earlier versions of Windows, only apps designed for the new Metro interface are compatible. According to performance tests run by TechRadar using SunSpider and Peacekeeper benchmarking software, the Yoga 11 runs slightly slower than the Microsoft Surface RT, which uses the same processor. The Yoga 11 was able to run 9 hours and 32 minutes in battery tests, significantly outperforming the Microsoft Surface RT. In a test conducted by PC Pro the batteries took 11 hours and 58 minutes to run down. The Yoga 11 has an 11.6-inch glossy screen that makes use of in-plane switching technology and runs at a resolution of 1366x768. The screen has a maximum brightness of only 344 nits, but has a measured contrast ratio of 1,146:1. There are two USB 2.0 ports, an SD card reader, a 3.5mm headphone jack, and a standard HDMI output. There is a built- in 720P webcam. =System restore= Windows RT comes with an integrated system restore utility. It is also possible to create a USB recovery drive. An external USB recovery drive is essential in case the data on your hard disk has been compromised up to the point where the system can no longer boot from the hard drive. Reportedly the key combination to have the Lenovo Yoga 11 UEFI firmware boot an external USB drive is \\"Volume Up\\" plus the \\"Windows Key\\" directly below the screen. Reviews In its review TechRadar stated, \\"The Lenovo IdeaPad Yoga 11 is a stylish, lightweight and durable laptop that neatly doubles as a tablet. At 11 inches, it's portable and thin enough to be used in tablet form, but like its bigger brother, having the keys on the reverse affecting your grip makes it far from ideal.If you're looking for a laptop form factor for work, which doubles as a tablet for basic apps and sofa surfing, then the Yoga 11 is worth serious consideration, although we'd advise you to head to your nearest PC superstore to give it the once over. It's not for everyone, and we'd primarily recommend it to someone looking for a small Windows 8 laptop who doesn't want to miss out on enjoying all the touchscreen goodness that Windows 8 has to offer.\\" In its review PC Pro wrote, \\"Place Windows 8 at the helm, and the Yoga 11 would be a tantalising prospect: after all, it‚Äôs an excellent laptop with a 12-hour battery life and useful tablet functions. With most Ultrabooks still struggling to push past the nine-hour mark under the lightest usage, the promise of a well-designed 1.19kg hybrid that lasts all day is incredibly attractive. Once you factor in the presence of Windows RT, however, the appeal of this hybrid swiftly wanes.\\" PC Pro concludes by stating, \\"Don‚Äôt abandon hope yet, however: with Lenovo set to release a Windows 8, Intel-powered Yoga 11S sometime this year, we‚Äôd keep that credit card at the ready.\\" In its review of the Yoga 11, The Inquirer wrote, \\"The Lenovo Ideapad Yoga 11 has a very unique construction and in terms of design alone is perhaps one of our favourite hybrid devices out there now for this reason. It's an ultra-flexible laptop with the option to convert into various different modes, making it a close to ideal multimode device. Its HD display offers a good touchscreen experience as well as high display resolution for its size, and its keyboard performed well, too.

It was the only ship of its class to be built. Launching in 1904, it served with the Portuguese Navy until 1927. Construction and design In 1901 the ship was started in the Naval Arsenal of Lisbon. This was part of a plan to retrofit the Portuguese Navy, a plan implemented during the reign of Carlos I of Portugal. The ship was originally classified as a \\"torpedo- gunboat\\", and was designed to fill the role of gunboat, torpedo boat and destroyer. The ship, displacing 522 tons, was designed to be long with a beam of and a draught of . The engines provided 7000 hp which gave Tejo a speed of . The vessel had a complement of 85. Service history Tejo went into service in 1904, but tests were continued on it until 1906. The initial armament consisted of one gun, one gun, four guns and two torpedo tubes. However, during tests, its broad range of roles limited its effectiveness overall. The decision was then made to transform Tejo completely into a destroyer. After the First Portuguese Republic was established, the ship was recommissioned as NRP Tejo. In 1910, Tejo accidentally ran aground in Peniche and suffered severe damage. Five years later, in 1915, the ship was taken to port to be converted completely to a destroyer. These changes were completed in 1917 and the ship became a full-fledged destroyer. It retained most of its armament, only swapping the 65 mm gun for a gun. While undergoing tests, Tejo proved to be the fastest ship of the Portuguese Navy. Tejo was scrapped in 1927. This was the second ship in Portugal's history to bear the name Tejo. A gunboat in 1868 was the first and a destroyer of the Vouga class - launched in 1935 - was the third.

Life He was born in 1667 at Cambridge, where his father was a solicitor. He was educated at Wivelingham and Eton College, was admitted at Caius College, Cambridge, 20 March 1684, and graduated B.A. and M.A. In 1693 he went to London, and was encouraged in the study of medicine by Sir Thomas Millington. He became M.B. in 1690 and M.D. in 1694. In 1701 he was elected F.R.S., and was admitted fellow of the College of Physicians 30 June 1706.. Drake became disillusioned with his treatment at the hands of some of the Tories. He died of a fever, at Westminster, 2 March 1707. Works In 1697 Drake had a share in a well-known pamphlet called Commendatory Verses upon the Author of Prince Arthur and King Arthur (Richard Blackmore). =Tory controversialist= Drake became known as a vigorous Tory pamphleteer. A New Test of Church of England's Loyalty (1702) by Daniel Defoe was answered by Drake as \\"A True Englishman\\" in Some Necessary Considerations, Relating to All Future Elections of Members to Serve in Parliament (1702). In 1702 also Drake published The History of the Last Parliament, written in the Tory interest with the help of Anthony Hammond.historyofparliamentonline.org, Hammond, Anthony (1668-1738), of Somersham Place, Hunts.; Lidlington, Beds.; Piccadilly and Albemarle Street, Westminster. It accused the Whigs of contemplating a new model of government and of traducing Queen Anne while she was a princess. The House of Lords had been investigating the report that William had plotted to secure the succession to the crown for the Elector of Hanover. Drake's pamphlet was noticed in the course of the debate. He confessed the authorship and was summoned before the House of Lords, which ordered him to be prosecuted. He was tried and acquitted. In 1703 he published Historia Anglo- Scotica, allegedly from a manuscript by an unknown author. It was offensive to presbyterians and was burnt at the Mercat Cross in Edinburgh, 30 June 1703. In 1704 he joined with Henry Poley, MP for Ipswich, in composing The Memorial of the Church of England, humbly offered to the consideration of all true lovers of our Church and Constitution; also involved was William Pittis. (In the past this anonymous work has been attributed to Pittis alone.) There was an answer, Occasional Thoughts (1705) on the Memorial, which is attributed to William Stephens. John Toland was paid to write another reply, Memorial of the State of England. Defoe answered, also, with The High Church Legion, or the Memorial Examined (1705). This pamphlet gave offence to the Duke of Marlborough and Godolphin, who were beginning to separate themselves from the Tories. The book was also presented as a libel by the grand jury of London on 31 August 1705, and burnt by the common hangman. The Queen mentioned it in her speech to the new parliament (27 October 1705). After voting that the church was not in danger, both houses of parliament (14 December) requested the queen to punish persons responsible for scandalous insinuations to the contrary. A proclamation was issued offering reward for the discovery of the authors of the memorial. The printer made a statement implicating three members of the House of Commons, Poley, John Ward III, and Sir Humphry Mackworth, but stated that the pamphlet was brought to him by two women, one of them masked, and the printed copies delivered by him to porters, some of whom were arrested. No further discoveries, however, were made. Drake escaped for the time, but was prosecuted the following spring for some passages in the Mercurius Politicus, a paper of which he was the author. John Hawles acted as his counsel, and a fellow physician John Radcliffe met some legal costs. He was convicted (14 February 1706) of a libel, but there had been a technical error and Drake was acquitted 6 November 1706. The government then brought a writ of error; but meanwhile Drake had died.historyofparliamentonline.org, Hawles, John (1645-1716), of Lincoln‚Äôs Inn.historyofparliamentonline.org, Radcliffe, John (1653-1714), of Wolverton, Bucks., and Carshalton, Surr. In 1706 Drake had also edited an edition of Leicester's Commonwealth, with preface. =Medical works= Veins of the lungs, illustration from Drake's Anthropologia Nova (1707) A medical treatise called Anthropologia Nova, or a New System of Anatomy, was published just before Drake's death in 1707. In it he had the collaboration of William Cowper, for both text and plates. Contractually the book was a legacy of a project involving instead Clopton Havers, author of Osteologia nova (1691), who had died in 1702; and as a consequence used plates copied from Stephan Blancard. Drake's wife Judith edited the work and secured a dedication to Henry Somerset, 2nd Duke of Beaufort. Anthropologia Nova reached a second edition in 1717, and a third in 1727. It was edited by William Wagstaffe, and was popular up to the publication of William Cheselden's Anatomy. Drake had in it a theory of acquired immunity to smallpox, which was then taken up by Clifton Wintringham. Drake's Orationes Tres on medical subjects were printed in 1742, with a preface by Edward Milward. He contributed a paper concerning the influence of respiration on the action of the heart to the Philosophical Transactions. =Other works= Drake also wrote The Sham Lawyer, or the Lucky Extravagant (adapted from John Fletcher's Spanish Curate and Wit without Money), acted in 1697 and printed, according to the title-page, \\"as it was damnably acted at Drury Lane\\". He is also said to have written The Antient and Modern Stages Reviewed (1700), one of the replies to Jeremy Collier, and prefixed a life to the works of Tom Brown (1707). Family His wife was Judith Drake, a medical practitioner as well as a writer. The baptism of a daughter Ann is recorded. There was also a son James, who gained the M.D. degree.

He was born at Manchester, where his father, after whom he was named, was a practising surgeon in Oldham Street. The father was a native of Derbyshire, and gave evidence in 1818 before a committee of the House of Lords on Sir Robert Peel's factory bill. His mother's maiden name was Jane Hale, and she was the daughter of Thomas Hale of Darnhall, Cheshire, author of Social Harmony, who claimed to be of the same family as Sir Matthew Hale. Thomas Bellot became a pupil at the Manchester Grammar School in 1816, after which he became a pupil of Joseph Jordan, a well-known practitioner in his native city. On 16 February 1828 he was admitted a member of the Royal College of Surgeons, and in 1831 entered upon the active service as a naval surgeon, in which he passed the greater part of his life. His first appointment was on the Harrier, where he joined in several boat attacks on the pirates infesting the straits of Malacca. In 1835 he joined the Leveret, and served in the prevention of the African slave trade until 1839. In this expedition he was one of the party that boarded the slave brig Diogenes, and had charge of the wounded prisoners until they were transferred to the hospital at Mozambique. He next served for three years with the Firefly on the West Indian coast. In 1843 he went with the Wolf to the coast of China. During his absence, and without his knowledge, he was elected F.R.C.S. causa honoris 6 August 1844. In 1849 he had medical charge of the Havering, which conveyed 365 convicts to Sydney. Cholera broke out, but his firmness and judgment enabled him to dispense with the exercise of the great powers entrusted to him on this occasion. Some scientific maps and specimens sent by him to the admiralty from Labuan were forwarded to the Museum of Economic Geology. His last outward voyage was in November 1854, when he joined the flagship Britannia, which conveyed Vice-Admiral Dundas to the Black Sea as commander of the fleet. Bellot was assigned the care of the sick at the naval hospital of Therapia on the Bosphorus, as one of the chief hospital surgeons, and returned to England in March 1855 in charge of invalids. This adventurous life was not without influence on his health, and during his stay in the West Indies he had two attacks of yellow fever. He returned to Manchester, and, dying in June 1857, was buried in the churchyard of Poynton, Cheshire. He was honorary member of the Philosophical Society of Sydney, and of several other learned associations. The classical learning received at the Manchester school was increased by further study in the scanty leisure of his busy professional life. He translated the Aphorisms of Hippocrates and of Galen on the Hand (1840). In the latter he was helped by Joseph Jordan. His interest in philology led him to make excursions into the domain of oriental literature. In the intervals on half-pay he visited many cities of Europe, attended the lectures of H. H. Wilson at Oxford, made the acquaintance of Christian Bunsen, and was a friend and disciple of Franz Bopp. Bellot's work on the Sanscrit Derivations of English Words, printed at Manchester in 1856 by subscription, is in effect a comparative dictionary, in which a number of English words are traced to their source. The illustrations range over a wide field of philological knowledge, including Chinese. He had paid considerable attention to the language and antiquities of China, and bequeathed his collection of Chinese books and bronzes to the Manchester Free Library.

The population of the civil parish at the 2011 census was 479. The main settlement is Roxby. Smaller settlements include Dragonby (), High Risby () and Low Risby (). Dragonby was a settlement of the Corieltauvi in the late Pre-Roman Iron Age.Martin Millett, 1992, The Romanization of Britain, p. 24.  History  The separate hamlets of Roxby and Risby were in existence and are both mentioned in the Domesday Book. Roxby was under ownership of Gilbert de Gant whilst Risby was under the ownership of the Abbot of Peterborough. Risby was later annexed by Roxby for the purposes of forming a parish. During the reign of King Henry VIII of England, Risby was taken by the Crown from the Abbot as part of the Dissolution of the Monasteries and it was given to Sir William Herbert during the reign of King Edward VI of England.  Historic buildings  In 1799, the mosaic floor of a Roman villa was discovered in the parish. Further excavations started to cause gradual damage before it was mapped in 1972. Further excavation in 1989 revealed a farmhouse attached to the villa. St Mary's Church in Roxby was constructed in the 12th century and underwent Victorian restoration in 1875. To expand the number of gravesites available, one of the churchwardens in the 1830s ordered several headstones to be laid flat. The headstones were subsequently damaged by children trampling over them. It was granted grade I listed building status in 1967 by English Heritage. Risby also had a church dedicated to St Bartholomew which preceded Roxby's church but this church was closed by the Church of England in 1911.

He was the father of television presenter and motoring journalist Quentin Willson. Life Willson graduated from Trinity College, Cambridge with a degree in modern languages, having studied under J. R. M. Butler. On entering the Second World War in June 1940, the Italian military were using book codes for most of their military messages. The exception was the Italian Navy which, early in 1941, started using the C-38 version of the Hagelin rotor-based cipher machine, which they used to route their navy and merchant marine convoys to the conflict in North Africa. Transcript of a lecture given on Tuesday 19 October 2015 at Cambridge University Willson was recruited in 1941 by J. R. M. Butler to join a team with two others in Hut 4 at Bletchley Park, the Italian subsection of the GC&CS.; Dedicated to cracking the Italian Navy Hagelin code, the team were working in partnership with the Cairo-based team of the Eighth Army Intelligence Chief Brigadier Edgar Williams, who reported to General Bernard Montgomery. In June 1941 Willson became the first of the team to decode the Hagelin system, thus enabling military commanders to direct the Royal Navy and Royal Air Force to sink Axis ships carrying supplies from Europe to Libya. With shipping losses increasing, from reading the resultant Ultra traffic the team learn that between May and September 1941 the stock of fuel for the Luftwaffe in North Africa fell by 90 per cent. The cracking of Hagelin is considered to have been \\"hugely significant\\", so much that Prime Minister Winston Churchill visited Hut 4 on a visit to Bletchley Park to thank the team for their endeavours. After an intensive language course, in March 1944 Willson switched to Japanese language-based codes. Exactly what Willson did and most importantly how he did it remains confidential. After the war, Hagelin founded Crypto AG, which made new versions of his coding machine based on the same logic of encryption. In 1957 the National Security Agency engaged William Friedman to negotiate a deal with Hagelin to give the United States and its ally the United Kingdom access to the coding system. This was later extended to the new electronic based versions of the Hagelin system, which gave the two countries a backdoor into all Hagelin machines distributed to allies and enemies, including: the Vatican; the Iranian Islamic regime; Saddam Hussein; Muammar Gaddafi; Ferdinand Marcos; Idi Amin. Access continued until at least 1983, when US Naval Intelligence officer Jonathan Pollard, sold the information to Mossad (the Israeli Intelligence Service), who traded it to the Soviet Union in return for more exit visas being given to Soviet Jews to emigrate to Israel. The KGB (the Soviet Intelligence Service) probably already knew of the backdoor, via their US-based spies, Aldrich Ames and Robert Hanssen. In 1946 Willson returned to civilian life as an academic, rising to become Dean of the Faculty of Arts at Leicester University. Like many of those who served at Bletchley Park, he was never awarded a medal and never discussed his work. Posthumous celebration Willson's work at Bletchley Park was featured in the 2011 Channel 5 documentary Hero in my Family in 2011, in which his son Quentin Willson commented: FootnotesReferences * J.

Life Beltz was the second of seven children of George Nicholas Beltz of St George's, Bloomsbury, a coal merchant, and Elizabeth Gutteridge (died 1796). From at least 1797 to 1816 he worked in the office of the Garter King of Arms. He became gentleman usher of the scarlet rod of the Order of the Bath and Brunswick Herald in 1814, in succession to Sir Isaac Heard. In 1813, he was secretary to the mission sent to invest Alexander I of Russia with the Order of the Garter, and in 1814 he performed a similar office at the investiture of Francis I of Austria. After being Portcullis Pursuivant from 1817 to 1822, he was appointed Lancaster Herald. In 1826, he was made a companion of the Royal Hanoverian Guelphic Order, of which order he was honoured with knighthood in 1836. Beltz, who was an executor for the widow of David Garrick, wrote a memoir of Mrs. Garrick in the Gentleman's Magazine for November 1822, and he contributed papers on archaeological subjects to the Gentleman's Magazine (1822), to the Retrospective Review (1823), and the volumes, xxv., xxvii., and xxviii. of the Arch√¶ologia of the Society of Antiquaries (1833‚Äì39).

He was the son of Vice-Admiral John Benbow. On 29 June 1696, he was appointed a volunteer on board . He did not, however, remain long in the navy, and in February 1700-1 sailed for the East Indies as fourth mate of the Degrave, a merchant ship. As his father was at this time commander-in-chief in the Downs, and was a few months later appointed commander-in-chief in the West Indies, and thus had it in his power to advance him in the navy, it is difficult to avoid the conclusion that there was some breach between the two. The Degrave, a ship of 700 tons, duly arrived in Bengal, where the captain and first mate died and thus, in ordinary course, Benbow was second mate when she started for her homeward voyage. In going out of the river the ship grounded heavily, and though she was got off without difficulty, and, as it was believed, without damage, she was scarcely well to sea, with a fresh northerly monsoon, before she was found to be leaking badly. With the pumps going constantly they reached Mauritius in a couple of months, but with a singular rashness started again for the Cape without having even discovered the leak. The ship, coming into a more stormy sea, was in imminent danger of sinking, and the captain, officers, and ship's company determined to make for the nearest land, which was the south end of Madagascar. There they ran the ship ashore ; she became a complete wreck, little or nothing was saved, and the men got to land with considerable difficulty. They were almost immediately made prisoners by the natives. Benbow, together with two or three of his companions, managed to escape ; he reached Fort Dauphin, and was eventually rescued by a Dutch ship and brought home. The rest of the ship's company were killed, with the exception of one boy, Robert Drury, then fifteen years old, who, after fifteen years' captivity, was rescued by an English ship, and spent the rest of his life as porter in a London warehouse. We may suppose that Benbow's constitution was broken by the hardships of his savage life ; he seems to have lived for a few years at Deptford, in very humble circumstances, and died on 17 November 1708. Before he died he spoke in support of a plan by John Breholt to obtain a pardon for the Madagascar pirates so they might return to England with their riches; a year after Benbow died, the plan was discredited when it came to light that Breholt was himself a former pirate. He had written some account of Madagascar which remained in manuscript, and was accidentally burnt in 1714. It had, however, been seen by several, and the hazy recollections of it, together with Drury's story, were worked up, not improbably by Daniel Defoe, and published under Drury's name with the title of 'Madagascar, or Robert Drury's Journal during Fifteen Years' Captivity on that Island' (1729).

A translation was produced by Paul Vincent in 2010. Origin At the end of 1944, Boon started a series of chronicles in the Belgium weekly Sunday Post. In 1946 he collected the 33 short stories and added non-related fragments from his notebooks to each story, which appeared as a book in 1947. In 1960, Boon revised the work for a second edition that more closely reflects Dutch standards for correct language. See chapter two of Vanheste (1989, link below) for a scholarly study of the textual history. Content My Little War contains some thirty short stories, each of two pages on average, dealing with the troubles of the 'man in the street' during World War II and the German Occupation of the Netherlands. Most characters appear in only one story, hence the only character that can be considered somewhat of the main character is the narrator himself, Louis. He is the protagonist in the first chronicles and the witness in others, while still others have only reached him by hearsay. in addition to the publication history, the content have led readers and scholars alike to consider the book rather as a collection of stories than a novel. In fact, the book is much more of a unity than it is credited for. For instance, the narrator insists that the reader could just as easily be the writer, and this equation of \\"me\\" and \\"you\\" is consistently held up throughout all parts of the book. Hence an argument can be made to qualify it as a highly originally shaped novel. Reception Upon publication, and for some decades after that, My Little War was often overlooked and sold poorly. But as readers and scholars began to study Boon's other works and understood the nature of his art better and better, the book acquired the reputation of being the inauguration of Boon's major phase. In recent decades it has attracted a huge body of commentary, as an online search for the original title in Dutch will quickly reveal.

It covers alien races and other fictional creatures, but not specific characters. Individual characters are listed in separate articles. Note that some information on the page is taken from spin-off media. H=Haemovore= Haemovores appeared in the Seventh Doctor story The Curse of Fenric (1989) by Ian Briggs. Vampiric creatures that fed on blood, they were the end result of human evolution in a possible far future, caused by millennia of pollution. As part of his final game against the Doctor, the entity known as Fenric transported the most powerful Haemovore, called the \\"Ancient One\\", through time to Viking Age Northumbria. There it waited, trapped beneath the North Sea for centuries, occasionally drawing victims into the water and transforming them into Haemovores. Soon after the transformation, victims appeared much as they did in life, except for elongated fingernails and a corpse-like pallor. Later they became deformed blue-grey humanoids covered in octopus-like suckers. The Ancient One was the least human in appearance; in its own time, it was the last living thing on Earth. During World War II, Fenric released the Ancient One. Fenric's plan was that the Ancient One was to release the toxin which would pollute the world and thus create its own future. The Haemovores had the ability to hypnotically paralyse their victims so they could feed and drain them of blood. Not all of their victims were turned into Haemovores, although the selection process was never explained. The Haemovores were impervious to most forms of attack, surviving being shot at close range by a submachine gun at one point. They could be destroyed in the traditional vampire-killing fashion of driving a stake through their chests. They could also be repelled by their victim's faith, which formed a psychic barrier, like the Doctor's faith in his companions, Ace's faith in the Doctor, Captain Sorin's faith in the Communist Revolution, and even the Reverend Wainwright's failing faith in God; this repelling force can be called into will, the Doctor merely called the names of past companions as a medium. Ultimately, the Seventh Doctor convinced the Ancient One to turn against Fenric, and it released the toxin within a sealed chamber, destroying itself and Fenric's host. Whether this means that the future the Ancient One came from was averted is not clear, although the Doctor seemed to think so. Fenric and his Haemovores return in the 2012 Big Finish Productions audio story, Gods and Monsters. =Hath= The Hath are aliens that appear as tall, roughly humanoid creatures with fish-like heads, who can breathe in air via the employment of apparatus fitted to their faces that incorporates a canister of green liquid. They are intelligent, emotional creatures ‚Äì one formed a friendship with Martha Jones, and saved her life at the cost of its own. They seem sentient and while they do not speak a language intelligible to humans, the two races planned to colonize the planet Messaline together. However, they later turned on each other ‚Äì before their eventual reconciliation, thanks to the Doctor's intervention. The Monster Files feature states that the Hath joined and assisted early human space colonisation. The Hath returned for an appearance in the second part of \\"The End of Time\\" (2010), where they are seen in an alien bar, and they are seen briefly in \\"The Eleventh Hour\\" (2011) in a clip illustrating the Doctor's role as protector of the Earth, suggesting that they have visited the planet at some point prior to 2010. They also appeared in an alien bar for the first episode of season 9. =Headless Monks= The Headless Monks are a religious order that can be converted from any humanoid species by the removal of the head. They wear hooded cloaks, giving the impression that they still have a head, however under the hood, the skin is tied into a tight knot where the head has been removed. Despite their name, most people are unaware of this literal description being true, because except under very special circumstances, one incurs a death penalty if they ever remove the hood of a monk. The monks have no detectable life signs, and are endowed with the ability to throw lightning from their hands. They were first mentioned in \\"The Time of Angels\\" (2010), but did not appear until \\"A Good Man Goes To War\\" (2011). =Hoix= A Hoix features in the Torchwood episode \\"Exit Wounds\\" (2008); the first time its name has been mentioned on screen, having previously been seen in the Doctor Who episode \\"Love & Monsters\\" two years before. Owen distracts it by feeding it cigarettes stating that it \\"lives to eat\\". They are not very intelligent, being easily tricked by Owen into being vulnerable for a knock-out blow to the head; it has been seen animalisticly chasing Rose and the Tenth Doctor in its first appearance. One appeared as a member of the Alliance to seal the Eleventh Doctor in the Pandorica in \\"The Pandorica Opens\\" (2010). A Hoix was also mentioned in the novel The Twilight Streets. I=Ice Warrior=J=Judoon= alt= The Judoon are galactic alien police resembling rhinoceroses that work for the Shadow Proclamation. They appeared in the series 3 Sarah Jane Adventures story, Prisoner of the Judoon, in pursuit of a Veil life form known as Androvax that escaped from a crashed Judoon prison transport. They have relatively low intelligence levels but possess sophisticated technology such as H2O Scoops that are capable of lifting large buildings and Thermal Guns that are able to disintegrate targets. The Judoon first appeared as a major alien in the Doctor Who episode \\"Smith and Jones\\" as well as the episodes \\"The Pandorica Opens\\". K=Kahler= A highly technologically advanced humanoid species with unique patterns on the left side of their faces to reflect their individuality. A Kahler doctor, Kahler-Jex, encountered the Eleventh Doctor, Amy Pond and Rory Williams in a small American frontier town known as Mercy, where it became apparent that he was responsible for the creation of a deadly Kahler cyborg, who was now hunting him down to execute Kahler-Jex for his crimes against the Kahler species. =Kaled= A species of humanoids from the planet Skaro who evolved into the fearsome and warlike Daleks. =Kinda= Kinda (pronounced \\"Kin-duh\\") are a species of human-like people. At first glance, one would assume they are similar to the caveman age humans. However, their necklaces seem similar to a double helix, implying they are smarter than they appear. They have legends of the Mara, and are warned not to dream alone to keep it away. The men of the Kinda are not allowed to speak, but if one does, a prophecy says all Kinda will. They have women similar to shamans, they speak almost fluently; when the elder dies, her spirit and knowledge enter her apprentice. A child in the Kinda tribe could have up to seven fathers, though this hasn't been elaborated on; although it could be one biological father and six stepfathers. =Kraal= The Kraals reappear in a Big Finish story called 'The Oseidon Adventure', which was released in June 2012 as part of the Fourth Doctor Adventures. =Krafayis= The Krafayis appear in the episode \\"Vincent and the Doctor\\" (2010). It appears to be invisible to most people, however Vincent Van Gogh can see it. It is suggested that this is because of his mental illness. =Krargs= Krargs appear in the unfinished serial Shada and consequently in its later Big Finish/BBCi remake. They are artificial crystalline organisms with rudimentary mobility and understanding of simple commands, created and controlled by the main antagonist, Skagra, to aid in his plan to forcefully merge all of the minds in the Universe into a single omnipotent entity. =Krillitane= The Krillitanes are a race who take attributes from other races to change their appearance. In the episode \\"School Reunion\\" (2006), the Tenth Doctor states that he has encountered them before, but that due to their composite nature, they looked different, hence him not recognizing them. In order to solve the Skasis Paradigm, which would enable them to control the entire universe, they assume control of a school and take over, with many assuming human forms and taking roles such as teachers and catering staff ‚Äì the Krillitane leader Brother Lassar takes on the role of the headteacher, using the alias \\"Mr Finch\\". The pupils are served free lunches which contain chips coated with Krillitane oil, which is toxic to the Krillitanes themselves, but is harmless to humans, and when consumed, causes increased intelligence ‚Äì when the Doctor asks Rose (who had also eaten the chips) what is 59 times 35, she immediately answers the question correctly (2,065). But the oil is also extremely flammable, and when K9 ignites it, the ensuing explosion destroys the school and the Krillitanes inside. =KrotonKrynoid= The Krynoids appeared in the Fourth Doctor story The Seeds of Doom by Robert Banks Stewart. They are a highly dangerous, sentient form of plant life which are renowned amongst galactic botanists. They spread via seed pods which travel in pairs and are violently hurled through space by frequent volcanic eruptions on their unnamed home planet. The pods when opened are attracted to flesh and are able to infect and mingle their DNA with that of the host, taking over their body and slowly transforming them into a Krynoid. The species can also exert a form of telepathic control over other plant life in the surrounding area, making it suddenly dangerous and deadly to animal- kind. In the later stages of development the Krynoid can also control the vocal cords of its victims and can make itself telepathically sympathetic to humans. Fully grown Krynoids are many meters high and can then release hordes of seed pairs for further colonisation. Two pods arrived on Earth at the South Pole during the prehistoric Pleistocene era and remained dormant in Antarctica until discovered at the end of the twentieth century. One of them hatched after being exposed to ultra-violet light, and took control of a nearby human scientist. The Fourth Doctor intervened in the nick of time and ensured the Krynoid was destroyed by a bomb, but the second pod was stolen and taken to the home of millionaire botanist Harrison Chase in England. Chase ensured the germination of the second pod, which overtook his scientific adviser Arnold Keeler, and transformed its subject over time into a virtually full-sized Krynoid. Unable to destroy the creature by other means, and with the danger of a seed release imminent from the massive plant, the Doctor orchestrated an RAF bombing raid to destroy the creature before it could germinate. The Krynoid are also featured in the Eighth Doctor audio story for Big Finish entitled Hothouse, where an environmentalist group uses samples from the original Krynoid to try and create hybrids that can be controlled by the human host and thus control Earth's fauna to cope with the environmental damage, only for their efforts to merely create a rapidly-growing Krynoid before the Doctor sets it on fire. Also featured in BBV audios The Root of All Evil, and The Green Man. A Krynoid appears as one of the villains in the Eleventh Doctor short story collection Tales of Trenzalore, as one of the creatures attacking Trenzalore during the Doctor's defence of the planet (\\"The Time of the Doctor\\", 2013), the Doctor defeating the Krynoid by blasting it with rapidly- freezing water from a specially modified hose and then shattering it with the reverberations of the town bell. M=Macra= The Macra first appear in the 1967 Second Doctor story The Macra Terror by Ian Stuart Black. They are an intelligent, giant crab-like species from an unnamed planet colonised by humanity in the future. The Macra invade the control center of the colony and seize the levers of power without the colonists ‚Äì including their Pilot ‚Äì knowing what had happened. Thereafter the Macra only appear at night, when the humans are in their quarters, observing a curfew. They have strong hypnotic powers which alter human perception. They also have the ability to ensure messages are vocalised through electronic apparatus such as television or sensor speakers. Both these tools are used to keep the human colonists under control, believing they are blissfully happy. This provides a cover for the Macra to use the colonists as miners in a vast gas mine. The gas is deadly to the miners but vital to the Macra, enabling them to move more quickly and rejuvenating their abilities. The Second Doctor effects a revolution on the Macra planet and helps engineer an explosion in the control centre, destroying the Macra in charge. The Macra are also featured in the 2007 episode \\"Gridlock\\", becoming the first one-off opponent of the Doctor in the classic series to appear in the revived series, with the Zygons reappearing in the Eleventh Doctor story, \\"The Day of the Doctor\\" (2013). In the episode, some Macra are found to be alive below New New York, a city of New Earth. They live in the thick fog of exhaust gases on the main motorway under the city, tracking the flying cars by their lights and snatching at them when they get too close. The Doctor says that the species is billions of years old and once developed a small empire as \\"the scourge of this galaxy\\", but the Macra beneath New New York must have devolved into nothing more than beasts. =MaraMartian= In the Doctor Who universe, the planet Mars is home to two known forms of sentient life: the Ice Warriors, a race of reptilian humanoids, and The Flood, a sentient, water-borne virus encountered by the first human base on Mars in the episode \\"The Waters of Mars\\" (2009). The Tenth Doctor was incorrectly identified as a Martian by Donna Noble during their meeting in, \\"The Runaway Bride\\" (2006), with the Empress of the Racnoss. = Mechonoid = Large, spherical robots created by humans to prepare the planet Mechanus for colonisation. They kept stranded astronaut Steven Taylor prisoner as he did not have their control codes. Daleks, pursuing the TARDIS crew, engaged the Mechonoids in battle. Which side was victorious is not shown. Spelt 'Mechanoid' in various subsequent comic strip appearances. =Menoptra= The Menoptra (spelled Menoptera in the novelisation of the serial) appeared in the First Doctor story The Web Planet, by Bill Strutton (1965). They are an intelligent, bipedal insectoid species from the planet Vortis. In appearance, they resemble a cross between giant butterflies and bees, with each Menoptra possessing four large wings. They have yellow and black stripes around their bodies and appear to be around six feet tall, but do not seem to have typical insect body parts (such as mandibles or an abdomen). Peaceful and kindly by nature, the Menoptra move in a unique, stylised way and their vocal inflections are stilted. They were very welcoming of the First Doctor, Ian, Barbara, and Vicki; but showed an animosity towards their fellow insectoids, the Zarbi, as well as an abhorrence for the Animus, a hostile alien intelligence that had taken over the originally passive Zarbi and almost all of Vortis. Once it was clear that the Doctor was willing to help them defeat the Animus, they were only too glad to assist in any way they could. Menoptra born without wings are considered second-class citizens. A Menoptra and a Zarbi were shown on cover of the first edition of Doctor Who Annual in September 1965 along with two other Doctor Who alien races, a Voord and a Sensorite. =Minotaur= An alien Minotaur was imprisoned in a prison that resembled that of an Earth hotel in \\"The God Complex\\" (2011), however this \\"hotel\\" had never-ending corridors, and so established itself as a God, feeding from the fears of the beings that find them trapped in the hotel. The Eleventh Doctor realised that actually, the Minotaur is feeding on the people's faith that something or someone will save them from their worst fears, and so temporarily encourages his companion Amy Pond to lose her faith in him, which eventually allows the Minotaur to die peacefully in the corridors of the hotel. The Doctor mentions that this alien species of Minotaur are cousins of the Nimon. =Monk= The Monks are an alien race of shapeshifting humanoids that can choose their appearance at will; on Earth, they chose to resemble human corpses. The Monks study other planets through virtual simulations and take over by having someone in power consent to their rule out of love. In \\"Extremis\\" (2017), the simulated version of the Twelfth Doctor eventually realized the truth and emailed a recording of the Monks' simulation to the real Twelfth Doctor through his sonic sunglasses, warning him of the coming invasion. In \\"The Pyramid at the End of the World\\" (2017), the Monks showed the assembled world leaders a future where the Earth would be destroyed in one year by bacteria and offered to protect them as their rulers. The Doctor planned to stop the bacteria by blowing up the laboratory where it was found, but realized he could not escape the explosion due to his blindness. Unwilling to let her friend die, Bill Potts consented to the Monks' rule in return for the Doctor's eyesight, allowing him to escape. In \\"The Lie of the Land\\" (2017), the Monks ruled over Earth for six months and kept the humans control by broadcasting a revised version of the planet's history that included the Monks from the beginning. Bill, the lynchpin through whom the fake history was broadcast, broke her psychic link with the Monks by broadcasting pure memories of her mother, causing the Monks to lose control over humanity and ultimately retreat from Earth. =Movellan= The Movellans, who made their first appearance in the Fourth Doctor serial Destiny of the Daleks (1979), are an android species originating from outside the galaxy. They were adversaries of the Daleks. Movellans outwardly resemble physically attractive humans of various ethnicities and both genders. All Movellan androids wear white, form-fitting uniforms and have silver hair braided in a dreadlock style. They are stronger and have more physical endurance than human beings. A major weakness of the Movellan design is an external power pack which each android carries on its belt. This can be removed with comparative ease, causing the android to completely shut down. Once removed the power pack circuitry can be reprogrammed so that the android will obey the orders of another being. The Movellans are mentioned again in Resurrection of the Daleks (1984), where a virus of their invention was central to that story's plot. They also appear in \\"The Pilot\\" (2017), where they are seen fighting the Daleks. =Mentors= Mentors are amphibious capitalists who first appear in the serial \\"Vengeance On Varos\\". N=Nestene= The Nestenes are a race of amorphous aliens who can control all forms of plastic, creating Autons. Since the Last Great Time War destroyed their food supply planets, the Nestenes have been seeking replacements. =Nimon= Black Minotaur-like beings with red eyes that go to other planets, posing as Gods. However, they are nothing more than a parasitic race that bleed planets dry before moving on to new ones in a repeating cycle. They are cousins to the Minotaur species that the Eleventh Doctor encountered in \\"The God Complex\\" (2011). While one posed as a God, it acquired sacrifices to be used as batteries for powering their teleporter. However, the Doctor's arrival prevented more than two extra Nimons from arriving; the rest tried a last-resort plan by blowing up their now resource-deprived planet, killing them all. O=Ogron= Ogrons are mercenaries employed by various parties to \\"do their dirty work\\" throughout the universe. They strongly resemble Orcs or Uruk-hai from The Lord of the Rings, being large humanoids with thick gray skin, protruding brow ridges, and thick, tangled hair. They primarily employ stun weapons, and have been employed by both the Daleks and the Master on at least one occasion. They first appeared in the Third Doctor serial Day of the Daleks (1972). =OodOgri= The Ogri appeared in the Fourth Doctor story The Stones of Blood (1978) by David Fisher. The Ogri were a species of silicon-based creatures native to Ogros. They looked like large rocks, usually taller than a human but irregular in shape. They were large, slow and heavy, sometimes weighing as much as 3.5 tons, but they could take a lot of damage, both energy-based and physical. When they were awake, they would glow and make a loud rumbling noise. Like other silicon-based lifeforms, they broke down into grit when killed and also left silicon behind when they moved. They fed on various types of proteins which were common on Ogros. When on Earth, the Ogri had to rely on the globulin in blood, which they could absorb by touch. Ogri were not shown to communicate and did not show any signs of intelligence. Ogri had long lifespans, living for thousands of years. Cessair of Diplos took three Ogri from Ogros, which she used for protection and to impress the humans of Earth. These Ogri waited with the Nine Travellers until they were awoken by Cessair or her followers. Augmented Ogri were used by the Galactic Federation as doormen. At least one Ogri was discovered on Earth prior to 1983, and ended up in the care of Isaac Summerfield in Little Caldwell. It resided in the cemetery and was routinely fed blood to keep it docile. It was instrumental in saving Little Caldwell from the attention of NATO, by killing a rogue NATO commander responsible for a number of abductions (both alien and human). =Optera= The Optera appeared in the First Doctor story The Web Planet (1965) by Bill Strutton. These caterpillar-like creatures were once Menoptra, but they elected to instead burrow under the ground and abandon the world of light and flight above. It is implied that they may have been driven there by the malevolent Animus. They have larger eyes than their Menoptra brethren, and have no wings. However, they have numerous arms and appear to \\"hop\\" in a stylised way. They speak with inflection different from that of their bee-like cousins, but their speech is a strange dialect of the language of the \\"upper world\\" and words and phrases they have coined for themselves. At the story's end, the Animus is defeated and the Optera are persuaded to return to the surface, where they look forward to their children learning the joys of flight; implying that once back on the surface the Optera will redevelop wings. P=Peladonian= Peladonians appear humanoid, but are still in an age of a lack of advanced technology; at least when the Third Doctor visits the first time, when Peladon is being considered admittance into a galactic alliance. In the Doctor's first adventure, Peladon was ruled by a half human king named after the planet; his second trip saw him meeting King Peladon's daughter, a 1/4 human queen. =Pied Piper= Based on the mythical piper in the fairytale, the Pied Piper was an energy entity from the Jeggorabax Cluster, home to beings that feed on emotions. The species' spacecraft resembled meteorites; one such ship crash landed on Earth in the Weserbergland Mountains, Lower Saxony in 1283. Feeding off the emotion of fear, it assumed the human disguise of The Pied Piper and stole away all the children of the town of Hamelin, creating fear from parents. The First Doctor, John and Gillian first meet the Pied Piper in the comic Challenge of the Piper. This is also the first story to ever feature the Pied Piper in Doctor Who. Over the centuries, the creature continued to abduct children and terrify their parents, using many guises including Odd Bob the Clown, who kidnapped children in wartime New York. In the 2009 story The Day of the Clown, posing as both the ringmaster Elijah Spellman and as Odd Bob, the entity established a museum in Ealing named Spellman's Magical Museum of the Circus, made possible by the presence of the Weserbergland Meteorite at the Pharos Institute. Because of Sarah Jane Smith's affiliation with Pharos, she broke some of the meteorite and used it to trap the alien in it, after having weakened it by laughing at its clown form instead of fearing it. The meteorite was then sealed in a special emotion-proof container made out of Halconite steel in Sarah Jane's attic. =Plasmavore= Plasmavores are shape-changing aliens that live on haemoglobin. They absorb blood from their victims, which in turn changes their own blood chemistry to that of the victim, allowing them to mimic other species when medically scanned. A Plasmavore was hiding from the Judoon in the Royal Hope Hospital on Earth, disguised as Florence Finnegan. =P'ting= The P'ting have toxic skin, and will eat anything that is not organic and energy like it ate the Thirteenth Doctor's energy from her sonic screwdriver. =Pyrovile=See also * List of Doctor Who villains * List of Doctor Who henchmen * List of Doctor Who robots ReferencesExternal links * The Bumper Book of Doctor Who Monsters, Villains & Alien Species * Children of the Earth BBC Torchwood site * Monsters and aliens Doctor Who Doctor Who monsters Doctor Who lists Monsters and aliens * ","title":"List of Doctor Who universe creatures and aliens (H‚ÄìP)"},{"id":"38604711","text":"There have been five Minor leagues teams that have represented the city of Chanute, Kansas. Since classification of the minors began, all of them have been labeled as class D loops. Chanute Oilers The Chanute Oilers became a member of the Missouri Valley League in 1902. The team started playing as the Coffeyville Indians before being renamed during the midseason. The Coffeyville/Chanute team posted a combined record of 41-81 and finished sixth in the eight-team league, 44 games behind the first place team. Chanute Browns In 1906, the team was named the Chanute Browns and was part of the Kansas State League. The squad lasted only that season, ending sixth with a 51-64 record in the eight-team league 36 games out of first place. Chanute Owls/Athletics/Giants After a 39-year absence, a later version of the team became a founding member of the Kansas‚ÄìOklahoma‚ÄìMissouri League in 1946. They continued to operate in the league until 1950. The team played as the Chanute Owls in 1946, tying for first place and winning the first round of the postseason. Then, Chanute and Iola tied 3-3 in final playoff games that counted. Although Chanute won another contest, it was later ruled a non-game after a dispute arose between both club officials. Finally, the series never was settled.Hall, John G. (2004). The KOM League Remembered. Arcadia Publishing. The Owls changed its name to the Chanute Owls Athletics, and played under this name between the 1946‚Äì1947 and 1949‚Äì1950 seasons. In 1948, they played as the Chanute Giants and were a New York Giants affiliated team. But Chanute declined through its last five seasons in the eight-team circuit, finishing 7th in 1947 (44-80), 8th in 1948 (44-78), 5th in 1949 (65-60) and 8th in 1950 (35-89).

According to Gerald of Wales, Bendings was sent to Ireland by Henry II in 1176 as one of four envoys, of whom two were to remain with the viceroy, Richard FitzGilbert, Earl of Striguil, and two were to return, bringing with them Reimund Fitzgerald, whose exploits had aroused the king's jealousy. Reimund did not at once comply with the royal mandate, being compelled by the threatening attitude of Donnell to march to the relief of Limerick, a town which he had only recently taken. Richard also died that year, and the four envoys appear to have returned to England without Reimund. In 1178 Bendings was a royal justice in Yorkshire. In 1179, on the resignation of the chief justice, Richard de Lucy, a redistribution of the circuits was carried into effect. In place of the six circuits then existing the country was divided into four, to each of which, except the northern circuit, five judges were assigned, three or four of the number being laymen. To the northern circuit six judges were assigned, of whom Bendings was one, having for one of his colleagues the celebrated Ranulf Glanvill, who was made chief justice the following year. Bendings is named as a royal justice in a November 1179 fine made at Westminster. In 1183-4 we find him acting as sheriff of Dorset and Somerset, the two counties being united under his single jurisdiction. There seems to be no reason to suppose, with Edward Foss,Foss, Biographia Juridica that the expression, 'sex justiti√¶ in curia regis constituti ad audiendum clamores populi', applied to the six judges of the northern circuit, imports any jurisdiction peculiar to them. Bendings was survived by his wife, Gunnora, and a son, Adam. The date of his death is uncertain: he was living in 1189-90, since he is entered in the 1189-90 pipe roll as rendering certain accounts to the exchequer. However, he seems to have died by 1196/7, when his son Adam started accounting for debts his father had incurred as sheriff of Dorset and Somerset.

Developed and initially released in 2007, the Energy Logic efficiency model suggests ten holistic actions ‚Äì encompassing IT equipment as well as traditional data center infrastructure ‚Äì guided by the principles dictated by the \\"Cascade Effect.\\" Energy Logic Assumptions The first iteration of the Energy Logic model was introduced by Emerson Network Power on November 29, 2007.‚ÄúEmerson Network Power Introduces New Approach to Data Center Energy Optimization,‚Äù Press Release from Corporate Web Site Described as a ‚Äúnew approach to energy optimization,‚Äù the model was developed in response to industry feedback suggesting a growing emphasis on promoting efficiency initiatives, without compromising the performance and reliability of the data center.\\"Emerson Delivers Free Energy Logic Blueprint for Building a Power Efficient Data Center‚Äù, \\"InfoWorld\\" The Energy Logic data center efficiency model was developed based on research and modeling of a 5,000 square foot data center, including average IT equipment densities, common data center and facility infrastructures (power, cooling, etc.) and their collective energy draw. Energy draw for the 5,000 square foot data center model was based on the following assumptions:‚ÄúEnergy Logic: Reducing Data Center Energy Consumption by Creating Savings that Cascade Across Systems,‚Äù White Paper * Server refresh rate: 4 to 5 years ** Data center has mix of servers ranging from new to 4-years old * No virtualization or blades * No high-density loads ** Average density: 3 kW/rack (120 W/sq. ft.) * Total compute load: about 600 kW * UPS configuration: 2x750 kVA, 1+1 redundant * Hot-aisle/cold-aisle configuration * Floor-mount cooling connected to building chilled water plant * MV transformer (5 MVA) at building entrance with switchgear The Cascade Effect Based on the benchmarks established by the 5,000 sq. ft. model, Emerson Network Power recommended improvements to IT and data center infrastructures capable of maximizing total energy savings by leveraging the ‚Äúcascade effect.‚Äù For the purposes of the Energy Logic model, the cascade effect assumes that for every one watt of energy saved at the server component level, a data center can expect to realize up to 2.84 Watts in cumulative energy savings as the initial reduction ‚Äúcascades‚Äù through the infrastructure (DC-DC, AC/DC, Power Distribution, etc.).‚ÄúEmerson Analysis IDs Cascading Energy Gains,‚Äù Data Center Knowledge  Energy Logic Actions  The Energy Logic model proposes ten vendor-neutral actions that are forecast to reduce cumulative energy consumption by up to 50 percent (reducing energy consumption to 585 kW from the data center's initial 1,127 kW load).‚ÄúEnergy Logic Presentation,‚Äù via the 7x24 Exchange The ten recommended actions prescribed in the Energy Logic model are: # Integrating IT equipment with low- power processors (yields a 10 percent savings) # Deploying high efficiency power supplies matched to power needs (yields a 12 percent savings) # Implementing a server power management system/strategy (yields an 11 percent savings) # Deploying blade servers (yields a 1 percent savings) # Implementing server virtualization throughout the IT infrastructure (yields a 14 percent savings) # Establishing an efficient power distribution architecture (yields a 3 percent savings) # Implementing data center cooling best practices (Optimizing Airflow, Using Optimal Set Points, Reducing Energy Waste, Etc.) (yields a 2 percent savings) # Deploying variable capacity cooing equipment (including chilled-water and direct-expansion systems) (yields a 7 percent savings) # Deploying high-density supplemental cooling (yields an 18 percent savings) # Implementing a data center monitoring and optimization strategy (yields a 2 percent savings) The Energy Logic model also suggests additional opportunities for energy savings, including:  Identifying and disconnecting unused servers * Consolidating data storage * Implementing economizers for subsidized cooling * Monitoring and reducing energy losses tied to facility infrastructure (generators, lighting, perimeter access, etc.) Energy Logic 2.0  In 2012, Emerson Network Power introduced an update to the Energy Logic model, to take into consideration advances in IT and data center infrastructure technology. Using the same 5,000 square foot data center benchmarked in the 2007 model, Energy Logic 2.0 updates the ten prescribed actions to reflect current technologies and average equipment efficiency.

Hijo de M√°scara A√±o 2000's real name is not a matter of public record, as is often the case with masked wrestlers in Mexico where their private lives are kept a secret from the wrestling fans. He is a second-generation wrestler, son of M√°scara A√±o 2000, nephew of Cien Caras and Universo 2000. In 2019 he joined forces with his cousins El Cuatrero, Sans√≥n, Forastero and Universo 2000 Jr. as part of Sangre Dinamita. From 2007 through 2017 Hijo de M√°scara A√±o 2000 was a mainstay in International Wrestling Revolution Group (IWRG) where he won the IWRG Intercontinental Trios Championship with Cien Caras Jr. and M√°scara A√±o 2000 Jr., the IWRG Junior de Juniors Championship and the IWRG Rey del Ring Championship. He is not related to either Cien Caras Jr., M√°scara A√±o 2000 Jr. nor El Hijo de Cien Caras. Professional wrestling career In Lucha Libre it is traditional to keep the true identity of a masked wrestler a secret, not revealing their real names and oftentimes not revealing what previous ring names they have competed under. While Hijo de M√°scara A√±o 2000 is listed as having made his professional wrestling debut in 2007 it has not been confirmed if he previously worked under a masked or unmasked ring identity and then took on the name \\"Hijo de M√°scara A√±o 2000\\". It is not verified if he really is the son of M√°scara A√±o 2000, even though his name literally means \\"Son of M√°scara A√±o 2000\\". Out of all the wrestlers billed as being sons of M√°scara A√±o 2000 or his brother Cien Caras, only one, M√°scara A√±o 2000 Jr., has been confirmed as being a biological relative, while two others Hijo de Cien Caras and Cien Caras, Jr. were confirmed as not being related to the family. One of his early appearances as \\"Hijo de M√°scara A√±o 2000\\" was on July 26, 2007 when he participated in the inaugural Rey del Ring (\\"King of the Ring\\") tournament, eliminated as the 26th overall competitor as Yamato won the 30-man tournament. In the subsequent months he began teaming with M√°scara A√±o 2000, Jr. (his brother) and Hijo de Cien Caras (Not related) to form Los Capos Junior, also referred to as Los Dinamitas Junior after the team Los Capos / Los Hermanos Dinamita (\\"The Bosses / The Dynamite Brothers\\") formed by their \\"fathers\\". In April 2010, the Mexico State wrestling commission stripped the team of Black Terry, Dr. Cerebro and Cerebro Negro of the Distrito Federal Trios Championship as Cerebro Negro had not wrestled in the State of Mexico for 90 days. Hijo de M√°scara A√±o 2000 and M√°scara A√±o 2000, Jr. teamed up with their father for the tournament, qualifying for the finals by defeating first the team of Chico Che, Ultraman, Jr. and Zatura and then Brazo de Plata, Brazo Met√°lico and Hijo del Brazo de Plata to qualify for the finals of the tournament. The following week Los M√°scaras A√±o 2000 lost to the team of Los Gringos VIP (Avisman, El Hijo del Diablo and Gringo Loco) in the finals of the tournament. IWRG created a new championship in early 2011 called the IWRG Junior de Juniors Championship, designed specifically for second-generation wrestlers, either actual or fictional second-generation wrestlers. Hijo de M√°scara A√±o 2000 was one of ten wrestlers who participated in the tournament to determine the first champion. In the first round Hijo de M√°scara A√±o 2000 defeated Bobby Lee, Jr. and in the second round he defeated Ultraman, Jr. only to be defeated by Hijo de L.A. Park in the semi-final match and thus eliminated from the tournament. In September, 2011 IWRG held a trios tournament to determine the next challengers for the IWRG Intercontinental Trios Championship. In the preliminary round Los Capos Junior outlasted the teams of Los Perros del Mal (Bestia 666, Damian 666 and X-Fly) and Los Psycho Circus (Monster Clown, Murder Clown and Psycho Clown) to earn a match for the championship at a later date. He was one of 10 wrestlers to put his mask on the line in the 2011 Castillo del Terror (\\"Tower of Terror\\") match, but escaped the steel cage halfway through the match, keeping his mask safe. On December 1, 2011 Los Capos Junior defeated Los Perros del Mal to win the IWRG Intercontinental Championship. The team would hold the titles for 177 days, until May 27, 2012 where they lost to La Familia de Tijuana (Damian 666, Headhunter A and X-Fly).Los Capos Junior, in this case Hijo de M√°scara A√±o 2000 and Cien Caras, Jr., participated in the 2012 Gran Legado (\\"Great Legacy\\") tournament, but lost to the father/son team of Pirata Morgan and Hijo de Pirata Morgan.A few days later Hijo de M√°scara A√±o 2000 put his mask on the line against Bestia 666, who put the IWRG Junior de Juniors Championship on the line, Hijo de M√°scara A√±o 2000 won the match, kept his mask and became the IWRG Junior de Juniors Champion. Los Capos Junior, primarily Hijo de M√°scara A√±o 2000 and Cien Caras, Jr. since M√°scara A√±o 2000, Jr. had joined the La Consejo group in AAA, participated in the 2012 Guerra de Empresas (\\"Battle of the promotions\\") tournament, representing IWRG. The team qualified for the finals by defeating La Familia de Tijuana (Damian 666 and X-Fly) and El Consejo (Argos and El Texano, Jr.) but lost to Cibern√©tico and La Parka (representing AAA) in the finals. On September 16, 2012 Hijo de Pirata Morgan won the IWRG Junior de Juniors Championship from Hijo de M√°scara A√±o 2000 in a match where Hijo de Pirata Morgan's Rey del Ring Championship was also on the line. On March 31, 2013 Hijo de M√°scara A√±o 2000 and Cien Caras, Jr. competed in IWRG's La Guerra de Familias (\\"War of the Families\\") tournament. The team defeated Heavy Metal and Danny Casas in the first round and then Trauma II in the finals when Trauma I was unable to compete to win the tournament. A week later Los Junior Dinamitas wrestled Trauma I and Negro Navarro for the IWRG Intercontinental Tag Team Championship, but lost. On May 4, 2014, Hijo de M√°scara A√±o 2000 won the 2014 Rey del Ring tournament and the Rey del Ring Championship. On October 5, 2014, The IWRG Intercontinental Heavyweight Champion El Hijo de Dos Caras defeated Hijo de Mascara A√±o 2000 on a Title Vs.

Printed in 1524 in the Erfurt Enchiridion, together with 18 hymns by Martin Luther, it is one of the oldest Lutheran hymns. The text combines Lutheran teaching with medieval mysticism. It has been the basis of musical settings such as Bach's chorale cantata .  History  Apart that Elisabeth Cruciger's authorship has been ascertained, little or nothing is known about the genesis of \\"Herr Christ, der einig Gotts Sohn\\". The notion that it was modelled after the Christmas hymn \\"Corde natus ex parentis\\" (\\"Of the Father's Heart Begotten\\"), repeated, for instance, in Bach-scholarship, lost traction in hymnology. The melody of Cruciger's hymn has some similarity with the tune of \\"Mein Freud m√∂cht sich wohl mehren\\" (\\"My Joy Will Increase\\"), a secular love song known from the Lochamer-Liederbuch (1455). \\"Herr Christ, der einig Gotts Sohn\\" was first published in 1524, both in the Erfurt Enchiridion and in Johann Walter's choral hymnal in Wittenberg. In the Enchiridion, the hymn appeared with 25 others, 18 by Martin Luther, three by Paul Speratus, one or two by Justus Jonas, one by Erhard Hegenwald, and one attributed to Jan Hus, making this the only hymn in the Enchiridion by a female author. Titled \\"\\" (A song of praise of Christ) in the hymnal Enchiridion, the song is a praise of Jesus as the son of God and saviour of man. The hymn text combines Lutheran teaching with medieval mysticism which the author experienced as a nun before she converted. Cruciger writes in the third stanza, for example: \\"so, da√ü wir hier m√∂gen schmecken dein S√º√üigkeit im Herzen und d√ºrsten stets nach dir\\" (that we may here taste your sweetness in our hearts and constantly thirst for you). It was the first Protestant chorale to use mystical images, imitated in the Jesus mysticism of later generations. Philipp Nicolai referenced the hymn in his own hymn \\"\\"; both authors use the title \\"\\" (morning star) for Jesus. \\"Herr Christ, der einig Gotts Sohn\\" has been associated with Epiphany, the first and second Sundays after Epiphany, Annunciation, the 18th Sunday after Trinity, Advent, and Christmas. The hymn has been included in over 30 hymnals. It appears as No. 67 in . The hymn tune of \\"Herr Christ, der einig Gotts Sohn\\" (Zahn No. 4297a) was later also used for \\"Herr Gott, nun sei gepreiset\\", the content of which has no relation to that of Cruciger's hymn. Other hymns sung to the same tune include \\"Wenn meine S√ºnd' mich kr√§nken\\", \\"Dich bitten wir deine Kinder\\", \\"O Vater aller Frommen\\" and \\"Gib zum Fr√ºchten der Erden\\".  Musical settings  Hans Leo Hassler composed a four-part setting in 1608, Johann Hermann Schein set the song for two sopranos and basso continuo in 1622, and for four voices and basso continuo in 1627. Samuel Scheidt wrote a four-part setting in G√∂rlitz in 1650. Johann Sebastian Bach used the hymn as the base for his chorale cantata (1724), and used single stanzas in other cantatas. Bach composed an organ prelude, BWV 601, part of his Orgelb√ºchlein. Georg Philipp Telemann composed two cantatas, both on a libretto by Erdmann Neumeister, in 1722 and 1758. Several composers wrote organ preludes, including Dieterich Buxtehude, Johann Hermann Schein and Jan Pieter Sweelinck.

In some of his publications he took the name Musophilus.

In fact he came from around Nuremberg, and became a monk at the Abbey of St Aegidius in Nuremberg. Chelidonius wrote Latin poetry on the passion of Christ and the life of the Blessed Virgin Mary to accompany woodcuts published by Albrecht D√ºrer in 1511.

Benedict was, according to his own description of himself, a monk of St. Peter's, Gloucester. Having devoted his attention to the lives of the saints, and finding that there was no satisfactory account of St. Dubricius, he set himself the task of compiling one from what authentic records he could obtain access to. This work, which still exists in manuscript at the British Museum, was edited by Henry Wharton in his Anglia Sacra, but with the omission of several miraculous details. Thomas Tanner and other authorities supposed Benedict of Gloucester to have flourished about the year 1120; but all that can definitely be said with reference to his date seems to be that he lived after this year, in which, according to Benedict's own account, the saint's bones were removed to Llandaff. There seems, however, to be little question that Benedict was indebted to Geoffrey of Monmouth, as may be seen from comparing the two authors' accounts of King Arthur's coronation and the battle of Badon. This would make the date of the 'Vita Dubricii' after the year 1147.

According to John Bale he was distinguished for his linguistic, his scientific, and his theological skill. However, Bale finds great fault with the tendency of Benedict's teaching, accusing him of a leaning towards Novatianism, Arianism, and other heresies, and also of trusting too much to Gentile authority, 'when he should have known that the divine wisdom has no need of human inventions.' Benedict, who was abbot of the Austin friars at Norwich, apparently made himself a great reputation by his popular discourses, and in this way so approved himself to Antony Bek, bishop of Norwich (1337-1443), that this prelate appointed him suffragan in his diocese. Bale calls him 'episcopus Cardicensis.' Benedict seems to have flourished about the year 1340. He was buried at Norwich, but the date of his death is not known. His writings, as enumerated by Bale, consisted of an Alphabet of Aristotle, sermons for a year, and hortatory epistles.

The site of both buildings is the village of Skelton, in North Yorkshire, England. The house is Grade I listed. Castle The castle was built of stone by Robert de Brus in 1140. It had two look-out towers, dungeons, and a moat with a drawbridge and portcullis. In 1265 it was surrendered to King Henry III. In 1272 it went to Walter de Fauconberg and remained in the family for the next 200 years. In 1490 it was inherited by William Conyers, when it was described as ruinous. From him it passed into the Trotter family and then by marriage to the Hall family by the marriage of Joseph Hall to Catherine Trotter. Their son John inherited and changed his name to Hall-Stevenson after marrying Ann Stevenson. He formed the \\"Demoniacks\\" club who met at the ruins of the castle for drinking bouts.L. Melville, Some Eccentrics and a Woman (Martin Secker, London 1911) pp. 161-85 (Internet Archives). His son, Joseph Hall-Stevenson, died within a year of his father and thus Joseph's son John Hall-Stevenson (1766‚Äì1843) inherited the castle. In 1788 he changed his name to John Wharton and was Member of Parliament for Beverley between 1790 and 1820.Sidney Lee, Stevenson, John Hall- in Dictionary of National Biography (1885-1900), vol. 54 He also demolished the castle and replaced it by the current country house between 1770 and 1817. Country house The present house is built of dressed sandstone with a roof of Lakeland slate. It is a two-storey block with a 5-bay frontage. It incorporates some remains of the medieval castle. The house was built c.1770 and extended in 1810-1817 by Ignatius Bonomi. It was constructed between 1788 and 1817 for John Wharton, Member of Parliament for Beverley who had inherited the ruined Skelton Castle from his father Joseph Hall-Stevenson in 1786. John Wharton had changed his name from Hall-Stevenson to Wharton to comply with the terms of a legacy. He inherited a considerable fortune from his aunt, much of which he spent of demolishing the castle and building his new home. He died childless and in poverty in 1843 and Skelton devolved to his nephew John Thomas Wharton of Gilling. The property then descended in the Wharton family to William Henry Anthony Wharton, High Sheriff of Yorkshire for 1925, and on his death in 1938, to his daughter Margaret Winsome Ringrose Wharton. She had married Christopher Hildyard Ringrose, a Royal Navy captain, who had added the additional surname of Wharton to that of Ringrose. She lived there until at least 1986, by which time her relative, Major Wharton, actually ran the estate on account of her age.

The Information and Communications Technologies (ICT) sector, which is based on a free market approach, has promoted new media use. Most popular aspects of new media to Ghanaians is the Internet, and its associated mobile and desktop applications for education, health, politics, business, publishing, governance and so on. Also popular is the use of mobile devices like smartphones and tablets and computers. History of Internet Ghana was among the first countries in sub- saharan Africa to have Internet access. , about 4.2 million people or roughly 17% of the population used the Internet.Calculated using penetration rate and population data from \\"Countries and Areas Ranked by Population: 2012\\" , Population data, International Programs, U.S. Census Bureau, retrieved 26 June 2013\\"Percentage of Individuals using the Internet 2000-2012\\", International Telecommunications Union (Geneva), June 2013, retrieved 22 June 2013 Wireless technologies represent a significant area for expanding telecommunications access. The Bharti Airtel, Huawei and Microsoft are involved in efforts to improve Ghana's telecommunications network. And these wireless technologies, though efficient and wide-reaching, come at an expense to the ordinary Internet user, even if in rural areas. Governance and democracy Ghanaian entrepreneurs, such as the founders of Multimedia Group Limited, have liberalized communication in the country, where previously a \\"culture of silence\\" discouraged individuals from expressing opinions contrary to those of the ruling government.

New Media content creation, publishing, digital distribution and consumption via Internet-enabled digital devices (digital electronics) have increased. In 2002, Ghana's ICT Development Committee created a forward-thinking Information and communications technology (ICT) strategy (Information and communication technologies for development) called the Information and Communications Technology For Accelerated Development project (ICT4AD). The strategy consisted of a three-phase approach: first, the committee members came up with a framework for what they would like to achieve; next, they developed a set of policies that would help them reach that goal and finally, they delineated exactly how those policies could be implemented. Ghana mobile phone and smart phone use activity After the completion of all three phases, they took their findings to the Cabinet and Parliament of Ghana in 2003. The recommendations were subsequently approved, which cleared the way for the government to implement several e-learning, e-government and national-based IT initiatives in 2012; the Ghana Open Data Initiative and National Information Technology Agency (NITA) in 2008, as well as a national ICT infrastructure roll-out. This good planning has had a positive effect on the development of ICT-based business and general high ICT usage in Ghana: 2002 - 2005 saw a nearly nine-fold increase in the usage of mobile phones and personal computers, as well as the birth of an Information technology (IT) industry (including call-centers and some computer manufacturing) and industrial technology. In November 2011, Ghanaian business incubators and entrepreneurs David Osei, Kamil Nabong and Philips Effah, founded Dropifi, an application software that helps businesses sort customer feedback on the Internet. About 20 months later in July 2013, Dropifi application software company has become the first African company to join the 500 Startups program, a Silicon Valley-based seed accelerator and investment fund. Dropifi started at the Meltwater Entrepreneurial School of Technology in Accra (Meltwater Group). Dropifi application software helps business monitor customer feedback and it analyzes demographics, industry trends and the emotions behind the messages, to help companies respond effectively to customers. It also taps into social media platforms so companies can have a broader customer reach. Dropifi application software company in July 2013 had over 6,000 clients in more than 30 countries worldwide and is currently focused on technology international market.

Each of these five routes presents European culture in the same way as the historical routes of the Way of Saint James, the Silk Road which connects Europe to Asia, route 66 which crosses the United States, and the Pan-American Highway which goes from Alaska to Ushuaia. These routes are intended to make world travelers discover some of the most notable places in Europe (including natural, cultural sites, pilgrims, and regional specialties), and also to organize their travels more easily.  History = 1995 = The European Federation of the Mountain (FFEM), concerned with the rural development of its territories, asked a qualified consultant to represent it at an OECD workshop (Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development) which was devoted to the research of \\"the niche markets and rural development.\\" 20 country members of the Organization and the Council of Europe were represented to discuss the proposals from three experts from the private sectors and five consultants from the Expert Committee Initiative Leader Europe. The editions of the OECD No. 48256 1995 publish the summary of this workshop. In Chapter 5, Pierre Guerry, consultant of the Federation, presents the new axes that should be considered to ensure the balanced regional development of the rural areas: Quality Certification and Designations of Origin. Given the difficulty of selling local products (although these products are all attached to the same territory, they often don't have other links between them), the consultant proposed to promote the regional specialties of each territory together with its natural and cultural heritages. He considered that the reputation of the natural and cultural heritages could promote the qualified products that claim to territorial identity. These \\"home sites\\" cannot generate a large turnover, but they can create a permanent flow of visitors who renewed to research some regional specialties in memory of their stay or their passage. The consultant's proposal was therefore to create a European network of the natural and cultural heritages and the regional crafts to visit, promoted at the European level to develop a sustainable rural economy. The target clientele will be European residents and visitors from other continents, sensitive to the environmental preservation, the local cultures, and the traditions, including regional specialties. = 1998 = The division \\"ecological science\\" of UNESCO supports this private initiative by offering 120 MAB (man and biosphere) accredited by this organization and 250 national parks in Europe, representative of the natural heritage of the main regions. The MAB, national and regional parks are interconnected to form the network of the ecotourism pan-European routes. The consultant asked the PhD students of the Alpine Geography Institute of Grenoble to establish a first map of this network, called the \\"European Touring Nature Map\\". The direction of this UNESCO Division gave written permission to the consultant to affix its logo on the European map. = 2000 = A first test was executed in the Aosta Valley in Italy with the European Regional Development Fund (ERDF) DG XVI at that time. On this occasion the European foldable map in four languages was published in 1000 copies. On the back of the map, 51 local professionals were presented and located to facilitate the travelers' visits. = 2002 = The tourism expert of the United Nations Environment Programme (UNEP), after several hearings, responded favorably to the ten questions used expertise of this private initiative. = 2005 = A second test was executed in the region of Lake Tisza in Hungary. The jury was with the Sweden president of the group \\"Rural Economy and Sustainable Tourism\\" from the Assembly of European Regions, an NGO with a membership of 270 regions in Europe. Four counties, 73 villages and 150 local professionals participated in the test and signed the project charter to preserve their local environment, natural, cultural heritage and regional specialties. On this occasion, 5000 maps in two languages were published. These maps had a first layout of the five European routes, Atlantic, Mediterranean, Nordic, Central and Western route. Approved by the rural tourism group of the Assembly of European Regions, the route map took the following denomination: Touring Nature, the Pan European Routes to rural tourism (based on the village + sustainable development European label). The Minister of Planning and Hungarian Tourism gave a press conference before a dozen journalists from the print and two television channels. He considered this private initiative as an example to follow for all the regional territories in Europe wishing to promote their specificities. = 2007 = The Assembly of European Regions presented the project to EU funding to enable that the local authorities could co-finance this project to create quickly this network. The enlargement of the European Union imposed other funding priorities in view of the enlargement of the Union to ten new states. The project could not continue to be financed from the European fund, and thus the consultant who is also the project initiative chose to continue to fund its development with his own funding. = 2010 = The consultant who had organized several trips to the United States favored the transfers of experience on the European project. Indeed, the US attracts 280 million visitors every year to visit the 300 sites represented on a map (National Park System Map), which covers 391 US regions of the US. 10% of the visitors are not resident on this continent. The MAB and World Heritage labeled by UNESCO are the \\"home sites\\" which attract at once the hikers and the campers. To provide the visitors with the various services, NPS signed the contracts with 630 private companies, mainly SMEs of local products, accommodations and sports activities. Therefore, the MAB and the natural sites labeled by UNESCO in Europe can also become the \\"home sites\\" for all visitors. The strategy of the consultant, favorable to the development of a local rural economy, was confirmed by UNESCO who has selected the \\"home sites\\" for the ecotourism pan- European routes. = 2013 = The ecotourism pan-European routes finalized the layout of the five routes across 36 countries, 230 regions, 154 stages and 180 sub-steps. It proposed another way to discover Europe. = 2015 = It was proposed to all the regional specialties manufacturers in Europe to be referenced on the ecotourism pan-European routes that geo locate \\"1000 ecotourism attractions to visit in Europe: natural, cultural and handicraft.\\" Thus the main manufacturing sites of the regional specialties from the 36 countries can contribute to the financing of these routes, which are transferring the North Americans' expertise who have proved its success. They support also the development of the local economy, which in turn promote the awareness of local products. An application and a dynamic website are being created to make sure the localization of the regional specialties manufacturers referenced at the European level. The visitors can also operate easily with their mobile phones and tablets to organize their trips.  The five ecotourism pan-European routes = The Mediterranean route (about 8000 km) = This route has a variety of terrain including blue waters, marine coasts and creeks, caves, beaches, and southern market places.

Europe possesses a particularly rich and diversified natural and cultural heritage which the whole world wants to know in a simple way. The ecotourism pan-European routes give one an opportunity to discover these places: * Scenic landscapes. One can find the protected flora and fauna in 350 natural reserves which are connected to each other on formed routes of discovery in Europe * The heritage sights of UNESCO and the various small local handcraft or craft industry in different regions. * A large network of pilgrimage sites  Who created the ecotourism pan-European routes?  It is a private initiative, but many international organizations were consulted and adhered to this initiative. = The UNESCO MAB = The division Ecological Sciences MAB (Man And Biosph√®re) of the UNESCO proposed a selection of the outstanding sites both for their landscapes or their qualified architectures and for the specificity of the local products. = The UNEP = The coordination of the tourism program of the UNEP (United Nations Environmental Program) considered this international project very interesting for the sustainable tourism which attracts attention of the local professionals, travelers' transport networks, such as touring club, automobile club, and the associations for the recreational vehicle or for the hikers. = The AER = The Assembly of European Regions, a NGO (NON-GOVERNMENTAL ORGANIZATION) consists of 250 regions of 35 countries, contributed to the plan of \\"The Ecotourism of Pan European routes\\" and to the charter reference for the local professionals. The plan and the charter were tested on 4 Counties of Hungary and on a Website where the visitors can find all the useful information such as where to stay, where to eat, where to go out, what to visit, and how to organize their own personalized journeys. = The OECD = The workshops of the OECD (Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development) let 130 countries participate in exchanging ideas in the organization for the rural development. Pierre Guerry, consultant of this workshop as marketing expert, proposed an approach of ecotourism to promote the local products and the territorial specificities in the supranational level. Afterward, the approach was suggested to the institutional organizations.

Life William Benet was a younger brother of Dr Thomas Benet (died 1558), a canon of Salisbury and of St Paul's London. His uncle was John Benet, a merchant taylor of the city of London. By 1521, when he entered Doctors' Commons, he was a doctor of civil law. He may have been educated at Oxford, and be the William Bennet who took the degree of B.A. at Oxford on 31 Jan. 1512-3. (He should not be confused, however, with the William Bennet who was admitted B.C.L. on 18 Feb. 1527-8.) Benet was canon of Leighlin as early as 1522. At this time he was practising in Cardinal Wolsey's legatine court, and during the next few years he occasionally acted as the legate's commissary, and was also employed in visiting cathedral chapters and monasteries to procure the election of candidates favoured by his master. Having in these missions shown an aptitude for diplomacy, Henry VIII ordered him, in November 1528, to proceed as ambassador to Rome, in conjunction with Dr. William Knight, Sir Francis Bryan, Sir Gregory di Casale, and Peter Vannes. The new embassy was to urge the pope (Clement VII), in the first instance, to declare that the brief of his predecessor Julius II, in favour of the king's marriage with Catharine of Aragon, was a forgery, then to revoke the cause to Rome, and finally to promise a sentence in the king's favour. A report of the pope's death, and other occurrences, caused these arrangements to be altered, and Stephen Gardiner, who had been recalled from Rome and met the new ambassadors at Lyons, returned to his post, and Knight and Benet came back to England. In the following year (Gardiner was actually recalled, and Benet was sent to supply his place as resident ambassador at Rome (20 May 1529). His instructions now were to dissuade the pope from revoking the cause, as it was uncertain what his decision might be. He was also commissioned to treat for a peace between Francis I and Charles V, and for liberation of the French king's sons, who were detained as hostages for their father in Spain. He arrived in Rome on 16 June, and in the autumn he was sent to meet the emperor Charles V at Bologna, being commissioned, in conjunction with the Earl of Wiltshire and others, to persuade the emperor to consent to the king's divorce from Catharine, and to treat for a general peace between the potentates of Europe. He returned to Rome in May 1530, and was busily engaged for the next year and a half in promoting the king's cause there. In November 1531 he was recalled, but was sent back to Home after a brief visit to England, arriving there on 3 Feb. 1532, with instructions to hinder the pope from giving sentence till the emperor was back in Spain. He was present at the interview between the pope and the emperor at Bologna at the end of 1532, returning to home about April 1533. Meanwhile, the act prohibiting appeals to Rome had been pushed through parliament, and in May of the same year Thomas Cranmer's sentence dissolving the king's marriage had been pronounced at Dunstable Priory. The pope answered that critical step by a sentence of excommunication, delivered on 11 July. Benet's further stay at Rome was useless, and he was recalled. He travelled homewards in company with Edmund Bonner, afterwards bishop of London, and Sir Edward Carne, but never reached England, dying at Susa in Piedmont on 26 September 1533. His companions had some difficulty in rescuing his plate and other property, which were claimed by Charles III, Duke of Savoy. His will was proved on 11 May 1534. The ecclesiastical benefices and dignities held by him were as follows : canon of Salisbury, 6 April 1526; prebendary of Ealdland, London, 26 Nov. 1526 ; advowson of the next prebend in St. Stephen's, 28 Feb. 1528 ; next presentation of Highhungar, London diocese, 12 Dec. 1528 ; archdeacon of Dorset, 20 Dec. 1530 ; advowson of Bamack church, Northamptonshire, which he intended to bestow on his brother, 21 April 1533 ; a prebend in Southwell; and the churches of Marnehull, Dorsetshire ; Aston, Hertfordshire ; and Sutton, Surrey. In addition to the above there is some ground for believing that he was granted a reversion to the deanery of Salisbury. His name does not appear in the lists of the deans of that cathedral, but there is a letter from him to Henry VIII, thanking the king for 'remembering him with the deanery of Sarum.' Many letters written during his residence abroad are preserved in the Public Record Office and the British Museum.

Early life  Born Thomais Komnene Angelina in the early 1330s, she lost her father John II Orsini in 1335, when he was poisoned, allegedly by his wife, Anna Palaiologina, a scion of the ruling Palaiologos dynasty of the Byzantine Empire. After John II's death, his wife Anna became regent of the Despotate of Epirus for Thomais' brother, Nikephoros II. Soon, however, in 1338, the Orsini were evicted from Epirus by the Byzantine emperor Andronikos III Palaiologos, who annexed Epirus to the Byzantine Empire. Nevertheless, during the destructive Byzantine civil war that followed Andronikos III's death in 1341, most of the remaining Byzantine territories, including Epirus and Thessaly, fell to the forces of the Serbian ruler Stephen IV Du≈°an, who in 1346 founded the Serbian Empire. In 1348, Du≈°an appointed his younger half-brother, the half-Greek Simeon Uro≈° Palaiologos, as governor of Acarnania and the southern parts of Epirus.  Marriage to Simeon Uro≈°  To consolidate his position with the local population, Simeon decided to marry Thomais, the descendant of the former ruling Epirote line. Together they had three children: John Uro≈°, who succeeded as ruler of Thessaly, Stephen Uro≈°, governor of Pharsalos, and Maria, who married Thomas II Preljuboviƒá, who also ruled over Epirus. Meanwhile, Thomais' deposed brother Nikephoros was living in Constantinople where he had supported John VI Kantakouzenos in the civil war against John V Palaiologos. Titled panhypersebastos, then despotes, Nikephoros married in summer 1342 Kantakouzenos' daughter Maria and was named governor of Ainos and the Hellespont between 1351 and 1355. In 1355, Simeon rose in rebellion against Stephen Du≈°an, but in December of the same year, Du≈°an died, leaving Simeon as a credible contender for the vacant throne of the Serbian Empire, based on the Slavic tradition of brothers succeeding before sons. However, Du≈°an had already crowned his own son, Stephen V Uro≈°, as his heir. To make matters worse, in the same year, Nikephoros II overthrew the Serbian governor of Thessaly, Gregory Preljub, gained the support of the local population and soon aspired to reclaim his ancestral throne in Epirus as well. In 1356, Nikephoros entered Epirus and forced Simeon to flee from Acarnania to Kastoria, one of his strongholds in Macedonia. Despite this setback, Simeon had himself proclaimed Tsar \\"of the Serbs and the Greeks\\" at Kastoria in the place of his young nephew, back in central Serbia. Simeon launched a campaign to take over the central Serbian homelands, but the Serbian nobility, in a council held at Skopje in 1357, resolved to support Stephen V Uro≈°, in accordance with Du≈°an's will. Success escaped Simeon on the field as well: in the summer of 1358, he advanced on Zeta but was stopped at Scutari, where his army of 5000 men was defeated by the Serbian nobility. Simeon returned to Kastoria, and never again tried to invade Serbia proper. Although sometimes tenuous, Simeon was nevertheless able to expand his control over much of the southern parts of the Serbian Empire, making himself ruler of much of western Macedonia. After Nikephoros II's death in the Battle of Achelous in 1359 against invading Albanian clans, Simeon was quickly able to re-establish his suzerainty over the various magnates of Thessaly and Epirus, and established his court at Trikala in Thessaly, where he imitated the ceremonial of the Byzantine court. In 1366 at the latest (or perhaps as early as 1359/60), Simeon proclaimed his eldest son John as co-ruler. Simeon died sometime between 1369 and 1371.

It is an active Anglican parish church in the deanery of Wrockwardine, the archdeaconry of Salop, and the diocese of Lichfield. Its benefice is united with those of twelve local churches. The church is recorded in the National Heritage List for England as a designated Grade I listed building. History The nave and aisles date from the late 12th century, and the chancel from the early 14th century. The north chapel was endowed in 1334. The church was badly damaged in 1645‚Äì46 during the Civil War, and was repaired and reconstructed between 1657‚Äì62. In 1864 G. E. Street carried out a restoration, and added the south porch and vestry. In 1998 a new bell-ringing floor was inserted in the tower, which allowed the creation of a kitchen and toilets below it. Architecture=Exterior= St Michael's is constructed in sandstone ashlar, and has a tiled roof. The colour of the sandstone in the tower is mainly grey, and elsewhere it is a mixture of red and grey. The plan consists of a three-bay nave, north and south aisles, a south porch, a chancel with a north chapel and a south vestry, and a west tower. The tower is Perpendicular in style. It has a west window, and a stair turret to the north. On the north, west and south sides are clock faces, and above them are three two-light bell openings. At the top of the tower is an embattled parapet with a low spirelet and a weathervane. Below the parapet are gargoyles and a quatrefoil frieze. The base of the tower is badly weather-beaten. The parishioners, however, have a more romanticised explanation, that the damage is due to people sharpening their weapons on it in ancient times. There are three-light windows along both aisles, in the north and east walls of the chapel, and in the east and south walls of the chancel. All the north and south windows in the body of the church are straight-headed. There are doorways on both sides of the aisles, that on the south side being in the porch. =Interior= Inside the church are three-bay arcades in Transitional style, with circular piers, and capitals carved with volutes, foliage, and rams' heads. The two-bay arcade between the chancel and chapel is carried on octagonal piers. The nave, chancel, and chapel each has a double-hammerbeam roof. In the north wall of the nave is a re-set early Norman tympanum. The reredos, sedilia, piscina, pulpit, and font are all in a simple design by Street. The chandelier is by William Bradshaw, and is dated 1730. The floors are tiled throughout. Under the chapel arch is the stone effigy of a recumbent knight, dated by his armour to the 1330s. Also in the church is a bronze sundial plate dated 1718. This was removed from the churchyard in 1998 and re-set on a stoup. In the chapel and tower is stained glass of 1863‚Äì64 by Lobin et fils of Tours. Elsewhere are windows by Heaton, Butler and Bayne dating from between 1895 and 1910. The two-manual pipe organ was built in 1856 by Walker. It was rebuilt in 1894 by Charles Martin, and restored in 1956, again by Walker. There is a ring of eight bells. Six of these were cast between 1707 and 1767 by Rudhall of Gloucester, and the other two in 1812 by John Briant. On the north wall are two memorial Rolls of Honour. The older is to men of the parish who served, including those who died, in World War I (called \\"the European War\\" on the roll) which bears the motto, Honour to those who helped to right the wrong and is designed surrounded with shields bearing flags of the British home nations and allied nations, and pictures showing battleships, a gun, tank, aircraft and soldiers in a trench. The page indicates it was printed at the Co-Operative Printing Works in Longsight, Manchester. The other is to members of No. 247 Squadron RAF, (known as the China-British Squadron) who died in World War II, during which the unit were stationed at RAF High Ercall. To the side of the list of names is a poem titled The China Brits. External features In the southern part of the churchyard are the remains of a churchyard cross dating from the early-medieval period. It consists of a truncated shaft, and a base that contains a vertical hollow. The cross is included in the Grade I listing of the church. It is also a scheduled monument. The boundary wall of the churchyard, constructed in sandstone, is listed at Grade II. In the churchyard, as well as graves covering several centuries, there is a sundial from the 18th-century which records the time in Jerusalem, Rome and Plymouth in Massachusetts. The churchyard contains nine Commonwealth war graves, of six British soldiers of World War I and a British airman and two Canadian airmen of World War II.

Biography Benn was born on 1 January 1801, at Tanderagee, County Armagh. His grandfather, Jonn Benn, came from Cumberland about 1760 as engineer of the Newry canal. His father, also John Benn (1767-1853), was proprietor of a brewery in Belfast ; George was his fourth son. He was educated at the Belfast Academy, under Rev. Dr. Bruce; afterwards under Sheridan Knowles, then a teacher of English at Belfast. He entered the collegiate classes of the Belfast Academical Institution in 1816, being one of the original alumni, and took gold medals in logic (1817) and moral philosophy (1818). In 1819 the faculty prize was offered for the 'best account of a parish.' Benn was the successful essayist, with the parish of Belfast as his theme. He gained also in 1821 the faculty prize ('The Crusades'), and Dr. Tennant's gold medal ('Sketch of Irish Authors in the Seventeenth and Eighteenth Centuries'), The lad's essay of 1819 attracted the attention of James M'Knight, LL.D., then editor of the Belfast News-Letter who offered to print and publish it. It was issued anonymously in an enlarged form in 1823, with three maps and sixteen engravings by J. Thomson. For so young a writer it was a work of uncommon judgment and research, exceedingly well written, with an eye for scenery and a taste for economics as well as for antiquities. It is not superseded by Benn's later and later labours. Benn, with his brother Edward (1798- 1874), engaged in distilling near Downpatrick; subsequently the brothers spent the prime of their days on an estate they purchased at Glenravel, near Ballymena. Here, in an unimproved district, they planted the hillsides, ploughed the moors, built good houses, and collected a valuable library. They endeavoured to create a new industry by an experiment in the manufacture of potato spirit, but excise regulations (since repealed) frustrated their object. The cost of the experiment, and the losses from potato disease, induced the brothers to undertake a business in Liverpool for some years. Returning to Glenravel, a casual circumstance led to a rich discovery of iron ore in the Glenravel hills; the first specimen was smelted in 1851 under Edward Benn's direction ; in 1866 an agreementsee The Mountains of Iron, by K J O'Hagan, Mid-Antrim Part 2, 1991 for the Agreement. was made with Mr. James Fisher, of Barrow-in-Furness, to work the mineral beds. Hence came a new and valuable addition to the commercial products of Ulster, which has since attained important proportions. Meanwhile, Edward Benn was contributing antiquarian articles to various journals (Journ. Kilkenny Arch√¶ol. Soc., Irish Penny Journal, &c.;), and forming a fine archaeological collection, now in the Belfast Museum. It had been proposed to George to resume and complete the history of Belfast. He modestly indicated, as more fit for the task, Mr. William Pinkerton, who collected some materials, but died (1871) without having begun the history. Pinkerton's papers were submitted to George Benn for publication, but he found employment of them impracticable, and states in his preface to his history, 'It is all my own work from beginning to end.' He returned to Belfast after his brother's death in 1874, publishing A History of the Town of Belfast in 1877.By strange coincidence a volume of the same size and appearance as Mr. Benn's was independently published that year at Portland, Maine: History of the City of Belfast in the State of Maine, from its First Settlement in 1770 to 1875, by John Williamson. A second volume appeared in 1880. This supplementary volume, though the proof- sheets were 'corrected by a kind friend,' the late John Carlisle, head of the English department in the Royal Academical Institution, bears evidence of the author's affecting statement: 'Before I had proceeded very far, my sight entirely failed.' Benn died on 8 January 1882. He is buried in Belfast City Cemetery. Edward and George Benn were members of the nonsubscribing presbyterian (unitarian) body, but wide in their sympathies and broad in their charities beyond the limits of their sect. Edward was the founder, and George the benefactor, of three hospitals in Belfast (the 'Eye, Ear, and Throat,' the 'Samaritan,' and the 'Skin Diseases'), and their gifts to educational institutions were munificent. Both were unmarried. They left four sisters.

The work was composed between 1964 and 1966 from a commission by NHK (the Japan Broadcasting Corporation) for National Art Performance of Ministry of Education, Science and Culture.Compositions for the same purpose include Green by Toru Takemitsu He won 16th Otaka prize with this concerto. On July 10 and 11, 1967, the work was recorded for its premier broadcasting at NHK broadcasting centre and the recording was on air on November 5. This premier recording was performed by pianist Hiroko Nakamura accompanied by NHK Symphony Orchestra conducted by Hiroshi Wakasugi. The first public performance was on November 29, 3 weeks later from broadcasting, at the extra concert of NHK symphony orchestra with conductor Tadashi Mori and the same pianist. This work requires two flutes, a piccolo, two oboes, two clarinets (second player also uses bass clarinet), two bassoons, four horns, two trumpets, three trombones, a tuba, timpani, a vibraphone, two percussionists (cymbal, tamtam, jingle bell, wood block and tubular bells), strings and piano solo.  Structure  This work consists of three movements and takes just under half an hour in performance. While writing the work the composer kept in mind his predecessors' adage, \\"What a pianist has are not two hands, but ten fingers\\", which, he explained later, appears as highly demanding piano part throughout the concerto. The first movement, allegro animato, composed between 1964 and the summer of 1966, is written in expanded sonata form with the first subject displayed by the solo piano at the beginning of the movement and the second subject distinguished by a prominent flute part. Several cadenzas of coloratura style, which Liszt also loved in his compositions, are inserted in the music. In contrast to the longer exposition compared to general sonata movements, the recapitulation is placed within. rather than after, the development.Áü¢‰ª£, 1996, p.143-149 Throughout the second movement, adagio misterioso, composed together with the third movement between 1966 and May 1967, the note C is played in ostinato rhythm, which the composer explained as a \\"recollection of dream in my younger days.\\" The third movement, a rondo, progresses as allegro - andante - vivace molto capriccioso. The music, recalling the melody of the first movement, varies rapidly until the end of the concerto.

This work is subtitled Kamikaze after the aircraft Kamikaze, and was premiered under the baton of the composer on June 24, 1938, by the Takarazuka Symphony Orchestra, with Maxim Shapiro at the piano. Contrary to potential inference based on the approximate era of composition, the name \\"Kamikaze\\" is not related to the suicide attack Kamikaze employed by the Empire of Japan during World War II. This work was not successful partly because the progressive style of Ohzawa was beyond the comprehension of audiences of those days. Although the recording was broadcast on radio after the premiere, this concerto, quite demanding for both performer and audience, was not performed again for a long time. The composer's family published the score of this work on their own after his death.  Structure  The work consists of three traditional movements. Although the concerto is marked as A-flat, but he treated the tonality considerably freely. The first movement, allegro assai, begins with the declaration, by trombones and strings, of \\"motto for whole work\\", three notes; A-flat, E-flat and F, which later appear as the fundamental elements of this work written in sonata form. First subject is gathered motives which remind the audiences of the aircraft flying through the clouds. The second subject is the melody savage as well as brilliant. Throughout the development, the music never fails to recall the sky journey. In the short coda, long tone of piccolo sounds as the aircraft flying away. The beginning of the G major second movement, andante cantabile, by saxophone is notable and the movement is jazzy rather than classical. Ohzawa utilized pentatonic scale in light of similarity to blues, consequently the music succeeds in displaying delicate oriental mood even in jazzy atmosphere. This is induced from \\"motto\\" exhibited in the first movement. The movement of ternary form ends by melting into dream. The third movement, allegro moderato, is the finale with introduction, rondo of scherzando rhythm and coda. Wood winds also play toccata in this movement. The sudden invasion of cabaret-like tune obviously suggests the approaching of aircraft to its destination. The cadenza of soloist is followed by recapitulation of the main subject. Restless coda representing the sound of engine by strings leads the unexpectedly sudden finish of the concerto. Pianistic virtuosity and modern style of composer peak in this movement.

He worked as an illustrator for a variety of newspapers and journals including Klods-Hans, Gnisten, Bl√¶ksprutten, Ekstra Bladet and Politiken.\\"Carl Jensen\\", Den Store Danske. Retrieved 22 February 2013. Biography Jensen started to sketch before he was 20, contributing to the leading joke sheet Klods-Hans. From 1905 to 1958, he worked as an illustrator for the Copenhagen papers. Initially, together with Aksel J√∏rgensen and Axel Nygaard, his sketches were directed at depicting the dreadful conditions for the poor. Later, during his 40 years with Politiken, he was more of a bipartisan cartoonist although he was still critical of the upper classes, especially the Liberal Party. He was behind a long series of caricatures of Prime Minister Niels Neergaard and Interior Minister Oluf Krag before the 1924 elections. He also contributed sketches to news reports, including illustrations of court rooms where photography was not allowed. His caricatures included cartoons of many of his artist friends from 1909 to 1920, published in Ekstra Bladet, and of Danish and foreign politicians, in Politiken. Initially his work was inspired by the satirical journal Simplicissimus but he soon found his own style, characterized by the quick, clear lines he used to depict in his cool, unemotional way the changing expressions and typical gestures of the figures of the day. At the beginning of the First World War, he was one of the first to bring Cubism to Denmark. In 1918, he left Ekstra Blad to move to Tisvilde where his friend William Scharff also worked, becoming one of the country's most important Cubists. Around 1920, he began painting watercolours and gouaches of Copenhagen's harbour and canals.Thorkild Kj√¶rgaard, \\"Carl Jensen\\" Kunstindeks Danmark & Weilbachs kunstnerleksikon.

The main actors are Shams al-Baroudi and Yusuf Sh√•ban. It is adapted from a novel by Ism√•eel Walieddin. Samar Habib, author of Female Homosexuality in the Middle East: Histories and Representations, said \\"that the title of the film can \\"be easily translated\\" as Malatily Bathhouse.\\"Habib, p. 120. The opening credits of the film have the English title An Egyptian Tragedy. Habib said that it was \\"strangely translated\\" into An Egyptian Tragedy. Plot The beginning shows what Habib calls a \\"long scenic tribute\\" to Cairo and to the general city. Habib said that the director \\"visually implies the polymorphous vagaries of the city in which an immoral underworld is bound to flourish.Habib, p. 120-121. The main character, Aƒ•mad, leaves rural eastern Egypt for the city hoping to become economically self- sufficient, get an apartment for his parents, and obtain a law degree. He and his family are refugees from a town occupied by the Israeli army, Isma√•ilia. Ali, the owner of the Malatily Bathhouse, offers to let him stay there for free. Aƒ•mad encounters several characters there, including Na√•eema, a prostitute who he becomes obsessed with, and Raouf, a male homosexual. Ali later has Aƒ•mad work as his accountant. Aƒ•mad eventually has sexual intercourse with Na√•eema. Aƒ•mad finds a lack of employment opportunities and becomes associated with the bathhouse, so his original goals are not met. Habib said \\"There appears to be a sensitive awareness that foreign viewers of the film should not regard its content as conspiring with or approving of the morally loose behaviour of the libertines it depicts.\\" Habib argues that this seems to depict Egyptian society in a \\"state of disarray\\" likely to be occurring during the Suez Crisis.Habib, p. 121. Cast and characters Aƒ•mad is the main character. One character, Raouf Bey, is a male homosexual. Habib said that Raouf \\"subverts popular understanding of homosexuality by being unable to be brought back into the norm of heterosexual desires.\\" Raouf makes advances towards Aƒ•mad, who initially cannot comprehend them. He is good friends with √Öli. Habib wrote that Raouf is \\"an unsympathetic character\\" as he exploits men who do not willingly do homosexual acts but require him in order to make a living, and that Raouf's sexuality \\"initially appears\\" to be without emotion and only physical.Habib, p. 122. Habib wrote that it appears Raouf wishes to prostitute Aƒ•mad but in fact he truly wants Aƒ•mad to be his boyfriend,Habib, p. 122-123. and while citing the works of the historian Jabarti he laments that he cannot do what he wants in the modern society despite the freedom of the past.Habib, p. 123. Mu√•lim √Öli is the owner of the bathhouse. He gives male prostitutes to Raouf. Police arrest him after Kamal commits murder. Na√•eema, a female prostitute, has her first romantic sexual relation with Ahmad. She comes from a poor background and prostitutes herself in order to support herself. Kamal, a male prostitute, is an employee of √Öli. He murders a casino director who Habib implies is a \\"sugar daddy\\" and who is the new employer of Kamal. Habib wrote that the male prostitutes are \\"incidental to the main plot\\" and all originate from desperate, impoverished backgrounds. Samir is a male prostitute. Aƒ•mad tells him he should find a reliable job that has respectability, and Samir responds stating that he is poor and does not have the luxury of planning for the far future. Through Samir and Fatƒ•i, Ahmad learns that some people cannot go ahead in life through perseverance, self-education, and diligence, and that some people have to be prostitutes in order to survive. Fatƒ•i is another male prostitute. In a conversation with Aƒ•mad he tells him a concept similar to that given by Samir. Mohsin is an employee of the bathhouse.

A 1942 Brackett story, \\"The Sorcerer of Rhiannon\\", also uses the name; however, it is the name of a place rather than a character. Publication The novel was first published in the June 1949 issue of Thrilling Wonder Stories as \\"Sea-Kings of Mars\\". Its first book publication was in the early Ace Double D-36 with Conan the Conqueror by Robert E. Howard. Summary The protagonist is Matthew Carse, a 35-year-old former archaeologist-turned-thief in the Martian city of Jekkara. He is approached by Penkawr, who attempt to coerce Carse into helping him sell a relic stolen from a Martian tomb, the Sword of Rhiannon. Rhiannon was a legendary figure from the ancient Martian race of the Quiru who made the Promethean decision to share Quiru science with another race of Martians, the Dhuvians. Like Prometheus, his actions did not go unpunished: he was sealed in a tomb and became known to history as \\"The Cursed One\\". The Quiru left Mars to the Dhuvians and other hybrid races soon afterward. Carse accompanies Penkawr into the tomb to loot it but is transfixed by a sphere he finds within. Penkawr pushes Carse into it, sending him back millions of years to the lush Mars of the Sea-Kings. The Sea-Kings are engaged in war with the Empire of Sark, descended from the Dhuvians and both sides wish to obtain the artifacts in Rhiannon's tomb. Carse, of course, is the only person who knows the location of the tomb, though he is uneasy. As he journeyed back, he felt that another presence had joined him. Carse is taken captive by Lady Ywain of Sark and becomes a galley slave on her ship. Also serving as a galley slave is Boghaz, a fat, lazy criminal and merchant who initially seems more than happy to sell Carse out. However, Ywain realises that Carse possessed the Sword of Rhiannon and they attempt to extract the location of the tomb from his mind. Carse resists, with the aid of the mysterious presence and he leads the galley slaves in mutiny. Arriving at the realm of the Sea-Kings, the noblewoman Emer senses the presence in Carse, who offers to reveal the location of the tomb. The presence in Carse's mind reveals itself to be Rhiannon himself, seeking atonement for the crimes he committed eons before and the last, desperate struggle to save the planet reaches its conclusion as the whole world changes around them. Influence and reception Rich Horton reviewed the Ace Double edition as \\"really wonderful pulp Sword and Sorcery, pitch perfect, beautifully written, twistily plotted. The resolution is deeply romantic, with a shadow of true sadness.\\" The Encyclopedia of Science Fiction described it as \\"perhaps the finest\\" of Brackett's Mars novels, \\"concisely and eloquently written ... admirably combines adventure with a strongly romantic vision of an ancient sea-girt Martian civilization, which is described with a remarkable combination of freshness and nostalgia.\\" References 1949 American novels 1949 science fiction novels 1949 fantasy novels Novels by Leigh Brackett Mars in fiction Works originally published in Wonder Stories Ace Books books ","title":"The Sword of Rhiannon"},{"id":"38605509","text":"The John H.

Van Noppen had been investigating illegal practices by farmers and businessmen in Belgium and was shot dead by assailants outside his house in the village of Wechelderzande in the Province of Antwerp. A number of people connected with the illegal supply of growth hormones to livestock were sentenced in connection with the murder. \\"Hormone Mafia\\" The use of growth hormones on livestock has the potential to increase the profit per animal between ten and 100 percent. However, the use of such hormones has been banned by the European Union since 1989 and so organised crime, motivated by the immense profits, moved into the business. This was a particular concern in Belgium, where several government inspectors had been threatened or had attempts made on their lives. Murder In February 1995, 43-year-old Karel Van Noppen, who had been investigating the phenomenon, was shot dead outside his front door. The killing provoked outrage throughout Belgium, with a torchlight procession led by his widow in Flanders and calls to investigate and better regulate the cattle industry.

It dates from the mid-15th century and is regarded as one of the most important surviving collections of music from fifteenth-century Germany. Other names are Locheimer and Lochheimer Liederbuch.  Description  The song manuscript comprises 45 songs in one- part to three-part settings on 93 pages. 44 songs are in German, one is Dutch. Other sources arrive at 47 or 50 songs. The differences in numbering come from some songs existing in several versions; some melodies are fragmented or without text or title. For almost half of the songs, the book is the only source. Conrad Paumann Right page of organ tablature The main scrivener was some friar Jodocus of Windsheim, who is thought to have been a student of the school of the Nuremberg organist and composer Conrad Paumann. The bulk of the collection dates from the years 1451 to 1453; supplements were added until 1460. The collection shows the increasing value of secular songs, along with sacred ones, including \\"All mein‚Äô Gedanken, die ich hab\\" (All my thoughts that I have), \\"Ich fahr dahin\\" (I go away), \\"Der Wald hat sich entlaubet\\" (The forest is leafless) and \\"Ich spring an diesem Ringe\\" (I jump in this circle). Individual songs can be assigned to authors of late medieval manuscripts, namely the Monk of Salzburg and Oswald von Wolkenstein (\\"Wach auf, mein Hort\\", Wake up, my darling). The second part of the manuscript, titled Fundamentum organisandi, includes 31 organ tablatures by Conrad Paumann. The two parts, created independently, were combined soon after their origin.  Name of the songbook  The songbook was named after one of its first owners, who entered his name around 1500 as \\"Wolflein von Locham[e]r ist das gesenngk b√ºch\\" (the song book belongs to Wolflein von Lochamr). For a while it was assumed that he was Jewish, because the given name is common among Jews and the book contains writing in Hebrew. The addition of \\"Lochamer\\" was then understood as referring to one of several villages called Lochheim. But it is now confirmed that the dedication was written by someone not familiar with Yiddish or Hebrew, and that Wolflein Lochamer was a member of a Christian Nuremberg patrician family.  Reception  In 1811, in a letter to the musicologist Johann Nikolaus Forkel, the antiquarian Christoph Gottlieb von Murr unearthed a remarkable set of fifteenth century manuscripts from Nurenberg with minnelieder or \\"German minstrel love songs\\" dating from 1455, 1456, 1452 and 1453: these became the Lochamer-Liederbuch. Despite containing some organ compositions, the main interest has almost always been on the songs. The song book had changed ownership several times, in 1858 becoming the \\"Codex Wenigerode\\" as part of a library. Facsimile copies were made, notably by the philologist Hans Ferdinand Massmann. Baron Joseph von La√überg, the germanist, got to know about the song book through Massmann. In 1836, during a stay at his castle at Eppishausen in the Swiss alps, von La√überg encouraged his sister-in-law, the writer and composer Annette von Droste-H√ºlshoff, to arrange some of the songs for voice and piano, thus creating part of her (unpublished) artistic legacy. The manuscript of the song book was critically edited by Friedrich Wilhelm Arnold and first published by Friedrich Chrysander in Leipzig in 1867 in his Jahrbuch f√ºr musikalische Wissenschaft, Bd. 2 (Yearbook for musical science, vol 2). The Lochamer-Liederbuch was part of the library of the Prince of Stolberg- Wernigerode in Wernigerode. It was sold in 1931 and is now located in the Berlin State Library.

In 1984, she founded Ajoka Theatre where social themes were staged in theaters, on the street and in public places. With Ajoka Theater, she performed in Asia and Europe. Early life and career Madeeha Gauhar was born in 1956 in Karachi, Pakistan. After obtaining a Master of Arts degree in English literature, she moved to England where she obtained another master's degree, studying theater sciences at the University of London.STARBUZZ: Ajoka brings its act to Karachi Dawn (newspaper), Published 11 October 2008, Retrieved 10 September 2019Singh Bajeli, Diwan (2 February 2007) A voice for peace and amity The Hindu (newspaper), Retrieved 10 December 2019 In 1983, with her studies completed, she returned to her native country, settling in Lahore. There, Gauhar and her husband Shahid Nadeem founded Ajoka Theatre in 1984, a notable theater group of significance in the city. Ajoka (English:) elaborates on the oral tradition of Bhand and Nautanki and found a flourishing base in the area that overlaps the province of Punjab. Despite her educational background in the UK and China, Gauhar did not restrict herself to conventional classical Western theater techniques. Rather, she aimed to incorporate authentic Pakistani elements with contemporary sentiments. With Ajoka, Gauhar performed in Pakistan, and subsequently in many other countries. The troupe performed in the region such as India, Bangladesh, Nepal and Sri Lanka, as well as in several countries in Europe. The most important motive of the shows, according to Gauhar, is the promotion of a just, humane, secular and equal society. She directed almost 36 plays which were performed in Pakistan as well as in other Asian countries. In directing performances in the theater, Gauhar utilised aesthetics and theatrical techniques to reflect the moral, social and political reality of contemporary Pakistan. A recurrent theme for her, as a feminist, was the subject of women's rights in a society that is greatly dominated by men. In 2006, she was honored with a Prince Claus Award from the Netherlands.Prince Claus Awards award winners of 2006 (Madeeha Gauhar listed on Laureate Database) Retrieved 10 December 2019 In 2007 she won the International Theatre Pasta Award. In 2007, Ajoka performed a play that was written and directed by Gauhar, the Burqavaganza (Burqa-vaganza), which led to great controversy. Actors dressed in burkas acted out themes of sexual discrimination, intolerance and fanaticism. From a Western perspective, the piece was a rather innocent performance on hypocrisy of a society that bathes in corruption. In her own country, though, Members of Parliament called for a ban of the performance, and the Minister of Culture threatened with sanctions, if the stage play continued. The ban on the stage play was finally imposed as threatened, but the non-governmental organizations and women's rights activists had the play translated into English and did staged performances internationally as an sign of support to Ajoka.Rehman, Sonya (20 June 2008) Viva Ajoka!

Madeeha Gauhar tried to promote peace between India and Pakistan and tirelessly campaigned for it. She also was widely considered as one of Pakistan's leading women's rights activists. Madeeha Gauhar's Ajoka Theater's plays were frequently based on social and human rights issues - for example female literacy, honour killings, religious extremism.

None of his work is known to have survived and he is known only from a brief discussion by the Latin author Pliny the Elder.Hobey-Hamsher Pliny's passage comes in the middle of his discussion of painting in Book XXXV of his Natural History, completed about 78 AD: Pliny the Elder, Natural History, xxxv.112 > It is well to add an account of the artists who won fame with the brush in > painting smaller pictures. Amongst them was Peiraikos. In mastery of his art > but few take rank above him, yet by his choice of a path he has perhaps > marred his own success, for he followed a humble line, winning however the > highest glory that it had to bring. He painted barbers' shops, cobblers' > stalls, asses, eatables and similar subjects, earning for himself the name > of rhyparographos [painter of dirt/low things]. In these subjects he could > give consummate pleasure, selling them for more than other artists received > for their large pictures. In the terms of later art history, he painted cabinet paintings of genre subjects. Generally speaking, Pliny seems to derive his information from Varro (116 BC ‚Äì 27 BC), and Peiraikos may have been contemporary with or somewhat earlier than him,Sellers, E., Introduction to \\"Pliny\\" (edition as quoted), p. lxxxiv placing the painter at the end of the Hellenistic period or in the early Graeco-Roman period. From his tone, it seems that \\"Pliny does not know how to judge Piraeicus\\".H√©nin, 135 - \\"Pline ne sait comment juger Piraeicus\\" Early Modern commentators were to take both approving and disapproving attitudes to later artists compared to him, often assuming that Pliny's meaning followed their own.Modern scholars have also interpreted Pliny's cryptic remarks with enthusiasm: his \\"humble line\\" has been taken as the inability to draw properly, and \\"consummate pleasure\\" (consummata voluptas) seen as a verbal play on the pleasure of eating, Peiraikos' subjects may well have been given a comic treatment,Kettering, 701 but this is not clear. Some equivalent subjects survive in Roman art, especially in shops and shopfronts in Pompeii, small sections of floor mosaics, and in the reliefs of men at work on the Tomb of Eurysaces the Baker in Rome (c. 50-20 BC), but it is interesting to know that such subjects were popular with collectors at the top end of the Roman art market.Plommer, 99, gives a quick survey of the Hellenistic and Roman still-life tradition. Propertius makes a reference to a painter of \\"small art\\" in his Elegies,Elegies III.ix.12 but the surviving text is corrupt, and it is generally thought to intend a reference to the 5th century BC Athenian painter Parrhasios,Hobey-Hamsher whose trompe l'oeil painted curtain fooled Xeuxis, an anecdote reported in another passage of Pliny. In Early Modern art criticism Diego Vel√°zquez, An Old Woman Cooking Eggs, 1618 Peiraikos became frequently referred to in discussions of art in the late Renaissance and especially the Baroque periods, when genre subjects were becoming popular again, and the need for classical authority was still strongly felt.Courtwright, 500; Sullivan, 237-239 The ambiguous tone of Pliny's comments allowed later writers to enlist Pliny on either side of the argument for and against Peiraikos' humble modern equivalents. One of the first artists to specialize in genre subjects,Sullivan, 236, and the rest of the article Pieter Aertsen was an innovative late-16th-century painter of kitchen scenes, who was compared to Peiraikos by the Dutch Renaissance humanist Hadrianus Junius (Adriaen de Jonghe, 1511‚Äì1575) in his Batavia, published posthumously in 1588, which compares Aertsen at each point of Pliny's description in a wholly laudatory manner.Sullivan, 240. The whole article provides an extended discussion of the reception of early genre paintings and their context in contemporary art theory. The popularity of Pliny in Northern Europe in particular is discussed on pp. 240-241 An article by Zoran Kwak argues that a painting by his son Pieter Pietersz the Elder (1540‚Äì1603), normally called Market Scene with the Journey to Emmaus, which features prominently a half-naked figure who is clearly a cook (with Jesus and his companions as smaller figures behind him), in fact represents a self- portrait in a partly comic spirit, depicted as Peiraikos.Kwak, 223‚Äì228. The painting's location is unknown, and it was last known in a private collection in Berlin in 1929. Pieter van Laer (1599 ‚Äì c. 1642) was a Dutch Golden Age painter of genre scenes, active for over a decade in Rome, where his nickname was Il Bamboccio. Artists working in his style, who often painted just such scenes of everyday life as Pliny lists, became known as the Bamboccianti, painters in Bamboccio's manner. Peiraikos is often mentioned in the controversies over the Bamboccianti, for example by Salvator Rosa in his Satires, and later by the Dutch biographer of artists, Samuel Dirksz van Hoogstraten in his Inleyding tot de Hooge Schoole der Schilderkonst (Introduction to the Academy of Painting), Rotterdam 1678.Levine, 571 note 14 As genre painting became an important element of Dutch Golden Age painting, Peiraikos was used to provide classical precedent for such work, in the relatively few discussions of the appropriateness of such art by Karel van Mander in his Schilder-boeck (1604) and Arnold Houbraken in his The Great Theatre of Dutch Painters (1718‚Äì1719).Kettering, 701 and 712, note 40 Having originally been often rather cheap, by the late 17th century the best Dutch genre scenes became sought after by collectors across Europe at very high prices, a development following Pliny's account of Peiraikos that was bemoaned by Lessing in his Laocoon (1763), mentioning Dutch painting specifically.H√©nin, 135, n. 79 In Spain, where bodegones or genre tavern scenes had become popular, Peiraikos was referred to by Francisco Pacheco and later Antonio Palomino in the same way,Kettering, 701 and 712, note 40 with Palomino comparing Velasquez to him.Quoted and discussed in Saporta, 114‚Äì119 A reference by the Jesuit writer Baltasar Graci√°n, comparing Peiraikos to an unnamed contemporary painter also seems to refer to Velasquez.Saporta, 118, citing Svetlana Alpers In Italy he is mentioned in passing by Cardinal Gabriele Paleotti, whose De sacris et profanis imaginibus (1582, \\"Discourse on Sacred and Profane Images\\") was one of the treatises setting out the Counter- Reformation church's views on the proper role and content of art.Book 1, p. 73 in the 2012 English translation from Getty, google books Giovanni Battista Agucchi, the secretary of Cardinal Odoardo Farnese and a mover and shaker in the Roman art scene, called Jacopo Bassano the modern Peiraikos, contrasting the pair to Caravaggio and Demetrios of Alopeka, who sculpted \\"warts and all\\" portraits of important figures.Sohm, 458 In France, Andr√© F√©libien was an influential codifier of the theory of the hierarchy of genres in art, and cited Pliny on Peiraikos, assuming the disapproval of his predecessor.H√©nin, 136 and note 80 A passage in the diary of Paul Klee meditates on Peiraikos as an \\"artist-martyr\\".Saporta, 119, with quotation In literature, Rabelais in Gargantua and Pantagruel (Prologue, Book V, c. 1564) compares himself to Peiraikos as a specialist in low subjects:Saporta, 118-119; and \\"... and yet for Aesop a Place was found, and the Office of Mythologist; in like manner, inasmuch as I do not aspire to a higher Degree, I pray that they may not disdain to receive me in the Office of small Riparographer and Follower of Piraeicus\\" (or \\"Puny Riparographer, or Riffraff-scribler of the Sect of Pyrricus\\" as his translator Peter Motteux put it in 1694).Quoted, OED, \\"Rhyparographer\\" Rhyparographer The term used by Pliny has been anglicized as \\"rhyparographer\\", \\"A painter of low or mean subjects\\", which the OED first records in 1656, with \\"rhyparography\\" in 1678.OED, \\"Rhyparographer\\", \\"Rhyparography\\" NotesReferences *Courtwright, Nicola, Origins and Meanings of Rembrandt's Late Drawing Style, The Art Bulletin, Vol. 78, No. 3 (Sep., 1996), pp. 485‚Äì510, JSTOR *H√©nin, Emmanuelle, Ut pictura theatrum: th√©√¢tre et peinture de la Renaissance italienne au classicisme fran√ßais (in French), 2003, Librairie Droz, , 9782600008259, google books *Hobey-Hamsher, C., \\"Peiraikos.\\" Grove Art Online, Oxford Art Online, Oxford University Press, accessed February 22, 2013, subscriber link *Kettering.
