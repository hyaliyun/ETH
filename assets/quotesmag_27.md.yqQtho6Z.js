St. Clair County, named by the governor for himself, was the first county in what has since become Illinois; its original boundaries were everything east of the Illinois River, south of the Mackinaw River, west of Fort Massac, and north of the Ohio and Mississippi rivers. In 1793, county officials purchased a private house at Cahokia and converted it into a courthouse. This building, now known as the Old Cahokia Courthouse, remained in use until 1814, when the seat was moved to Belleville because of Cahokia's susceptibility to river flooding.Sherman, Robert W., and John A.C. Schulte. National Register of Historic Places inventory/nomination : Old Cahokia Courthouse. National Park Service: 1972-02-07, 6. Previous courthouses in Belleville Three previous courthouses have stood on Belleville's public square. The first was ordered in 1815 for a cost of $1,525; it was a frame building completed by Etienne Pensoneau in 1817. However, the building quickly became too small; after just ten years, the county court ordered that a replacement be built. The second courthouse was a brick building, constructed for twice the price of its predecessor; contractor William Fowler seems to have finished it in June 1831. It remained in use for thirty years. The third Belleville courthouse was constructed from 1859 to 1861 at a cost slightly surpassing $100,000 under the inspection of Nathaniel Niles. It appears to have needed various finishing touches, as the county spent more than $4,000 in 1862 and 1863 on further construction. This building was a rectangular structure two stories high with a raised basement and a shallow-sloped hip roof. Seven windows on each side pierced the sides, and five each end, with the main entrance in the middle of one end. A grand staircase provided access from the street, and the entrance was sheltered by a pedimented porch supported by two-story Corinthian columns. In 1893, it was expanded with gable-roofed wings to the rear, and a dome was set at the center.Weiser, Dennis. Illinois courthouses : an illustrated history. Virginia Beach: Donning, 2009. Current courthouse As St. Clair County's population continued to grow into the 1960s, the Civil War-era courthouse in turn became too small, and another building was needed. Despite its prominent location in the community, county officials chose to demolish the building and erect a new courthouse on the same site, and a grassroots historic preservation campaign failed to save the old courthouse. Destruction began in 1972, and the new courthouse was completed in 1976. Today's courthouse is a modernist building of concrete and glass; the basic plan is the shape of the letter \\"L\\", five stories tall. It sits high above the surrounding street; a staircase providing access from the sidewalk is interrupted by two landings. Architects Hellmuth, Obata + Kassabaum included elements such as a pool at the center of the building and a glass-covered bridge providing access to a parking garage across one of the surrounding streets.

His work also focuses on church-state issues, constitutional law, and environmental law. He is a professor of law at Boston University School of Law. Biography Wexler earned a B.A., magna cum laude in East Asian Studies from Harvard University in 1991, his M.A. in religious studies from the University of Chicago Divinity School in 1993, and his J.D. from Stanford Law School in 1997, where he was a Notes Editor on the Stanford Law Review and a Semifinalist in the Kirkwood Moot Court competition. After law school, Wexler clerked for Judge David Tatel on the United States Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit and for Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg at the Supreme Court of the United States. He was an attorney advisor at the Department of Justice Office of Legal Counsel from 1999 to 2001.

He is admitted to the bar in Illinois and Massachusetts. Supreme Court laughter In 2005, Wexler's pioneering research counted the number of times each Supreme Court justice generated laughter in the courtroom, as indicated in the official transcript, as well as each Justice's \\"Laughter Episodes Instigated Per Argument Average,\\" by dividing each justice's total laughs for the 2004-2005 term by the number of oral arguments he or she attended.Tonja Jacobi and Matthew Sag, Taking Laughter Seriously at the Supreme Court, March 9, 2019, retrieved March 15, 2019 This lighthearted inquiry to determine \\"the relative funniness of the Justices\\" was replicated by Wexler in 2007. Since then, other scholars have built on these initial studies and seriously examined how laughter is used by the justices at the Supreme Court. Publications In addition to laughter during sessions of the Supreme Court of the United States, Wexler's research focuses on church-state issues and environmental law. He also writes legal fiction. Books Our Non-Christian Nation: How Wiccans, Satanists, Atheists, and Other Non-Christians are Demanding their Rightful Place in American Public Life (2019) Wexler examines how a smaller portion of the United States population identifies as Christian than in the past, and how the growing non-Christian religions are using the law to assert themselves and create a more diverse public square. Wexler travels the country to obtain first hand accounts of the religious disputes of the Summum in Salt Lake City, Wiccans in Wisconsin, Atheists in Greece, New York, and Muslims in North Carolina. When God isn't Green: A World-Wide Journey to Places Where Religious Practice and Environmentalism Collide (2016) Wexler details his trips to sites where religious practices negatively impact the environment. Because large groups of people engage in these practices, it is the harm caused by the cumulative practice that needs to be weighed against religious freedom. Tuttle in the Balance (2015) Wexler's first novel follows a United States Supreme Court Justice during a midlife crisis. Although the story is satirical, it also examines serious legal issues such as filming Supreme Court arguments. Ultimately, the story is a reminder that Supreme Court justices are ordinary people. The Adventures of Ed Tuttle, Associate Justice: and Other Stories (2012) Wexler's first collection of short stories takes readers to disparate places: a zoo where all of the animals are black and white, a children's camp where they have to collect clams, Justice Sonia Sotomayor's confirmation hearing run by the 1977 Kansas City Royals, and Henry Clay's advice to various people. The title story about Justice Ed Tuttle trying to pick up women while on vacation was expanded into Wexler's novel, Tuttle in the Balance. The Odd Clauses: Understanding the Constitution Through Ten of its Most Curious Provisions (2012) Wexler chose to write about ten of the lesser known parts of the United States Constitution. He examines provisions regarding incompatibility, weights and measures, recess appointments, original jurisdiction, natural-born citizens, the Twenty-First Amendment, letters of marque and reprisal, titles of nobility, bills of attainder, and the Third Amendment. This book, like much of Wexler's work, seeks to educate and entertain, and while some enjoy this \\"fresh vantage point,\\" others find it distracting. Wexler also authored a blog called Odd Clauses Watch with news about other odd clauses that did not make the book. Holy Hullabaloos: A Road Trip to the Battlegrounds of the Church/State Wars (2009) In this book, Wexler details his journey to the sites of recent separation of church and state judicial opinions. Humor publications In addition to studying which justices are funny, Wexler has authored numerous humor pieces. His first foray into humor publishing explained how it is possible to get 100% of one's daily recommended allowance of vitamins and minerals by eating mass quantities of junk food. Wexler frequently writes about the Supreme Court of the United States, including his clerkship with Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg and alternate reality confirmation hearings for the justices. Wexler also writes about legal oddities, including how legislation limits Woodsy the Owl's effectiveness.

After showing promise when winning his only start as a two-year-old he progressed in the following spring, following a win in a minor race by taking the Heron Stakes and then recording his biggest win in the St James's Palace Stakes. He finished unplaced in his three subsequent starts that year. Background Without Parole is a bay horse with a white star bred in England by the Kentucky-based John D. Gunther, best known as the breeder of Justify. In October 2016 the yearling was offered for sale at Tattersalls but failed to reach his reserve price of 650,000 guineas. The colt was sent into training with John Gosden at Newmarket, Suffolk and competed in the ownership of Gunther and his daughter Tanya. He was from the second crop of foals sired by Frankel, an undefeated racehorse whose other progeny have included Cracksman and Soul Stirring. Without Parole's dam Without You Babe never raced but became a very successful broodmare who also produced Tamarkuz. She was a female-line descendant of Equal Venture, a full-sister to Assault. Racing career 2017: two-year-old season Without Parole made his racecourse debut when he started the 8/13 favourite for a minor race over one mile on the synthetic Tapeta track at Newcastle Racecourse on 16 December. Ridden by Robert Havlin he took the lead approaching the final furlong and accelerated away from his six opponent to win by six lengths. 2018: three-year-old season Plans to train Without Parole for the 2000 Guineas were abandoned after he developed a foot abscess in early spring. On his first appearance of 2018 Without Parole was partnered by Frankie Dettori in a minor event over a mile at Yarmouth Racecourse on 24 April and was made the 4/9 favourite in an eleven-runner field. He went to the front a furlong out and drew away to win by six lengths from Ostilio, a colt who went on to win the Britannia Stakes and the Prix Daniel Wildenstein. A month later, with Dettori again in the saddle, the colt was stepped up in class to contest the Listed Heron Stakes at Sandown Park and was made the 6/4 favourite with the best of his seven rivals appearing to be Gabr and Stephensons Rocket. After tracking the leaders he made progress in the straight, gained the advantage in the closing stages and held off the challenge of Gabr by three quarters of a length. The Group 1 St James's Palace Stakes at Royal Ascot on 19 June attracted a field of ten three-year-old colts and saw Without Parole head the betting on 9/4. His opponents included U S Navy Flag, Tip Two Win (runner-up in the 2000 Guineas), Romanised (Irish 2,000 Guineas), Gustav Klimt (Superlative Stakes), Wootton (Prix de Fontainebleau) and Gabr. Without Parole raced just behind the leaders as U S Navy Flag set the pace before moving into second place in the straight. He was sent into the lead by Dettori a furlong out, opened up a two length lead and kept on well to win by half a length from the fast-finishing Gustav Klimt. Gosden commented \\"Without Parole is a grand horse. There were no hiding places in that race. It was proper, proper group 1 pace. I think he is still on the up and still learning... He's so lazy at home. I've never seen a horse eat and sleep like it, which is a great, great thing in a racehorse. I think he will improve. He'll get sharper and I think he will get a little farther, too.\\" Frankie Dettori received a seven-day riding ban and a fine of £4,300 for excessive use of the whip in the closing stages. On 1 August at Goodwood Racecourse Without Parole was matched against older horses for the first time in the Sussex Stakes and was made the 7/4 favourite to continue his unbeaten run. Ridden by Andrea Atzeni he pulled his way to an early lead but faded in the straight to finish seventh of the eight runners behind Lightning Spear. Three weeks later the colt was reunited with Dettori and stepped up in trip for the International Stakes over ten and a half furlongs at York Racecourse and cam home sixth in a race won by Roaring Lion. On 9 September the colt was sent to France for the Prix du Moulin at Longchamp Racecourse. He never looked likely to win and finished sixth to Recoletos, beaten two and three quarter lengths by the winner. In the 2018 World's Best Racehorse Rankings Without Parole was given a rating of 116, making him the 169th best horse in the world. 2019: four-year-old season For his first run of 2019 Without Parole was sent to the United Arab Emirates to contest the Dubai Turf over 1800 metres at Meydan Racecourse. He raced in second place before fading in the straight to finish fifth behind Almond Eye, Vivlos, Lord Glitters and Deirdre. On his return to Europe he started the 7/1 fourth choice in the betting for the Lockinge Stakes at Newbury Racecourse on 18 May but after racing in mid-division he appeared to lose his action and dropped away rapidly and finished tailed off last of the fourteen runners. In the autumn of 2019 Without Parole was transferred to the stable of Chad C. Brown to pursue his track career in the United States. He made his debut for his new trainer in the Breeders' Cup Mile at Santa Anita Park on 2 November when he was ridden by Irad Ortiz Jr.. After being restrained towards the rear of the thirteen-runner field he produce a strong late run on the outside to finish third behind Uni and Got Stormy.

In 1976, he graduated from the Moscow Aviation Institute. In the 1970s and 1980s, he worked at the Moscow Machine- Building Plant Znamya Truda, as well as at the All-Russian Research Institute of Physico-Technical and Radio Engineering Measurements. In 1994–1998, he was the general director of JSC Petro Trade. From 1998, he held positions at Rosneft OJSC (First Vice-President and Advisor, until 2006). In 2000, he became the founder of Energo Impex (later renamed Highlander International Trading to hide traces of activity). The company was engaged in the resale of oil and oil products from the resources of Rosneft and the legalization of the profits. In 2005, Loktionov became a minority co-owner of CJSC Naftatrans. Subsequently, Anatoly Loktionov claimed that Naftatrans had been taken from him. However, he was never listed in the share register of Naftatrans, and until 2006, he worked for the state-owned company Rosneft, and therefore was not entitled to engage in entrepreneurial activity personally or even through authorized representatives, or participate in the management of an economic entity, which is clearly regulated legal acts.Анатолий Локтионов In May 2010, Nanase Limited bought from Anatoly Loktionov a 99% stake in the Panamanian company Erin Resources SA, which, in turn, is the beneficiary of a 30% stake in the Cyprus company Glydfern Limited, which owns ZAO Naftatrans. Loktionov hired Nanase Limited, represented by Litvak, to acquire a stake from his partners in Rayhill, as well as in Glidefern; gaining control of Naftatrans through the appointment of a Director General; Loktionov exercise of their right to vote; achieve the sale of Erin shares to your partners or to a third party. \\" According to the hearings in the English court, Anatoly Loktionov set as his goal either to take full control of Naftatrans, or to sell his stake to a third party as expensive as possible.

But Nanase Limited failed to cope with the task and Loktionov began litigation with this structure. \\"Loktionov's cooperation with Nanase Limited led to the fact that in 2010 a criminal case was initiated against Loktionov under Part 4 of Art. 159 and Part 3 of Art. 30 of the Criminal Code. This was a failed attempt on the part of Loktionov to carry out a raider seizure of 100% of the shares of \\"Naftatrans\\" through the imposition of an arrest on the basis of a fake surety contract, the lawsuit on which was filed in the Khamovnichesky Court of Moscow. In November 2010, Loktionov filed a lawsuit against a private collector from Russia demanding to recover 10 million euros from him for disrupting sales of 16th century paintings.Бывший вице-президент «Роснефти» требует возмещения убытков за Рубенса и Тициана After litigation of Loktionov, he tried to make a raider seizure of the Europark shopping center, which, ultimately, was sold to Samvel Karapetyan.

According to some estimates, the amount of theft from Russia due to the price difference was about $1 billion. Personal wealth Loktionova, according to various estimates, not less than 700 million dollars. At the same time, according to officially filed tax returns, Loktionov's income amounted to $2.5 million. According to media reports, the cost of Loktionov's mansion on Rublevka is $100 million, and the total value of foreign and Russian real estate is $450 million. Sales of gasoline by Highlander International Trading provoked losses at Rosneft: * 1 million 194 thousand US dollars in 2002; * 4 million 711 thousand US dollars in 2003; * 10 million US dollars in 2005.Ущерб компании «Роснефть» от махинаций Анатолия Локтионова  Stock repurchase  It is reported that Loktionov stole from the company Rosneft cash in the amount of 280 million US dollars. He applied a stock repurchase system. Having initially acquired Rosneft shares through Sintez for $20 million, he transferred them to his other organization, Highlander International Trading. After that, he sold the shares back to Rosneft for $300 million.  Tender at the Komsomolsk Refinery  When the Komsomolsk refinery owned by Rosneft was loaded, the company periodically purchased resources from third-party producers in volumes up to 150 thousand tons of oil per month. At the same time, Anatoly Loktionov arranged a \\"tender\\": $10 from each ton of oil was personally in his hands to get a contract. Thus, the monthly income of Anatoly Loktionov in this scheme probably reached $1.5 million or $18 million annually.  Criminal proceedings  In 2011, he became the defendant in a criminal case on a knowingly false denunciation (part 2 of article 306 of the Criminal Code of the Russian Federation), in 2012 the Tagansky district court elected a preventive measure in the form of taking into custody.Совладелец ЗАО «Нафтатранс» Анатолий Локтионов «заочно» освобожден от ареста In connection with this case, Loktionov was forced to hide outside the Russian Federation, and in 2014 he demanded to transfer a new passport to him, submitting an application to the Khamovnichesky Court of Moscow.Сбежавший в Лондон бизнесмен требует отправить ему новый загранпаспорт In 2015, Loktionov became a defendant in yet another criminal case on fraud on a large scale (part 4 of Article 159 of the Criminal Code of the Russian Federation).В Россию вернулся включенный в «список Титова» бывший топ-менеджер «Роснефти» The case was opened by the Investigation Department of the Ministry of Internal Affairs for Krasnodar in 2015 against the employees of the Stroyklass company, who stole 6.65 million rubles from the shareholder of the DB Development development company Dmitry Garkusha. According to investigators, Dmitry Garkusha, suffered a total damage of 101.6 million rubles.Бывшего топ-менеджера «Роснефти» обвиняют в мошенничестве Dmitry Garkusha invested money in the construction of the residential complex \\"High Coast\\" in Anapa. He also owned 20% of Stroyklass LLC, controlled by Loktionov, and in 2008 allocated $4 million and 6.65 million Russian rubles for the construction of Vysokoy Bereg. The construction of the LCD was frozen. As a result, in order to settle the obligations, the parties concluded an agreement on the joint sale of the project. Loktionov received the right to negotiate the sale of a 100% stake in Stroyklass, but he did not find a buyer, as a result of which neither his share in Stroyklass nor money was returned. In 2013, Loktionova was put on the federal wanted list. In 2016, he was already on the international wanted list due to the fact that it became known that Anatoly Loktionov lives in London. In 2018, Loktionov admitted his guilt and agreed to cooperate with the investigation, as a result of which he was included in the \\"Titov list\\", due to which he was able to return to his homeland. On 22 November 2018, he returned to Russia from London under the guarantee of business ombudsman Boris Titov. After returning to Russia, Loktionov began to participate in investigative actions, and a commitment to appear was taken from him.Омбудсмен сформировал «список возвращенцев»СМИ России: бывший топ-менеджер «Роснефти» из «списка Титова» вернулся в Москву The return to Russia is attributed to the fact that the UK passed the Criminal Finances Act. It provides for the introduction of UWO (Unexplained Wealth Orders) – \\"Orders for wealth of unknown origin\\". This tool allows the authorities to demand from the owners of any suspicious assets worth over 50 thousand pounds sterling an explanation of their origin. Possible arrest of property if the owner can not prove the legality of the origin of their income.\\" Loktionov interested in the authorities of France and (Germany). For a fee of 2.5 million euros, they were given information about HSBC's customers. All of these clients opened bank accounts in 1990–2007, with a total of over $100 billion in deposits. German, French and Belgian prosecutors became interested in this list, suspecting that Russian citizens were hiding from paying taxes. It is noted that Anatoly Loktionov indicated to the bank as his place of residence \\"a house in the fashionable suburb of Geneva – Vandovre on Ruth de la Capit, 140. Information from the Geneva registry confirms that the land belongs to Loktionov and his wife. There is a two-storied mansion with a small artificial pond on the site near Lake Geneva.\\"Украденная нефть просочилась из Швейцарии на РублевкуАнатолий Локтионов просится в Россию  The property  Loktionov bought real estate in Russia and abroad. To the list of acquired property include: * the palace in the village of Nikolino, the total cost of $100 million; * 4 apartments in the center of Moscow in the amount of more than $70 million; * 2 country houses and nine land plots in the Moscow region; * a house on the outskirts of Geneva Vandover on the Route de la Capit; * a house in France at Cape Martin for 200 million euros; * real estate in England and Monaco. The approximate value of foreign property is estimated at approximately $173 million. According to the tax authorities of the Russian Federation, the income of Anatoly Loktionov is 396 million rubles, which is equivalent to about 8.8 million pounds sterling – 13 times less than the value of the real estate purchased by him. Before returning to Russia, Loktionov lives in the most prestigious area of Knightsbridge – the \\"golden mile\\" of London, next to Arab sheikhs and representatives of the Chinese business elite. When selling the Loktionov mansion on Rublevka in the closed cottage village of Nikolino (the second Uspenskoye highway), the concern of Moscow realtors appeared. Sotheby's International Realty International Real Estate Agency has already informed potential buyers about the price of the estate: $100 million. The total area of the estate is 2.3 thousand square meters. m., and the area of the site with all adjacent buildings – 97 acres.Анатолий Локтионов загнан в угол  References  Category:Year of birth missing (living people) Category:Living people Category:Russian businesspeople Category:Russian male criminals ","title":"Anatoly Loktionov"},{"id":"60108831","text":"Madame Petit was the most luxurious and probably the most famous brothel in the city of Barcelona. Its origins date back to the 1888 Barcelona Universal Exposition and it was at its peak around the time of World War I until the Spanish Civil War. It was located in the historic Barrio Chino area of Barcelona, at the entrance of Carrer Arc del Teatre, specifically at number 6. In the same street, Carrer Arc del Teatre, in the section to the corner of the Carrer Migdia (now Avinguda de les Drassanes), there were several brothels. The area was well known for it brothels and referred to as de quatre cantons. History The brothel opened around 1888 when the Universal Exhibition brought a lot of visitors to Barcelona. In the following year it was recorded by the Sección Especial de Higiene (Special Section of Hygiene) for its non- compliance with the regulations for bars. Many of the women there were foreign, especially French, fleeing from the First World War, because Barcelona, like the rest of Spain, was neutral during the war. There were people from all over the Port who promoted this business especially during the years that war broke out. Other prostitutes were Germans, Arabs and Poles and numbered about 100. There was one Cuban who, because of her dark colouring, had patrons queuing to see her. There is no evidence to show the existence of a \\"Madame Petit\\" the French madame who supposedly ran the brothel initially. Francisco Madrid names Josep Urgarte as running the brothel in his 1926 book Sangre en Atarazanas. Facilities The decorations of the Madame Petit brothel were luxurious and included columns with engraved nude figures and a ceiling painted with sexual motifs. There were also stained glass windows decorated with exotic dancers and other suitable subjects, which are preserved in the Barcelona City History Museum. There was also a pornographic cinema. In 1910 a restaurant was added. The brothel catered for most sexual fantasies. A Polish mother and daughter catered to those who enjoyed sado-masochism. A goat and a lamb catered for those with bestiality tendencies. Trios were also catered for. One room has a bed big enough for six people, and another contained a coffin. The brothel was known for its hygiene. Towels and bedding were changed after every client and it was the first building in the city to have bidets installed. Closure Madame Petit declined after the Civil War and eventually closed in 1956, following the law abolishing prostitution. By that time, the Madame Petit had already lost most of its former splendour. The building became a pension called \\"Pensión Los Arcos\\", which also functioned as a brothel, after the closure of Madame Petit. It was demolished in the 1990s as part of an urban regeneration scheme in El Raval. , the lot still remains empty.

The 1965 event was the first time Finland hosted the Ice Hockey World Championships. This led to an era of growth, with more indoor rinks being built in Finland. Finland later hosted the 1974 Ice Hockey World Championships, with Lindblad helping coordinate the event as well. Also in 1974, Finland won a silver medal at the 1974 World Junior Ice Hockey Championships. In his last year as president, the Finnish Elite League was founded, which later became known as Liiga. Lindblad was a member of the Finnish Olympic Committee from 1961 to 1976.

Kevin Jerome Everson (1965 - ) is an artist working in film, painting, sculpture, and photography. He was born in Mansfield, Ohio and currently resides in Virginia. He holds an MFA from Ohio University, and a BFA from the University of Akron, and is Professor of Art at the University of Virginia, Charlottesville. Everson's films frequently depict people working and living in working-class communities. Many of his works focus on the migration of African American communities and individuals from the American South northward in search of work. \\"Everson rejects the role of cultural explainer in his work, opting instead to place the burden of understanding on the audience and its own labor. In this way, he has carved a place for himself outside both the typical expectations of documentary and the conventions of representational fiction, attempting to work from the materials of the worlds he encounters to create something else.\\" Everson frequently employs hand-held camerawork and uses 16mm to create many of his films. His work has been the subject of retrospective screenings at Media City Film Festival (2011), Tate Modern (2017), online at Mubi (2018), and Cinéma du Réel at the Centre Pompidou (2019)  Full-Length Films  Everson has directed nearly a dozen feature-length films. Erie, filmed during his residency at Hallwell's, Buffalo in 2009 consists of a series of single take 16mm shots in and around communities near Lake Erie, including Niagara Falls, Buffalo, Cleveland and Mansfield, Ohio (Everson's hometown). The scenes \\"relate to Black migration from the South to the North, realities affecting workers and factories in the automobile industry; contemporary conditions, theater, and famous art objects\\". Erie was screened as Media City Film Festival's Opening Night feature in Detroit, Michigan in 2010 and won the Grand Prize at Images Festival that same year. Everson's film The Island of St. Matthews debuted at the 2013 International Film Festival Rotterdam. It features recollections of the 1973 flood of the Tombigbee River in Mississippi, told by residents of Westport, a community just west of Columbus, Mississippi. Tonsler Park (2017), filmed in black and white, documents four Charlottesville, Virginia polling stations over the course of the US Presidential Election Day in 2016. The film captures the democratic process, most notably in the African-American area surrounding the Tonsler Park polling place. The film takes on additional significance in the wake of the election's outcome (which was a shock to many), as well as in the wake of the violence resulting from the Unite the Right rally in Charlottesville in 2017.  Short Films  Everson has created well over 100 short films, including Grand Finale which was featured on Vdrome in January 2018 and It Seems to Hang On exhibited as part of Sonic Rebellion: Music As Resistance organized by the Museum of Contemporary Art Detroit. A partial filmography can be found at Picture Palace Pictures, including works made in collaboration with author and historian Claudrena N. Harold, professor of African American and African Studies and History at the University of Virginia.  Exhibitions  Everson's films have been the subject of mid-career retrospectives at the Modern and Contemporary Art Museum, Seoul, Korea (February 2017); Viennale (2014); Visions du Reel, Nyon, Switzerland (2012), The Whitney Museum of American Art, NY and Media City Film Festival (2011) and Centre Pompidou, Paris in 2009. His work has been featured at the 2008, 2012, and 2017 Whitney Biennials, the 2010, 2011, 2013, 2014, 2015, 2016, 2017, and 2018 Media City Film Festivals, and the 2013 Sharjah Biennial.

Expeditionary energy economics (e3) is an emerging field of energy economics that addresses energy management in the military expeditionary environment or as part of the disaster response stage of the emergency management cycle. The term was first introduced in 2018 in an article by U.S. Army Major Ion A. Iftimie, a research fellow within the Strategic Analysis Department of the NATO Energy Security Center of excellence in Vilnius, Lithuania. Major Iftimie proposed that the successful megacity counterinsurgency (COIN) campaigns of the twenty-first century will depend on fast solutions to critical energy infrastructure (CEI) vulnerabilities within individual communities. 50px Material was copied from this source, which is available under a Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International License. The practice of energy management in the military expeditionary environment (EMMEE) is not new. The US Marine Corps has an Expeditionary Energy Office, and NATO uses the new field to test the applicability and value of a draft military adaptation of ISO 50001:2011 (Energy management systems – Requirements with guidance for use).COE Catalogue. (December 2018). Supreme Allied Commander Transformation: Norfolk, Virginia.https://www.act.nato.int/images/stories/structure/coe_catalogue_20190118.pdf Accessed 1 Mar 2019. The successful implementation of e3 theory requires that COIN practitioners have a basic understanding of CEI. Iftimie proves his hypothesis with personal vignettes from his time as an infantry platoon leader during the Iraq War troop surge of 2007. In Baghdad, before the 2007 surge, the unreliability of CEI created a safe haven and power base for insurgents.Haass, R (2010). Summary of the summit on entrepreneurship and expeditionary economics. Kansas City: Ewing Marion Kauffman Foundation http://www.cgscfoundation.org/wp-content/uploads/2011/01/EEESpecial-Report.pdf . Accessed 1 Mar 2019. During the surge, however, the effects of military units promoting community based economics (CBE) and high-risk/high-impact innovation (HRH2I) as a solution to local energy supply shortages on Haifa Street were a significant increase in the standard of living, a decrease in ethno-sectarian violence, and an increase in support for the Coalition Forces. The Haifa Street case study shows that one of the most vital elements of successful megacity COIN is facilitating rapid access of the urban community to affordable and reliable energy sources—which is a matter of managing both security of CEI and security of supply.  The role of economics and energy security in megacity COIN strategies  David Galula—the father of counterinsurgency theory—defined an insurgency as \\"a protracted struggle conducted methodically, step by step, in order to attain specific intermediate objectives leading finally to the overthrow of the existing order\\". A COIN campaign is then \\"the set of political, economic, social, military, law enforcement, civil and psychological activities with the aim to defeat insurgency and address any core grievances\\".AJP-3.4.4 (2011). Allied joint doctrine for counterinsurgency (COIN). Brussels: North Atlantic Treaty Organization. NATO Standardization Agency (NSA). The study of economic principles during COIN or disaster relief is referred as expeditionary economics. The extant understanding of expeditionary economics treats the planning and execution of state building by the military as a \\"three-legged strategy of invasion, stabilization or pacification, and economic reconstruction,\\" which is \\"the ultimate objective of counterinsurgency (COIN) campaigns\\".Schramm, CJ. (2010). Expeditionary economics: Spurring growth after conflicts and disasters. Foreign Affairs, 89(3), 89–99. This is in line with NATO's preferred COIN operational approach—Clear, Hold, and Build (CHB)—which “encompasses offensive, defensive, stability and enabling activities”. This map shows the global distribution of top 400 \\"urban areas\\" with at least 1,000,000 inhabitants in 2006. The NATO doctrine states that \\"the effective ‘offensive’ operation in COIN is one that takes from the insurgent what he cannot afford to lose—control of the population. ... Protecting the people is the mission. The conflict will be won by persuading the population, not by destroying the enemy\\".McChrystal, SA (2009). ISAF commander's counterinsurgency guidance.

Mál og menning ('language and culture') is an Icelandic publishing house, established in 1937. The press has published the work of many of Iceland's best known authors, among them Þórbergur Þórðarson, Jóhannes úr Kötlum, Svava Jakobsdóttir, Þórarinn Eldjárn, and Einar Kárason. As of 2007 its books are published by the publishing house Forlagið, of which Mál og menning is a controlling shareholder.  Origins  The publishing company Mál og menning was established on 17 June 1937, combining the press Heimskringla, which Kristinn E. Andrésson had founded in 1934, Ragnar í Smára's company Smári og fleirum, and the Félag byltingarsinnaðra rithöfunda (the Society of Revolutionary Authors, which included amongst others Kristinn E. Andrésson himself, Halldór Laxness, Steinn Steinarr, Jóhannes úr Kötlum and Halldór Stefánsson). Mál og menning was originally a book club, to which people paid a subscription in order to receive books in the post. The first seven years saw the number of subscribers growing beyond 6,000. But the company soon began publishing its own books, with the objective of making good quality literature available at a low price. The first books it published were Vatnajökull by Niels Nielsen and the third volume of the journal Rauðir pennar, which the Félag byltingarsinnaðra rithöfunda had been publishing since 1935. Its first novel, published in 1938, was Móðirin by Maxim Gorky. In the early years, both translated and Icelandic works were published, but relatively few of these books were by contemporary writers. In 1944 Kristinn Andrésson sold Heimskringla to Mál og menning, but Ragnar established the new press Helgafell. Halldór Laxness and Þórbergur Þórðarson followed Ragnar, though Halldór continued to sit on the board of Mál og menning. Post-war period Kristinn E. Andrésson served as the chairman of Mál og menning from its founding to 1971, and was influential on the press throughout that period. He was succeeded by Sigfús Daðason, who led the company until 1973, when he became editorial director and Þröstur Ólafsson became the chairman. Þorleifur Hauksson was editorial director 1976-1982, succeeded by Þuríður Baxter. In 1980, Þröstur was succeeded as chairman by Ólafur Ólafsson and Ólöf Eldjárn. 1984 saw a new generation taking over, with Halldór Guðmundsson becoming editorial director and Árni Einarsson the chairman. The two saw Mál og menning becoming Iceland's biggest publisher. The company was long associated with Icelandic socialism and was thought to have been subsidised by the Soviet Union during the Cold War.http://www.mbl.is/mm/gagnasafn/grein.html?grein_id=90515 from 1970 the press was based in a building at Laugavegur 18, in a building that was often nicknamed 'Rúblan' ('the rouble').  The twenty-first century  On 30 June 2000, the press Mál og menning merged with Vaka-Helgafell to create Edda - miðlun og útgáfa. The new company moved into a large building on Suðurlandsbraut. The books continued, however, to be published under the separate imprints Mál og menning and Vaka-Helgafell. In 2002, as Edda faced difficulties, Björgólfur Guðmundsson and others bought into the company, gaining significant influence. In 2007 the publishing arm of Edda was sold back to the holding company of Mál and menning, and on 1 October 2007 Mál og menning, Vaka-Helgafell, JPV, and the press Iðunn, which Edda had bought some years before, merged under the name Forlagið. Books continued to be published under the imprints of Mál og menning and the other companies. The current editorial director of Mál og menning is Silja Aðalsteinsdóttir. Journal: Tímarit Máls og menningar In 1938, the press also established a journal, Tímarit Máls og menningar. The current editor is Guðmundur Andri Thorsson. Bookshops In 1940, the company also established a bookshop, Bókabúð Máls og menningar, on Reykjavík's main street, Laugavegur. It swiftly became one of Iceland's main bookshops. Later a number of branches of the shop were also founded, the biggest being at Síðumúli. The bookshop remained in possession of the publishing house until 2003, when the shops were sold to Pennan/Eymundsson. The iconic Laugavegur branch retained the name Bókabúð Máls og menningar until summer 2009, when it moved to Skólavörðustígur. Soon after, however, a new bookshop opened at Laugavegur 18 under the name Bókabúð Máls og menningar. This establishment is, however, unconnected with the publishing house.

Origins The Continentals were created in 1961 by ABCs (American Born Chinese) high school students for self preservation to protect Chinese students from attacks from other ethnic groups, such as Puerto Ricans, Italians and African Americans. One example was when African American Gangs from the Smith Projects where one continental remembers when he used to pass by they would throw dirty diapers out the window and call him Chinaman. The Continentals were the first ABCs (American Born Chinese) gang created in Chinatown Manhattan. In the early sixties several \\"juk tuk\\" clubs began to appear. Foremost were the Continentals, a bunch who spent a good deal of time looking into the mirror, practicing complex handshakes. The gang got their name from ripping of insignia from Lincoln Continentals cars. Criminal history Prior to immigration law in 1965 the only active Chinese street gang were The Continentals. There crimes were mostly non violent mostly vandalism but never had a reputation of violent crimes and not having a money making purpose. Membership The Continentals were a large gang with up to 100 members. After some time they had trouble recruiting because of the small number of native-born Chinese, where as new gangs such as the White Eagles and Chung Yee were able to recruit new members such as immigrants from Hong Kong and mainland China. Legacy The Continentals will be remembered as members that as a gang that did have a relationship of non violence to the community as compared to the gangs that followed. For example, one ex member became a Chinatown social worker who used to be a former continental to try and make a truce with the Chinatown gangs so they could get a government grant who tried to give up their evil ways and get decent jobs which happened to be a scam to con the Federal government in grant money. The Continentals inability to ingrate with a tong also diminished its status within the community leaving the gang active for only 3 years. They will remembered has being created to combat other ethnic gangs and racism of their time. In the late sixties with the 1965 immigration law new gangs started to merge in Chinatown succeeding the legacy left behind by the Continentals and known for less violence in comparison to the new gangs that were to come like the Ghost Shadows and Flying Dragons that were extremely more violent and had the principal objective of racketeering.

It was subsequently published in the US by George Braziller in 1975. A poignant story of a resourceful Nigerian woman who overcomes strict tribal domination of women and countless setbacks to achieve an independent life for herself and her children, the novel is often described as semi-autobiographical, with the journey from Nigeria to London following closely Emecheta’s own trajectory as an author.Umeh, Marie. \\"Buchi Emecheta\\". In Pushpa Naidu Parekh and Siga Fatima Jagne (eds), Postcolonial African Writers: A Bio-Bibliographical Critical Sourcebook, Westport, Conn.: Greenwood Press, 1998. Plot summary At the beginning of the novel, Adah is a child of an Ibo from Ibuza, Nigeria, living in Lagos. She dreams as a young girl of moving to the United Kingdom. After her father dies, Adah is sent to live with her uncle's family. She is able to stay in school in Nigeria and attains employment working for the British embassy as a library clerk. The compensation from this job is enough to make her a desirable bride to Francis (her now husband) and in-laws. Francis travels to the United Kingdom for several years to pursue the study of law. Adah convinces her husband's family that she and the children also belong in the UK. Francis believes they are second-class citizens in the United Kingdom as they are not citizens of the country. Adah finds employment working for another library and pays for their expenses, while also providing primary care for their children. Later, we see Francis become increasingly abusive and dismissive of Adah as she pursues becoming a writer.

Services at Rhos were conducted in the Welsh language. Early history There is evidence of Baptist activity in the locality from the early nineteenth century when a small number of families with Baptist affiliations moved to the area and became members at Calfaria, Aberdare. In 1840 a small chapel named Nazareth was built, with opening services being held on 1 July 1841. The cause appears to have struggled in the 1840s, but in 1849 Thomas Price, the minister of Calfaria, Aberdare, took on the ministry and baptised a number of new members. By 1853 the chapel was found to be too small and a new buildings erected by Richard Mathias at a cost of £487. Opening services, at which Thomas Price presided, were held in November of that year. The church was now in a position to call minister of its own, and with Price's blessing, a call was issued to Rev. William Williams of Lisvane who was inducted in April 1855. Williams remained the minister at Rhos until 1891. Early in Williams's ministry the buildings at Nazareth were once again judged to be too small, in the wake of the 1859 Religious Revival, therefore Rhos was built at a cost of £1800 and opened on 6 and 7 October 1861. Nazareth then became home to an English language congregation. Rhos was the largest chapel in Mountain Ash. It was the mother church of Jerusalem, Penrhiwceiber and Ffrwd, Mountain Ash. William Williams remained minister until 1891. T.T. Hughes was minister from 1893 until 1906. In 1899 the membership stood at 447. Twentieth Century R.S. Rogers was then inducted as minister in 1908. Thomas Edmunds, a member at Rhos, was President of the Welsh Baptist Union in 1913. Rogers was succeeded by T.J. Hughes (1917-19) and Daniel Jones from 1920 until 1948. Later history The annual meetings of the Baptist Union of Wales were held at Rhos in 1947, shortly before the end of Daniel jones's long ministry. R.S. Rogers, Capel Gomer, Swansea, the former minister at Rhos, delivered his presidential address as chair of the Union. B.J. Jones was minister from 1950 until 1955 and was succeeded by J. Dudley Morgan in 1959. Rhos was one of the first chapels in the Aberdare Valley to close in 1973. The chapel was demolished in 1975. Prior to demolition, the organ was transferred to Gwawr, Aberaman.

Its larvae are generalist feeders, boring into the wood of a wide variety of trees, native and introduced. When citrus orchards were first established in New Zealand, this beetle started inflicting serious damage, and so gained the name \\"lemon tree borer\\". Four species within the genus Oemona have been identified, suggesting that more species could be found. When disturbed by predators or humans, the adult beetle stridulates creating a \\"rasp\\" or \\"squeak\\" sound by rubbing its thorax and head together against an area of thin ridges. Māori would eat a liquid called \\"pia manuka\\", which was produced by manuka trees when its wood was damaged by the larva. When Captain Cook first arrived in NZ, his naturalists, Banks and Solander, collected a lemon tree borer in their first collection between 1769-1771. This oldest collected specimen can be found in the British Museum. A few years after the first collection, the species would be first described by the Danish naturalist Fabricius in 1775. Description Lemon tree borer, showing the distinctive parallel ridges on the thorax Adults: The lemon tree borer is a plain looking, medium to large sized beetle, reaching long. It has a slender body with elongated antennae. Antennae are usually the same length as or longer than the body, and able to sit in front of, or curve backwards against the body. Adults can vary from red-brown to almost black in colour, with patches of pale yellow hairs on the head and scutellum, which is a small spot on their back where the thorax joins the elytra (hard wing cases). Females are larger and heavier than males, but have proportionally shorter antennae, but the sex can only be reliably determined by looking at the genitalia using a microscope. A distinctive feature of O. hirta is the transverse wrinkling on the dorsal surface of the pronotum; this is especially distinctive on males. Eggs: White and large (2.0-2.2mm) with a fine waxy surface pattern, they are laid singly in leaf or stem junctions, pruning and cicada scars, damaged bark or dead twigs on the outer edge of trees. Larvae: Their skin is white to pale cream with orange to brown gut contents, growing 25-40mm long. Body is cylindrical with each thoracic and abdominal segment having a swollen transverse ridge; an enlarged head holds gouge-like mandibles (biting jaws) which are large but short and dark brown to black. Many minute rigid brown hairs line the lateral margins, especially towards the head. When disturbed, larvae are able to move surprisingly fast due to dorsal and ventral muscle ridges gripping its surroundings. Pupae: Approximately 20-25mm long. Pupa are a pale reddish clay colour with darker shades on the wing cases. The pupa chamber is a short length of larval tunnel with tightly packed wood shaving plugs at each end. The beetle shape is more obvious in the pupal stage, showing long antennae folded adjacent to the body and larger legs bended in. While the individual is pupating, it can twist around the chamber using small black spines on its abdomen. Life cycle  Lemon tree borers have a long life cycle, averaging around two years, with the majority of their life spent as larvae. Eggs are singly laid between September and January and hatch in as little as a few days to two weeks, with most hatching between 9–13 days. Once hatched larvae immediately start tunnelling into the wood, going first into sapwood and then heartwood to around 10-20mm deep. Larvae occur in low density, with usually only two being present per tree. They eat the wood, creating long tunnels with side galleries and holes for excretion of frass and aeration to discourage fungal growth. They bore longitudinally into the stems, going towards the main stem or branch. Occasionally larvae will bore around a branch, causing girdling. Lemon tree borers can sometimes be found in dead trees, but prefer living trees as they require a certain level of humidity and nutrition to properly pupate to adulthood. The larval stage can last for one to two years, depending on the environment: larvae occurring in milder environments with a shorter winter period will pupate faster. Larvae achieve modest growth over their first summer reaching around 15mm and mine approximately 150mm. The larvae slow in activity over the winter months but increase substantially around October when temperatures become warmer. Increased frass occurs in their second summer as larvae reach full size. The pupal stage lasts between 2–3 weeks but can take up to several weeks, and begins late May to early November with larvae creating a small chamber within their tunnel. Adults emerge early spring to late summer with the majority emerging October to December. Newly emerged adults will remain in their pupal cells until their integument has hardened. Once they emerge, they become sexually mature around four days later (although this varies depending on environmental conditions). Adults feed on pollen and nectar of plants. They are mostly nocturnal, foraging and mating at night. During the day, they hide amongst vegetation. Adults may live for around 2 months but often die after reproduction.  Mating behaviour  Adults reach sexual maturity approximately 3–4 days after emergence, but usually take around 10 days before being able to reproduce. Oemona hirta, like other cerambycid beetles, don’t produce sex pheromones to attract a potential mate over long distance; instead they tend to meet at oviposition locations where mating occurs. Mating usually occurs at night with males having been observed to wander in search of a mate and stumble across a female more than actively locate a mate. Pre-mounting courtship displays appear to not occur and males quickly mount the females after coming into contact with them. Lemon tree borer have a comparatively long mating period with potential multiple mating sessions occurring. However, the final mating appears to take the longest, with total mating taking around 50 minutes. Majority of males conduct mate-guarding as post-mating behaviour for approximately 20 minutes after mating by staying on the back of the female or remaining close by to ensure his sperm alone will father their off-spring. Whenever the female is unresponsive, trying to move away from the male’s advances, he would nip the female’s antennae of lick the front of her thorax or elytra. The female would then calm down and raise her abdomen up again for him to continue. This is falls in the middle of mating behaviours of other longhorn species where the male will either mate with the female for a few hours without post-mating and guarding, or mate for a few minutes then leave to allow other males to mate with her. Once the male withdraws the female has been observed to remain stationary for a short period of time before starting oviposition alone. Females lay eggs in cracks or wounds in bark or on branches including fresh pruning cuts. Females can produce over 50 eggs in their life span and lay only around 66% of eggs produced. Habitat and distribution alt= Family distribution - Oemona hirta belong to a large family of longhorn beetles, called Cerambycidae. Worldwide, the group contains over 33,000 species , within NZ there could be around 200-300 species. The longhorn family have significant impacts to the economy, these impacts are mainly due to the larva’s ability to process and damage hard wood with their specialised mandibles. This makes them high on international security threat lists as new introductions from accidental imports would result in devastating loss to timber and horticultural industries. Global range - Oemona hirta is endemic to New Zealand (NZ) and has not established overseas, but there have been a few close occasions. This includes individuals being identified in the UK by Food & Environment Research Agency in 1983, and again in 2010. The latest specimen was found in an imported wisteria plant from NZ and classified as a devastating pest for the agricultural industry, if it were to settle. New Zealand range - Within NZ, lemon tree borers are native and the most commonly found longhorn beetle in NZ. Until recently, it was assumed that they were widespread throughout New Zealand, but they are mainly located in the North Island, and the North-West Nelson region of the South Island (Crowe, A. 2015; Lindsey & Morris, 2013). It has been collected from sea level up to altitudes of over , as well as several offshore islands such as Kapiti Island and Mokopuna Island. Like most other longhorn beetles, their good flying ability allows them to colonise favourable habitat, and spread far and wide. The beetles mainly fly in the early morning and evening when most mating occurs.  Diet  Like their name suggests, this species larvae prefer to eat living vascular tissue of citrus trees, but they are not specialised to citrus. Prior to European settlers introducing exotic plants and cultivated trees over 150 years ago, premature specimen lived in native trees. Now they are a highly polyphagous species invading native and introduced host trees and vines totalling over 200 species from 81 families. This shows how adaptable the species can be, indicating that they will be in NZ for many years to come. This creates a nuisance to cultivated orchards and tree nurseries in the North Island who can frequently be invaded. Adults can be found in orchards, and gardens feeding on plants too, but are far less destructive than the larvae, instead consuming pollen and nectar of native and exotic flowers.  Common host plants  Exotic - Citrus, lemon, orange, tangelos, grape, apple, gooseberry, tamarillo, cherry, fig, peach, pomegranate, plum, blueberry, persimmon, camellia, elm, wisteria, willow, hakea, poplar, tree lucerne, almond, walnut, chestnut, and macadamia. Gorse is also one of the hosts that they’re known to target providing one of the few benefits to controlling the weed in NZ. Native - Kowhai, rangiora, mahoe, tauhinu, tarata, Coprosma rotundifolia, and manuka. Agricultural pest This species is of great economic importance and has become an agricultural pest due to the broad host diet and habit of the larvae, which bore into a wide range of host trees, both native and exotic. Some important crop species are lemon (Citrus spp.), apple (Malus spp.), almond (Amygdalus spp.), chestnut (Castanea sativa and C. crenata), persimmon (Diospyros kaki), cherry (Prunus spp.), walnut (Juglans regia), and grape (Vitis vinifera). This has made them a substantial commercial and biosecurity pest as their potential for wide spread crop damage both in New Zealand and overseas is high. As such, quarantine regulations have to be observed when exporting these crops overseas to reduce the risk of O. hirta being accidentally introduced, as they would be able to establish quickly. O. hirta is a threat to the forestry industry, commercial fruit crops, and ornamental garden shrubs. This beetle can be accidentally introduced by movement of plants for planting. It was first intercepted in the United Kingdom in 1983 and again in 2010 on Wisteria plants at two different plant nurseries.  Plant symptoms -  The first symptom of an infestation by larvae is the wilting of foliage and dieback, but this may not always be apparent immediately. Trees will have excretion holes measuring , with frass visible on the outside. As the larva tunnels through the living branches of young hardwood trees and vines, the stems weaken, dry and break. This reduces the plants health rapidly, or even killing the tree over time if there is a manifestation. Boring through the stem interrupts the sap flow which results in die-back in the late summer. It can also make the host susceptible to fungal infection from weakened stems and holes created by the larva.  Control of Oemona hirta  Lemon tree borers are notoriously hard to control. Larvae are not easily seen as they live deep in the wood making their natural behaviour hard to observe and creating difficulty for people to control them as a pest. Physical control can be done by removal of infested wood, but this is very labour intensive. The usual way of dealing with insect pests is to spray chemicals, this may be effective for the adults, however this is time- consuming and ineffective as the larva are internally hidden. In New Zealand, the best way to control the lemon tree borer is through preventive and curative methods. To reduce infestations, plants affected need to be regularly pruned, with the offcuts removed and burned. However, this shouldn’t be done when females are laying eggs as it will create more suitable places for larva to infect, so painting the ends of trimmed branches can be used to discourage reinfection. Another thing that can make Oemona hirta more difficult to remove it that larvae can continue maturing to adulthood in pruned twigs/branches on the ground. However, the required conditions for survival would be that they were at an old enough stage that they could continue eating before the water and nutrients decay. Ways to enhance biocontrol are being investigated, although it is hard as the stems they live in protect them from most predators. However, their natural predator, the native parasitoid wasps are being investigated. Predators and disease Lemon tree borer parasite (Xanthocryptus novozealandicus)The main natural predators of lemon tree borers are solitary parasitoid wasps, two ichneumond wasp species (Xanthocryptus novozealandicus and Campoplex sp.) and one braconid wasp species (Apsicolpus hudsoni). The parasitic ichneumonid wasp Xanthocryptus novozealandicus is native to New Zealand and being researched as a potential biological control agent. The female wasps parasitise wood-boring beetles, including lemon tree borer, by injecting an egg into the larvae which then grows and consumes the slowly dying grub. Females do this by piercing through the wood with their ovipositor. X. novozealandicus prefers attacking larvae in their second year of growth. Female wasps appear to assign their offspring according to the size of the larvae, in most cases larger larvae will host female offspring and smaller larvae host male offspring. This is suggested to be due to the larger size of the adult female wasp compared to the male. On examination of the remaining larval galleries it could be seen that upon being parasitised that larvae development halts. Additionally, a parasitic fungi Cordyceps aemonae has been documented to affect larvae.

Dayton Blair, \\"A woman of the century\\" Ellen A. Dayton Blair (December 27, 1837 – 1926) was an American social reformer and art teacher. Early years and education Ellen A. Dayton was born near Vernon Center, New York, December 27, 1827. Her parents were Erastus Dayton and Adeline Lucinda Brown Dayton. She was graduated in the classical course from Fort Edward Institute, New York, in 1837. Career In the same year as her graduation, she accepted the position of preceptress in Upper Iowa University, Fayette, Iowa. She remained in that institution one year, having charge of the art department. Soon after she married Emery H. Blair, of Iowa, at one time professor of mathematics in Clinton Liberal Institute, in Clinton, Oneida County, New York. Both were strong in anti-slavery and prohibition sentiments. During the Women's Crusade, Blair discovered her ability as a temperance speaker. Loving the cause and zealous in its behalf, she worked on its behalf. Blair had five sons, three of whom were living by 1893. Young men were her special focus during the Crusade and in Sunday school work. Moving to Wisconsin in 1881, she began her illustrative talks to children, on the invitation of Mary Bannister Willard, and later was made superintendent of the juvenile department for Wisconsin. In 1885, she was elected to her position as national organizer and \\"chalk talker\\" of the juvenile department of the Woman's Christian Temperance Union (WCTU). In fulfillment of her duties, she visited nearly every State and Territory, as well as Canada, and was a member of nearly every national convention. After removing to Creighton, Nebraska, she has continued her work in the same field. During the prohibitory amendment campaign in that State, she was one of the leaders. As superintendent of the Demorest medal contests, which occupied much of her time and that of several assistants, under her supervision, Nebraska lead the world in that line of temperance work. At the Ninth Convention of the World's WCTU, held in Brooklyn, New York, October 23–28, 1913, she was a U.S. delegate from Southern California. Blair's greatest influence as a temperance worker lay in her illustrative talks, by which she interested young and old. She was a natural artist and, when not engaged in public duties, devoted herself to teaching oil painting, drawing and crayon work. She died in 1926 and is buried at Sunset Hill Cemetery in Clinton.

Reception Hal Erickson of Allmovie called the film \\"groundbreaking\\" and gave it 2.5/5 stars, writing, \\"What made this film unique (at least when it initially aired over the ABC network on April 7, 1986) is that one of Gail's amours is her late husband's business partner Ben Taylor (Barry Newman)--while the other is Gail's female best friend, Marjorie Lloyd (Lynn Redgrave).\\" He went on to call the film \\"Impeccably tasteful in its treatment of a potential volatile subject, and refreshingly honest and uncompromising at its conclusion.\\" Jeff Jarvis of People gave the film a C-, writing, \\"This movie deals with just one fact of life: bisexuality.\\" He continued, \\"Mariette and Lynn are an item, but you’d never know they’re in love from the way they act. There’s no passion between them. There’s no life anywhere in My Two Loves. In the end the movie looks like the life story of mannequins.\\" LGBT significance The films significance as an early television portrayal of a lesbian relationship is noted by Gene Elder of outinusa.com, who writes, \\"This was in January 1986, and at a time when we were still referring to ourselves as the GL community–shortly adding the B to become the GLB community. The T was to come much later.\\" The Fort Walton Beach Playground Daily News ran an article with the headline \\"Lynn Redgrave enjoys challenging roles\\" on Saturday, April 5, 1986 The News-Press of Fort Myers, Florida ran an article with the headline \\"ABC tackles once-taboo subject of bisexuality\\" on Sunday, April 6, 1986. Several newspapers ran articles about the film's subject matter. The Dayton Daily News of Dayton, Ohio ran an article with the headline \\"'My Two Loves' takes lesbianism one step further\\" on Monday, April 7, 1986. Admitting that \\"Television has generally been uneasy about lesbians,\\" John J. O'Connor of The New York Times wrote, \\"the subject of lesbianism clearly remains delicate, to say the least, for television. In 'My Two Loves,' ... a character contends that lesbians are this country's 'largest invisible minority.' Perhaps with that in mind, 'My Two Loves' approaches the subject with a measure of candor and sympathy and then, in typical television fashion, discreetly withdraws before any difficult decisions have to be made.\\" Praising Hartley and Redgrave, he wrote, \\"both actresses splendidly transcend the inhibitions of the script and production. Passion between the two women is restricted to rather tentative hugging; ecstasy seems limited to washing each other's hair. Fifteen years ago, 'That Certain Summer' looked at male homosexuals with studied tastefulness and unflagging decorum. Television has finally gotten around to doing the same for lesbians.\\" In an interview with The Washington Post about her role in the film, Lynn Redgrave said, \\"I've played a nun, a hooker, a bisexual and a saint. Why should this part be a problem?\\" When asked what it was like to play a lesbian, she said, \\"I didn't find it hard. It's fun to play people who are not like yourself.\\" Admitting that such a role could affect her career, Hartley said, \\"I think it affected my publicist more than anyone else. She had to call Celestial Seasonings Tea to tell them I was going to play a bisexual. It was a curious feeling to think I could lose my contract by playing a bisexual.\\" In the book The Prime Time Closet: A History of Gays and Lesbians on TV, author Stephen Tropiano writes, \\"Lesbianism was also presented as an option for lonely heterosexual women in search of some companionship. In the made-for-TV movie, My Two Loves, widow and single mother Gail Springer (Mariette Hartley) befriends an executive, Marjorie (Lynn Redgrave), who she later discovers is a lesbian. Gail said she had no idea because Marjorie doesn't look gay. 'We don't all wear black leather and ride a Harley Davidson,' Marjorie explains. Their relationship turns into an affair, much to the dismay of Gail's mother (Sada Thompson) and her old friend, Ben (Barry Newman), a male chauvinist who is romantically pursuing her. ... Gail Who must decide between Marjorie and Ben, chooses neither. Again, her choice seems to be between lifestyles, not individuals. Like Gail, television was still not ready to commit either way.\\" In an obituary of Lynn Redgrave for Ms., Michael Kort wrote, \\"Outside of her own scripts, Redgrave was gutsy in her choice of roles, including playing a lesbian in a happy (!) relationship with a woman in the 1986 TV film My Two Loves. As I recall, the most intimate moment in the film was a hair-washing scene, but to have any lesbian representation on television back then was an accomplishment.\\" My Two Loves is noted for its portrayal of a lesbian relationship in the article Flirting with Equality: A Feminist Social Commentary on the Opposition to Civil Equality for Lesbians and Gays by Patricia Madoo Lengermann and Jill Niebrugge in the National Women's Studies Association Journal. The Ontario Consultants on Religious Tolerance list the film as a \\"homosexual milestone\\" in the portrayal of the LGBT community in the media. Michele Kort of The Advocate called it \\"groundbreaking but coy.\\" My Two Loves is included in the list of \\"Historic LGBTQ Television Moments\\" by the Association for Lesbian, Gay, Bisexual, and Transgender Issues in Counseling of Alabama (ALGBTICAL).

His mother, Bertha Ellen Seagers, was a school principal and teacher, and his father, Orange Maull Johnson, was a realtor. Johnson received both his Bachelor of Arts and his Juris Doctorate Degrees from Howard University.https://www.washingtonpost.com/archive/lifestyle/tv/1988/05/01/charles- johnson/2ac0acb8-a265-427a-86b0-1db4bf3d6a98/ Career The Vietnam draft brought Johnson to the United States Army, stationed at Fort Dix, New Jersey. Because of his law degree, Johnson was assigned to the Courts and Boards Defense Counsel. Once his military service was completed, Johnson relocated to Washington, D.C., and joined the U.S. Copyright Office. During this period as a copyright lawyer, Johnson took various film and acting classes in his free time. He also got acting roles in local theatre and in various film/television projects. Deciding to focus on a career in entertainment, Johnson left the copyright office and moved to Los Angeles in 1971 . Once in Los Angeles, Johnson immersed himself in the Los Angeles entertainment scene. Johnson took more acting and film/television production classes. He got a position in the mail room at Universal Studios. After just two days, Johnson applied for a newly opened position and became a Production Coordinator. While in this role for a variety of television shows, Johnson caught the attention of Stephen J. Cannell and Meta Rosenberg. They were the Producers of The Rockford Files. This led to the big break that would kick-off Johnson's professional producer career: he became the show's second Associate Producer in 1974.

He represented New Zealand with distinction in their earliest matches. Personal life Bert De Maus was born in Levuka, Fiji, and educated at schools in Scotland and New Zealand before going to work at the Lyttelton Times in Christchurch. He married Helen Pirie in Christchurch in November 1892. They had a son and two daughters. He returned to Fiji around 1900, where he had a trading business. He was a fine singer and an accomplished artist. Several of his sketches were displayed in the old pavilion at Lancaster Park, Christchurch. Cricket career The New Zealand cricket historian Dick Brittenden described him thus: \\"Tall and handsome, this stylish batsman was one of the best in the country ... By instinct, Demaus [sic] was a careful, correct player\\" but able to take risks when the situation demanded.R.T. Brittenden, Great Days in New Zealand Cricket, A.H. & A.W. Reed, Wellington, 1958, p. 16. He was also a useful slow bowler. De Maus first made his mark in the 1889-90 season at the age of 18 in Canterbury's match against the touring New South Wales team, scoring 74 and 23, more runs in total than any other batsmen in the match. In Canterbury's match against Wellington at the Basin Reserve in March 1891, 31 wickets fell for 242 on the first day. De Maus, batting at number three, made 3 and 25, which was Canterbury's top score of the match. Bowling throughout Wellington's first innings, he took 7 for 48 off 14 six-ball overs. Nevertheless, Wellington won early on the second day. When New South Wales toured New Zealand in 1893-94 they were undefeated in their first three first-class matches; but when they played Canterbury, De Maus scored 113, his only first-class century, and Canterbury won by an innings. He was included in the team a few days later for New Zealand's first first-class representative match, against New South Wales in Christchurch. He made 45 in the first innings, easily New Zealand's highest score in the match, and took 4 for 33 in the second innings, but New Zealand lost heavily. He also played two years later when New Zealand played against the next New South Wales touring team. This time New Zealand won, thanks in part to De Maus's 47 in the second innings.Don Neely & Richard Payne, Men in White: The History of New Zealand International Cricket, 1894–1985, Moa, Auckland, 1986, pp. 35–38. When the cricket historian Tom Reese compiled his history of early New Zealand cricket, New Zealand Cricket, 1841–1914, in 1927, he included De Maus in his 14-man team of the best New Zealand cricketers of the period.

Completed in August 1914, she helped to sink an Italian destroyer during the Action off Vieste in May 1915 after Italy declared war on Austria-Hungary. Two months later the ship participated in an unsuccessful attempt to recapture a small island in the Central Adriatic Sea from the Italians. In November and early December Lika was one of the ships conducting raids off the Albanian coast to interdict the supply lines between Italy and Albania. The ship was sunk in Durazzo harbor during the early stages of the 1st Battle of Durazzo in late December after striking several mines.

The ships had an overall length of , a beam of , and a maximum draft of .Sieche, p. 338 They displaced at normal load and at deep load.Greger, p. 44 The ships had a complement of 105 officers and enlisted men. The Tátras were powered by two AEG-Curtiss steam turbine sets, each driving a single propeller shaft using steam provided by six Yarrow boilers. Four of the boilers were oil-fired while the remaining pair used coal. The turbines, designed to produce , were intended to give the ships a speed of . The ships carried enough oil and coal to give them a range of at . The main armament of the Tátra-class destroyers consisted of two 50-caliber Škoda Works K10 guns, one each fore and aft of the superstructure in single mounts. Their secondary armament consisted of six 45-caliber guns, two of which were on anti-aircraft mountings. They were also equipped with four torpedo tubes in two twin rotating mountings amidships.Noppen, p. 48 Construction and career Three Tátra-class destroyers on maneuvers circa 1914; Lika on the left and in the center Lika was laid down by Ganz-Danubius at their shipyard in Porto Ré in the Kingdom of Croatia-Slavonia of the Austro-Hungarian Empire on 30 April 1912, launched on 15 March 1913 and completed on 8 August 1914.Noppen, p. 44 The Tátra-class ships did not play a significant role in the minor raids and skirmishing in the Adriatic in 1914 and early 1915 between the Entente Cordiale and the Central Powers.Cernuschi & O'Hara, p. 168 Action off Vieste The Kingdom of Italy signed a secret treaty in London in late April 1915 breaking its alliance with the German Empire and Austro-Hungary and promising to declare war on the Central Powers within a month. Austro-Hungarian intelligence discovered this and Admiral Anton Haus, commander of the Austro-Hungarian Navy, planned a massive surprise attack on Italian ports and facilities on the Northern Adriatic coast, outside of interception range of the modern ships of the Royal Italian Navy stationed at Taranto. To warn of any Italian warships able to interfere with the bombardments, Haus prepositioned three groups of destroyers, each led by a scout cruiser. Placed in the Central Adriatic between the island of Pelagosa and the Italian coast, four days prior to the Italian declaration of war on 23 May, were four Tátra-class destroyers, including Lika, and the cruiser . Around midnight on the night of 23/24 May, Haus ordered the reconnaissance groups to move west and attack Italian coastal targets. About an hour later the four Tátras encountered a pair of Italian s, and , but they were believed by the Italians to be friendly ships in the darkness.Noppen, pp. 54–55; O'Hara & Heinz, pp. 153–154 The Italian ships separated when Aquilone went to investigate a sighting; Helgoland began bombarding the city of Barletta at 04:00 and the Italian destroyer spotted the cruiser at 04:38. The ship turned away to the southeast and was able to disengage without any damage. Turbine, however, encountered Helgoland several minutes later and believed that she was an Italian ship until she was disabused by a salvo from the cruiser. The destroyer turned to the north, towards Vieste, to escape, with Helgoland and the destroyer in pursuit. Alerted by Helgolands commander, (Captain) Heinrich Seitz, the destroyers and , which had been bombarding Manfredonia, moved to intercept and spotted Turbine at 05:10, opening fire at 05:45. Lika, which had been bombarding Vieste, was ordered to block her escape to the north while Helgoland stayed to the east to cut off her access to the Adriatic. Lika scored the critical hit of the battle when one of her 66-millimeter shells broke Turbines steam pipe and caused her to rapidly lose speed. Tátra and Helgoland also scored hits and Turbine was dead in the water with a list when her crew abandoned ship at 06:51. She had hit Tátra and Csepel during the engagement, but failed to inflict any significant damage. The Austro-Hungarians rescued 35 survivors before torpedoing the derelict. As they were withdrawing they were engaged by the protected cruiser and the armed merchant cruiser between 07:10 and 07:19. Helgoland was struck by one shell before they were able to disengage from the slower ships.Noppen, pp. 56–57; O'Hara & Heinz, pp. 154–155 On 28 July, all six Tátra-class ships and the scout cruisers and Helgoland, reinforced by the German submarine , attempted to recapture Pelagosa which had been occupied by the Italians on 11 July. Despite a heavy bombardment by the ships, the 108-man landing party was unable to overcome the 90-man garrison and was forced to withdraw. Three weeks later, Saida, Helgoland, Lika, Orjen and two other destroyers bombarded the island, destroying its freshwater cistern, which forced the Italians to withdraw on 18 August.Cernuschi & O'Hara, p. 169; Halpern, pp. 148–150 The Bulgarian declaration of war on Serbia on 14 October cut the existing supply line from Serbia to Salonika, Greece, and forced the Allies to begin supplying Serbia through ports in Albania. This took about a month to work out the details and the Austro-Hungarians took just about as long to decide on a response. Haus ordered Seitz to take Helgoland, Saida and all six Tátra-class destroyers on a reconnaissance mission off the Albanian coast on the night of 22/23 November. They encountered and sank a small cargo ship and a motor schooner carrying flour for Serbia; four Italian destroyers were unable to intercept them before they reached friendly territory. Haus was initially reluctant to send his ships so far south, but an order from the (High Command) on 29 November to patrol the Albanian coast and to disrupt Allied troop movements caused him to transfer Helgoland, her sister and the Tátra-class ships to Cattaro.

LR for 1820 showed Skeltons trade changing from London–Quebec to London–New South Wales. The state of the British economy in 1820 not being strong, and the demand for vessels likewise being weak, a number of shipowners sought to transport emigrants to the Cape and Australia. Captain James Dixon sailed Skelton from Leith on 19 June with 57 passengers and 17 crew. She was bound for the Cape, Hobart Town, and Port Jackson. She arrived at Table Bay on 28 September. The colony's medical officer limited the number of people that might land as she had an outbreak of measles on board. Still, three of four passengers who had booked passage to the Cape disembarked. Skelton sailed from South Africa on 14 October, and the pilot brought her into port at Hobart Town on 27 November. Dixon sailed from Hobart on 5 January 1821 and arrived in Port Jackson on 17 January. He sailed from Sydney for Hull, via Rio de Janeiro, on 10 June. Skelton was carrying 181 bales of wool, 40 tons of timber and plank, 1680 kangaroo skins, a little wattle bark, and 2800 ox horns. Skelton sailed via Cape Horn, which she reached on 3 August. She arrived at Sugarloaf Mountain and Rio on 23 August. She was the first vessel in five years to arrive at Rio from Port Jackson. Dixon and Skelton sailed from Rio on 24 September. Three days later, at a sloop and a schooner approached in a suspicious manner. They would not identify themselves and Dixon made preparations to resist if they attempted to attack Skelton, but eventually they left.

This took about a month to work out the details and the Austro-Hungarians took just about as long to decide on a response. Admiral Anton Haus, commander of the Austro-Hungarian Navy, ordered (Captain) Heinrich Seitz, Helgolands commander, to take his ship, Saida and all six Tátra-class destroyers on a reconnaissance mission off the Albanian coast on the night of 22/23 November. They encountered and sank a small cargo ship and a motor schooner carrying flour for Serbia; four Italian destroyers were unable to intercept them before they reached friendly territory.

Austro- Hungarian intelligence discovered this and Admiral Anton Haus, commander of the Austro-Hungarian Navy, planned a massive surprise attack on Italian ports and facilities on the northern Adriatic coast, outside of interception range of the modern ships of the (Royal Italian Navy) stationed at Taranto. To warn of any Italian warships able to interfere with the bombardments, Haus prepositioned three groups of destroyers, each led by a scout cruiser. Placed in the central Adriatic between the island of Pelagosa and the Italian coast, four days prior to the Italian declaration of war on 23 May, were four Tátra- class destroyers, including Orjen, and the cruiser . Around midnight on the night of 23/24 May, Haus ordered the reconnaissance groups to move west and attack Italian coastal targets. About an hour later the four Tátras encountered a pair of Italian s, and , but in the darkness they were believed by the Italians to be friendly ships.Noppen, pp. 54–55; O'Hara & Heinz, pp. 153–154 The Italian ships separated when Aquilone went to investigate a sighting; Helgoland began bombarding the city of Barletta at 04:00 and the Italian destroyer spotted the cruiser at 04:38. Aquilone turned away to the southeast and was able to disengage without any damage. Turbine, however, encountered Helgoland several minutes later and believed that she was an Italian ship until she was disabused by a salvo from the cruiser. The destroyer turned to the north, towards Vieste, to escape, with Helgoland and Orjen in pursuit. Alerted by Helgolands commander, (Captain) Heinrich Seitz, the destroyers and , which had been bombarding Manfredonia, moved to intercept and spotted Turbine at 05:10, opening fire at 05:45. The destroyer , which had been bombarding Vieste, was ordered to block her escape to the north while Helgoland stayed to the east to cut off her access to the Adriatic. Lika scored the critical hit of the battle when one of her 66-millimeter shells broke Turbines steam pipe and caused her to rapidly lose speed. Tátra and Helgoland also scored hits and Turbine was dead in the water with a list when her crew abandoned ship at 06:51. She had hit Tátra and Csepel during the engagement, but failed to inflict any significant damage. The Austro- Hungarians rescued 35 survivors before torpedoing the derelict ship. As they were withdrawing they were engaged by the protected cruiser and the armed merchant cruiser between 07:10 and 07:19. Helgoland was struck by one shell before they were able to disengage from the slower ships.Noppen, pp. 56–57; O'Hara & Heinz, pp. 154–155 On 28 July, all six Tátra-class ships and the scout cruisers and Helgoland, reinforced by the German submarine , attempted to recapture Pelagosa which had been occupied by the Italians on 11 July. Despite a heavy bombardment by the ships, the 108-man landing party was unable to overcome the 90-man garrison and was forced to withdraw. Three weeks later, Saida, Helgoland, Orjen, Lika and two other destroyers bombarded the island, destroying its freshwater cistern, which forced the Italians to withdraw on 18 August.Cernuschi & O'Hara, p. 169; Halpern, pp. 148–150 The Bulgarian declaration of war on Serbia on 14 October cut the existing supply line from Serbia to Salonika, Greece, and forced the Allies to begin supplying Serbia through ports in Albania.

En route the two sisters accidentally collided with each other and had to return to port although the cruiser continued the mission. The impact bent Orjens bow and she was under repair until 16 February.Bilzer, p. 121 The ship made unsuccessful sorties in search of Allied shipping on 23 and 26 February. On the night of 31 May/1 June 1916, Orjen and her sister , together with three torpedo boats, attacked the Otranto Barrage and sank one of the drifters maintaining it with a torpedo. On 4 July Helgoland, Orjen, Balaton and Tátra raided the barrage, but could not find any targets in the poor visibility. Orjen made another unsuccessful raid on the barrage on the night of 23/24 July. Helgoland and Novara, escorted by Orjen and Balaton, comprised one of two bombardment groups that Haus planned to bombard the Italian coast on 29 August to provoke a reaction by Allied ships that would be ambushed by waiting u-boats. The weather did not cooperate and it was too foggy to see the coast, and all the ships involved returned to harbor without incident. Orjen was refitted in Pola during 1–22 October and spent the rest of the year escorting convoys. On the night of 11/12 March 1917, Orjen, Balaton, Csepel and Tátra swept through the Strait of Otranto, but failed to sink the French cargo ship that they encountered. From 30 March to 14 May, Orjen had two of her boilers replaced and returned to Cattaro on 17 May. She participated in the unsuccessful search for the missing flying boat K222 on 11 August.Bilzer, p. 124Cernuschi & O'Hara 2015, p. 170; Cernuschi & O'Hara 2016, p. 67; Halpern 2004, p. 24; Noppen, pp. 62, 64–65; O'Hara & Heinz, p. 206 The smaller ships in the Austro-Hungarian Navy were the most active ones and their crews had the highest morale; most of the larger ships did little but swing on their moorings which did nothing to improve the morale of their crews. On 1 February, the Cattaro Mutiny broke out, starting aboard the armored cruiser . The mutineers rapidly gained control of the armored cruiser and most of the other major warships in the harbor. Unhappy with the failure of the smaller ships' crews to join the mutiny, the mutineers threatened to fire at any ship that failed to hoist a red flag. Orjens crew hoisted a flag with the permission of her captain with the proviso that there should be no disturbances aboard ship. The following day, many of the mutinous ships abandoned the effort after coast-defense guns loyal to the government opened fire on the rebel guard ship . The scout cruisers and Orjen, among other ships, took advantage of the confusion to rejoin loyalist forces in the inner harbor where they were protected by coastal artillery. The next morning, the s arrived from Pola and put down the uprising.Bilzer, p. 124; Halpern 2004b, pp. 48–50, 52–53; Sondhaus 1994, p. 322 End of the war By October it had become clear that Austria-Hungary was facing defeat in the war. With various attempts to quell nationalist sentiments failing, Emperor Karl I decided to sever Austria-Hungary's alliance with Germany and appeal to the Allies in an attempt to preserve the empire from complete collapse. On 26 October Austria- Hungary informed Germany that their alliance was over. At the same time, the Austro-Hungarian Navy was in the process of tearing itself apart along ethnic and nationalist lines. Vice Admiral Miklós Horthy was informed on the morning of 28 October that an armistice was imminent, and used this news to maintain order and prevent a mutiny among the fleet. While a mutiny was spared, tensions remained high and morale was at an all-time low.Sondhaus 1994, pp. 350–351 The following day the National Council in Zagreb announced Croatia's dynastic ties to Hungary had come to an end. This new provisional government, while throwing off Hungarian rule, had not yet declared independence from Austria-Hungary. Thus Emperor Karl I's government in Vienna asked the newly formed State of Slovenes, Croats and Serbs for help maintaining the fleet stationed at Pola and keeping order among the navy. The National Council refused to assist unless the Austro-Hungarian Navy was first placed under its command. Emperor Karl I, still attempting to save the Empire from collapse, agreed to the transfer, provided that the other \\"nations\\" which made up Austria-Hungary would be able to claim their fair share of the value of the fleet at a later time. All sailors not of Slovene, Croatian, Bosnian, or Serbian background were placed on leave for the time being, while the officers were given the choice of joining the new navy or retiring.Sokol, pp. 136–137, 139; Sondhaus 1994, pp. 351–352 The Austro-Hungarian government thus decided to hand over the bulk of its fleet, preferring to do that rather than give the fleet to the Allies, as the new state had declared its neutrality. Furthermore, the newly formed state had also not yet publicly repudiated Emperor Karl I, keeping the possibility of reforming the Empire into a triple monarchy alive.Halpern 1994, p. 177; Sokol 1968, pp. 136–137, 139; Sondhaus 1994, pp. 353–354 Post-war On 3 November the Austro-Hungarian government signed the Armistice of Villa Giusti with Italy, ending the fighting along the Italian Front,Sieche 1985a, p. 329 although it refused to recognize the transfer of Austria-Hungary's warships. As a result, on 4 November, Italian ships sailed into the ports of Trieste, Pola, and Fiume and Italian troops occupied the naval installations at Pola the following day. The National Council did not order any men to resist the Italians, but they also condemned Italy's actions as illegitimate. On 9 November, all remaining ships in Pola harbour had the Italian flag raised. At a conference at Corfu, the Allies agreed the transfer could not be accepted, despite sympathy from the United Kingdom.Sieche 1985b, pp. 137–140 Faced with the prospect of being given an ultimatum to surrender the former Austro-Hungarian warships, the National Council agreed to hand over the ships beginning on 10 November.Sondhaus 1994, pp. 357–359 When the Allies divided up the Austro-Hungarian Fleet amongst themselves in January 1920, Orjen was awarded to Italy. She was commissioned in the with the name Pola on 26 September, refitted and was assigned to the Venetian squadron from March 1922 where she made training cruises with machine engineering students to the Eastern Mediterranean. The ship was reduced to reserve in Taranto from 1924 to 1928 and was recommissioned for service in Libya in March 1928. Pola was reassigned to the Venetian squadron in 1929 before returning to Libya the following year. The ship was renamed Zenson on 9 April 1931 and cruised the Aegean Sea in 1931 and 1932. The ship was discarded on 1 May 1937 and subsequently scrapped.

Completed in 1913, she helped to sink an Italian destroyer during the Action off Vieste in May 1915 after Italy declared war on Austria-Hungary. Two months later the ship participated in an unsuccessful attempt to recapture a small island in the central Adriatic Sea from the Italians. In November and early December Csepel was one of the ships conducting raids off the Albanian coast to interdict the supply lines between Italy and Albania. She was hit one time during the First Battle of Durazzo in late December. Her stern was blown off by a French submarine in early 1916 and her repairs were not completed until early 1917. Csepel participated in several unsuccessful raids on the Otranto Barrage in 1917, although she sank an Italian destroyer during the Battle of the Strait of Otranto. During the Action of 22 April 1918 in the Strait of Otranto, the ship helped to damage a pair of British destroyers. She was transferred to Italy in 1920 in accordance with the peace treaties ending the war and renamed Muggia. The (Royal Italian Navy) transferred her to the Far East in 1927 where she ran aground and was wrecked during a typhoon two years later.  Design and description The Tátra-class destroyers were faster, more powerfully armed and more than twice as large as the preceding . The ships had an overall length of , a beam of , and a maximum draft of .Sieche 1985a, p. 338 They displaced at normal load and at deep load.Greger, p. 44 The ships had a complement of 105 officers and enlisted men. The Tátras were powered by two AEG-Curtiss steam turbine sets, each driving a single propeller shaft using steam provided by six Yarrow boilers. Four of the boilers were oil-fired while the remaining pair used coal. The turbines, designed to produce , were intended to give the ships a speed of . The ships carried enough oil and coal to give them a range of at . The main armament of the Tátra-class destroyers consisted of two 50-caliber Škoda Works K10 guns, one each fore and aft of the superstructure in single, unprotected mounts. Their secondary armament consisted of six 45-caliber guns, two of which were on anti-aircraft mountings. They were also equipped with four torpedo tubes in two twin rotating mountings amidships.Noppen, p. 48 Construction and career Csepel was laid down by Ganz-Danubius at their shipyard in Porto Ré in the Kingdom of Croatia-Slavonia of the Austro- Hungarian Empire on 9 January 1912, launched on 30 December 1912 and completed on 29 December 1913. The Tátra-class ships did not play a significant role in the minor raids and skirmishing in the Adriatic in 1914 and early 1915 between the Entente Cordiale and the Central Powers.Cernuschi & O'Hara, p. 168 On 13 August 1914, Csepel rescued 76 survivors and pulled 18 bodies from the water from the Austro-Hungarian passenger ship after it had blundered into a minefield and sunk. The destroyer had her propeller shaft bearings replaced from 9 to 12 May 1915.Bilzer, pp. 116–117 Action off Vieste The Kingdom of Italy signed a secret treaty in London in late April 1915 breaking its alliance with the German Empire and Austro-Hungary and promising to declare war on the Central Powers within a month. Austro-Hungarian intelligence discovered this and Admiral Anton Haus, commander of the Austro-Hungarian Navy, planned a massive surprise attack on Italian ports and facilities on the northern Adriatic coast, outside of interception range of the modern ships of the stationed at Taranto. To warn of any Italian warships able to interfere with the bombardments, Haus prepositioned three groups of destroyers, each led by a scout cruiser. Placed in the central Adriatic between the island of Pelagosa and the Italian coast, four days prior to the Italian declaration of war on 23 May, were four Tátra-class destroyers, including Csepel, and the cruiser . Around midnight on the night of 23/24 May, Haus ordered the reconnaissance groups to move west and attack Italian coastal targets. About an hour later the four Tátras encountered a pair of Italian s, and , but in the darkness they were believed by the Italians to be friendly ships.Noppen, pp. 54–55; O'Hara & Heinz, pp. 153–154 The Italian ships separated when Aquilone went to investigate a sighting; Helgoland began bombarding the city of Barletta at 04:00 and the Italian destroyer spotted the cruiser at 04:38. Aquilone turned away to the southeast and was able to disengage without any damage. Turbine, however, encountered Helgoland several minutes later and believed that she was an Italian ship until she was disabused by a salvo from the cruiser. The destroyer turned to the north, towards Vieste, to escape, with Helgoland and the destroyer in pursuit. Alerted by Helgolands commander, (Captain) Heinrich Seitz, the destroyers Csepel and , which had been bombarding Manfredonia, moved to intercept and spotted Turbine at 05:10, opening fire at 05:45. , which had been bombarding Vieste, was ordered to block her escape to the north while Helgoland stayed to the east to cut off her access to the Adriatic. Lika scored the critical hit of the battle when one of her 66-millimeter shells broke Turbines steam pipe and caused her to rapidly lose speed. Tátra and Helgoland also scored hits and Turbine was dead in the water with a list when her crew abandoned ship at 06:51. She had hit Tátra and Csepel during the engagement, but failed to inflict any significant damage. The Austro-Hungarians rescued 35 survivors before torpedoing the derelict ship. As they were withdrawing they were engaged by the protected cruiser and the armed merchant cruiser between 07:10 and 07:19. Helgoland was struck by one shell before they were able to disengage from the slower ships.Noppen, pp. 56–57; O'Hara & Heinz, pp. 154–155 On 23 July Helgoland and her sister , escorted by Csepel, Tátra, their sister and three other destroyers bombarded the towns of Termoli, Ortona and San Benedetto del Tronto while a landing party cut the telegraph cable in Tremiti. Five days later, all six Tátra-class ships and the same pair of cruisers, reinforced by the German submarine , attempted to recapture Pelagosa. Despite a heavy bombardment by the ships, the 108-man landing party was unable to overcome the 90-man garrison and was forced to withdraw.Cernuschi & O'Hara 2015, p. 169; Halpern 1994, pp. 148–150 The Bulgarian declaration of war on Serbia on 14 October cut the existing supply line from Serbia to Salonika, Greece, and forced the Allies to begin supplying Serbia through ports in Albania. This took about a month to work out the details and the Austro-Hungarians took just about as long to decide on a response. Haus ordered Seitz to take Helgoland, Saida and all six Tátra-class destroyers on a reconnaissance mission off the Albanian coast on the night of 22/23 November. They encountered and sank a small cargo ship and a motor schooner carrying flour for Serbia; four Italian destroyers were unable to intercept them before they reached friendly territory. Haus was initially reluctant to send his ships so far south, but an order from the (High Command) on 29 November to patrol the Albanian coast and to disrupt Allied troop movements caused him to transfer Helgoland, her sister and the Tátra-class ships to Cattaro. On 6 December, Helgoland and the Tátras swept down the coast to Durazzo, sinking five motor schooners, including two in Durazzo harbor.Cernuschi & O'Hara 2015, pp. 165, 169; Halpern 1994, pp. 153–154 First Battle of Durazzo Austro-Hungarian aircraft spotted a pair of Italian destroyers in Durazzo harbor on 28 December and Haus dispatched Seitz to take Helgoland, Tátra, Csepel, Lika, Balaton and their sister south and search the area between Durazzo and Brindisi for them. If they were not found he was to arrive at Durazzo at dawn and destroy any ships found there. Seitz's ships sailed later that day and sank the at 02:35; Csepel rescued seven survivors. He was unable to find the destroyers and dutifully arrived off Durazzo at dawn. At 07:30 he ordered four of his destroyers into the harbor to sink the cargo ship and two schooners anchored there while Helgoland engaged the coastal artillery defending the port. A well-camouflaged artillery battery opened fire at 08:00 at point-blank range. While maneuvering to avoid its fire, Lika and Triglav entered a minefield. After striking two mines in quick succession, Lika sank at 08:03 and Triglav was crippled when her boiler rooms flooded after hitting one mine. After she was maneuvered out of the minefield, Csepel attempted to pass a towline, but it got tangled in one of her own propellers, badly damaging it and limited her to . Tátra was finally successful in securing a tow at 09:30, but was limited to a speed of when Seitz led his ships northwards. He radioed for assistance at 10:35 and was informed an hour later that the armored cruiser and four torpedo boats were en route to support him.Bilzer, p. 118; Cernuschi & O'Hara 2015, pp. 165, 169; Halpern 1994, pp. 155–157; Noppen, pp. 60–61; O'Hara & Heinz, pp. 157–158 Csepel on the right, followed by Balaton and Tátra, returning after the 1st Battle of Durazzo, 30 December 1915 Italian observers had spotted Seitz's ships at 07:00 and the Allied quick-reaction force of the British light cruiser , commanded by Captain Percy Addison, and the Italian scout cruiser , escorted by five French destroyers, sortied in an attempt to cut off the Austro-Hungarian ships from their base at Cattaro. These were followed two hours later by the Italian scout cruiser , the British light cruiser and four Italian destroyers. Seitz ordered Triglav to be abandoned at 13:15 once the smoke from these ships had been spotted and for Csepel to turn to the south then southwest while the main body briefly covered her before turning southwest themselves. The French destroyers were ordered to deal with Triglav at 13:38 while the cruisers pursued Seitz's ships.Cernuschi & O'Hara 2015, p. 165; Halpern 1994, pp. 156–157; Noppen, p. 61; O'Hara & Heinz, pp. 157–159 Quartos captain initially positioned his ship in trail behind Dartmouth, thinking to cut-off Csepel, but Addison ordered Quarto to fall in on Dartmouths port quarter around 14:15, away from Csepel. He ordered the Italian ship to pursue Csepel fifteen minutes later, but by then the destroyer had increased her speed to . Quarto opened fire at a range of at 14:40 and the Austro-Hungarian ship started zigzagging to throw off Quartos fire. She only fired 23 times by 15:08 and managed to hit Csepel once, inflicting little damage. The destroyer managed to rejoin Seitz's main body about 16:45 and the Austro-Hungarians were able to disengage before reaching the Italian coast when darkness fell around 17:30.Cernuschi & O'Hara 2015, pp. 165, 169; Halpern 1994, p. 157; Noppen, pp. 61–62; O'Hara & Heinz, pp. 158–161 Csepel being towed into Cattaro on 4 May 1916 after being torpedoed On 27 January 1916, Novara, Csepel and Orjen departed Cattaro on a mission to attack the shipping in Durazzo harbor. En route the two sisters accidentally collided with each other and had to return to port although the cruiser continued the mission. Csepel was under repair until 21 April. On 4 May, the torpedoed the destroyer off Cattaro and blew off her stern. She was towed to port for emergency repairs and was then towed to Fiume for permanent repairs on 13–16 May. On 3 June, Csepel was moved to Porto Ré where she was fitted with a replacement stern taken from one of the under construction. After working up, the ship returned to Cattaro on 31 October. On the night of 11/12 March 1917, Balaton, Orjen, Csepel and Tátra swept through the Strait of Otranto, but failed to sink the French cargo ship that they encountered.Bilzer, p. 117; Cernuschi & O'Hara 2015, p. 169; Cernuschi & O'Hara 2016, p. 67; Halpern 2004, p. 79; O'Hara & Heinz, p. 200 Battle of the Strait of Otranto On the night of 14/15 May, Balaton and Csepel departed Cattaro with orders to search off the Albanian coast and the Strait of Otranto for Allied shipping. They were intended to act as a diversion for the attack by the three scout cruisers on the Otranto Barrage. The destroyers encountered a convoy of three merchant ships, escorted by the , at 03:10. Csepel lit up Borea with her searchlight at 03:24 and opened fire immediately afterward, hitting the Italian ship four times in rapid succession. One of the hits broke her main steam pipe which caused her to slow to a stop and the others set her on fire; she sank shortly before dawn. Balaton fired at the which blew up when her cargo of ammunition exploded. The destroyers engaged the other two ships, setting one on fire and slightly damaging the other one, after which they disengaged and headed north at .Cernuschi & O'Hara 2016, pp. 62–63, 67; Halpern, pp. 162–163; Noppen, pp. 69, 71; O'Hara & Heinz, pp. 260, 262 Italian observers reported this action at 03:48 and the patrolling Italian scout cruiser and her escorting trio of French destroyers were alerted at 04:35 and turned south to intercept. They did not spot the Austro-Hungarian ships, but another group of Allied ships did at 07:45. This group consisted of two British light cruisers, the brand-new Italian scout cruiser and four Italian destroyers under the command of Rear Admiral Alfredo Acton. He ordered Aquila and the destroyers to investigate five minutes later as the Austro-Hungarian ships turned away towards Durazzo. The scout cruiser was the fastest ship in the Italian fleet and she opened fire at 08:15 at a range of while closing the range to before Csepel hit her once at 08:32; severing her main steam line, killing seven men and causing her to lose power. The destroyers continued the pursuit, but broke off when shells from Durazzo's coastal artillery began dropping around them about 09:05. After the Italian ships moved to rejoin Acton's force at 09:18, Balaton and Csepel turned towards Cattaro, evading an attack by Bernoulli en route. During the battle, Csepel fired 127 rounds from her main guns, 78 shells from her secondary armament and two torpedoes.Cernuschi & O'Hara 2016, p. 63; Halpern 1994, p. 163; Noppen, p. 71; O'Hara & Heinz, pp. 263–264, 269 Helgoland and all of the Tátras attempted to duplicate the success of the earlier raid on 18–19 October, but they were spotted by Italian aircraft and turned back in the face of substantial Allied reinforcements alerted by the aircraft. On the night of 13 December, Csepel, Tátra and Balaton raided the Otranto Barrage, but disengaged after firing torpedoes at what they believed to be four Allied destroyers, although there is no record of any attacks that night in Allied records. The smaller ships in the Austro-Hungarian Navy were the most active ones and their crews had the highest morale; most of the larger ships did little but swing on their moorings which did nothing to improve the morale of their crews. On 1 February, the Cattaro Mutiny broke out, starting aboard the armored cruiser . The mutineers rapidly gained control of Kaiser Karl VI and most of the other major warships in the harbor. Unhappy with the failure of the smaller ships' crews to join the mutiny, the mutineers threatened to fire at any ship that failed to hoist a red flag. Csepels crew hoisted a flag with the permission of her captain with the proviso that there should be no disturbances aboard ship. The following day, many of the mutinous ships abandoned the effort after coast-defense guns loyal to the government opened fire on the rebel guard ship . The scout cruisers and Csepel, among other ships, took advantage of the confusion to rejoin loyalist forces in the inner harbor where they were protected by coastal artillery. The next morning, the s arrived from Pola and put down the uprising. The destroyer was refitted in Pola from 7 to 20 April.Bilzer, p. 118; Halpern 2004b, pp. 48–50, 52–53; Sondhaus 1994, p. 322 Action of 22 April 1918 On the night of 22–23 April 1918, Csepel and all four s attempted to intercept Allied shipping in the Strait of Otranto. They were spotted by the pair of British destroyers, and , which were patrolling the western side of the Strait. The British ships altered course to intercept them. At a range of about the leading Austrian destroyer opened fire. The British ships reversed course and began laying a smoke screen hoping to lure the Austrians further south. The Austrians began hitting their targets quickly with Jackal slightly damaged by three hits, but Hornet was badly damaged by hits that caused a fire and subsequent explosion in her forward magazine and jammed her steering so that she began turning circles. Their return fire was ineffective, but the Austrians disengaged after about 15 minutes, pursued by Jackal. The other four destroyers of the patrol had steamed towards the battle and they joined the pursuit for a couple of hours before turning away about from Cattaro. Csepel received an extensive refit from 13 June to 7 October in Pola. She returned to Cattaro the following day, but was back in Pola by the war's end.Bilzer, p. 118; Cernuschi & O'Hara 2016, pp. 68, 71; Halpern 2004, pp. 137–140; Noppen, p. 80; O'Hara & Heinz, p. 284 End of the war By October it had become clear that Austria-Hungary was facing defeat in the war. With various attempts to quell nationalist sentiments failing, Emperor Karl I decided to sever Austria-Hungary's alliance with Germany and appeal to the Allies in an attempt to preserve the empire from complete collapse. On 26 October Austria-Hungary informed Germany that their alliance was over. At the same time, the Austro-Hungarian Navy was in the process of tearing itself apart along ethnic and nationalist lines. Vice Admiral Miklós Horthy was informed on the morning of 28 October that an armistice was imminent, and used this news to maintain order and prevent a mutiny among the fleet.

The village is notable for the attractive wooden fronted housing on Main Street.  The meaning of the place-name  Minishant's old school on School Road. The etymology of the name 'Minishant' can be traced back to the Scots Gaelic 'Muine Seant' or the 'Sacred thicket' equivalent to 'Holy Wood'.

An exact copy of the church was built by Sir Peter Coats in Algiers where he moved to improve his health. Behind the church was a reading room and library, open to all in the district. Minishant War Memorial The war memorial Celtic cross was dedicated in 1920 and was unveiled by the factor of the nearby Monkwood Estate, Major James Murdoch. It was originally located in the forecourt of the Lady Coats Memorial Church but it was moved to Main Street in 1987 when the church closed and public access was restricted.Minishant War Memorial The Waulk Mill Standing next to the Minishant Bridge over the Culroy or Polnatibber Burn the waulk or wauk's waterwheel was powered via a mill weir, lade and sluice arrangement. Andrew and James Limond at the mill advertised that they manufactured blankets, tweeds, plaidings, flannels, etc. It is shown on the OS map as being disused by 1894. The mill building survives, having become the village hall and later a private dwelling.Smug and Snug Victorian VillageAyrshire Sheet XXXIX.SW, Surveyed: 1908, Published: 1910 In 1894 a second steam-powered woollen mill, also owned by the Limond brothers, stood behind the row of cottages near the waulk mill sluice.Ayrshire, 039.10, Surveyed: 1894, Published: 1896 A short tramway incline with a waggon on a rope, known as the Bogey Line, transported coal up to the mill.

The mill closed in 1950.Minishant is a Bonnie Wee Place The Minishant Inn An old inn that is now in use as a restaurant. Cassillis railway station Cassillis Villa and old railway station site Cassillis railway station was opened on 13 October 1856 by the Ayr and Maybole Junction Railway the line passed to the Glasgow and South Western Railway. The station served Minishant and the nearby farming area including Cassillis House and estate. Originally it was a single platform station however a second platform was added with a goods yard when the line was doubled. Cassillis closed 6 December 1954 however the now single track line to Maybole, Girvan and Stranraer remains in regular use. The regular bus service on the A77 drew passengers away from this 'out of the way' station. Cassillis Villa A building known as Cassillis Villa is associated with the station from around 1894, however, a stationmaster's house stood near the platforms and the villa may have been linked to the Cassillis House requirements in some fashion. Country houses Grange House Once part of the lands of Little Maybole or Maybothelbeg granted by Duncan, 1st Earl of Carrick, to the monks of Melrose Abbey. A large granary is thought to have been present here and part of its walls are thought to survive within the stable buildings. In the Book of Melrose a record survives of Robert the Bruce in 1301 confirming a grant of the 'Grange of Maybothyl' to the Cistercian monks of Melrose Abbey. A cloaca-like tunnel or drain, large enough for a person to walk through in a crouched position, runs to the north-east from that side of the house and is thought to have been associated with the old monk's grange being comparable to those found at Paisley Abbey, Fountains Abbey, Dundrennan Abbey and significantly Melrose Abbey.Hall, Derek (2006).

Located near Nether Auchendrane at Blairston Mains Farm (NS332165) Wallace's Stone has a cross engraved upon a now recumbent suspected megalithic standing stone, probably carried out to Christianise this pagan structure. The cross is sword-like with expanded terminals and a shaft that tapers towards a sword-like tip. William Wallace, the Scottish hero, has also been associated with this stone, the tradition locally being that he laid his sword on the granite boulder and someone carved out its image on the stone or in another version it miraculously formed its own impression in the whinstone.Campbell, Thorbjorn (2003). Ayrshire. A Historical Guide. Edinburgh : Birlinn . p. 253.The Modern Antiquarian It has also been linked to King Robert the Bruce and another tradition is that it was created by a respected holy man to seal a peace treaty ending a feud between a King of the Picts and a King of the Scots, and after laying his cross upon the whinstone boulder it left an imprint. The 3.5 foot long stone was originally near Wallace's Cave in the Long Glen however it was decided that it should be more visible so it was dragged by a team of Clydesdales to its present location. It was too difficult to stabilise in a standing position so it remains horizontal on the ground. It may have been one of a series of stones marking the ancient pilgrims' route to Whithorn.Love, Dane (2009). Legendary Ayrshire. Custom: Folklore: Tradition. Auchinleck: Carn. p. 40. Wallace's Cave In the Long Glen (NS326161) close to Whiteleys Farm is a cave with an entrance level with the watercourse and local legend has it that William Wallace hid at this location after the \\"Barns of Ayr\\" incident in 1297. It is on the south bank of the Long Glen Burn and has an entrance that is about 5 feet in height and about two at the bottom. The tool marks on the twelve-foot tunnel are suggestive of it being largely man- made. The roof slopes downwards towards the back of the cave.Scotland's Places - Wallace's Cave.

Completed in 1913, she did not participate in the attacks on the Italian mainland after Italy declared war on Austria- Hungary in May 1915. Two months later the ship bombarded a small island in the Central Adriatic Sea during an unsuccessful attempt to recapture it from the Italians. In November and early December Balaton was one of the ships conducting raids off the Albanian coast to interdict the supply lines between Italy and Albania. She played a minor role in the 1st Battle of Durazzo in late December. Balaton participated in several unsuccessful raids on the Otranto Barrage in 1917, although she sank an ammunition ship during the Battle of the Strait of Otranto. She was transferred to Italy in 1920 in accordance with the peace treaties ending the war and renamed Zenson. The (Royal Italian Navy) used her for spare parts; she was discarded in 1923 and subsequently scrapped.

The ships had an overall length of , a beam of , and a maximum draft of .Sieche 1985a, p. 338 They displaced at normal load and at deep load.Greger, p. 44 The ships had a complement of 105 officers and enlisted men. The Tátras were powered by two AEG-Curtiss steam turbine sets, each driving a single propeller shaft using steam provided by six Yarrow boilers. Four of the boilers were oil-fired while the remaining pair used coal. The turbines, designed to produce , were intended to give the ships a speed of . The ships carried enough oil and coal to give them a range of at . The main armament of the Tátra-class destroyers consisted of two 50-caliber Škoda Works K10 guns, one each fore and aft of the superstructure in single mounts. Their secondary armament consisted of six 45-caliber guns, two of which were on anti-aircraft mountings. They were also equipped with four torpedo tubes in two twin rotating mountings amidships.Noppen, p. 48 Construction and career Balaton was laid down by Ganz-Danubius at their shipyard in Porto Ré in the Kingdom of Croatia-Slavonia of the Austro-Hungarian Empire on 6 November 1911, launched on 16 November 1912 and completed on 3 November 1913. The Tátra-class ships did not play a significant role in the minor raids and skirmishing in the Adriatic in 1914 and early 1915 between the Entente Cordiale and the Central Powers.Cernuschi & O'Hara, p. 168 On 13 August 1914, Balaton helped to rescue survivors from the Austro-Hungarian passenger ship after it had blundered into a minefield and sunk.Bilzer, p. 117 On 23 July the scout cruisers and , escorted by Balaton, her sisters and and three other destroyers bombarded the towns of Termoli, Ortona and San Benedetto del Tronto while a landing party cut the telegraph cable in Tremiti. On 28 July, all six Tátra-class ships and the same pair of cruisers, reinforced by the German submarine , attempted to recapture Pelagosa. Despite a heavy bombardment by the ships, the 108-man landing party was unable to overcome the 90-man garrison and was forced to withdraw.Cernuschi & O'Hara 2015, p. 169; Halpern 1994, pp. 148–150 The Bulgarian declaration of war on Serbia on 14 October cut the existing supply line from Serbia to Salonika, Greece, and forced the Allies to begin supplying Serbia through ports in Albania. This took about a month to work out the details and the Austro-Hungarians took just about as long to decide on a response. Admiral Anton Haus, commander of the Austro-Hungarian Navy, ordered (Captain) Heinrich Seitz, Helgolands commander, to take his ship, Saida and all six Tátra-class destroyers on a reconnaissance mission off the Albanian coast on the night of 22/23 November. They encountered and sank a small cargo ship and a motor schooner carrying flour for Serbia; four Italian destroyers were unable to intercept them before they reached friendly territory. Haus was initially reluctant to send his ships so far south, but an order from the (High Command) on 29 November to patrol the Albanian coast and to disrupt Allied troop movements caused him to transfer Helgoland, her sister and the Tátra-class ships to Cattaro. On 6 December, Helgoland and the Tátras swept down the coast to Durazzo, sinking five motor schooners, including two in Durazzo harbor.Cernuschi & O'Hara 2015, pp. 165, 169; Halpern, pp. 153–154 1st Battle of Durazzo Austro-Hungarian aircraft spotted a pair of Italian destroyers in Durazzo harbor on 28 December and Haus dispatched Seitz to take Helgoland, Balaton, Csepel, Tátra and their sisters and south and search the area between Durazzo and Brindisi for them. If they were not found he was to arrive at Durazzo at dawn and destroy any ships found there. Seitz's ships sailed later that day and Balaton sank the at 02:35, rescuing two officers and 18 seamen afterwards. He was unable to find the destroyers and dutifully arrived off Durazzo at dawn. At 07:30 he ordered four of his destroyers into the harbor to sink the cargo ship and two schooners anchored there while Helgoland engaged the coastal artillery defending the port and Balaton patrolled the seaward flank. A well-camouflaged artillery battery opened fire at 08:00 at point-blank range. While maneuvering to avoid its fire, Lika and Triglav entered a minefield. After striking two mines in quick succession, Lika sank at 08:03 and Triglav was crippled when her boiler rooms flooded after hitting one mine.Tátra was finally successful in securing a tow on Triglav at 09:30, but was limited to a speed of when Seitz led his ships northwards. He radioed for assistance at 10:35 and was informed an hour later that the armored cruiser and four torpedo boats were en route to support him.Bilzer, p. 117; Cernuschi & O'Hara 2015, pp. 165, 169; Halpern 1994, pp. 155–157; Noppen, pp. 60–61; O'Hara & Heinz, pp. 157–158 Italian observers had spotted Seitz's ships at 07:00 and the Allied quick-reaction force of the British light cruiser and the Italian scout cruiser , escorted by five French destroyers, sortied in an attempt to cut off the Austro-Hungarian ships from their base at Cattaro. These were followed two hours later by the Italian scout cruiser , the British light cruiser and four Italian destroyers. Seitz had ordered Triglavs crew taken off before any of the columns of smoke from these ships were spotted by his ships and he ordered Tátra to drop her tow at 13:15 and abandon Triglav. Five minutes later the Austro-Hungarian ships were spotted and the French destroyers were ordered to deal with Triglav at 13:38 while the cruisers pursued Seitz's ships.Cernuschi & O'Hara 2015, p. 165; Halpern 1994, pp. 156–157; Noppen, p. 61; O'Hara & Heinz, pp. 157–159 Csepel on the right, followed by Balaton and Tátra, returning after the 1st Battle of Durazzo, 30 December 1915 Seitz turned southwest at to put as much distance between his ships and their pursuers although Darmouth opened fire at her maximum range of at 13:43 and scored her first hit on Helgoland twelve minutes later. The destroyers were generally not engaged during this battle, being further away, although Csepel was hit once with little effect. Despite further hits on the cruiser which reduced her speed to the Austro-Hungarians were able to disengage before reaching the Italian coast when darkness fell around 17:30 and they reached Sebenico safely.Cernuschi & O'Hara 2015, p. 165; Halpern 1994, p. 157; Noppen, pp. 61–62; O'Hara & Heinz, pp. 158–161 Balaton was refitting in Pola from 1 January to 11 February 1916.Bilzer, p. 117 On the night of 31 May/1 June, Balaton and her sister , together with three torpedo boats, attacked the Otranto Barrage and sank one of the drifters maintaining it with a torpedo. On 4 July Helgoland, Balaton, Orjen and Tátra raided the barrage, but could not find any targets in the poor visibility. Helgoland and Novara, escorted by Balaton and Orjen, comprised one of two bombardment groups that Haus planned to bombard the Italian coast on 29 August to provoke a reaction by Allied ships that would be ambushed by waiting U-boats. The weather did not cooperate and it was too foggy to see the coast and all the ships involved returned to harbor without incident. On the night of 11/12 March 1917, Balaton, Orjen, Csepel and Tátra swept through the Strait of Otranto, but failed to sink the French cargo ship that they encountered.Cernuschi & O'Hara 2015, p. 170; Cernuschi & O'Hara 2016, p. 67; Halpern 2004a, p. 24; Noppen, pp. 64–65; O'Hara & Heinz, p. 206 Battle of the Strait of Otranto On the night of 14/15 May, Balaton and Csepel departed Cattaro with orders to search off the Albanian coast and the Strait of Otranto for Allied shipping. They were intended to act as a diversion for the attack by the three scout cruisers on the barrage. The destroyers encountered a convoy of three merchant ships, escorted by the , at 03:10. Csepel lit up Borea with her searchlight at 03:24 and opened fire immediately afterward, hitting the Italian ship four times in rapid succession. One of the hits broke her main steam pipe which caused her to slow to a stop and the others set her on fire; she sank shortly before dawn. Balaton fired at the which blew up when her cargo of ammunition exploded. The destroyers engaged the other two ships, setting one on fire and slightly damaging the other one, after which they disengaged and headed north at .Cernuschi & O'Hara 2016, pp. 62–63, 67; Halpern 1994, pp. 162–163; Noppen, pp. 69, 71; O'Hara & Heinz, pp. 260, 262 Italian observers reported this action at 03:48 and the patrolling Italian scout cruiser Carlo Mirabello and her escorting trio of French destroyers were alerted at 04:35 and turned south to intercept. They did not spot the Austro-Hungarian ships, but another group of Allied ships did at 07:45. This group consisted of two British light cruisers, the brand-new Italian scout cruiser Aquila and four Italian destroyers under the command of Rear Admiral Alfredo Acton. He ordered Aquila and the destroyers to investigate five minutes later as the Austro-Hungarian ships turned away towards Durazzo. The scout cruiser was the fastest ship in the Italian fleet and she opened fire at 08:15 at a range of while closing the range to before Csepel hit her once at 08:32; severing her main steam line and causing her to lose power. The destroyers continued the pursuit, but broke off when shells from Durazzo's coastal artillery began dropping around them around 09:05. After the Italian ships were moving to rejoin Acton's force at 09:18, Balaton and Csepel turned towards Cattaro, evading an attack by the en route. During the battle, Balaton fired 85 rounds from her main guns, 60 shells from her secondary armament and two torpedoes.Cernuschi & O'Hara 2016, p. 63; Halpern 1994, p. 163; Noppen, p. 71; O'Hara & Heinz, pp. 263–264, 269 Helgoland and all of the Tátras attempted to duplicate the success of the earlier raid on 18–19 October, but they were spotted by Italian aircraft and turned back in the face of substantial Allied reinforcements alerted by the aircraft. On the night of 13 December, Balaton, Tátra and Csepel raided the Otranto Barrage, but disengaged after firing torpedoes at what they believed to be four Allied destroyers, although there is no record of any attacks that night in Allied records.Cernuschi & O'Hara 2016, pp. 69, 73 The smaller ships in the Austro- Hungarian Navy were the most active ones and their crews had the highest morale; most of the larger ships did little but swing on their moorings which did nothing to improve the morale of their crews. On 1 February, the Cattaro Mutiny broke out, starting aboard the armored cruiser . The mutineers rapidly gained control of the armored cruiser and most of the other major warships in the harbor. Unhappy with the failure of the smaller ships' crews to join the mutiny, the mutineers threatened to fire at any ship that failed to hoist a red flag. Balatons crew hoisted a flag with the permission of her captain with the proviso that there should be no disturbances aboard ship. The following day, many of the mutinous ships abandoned the effort after coast-defense guns loyal to the government opened fire on the rebel guard ship . The scout cruisers and Balaton, among other ships, took advantage of the confusion to rejoin loyalist forces in the inner harbor they were protected by coastal artillery. The next morning, the s arrived from Pola and put down the uprising.Bilzer, p. 117; Halpern 2004b, pp. 48–50, 52–53; Sondhaus 1994, p. 322 On the night of 1/2 July, Balaton, the destroyer and two torpedo boats were at sea to support an air raid on Venice. They were spotted by a group of seven Italian destroyers south of Caorle and they fought a brief battle with the Italians before disengaging. Both Balaton and Csikós were hit once during the engagement.Cernuschi & O'Hara 2016, pp. 69, 73; Noppen, p. 75 Balaton began a refit at Pola on 12 September. End of the war By October it had become clear that Austria-Hungary was facing defeat in the war. With various attempts to quell nationalist sentiments failing, Emperor Karl I decided to sever Austria-Hungary's alliance with Germany and appeal to the Allies in an attempt to preserve the empire from complete collapse. On 26 October Austria- Hungary informed Germany that their alliance was over. At the same time, the Austro-Hungarian Navy was in the process of tearing itself apart along ethnic and nationalist lines. Vice Admiral Miklós Horthy was informed on the morning of 28 October that an armistice was imminent, and used this news to maintain order and prevent a mutiny among the fleet. While a mutiny was spared, tensions remained high and morale was at an all-time low.Sondhaus 1994, pp. 350–351 The following day the National Council in Zagreb announced Croatia's dynastic ties to Hungary had come to an end. This new provisional government, while throwing off Hungarian rule, had not yet declared independence from Austria-Hungary. Thus Emperor Karl I's government in Vienna asked the newly formed State of Slovenes, Croats and Serbs for help maintaining the fleet stationed at Pola and keeping order among the navy. The National Council refused to assist unless the Austro-Hungarian Navy was first placed under its command. Emperor Karl I, still attempting to save the Empire from collapse, agreed to the transfer, provided that the other \\"nations\\" which made up Austria-Hungary would be able to claim their fair share of the value of the fleet at a later time. All sailors not of Slovene, Croatian, Bosnian, or Serbian background were placed on leave for the time being, while the officers were given the choice of joining the new navy or retiring.Sokol, pp. 136–137, 139; Sondhaus 1994, pp. 351–352 The Austro-Hungarian government thus decided to hand over the bulk of its fleet, preferring to do that rather than give the fleet to the Allies, as the new state had declared its neutrality. Furthermore, the newly formed state had also not yet publicly dethroned Emperor Karl I, keeping the possibility of reforming the Empire into a triple monarchy alive.Halpern 1994, p. 177; Sokol 1968, pp. 136–137, 139; Sondhaus 1994, pp. 353–354 Post-war On 3 November the Austro-Hungarian government signed the Armistice of Villa Giusti with Italy, ending the fighting along the Italian Front,Sieche 1985a, p. 329 although it refused to recognize the transfer of Austria-Hungary's warships. As a result, on 4 November, Italian ships sailed into the ports of Trieste, Pola, and Fiume and Italian troops occupied the naval installations at Pola the following day. The National Council did not order any men to resist the Italians, but they also condemned Italy's actions as illegitimate. On 9 November, all remaining ships in Pola harbour had the Italian flag raised. At a conference at Corfu, the Allies agreed the transfer could not be accepted, despite sympathy from the United Kingdom.Sieche 1985b, pp. 137–140 Faced with the prospect of being given an ultimatum to surrender the former Austro-Hungarian warships, the National Council agreed to hand over the ships beginning on 10 November.Sondhaus 1994, pp. 357–359 When the Allies divided up the Austro-Hungarian Fleet amongst its members in January 1920, Balaton was awarded to Italy. She was commissioned in the Regia Marina with the name Zenson on 27 September, but was discarded and subsequently scrapped on 5 July 1923 after having been cannibalized to provide spare parts for her sisters.

Completed in 1913, she helped to sink an Italian destroyer during the Action off Vieste in May 1915 after Italy declared war on Austria-Hungary. Two months later the ship participated in an unsuccessful attempt to recapture a small island in the Central Adriatic Sea from the Italians. In November and early December Tátra was one of the ships conducting raids off the Albanian coast to interdict the supply lines between Italy and Albania. During the early stages of the 1st Battle of Durazzo in late December, the ship was tasked to tow her one of her sister ships that had been crippled by a mine. She was forced to abandon her sister when the Austro-Hungarians were spotted by a strong force of Allied ships and had to evade their pursuit. Tátra participated in several unsuccessful raids on the Otranto Barrage in 1917. She was transferred to Italy in 1920 in accordance with the peace treaties ending the war and renamed Fasana. The (Royal Italian Navy) used her for spare parts; she was discarded in 1923 and subsequently scrapped.  Design and description A model of Tátra in the Heeresgeschichtliches Museum Wien The Tátra-class destroyers were faster, more powerfully armed and more than twice as large as the preceding . The ships had an overall length of , a beam of , and a maximum draft of .Sieche 1985a, p. 338 They displaced at normal load and at deep load.Greger, p. 44 The ships had a complement of 105 officers and enlisted men. The Tátras were powered by two AEG-Curtiss steam turbine sets, each driving a single propeller shaft using steam provided by six Yarrow boilers. Four of the boilers were oil-fired while the remaining pair used coal. The turbines, designed to produce , were intended to give the ships a speed of . The ships carried enough oil and coal to give them a range of at . The main armament of the Tátra-class destroyers consisted of two 50-caliber Škoda Works K10 guns, one each fore and aft of the superstructure in single mounts. Their secondary armament consisted of six 45-caliber guns, two of which were on anti-aircraft mountings. They were also equipped with four torpedo tubes in two twin rotating mountings amidships.Noppen, p. 48 Construction and career Three Tátra-class destroyers on maneuvers circa 1914; on the left and Tátra in the center Tátra was laid down by Ganz-Danubius at their shipyard in Porto Ré in the Kingdom of Croatia-Slavonia of the Austro-Hungarian Empire on 19 October 1911, launched on 4 November 1912 and completed on 18 October 1913. The Tátra- class ships did not play a significant role in the minor raids and skirmishing in the Adriatic in 1914 and early 1915 between the Entente Cordiale and the Central Powers.Cernuschi & O'Hara 2015, p. 168 From 21 November to 9 December, Triglav had her propeller shaft bearings replaced.Bilzer, p. 116 Action off Vieste The Kingdom of Italy signed a secret treaty in London in late April 1915 breaking its alliance with the German Empire and Austro-Hungary and promising to declare war on the Central Powers within a month. Austro- Hungarian intelligence discovered this and Admiral Anton Haus, commander of the Austro-Hungarian Navy, planned a massive surprise attack on Italian ports and facilities on the Northern Adriatic coast, outside of interception range of the modern ships of the stationed at Taranto. To warn of any Italian warships able to interfere with the bombardments, Haus prepositioned three groups of destroyers, each led by a scout cruiser. Placed in the Central Adriatic between the island of Pelagosa and the Italian coast, four days prior to the Italian declaration of war on 23 May, were four Tátra-class destroyers, including Tátra, and the cruiser . Around midnight on the night of 23/24 May, Haus ordered the reconnaissance groups to move west and attack Italian coastal targets. About an hour later the four Tátras encountered a pair of Italian s, and , but they were believed by the Italians to be friendly ships in the darkness.Noppen, pp. 54–55; O'Hara & Heinz, pp. 153–154 The Italian ships separated when Aquilone went to investigate a sighting; Helgoland began bombarding the city of Barletta at 04:00 and the Italian destroyer spotted the cruiser at 04:38. The ship turned away to the southeast and was able to disengage without any damage. Turbine, however, encountered Helgoland several minutes later and believed that she was an Italian ship until she was disabused by a salvo from the cruiser. The destroyer turned to the north, towards Vieste, to escape, with Helgoland and the destroyer in pursuit. Alerted by Helgolands commander, Linienschiffskapitän (Captain) Heinrich Seitz, the destroyers and Tátra, which had been bombarding Manfredonia, moved to intercept and spotted Turbine at 05:10, opening fire at 05:45. , which had been bombarding Vieste, was ordered to block her escape to the north while Helgoland stayed to the east to cut off her access to the Adriatic. Lika scored the critical hit of the battle when one of her 66-millimeter shells broke Turbines steam pipe and caused her to rapidly lose speed. Tátra and Helgoland also scored hits and Turbine was dead in the water with a list when her crew abandoned ship at 06:51. She had hit Tátra and Csepel during the engagement, but failed to inflict any significant damage. The Austro- Hungarians rescued 35 survivors before torpedoing the derelict. As they were withdrawing they were engaged by the protected cruiser and the armed merchant cruiser between 07:10 and 07:19. Helgoland was struck by one shell before they were able to disengage from the slower ships.Noppen, pp. 56–57; O'Hara & Heinz, pp. 154–155 Tátra bombarded Pelagosa two days after it had been occupied by the Italians on 11 July. Twelve days later, Helgoland and her sister , escorted by Tátra, Csepel, their sister and three other destroyers bombarded the towns of Termoli, Ortona and San Benedetto del Tronto while a landing party cut the telegraph cable in Tremiti. On 28 July, all six Tátra- class ships and the same pair of cruisers, reinforced by the German submarine , attempted to recapture Pelagosa. Despite a heavy bombardment by the ships, the 108-man landing party was unable to overcome the 90-man garrison and was forced to withdraw.Cernuschi & O'Hara 2015, p. 169; Halpern 1994, pp. 148–150 The Bulgarian declaration of war on Serbia on 14 October cut the existing supply line from Serbia to Salonika, Greece, and forced the Allies to begin supplying Serbia through ports in Albania. This took about a month to work out the details and the Austro-Hungarians took just about as long to decide on a response. Haus ordered Seitz to take Helgoland, Saida and all six Tátra-class destroyers on a reconnaissance mission off the Albanian coast on the night of 22/23 November. They encountered and sank a small cargo ship and a motor schooner carrying flour for Serbia; four Italian destroyers were unable to intercept them before they reached friendly territory. Haus was initially reluctant to send his ships so far south, but an order from the Austro- Hungarian High Command () on 29 November to patrol the Albanian coast and to disrupt Allied troop movements caused him to transfer Helgoland, her sister and the Tátra-class ships to Cattaro. On 6 December, Helgoland and the Tátras swept down the coast to Durazzo, sinking five motor schooners, including two in Durazzo harbor.Cernuschi & O'Hara 2015, pp. 165, 169; Halpern 1994, pp. 153–154 1st Battle of Durazzo Austro-Hungarian aircraft spotted a pair of Italian destroyers in Durazzo harbor on 28 December and Haus dispatched Seitz to take Helgoland, Tátra, Csepel, Lika, Balaton and their sister south and search the area between Durazzo and Brindisi for them. If they were not found he was to arrive at Durazzo at dawn and destroy any ships found there. Seitz's ships sailed later that day and sank the at 02:35. He was unable to find the destroyers and dutifully arrived off Durazzo at dawn. At 07:30 he ordered four of his destroyers into the harbor to sink the cargo ship and two schooners anchored there while Helgoland engaged the coastal artillery defending the port. A well-camouflaged artillery battery opened fire at 08:00 at point-blank range. While maneuvering to avoid its fire, Lika and Triglav entered a minefield. After striking two mines in quick succession, Lika sank at 08:03 and Triglav was crippled when her boiler rooms flooded after hitting one mine. After she was maneuvered out of the minefield, Csepel attempted to pass a towline, but it got tangled in one of her own propellers, badly damaging it. Tátra was finally successful in securing a tow at 09:30, while also rescuing the ship's executive officer and 33 seamen, but was limited to a speed of when Seitz led his ships northwards. He radioed for assistance at 10:35 and was informed an hour later that the armored cruiser and four torpedo boats were en route to support him.Bilzer, p. 116; Cernuschi & O'Hara 2015, pp. 165, 169; Halpern 1994, pp. 155–157; Noppen, pp. 60–61; O'Hara & Heinz, pp. 157–158 Italian observers had spotted Seitz's ships at 07:00 and the Allied quick-reaction force of the British light cruiser and the Italian scout cruiser , escorted by five French destroyers, sortied in an attempt to cut off the Austro-Hungarian ships from their base at Cattaro. These were followed two hours later by the Italian scout cruiser , the British light cruiser and four Italian destroyers. Seitz had ordered Triglavs crew taken off before any of the columns of smoke from these ships were spotted by his ships and he ordered Tátra to drop her tow at 13:15 and abandon Triglav. Five minutes later the Austro-Hungarian ships were spotted and the French destroyers were ordered to deal with Triglav at 13:38 while the cruisers pursued Seitz's ships.Cernuschi & O'Hara 2015, p. 165; Halpern 1994, pp. 156–157; Noppen, p. 61; O'Hara & Heinz, pp. 157–159 Csepel on the right, followed by Balaton and Tátra, returning after the 1st Battle of Durazzo, 30 December 1915 Seitz turned southwest at to put as much distance between his ships and their pursuers although Dartmouth opened fire at her maximum range of at 13:43 and scored her first hit on Helgoland twelve minutes later. The destroyers were generally not engaged during this battle, being further away, although Csepel was hit once with little effect. Despite further hits on the cruiser which reduced her speed to the Austro-Hungarians were able to disengage before reaching the Italian coast when darkness fell around 17:30. Tátra had a machinery breakdown at 18:45 that reduced her speed to , but she reached Sebenico safely with the rest of Seitz's ships.Cernuschi & O'Hara 2015, pp. 165, 169; Halpern 1994, p. 157; Noppen, pp. 61–62; O'Hara & Heinz, pp. 158–161 On 4 July 1916 Helgoland, Tátra, Orjen and Balaton raided the barrage, but could not find any targets in the poor visibility. Tátra was refitting 1–31 December in Pola and had a pair of boilers replaced. On the night of 11/12 March 1917, Tátra, Orjen, Csepel and Balaton swept through the Strait of Otranto, but failed to sink the French cargo ship that they encountered. Tátra did not directly participate in the Battle of the Strait of Otranto on 14–15 May, but was one of the reinforcing ships that caused the Allied ships to break off the action. The ship was returned to Pola on 26 May for a refit that lasted until 13 August; it included replacing a boiler. Helgoland and all of the Tátras attempted to duplicate the success of the earlier raid on 18–19 October, but they were spotted by Italian aircraft and turned back in the face of substantial Allied reinforcements alerted by the aircraft. On the night of 13 December, Tátra, Balaton and Csepel raided the Otranto Barrage, but disengaged after firing torpedoes at what they believed to be four Allied destroyers, although there is no record of any attacks that night in Allied records.Bilzer, p. 116–117; Cernuschi & O'Hara 2016, pp. 62, 67–69; Halpern 2004, pp. 133–134; Noppen, pp. 74–75; O'Hara & Heinz, pp. 206, 260, 262, 265, 268–269 The smaller ships in the Austro-Hungarian Navy were the most active ones and their crews had the highest morale; most of the larger ships did little but swing on their moorings which did nothing to improve the morale of their crews. On 1 February 1918, the Cattaro Mutiny broke out, starting aboard the armored cruiser . The mutineers rapidly gained control of Kaiser Karl VI and most of the other major warships in the harbor. Unhappy with the failure of the smaller ships' crews to join the mutiny, the mutineers threatened to fire at any ship that failed to hoist a red flag. Tátras crew hoisted a flag with the permission of her captain with the proviso that there should be no disturbances aboard ship. The following day, many of the mutinous ships abandoned the effort after coast- defense guns loyal to the government opened fire on the rebel guard ship . The scout cruisers and Tátra, among other ships, took advantage of the confusion to rejoin loyalist forces in the inner harbor where they were protected by coastal artillery. The next morning, the s arrived from Pola and put down the uprising.Bilzer, p. 117; Halpern 2004b, pp. 48–50, 52–53; Sondhaus 1994, p. 322 The ship was based in Pola from 7 April to 6 June and returned to Cattaro the following day in preparation for an attack on the Otranto Barrage by the bulk of Austro-Hungarian Fleet on 10 June. The operation was canceled after the battleship was sunk by Italian motor torpedo boats as she steamed south to rendezvous with the forces in Cattaro. Tátra and Orjen provided security to the hospital ship that had run aground on 13 October. Tátra transported Seitz to Pola on 30 October.Bilzer, pp. 116–117 End of the war By October it had become clear that Austria-Hungary was facing defeat in the war. With various attempts to quell nationalist sentiments failing, Emperor Karl I decided to sever Austria-Hungary's alliance with Germany and appeal to the Allies in an attempt to preserve the empire from complete collapse. On 26 October Austria-Hungary informed Germany that their alliance was over. At the same time, the Austro-Hungarian Navy was in the process of tearing itself apart along ethnic and nationalist lines. Vice Admiral Miklós Horthy was informed on the morning of 28 October that an armistice was imminent, and used this news to maintain order and prevent a mutiny among the fleet. While a mutiny was spared, tensions remained high and morale was at an all-time low.Sondhaus 1994, pp. 350–351 The following day the National Council in Zagreb announced Croatia's dynastic ties to Hungary had come to an end. This new provisional government, while throwing off Hungarian rule, had not yet declared independence from Austria-Hungary. Thus Emperor Karl I's government in Vienna asked the newly formed State of Slovenes, Croats and Serbs for help maintaining the fleet stationed at Pola and keeping order among the navy. The National Council refused to assist unless the Austro-Hungarian Navy was first placed under its command. Emperor Karl I, still attempting to save the Empire from collapse, agreed to the transfer, provided that the other \\"nations\\" which made up Austria-Hungary would be able to claim their fair share of the value of the fleet at a later time. All sailors not of Slovene, Croatian, Bosnian, or Serbian background were placed on leave for the time being, while the officers were given the choice of joining the new navy or retiring.Sokol, pp. 136–137, 139; Sondhaus 1994, pp. 351–352 The Austro-Hungarian government thus decided to hand over the bulk of its fleet, preferring to do that rather than give the fleet to the Allies, as the new state had declared its neutrality. Furthermore, the newly formed state had also not yet publicly rejected Emperor Karl I, keeping the possibility of reforming the Empire into a triple monarchy alive.Halpern 1994, p. 177; Sokol 1968, pp. 136–137, 139; Sondhaus 1994, pp. 353–354 Post-war On 3 November the Austro-Hungarian government signed the Armistice of Villa Giusti with Italy, ending the fighting along the Italian Front,Sieche 1985a, p. 329 although it refused to recognize the transfer of Austria-Hungary's warships. As a result, on 4 November, Italian ships sailed into the ports of Trieste, Pola, and Fiume and Italian troops occupied the naval installations at Pola the following day. The National Council did not order any men to resist the Italians, but they also condemned Italy's actions as illegitimate. On 9 November, all remaining ships in Pola harbour had the Italian flag raised. At a conference at Corfu, the Allies agreed the transfer could not be accepted, despite sympathy from the United Kingdom.Sieche 1985b, pp. 137–140 Faced with the prospect of being given an ultimatum to surrender the former Austro-Hungarian warships, the National Council agreed to hand over the ships beginning on 10 November.Sondhaus 1994, pp. 357–359 On 23 March 1919, the Italians sailed the ship to Venice together with several other former Austro-Hungarian warships and displayed them in a victory parade the following day. When the Allies divided up the Austro- Hungarian Fleet amongst themselves in January 1920, Tátra was awarded to Italy. She was reamed Fasana on 27 September and towed to Pola on 16 October to provide spare parts for her sisters. The ship was discarded on 5 July 1923 and subsequently scrapped.Bilzer, p. 117; Sieche 1985b, pp. 138–140 Notes Citations  Bibliography       * Category:Tátra-class destroyers Category:1912 ships ","title":"SMS Tátra"},{"id":"60110220","text":"Heath (Welsh: Y Mynydd Bychan) is the name of an electoral ward in the north of the city of Cardiff, Wales, which covers its namesake community, Heath.

In 1989 she left the association and In 1996 she founded another association called Anahí (in honor of Clara Anahí Mariani who disappeared from Grandmothers of Plaza de Mayo. In 2007, the Legislature of the City of Buenos Aires awarded her a diploma of honor for her work on human rights. Biography In 1951 de Mariani married bandmaster and violinist Enrique José Mariani (1921-2003), until his death. During the military dictatorship (1976-1983), on November 24, 1976, the security forces attacked de Marian's house and her son Daniel Mariani and his daughter-in-law Diana Teruggi, in La Plata. As a result of militia forces of Montoneros attack, her daughter-in-law died, and the militants kidnapped a three months baby, Clara Anahí,and in the following year maria's son was also murdered by the Montoneros. Right after de Marian has informed that her granddaughter survived under the attacker, Maria Isabel began searching to find her granddaughter alone. She searched all the barracks, police stations, courts, without achieving any results, and in many cases she was being mistreated or threatened to do so.Monsignor Emilio Graselli, from the Catholic Church, confirmed that her granddaughter was alive,but at the same time she has informed that the Church was not willing to intervene in the release of her granddaughter. In the second half of 1977, de Marian became acquainted with Alicia Licha Zubasnabar who was from De la Cuadra, and La Plata, and they decided to create an organization of grandmothers to look after their disappeared grandchildren. Grandmothers of the Plaza de Mayo After the coup d'état of March 24, 1976, the mothers whom their grand children were kidnapped and missing founded a human rights organization with the goal of finding the children stolen and illegally adopted during the Argentine dictatorship. Estela Barnes de Carlotto and de Mariani both were founders of this organization and de Marian was the second president of the Grandmothers of the Plaza de Mayo. It was founded in 1977 to locate children kidnapped during the repression, some of them born to mothers in prison who were later \\"disappeared\\", and to return the children to their surviving biological families.Juan Ignacio Irigaray, \\"Los santos inocentes\\", El Mundo, 11 June 1998 Anahí Association In 1989, due to difference between the members of Grandmothers of the Plaza de Mayo, de Marian left the Association.

The day of the attack Daniel Mariani had left house for the work in Buenos Aires, For about eight months he fought for the organization Montoneros clandestinity. On August 1, 1977,he was murdered while he was with her fellow militant Laura Carlotto. On the walls and ceilings of Mariani-Teruggi House, you can still see the impact of the bullets and the blood of the people murdered there.

The Parliament of Canada's Ethics Commissioner Mario Dion found that Trudeau improperly influenced then Minister of Justice and Attorney General Jody Wilson-Raybould to intervene in an ongoing criminal case against Quebec-based construction company SNC- Lavalin. The Trudeau government has maintained that there was no undue pressure or law broken, that offering SNC-Lavalin a deferred prosecution agreement (DPA) could save jobs, and that the controversy resulted from a misunderstanding and an \\"erosion of trust\\". The affair became public when The Globe and Mail published an article uncovering the allegations on 7 February 2019, shortly after Wilson-Raybould had been shuffled to another cabinet position. Four days later, Ethics Commissioner Dion announced he would investigate the allegations. Wilson-Raybould resigned from cabinet later that day. This was followed by the resignation of Gerald Butts, the Principal Secretary to Trudeau. This was then followed by the resignation of fellow Liberal cabinet minister Jane Philpott, over the government's handling of the affair. The House of Commons' Justice Committee held three hearings into the affair. Wilson-Raybould, Butts, and Michael Wernick, Clerk of the Privy Council testified before the committee. Wilson-Raybould said there was a breach of prosecutorial independence when members of the government pressured her to offer SNC-Lavalin a DPA instead of continuing with a criminal prosecution. Butts and Wernick testified that they had contacted Wilson- Raybould to find a \\"political solution\\" after the decision to not offer SNC- Lavalin a DPA was made. Controversially, Wilson-Raybould revealed that she had secretly recorded a conversation she had with Wernick while she was Attorney General. Following the hearings, Wernick announced his early retirement from the Privy Council. Leader of the Official Opposition Andrew Scheer called for Trudeau's resignation. He further accused Trudeau of political interference, lying to Canadians, and corrupt conduct. Trudeau responded to those comments with a threat of a libel lawsuit through his lawyer. Opposition parties and former attorneys-general asked the Royal Canadian Mounted Police (RCMP) to investigate whether Trudeau's conduct qualifies as obstruction of justice. In April, Trudeau expelled Wilson-Raybould and Philpott from the Liberal caucus. After a six-month-long investigation, Ethics Commissioner Dion issued a report that concluded that Trudeau had contravened Section 9 of the federal Conflict of Interest Act by improperly pressuring Wilson-Raybould. Dion wrote that while Wilson-Raybould was never officially directed to interfere, this influence was \\"tantamount to political direction\\". Dion did not find that any actual political interference in the prosecution occurred; however, he reported he did not have access to all of the evidence. Under the Act, there are no sanctions specified for the violation. After the commissioner's report was released, the Prime Minister released a statement both taking responsibility for and defending his actions. The opposition leaders have called for further investigations. Background SNC-Lavalin bribery charges SNC-Lavalin's Board of Directors became aware of financial irregularities concerning the company's activities in Libya by early 2009. The board raised concerns about the cost of a trip that Al-Saadi Gaddafi took to Canada in 2008—totalling $1.9 million—which SNC-Lavalin paid for. The board issued Stéphane Roy, the company's financial controller, a \\"serious warning\\" for the size of the Gaddafi bill. The board had also expressed concerns about the amounts of cash kept by SNC's Libyan office—at that time approximately $10 million—according to the company's chief financial officer. In May 2009, the board ordered that no more than $1 million in cash should be kept in the company's safe in Libya. On 19 February 2015, the Royal Canadian Mounted Police (RCMP) and the Public Prosecution Service of Canada (PPSC) laid charges against SNC-Lavalin Group Inc. and two of its subsidiaries: SNC-Lavalin International Inc. and SNC-Lavalin Construction Inc. Each firm was charged with one count of fraud under section 380 of the Criminal Code, and one count of corruption under Section 3(1)(b) of the Corruption of Foreign Public Officials Act. The charges allege that between 2001 and 2011, SNC-Lavalin paid CA$48 million in bribes in Libya to officials in the government of Muammar Gaddafi. They also allege that at the same time, the company defrauded Libyan organizations of CA$130 million. On the same day, SNC-Lavalin announced that they were contesting the charges and planned to enter a non-guilty plea. In Canada, bidders for contracts with Public Services and Procurement Canada must conform to the Integrity Regime legislation passed in July 2015. The Integrity Regime is designed to exclude suppliers that have ethics-related criminal convictions, such as bribery, price fixing, or lobbying offences. If convicted, SNC-Lavalin could be banned from bidding on federal government contracts for up to ten years. Following the 2015 Canadian federal election, with a Liberal government led by Justin Trudeau coming into power, SNC-Lavalin lobbied the government to change the Criminal Code so that they could avoid criminal prosecution. The effort lasted twenty months, and involved fifty-one meetings with government officials and MPs, as well as officials in the opposition party leaders' offices and in the newly elected Coalition Avenir Québec government. Targets of SNC-Lavalin's lobbying included the Minister of Public Services and Procurement and Accessibility, Carla Qualtrough, as well as officials in the Prime Minister's Office (PMO). The company advocated for the rapid adoption of legislation to allow a new type of sentencing agreement called deferred prosecution agreement (DPA) and changes to Ottawa's Integrity Regime to amend the 10-year contract ineligibility for suppliers with ethics- related criminal convictions. On recommendation from the Director of Public Prosecutions (DPP) Kathleen Roussel, former SNC-Lavalin Executive Vice President Normand Morin was charged in the Court of Quebec in May 2018 with making illegal donations to Canadian federal political parties. The charges, which were unrelated to the federal charges against the company, alleging that from 2004 to 2011, Morin orchestrated and solicited political donations from employees or their spouses to Canadian federal political parties anonymously on behalf of SNC-Lavalin, to be reimbursed afterwards. The amounts paid included about CA$110,000 to the Liberal Party and CA$8,000 to other Canadian political parties. In November 2018, Morin pleaded guilty to two of the five charges, and was fined $2,000. The remaining three charges were dropped by the prosecution. On 9 October 2018, SNC-Lavalin received a letter from the DPP, informing the company that a decision had been made to not invite the company to negotiate a DPA. The reasons cited in the letter were the \\"nature and gravity\\" of the case, \\"degree of involvement of senior officers of the organization\\", and that SNC-Lavalin \\"did not self-report\\" the alleged crimes. Later in 2018, SNC-Lavalin brought a case to the Federal Court to compel the Public Prosecution Service to offer it a DPA. In a decision issued on 8 March 2019, the court analysed DPA legislation and affirmed that a decision not to offer a DPA is within the discretion of the prosecutor. As part of the ruling, the court reaffirmed the principle of prosecutorial independence, and SNC- Lavalin's application to compel a DPA was rejected as having \\"no reasonable prospect of success\\". Introduction of deferred prosecution agreements In June 2018, Prime Minister Justin Trudeau's government passed an omnibus budget bill which contained amendments to the Criminal Code. The changes introduced a type of sentencing agreement called a deferred prosecution agreement (DPA). Through a DPA, sentencing and remediation agreements are negotiated, under the supervision of a judge, between federal prosecuting authorities and a corporation charged with an offence, usually in the context of fraud or corruption. Following approval and successful completion of the terms of the agreement, a company may apply for a judicial stay of criminal proceedings, and thereby avoid a criminal prosecution, trial, and penalties. The inclusion of the Criminal Code amendments in the budget legislation raised concerns from MPs from both the Liberal party and opposition parties. Liberal MP Greg Fergus told the House of Commons Finance Committee he was concerned the change appeared to be designed to give corporations implicated in financial crimes \\"a little slap on the wrist\\", saying, \\"It seems we're letting those with the means have an easier time of it than those who don't have the means.\\" According to New Democratic Party (NDP) MP Pierre-Luc Dusseault, the government was not willing to split the Criminal Code amendments from the budget to be passed as a separate bill. Dusseault also said he thought the change was intended to be made quietly. A spokesman for then-Justice Minister Raybould said prosecutors would be responsible to decide whether a company is eligible for the agreements and negotiate the terms, operating at arm's length from the government. Prosecutorial independence Prosecutorial independence is a principle of Canadian constitutional law. In Miazga v Kvello Estate, the Supreme Court of Canada held that, \\"The independence of the Attorney General is so fundamental to the integrity and efficiency of the criminal justice system that it is constitutionally entrenched. The principle of independence requires that the Attorney General act independently of political pressures from the government.\\" Similarly, in Krieger v Law Society of Alberta, the Supreme Court held, \\"It is a constitutional principle that the Attorneys General of this country must act independently of partisan concerns when exercising their delegated sovereign authority to initiate, continue or terminate prosecutions.\\" The role of the Attorney General of Canada is bound by the so-called \\"Shawcross principle\\", based on a statement by Lord Shawcross in 1951. The principle (or doctrine) states that the Attorney General must take into account matters of public interest, that assistance from cabinet colleagues must be limited to advice, that responsibility for the decision is that of the Attorney General alone, and that the government is not to put pressure on him or her. In practice, prosecutorial independence is enforced by maintaining an independent office responsible for prosecutions. Until 2006, Canada's Federal Prosecution Service was located within the Department of Justice, making it vulnerable to political interference by the Prime Minister or Cabinet. The Public Prosecution Service of Canada was established in 2006, following the enactment of the Director of Public Prosecutions Act, as an agency independent of the Department of Justice. Under the Act, the DPP is responsible for all federal criminal prosecutions. However, the Attorney General can issue a directive to the DPP regarding an ongoing prosecution or take control of a prosecution. Such directives must be provided in writing and published as a notice in the Canada Gazette, the official newspaper of the Government of Canada. Discovery and initial reactions On 7 February 2019, The Globe and Mail reported on allegations made by unnamed sources that beginning in October 2018, the Prime Minister's Office (PMO) put pressure on then-Minister of Justice and Attorney General Jody Wilson-Raybould to intervene in ongoing criminal proceedings against SNC-Lavalin to offer the company a deferred prosecution agreement. Wilson-Raybould refused. Allowing the resignation of Scott Brison, she was moved to the Veterans Affairs Ministry in a Cabinet shuffle on 14 January 2019. The move was widely seen as a demotion, and there was speculation at the time about the reason for it. At the time, both Trudeau and Wilson-Raybould denied she had been demoted. The article stated that after charges were brought against SNC-Lavalin in October 2017, the company approached officials in Ottawa, including members of the Prime Minister's Office, to secure a DPA. A criminal verdict against SNC- Lavalin would lead to the company being barred from federal contracts for 10 years, and possibly result in its bankruptcy. According to the article, sources in the Liberal Party said Wilson-Raybould knew the DPA legislation in the Criminal Code was intended to help SNC-Lavalin avoid a criminal conviction. The Director of Public Prosecutions, Kathleen Roussel, had rejected the request for a DPA in October 2018. As Attorney General, Wilson- Raybould had the power to overrule that decision, and would have had to do so in writing in the Canada Gazette. According to the article, sources claimed that Wilson-Raybould had refused to overrule Roussel's rejection because she trusted Roussel's judgment, and she wanted to avoid even the perception of political interference. The Prime Minister's office said in an email to The Globe and Mail that it had not directed the attorney-general to draw any conclusions on the matter. In the days following the publication of the article in The Globe and Mail, opposition party politicians and the media questioned whether the reason for Wilson-Raybould's removal was her refusal to prevent criminal prosecution of SNC-Lavalin. Trudeau denied the allegations, telling reporters, \\"The allegations reported in the story are false.\\" He stated, \\"At no time did I or my office direct the current or previous attorney-general to make any particular decision in this matter.\\" Wilson- Raybould's replacement as Minister of Justice and Attorney General, David Lametti, said in the House of Commons that the Prime Minister's office had not given directives to or put pressure on either of them. Wilson-Raybould would not comment on the article, saying she was bound by solicitor-client privilege. On 11 February, responding to a request by NDP MPs, the Conflict of Interest and Ethics Commissioner of the Parliament of Canada Mario Dion said he would open an investigation into the allegations of political interference by the PMO. In a letter to NDP ethics critic Charlie Angus and MP Nathan Cullen, Dion said he had \\"reason to believe that a possible contravention of section 9 [of the Conflict of Interest Act] may have occurred\\". That section bars public officials from attempting to influence decisions which could \\"improperly further another person's private interests\\". Wilson-Raybould resignation In a press conference, the same day as the ethics investigation was announced, Trudeau said he had full confidence in Wilson-Raybould and that they had spoken the previous fall, when he told her directly that decisions regarding the DPP were hers alone. Trudeau also said he respected her view that she could not comment due to privilege, adding, \\"I also highlight that we're bound by cabinet confidentiality. In our system of governance, her presence in cabinet should speak for itself.\\" Wilson-Raybould resigned from Cabinet that evening. In her resignation letter released the following day on 12 February, Wilson-Raybould reaffirmed her commitment to serving in Parliament, saying she had retained Thomas Cromwell, the retired Supreme Court of Canada Justice, and was getting advice on what she was legally allowed to discuss publicly. Trudeau said he was \\"puzzled and obviously disappointed\\" by the resignation, telling reporters that \\"if anyone, particularly the attorney- general, felt that we were not doing our job responsibly and according to all the rules as a government, it was her responsibility to come forward to me this past fall and highlight that directly to me. She did not.\\" In response to the developing events, the House of Commons Justice Committee met on 13 February to vote on hearing testimony from the PMO officials involved, as well as Wilson-Raybould herself. What would be the first of multiple hearings originally only had Lametti, Deputy Minister of Justice Nathalie Drouin, and Michael Wernick as witnesses, as the Liberal majority on the committee blocked attempts by opposition party MPs to have Wilson-Raybould testify. Three days after the press conference where Trudeau said Wilson-Raybould had not talked to him about any concerns, on 15 February, Trudeau told reporters that Wilson- Raybould had come to him the previous fall to ask if he was directing her to make a particular decision on the file, but that he had told her the decision was her own. During the same press conference, he denied again that Wilson- Raybould's removal from the Attorney General position was due to her refusal to drop prosecution of SNC-Lavalin, saying, \\"If Scott Brison had not stepped down from cabinet, Jody Wilson-Raybould would still be minister of justice and attorney-general of Canada.\\" Anonymous sources told The Canadian Press agency that Wilson-Raybould \\"had become a thorn in the side of the cabinet, someone insiders say was difficult to get along with, known to berate fellow cabinet ministers openly at the table\\". The Union of British Columbia Indian Chiefs argued that this was a \\"racist and sexist\\" attack on Wilson-Raybould, prompting Trudeau to apologize for the remarks. Hearings During an emergency meeting on 13 February 2019, the Liberal-dominated Justice Committee of the House of Commons voted down opposition parties' bids to hear from the former attorney general and key members of the Prime Minister's Office, stating that the role of the committee is \\"not an investigative body\\". Instead, it was proposed to study some of the legal issues at the heart of the matter, such as the Shawcross doctrine and deferred prosecution agreements. As a result, only current Justice Minister David Lametti, Deputy Justice Minister Nathalie Drouin, and Privy Council Clerk Michael Wernick were originally invited to testify. The Senate of Canada debated a 28 February motion to launch its own study into the affair, but it was not endorsed by the majority of Senators. Hearing on 21 February 2019 In response to the claims, the Justice Committee held a series of three public hearings on the alleged interference. Wernick, the Clerk of the Privy Council, appeared before the committee. He disputed the allegations of undue pressure on Wilson-Raybould and stated that The Globe and Mail article contained errors and unfounded speculation. Hearing on 27 February 2019 Wilson-Raybould testified before the committee, corroborating the report by The Globe and Mail and detailing the alleged political interference. In her prepared statement, Wilson-Raybould said: Wilson-Raybould provided details and dates of the meetings, and named eleven people involved with the alleged efforts to interfere, including Trudeau, Wernick, Gerald Butts, Katie Telford, Bill Morneau, and other high-ranking officials in the PMO and the Minister of Finance's office. Despite the attempts to convince her to reconsider her stance given the possible economic and political consequences, Wilson-Raybould said she was \\"undaunted in her position to not pursue a Deferred Prosecution Agreement\\". She maintains the belief that despite the pressure she felt, she did not believe what transpired was illegal. When asked why she did not resign from her position during the time she said improper pressure was being applied, Wilson-Raybould said: \\"I was, in my opinion, doing my job as the attorney general. I was protecting a fundamental constitutional principle of prosecutorial independence and the independence of our judiciary. That's the job of the attorney general.\\" Wilson-Raybould also reiterated that Order in Council leaves in place various constraints that prevent her from speaking freely about matters that occurred after she left the post of Attorney General, communications while she was Minister of Veterans Affairs, her resignation from that post, and her presentation to Cabinet after her resignation. She stated that she would be willing to testify further if released from those restrictions. Trudeau gave a short press conference in Montreal following the hearings on 27 February, denying the allegations. \\"I and my staff always acted appropriately and professionally\\", he said. \\"I completely disagree with the characterization of the former attorney general about these events ... The decision around SNC-Lavalin was Ms. Wilson- Raybould's and hers alone. This decision is the attorney general's alone.\\" Hearing on 6 March 2019 Gerald Butts, the former Principal Secretary to Justin Trudeau On 6 March 2019, the Justice Committee held a hearing on the claims, at which Butts testified. Butts, who had been implicated in the affair by Wilson-Raybould at the previous hearing, served as the Principal Secretary to Trudeau in the PMO. During his testimony, Butts said that he did not want to discredit Wilson-Raybould's testimony, but wanted to offer his own \\"different version of events\\". He stated he believed that \\"nothing inappropriate occurred\\" and that \\"nothing inappropriate was alleged to have occurred until after the cabinet shuffle\\". Butts said that any conversations between Wilson-Raybould and officials in the PMO were intended only to ensure that she understood the full potential impact of a criminal conviction of SNC- Lavalin and that at no time did anyone in the PMO attempt to influence Wilson- Raybould's decision. \\"It was not about second-guessing the decision. It was about ensuring that the attorney general was making her decision with the absolute best evidence possible\\", Butts testified. Butts also testified that he believed a period of twelve days was too compressed for such an important decision. Butts further stated that no concerns were raised by Wilson-Raybould until after 12 January cabinet shuffle had occurred: \\"If this was wrong, and wrong in the way it is alleged to have been wrong, why are we having this discussion now and not in the middle of September, or October, or November, or December?\\" Liberal members of the committee defeated a motion to produce all government communications between Butts and other parties mentioned in the SNC-Lavalin affair. At the hearing, Wernick testified for a second time, and stated that the decision to consider a DPA is never final, and that he was only reminding Wilson-Raybould to take public interest considerations into account. Deputy Justice Minister Nathalie Drouin also testified at the hearing. When asked, Drouin stated that it was not for her to say if the time taken for the due diligence review was adequate or not, and that she was not part of the due diligence exercise carried out by Wilson-Raybould regarding this case. Drouin also replied that \\"It's the responsibility of a prosecutor to assess and reassess ... in light of new facts and evidence put in front of the prosecutor.\\" Drouin also said that at the end of October 2018, the Privy Council Office (PCO) asked her department for advice on the potential impact on SNC-Lavalin if a deferred prosecution agreement was not pursued. That advice was \\"not provided to PCO at the request of the minister's office\\". Following Butts' testimony, Trudeau gave a press conference in Ottawa on 7 March. He again denied all allegations of inappropriate or illegal pressure, and said that an \\"erosion of trust\\" and \\"breakdown in communications\\" had developed between him, his staff and the former Attorney General. Trudeau also confirmed that during a 17 September meeting he asked Wilson-Raybould to \\"revisit her decision\\" not to negotiate an out-of-court settlement with SNC- Lavalin, and asked his staff to follow up regarding Wilson-Raybould's final decision. Hearing on 13 March 2019 During the Committee hearing, Liberal MPs blocked an effort by opposition party members to immediately invite Wilson-Raybould back to speak further about the government's effort to put pressure on her, despite the former justice minister's willingness to testify again. Instead, Liberal members voted to reconvene the Justice Committee in- camera on 19 March to consider whether to invite Wilson-Raybould and other senior government officials to testify. Conclusion of Justice Committee hearings On 19 March 2019, the Justice Committee held an in-camera meeting where Liberal members introduced and passed a motion to end any further probe into the SNC-Lavalin scandal, indicating that they preferred to leave any remaining investigation to the ethics commissioner. In a written letter to the committee chair, the Liberal members stated that \\"No witness was prevented from providing evidence on any relevant information during the period covered by the waiver\\", and concluded that \\"Canadians can judge for themselves the facts, the perspectives and relevant legal principles\\". In total, the Justice Committee held eleven meetings over five weeks, accumulating thirteen hours of testimony from ten different witnesses. The committee did not hear from some individuals implicated in the controversy by Wilson-Raybould, including Katie Telford (Trudeau's chief of staff) and senior staffers Ben Chin, Elder Marques, and Mathieu Bouchard. The Conservative Party and New Democratic Party also maintain that Wilson-Raybould should have been called back to committee to respond to testimony from Wernick and Butts. Further submissions from Wilson-Raybould On 29 March, the Justice Committee released a recording, made secretly by Wilson-Raybould, of the telephone call between her and Wernick that took place on 19 December 2018. In it, Wernick told Wilson- Raybould that Trudeau wanted a DPA for SNC-Lavalin \\"one way or another\\". Wilson-Raybould responded that the request was inappropriate political interference in the justice system and that she was not comfortable having the conversation. The recording was accompanied by a submission of forty pages supplementing her original testimony, including copies of texts and emails, outlining Wilson-Raybould's view of events and their implications for prosecutorial independence. In her submission, she also explained that her decision to resign from the cabinet was prompted by Trudeau's suggestion the day earlier that \\"her continued presence in his cabinet speaks for itself\\". The PMO responded that Wernick never briefed Trudeau on this conversation. Wernick said that he did not brief the Prime Minister on the call due to the Holiday season break, and that he did not discuss SNC again with the PMO until the story was leaked in early February. Reactions and aftermath On 11 February 2019, after mounting pressure from the Conservatives and NDP, Mario Dion, the Parliament of Canada's Ethics Commissioner, launched a federal investigation into the alleged interference. The scope of the ethics review is to look into any possible contravention of rules prohibiting public office holders from using their position to influence decisions that could further another person's private interest. Elizabeth May, the leader of the Green Party, called for an independent, RCMP-led investigation into the allegations, stating that the \\"Ethics Commissioner is not the right place to seek such an inquiry; neither is the justice committee\\". Following the Justice Committee hearings on 27 February, Opposition Leader Andrew Scheer called for Trudeau's resignation, saying that he had \\"lost the moral authority to govern\\". On 28 February, Scheer sent a letter to RCMP Commissioner Brenda Lucki, calling for an investigation into Trudeau's actions in relation to the controversy. Five former attorneys-general called on the RCMP to investigate possible obstruction of justice. On 11 March, the OECD Working Group on Bribery, of which Canada is a member, wrote to the Canadian government outlining its concerns about potential political interference in the case, and saying that it would \\"closely monitor investigations into the SNC-Lavalin affair by the House of Commons justice committee and the federal ethics commissioner\\". The Working Group did clarify it had no reason to doubt the approach the Canadian government is taking, and noted Canada's willingness to keep it fully informed of the proceedings at its next meeting in June 2019. On 18 March, Trudeau announced that former Deputy Prime Minister Anne McLellan would serve as a Special Advisor to examine whether a single minister should continue to hold the positions of Minister of Justice and Attorney General. The advisor would also analyze the current roles, policies, and practices of government officials who interact with the Attorney General. McLellan was to report her recommendations to the Prime Minister by 30 June 2019. Following 19 March Justice Committee meeting, opposition parties asked the House of Commons Ethics Committee to launch its own investigation into the affair, and called for Wilson-Raybould to testify at the committee by no later than 27 March. This motion was defeated on 26 March by the Liberal majority on the committee. The Conservative Party protested the decision of the Justice Committee to conclude its proceedings by forcing an all-night session of the House of Commons. On 20 March, the CEO of SNC-Lavalin, Neil Bruce, stated in an interview with The Globe and Mail that the company was \\"fully reformed\\" and \\"does not understand why it was not given a deal\\". Bruce said that Canadians had appeared to have \\"given up\\" on SNC-Lavalin and that the general public does not understand the potential economic consequences of a ten-year ban on federal contracts. On 28 March, a presentation was obtained by The Canadian Press press agency which described SNC-Lavalin's \\"Plan B\\" if they could not secure a remediation agreement. The plan, provided to Public Prosecution Service of Canada last fall, included moving its Montreal headquarters to the United States within a year, reducing its workforce, and eventually winding down Canadian operations. A spokesperson for the company confirmed its authenticity, calling it a \\"confidential document\\" and maintaining that a DPA is \\"the best way to protect and grow the almost 9,000 direct Canadian SNC- Lavalin jobs, as well as thousands of indirect jobs\\". On 7 April 2019, Conservative leader Andrew Scheer made public a letter he had received on 31 March from Prime Minister Justin Trudeau's lawyer Julian Porter, which threatened a libel suit regarding statements Scheer made on 29 March that accused Trudeau of political interference, lying to Canadians, and corrupt conduct. Scheer stood by his comments, describing the letter as an \\"intimidation tactic\\" and saying, \\"If Mr. Trudeau believes he has a case against me, I urge him to follow through on his threat immediately.\\" On 18 December 2019, SNC-Lavalin Construction Inc. pleaded guilty to fraud contrary to section 380(1) a) of the Criminal Code. The company stated that, between 2001 and 2011, over $47.5 million in bribes had been paid to Al-Saadi Gaddafi. The money was directed through two representative companies, both listing former SLCI vice-president and president Riadh Ben Aissa as the sole beneficial owner. In return for the payments, Al-Saadi Gaddafi applied his influence to secure construction contracts for SNC-Lavalin Construction. Payments of personal benefits totalling over $73.5 million were also made through the representative companies to Ben Aissa and Sami Bebawi, former president of SLCI. As part of its plea agreement with the Public Prosecution Service, SLCI was fined $280 million. Leaked information regarding Supreme Court recommendation On 25 March 2019, CTV News reported that there was a conflict between Wilson-Raybould and Trudeau in 2017 when Trudeau disagreed with a recommendation by Wilson-Raybould to appoint Glenn Joyal to the Supreme Court of Canada, replacing Beverley McLachlin as the Chief Justice of Canada. The report suggests the Prime Minister could have had reasons unrelated to the SNC-Lavalin affair for moving Wilson-Raybould out of the Justice portfolio. Wilson-Raybould denied there was any conflict with Trudeau over the Supreme Court recommendation. Trudeau and Wilson-Raybould both condemned the leaks and denied that they were the source. The Privacy Commissioner of Canada launched an investigation into the leak of confidential information on 4 April, after receiving a request from opposition parties. The investigation will include organizations covered by the Privacy Act, such as the Privy Council Office and the Department of Justice. The Privacy Act covers neither ministerial offices nor the PMO. Resignations Gerald Butts resigned as the Principal Secretary to Prime Minister Trudeau on 18 February 2019. When resigning, he denied that Wilson-Raybould had been pressured, saying that the accusation that he had pressured Wilson-Raybould was distracting from the work of the PMO. Jane Philpott, the President of the Treasury Board, resigned from her post in Trudeau's cabinet on 4 March in solidarity with Wilson-Raybould. In her statement she said that she had \\"lost confidence in how the government has dealt with this matter and in how it has responded to the issues raised\\". Philpott was considered to be one of Trudeau's most trusted ministers. Philpott, then the health minister, had worked together with Wilson-Raybould on the assisted-dying legislation passed in 2016. Michael Wernick announced on 18 March that he would be retiring ahead of schedule from his position as the Clerk of the Privy Council and Secretary to Cabinet \\"due to recent events\\", namely the erosion of trust and being seen as partisan; which would affect the civil service as a whole and cast doubt on his position should an opposition party form the next government. On 18 April, Wernick retired as Privy Council clerk. Party expulsions On 29 March, CBC published an article saying that the Liberal caucus in the House of Commons was planning to vote on expelling Wilson-Raybould and Philpott. Caucus members said they did not think Wilson-Raybould and Philpott could remain party members, \\"given the damage done to the government by the SNC-Lavalin affair\\". Liberal MPs criticized Wilson-Raybould's release of the phone call recording, with Minister of Tourism Mélanie Joly describing it as \\"fundamentally wrong\\" and the former Solicitor General under Jean Chrétien, Wayne Fox, calling it \\"about as low as you can go\\". Prime Minister Trudeau did not state a position on the vote, saying, \\"As for what Dr. Philpott and Ms. Wilson-Raybould intend to do as next steps, people are going to have to ask them\\". The day the vote was scheduled to proceed, Wilson-Raybould wrote a letter to the caucus arguing that she should remain a member, saying \\"Ultimately the choice that is before you is about what kind of party you want to be a part of, what values it will uphold, the vision that animates it, and indeed the type of people it will attract and make it up.\\" Ultimately, no recorded caucus vote was held. Trudeau expelled Wilson-Raybould and Philpott from the Liberal Caucus on 2 April 2019. He also removed Wilson-Raybould and Philpott as the Liberal party candidates for Vancouver Granville and Markham—Stouffville respectively in the 2019 Canadian federal election. At a press conference, Trudeau said that trust between the two women and the rest of the Liberal caucus had been broken, calling Wilson- Raybould's recording \\"unconscionable\\". He also talked about the danger of \\"civil wars within parties\\", saying \\"Our political opponents win when Liberals are divided. We can't afford to make that mistake. Canadians are counting on us.\\" After she was informed of the decision, Wilson-Raybould stated she has no regrets, and did what she thought \\"needed to be done based on principles and values that must always transcend party\\". On the same day, Philpott said she was \\"stunned\\" at having been expelled without being given a chance to speak to the national caucus, and that the attacks on her and Wilson Raybould had been based on \\"inaccuracies and falsehoods\\". The decision was condemned by all opposition parties, with Conservative Party leader Andrew Scheer calling it a \\"betrayal of justice\\" and saying that people who blow the whistle on misconduct should be protected, not punished. NDP Leader Jagmeet Singh said that Wilson-Raybould tried to \\"put integrity and what's right for Canadians over what helps the Liberals\\" and that she \\"deserved better\\". Green Party leader Elizabeth May said Wilson-Raybould had shown honour and integrity in her work, and that \\"the laws weren't broken because she held firm\\". The day after the expulsions, about fifty young women in the House of Commons as part of a delegation of Daughters of the Vote, a youth leadership event, turned their backs on Trudeau in protest during his speech to the delegation. In May 2019, Wilson-Raybould and Philpott announced their intentions to run as independent candidates for the 2019 federal election. In an interview with the New York Times, Trudeau maintained his innocence in the matter and suggested that the severity of the issue had been overly exaggerated, stating that \\"the media and opposition were being distracted with this internal dispute that has been invented and amplified.\\" Ethics Commissioner's report Mario Dion, the Parliament of Canada's Ethics Commissioner, began an investigation in March. On 14 August 2019, he released a report that concluded Trudeau had contravened section 9 of the Conflict of Interest Act by improperly pressuring Wilson-Raybould. The report details lobbying efforts by SNC-Lavalin to influence prosecution since at least February 2016, including the lobbying efforts to enact DPA legislation. The report analyses SNC-Lavalin's interests and finds that the lobbying effort advanced private interests of the company, rather than public interests. Dion concluded that Wilson-Raybould had resisted the improper pressure put upon her and he did not find any political interference in the prosecution. He noted that he did not have complete information about the case as the Privy Council would not release nine witnesses that claimed to have information about the case. The report's analysis section discusses the topics of prosecutorial independence and Shawcross doctrine (dual role of Attorney General) to draw the conclusion that the influence was improper and a violation of the Conflict of Interest Act. However, some legal analysts, such as Errol Mendes, professor of constitutional law at the University of Ottawa, veteran attorney David Hamer, and Kenneth Jull, adjunct law professor at the University of Toronto and advisor at Toronto business law firm Gardiner Roberts, disagreed with Dion's interpretation and suggested that the report may have overreached in its findings. An emergency meeting of the House of Commons Ethics Committee to discuss the report further was scheduled for 21 August 2019. A motion by the Opposition to have Dion testify before the Committee was defeated 5-4, with only Liberal MP Nate Erskine-Smith breaking with the Liberal majority on the committee. An additional motion by the NDP to have Trudeau himself testify, along with Finance Minister Bill Morneau and his former chief of staff Ben Chin, was also defeated. The Ethics Commissioner does not have the jurisdiction to impose sanctions for such a violation. Responding to the report, Trudeau said he accepted it and took responsibility but disagreed with its findings. Scheer renewed his calls for a RCMP investigation, while May and Singh reiterated their calls for an inquiry. A RCMP spokesperson declined to confirm or deny whether an investigation is underway, saying that the police force is carefully reviewing the facts and will take \\"appropriate actions as required\\". After the report was made public, Wilson-Raybould released a statement saying it is a vindication of her positions on prosecutorial independence and the role of Attorney General. She stated that the report confirms that she acted appropriately at all times and that the staff of the Prime Minister's office acted improperly. On the day the report was released, Wilson-Raybould told a reporter she had not been contacted by the RCMP. The following day, she clarified that while she had not been contacted by the RCMP since the release of the Ethics Commissioner's report, she had been contacted by the police force concerning the affair earlier in the spring. On the same day as the commissioner's report, Anne McLellan's companion report on whether to separate the roles of Minister of Justice and Attorney General (MoJAG) was made public. It recommended keeping the position combined as it has been since Confederation. McLellan recommended various changes and clarifications to protocols and communications, ask the Attorney General to explain decisions to direct or not direct prosecutions, explicitly note the independence of the Attorney General in law, educate parliamentarians, update the Department of Justice Act and change the name of the Department of Justice to the Department of Justice and Office of the Attorney General of Canada. Subsequent to the release of the report, Trudeau addressed the claims, saying that he took “full responsibility” for how the case was handled, but would not apologize for protecting Canadian jobs. Ian Lee, professor at Carleton University, and Philip Cross, fellow at the Macdonald-Laurier Institute, have disputed Trudeau's jobs claims, saying that even if SNC-Lavalin was banned from bidding on federal contracts it would be able to continue to bid on provincial and municipal projects and other companies winning federal contracts would employ Canadian workers. Michel Nadeau, former deputy chief of Caisse de dépôt said it was unlikely SNC-Lavalin would move its headquarters from Montreal. Quebec Premier, François Legault, welcomed Trudeau's statements saying it is important for the Prime Minister to protect well-paying jobs. RCMP inquiry On 10 September 2019, The Globe and Mail published a story claiming the Trudeau government was not co-operating with an RCMP inquiry into potential obstruction of justice. A waiver for confidentiality was not provided by the Clerk of the Privy Council nor did Trudeau override the Clerk which would allow RCMP access to both staffers and materials. According to the report, sources who spoke to The Globe and Mail were told to not discuss matters regarding the scandal with police officials. While Scheer said the RCMP were investigating the Prime Minister's Office there was no evidence as of 10 September 2019 that the RCMP has begun an investigation into anyone in the PMO. Wilson-Raybould was interviewed by investigators on 10 September 2019.

The series premiered on ABS-CBN's PrimeTanghali noontime block and worldwide on The Filipino Channel from March 25 to October 18, 2019, replacing Playhouse. Premise Michaela \\"Mikmik\\" Dimaano is a bright, wise cracking 10-year-old girl living happily with her mother, Ella and her adoptive grandmother Esther in a quiet province. Everything changes when Ella is diagnosed with late onset leukemia, the same time Mikmik discovers her true relations to Divina Salvador, a wealthy businesswoman. In order to pay for her mother's medication, Mikmik, with the help of Esther, visits Divina but is rejected, as Ella is blamed for her stepbrother's death, Eric. Ella then dies, and Mikmik is taken by Ruth, her late mother's best friend, to live with the Salvadors. The Salvador family consists of the matriarch, Divina Savador, the wife of the late Gabriel Salvador, her daughter in-law, Katrina Salvador, and her granddaughters, the harsh and envious Amber Salvador, and the misguided but kind hearted Britney Salvador. Mikmik immediately finds refuge and comfort in Benjie and Ruth's eldest son, Joseph, but has to face the spite and cruelties of her cold stepgrandmother Divina, her wicked step aunt Katrina, and her older stepcousin Amber. The two older women's hatred stemmed from the fact that Mikmik is the only legitimate heir to the Salvador wealth: Ella is in fact the legitimate child of Gabriel as his marriage with Ella's mother was not annulled, making Divina a mistress, and Eric himself was Divina's adoptive son, due to the fact she cannot bear children. When Michael a mysterious man from the past resurfaces and creates a paternal connection with Mikmik, things escalate to greater heights. As family feuds worsen to great levels, no lies will remain undiscovered, no secrets will remain unrevealed, and soon in the end Mikmik will finally get the happiness and the complete family that she truly deserves.

Daniels is an American physicist who is a Professor of Physics at North Carolina State University. Her research considers the deformation and failure of materials. She is a Fellow of the American Physical Society, and serves on their Committee on the Status of Women in Physics.  Early life and education  Daniels completed a bachelor's degree in physics at Dartmouth College in 1994. She originally planned to study engineering. After graduating, Daniels spent three years as a physics teacher at Saint Ann's School. Daniels joined Cornell University as a graduate student, earning a PhD in 2002. She was a postdoctoral research associate at Duke University, working on jamming transitions. At Duke University, Daniels developed a technique that can make a container of granules arrange into a solid-state crystal (freeze) or into a fluid (melt) by changing the rate at which they are shaken.  Research and career  Daniels joined North Carolina State University as an Assistant Professor in 2005. She is interested in how materials compress, stretch and bend when a force is applied. She specializes in granular materials and their force chains, and how networks within granular materials control their bulk properties. She developed a way to monitor whether granular materials reach a thermodynamic equilibrium, using plastic granules. In 2011, Daniels spent a year as an Alexander von Humboldt Foundation fellow at the Max Planck Institute for Dynamics and Self-Organization in Göttingen, coordinating a workshop on complex system's: \\"Particulate Matter: Does Dimensionality Matter.\\" She worked with Haverford College to study the naturally arising sound waves of granular materials. When the materials experience shear stress, the vibrating grains start to stick to the interface. When the stress becomes too much, several grains slip at once, rearranging into new patterns. The stick-slip transition is accompanied by low-frequency vibrational modes. She demonstrated that sound passes through the areas of a material where particles are tightest together. Her lab team have investigated how space missions could explore asteroids. She was supported by NASA to conduct experiments in zero gravity, and took a group of undergraduates to Zero Gravity Corporation. She has also looked at liquid metals, and demonstrated that applying a low voltage to eutectic gallium-indium can cause it to form snowflake-like crystals. Daniels is an Associate Editor of Physical Review Letters. She serves on the American Physical Society Topical Group on Soft Matter committee. Daniels has been involved with activities to increase the representation of women in physics since the start of her career.

The car is an updated version of the previous Audi RS5 DTM that had a naturally aspirated engine. The Audi RS5 Turbo DTM will still be based on the production Audi RS5. The car made its DTM début in the 2019 season under \\"Class One\\" regulations and will be used until 2020 season. The RS5 Turbo is the Audi's first-turbo powered DTM car. With a total of 12 wins, 12 pole positions, 18 podium finishes and a total record of 1,132 manufacturer's championship points in 2019, the RS5 Turbo DTM is statistically the fourth most dominant DTM car in the history of the sport with a win percentage of 66.67% against the sport's most dominant car, the 2003 Mercedes CLK DTM with a record of 90%. The car brought Audi's first year of domination of the sport in a history in 2019. At the end of the 2020 season, Audi Sport will leave the DTM after 31 years of participation (with an exception of 1993-1996) as they will be focusing to Formula E; this will be the last Audi vehicle in the DTM to date. Design Chassis Audi carried over the RS5 DTM car to undergo a major development for the Class One project which will be used for the 2019 season and beyond and rebrand it as Audi RS5 Turbo DTM. The aerodynamic packages of the RS5 Turbo DTM also has significant change including front splitter length cut to 90 millimetres, radiator grill revamp, rear wing width increased to 520 millimetres and also DRS improvement to make cars aggressive for overtaking compared to the Audi RS5 DTM naturally aspirated. The car made its first shakedown at Circuito do Estoril on 8 November 2018. The design also features the newly-firewall interior cockpit protection to deflect debris away from a driver's head in the event of an accident. Engine The RS5 Turbo DTM features a brand-new RC8 2.0 TFSI engine package built specifically for the car. The aging Audi 4.0 L (244 cu in) V8 naturally-aspirated engine—which had been used since the inaugural season of the Deutsche Tourenwagen Masters— was replaced by a 2.0 L (122 cu in) inline-4 turbocharged direct-injected RC8 engine developed by Audi based on the Audi 2.0 R4 16v TSI/TFSI (EA888). During the car's shakedown and preliminary testing phase at the Circuito do Estoril, drivers noted that the change from natural aspiration to a turbocharger meant that the RS5 Turbo DTM required a different driving style to its predecessor, the Audi RS5 DTM NA, as the turbocharger produced more torque and thus required the driver to exercise greater control over the throttle. The Audi RC8 TFSI I-4 turbo engine will also feature the push-to-pass for overtaking manoeuvre improvement. Début The first shakedown of Audi RS5 Turbo DTM was carried by Nico Müller, René Rast and Mike Rockenfeller on 12-15 November 2018 at Circuito do Estoril. Nico Müller commented “The new DTM car has terrific muscle and momentum, the turbo engine has awesome thrust\\". The RS5 Turbo DTM made its official test début at EuroSpeedway Lausitz on 14 April 2019 and will make its race début at Hockenheimring on 3 May 2019 and thus René Rast won the 2nd leg of 1st Hockenheimring round.

The stadium will have 5,000 seats, a 300-seat club facility, and 13 suites. The estimated cost of the stadium is $35 million. In 2020 it will become home to the Fredericksburg Nationals, a minor league baseball team of the Carolina League and the Class A-Advanced affiliate of the Washington Nationals. The stadium will also host a variety of community athletic and social events.  History   Background  The Potomac Nationals, playing since 1984 at Northwest Federal Field at Pfitzner Stadium in Woodbridge, Virginia, began seeking a better ballpark at least as early as 1998, with various proposals made in 2000, 2002, 2005, 2010, 2011, and 2016. Meanwhile, Fredericksburg worked with the Hagerstown Suns in 2013 and 2014 on plans to relocate that team for the 2015 season, but those plans fell apart.  Approval  In June 2018, Potomac Nationals owner Art Silber announced that he had signed a letter of intent to build a new stadium in Fredericksburg that would open in April 2020. In November 2018 the Fredericksburg city council unanimously gave final approval for the Silber family, doing business as Potomac Baseball, LLC, to finance, build and maintain the stadium with the city as an \\"anchor tenant\\" making an annual payment to the club of $1.05 million for 30 years. The team held a contest to rename itself and announced on October 5, 2019 that the team would be renamed the Fredericksburg Nationals.  Construction  A groundbreaking ceremony was held on February 24, 2019, but construction work had not begun as of May 20, 2019. A month later it was announced that site work would begin in July 2019. In August 2019, the Fredericksburg Economic Development and Tourism Office released a video of earth being moved at the construction site. The Potomac Nationals played their last regular season game at Pfitzner Stadium on August 29, 2019. On September 25, 2019, general manager Nick Hall said, \\"We're 100 percent planning on opening April 23, [2020,]\\" and that the first concrete could be poured as early as the next week. MASN reported on January 13, 2020 that Hall had said that construction was on schedule; that he was confident the venue will be ready for the 2020 season; and, \\"The seating bowl should actually be finished by the end of next week.\\" With the 2020 season start postponed due to the COVID-19 pandemic, the Nationals held a virtual opening day on April 23, 2020. Hall said that the stadium was baseball-ready though construction was not yet complete, even though, with construction deemed as essential business, \\"The construction progress has gone off without a hitch.\\" Construction was continuing at the start of June 2020.  Use  The start of the 2020 minor league baseball season was postponed due to the COVID-19 pandemic before ultimately being cancelled on June 30. Starting July 6, the still unnamed ballpark is being used in the 2020 Major League Baseball season as the alternate training site for members of the Washington Nationals 60-man player pool who are not assigned to the 40-man roster.

Personal life  Born to a Nigerian father, and Indian Tamil mother, Emezi grew up in Aba, Nigeria. Emezi and their sister Yagazie used storytelling to escape the riots, dictatorship, and dangerous reality of their childhoods. Emezi began writing short stories when they were five years old. They received their MPA from New York University. Emezi uses the personal pronouns they/them/theirs.  Freshwater  Freshwater tells the semi-autobiographical story of the protagonist, Ada, who is an ogbanje. Emezi explores their Igbo heritage's spirituality and gender alongside those of Western construction and invites their audience to think critically about this spirit/body binary. Reception The New Yorker called Freshwater \\"a startling début novel\\"; The Guardian called it \\"a remarkable debut\\"; and the LA Times called it \\"dazzling\\". Freshwater was longlisted for numerous significant awards. Freshwater was a New York Times Notable Book, was named a Best Book of the Year by the New Yorker and NPR. and was called a New York Times Notable Book. Emezi is also recognized as a 2018 National Book Foundation \\"5 Under 35\\" honoree. In 2019, Freshwater was nominated for the Women's Prize for Fiction — the first time a non-binary transgender author has been nominated for the prize. Kate Williams, the chair of the judges, called it a \\"historic moment\\". Williams said that the panel did not know Emezi was non-binary when the book was chosen, but she said Emezi was happy to be nominated. Non-binary commentator Vic Parsons wrote that the nomination raised uncomfortable questions, asking: \\"would a non-binary author who was assigned male at birth have been longlisted? I highly doubt it.\\" After the nomination, it was announced that the Women's Prize Trust was working on new guidelines for transgender, non-binary, and genderfluid authors.  Other works Pet, released on 10 September 2019, is about a transgender teenager named Jam living in a world where adults refuse to acknowledge the existence of monsters.

Development The H.VII was originally allocated the Reichsluftfahrtministerium (RLM) designation 8-226, but was later given the new RLM designation 8-254, so it was known by inference as Horten Ho 226 or Horten Ho 254, though these designations were little used in practice. In 1942 the H.VII design began as a test-bed for the Schmitt-Argus pulse-jet engine but this project was cancelled in 1943 and the aircraft's role became that of a trainer. It was based on the Horten H.V but with more powerful Argus As 10C engines. Walter Horten piloted its first flight in May 1944 and took part in many hours of a series of test flights, partly intended to quell concerns about the tailless aircraft's controllability in the case of an asymmetric power loss. Two prototypes were built and the H.VII V-3, nearing completion by the time that the allied advance reached the Peschke factory in Minden, would have been the first of twenty production aircraft.

She has been described as a pioneer in public radio and \\"a commanding presence in the public radio arena.\\"  Early years  A secular Jew, Seymour grew up in the Bronx, attending Sholem Aleichem Folk School to learn Yiddish literature and language as a supplement to her public schooling. During her years at City College of New York she studied Yiddish with Jewish linguist Max Weinreich.  Career  Seymour's first venture into radio came at KPFK in Los Angeles from 1961 to 1964. As that station's drama and literary critic, she produced award-winning series. From 1971 to 1976, she worked as program director there, and she did freelance work for the Pacifica Foundation while traveling in Europe. Seymour joined the staff of KCRW at Santa Monica College in 1977 as a consultant and was named manager a few months later. She retired from there in February 2009 after having helped the station \\"transcend its basement location to shape the culture in Los Angeles.\\" During her tenure, the station grew from being based in a playground at a middle school and having an old transmitter to covering much of southern California with its broadcasts. It also developed streaming services and podcasts. In 1979, two factors combined to enhance Seymour's efforts toward advancing KCRW's status. Soon after the station began using a new transmitter, National Public Radio launched Morning Edition. While the area's then-most-significant public radio station ran the two-hour program before 6 a.m., Seymour decided to run it three times each morning from 3 a.m. to 9 a.m. on KCRW. \\"That way nobody was going to have [the programs] when I didn't have them,\\" she said. Seymour spearheaded fundraising efforts for not only KCRW, including a $1 million pledge drive in 1995, but also for the network program Weekend All Things Considered in 1985 and for NPR in 1991. She also was active in the effort to simplify podcasting of radio stations' programs. Without blanket licensing agreements, such as those that apply to over-the-air broadcasts and streaming of programs, a separate contract with each record label used in the podcast was required. Hanukah broadcast In 1979, Seymour launched a program on KCRW that became a tradition, going strong a quarter-century later. Noting the lack of radio programming related to Hanukkah, she created and hosted Philosophers, Fiddlers and Fools, a program that included recordings of Yiddish folk music and songs from Yiddish music halls, a short story by a Yiddish author, and a memorial to the Holocaust. Initially surprised and disappointed because only two people called the station during the broadcast, Seymour thought that it was a failure — until it ended. Then calls kept the staff and their telephones busy for three hours. Thereafter, the show was broadcast annually.  Personal life  Seymour married—and divorced -- Jack Hirschman. They had two children. After the divorce, she changed her surname to Seymour to honor her paternal grandfather, who had been a rabbi. Recognition In 1999, the Workmen’s Circle gave Seymour its Yiddishkayt Award for her “service to Yiddish language and culture.”  References  Category:American radio executives Category:City College of New York alumni Category:Year of birth missing (living people) Category:Living people Category:People from the Bronx ","title":"Ruth Seymour"},{"id":"60111216","text":"The IAR-818 was a Romanian multipurpose aircraft based on the IAR-817.

In 2016 The Washington City Paper called him \\"one of the most interesting people of Washington, DC.\\"  Early life and education  Florencio Lennox Campello was born in Santiago de Cuba, Cuba in 1956, and immigrated as a child to the United States in the 1960s along with his political refugee parents. He studied art at the University of Washington (BA, 1981), where he was commissioned as a U.S. Navy officer, and subsequently received an MS from the Naval Postgraduate School in Monterey, California in 1987.  Artwork  Campello's art is predominantly narrative and storytelling in nature, and often incorporates technology such as video, sound, and miniature spy cameras into the finished pieces. He has exhibited widely in the United States, Europe and Latin America, including in the McManus Museum in Scotland, the Brusque Museum in Brazil, the San Bernardino County Museum in California, the Meadows Museum of Art in Shreveport, Louisiana, the Hunter Museum of American Art in Tennessee, the Sacramento Fine Arts Center in California, the Boulder Museum of Contemporary Art in Colorado, the A.S.

Reviews In a review of his 1996 exhibition of portraits of Internet porn stars, The Washington Post noted that his artwork \\"manages to find a delicate balance between the black charcoal and cream-colored paper resulting in a grainy, film-noir effect, making his subjects, traffickers in mass-consumption prurience, seem tough but vulnerable, like a flowering plant in a sexual wasteland.\\" A more recent review of his 2017 solo show in The Washington Post explained that \\"His technique is classical, but he sometimes incorporates a contemporary technology: embedded video. “Portrait of You” features a live feed of the picture's viewer, and “Cuban by Ancestry, but American by the Grace of God” (seen last year at the American University Museum) chronicles his family history on a video loop.\\" In reviewing the same show, The Washington City Paper noted that the solo show focused \\"on a couple of his far-ranging “artistic obsessions,” as he calls them, from Frida Kahlo to the Book of Genesis to the Picts of Scotland.\\" American art critic Dr. Claudia Rousseau observed that \\"Campello is a prolific artist who has had an interesting and compelling trajectory of work since the 1980s.\\" Brickell Magazine described him as \\"a thought leader in the world of the arts on a global scale.\\" In 2020 The Washington City Paper characterized him as a \\"prominent figure\\" in discussing artistic responses to the COVID-19 pandemic.

In 2011, Harris was requested by the South Australian Police to participate in the recovery of the body of his close friend Agnes Milowka, who had died whilst exploring a cave near Tantanoola in the south east of South Australia. In 2009 Harris was awarded the \\"Outstanding Achievement\\" award at the Australian technical diving conference Oztek, to mark his exceptional contributions to cave diving exploration, in 2017 he was awarded the \\"Australasian Technical Diver of the Year\\" at Oztek. Tham Luang cave rescue In June 2018 Harris was about to depart on a cave diving holiday to the Nullarbor Plain when he and dive partner Craig Challen were requested by the Thai government, on the advice of British cave diving experts attempting to rescue twelve Thai children and their soccer coach who were trapped in the Tham Luang Nang Non cave system, to provide assistance with the rescue efforts. Harris' efforts throughout the rescue have been described as essential; he conducted a medical assessment of all of the trapped boys and it was on his advice that the authorities reversed their initial strategy of rescuing the strongest boys first, followed by the weakest. Harris decided the order in which the boys would be extracted and advised on the method to be used. To allow the rescue to occur Harris administered a mild sedative to the boys, ensuring they did not panic during the rescue. Harris and Challen were the last members of the rescue team out of the caves following the rescue. On 24 July 2018 Harris, along with Challen, was awarded the Star of Courage (SC) and Medal of the Order of Australia (OAM) by the Governor-General of Australia.

On Australia Day 2019, Harris was announced as the joint 2019 Australian of the Year with Challen. On the 5 November 2019 Doctors Harris and Challen, released a book \\"Against All Odds\\" chronicling their participation in the rescue of the boys from the Tham Luang Cave. In the book and in radio interviews promoting the book they corrected some of the inaccuracies in the media regarding the rescue. He stated that he did not pick the order that the boys would leave the cave, and that the boys decided that amongst themselves based on the distance each boy lived from the cave. He also said the boys were fully unconscious as they were carried through the flooded cave, as he had given each boy two intramuscular injections in the thigh: Ketamine to put them to sleep, and Atropine to suppress saliva production to stop choking.

He is best known for the house he designed for Fridtjof Nansen, Polhøgda (1900–02) in the Fornebu area, built of stone. In 1883 he became the castle manager for Oscar II. Welhaven Heiberg's mother was Margrethe Backer (1851–1940). She and her three older sisters were involved in culture. Harriet Backer (1845–1932) was the second-oldest and ranks among Norway's greatest painters. Another sister was the pianist and composer Agathe Backer (1847–1907, married name Agathe Backer Grøndahl), remembered for her piano pieces and songs. Inga Agathe (1842–1915) was the oldest sister and a talented singer. Like her sister Harriet, Margrethe Backer was interested in painting. She studied under Vilhelm Kyhn in Copenhagen and also at Knud Bergslien's painting school in Kristiania. Training and marriage Astri Welhaven was taught by her aunt, Harriet Backer, from 1902 to 1907. Backer operated a painting school in Kristiania for almost 20 years around the turn of the century. During the years that Astri Welhaven was a student with Harriet Backer, she gained much experience in painting nudes. In addition, she adopted her aunt's strict discipline and work ethic. In November 1907, Astri Welhaven married Christen Fritzner Heiberg (1878–1943), an older brother of the painter and Henri Matisse's student Jean Heiberg. The newlyweds moved to New York shortly after, where Christen Heiberg worked as an architect. Astri Welhaven Heiberg gave birth to her only child, Hjalmar Welhaven Heiberg, in New York in the fall of 1910. Astri's sister Sigri was married to Jean Heiberg from 1913 to 1920. Debut In the fall of 1912, Welhaven Heiberg debuted at the Autumn Exhibition with a portrait. Harriet Backer is said to have advised her not to make her debut too early because she did not want her niece to exhibit until she had a solid foundation. After her debut in 1912, Welhaven Heiberg had works accepted for the Autumn Exhibition eight times over the next ten years, sometimes with up to four or five of her works. She received relatively good reviews in the press, where some expressed hopes for her future artistic work. Astri Welhaven Heiberg gained some recognition in the years after her debut. In 1916 and 1917 she received the Henrichsen Grant, which she applied for with recommendations from Jens Thiis and Harriet Backer. She received the grant as the only painter for both years. Some sources indicate that she also received the A. C. Houen Grant in the 1920s. This cannot be documented, but it also cannot be ruled out because it is very likely that a travel scholarship allowed her to make her long study visit to Paris in 1924. Art Welhaven Heiberg had two separate exhibitions, both at the Blomqvist auction house, in 1919 and 1925. The National Gallery purchased the painting Våraften i Asker (Spring Evening in Asker) from her first solo exhibition. At the Autumn Exhibition in 1919, I haven (In the Garden) was purchased for the collection. Welhaven Heiberg participated in several Scandinavian group exhibitions, including the anniversary exhibition in Gothenburg in 1923. Other international group exhibitions include the Norwegian exhibition in Riga in 1934, International Women Painters (New York, 1939), and Contemporary European Women Painters (London, 1947). She is represented with works in most Norwegian public collections, including the Bergen Art Museum, Lillehammer Art Museum, Southern Norway Art Museum, and Trondheim Art Museum. Most striking are her paintings of female nudes in landscapes, known as uteakter (outdoor nudes). By 1922 she had probably painted 12 such motifs. During the 1920s, Welhaven Heiberg increasingly turned to painting commissioned portraits. Over the years she undertook several major assignments. She painted King Haakon VII, Crown Princess Märtha, and the crown prince couple's three children, among others. From 1916 to 1924, Welhaven Heiberg lived in Asker. Despite choosing to live in Oslo after 1924, she remained in touch with Asker all her life. Welhaven Heiberg was active as a painter until her last year of life, and she took part in the Autumn Exhibition many times, for the last time in 1961 as an 80-year- old. After this, she exhibited exclusively in Asker. Of Welhaven Heiberg's production, around 150 paintings can be documented and dated to the period between 1907 and 1966. There is reason to believe that many of her paintings are in private collections, and that her total production is greater than what can currently be documented.

She also saw commissioned service in the United States Navy as USS Mangrove on three occasions, operating as an armed supply ship from April to August 1898 during the Spanish–American War, during which she fought the last battle of that war; as a patrol vessel from 1917 to 1919 during and in the aftermath of World War I; and as a buoy tender from 1941 to 1946 during and in the aftermath of World War II. Construction and commissioning Mangrove was constructed by Crescent Shipyard in Elizabethport, New Jersey, for the United States Lighthouse Board and was completed in 1897.McLean, Bruce D., \\"The U.

Spanish–American War Photograph from the 12 April 1898 edition of Uncle Sam's Navy of the court of inquiry aboard USLHT Mangrove in Havana Harbor, ca. March 1898. From left are Captain French Ensor Chadwick, Captain William T. Sampson, Lieutenant Commander William P. Potter, Ensign W. V. Powelson, and Lieutenant Commander Adolph Marix. After – a United States Navy second-class battleship – exploded and sank while at anchor in the harbor at Havana, Cuba, on the evening of 15 February 1898, Mangrove transported wounded survivors of the disaster to Key West. In March 1898, while anchored in Havana Harbor, she served as a site for the U.S. Navy court of inquiry into the loss of Maine. She later made a voyage in which she carried guns salvaged from Maine′s wreck and civilians evacuating Cuba to the United States as the Spanish–American War broke out in April 1898. On 10 April 1898, shortly before the war broke out, Mangrove was transferred to the U.S. Navy for war service. Armed with two quick-firing guns, she was commissioned into the U.S. Navy as USS Mangrove. She operated as an armed supply ship during the war. Action off Caibarién Under orders to support a Cuban military expedition aboard the schooners Dellie and Ellen F. Adams at Cayo Francés in the Bay of Buena Vista on the north-central coast of Cuba,Annual Reports of the Secretary of the Navy for the Year 1898, p. 312. Mangrove arrived at Cayo Francés on 12 August 1898 to find no sign of the schooners or the expedition.Annual Reports of the Secretary of the Navy for the Year 1898, p. 310. She found Dellie on the morning of 13 August, and a party from Dellie informed Mangroves crew that Ellen F. Adams had disembarked her part of the expedition on 12 August and that Dellie planned to disembark hers on the morning of 14 August. Mangroves commanding officer informed the party from Dellie that Mangrove would remain at Cayo Francés to ensure that Spanish Navy gunboats at nearby Caibarién did not interfere with Dellie′s disembarkation of her part of the expedition. Mangrove made an attempt to reach Caibarién on the afternoon of 13 August, but returned to Cayo Francés due to unfavorable tides. Near sundown on 13 August, she observed one of the Spanish gunboats underway near the harbor at Caibarién. On the morning of 14 August 1898, Mangrove approached Caibarién and at about 10:55, when east of the harbor there, sighted a large Spanish gunboat – which Mangrove′s crew identified as probably the gunboat Hernán Cortés – moored close inshore north of the harbor. Unable to bring both of her 6-pounders to bear at once, Mangrove opened fire on the gunboat with her port 6-pounder, firing slowly to get the range, and the gunboat immediately returned fire, firing her entire port broadside. After about five minutes, Mangrove switched to her starboard 6-pounder and continued firing slowly. All shots by both sides fell short. By 11:10, however, Mangrove was within range of the gunboat, and she steamed to the north and west for the next 25 minutes, keeping up a steady fire with her port 6-pounder. At 11:12, a small Spanish gunboat moored at Caibarién′s city wharves joined the engagement, opening fire on Mangrove, but Mangrove was beyond her range; Mangrove fired a single round at her, but it fell short, and Mangrove then shifted fire back to the larger gunboat. At 11:25, Mangrove reversed course, steaming south and east and engaging the larger gunboat with her starboard 6-pounder, firing continuously with that gun until 11:45. At 11:27, she fired her 1-pounder at the larger gunboat as well, but the round fell short, and Mangrove made no further use of her 1-pounder during the engagement. The larger Spanish gunboat maintained a steady fire with her guns as well and proved capable of reaching and even firing over Mangrove, so at 11:45 Mangrove′s commanding officer decided to cease fire and open the range in the hope of drawing the Spanish gunboat away from shore and give Mangrove a better chance of engaging her on more equal terms. The large Spanish gunboat also ceased fire as Mangrove drew away, but the smaller gunboat that had joined the engagement continued to fire at Mangrove ineffectively until 12:30. During the early afternoon, a Spanish party approached Mangrove aboard the smaller gunboat under a flag of truce and informed Mangroves crew that word had arrived that hostilities between Spain and the United States had ceased on 13 August. Mangrove thus had the distinction of fighting the last battle of the Spanish–American War, albeit on the day after the war officially ended., p. 100. During the engagement she had fired 103 armor-piercing shells from her 6-pounder and one armor-piercing shell from her 1-pounder. Mangrove had taken no hits during the 14 August engagement. On the afternoon of 14 August, however, she ran aground while withdrawing from Caibarién, but she soon refloated herself and departed for Key West.Annual Reports of the Secretary of the Navy for the Year 1898, p. 311. The U.S. Navy transferred Mangrove back to the U.S. Lighthouse Board on 18 August 1898. The Navy cited Mangrove for her \\"conspicuous service\\" during the war. 1898–1917 After her return to the Lighthouse Board, Mangrove resumed her duties as a lighthouse tender, once again as USLHT Mangrove. The U.S. Lighthouse Board was abolished in 1910 and replaced by the new United States Lighthouse Service, and she became part of the Lighthouse Service fleet. World War I The United States entered World War I on 6 April 1917, and on 11 April 1917 Mangrove was transferred to the U.S. Navy for the second time. As USS Mangrove again, she operated as a patrol vessel during and in the immediate aftermath of the war. The U.S. Navy transferred her back to the U.S. Lighthouse Service on 1 July 1919. 1919–1941 As USLHT Mangrove, the ship again returned to lighthouse tender and buoy tender duty. In 1922, she was reassigned to the Sixth Lighthouse District, with her home port at Charleston, South Carolina. On 1 July 1939, the U.S. Lighthouse Service was abolished and the United States Coast Guard took over its responsibilities and assets, and Mangrove thus became part of the Coast Guard fleet as USCGC Mangrove. World War II On 1 November 1941, with World War II raging in Europe, North Africa, and the Middle East, the U.S. Coast Guard was transferred to the control of the U.S. Navy under Executive Order 8929, and Mangrove thus again came under U.S. Navy control only weeks before the United States entered the war on 7 December 1941. Given the hull classification symbol WAGL-232, she operated as a buoy tender in naval service, and by 1945 she was armed with two Oerlikon 20 mm cannon mounts. The Navy transferred her back to the U.S. Coast Guard on 1 January 1946. 1946–1947 The U.S. Coast Guard decommissioned the aging lighthouse tender – known once again as USCGC Mangrove – on 22 August 1946. After a career of nearly 50 years, she was sold for scrapping on 6 May 1947.

It was founded by sculptor Sun Yu-Li in 1995 as a venue with the focus on exhibiting and fostering ‘3-dimensional’ and other forms of sculptural arts in Singapore. The venue officially opened to the public in March 1999 with the exhibition Provocative Things: A Three Dimensional Experience in Singapore. The organization also often held annual ‘Sculpture Carnival’ events for the public, which was mainly targeted towards children and young adults in order to hone their interest in the arts. Sculpture Square Ltd. vacated its premises in August 2014. Since its closure in 2014, the buildings have been occupied by another local arts organization, Objectifs – the Centre for Photography and Films.  Overview   Beginnings  During its hoarding by the Urban Redevelopment Authority, Sun Yu-Li, an architect turned sculptor, found interest in the former church building due to its ‘unique architectural features’. Sun had prior took notice of the premises whilst commuting to his former studio at Sophia Road. With the support of the National Arts Council, Sun was allocated the land with the proposal to set up a non-profit organization in support of the arts. Sun wanted Sculpture Square to be a “place for (Singapore’s) sculpture and other 3D arts to nourish and flourish”. With the help of his friend, Edmund Cheng, who was the deputy chairperson of Wing Tai Holdings, they managed to network the monetary support needed to back the funding for Sculpture Square. The total funding of more than $1.6 million for the repair works and development was contributed by the National Arts Council, as well as both public and private sectors.  Operations  Sculpture Square held its inaugural show, Provocative Things, during its official opening on 22 October 1999. The event proved to be highly anticipated by the Singapore arts community but had quickly dwindled in attention by the following year, causing Sun to authorize T. K. Sabapathy, a local art historian and curator, as senior curatorial advisor to aid with the promotion of the organization. Its following shows included Ghost: The Body at the Turn of the Century, orchestrated by Alan Oei in 2013. Sculpture Square also held an annual Sculpture Carnival and Children's Sculpture Exhibition from 1999 up to 2012, one of the organization's longest running events. The event encouraged children aged 4 – 12 to create their own mini sculptures out of everyday materials to either be brought home or exhibited. The organization also briefly ran an artist-in-residency program that housed both foreign and local artists from 2003 to 2012 before being replaced in 2013 by a ‘Bureau’ program which allowed research and collaboration between multiple artists.  Closure  In August 2014, Sculpture Square left its building at 155, 161 middle road and was temporarily located at 48 Emerald Hill Road where they continued to provide art and curatorial consultancy. Its final exhibition was titled Postcards from the Future. The exhibition showcased postcards featuring the various sculptural works that had been exhibited in the past 15 years of operation- an ironic tribute as the three-dimensional works were paid homage in two-dimensional prints. It was replaced by another organization funded under the National Arts Council's Art Housing Scheme, Objectifs – the Centre for Photography and Films, which opened on 11 June 2015. According to its last chairman, Richard Helfer, the organization had agreed to vacate as they felt that \\"the accomplishment of our vision and mission is best served by not being venue-specific. Rather, (we feel) that the flexibility to work with different venues and organisations allows us to connect artists and their works better with a broader audience base\\". Speculations have been made about dilution of public interest with regards to its closure. Located around the Bugis – Bras Basah district, the building is in proximity to many other larger art organizations such as Singapore Art Museum and National Design Centre, and art institutions such as Nanyang Academy of Fine Arts and LASALLE College of the Arts. This phenomenon could be possibly be the result of the government's increasing emphasis on the local arts industry. In 1995, the local authority came out with the goal of making Singapore into a \\"global city of the arts\\" by the year 2000 was further articulated by both the (then) Ministry of Information and the Arts (MITA) and Singapore Tourist Promotion Board. Buildings such as Esplanade, the Singapore Art Museum and the National Museum expansion, are all the results of that money invested in by the government during period to achieve the aim of making Singapore a regional hub, or a \\"global city for the arts.\\" The area is also home to some of Singapore's famous religious buildings like Kwan Im Thong Hood Cho Temple and the Sri Krishnan Temple along Waterloo Street. The rise of all these organizations in the civic district over the past decades could have caused the spread of public interest, as Sculpture Square was considerably smaller in scale.  Waterloo Street Arts Belt  Sculpture Square was a part of the Waterloo Street Arts Belt program under the National Arts Council's Arts Housing Scheme. Other buildings under the scheme are Selegie Arts Centre, Singapore Calligraphy Centre, Dance Ensemble Singapore, and Centre 42. This was part of the council's efforts to promote local arts in the civic district.  Building   History  The organization's main gallery, the Chapel Gallery, was initially built as the Christian Institute by Charles Phillips in the 1870s. It was built mainly as a place to hold social activities within the church, as well as for the purpose of worship. The chapel housed the Middle Road Church, the Straits Chinese Community's first Methodist Church. The annex building was subsequently sold to the Women's Foreign Missionary Society (WFMS) and used as the Methodist Girls’ School in 1891 before it relocated in 1901. In 1930, the Middle Road Church was relocated to Kampong Kapor and was then re-branded as the Kampong Kapor Methodist Church. The building also functioned as a Chinese restaurant, May Blossom, during the Japanese Occupation in Singapore, and later, an automobile workshop, Sin Sin Motor Co, in the 1980s. The annex building served as Continental Hotel, a backpacker's hotel. The premises were hoarded by the Urban Redevelopment Authority from 1995–1999 before the space was granted by the National Arts Council to Sun Yu-Li to operate as Sculpture Square.  Architecture  155 and 161 Middle Road The Chapel Gallery was built with a gothic architectural style that resembles reproductions of English Parish Church. The chapel is 10 meters in height, with an open floor plan area of around 110 meters square.Susie Wong, \\"an art space for 3D Works\\" d., Vol 1 No.3 April 1999 pp.88-91 The high ceiling space has allowed the conducive facilitation of the placement of large and tall sculptures within the chapel gallery while the building was used as Sculpture Square. The exterior facades feature 5 large arch-shaped windows on each of the sides of the chapel. The front facing Middle Road features a main door flanked between two large windows. In the past, the second window on the sides from the front used to be a door that follows that of the main entrance, which was later converted into a window. The windows of the church have pointed lancet arches that follows the style of gothic architecture. The front and back of the church facades also feature a rose window on each, which was then hollowed out during its period as Sculpture Square. Currently used by Objectifs, the hollowed rose windows were sealed off to cut off natural lighting, allowing the manipulation of interior lighting. The building is one of the last remaining Gothic style buildings in Singapore. It was declared by the National Heritage Board as a historic site in 2000, in reference to its service as the Middle Road Church back in the 1890s. Plaque outside the building  Façade  Sculpture Square primarily featured an orange exterior paint job with white windows during its operation. However, the façade of the building was known to be occasionally painted over with mural arts, depending on the theme of the ongoing exhibition. One example is the Ghost: The Body at the Turn of the Century, where the exterior of the building was painted grey, with black graffiti marks to fit the theme. Building as art – mural painted on the facade of the chapel. Current facade of the building In the current modern context where the surrounding high-rise buildings overshadow other smaller buildings in the city-scape, the striking bright colours of Sculpture Square helped the building to stand out from its towering neighbors, a rare opportunity for a building to express itself in the city. Today, under the operation of Objectifs, the building is painted primarily in yellow with green windows, which is a reversion of colour scheme back to what it was commonly recognised by during the chapel's days as a motor workshop. Throughout the historical timeline of the chapel gallery, the external appearance, the interior and the chapel's surroundings changed in accordance to the function of the building. However, the physical architecture of the building is seemingly left untouched and retains the original gothic style when it was first built.  Urban development and planning  The location of Sculpture Square itself has been labelled under the NRA's masterplan in 1980 as a mixed used area. This provides an explanation as to why Sculpture Square's function as a building may change over a period of time – has no fixed plan for the building itself. Comparing to the most recent masterplan in 2014, the area has been labelled as a civic and community institution. The area surrounding 155 and 161 Middle Road has developed from an area that is predominantly mixed used and permanent residential areas, to an area with more high rise shopping and business buildings to suit the need of the modern era. Most of the buildings such as the Fortune Centre and the GSM buildings were old buildings renovated new, which allows the whole urban area to shed its historical atmosphere to become a more modern industrially developed place. Analysing the visibility of Sculpture Square, its surrounding isovist spaces are limited by its neighbouring high rise buildings, hence limiting the Sculpture Square building to be seen from a wider visual field in the city. The space syntax of Sculpture Square could be improved by widening the partitions between the low rise buildings of Sculpture Square and the high rise buildings in order to retain its significance as a historical site to its place in the modern city.  Historical timeline of the Chapel Gallery   Church Chapel (1872–1875)  Starting as a Church Chapel in 1872 Built by English missionary (British army officer) Charles Phillips as the Christian Institute for young men in 1872, to promote Christianity in Singapore. The area is used to uphold social activities within the church for the community as well as worship. In 1875, Charles Phillips invited the Methodists to use the place and transferred it to them in 1892.  Methodist Church / Straits Chinese Methodist Church (1894–1897)  In 1894, It became the first Methodist church in Singapore for the Straits Chinese community. It served mainly straits born or Baba Chinese with worship services conducted in Baba Malay. British Methodist missionary William Girdlestone Shellabear (1862–1947) was appointed as the church's first pastor. By 1897, the church's attendees had grown to almost 1,000, largely made up of children.  Tamil Girl's School / Methodist Girls' School (1898–1900)  1898 till 1900 as Tamil Girls’ School, later Methodist Girl's School A year later, the church bought over the building from the Methodist Girls’ School. It exists as a school during the weekdays and leased to the Foochow Chinese Mission for their Sunday worship services.  Baba Malay Church (1901–1910)  The building was dedicated by the Bishop Warne of the Methodist Episcopal Church in 1901. By then, the church was popularly known as the Baba Malay Church. Renovations were done to the building in 1899 and by 1901, the enlarged building was big enough to house multi-services in dialects like Hakka, Hokkien, Hinghua, Malay, Foochow and English.  Middle Road Church (1911–1929)  The church was renamed as Middle Road Church in 1911. Methodist denomination Christian church that was renamed from the Malay Church in 1911 as its congregation consisted mainly of Peranakan-speaking Straits Chinese. It was renamed Middle Road Church.  Kampong Kapor Methodist Church (1930-1940s)  1930 the building was sold to local tycoon Eu Tong Sen. At this time, the church was renamed as Kampong Kapor Methodist Church.  May Blossom Chinese Resaurant (1942-)  During Japanese Occupation as May Blossom Chinese Restaurant.  Sin Sin Motor Co (1980s-1990s)  the early 1980s as Sin Sin Motor Co, which is a motor workshop and a carpark.  (1990s-1998)  In 1993 the building was being allocated for arts groups as being part of NAC's Arts Housing Scheme appeared in Sep 1993. Since then they were set aside for arts groups. In 1995, 155 and 161 Middle Road had been allocated to Hi! Theatre, Singapore's pioneering theatre for the hearing impaired. Well-known theatre practitioner, Roger Jenkins, who was founder and then artistic director of Hi! Theatre however recalls that the group had been in discussion in NAC and was exploring possibilities, but the costs of renovation had proved prohibitive. 155 Middle Road Building had retained its church appearance, but it was vacant and badly run down, as quoted by Sun Yu Li. The two-storied adjacent building, on the other hand, was painted in garish green and yellow and was used as a budget hotel known as Continental Hotel. Sun also recalls that he saw the buildings being hoarded in and with a sign by Urban Renewal Authority stating that the land was for sale.  Sculpture square (1999–2014)  The building was converted into Sculpture Square, an Art Gallery in Singapore dedicated to the exhibition and promotion of three-dimensional art. Exhibitions were held monthly at the arts venue from its inauguration in March 1999. As for No. 161 of which the ground floor had been converted into a gallery space comprising a series of three-sided rooms that open up into a common passageway down the centre.  Objectifs Centre Ltd.

A single prototype was built, but it was not successful, the Potez 630 being preferred. Design and description On 31 October 1934 the French Air Ministry released a specification for a twin- engine multi-seat fighter aircraft, which would be required to fulfil several roles. A three seat version (C3 under the French designation scheme) would be used to command formations of smaller single-engine fighters, while two seat versions would be used to daylight bomber escort and attack (C2) or as night- fighters (CN2). Bids were received from a number of aircraft designers, including Breguet Aviation (the 690), Hanriot (the H.220), Potez (the 630) and Romano. The Romano design, the R.110, was a low-winged monoplane with a retractable tailwheel undercarriage. It was of mixed wood and metal construction, and was powered by two Renault 12R-02 air-cooled V-12 engines. It carried the specified armament of two fixed cannon and a single flexibly mounted machine gun. Construction of the prototype was relatively slow and it did not fly until 30 March 1938. By this time, the Potez 630 (which had first flown in 1936) had already been chosen to meet the requirement and was about to enter production, so development of the R.110 was abandoned.

This association dates back to the 1980s and has been expressed in areas that include song lyrics, benefit concerts for animal rights organisations, and militant actions of activists influenced by punk music. Among the latter, Rod Coronado, Peter Daniel Young and members of SHAC are notable. This issue spread into various punk rock and hardcore subgenres, e.g. crust punk, metalcore and grindcore, eventually becoming a distinctive feature of punk culture. The inculcation of some concepts and practices related to animal rights in the collective consciousness has been substantially pioneered and influenced by the punk movement. This association continues on into the 21st century, as evinced by the prominence of international vegan punk events such as Ieperfest in Belgium, Fluff Fest in Czech Republic, and Verdurada in Brazil.  Overview and analysis  Food Not Bombs volunteer in 2007 The relationship between punk and animal rights is highlighted in the imagery and lyrics of these bands, the content of zines, benefit concerts and albums for animal activist causes, and the convergence between punk and veganism in cafés, social centres, Food Not Bombs chapters, organisations such as the Animal Defense League and ABC No Rio (United States), and hunt saboteur groups (United Kingdom). Veganism has become the social norm in some communities of the anarcho-punk (current within punk rock that promotes anarchism) and straight edge (hardcore punk subculture based on abstinence from alcohol, tobacco and other recreational drugs) subcultures. For their part, the devotees of the Hare Krishna tradition, present in the krishnacore subgenre, are required to be vegetarians. A 2014 study indicates that vegan punks are more likely to remain politically active through their diets and lifestyles than those who do not belong to this subculture. The majority of those incarcerated for illicit animal activism in the late 1990s and early 2000s were involved in hardcore punk music. In the anglosphere, although women are probably the greatest part of animal rights and environmental advocacy, young white men constitute the majority of both eco-animal rights criminality and the \\"hypermasculine\\" vegan straight edge milieu, coinciding with the propaganda success of organisations such as the Earth Liberation Front. Despite these correlations, the sociologists Will Boisseau and Jim Donaghey state that not all punks are vegans or are even interested in animal rights, while sociologist Ross Haenfler writes that tolerant straight edgers have always outnumbered their militant counterparts, who, nevertheless, \\"overshadowed much of the scene\\" for their violent actions.  Politics and religion  Researcher Kirsty Lohman points out that punk's concern for animal welfare is placed in broader politics of environmental awareness and anti-consumerism, suggesting a form of continuity with previous countercultures such as the hippies and avant-gardes. One of the main characteristics of punk is its anti-authoritarian nature that includes a belief in liberation, concept which quickly extended into compassion for animals. In line with this, author Craig O'Hara said that \\"politically minded punks have viewed our treatment of animals as another of the many existing forms of oppression.\\" Furthermore, due to the substantial affiliation between meat eating and masculinity, many punks consider their vegetarian lifestyles as, at least partly, a feminist practice. For these reasons, Boisseau and Donaghey suggest that the relationship between punk culture and animal rights and veganism is best understood within the framework of anarchism and intersectionality. Unlike anarcho-punk, straight edge is not inherently political. For many straight edgers, as stated by Haenfler, \\"the personal is the political\\", choosing to live out their lifestyle (e.g. by adopting vegetarian diets) rather than engaging in traditional political protest. There have also been left-wing, conservative, radical, anarchist and religious interpretations of straight edge. Some straight edge people became Hare Krishnas because the latter provides a transcendental and philosophical framework wherein lay the commitments of non-drug use, vegetarianism and avoidance of illicit sex. Francis Stewart of the University of Stirling explained that there is still an anarchist influence on hardcore punk and straight edge, even if it were subtle, especially in regards to veganism and animal liberation and in the position of these within larger patterns of oppression. In 2017, she observed that straight edge has had an increasing hybridisation with anarchism. Some radical political circles and authors have criticised some straight edge branches, in particular its 1990s American form, for their \\"self-righteous militancy\\", \\"reductionist focus on animal rights and environmental issues,\\" and a religious leaning \\"that, in its worst forms, resembled reactionary Christian doctrines\\", according to anarchist writer Gabriel Kuhn. By the same token, other authors, such as music theorist Jonathan Pieslak, as well as straight edge activists argue that left-wing socio-political and politically correct agendas are detrimental to the movement because the scope of supporters is actually narrowed in broadening its causes since not everyone agrees on all of them. Instead, they propose the initial biocentrism which allowed highly divergent perspectives so long as the animals and earth were first. Despite their differences, sociologist Erik Hannerz highlights that anarcho-punk and straight edge not only coincide with animal rights, but both also emphasise a do-it-yourself (DIY) ethic and downplay a conspicuous style in favour of calling to action, linking their lifestyles to political action. Elsewhere, Boisseau and Donaghey write that many people exposed to animal rights and veganism continue their activism after ending their involvement in punk scenes, indicating the politicising role of these subcultures.  Influence on participants  Politicisation through punk typically involves an awareness of animal liberation through song lyrics and albums that include information and images of animal cruelty. Zines also played a fundamental part by discussing animal rights, factory farming, and the health and environmental effects of diets, often drawing on academic authors. For many listeners, punk rock scenes provided their first encounter with the \\"horrors\\" of slaughterhouses or laboratories, as noted by the comparative religion scholar Sarah M. Pike and vocalist Markus Meißner, especially \\"before the Internet made documentaries available to everyone.\\" Regarding vegan straight edge activists, Pieslak writes that the \\"movement had an intense impact on listeners, with the music playing a transformative role\\". Pike said that it generated an \\"internal revolution\\" in them through \\"the intensity of hardcore music and [its illustrative] lyrics\\"; the music working on them together with documentaries that reported the harshness of seal hunting or fur farms; or simply the aural experiences \\"affirmed at a visceral level\\" the activists' desire for animal liberation.  Reception from the animal rights movement  The reception of punk's activism has varied through the broader animal rights movement, which reflects the \\"much more diverse\\" ideological and tactical differences existent within both movements \\"than they might at first appear.\\" Sociologist and animal rights advocate Donna Maurer positively exemplified vegan straight edge as a movement that includes ethical veganism as part of their collective identity, therefore furthering the cause, but warned that teens who adopt it only to be part of the group can contribute to the free-rider problem. Strategies such as arson and property damage have often been attributed to the youthfulness and punk subcultural affiliation of A.L.F. activists and other related organisations. The more mainstream advocates tend to condemn these tactics and sometimes their relationship with punk. Others have supported them because, in their opinion, they seem to produce more quick changes. Another trouble spot has been the anti-abortion stance of some of the most religiously committed activists which, in the case of hardcore punk, were influenced by the sanctity of life belief of Krishna Consciousness and hardline.  Anarcho-punk   Background  The association of anarcho-punk and animal rights and environmentalism dates from the 1980s in the United Kingdom. This relationship (and subgenre) arises in the context of political upheaval, with a conservative government that waged war against Argentina (1982) and would eventually deploy nuclear missiles in the country. Anarcho-punk tried to restore punk rock's original objective of a subversive change in the world, countering the \\"disappointment, self- destruction, and commercial corruption\\" that permeated its key first-wave bands, and instead abiding by a devoted do-it-yourself ethic and philosophical anarchism. Anarcho-punk bands, which at first were widely pacifists, called to live consciously and to engage in activism; while some like Discharge and Crass emphasised their anti-war positions, others focused on animal rights such as Flux of Pink Indians and Conflict. Journalist Nora Kusche states that anarcho-punk was the first music genre that made animal rights activism one of its main characteristics. Some punks, most remarkably Joe Strummer of the Clash, were already vegetarians before the establishment of this movement. Researcher Aragorn Eloff notes that throughout the history of anarchism there had been some strands that criticised speciesism and embraced plant-based diets, but none had done so with such militancy as anarcho-punk in the 1980s. This was particularly true in its British political tradition.  Characteristics  In the anarchist DIY scenes, one of the most notable demonstrations of the punk lifestyle is a vegetarian or vegan diet. The anarchist philosophy of punk, which favoured action rather than a formal political organisation, was expressed in punks mobilising as hunt saboteurs (whose size was \\"swelled\\" by them), raising funds for activist groups and circulating British Union for the Abolition of Vivisection's propaganda. Images of animal testing were commonly exhibited in album covers, stickers, patches and buttons. An already well-established animal rights counterculture inspired some of these strategies, including leafleting at gigs. Kusche highlights that hunting was traditionally linked to the British aristocracy who then were disrupted by the \\"scruffy, antisocial\\" punks. During this period there was also a proliferation of punk zines that discussed animal rights and ecological practices of consumption. The scholars Russ Bestley and Rebecca Binns argue that the early establishment of animal rights in anarcho-punk led to a form of \\"two-way dialogue\\" between bands and participants instead of a \\"top-down\\" ideological imposition, which became more the case with other developments. Many traditional British anarchists differed in several ways from anarcho-punk, considering their interest in the Animal Liberation Front (A.L.F.), the counterculture of the punk underground and other concerns as \\"at best secondary and at worst irrelevant.\\" Likewise, punks found many of the intellectual debates around anarchist politics and, initially, the violence supported by revolutionary traditionalists equally alienating. Although the separation was not unbridgeable, the tensions remained unresolved.  Establishment  Colin Jerwood of Conflict in 1986 An antecedent of this association is the 1979 song \\"Time Out\\" by the band Crass, initiators of anarcho-punk, in which they compare the human and animal fleshes. The band Flux of Pink Indians pioneered this trend with their 1981 EP Neu Smell. During their career, Flux gave out thousands of leaflets on vivisection and other subjects at their gigs. In the following years, numerous anarcho-punk bands composed songs promoting animal rights and sometimes made it the principal topic, encompassing vegetarianism, anti-vivisection and opposition to hunting. Furthermore, they would often include information and images of animal cruelty within in their records. The most important advocates of vegetarianism and animal rights were the group Conflict, who aligned themselves with the Animal Liberation Front (A.L.F.) This band made a \\"call to arms\\" against different institutions, including slaughterhouses, and projected video footage of these while they played. The title of their 1983 song \\"Meat Means Murder\\" turned into a slogan which quickly propagated through the punk scene; articles on the topic appeared on fanzines, even on American (Flipside and Maximumrocknroll) and Australian ones. Their follow-up single To a Nation of Animal Lovers (1983) featured Steve Ignorant of Crass as co-vocalist and included illustrated vivisection essays in addition to addresses of scientists, food producers and fur farms. Early anarcho-punk bands such as Amebix, Antisect, Dirt, Exit-Stance, Liberty, Lost Cherrees, Poison Girls, Rudimentary Peni, and Subhumans all wrote songs dealing with animal rights issues as well, as did non-political bands such as the Business. Other remarkable works dedicated to the cause were the compilation albums of bands The Animals Packet (1983), organised by Chumbawamba, and This is the A.L.F. (1989), organised by Conflict and which was described in a retrospective review as \\"one of the most crucial anarcho-punk compilations of the '80s (and beyond)\\". American political bands of the early 1980s such as MDC and Crucifix, both from California and influenced by Crass, also promoted vegetarianism. Icons of Filth in 1982 Sociologist Peter Webb ascribed the growth of vegan and vegetarian cafés, organic food suppliers, and A.L.F. and Hunt Saboteurs Association increasing recruitment in Bristol through the first half of the 1980s to its anarcho-punk scene. Several members of political and anarcho-punk bands engaged in direct action activism, for example one member of Polemic Attack from Surrey was imprisoned for raiding an animal laboratory and two members of Anti-System from Bradford for destroying butcher shops and breaking into an abattoir, while the members of Wartoys (Manchester), Virus (Dorset), Polemic Attack, Disorder (Bristol), and Icons of Filth (Wales) all reported to have been hunt saboteurs, the last of whom also made songs against the meat industry and whose vocalist, Stig Sewell, staunchly supported the A.L.F. In the mid- to late 1980s, the stripped-down and coarse style of anarcho-punk mixed with different subgenres of heavy metal and brought forth crust punk and grindcore, which shared its emphasis on political and animal rights issues. Early grindcore bands such as Napalm Death, Agathocles and Carcass made animal rights one of their primary lyrical themes. Early crust punk bands including Nausea, Electro Hippies and Extreme Noise Terror also advocated vegetarian lifestyles. In Spain, the anarchist ska punk band Ska-P, formed in 1994, have written several songs criticising animal abuse and endorsed animal rights organisations. In 2018, Gerfried Ambrosch of the University of Graz called the Canadian anarcho-punk band Propagandhi \\"the most renowned contemporary vegan punk band\\".  Impact  Some authors credit the anarcho-punk scene originated by Crass as the introduction of diverse concepts and counter- cultural practices in popular culture, including those related to animal rights. Eloff stated that the sudden growth of animal liberation theory and practice within anarchism since the 1980s, which also developed into philosophies such as veganarchism, was most probably caused by the anarcho- punk subculture. According to author John King, the animal stance of anarcho- punk spread through all areas of punk, especially the traveller, hardcore, straight edge, and folk-punk scenes. Despite this, writer and musician Andy Martin of the influential band the Apostles was not as enthusiastic, stating in 2014 that \\"Dave Morris and Helen Steel, for example, have achieved more for the campaign against McDonald's than every punk band there has ever been. This is not to unduly berate punk bands, but they must be regarded in the correct perspective...\\" Several animal rights activists such as Rod Coronado, Craig Rosebraugh, Isa Chandra Moskowitz, and David J. Wolfson were initially inspired by anarcho-punk bands.  Straight edge and hardcore punk   Characteristics  Clothing items with straight edge and animal rights patches in English and German Beyond the basic tenets of straight edge (complete abstention from alcohol, tobacco and any recreational drug), its participants can lead their lifestyles freely, but an investigation by Ross Haenfler of the University of Mississippi revealed some underlying values across the movement: healthy living, improving one's and others' lives, commitment to straight edge, refraining from casual sex, and involvement in progressive causes. Among the last, two of the most adopted are animal rights and vegetarian lifestyles, which many see as a logical extension of living a positive, non-exploitative lifestyle and equate the harm and immorality of drugs with animal products. Many straight edge activists credit their empathy towards animal suffering and their actions to stop it to the permanent state of consciousness that their sober lifestyle gives them. Straight edge, as most subcultures, is not inherently political but its participants seek to \\"remoralise\\" dominant culture through their individual acts of resistance. However, it often serves as a bridge to further political involvement, especially in social justice and progressive causes. The scholar Simon J. Bronner observes the lack of political homogeneity within the ideology, noting that there have been radical, religious, anarchist, and conservative straight edge bands, sometimes-tensely-coexisting in local scenes. For example, Earth Crisis, Vegan Reich and Chokehold all advocate veganism and sobriety, but disagree on other issues. Sociologist William Tsitsos pointed out that some of the most influential American straight edge bands that espoused animal rights focused only on personal morality, even when referring to corporations, while some of their European counterparts saw these lifestyles as part of a larger left-wing challenge against capitalism. He argues that, to a large extent, this was the result of the neoliberal and welfare politics that respectively dominated these territories. The most controversial offshoot that advocated animal rights was hardline, a biocentric militant ideology that combines veganism, revolutionary politics and an Abrahamic view of the natural order, thus abjuring homosexuality and abortion. Hardline was largely marginalised and remained a fringe phenomenon. The sacredness of life belief introduced by hardline and Krishna Consciousness did not only embrace animals, but also unborn children. This influenced the anti-abortion stance of some of the most religiously committed animal rights activists and created a rift with those who supported it.  Influences and first contacts  In the mid- to late 1980s, American hardcore punk music and particularly its subculture straight edge began to get involved in animal rights and environmentalism. Journalist Brian Peterson attributes diverse influences on this relationship beyond anarcho-punk: the post-hardcore band Beefeater, the 1985 album Meat Is Murder by British post-punk band the Smiths, the Hare Krishna tradition, and the vegetarian rapper KRS-One. On the other hand, Pike notes two origins for the activists that would later emerge from the scene: the political one, which started with the arrival of the Animal Liberation Front from England, and the religious one, influenced by the Hare Krishna faith. Pioneering this trend were the 1986 songs \\"Do Unto Others\\" by Cro-Mags, a band with Hare Krishna members, and \\"Free At Last\\" by Youth of Today, straight edgers, both criticising slaughterhouses in a verse.  Establishment  After those first contacts, works such as Diet for a New America (1987) by John Robbins and Animal Liberation (1975) by Peter Singer increasingly began to circulate between the members of the scene, influencing bands and zines. By this time Youth of Today had become the most popular straight edge group, propagating the youth crew subculture, and included the pro-vegetarian song \\"No More\\" and a recommendation of vegetarian literature in their 1988 album We're Not In This Alone. Several straight edge bands followed this trend, including Insted and Gorilla Biscuits. In the early 1990s, the straight edge offshoot krishnacore was developed, which among its principles includes vegetarianism, centred on the bands Shelter (formed by two ex members of Youth of Today) and 108. Haenfler estimates that at this time three out of four straight edgers in Denver, Colorado were vegetarians and that among them were many vegans. However, it did not take long before the new vocal vegetarians received a backlash from punks who considered these issues private. Analogously, in the late 1980s, the hardcore punk subgenre powerviolence was established in California, featuring politically militant lyrics that also address animal rights. One of its most notable bands are Dropdead, who took cues from anarcho-punk and a strong animal activist stance.  Propagation and militance  Earth Crisis in 1996 The Californian band Vegan Reich, formed in the anarcho-punk community, released their self-titled EP in 1990 along with a manifesto that ushered in hardline, a biocentric, militant, vegan, anti-drugs, and sexually conservative ideology. Vegan Reich frontman Sean Muttaqi stated he started the band to \\"spread a militant animal liberation message,\\" but ended up disillusioned with hardliners as they were \\"all-consumed with minute details or inward shit\\" by the end of his band in 1993. The hardline scene was small, had few associated acts (including Raid and Statement), and its principles on sexuality and abortion marginalised them to a large extent, but its stances on animal rights were innovative and helped to push veganism, direct action and increase awareness on animal liberation in hardcore punk. Vegan Reich also infused a more metal sound into straight edge. The debates arising from the new moral tendencies in hardcore prompted animal rights to become predominant in the 1990s. Animal groups such as People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals (PETA) began to set up stalls at shows, distributing free literature. These organisations paid for advertisement in zines, some of which devoted their entire content to discuss these causes. Consequently, the association between straight edge and vegetarianism or veganism soon permeated the whole scene and gave rise to a predominantly militant branch centred on veganism: vegan straight edge. One of its pioneering bands was Chokehold from Ontario, Canada, but the ideology was largely popularised and radicalised by Earth Crisis from Syracuse, New York, whose lyrics from their 1995 debut album Destroy the Machines \\"read like passages from Earth First!, Animal Liberation Front, and Earth Liberation Front direct-action essays.\\" Other notable American vegan straight edge bands during the 1990s were Birthright (Indiana), Culture (Florida), Day of Suffering (North Carolina), Green Rage (New York), Morning Again (Florida), and Warcry (Indiana). By and large, their style was a blend of hardcore punk and extreme metal known as metalcore. The vegan straight edge record label Catalyst Records was founded in Indiana in the early 1990s as well. Live show by Italian vegan straight edge band To Kill in 2006 Vegan straight edge soon influenced bands from many countries, including Sweden (Refused and Abhinanda), Portugal (New Winds), and Brazil (Point of No Return). In Belgium, straight edge bands such as ManLiftingBanner also advocated vegetarian diets and the Ieperfest vegan hardcore festival was founded in 1993, which would also influence the creation of the Czech vegan Fluff Fest in 2000. In Umeå, the city of Refused and Abhinanda, the number of 15-year-old vegetarians increased to 16% in 1996. Since the mid-1990s, the hardcore scene of São Paulo, Brazil has been highly organised, politicised and involved in animal rights by a collective that incorporated straight edge, anarchism, and the Hare Krishna tradition. One of its branches established the Verdurada drug and meat free festival in 1996, in which a vegan dinner is served at the end to the attendees. A portion of the Israeli hardcore scene intertwined straight edge, animal rights and anarchism at this period as well. Inspired by these developments, some young people joined radical groups for animal rights and environmentalism such as the Animal Liberation Front (A.L.F.), Animal Defense League (A.D.L.), Sea Shepherd Conservation Society and Earth First! An increase in Animal Liberation Front activism in North America corresponds with the rise of vegan straight edge and hardline bands through the 1990s. The majority of animal rights activists imprisoned in the late 1990s and early 2000s were involved in hardcore punk. Despite the preponderance of this association, some people in the scene felt that militancy was taken to the extreme and they often responded reactionarily. Direct action methods were especially debated for the aggression and sometimes criminality they meant. In the late 1990s, several vegan straight edge bands had split up and soon the ideology took a back seat in the American hardcore subculture, but its impact on the scene has lasted and become \\"almost inextricably linked\\" to it.  Impact  Journalist Will Potter affirms that the hardcore subculture \\"was even more influential\\" for activists than its British predecessor, with both having \\"had a formative, lasting impact on\\" the radical animal rights and environmental movements. Peterson states that the impact of animal rights on hardcore is felt not only in the scene, but also in the collective consciousness and many activists who developed there. Dylan Clark of the University of Toronto wrote that straight edge's advocacy of veganism ultimately fed it into the entire punk spectrum. Several animal rights activists such as Peter Daniel Young, several members of Stop Huntingdon Animal Cruelty 7 (SHAC 7), and Walter Bond were initially inspired by straight edge bands.  Mainstream and other manifestations  In Germany, the punk zine Ox-Fanzine was founded in 1989 and began publishing vegan cookbooks. In later years, there has been an influx of punk-themed cookbooks published by large publishing houses, including How It All Vegan (1999) by Sarah Kramer and Tanya Barnard, and Vegan with a Vengeance (2005) by Isa Chandra Moskowitz. Several punks have set up vegetarian restaurants across the United States after noticing the lack of catering towards them. Cosmetic and clothing companies also began to serve to their new punk-vegan niche market, including lines by Manic Panic (company started by former members of Blondie) and Kat Von D. Since 2001, Vans Warped Tour has been affiliated with PETA, including food vendors that distribute animal rights information. Other large punk festivals such as Rebellion in 2011 have turned their backstage caterings entirely vegetarian. The ska-punk band Goldfinger, formed in 1994, started as a \\"fun\\" project but since their fourth album, Open Your Eyes (2002), their frontman and now prolific producer John Feldmann became a member of PETA and put animal rights at the forefront of their music. In Spain and some Latin American countries, several punk bands have written songs against bullfighting.

Biography  He was one of five children born to a sculptor and woodcarver.\\"Jaroslav Pstrak - A Forgotten Name\\" @ Aratta When he was only a year old, his family moved to Kolomyia in a fruitless effort to improve their financial situation. By the time he was five, he had displayed an interest in painting. Later, while attending the gymnasium there, he was expelled for spending all of his time drawing cartoons rather than studying. His father was able to get him reinstated, but he was expelled a second time for drawing caricatures of his teachers. During this time, he received some informal lessons from the artists who visited his home; notably Kornylo Ustiyanovych. Hutsul with a Pipe (postcard) His father's financial affairs worsened, however, and debtors seized their property. Shortly after, his father fled and his mother died, leaving him and his siblings orphaned. He had to work at menial tasks to support himself until 1895, when he found a patron who supplied the funds necessary to enroll at the Academy of Fine Arts, Munich. After graduating, he settled in Lviv, where he soon established himself as a portrait painter and illustrator. In 1901, he took a study trip to Western Europe. Later, he executed numerous church paintings, often working together with . Fromm 1903 to 1907, he lived in small Hutsul villages; painting scenes from the folk culture and people in native costume, as well as preserving examples of traditional architecture. He also began to illustrate works of literature by, among others, Gogol and Ivan Franko. he returned to Kolomyia on several occasions between 1909 and 1913. After that, he resumed his work as a portrait painter. His last known works were a series of mythological scenes painted in 1915. However, World War I had interrupted his work to the point that he sank into poverty, which undermined his health. By late 1915, an unspecified nervous disorder, combined with starvation, led him to seek care at a military hospital in Kharkiv. He died there in the Spring of 1916. In the 1910s and 1920s, postcards were very popular in Ukraine. From 1912 to 1914 the publisher, , alone produced more than 120 designs; most of them based on paintings by Pstrak. Today, as a result, many of his works are better known, or only known, in their postcard form, rather than the originals. Christ is Risen! (postcard) Streets in Lviv and Ivano-Frankivsk have been named after him, as has the children's art school in Kolomyia. In 2003, a collection of 176 of his postcard images was published.

The country is one of the world’s most successful arms exporters. According to the analysis by Action on Armed Violence, Military arms deals have been prepared £39bn between 2008 and 2017. According to the Campaign Against Arms Trade, the UK mostly has exported arms to United States of America, India, France, Germany, Italy, Oman , South Africa, Turkey, South Korea, United Arab Emirates, Saudi Arabia respectively. History UK Trade and investment reveals that “The UK is one of the world’s most successful defence exporters, averaging second place in the global rankings on a rolling ten-year basis, making it Europe’s leading defence exporter in the period”.Also, the UK is known as the most robust export control government in the world. Every application is considered on a case-by-case basis against the Consolidated EU and National Arms Export Licensing Criteria. It is proctored, as DIT spokesman reported. According to the analysis by Action on Armed Violence, military arms deals have been prepared £39bn between 2008 and 2017, £12bn of which belongs to states included on the Foreign and Commonwealth Office human rights “priority countries” list. The analysis of the figures, collated by the Campaign Against the Arms Trade using export control data from the Department for International Trade is indicating a growing trend. As CAAT mentioned, It is probable to be “conservative estimate” because of an opaque system of “open” licenses that allow an unlimited number for exporting, but less scrutiny of “open” licenses has been denied by the DIT. In 2016, 5,782 export licenses for military items in countries of concern which provide £1.5bn was reported. British sales worldwide UK Arms Exports to Saudi Arabia The Audit of the Government’s Annual Report on Strategic Export Controls reported that the UK-made arms were exported to 159 countries in 2000. Since 2010 Britain arms have been transferred to the 51 countries, 22 of which were mentioned on the UK Government’s own human rights watch list. Most were located in Middle Eastern countries where terror threats have been increasing steadily. In 2016 most of arms exports went to 18 countries including China, Saudi Arabia, Bahrain, Israel, Egypt, and Pakistan.In 2017 Israel was the second-biggest buyer of UK arms which was appointed on the Foreign and Commonwealth Office’s (FCO) human rights priority list, Also Bahrain paid £30.7m for UK arms, Egypt bought £6.5m of arms and Pakistan, £11.2m. £11.8m was paid by China. The Bangladeshi government which had taken more than 688,000 Rohingya refugees from Myanmar following ethnic cleansing and religious persecution there, bought £38.6m of arms. The Uk’s main arms deals go to United States of America, India, France, Germany, Italy, Oman, South Africa, Turkey, South Korea, United Arab Emirates, Saudi Arabia respectively. The arms manufactured in the UK includes bombs, missiles, and fighter jets, machine guns. The shelf-life of weapons is often longer than the governments and situations they were sold to. Arms control As CAAT’s Andrew Smith told, Theresa May’s government is strongly supporting some countries that even it believes are accountable for human rights abuses. There are no controls over how these arms will be used when they have been sold by the UK. The arms sales being agreed today could be used to fuel atrocities for years to come. Human rights abuses are observed by UK-made fighter jets and bombs in the Saudi-led destruction of Yemen. He added, This kind of Arm trade not only leads to “human rights abusers with the means to kill” but also it provides the position of political support. In 2016, most of the UK arm was exported to countries listed as human rights abusers. While the UK rules confirms that this government doesn’t deal with countries accused of violent human rights, in the last 4 years almost half of UK arms have been transferred to Saudi Arabia including sky-rocketed, based on UK government statistics significantly reported. As guardian reported “Britain is Saudi Arabia’s second largest arms dealer after the US, providing military exports worth £10.3bn over the past decade despite continued condemnation of the kingdom’s use of British weaponry in its bombing of Yemen”.In other words, Saudi Arabia has been mentioned as Britain’s largest arms customer. In April 2020, CAAT analysis of figures revealed that the UK in 2019 sold arms worth £1.3bn to 26 out of 48 nations classified as “not free” by Freedom House. The data also stated that the sale of weaponry increased by 300 per cent as compared to 2018. In June 2020, the UK government came under criticism for export of CS gas, teargas and rubber bullets to the USA. which were being used against Black Lives Matter protesters. On July 8, 2020, the UK government revealed that they would start selling weapons to Saudi Arabia after a government report found there had been no “pattern” of Saudi Arabia air strikes that breached international law. However, the move sparked anger with Labour Shadow Secretary Emily Thornberry quoting resumption as “morally indefensible”.

Biography  Born Safiatou Zongo, 8 January, 1976, in Ouagadougou, she is the daughter of Mahamadi Zongo and Minata Ouedraogo. Initially, she invested herself in economics and business; in fact, after working for a number of companies, she made her own, Afrique Construction SA, in March 2004, of which she became CEO, despite being in a country where entrepreneurs are rarely women.\\"L’Afrique sub-saharienne.

When then-President Blaise Compaoré, who had been in power for more than 25 years, attempted to modify the constitutional law that limited presidential terms in 2014, the country was rife with dissent. Unsurprisingly, therefore, Zongo joined the movement leading the dissent and helped campaign; in particular, she engaged with the Association pour la promotion de la démocratie et participation citoyenne (Association for the Promotion of Democracy and Citizen Participation), which she became president of, and was highly influential in the 2014 Burkinabé uprising. After 2014, she continued her activism. Namely, by participating in the coordination of Civil Society Organisations and by becoming deputy spokesperson in charge of drafting the charter of transition. From the beginning of 2015, she began worrying about the position of the Regiment of Presidential Security within the Burkinabé armed forces, and fought against the failed coup d'état of September, 2015, where the regiment played a key role. She supported Roch Marc Christian Kaboré in the Presidential Election, and Kaboré became President in November, 2015. In the following years, she remained attentive to maintenance of public liberties. In June, 2018, her presence was noticed among speakers of a protest against a presidential action. At 21:30, 29 August, 2018, while home with her children, she was arrested by the anti-terrorism department of the Burkinabé police force for reasons that remain unrevealed. The arrest provoked a certain public stirring.

Mathews helped to strengthen the college’s finances as it doubled its annual budget, increased enrollment, added several facilities and expanded its graduate programs during his tenure. The Greater Conejo Valley Chamber of Commerce named him “Man of the Year” in 1985 in recognition of his service to community organizations such as Habitat for Humanity, Hospice of the Conejo and the Conejo Future Foundation.

Archived at https://www.vcstar.com/story/news/education/2018/10/31/cal-lutheran-president- mark-mathews-dies/1832978002/ Career California Lutheran College’s Board of Regents appointed Mark Mathews as acting college President in February of 1972. Prior to his appointment, Mathews was the Chairman of the Business Administration and Economics Department. By-laws were amended at the October Convocation to allow Mathews, a Presbyterian, to serve in the capacity of president, a position normally reserved for Lutherans. Mathews, a graduate of UCLA who earned his advanced degrees in Business Administration from the University of Southern California, had spent thirteen years as a professor at Los Angeles Valley College. He designed the award-winning Business Management Forum in 1972, designed to build bridges to the business community. The Forum was later renamed in his honor (“Mathews Leadership Forum”) and brought numerous business leaders to Cal Lutheran to talk to students on important issues. The Board of Regents offered him the permanent position of President in July 1972, and Mathews became the college’s third chief executive. He postponed his inauguration until October of 1973 when an outdoor inauguration was held at Mt. Clef Stadium followed by a picnic barbecue in Kingsmen Park.Hekhuis, Mary (1984). California Lutheran College: The First Quarter- Century. Thousand Oaks, CA: California Lutheran College Press. Pages 50-52.Hughes, Richard Thomas and William B. Adrian (1997). Models for Christian Higher Education: Strategies for Survival and Success in the Twenty- first Century. Wm. B. Eerdmans Publishing. Page 107. . For his cabinet, Mathews appointed Peter Ristuben, a former Dean at Wagner College, Vice President for Academic Affairs; Roald Kindem, a minister from the American Lutheran Church as Vice President for Development; A. Dean Buchanan, Vice President for Business and Finance from Pacific Lutheran University, in the same capacity. Furthermore, he elevated the campus pastor, a position held by Gerald Swanson, to the cabinet level, in order to emphasize the importance of religion in his administration. One of the first steps of the new administration was to install a budget planning process which involved input from all segments of the administration and all faculty departments. As a result, Mathews’ years at Cal Lutheran were recognized for its financial stability and balanced budgets. An indication of his business approach was an instruction of annual reports, outlining financial operations and budgets for the Regents, constituent groups, foundations, and corporations. Mathews also formed the Committee for New Dimensions to reach into the business community of nearby Los Angeles and other civic, county, and industrial leaders. Efforts were made to recruit corporate leadership. It was also during Mathews’ administration that the Chair of the Faculty Association and the President of the Associated Students of CLC (ASCLC) became members of the Board of Regents.Hekhuis, Mary (1984). California Lutheran College: The First Quarter- Century. Thousand Oaks, CA: California Lutheran College Press. Pages 52-53. In the fall of 1979 he presented his resignation to the Board of Regents effective May, 1980, after eight years as President.

He is best known as the contemporary, friend, and disciple of the celebrated Tamil poet and philosopher Valluvar. Biography Elelasingan is mentioned as Elaela and Alara in Ceylon history, who lived between 144 BCE and 101 BCE. However, given the fact that Elelasingan was a contemporary of Valluvar and with the date of Valluvar remaining dubious, it is still under debate whether Elaela of Cylone was the same person as Elelasingan. Elelasingan belonged to the Karaya or Parava community and was a merchant by profession. He was also the chief of the townsmen at Mylapore. He was wealthy and is said to have owned vessels and had trade with foreign countries, chiefly Ceylon. He also sold thread to Valluvar, who earned a living by engaging in his occupation as a weaver. Over the years, Elelasingan became a close friend and a disciple of Valluvar. Elelasingan and his wife had been without a child for years. One day when visiting the local Shiva temple, they found a baby lying beside a cow. The couple adopted the baby as their own and named it Arlyakananthar. It is believed that it was none other than Arlyakananthar who requested Valluvar to \\"write an ethical treatise for the world's good.\\" Valluvar acceded and eventually authored the Kural text. Elelasingan, along with other friends, advised Valluvar to travel to Madurai and present his work at the Pandiyan King's court. When Valluvar did so and returned triumphantly, Elelasingan and others welcomed him and celebrated the happening. At the point of Valluvar’s death, Elelasingan expressed his intention to place Valluvar's corpse in a golden coffin and place it in a monumental grave. Valluvar, however, politely refused and instead requested Elelasingan to tie his corpse with cords and throw it among the bushes outside the town so that scavenging animals can feed on it. Elelasingan obeyed and soon observed that the crows and other animals that fed on his corpse \\"became beautiful as gold.\\" He soon built a temple on the spot where Valluvar's corpse had lain and instituted worship. The temple remains today in Mylapore. Legacy Elelasingan is traditionally remembered for his faithful following of the philosophy of Valluvar. The old Tamil maxim \\"ஏலேலசிங்கன் பொருள் ஏழுகடல் போனாலும் திரும்பும்\\" (literally \\"The goods of Elelasingan make a safe return albeit crossing seven seas\\") and the work songs of \\"Elelo elavali\\" and \\"Elelo aylasa\\", which are traditionally sung by hard laborers of the Tamil land during their toil at work to mitigate their drudgery, remain embedded in the Tamil culture as the sole surviving legacy of Elelasingan.

They are among the several different ecclesiastical communities that splintered out of the once undivided Saint Thomas Christians; an ancient Christian community whose origins goes back to the first century missionary activities of Saint Thomas the Apostle, in the present day South Indian state of Kerala. The Apostle, as legend has it, arrived in Malankara (derived from Maliankara near Muziris) in AD 52.  Origins  In November 1795, a treaty of perpetual friendship and tributary alliance was signed between the Rajah of Travancore and the East India Company. The treaty was again modified in 1805, which established British paramountcy over Travancore. The beginning of the relationship between the Anglican Church Mission Society and the ancient Malankara Church could be traced to the Rev R H Kerr and the Rev Claudius Buchanan, who paid visits to the Malabar Syrians in 1806, during the episcopate of Mar Dionysius I. The missionaries found the Malabar Syrian Christians in poor and depressed conditions. This is clear in the words of the Syrian Metropolitan Mar Dionysius I, in his interview with Claudius Buchanan, recorded in Dr. Buchanan's famous book \\"Christian Researches in Asia\\"; in which Mar Dionysius I says, \\"you have come to visit a declining church\\". In 1810, Colonel John Munro, a man with deep Christian convictions became the British Resident of Travancore, an office he held for the next 10 years. Col Munro persuaded the Rani of Travancore, with whom he was in very good terms to donate land in Kottayam as well as the money and timber, in-order to build the Orthodox Pazhaya Seminary (founded 1815) for the Malankara Church. He also petitioned the Anglican Church Missionary Society to send missionaries on a Help Mission, to educate and train the clergy of the Malankara Church. In the coming years, several pious Christian men like Benjamin Bailey, Joseph Fenn and Henry Baker (Sr) arrived in Kottayam and worked at the Pazhaya Seminary and among the Malankara Syrians. The missionaries took charge of the college as it early Principals for training the younger Malankara Church clergy and worked on the translation of the Holy Bible to the native language Malayalam. However the cordial relations between the missionaries and the Malankara Syrians did not last very long. The younger missionaries who arrived later were uncompromising evangelists who insisted on major reforms to the Malankara Jacobite Church, which the changed Jacobite leadership didn't want. The discord and rifts eventually led to the 1836 Malankara Jacobite Synod of Mavelikkara, in which the Jacobite Syrian Community under Mar Dionysios IV, decided to keep all their Syriac ecclesiastical traditions and be subject to the authority of the Syriac Patriarch of Antioch. Inevitably, the missionaries and the Malankara Jacobites parted ways and the missionaries continued their work on their own. Nevertheless, the two decades of their association and involvement left a profound and lasting impact on the Malankara Syrian community; calls for reformation were to come from within the Church, later. In 1836, as soon as the missionaries separated from the Malankara Syrian Church, a minority from the Church who were in favor of the reformed ideologies of the missionaries sought membership in the Anglican Church and were admitted. These St. Thomas Anglicans were the first reformed group to emerge from the St. Thomas Christian community. Initially the Anglican Syrian community was concentrated in the areas of Travancore where the missionaries had earlier worked with the Malankara Syrians.  British Period  St. Thomas Anglicans benefited from the English education imparted by the missionaries and joined them in their work. The missionaries were the pioneers who promoted mass education in Travancore and people from all sections of society joined the various schools and the Cotym College established by the Church Mission Society. They also started the C.M.S. Press (first printing press of Kerala) in 1821, in Kottayam.Benjamin Bailiyum Malayala Saahityavum. By Dr. Babu Cherian. Published by the Department of Printing and Publishing, Mahatma Gandhi University, Kottayam. Anglican Syrian Christians served as teachers in the educational institutions and worked in the other institutions established by the Church Mission Society, taking charge of them, later. Some worked along with the missionaries in their evangelical and reformative activities among the poor and backward communities. Some served the Government. Several were ordained into priesthood in the Anglican Church and the Anglican Diocese of Travancore and Cochin was established in 1879. St. Thomas Anglicans provided the greater part of the leadership of the Anglican Diocese of Travancore and Cochin.  Formation of the Church of South India  During the extensive dialogues that preceded the formation of the Church of South India, the Anglican party while accepting the ministries of all uniting denominations, argued for the introduction of an episcopate in historic succession (from the Anglican Church) into the envisioned United Church, by bestowing episcopal ordinations upon all candidates to bishoprics drawn from non-episcopal traditions. They also insisted that all ordinations after the union should be exclusively episcopal, conferred only by existing bishops with the imposition of hands, so that in the fullness of time the entire ministry of the United Church would be in apostolic succession. These were eventually accepted. Accordingly on 27 September 1947, as part of the inauguration of the Church of South India, the presiding bishop Rt. Rev. Dr. Cherakarottu Korula Jacob of the Anglican diocese of Travancore and Cochin, along with other Anglican bishops and senior presbyters of the uniting denominations, vested all new candidates to bishoprics with episcopal ordinations. The Church of South India was thus realized and since then the Anglican Syrian Christians came to be known as CSI Syrian Christians.  Anglican Syrian Christians today  After acceding to the CSI, the Anglican Diocese of Travancore and Cochin was renamed as the Madhya Kerala Diocese. Although the majority of CSI Syrian Christians have their roots in this diocese, like other Saint Thomas Christian communities, many moved out of Kerala after Indian independence to other Indian states and the rest of the world, starting new congregations. Many of these congregations are out side of the South Indian Anglican province and hence fall under the ecclesiastical jurisdiction of the respective provincial bishops, at least technically. Although the cumulative number of Syrian Christians in the South Indian and other Anglican provinces is difficult to determine, it is roughly estimated that they constitute about 4% (approximately 152,000) of the 3.8 million members of the Church of South India.  Relations with other Saint Thomas Christians  Due to familial and social ties, Anglican Syrian Christians have always been in cordial relations with the Malankara Syrians and the Jacobite and Orthodox factions that came of it. This continued due to the historic reality that for well over half a century since their split in 1836, the Malankara Church was the only Church that existed in Travancore-Cochin area, from which the Anglican Syrians could get partners in marriage, outside of their own community. By 1889, the reformists of the Malankara Church separated as an independent Reformed Eastern denomination, choosing the name Mar Thoma Syrian Church in 1898. Since then ecumenical ties have developed with them as well; the Mar Thoma Church is in partnership and full communion with the Church of South India.

His father was Bande Ali. Between 1966–1967, Sikder moved from his birthplace to the Khulna District.bd- pratidin.com, 15 December, 2013 After arriving in Khulna, Ershad worked as a railway worker for some time. From there, he began gradually robbing along the railway lines and joined a gang. Later, he formed his own gang and earned the name Ranga Chora from the locals. Between 1976 and 1977, he formed another gang named Ramada Bahini, which was involved in theft, robberies and terrorist activities along the Khulna Railway Station and the Ghat area. Together with his gang, Ershad occupied the 4th and 5th areas of Ghat, making it his exclusive regulator.  Entry into politics  In 1982, after the fall of former president Hussain Muhammad Ershad, Sikder entered politics through the Jatiya Party. In the 1988 election during the military rule, Sikder was elected as the Commissioner of Ward 8. After forming the BNP government in 1991, Sikder joined it. On December 26, 1996, he again changed his party to the Awami League, but soon after being criticized, he was expelled. At the time of his 1999 arrest, he was still the Commissioner of Ward 8.  Criminal acts and murders  After entering politics, Sikder's power grew. From 1984 to 1986, he was involved in the possession of Khulna properties, occupying private property, the drug trade, extortion and other criminal activities. In 1991, he drove out the owner of an ice factory named Rafiq, from the 4th Ghat area, appropriated the ice factory and forced all traders to buy ice from him. It is also known that he used the ice factory as his torture center. Ershad was accused of more than 60 murders, together with one of his collaborators, Rajasakshi Nure Alam. The latter later gave a statement in the court describing 24 killings, further claiming that Sikder has more than 70 victims, although only one weapon was recovered from his house, known as the \\"Swarnakamal\\".  Personal life  It is known that Sikder was married six times. His first wife was Khodeja Begum, whom he married in 1973. Another wife, named Sanjida Akter Shobha, received a luxurious gold house. Aside from them, there were a Taslima of Rupsha Rajapur village, a Farida of Bagerhat, Rampal Upazila; another unknown wife and a Durgargaire of Pyakgacha. Nure Alam also alleged that his wife Hira was tortured by Ershad. Ershad's first wife Khodeja gave birth to four children: three sons and a daughter. After his arrest, a fifth child was born, a girl named Jannatul Noorin Emily Essa.  Arrest and death  Sikder was arrested in 1999, with 43 cases filed under his name. During a trial at the lower court, he was sentenced to death in seven murder cases, along with additional four life sentences.

It was thought that the insects had been accidentally introduced on plants imported from Thailand. Description The body of the adult is cylindrical in form, long, slender and flexible, adapted for the tubular galleries in which the insects live. It is about long and has a head longer than it is wide. The eyes are dark, and the female's eyes are smaller than those of the male. The first thoracic segment is smaller than the second and third. The female is mid-brown on the head, the basal three segments of the 15-segment antennae, the anterior part of the thorax and the fore-legs, while the rest of the insect is dark brown. The female has no wings. The male is largely medium-brown, the antennae having 17 segments and being dark brown throughout. The male's wings are greyish- brown and the legs have pale joints.Ross, E.S. 2009. Embiidina. Pages 315-316 in Encyclopedia of Insects, V. H. Resh and R. T. Cardé, eds. Academic Press. Distribution and habitat Aposthonia ceylonica is native to tropical Africa and Asia, its range including Madagascar, Mauritius, India, Sri Lanka, Malaysia, Laos and Thailand. It is found on the bark of trees in both evergreen and deciduous forests, plantations, orchards and parks. In February 2019, a colony of the species was found on the roots of an orchid at the Royal Horticultural Society's garden at Wisley, Surrey, England. As an introduced species it represents the first new order of insects to be found living in Great Britain since stick insects were discovered living in Devon in 1909. Ecology A. ceylonica is semi-social, a group of insects living in a gallery of tunnels, usually an adult female and its nymphal offspring. After shedding its last nymphal skin, the male consumes the exuviae, and then does not feed again. He searches for a mate after which he will not live for long. The nymphs and the adult females are herbivorous. The female exhibits some degree of parental care of the eggs and newly-hatched nymphs. Both male and female secrete silk, the male continuing to do so despite fasting, and in fact having larger silk glands than the female. Silk production The adult insects spin fine silken threads composed of amino acids which are water repellent and have an alkane-rich surface coating. In natural surroundings, the webbing surrounding the colony prevents the insects from being swept off the bark by a tropical downpour and provides protection against predators.

Originally named Little Caesar's when it was founded by Arthur Nicolakakis in Pretoria. The chain was rebranded in 2002 and renamed Roman's Pizza. The company is known for its two for one pizza promotions with a business model that seeks to minimize prices whilst maintaining quality. The company's CEO John Nicolakakis was involved in a minor controversy in 2018 when he was recorded making threatening remarks about rival pizza restaurant chains stating that he would \\"burn them down\\" and \\"go to war with them\\". The company had to issue an apology to a Durban-based franchisee in 2015 and pay R200,000 for refusing to allow the franchisee to open a halaal franchise. The given reason at the time for the refusal was that the franchisee was not Muslim.

He served as a sergeant in the King's Own Yorkshire Light Infantry, and played football for Grantham as an amateur. He had a trial with Nottingham Forest towards the end of the 1920–21 season, before signing professional forms with Grantham in July. Bunting signed for Leicester City in March 1922.

The headquarters of the Ural Army received the rights of a separate army headquarters. The composition and number varied between 15 and 25 thousand, depending on the situation on the fronts and the territory of action. This mostly isolated army experienced a constant and strong lack of weapons and ammunition. Most of the time the Army was formally under command of Admiral Kolchak, at the end of 1919 – beginning of 1920, it tried to coordinate with Anton Denikin.  Actions  It first acted against Red Guard units, from June 1918 against the 4th and 1st armies of the Red Eastern Front and from August 15 against the Red Turkestan Front. In April 1919, during the general offensive of Kolchak's armies, it broke through the Red's front and besieged Uralsk, which had been abandoned in January 1919. It also approached Saratov and Samara, but its limited means did not allow to capture the Urals. The Ural Army consisted of: * 1st Ural Cossack Corps (1st and 2nd Ural Cossack Divisions), * 2nd Iletsk Cossack Corps, * 3rd Ural-Astrakhan Cossack Corps. In early July 1919, the troops of the Red Turkestan Front launched a counteroffensive against the Ural Army. The well- equipped 25th Infantry Division, commanded by Vasily Chapayev and redeployed from Ufa, defeated units of the Ural Army on July 5–11, broke through the blockade of Uralsk, and entered the city on July 11 1919. The Ural Army began to retreat on all fronts. On September 5, 1919, the Ural Army obtained its last success when it executed the Lbishchensk raid, in which the divisional headquarters of the Red 25th Infantry Division were ambushed near Lbishchensk and commander Vasily Chapayev and some 2,500 soldiers were killed.  Defeat  But after the collapse of Kolchak's Eastern Front in October-November 1919, the Ural Army was isolated by superior forces of the Reds, thereby losing all sources of replenishment with weapons and ammunition. The defeat of the Ural Army by the Bolsheviks was only a matter of time. On November 2, the Red Turkestan Front consisting of the 1st and 4th armies (18,500 infantry, 3,500 cavalry, 86 guns and 365 machine guns) launched a general offensive against the Ural Army (5,200 infantry, 12,000 cavalry, 65 guns, 249 machine guns), planning to surround and destroy the main forces of the Ural Army with concentrated attacks on Lbishchensk from the north and east. Under the pressure of the superior forces of the Reds, the Ural Army began a retreat. On November 20, the Reds captured Lbishchensk, but they could not surround the main force of the Ural Army. The front stabilized south of Lbishchensk. The Turkestan Front called up reserves and was replenished with weapons and ammunition. The Ural Army had neither reserves nor ammunition. On December 10, 1919, the Reds resumed the offensive. The resistance of the weakened Ural Army units was broken and the front collapsed. On December 11, Zhalpaktal fell and on December 18, the Reds captured the city of Tajpak, thereby cutting off the route of retreat for the Iletsk Corps. On December 22 the Gorsky settlement, one of the last strongholds of the Ural Army before the city of Guryev, was also lost. The army commander, General Vladimir Tolstov, and his staff retreated to Guryev on the Caspian Sea. The remnants of the Iletsk Corps, suffering heavy losses in the battles during the retreat and from typhus, were almost completely destroyed or captured by Red troops near Malyy Baybuz on January 4, 1920. At the same time, the Kirghiz regiment of this corps almost completely went over to the side of the troops of the Alash Autonomy, which at that time acted as allies of the Bolsheviks. The Kirghiz captured the headquarters of the Iletsk corps, the 4th and 5th Iletsky divisions, and handed them over as prisoners to the red Corps commander. Lieutenant-General Vladimir Akutin was shot by the troops of the 25th (\\"Chapayevsky\\") division (according to other sources, was arrested and taken to Moscow, where he was later shot). The 6th Iletsk Division, which retreated to the Volga across the steppe of the Bukey Horde, was almost completely whipped out by disease, hunger and Red Army bullets.  Death March  On January 5, 1920, the city of Guryev was taken by the Red Army. A part of the Ural Army became prisoners, a part of the Cossacks went over to the Reds. The remnants of the Ural Army, led by the army commander General V.S. Tolstov, decided to leave for the south, hoping to unite with the White Turkestan Army of General Boris Kazanovich. A caravan with carts and civilians (families and refugees), totaling about 15,000 people, headed south along the eastern coast of the Caspian Sea towards Fort Alexandrovsk. The march took place in January – March 1920, under very difficult conditions of a harsh winter in a deserted landscape with icy winds and frost down to minus 30 degrees and in absence of sufficient drinking water and a catastrophic shortage of food and medicine. On 10 February, the Red Army took Krasnovodsk, south of Fort Alexandrovsk. The goal was to be evacuated on ships of the Caspian Flotilla of the AFSR to the other side of the Caspian sea in Port Petrovsk. By the time of arrival at Fort Alexandrovsk, less than 3,000 Cossacks remained from the Army, most of whom suffered from different stages of typhoid or frostbite. The sense of the campaign was lost, when by the end of March 1920, Denikin's troops were retreating in the Caucasus and Port Petrovsk was abandoned. Most Cossacks were captured or killed by the Red Army at Fort Alexandrovsk. On April 4, 1920, the Ural Army had ceased to exist. Only a small detachment of 214 people (several generals, officers, Cossacks, and civilians (family members), led by Ataman Vladimir Tolstov, marched on towards Persia. 162 of them survived the march and reached Persia on June 2.the free dictionary  Army commanders  * Major General M.

The country located at the south of France has two long coastlines, one on the north on the Cantabrian Sea, another on the west and south west on the Mediterranean Sea, and a smaller one on the west and south west on the Atlantic Ocean, its territory includes a big part of the Iberian Peninsula, the Canary Islands, the Balearic Islands and two enclaves in North Africa, Ceuta and Melilla. The country has many endemic species, especially those restricted to the island groups, and mainly because of the rich geography (rivers, mountains, coastlines, deserts, basins, oceans, etc.) and the different climate zones, Spain is one of the countries in Europe with the greatest biodiversity. Geography Peninsular Spain largely consists of a highland plateau, surrounded and dissected by mountain ranges and rivers. Climate thumb|Spanish climate map. Continental oceanic climate Coastal oceanic climate Subtropical climate Mountain Climate Semiarid steppe climate Continental mediterranean climate Coastal mediterranean climate Much of the country experiences a Mediterranean climate with warm or hot, dry summers and the rainfall falling in winter. A semi-arid climate occurs in the southeastern part of Spain, but is also found in other parts of the country such as the Ebro basin. Here the summers are hot and the winters cool, but there is limited precipitation at any time of year. The northern part of the country experiences an oceanic climate (called as well cantabrian climate) with both winter and summer temperatures influenced by the proximity to the Cantabrian sea and rainfall spread throughout the year. The Balearic Islands have a Mediterranean climate, and the Canary Islands are influenced by their oceanic surroundings and proximity to Africa.World Map of Köppen-Geiger Climate Classification Biodiversity Amongst European countries, Spain has one of the highest degrees of biodiversity; this is because of its four varied, major biogeographic regions, Atlantic, Alpine, Mediterranean and Macaronesian, and the country is considered to be one of the world's biodiversity hotspots. In connection with Natura 2000, a European Union initiative, 27% of the country is included in national parks, wildlife reserves and other protected areas. Flora Cork oak woodland in Andalusia The Mediterranean coast of Spain Including the mainland and the island groups, Spain has eight to nine thousand species of vascular plants, more than any other country in Europe. Between 20 and 25% of these are endemic to the country and a higher proportion of these are threatened than in any other European country. Although there are no endemic plant families mainland Spain has 822 endemic species, and the Balearic Islands 103. Most of the plateaus, valleys and plains of the interior used to be clad in sclerophyllous and semi-deciduous forests. These were dominated by holm oak and cork oak, with wild olive and carob in the south, but only remnants of this natural vegetation remain. Much of this terrain is now covered with dense shrubland known as maquis, with scattered low trees, bushes and herbaceous plants. Stone pine and maritime pine are dominant on sandy soils, and Aleppo pine, Kermes oak and juniper in limestone areas. At higher altitudes, the Pyrenean oak is dominant up to about above which Scots pine and juniper take over. In the river valleys, only remnants remain of the natural deciduous woodland of willow, poplar, alder, ash and elm. The coastal part of northwestern Spain has plentiful deciduous forests dominated by common oak, lime, chestnut, elm, ash, maple and hazel, and where the tree cover is lacking, heather and gorse. Some parts in the southeast of the country have a form of subtropoical steppe vegetation. Fauna Pyrenean chamois Southwestern water vole Including the mainland and the island groups, Spain has an estimated sixty to seventy thousand species of animal. Of these, about seven hundred are vertebrates (excluding marine fish) and the remainder are invertebrates. The highest degree of endemism occurs among freshwater fish and in the mountainous areas, the coastal areas, and among the Canary Island fauna. About 30% of the vertebrates in Spain are threatened. Terrestrial mammals native to Spain and the island groups, include the European hedgehog, two species of mole, the Pyrenean desman and about a dozen species of shrew. There are about thirty-five species of bat, as well as the European rabbit, the European hare and two other species of hare. Larger rodents include the Eurasian beaver, the red squirrel, the Alpine marmot and the brown rat as well as about twenty-eight species of mice, voles and other small rodents. Of the ungulates, the wild boar, the fallow deer, the red deer, the roe deer, the Iberian ibex and the Pyrenean chamois are found in the country. Terrestrial carnivores include the brown bear, the Iberian wolf and the Italian wolf, the red fox, the Iberian lynx, the Eurasian lynx and the common genet. Also present are the European badger, the Eurasian otter, the stoat, the least weasel, the European polecat and the European pine marten. The coast is visited by six species of seal, and the waters around the coast by thirty species of whale, dolphin and porpoise.This information is based on the List of mammals of Spain, itself based on the IUCN Red List as found here. Common cranes flying over Castilla during their winter migration Ocellated lizard With its varied habitats, Spain has a large number of bird species, 644 having been recorded, seven of which are endemic. The endemic species are restricted to the offshore islands and include Bolle's pigeon, laurel pigeon, Canary Islands oystercatcher (extinct), Canary Islands chiffchaff, Balearic warbler, Canary Islands stonechat and Tenerife blue chaffinch. Besides the large number of resident bird species, Spain is visited in spring and autumn by many migratory birds, travelling between their over-wintering grounds in Africa and their breeding grounds in northern Europe. The upland plateaus provide habitat for Dupont's lark, horned lark, European roller and black wheatear, and the remaining sclerophyllous woodland provides overwintering for thousands of common crane and breeding areas for white storks and black storks, as well as black-winged kite, short-toed snake eagle, cinereous vulture and griffon vulture. The rivers and lakes harbour various relict freshwater fish, including the endemic Spanish minnowcarp and Luciobarbus microcephalus, and among reptiles, the Caspian turtle and European pond turtle. Other reptiles include Hermann's tortoise, Greek tortoise and pond slider, as well as four species of sea turtle. Also recorded in Spain are the common chameleon and about sixty species of lizard, worm lizard, gecko and skink, many being endemic to the Canary Islands and Balearics, and some occurring in the Spanish enclaves in North Africa. Sixteen species of snake are similarly listed for Spain.This information is based on the List of reptiles of Spain, itself based on the IUCN Red List as found here.

He was a preacher of Islam as well as a warrior. He came to India in the mid-fifteenth century during the reign of Sultan Barbak Shah and settled at Gaur.  Life  Shah Ismail Ghazi was of Arab origin and a descendant of the Prophet Muhammad. He settled in the city of Gaur. During this time Sultan Rukunuddin Barbak Shah was building a dam across the river Jhatiya-Bhatiya or Chutiaputia. All the engineers and craftsmen tried for long seven years but could not complete the dam. After hearing this Ismail approached the Sultan and suggested a scheme. After his solution proved successful, Ismail became one of the most important men in the Sultan's army, and many battles were won under his command.  Battles  Shah Ismail Ghazi's first campaign was against Gajapati Kapilendra, the king of Orissa on the south-western frontier. He defeated Gajapati and Mandaran was recovered, and he constructed a fort there. After defeat at the hands of Kameshwar, king of Kamatapur, Barbak Shah decided to send Shah Ismail. He was victorious; the king surrendered to the Sultan and converted to Islam.  Death  There are two theories regarding the death of Shah Ismail Ghazi. One is that he was slain in a war in 1474. Another theory says that after so many victories Bhandsi Rai, the commandant of Ghoraghat, was jealous of him and reported to the Sultan that Shah Ismail Ghazi was in collusion with the Raja of Kamrup. After hearing this the Sultan immediately ordered Ismail's execution in 1474 A.D(878 A.H). There are six shrines dedicated to the memory of the saint; one at Mandaran (in Jhanabad, west of Hooghly), one at Ghoraghat, and four in Pirganj in the district of Rangpur, one of those being in Baradarga.

It is found in the Indian Ocean where it is known from three South African specimens and an Indonesian specimen. It is distinguished from its congeners by the nape having an extensive black flap on both sides of its neck; 10-13 cirri which are found between the neck flaps; an entire dorsal fin; 5-6 cirri above the eye, 6-8 cirri on the noes; the males have small dark spots on their body towards the tail which merge to form short black stripes on caudal peduncle, in life the females have a brilliant yellow caudal fin while in the males only the outer half of the tail is bright yellow. The specific name honours the South African ichthyologists Phillip C. Heemstra and Elaine Heemstra both of the South African Institute for Aquatic Biodiversity. They collected all the known South African specimens of this species and took a photograph of a specimen which showed its life colours. The type were collected near Cape Vidal in KwaZulu Natal from a newly created artificial reef and the parental source of the colonisers on this reef is unknown.

The screenplay was written by Toucy Tjijambo, and the movie is almost entirely in the native Namibian language, Otjiherero.  Plot Summary  The film follows Vezuva, a young Ovaherero woman who returns from her studies abroad, in Germany, only to discover that her married cousin has passed away, and that according to tradition, she is expected to marry her cousin's widower. Vezuva complies with her family's wishes, although she is in love with someone else, and finds herself trapped in an abusive relationship. By the end of the film, she turns her family's attitude around and is able to leave, with their blessing.  Background  The film's title, Tjiraa, is short for the Otjiherero word for \\"cousin\\", tjiramue. The marriage tradition described in the film is a long-standing one, which developed in order to retain wealth and power within tribes and families in times of trouble. The tradition, however, creates situations such as the one faces by Vezuva, in which she is expected to live within a violent and abusive marriage, lacking in any basis of love, affection or respect. The film's message is that even traditions that were formed for good reasons, or with good intentions, can become harmful and negative. In the film, Vezuva's family - including her mother, who is the one who pushed her to marry - see the harm and change their attitude. The social change occurring in this narrative reflects the existing discourse in Ovaherero society, which attempting to navigate and balance between tradition and modern life.  Production and Release  The film was financed by the Namibia Film Commission. It was selected for screening at multiple international film festivals, including the New York film festival, African Diaspora International Film Festival, and Cannes Film Festival.

At the time of her death members of the establishment were implicated in her murder. Some sources indicate that the speculation that powerful people were involved in her death resulted in an abbreviated inquiry to her murder. Carmen Broto was nicknamed Cascabeles. Biography Carmen Broto was born on April 9, 1922, in Casa Pardina de Guaso, a village in Huesca. She later moved to Boltaña to live with her uncles. As a young woman, she moved to Barcelona and worked in domestic service. Quickly realizing that she could not escape hardships as a servant, she turned to prostitution. Frequenting salons and dances, she came into contact with many colorful characters. This includes Ramón Pané, who housed her in one of his flats and provided her with a monthly allowance for a year and a half. She also met black marketer and owner of the El Águila stores, Julio Muñoz Ramonet, known in the underworld as El Rey del Estraperlo. Juan Martínez Penas, a Galician businessman and owner of the Teatre Tívoli in Barcelona and a Ritz hotel resident, used his relationship with Broto to hide his homosexuality. Throughout her career, Broto formed connections with many men from Barcelona's high society, some of whom became her protectors. By the end of her life, she was well connected and had amassed a small fortune. She owned a beautiful collection of jewelry, which she often wore in public, both while entertaining men professionally and with her friends. Among the latter group was Jesús Navarro Manau, who ultimately became one of her assassins. Murder Jesús Navarro Manau, a seeker of the \\"good life\\" with ambiguous sexuality, and his father Jesús Navarro Gurrea, a professional criminal known for his safe-cracking abilities, devised a plan to steal Broto's jewels and break into Juan Martínez Penas' safe. They would get her drunk enough to cooperate, have her lead them to the safe, beat Broto to death, then bury her in an orchard by Guerra's house in Calle Legalidad. The two planned to frame the safe robbery on Broto, hoping the police would not discover her body and believe she disappeared after committing the crime. On the afternoon of January 10, 1949, Manau called Broto to say he was about to marry his girlfriend Pepita and move to Mallorca, but he wanted to spend one last night partying with her. Broto happily agreed, and the young man went to pick her up in a rented Ford Sedan, along with his friend and accomplice Jaime Viñas. They visited several bars on Calle Del Rosellón and Calle Casanova. When Broto appeared to be sufficiently drunk, they took her to the car and set off. Despite her intoxication, Broto did not agree to take them to Penas' safe. As the car passed in front of the Viñas Clinical Hospital, on Carrer Avinyó, Viñas panicked and hit Broto on the head with a heavy wooden mallet. As Broto fought her aggressor, Manau stopped the car, and Broto took the opportunity to escape. She had barely taken a few steps before falling unconscious, and her assailants dragged her back into the vehicle. They immediately drove to the garden in Calle Legalidad, the agreed place to meet Manau's father, checked that she was dead, took her jewelry, and buried her. The assailants left many clues for the police, including the car full of bloodstains abandoned only a few meters from the orchard. Once the investigators found her body, it was easy to connect the dots. Manau was quickly arrested and soon confessed to the crime. His father and Jaime Viñas both committed suicide by taking cyanide before they could be apprehended. Manau was initially sentenced to death; however, following pressure from influential people, the sentence was reduced to 30 years. After spending more than a decade in the Ocaña Prison, he was released on the grounds of good behavior, and in 1960 he received a pardon. Other versions The newspaper La Vanguardia published articles questioning the police's findings, leading to speculation of Broto's murderers' motives. Rumors circulated that merchants, industrialists, a high-ranking Francoist officer, and even an ecclesiastical dignitary were behind her killing. Others linked the murder to politics, homosexual jealousy, and drug trafficking. The police had investigated based on a robbery, on the orders of the Public Prosecutor. In an attempt to stop these rumors, Interior minister Blas Pérez issued a reporting ban to the press. Another rumor was spread by Jesús Navarro Manau himself, who went as far as to affirm that Broto was \\"eliminated\\" because she was a confidante of the police and an informant for the regime's enemies, responsible for the execution of several people. In popular culture The murder of Carmen Broto was the subject of multiple reports, novels, and films. The director and producer Pedro Costa dedicated a chapter of the prestigious television series La Huella del Crimen (The Trace of the Crime), starring Silvia Tortosa and Sergi Mateu, to the murder. The event was also fictionalized by Alberto Speratti in his work El crimen de la calle Legalidad (Barcelona, Martínez Roca, 1983). Juan Marsé was inspired by this crime for the plot of his novel Si te dicen que caí (If they tell you that I fell), adapted for the cinema by director Vicente Aranda.

Founded in 2016, it currently operates in the border regions of northern Chad, southern Libya, eastern Niger, and western Sudan. The CCMSR has become involved in the Second Libyan Civil War, and took control of the Kouri Bougoudi area in northern Chad in 2018.  History   Background, foundation, and initial activities  After taking power in 1990, Chadian President Idriss Déby has been challenged by numerous armed Chadian opposition groups. Although numerous and relatively powerful, the rebel facions were never able to fully unite to topple Déby who was thus able to crush them repeatedly in course of several civil wars and insurgencies. Over time, the military of Chad grew increasingly powerful, while the Chadian rebels lost their backers and sources of funding. As result, most of them relocated from Chad to Libya and Sudan in 2009, where they worked as mercanaries to remain active and make a living. About 11,000 Chadian mercenaries operated in Libya by August 2017, fighting for numerous Libyan parties such as the Presidential Council/Government of National Accord (GNA) and the Khalifa Haftar-loyal Libyan National Army (LNA). Several Chadian dissident groups unified under the leadership of long-time insurgent commander Mahamat Mahdi Ali in March 2016, forming the \\"Front for the Change and Unity in Chad\\" (FACT) and allying themselves with pro-GNA forces in Libya. FACT's unity collapsed almost immediately, however, as violent disputes erupted and part of the group split off in March. This splinter faction consisted of Kreda clansmen and adopted the name \\"Military Command Council for the Salvation of the Republic\\" (CCMSR), electing former UFDD spokesman Mahamat Hassani Bulmay its secretary-general. Becoming active in the border regions of northern Chad, southern Libya, eastern Niger, and western Sudan, CCMSR allied itself with the pro-GNA Benghazi Defense Brigades, and started to build up its strength in Libya for a rebellion against the Chadian government. It also started to clash with pro-Haftar forces, and one of its bases near Sabha was bombed by the Haftar-aligned Libyan Air Force in April 2016.  Return to Chad  The CCMSR was the first armed Chadian opposition group to return to its home country since 2010, namely when it launched a raid and killed 12 Chadian soldiers in April 2017. It subsequently won some attention in the region, and spread Bulmay's writings among the Chadian population. His messages included support for the interests of the Chadian region of Bahr el Gazel as well as strong criticism of local politicians who worked with Déby's government. Bulmay's ideas found some appeal among Bahr el Gazel's youth. A major clash between the CCMSR and the Chadian military took place on 18 August 2017, as a CSSMR column ran by chance into a Chadian Special Forces patrol near Tekro in Ennedi, routing the surprised government forces after a short battle. The rebel group suffered a heavy blow in October 2017, when the Nigerien government arrested three of its top leaders in Agadez, namely secretary- general Bulmay, spokesman Ahmat Yacoub Adam, and external affairs secretary Dr. Abderahman Issa Youssouf. The group attempted to force the Nigerien government to release them by threatening to launch a retaliatory attack, but Niger nevertheless extradited them to Chad. Despite its previous threat, CCMSR refrained from attacking Niger in retaliation. Bulmay, Adam, and Youssouf were subsequently put on trial in Chad, charged with the capital offense of terrorism, and transferred to the desert prison of Koro Toro. CCMSR appointed Mahamat Tahir Acheick as replacement secretary-general who in turn was succeeded by Michelot Yogogombaye in 2018. Yogogombaye, a loyalist of former Chadian President Hissène Habré, operates from Paris. In March and May 2018, the CCMSR was repeatedly bombed by the Haftar-loyal Libyan Air Force, though these attacks had almost no effect. In contrast, one Libyan air raid in June against one of the militia's bases at Um Aranib reportedly resulted in significant losses. At some point, the CCMSR joined a Chadian rebel coalition, the \\"National Front for Democracy and Justice in Chad\\" which was founded in July 2018.  Control of Kouri Bougoudi  On 11 August 2018, CCMSR launched a major attack on the military outpost at Kouri Bougoudi in the Tibesti Mountains, later claiming to have killed 73 and captured 45 soldiers while suffering just 11 casualties (4 dead, 7 wounded). The Chadian government initially attempted to deny that the attack had taken place, and then played downplayed its significance. While the CCMSR offered to release its prisoners in return for the release of Bulmay, Adam, and Youssouf, the Chadian government refused negotiate with \\"savage mercenaries, bandits [and] thugs\\", and instead ordered local miners to abandon their camp at Kouri Bougoudi. The military subsequently retreated from the area on 22 August, leaving it to the CCMSR and illegal miners. From then on, the Chadian Air Force launched several bombing raids in the region, targeting the Kouri Bougoudi mining camp and camel herds, killing several civilians and depriving locals of their livelihood. Meanwhile, the CCMSR continued its attacks against government positions, such as at Tarbou in Tibesti Region (21 September), and Miski in Borkou Region (24 October). Some locals criticised the CCMSR of exploiting and worsening ethnic tensions in the Tibesti Mountains. At the same time, tensions increased in southern Libya, as native civilians and armed forces were increasingly opposed to the presence of Chadian militants, resulting in numerous clashes. In late October 2018, Haftar's LNA launched an offensive in the Murzuq basin to evict rival Libyan and Chadian groups, including the CCMSR, from the region. It has been speculated that the Chadian militants who attacked the LNA base at Traghan on 27 December 2018, were connected to the CCMSR. On 12 January 2019, the CCMSR clashed with the LNA-allied Sudanese SLM/A-Minnawi at Gatroun in southern Libya, and with the pro-Déby Sudanese Justice and Equality Movement at the gold mines of Kouri Bougoudi in northern Chad. By February 2019, the CCMSR came under increasing pressure by the LNA and its allies, as the latter had launched another offensive to evict the GNA and Chadian rebels from southern Libya.  Continued cross-border raids  By August 2019, the CCMSR had lost control of Kouri Bougoudi, but continued to launch cross-border raids into the Tibesti Mountains. The Chadian military responded with a \\"crackdown\\" in the area and declared a regional state of emergency for five months. On 19 February 2020, CCMSR troops launched another raid against Kouri Bougoudi, resulting in a larger battle with security forces. Both sides claimed to have inflicted heavy losses on their opponents before the rebels retreated back into Libya.  Ideology  CCMSR portrays itself as Chadian nationalist movement that is opposed to the authoritian regime of Idriss Déby which it regards as uncaring and oppressive toward the Chadian people. In one statement, Mahamat Hassani Bulmay described Déby's government as \\"clan despotism in its most pernicious and most abject form\\", and stated that the only way to end his rule is through war. According to Bulmay, the Chadian President had a \\"double choice, the grave or the prison\\". Furthermore, the CCMSR has voiced its support for the interests of marginalized peoples and areas in northern and central Chad. Islam also plays a part in the ideology of the CCMSR, and is used by the group to rally local support, form alliances in southern Libya, and sway public opinion against Déby and his inner circle, whom the CCMSR has accused of being \\"bad Muslims\\". Despite this, the CCMSR is not a overtly religious organization. Most notably, its former head Bulmay was known for being not devout.  Strength  The CCMSR claims to have 4,500 fighters under its command, most of them members of the Toubou people's Daza subgroup, as well as smaller numbers of Arabs, Maba, and Zaghawa. It is the largest group in the \\"National Front for Democracy and Justice in Chad\\" rebel coalition. There have been allegations that the CCMSR is financed by Qatar, as it is allied to Libyan militias which are supported by Qatar.

It is linked to the fame of Lodrisio Visconti, who raised against and then reconciled with the members of the family of his cousin Matteo Visconti, Lord of Milan. In the 14th century, the castle underwent expansion and destruction according to the alternative fortunes of Lodrisio. Since the 19th century, a group of private estates, also in the form of revival castle, have been constructed near the original building, characterizing today the area. Location The Visconti Castle is located on the top of a hill over the valley of the Arno torrent. The position favors the control of the territory to the east toward Milan. The location is therefore believed to be at the origin of the initial settlements and fortifications. History The castle is mentioned for the first time in the 12th-century sources. At the end of the 13th century, it was received by Pietro Visconti with other nearby castles (Besnate, Orago and Jerago) as part of a division between him and Matteo and Uberto, sons of Teobaldo Visconti. In the neighboring Gallarate, Teobaldo, after being captured by members of the opposite faction supporting the Della Torre family, was executed in 1276. The castle was inherited by Lodrisio, son of Pietro, who greatly expanded it. In the meantime, his cousin Matteo became Lord of Milan. After the death of Matteo in 1322, a conflict between his sons and Lodrisio arose. Lodrisio was dislodged from Crenna and the castle destroyed. After having put together the Compagnia di San Giorgio, a militia of mercenaries, in 1339 he was finally defeated in the Battle of Parabiago by an army led by Azzone, grandson of Matteo. Lodrisio later reconciled with their cousins and the castle was subsequently restored. The castle was later transferred to the Visconti di Crenna, the Visconti cadet branch originated by Lodrisio and named after Crenna. Over several generations, divisions among brothers led to the fragmentation of the area surrounding the castle. In the 16th and 17th centuries, the building underwent changes and adaptations after further family divisions. New buildings, in the form of revival castle, were later added. The Visconti di Crenna became extinct in 1722, and the buildings were transferred consequently to other families. Today Transformed during the late 19th and the first decades of the 20th century, the area of the ancient castle is today partly surrounded by recent buildings. A tower and other constructions in the form of revival caste are visible from the center of Crenna. The eastern façade of the castle, looking toward Gallarate, can be seen from a distance at the top of the Crenna hill.

I was a singer. I'm not playing against the singers, but with them. I always make sure they can breathe properly. I think vocally.\\" In 2016, Steier directed the Swiss premiere of Karlheinz Stockhausen's Donnerstag aus Licht at the Theater Basel, conducted by Titus Engel. The production, the first after 30 years, earned the award \\"Best Production of the Year\\" (\\"Aufführung des Jahres\\") by Opernwelt. In 2017, Steier staged Puccini's Turandot at the Cologne Opera, conducted by Claude Schnitzler. Jean-Luc Clairet called her staging of Stravinsky's The Rake's Progress in Basel in 2018, \\"a jewel\\", and described her as playing with light in this musical comedy inspired by paintings by William Hogarth. For the 2018 Salzburg Festival, she created the opening production of Mozart's Die Zauberflöte, conducted by Constantinos Carydis. She is the first woman to direct the work at the festival. She staged it as a play in a play, with Klaus Maria Brandauer as a narrator as the grandfather of the Three Boys. In Le Monde, Marie-Aude Roux commented: \\"It takes a real temper to dare to tackle this emblematic opera, which flourishes in traditional staging. But the American ... is obviously unafraid and takes up the challenge with a real scenic idea, whose abundant realization would nevertheless benefit from being reworked ...\\" In the 2018/19 season, she staged a double bill of Stravinsky's Oedipus rex and Tchaikovsky's last opera Iolanta, conducted by Sebastian Weigle.

She was born in the south of Florida, and lived in the village of Royal Palm Beach at 10000 Carmen Lane until 19 years of age.Woman Confesses To Killing 2 Infants Her father left her when she was seven years old. As a child, Boykin lived from time to time with her mother, grandmother, aunt and other close relatives, and complained of beatings and abuse by her lover for 15 years.Baby Slayings Shock Families Her first killing took place on November 16, 1993, when she was 18 and worked as a nanny for some family friends, killing 9-month-old Kayla Basante. For this murder, when it was later discovered, she received life imprisonment. The second murder took place on October 27, 1994, when she murdered her 5-month-old son, Daytona Boykin, for which she later received 40 years' imprisonment. She was arrested and charged a few days after Daytona's death, and then quickly confessed to murdering Basante, which until then was considered just an unlucky death. According to her lawyer, Alysoun B. Powell of West Palm Beach, the whole case was the result of her unhappy life, childhood confinement and parental disregard for the child's emotional needs. Powell further explained that her unfortunate childhood \\"sounds like a banal excuse, but that explains why some of these crimes happen, because parents do not recognize or ignore the emotional needs of their children, and when these needs are not met, this is another example of what can happen.\\" Clover Boykin was in an unhappy marriage with Steven Boykin, with whom she married in January while she was pregnant in the 5th month, and that he threatened to take away custody of her son. Clover had an extramarital affair in that short marriage with the silent approval of her husband. The Boykins lived at Counterpoint Estates at Royal Palm Beach in a four-bedroom house shared with Steven's mother and her sister. At the time of the murder, Steven was at work, and her mother-in-law and sister were sleeping.

The main house was designed by Philip Tilden for the former British Prime Minister David Lloyd George in 1922. The house and farm were situated on 60 acres of land bought by Lloyd George from Roland Cubitt, 3rd Baron Ashcombe as part of the sale of Ashcombe's 2,000 acre Churt estate in 1921. Lloyd George added to the estate until it reached some 700 acres. Though the local scrub land was unsuitable for farming, Lloyd George established a successful fruit and pig farm at Bron-y-de and sold excess produce at his own farm shop. A water diviner travelled from Wales to the farm and found a source of irrigation underground. Lloyd George's private secretary A. J. Sylvester was dismissive of Lloyd George's managerial and financial abilities regarding his ownership of Bron-y-de, writing in 1940 that 'Churt becomes a bigger mystery to me every day. Nobody knows what are the true facts about the financial aspect. The agricultural aspect is totally mucked up and discontent is rife amongst all the staff. It is an unhappy place and is a cemetery to many an innocent and enthusiastic person'. With the assumption of Lloyd George's occupation of Bron-y-de, Tilden wrote that the 'centre of the political universe was moved from London'. Lloyd George's mistress, Frances Stevenson lived nearby in 'Avalon', overlooking the orchards of Bron-y-de, having previously occupied the 'Old Barn', a former farm building. A timber bungalow, 'Avalon' was designed for Stevenson by the modernist architect Anthony Chitty. Bron-y-de was the subject of the main article of the 4 November 1922 issue of Country Life. The architect and engineer Owen Williams installed a large panoramic window at Bron-y-de at Lloyd George's behest following the latter's visit to Adolf Hitler's Berghof residence at Obersalzberg in the Bavarian Alps which featured a similar window. The library at Bron-y-de was the largest room in the house at 36 ft in length with a curved ceiling. A mural painted by John Churchill of the Gulf of Tigullio dominated one end of the library. Several amateur films of Lloyd- George at Bron-y-de are in the collection of the National Screen and Sound Archive of Wales. A 1938 film shows a new apiary and 'larch gathering' at Bron-y-de. Honey from the apiary at Bron-y-de was later sold at Harrods. Another film shot in 1938 demonstrates the use of a rotatiller and caterpillar tractor on the farmland at Bron-y-de. A 1936 film filmed by Lloyd George's private secretary, A. J. Sylvester, shows Lloyd George in his orchard at Bron- y-de. A 1929 film shows Lloyd George at Bron-y-de reading accompanied by his chow chow dog, 'Y Chow Du' (The Black Chow). In his memoirs, published in 1954, Tilden expressed the view that Bron-y-de would \\"become as world-known as many a city, and will no doubt some future day fall into the category of Hatfield, Hughenden or Hawarden\\". His hopes were not fulfilled; Bron-y-de was destroyed by fire in the 1960s.

The Samedan–Pontresina railway is often also considered part of the line. Both lines are closely linked with each other. The Bever–Scuol-Tarasp railway is part of the RhB mainline network, so the kilometrage (chainage) has its zero point in Landquart.  History After the construction of the Albula Railway the canton of Grisons and the federal military authorities, among others, were very interested in a railway line through the Engadine. Originally this line was intended only as a branch line, but due to its high popularity it was given a higher priority. The line was finally commissioned by the Rhaetian Railway on 27 July 1903. Prof. Friedrich Hennings, who had already designed the Albula Railway, had been working on a project for a technically and financially feasible line through the Engadine. After the preparation of designs for this project, the Loste office in Paris, together with senior engineer Peter Saluz, took over the detailed planning, which was based on the plans of Prof. Hennings. In 1907, a project was finally presented, which provided for a 49.5 kilometre line with a total of 17 tunnels and 55 major bridges. The engineering structures on the line now required specialists with experience. So Hans Studer, who was already worked on the Wiesen Viaduct, was commissioned as site supervisor for the Zernez–Scuol section. An experienced construction technician Jakob G. Zollinger took over responsibility on the Zernez–Scuol section.  Construction  Construction began on the whole line in the spring of 1909. Originally it was to be finished in the summer of 1912, but the engineers and workers encountered unexpected tunneling problems between Guarda and Scuol. While Bever and Guarda were already busy with the construction of track and superstructure in the spring of 1912, the miners between Guarda and Scuol had to deal with unusual rock pressures, loose rock layers and the ingress of water during the tunnel construction. Finally, the breakthrough of the longest tunnels at Magnacun (1909 m) and Tasna (2350 m) took place in June/July 1912. After that, the construction workers succeeded in completing the walling and the full breakthrough was completed in April 1913. The line was officially opened on 28/29 June 1913.  Construction accident 1911  On 29 August 1911, a 30-metre-high wood frame collapsed on itself at the Val Mela viaduct between Cinuos-chel and Brail causing the death of twelve Italian construction workers. In memory of this misfortune, the cause of which was never established, there is a plaque on the portal of the entrance of the Brail 1 Tunnel, which was last restored in 2003.  Electrification  As a result of the BLS's electrical test operation on the Spiez–Frutigen line, the Rhaetian Railway became interested in the new traction technology using single-phase alternating current. The Rhaetian Railway thus decided to use the Bever–Scuol line, which was still under construction, as a test track for single-phase alternating current. The Rhaetian Railway commissioned its energy supply from the Brusio power station. The Brusio power station had to ensure the supply of electricity from the Val Poschiavo via the Bernina Pass to a substation in Bever, which was specially erected for the transformation of the power to the required voltage of 11 kV/16 2/3 Hz. Thus, the Rhaetian Railway was able to operate the Lower Engadine line electrically from its opening.  Accidents Salvage after the accident at Zernez on 19 March 1937. A train crashed onto a fallen boulder on the approach to the Magnacun Tunnel between Guarda and Ardez on 22 March 1927. The Ge 2/4 206 was forced against the edge of the wall of the tunnel portal. The locomotive driver died, two passengers were severely injured and seven were slightly injured. On 19 March 1937, the last evening train between Zernez and Susch ran into a snow drift. Locomotive Ge 4/6 391 derailed and crashed across the road into the Inn, but the carriages stopped on the track. The engine driver died and a travelling Bahnmeister (an official in charge local of track maintenance) was badly injured, but the passengers escaped injury. The locomotive could not be recovered for more than two months. A strange accident occurred on 30 April 2012, when late in the evening a train on the Scuol-Tarasp–Klosters route collided with a brown bear called M13 at Ftan Baraigla station. No major injuries on the animal could be detected.  Route  Bever station in February 2014 The so-called Lower Engadine line starts at the Bever junction station, where it branches off from the Albula Railway from Samedan and St. Moritz to the north and Filisur, Thusis and to the south. The line now runs on the still wide left side of the valley of the Upper Engadine at a 2.0% gradient through the stations of La Punt Chamues-ch, Madulain, Zuoz und S-chanf to Cinuos-chel-Brail. The halt of S-chanf Marathon lies at km 107.4 between S-chanf and Cinuos-chel-Brail; this is served only by selected trains for sporting events in the winter and summer. After Cinuos- chel-Brail station, the line passes over the Inn on the famous 113 m-long Inn viaduct to the right (southern) side of the valley and then runs over several structures and tunnels and through the Carolina crossing loop to Zernez. The line descends from the Upper to the Lower Engadine on a large loop on the approach to Zernez. After Zernez, the line changes to the left (northern) side of the valley on a large steel bridge and then runs on constant gradient of 2.0% through several small tunnels to Susch. Shortly after Susch station, a connecting tunnel (Sasslatsch II, 277 m-long) branches off the line into the Vereina Tunnel. The Lower Engadine line continues along the left side of the valley and arrives at Sagliains and the north portal of the Vereina Tunnel. The station is both a car loading station for the car shuttle train through the Vereina tunnel and an interchange station for passenger trains. An exit has not been built for passengers to reach the public street. After Sagliains, the line continues through the stations of Lavin, Guarda, Ardez and Ftan, as well as through several smaller tunnels, the long Tasna and Magnacun tunnels and several viaducts to Scuol-Tarasp.  Railway stations  Bever  Bever station is at the starting point of the Engadine line at its junction with the Albula Railway (Chur–St. Moritz). It is located to the southwest of the village of Bever at 1708 m above sea level. The station is served only by the passenger trains that operate on the Engadine line. The hourly Chur–St. Moritz Regional Express does not normally stop in Bever. Some early morning and late evening regional services on the Chur–St. Moritz route do stop.  Zernez  Zernez station Zernez is an important station located on the northwestern edge of the village of Zernez at 1471 m. All trains that serve part or all of the Engadine line stop in Zernez and it is also connected by Postbus services over the Fuorn Pass and through the Val Müstair to Müstair, Santa Maria and Mals in Italy, where it connects in turn to the Merano–Mals railway to Merano and Bolzano. In summer, additional post buses run to Davos Platz. Freight transport also plays a major role in Zernez. Freight trains containing swap bodies regularly run to Zernez, from where they are transported by truck to the Val Müstair. In addition, much freight is shipped from the middle Engadine via Zernez. Zernez station was completely rebuilt in 2010 and 2011. Among other things, the railway facilities were renewed, the platforms were raised and thus adapted for the disabled, a new covered island platform was built, the station building was rebuilt, the platform was roofed over and extended and a crossing loop was built on the Susch side. The island platform is connected by an underpass to the station building on platform 1. In addition, a new PostBus ramp was built, which allowed better transfer options between trains and postbuses. Similarly, a new 40-tonne swap-body crane was built and a new general freight loading centre was built to improve freight handling.  Sagliains  Sagliains station is located at km 128.7 at 1432 m at the exit from the Sagliains valley between the villages and stations of Susch and Lavin in the Lower Engadine. It was built on material removed during the construction of the Vereina Tunnel. Sagliains station was opened with the Vereina tunnel in November 1999. Its main business is the operation of the Vereina car shuttle train. The car loading station is equipped with two loading tracks next to a loading ramp, which stretches along the valley slope. It has a direct connection to the main road through a car tunnel and a covered gallery, which serves, among other things, the waiting road vehicles and has offices for cashiers. There is also a service building with a self-service kiosk. In addition to the transport of cars, Sagliains station also serves as an interchange station between the Scuol- Tarasp–Pontresina regional services and the Scuol- Tarasp–Landquart–Chur–Disentis regional express services. As an interchange station, it only has an island platform without access from the outside. Thus, it is not normally possible to use this station for embarking and disembarking, except for changing trains.  Scuol-Tarasp  Train departing from Scuol-Tarasp station Scuol-Tarasp station is located on the western edge of the village of Scuol at an altitude of 1287 m in the Lower Engadine. The station is named after the neighbouring village of Scuol and the small town of Tarasp. The station was completely rebuilt and renovated in 2009. Since then, a Postbus stop has been located on the right side of the station building; this is the starting point for Postbus routes in the Lower Engadine. In addition, an island platform was built with platform track 1 as a dead-end track and track 2 as a through track. This allows direct access to the trains and platform at ground level. Likewise, the freight handling facilities were renewed and rebuilt. Scuol-Tarasp is the terminus or starting point for the Scuol-Tarasp–Zernez–Samedan–Pontresina regional service and for the Scuol- Tarasp–Landquart–Chur–Disentis Regional-Express service. Regular bus routes to Ftan, Tarasp, Samnaun, Martina, Sent, S-charl and Val Sinestra start at the station. In addition, the local school bus stops at the station. The cable car to Motta Naluns begins next to the station. Every week, up to five freight trains run daily from Landquart to Scuol-Tarasp. Oil, mail, cement and garbage are the main freight handled at the station.  Operations  Passengers Locomotive Ge 4/4 II marking the 100th anniversary Push-pull train BDt 1723 and Ge 4/4 I in La Punt Chamues-ch The line is served by hourly Pontresina–Samedan–Bever–Zernez–Scuol-Tarasp regional trains. These trains almost always consist of a Ge 4/4 II, an EW I 1st class and two EW I 2nd class cars, a push-pull WS cycle wagon (summer only) and a Neva Retica BDt control car. The Sagliains–Scuol-Tarasp section is also served by hourly Disentis–Landquart–Scuol-Tarasp regional trains. They usually consist of a Ge 4/4 II, an EW II or an EW IV 1st class and several 2nd-class passenger cars. The section between the Vereina tunnel and Bever is also served by Regional- Express services at two-hour intervals in the middle of the day, which mainly serve the important tourist connection from the Grisons lowland into the Engadine.  Freight Freight transport also plays an important role over the whole Engadine line. Several freight trains run regularly to Scuol-Tarasp on weekdays and a freight train runs from Landquart to Samedan via Zernez almost every two hours. In addition, there are regular freight train movements to Zernez. Since 1999, the Vereina route via Zernez, Vereina and Klosters to Landquart has been faster than the route via the Albula line to Landquart, so many freight trains now run through the Vereina tunnel into the Engadine. Projected connection to South Tyrol/Italy  The old idea of a Fuorn Pass railway that would connect the Engadine with the Vinschgau in the South Tyrol, experienced a new upswing after the reopening of the Merano–Mals railway (Vinschgaubahn) in 2005. As part of an EU-funded interregional project, various possible routes were developed and examined in more detail. The results of the studies were presented at a 2013 meeting; the funding requirement was estimated at around €1 billion, depending on the route chosen.

Byrd Sr. signed into law \\"the first effective anti-lynching law\\", the Virginia Anti-Lynching Law of 1928 (the Barron-Connor Act). Byrd was \\"the principal power behind the lynching act\\"; he believed that lynchings hurt the state economically by discouraging investment, and was trying to show that since states could handle the issue, federal legislation was unnecessary. (See Dyer Anti-Lynching Bill.) Byrd saw this law as a key achievement of his administration and claimed with pride that there had never been another lynching in Virginia. He had just been a candidate for the 1932 U.S. Presidential nomination, was close to Roosevelt, was frequently mentioned as a possible cabinet appointee, and would soon be appointed, then elected Senator from Virginia. \\"Byrd's ascension to the national political stage was based in part on his reputation as the architect of the nation's strictest anti- lynching law.\\" Thus, local officials \\"resented\\" the NAACP's inclusion of Thompson in a list of 1932 lynchings, and \\"vigorously den[ied]\\" that he had been lynched. According to the sheriff there had been no lynching in Fauquier County within his memory, and it was an absolute case of suicide. Byrd became personally involved, writing and having his friends write the NAACP, insisting that there had not been a lynching. The coroner \\"issued immediately a verdict of suicide,\\" and said Thompson had committed suicide by putting a rope around his neck and jumping from an apple tree: > Why, it would be the simplest thing in the world. The tree had one limb > running straight out about the size of my leg in diameter and another limb a > bit higher running in almost the same direction. Thompson climbed the tree > and sat out on the limb while he tied the slip noose around his neck, > leaving about eighteen inches slack to break his neck in the fall. After > fixing the knots the negro allowed himself to slip off the limb. That's all > there was to it. (The Commonwealth Attorney said Thompson jumped off a pile of rocks he had made, so as to break his own neck.) As soon as the coroner's verdict was published, \\"rumors began to circulate stating that the negro had been lynched by the angry mob that had been scouring through Rattlesnake Mountain the week following the negro's alleged attack and alleged escape, armed with knives, picks, shotguns, ropes, and mowing blades. One rumor even stated the date the lynching occurred and gave the number in the lynching party as six men…\\" The coroner said he paid no attention to these rumors, which were \\"bare lies\\". A news story from nearby Martinsburg, West Virginia, where Thompson \\"at one time\\" resided, said that there was a bullet hole in his skull, and the body had been mutilated. Early reports said the body was burned before any law enforcement official arrived, and as said above, the first sheriff's deputy to arrive was threatened with a gun so he could not put the flames out. Yet the coroner said that a sheriff's deputy inspected the body before it was burned, and the stomach and abdomen were in \\"perfect condition so far as any signs of mutilation or beating was concerned\\". Furthermore, he said he had the skull in his possession…and after several examinations could find no sign of a bullet hole or any indication of rough treatment.\\" \\"The authorities' presumption that the man took his own life is not generally believed.\\" Stories that Thompson had been hung by a posse \\"gained so much credence\\" that a grand jury was impaneled; it also held that Thompson had committed suicide. \\"This verdict, however, failed to quiet and 'hush up' the case; …several [local citizens] admitted after finding the body, that they had taken part in Thompson's lynching two months before.\\" As it was put by the Chicago Defender, an African-American newspaper, \\"'Suicide' Is Now Synonymous to 'Lynching' in Virginia\\". The Last Lynching in Northern Virginia Retired Virginia reporter Jim Hall started investigating the Thompson case \\"because the official version of what happened…did not make sense\\" \\"He checked military records of Thompson and Baxley, who both served in the First World War, property deeds and land records, newspaper accounts, and personal diaries.\\" He interviewed family and neighbors of both the Baxleys and Thompson. He \\"was shocked, as he read through Byrd’s papers at the University of Virginia…[and] came to believe Byrd was motivated to 'protect his reputation … not to get to the bottom' of what happened to Thompson.\\" \\"The grand jury and the coroner…saw their job as protection of the status quo…and they did their duty to protect and shield the status quo from all the implications of a lynching verdict'\\". \\"Suicide didn't make any sense to anyone.\\" Hall's research led to a 2016 book, The Last Lynching in Northern Virginia: Seeking Truth at Rattlesnake Mountain (2016). As a result of Hall's work, the Equal Justice Initiative added Thompson's name to its database of American lynchings. His name is one of the two names inscribed on Fauquier County's coffin-shaped pillar at the National Lynching Memorial (The National Memorial for Peace and Justice). He calls the lynching of Shedrick Thompson \\"an open wound\\" in Fauquier County. The Other Side of Eden: Stories of a Virginia Lynching Accompanying Hall during his on-site research and interviews was Tom Davenport, an independent filmmaker from Fauquier County. \\"Hall asked the questions, and Davenport filmed the interview over Hall's shoulder.\\" The result was a 59-minute documentary, The Other Side of Eden: Stories of a Virginia Lynching (2018).

Robert Traill (1603-1678). A painting of him was, in 1857, placed in one of the windows of Greyfriars' church, Edinburgh. Robert Traill of Greyfriars was born at Denino, in 1603. He was son of Colonel James Traill, of Killcleary, Ireland, Gentleman of the Privy Chamber to Henry, Prince of Wales, and grandson of the Laird of Blebo, and Matilda Melvill of Carnbee. He graduated with an M.A. from St Andrews on 21 July 1621. he went over to Paris, and subsequently joined his brother in Orleans. He later studied at the Protestant College of Saumur. He was an English tutor in France to the sister of the Duke of Rohan in 1628. He was afterwards teacher in a school established by a Protestant minister at Montague, in Bus Poitou. He became chaplain to Archibald, Marquess of Argyll (beheaded 1661). In 1630 he returned to Scotland. He was ordained to Elie 17 July 1639. In 1640, he was ordered to attend Lord Lindsay's regiment at Newcastle for three months. He was chaplain to the Scots army at Marston Moor in 1644. He was elected by the Town Council 7 November 1648. He became minister at Old Greyfriars on 23 March 1649. In 1650 he attended the Marquess of Montrose on the scaffold. He was a protestor rather than a resolutioner. He preached before Charles II. at his coronation at Scone in 1651. In 1654 he was appointed by Cromwell one of those for certifying the ability and piety of such as were fit to be admitted to the ministry in the Lothian and Border provinces. With several others he was committed to Edinburgh Castle on 23 August 1660, for engaging in a new Remonstrance, where he lay for ten months, when, having fallen sick, he was temporarily permitted to return home. He was next charged with high treason before the Privy Council, when he obliged himself, 11 December 1662, to remove from the kingdom within a month, under pain of death. John Livingstone was tried the same day. Move to Holland Owing to tempestuous weather he experienced difficulty in finding a ship in which to sail to Holland, and the Privy Council granted him a month's further grace in which to take his departure. In a petition he states that he \\"is towards the age of sixty years, if not more, and so cannot weill take such a journey in such a season without evident hazard of his life\\" (Reg. P. C). He did make it to Holland along with other ministers and was later joined by his son Robert. For some years he carried on a weekly correspondence with his friend Guthrie of Fenwick. Returning to Edinburgh, he died 12 July 1678, and was buried in Greyfriars. A portrait of him is preserved in Smith's Iconographia Scot and Pinkerton's Scottish Gallery. Family life He married 23 December 1639, Jean (died Dec. 1680), daughter of Alexander Annand of Auchterallan, Aberdeenshire, and then Margaret Cheyne (who suffered imprisonment, June 1665, for corresponding with her husband in his exile), and had 3 sons and 3 daughters: *William, minister of Borthwick *his second son also called Robert Traill, minister in London, and Bass Rock prisoner *James, Lieutenant of Stirling Castle, baptised 10 March 1650, died 1721 *Helen (married Thomas Paterson, minister of Borthwick) *Agnes, born 1646, died 1690 (married Sir James Steuart of Goodtrees, Lord Advocate) *Margaret, born 1648, died 1717 (married James Scott of Bristo, writer in Edinburgh) Bibliography *A Letter from a Father to his Children *Elie Session *Edin.

Development and design In 1937, the Imperial Japanese Navy drew up a specification for a 12-shi primary floatplane trainer to replace its Yokosuka K4Y or Navy Type 90 Primary Seaplane Trainer. The specification was issued to the established builders of aircraft for the Navy, Kawanishi and Watanabe and to the relative newcomer Nihon Hikoki (also known as \\"Nippi\\"). The specification required use of the same Gasuden Jimpu radial engine used by the K4Y, and the three designs showed little changes from the aircraft they were to replace. Watanabe's design, which was given the short designation K8W1, was, like the other two designs, a single-engine biplane with a fabric-covered steel-tube fuselage and a wooden wing, with two floats. The trainee and instructor sat in individual open cockpits. The first of three prototypes made its maiden flight in 1938. The Watanabe design was judged inferior to that of the Kawanishi design, and thus did not enter production.

Earlier in his career he established a newspaper The Edmonson County Star, in his home town of Brownsville, Kentucky, before moving to Indianapolis where he had a printing company. His younger brother Sea Ferguson helped in the print shop and with his other business ventures. After leaving the publishing business, Denver Ferguson became successful in illegal gambling and invested in property as well as a talent management and promotion business. Musician and record producer Sax Kari described him as \\"the man who invented the chitlin’ circuit\\". Early life and family Denver Ferguson was born in Brownsville, Kentucky, in 1895, the eldest son of Mattie (née Whitney) and Samuel Henry Ferguson. His younger brother Sea Harious Ferguson (December 22, 1899 - March 10, 1974), who became a property developer and working partner of his elder brother, was also born in Brownsville. Career When in his teens, Denver acquired a printing press, and in about 1914 founded the Edmonson County Star newspaper in Brownsville. He was drafted in 1917, and after his discharge in 1919 moved north to Indianapolis. The following year he established the Ferguson Printing Company, and soon set up his premises on Indiana Avenue. Many of his clients organised a street lottery, the \\"numbers game\\" or \\"policy game\\", and Ferguson designed and printed tickets resembling a baseball scorecard. When his success in running the illegal racket started to draw unwelcome official attention to himself, he recruited his brother Sea to be the public face of the operation. Sea Ferguson opened a real estate brokerage in the city, and the two brothers became renowned locally for their generosity in extending loans and giving to charitable causes in the local black community. \\"Ferguson, Denver and Sea (brothers) \\", University of Kentucky Libraries Notable Kentucky African Americans Database. Retrieved 4 November 2015 In 1931, Sea Ferguson opened the Cotton Club nightclub in Indianapolis, and the following year Denver Ferguson opened the Trianon Ballroom, featuring Walter Barnes as his first star attraction. Barnes was experienced in touring with his band around the South, and wrote a regular column in The Chicago Defender until his death in the Rhythm Club fire in Natchez, Mississippi in 1940. The Theatre Owners Booking Association (TOBA) had collapsed in late 1930, and the Ferguson brothers drew on Barnes and his contacts to bring top black entertainers to Indianapolis. Lauterbach, pp.31-42 In 1938, Denver Ferguson opened the Sunset Terrace ballroom in Indianapolis, featuring Tiny Bradshaw, Earl Hines, Duke Ellington and Ella Fitzgerald in its early months. Lauterbach, pp.59-60 Largely as a result of the Ferguson brothers' initiatives, commercial activity thrived on Indiana Avenue in the late 1930s. In 1939 a full page announcement in the Indianapolis Recorder with well wishes from businesses announced his opening of the New Sunset Terrace venue in Indianapolis. However, in 1940 a clampdown by the authorities under Mayor Reginald H. Sullivan led to their businesses' licenses being revoked. By the late 1930s, both Denver and Sea Ferguson were seen as among the wealthiest residents of Indianapolis. In 1941, they opened Ferguson Brothers, a booking agency, which grew rapidly and became the most powerful black-owned talent agency in the country. They helped various orchestras, bands, and vaudeville shows book gigs, including Jay McShann, King Kolax, Tiny Bradshaw, Roosevelt Sykes, Claude Trenier, the Bama State Collegians, Carolina Cotton Pickers, Snookum Russell, Milton Larkin, Clarence Love, Gene Pope, and the International Sweethearts of Rhythm, and organised tours around the South playing to black audiences. John Morthland, \\"The Chitlin’ Circuit: Celebrating a Secret History of American Music\\", WonderingSound.com, 1 November 2011. Retrieved 25 November 2019 In 1944, Denver Ferguson reopened Le Jazz Hott Spot in Chicago as part of his syndicate. He was a mentor to Sax Kari, who worked for him and who assisted writer Preston Lauterbach in preparing his 2011 book The Chitlin' Circuit and the Road to Rock 'n' Roll, documenting the Ferguson brothers' work and influence. Personal life Denver Ferguson married a German woman, Lilo Rantlach, with whom he had been in correspondence. After a brief marriage, they divorced. In 1954, Ferguson faced a lawsuit after an automobile accident. Death Ferguson died in 1957 in Indianapolis and is buried at Page-Ferguson Cemetery in Brownsville, Kentucky.

It was established in 1840 and known as The Olde Towne of Flushing Burial Ground. It was the result of Cholera and Smallpox epidemics in 1840 and 1844, added by town elders north of Flushing Cemetery due to fears of contamination of church burial grounds. Once known as \\"Pauper Burial Ground\\", \\"Colored Cemetery of Flushing\\" and \\"Martins Field\\", it was purchased by the New York City Department of Parks and Recreation on December 2, 1914 and renamed in 2009 to \\"The Olde Towne of Flushing Burial Ground\\".https://www.governor.ny.gov/news/governor-cuomo- announces-23-properties-recommended-state-and-national-registers-historic- places It is co-located with a children's playground called \\"Martin’s Field\\". It was placed on the National Register of Historic Places in 2018.  History  George Washington, like other noted landowners, journeyed to Flushing: The community was a center of scientific horticulture. The cemetery's floral and arboreal beauty have become a memorial to Flushing's status as a center of horticulture to this day.Stuart, Schuyler Brandon. \\"The Story of FLUSHING CEMETERY\\". Published for the Tri-Centennial of Flushing 1645–1945. page 3 The town of Flushing suffered a Cholera epidemic circa 1840 and a Smallpox epidemic in 1844. Fears that the infected corpses would contaminate the church burial grounds the town elders purchased the land from the Bowne family and created a separate burial ground to be used for the infected to be buried in. By 1854 medical science had progressed and improved hygiene helped ward off such diseases, fewer epidemics resulted in a lessened need for the separate unconsecrated graveyard and it fell into disuse. In the latter decades of that century it was set aside for use by the African American community. This was a result of editorials published in the Flushing Journal in the 1850s regarding the AME church running out of burial space. From about 1880 to its closing in 1898 it became primarily a burial ground for African-Americans and Native Americans. By 1914 the land was used as the ‘town commons’ or ‘village green’, and by 1930 was paved over and made into a park called ‘Martin's Field. In 1936 Robert Moses, NYC Commissioner of Parks spearheaded the initiative to re- purpose the green into a recreational space for children. As one of the many projects during the WPA period a modern children's playground was built on the site. It was during excavation that workers came across evidence of the previous usage as a burial ground. Found at the dig were remains which still had pennies over the eyes, an archaic practice that was also observed in excavation of the African Burial Ground in lower Manhattan. By 1938, the new playground, with a wading pool, baseball field and swing sets opened to the public. The WPA's historical division conducted interviews with local citizens about the sites history as a burial ground for a permanent record. The only grave markers that remained was for the Bunn family – who were members of the AME church.  Archeological dig  In 1990, local activist Mandingo Tshaka helped publicize the history of the green, resulting in a $50,000 archaeological study in 1996 commissioned by the Parks Department. Archeologist Linda Stone concluded that the site served as final-resting place for between 500 and 1000 individuals. Death records for the town of Flushing exist for the period 1881–1898, showing that during this period, 62% of the burials were African American or Native American, 34% were un-identified, and more than half were children under the age of five.  21st century  In 2004, Queens Borough President Helen Marshall and NYC Councilmember John Liu allocated $2.667 Million in funding to renovate the park, the largest improvement since 1938. A paved area bears a central stone inscribed with the sites history, and a historic wall was recreated and engraved with the names from the only four headstones remaining in 1919. Mature oaks, as well as new trees and shrubs, serve as the natural link between the past and present, providing shade for the burial ground as well as the newly installed playground which was moved to the northern end of the site, above whose entrance is the designation, ‘Martins Field\\". It was placed on a sill system foundation so as not to disturb the land, and is accessible from the 165th street entrance. In 2009 a naming ceremony for the site was held and parks department signs were placed for ‘The Olde Towne of Flushing Burial Ground’ and ‘Martin’s Field\\". In 2018 Mayor Bill de Blasio and members of the community along with Queens Borough President Melinda Katz announced at the site that $1.63 million in funding was allocated to reconstruct a commemorative plaza at the site, including a butterfly garden, new benches and directions which will be written in a variation of the Lenape tongue, an Algonquin language, recognizing the native American dead buried there. A circular plaza, bearing the names of the Manitou's of the N, S, E & W in the language of the Algonquin is featured. It has been designated to the New York State and National Register of Historic Places. In 2019, artist Alexandria Smith created an exhibition at the Queens Museum, Monuments To An Effigy, which sought to bring remembrance to the women who were buried at this site.https://www.nycaribnews.com/articles/queens-museum-presents-alexandria- smith-monuments-to-an-effigy/https://www.theartnewspaper.com/preview/at-the- queens-museum-an-artist-unearths-the-names-and-stories-of-buried-women  Gallery  File:Martin's Field and playground 20190410.jpg|Martin's Field and playground File:Grandfather of the North 20190410 114754.jpg|Chekesuwand File:Detail Parks sign.jpg|Sign detail File:Info sign OTFAABG 20190410.jpg|Detail of info sign File:Stone line marker OTFAABG 20190410.jpg|Marker of gravesite at OTFAABG File:South fence OTFBG 20190410.jpg|NYC Parks Dept fencing, signs, South of burial ground  References   External links  * Official website * Flushing Cemetery: Famous names at Find a Grave * Intermet data for Flushing Cemetery Category:African-American history in New York City Category:African-American cemeteries Category:Cemeteries on the National Register of Historic Places in New York City Category:History of New York City Category:National Historic Sites in New York (state) Category:Archaeological sites in New York City Category:1840 establishments in New York (state) Category:Monuments and memorials in New York City Category:African-American monuments and memorials Category:Cemeteries in Queens, New York Category:Flushing, Queens Category:National Register of Historic Places in Queens, New York ","title":"Old Town of Flushing Burial Ground"},{"id":"60115446","text":"Aliidiomarina taiwanensis is a Gram-negative, aerobic, heterotrophic and motile bacterium from the genus of Aliidiomarina which has been isolated from water from the Bitou Harbour in Taiwan.

The company traded under the brand name Sentinel Valves. History Alley & MacLellan, Sentinel Works, Jessie Street Glasgow Alley & MacLellan was founded in 1875 and was based in Polmadie, Glasgow. This company continued in operation until the 1950s. Initially manufacturing valves and compressors for steam engines, and later whole steamships. Their location away from the sea in Glasgow did not help them to be successful in shipbuilding so with the exception of ships in kit form - to be assembled on delivery - they concentrated on component manufacture for the ship building industry. Design expertise allowed them to expand in to other potentially lucrative markets: specifically steam-powered lorries, and valves for civic clean water and sewage systems, both major growth areas in the United Kingdom. In 1915 Alley & MacLellan moved the steam lorry business to a new company The Sentinel Waggon Works Ltd in Shrewsbury, England allowing the design and production of steam lorries to expand and become successful whilst freeing up space in the Glasgow factory. Expansion to Worcester, 1918  Advert for Alley & MacLellan, 1943 Three years later with the success of the Shrewsbury business, Alley & Maclellan formed a second subsidiary company in 1918, this time based in Worcester England, the aim of this company being to expand the design and manufacture of mechanical valves with the initial focus of new civic clean water and sewage systems. As with the Shrewsbury factory, a new design and management team was created with a group of around twenty management & technical staff moving from Glasgow to Worcester to expand production, further develop mechanical values and service this new market. In addition the factory created employment for between 300 and 500 local Worcester people.based on factory building size, no accurate information is known. Civic clean water and sewage systems Advert for Alley & MacLellan, 1943 UK Cities such as Worcester were expanding and rebuilding, post war, specifically the replacement of town and city domestic drinking water with clean (safe to drink) piped water and the replacement of Victorian sewage pipes that dumped domestic sewage into rivers with piped sewage removed from dwellings and received by new Sewage treatment plants for cleaning. The Worcester factory was built to provide products for both of these markets in the UK and abroad. Although the impetus for expansion for this factory was the rapid growth of UK civic clean fresh water and waste sewerage systems, the business designed and manufactured valves of all sizes and for almost every industry, this included heating systems, chemical plants, electricity generation (steam turbines) and the oil mining industry. it also supplied some values to its parent company's ship manufacturing projects. Electrical generation Advert for Alley & MacLellan, 1960 Electrical generation through the use of steam turbines powered by coal became commonplace in the UK in the 1930s with smaller 'town' generation plants being centralised and modernised in the 1950s, again the Worcester factory successfully marketed for steam generation piping valves. The Worcester company was very successful and the design team was also able to file patents for new unique valve designs and design improvements. As the major business opportunity – civic water systems – once built required little replacement for decades, the company continued to bid for further contracts for towns and cities around the world whilst diversifying into other liquid movement systems. Oil mining industry One area of success, was in a new patented design of capping value for the oil mining industry, designed by chief draftsman Mr D.C. Murray who had transferred from Glasgow, this involved building a ring valve made up of three parts around the top of the drilling pipe, a sliding valve could then be slowly screwed by hand across the vertical flow of oil, capping and containing the pressurized flow until collection pipework was assembled. Other industries The Worcester factory supplied valves for any and every liquid industry including * 1931 - The Sentinel Valve Works, Worcester supplied oil valves and steam valves to the new Bitumen plant of William Briggs & Sons Ltd., Dundee. Legacy The Sentinel name remains an important name in the world of valves with various new, unlinked companies now trading on this name based in the UK, Europe and America. Specifically relief valves that warn of the oper-pressurisation of a system (usually by whistling) are frequently marketed as Sentinel Valves. The Worcester factory The factory was of a prefabricated design, manufactured by the Glasgow company and assembled quickly in Bromyard Road, Worcester on the west side of the Worcester to Hereford railway line,\\"The Alley and MacLellan Sentinel Valve Works, Worcester, 1932\\". image from the Britain from above website. this also being the line that was used to deliver the factory from Glasgow. This must have allowed for rapid growth from nothing to a purpose-build factory in a very short period of time. The factory closed around 1967 with many of the staff transferring to the Mining Engineering Co. Ltd (MECO) factory (later part of Dowty Group) located along the same road. After the valve works closed, the factory site in Worcester was taken over by Kay & Co Mail Order company who replaced the factory with a large warehouse in 1969. This has also since been demolished and the site was developed into housing in 2014, the road being named Sentinel CloseUK Postcode WR2 5FA .

Kaplan is an American medical doctor specializing in research of muscoskeletal disorders such as fibrodysplasia ossificans progressiva (FOP). Education Frederick Kaplan received a bachelor's degree from Johns Hopkins University in 1972. He also obtained his Doctor of Medicine (MD) from Johns Hopkins University, graduating in 1976. FOP research In the mid 1980s, Kaplan met David Romanoff, the medical director of the Inglis House--a residential care facility for adults with disabilities. Two residents of the facility were diagnosed with fibrodysplasia ossificans progressiva (FOP), a very rare medical condition in which the soft tissue of the body ossifies, or turns to bone, over time. Romanoff was \\"grappling\\" with caring for the patients, and asked Kaplan if he would like to meet them, which he did. This was his first encounter with the disease beyond reading about it. In 1988, Kaplan met immunologist and geneticist Michael Zasloff; Zasloff introduced him to a patient with FOP, a young child. Kaplan stated that his reaction to meeting the young patient was \\"visceral and immediate\\", causing him to request a three-year sabbatical from his work so that he could begin to research FOP. Together, Zasloff and Kaplan collaborated to create the FOP Collaborative Research Project at the University of Pennsylvania. In 1992, Kaplan and Eileen Shore initiated the FOP Research Laboratory. In 2006, Shore and Kaplan discovered the cause of FOP, publishing their findings as \\"A recurrent mutation in the BMP type I receptor ACVR1 causes inherited and sporadic fibrodysplasia ossificans progressiva\\". The cause of the disease was traced to a single mutation in the activin A receptor, type I gene. After the discovery, Kaplan remarked, \\"It took our team of researchers and collaborators more than 15 years of diligent effort to unravel the genetic cause of FOP, which had been shrouded in mystery for so long.\\" As of 2015, Kaplan and Shore were the directors of the Center for Research in FOP and Related Disorders. They are considered the \\"world’s foremost experts on FOP\\". POH research In 1994, Kaplan and his colleagues authored a publication describing a new muscoskeletal disorder, progressive osseous heteroplasia (POH). POH was discovered as a distinct condition when Kaplan was investigating FOP. Some of the patients initially diagnosed with FOP were found to have a distinctly different manifestation of symptoms, though, like FOP, the disease still resulted in heterotopic ossification (formation of bone tissue outside the skeleton). None of the patients had congenital abnormalities of the big toe, which is a diagnostic feature for FOP. All of the patients also had ossification of the skin during infancy, which did not occur in FOP. Also, the pattern of ossification was different in these patients, spreading in an intramembranous fashion rather than endochondral. Awards and honors In 2006, the magazine Newsweek named Kaplan as one of their \\"15 People Who Make America Great\\". In 2009, he was elected to the National Academy of Medicine. In 2017, Kaplan received the Rare Impact Award from the National Organization for Rare Disorders. In 2018, he received the Grand Hamdan International Award via the Sheikh Hamdan bin Rashid Al Maktoum Award for Medical Sciences for his work in medical sciences.

From 1950 onwards the company was called the Esso Deutschland GmbH and has been a subsidiary of the ExxonMobil group since 1999. Founding document of the German-American Petroleum Society 1890 History Dapol sign On 25 February 1890 a joint venture between the German industrialists Franz Ernst Schütte, Carl Schütte and Wilhelm Anton Riedemann and the American industrialist John D. Rockefeller was agreed in the German city of Bremen to create a subsidiary of Standard Oil that would operate as a petroleum business in Germany. In 1891, the petrol import business of Edmund Siemers was transferred to the company In the mid-1890s, the company took over half of the shares of the Bremen Petroleum Refinery. At the beginning of the 20th century, the petroleum was sold under the brand DAPOL and the American gasoline under the brand DAPOLIN with the famous Indian head. In 1904, the Standard Oil Company took a 50 per cent stake in the company and moved the company's headquarters to Hamburg. After the Benzene association scientist, Walter Oswald had developed a super-gasoline in 1924 by adding benzene to gasoline., a DAPG delivery agreement enabled them to also offer a knock- resistant super gasoline by adding about 40% benzene. This product was called Duolin and sold in September 1928 as red-coloured Esso. A 10% benzene was added to the dapoline fuel to increase the knock resistance. Workshop with Esso and Dapolin pump (early 1930s) Esso-Tankstelle (2014) In 1928 the tanker shipping company of the German-American Petroleum Society was renamed to the Waried Tankschiff Rhederei GmbH. During the global economic crisis, the shares of MAN and Haniel in the Oelhag, the German petroleum company were bought by the German-American Petroleum Society and the German mineral oil company Rhenania-Ossag, that would be later called, Shell Germany Oil GmbH. ARCO, the American oil company sold so many shares at that time, that the three companies each owned a third of the shares. In 1930, the supply regulation of potato spirit for fuel purposes came into force in Germany for all fuel companies. In each case, 2.5% by weight of the produced or imported quantity of fuel was to be obtained from the Reich monopoly administration. This rate increased gradually until October 1932 to 10%. In 1931 DAPOLIN was renamed Standard Gasoline. In 1935, the German-American Petroleum Company was the market leader in Germany among the Big Five petrol station chains with 18,327 petrol stations (32.7%) as well as with Rhenania-Ossag with a sales ratio of 20.9%. During 1937-1938 the brand was renamed to ESSO. Later in 1938, the new ESSO brand was printed on the cover sheet of the drivers manual.Handbuch für Kraftwagenfahrer, 5th edition 1937 In 1938, German-American Petroleum Company and Rhenania-Ossag, with the help of their non-executable foreign exchange reserves, took over half of Oelhag. At this time, the Standard Oil of New Jersey owned 94% of the German-American Petroleum Society. As a result of the Anschluss of Austria in 1938 and the subsequent reorganization of the local industry, the Vacuum Oil Company was assigned to German-American Petroleum Society along with its refinery in the Kagran area of Vienna At the start of World War II, the German economy was converted to a war footing and all petroleum distribution companies in the Association of Petroleum Distribution were merged and only gasoline with no attached branding was sold. As the German-American Petroleum Company was still considered a German Company it was put on the List of Defense Contractors and received preferential material quotation. Two directors of the company, Karl Lindemann and Emil Helfferich were members of the Freundeskreis der Wirtschaft. The German-American Petroleum Company was renamed Esso AG in 1950 and then Esso Deutschland GmbH in 1999. It is now part of the ExxonMobil group. The name Esso is the phonetic pronunciation of the initials 'S' and 'O' in the name Standard Oil.

Brake wanted a word to describe the pressure she received by many to prioritize marriage in her own life when she did not want to. The term does not necessarily only involve social pressures for marriage but general pressures involving romance. Derivation The word amatonormativity comes from the root word amato or amatus, which is the Latin for \\"beloved\\". Another word which is similarly related to the word Amatonormativity is amative. Merriam-Webster dictionary defines the word amative as: strongly moved by love and especially sexual love. Relating to or indicative of love. Amorous is a closely related word also derived from amatus. Examples Elizabeth Brake describes the term as a pressure or desire for monogamy, romance, and/or marriage. The desire to find relationships that are romantic, sexual, monogamous, and lifelong has many social consequences. People who are asexual, aromantic, and/or nonmonogamous become social oddities. According to researcher Bella DePaulo it puts a stigma on single people as incomplete and re-enforces romantic partners to stay in unhealthy relationships because of a fear the partners may have of being single. According to Elizabeth Brake, one way in which this stigma is institutionally applied is the law and morality surrounding marriage. Loving friendships and other relationships are not given the same legal protections romantic partners are given through marriage. This legality also de-legitimizes the love and care found in other non-marital relationships. Brake wrote a book, \\"Minimizing Marriage, defines amatonormativity\\" where she stated, “the widespread assumption is that everyone is better off in an exclusive, romantic, long-term coupled relationship, and that everyone is seeking such a relationship.” See also *Criticism of marriage *Heteronormativity References Category:Feminist terminology Category:Neologisms Category:Sexuality and gender-related prejudices Category:Intimate relationships Category:Romance Category:Philosophy of love ","title":"Amatonormativity"},{"id":"60115846","text":"Hugh Montgomery (1720–December 23, 1779) was a member of Rowan County Committee of Safety in 1775, and, in spite of his age, briefly commanded of the Rowan County Regiment during the American Revolutionary War.

Subsequently, she received her PhD from the University of Pennsylvania in cell and molecular biology in 1987. FOP research Shore undertakes research into fibrodysplasia ossificans progressiva (FOP), a genetic disease that causes bone tissue to form outside the skeleton, known as heterotopic ossification. In 1992, Shore and Frederick Kaplan initiated the FOP Research Laboratory. Kaplan hired Shore because of her experience as a geneticist--she researched fruit fly larvae as a graduate student and studied mammalian embryology as a postdoctoral researcher. In 2006, Shore and Kaplan published their findings on the genetic mutation that causes FOP as a paper entitled \\"A recurrent mutation in the BMP type I receptor ACVR1 causes inherited and sporadic fibrodysplasia ossificans progressiva\\". The cause of the disease was traced to a single mutation in the activin A receptor, type I gene. Once the cause of the disease was identified, Shore became involved in efforts to control the disease and its symptoms. In 2016, she was coauthor on a paper that explored the efficacy of a drug on mice with the same genetic mutation. The authors concluded that the drug palovarotene showed promise in preventing heterotopic ossification, stating that there was \\"clear evidence for its encompassing therapeutic potential\\". As of 2015, Kaplan and Shore were the directors of the Center for Research in FOP and Related Disorders. They are considered the \\"world's foremost experts on FOP\\".

He was the son of Megadostes, and was appointed governor of Doriscus in 480 BC by Xerxes I, succeeding the governor who had been appointed by Darius the Great (522–486 BC). According to Herodotus, Mascames resisted all Greek attacks following the Second Persian invasion of Greece, and remained thus known as the only remaining Persian governor in Europe. Though the Greeks managed to clear other Persian garrisons in Europe, such as Eion, they were unable to take Doriscus from Mascames, which irked the Athenian military. As no one managed to dislodge him, Mascames was highly honored by Xerxes I and received annual gifts from him for his bravery. Mascames's descendants (who succeeded him) continued to receive gifts from Xerxes I's successor, Artaxerxes I (465–424 BC). According to Antigoni Zournatzi (2000), Mascames may have been recalled from Doriscus by ca. 465 BC. The Achaemenid ruler probably recalled Mascames with his garrison around that date, and finally abandoned Doriscus. Miroslav Ivanov Vasilev (2015) states that Mascames may have died by 465 BC.

On 26 October, Hari Singh announced Jammu and Kashmir would be joining India and signed an instrument of accession. The Maharajah's decision was controversial as he was a Hindu ruler governing a majority Muslim populace. On hearing of the decision Brown urged Ghansar Singh to ascertain the wishes of the local Muslim community over the accession, and warned him that he may have to take certain measures to avoid bloodshed.Victoria Schofield, Kashmir in Conflict: India, Pakistan and the Unending War, I.B.Tauris, 2003 Brown considered that the whole of Kashmir, including Gilgit, should go to Pakistan in view of the fact that the population was predominantly Muslim and the whole raison d'etre of Pakistan was to accommodate majority Muslim provinces.

In her plastic arts work, she combines techniques of drawing, painting and collage, using materials such as charcoal, crayon, jute, oil, pastels, paint and silk. Her book Purisima includes both prose and poetry. Quiñones received a 2010 National Prize of Plastic Arts of Venezuela. Her works have been exhibited in major galleries and exhibitions including the Salón Nacional de Jóvenes Artistas (National Salon of Young Artists), the Galería Tiempo Argentino, the first Havana Biennial and the Galería de Arte Nacional (GAN), and have been shown in Buenos Aires, Colombia, Cuba, Mexico, Spain, Switzerland, Germany, and the United States as well as Venezuela.  Early life and education  In 1956, the Quiñones-Hernández family moved to Caracas. In 1972, she entered the Escuela de Artes Plásticas Cristóbal Rojas de Caracas (School of Plastic Arts Cristobal Rojas), where she studied with artists including Luis Guevara Moreno, Alirio Rodríguez, Edgar Sánchez and Pedro León Zapata. In 1975, she graduated from the School of Plastic Arts Cristóbal Rojas. She traveled to Bogotá and Medellín between 1976 and 1977, visiting Galleries and Museums. She was inspired by the work of Colombian painter Fernando Botero. She visited New York, Panama and Mexico at the end of 1978.  Artwork  In the 80s, she lived and traveled through all of Europe, traveling to Germany, Switzerland, and Zurich. While in Madrid, Spain, she connected with Goya’s Black Paintings series and the works of Gaudí in Barcelona. She visited Paris and Rome, meeting the greatest plastic artists of the era. She attended the Venice Biennale and returned to Spain with a complete vision of the greatest masters of European art, and an intense study of Picasso’s work. She returned to Venezuela in 1981, and inspired by the Black Paintings, created a series of large scale portraits and religious self portraits. Here, she introduced the double self portrait that she has developed throughout her career, most evident in her work El Arcángel. Here, she starts to center her work around double identity and experience (desdoblamiento). Her first nude self portraits were made with a religious theme, incorporating Venezuelan public figures. Crucifixion became the center of her religious work, seen in La Cena where she personifies Jesus and Judas in a double self portrait. Here, she started a brief white phase based on the theme of communion. In 1982, Quiñones started and finished her Penintencias series, incorporating collage in her self portraits. She started her series La Boda, a collage series, and ended her white phase, which developed with a religious mysticism (misticismo) best exemplified by her piece, Los Invitados. In 1984, she launched her red phase with Las Niñas de Carroll series, an homage to Lewis Carroll. She finished her El Tarot series in sketch and oil paint. In 1987 she posed for a nude painting for the photography exhibition Los Revulsivos by Luigi Scotto. This exhibition was displayed in a gallery called Los Espacios Cálidos in the Caracas Athenaeum, which is a cultural institution. One year later, the exhibition was displayed in the south of Brazil. At the beginning of the 90s, Quiñones started the series Tiempo de Flores y Otros Deleites, which featured works painted with her fingers. Later she traveled to the Venezuelan Andes mountains and stayed in Rubio, a town in the state of Táchira for one year. Here she started and finished the series Los Infantes, which she said was inspired by her dreams of games, dolls and objects from her infancy dressed in illusion and fantasy. The series used mixed media including oil paints on paper. Quiñones returned to Caracas in the middle of 1995. In Caracas, she exhibited the Los Infantes series and finished the oil painting series called Viaje al fin de la noche, where she started exploring nude self-portraits again. She profoundly integrated the Catholic religion into her life and work. At the beginning of 1999 she continued with everyday characters and included portraits of children, Jewish families and Holocaust victims within a series. Textures and rapid brush strokes can be seen in the background of the paintings. She finished and showcased the oil painting series called Por el Mundo. Azalea Quiñones completed a triptych entitled Paz en la tierra (Peace on Earth) in 2002, followed by the pieces Rojo infinito (Infinite red, 2004) and Del infinito Rojo (2004). She received the Premio Nacional de Cultura Artes Plásticas Venezuela (National Award of Culture of Venezuela for Plastic Arts), 2008-2010.

It was probably laid out in the mid-eighteenth century and by the early nineteenth century had over 200 slaves before that institution was abolished in the British Empire. In 1870 it was one of the plantations inspected in detail by the commissioners investigating labour conditions in the colony. They found the majority of the workers to be indentured labourers from India and China. In the early twentieth century its workers participated in the unrest that was seen on a number of plantations in Georgetown. Plantation Peter's Hall is now the name of a suburb of Georgetown in modern Guyana. Early history According to a Dutch map of 1759, a plantation, numbered 12 and named Peeters Hall, was created in 1755 and owned by Pieter Haley.Caerte van de rivier Demerary van ouds Immenary : gelegen op Suyd Americaes Noordkust &c.; Suriname 1599–1975.

All the original plantations were laid out to be adjacent to water for transport and the irrigation of crops, with three canals (1,2,3) being built from 1775 to allow additional plantations to be created further from the river's edge.Rodney, Walter.

In 1870, commissioners were appointed to enquire into the conditions of immigrant labour in British Guiana following disturbances at various plantations. In October that year they inspected Peter's Hall, then owned by The Colonial Company Limited, and found the plantation's workers to be:Hollett, pp. 151–154. :500 male and 140 female indentured workers from India :201 male and 22 female indentured workers from China :35 male and 15 female workers from India who were not indentured. Among the workers were 60 Indians who had migrated to Guyana after spending ten years in Saint Lucia. They wished to return to India but had been unable to persuade the British government to provide the return passage to which they were legally entitled. Workers often deserted, including 50–60 who were mostly Chinese, and efforts were being made by the manager William Dudley Scott to recover them with mixed success. The facilities at Peter's Hall included a small \\"hospital\\", a \\"gambling room\\" and a one-room school that the teacher complained the children were discouraged from attending by the driver (supervisor). The high number of Indian workers may reflect the high levels of Indian migration to British Guiana as planters attempted to replace slave labour freed after abolition. Over 238,000 Indians migrated to the colony as indentured labour between 1838 and the end of the migration in the early 20th-century.An overview of Indian Indentureship in Guyana, 1838–1917.

In 1883, The Argosy reported in their survey of British Guiana's sugar estates that Peter's Hall had been enlarged with the addition of the Eccles and Henry plantations and half each of the Profit and Sage Pond plantations making it a \\"very valuable amalgamation\\". The paper reported that it had had at least $50,000 spent on improvements and was made up of 937 acres of cane, 166 of plantains, and 260 acres uncultivated, producing a crop of 1,100 hogsheads (990 tons).Rodney, pp. 48–49. The uncultivated land included that used for the extensive irrigation and drainage channels that were required due to the water-intensive nature of the sugar crop and the often swampy and flood-prone nature of the area.

In a 1924 revolt, labourers \\"armed with sticks and beating drums\\" enter the managers' houses at several plantations including Peter's Hall, and made the house servants leave. The riots often had a carnival atmosphere and at Peter's Hall in 1924, the labourers were accompanied by a \\"foo-foo band\\". Some European observers thought the participants largely harmless although the colonial government took a more disapproving view and there was sometimes violence from both sides. Academics have seen the parades through the streets, stick waving, drumming, music, revelry, and visiting homes to consume food and drink, as part of a West Indian carnival tradition with African roots even though the participants were by no means all of African descent.De Barros, pp. 148–151.

The second fortification part is roughly long system of ramparts forming an outer ring. The within the main fortification is approx. 300 to 550 by 800 meters.

The side easiest to approach of the fortress was protected by the highest rampart sections. Inhabitants Its inhabitants were the people of the Early Iron Hallstatt culture, and they built the Earth's fortress around 750 BC. Later, around 350 BC it was further modified by the Celts and occupied as the capital of a kingdom until Roman times. The Romans might have forced the inhabitants of the city to leave their town because of their magnitude and good defences, and instead founded the nearby Sopianae, the predecessor of today's Pécs. Pauline Monastery The Jakab Hill Pauline Monastery was a Pauline Order Monastery close by Kővágószőlős. It was established in 1225 but during the course of the Hungarian-Turkish wars, it was abandoned like many monasteries in the area. It was restored again in 1736.

Savage was arrested by Immigration and Customs Enforcement and charged with being in the United States illegally from Britain. Nudy was charged with aggravated assault and violation of the Georgia Gang Act. Nudy's lawyer stated \\"We believe that Young Nudy is innocent and this is a case of mistaken identity. Young Nudy's legal team is working closely with law enforcement to ensure this case does not get blown out of proportion.\\" Nudy's attorney stated that the charges stem from a 2017 investigation, which he states Atlanta Police investigated Nudy on and dropped the charges. On February 12, Savage was released on bail, and on February 19, Nudy was granted $100,000 bail, and was released the next day.

She studied variable stars. Early life Palmér was born on February 14, 1905 in Blentarp, Sweden, the only child to builder Hans Persson Palmér and his wife Elsa Jeppsson. Her father died when she was five years old and in 1910 Elsa moved to Järrestad. It is unclear how she finished her early education but she must have been somewhat self-taught as access to high school was not formally established for girls until 1928. Education In the fall of 1925, Palmér studied at the Faculty of Philosophy in Lund where she studied astronomy and mathematics. She studied under her mentor and friend, Knut Lundmark and in 1930 was able to get a large grant to travel and visit observatories abroad in Prague, Vienna, Budapest, Potsdam, Danzig (now Gdansk) and Berlin. She was courageous and made a startling impression as a young women in a field dominated by men. She defended her thesis in 1939 at Lund University on a thesis on irregular variable starswith Knut Lundmark as supervisor. She is the first Swedish female doctor in astronomy. Career She listed over 259 stars with irregular periodicity variability, examined their galactic distribution, arranged by spectral type. Most spectra lacked the lines typical of the Mira variable stars. She discovered that the light curves of some stars could be interpreted as interference between two or more simultaneous, periodic events in the stars. Her academic career was stopped short because of World War II and she started work at the Swedish National Defence Radio Establishment as a cryptographer systems analyst. Palmer decoded Soviet marine signaling messages in the Arctic Ocean. Palmer never got any real recognition from cryptography colleagues Gunnar Blom and Sven Wäsström, who considered her an insignificant \\"star analyst\\". The Supreme Chief, Commander Torgil Thorén, however, stated in 1943 that she always \\"attended to prompt perception, energy and a clear sense of order\\" and that \\"she always included the work with interest and diligence and observed impeccable and honest conduct\\". In 1945, while still employed at FRA, she published a list of another 98 red variable stars, the largest uniform compilation of non-Mira variable stars. She was seriously considered for a travel scholarship for \\"academically educated women\\" to do research in the United States but was not chosen. In 1945, at only 41 she gave up on her career as an astronomer to become a professor in Halmstad and look after her aging mother. Certainly the most qualified and dedicated teacher she just could not tolerate students who did not understand math and physics. It was a psychological blind spot for her and her students feared going up to the blackboard to answer questions in front of her. She certainly did not enjoy being a teacher and yearned to return to her previous life. She was friendly but monotonous. When Elsa died Frida opened her social circle and started an Association for Working Women in Stockholm. She continued to travel and went to Cairo, Egypt in 1963. Palmér died on October 13, 1966 in Halmstad, Sweden. The Frida Palméro observatory at Halmstad University in south Sweden is named after her.

She is credited as a founder of modern art in Paraguay, through her work in the plastic arts, and through her influence upon her students, particularly Olga Blinder, Pedro Di Lascio, and Aldo Del Pino, who became the vanguard of the new movement. The work of Ofelia Echagüe Vera marked the beginning of a new period that changed the role of women in Paraguayan plastic arts.  Early Life  Ofelia Echagüe began studying in her home city of Asunción with Héctor Da Ponte, Modesto Delgado Rodas, Pablo Alborno, and Adán Kunos. She was awarded a scholarship to Montevideo, Uruguay, where she defined her vocation carrying out studies under the direction of Professor Domingo Bazzurro (1939-1941). In Buenos Aires, Argentina, she did work with Alfredo Guido and Emilio Centurión, and she graduated from the . In the 1950s, Echagüe further collaborated with Livio Abramo, a Brazilian artist from Paraguay, and together they developed the technique of woodcut prints, an intricate and complicated art form.  Career Path  Paraguayan Art critic Ticio Escobar wrote of Ofelia Echagüe: The work of Ofelia Echagüe, in the vision of Escobar, retains an “insistence of the formal aspects,” which don’t diminish what is expressed. Ticio Escobar also notes, “however her robust personality is structured in careful compositions and meditations that denounce the influence of post impressionism in the River Plate Region, and an unquestionable amount of significant related works to the existential problem of the man; Always at the bottom of loneliness and depression in half-empty environments invaded by cruel light, a feeling of isolation between his women of tough bodies and missing faces.” Ofelia Echagüe participated in an important collective exhibition of Paraguayan plastic artists, which marked a turning point for a new period that changes the role of women in the Paraguayan plastic arts. From this perspective through her work, Ofelia Echagüe changes into an authentic precursor because it breaks the schematics of the excessively modest puritanism in that Paraguayan art period.  Last Years and Death  When she returned to her country, Ofelia Echagüe was dedicated to teaching, specifically at Ateneo Paraguayo first, and the Escuela de Bellas Artes after. She died in Asunción in 1987.

The Democratic ticket of incumbent mayor and businessman Greg Fischer was elected to his third and final term. He defeated the Republican ticket of engineer and former Louisville Metro Councilwoman Angela Leet. As the incumbent mayor, Fischer secured his party's nomination with little resistance. Despite the presence of five total candidates on the Democratic primary ballot, Fischer won the primary with a resounding 75% of the vote. The Republicans experienced a slightly more competitive primary, despite having only two candidates total. Leet clinched her party's nomination in May, defeating Bob DeVore, the Republican nominee for Mayor of Louisville in 2014. Fischer and Leet were challenged in the General election ballot by a total of seven nonpartisan and independent candidates. Nine total candidates appeared on the 2018 General Election ballot. Despite having participated in previous mayoral elections and having a presence in Louisville, the Green and Libertarian parties did not field candidates in the 2018 race. The campaigns focused heavily on local issues, with both candidates having centered their campaigns on completely different issues. Fischer campaigned on a record he described as one of \\"unprecedented growth\\" — specifically citing over 2,700 new businesses and $13 billion in capital investment. In contrast, Leet focused heavily on crime, specifically the sharp increase in Louisville's homicide rate, over the course of Fischer's tenure. The campaign was marked by record levels of fundraising, with over $2 million being raised from both sides. The Fischer campaign raised approximately $1.6 million, which stands in stark contrast to the Leet campaign, who only managed to raise $458,400 total, with about $200,000 coming out of her own pocket for the general election. Fischer defeated Leet, winning an overwhelming majority of the popular vote. Fischer won 61.3% of the popular vote compared to Leet's 36.5%. Despite receiving approximately five thousand more votes than in the 2014 Louisville mayoral election, Fischer's overall percentage of votes received was lower than in 2014, where he received 68.5% of the vote. Fischer became the second mayor in Louisville's history to win a third term, and the first mayor to do so under the Consolidated city–county government. He will be unable to run again due to term limits set by the Kentucky General Assembly in 1986. Fischer was sworn in for his final term on January 8, 2019. Nominations On May 22, 2018, the Democratic and Republican parties held their respective closed primary elections. Approximately 95,000 votes were cast in both party primaries, though turnout for the Democratic primary was more than triple the Republican primary. More than three-fourths of votes were cast in the Democratic primary. Approximately 15.8% of Jefferson County's registered voters participated in 2018's mayoral primaries, which is slightly lower than the national turnout average of 19.6%. Democratic Party Primary On March 24, 2017, during a speech to local nonprofit groups, incumbent mayor Greg Fischer became the first candidate to formally announce his campaign when he stated that he would seek a third term as Louisville's mayor. Fisher remained uncontested for the nomination until October 12, 2017, when Louisville Attorney Ryan Fenwick announced he was running to challenge Fischer in the 2018 Democratic Primary. A member of Kentuckians for the Commonwealth, the 30-year-old Fenwick declared himself to be the most progressive candidate in the race. Over the course of the primary, Fenwick ran an unapologetically left-wing campaign, prioritizing issues such as a $15 minimum wage, and criticizing the use of tax dollars for corporate developments. According to Fenwick, his campaign was inspired by the successful primarying of Jackson, Mississippi mayor Tony Yarber by progressive attorney Chokwe Antar Lumumba. With an incumbent mayor running for re-election against mostly token opposition, the race for the Democratic nomination was largely uneventful. The nomination process consisted solely of the 2018 Democratic mayoral primary, held on May 22, 2018. For the majority of the race, Fischer did not acknowledge his primary opponents in any of his public comments. His only interaction with any other primary candidate was a single debate with candidate Ryan Fenwick, which took place on Monday, April 30, 2018. Despite the presence of five total candidates, Fischer easily won his party's primary with over 75% of the vote. Republican Party Primary Campaign Endorsements Results Greg Fischer, the incumbent Democratic mayor of Louisville, defeated Republican nominee and former member of the Louisville Metro Council Angela Leet, tallying 61.3% of the vote to Leet's 36.5%, with the remainder of the vote going to various Independent candidates, most notably former professional football player Chris Thieneman, who received 0.4% of the vote.

While a word is traditionally defined as a function from a set of non-negative integers to letters, a signal is a functions from a set of real number to letters. This allow to use formalism similar to the ones of automata theory to deal with continuous signal.  Example  Consider an elevator. What is formally called a letter is could be in fact an information such that \\"someone is pressing the button on the 2nd floor\\", or \\"the doors are currently open on the third floor\\". In this case, a signal indicates, at each time, which is the current state of the elevator and of its buttons. The signal can then be analyzed by formal method to check whether a property such that \\"each time the elevator is called, it arrives in less than three minutes assuming that no one held the door for more than fifteen seconds\\" holds. A statement such as this one is usually expressed in metric temporal logic, an extension of linear temporal logic which allow to express time constraints. A signal may be passed to a model, such as a signal automaton, which will decide, given the letters or actions which already occurred, what is the next action which should be done. In our example, to which floor the elevator must go. Then a program may test this signal and check the above mentioned property. That is, it will try to generate a signal in which the door is never hold open for more than fifteen seconds, and in which a user must wait more than three minutes after calling the elevator.  Definition  Given an alphabet A, a signal \\\\gamma is a sequence (I_0,a_0),(I_1,a_1),\\\\dots,, finite or infinite, such that a_i\\\\in A, each I_i\\\\subseteq\\\\mathbb R_+ are pairwise disjoint intervals, 0\\\\in I_0, and I_i\\\\cup I_{i+1} is also an interval. Given t\\\\in I_i for some i, \\\\gamma(t) represents a_i.  Properties  Some authors restrict the kind of signals they considers. We list here some standard property that a signal may or may not satisfies.  Finite variability  Intuitively, a signal is said to be finitely variable, or to have the finite variability property, if during each bounded interval, the letter change a finite number of time. In our previous elevator example, this property would means that a user may only press a button a finite number of time during a finite time. And similarly, in a finite time, the elevator can only opens and close its door a finite number of time. Formally, a signal is said to have the finite variability property, unless the sequence is infinite and \\\\bigcup_i I_i is bounded. Intuitively, the finite variability property state that there is not an infinite number of change in a finite time. Having the finite variability property is similar to the notion of being non-Zeno for a timed word..  Bounded variability  The notion of bounded variability is a restriction to the notion of finite variability. A signal has the bounded variability property if there exists a lower bound between the beginning of two intervals with the same letter. Before giving a formal definition, we give an example of signal which is finitely variable but not boundedly variable. Take the alphabet A=\\\\\\\\{a,b\\\\\\\\}. Take the interval \\\\gamma which sends the reals of the form n+\\\\frac{c}n with n\\\\in\\\\mathbb N and c to a and every other reals to b. During each finite time interval, the letter change a finite number of time. Thus this signal is finitely variable. However, the distance between two successive occurrences of the letter a is arbitrarily small. Thus it does not have the bounded variability property. Let a sequence (I_0,a_0),(I_1,a_1),\\\\dots. If a_i e a_{i+1} for each integer i, then the sequence is said to have the bounded variability property if there exists a real r>0 such that, for each i with a_i=a_j such that there exists no k with i and a_i=a_k then the difference between the lower bound of I_j and of I_i is at least r. Note that each sequence \\\\gamma is equivalent to a sequence \\\\gamma' in which two successive letters are distinct. The sequence \\\\gamma is said to have the bounded variability property if and only if \\\\gamma' has the bounded variability property. A set of signal is said to has the bounded variability property if the above mentioned lower bound r can be chosen to be the same for each signal of the set. We know give main reason to consider signals with bounded variabilities. Assume we need to create a system, such as a signal automaton, which need to recall everything which occurred in the last time units. If we know that the signal is boundedly variable, we can compute an upper bound on the number of action which occurred during one time unit. Thus, we can create such a system and ensure that it only requires a finite memory. For example, for an arbitrary predicate e, the signal stating whether the statement \\"p holds sometime in the next time unit\\" holds has the bounded variability property. Indeed when this statement becomes true, it remains true for a full time unit. Thus the difference between two occurrences where this statement becomes true is greater than a time unit.  Bipartite signal  A signal is said to be bipartite if the sequence of intervals start with a singular interval - i.e. a closed interval whose lower and upper bound are equal, hence a set which is a singleton. And if the sequence alternate between singular intervals and open intervals. Each signal is equivalent to a bipartite signal. Indeed, any interval which is closed on the left is the union of a singular interval and of an interval open on the left, in this order. And similarly for intervals closed on the right. A signal automaton reading a bipartite signal has a special form. Its set of locations can be partitioned into locations for singular interval, and locations for open intervals. Each transition goes from a singular location to an open one and reciprocally.

It is a naturally occurring ingredient present in many plants, such as the Rhododendron. . The phenolic compound was first developed in 2010 as a tyrosinase inhibitor for skin- lightening cosmetics. In 2013, after rhododendrol reportedly caused skin depigmentation in consumers using RD-containing skin-brightening cosmetics, the cosmetics were withdrawn from the market. The skin condition, caused by RD, is called RD-induced leukoderma. Rhododendrol exerts melanocyte cytotoxicity via a tyrosinase-dependent mechanism. It has been shown to impair the normal proliferation of melanocytes through reactive oxygen species- dependent activation of GADD45 . It is now well established that rhododendrol is a potent tyrosinase inhibitor.  Structure and synthesis   Structure  Rhododendrol occurs as the glucoside rhododendrin in leaves of the Rhododendron (Ericacae), and it naturally occurs as a phenolic compound in plants such as Acer nikoense , Betula platyphylla, and the Chinese red birch Betula Alba. The compound can be obtained from alkylation of phenols (C6H5OH). The molecule has a para-substituted structure, and one chiral center. Also, the compound has a natural charge.  Biosynthesis  There are several ways to synthesise rhododendrol. First, the synthesis can be achieved in six steps from benzaldehyde. The key reactions in this method include aldol condensation and trichloroacetimidate glycosylation . The compound can also be prepared by reducing raspberry ketone (4-(4-hydroxyphenyl)-2- butanone) with Raney nickel in EtOH . In addition, Rhododendrol can be synthesised from p-coumaric acid. This pathway involves reduction of the aliphatic double bond present in p-coumaric acid.  Mechanisms of action  The mechanism of action of rhododendrol has been investigated in multiple studies which revealed that RD competes with tyrosine for hydroxylation by tyrosinase and interferes with melanin synthesis . First, RD is catalysed by tyrosinase to produce toxic metabolites as RD-cyclic catechol. These reactive metabolites cause damage to the melanocytes. There is still uncertainty, however, how the metabolites result in melanocyte damage. A previous report reported that the melanocyte toxicity of rhododendrol is caused by the production of cytotoxic reactive oxygen species (ROS) . However, another study stated that there was no ROS detected in the rhododendrol-treated melanocytes, but a tyrosinase-dependent accumulation of endoplasmic reticulum stress and activation of the apoptotic pathway . Even though there is still no full agreement on the exact mechanism of action, it is suggested that the mechanism of RD-induced leukoderma closely resembles the mechanism displayed in the figure below (Suggested mechanism of Rhododendrol.png). center In some individuals, a T-cell response is observed. The melanocyte cell lysates may sensitise T-cells, and the immunised cytotoxic T-lymphocytes (specific to Melan A, which is a melanocytic differentiation marker) may enhance the RD-induced leukoderma or evoke vitiligo-like lesions on the non-applied skin .  Metabolism  Rhododendrol is metabolised via tyrosinase-catalysed oxidation. Therefore, the enzyme tyrosinase is necessary for the oxidation of rhododendrol. Tyrosinase regularly plays an essential role in the production of melanocytes called the melanogenesis. After oxidation of rhododendrol by the tyrosinase enzyme, several kinds of phenols and catechols are formed. These phenols and catechols together form ortho- quinones (o-quinones) . Presence of o-quinones can lead to cytotoxicity via the production of reactive oxygen species (ROS) or by the binding to enzymes or DNA . When rhododendrol is metabolised via the tyrosinase-catalysed oxidation RD-quinone will be formed . This formation gives rise to the formation of secondary quinones. As described in the mechanisms of action, the presence of quinones could cause cytotoxicity to melanocytes by the production of ROS or by binding to DNA and enzymes.  Adverse effects  Considering the use of rhododendrol is prohibited since 2013, the knowledge about the side effects rhodendodrol causes is limited. As stated above, the main known adverse effect of rhododendrol is melanocyte toxicity . Melanocytes are melanin-producing cells, primarily responsible for skin colour. Melanocyte toxicity induces apoptosis of the cell, causing the melanocytes to die. This is due to an increased expression of caspase‐3 and caspase‐8 . Caspase proteins are crucial mediators of apoptosis, with caspase-3 and caspase-8 being death proteases . Considering melanocytes are responsible for skin colour, apoptosis of these cells causes the colour of the skin to vanish . This disease caused by rhododendrol is called leukoderma. Leukoderma, also known as vitiligo, is a skin disease characterized by patches of the skin losing their pigment. This rhododendrol-induced depigmentation can be either long-term and short term. In most cases, repigmentation and cessation of further depigmentation occur after discontinuing the exposure to the substance. However, some patients develop vitiligo vulgaris through the spread of depigmentation into non-exposed areas. This only occurs after severe chemical damage . In addition, rhododendrol not only causes melanocytes to go into apoptosis but it also inhibits melanogenesis. Meaning that the use of rhododendrol not only causes melanocytes to die, but also prevents the development of new melanocytes .  Toxicity  Various studies have shown that there is more than one mechanism by which rhododendrol can have a toxic effect. This toxic effect of rhododendrol is found in the melanocytes, which gives rise to skin depigmentation.  ROS  Rhododendrol can have a toxic effect via the production of reactive oxygen species (ROS). This will cause an impairment in the further development of melanocytes in the skin. Impairment is caused by upregulation of the GADD45 gene. A study of Kim et al. showed that the production of ROS, which gives rise to more production of GADD45, is already found at low concentrations of rhododendrol. At the time that rhododendrol was used in cosmetic products, it contained concentrations of 2%. The study of Kim et al. suggests that the production of reactive oxygen species at low concentrations may have contributed to the development of leukoderma in users of these cosmetic products .  Reactive metabolites  The study of Ito et al. showed that rhododendrol exerts its toxic effect in the melanocytes via tyrosinase-dependent mechanisms. This tyrosinase enzyme breaks rhododendrol down into the following reactive metabolites: RD-quinone and RD-cyclic quinone . These reactive metabolites can bind to proteins which contain a thiol-group or it can form radicals. These radicals are toxic to the melanocytes as it causes auto-oxidation of the cells . Auto-oxidation, in turn, causes oxidative stress to cells, which will impair the natural growth and function of the melanocytes. Rhododenol and raspberry ketone impair the regular proliferation of melanocytes through reactive oxygen species-dependent activation of GADD45 .  Effects on animals  The effect of rhododendrol (4-(4-hydroxyphenyl)-2-butanol) is measured in mice as well as in guinea pigs . These studies were performed to elucidate the aetiology of RD-induced leukoderma. The data of these studies revealed that the amount of RD applied to the skin is highly relevant considering that high doses of RD are required in order to cause cytotoxicity. This finding is contrary to the results presented in the study of Kim et al., which is performed in humans. Furthermore, the animal studies enlightened the importance of the ER-stress response. It is suggested that the activity of the ER-stress response may determine whether melanocytes survive or die. Also, the study of Abe et al. revealed that the autophagy pathway may be involved in the resistance to the cytotoxicity of RD . Since the biochemical and histological characteristics of the used mice in the animal studies (hairless hk14-SCF Tg mice) closely resembled the characteristics of the human skin, these newly generated mice could be used as experimental animal models to investigate chemical vitiligo further.

She received an Academy Award nomination for Best Picture for her work on Roma, and was the first Latin American woman to earn a nomination in that category. She also won two BAFTAs and a British Independent Film Award, as well as other nominations for her production work on the film. Early life and education Rodríguez grew up in Venezuela. Influenced by her parents' love of film, she was interested in the subject from a young age and decided it would be her career. She moved to Boston to attend Suffolk University and took additional courses in filmmaking at New York University during the summers. Having decided to pursue film production, she interned for a television production company in New York after graduation. When her mother was on her way to New York for a visit, a chance encounter led to an opportunity for Rodríguez to interview for Alfonso Cuarón's production company. She was brought on as an intern first, then hired as his personal assistant two months later. Career Rodríguez earned more responsibilities and more prominent roles in Cuarón's company, moving from personal assistant to director's assistant during the production of Children of Men, for which she moved to London. She described her work on the film as a significant learning experience about production and operations of a film set. She then worked as associate producer on Gravity and the short film Aningaaq in 2013, before rising to run the production company. In that capacity she produced Roma in 2018, which won wide acclaim. In an Associated Press interview, she described her role as producer as similar to \\"general manager [...] little glamour and a lot of work.\\" She described several significant challenges during production. It was her first time working outside of a studio, and all of the assistance that a studio provides, putting additional responsibilities on her and co-producer Nicolas Celis. Though she has had a long working relationship with Cuarón, she has called him demanding and said that \\"he always gets his way, somehow\\" when it comes to filmmaking. Cuarón did not share a script, wanted to film on location in real Mexican neighborhoods, and employed people without traditional acting experience, creating unusual complications for production as she worked to recreate the way his home looked in the 1970s. She said that while she thought Roma was a \\"spectacular\\" movie, which resonated with her own experiences growing up in Venezuela, she was surprised that it found widespread success outside of Latin America. Accolades Roma earned many awards and accolades, including several for Rodríguez. She was nominated, with Alfonso Cuarón, for Best Picture at the 91st Academy Awards, becoming the first Latin American woman to be nominated in that category. She and Cuarón also won two BAFTAs for Best Film and Best Film Not in the English Language and a British Independent Film Award for Best Foreign Independent Film (with Cuarón and co-producer Nicolas Celis). She also received a nomination for the Producers Guild of America Award for Best Theatrical Motion Picture.

Her abstract works of sculpture heavily featured the dynamics of war, peace, and human relationships.  Biography  Dekker was born in the Kingdom of the Netherlands in 1931. Her family was involved with the Dutch communist community, and as such fled the country when the Netherlands was invaded and occupied by Nazi Germany in 1940. Interested in sculpture from a young age, Dekker was educated at the Dutch Academy of Fine Arts, where she studied in the 1950s. She then moved to Paris to further her art career; while in France, she worked in the studio of prominent sculptor Ossip Zadkine. She held her first exhibition in Nîmes in 1953. In 1957, Dekker moved with her husband (a food chemist) to Nigeria; she would live and work there until 1971, and the nation's unique artistic tradition impacted Dekker's perception of art. While in Nigeria, her husband was killed in an accident. Dekker remarried, but this marriage ended in a separation. Dekker moved to London in 1972. While living in the United Kingdom, Dekker became a part of the burgeoning Women's liberation movement. During the period between her arrival and the mid-1980s, Dekker worked as a graphic designer during this time, and co-founded a collective of female graphic designers. She returned to her native Netherlands in the mid-1980s, where she founded a publishing house in Amsterdam. She and her partner (Ankie Peypers, a Dutch poetess) moved to France in the early 1990s. In 1997, Dekker returned to sculpting, a trade which she continued in until her death in 2003.

She is interested in organic electronics, polymer physics and drug delivery systems. She studies the impact of nanoconfinement on the structure of materials. She was awarded the 2019 American Physical Society John H. Dillon Medal.  Early life and education  Fakhraai studied physics at Sharif University of Technology. She graduated with a bachelor's degree in physics in 1999 and a master's degree in 2001. She moved to the University of Waterloo for her graduate studies, earning a PhD in 2007. She worked on thin polymer films and how they interact with surfaces. Farkhraai joined the University of Toronto as a postdoctoral fellow, working with Gilbert Walker. She moved to University of Wisconsin–Madison as a Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council fellow, where she worked with Mark Ediger.  Career  Fakhraai was appointed to the University of Pennsylvania as an Assistant Professor in 2011. She is a co-director of REACT (Research and Education in Active Coating Technologies for the Human Habitat), a program which trains students to develop new coating for disaster relief. She studies material properties at small length scales and slow dynamics. Specifically, she is interested in glassy materials at interfaces. Her group demonstrated that below the glass transition temperature, the interfacial dynamics of materials are orders of magnitude faster than dynamics in the bulk. They investigate how this mobile interfacial layer impacts the properties of the materials. Understanding the dynamics of the interfacial layer permits Fakhraai to produce glasses that are near-equilibrium at temperatures lower than their glass transition temperature, using physical vapour deposition. The glass transition temperature represents the temperature at which a system is unable to reach an equilibrium on lab timescales. Physical vapor deposition allows each molecule that is deposited on the surface to experience enhanced mobility, allowing them to reach their lowest energy state. She studies how chemical structure and fabrication techniques impact the optoelectronic properties of thin films, including their birefringence and charge transport. She demonstrated that it is possible to make amorphous phases of glass at high density. Fakhraai's group have developed synthetic routes to create dielectric-core gold nanoparticles. These nanoparticles can be used for surface-enhanced Raman spectroscopy, biological sensing and temperature monitoring. Their random molecular packing results in an inherently disordered structure and magnetic dipole plasmons. Her recent work has looked at the surface assembly and adhesion of amyloid aggregates using atomic force microscopy. Her group have developed high resolution characterisation techniques to study amyloid aggregates in aqueous conditions. She also studies the growth of peptides and proteins in two- and three-dimensions, as well as supercooled liquids. Fakhraai was concerned about the impact of Donald Trump's travel ban and has spoken about the need to support students protected by the DACA program. She is an advocate for women in science, and has urged social scientists to consider the agency and humanity of women scientists when talking about a so-called gender-equality paradox.

Background and attack On , 11:00 AM, Ori's relatives reported her absence to the police. Ori volunteered at a youth center in Jerusalem and, according to friends, on the same day she had left the center agitated and went to seclude herself in nature, as she often liked to do. On 19:14 PM that day, her lifeless body was found by the police in the Ein Yael forest in the outskirts of Jerusalem, with signs of harsh violence. On , a suspect for the murder named Arafat Irafaiya was arrested by the Israeli security forces in Ramallah. Irafaiya had a terrorist background and had spent time in an Israeli prison before the attack. He and his family are affiliated with Hamas. Irafaiya admitted to raping and murdering Ori, saying that \\"I entered Israel with a knife because I wanted to become a martyr and murder a Jew, I met the girl by chance”. Reactions The murder and its gruesome details caused fury among the Israeli public. Rumors circulating that Ori was decapitated by the murderer caused the Israeli police to release an official statement denying such claims. The murder drove the Israeli government to act on the issue of imprisoned Palestinian terrorists receiving monthly stipends from the Palestinian Authority. On , the Israeli security cabinet decided to enforce earlier legislation intended to deduct from money delivered by Israel to the Palestinian Authority the amount the Palestinian Authority pays to imprisoned terrorists, sparking outrage among Palestinian officials. The Jewish community in Gush Etzion planted dozens of trees in Ori's memory, which were later destroyed by Palestinian vandals.

She is the first black woman to be hired by the company and hopes to pave the way for more marginalized comic creators. She is the creator of the hashtag #BlackComicsMonth.  Early life  Tee Franklin was born on February 11. She was introduced to comics by a family member who would regularly babysit her. She continued to read them until she got married and had kids. She got divorced in 2011 and returned to the comic book world, starting out with reviews of comics, and interviews. In 2014, she realized how hard it was to find a comic with someone that looked like her in it or on it, so she took it upon herself to start writing those stories. She regularly speaks out against the lack of representation in comics, and gained the respect of several well- known comic creators, who \\"peer pressured\\" her into creating comics. She is a domestic abuse survivor and has written her miniseries Jook Joint as a therapeutic release. Tee Franklin was in a car accident in 2014 that left her permanently disabled and has been using a mobility aid, and regularly speaks out about accommodating at conventions. She currently resides in New Jersey.  Career  Her first book was Bingo Love, was kickstarted in 2016, raised $57,000, and was published by Image Comics, selling out before it even hit the shelves.

It is a benthic worm that burrows into soft sediment. Taxonomy and habitat The British marine biologist Edgar Johnson Allen first described this worm in 1904, giving it the name Poecilochaetus serpens. It was originally found buried in the sand of a beach near Plymouth, England at extreme low water of a spring tide; the shore here consists of patches of Zostera seagrass separated by patches of bare sand, and the worm was only ever found in the bare sand areas, nor was it ever found in other habitats near Plymouth. The specific name was chosen because when they were swimming, both the worm and its planktonic larva were continually wriggling. Description This segmented worm is long and slender. For example, a worm with 110 segments was in length and in width, exclusive of appendages. The prostomium (head) has a single tentacle ventrally. Behind the head are two long palps which can be extended forward, or coiled loosely, and which may be half the length of the body. The peristomium (first segment) bears the mouth and four simple eyes, and it and the next five segments are large, with parapodia (branched outgrowths) and smooth chaetae (bristles) projecting forward, and cirri (thread-like structures) projecting backwards. The next seven segments have spiny chaetae, and the remainder of the segments from segment 17 onwards bear chaetae that are large, feather-like bristles. The first 15 segments of this worm are translucent but appear bright red or purplish-red, depending on the degree of oxygenation of the blood; the remaining segments appear dark green or black, because of pigments in the gut cells. Ecology Poecilochaetus serpens forms a U–shaped burrow in sand, the tube being lined by particles of clay or mud cemented with mucus; digging is performed by the head using the parapodial cirri attached to the first segment and associated long bristles. A water current is drawn through the tube by undulations of the body and fan- like movements of the parapodia and bristles. The worm can turn around in its tube, and then the current direction is reversed. The worm probably feeds on plankton and organic particles removed from the water current, and diatoms have been found in its gut.

The series is inspired by recent research on memory that mirrors my daily experience. I find that the processes of painting and transferring parallel the processes of memory making and recall. Painting and transfers are like lossy filters that selectively and randomly keep information and also selectively and randomly lose information.

Originally written in 1917, the work was not translated into English until 2016 by Ian Seed. It is a short collection of \\"chapters\\" chronicling Reverdy's, who is the Thief of Talant, disillusionment with France and the isolation he felt as a poet in the one city where he believed poetry could flourish. Additionally, in many parts of the novel there are brief moments characterizing Reverdy's professional relationships with unnamed characters with whom Reverdy was associated during his time in Paris. Ultimately, The Thief of Talant follows Reverdy through a dream-like novel concluding with his spiritual death and rebirth.  Plot summary  The narrative of The Thief of Talant is not so much a narrative, but a poetic autobiography. As such, the novel does not have a series of concrete plot points but rather details a descent into despair and isolation where Reverdy, as the main character (the Thief of Talant) finds that his time in Paris has ultimately killed his past, more lively self. The Thief of Talant begins with the reflections of a character who will later be known as the Thief of Talant waiting at a train station in his home town of Narbonne for Paris. When he arrives in Paris, the Thief encounters a man who offers to help him and get him an apartment. The narrative jumps forward three months later with the man, known now as Abel the Magus, coming to check in on how the Thief is settling in Paris. The Thief then reflects on the necessity of poets in elucidating the mysteries of life to the man. Then he goes to a café with two unnamed characters, noting that the people in crowded Parisian streets are no more than a collective of unthinking animals. He waits until nightfall and then walks alone on the streets, a common choice the Thief makes throughout the novel. The next day he goes to visit Abel the Magus in his own apartment and he describes how easily a writer's work can be stolen and Abel is quite paranoid of this happening to him. Abel the Magus distrusts the Thief of Talant who then antagonizes Abel by satirizing his fears, calling them unfounded. This point marks the transition between the young man who first came to Paris, and the deterioration of that spiritual being in the next half of the novel. The Thief takes to the streets again and now more clearly realizes that Paris cares little for ambitious poets as all they do is laugh at him and point out the foreign nature of his accent, ostracizing him. Thus, the Thief thinks back to how he was when he first came to Paris and that his past self is likened to a trace of footsteps that he can no longer be followed back. While not completely broken, at this point in the narrative, the Thief accepts that he is changing and that he is definitively isolated within the loud and crowded confines of a city that he thought would accept him. The narrative then rapidly derails as he finds himself wandering more and more at night, believing that he is caught in a sinister dream and referring now only to his past self as \\"The Other.\\" This point of the narrative shifts drastically and the Thief describes The Other quite morbidly as lying dead under a tree, trying to come to terms with the new parts of his disconsolate self. Further, Abel the Magus—the Thief's tentative friend and mentor—becomes consumed with paranoia of others stealing his works and all his friends no longer associate with him. At this point, the Thief explicitly acknowledges that the body and spirit of the young man who first came to Paris is no longer present. He then laments on how he came to Paris to express himself but has forgotten what he wanted to say in the first place. Believing that he too has pushed away his friends by becoming so crest-fallen, the Thief submits to his utter solitude and depression. The Thief of Talant somberly concludes with the Thief accepting the death of his naivete and creative innocence.  Structure  Reverdy's novel is written as an experiment in the relationship of the text on a page and the space it fills. For most of the novel Reverdy chooses to write in very erratic patterns. The Thief of Talant is written in a dream-like stream of consciousness which blurs distinctions between characters in the novel. Despite Reverdy's cubist influences, he resented being called a cubist poet and did not want to be labeled. According to Alex Davis, however, author of A History of Modernist Poetry, Reverdy's poetic narrative follows the very subject centered, anecdotal nature of the literary time period (which is an overlap of Cubism, Existentialism, and Surrealism). The \\"chapters\\" consist of a series of verses in erratic form followed by a single page of bold text in one stanza in which Reverdy reflects on the thoughts of the previous verses. One of the influences on the imagery and structure of Le Voleur de Talan is an associate Reverdy would often meet in Parisian cafes to discuss poetic form: Guillaume Apollinaire. Both individuals are considered precursors of the surrealist movement, and Reverdy in particular wrote Le Voleur de Talan as a pioneer work in creating \\"a pure spirit\\" of creative energy by manipulating poetic form.  Main characters   The Thief of Talant  The protagonist of this poetic novel, The Thief of Talant, is Reverdy himself attempting to find solidarity in what he perceives to be the accepting Parisian poetic scene before he learns otherwise.  Abel the Magus  A satirical representation of Max Jacob, a friend and mentor of Reverdy, he houses the Thief of Talant but develops a mistrust for him later in the novel out of fear that he will steal his poetic work.  Reception  The poetic novel was not initially well received when it was published in France in 1917 as readers found the experimental structure and narrative difficult to follow. After the Armistice of 1918 it became moderately more popular, but still not very much so. Reverdy received an offer in 1924 for his work to be republished but he declined stating that he felt his work was \\"too clumsy\\". The book was only recently republished in 2016 by Wakefield Press and has since been better received: The Three Percent and Poetry Salzburg Review both praise The Thief of Talant as a strong translation of a complex novel.

When it was launched on the first of March, 1898, it was the flagship of the Intercolonial Railway (ICR) between Halifax, Nova Scotia and Montreal, Quebec. The train was operated by the Canadian National Railway (CNR) from 1919 until 1964, when it was reduced to a regional service and its name retired.  Construction of the Intercolonial Railway  The call for a railway to link Canada’s Maritime Provinces with the colonies of Upper Canada and Lower Canada (after 1840, the Province of Canada), gained momentum by the mid-1830s. In 1835, editor Joseph Howe, a future Nova Scotia premier, wrote in the Novascotian that railway construction would greatly enhance trade within the province.Seton, L.A. (1958, March).

Retrieved from https://www.exporail.org/can_rail/Canadian%20Rail_no087_1958.pdf In April, 1846, the Lieutenant Governor of Nova Scotia, Sir Colin Campbell, wrote to William Gladstone, Britain’s Secretary of State for Colonial Affairs, calling for a survey of a route for a rail connection linking Halifax with Montreal. In June of that year, Captain John Pipon and Lieutenant E. Wallcott Henderson of the Royal Corps of Engineers were ordered to conduct a survey to identify the optimal route. Pipon would die in the attempt, drowned in New Brunswick’s Restigouche River in November, 1846, to be replaced by Major William Robinson.Underwood, J. (2005). Built for war: Canada’s Intercolonial Railway. Pickering ON: Railfare It was Robinson’s 1849 report to the legislatures of Canada, New Brunswick and Nova Scotia that would largely define the route of the interprovincial railway. He identified four advantages of a rail line that would traverse northern New Brunswick, close to the shores of the Bay of Chaleur: opening the region to settlement, reduced elevations, lower cost and the military advantage of distance from the United States border.Underwood, Ibid Construction of what was to become to become the Intercolonial’s main line began in the mid-1850s, with the first trains operating on the Nova Scotia Railway between Halifax and Truro in 1858.

(2015): Railway history, at The Canadian Encyclopedia, accessed September 3, 2019. dated March 4, 2015  Passenger service on the Intercolonial Railway  There was no formal “last spike” commemoration when the last section of the ICR’s line between Quebec and Halifax was completed on 1 July, 1876.Intercolonial Railway-1876 (2001). Canadian Rail (483), pp. 111-129. Work had been completed in sections, with passenger and freight service offered as important communities were linked. Construction crews completed the difficult task of traversing Nova Scotia’s Cobequid Mountains in 1872Underwood., J. (2010). A line through the hills: How the Intercolonial Railway crossed Nova Scotia’s Cobequid Mountains. Halifax: Pennydreadful. and the first passenger train from Halifax reached Saint John, New Brunswick on 11 November that year. (Although, not without incident, the train having been delayed three hours by a derailed ballast train.)Smith, D.N.W. (2004). The Ocean Limited: A centennial tribute. Ottawa: Trackside Canada. Two years later, the first trains ran between Mont-Joli, Quebec and Campbellton, New Brunswick. The first through passenger trains to link Montreal and Halifax departed on 3 July 1876, using Intercolonial tracks between Halifax and Rivière-du-Loup, Quebec, and tracks of the Grand Trunk Railway (GTR) to Montreal. The trains took almost a day and a half to reach their destinations. The westbound train, called the Quebec Express, was scheduled to leave Halifax at 7:10 p.m., arriving in Montreal two days later at 6:30 a.m.; the eastbound Saint John & Halifax Express left Montreal at 10:00 p.m., arriving in Halifax at 8:25 a.m. The trains carried Pullman Company first class cars, the first sleeping cars to operate in eastern Canada.Smith, D.N.W. (2004). The Ocean Limited: A centennial tribute. Ottawa: Trackside Canada. (Pullman’s presence in Atlantic Canada was short-lived. Demand for sleeping car space fell short of projections, averaging six beds per trip over the first two years. ICR ended its Pullman contract, taking over sleeping car operations, in 1885.)Smith, D.N.W. (2004). The Ocean Limited: A centennial tribute. Ottawa: Trackside Canada. The schedules’ 36-hour running time required coach passengers to change trains at Point Levi, Quebec; sleeping cars were added to connecting regional trains. The trains originated and terminated at GTR’s Bonaventure Station in Montreal and North Street Station in Halifax.Starting in August, 1877. Before that, Halifax trains stopped at the station built in 1854 by the Nova Scotia Railway at Richmond. Smith, Ibid.  Inauguration of the Maritime Express  By the dawn of the 1890s, the ICR recognized the need for improved service on its Halifax-Montreal route. Beginning in 1889, the Canadian Pacific Railway (CPR) had become a direct competitor, operating its Eastern Express and Western Express trains out of Montreal’s Windsor Station via Sherbrooke, Quebec and Saint John to Halifax. Most vexing for ICR managers, the federal government had granted running rights to the CPR over ICR rails from Saint John to Halifax. By virtue of its shorter route, the CPR was able to complete the trip in three hours less than the Intercolonial trains. ICR responded by petitioning the government to extend its own tracks to Montreal through the purchase of a regional Quebec line, eliminating the need to change trains in Point-Levi. The railway also secured permission to purchase more powerful locomotives and new modern cars.Smith, Ibid. On 1 March, 1898, the Intercolonial launched a faster schedule, rebranding its flagship trains as the Maritime Express. The eastbound train left Montreal at 7:30 p.m., arriving in Halifax the next day at 9:40 p.m.; westbound, the train departed Halifax at 1:30 p.m. and pulled into Bonaventure station the following day at 5:35 p.m. The trains featured first-class dining cars and sleepers built by the Wagner Palace Car Company. The sleepers featured 10 open sections and two drawing rooms, “finished in polished mahogany beautifully inlaid with lighter woods [with] ceilings of green and gold, in the Empire style, and the upholstering…of a rich green plush.”Smith, Ibid. In 1900, the ICR revised the schedule of the eastbound Maritime Express to depart Montreal at 11:30 a.m., arriving in Halifax a day later at 3:30 p.m. This allowed for an early evening arrival at Point-Levi, providing a more convenient ferry connection for passengers crossing the St. Lawrence River to Quebec City. On the whole, the train proved to be popular with travellers, with a 45% increase in sleeping car revenues and a 260% jump in dining car revenues in its first year of operation. Smith, Ibid.  Expansion  Postcard image of the Maritime Express in the Wentworth Valley, circa 1903. Between 1900 and the outbreak of World War I in 1914, ICR invested heavily in improvements to its rolling stock, motive power and infrastructure. It ordered new passenger cars, installed upgraded tracks and bridges to carry heavier trains, and constructed impressive new stations in communities along the line. In 1912 the railway undertook a massive project to construct a new terminus in the south end of Halifax, connecting it to the main line by blasting through miles of solid bedrock. The project would prove to be prescient when North Street Station and much of the railway’s waterfront infrastructure was wrecked by the Halifax Explosion in 1917. The Maritime Express moved to a new “temporary” south end station on 22 December, 1918 and to the new Halifax Station in 1928.Underwood, J. (2005). Built for war: Canada’s Intercolonial Railway. Pickering ON: Railfare The Maritime Express continued to build patronage through its first 12 years. Heavy traffic often required the addition of a second following section; in 1906 Christmas travel volumes forced the addition of a third section on part of the route. In 1904, the railway began to replace its older, lighter engines, mostly 4-6-0 “Ten-wheeler” types, with faster and more powerful 4-6-2 “Pacifics” built by Kingston Locomotive Works and Montreal Locomotive Works (MLW).Smith, D.N.W. (2004). The Ocean Limited: A centennial tribute. Ottawa: Trackside Canada. Travellers were enchanted by the bucolic Maritime scenery as the train skirted the Bay of Chaleur, crossed the Tantramar Marshes between New Brunswick and Nova Scotia and crested the Cobequid Mountains. Journalist (and future Nova Scotia premier) William Stevens Fielding wrote in 1872 that the view of Nova Scotia’s Wentworth Valley from the train was “a scene of grandeur and beauty unequalled by any other. (…) It seemed as though the mountain were a monarch clothed in the loveliest raiment, sitting there to protect the smiling and fruitful valley. No wonder the ladies ceased their gossip, the card players threw aside their cards, and singers forgot their songs. All gazed with admiration on the beautiful scene spread out before them.\\"Underwood, J. (n.d.). A train runs through it. Saltscapes. Retrieved from http://www.saltscapes.com/roots-folks/628-a-train- runs-through-it.html The success of the Maritime Express led in 1904 to the introduction of a second Montreal-Halifax train on the route. ICR inaugurated the Ocean Limited on 3 July, 1904, calling it “the finest passenger service…it has ever had.” Smith, D.N.W. (2004). The Ocean Limited: A centennial tribute. Ottawa: Trackside Canada. Begun as a seasonal summer service, it was expanded to a year-round operation in 1912, becoming a full running mate to the Maritime Express. Like other trains bestowed with the name “Limited”, the Ocean Limited made fewer stops than the older train. Its popularity was such that the Maritime Express had added so many stops along its route that “the name ‘Express’ began to lose all meaning.”Underwood, J. (2004). The creation of a legend. Canadian Rail (500), p. 92. In the summer of 1909, the journey of the Maritime Express from Montreal to Halifax took 28 hours and 15 minutes, compared to 24 hours and 35 minutes for the Ocean Limited. Smith, D.N.W. (2004). The Ocean Limited: A centennial tribute. Ottawa: Trackside Canada. The Maritime Express operated on a six-day per week schedule for much of its history, originally eschewing Sunday departures in deference to Maritime sensibilities about travel on the Sabbath. In Quebec, where attitudes were apparently more liberal, the train operated daily between Montreal and Mont Joli for many years. With the inauguration of daily service on a year-round Ocean, the Maritime Express would maintain a Monday-Saturday schedule. Traffic volumes continued to grow on both trains to the extent that a third daily- except-Sunday train was added to the schedule in 1927, the all-sleeping car Acadian; however, the train was short-lived, an early casualty of the Great Depression in late 1929.Smith, Ibid. The train on the bill In 1912, the Dominion of Canada issued its first five dollar banknote, featuring an engraving of a steam-powered passenger train. The image on the face of the bill is of the Maritime Express traversing Nova Scotia’s Wentworth Valley. The picture closely follows an original publicity photo, shot by an unknown photographer for the ICR, circa 1903. Some later sources identify the train pictured as the Ocean LimitedCanada Currency (n.d.). Dominion of Canada May 1st 1912 Five Dollar Bill.

Among other evidence, the same image appears on postcards produced in the first decade of the century that clearly identify the train as the Maritime Express. The locomotive in the photograph is a smaller 4-6-0 type that had been largely replaced by bigger motive power at the time the Ocean Limited was introduced. Over 11 million of the banknotes were produced and they remained in circulation until the early 1930s. Smith, D.N.W. (2004). The Ocean Limited: A centennial tribute. Ottawa: Trackside Canada.Underwood, J. (2010). History follows the Ocean to the ocean. Canadian Rail (536), pp. 95-106. Later years In 1915, as World War I deepened, the federal government moved to consolidate its railway holdings, including the ICR and the Moncton-Winnipeg National Transcontinental Railway, under the umbrella of the Canadian Government Railways (CGR). Despite this, the ICR continued to largely maintain its own brand, including the use of its “IRC” reporting marks and its slogan, “The People’s Railway”. The ongoing financial crisis began to impact other struggling lines and in 1918 the government created Canadian National Railways to take over operations of the CGR and the Canadian Northern Railway, followed by the Grand Trunk Pacific Railway and its parent, the Grand Trunk.Underwood, J. (2005). Built for war: Canada’s Intercolonial Railway. Pickering ON: Railfare CNR continued to operate the Maritime Express and the Ocean Limited, outfitting the trains with new power in the form of 4-8-2 Mountain-type locomotives and, later, powerful 4-8-4 “Northerns”. During the depths of the Depression, the Ocean Limited lost much of its lustre, becoming as much of a plodding local as its older running mate. Consideration was given briefly to discontinuing the Maritime Express during the economic downturn but the option was rejected.Smith, D.N.W. (2004). The Ocean Limited: A centennial tribute. Ottawa: Trackside Canada. With the outbreak of World War II, traffic on CNR’s lines to the Atlantic coast soared, resulting in massive improvements to infrastructure and an expansion of passenger service. The trains frequently operated in multiple sections and in 1941 the railway introduced a third daily train, the Scotian, and converted the Ocean to a sleeping-car only train. Wartime traffic continued to stretch capacity to the limit, resulting in the replacement of full dining cars on the Maritime Express with café cars in 1942. The running time for the Maritime Express was extended to almost 31 hours in 1943. That year, the train moved to the long-awaited new Montreal Central Station. Smith, Ibid. With the end of World War II and the decline in military traffic, ridership on the Maritime Express and its two running mates began to erode. Revenue losses grew, although there were a few bright spots: the Maritime Express continued to show a profit on its Campbellton-Riviere-du- Loup route segment in 1949. The loss of passengers was compounded by the introduction of the first rudimentary interprovincial bus service and expanded air service by Trans-Canada Air Lines. In an effort to arrest the trend, in 1952-53 CNR ordered 359 new passenger cars to replace war-weary rolling stock, including sleepers with more private rooms. In March, 1950, diesel power appeared on the Maritime Express for the first time in the form of a three- unit General Motors EMD FP7 demonstrator; however, the Maritime Express was the last of the three trains to fully convert to diesel power in 1958, mostly in favour of MLW FPA-2 models.Smith, Ibid. Discontinuance In 1955, the Maritime Express lost its status as the railroad’s premiere train, giving up the numbers 1 and 2 to the Ocean, which it shared with the newly-inaugurated Vancouver-Toronto/Montreal Super Continental. Following the recommendations of a parliamentary committee established to examine the future of Maritime passenger services, the schedule of the Maritime Express was reduced in 1957 to less than 26 hours eastbound and just over 23 hours westbound, improving connections with the Yarmouth-Halifax train to boost express fish shipments. The new schedule had the train leaving Halifax at 3:10 p.m., changed from 7:45 p.m. Despite the changes, ridership on the train continued to decline, resulting in the removal of sleeping, cafeteria and parlour cars from its consist over parts of the route. On 28 October, 1961, the Maritime Express was cut back to Moncton, no longer travelling between the New Brunswick city and Halifax. The schedule also added a layover of more than five hours in Campbellton. For most of the year, the train carried mostly mail and express cars along with a few coaches.Smith, Ibid. Efforts by CNR to boost ridership with its innovative “red, white and blue” fare structure and other improvements in the early 1960s failed to produce positive results for the Maritime Express and on 27 October, 1963, the train became a daylight-only train between Montreal and Campbellton. Less than six months later, on 26 April, CNR removed the Maritime Express name from the train.A nameless train carrying the Maritime Express’ final numbers – 3 and 4 – would continue to run between Montreal and Campbellton until 1966. Smith, Ibid. Accidents * The Maritime Express operated without a major accident from its inception in 1898 until 5 October, 1909, when the engineer and express handler died after their train collided with a freight train near Campbellton, New Brunswick. The engineer of the freight train was also killed. An inquest blamed improper timekeeping for the freight train’s failure to clear the line in time. * On 10 July, 1912, the train derailed at Grand Lake, 23 miles from its destination in Halifax. The engineer and fireman died when their locomotive rolled down an embankment into the lake. A kinked rail was blamed for the mishap, which also killed a hobo riding in a baggage car. * The Ocean Limited was in the siding at Thomson Station, Nova Scotia, on 31 March, 1927, when the Maritime Express, travelling at speed on the main line, went through an open switch and collided with the train. The Ocean’s fireman was killed in the crash. * The last major incident involving the train occurred on 6 July, 1943, at the height of heavy World War II traffic. The westbound Maritime Express, with 15 cars, collided with a 42-car freight train on the bridge spanning the Montmagny River in Quebec. The investigation found that the passenger train’s engineer had seen the approaching freight in time to nearly stop his train, but the engineer of the freight train inexplicably applied his brakes only moments before impact. He died in the wreck. Smith, Ibid.

Kohut is a former president of the American Association for Public Opinion Research and the National Council on Public Polls. The book consists of 91,000 interviews that were conducted in 50 countries and collected by the Pew Foundation and other organizations. They find that Americans are unique and the differences of viewpoint between Americans and others on a range of topics, including happiness, religious conviction and individualism, are striking. The authors said they believed anti-Americanism usually concerns US government policies, and the world had always \\"held Americans in higher esteem than America\\". But today, non-Americans are \\"increasingly equating the US people with the US government\\". They also said they believe Americans have a different reaction to people of other nationalities in the 21st century after liberal and democratic values became important in US politics in the nineteenth century. The most significant differences between Americans and others were the ability to shape their own lives and to solve social problems by using government action. As a result, Americans have less trust in organizations like the United Nations. Kohut and Stokes relied on a contemporary assessment of Alexis de Tocqueville's ambivalent conclusion about American exceptionalism. Content America Against the World investigates the influence of the presidency of George W. Bush in American society. In the authors' opinion, Bush is not the only person to blame for the world's poor view of the United States. According to the book, anti-Americanism is caused by the US's actions in South and Latin America, America sponsored actions in Guatemala, US participation in events in Iran in 1953 and the revolution of 1979, American support for oppression during the cold war. Andrew Kohut and Bruce Stokes wrote that anti-Americanism had a resurgence during the George W. Bush presidency. They wrote about international anger towards Americans by sourcing interviews conducted in 50 countries collected by the Pew Foundation and other organizations. US action against terrorism makes up a part of anti-American sentiment in other countries. Kohut's Pew Research Center polls show international opinion of the United States dropped under the Bush-junior presidency; this was not from the 2001 September 11 attacks but since he won the presidency. According to the book, anti-Americanism focuses on US government policies. According to the polls, \\"the American people, as opposed to some of their leaders, seek no converts to their ideology\\" and 60 percent of Americans consider their culture \\"superior to others\\". The Importance of America's relationship with other nations and their reactions to global events mean they are unwilling for multinational efforts and institutions, and compared with other countries' citizens they pay less attention to them. Kohut and Stokes write that Americans are self-involved, that George W. Bush reflected the real America for others, and that changing these conditions needs a change of leaders and peoples' thoughts. \\"Americans think of themselves as kings and queens of the world's prom\\", the writers said. According to the book, American security depends on its further moral growth; \\"American greatness\\" does not need to have militaristic connotations, instead it needs exceptionalism worth aspiring to. Reception Juliana Geran Pilon noted that the authors presented the results of the surveys conducted by the Pew Center over the course of a decade. This was backed up by Geran Pilon who believed the book was well- documented as it showed the growth of the US isolation depth through analytics and reporting. He also said that the book presented data results and reality close together that it makes the study particularly valuable. He remarked that the results on the polling of 38,000 people who are from 44 countries are exceptional. Pilon commented that, 'Kohut and Stokes mentioned \\"the United States\\" refers not only to American policies but to the American people altogether.' Another book review was written by Walter Russell Mead. He wrote that Kohit and Stokes create enduring problems as long as the most individualistic people are against the majority of the American population. He believed that most Americans tend to be more effective that most people with their ability to shape their own lives as well as acceptance to use government action in solving world problems. Walter also wrote how Kohut and Stokes made an understandable data center for their book. It was also noted that the results of their global surveys make their book interesting.

The battle ended in an English victory; many ships were captured and a vast haul of booty was acquired which included 8,000–9,000 tuns of wine.Goodman p. 126 Background In October 1386, Richard II’s so-called Wonderful Parliament approved a commission which began gathering men and ships for a descent (amphibious assault) on Flanders. This was aimed at provoking an insurrection that would replace the government of Philip the Bold with a pro-English regime. It was also hoped this would dispel any French invasion attempt on England. On 10 December, Richard, Earl of Arundel, a member of the commission, was appointed admiral; a week later, the earl indented with the Crown to serve with 2,500 men for three months beginning on 1 March 1387. On 16 March, Arundel arrived at Sandwich, where he took command of a fleet of sixty ships. Intending to invade England, the French and Castilians had gathered an army of thirty thousand men and a fleet of twelve hundred vessels at Sluis (Sluys) in the previous autumn. Philip the Bold, who was the driving force in Charles VI's minority government, suddenly fell ill and so the expedition was cancelled and the fleet dispersed. Many ships of the fleet however were still maintained and put to use in convoys for trading ships. Battle On 24 March 1387 Arundel's fleet sighted part of a French fleet of around 250–360 vessels commanded by Sir Jean de Bucq. This fleet included contingents of Flemish and Castilian vessels, many of which were also carrying wine from La Rochelle to Sluis. Although significantly larger than Arundel's flotilla, De Bucq's fleet was inferior in both manpower and armaments, having an inadequate complement of soldiers to defend it from the English attack. As the English attacked, a number of Flemish vessels deserted the fleet and from there a series of battles commenced from Margate into the channel towards the Flemish coast. The first engagement, off Margate itself, was the largest action and forced the allied fleet to flee with the loss of many ships. The battle took place mostly in the Southern North Sea, while the two fleets were on the move, and Cadzand where the Franco-Castilian-Flemish fleet was finally defeated by the English.Stanton p. 260 More French and Castilian ships were sunk or captured. Arundel pursued the remnants of the fleet to Sluis where he arrived two days later. He penetrated into the outer anchorage and captured seven more ships with another eleven more burnt or sunk in the harbour. The English set up a blockade which lasted more than two weeks; they stopped and seized incoming vessels. However instead of holding the port, which was virtually undefended, the earl put landing parties ashore to burn and plunder coastal villages and seize rich prisoners for ransom. More booty was captured, but the Flemish uprising never materialised. On 14 April, with supplies running low and his men falling ill, Arundel returned to England. In total over a dozen ships were sunk or burned, and sixty eight ships captured including three heavily laden Castilian carracks. De Bucq was captured and promptly sent to the Tower of London. Aftermath After refitting, the earl sailed to Brittany, where he resupplied the besieged garrison at Brest, but failed to effect a reconciliation with John IV, Duke of Brittany. Arundel had won a major victory, and ended the threat of a French and Castilian invasion for the next decade and damaged their naval capabilities.

Roark held this position following the death of her husband, Ruric Nevel Roark, in 1909. Roark led the university at a time when women did not have the right to vote in state or federal elections. Roark was involved in the Suffrage Movement for Equal Rights and was elected Secretary of the Kentucky Equal Rights Association in 1898. Her stances included better teacher training and salaries, she also helped gain the right to vote in school elections. Roark died in Baltimore, Maryland on February 1, 1922 and is buried in Richmond, Kentucky at the Richmond Cemetery.  Education  Roark attended Nebraska University, Oberlin College, and the National Normal University to obtain her Bachelor's of Science and Art and then her teaching certification from the National Normal University located in Lebanon, Ohio.  Educational Leadership  She taught for four years at the National Normal University before she married a former student, Ruric Nevel Roark, on July 31, 1881. They then moved to Glasgow, Kentucky where they served as principal and vice- principal at the Normal School in Glasgow from 1885 until 1889.  Political Office and Clubwork  They moved to Lexington, Kentucky where Ruric N. Roark was the new dean of the Normal School Department at the Kentucky State College (now University of Kentucky). They lived very near campus on South Limestone Street, and in 1895 she won a seat on the Lexington School Board for her ward in the first year that Lexington women could vote for that office. She started the Lexington chapter of the prestigious Sorosis woman's club, serving as its president for as long as she lived there. She was also a charter member of the Woman's Club of Central Kentucky founded in 1894. She was elected corresponding secretary for the Kentucky Equal Rights Association (KERA) in 1898, and continued there in various posts until 1911. She was elected chair of the Education Committee of the Kentucky Federation of Women's Clubs in 1902. In 1903 she chaired the committee that organized the Woman's Council for the Lexington Chautauqua program that summer.  Eastern Kentucky University  In 1906 Ruric N. Roark was appointed as the first president of Eastern Kentucky Normal School, now known as Eastern Kentucky University. When he was diagnosed with brain cancer in April 1909, his wife Mary was then appointed as the first female president of the university until John Grant Crabbe, the Kentucky superintendent of public education at the time, took her position in March 1910. Crabbe was succeeded by Thomas Jackson Coates. Roark signed the diplomas of the first ever graduating class of EKU in 1909. After passing the torch of president, Mary became the Dean of Women at EKU and served until 1915, leaving due to health concerns. Enrollment at EKU increased 25% during Roark's tenure as she helped Appalachian students attend the college and established the all-female residence hall.

Her works were featured in various international shows, among them the first Exposición Anual de Pintura, Dibujo y Escultura (Annual Exhibition of Painting, Drawing, and Sculpture) for artists of South America in 1893. Critical response to her works has often focused attention on her portraits of her grandfather, Domingo Faustino Sarmiento, who was president of Argentina from 1868-1874. Eugenia completed many other works as well, including miniatures as well as full size portraits, paintings of flowers, birds, and still lives, and sculptures. Early years Eugenia Belin Sarmiento was born in 1860, one of six children of Jules Belín and . Jules Belín (1829-1863) was a French printer and publisher of the Santiago, Chile newspaper El Ferrocarril. Belin met Domingo Faustino Sarmiento in France in 1848 and moved to Chile, where he published works written by Sarmiento, who was an Argentinian exile in Chile. Domingo Faustino Sarmiento went on to be an Argentine politician, writer, and educator, and the president of Argentina from 1868 to 1874. Eugenia's mother, Ana Faustina Sarmiento, was born on July 18, 1832 as a result of a romance between Domingo Faustino Sarmiento (then age 20) and one of his students, María Jesús del Canto (age 17). Sarmiento arranged for Ana Faustina to be cared for by her grandmother, Paula Albarracín de Sarmiento, and recognized her publicly after her marriage to Belin in 1850. Belin died when Eugenia was only three, and Eugenia was educated at home by her mother and other relatives. Eugenia spent time as a student and disciple of her great-aunt, Procesa del Carmen Sarmiento, who was a renowned painter. She was also taught art by her grandmother. She later attended and completed her secondary education at the Escuela Superior de Niñas de San Juan (High School for Girls of San Juan), which her mother directed. When Eugenia's brother Augusto Belín y Sarmiento was appointed the Argentine consul in Antwerp, Eugenia accompanied him to Belgium, and used the trip to be professionally trained by famous art masters of the time. In 1884, she returned to Buenos Aires permanently. Career Portrait of Domingo Faustino Sarmiento by Eugenia Belín Sarmiento, 1900 After returning to Buenos Aires, Belín Sarmiento studied art under José Agujari, a renowned painter who was also the first teacher of her contemporary, artist María Obligado. Eugenia focused primarily on portraits, a number of which depicted her grandfather, Domingo Faustino Sarmiento, an iconic figure. Among them are a smaller portrait taken in 1888, which she used as a basis for a larger work in 1889. The larger version of the portrait was reported to be in the Museo Historico Nacional, and another version in the provincial legislature of Buenos Aires, as of the 50th anniversary of Domingo Faustino Sarmiento's death in 1938. On September 4, 1938, a full-page color reproduction was published in La Prensa (Buenos Aires). The same issue of La Prensa included a photograph of Eugenia and her sister Elena. Another family portrait subject was Sarmiento's adopted son , who died in battle against Paraguay. In addition, she painted classical portraits of notable figures of the time such as Dalmacio Vélez Sarsfield, and José María Estrada. As of 1885, she was contracted by the government of the province of San Juan to paint portraits of Salvador María del Carril, , and Francisco Narciso de Laprida. She also painted portraits of women, with her feminine subjects appearing very similar to the models used by the French painter Charles Joshua Chaplin. Starting in 1893, Belín Sarmiento sent samples of her works to different exhibitions such as those organized by the Progress Club (Club del Progreso) and at the Second Athenaeum Auditorium. She frequently exhibited works alongside contemporaries such as Julia Wernicke and Maria Obligado, and won her honorable mention awards in 1894, 1895, and 1898, along with a prize in the 1910 in Buenos Aires. In 1912, she was the first artist from San Juan to participate in the Salón Nacional (National Salon of Visual Arts) of Argentina. Throughout the history of the National Salon, only five women have received a grand prize for painting. During the 1940s, Julia Ottolenghi cataloged the extant works of Belín Sarmiento, many of which are privately owned and difficult to locate today. Argentinean artist Eugenia Belin Sarmiento in her studio Her works can be found at exhibitions in Argentina at the of Fine Arts and in the Sarmiento historic museum of Buenos Aires, Museo Marc de Rosario, Museo Casa Natal de Sarmiento, and abroad in museums such as the Musée Rodin in Paris. Responses Historically, Belin Sarmiento's merit as a painter has often been defined only in terms of masculine influence on her artistry, such as that of her grandfather Domingo. For example, the art critic Eduardo Schiaffino focused almost exclusively on the artistic influence of Domingo on his granddaughter over the fact that Eugenia had been a student of her aunt Procesa Sarmiento, who was a notable painter in her own right. More recently, scholars have begun to revisit Belin Sarmiento's works from a modern, feminist viewpoint. In 1988, the works of both Eugenia Belin Sarmiento and Procesa del Carmen Sarmiento were included in the exhibition La mujer en la plástica argentina I (Women in the Argentinean Plastic Arts I) in the Malvinas Cultural Center (Centro Cultural Las Malvinas). The exhibition was part of a pioneering effort to uncover the hidden work of over 250 Argentinean female artists, historic and contemporary, in national, regional and private collections. Her works were included in a 2013 exhibit focusing on the feminine influence on Domingo Faustino Sarmiento, Los universos femeninos: Sarmiento agente de transformaciones (The Feminine Universe: Sarmiento as agent of transformation). In 2019, the Sarmiento historic museum hosted a posthumous exhibition titled Por ella misma - Eugenia Belin Sarmiento (By Her Own Hand - Eugenia Belin Sarmiento).

Life and death  Almost nothing is known about Ethernan's life. It has been speculated that he may have been a monk of Iona due to his death being mentioned in the Annals of Ulster. In 669 the Annals of Ulster record the following entry: Itarnan et Corindu apud Pictores defuncti sunt. This has traditionally been translated as \\"Ethernan and Corindu died among the Picts\\". However, Thomas Clancy has analysed the use of the word \\"apud\\" in Hiberno- Latin chronicles and concluded that the correct translation is \\"Ethernan and Corindu were killed by the Picts\\", making Ethernan and Corindu both martyrs. Clancy also writes that Ethernan and Corindu may have been \\"Gaels who died in foreign lands, but neither name is well known in Ireland, and both may rather be Pictish\\". He may have been a monk at the Isle of May monastery rather than Iona, since he is thought to be buried in the monastic cemetery there. Simon Taylor and Gilbert Márkus speculate in Place-Names of Fife that the name recorded in the annal is a Gaelic translation of an original P-Celtic name.  Veneration   Ethernan  Ethernan is traditionally believed to have been buried on the Isle of May, which became the centre of his cult after his death. He was culted in several places in Scotland, such as Kilrenny, Madderty and Aberdeenshire, and a saint of the same name was also culted in Wales. Archaeological evidence suggests that pilgrims came to the Isle of May to pray at his shrine and that a healing cult developed around his shrine. According to the analysis of Katherine Forsyth, the saint's name is inscribed in ogham on the Scoonie Stone in Fife, the Rodney Stone in Morayshire, and possibly the Fordoun Stone in Kincardineshire. In Kilrenny, he was nicknamed Saint Irnie and sometimes erroneously identified with Saint Irenaeus of Lyons. Fishermen used the steeple of \\"Saint Irnie's\\" church as a landmark when at sea, and in Anstruther some people would pray to him when the steeple came into sight.  Conflation with Adrian  At some point during the Middle Ages, Ethernan got conflated with another figure from the Isle of May called Adrian. Adrian was said to have been killed by Viking raiders in 875, and his shrine attracted pilgrims for the next several centuries. While it is possible that a monk called Adrian was killed by Vikings on the island, this cult is most likely a misremembering of Ethernan from a time when the Picts had ceased to function as an ethnic group within Scotland and ancient martyrdoms in Britain and Ireland were commonly attributed to Vikings. In later medieval legends, such as those recorded in the Aberdeen Breviary, Ethernan and Adrian were treated as two entirely separate saints. After the churches of Anstruther Easter and Anstruther Wester merged in the 20th century, the former became known as St Adrian's Parish Church, and the latter became known as St Adrian's Church Hall.

It was constructed in 1918 as a municipal gymnasium, with a curling rink on the ground floor and an ice hockey rink on the second floor. At that time the city of Eveleth was flush with tax revenue from the Mesabi Range mining boom, and the population was heavily male from the influx of mine workers. As the gender balance evened out in the 1930s, the building was converted into a garment factory, answering a need for employment opportunities for women and diversifying the local economy. With The Eveleth Recreation Building was the first modern facility of its type on the Mesabi Range. Eveleth quickly earned a national reputation for its hockey players and teams, including the United States Amateur Hockey Association's Eveleth Reds. In warmer months the recreation building hosted roller skating and public dances. The city constructed a new hockey facility in 1922, and ten years later the Recreation Building was retired as a skating venue. After World War II, Cluett Peabody & Company remodeled the building as a factory for its Arrow brand shirts and underwear. Arrow production ceased locally in 1978 and the next long-term tenant was a furniture manufacturer. As of 2019 the building is being operated as a storage facility for cars and boats. The building was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1980 for its state-level significance in the themes of industry and social history. It was nominated for representing the public support for recreational facilities during the Progressive Era and the later evolution of the Iron Range's economy and population.

Dreams from the Deep End was the resulting painting series and installation, first shown at Gallery 1957 in Accra, Ghana. The Harlem Honeys & Bears is an all black synchronized swim team for senior citizens that meets at the Hansborough Recreation Center in New York City. The team has been in existence since 1979, and as of 2018, had 24 active members with ages ranging from 58 to 95, who met and competed on a regular basis. The painting series based on Fadugba's research with the group, is both personal and tied to identity politics of Black America. Swimming is intertwined with race, and social justice in the US. Research from the CDC shows that drowning among black children is 1.4 times higher than the rate of white children. The rate climbs to a 5.5 times difference when the research considers swimming pool drowning deaths. The disparity is a legacy of segregation in the US, where black communities were denied access to public swimming pools. For the artist, swimming is tied to a childhood fear of the ocean, which she only overcame when she was 11, and was forced to take swimming lessons in school. Dreams from the Deep End depicts the Harlem Honeys & Bears swimmers in and around the swimming pool. In some of the paintings, the figures remain faceless, and the artist tends to use pastel colors, and her signature burnt technique. In others, she shows the faces of the swimmers on which the paintings are based, sometimes using the burning method, sometimes without. The pool water is usually monochromatic: dark blue, black, or gold, making the swimmers stand out starkly from the background.

She is known as the first animalist painter from Argentina, and was unique at the time in incorporating exotic animals into her paintings. She paved the way for female artists in Argentina through many firsts, especially within the discipline of engraving. Wernicke was one of the first women to have an individual exhibition of works in Buenos Aires, in 1897; and the first person to have an individual exhibition of engraved etchings in Argentina, in 1909.  Family  Julia Wernicke was a daughter of respected educator Robert Heinrich (Roberto Enqrique) Wernicke (May 29th, 1826 Kelbra - January 24th, 1881, Buenos Aires), and his wife, Ida Augusta Beltz von Hagen. Both were German immigrants. Roberto arrived in Argentina in 1848. They married in 1851 and had several children. * Roberto Enrique Martín Wernicke (Buenos Aires, May 23rd, 1852 - Buenos Aires, October 22nd, 1922), doctor and bacteriologist * Ana Carlota Wernicke Beltz von Hagen (Buenos Aires, 1858 - Rosario, 1932) * Julia Federica Herminia Wernicke Beltz von Hagen (1860 - 1932), artist. * María Wernicke Beltz von Hagen (1866-?), teacher. * Edmundo Wernicke Beltz von Hagen (1867-?), writer. * Otto Wernicke Beltz von Hagen (1868-?), doctor. Following Augusta's death, Robert married again, with his dead wife’s sister, Federica Guillermina Beltz von Hagen. She became the step-mother of Julia and the other surviving children. Robert and Federica had a son, German Wernicke Beltz von Hagen (1873 - 1941), Julia's half brother. Julia also had a half-sister, Berta Wernicke (1871-1962), a feminist writer and teacher who co-founded the with Elina González Acha de Correa Morales and others.  Career The Lion, 1901 Around 1885, at age 25, Julia Wernicke made her first visit to Europe, and spent four years studying in Munich, Germany with the animal painter Heinrich (Enrique) von Zügel (1850-1941). Zügel was a member of the Barbizon school and taught in the Academy of Fine Arts, Munich. He also taught the Argentinian artist Fernando Fader (1882-1935), German artist August Kaufhold, and U.S. artist Walt Kuhn (1877-1949). Zügel's teaching had a significant impact on Wernicke: throughout her career, she chose to paint exclusively animal paintings, which were considered a strange choice for a woman at that time. Wernicke became known as the first animalist painter from Argentina. She painted animals from the Buenos Aires Zoological Garden, and from her travels to the countryside. Thanks to her friendship with Eduardo Holmberg - the Director of the Zoological Garden - Wernicke could gain access to the gardens and take her easel and paint brushes to paint the \\"exotic\\" animals kept there. Wernicke's representations of lions, tigers, gorillas, and other exotic animals, was unusual. While studies of domestic animals and even their natural deaths were not uncommon for artists in Argentina at the time, the representation of wild animals was exclusively explored by Wernicke. This was also a difference between her and her teacher, who specialized in paintings of the farm animals and the German countryside. Wernicke incorporated her own interests. She has been favorably compared with Rosa Bonheur. Toros or Los Toritos , 1897 Her most recognized work of art of the era was Toros, also known as Los Toritos (Oil Painting on canvas, 55.5 cm by 71cm, 1897). It forms part of the archives at the Museo Nacional de Bellas Artes (Buenos Aires), and was exhibited both nationally and internationally. Wernicke traveled between Argentina and Germany, eventually returning to Europe where she undertook a different course: engraved etching. She lived in Leipzig, Berlin, and Dresden and studied with Gützen, or Gӧtzen. Wernicke and the artist together explored more varied technical methods: etching, woodcut, aquatint, drypoint, and lithography.  Exhibitions Beginning in the 1880s there was \\"an unparalleled influx of paintings and sculptures\\" into Buenos Aires. Although European art tended to be preferred over local artworks, artists and intellectuals organized four collective exhibitions focusing on local artists at the Buenos Aires Salón del Ateneo, or Atheneum, during the 1880s-90s. Women were well-represented in the exhibitions of the Ateneo: in 1894, 27 of 67 exhibitors were female, while in 1896 women artists were in the majority. On October 20 in 1895, at 35 years of age, Julia Wernicke participated in the third exhibition of the Ateneo, which included 180 works from 71 artists (18 of whom were women). On May 21, 1897 La Nación reported that Wernicke planned to hold workshops to give young ladies lessons in painting, drawing and portraiture. She also published her name and address in the 1988 exhibition catalogue, indicating a workshop or professional studio presence. In 1897, Wernicke held a solo exhibition at a space owned by photographer Samuel Boote. It was exceptional for any artist in Buenos Aires to hold a solo exhibition during the first decade of the twentieth century. Wernicke's 1897 exhibition may be the first individual exhibition of works by a woman artist in Buenos Aires. View of the buildings of the Exposición Nacional, 1898 Wernicke's work was shown at the , in the Plaza San Martín, Buenos Aires. The exposition opened on October 16, 1898 and closed on November 20. Taking as a model the Woman's Building at the World's Columbian Exposition in Chicago, 1893, Argentine women created a Sección Feminista (Feminist Section) for the productions of women. With the leadership of Teodelina Alvear de Lezica, fifteen hundred objects were presented to public view in the Feminist Exhibition, including embroidery, lace-making, weaving, furniture, and painting on a variety of media. Including both the fine and applied arts, the event was presented as educational and empowering for Argentine women. Julia Wernicke presented work both in the feminist section and in the professional exhibit of the Ateneo. She received a Silver Medal, 1898-99. Wernicke was one of only two women artists, of those who participated in exhibits at the Ateneo, whose works were included in the collection of the Museo Nacional de Bellas Artes (MNBA). The other woman to be included was her friend Elina Gonzalez Acha. Wernicke's Toros was purchased in 1899 by Eduardo Schiaffino, the MNBA's founder and first director. From its acquisition until the painting was retired to be guarded in the museum’s depository (around 1950), Toros occupied a preeminent place with the other works of art now considered to be of national significance. During the latter 20th century Toros was not displayed in the museum and it was not included in the catalogue raisonné. In December 1899, Julia Wernicke and Arturo Méndez were considered equally qualified in age and artistic merit when considered for a scholarship for landscape painting. Eduardo Schiaffino argued against awarding the scholarship to Julia Wernicke on the grounds that being female made Wernicke necessarily inferior: \\"su diferencia de sexo establece una inferioridad de parte del concurrente femenino.\\" The scholarship went to Méndez. A third contender, Marcelino Barneche, was awarded a similar scholarship later on. Nontheless, Wernicke's work was chosen by Schiaffino as one of those to represent Argentina at the international Saint Louis Exposition of 1904, on loan from the National Museum of Fine Arts. Wernicke was awarded a bronze medal by the Exposition. Other medal-winners in the show included the painter Eduardo Sívori (1847-1918) and the sculptor (1852-1923).Academia Nacional de Bellas Artes (Argentina): Historia general del arte en la Argentina: fines del siglo XIX y comienzos del siglo XX, volumen 6, pág. 183. Buenos Aires: Academia Nacional de Bellas Artes, 1988. 287 páginas. Consultado el 3 de junio de 2013. Baedekers review of Bulls is generally complimentary but also exposes highly gendered views of women artists, who were expected to be introspective, delicate and subtle. Again in 1909, Wernicke held a solo exhibition, this time at the Galería Witcomb. Wernicke created the first individual exhibit of engraved etchings to be presented in Argentina, in Buenos Aires. However this innovation was not understood by the porteño media. The artist left Argentina and lived for much of the rest of her life in Germany. In 1926, , daugnter of Lucio Correa Morales and Elina González Acha de Correa Morales, went to Germany, where she studied art with Julia Wernicke. Mira Schor notes that their association has been largely ignored and Wernicke has been dropped from accounts of the younger artist's “linaje paterno”. Correa Morales married sculptor Rogelio Yrurtia in 1936, and the Yrurtia Museum in the Belgrano neighborhood became the home of their joint collections. Correa Morales influenced the museum for many years as a painter, donor, and director, and included the works of herself, Julia Wernicke and other women artists in exhibits and in catalogs. Julia Wernicke was the only woman artist to be included in the exhibition A Century of Art in Argentina, at the National Directorate of Fine Arts in 1936. Wernicke's works were also acquired by the Museo Castagnino of Rosario when it opened in 1937 under director Hilarión Hernández Larguía. Works were donated to the new museum by many private and public figures, collectors and artists. Several of Wernicke's works were donated posthumously to the collection by members of her family.  Critical responses  Like other women artists, Wernicke's career has not been deeply studied. She was recognized as an artist in her own time. Museum director Eduardo Schiaffino considered her work good enough to be shown in the National Museum and to be chosen to represent Argentina in international competitions. However, he did not include her or other women in the published first volume of his influential general history of Argentine art, published in 1933. Wernicke and other women were relegated to the draft of his second volume, which was never published. It is also clear that this reflected a bias on his part against women artists, who he considered inferior. , writing of Argentinian artists in 1930, recognized Wernicke as a pioneer, both as a professional artist and as an art teacher. Wernicke was discussed by in El arte de los argentinos (1937). Pagano ranked her as an artist, not an amateur. But even when allowed the possibility of genius, both she and her works were expected to fit a set of highly gendered expectations. In the 1950s and 1960s, praised Wernicke both for the quality of her work, and for doing work that did not fit the expectations of the time for women artists. He laments that she had to battle against disinterest and incomprehension. Wernicke is mentioned in passing in other accounts, and is being critically reassessed by 21st- century academics, who are interested in both her work and the ways in which she and other artists were marginalized by critics, academics and institutions. Georgina Gluzman discusses changing attitudes to women artists in the fin-de-siècle period in Argentina and the ways in which female participation in the arts was connected to ideas of modernity and progress. She also examines the effect that systemic processes of obliteration have had on Wernicke and other Argentine women artists such as Eugenia Belin Sarmiento. Gluzman is curating a 2019 exhibition focusing on works by women artists in the Fine Arts museum's reserve collections, including Wernicke's Toros.

They finished the season 28-8 overall, tied for the ACC regular season title with a 12-2 record and made it to the Elite Eight of the 1983 NCAA Tournament. They were coached by Dean Smith in his twenty-second season as head coach of the Tar Heels. They played their home games at the Carmichael Auditorium in Chapel Hill, North Carolina. Roster Summary Jordan frequently got into foul trouble early in his freshman year at North Carolina (1981-82). He frequently played the ends of games with four fouls. He originally went by “Mike Jordan”, but media began using Michael in the middle of his freshman season at UNC. Late example of “Mike Jordan”: New York Times, UNC vs. St. John’s, first game of 1982-83 season PLAYER PROFILE When Jordan’s shooting touch was off, he would defer to teammates and concentrate more on his defense. Going into the 1982-83 season, UNC lost starting seniors James Worthy and Jimmy Black from the previous season’s national championship team. Sophomore Michael Jordan and junior Sam Perkins missed preseason practices due to injuries, only to return at the start of the regular season. As a result, North Carolina started the season with a record of 0-2 for the first time since 1919. UNC’s record went to 3-3, dropping out of the national rankings, before going on an 18-game winning streak. Conference regular season Taking full advantage of the 19-foot three-point line, newly adopted by the Atlantic Coast Conference and other conferences around the country,(The Washington Post, November 21, 1982, page 98) Jim Braddock made 6 of 7 three-point attempts in the opening game of conference play in an 86-69 romp over Rutgers.Star-News on Google News Archive: January 8, 1983 - 17-year-old freshman Brad Daugherty scored 15 points and grabbed nine rebounds.(Star-News) January 15, 1983 - Lynwood Robinson transferred from UNC to Olive.(Star-News) January 29, 1983 - Michael Jordan scored his college career-high of 39 points against Georgia Tech, shooting 11-16 from the field, 11-13 from the free throw line and 6 of 7 from the three-point stripe including a four-point play that broke a 45-45 tie and gave UNC the lead for good. Aside from Jordan and Perkins, the rest of the Tar Heels shot 3 of 22 from the floor.(Star-News) February 5, 1983 - With its win over Furman, North Carolina runs its record to 20-3, giving UNC head coach Dean Smith his record 12th straight 20-win season (a record he had previously shared with Jerry Tarkanian).(Star-News) February 10, 1983 - #1 UNC won 64-63 over #3 Virginia. Both teams struggled from the field, with UNC shooting a paltry 41%. The Tar Heels managed to claw back from a 16-point second half deficit. Michael Jordan led the way with 16 points and a key steal-and-stuff with four personal fouls on him at the end of the game. Ralph Sampson of Virginia had 15 points and 12 rebounds but also six turnovers. Buzz Peterson suffered a right knee injury and is expected to be out for the season.(Star- News) February 13, 1983 - With a 30-21 rebounding advantage, Villanova (#12, 17-4) snapped UNC’s 18-game winning streak and became only the fourth non-ACC opponent to defeat UNC at Carmichael Auditorium, and the first to do so since 1973. The Tar Heels suffered a three-game losing streak, partly attributable to Michael Jordan’s difficulties with foul trouble. February 27, 1983 - UNC’s record against Clemson at Chapel Hill goes to 30-0 with another victory. March 5, 1983 - In its regular season finale against Duke, UNC pounded the ball hard inside, making 57 percent of its shots from the floor, and 12 of 15 three- point baskets, in what turned into a three-point shootout. Michael Jordan scored 32 points in each game against Duke. March 11, 1983 - UNC was led by Michael Jordan and Matt Doherty (career high 28 points) as the Tar Heels connected on 14 of 24 three-point shots to easily advance 105-79 over Clemson in the ACC Tournament. March 12, 1983 - Michael Jordan fouled out of the close contest with 3:42 remaining in regulation. NC State got a 70-65 lead with 2:57 remaining, but did not score again, and UNC came back to tie it before the buzzer. Dereck Whittenburg carried the scoring load for the Wolfpack in overtime. Sam Perkins led North Carolina with 24 points, and Daugherty had 17 in the surprise loss.

In the work Lifton details the medical procedures occurring before and during the Holocaust and explores the paradoxical theme of healing killing in which one race was healed by eliminating another; a concept that many used to morally justify their actions. Throughout the book, Lifton provides yo from interviews he conducted with SS doctors and with victims. The book was awarded the 1987 Los Angeles Times Book Prize and the 1987 National Jewish Book Award in the Holocaust category.  Synopsis  The Nazi Doctors is composed of three parts. In the first part the book describes in detail the four stages that took place before the Holocaust. Starting with coercive sterilization, proceeding to the killing of children and then adults; medical reasonings were used to justify the actions of Nazi doctors. The progression of the killings began legally with sterilization laws and then turned into illegal actions that were permitted by the government. This time period was referred to as Nazi Germany, in which the Nazi party took over and brainwashed most citizens. The second part of the book begins with the transportation of the victims to the camps, their arrival, life at the camp, and how different members of the camp adjusted and evolved. The ideology driven by Adolf Hitler received so much support from doctors and Nazis that it was possible for them to set up concentration camps in which mass medical killings occurred. One of the largest camps was Auschwitz, a place described as the \\"anus of the world.\\" After the genocide was discovered, and the Holocaust was ended, people were left in disbelief as to how such actions of crime could have undergone and for so long. Part III of the book provides an analysis to the moral conflicts faced by the doctors and faces the reality of the genocide. Lifton explores the behavior individually and collectively of the doctors and discusses how the socialization to killing could have come about.  Reception  The Nazi Doctors has been reviewed by JAMA, The Journal of Psychiatry and Law, and The Journal of Medicine and Philosophy.

He was also in charge of the organization of the G7 Environment 2017, under the Italian Presidency; the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) and the preparation of the National Strategy for Sustainable Development as well as the national dialogue on sustainable finance with the UN Environment. La Camera's appointment came at the end of the ninth Assembly of IRENA, the largest assembly it has ever convened, attended by 120 ministers joined by 1,200 delegates from 150 countries including the Canada that joined the IRENA on the eve of the conference. Upon his selection as the Director-General of the IRENA, the Commissioner for Energy and Climate Action at the European Commission, Miguel Arias Cañete noted, \\"The election of a European candidate for this important organisation demonstrates our leadership in the global world of renewables. I am confident that Mr. La Camera is the right person to lead the International Renewable Energy Agency in the next phase of renewables deployment worldwide\\". The organisation's role is to support the acceleration of renewable energy globally by providing technical expertise, policy support and new data and analysis to national governments. In the European Union, the International Renewable Energy Agency played an important role in the assessment of Europe's cost-competitive potential for renewables in 2030. Upon assuming his new role Francesco La Camera will lead the IRENA Secretariat and the implementation of the Agency's work programme and budget, in areas relating to international cooperation on renewable energy, providing a centre of excellence for knowledge and innovation which supports countries world-wide in their transition to a sustainable energy future. La Camera tweeted his gratitude, writing: \\"Thanks to the IRENA membership for the trust. I am honoured to have been elected DG [director-general]. We will do a great job together\\". Dutch ambassador to the UAE, Frank Mollen said he looked forward to working with the new Director-General. Dominique Ristori, the Director-General for Energy of the European Commission who represented the European Union at IRENA's ninth assembly, offered his full support. La Camera's colleagues at the Italian ministry parastatal, the Italian Institute for Environmental Protection and Research (ISPRA), the President of the National System for Environmental Protection (SNPA), Stefano Laporta and the Director-General, Alessandro Bratti conveyed their felicitations with the goodwill message, \\"Renewables, an essential choice for the future of the planet.\\" At the conference, IRENA and the Abu Dhabi Fund for Development (ADFD) agreed to a $31 million loan facility to finance projects in Guyana, Liberia and Togo. Of this amount, $8 million will go towards the installation of 5.2MW grid-connected solar photovoltaic systems to reduce fossil fuel consumption and increase electricity reliability in Guyana. Another $8 million will go to the construction of a 2.1MW hydropower plant in Liberia and a further $15 million will go to a 30MW solar photovoltaic plant in Togo with capacity to power 700,000 homes. This funding takes the amount invested by IRENA and the ADFD to $245 million since 2013. Two new reports were also published at the Assembly: Renewable Energy: A Gender Perspective, providing a commentary of women participation in the renewables sector, in addition to A New World: The Geopolitics of the Energy Transformation, an exposé on the changing global energy situation due to the renewable energy transformations.

Early life  Sterkenburg was born in the port of Harlingen (Friesland, the Netherlands) in 1955. While still young, he encountered the sea and later remembered how he, as a toddler, had noted the coming and going of the ships in the harbour. His father was a sailor in the Dutch merchant navy. During secondary school he showed a talent for drawing, and after his tour of duty in the Dutch army he decided to turn his passion into his livelihood.Henri van der Zee en Ton van der Werf (2001) Bound to the sea : Peter J. Sterkenburg, a maritime painter(1955-2000). Harlingen: Foundation Peter J. Sterkenburg.  Career  During his career Sterkenburg developed a unique, easily recognizable, romantic painting style. The sea and ships became a thread throughout his life. His seascapes are found in collections all over the world. He participated in exhibitions in the Netherlands, San Francisco, Hong Kong, Singapore, Kuala Lumpur, Jakarta and Sydney. Many of his pieces were special commissions.archive Ton van der Werf His last assignment was a painting commissioned by VFD, a Dutch architectural company responsible for the decoration of the cruise ships of the Holland America Line. This seven meter- long painting, shows 17th century sailing vessels of the Dutch East India Company, the VOC, before Amsterdam.Harlinger courant Friday, January 14, 2004 Sterkenburg was unable to complete this painting as he died on the day before Easter in 2000 at age 44. One year later a foundation was established to promote his work.  Technique  Sterkenburg employed a so-called ‘wet’ painter technique whereby he did not wait for the paint to fully dry. He would first sketch the outlines of a painting in charcoal. He sometimes applied as many as twenty-five thin layers, giving the painting a realistic effect. As a finishing touch, he accentuated the light with a fine brush to suggest more depth. Despite the realism of his paintings, Sterkenburg was not considered to be a genuine ‘fijnschilder’, a painter of ‘delicate subjects’. He had a preference for linen of a rather coarse texture. He was capable of painting the rigging of his ships meticulously on this comparatively rough surface. The ‘rigging’ brush he used for this purpose, made of sable hair, allowed him to apply only a small quantity of paint each time – resulting in short strokes joined together – but this technique cannot be detected in the final result, in which the lines seem to be continuous. This gives the spectator the impression that everything is worked out in detail.Metro (newspaper)May 16, 1996 Kuala Lumpur The faces of the members of a ship's crew are mere spots, a few strokes with a dry brush conjure up the fine-meshed net of a fishing vessel and his fluffy clouds are done with a few coarse strokes. Paintings with historical ships and backgrounds required research. In order to paint as true to life as possible, Sterkenburg frequently consulted his extensive collection of books on historical and maritime matters. He possessed a photographic memory, enabling him to depict a certain ship twice and from completely different angles. In order to depict modern ships correctly he used a camera on-site but only used the details, never directly copying photos. One of his principles was that he could not paint the correct light, sky- and water colour before he had actually visited the places which formed the background in his paintings. This resulted in study trips to ports around the world.Dutch paintings in the Metropolitan Museum of Art By Liedtke, Walter A.

Berg studied under Sigmund Lebert, Immanuel Faisst, and Ludwig Stark, and graduating from the from the Royal School of Music in Stuttgart, she became a teacher of piano and composition. Later, she studied voice culture under Francesco Lamperti, of Milan. Berg's school of music, following the \\"Lamberti method\\", was located at 337 West 59th Street, New York City. Her pupils were trained in operatic and concert singing in multiple languages, as well as in ballad, oratorio, and church singing. The amount of artistic work which she accomplished was notable, as she personally instructed a large number of private pupils, professionals and distinguished amateurs, conducted and lead classes and choruses in her private music school, and was in constant demand at social gatherings. Berg was well versed in philosophy, art, history, poetry, political science and social culture, traveled extensively, and could speak five languages with fluency. She was described as \\"a striking blonde, with a soprano voice\\". Early years and education Lillie P. Berg was born in New York City, 1845. Her father was a German of noble birth, and her mother was a New England woman of English ancestry. Berg passed her childhood in Stuttgart, Germany, where she was trained in piano, organ and harmony by professors Lebert, Faisst, and Stark. She was graduated from the Royal School of Music in Stuttgart (now known as State University of Music and Performing Arts Stuttgart), attending at the same time the Conservatory of Music. Professors Lebert and Stark complimented her by sending to her pupils to prepare in piano and harmony for their classes. While under the direction of Prof. Faisst, the organ teacher, she was organist and choir director of one of the most prominent churches in that city. Her precociousness caused such musical authorities as Julius Benedict and Emma Albani to advise her to devote her attention to her voice, predicting for her a brilliant future. Albani directed her to her own master, Lamperti. Lamperti, soon perceiving the ability of his new pupil, gave her the position of accompanist, which she held for three years, enabling her to note the artistic and vocal training of many of the most famous artists on the operatic and concert stages. Career In the United States, she held the position of the foremost exponent of the Lamperti school and she studied every season with the famous artists and great teachers of Europe. Among these were Teresa Brambilla, Pauline Vaneri Filippi, Karlheinz Stockhausen, Hermine Küchenmeister-Rudersdorf, Mathilde Marchesi, and Enrico Delle Sedie, of Paris, William Shakespeare and Alberto Randegger. She developed a \\"method\\" which was distinctively her own, and she had an extraordinary knowledge of the art of song. She had the friendship of the majority of modern composers of her time, and she aimed to combine modern progressiveness and dramatic interpretation with strict adherence to purity and beauty of tone production. She passed the spring season of each year in London, England. Berg possessed a soprano voice. She was constantly engaged in arranging concerts and classical recitals in and out of New York. She also organized quartets and choruses. In 1880, she was in charge of the Vocal Department, Rye Seminary, particularly voice building after the Italian method. In 1888, returning again from Europe, Berg resumed her lessons in Voice Building and in the Art of Singing, at her residence, 17 East 31st Street, New York City. To Berg belongs, it was believed, the honor of being the first woman musician in the U.S. to conduct with a baton at a public performance. In April, 1891, she conducted Smart's cantata, \\"King Rent's Daughter,\\" before an audience which crowded the new Carnegie Hall, New York. Having been sick for a year, a testimonial benefit concert was held for Berg on February 8, 1893 at the Madison Square Theatre. The concert was the idea of Mrs. Edward Lauterbach and Albert Morris Bagby; seven hundred people were in attendance. In the following month, it was reported that Berg had been dangerously ill, but hoped she would soon be able to resume work, and open a summer school in July. The Musical Courier of October 1895 reported that Berg had just returned from a four months' tour in Norway, Sweden, Russia, Germany and Austria. In 1896, Berg was conducting a summer school for professional singers at Round Lake, New Jersey. Berg died in 1896.

Fernando (born January 19, 1952) is a Professor of Quantitative Genetics in the Department of Animal ScienceDepartment of Animal Science at Iowa State University (ISU), USA. Although recognized for his work in many facets of genetics, Dr. Fernando's efforts have focused primarily on theory and methods for use of genetic markers in breeding, theory and methods for genetic evaluations of crossbred animals, methodology related to the estimation of genetic parameters and the prediction of genetic merit in populations undergoing selection and non-random mating, bayesian methodology for analysis of unbalanced mixed model data, optimization of breeding programs, and use of computer simulation to study dynamics of genetic system.  Early life  Dr. Fernando was born in Sri Lanka in 1952 where he was raised alongside his three brothers. His family owned a land with livestock, such as dairy cows and poultry. This land was away from his home, so he only visited during holidays. Dr. Fernando had a passion for livestock in his younger years, and always considered his family's lifestyle to be a hobby as opposed to a job. His family encouraged him to obtain greater education, but since the public university in Sri Lanka was difficult to get into, they sent him and his three brothers to the United States. Another factor that went into the decision of pursuing education in the United States was Sri Lanka's political landscape at the time.  Education  Dr. Fernando attended junior college from 1972-1975 at Aquinas College in Colombo, Sri Lanka where he graduated with first class honors with a diploma in agriculture. Because he graduated with high distinction, in 1976 Dr. Fernando decided to pursue a Bachelor's degree in agriculture science with an emphasis in animal science from California State University, Fresno. Dr. Fernando graduated from California State University, Fresno with summa cum laude honors in 1978 and decided to pursue his Masters degree in Animal Science at University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign (UIUC) later that year, under the guidance of Dr. Daniel Gianola. Upon his graduation in 1981, Dr. Fernando continued at UIUC for his PhD, which was completed in 1984. At UIUC, Dr. Fernando worked on selection and non-random mating for his thesis research, and had the opportunity to take courses and interact with Dr. Charles R. Henderson, whom was a visiting professor at the time.  Career  After earning his PhD, Dr. Fernando accepted a Research and Teaching Associate position with the Department of Animal Science at UIUC. In 1985, he became Assistant Professor of Biometry and Computer Applications for the same department. After getting tenured and becoming Associate Professor in 1991, Dr. Fernando went on sabbatical leave through the Department of Biometry and Genetics at Louisiana State University Medical Center until 1992. In 1996, he joined Iowa State University as Professor of Quantitative Genetics in the Department of Animal Science.  Scientific contributions  Dr. Fernando's contributions have been presented in over 120 peer-reviewed publications and over 70 invited talks, seminars and courses in more than 16 countries. Some of Dr. Fernando's most significant contributions are described below: * Selection and Non-Random Mating. In 1951, W. Cochran showed that when candidates and the data for each candidate are identically and independently distributed, truncation selection of candidates based on the conditional mean of breeding values maximizes the mean breeding value of the selected candidates. Dr. Fernando's PhD research provided an important extension to this result. When selection is for a constant proportion of candidates, he showed that selection based on the conditional mean maximizes the mean breeding value of the selected candidates without the requirement for candidates and the data to be identically and independently distributed. This has provided powerful justification for developing selection rules based on the conditional mean for genetic improvement in livestock populations, where candidates and data are neither identically nor independently distributed. * Covariance Theory. Since Fisher’s landmark paper in 1918, covariance theory has played an important role in the analysis of genetic data. Dr. Fernando has contributed to extend this theory in several important directions for genetic evaluation and parameter estimation. * Multi-Breed Populations: Dr. Fernando has contributed to developing theory for covariance between relatives in crossbred populations under additive and dominance gene action, providing the basis for genetic evaluation and parameter estimation in crossbred populations. * Marker Information: The usual theory for covariance between relatives provides results conditional on pedigree information and is the same for all loci. Dr. Fernando along with Dr. Mike Grossman provided theory to compute covariance between relatives conditional on pedigree and marker information to give locus specific results. They gave an efficient algorithm to invert the gametic covariance matrix. These results provide the basis for mapping QTL by the variance component approach and for marker-assisted BLUP (MAS-BLUP). This theory, which was originally derived for purebred populations, has been extended for crossbred populations, under additive and dominance gene action. Also, MAS-BLUP was extended to capture information from linkage disequilibrium and co-segregation (or linkage) between markers and QTL in multi-breed populations. * Algorithms to Compute Genetic Probabilities. Computing genotype, allele state, and allele origin probabilities are important for QTL mapping, and MAS. For example, the variance component approach to map QTL requires computing the relationship matrix at the QTL conditional on marker information, and this matrix can be computed efficiently in terms of the conditional allele origin probabilities at the QTL given marker information. Dr. Fernando et al. developed a recursive algorithm to compute genotype probabilities for all members of a pedigree without loops, which also can be used to compute the likelihood of genetic models given pedigree data. This algorithm is currently used in SAGE, which is a package of computer programs widely used in human genetics. Iterative use of this algorithm in pedigrees with loops gives approximate results, and this is the basis for many computer programs for approximate probability computations with large complex pedigrees. He has also investigated other approximations. Recently, Dr. Fernando extended the Elston-Stewart algorithm to compute the exact likelihood and posterior probabilities with multi-locus models for pedigrees with loops. This algorithm was used to map the dwarf gene in Angus cattle. When pedigrees are very large and complex, the Elston-Stewart algorithm becomes computationally infeasible. Thus, he has also contributed to the development of Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) algorithms for QTL mapping and MAS. These were shown to perform better than competing methods, including those in SOLAR and LOKI, which are widely used packages. These algorithms are currently used to compute haplotype and allele origin probabilities with several thousand pedigree members. These probabilities are needed in whole-genome analyses to combine linkage disequilibrium and linkage and to use low-density panels. * Finite Locus Models and Genomic Selection. Dr. Fernando has investigated the use of finite locus models for parameter estimation and genetic evaluation. Currently, these methods are being adapted for genomic selection, which assumes a finite locus model. Recent contributions include studies on genomic selection of purebreds for crossbred performance and use of low-density panels to reduce genotyping costs, which is essential to make genomic selection cost effective in poultry and swine breeding. The GenSel software developed by Fernando and colleagues for whole-genome analyses is continually updated to incorporate findings of these and other studies, and it is used internationally.  Honors and awards  Dr. Rohan has obtained many awards throughout his life time for all the work he has completed. Dr. Rohan's most memorable award, and one that was a stepping stone into his career, was the Horace W. Norton Award. It was awarded to him in 1985 for outstanding contributions to statistics, specifically his contribution in selection, non- mating, and the covariance theory by the university of Illinois. In 2012, Dr. Rohan was awarded the Rockefeller Prentice Memorial Award in Animal Breeding and Genetics by the American Society of Animal Science.  Personal life  Dr. Fernando grew up by the ocean in his early life so he took a liking to swimming and snorkeling. After moving to the Midwest, he developed an interest in running and computer work. Dr. Fernando was married in 1989 to Terry Harrigan, who obtained a PhD in Biochemistry. The two met in Illinois and during their time together had 4 children, all of whom are in higher level education programs.

Development  Following the end of the Second World War, the Italian Armed Forces were equipped with weapons donated and/or sold to them by the United States of America, such as the M1 Garand, as their main service rifle. However, as there were other militaries beginning to develop assault rifles and modern battle rifles, both with larger magazine capacities and increased volumes of fire, the Italians naturally pushed for a more modern service weapon. The M1 Carbine was well-liked among various Italian military circles and the development of the German StG-44 assault rifle chambered in the intermediate 7.92x33mm Kurz cartridge had already given several militaries notice. The Italians decided to design a select-fire weapon chambered in the American .30 Carbine round, being close enough to an intermediate cartridge and easier to acquire than others at the time. Two large Italian arms firms, Pierto Beretta and Luigi Franchi, then began experimental work on improved automatic carbines chambered in the American .30 Carbine cartridge. Despite NATO announcing standardization towards the 7.62x51mm NATO cartridge, the firms continued development under the belief that it would take some time for the NATO cartridge to come into widespread use. Both firms developed service rifles to adhere to NATO's standards. Both designs were finished in 1958, resulting in the Beretta Model 57 and the Franchi LF-58 (which was not publicized). Both designs saw limited production and neither official adoption nor commercial success. The Italian Armed Forces then replaced the M1 Garand with the BM-59 battle rifle in 7.62x51mm NATO and the LF-57 submachine gun chambered in 9x19mm Parabellum.

The company's mines in California and its settlement of Nortonville later became part of the Black Diamond Mines Regional Park and a California Historical Landmark. Several railroad lines were built in California and Washington to support the company's mines, and the company operated numerous ships to transport its coal. As the mines played out and petroleum became the more common source of energy, the company closed its mines and transitioned into real estate as the Southport Land and Commercial Company.  Founding in California  Gravestones in Rose Hill Cemetery in the old Nortonville site at the Black Diamond Mines In the latter half of the nineteenth century, coal became the predominant energy source in the United States. Coal would be transported by rail or ship, and each method incurred transportation costs that made coal costlier in distant areas, motivating miners in the west to search for local sources. The area around Mount Diablo was discovered to have veins of lignite coal, and several mines were opened, including the Cumberland and Black Diamond. In 1861, eight men representing the Cumberland Coal Mine and Black Diamond Coal Mine incorporated their mines into the Black Diamond Coal Mining Company, in order to \\"discover, dig, and develop coal… and to construct the necessary ways, railroads, and means to transport the same... \\" They developed roads from the mines to Clayton and New York Landing, and built the Black Diamond Coal Mining Railroad between Nortonville and New York Landing. New York Landing was renamed Black Diamond Landing, in recognition of the company. Black Diamond also opened a wharf at Port Costa, California. The company town of Nortonville was the largest of the coal towns around Mount Diablo, with a population of over 900. It was named for Noah Norton, who originally opened the Black Diamond mine and built the first two houses there. The first hotel, the Black Diamond Exchange, opened in 1863. A store, a schoolhouse, and more houses were gradually added. As was common at that time, lodges for several fraternal organizations were established, including International Organisation of Good Templars, Knights of Pythias, and Independent Order of Odd Fellows. The company provided the land for Rose Hill Cemetery, a Protestant burial site for miners and other residents of the area, which was later donated to Contra Costa County. A fire destroyed many of the wooden buildings in 1878, and they were replaced with brick buildings. In 1865, the company's founders lost control of the company when a group of investors bought more than 85% of the stock and filled positions on the Board of Directors with their own members. In 1866, the Black Diamond Coal Mining Company purchased the Bellingham Bay Coal Company and reorganized it as a subsidiary, operating its mines until closing them in 1878.  Expansion into Oregon  1895 map of Southport In the 1870s, the company purchased land in Coos County, Oregon. B.B. Jones opened a 2,636‑acre mine on Isthmus Slough for Black Diamond Coal Mining Company. The Southport Mine operation was above water level. Cars transported the coal to the shipping point by gravity, and empty cars were pulled back up by horses. Southport was established as a company town. A few years later, the nearby Newport Mine subsidized the Southport Mine, its competitor, to keep it closed. Black Diamond Coal Mining Company sold the mine in 1953, its last connection with coal mining.  Expansion into Washington  Map indicating location of Black Diamond, Washington The coal being mined from the mines in Nortonville was low quality. Needing a higher grade of coal to compete in the market, the company sent men north in 1880 to search for better sources. They discovered high-quality coal outcroppings in Washington territory, and sent samples to California for testing. The coal they had found was bituminous, higher quality than the lignite coal being mined in the California mines, and the company quickly began clearing trails, building houses, and opening the mine. The village established for the miners was named Black Diamond. Travel from Black Diamond to other towns was by horse or wagon or on foot over rough trails. Heavy equipment had to be brought in by pack animal, crossing the Cedar River six times from the nearest town, Renton. Most homes were built on land owned by the company. By 1885, the population of Black Diamond was 3500, many of them miners. The Columbia and Puget Sound Railroad extended its line to Black Diamond in 1884. With the completion of the railroad line, the company closed its mines in California and began moving its miners and their families north. Eventually, several trains a day would haul coal from the mines to Seattle to be sold there or shipped to San Francisco. Black Diamond Coal Mining Company operated numerous ships to transport its coal between Washington and California, including the Ivanhoe, which was lost at sea in 1894. To tow barges on the lake, it purchased the steamboat Chehalis. The output of the Black Diamond mines in Washington when they were sold in 1904 was between 700 and 800 tons a day.  The miners  Miners used drills and picks to knock loose the coal, working 12 hours a day, six days a week. Trapper boys began working around age 13. Although many of the Black Diamond Coal Mining Company miners were from Wales and Italy, immigrants from many other countries also came to work at the mines. To accommodate its international workers, \\"danger\\" signs were printed in Russian, Slovenian, Hungarian, Danish-Norwegian, Croatian, Spanish, Serbian, Lithuanian, Italian, Polish, Greek, Swedish, Bohemian, German, Finnish, and French. Methane gas and blackdamp were risks in mines. In 1876, six miners were suffocated by blackdamp generated from a powder explosion in a Black Diamond mine, and several others were severely burned. Later, a 24-foot diameter fan was added to the mine for ventilation. In California, the Black Diamond Coal Mining Company employed 315 miners in 1870. Mine employees included \\"100 coal-cutters and miners, 20 car-men, 11 car-drivers, 3 underground foremen, 4 engineers, 8 bunker men, and the rest are carpenters, watchmen, blacksmiths, firemen, door-tenders, furnace men, and slope men.\\" From 1868 to 1905, the superintendent of the mines was Morgan Morgans, a native of Wales.  Closing the mines  With the discovery of higher quality coal in Washington, the company closed its mines in California in 1884 and transferred its properties to a newly formed subsidiary, Southport Land and Commercial Company. The Black Diamond Coal Company Engine No. 3 was sold to the Bellingham Bay and British Columbia Railroad. When the miners departed the area around Mount Diablo in 1884, they left behind 200 miles of coal mine tunnels. The mines and surrounding land later became part of the Black Diamond Mines Regional Preserve. When it closed its mines in Bellingham in 1878, Black Diamond had acquired a considerable amount of land around Bellingham Bay, and throughout the next 19 years, the company focused on the sale of its real estate. In 1904, with demand for coal declining, the company sold its mines in Black Diamond, Washington to the Pacific Coast Company. When it sold its Southport Mine in Oregon and was no longer associated to the coal business, the company adopted the name of its subsidiary, Southport Land and Commercial Company, and concentrated on managing its real estate assets, as well as investing in Bellingham Bay Improvement Company. In the mid to late 1920s, the company attempted to reopen the Clayton Tunnel in Nortonville for coal mining, but were unsuccessful.

The Ramesses III prisoner tiles are a collection of Egyptian faience depicting prisoners of war, found in Ramesses III's palaces at Medinet Habu (adjacent to the Mortuary Temple at Medinet Habu) and Tell el-Yahudiyeh. Large numbers of faience tiles have been found in these areas by sebakh-diggers since 1903; the best known are those depicting foreign people or prisoners. Many were found in excavated rubbish heaps. They are considered of significant historical and ethnographical interest, given the representation of neighbouring populations during the Twentieth Dynasty of Egypt (1189 BC–1077 BC). Most are in the Egyptian Museum in Cairo, as well as the Museum of Fine Arts, Boston. Description Location and size Doorway at Medinet Habu showing the original location of the tiles at the bottom of either side. Tiles were found in 1870 at Tell el-Yahoudieh and in 1903 in Medinet Habu. Those of Tell el-Yahoudieh are larger, with a width of circa , whilst those are Medinet Habu fall into two groups and . All the tiles are rectangular, with a base thickness of , and together with the relief sculpture of the people, the total thickness is . The Medinet Habu prisoner tiles were originally located in three rectangular cells on either side of the palace doorways, each of in height and in width. In all the tiles, the prisoners are shown standing up. In some tiles, the soles of the prisoners' feet rest on the ground; in others they may be interpreted as running or hanging. The prisoners' arms are often tied, and in other tiles a white and black rope with acorns at the ends is shown around the neck. Identification and provenance In his 1911 paper on the tiles, French Egyptologist Georges Daressy, of the Egyptian Museum in Cairo, noted that the tiles have no inscriptions, so identification of the peoples shown required a comparison of the drawings with previously known temple bas-reliefs or tomb paintings, giving some uncertainty: > Unfortunately, there is no inscription on these tiles fixing the name of the > peoples represented; we are forced to compare with the bas-reliefs of the > temples or the paintings of the tombs to find a similar type and we are > sometimes perplexed. Formal excavation work at Medinet Habu by the Egyptian Antiquities Service (EAS) ended in 1899, but work continued by local fellahin sebakh-diggers (sebakh is the nitrogen-rich remains of ancient mud brick, dug up to be used as fertilizer). In 1903, the fellahin discovered remains of overturned doorways, still partly covered with their original decoration in enamelled tiles. Some pieces disappeared, but most were collected by the \\"ghafirs\\" and sent by Howard Carter, then Chief Inspector of the EAS in Upper Egypt, to the Cairo Museum, together with four of the pillars and an overdoor to which they had belonged. The Egyptian Museum tablets are numbered JE 36261 a-b, 36271, 36399, 36440 a-c, 36441 a-c, 36457 a-k, as well as one prior to the 1903 accessions numbered JE 27525. The Boston Museum of Fine Arts noted in 1908 that the tiles' \\"provenance is a matter of question\\". They were purchased in 1903 on behalf of the museum by from Luxor-based antiquities dealer Mohamed Mohassib; the purchase was made as part of a group (03.1566-03.1577; 03.1578a-i).

It is a conversation between the writer and the protagonist Indrajit, who is introduced as 'and Indrajit', because he is part of the society rather than having an identity of his own. It is perceived as an Absurd Play such as Eugène Ionesco's Amédée or Samuel Beckett's Waiting for Godot in the context that it portrays the emptiness and repetitiveness in the pattern and conformity of the modern society. The play subtly points towards Satrean Existentialism. It denotes that life is a circle with no ending, it ends where it begins, it is an endless road.R. (2010, February 08). Badal Sircar's \\"Evam Indrajit\\" as a Play in the Absurdist Tradition. Retrieved March 3, 2019, from http://www.brighthub.com/arts/books/articles/63448.aspx  Synopsis  The first act of the play begins with a writer, who is seen to be frustrated without any content to write his story. His mother comes onto the stage, asking him to eat dinner, unable to understand the depth of his struggle. He is inspired by Manasi and decides to write about four people among the audience. They are Amal Kumar Bose, Vimal Kumar Ghosh, Kamal Kumar Sen, and Nirmal Kumar. The name of the fourth person is not acceptable to the writer who asks him to reveal his real name. After a little persuasion he states his name to be Indrajit and when inquired about him, hiding his identity, he states he is afraid. He says he is scared to bring unrest by breaking the norm. Earlier that was not the case, but the loss of childhood and coming of age changed his priorities from happiness to peace. As the narration goes he is revealed to be a common man, born, schooling, work, every aspect of his life reoccurs in the same place. A scene is depicted where the same conversation is repeated, but only Indrajit realizes. Indrajit talks to the writer and reveals his anguish towards the norms of the society and his desperate dreams to go away from this world. But the thought of his mother binds him, relationships and emotions stops him. The narration then moves to the writer, who is a constant part of his plot and he wishes to write about the life's of these character with a heroine Manasi. Then he asks Indrajit about his love interest in Manasi. He tries to correct the name in the beginning, but then accepts it to be Manasi. Indrajit starts to talk about his relation with Manasi, with whom he could talk and find meaning in those talks. Their relation is like every other relation. At a point they talk about the rules that stop women and give freedom to men. Indrajit's rebel character asks her to disobey the rules and when she refuses, he questions people's nature of worshiping the rules. His anger towards the rules gives a context to the Biblical reference to the forbidden Fruit of Knowledge, that reveals the absurdity behind these rules to him. The next scene shows the original four characters in waiting to go for an interview. They were asked to be there at eleven, while the interviewer came one hour late. A few minutes later they are joined by the writer, who had two interviews that clashed. He tells them his problems, after his marriage and his urgency to get a job because he married against his father's wishes and has also bought a flat. Every scene breaks off with Indrajit's mother asking him to eat, which shows the connection of the writer to his character. The second act of the play occurs after a break of seven years. The characters Amal, Vimal and Kamal have settled down to the middle class life, with a job and family. All of them have a life where they perform the same task in the office, filing papers, stamping files and organizing files. They do not have a break from this routine. Here again this steady and futile lifestyle suffocates Indrajit who wants something outside all these customs. He is searching for something outside the real world. Also he has not married yet because Manasi wants more time and later he decides to go abroad. Realizing his search is in vain, exhausted him and he decides to accept his fate and walks away from his dreams once again. The third act of the play clearly reveals Indrajit's vision through a letter the writer receives. Indrajit writes about the life that goes in circles wherever he is and the worst part is that he knows about the world that goes round and round. At certain point in his life he pulls at the rope of hope to find a meaning to life but ends with a rope that is bitten off. He is then presented on stage with an idealistic approach to life. He cannot make any sense to things he has achieved in life and have thoughts of dying unable to find faith in life. When Manasi asks the writer about his story, he says he is at a point where the writer cannot continue, neither can he kill him nor can he put Indrajit into a plot that matters. The writer is again stuck, like he was at the beginning without a story. Indrajit comes to the stage and tells the writer that he married Manasi, but the writer does not agree. But it is true in his concept of life, because life has taught him, that there is not just one Manasi but many. It has made Indrajit one among Amal, Vimal and Kamal, just an ordinary man. He does meet his old friend Manasi, and tells her how there is no escape from this life of sorrow. Finally he accepts the shackles of the society and names himself 'Nirmal Kumar Rey' - an ordinary man with ordinary ambitions and an ordinary life. Recall that this is the exact name the writer does not accept at the beginning of the play. Towards the end, we see Indrajit and Manasi (his childhood friend and cousin) at their designated spot - near a tree in an empty plot of land. Indrajit is now mature, but the nagging question of \\"why\\" still bothers him. He wants to know why we do the things we do, the way we do them. He wonders aloud at the pointlessness of walking a path with no beginning, no end, and most importantly no meaning. It is then the Myth of Sisyphus is invoked in the storyline, with the writer explaining to Indrajit the pointlessness of Sisyphus's condition. It is here that both - Indrajit and the reader - finally have a solution to the problem of life. The solution is to accept the pointlessness and the absurdity of life, and yet carry on with it. When there is a path, you have to tread on it. That itself is the meaning of life as per the writer.S. C. (2014, September 08).
