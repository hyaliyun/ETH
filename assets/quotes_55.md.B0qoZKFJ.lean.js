He was the son of Louisa (Webber) and brewer Adolph Coors, and the second President of Coors Brewing Company. Life and career Coors was a graduate of Cornell University, where he was a member of the Sphinx Head Society and the Kappa Alpha Society. He became an accomplished chemist who worked in prominent positions in the family's brewing and porcelain operations. He married Alice May Kistler (1885–1970) of Denver on May 4, 1912, at the Kistler home by Rev. Van Arsdall. The couple had four children: Adolph Coors III (1915–1960) who was kidnapped and killed in 1960; William K. Coors (1916-2018), Joseph Coors (1917–2003), and May Louise Coors (1923–2008). Coors had his own brush with kidnapping in 1934. Paul Robert Lane, the former state Prohibition agent for Colorado, along with Clyde Culbertson, former investigator for the federal dry forces, along with two other men conspired to kidnap Adolph Jr. for a ransom of $50,000. The person delivering the money was to proceed to three different checkpoints to ensure no officers were tailing him and then split the money; Coors would be released somewhere around Colorado Springs. Denver police learned of the plot while working on an auto theft ring and Adolph Jr. volunteered to be kidnapped so the police could arrest the suspects. However, Lane was arrested on an auto theft charge and the conspiracy was foiled in advance. Adolph Coors Jr. died in 1970 at the age of 86 years old. References External links *Jett, Philip.

The company operates the Victoria Clipper high-speed passenger-only ferry service between downtown Seattle to both the Inner Harbour in downtown Victoria, British Columbia, and Friday Harbor on San Juan Island. The various Victoria Clipper catamarans typically complete a one-way trip in less than three hours.  History  Clipper Navigation, Inc., was founded in 1986 with the original Victoria Clipper on the Seattle/Victoria route. The Victoria Clipper II was actually two different boats that ran to the San Juan Islands. Then the Victoria Clipper III was purchased. The service between Seattle and Friday Harbor provides orca and gray whale watching out of that port and has been in operation since 1991 daily from mid-May through September. As Clipper Navigation grew, it launched Clipper Vacations. Clipper Vacations provides hotel and tour packages, not just in Victoria, but also in Seattle, Vancouver, Friday Harbor, Portland, Oregon, Whistler, British Columbia, the Canadian Rockies, Kelowna, and many spas and fishing resorts on Vancouver Island. Victoria Clipper IV in Victoria, BC The Victoria Clipper IV, with a LOA of and a beam of , was added to the fleet in the mid-1990s and holds approximately 324 passengers. While the Clipper IV is capable of reaching an overall faster top speed, both vessels cruise at between Seattle and Victoria. The Clipper IV is also one of the fastest passenger vessels in the western hemisphere.List of HSC ferry routes#Americas List of High Speed Ferry Routes, AmericasVictoria Clipper Ferry Ferry to Victoria BC San Juan Islands Ferry. Clippervacations.com. Retrieved on 2013-07-12. The Clipper fleet currently consists of four high speed catamarans, the Victoria Clipper I, Victoria Clipper III, and Victoria Clipper IV, Victoria Clipper V, that serve Seattle, Victoria, and Friday Harbor. Clipper Navigation was also responsible for operating the Princess Marguerite III, a car ferry between Seattle and Victoria. Its operation was discontinued a decade ago due to the extremely high costs associated with the six-hour trip between ports. Currently, there is no car service between Seattle and Victoria. The primary choice for passengers with cars is either the Coho ferry out of Port Angeles or the Washington State Ferry from Anacortes, Washington to Sidney, British Columbia about 30 minutes from Victoria. Clipper Vacations can book passengers who wish to take the Coho in conjunction with a hotel stay. Between 2005 and 2006, Clipper Navigation also operated the Mosquito Fleet out of Everett, Washington. This boat was the primary whale watching service in Friday Harbor. Its operation was ceased at the end of 2006, however. Gray and orca whale watching is still available with the Victoria Clipper out of Seattle. The Victoria Clipper IV was stolen on December 1, 2013 from its dock in Seattle by a sex offender who removed a GPS monitoring device from his ankle and climbed the fence around the dock area, then came aboard and drove the boat away, ripping a cleat from the moor. The boat was adrift in ferry lanes during a 2 hour standoff with police, after which the suspect was arrested and subsequently charged with several crimes, that were \\"not only a public spectacle, but were spectacularly reckless and deadly perilous,\\" according to the prosecutor. The first person to notice the boat was missing was Darrell Bryan, President and CEO of Clipper Navigation. In 2016, Clipper Navigation was acquired by Förde Reederei Seetouristik (FRS) of Flensburg, Germany. FRS announced plans to expand the company's service to include routes between Victoria and Vancouver and between Florida and Cuba. FRS announced plans to replace the current Heligoland ferry ' in 2018 and transport it by barge from Hamburg to Seattle, to be operated by Clipper Navigation.

Sprague de Camp, featuring the fictional sword and sorcery hero Conan the Cimmerian created by Robert E. Howard. Plot overview Conan is a mercenary serving in the Turanian army along with his friend Juma of Kush, both of them having met while in combat. They are assigned by King Yildiz to his Turanian detachment, whose mission is escorting the king's daughter, Princess Zosara, to her wedding with the Great Khan of the Kuigar nomads in the eastern land of Hyrkania. Before they could reach their destination, the Turanian soldiers are ambushed by a tribe of warriors who descend upon them from the foothills of the Talakma Mountains. The Turanians are all killed in the battle except for Conan, Juma, and Zosara. The three survivors are captured by the tribesmen and journey into the fabled kingdom of Meru, which consists of seven sacred cities on the shore of an ancient lake within a tropical valley concealed by mountains on the north and south. The three are taken to Shamballah, City of Skulls, the capital of Meru. Everywhere Conan looks, the architecture of the city is ornately designed or decorated in the likeness of human skulls craved from colored stone. They are eventually brought before the rimpoche or \\"god king\\" of Meru, Jalung Thongpa, a short, fat, ugly man of comical appearance who is nonetheless revered by his people as the reincarnated son of Yama the Demon King. Soon, it becomes clear that the reason for their capture was Jalung Thongpa's desire to claim Zosara for himself after his chief wizard, Tanzong Tengri, the Grand Shaman of Meru, revealed through magic her existence to the king. Conan then attacks the king in an attempt to escape, but is struck by the wizard's magic staff, causing him to fall into a deep slumber. Conan and Juma are then sentenced to a life of slavery at the oars aboard a ship as punishment. The two adventurers eventually escape their fate and return to Shamballah, with the intent to rescue Zosara. They make their way through secret passages back into Jalung Thongpa's throne room, while he and a group of priests are performing a ritual to celebrate his marriage to the unwilling Zosara, who lays naked and shackled to an altar before a gigantic statue of the god Yama. Conan and Juma interrupt Thongpa's ceremony as they leap in wreaking havoc, killing many of the priests, including Tanzong Tengri, and forcing others to flee in panic. The king chants a prayer, which causes the great statue of Yama to come to life and advance toward Conan. However, Juma grabs the king and hurls him toward the statue. The rimpoche is then crushed by the god's foot which breaks the spell, causing the statue to become inanimate once again. Conan and Juma flee the city with Zosara and complete their mission.

Biography  He was born from the liaison of Paolina Bergamaschi, a nurse, with Stefano Bissolati, a priest who left the Church in 1859, at age 37, and later became director of Cremona's city library and a noted scholar. At birth the child was named Leonida Bergamaschi; his name was changed at age 18, when Stefano Bissolati legally adopted him (after marrying Paolina in 1868, five years after she had become a widow). With this family background, it is scarcely surprising that Leonida turned to leftist politics as a student at the University of Bologna, where he earned his law degree at the age of 20. Returning to Cremona, he practiced law as an attorney and published many articles in journals and newspapers. In 1876 he was elected to the City Council of Cremona, at first in the ranks of the Radicals, then gradually moving closer to the Socialists. Altogether he served in the council for 18 years, notably by being in charge of Public Education. He married Ginevra Coggi, who soon fell chronically ill and died in 1894; later, his soulmate and companion was Carolina Cassola, whom he eventually married in 1913. From 1889 to 1895, Bissolati organized peasant demonstrations and the social struggle for better living conditions in the countryside. In 1889 he founded L'eco del popolo (The Echo of the People), which subsequently became the local organ in Cremona of the Italian Socialist Party (PSI). He also published a partial translation of the Communist Manifesto of Marx and Engels. In 1896 he became director of Avanti! (Forward!), the official organ of the PSI, relinquishing this post in 1903, only to resume it from 1908 to 1910. Meanwhile Bissolati was active as a legislator. In 1897 he was elected to the Chamber of Deputies of the Italian Parliament, representing the college of Cremona. His refusal to oppose the war on Turkey for the conquest of Libya triggered his resignation as socialist Member of Parliament in February 1912; five months later he was expelled from the PSI. He promptly went on to found the Italian Reformist Socialist Party (Partito Socialista Riformista Italiano), with Ivanoe Bonomi (a future prime minister) and Angiolo Cabrini. Bissolati strongly advocated Italy's entry into World War I on the side of the Triple Entente, while his former socialist friends favored neutrality. He volunteered for the front and served with distinction, receiving a medal. Back in Rome, he served in two successive Italian Governments (those headed by Paolo Boselli and Vittorio Emanuele Orlando). He was responsible for supplying troops as well as for liaising between cabinet and the generals. At the end of the war, Bissolati supported the League of Nations and Woodrow Wilson's principle of self-determination in the settling of the new national borders. This infuriated the nationalists, bent on annexing to Italy sizeable areas inhabited by Germans and Slavs in the Northeast. Attacked from all sides, he resigned from the government and withdrew from politics in December 1918, although subsequently he met with Woodrow Wilson and urged that Italy not be given Fiume or the Dalmatian Coast. He died in Rome of a post-operative infection. In August 20018, the regular Scottish Rite Masonic Lodge of Cremona commemorated Bissolati as one of his notable members. On 18 Dicember 1974, it was founded in Cremona the \\"Leonida Bissolati\\" Lodge, a Masonic center affiliated ti the Grand Orient of Italy and named in hos honour.

It runs between Maymorn and Cross Creek, and follows of the original route of the Wairarapa Line over the Remutaka Range between the Mangaroa Valley and the Wairarapa, including the world-famous Rimutaka Incline. Parts of the trail are also used by vehicles both from the regional council and from forestry companies with tree plantations in the area; members of the public have limited vehicular access from the Kaitoke end to a car park, go-kart track and gun range. Access is also granted by permission to horse riders. Touring coaches have been used upon occasion to convey tourists and other visitors to various parts of the route. The trail is a popular regional recreation facility and is used by more than 30,000 walkers, runners, and cyclists annually. It is part of a network of walking and cycling trails in public parks and reserves in the area. Several forestry roads diverge from the rail trail and are also used for recreational purposes.  History  Cross Creek turntable pit The Wellington City and Suburban Water Supply Board assumed ownership of the railway corridor land on the Wellington side of the Remutaka Ranges following closure of the railway line in 1955. They retained the railway bridges so as to maintain vehicular access to the area for forestry purposes. Trees were planted by forestry staff around the summit yard and along the route from the late 1950s to the early 1970s. Access was restricted, and it was rare for anyone to be granted permission to enter the area for recreation. The Incline section became the responsibility of the New Zealand Forest Service. All railway- related structures were removed from Cross Creek and Summit in the years following closure of the line. The Cross Creek yard and incline section were gradually reclaimed by nature. The Siberia embankment collapsed during a severe storm in 1967 after its drainage became blocked. A similar problem caused the Summit tunnel to flood. The publication of A Line Of Railway in 1976 and establishment of Featherston’s Fell Engine Museum helped spur interest in the Incline, prompting the Forest Service to provide permanent access to Cross Creek in 1984. In order to facilitate recreational use of the formation, it drained Summit Tunnel and cleared the Cross Creek yard and incline formation. A proposal mooted in the mid 1980s for a walkway between Cross Creek and Kaitoke culminated in the opening of the Rimutaka Rail Trail on 1 November 1987, a joint project between the Wellington Regional Council and the Department of Conservation. Shelter sheds were constructed at Cross Creek and Summit, and several picnic areas along the route. A retaining wall and culverts were installed near the entrance to Price's Tunnel in 2009 by the Department of Conservation to remedy a slip that occurred the previous year.  Management of the trail  The Cross Creek to Summit section is managed by the Department of Conservation, Summit to Maymorn by the Greater Wellington Regional Council. After Kaitoke the trail runs through Tunnel Gully Reserve. If traversing the entire length of the rail trail, a trip can be timed to start at Cross Creek and meet a Wairarapa Connection train at Maymorn station.  Cross Creek – Kaitoke  This section can be accessed from either end. At Kaitoke there are signposted directions along Incline Rd off SH 2 to the start of the formation, km along which is a car park. On the Wairarapa side there is a turn-off to the Cross Creek car park from Western Lake Road, about south- west of Featherston. From the Cross Creek car park it is a hour walk to the Cross Creek station yard. About six hours should be allowed to traverse the entire distance between Cross Creek and Kaitoke. The following car parks are available for users of the trail: * Cross Creek: * Kaitoke: Points of interest along this section include: * Cross Creek yard, the site of Cross Creek railway station * Price’s Tunnel, long on an S-curve * Horseshoe Gully, the site of the Siberia embankment * Siberia Tunnel, long * Summit Tunnel, long * Summit yard, the site of Summit railway station * Ladle Bend Creek bridge, long, restored by the regional council in 2002 * Pakuratahi bridge, long, rebuilt in 1910 and restored by the regional council in 2001 * Rimutaka Tunnel ventilation shaft, built after it was decided to dieselise the line instead of electrifying it as originally planned, and it was found that there was insufficient natural ventilation to operate diesel locomotives through the tunnel * Pakuratahi Tunnel, long * Munitions Bend bridge, the footbridge here was installed in 2003  Kaitoke – Maymorn  Though this section can be walked or cycled from either end, access is easiest from the Maymorn end of the trail. At the end of Plateau Road is a car park for recreational users of the Tunnel Gully reserve, from which access can be gained to the rail trail. At the intersection of Maymorn Road and Parkes Line Road, near Maymorn railway station and car park, is an access road which joins with the rail trail on the hillside above the Rimutaka Tunnel portal. From the Kaitoke end, access to the rail trail can be gained either from one of several forestry roads which join up with the Kaitoke – Cross Creek section of the trail, or from a forestry road that connects with Kaitoke Loop Road about km west of Station Drive. The following parking facilities are near the Maymorn end of this section of the trail: * Plateau Road: * Maymorn railway station There are no car parking facilities at the Kaitoke end. Points of interest along this section of the route include: * Mangaroa Tunnel, 152 metres long  Future  In 2011 the Rimutaka Incline Railway Heritage Trust put forward a proposal to reinstate the railway line over the Remutaka Range. It was withdrawn in February 2012. The proposal was to incorporate all of the former railway formation that currently comprises the rail trail. The plan meant laying of new track would occur in the future. The trust has worked on stage one of their plan, which involves the development of facilities at Maymorn. Later stages include the development of alternative facilities for current users of the rail trail prior to the laying of track.

It has a large number of sub-divisions of a local or occupational nature. The ‘Singadia’ or those who cultivate ‘Singada nut’; the ‘Nadha’ or those who live on banks of streams and the ‘Dhurias’ who sell parched rice. A large number of exogamous groups are also returned, either of titular or totemistic nature: such as ‘Baghmare’ or Vaghmare, tiger- slayer; ‘Godhve, a vulture; and ‘Kolhe’ or Jackal. Marriage is prohibited between members of the same sept and between first cousins. In many localities, families do not intermarry so long as they remember any relationship to have existed between them (Singh 2004). The occupations of Dhiwar are many and various. Primarily they are fisherman and boatman. They are adept in various methods of river fishing and are regularly employed as a worker on a ferry. They monopolizes growing Singade or water nuts in tanks; also grows melons, cucumbers and other vegetables on the sandy stretches along the banks of streams, but at agriculture proper they do not excel. Their connection with water has led to them becoming the water-carrier for Hindus.

Bhoi are traditionally dependent upon the river Adan for their subsistence. Due to depleting fish resources their lives are in danger. Bhoi's the traditional fishermen community in Maharashtra state are mostly found in shoreline areas of the west coast of Maharashtra as well as near rivers, reservoirs, dams. From the ancient times these people used to be called as the \\"Palkhiche Bhoi\\" the tribe which wander all over carrying the Palkhi of ancient king and their families as the loyal ones. Diminishing the rule of king's and kingdom these loyal people have returned to their traditional business – fishing.

Karnataka and Maharashtra. In Goa, they are distinct from the Kharvi community found mostly in the south of that state, although they share a similar traditional occupation. The Gabits are primarily a fishing community and are concentrated in the northern talukas of Canacona, Pernem and Salcete. They are Hindus and generally live in joint family arrangements, although a movement towards the nuclear family is evident  Subsistence or opportunists  Gond: गोंड Gond is the principal tribe of the Dravidian family and perhaps the most important of the non – Aryan or forest tribes in India (Russel and Hiralal 1916). The forest provides substantial bulk for livelihood ranging from food, fuel, fodder, timber, medicine to revenue. The NTFP harvested from the forest like Mahua, gum, and Tendu leaves for Bidi rolling, medicinal plants adds valuable inputs to the economy. Agriculture is largely primitive type, generally paddy. Use of the insecticides and hybrid varieties is not common practice. There are three subdivisions of Gond viz. Raj Gond, Dadves and Mokasis (Pattnaik 2000). The derivation of the word Gond is uncertain. It is the name given to the tribe by Hindus or Muslims, as their own name for themselves is ‘Koitur’ or ‘Koi’, means human being (Russell and Hiralal 1916). Considering another view, the Gond designation given to this tribe by Telugu people, probably was being derived from ‘Konda’, meaning hill or mountain in Telugu language (Guha 1999). The Gond speaks Dravidian language of the same family as Tamil, Canarese and Telugu and therefore it is likely that they come from the south into the present dwellings. Presently Gond are spreads from Narmada in north up to Godavari in south and Chhattisgarh in east up to Khandesh in west (Rajurkar 1956). Katkari Agri This Community major occupation is salt making and farming. But this community also does fishing on small scale. There is very small section of this community which take fishing as full-time occupation and other section of this community does fishing to fed there family or just as a hobby.

He made two further appearances that month, including scoring two goals in the final match, a 3–3 draw at home to Gillingham on 26 April, thus giving Saints fans some indication of what was to come. He made an immediate impact in the following season by becoming Saints' top scorer (with 13 goals) playing alongside Len Andrews, Percy Prince and Sid Kimpton. He followed this up with a spectacular 30 goals the following season, including a hat-trick in a 3–4 defeat at Gillingham on 3 April 1915, making him the leading scorer in the Southern League. According to Holley & Chalk's The Alphabet of the Saints, Dominy's > \\"ball control was second to none; he always managed to keep the ball near > his feet, rarely allowing it to break away, and he always had the priceless > ability, for a forward, of being able to beat an opponent at close > quarters.\\" His career was then interrupted by World War I. Before becoming a professional footballer he had trained as a boiler-maker; during the war he was employed at the local Harland & Wolff shipyard, where he played football for the works team as well as making guest appearances for Southampton, Arsenal and Rangers. After the end of hostilities, Dominy returned to a full-time football career in 1919, and soon formed a formidable striking partnership with Bill Rawlings, as manager Jimmy McIntyre set about building a team for the future. In Saints' final season in the Southern League, Dominy scored 20 goals (to Rawlings' 19), including a hat-trick in a 5–1 victory at home to Crystal Palace on 13 March 1919. Dominy was selected to play for the Southern League against the Irish League and was attracting the attention of First Division clubs, attracting bids from Manchester United and Everton. Although Dominy took part in many England trial matches, he was never capped. To many people this was a surprise as he was \\"not only a player of outstanding ability, but an inspirational captain.\\" Saints were admitted into Division 3 of the Football League in 1920, and just missed out on promotion in their first season, with Dominy contributing 12 goals (to Rawlings' 18). A year later, McIntyre had successfully guided Southampton into Division Two, finishing equal on points with Plymouth Argyle and taking the title on goal average, helped in no small manner by 5–0 victories over Southend United and Newport County, a 6–0 defeat of Charlton Athletic and an 8–0 hammering of Northampton Town on 24 December 1921 (which is still Saints' biggest win in the Football League). In each of these matches Dominy scored twice, with a total of 13 goals at the end of the season, when he was rewarded with a benefit match against Preston North End, won 3–1 by Saints. Over the next four seasons, Saints consolidated their place in Division 2, generally finishing in the upper half of the table with Dominy again top scorer in 1922–23 (with 13 goals). Saints also had a run in the FA Cup, where they got through each of the first three rounds after replays (over First Division Newcastle United, ChelseaGiant Killers 1923 and Second division Bury), before going out to West Ham United after a second replay. Dominy's long playing career with the Saints eventually ended in 1926, when he was given a free transfer to Everton. His Saints' career spanned thirteen years, during which he made 369 appearances (excluding war-time matches) scoring 146 goals. After Southampton He joined Everton in May 1926 and soon formed a useful partnership (and friendship) with Dixie Dean and in his first season he scored 12 goals in 28 league appearances (to Dean's 21) as Everton narrowly avoided relegation from the First Division. In the following season, he only made one appearance as Everton claimed the League championship with Dean contributing 60 of the team's 102 league goals. Age was now against Dominy and in March 1928 (now aged 35) he moved on to Third Division (South) side Gillingham. He made 14 appearances (with 3 goals) in the 1927–28 season, followed up with 14 goals in 1928–29 (making him the club's top scorer for the season), as Gillingham finished at the bottom of the table and were forced to seek re-election to the league. He then completed his league playing career with a season at fellow Third Division (South) side Clapton Orient. After retiring from league football, he returned to Southampton and became a licensee at the Mason's Arms in St. Mary's Street, whilst playing occasionally for Newport (Isle of Wight), often playing alongside his former Saints' partner, Bill Rawlings. Coaching and management career During the 1930s he also was a scout for Southampton and helped out at the local Itchen Sports team and running a sports stadium in Bournemouth. In 1934 he was offered the position as manager at Le Havre AC in France but turned this down, choosing to stay in Southampton. In 1943, following the sudden resignation of Tom Parker as manager at Southampton, Dominy was approached by the board and asked to take on the position for the duration of the war. The position was only part- time, but Dominy gave valuable assistance until the appointment of Bill Dodgin in January 1946 in time for the resumption of league football later that year. With no training facilities at The Dell during the war, the only time Dominy saw the side was on match days. After retirement After handing over the role of manager to Bill Dodgin, Dominy remained at The Dell, as chief steward at the Saints supporters club, thus maintaining strong links with Southampton until his death in 1974, aged 81.

The Labour Party won all 60 seats in the House of Representatives, with their leader, Edward Seaga, continuing as Prime Minister. Background The Labour Party had won the 1980 general elections in convincing style, taking 51 of the 60 seats in the House of Representatives. At the time the party promised to update the electoral roll, but had failed to do so by the 1983 elections. On 25 November 1983 Seaga called early elections, two years before they were due.Jamaica Inter-Parliamentary Union Seaga claimed that the move was due to People's National Party leader Michael Manley calling for him to resign from his post of Finance Minister (which he held in addition to being Prime Minister), and that the early elections would be a public vote of confidence in his austerity plans. Whilst the People's National Party boycotted the elections and called for others to do so as well, three minor parties and several independents contested the elections. Two of the parties, the Christian Conscience Movement and the Jamaica United Front, had never previously contested an election. The other, the Republican Party, had run in the 1955 and 1967 elections, but had never received more than 108 votes.Nohlen, pp433-434 Between them, opposition and independent candidates only contested six constituencies, resulting in Labour Party candidates winning 54 seats unopposed. Whilst turnout in the contested seats was estimated to be around 55%, the overall total was just 2.7%, by far the lowest in the country's history and one of three occasions (the others being 2016 and 2020) it has been below 50%. Results Aftermath The Labour Party government was sworn in on 19 December, and remained in power until the 1989 elections, in which the People's National Party won 45 of the 60 seats.Nohlen, p435 On 30 December Governor-General Florizel Glasspole appointed eight independent senators; Clarence Reid, Charles Sinclair, Emil George, Errol Miller, Lloyd Barnett, Courtney Lloyd Fletcher, Barbara Makeda Blake and Keith Worrell, who were recommended by Seaga.G-G appoints eight opposition Senators on PM's recommendation Kingston Gleaner, 30 December 1983 References Category:1983 in Jamaica Category:Elections in Jamaica Jamaica ","title":"1983 Jamaican general election"},{"id":"13088212","text":"General elections were held in Jamaica on 18 December 1997.Dieter Nohlen (2005) Elections in the Americas: A data handbook, Volume I, p430 The ruling People's National Party of Prime Minister P. J. Patterson won 50 of the 60 seats defeating the main opposition Jamaica Labour Party. Background Prime Minister P. J. Patterson announced on 27 November that the election would be held on 18 December. Patterson saw this as the right time to go the country as his People's National Party was ahead in the opinion polls, inflation had fallen substantially and the national football team had just qualified for the 1998 World Cup. The previous election in 1993 had seen the People's National Party win 52 of the 60 seats, although in a quarter of the seats the winning margin was less than 1,000 votes. A record 197 candidates contested the election, with a new political party, the National Democratic Movement, standing in most of the seats. The National Democratic Movement had been founded in 1995 by a former Labour Party chairman, Bruce Golding, after a dispute over the leadership of the Jamaica Labour Party. Campaign The election was seen as being mainly between the governing People's National Party and the main opposition Jamaica Labour Party, led by the former Prime Minister Edward Seaga. The economy and violence were the major issues in the election, with the People's National Party maintaining a lead in the polls as the election neared. The election was mainly free of violence as compared to previous elections, although it began with an incident where rival motorcades from the main parties were fired on. The election was the first in Jamaica where a team of international election monitors attended. The monitors were from the Carter Center and included Jimmy Carter, Colin Powell and former heavyweight boxing world champion Evander Holyfield. Just before the election the two main party leaders made a joint appeal for people to avoid marring the election with violence. Election day itself saw one death and 4 injuries relating to the election, but the 1980 election had seen over 800 deaths. Results In winning the election the People's National Party became the first party to win 3 consecutive terms. The opposition Jamaica Labour Party only had 2 more seats in Parliament after the election but their leader Edward Seaga held his seat for a ninth time in a row. The National Democratic Movement failed to win any seats despite a pre-election prediction that they would manage to win a seat.

An original French design, it was developed by Batignolles Company of Paris and introduced in 1915. Service The weapon was dismantled for transport, requiring four carts for the barrel, base, carriage and ammunition. In action, a heavy timber platform was constructed embedded in the ground, on which the mortar base was immovably secured. The mortar carriage sat on the base and could traverse. The mortar barrel and breech were mounted on the carriage which provided elevation. They were used in the \\"siege warfare\\" on the Western Front to destroy enemy strongpoints, bunkers and similar \\"hard\\" targets which were invulnerable to lighter mortars and field guns. The US Army handbook described it : \\"... the use for which it is primarily adapted is in the bombardment of strongly protected targets—dwellings, covered shelters, command posts, entrances to galleries, etc—or in the destruction of sectors of trenches, salients and the like.\\".\\"Handbook of the 9.45-inch trench mortar matériel\\" United States Ordnance Department. December 1917. page 9 Their effectiveness decreased late in the war as German policy changed to a lightly held frontline, hence decreasing available targets, and they became redundant when the war of movement resumed in mid-1918. French use The mortar was first introduced in 1915 as the Mortier de 240 mm CT (\\"court de tranchee\\"). It was a short barreled version which fired a 192 lb (87 kg) bomb for 1,125 yards (1,030 m), using a propellant charge of 1 lb 9 oz (710 g). Its first major use was in the Champagne offensive of September 25, 1915. This was followed later by the Mortier de 240 mm LT (\\"long de tranchée\\") which was a long barreled version with improved firing arrangement and breech-loaded charge which fired a bomb , using a propellant charge of .

The December 1917 manual describes the weapon as \\"9.45 inch\\" but makes clear it is the French 240 mm they are describing that the US has adopted.

The cartridge containing propellant charge appropriate for the required range was loaded into the breech, similar to a howitzer.

Origin Currently it is unclear how far back the origin of scam letters date. The oldest reference to the origin of scam letters could be found at the Spanish Prisoner scam.Scams that Keep Being Used on People This scam dates back to the 1580s, where the fictitious prisoner would promise to share non-existent treasure with the person who would send him money to bribe the guards. Today scam letters are a general part of electronic life, ending up in mailboxes in hordes. Types Lottery scam letter Based on mostly the same principles as the Nigerian 419 advance-fee fraud scam, this scam letter informs recipients that their e-mail addresses have been drawn in online lotteries and that they have won large sums of money. Here the victims will also be required to pay substantial small amounts of money in order to have the winning money released, which never materializes. Phishing scam letter Phishing scam letters, in short, are a notification from an online 'financial institution', requiring its clients to log into their accounts and verify or change their log-in details. A fraudulent website is set up by offenders, which appears to be the website of the actual financial institution. Once a victim follows the log-in link from the scam letter and logs into the 'account', the log-in details are sent to the offenders. Cheap Viagra and software product scam letter This is yet another scam where the misrepresentation is made as an offer for cheap medical products and computer software. Often, when ordered, victims will not receive the goods or in certain instances a fake version of the goods ordered. Dating love scam letter Often users will find the letter from a young and attractive female wanting to meet or relocate to the users' country. After invoking their confidence trick on the user they will require the recipient of the scam letter to pay the funds necessary for the relocation. Once paid, the correspondence ends and the writer never appears. Subscription scam Users of some Web sites are sometimes faced with invoices from Internet sites which they have visited. One company with a reputation for this is the Swiss- German based company Media Intense GmBH, which runs win- load.net.http://antiabzockenet.blogspot.com/2008/12/media-intense-gmbh.html Users are asked to create an account before downloading a piece of software.

The mentioned examples above acs as an indication of how these scam letters work and how victims are defrauded. Distribution Postal services In the past, before the introduction of electronic communications, scam letters were posted by normal postal services, which had been a slow and tedious method of defrauding victims. Although this method tremendously decreased its appearance today, it still occurs that a victim might receive the posted scam letter. Fax Faxed scam letters are in no way an uncommon occurrence.The Nigerian Scam Defined Today many scam letters are still faxed to corporate institutions, although they are not a large amount due to cost restraints on behalf of offenders. Electronic mail E-mail is today the prevalent way in which scam letters are distributed. Due to its cost- effectiveness and international reach, offenders prefer this method as victims are reached in a much more timely manner. Forums and chat rooms Often offenders will target busy Internet-based forums and chat rooms where they will circulate their scam letters to registered users. Law enforcement Generally, law enforcement agencies from around the world are interested in scam letters where actual losses incurred upon a victim. Due to the sheer volume of scam letters distributed on the Internet, no law enforcement agency will be in a position to investigate every scam letter reported. Most law enforcement agencies have a method of reporting scam letters to them.

History The village is said to date back to about 1900 and was founded by a group of saban people, though some dispute this account. They converted from pagan beliefs to Christianity in the 1960s. The village was used as a base by the Allied Army during the Confrontation in the mid-1960s. Travel Before the mid 1980s travel to the village was predominantly by river, but in the late 1980s and early 1990s, this isolated place could be reached by small aircraft like the DHC-6 Twin Otter and helicopter. Now it is also accessible by timber or logging road from Merawa Camp. There are also scheduled flights by Malaysia Airlines to Miri and Marudi. Facilities Currently, the village has one primary school (SK Long Banga), a clinic, an airport (Long Banga Airport) and a church. Events The Prime Minister of Malaysia, Dato' Seri Najib visited Long Banga on 22 July 2010 and announced a long-overdue road, a mini dam and a mobile medical clinic, as well as a plan to survey native lands to give indigenous people ownership of their ancestral territory.

Eldorado College and Orange County Business College offered nine two-year programs, a number of four-year degree programs and later master's degree programs, as well as various certificate programs. There were well over 10,000 graduates from the colleges. According to the BPPVE database, Orange County Business College, located at 2035 East Ball Road, Anaheim, California, closed on November 24, 1997. There is no custodian of records or contact information listed on the BPPVE database for Orange County Business College or Eldorado College.

Eldorado College in Oceanside had been accredited since 1970 and its campus in West Covina had been accredited since 1985. Orange County Business College in Anaheim had been accredited since 1973. Challenges According to a decision on the Department of Education's Office of Student Financial Assistance Programs (SFAP), the school was cited for failing to provide for a fair and equitable refund policy in compliance with 34 C.F.R. § 668.22. The concerns were discovered in March 1991 during an on-site program visit by the SFAP (Student Financial Assistance Program). SFAP also asserts that from April 1, 1994. the college failed to make any refunds to students, lenders, the State of California, and ED also in violation of 34 C.F.R. § 668.22. Finally, SFAP claimed that the college violated one of the standards of financial responsibility under 34 C.F.R. § 668.15(b)(3)(i) by failing to properly pay refunds. The sollege defended itself by arguing that at all times it acted reasonably and in good faith in its refund obligations. It points out that the California refund rules were \\"in a state of change and confusion\\" during the period. At one time, CSAC issued a notice that the refund rules in issue here only applied to students who withdrew on or after September 1, 1990. Later, this policy was changed so the refund rules applied retroactively to January 1, 1990, but only to the students who were enrolled after that date. The school was in a constant state of negotiations with CPPVE regarding what rules were to be applied—eventually some of the college's positions were accepted. while other issues were conceded by the college. Finally, the college and CPPVE agreed to a final sum of refunds owed: the college proposed a payment schedule, put money in escrow, and sought approval from ED as to the amounts to be repaid and the terms of repayment. In essence, the college argues that although it agrees that it owes over $300,000 in refunds, it is totally unfair to terminate the school given it \\"calculated and paid refunds in accord with its reasonable. good faith interpretation of the refund policy.\\" Student loan default rates led to the closure of the school. According to the Department of Education website, Eldorado College had student loan default rates of 27.5%, 36.2%, and 38.9% for student cohorts in 1993, 1994, and 1995, respectively. This resulted in the loss of federal aid eligibility for its students. The college closed on September 11, 1997. The college president said that the school's closure was the result of \\"overzealous bureaucrats.\\" References External links * http://www.ed-oha.org/secretarycases/1995-139-ST.pdf * http://www.ed-oha.org/secretarycases/1995-139-ST2.pdf Category:Universities and colleges in Los Angeles County, California Category:Universities and colleges in Orange County, California Category:Universities and colleges in San Diego County, California Category:Defunct private universities and colleges in California Category:Educational institutions established in 1961 Category:Educational institutions disestablished in 1997 Category:1961 establishments in California ","title":"Eldorado College"},{"id":"13088363","text":"Edwin William Brunsden (born: December 10, 1896 Kent, England – died: September 28, 1976) was an agent, an agrologist.

It is a 2005 addition to the National Register of Historic Places,http://nysparks.state.ny.us/news/press/view.asp?pressID=401 built in a Victorian style for a local man named Richard Masten. Later it was home to Gilbert Millspaugh, son of a local furniture retailer. It is an unusual use of the Second Empire style for a small-scale cottage-style primary residence. The house retains many of its original features, such as its fireplace, mansard roof and carriage barn in the back. The latter is considered a contributing property to the house's historic character. Property It is located just south of downtown Walden on Church Street, which slopes up sharply between Orange Avenue (NY 208) and Scofield Street. Like all the other lots on Church, it is located on the west side of the street as the east is a wooded slope to Orange too steep to be buildable. The lot itself, with a variety of trees and shrubs, slopes up from the street and its flagstone sidewalk. The other houses in the neighborhood are also of late 19th century construction. An asphalt driveway goes to the north of the building to the outbuildings in the rear. From it a stone walkway runs diagonally to the entrance. The house itself is two stories high, sided in clapboard three bays by three, with an exposed basement of mortared rubblestone faced in brick and mansard roof shingled in square and diamond-shaped wood. Steep stairs rise on the east (front) facade to the flat-roofed porch, detailed with chamfered posts and scroll-sawn brackets and railing to create a Picturesque effect. Above the roof is a bracketed frieze giving way to the fasciae below the bracketed cornice. The roof's steep, nearly vertical pitch is pierced by two gabled round-topped dormer windows with louvered shutters. The top of the pitch is marked by a wood crown molding with built-in gutters. On the north the fenestration is duplicated with a three-sided projecting bay window. The south is similar has only one dormer in the mansard. A gable-roofed wing with a small addition, both sided in clapboard. It has a bracketed cornice, fasciae and kicked eaves at the rear. The deeply recessed entrance features paneled double doors below a rectangular transom. It opens on a side entrance hall. The house's original floor plan remains, although the functions of the rooms have changed. Original finishes include the pine flooring, wall plaster, marbleized door knobs, a marble mantel, molded wooden window trim and the turned newel post and balusters on the staircase. History The house was originally built for Richard Masten in 1874. There are almost no surviving records on Masten besides the loan agreement. A local contractor began the house late that year and finished it in 1875. The design likely came from a pattern book, with the Millspaugh, son of the furniture dealer's founder, moved in 20 years later, in 1895. He stayed there for ten years. The house would remain associated with him afterwards. At some point the rear wing was built to replace the original rear porch, which had become too rotten to stand. There have been no other significant changes to the house.

The team was led by its new head coach Todd Dodge. He replaced Darrell Dickey, who was fired after going 3–9 in 2006. Dodge was regarded as one of the nation’s most successful high school football coaches amassing a 98–11 record overall at Carroll High School in Southlake, Texas. He was named National Coach of the Year by Schutt Sports in 2004 and by USA Today in 2005. His Southlake program produced five consecutive offensive players of the year in Texas. Dodge is also regarded by many FBS coaches as one of the nation's premiere offensive minds in developing a unique and effective scheme in his variation of the spread offense, in the much the same vein as Steve Spurrier and Mouse Davis. While at Southlake, Dodge helped the University of Missouri to implement his scheme. The Mean Green played their home games on campus at Fouts Field in Denton, Texas. Preseason Coaching After being named as head coach, Todd Dodge announced in early January the hiring of nine new assistant coaches. The new staff's combined resumes include 26 bowl appearances, 14 bowl victories, 18 high school state titles, a Super Bowl title and a BCS national title. New defensive coordinator Ron Mendoza, new offensive coordinator Todd Ford and new special teams Robert Drake all come with Dodge from Carroll High School where they coached the Dragons to 5 state titles. After a tenure in the NFL with the Pittsburgh Steelers, and University of Houston Cougars, Butch LaCroix, former North Texas assistant from 1987–1993, rejoins the Mean Green staff for a second duration as cornerback’s coach. For the past four seasons at the University of Tulsa, new offensive line coach Spencer Leftwich returns to North Texas at the same position he previously held. Former North Texas leading receiver, new receivers coach Clayton George, also served under Dodge until becoming head coach at Hillcrest High School. 2003 Division I assistant coach of the year, new safeties coach Chuck Petersen, after spending 17 years with United States Air Force Academy Falcons.

Spring Game Stadium Improvements Prior to the first home game, Fouts Field received several improvements. With paint donated by local Pittsburgh Paints, the student spirit organization, Talons, repainted the entire stadium. Other changes included renovated bathrooms, signage, asphalt in and around the entry gates. This is the largest improvement to Fouts since replacement of the field's Astroturf prior to the 2005 season.  Uniform changes  On August 4, 2007, North Texas unveiled changes to their uniforms during the Kickoff Cookout at the Mean Green Athletic Center. For away games, instead of all green jerseys, the team will have white shirts with white pants. Home games will feature the university's new kelly green on top and have the same white pants. The numbers and letters will be green for away games and white for home with a black outline. The most notable change is the reintroduction of a white helmet not worn since alumni \\"Mean\\" Joe Greene played for North Texas in the late 1960s.

Contradicting the final score, Oklahoma head coach Bob Stoops admitted being worried about running up the score criticizing the Mean Green's no huddle offense. Coach Dodge handled the loss well and was quoted he held no ill-feelings towards to Sooners for the lopsided win. North Texas set a new record of most points given up in a single game.

The plan was approved by the Arab League in 1964 but Israel prevented the project's development by conducting airstrikes in Syrian territory in April 1967. Background In 1955 the Unified (Johnston) Plan for the multinational development of Jordan River basin between the riparian rights holders was finalized. The Plan was accepted by the technical committees from both Israel and the Arab League. A discussion in the Knesset in July 1955 ended without a vote. The Arab Experts Committee approved the plan in September 1955 and referred it for final approval to the Arab League Council. On 11 October 1955, the Council voted not to ratify the plan, due to the League's opposition to formal recognition of Israel. After the Suez Crisis of 1956 however, the Arab states (with the exception of Jordan) considerably hardened their position against Israel,Shlaim, pp. 186–187. and now opposed the plan, arguing that by strengthening its economy the plan would increase the potential threat from Israel.Shlaim, pp. 228–230. The Arab leadership also argued that the increase to Israel's water supply would encourage the immigration of more Jewish settlers, thus reducing the possibility of repatriation for Palestinian refugees of the 1948 war. However, Nasser, the Egyptian president, assured the Americans that the Arabs would not exceed the water quotas prescribed by the Johnston plan Nevertheless, both Jordan and Israel undertook to operate within the allocations laid out within the \\"Johnston Plan\\" . Two civil engineering projects were completed successfully; the diversion of water from the Jordan River (1.7 million cubic metres in a day) at Eshed Kinrot, carried by the Israeli National Water Carrier from 1955 to 1964 and the Jordanian construction of the East Ghor Canal (now known as the King Abdullah Canal) from 1957 to 1966.United Nations University In 1955 the Unified (Johnston) Plan to develop a multilateral approach to water management failed to be ratified, which reinforced unilateral development. Nevertheless, both Jordan and Israel undertook to operate within their allocations, and two major successful projects were undertaken: the Israeli National Water Carrier and Jordan's East Ghor Main Canal.... Design of the East Ghor canal was begun by Jordan in 1957. It was intended as the first section of a much more ambitious plan known as the Greater Yarmouk project. Additional sections included (1) construction of two Dams on the Yarmouk (Mukheiba and Maqarin) for storage and hydroelectricity, (2) construction of a 47-km West Ghor canal, together with a siphon across the Jordan River near wadi Faria to connect it with the East Ghor Canal, (3) construction of seven dams to utilise seasonal flow on side wadis flowing into the Jordan, and (4) construction of pumping stations, lateral canals, and flood protection and drainage facilities. In the original Greater Yarmouk project the East Ghor Canal was scheduled to provide only 25% of the total irrigation scheme.... Construction of the Canal began in 1959. By 1961 its first section was completed; sections two and three, down Wadi Zarqa, were in service by June 1966. Shortly before completion of the Israeli Water Carrier in 1964, an Arab summit conference decided to try to thwart it. Discarding direct military attack, the Arab states chose to divert the Jordan headwaters. Two options were considered: either the diversion of the Hasbani to the Litani and the diversion of the Banias to the Yarmouk, or the diversion of both the Hasbani and the Banias to the Yarmouk. The latter was chosen, with the diverted waters to be stored behind the Mukhaiba dam.... The Arabs started work on the Headwater Diversion Project in 1965. Israel declared that it would regard such diversion as an infringement of its sovereign rights. According to the estimates completion of the project would have deprived Israel of 35% of its contemplated withdrawal from the upper Jordan, constituting one ninth of Israel's annual water budget. Murakami, Masahiro (1995) Managing Water for Peace in the Middle East: Alternative Strategies, pp. 295–297 Diversion Plan After the Suez Crisis in 1956, however, Arab attitudes hardened considerably, and the Arab League, with the exception of Jordan, now actively opposed the Johnston plan, arguing that any plan to strengthen the Israeli economy only increases the potential threat from Israel. In 1964 when Israel's National Water Carrier was nearing completion, the second Arab League summit conference voted on a plan designed to circumvent and frustrate it. Their resolution stated: > The establishment of Israel is the basic threat that the Arab nation in its > entirety has agreed to forestall. And Since the existence of Israel is a > danger that threatens the Arab nation, the diversion of the Jordan waters by > it multiplies the dangers to Arab existence. Accordingly, the Arab states > have to prepare the plans necessary for dealing with the political, economic > and social aspects, so that if necessary results are not achieved, > collective Arab military preparations, when they are not completed, will > constitute the ultimate practical means for the final liquidation of Israel. The Arab and North African states chose to divert the Jordan headwaters rather than to use direct military intervention. The heads of State of the Arab League considered two options: #The diversion of the Hasbani to the Litani combined with the diversion of the Banias to the Yarmouk, #The diversion of both the Hasbani and the Banias to the Yarmouk. The second option was selected. The scheme was only marginally feasible, was technically difficult and expensive. Arab political considerations were cited to justify the diversion scheme. Syria began its part of the overall Arab diversion plan with the construction of the Banias to Yarmouk canal in 1965, with financing from Egypt and Saudi Arabia. Once completed, the diversion of the flow would have transported the water into a dam at Mukhaiba for use by Jordan and Syria and prevent the water from reaching the Sea of Galilee. Lebanon also started a canal to divert the waters of the Hasbani, whose source is in Lebanon, into the Banias. The Hasbani and Banias diversion works would have had the effect of reducing the capacity of the Israeli carrier from the Sea of Galilee by about 35% and Israel's overall water supply by about 11%. Additionally, it would have increased the salinity of the Sea of Galilee by 60 ppm. Israel declared that it would regard such diversion as an infringement of its sovereign rights. Israel exploited the DMZ incidents as pretexts for bombing the diversion project, culminating in air strikes deep in Syrian territory in April 1967. Aftermath The increase in water-related Arab-Israeli hostility was a major factor leading to the June 1967 Six-Day War.

Amuri is a district in the city of Tampere, Finland. Starting from the 19th century, Amuri was originally mainly a residence area for the working class. It consisted of blocks of wooden houses built together, which were replaced by low-rise apartment buildings in the 1970s and 1980s. The worker apartments in Amuri typically had shared kitchens, with two or four families sharing a kitchen together. One block has been preserved as a museum. Amuri also has a disused train traffic stop. Amuri stretches from Hämeenpuisto to Sepänkatu and from Paasikiventie to Pirkankatu. For tourists, there is a lot to see in Amuri: the Metso main library, the Tampere Art Museum, the Tampere Rock Museum and the traditional worker residence block. The amusement park Särkänniemi is located immediately north of Amuri on the shore of the Näsijärvi lake. Places to eat in Amuri include the Metso library café, the old-fashioned Worker Museum café, the Amurin Helmi restaurant, or the amusement centre Hepokatti.

Accrued jurisdiction will occur when there are several cases brought to the Federal Court of Australia (FCA) where there are competing jurisdictions between them. In essence the state vests judicial authority in the federal court providing that a number of requirements are met. A claim that is based on a state law for example can be heard in a federal court depending on: # the actions done by respective parties # the relationship between the parties # the laws which attach rights or liabilities to the conduct and relationship of parties # whether the different claims arise under the same subject matter # whether the different claims are so related that the determination of one depends on the other The above test is applied by the court and a decision reached as to whether the court has accrued jurisdiction. A convenient example of this process is outlined in the case Re Wakim; Ex parte McNally (1999) HCA where there is a conflict between state and federal jurisdictions. In this particular case it was held that accrued jurisdiction did exist but had it not the FCA would have been acting unconstitutionally had it proceeded hearing the case.

The viaduct is built to allow residents living in the Eastern, Central and Western part of Singapore a high- speed access between the east and the west for the residents who wants to travel from the east to the west or vice versa. The extension of the viaduct was opened on 24 August 2008, and is the first flyover to be constructed over an existing flyover, the Marymount Flyover. The extension is also part of the Outer Ring Road System, allowing motorists travelling between Queensway and Bartley Road to bypass the city area. Extension project As part of the Outer Ring Road System, the Land Transport Authority (LTA) widened the existing viaduct and constructed a pair of dual two-lane vehicular viaducts from Braddell Road to join the existing MacRitchie Viaduct. It provides a direct link between Lornie Road and Braddell Road, allowing motorists to bypass the traffic light junctions at Braddell Road, Thomson Road and Lornie Road. The extension project also increased the traffic capacity in the area. Sago Kogyo was awarded the civil works contract by the LTA for the construction of this extension project. Worth about S$34.4 million, the contract covers the extension project; includes widening of the existing viaduct and construction of the extension of the viaduct from Braddell Road to the widened MacRitchie Viaduct. The contract also includes the widening of existing at-grade roads: Lornie Road, Braddell Road and Thomson Road. Additionally, the civil works included the construction of four new bus shelters and one new pedestrian overhead bridge with covered walkways to the nearest bus shelter. The Land Transport Authority worked closely together with the National Parks Board to minimise the need to remove trees around and in the construction site. Despite the efforts, some trees were affected and had to be felled.

Biography Hopkins was born in Hertfordshire, England and completed the Foundations Studies course at Brighton Polytechnic from 1984 to 1985. She studied fine art at Newcastle Polytechnic between 1985 and 1988, graduating with a B.A.(Hons). For a time, after graduating from Newcastle Polytechnic, she lived and worked in Australia, where she also exhibited. After a two-year course she graduated from Glasgow School of Art with a master's degree in 1994. Hopkins quickly gained recognition in Glasgow and London after graduating in 1994. That year she was included in a group show, New Art in Scotland in Glasgow and in a touring show, SWARM, organised by the Scottish Arts Council during 1995. In 1996 Hopkins featured in the group show New Contemporaries 96 at Tate Liverpool. She was shortlisted for the Jerwood Painting prize in 1997. In 2002, she received a Creative Scotland Award. She held her first retrospective exhibition at the Fruitmarket Gallery in 2005 and, in 2007, she was one of six artists chosen to represent Scotland at the 52nd Venice Biennale. In 2014, she exhibited at Linlithgow Burgh Halls as part of GENERATION-25 years of Contemporary Art in Scotland. Work Hopkins is known for making work on the surfaces of pre-existing, and usually pre-printed, materials either with specific imagery or more generic graphic information. From this she develops painted or drawn marks as a way of engaging and transforming the surface. Found surfaces that Hopkins works onto include furnishing fabric, maps, sheet music, graph paper, photographs, pages from history books and from commercial catalogues. :\\"The artist has spoken of her interest in working on supports which contain information, often an image, and in turning that image into a painting by repainting and hence remaking it.\\"From \\"mark making\\" by Fiona Bradley, in Louise Hopkins: Freedom of Information, paintings and drawings, 1996-2005, published by The Fruitmarket Gallery, Edinburgh, 2005 :\\"Louise Hopkins’s world is in an endless state of flux, becoming and adjustment. Meaning for her is never something to be merely established-through research, for example, or contemplation-but rather galvanised, sparked into a state of pulsing iteration and reiteration…In an indicative work, Untitled (011), 1998, she once crumpled a piece of white paper, the kind generally used to write or type or scribble or photocopy on. She acted not in anger or frustration but to make the paper more interesting, yet not less itself. To the same end, she then used a fine pencil to draw thin parallel marks delineating the faint shadows cast by the creases. The paper’s once latent complexity was unleashed. Its pristine (artless) past remained a presence beneath the surface. Through a set of effects, both accidental and intended the blank sheet had become defined, articulated through hard-edged incident; it also continued to carry the dynamic tension of its violent collapse.\\"From \\"adjustment\\" by Greg Hilty, a text originally published as part of Louise Hopkins: Freedom of Information, paintings and drawings, 1996-2005, published by The Fruitmarket Gallery, Edinburgh, 2005 Solo exhibitions Solo exhibitions include: *Black Sea, White Sea, Linlithgow Burgh Halls, Linlithgow, (part of GENERATION-25 years of Contemporary Art in Scotland), 2014. *Settings, Mummery + Schnelle, London, 2014. * Project Room, Mummery + Schnelle, London, 2010. *Harness at Mummery + Schnelle, London, in October/November 2008; *Freedom of Information at The Fruitmarket Gallery, Edinburgh, in 2005; *The Round Room, Talbot Rice Gallery, Edinburgh, in 2004; *doggerfisher, Edinburgh, in 2003; *Andrew Mummery Gallery, London, in 2003; *Angles Gallery, California, in 2001; *Andrew Mummery Gallery, London, in 1999; *Artconnexion, Lille, in 1997; *Galerie Isabella Kackprzak, Berlin, in 1997; *Galleria Raffaella Cortese, Milan, in 1998; *Tramway Project Room, Glasgow, in 1996; *Aberdeen Art Gallery, in 1994; *Canberra School of Art, in 1993; *Ben Grady Gallery, Canberra, in 1992.

It was essentially the Canon de 155 C modèle 1915 Schneider fitted with a different breech to use bagged propellant rather than the cartridge cases used by the older howitzer. It was used by France, Russian Empire, Belgium, Rumania, and the United States from 1917 during World War I and was widely exported after the war. Surviving weapons were in service with France, Poland, Greece, Italy, Belgium, the United States, and Finland during World War II. Captured weapons were used by the Germans for their 2nd-line artillery and coast defense units. Development and description Canon de 155 C modèle 1915 Schneider The Canon de 155 C modèle 1915 was based on Schneider's M1910 howitzer that had been sold to the Russian Empire. Schneider later used the M1910 carriage for their long- range Canon de 105 modèle 1913, Canon de 155 L modèle 1877/1914 and Canon de 155 L modèle 1917 guns, so it was relatively simple to mount a new barrel on the carriage and recoil system of the gun. Production began in 1915.Hogg, p. 93-4 The Mle 1915 was a conventional design with a hydro-pneumatic recoil system mounted under the barrel, a gun shield to protect the crew and a box carriage with wooden wheels. It used an interrupted-screw breech with separate-loading ammunition; the shell being loaded first followed by the proper amount of propellant in a brass cartridge case. A loading tray was hinged to the left side of the cradle. It was swung into position after the breech had opened to hold the shell before it was pushed into the chamber, which had a catch to hold the shell in place until it could be rammed, but had to be moved out of the way before the breech could be closed for firing. It could be towed by a team of eight horses if a two-wheeled limber was placed under the trail and the barrel pulled back along the trail to move the center of gravity towards the limber. For (slow) motor-traction no limber was necessary and the trail was hooked directly to the tractor.Hogg, p. 95-6 The longer barrel and higher muzzle velocity gave the Mle 1915 an extra of range at the high cost of over of extra weight over the M1910 Schneider sold to Russia.Hogg, pp. 213, 215 Gallery File:Howitzer 155 mm mle 1917 Saumur img 2313.jpg File:Howitzer 155 mm mle 1917 Saumur img 2310.jpg File:Howitzer 155 mm mle 1917 Saumur img 2312.jpg File:Kanon 155C-1917 Halen 18-08-2019 13-11-36.jpg Canon de 155 C modèle 1917 Schneider The French Army preferred bagged charges for its ammunition because the brass cartridge cases used by the Mle 1915 were expensive to produce, both in money and in the amount of brass required. This became a real problem during the war given the vast number of shells expended and Schneider was asked to redesign the gun to use a de Bange obturator and allow it to use bagged powder. Schneider agreed and adapted the breech of the Canon de 155mm GPF to fit the barrel of the Mle 1915, but this took quite a bit of time due to the press of existing work and the new Mle 1917 howitzer didn't enter service until late 1916. The main difference between the Mle 1915 and 1917 was in the breech. Many guns had their loading trays removed because it slowed down the rate of fire; a portable shell tray was used instead by the loaders. Some three thousand were built.Hogg, p. 96 Additionally, many of the Mle 1915s were refitted with the new breech.Hogg, p. 95-6 Operators and service France During World War I it became the standard heavy howitzer of the French Army during the later stages of the war. 1943 were still in service with France in 1939. The Germans designated guns that fell into their hands as the 15.5 cm sFH 414(f).Gander and Chamberlain, p. 218 Argentina The Argentine Army used two variants of this gun, locally called Obús Schneider L.15.05 modelo 1928calibre 155 mm and Obús Schneider L.30.05 modelo 1928 calibre 155 mm. Some of them were still used for training in the 1980s at the Colegio Militar de la Nación. Some were donated to neighboring countries. Australia No 675, mounted at Tarcutta, New South Wales Eighteen American guns were issued to the 2/1st Field Regiment, Royal Australian Artillery in the Middle East during December 1941. All were brought back to Australia when the regiment returned in 1942. Three guns are believed to be in various displays and memorials. Belgium Belgium received 134 howitzers from France during World War I. Weapons captured after Belgium's surrender in 1940 received the designation of 15.5 cm sFH 413(b) by the Germans. Bolivia The Bolivian Army received in 1976 a donation of 16 howitzers from the Argentine Army. Corresponding to both models used in Argentina and known as Obús Schneider L.15.05 modelo 1928calibre 155 mm and Obús Schneider L.30.05 modelo 1928 calibre 155 mm. The shipment consisted of 2 batteries (each with 4 pieces) from each model. The guns are still in service in the artillery regiments ReA-2 \\"BOLÍVAR\\" (1st MECHANIZED BRIGADE) and RA-3 \\"PISAGUA\\" (3rd ARMY DIVISION). Finland Finnish howitzers being used in a firing exercise, 1981 Schneider sold four C15S and eight C17S howitzers to Finland during the 1920s, known in Finland as the 152 H/15 and 155 H/17. These were rebarreled in Finland's standard 152 mm although they retained their original breeches, which meant that the H/15 used Russian-style cartridge cases and the H/17 used bagged powder. The H/15 had steel-rimmed wooden wheels that were suitable only for horse-traction, but these were later replaced by wheels with sponge rubber tires more suitable for motor traction. They were used for training during peacetime. During the Winter War the H/15s served with the 3rd Separate Heavy Artillery Battery while the H/17s were assigned to Heavy Artillery Battalion 3. During the Continuation War they saw combat with Heavy Artillery Battalions 24 and 25 as well as Field Artillery Regiment 3. They were retired after the end of World War II. Germany sold a total of 166 captured howitzers to Finland, the first batch of 15 arriving in October 1940 and 147 arriving over the course of 1941. The last four arrived in 1944. They were heavily used during the Continuation War, serving with five heavy artillery battalions and eight field artillery battalions. Only 14 were lost to the Soviets in 1944. The remaining howitzers were used for live-fire training and warehoused for future use. New twin pneumatic wheels were fitted during the 1960s, and the guns were retained through the 1980s for live-fire training. Germany Exactly how many howitzers were captured by Germany in the early years of World War II is not known, but Germany sold a number to Finland, reinforced the Atlantic Wall with 100 and equipped second-line infantry and static divisions based in France such as the 331st, 709th, 711th, and the 716th. Greece Greece had a total of 96 howitzers when the Greco-Italian War began in October 1940. They were assigned to the corps-level heavy artillery battalions. Italy seized them after Greece surrendered in May 1941. Italy Italy captured 8 during the Battle of France and 96 from Greece during the Balkan Campaign and placed them into service as the Obice da 155/14 PB. Howitzer seized by Germany after Italy's surrender in 1943 were placed into service as the 15.5 cm sFH 414(i). Philippines At the outbreak of the Pacific War in 1941, the Philippines was an American colony and its military was armed by the US. The colonial army's heavy field artillery unit, the 301st FA Regiment which fought in Bataan, was equipped with GPFs and two 155 mm howitzers—which were reportedly fitted with wooden wheels. These American-made French-designed artillery pieces arrived in the Philippines on 14 October 1941, along with fifty halftracks fitted with 75 mm guns. Although the Japanese are confirmed to have used captured GPFs against the Americans when they returned to the Philippines, their use of captured 155 mm howitzers remains unconfirmed. One howitzer, which is fitted with a modified straight shield and a non-standard barrel, survived the war and is on permanent static display at the Philippine Military Academy. Poland C17S howitzers were used by the Polish allied Blue Army in France, which returned to Poland after the end of World War I. Poland acquired a number of howitzers from France then, and it became Polish main heavy howitzer during the Polish–Soviet War 1919-1921. They designated it as the 155 mm haubica wz. 1917 (howitzer 1917 pattern). In October 1920 there were 206 of them. Other orders followed, and Poland bought a license as well. Some 44 were manufactured in late 1930s in Zakłady Starachowickie in Starachowice. 340 were in service in September 1939 when the Germans invaded.Konstankiewicz, Andrzej (2003). Broń strzelecka i sprzęt artyleryjski formacji polskich i Wojska Polskiego w latach 1914-1939, Lublin. pp. 45, 81, 131, 250-266. . It was the only heavy howitzer in Polish Army in 1939. Each of 30 Polish active infantry divisions had a horse-drawn heavy artillery detachment with three 155 mm howitzers and three 105 mm guns (they were absent in reserve divisions). There were also twelve heavy artillery detachments of C-in-C reserve, each with twelve howitzers in three four-gun batteries. The rest were in reserve. Captured Polish howitzers were taken into German service as the 15.5 cm sFH 17(p). None were used in Poland after the war. Portugal Portugal acquired a battery of 4 pieces in the World War I integrated in the Portuguese Expeditionary Corps. They were retired in 1945. Romania 12 were received in 1917 and an unknown number were received from German captured in World War 2 and equipped a heavy artillery motorized regiment. Imperial Russia/USSR  Some were sold to Russia during the war, but nothing is known of numbers or their use. Apparently the Soviets rebarreled surviving howitzers to use their standard 152 mm cased ammunition, the Germans gave them the designation 15.2 cm sFH 449(r), but none seemed to be on hand on 22 June 1941 at the start of Operation Barbarossa. According to some sources, the Soviets also captured 111 Polish 155 mm howitzers during the Soviet invasion of Poland in September 1939.Kurus, Adam; Janicki, Paweł (2014). Haubica 155 mm wz. 1917. Series \\"Wielki Leksykon Uzbrojenia. Wrzesień 1939\\" No.27. Edipresse Polska. p.54. . Spain The first guns were procured in France in 1917, the weapon being declared standard for Army use in November 1922, although their first military use was in Africa in 1921 during the assault at Turiet Hamed. The gun was also built under license at Trubia and was used by the Regimientos de Artillería Pesados (Heavy Artillery Regiments). One was captured by revolutionaries in the Trubia factory during the Asturian miners' strike of 1934, although it was ineffective due to the lack of fuzing for their shells; the gun was damaged when a dynamite cartridge bundle used as substitute for fuzeless shells exploded inside. The gun was heavily used during the Spanish Civil War by both sides. During the SCW and World War II some guns were used as coastal defence weapons to improve Spanish coastal defences as nothing more suitable was available. It remained in service until the 1950s when they were replaced by more modern equipment. There are many surviving pieces, of Spanish and French construction, in museums and as monuments around Spain.Mortera A, Infiesta J L. La Máquina y La Historia Nº15: La artillería en la Guerra Civil.

About one hundred modernized M1918 howitzers were supplied to the United Kingdom under the Lend-Lease program. They began to arrive in the North African theater at the end of 1941 and equipped medium regiments of the Royal Artillery serving in the Eighth Army. United States Newsreel footage of a US battery in action in France, 1918 Prior to 1917, the United States had used a 6-inch howitzer of a different design, but discarded it as unsatisfactory in favor of this French gun which the US found had withstood the tests of war and had proven in every way to be superior to all other howitzers of the same or similar caliber.Facts found by the US Court of Claims in the case Olsson v. United States, published at 25 F. Supp 495 (1938) The United States purchased 1,503 examples of the Mle 1917 from France and adopted it as the 155 mm Howitzer Carriage, Model of 1917 (Schneider), as the standard or regulation howitzer for the United States Army. The last American shot fired during the Great War was fired by a Schneider howitzer called Calamity Jane, of the 11th Field Artillery Regiment. The United States also paid $560,000 for non-exclusive rights to the design and working drawings. In addition to the 1,503 examples purchased in France and used there, 626 were manufactured by or for the US in the United States (stated to have been at a cost of more than $10,000,000). The Model 1918 built in the US differed somewhat from French models, with a straight rather than curved shield, rubber rather than steel tyres on wheels, a pivoting spade and a slightly different firing mechanism.Handbook of artillery, pp. 207, 211 US units were in action in France in 1918 with the 1,503 French-built guns. The first US regiment equipped with US-made guns was about to embark for France when World War I ended.Brown, pp. 61, 65 The 1,503 weapons purchased from France were brought to the United States in 1919. Both the M1917 and M1918 howitzers were upgraded with air brakes, new metal wheels and pneumatic tires during the interwar period and remained the standard American heavy howitzers until superseded by the 155 mm howitzer M1 beginning in late 1942. They saw limited use with both U.S. Army and Marine artillery units while shortages of the 155 mm howitzer M1 were resolved. Yugoslavia Thirty six C17S's were in Yugoslav service by the 1920s although it is unclear whether these were weapons furnished to Serbia during World War I or bought by Yugoslavia during the 1920s. The Germans designated guns that fell into their hands as the 15.5cm H 427(j).

Early life Collisson was born in Lucan, Ontario in 1875. He was educated there and in London, Ontario, and moved to Edmonton to teach in 1898. He remained there until 1903, when he moved to Dawson, Yukon. He taught there for two years, and returned to Edmonton in 1905. He joined the law form Short, Cross and Bigger (of which former and future mayor William Short was a partner) as a student at law. He was admitted to the Law Society of Alberta in 1908. He served on Edmonton's public school board from 1908 until 1913. Municipal politics Collisson first sought municipal office in the 1916 municipal election, when he ran for alderman on Edmonton City Council. He finished eighth of eleven, which wasn't high enough to be elected (only the top six candidates were elected in that election). He was more successful in 1920, when he finished fourth of sixteen candidates and was elected to a two-year term. He was re- elected in 1922 (when he finished fifth of sixteen candidates) and 1924 (when he finished second of eleven). He cut short his third term in order to run for mayor in the 1925 election, but finished second in a six candidate race as incumbent Kenny Blatchford took more than fifty-five percent of the vote. He returned to politics in the 1928 election, when he returned to his old position on the strength of a sixth-place finish in a fourteen candidate field. He was re-elected in the 1930 election, when he finished third of nine candidates, but left municipal politics for good at the conclusion of this term. On council, he chaired the finance committee. Provincial politics Collisson ran for the Legislative Assembly of Alberta as a Liberal candidate in the 1930 provincial election. He finished eighth of seventeen candidates in the riding of Edmonton, and was eliminated on subsequent counts (the riding used a single transferable vote voting system at the time). Personal life, death, and legacy After leaving politics, Collisson served as the president of Edmonton's community chest from 1941 until 1948. James Collisson died July 30, 1962. He was survived by his wife, Irene, one son and two daughters, and eight grandchildren.

Production of the baseline 57 mm Mark 1 variant began in 1966 and was initially used to equip smaller coastal patrol craft and fast attack craft. The gun is remotely controlled by a fire-control computer; as a redundancy measure, however, the crew can also operate the gun using instrument panels that are either on or in direct contact with the gun. Although the Swedish Navy is the primary user of the gun, it has been exported widely by Bofors Defence for use by the navies of Brunei, Canada, Croatia, Finland, Indonesia, Ireland, Malaysia, Mexico, Montenegro, Singapore, Thailand and the United States. The gun was upgraded and improved several times, first the Mark 2 in 1981 which drastically lowered the weight as well as introduced new servo stabilizers. The Mark 3 came in 1995 with modifications made to enable the smart ammunition developed. Design and development The Bofors 40 mm L/60 AA gun (1.6 inch) was one of the most popular naval anti-aircraft guns during World War II, used long after the war in a variety of roles. However, as jet aircraft became more prevalent in the post-war era, it was clear the gun did not have the rate of fire needed to effectively deal with these threats. Flying at speeds close to , a jet aircraft flew through the effective range of the Bofors 40 mm gun in too short a time for the gun to fire enough rounds to ensure a hit. Bofors' engineers considered two solutions to the problem. One was to greatly increase the firing speed of the 40 while also incorporating any minor changes that would improve its range. This produced the 40 mm L70, which remains popular to this day. The other was to design a larger weapon with much greater effective range and a larger explosive load that offset a lower firing rate. This was based on the existing 57 mm lvakan M/50 design, likewise upgraded for more range and higher firing rates. This design became the 57 mm L70 gun. The baseline version of the Bofors gun was the Mark 1, first introduced into service with the Spica-class fast attack craft of the Swedish Navy in 1966, it has a rate of fire of 200 rounds per minute and a 40-round magazine in the gun mount with a further 128 rounds stowed inside. With minor modifications, the Mark 1 guns could use ammunition developed for the Mark 2 gun. The Mark 2 was designed in 1981 but introduced into service with the —HSwMS Stockholm in 1985 (sister ship HSwMS Malmö was built in 1984 but armed with the older Mk 1, subsequently retrofitted with the Mk 2 in 2009), the rate of fire was slightly increased to 220 rounds per minute. Also, it featured a new light weight gun mount with a new gun barrel that was forged from monobloc steel (this eliminated the need to use a water jacket for gun barrel cooling during firing) and a new servo drive/servomechanism system (for faster reaction time and better gun aiming and control). According to Bofors, the new servo system allowed the Mk 2 to be both accurate and agile enough for use against sea skimming anti-ship missiles and that it could put more explosives into a surface target within a thirty- second window than any naval gun with a calibre smaller than . The latest development is the Mark 3, which was designed in 1995 but introduced into service with the —fitted on in 2000. This new design retained the Mark 2 gun mount, rate of fire and ammunition capacity and has another 1,000 rounds stowed in the standby rack beneath deck. A small radome has been added above the gun barrel and is used for measuring the muzzle velocity of the departing projectiles for fire-control purposes, usually but not necessarily with the new Bofors 57 mm 3P all-target programmable ammunition. Also, a new optional low radar profile (also known as low radar cross-section, or RCS) stealth mounting was developed, this allows the gun to be hidden from radar and plain sight when not in use. In American service, the United States Navy has designated the Mark 3 as the Mark 110 Mod 0 57mm gun. According to a BAE Systems press release dated 1 August 2005, the Mark 110 would be manufactured at the BAE Systems facility in Louisville, Kentucky. BAE Systems has been awarded a contract by General Dynamics to provide two additional Mk110 Naval Gun Systems for the Independence variant of the US Navy's (USN's) Littoral Combat Ship (LCS). While the 57 mm cannon may not seem as powerful as larger naval guns, such as the OTO Melara 76 mm, some of its performances are comparable; given its rate of fire and amount of explosive per shell, the Bofors gun actually achieves a higher amount of \\"explosive fired per second\\" than the 76 mm.French Navy FTI Frigate: From 57mm to 127mm, Naval Gun System Choice Still Open - Navyrecognition.com, 28 October 2016 Ammunition Sailors load ammunition aboard Ammunition for the Bofors 57 mm gun is produced by Bofors, Sako Limited in Finland, SME Ordnance in Malaysia and Nammo in Norway. In 2006, BAE Systems AB began to offer the Bofors 57 mm 3P all-target programmable ammunition, this allows three proximity fuzing modes as well as settings for time, impact, and armor-piercing functions. This increases the flexibility and effectiveness of the gun system, which has further reduced the reaction time of the gun and it is possible to choose ammunition mode at the moment of firing, giving it the ability to switch rapidly between surface targets, air targets, and ground targets. In April 2015, BAE Systems unveiled a new round for the Mk 110 in the design stage called the Mk 295 Mod 1 Ordnance for Rapid Kill of Attack Craft (ORKA), made to achieve one shot kills of surface and air threats. Answering a U.S. Navy requirement for increasing the accuracy and efficiency of naval rounds, the ORKA leverages technology BAE Systems developed for larger 127 mm and 155 mm guided rounds, using a 4-canard actuation systems to guide the round. It is fitted with a multi-mode imaging semi-active seeker that can be guided through laser designation or autonomous targeting by downloading image of the target prior to firing; ORKA retains the 3P multiple fuzing modes.BAE Systems Unveils the ORKA One Shot One Kill Round for 57mm Gun at Sea-Air-Space 2015 - Navyrecognition.com, 14 April 2015 In December 2015, the U.S. Navy revealed they were working on developing a guided 57 mm round for its Mk 110 guns on the Littoral Combat Ship and other Navy and Coast Guard ships.A Year Into Distributed Lethality, Navy Nears Fielding Improved Weapons, Deploying Surface Action Group - News.USNI.org, 13 January 2016 On 22 August 2017 L3 Mustang Technology announced the completion of the Critical Design Review (CDR) phase for the U.S. Navy's MK 332 Mod 0 High- Explosive, 4-Bolt Guided (HE-4G) projectile. The round was developed from the Advanced Low Cost Munitions Ordnance program. It's intend for use on the LCS and the new fast Frigate, and the US Coast Guard's Legend and Heritage class cutters. Variants ;Bofors 57 mm Mk 1 Bofors developed the Mark 1 from the Bofors 57 mm/L60 in 1962. Improvements included a higher rate of fire, the use of new munitions including an improved proximity fuse, water cooling for the gun tubes and a new electro-hydraulic system for rapid training and elevation. Finland, Malaysia, Norway, Indonesia, Singapore and (the former) Yugoslavia are among the countries that adopted the Mark 1. ;Bofors 57 mm Mk 2 The Mark 2 was a lighter weight version, which utilized a new servo system. Bofors designed the gun in 1981 and it entered active service on the in 1985. The gun was partly dual-purpose in the sense that it is accurate and agile enough to destroy sea-skimming missiles. Bofors manufactured a total of about 25 Mk 2 guns. Hanko ;Bofors 57 mm Mk 3 The Mark 3 is the latest version of the gun. Bofors designed it in 1996 and it entered service in 2000. The gun uses smart ammunition but can also fire the same ammunition as the Mk 2. The stealth variant has a reduced radar profile, in part by hiding the gun barrel when it is not firing. Also, the gun has a small radar mounted on the gun barrel to measure muzzle velocity for fire control purposes and can change ammunition types instantly due to a dual-feed system. Gun can also be operated/fired manually without the FC system using a joystick and video camera (mounted on gun). ;Mk 110 57 mm gun Essentially a slightly modified Mark 3, it was offered for use by the United States Coast Guard in 2004 and the United States Navy in 2006.

RGP4 regulates G protein signaling.  Function  Regulator of G protein signalling (RGS) family members are regulatory molecules that act as GTPase activating proteins (GAPs) for G alpha subunits of heterotrimeric G proteins. RGS proteins are able to deactivate G protein subunits of the Gi alpha, Go alpha and Gq alpha subtypes. They drive G proteins into their inactive GDP-bound forms. Regulator of G protein signaling 4 belongs to this family. All RGS proteins share a conserved 120-amino acid sequence termed the RGS domain which conveys GAP activity. Regulator of G protein signaling 4 protein is 37% identical to RGS1 and 97% identical to rat Rgs4. This protein negatively regulates signaling upstream or at the level of the heterotrimeric G protein and is localized in the cytoplasm.  Clinical significance  A number of studies associate the RGS4 gene with schizophrenia, while some fail to detect an association. RGS4 is also of interest as one of the three main RGS proteins (along with RGS9 and RGS17) involved in terminating signalling by the mu opioid receptor, and may be important in the development of tolerance to opioid drugs.

They are published by Krause Publications, a division of Active Interest Media. Overview The by-century volumes list by date virtually every coin type, most of which are photographed, with mintage and other information, plus market valuations in up to 5 grades. Listings are by denomination rather than series, as in earlier World coin catalogs. The proprietary Krause-Mishler (or KM) numbers are widely used; for just a few countries earlier systems such as Y (Yeoman) and C (Craig) numbers are given instead. The century format is often considered inconvenient and expensive for those who collect geographically, and date listings are clipped at the century mark. Originally covering 1835 or so to date, the main catalog (first edition 1972) evolved into an annual 20th century-only work, plus separate 17th, 18th, and 19th century volumes which are revised on a three-year cycle. Beginning with the 34th (2007) ed, listings covering 2001 to date are included in a separate 21st Century catalog. Data from the by-century volumes are collated together in special editions for Crowns, Gold, German, and North American coins. Fantasies and medallion issues, which do not appear in the other catalogs, are covered in a publication called Unusual World Coins. There is also a publication called Collecting World Coins that includes only 20th- and 21st-century coins that circulated regularly. The 12th (1986) and 19th (1992) are two-volume hardcovers covering 1700-date; 13th (1987) is the last edition to include cross-references to Yeoman and Craig; 23rd (1996) is the last main edition covering 1800-date; 33rd (2006) is the last 20th century edition including 21st century listings. List priced at $73 to $85 ($25 for the shorter 21st century catalog) they are often discounted, and can be found in many public libraries. Older editions are steeply discounted even though revisions between editions in many areas are minimal. Following the appearance of unlicensed DVD versions, DVDs were included with the 1601-1700 4th edition, the 1901-2000 36th edition, and possibly others, but are now sold as a separate product. In 1975, the Catalog comprised a single volume with about 1,000 pages. By 2007, it had expanded to a five-volume set with more than 6,000 pages in total. Early editions attribute authorship to the publisher Chester L. Krause, and Clifford Mishler, although starting with the second edition Colin R. Bruce II was the actual chief compiler and is given an editor or senior editor title on later editions. According to Coin World, Bruce was the lead cataloger and editor of every annual edition from 1976 through 2007, retiring in 2008. George S. Cuhaj is the current editor, with Thomas Michael credited as market analyst, although Krause collate contributions from many collecting experts and dealers.

For background see History of Sino-Russian relations. Like many later Russian ambassadors to China (Nicolae Milescu, Sava Vladislavich) he left a detailed account of his journey. In 1654 Tsar Alexis sent Baykov to the court of the Shunzhi Emperor to negotiate a treaty establishing regular trade between Moscow and Beijing. (The first Russian to reach Peking was probably Ivan Petlin in 1618, but he was not properly an ambassador.) At this time the Manchu Qing Dynasty had just been established and Russian adventurers had just entered the Amur River valley from the north, but the Manchus apparently did not understand that these barbarians from beyond Mongolia were the same as those who were raiding their northern frontier. The Russians of course knew the connection, but gave Baykov no instructions for dealing with the Amur problem. He was, however, instructed to make obeisance to no one but the emperor himself. Before leaving Tobolsk, he sent Setkul Ablin ahead as messenger. Ablin reached Peking in late 1655, sold his trade goods and returned in the spring of 1656, passing, but not meeting, Baykov's party. After a long stay at Tobolsk, Baykov's mission set out in June or autumn of 1654. He traveled up the Irtysh River across Dzungaria and the Gobi Desert. In 1655 they reached Kalgan on the Great Wall. Here he was stopped by the Chinese who did not know who he was (they thought Ablin had been the real ambassador). After receiving permission, he reached the Forbidden City on 3 March 1656. He refused to kowtow at the city gate, but was admitted anyway and was housed by the Li-Fan Yuan. He insisted that his presents and credentials be presented to the emperor himself and in general did not behave with proper submissiveness to the great Chinese emperor. After several months of isolation, he was expelled from China's capital (in 1657 or 4 September 1656 ) and reached Moscow the following year. References *Mancall, Mark.

Johnson notes that membership statistics were imprecise and probably inflated, since they were based on the membership statistics of constituent organizations, without taking into account the fact that some individuals belonged to more than one organization. A professional movement, the NGAA promoted German language instruction in school, the foundation of educational societies, including the German American Historical Society, and the publication of histories and journals to demonstrate \\"the role German-Americans had played in the development of the United States.\\"Tolzmann, Don Heinrich (2000).

Quoted in: Gomez, Andrea, Von Steuben Monument, section \\"Sponsor: National German- American Alliance\\" (National Park Service, Valley Forge National Historical Park), retrieved 2015-01-02. History The formation of the NGAA was supported by existing state and local German-American organizations, as well as the German-American press. In particular, a state-level umbrella group of German-American organizations in Pennsylvania, the German-American Central Alliance of Pennsylvania (Deutsch-Amerikanischer Zentral-Bund von Pennsylvanien), founded in 1899, provided the impetus for the formation of a national organization.Johnson (1999), p. 7-9. On June 19, 1900, the Pennsylvania group, under the leadership of its president, Charles J. Hexamer, hosted a meeting in Philadelphia of representatives from German-American organizations in Maryland, Minnesota, Ohio, and Pennsylvania.Johnson (1999), p. 9. This core group, chaired by Hexamer, subsequently organized a larger meeting in Philadelphia the following year, on October 6, during the celebration of what was known as German Day, commemorating the arrival of the first German settlers in America. At that meeting, in 1901, the NGAA was officially founded by 39 delegates representing German-American organizations in 12 states and the District of Columbia. The original delegates were primarily people of higher educational and social classes, and were from diverse professional backgrounds, including education, business, and the arts. In general the organization drew its initial support from intellectual elites, with no discernible presence of groups such as farmers, craftsmen, or factory workers.Johnson (1999), p. 10, 15. The NGAA was given a United States congressional charter in 1907. Cultural activities In 1901 the NGAA took an important step toward furthering its cultural goals with the founding of the Philadelphia-based German American Historical Society, which together with the NGAA sponsored the journal Americana Germanica as its official organ.Kazal (2004), p. 134-135.Johnson (1998), p. 12-13. Edited by Marion Dexter Learned, a professor of German at the University of Pennsylvania, the journal was devoted to scholarship in German-American studies, including literary, linguistic, and cultural matters, and also published American-written articles in the general field of Germanics; it became known as German-American Annals beginning in 1903, and continued until 1919.Americana Germanica had appeared since 1897.

Some of the issues are available full-text online through Harvard University Library: . Retrieved 2015-06-08. Political issues, prohibition Besides its primary activities focusing on the preservation of German culture in the United States, the NGAA had by 1903 also begun to venture into political issues affecting German Americans and German-American culture, while refraining from endorsing particular political candidates. Specifically, it sought to bolster support for the offering of German-language instruction in public schools; it opposed restriction on immigration (a position that formed a tenet in its constitution); and it opposed the prohibition movement.Johnson (1999), p. 17-19. The issue of prohibition rose to the status of a top priority at the NGAA convention in Baltimore, in 1903. Although there was no connection at that time between the organization and brewing companies, it subsequently drew the attention and support of the brewing industry,Johnson (1999), p. 22 including the United States Brewers' Association. As American anti-German hysteria boiled over upon American entry into the war in 1917, brewing activity received considerable attention with regard to the possibility of disloyalty to the American war cause. The Anti-Saloon League and other dry organizations recognized the unique opportunity presented to them by the anti-German sentiment, and mobilized to attack the vulnerable position of native German brewers in American society. With increased frequency the Anti-Saloon League played on public opinion to question the loyalties of German brewers, shrewdly linking breweries to a list of institutions whose right to exist had been called into question in the midst of the growing anti-German hysteria. During the first decade of the twentieth century the Cincinnati German-American community began a campaign to counter the rapid rise in prohibition sentiment. The organization held events such as in Cincinnati on July 21, 1907, when the German-American Alliance held a public gathering at Coney Island dubbed \\"Puritanism against Liberalism.\\" In the view of local Germans, the issue was a simple matter of freedom, one of particular importance to immigrants who had left behind an oppressive homeland. Cincinnati brewers and German-American societies combined to demonstrate the extent to which Prohibition would harm the industry as well as the national economy. An October 1910 publication of the Deutsche Schutzen- Gesellschaft of Covington noted that the government received approximately $80,000,000 in taxes from beer sales the year before. The clear implication was that the termination of such vital activity, involving over 1,500 breweries and 50,000 employees in the case of national prohibition, would have dire consequences for all involved. Demise In an atmosphere of rising anti-German sentiment, the NGAA’s outspokenness against prohibition, its stance for neutrality during World War I, and its support of Germany, especially its practice of raising money for German war relief, led to its charter being revoked in 1918, following a Senate investigation. Congress passed a bill to revoke the charter in July, and President Wilson signed the measure into law on August 31.Gomez, Andrea (undated). von Stueben Monument, section \\"Sponsor: National German-American Alliance.\\" National Park Service.

Successor  A later organization known as the German American Citizens League of the United States (Deutschamerikanischer Bürgerbund der Vereinigten Staaten) considered itself a successor to the NGAA, and shared many of the same goals. Like the NGAA, the League promoted the German language, literature, traditions, music and character, and sought to \\"provide for the adequate representation of the German-American element in the public life of the United States.\\" In 1923, it \\"aimed to prevent another war between this country and Germany.\\" The League was open only to US citizens who obligated themselves to vote if physically possible.

This gun's design was influenced by German 88 mm Pak 43/41 anti-tank guns captured by the U.S. Army in France. The development started in October 1944; the gun reached trials in February 1946. Soon afterwards the project was cancelled. Design In December, 1942, Allied forces reported that new German armored vehicle designs were resistant to 57 mm anti-tank guns, the largest anti-tank gun available. The US Ordnance Department began preliminary studies on a gun design similar to the German 88 mm Pak 43/41 anti-aircraft gun which was then successfully being used as an anti-tank gun. The first proposal was a combination of the 90 mm M1 Anti-aircraft gun mated to the M2 recoil mechanism from the M2A1 105 mm howitzer. The example was designated 90 mm anti-tank gun T8 on carriage T5. pp 40-42 The T5 gun carriage proved unacceptable due to structural weaknesses found while towing off-road. After two redesigned carriages were tested, the T5E2 was classified as limited standard. After additional trials at Aberdeen Proving Grounds, the T8 gun was found to be too heavy. Alternative carriages were tested, with no carriage found acceptable. Two new gun/carriages were proposed and tested. The final design selected was the T20E1 gun with the T15 carriage. Three T8 guns were completed in 1944, and a production batch of 400 was ordered. One of the three guns was sent to Europe with the Zebra mission in February, 1945. The Zebra team was sent to the ETO to respond to the criticism of the inadequate anti- tank guns that were then in service. In early 1945 the entire anti-tank gun issue was re-examined to evaluate the need for large-bore anti-tank guns, as the need in the Pacific did not exist as Japanese armor could easily be penetrated by 37 mm and 57 mm M1 anti-tank guns then available. The Panzerkampfwagen Tiger Ausf. B (King Tiger) and Panzerjäger Tiger Ausf. B (Jagdtiger) were found to be armored beyond the anti-tank guns then in use or proposed. Work was started on a 105 mm version of the T8 using the T19 split trail carriage in October 1944. The T8 105 mm anti-tank gun weighed about eight tons. It had a split trail carriage and magnesium wheels with synthetic rubber tires. In transportation, the mount could be rotated 180 degrees in order to reduce the length of the piece. The gun fired a 17.7 kg (39 lbs) armor-piercing projectile at 945 m/s (3,100 ft/s), resulting in the penetration of 210 mm (8.26 in) at 1,000 m (1,093 yds), 0 degrees. Display Two pilot guns and carriages were built; one of those is on display in the United States Army Ordnance Museum, Aberdeen, Maryland, United States.

The term may also be applied to methods for catching other aquatic animals such as molluscs (shellfish, squid, octopus) and edible marine invertebrates. Fishing techniques include hand-gathering, spearfishing, netting, angling and trapping. Recreational, commercial and artisanal fishers use different techniques, and also, sometimes, the same techniques. Recreational fishers fish for pleasure or sport, while commercial fishers fish for profit. Artisanal fishers use traditional, low-tech methods, for survival in developing countries, and as a cultural heritage in other countries. Mostly, recreational fishers use angling methods and commercial fishers use netting methods. There is an intricate link between various fishing techniques and knowledge about the fish and their behaviour including migration, foraging and habitat. The effective use of fishing techniques often depends on this additional knowledge.Keegan, William F (1986) The Optimal Foraging Analysis of Horticultural Production American Anthropologist, New Series, Vol. 88, No. 1., pp. 92-107. Which techniques are appropriate is dictated mainly by the target species and by its habitat.F.T.D. Website (2013) Fishing Tips and Techniques - Retrieved on 2013-24-07 Fishing techniques can be contrasted with fishing tackle. Fishing tackle refers to the physical equipment that is used when fishing, whereas fishing techniques refers to the manner in which the tackle is used when fishing. Hand- gathering It is possible to harvest many sea foods with minimal equipment by using the hands. Gathering seafood by hand can be as easy as picking shellfish or kelp up off the beach, or doing some digging for clams or crabs. The earliest evidence for shellfish gathering dates back to a 300,000-year-old site in France called Terra Amata. This is a hominid site as modern Homo sapiens did not appear in Europe until around 50,000 years ago.SzaboSzabo, Katherine Prehistoric Shellfish gathering. Ama diver in Japan * Flounder tramping - Every August, the small Scottish village of Palnackie hosts the world flounder tramping championships where flounder are captured by stepping on them. * Noodling: Practiced in the United States, mostly in the South. The noodler places his hand inside a catfish hole. If all goes as planned, the catfish swims forward and latches onto the noodler's hand, and can then be dragged out of the hole, albeit with risk of injury to the noodler.Snopes Urban Legend Website on Noodling * Pearl divers - traditionally harvested oysters by free-diving to depths of thirty metres. Today, free-diving recreational fishers catch lobster and abalone by hand. * Trout binning - Another method of taking trout. Rocks in a rocky stream are struck with a sledgehammer. The force of the blow stuns the fish.Trout binning in The Mirror of Literature, Amusement, and Instruction, Vol. 12, Issue 328, August 23, 1828, Project Gutenberg. * Trout tickling - In the British Isles, the practice of catching trout by hand is known as trout tickling; it is an art mentioned several times in the plays of Shakespeare. Spearfishing Spearfishing is an ancient method of fishing conducted with an ordinary spear or a specialised variant such as a harpoon, trident, arrow or eel spear.Image of an eel spear.Spear fishing for eels . Some fishing spears use slings (or rubber loops) to propel the spear. A Hupa man with his spear * Bowfishing - uses a bow and arrow to kill fish in shallow water from above. * Gigging - uses small trident type spears with long handles for gigging bullfrogs with a bright light at night, or for gigging suckers and other rough fish in shallow water. Gigging is popular in the American South and Midwest. * Hawaiian slings - have a sling separate from the spear, in the manner of an underwater bow and arrow. * Harpoons - Spearfishing with barbed poles was widespread in palaeolithic times.Guthrie, Dale Guthrie (2005) The Nature of Paleolithic Art. Page 298. University of Chicago Press. Cosquer Cave in Southern France contains cave art over 16,000 years old, including drawings of seals which appear to have been harpooned. * Pike pole fishing * Polespears - have a sling attached to the spear. * Modern spearguns - traditional spearfishing is restricted to shallow waters, but the development of the speargun has made the method much more efficient. With practice, divers are able to hold their breath for up to four minutes and sometimes longer. Of course, a diver with underwater breathing equipment can dive for much longer periods. * Tridents - are three- pronged spears. They are also called leisters or gigs. They are used for spear fishing and were formerly also a military weapon. They feature widely in early mythology and history. Netting Fishing nets are meshes usually formed by knotting a relatively thin thread. About 180 AD the Greek author Oppian wrote the Halieutica, a didactic poem about fishing. He described various means of fishing including the use of nets cast from boats, scoop nets held open by a hoop, and various traps \\"which work while their masters sleep\\". Netting is the principal method of commercial fishing, though longlining, trolling, dredging and traps are also used. A fisherman casting a net in Kerala, India Oil painting of gillnetting, The salmon fisher by Eilif Peterssen Pesca con el Sarambao (1847), a painting of salambáw fishermen in the Philippines * Cast nets - are round nets with small weights distributed around the edge. They are also called throw nets. The net is caste or thrown by hand in such a manner that it spreads out on the water and sinks. Fish are caught as the net is hauled back in.Dunbar, Jeffery A (2001) Casting net NC Coastal fishing. Retrieved 25 August 2008. This simple device has been in use, with various modifications, for thousands of years. * Drift nets - are nets which are not anchored. They are usually gillnets, and are commonly used in the coastal waters of many countries. Their use on the high seas is prohibited, but still occurs. * Ghost nets - are nets that have been lost at sea. They can be a menace to marine life for many years. * Gillnets - catch fish which try to pass through by snagging on the gill covers. Trapped, the fish can neither advance through the net nor retreat. * Haaf nets - mainly used in the Solway Firth forming part of the border between England and Scotland. Brought to Great Britain by the Vikings a thousand years ago, the technique involves the fisherman wading out to deep waters with a large rectangular net and waiting for salmon to swim into it. The fish is then scooped up by the raising of the net. * Hand nets - are small nets held open by a hoop. They have been used since antiquity. They are also called scoop nets, and are used for scooping up fish near the surface of the water. They may or may not have a handle–if they have a long handle they are called dip nets. When used by anglers to help land fish they are called landing nets.Fishing Tools - Landing Nets Because hand netting is not destructive to fish, hand nets are used for tag and release, or capturing aquarium fish. * Lift nets - are a method of fishing using nets that are submerged to a certain depth and then lifted out of the water vertically. The nets can be flat or shaped like a bag, a rectangle, a pyramid, or a cone. Lift nets can be hand-operated, boat-operated, or shore-operated. They typically use bait or a light-source as a fish-attractor. ** Cheena vala - are shore operated lift nets from India.Shore operated stationary lift nets Huge mechanical contrivances hold out horizontal nets with diameters of twenty metres or more. The nets are dipped into the water and raised again, but otherwise cannot be moved. Its name means \\"Chinese fishing net\\", though it originates from Southeast Asia. ** Salambaw - a type of traditional raft or barge-operated large lift nets from the Philippines. It utilizes a tall upright pole or a tower structure (timba) around in height. At the top of the pole are two large curving spars crossed with each other. A large square net is attached to the ends of these spars. The pole acts as a crane, it can be tilted to submerge the net using a weighted lever mechanism. The operator either pushes or pulls the lever, or climbs on it to bring it down with their body weight, thus raising the pole. A variation of the salambaw operated from large outrigger boats is known as basnigan. * Seine nets - are large fishing nets that can be arranged in different ways. In purse seining fishing the net hangs vertically in the water by attaching weights along the bottom edge and floats along the top. Danish seining is a method which has some similarities with trawling. A simple and commonly used fishing technique is beach seining, where the seine net is operated from the shore. * Surrounding nets - * Tangle nets - also known as tooth nets, are similar to gillnets except they have a smaller mesh size designed to catch fish by the teeth or upper jaw bone instead of by the gills.Selective Fishing Methods Washington Department of Fish and Wildlife. Retrieved 13 November 2011. * Trawl nets - are large nets, conical in shape, designed to be towed in the sea or along the sea bottom. The trawl is pulled through the water by one or more boats, called trawlers. The activity of pulling the trawl through the water is called trawling. Angling \\"Trolling for blue fish\\" lithograph by Currier & Ives, 1866 Fishermen using jiggerpoles for jigging from the Queenscliff pier Angling is a method of fishing by means of an \\"angle\\" (hook). The hook is usually attached to a line, and is sometimes weighed down by a sinker so it sinks in the water. This is the classic \\"hook, line and sinker\\" arrangement, used in angling since prehistoric times. The hook is usually baited with lures or bait fish. Additional arrangements include the use of a fishing rod, which can be fitted with a reel, and functions as a delivery mechanism for casting the line. Other delivery methods for projecting the line include fishing kites and cannons, kontiki rafts and remote controlled devices. Floats can also be used to help set the line or function as bite indicators. The hook can be dressed with lures or bait. Angling is the principal method of sport fishing, but commercial fisheries also use angling methods involving multiple hooks, such as longlining or commercial trolling. Line fishing Line fishing is fishing with a fishing line. A fishing line is any cord made for fishing. Important parameters of a fishing line are its length, material, and weight (thicker, sturdier lines are more visible to fish). Factors that may determine what line an angler chooses for a given fishing environment include breaking strength, knot strength, UV resistance, castability, limpness, stretch, abrasion resistance, and visibility. Modern fishing lines are usually made from artificial substances. The most common type is monofilament, made of a single strand. There are also braided fishing lines and thermally fused superlines. * Droplining - a dropline consists of a long fishing line set vertically down into the water, with a series of baited hooks Droplines have a weight at the bottom and a float at the top. They are not usually as long as longlines and have fewer hooks. * Handlining - is fishing with a single fishing line, baited with lures or bait fish, which is held in the hands. Handlining can be done from boats or from the shore. It is used mainly to catch groundfish and squid, but smaller pelagic fish can also be caught. * Pahila - is a traditional method of shoreline trolling in the Philippines. It uniquely uses baited hooks tied to a laterally flattened float called palyaw shaped like a small outrigger boat, a catamaran, or a fish. A long line is attached to the float. It is set unto the water's edge and dragged by someone running or walking along the beach. The combination of the water resistance and the diagonal pull forces the float outwards into deeper waters, like a kite. Once it reaches its maximum line length, it moves rapidly parallel to the person pulling it along the beach. It is pulled back to the shore intermittently to check for catches. Pahila literally means \\"pulled\\". It is also called , , , , hilada, or , among other names, in other Philippine languages. * Jiggerpole - is a method of fishing for bass. It's built on using a cane pole with the line of at least 30lb. test, tied well down at the pole of about three quarters length in the typical cane pole manner, and then securely at the tip with about a foot to foot and a half length to drop in the water. Place a swivel on the end of the line. The trick is to linger the lure in a specific area going back and forth, maneuvering the tip of the cane pole in the water causing a noise to attract a bass to see a jig getting after a ripple of water the pole tip is causing. * Jigging - is the practice of fishing with a jig, a type of fishing lure. A jig consists of a lead sinker with a hook molded into it and usually covered by a soft body to attract fish. Jigs are intended to create a jerky, vertical motion, as opposed to spinnerbaits which move through the water horizontally. * Longlining - is a commercial technique that uses a long heavy fishing line with a series of hundreds or even thousands of baited hooks hanging from the main line by means of branch lines called \\"snoods\\". Longlines are usually operated from specialised boats called longliners. They use a special winch to haul in the line, and can operate in deeper waters targeting pelagic species such as swordfish, tuna, halibut and sablefish. Slab * Slabbing: is a bass fishing technique, that involves repetitively lifting and dropping a flat lure, usually made of 1 to 2.5 oz of lead painted to look like a baitfish (or heavy slabs of metal), through a school of actively feeding fish that the angler has located on a fishfinder. Used on white and striped bass in the reservoirs of the southern USA. * Trolling - is fishing with one or more baited lines which are drawn through the water. This may be done by pulling the line behind a slow moving boat, or by slowly winding the line in when fishing from the land. Trolling is used to catch pelagic fish such as mackerel and kingfish. * Trotlining - a trotline is like a dropline, except that a dropline has a series of hooks suspended vertically in the water, while a trotline has a series of hooks suspended horizontally in the water. Trotlines can be physically set in many ways, such as tying each end to something fixed, and adjusting the set of the rest of the line with weights and floats. They are used for catching crabs or fish, such as catfish, particularly across rivers. Angling with a rod Angling with a rod. Muriwai Beach, New Zealand An angler in his float tube plays a hooked pike. Fishing rods give more control of the fishing line. The rod is usually fitted with a fishing reel which functions as a mechanism for storing, retrieving and paying out the line. Floats may also be used, and can function as bite indicators. The hook can be dressed with lures or bait. * Bank fishing - fishing from river banks and similar shorelines. Bank fishing is usually performed with a fishing rod and reel, although nets, traps, and spears can also be used. People who fish from a boat can sometimes access more areas in prime locations with greater ease than bank fishermen. However many people don't own boats and find fishing from the bank has its own advantages. Bank fishing has its own requirements, and many things come into play for success, such as local knowledge, water depth, bank structure, location, time of day, and the type of bait and lures. * Casting - the act of throwing the fishing line out over the water using a flexible fishing rod. The usual technique is for the angler to quickly flick the rod from behind toward the water. Casting is also a sport adjunct to fishing, much as shooting is to hunting. The sport is supervised by the International Casting Sport Federation, which sponsors tournaments and recognizes world records for accuracy and distance. Some variations of the technique exist, such as Surf fishing, the Reach cast, and Spey casting. * Float tubes - small doughnut-shaped boats with an underwater seat in the \\"hole\\". Float tubes are used for fly fishing and enable the angler to reach deeper water without splashing and disturbing stillwater fish. * Fly fishing - the use of artificial flies as lures. These are cast with specially constructed fly rods and fly lines. The fly line (today, almost always coated with plastic) is heavy enough cast in order to send the fly to the target. Artificial flies vary dramatically in size, weight and colour. Fly fishing is a distinct and ancient angling method, most renowned as a method for catching trout and salmon, but employed today for a wide variety of species including pike, bass, panfish, and carp, as well as marine species, such as redfish, snook, tarpon, bonefish and striped bass. There is a growing population of anglers whose aim is to catch as many different species as possible with the fly. * Tenkara fishing - Tenkara is a form of fly fishing that originated in Japan over 200 years ago. It was originally done with a bamboo pole between 12' and 20' with the line tied directly on the tip of the rod requiring no reel. Modern tenkara rods are usually made of graphite and are telescopic. Unlike western style fly fishing tenkara uses either a tapered line or a level line and forgoes the PVC coated fly fishing line. Typical target species include trout and char but most smaller freshwater species can be caught by this method. * Rock fishing - fishing from rocky outcrops into the sea. It is a popular pastime in Australia and New Zealand. It can be a dangerous pastime and claims many lives each year. *Pitch Fishing - also known as “pitching” or “pitch fishing,” is a technique designed to deliver the lure quietly and at a distance over the water. The lure will fly high and far out over the water, landing in a loud splash. Pitch fishing involves sending the lure out a lower angle, and thus making a smaller splash but still loud as noted in the previous sentence, which will hopefully not scare the fish. * Surfcasting - fishing from a shoreline using a rod to cast into the surf. With few exceptions, surf fishing is done in saltwater, often from a beach. The basic idea of most surfcasting is to cast a bait or lure as far out into the water as is necessary to reach the target fish from the shore. This may or may not require long casting distances and muscular techniques. Basic surf fishing can be done with a surfcasting rod between seven and twelve feet long, with an extended butt section, equipped with an appropriate spinning or conventional casting reel. Dedicated surfcasters usually possess an array of terminal and other tackle, with rods and reels of different lengths and actions, and lures and baits of different weights and capabilities. Depending on fishing conditions and the fish they are targeting, such surfcasters tailor bait and terminal tackle to rod and reel and the size and species of the fish. Reels and other equipment need to be constructed so they resist the corrosive and abrasive effects of salt and sand. Other angling * Bottom fishing - is fishing the bottom of a body of water. In the United Kingdom it is called \\"ledgering\\". A common rig for fishing on the bottom is a weight tied to the end of the line, with a hook about an inch up line from the weight. The method can be used both with hand lines and rods. There are fishing rods specialized for bottom fishing, called \\"donkas\\". The weight is used to cast or throw the line an appropriate distance. Bottom fishing can be done both from boats and from the land. It targets groundfish such as sucker fish, bream, catfish, and crappie. * Ice fishing - is the practice of catching fish with lines and hooks through an opening in the ice on a frozen body of water. It is practised by hunter-gatherers such as the Inuit and by anglers in other cold or continental climates. * Kayak fishing - has a long history, and has gained popularity in recent times. Many of the techniques used are the same as those used on other fishing boats, apart from difference is in the set-up, how each piece of equipment is fitted to the kayak, and how each activity is carried out on such a small craft. * Kite fishing has long been used in China and by the people of New Guinea and other Pacific Islands. Kites can provide the fishermen access to waters that would otherwise be available only with boats. Similarly, for boat owners, kites provide a way to fish in areas where it is not safe to navigate such as shallows or coral reefs where fish may be plentiful. Kites can also be used for trolling a lure through the water. Suitable kites may be of very simple construction. Those of Tobi Island are a large leaf stiffened by the ribs of the fronds of the coconut palm. The fishing line may be made from coconut fibre and the lure made from spiders webs.KiteLines Fall 1977 (Vol. 1 No. 3) Articles on Kite Fishing . Modern kitefishing is popular in New Zealand, where large delta kites of synthetic materials are used to fish from beaches,Big Dropper Rigs taking a line and hooks far out past the breakers. Kite fishing is also emerging in Melbourne where sled kites are becoming popular, both off beaches and off boats and in freshwater areas. The disabled community are increasingly using the kites for fishing as they allow mobility impaired people to cast the bait further out than they would otherwise be able to. * Kontiki Fishing - is the practice of using either a Kontiki sailing raft, or a modern motorised torpedo device to pull a longline (up to 25 hooks) from the beach up to two thousand metres offshore. This method of fishing is very popular on the surf beaches of New Zealand. The electric kontikis can also be used to pull surfcasting lines and baits offshore, before releasing them to fish. Modern electric kontikis use electric trolling motors, lithium batteries and GPS controlled autopilots, and electric winches are used to retrieve the line, hooks and kontiki back to shore. * Boat anglers - Fishing is usually done either from a boat or from a shoreline or river bank. When fishing from a boat, pretty much any fishing technique can be used, from nets to fish traps, but some form of angling is by far the most common. Compared to fishing from the land, fishing from a boat allows more access to different fishing grounds and different species of fish. Some tackle is specialised for boat anglers, such as sea rods. * Remote control fishing - Fishing can also be done using a remote controlled boat. This type of fishing is commonly referred to as RC fishing. The boat is usually one to three feet long and runs on a small DC battery. A radio transmitter controls the boat. The fisherman connects the fishing line/bait to the boat; drives it; navigating the water by manipulating the remote controller. The technique is growing in popularity. Trapping Fishermen with traditional fish traps, Hà Tây, Vietnam A typical wooden fish wheel Lobster pots on the beach at Beer, Devon Traps are culturally almost universal and seem to have been independently invented many times. There are essentially two types of trap, a permanent or semi-permanent structure placed in a river or tidal area and pot-traps that are baited to attract prey and periodically lifted. * Artisanal techniques ** Dam fishing - An artisanal technique called dam fishing is used by the Baka pygmies. This involves the construction of a temporary dam resulting in a drop in the water levels downstream—allowing fish to be easily collected.Dam Fishing Fishing techniques of the Baka. * Basket weir fish traps - were widely used in ancient times. They are shown in medieval illustrations and surviving examples have been found. Basket weirs are about 2 m long and comprise two wicker cones, one inside the other—easy to get into and hard to get out.Shooting and Fishing the Trent , ancient fish traps. * Fishing weir - In medieval Europe, large fishing weir structures were constructed from wood posts and wattle fences. 'V' shaped structures in rivers could be as long as 60 metres and worked by directing fish towards fish traps or nets. Such fish traps were evidently controversial in medieval England. The Magna Carta includes a clause requiring that they be removed: \\"All fish-weirs shall be removed from the Thames, the Medway, and throughout the whole of England, except on the sea coast\\".The Text of Magna Carta, see paragraph 33. * Fish wheels - operate alongside streams, much as a water-powered mill wheel. A wheel complete with baskets and paddles is attached to a floating dock. The wheel rotates due to the current of the stream. The baskets on the wheel capture fish travelling upstream and transfer them into a holding tank. When the holding tank is full, the fish are removed. * Lobster traps - also called lobster pots, are traps used to catch lobsters. They resemble fish traps, yet are usually smaller and consist of several sections. Lobster traps are also used to catch other crustaceans, such as crabs and crayfish. They can be constructed in various shapes, but the design strategy is to make the entry into the trap much easier than exit. The pots are baited and lowered into the water and checked frequently. Historically lobster pots were constructed with wood or metal. Today most traps are made from checkered wire and mesh. It is common for the trap to be weighted down with bricks. A bait bag is hung in the middle of the trap. In theory the lobster walks up the mesh and then falls into the wire trap. Bait varies from captain to captain but it is common to use herring. In commercial lobstering five to ten of these traps will be connected with line. A buoy marks each end of the string of pots. Two buoys are important to make retrieval easier and so captains don't set their traps over each other. Each buoy is painted differently so the various captains can identify their traps. Animals Chinese man with fishing cormorant. * Cooperative human-dolphin fisheries date back to the ancient Roman author and natural philosopher Pliny the Elder.M.B. Santos, R. Fernández, A. López, J.A. Martínez and G.J. Pierce (2007), Variability in the diet of bottlenose dolphin, Tursiops truncatus, in Galician waters, north-western Spain, 1990 – 2005 (.pdf), article retrieved April 3, 2007. A modern human-dolphin fishery still takes place in Laguna, Santa Catarina, Brazil and a few other places in the world. In Laguna, men stand in shallow waters of the lagoon, or sit in canoes, forming a line, and waiting for the dolphins to appear. One or more resident dolphins drives fish towards the waiting fishermen. Then at a critical moment when the dolphins are close enough to the fishermen, one dolphin emerges from the water for an average duration of 1.4 seconds, performing a unique sequence of movements not otherwise seen in the wild. This sequence serves as a signal to the fishermen to cast their throw nets. The dolphins then feed off the fish that manage to escape the nets.The Telegraph (2006), Brazil's sexiest secret, article retrieved March 11, 2007.Dr. Moti Nissani (2007) Bottlenose Dolphins in Laguna Requesting a Throw Net (video). Supporting material for Dr. Nissani's presentation at the 2007 International Ethological Conference. Video retrieved February 13, 2008. In this unique form of fishing, the dolphins gain because the fish are disoriented and because the fish cannot escape to shallow waters where the larger dolphins cannot reach them. Likewise, studies show that fishermen casting their nets following the unique signal catch more fish than when fishing alone, without the involvement of the dolphins. * Cormorant fishing - In China and Japan, the practice of cormorant fishing is thought to date back some 1300 years. Fishermen use the natural fish-hunting instincts of the cormorants to catch fish, but a metal ring placed round the bird's neck prevents large, valuable fish from being swallowed. The fish are instead collected by the fisherman.Cormorant fishing: history and technique . * Frigatebirds fishing - The people of Nauru used trained frigatebirds to fish on reefs. * Portuguese Water Dogs - Dating from the 16th century in Portugal, Portuguese Water Dogs were used by fishermen to send messages between boats, to retrieve fish and articles from the water, and to guard the fishing boats. Labrador Retrievers have been used by fishermen to assist in bringing nets to shore; the dog would grab the floating corks on the ends of the nets and pull them to shore. * Remora fishing - The practice of tethering a remora, a sucking fish, to a fishing line and using the remora to capture sea turtles probably originated in the Indian Ocean. The earliest surviving records of the practice are Peter Martyr d'Anghera's 1511 accounts of the second voyage of Columbus to the New World (1494).De Orbe Novo, Volume 1, The Eight Decades of Peter Martyr D'Anghera, Project Gutenberg. However, these accounts are probably apocryphal, and based on earlier, no longer extant accounts from the Indian Ocean region. Other techniques Scientists carrying out a population and species survey using electrofishing equipment miracle technique A laksegiljer in Osterfjord, Norway * Basnig - a traditional method of fishing in the Philippines that combines the use of bag nets and attracting fish with high-powered lamps. Specialized outrigger boats known as basnigan are used. * Electrofishing - is another recently developed technique, primarily used in freshwater by fisheries scientists. Electrofishing uses electricity to stun fish so they can be caught. It is commonly used in scientific surveys, sampling fish populations for abundance, density, and species composition. When performed correctly, electrofishing results in no permanent harm to fish, which return to their natural state a few minutes after being stunned. * Fish aggregating devices - are man-made objects used to attract pelagic fish such as marlin, tuna and mahi-mahi (dolphin fish). They usually consist of buoys or floats tethered to the ocean floor with concrete blocks. ** Lampuki nets - are an example of a traditional artisanal use of nets. Since Roman times, Maltese fishers have cut the larger, lower fronds from palm trees which they then weave into large flat rafts. The rafts are pulled out to sea by a luzzu, a small traditional fishing boat. In the middle of the day, lampuki fish (the Maltese name for mahi-mahi) school underneath the rafts, seeking the shade, and are caught by the fishers using large mesh nets. * Dredging - There are types of dredges used for collecting scallops, oysters or sea cucumbers from the seabed. They have the form of a scoop made of chain mesh and they are towed by a fishing boat. Dredging can be destructive to the seabed, because the marine life is unable to survive the weight of the dredge. It is extremely detrimental to coral beds since they take centuries to rebuild themselves. Unmonitored dredging can be compared to unmonitored forest clearing, where it can wipe out ecosystems. Nowadays, this method of fishing is often replaced by mariculture or by scuba diving. * Fish finders - are electronic sonar devices which indicate the presence of fish and fish schools. They are widely used by recreational fishermen. Commercially, they are used with other electronic locating and positioning devices. * Fishing light attractors - use lights attached (above or underwater) to some structure to attract fish and bait fish. Fishing light attractor are operated every night. After a while, fish discover the increased concentration of bait surrounding the light. Once located, the fish return regularly, and can be harvested. * Flossing - also called bottom bouncing. A method of angling usually used for salmon. It uses a hook and bait attached to a weighted bouncer dragged along the bottom of a stream or river. * Harvesting machines - have recently been developed for commercial fishing. Harvesting machines use pumps to pump fish out of the sea. Dredges have also been mechanized so that they directly transfer mollusks to the surface as are dredged. * Payaos - a type of fish aggregating device used in Southeast Asia, particularly in the Philippines. Payaos were traditionally bamboo rafts for handline fishing before World War II, but modern steel payaos use fish lights and fish location sonar to increase yields. While payaos fishing is sustainable on a small scale, the large scale, modern applications have been linked to adverse impacts on fish stocks. * Shrimp baiting - is a method used by recreational fisherman for of catching shrimp. It uses a cast net, bait and long poles. The poles are used to mark a specific location and then bait is thrown in the water near the pole. After several minutes the cast net is thrown as close to the bait as possible and shrimp are caught in the net. In the 1980s the sport became popular in the south eastern coastal states of the USA. * Laksegiljer - small cabins standing on stilts where a fisherman sits. This method of fishing entails a net where the opening is controlled by a line tied to a rock. Under the cabin on the seabed is a white plank. When a salmon swim across the plank, the fisherman sees it and throws the rock into the water so the line closes the opening of the net, trapping the salmon. In Norway this method of fishing is banned, but in Osterfjord locals can obtain a special permit to use this method in order to maintain the old traditions. Destructive techniques Destructive fishing practices are practices that easily result in irreversible damage to aquatic habitats and ecosystems. Many fishing techniques can be destructive if used inappropriately, but some practices are particularly likely to result in irreversible damage. These practices are mostly, though not always, illegal. Where they are illegal, they are often inadequately enforced. Some examples are:  Blast fishing  Dynamite or blast fishing is done easily and cheaply with dynamite or homemade bombs made from locally available materials. Fish are killed by the shock from the blast and are then skimmed from the surface or collected from the bottom. The explosions indiscriminately kill large numbers of fish and other marine organisms in the vicinity and can damage or destroy the physical environment. Explosions are particularly harmful to coral reefs.Explosions In The Cretan Sea: The scourge of illegal fishing -- fishing with explosives. Blast fishing is also illegal in many waterways around the world.  Bottom trawling  Bottom trawling is trawling (towing a trawl, which is a fishing net) along the sea floor. It is also referred to as \\"dragging\\". The scientific community divides bottom trawling into benthic trawling and demersal trawling. Benthic trawling is towing a net at the very bottom of the ocean and demersal trawling is towing a net just above the benthic zone. Bottom trawling targets both bottom-living fish (groundfish) and semi-pelagic species such as cod, squid, shrimp, and rockfish. Bottom fishing has operated for over a century on heavily fished grounds such as the North Sea and Grand Banks. While overfishing has long been recognised as causing major ecological changes to the fish community on the Grand Banks, concern has been raised more recently about the damage which benthic trawling inflicts upon seabed communities. A species of particular concern is the slow growing, deep water coral Lophelia pertusa. This species is home to a diverse community of deep sea organisms, but is easily damaged by fishing gear. On 17 November 2004, the United Nations General Assembly urged nations to consider temporary bans on high seas bottom trawling.  Cyanide fishing  Cyanide fishing is a method of collecting live fish mainly for use in aquariums, which involves spraying a sodium cyanide mixture into the desired fish's habitat in order to stun the fish. The practice hurts not only the target population, but also many other marine organisms, including coral and thus coral reefs. Recent studies have shown that the combination of cyanide use and stress of post capture handling results in mortality of up to 75% of the organisms within less than 48 hours of capture. With such high mortality numbers, a greater number of fish must be caught in order to offset post catch death.  Muro-ami  Muro-ami is a destructive artisan fishing method employed on coral reefs in Southeast Asia. An encircling net is used with pounding devices, such as large stones fitted on ropes that are pounded onto the coral reefs. They can also consist of large heavy blocks of cement suspended above the sea by a crane fitted to the vessel. The pounding devices are repeatedly lowered into the area encircled by the net, smashing the coral into small fragments in order to scare the fish out of their coral refuges. The \\"crushing\\" effect on the coral heads has been described as having long-lasting and practically totally destructive effects.FAO: Destructive fishing practices History Ancient remains of spears, hooks and fish net have been found in ruins of the Stone Age. The people of the early civilization drew pictures of nets and fishing lines in their arts (Parker 2002). Early hooks were made from the upper bills of eagles and from bones, shells, horns and plant thorns. Spears were tipped with the same materials, or sometimes with flints. Lines and nets were made from leaves, plant stalk and cocoon silk. Literature on the indigenous fishing practices is very scanty. Baines (1992) documented traditional fisheries in the Solomon Islands. Use of the herbal fish poisons in catching fishes from fresh water and sea documented from New Caledonia (Dahl 1985). John (1998) documented fishing techniques and overall life style of the Mukkuvar fishing Community of Kanyakumari district of Tamil Nadu, India. Tribal people using various plants for medicinal and various purposes (Rai et al. 2000; Singh et al. 1997; Lin 2005) extends the use notion for herbal fish stupefying plants. Use of the fish poisons is very old practice in the history of human kind. In 1212, King Frederick II prohibited the use of certain plant piscicides, and by the 15th century similar laws had been decreed in other European countries as well (Wilhelm 1974). All over the globe, indigenous people use various fish poisons to kill the fishes, documented in America (Jeremy 2002) and among Tarahumara Indian (Gajdusek 1954).

M&T; Bank agreed to acquire Hudson City on August 27, 2012. The company was located at West 80 Century Road, in Paramus, New Jersey.Institution History for HUDSON CITY BANCORP, INC. (2367556), National Information Center Hudson City Savings Bank On March 27, 1868, the Hudson City Savings Bank received a charter from the New Jersey Legislature to open in what was then the small Hudson City, New Jersey. Garrett D. Van Reipen, the city's first mayor, became the first president of the small bank. By the early 1870s, the city of Hudson was annexed by Jersey City, New Jersey, the second-largest city in the state. By the end of the 19th century, the bank had accumulated assets and deposits of over $1 million. In January 1918, Robert J. Rendall became the savings bank's president, and by his death in 1950 he had become one of the longest serving presidents in the company's history. In the 1920s, Hudson City Savings Bank opened its second branch office, and moved from the old headquarters on Newark Avenue, to 587 Summit Avenue in Jersey City. The company survived the aftermath of the stock market crash of 1929 when many other banks closed. By the end of the Great Depression of the 1930s, it had accumulated US$11 million in assets and held US$800,000 in reserves. By the end of the 1940s, the savings bank had opened at least three Jersey City branches, with over US$26 million in assets. In August 1950, President Robert J. Rendall died. During the 1950s, New Jersey's growth rate was double the national average, boosting the savings bank's growth as well: by 1959, Hudson City Savings Bank had accumulated over US$50 million in assets. In 1968, Kenneth L. Birchby became president and CEO of the bank. By the late 1960s, New Jersey's banking laws made it legal for banks to operate across county lines. In 1969, the bank opened its fifth branch, and its first branch across the county line at Waldwick, in Bergen County, New Jersey. The bank's total assets by then had reached US$175 million. During the long secular bear market and economic malaise of the 1970s the bank grew to 37 branches in 12 New Jersey counties. In 1978, the headquarters moved to neighboring Bergen County, New Jersey. By that time, the bank had accumulated total assets and deposits of over US$1.1 billion each. In 1981, Leonard S. Gudelski became president. The bank survived the troubles surrounding double-digit inflation and interest rates, and also survived the following early 1980s recession and the later 1980s Savings and Loan crisis when many other banks and savings and loans failed. In 1988, Ronald E. Hermance, Jr. was hired at Hudson City Savings as Senior Executive Vice President and Chief Operating Officer. He had previously been Chief Financial Officer of Southold Savings Bank on Long Island, New York.Officers & Directors Detail Hudson City Bancorp Inc HCBK.O (NASDAQ), Hermance, Ronald E., Brief Biography , Reuters.com By the end of 1989, Hudson City Savings Bank had 69 branches and total assets of US$3.2 billion. In 1992, following the 1990-1991 recession, the bank became the largest savings bank in New Jersey. In 1996, Leonard S. Gudelski was elected chairman, and also retained his position as president through that year. In January 1997, Ronald E. Hermance, Jr. was promoted to replace Gudelski as the 11th president of the bank. Gudelski remained as chairman. As of January 1, 2011, there were 136 branch offices, nine in Fairfield County, Connecticut, 29 in New York State, and 98 in New Jersey spanning Bergen, Passaic, Morris, Warren, Essex, Hudson, Union, Somerset, Middlesex, Mercer, Monmouth, Ocean, Burlington, Camden, Atlantic, and Gloucester counties. Hudson City Bancorp In February 1999, the bank initiated a plan of reorganization as a wholly owned subsidiary of Hudson City Bancorp, Inc. The company issued stock for the first time, raising over US$500 million of new capital. Assets exceeded $8 billion by then. On July 13, 1999, Hudson City Bancorp, Inc., was formally recognized by the United States Federal Reserve as the bank holding company for the savings bank. Ronald E. Hermance, Jr., retained his position as president and also was promoted from COO to CEO of the new holding company. On January 1, 2004, the company was changed from a bank holding company to a Domestic Entity Other as categorized by the Federal Reserve System, defined generically as a domestic institution that engages in the business of banking in the United States. The move was in preparation for its huge stock offering, the company's second-step mutual-to- stock conversion. On January 1, 2005, Ronald Hermance, Jr., replaced Gudelski as chairman, as well as retaining his existing positions as president and CEO.August 2, 2008. \\"America's Smartest Banker: The nation's financial industry is cratering, so how come Hudson City Bank is thriving?\\" by Daniel Gross In 2004, he had also begun serving on the board of directors of the Federal Home Loan Bank of New York. On June 8, 2005, the company made the largest public stock offering in the history of the United States banking industry, represented by Thacher Proffitt. The conversion from the mutual holding company structure made Hudson City Bancorp a fully publicly held entity. In the public offering, 393 million shares were sold at $10.00 per share. The company also split its existing stock 3.206-for-one. The new Hudson City Bancorp shares traded on the NASDAQ under the ticker symbol HCBK. By 2007, Hudson City Savings Bank had become the largest New Jersey based savings bank, and the third largest savings and loan association in the United States, with over US$35 billion in assets, over 100 branches in New Jersey, New York and Connecticut, and with over 1,300 employees. On February 14, 2007, the company was added to the S&P; 500 Index by Standard & Poor's, where it replaced American Power Conversion Corporation Financial and legal problems During the subprime mortgage crisis, Hudson City was cited as an example of good management. They continued to require a good credit score and down payments of 10 to 20 percent, and avoided \\"exotic mortgages\\" allowing no income verification and/or no down-payment. Forbes called the bank the \\"best managed bank of 2007.\\" Hudson City was the largest American bank to refuse federal bailout money, which unfortunately led to its downfall. While initially better off, the other large banks offloaded their bad loans to the government, leaving Hudson City with more debt than their competitors. While not plagued by the credit quality of its loans, by 2012 the bank was weakened as the continued lower mortgage rates encouraged a wave of refinancing to the lower rates. Hudson City was successful in avoiding the mortgage and banking meltdown made by prudent lending. However, \\"actions taken by the government to rescue the banking system proved to be Hudson City's undoing.\\" It borrowed at 4% in 2005 and successfully avoided the rise in interest rates in 2006 but suffered from an unprecedented reduction in interest rates implemented by the Fed to bail out the banking system. Its portfolio of jumbo loans was previously ineligible to refinance into a conforming loan, giving the bank a stable long-term asset base. After the housing crisis, the rules changed raising the conforming limit, which enabled the high credit quality jumbo loans to refinance to the lower rate available to GSE-purchased mortgages. The lengthy foreclosure process left Hudson City with a large number of non- performing loans. A loss of high-quality borrowers, an inability to issue new mortgages at reasonable rates, and a portfolio of non-performing loans encouraged the bank to accept a buy-out. On September 12, 2014, after the death of Ronald Hermance, Hudson City Bancorp appointed Denis J. Salamone as chief executive officer in accordance with the company's succession plan.Denis J. Salamone Appointed as new CEO In September 2015 the corporation agreed to a settlement for mortgage lending practices which discriminated against largely Black and Latin-American neighborhoods. M&T; acquisition On August 27, 2012, Hudson City Bancorp agreed to a buy-out by Buffalo, New York-based M&T; Bank for $3.7 billion. M&T; was to gain $25 billion in deposits and $28 billion in loans, along with 135 branch locations, 97 of which are located in New Jersey. Thereafter, Hudson City Bancorp became a better buyer of all specified pools. The buy-out was delayed for more than three years due to concerns by the Federal Reserve Board about M&T;'s anti-money laundering compliance. The Federal Reserve finally approved the acquisition in September 2015, and on November 1, 2015, Hudson City Bancorp became an M&T; subsidiary. At 1,129 days, it is by far the longest delayed bank merger in history. Since November 1, Hudson City has operated as a subsidiary of M&T.; M&T; plans to completely integrate and rebrand branch locations by February 16.

But deep inside Yumi, she feels terribly hurt by how nonchalantly Sachiko chose her randomly as her petite sœur; but despite of this, in a monologue (page 129 of the first novel), feels that precisely because she still likes Sachiko very much, she has \\"summoned the last vestiges of her pride to refuse Sachiko's rosary, and wishes Sachiko to at least understand how hurt she feels to be 'just a random pick'\\". :At a dress rehearsal for the play, it is revealed that the male who plays the prince, Suguru, is Sachiko's cousin and fiancé. Sachiko accuses him of going too far and runs away; Yumi follows her to the greenhouse. Yumi at first thinks that she cannot do anything for Sachiko, but Sachiko cries on her shoulder. Yumi offers to take the rosary, but Sachiko refuses. Sachiko tells Yumi about the arranged marriage, and that Suguru does not love her, but she loves him. After the play, there is a bonfire. Yumi thinks sadly that she would not have an excuse to have anything more to do with Sachiko, but suddenly Sachiko appears and offers Yumi her rosary; this time, Yumi accepts. :When the third years are about to graduate, Yumi asks Sei if she had anything to ask her, like taking care of the stray cat Goronta, or looking after Shimako. Sei says Yumi is the type of girl who will help even if not asked, so she is not worried about Shimako. Sei instead asked for a kiss on the mouth as a parting gift; Yumi tried to run away, but Sei hugged her. Sei thanked Yumi for helping her pass her examinations, since Yumi gave Sei a reason to live again. She also said that Yumi tried to run away so that it would not be Sei who was leaving her, but the other way around. Yumi realized that this is true. Yumi often gets hugged by Sei throughout the series, who thinks her to be very cute, which sometimes makes Sachiko angry due to jealousy. Yumi finds out from Shimako, however, that Sei would actually be going to the Lillian's Girls' University, which is in the same area as Yumi's school. She gets angry at Sei for not telling her, but is happy because Sei will not be leaving her after all. :After the third years graduate, spring comes, along with the arrival of Tōko, Sachiko's cousin. Yumi feels jealous of Tōko's closeness with Sachiko, but does not say anything about it. Yumi later finds out the truth about Sachiko's grandmother dying. At the day of the funeral, Sachiko apologizes and Yumi says that she loved her onee-sama very much. :At the beginning of the OVAs, Sachiko invited Yumi to her summer home for a vacation. Sachiko's acquaintances make trouble for them. They then invite Yumi and Sachiko to a party which later turns out to be the eightieth birthday party of one of the acquaintances great grandmother. The acquaintances ask Yumi to play a musical instrument. Yumi says that she is no good at playing anything, but sings the song \\"Maria-sama no Kokoro\\". Sachiko accompanies her with a piano performance. After that, the great grandmother congratulates Yumi, because the song brings back memories. She calls Yumi a cute angel, and asks her to visit next year. :In the second OVA, Yumi sets up a casual meeting with the Yamayuri Council and the Hanadera Council to discuss the upcoming festivities for both schools. Yumi did not inform Sachiko of the meeting, because of her hatred for men, and planned to trick her into attending. However, Yumi felt she was betraying Sachiko and confessed her intentions. Yumi felt that Sachiko should attend on her own free will, because she will find herself in similar situations in the future. Sachiko noted that Yumi has learned to handle her well and that she happily complies with her wishes. We also learn about Yumi's \\"type\\" through a conversation with her brother. She describes ones who are pretty, smart, who at first seem like they have warped personalities but on the inside are warm-hearted. Yūki remarks that she's describing Sachiko, much to her surprise. :Yumi is tasked by Sachiko in the fourth season to look for a petite sœur. By then, she has already an increasing involvement in the Yamayuri Council. Also, a slow but steady change can be seen in her (especially after Tōko comes into her life) - Yumi begins to try to mature out of her own shell and to become more independent, calm and collected. ; : :Played by: Haru :When Yumi first runs into her in the student council room, Sachiko is portrayed as someone who is a far cry from the perfect lady that Yumi pictures her to be (this might not be apparent in the anime and manga, as the novel has a more detailed account of the incident). In the novel, Sachiko somewhat knew Yumi is her fan and was overconfident that Yumi would never refuse her. :Though prim, elegant, and somewhat aloof, Sachiko has both a rough (the novel and manga affectionately terms this as her \\"hysterical side\\") and a very sweet side. She is also afraid of heights and dislikes men, to the point where she will do anything she can to avoid interacting or being near one. She is very protective of Yumi and cares deeply about her. This is proven during Hanadera's school festival. After agonizing over Yumi's disappearance during an event, when Yumi appeared in a panda costume, Sachiko climbed down a tall ladder and ran through the crowd of men to reach her. This also proved a statement that Sachiko had made earlier; that even if Yumi and a thousand other people were wrapped up like mummies she could still find Yumi on her first try. However, Sachiko often has the same problem that Yumi does—she does not share most of her problems with her sœur, causing many misunderstandings. Sachiko is slated to marry her cousin and fiancé Suguru after she graduates. This has caused her some distress since, because although she initially cared deeply for him, he did not reciprocate. They now have a complicated relationship. :Sachiko also cares a lot for her peer, Rei, especially with regards to the latter's conflicts with Yoshino - she once went all the way to beg with Rosa Chinensis and Gigantea (even going into her hysterical mode) to help out; she gives Rei a hug when the latter is unsure of how she could balance between her \\"own future and own life\\" and \\"life with/without Yoshino\\" during the latter parts of the series. :Sometimes, Yumi must teach Sachiko how to live informally, for example, helping her select her first pair of jeans and eating in a fastfood restaurant. Despite her sometimes stern appearance, Sachiko has her own share of insecurities regarding her relationship with Yumi, not to mention emotional insecurities rising from her home life; both her father and grandfather openly have mistresses, unabashedly dividing their time between home and the mistresses, which apparently led to her general disdain for men, as illustrated in the OVA series during a meeting with the student council members of Hanadera, an all-boys' high school. :After Sachiko enters her third year, she is now the new Rosa Chinensis. After the arrival of Tōko, Sachiko spends more time with her than with Yumi, which makes Yumi jealous. Sachiko goes absent from school which makes Yumi worried. Later, Yōko is sent to \\"bring\\" Yumi to Sachiko's grandmother house. Yumi finds out that Sachiko's grandmother recently died, which causes Sachiko to go into depression. Sachiko says that she apologizes for the past few weeks, and asks for Yumi's forgiveness; Yumi says that she loves her very much. :At the beginning of the summer holidays, Sachiko takes Yumi to her summer home. Whilst there, Sachiko's acquaintances make trouble for them due to their jealousy regarding the closeness of Sachiko and Yumi's relationship. Sachiko wants to leave to protect Yumi, but Yumi refuses. The acquaintances have a party, and invite them but make plans to embarrass Yumi instead. At the party, they ask Yumi to play a musical instrument for one of the acquaintances great grandmother. Yumi says that she cannot play anything and prefers to sing the song \\"Maria-sama no Kokoro\\", and Sachiko accompanies her with a piano performance. The great grandmother is happy because the song brings back fond memories, and she asks Yumi to visit next year, foiling the acquaintances' plans for her humiliation in the process. :In the fourth season, Sachiko is already asking Yumi to look for a petite sœur, although she is still deeply concerned about Yumi, especially when one potential candidate for the future Rosa Chinensis en bouton rejected Yumi, at first. Later on, she makes plans to attend a nearby college after graduation so she can be near Yumi. ; : :A distant relative and fan of Sachiko. She arrives at Lillian during Yumi's second year. Tōko is a member of the Drama club, and nicknamed Mechanical Drill by Sei Satō for her corkscrew pigtails. In the beginning of her first year, Tōko causes some strain in the relationship between Yumi and Sachiko. However, later on in the year that she becomes Yumi's petite sœur. :Tōko is also an accomplished actress. She was able to use this talent during several occasions (when the Yamayuri Council decides to expose Shimako's family background) and when Tōko becomes one of the cast in the Yamayuri Council stage play. In the eighteenth novel, the narration also remarks how Tōko was able to bring her natural acting skills to bear when she tries to hide her complicated relationships with her seniors in the drama club - she does this so well that even Sachiko did not notice anything wrong. :Though Tōko might seem to always act rude towards Yumi (she often scolds Yumi for being air-headed, for being too lenient and soft towards Kanako, for being too naive) but upon the nineteenth novel, a short excerpt of her thoughts during her fallout with her drama club members show that she has also felt touched by Yumi's caring personality (though she does not show it on her face). :By the fourth season, Tōko's personality starts to unravel--she may be proud and headstrong, but she is still a fickle, fragile girl with a mysterious secret. This leads to events in volume twenty-one of the novels, and in the fourth season of the anime, where Tōko initially rejects Yumi's rosary when the latter requests Tōko to become her petite sœur. The thirteenth and final episode of the fourth season reveals Tōko's secret, as she told Yumi on their date. As an infant, Tōko was orphaned when she and her parents were involved in a vehicular accident, and she was the only survivor. No one in her family could feasibly take her in, so she was sent to an orphanage, and was eventually adopted by the Matsudairas. She found out the truth later after listening in to some of her relatives' conversations, and confirming it in a registry. The picture Tōko showed to Yumi showed Tōko's natural mother and foster mother, who, by coincidence, were classmates in Lilian High School (and it was Tōko's foster mother who, as seen in the picture, happened to bear the corkscrew pigtails Tōko herself sports). By yet another coincidence, Tōko's natural mother was a member of the school's drama club, which led to Tōko's own problems with her membership in the drama club. Tōko is very grateful towards her foster parents, but cannot break out of the lingering guilt that there is nothing that she can do to repay all the kindness that she feels she doesn't deserve (she once mentions to her father that a life should be one of \\"give and take\\"). On top of that, she was very mistaken that Yumi offered her rosario out of sympathy (and Tōko hated pity for herself out of everything else), so Tōko cannot help but distance herself from everything and everyone that will give her happiness (from her favorite drama club to her beloved Yumi-sama). But after a series of events leading to a date with Yumi and revealing all this to her, Tōko is eventually at peace with herself, and receives Yumi's rosary and becomes the future Rosa Chinensis en bouton, in front of the incumbent but soon to step down Rosa Chinensis, Sachiko. ; : :Played by: Kaoru Hirata : Calm and reserved, but usually with a smirk on her face, Yōko is Sachiko's grande sœur. As the nearly indisputable leader of the Yamayurikai during her time as Rosa Chinensis, she played a major role in maintaining stability in its sometimes unstable environment. Though usually cool and refined, she was also known to have a fun side. Additionally, it has been implied that she has an unrequited love for Sei Satō. She made Sachiko her petite sœur in a situation happened like Sachiko did to Yumi. In Sachiko's second year, Yōko argues with Sachiko about the Cinderella play since she does not want to play with a male. Yumi suddenly comes in, and Yōko and the other two Roses offer them a bet. This eventually leads Yumi to become Sachiko's petite sœur. She does not appear much in the first season because of her exams. Before Valentine's Day, Minako Tsukiyama comes and asks the Yamayurikai if they can host the Card Hunting Game. Yōko says she wants the Roses Mansion to be one of the hunting locations so she can see the Roses Mansion filled with ordinary students before her graduation. :At the beginning of the second season, Yōko comes to Sachiko's house on New Year's Day with the other Yamayurikai members, to join in a party there. Two days before her graduation ceremony, she comes up to Yumi from behind, giving her a surprise hug. Yumi asks if she is trying to make fun of her, but Yōko says that she wanted to hug her once before she leaves. She takes Yumi for a drink, telling the younger girl to take care of Sachiko. :After the third year Roses graduate, only Sei ends up going to Lilian university; this makes Sachiko cry when she was chosen to give her onee-sama a goodbye speech at the ceremony. Yōko, at first, does not want to help her because that would imply that Sachiko is weak if she keeps relying on her onee-sama. When she cannot take anymore, she tries to help her, but Rei goes to help Sachiko to say farewell to the third years. Seeing that her sœur has changed, Yōko is happy, saying that she can leave Lilian without any worries now. A few months later, when Sachiko's grandmother dies, Yōko is requested by her mother to meet Yumi. On their way to Sachiko's great grandmother's house, she explains everything to Yumi. Gigantea family ; : :Played by: Karen Takizawa :The exact opposite of most of the characters in the series: loud, rough-around-the- edges, she loves doing what she can to push other peoples' buttons. She especially finds joy in teasing Yumi (and also enjoys irritating Sachiko in the process) as she likes to see their reactions; Yumi affectionately calls that her \\"old man\\" behavior. However, Sei is one of the wisest and most caring characters in the series. Though seeming to have a playful and laid-back attitude, Sei has experienced many tragedies in her life, especially in her second year. Sei's personality was very different in her first two years. She was uninterested in everything, and never joked around like she did in her third year. Sei believes that Shimako should learn to solve her problems on her own, then only will she become strong. After leaving Lilian high school, Sei still appears as a secondary character. :While the relationship between Sei and Shimako seems cold, the truth is Shimako is extremely devoted to Sei. Their relationship, as Yumi noted, is something that cannot be easily understood. After graduating from the high school division of Lillian, Sei studies English and American Literature at Lillian University. Sei shortens her hair when she goes to study at the university, as indicated in her appearances in the fourth season. She is initially the only one among the Yamayurikai who can drive. She once took Yumi for a ride in her car. ; : :Played by: Riho Takada :Prim, proper and very beautiful (there were a few instances in the novel where the narration describes her skin as very fair, or even pale, and her complexion \\"like an antique western doll\\"), Shimako is the most admired of the first-years. She is the petite sœur of Sei at the beginning of the story and later is her successor. Underneath Shimako's quiet, mannerly exterior lies a surprisingly strong resolve, calm personality and thoughtfulness. During Sachiko's initial attempt to perform the sœur ritual on Yumi in front of the entire student council body, Shimako was the only one who considered Yumi's feelings of being forced to be one, and Shimako was brave enough to voice it out. Despite this, she has her uncertainties about herself. She is even unable to decide whether she should run for the next Rosa Gigantea at first, since she is not the type to lead people, and also because she just wants to work, not so much for the council, but for Sei herself. During the Valentine's Day arc (with reference from the novel), we see that though Shimako is outwardly strong, she realises that she is actually very afraid of losing the relationships she has gained so far, hence explaining how she divulged to Yumi that she feels relationships and sense of belonging are only \\"shackles\\". Reminiscent of Sei in her third year, Shimako is unsure of how to find a petite sœur in her second year after Sei leaves. She meets Noriko under the cherry blossoms, like how she first met Sei and later asks her to become her petite sœur. :Shimako was somber in the first two seasons. But she realises, after a phone conversation with Noriko before her trip to Italy, that her school is no longer a cage, but a nest, i.e. a place she can rest. With this newfound emotional gratification and assurance that Noriko will always be with her, Shimako begins to open her heart to others more, and smile more often. It is also stated several times in the novel that Shimako and Noriko looks like a pair of Western and Japanese dolls, and that Shimako has a feverish passion for collecting ginkgo seeds. In contrast to her placid and serious attitude, Shimako's father (who works as a lead monk in their temple) is a lot more light-hearted and hearty, and he was also the one who encouraged Shimako to be open her heart more. ; : :A young girl with a fascination with Buddhist statues and art. She enters Lillian Academy (a strictly Catholic institution) due to an unexpected turn of events. Due to this fact, she faces an astounding cultural shock (from the old-fashioned style school uniform to the students' mannerisms that she finds too antique and too \\"refined\\" to get accustomed to). Even in the novel's narrative, Shimako is referred as \\"Shimako-san\\" from Noriko's perspective, and not the usual \\"Shimako-sama\\" as default to all upper-classmen, and the fact that she hardly uses polite Japanese when talking to Shimako in private, also defines Noriko's detachment from Lillian's culture. She has a straightforward temper that contradicts her calm exterior and becomes Shimako's petite sœur after Shimako enters her second year. Her very plain and jet-black hairstyle makes her look like a traditional Japanese doll, another stark contrast to Shimako's \\"western doll\\" appearance. ;, : :Sei's Onee-sama is not given a name, but appears in flashbacks. She apparently chose Sei because she liked the latter's beautiful face (she said she chose Sei for her face so as to not give the latter any pressure or expectations). She does not pressure Sei to find a petite sœur, nor coerce her into making Shiori into one; rather, she tells Sei to choose her own path without any regrets. In the third novel, Sei describes her as someone who is noble enough to be worthy of the Gigantea title; she really does, care for Sei, as shown after Shiori leaves. Sei began to depend on her a lot after this too. She graduated from Lillian wishing Sei to find a good petite sœur. Foetida family ; : :Played by: Hitomi Miyake :In the beginning of the series, Yoshino is a girl who is very ill and cared for constantly by her grande sœur, Rei. In the second novel, when Yumi was watching Yoshino, Yoshino is described as a girl who is \\"on the skinny side, but not emaciated—simply that she has a small frame\\"; her eyelashes are described to be \\"thick than long\\"; and that she has an aura (maybe because she is sickly at first) that makes one want to protect her and make her a petite sœur. Yoshino is voted as the best petite sœur near the beginning of the series, as everyone considered her to be soft and sweet; this is only her reputation however. Yoshino is very independent and in some ways tomboyish, despite her sickly status and feminine appearance. After her heart surgery, she becomes more energetic throughout the series, and Yumi begins to see more of her fits of temper (usually directed towards Rei). While Yoshino maintains her \\"sweet and gentle\\" image in public, she has apparently grown close and comfortable enough to show her temperamental side to Yumi as well (during their trip to Italy, Yoshino reveals that Yumi is the only one she can comfortably show her weakness to). Yumi also learns that Yoshino is very quick-witted and sharp—Yoshino is able to understand concepts and read between the lines of things so well that Yumi sometimes coins her as a psychic. In addition to being Rei's petite sœur, Yoshino is also her cousin and next-door neighbor. Yoshino admires and very attached to Rei (and has a knack for throwing tantrums at Rei when she gets jealous or over small issues), however she becomes upset with Rei every time she acts overprotective and fragile. ; : :Played by: Rikako Sakata :Rei, Yoshino's grande sœur, appears very tomboyish and 'bishōnen' on the outside, but is in fact quite gentle despite her appearances. In the second novel, she admits that without Yoshino, her real self is just a weak, timid and lonely crybaby. She enjoys reading shōjo novels, her favorite word is 'sincerity', and her hobby is sightseeing. She is involved in kendo, but obsessively cares about Yoshino (and often has to put up with Yoshino's mood swings) and prefers the domestic arts, like cooking, baking and sewing (the scarf and mittens Yoshino wears are all made by her). In the fourth season, she says that, due to \\"unexpected events,\\" she has a ten-year-old boyfriend. ; : :Played by: Nana Akiyama :Rei's grande sœur; one of the most well-respected of the Yamayurikai. She is very gifted and good at almost everything, although she is also enigmatic and eccentric. She has a large forehead, which Sei made fun of when they were young, and began their rivalry. She said once that she chose Rei as her sœur to see if anything interesting would happen. She often has friction with Yoshino, as the younger girl is jealous of her bond with Rei (though Eriko herself finds it interesting to tease Yoshino with regards to this). Eriko has three over- protective older brothers. After leaving Lillian, she studies the Arts. She hates the dentist above all else. She is in love with an older man who is interested in dinosaurs. Schoolmates In Sachiko's year ; : :She is both Editor-in-Chief and president for the Lillian Kawaraban, the school's newspaper. She is hyperactive, dedicated to her duty as president, always thinking of new ways to get the newest scoop, and can at times give Yumi an uneasy feeling. ; : :Sei Satō's ex-lover and best friend who was Sachiko Ogasawara's classmate. Her parents died when she was young. She left Lillian in her first year to pursue her dream of becoming a nun, which broke Sei's heart (who even became angry that she chose God and Maria-sama over her). ; : :Also known as Rosa Canina, she is the star singer of the school choir. She admired Sei, but later on it is shown that she has also found an interest in Sei's petite sœur, Shimako. She left Lillian at the end of her second year to pursue a singing career in Italy, and keeps in touch with Shimako as a penfriend. :In the side story of the nineteenth novel, Shizuka's past is probed - she had a rather gray and lackluster mentality during her first and earlier parts of her second year. As a popular first-year, she received sœur requests from many upperclassmen, but rejected them all (including her choir club president), because she knows she will leave Lillian for Italy soon, and that her heart only longs for Sei. She likened herself as The Little Match Girl, albeit being unable to quench her desire and longing for Sei. The short story revolved around her coming to terms with herself and her resolve in overcoming her inability to approach Sei face-to-face (and thus building up the explanation for her somewhat bold move in taking part in the Yamayuri Council Elections, just to be able to stand in front of and be acknowledged by Sei). ; : :Sachiko's classmate. She is shown as having a stalker-like attraction to Sachiko. The reason for this was because when they were in Lilian Nursery school, Mifuyu fell off the swing and sustained a large gash on her knee. While her friends ran off to get the teacher, Sachiko was the only one who helped her by giving her a handkerchief to stem the bleeding. Since then, Mifuyu has been obsessed with Sachiko. However, upon realizing that Yumi has something that she does not (the thing which attracted Sachiko to Yumi), Mifuyu takes her pigtails off, symbolizing that she finally let her obsession with her go. The author Konno reveals that she made up Mifuyu's name by reconstructing Yumi's name (without the letter \\"K\\" in Fukuzawa). In Yumi's year ; : :Another staff member of the newspaper team, and Minako's sometimes irreverent petite sœur. However, like Minako, Mami herself is also always looking for the latest scoop. Mami also sometimes finds herself being the one to rein in Minako's hyperactive tendencies to run amok. But on the other hand, Minako often wishes that Mami wouldn't be so serious all the time, resulting in a rather unorthodox mix of sœurs. ; : :Played by: Alice Hirose :Yumi's friend and avid photographer, she is the \\"ace\\" of the Photography Club and helps out sometimes for the school's newspaper. Never without her camera, she is always looking to capture the latest gossip about the Yamayurikai, and swears she can never be tied down to having a sœur of her own. She is sharp and constantly on the standby for the best shot; and with a quick brain and tongue to match, she often provides the emotional support and advice for Yumi. She sometimes unexpectedly defuses a few tensions within the Yamayurikai with her camera. ; : :A classmate of Yumi Fukuzawa, and a member of the tennis club. ; : :She is part of the Kendo Club and is an admirer of Rei Hasekura. She went on a date with Rei in the first season after finding Rei's card in the treasure hunt on Valentine's Day. In the fourth season she is the finder of Yoshino's card.  One year below Yumi  ; : :A tall girl with a quiet (bordering on unapproachable - in the 14th novel, Noriko has described her as a \\"lone wolf\\") personality, and on top of that, a big fan of Yumi Fukuzawa, Kanako is introduced in the fourteenth novel, Suzukaze Satsusatsu (A Breath of Fresh Air). During the third season Kanako is actually more like a stalker than a fan and is treated as such when called the \\"Evil Spirit\\" who is following Yumi and the male acquaintances she makes from Hanadera. At first, Yumi was not aware of Kanako's lack of acquaintances and social life, as Kanako actively interacts with her (Yumi has also admittedly felt pressure not to stumble and make mistakes in front of an under-classmen who admires her). She revealed a similar, or even stronger hatred towards men to that of Sachiko, apparently stemming from problems she has with her father (she calls men \\"the lowest possible form of life\\"). Her father had an affair and a baby with Kanako's former senpai, Yūko. Initially, she imagines Yumi as the living entity of a \\"perfect and pure\\" girl (i.e. one who would not involve herself with men), and Yumi admits to Rei that she feels a lot of pressure having to stay on her toes. When that fabricated image was shattered later on (Kanako claims that Yumi's pure self was overtaken by another personality and is no longer her object of admiration, but someone she \\"couldn't care less about\\"), Yumi quickly acts to repair their strained relationship, and finds out that in the end, Kanako still greatly likes her (Kanako had always, and still wants to take a photo alone with Yumi). Kanako later regains her own emotional balance upon her reconciliation with Yūko. She is referred to by Marimite fans as Denpa. She is presented as one of the girls who may become Yumi's petite sœur. She appears briefly in the second season, despite the events of her novel debut not occurring until the third episode of the third season. As of the fourth anime season, she is already close to the Yamayurikai, and, at 179 cm tall, has plans to join the Lillian Academy basketball team. ; :Another staff member of the newspaper team, and Mami's petite sœur. ; : :She is part of the Photography Club. She loves photography, and wanted to be part of the Yamayurikai because of the photos she saw of them. She becomes an admirer of Tsutako. She has an older sister, Katsumi Naitō, who is voiced by Kaori Nazuka.  Two years below Yumi  ; : :A girl in her third year at Lillian Junior High School, and very likely to become Yoshino's petite sœur. Eriko mistook her for Yoshino's petite sœur at a kendo tournament. She is introduced in Soeur Audition.  Others  ; : : Sei Satō's friend and course-mate at Lillian University. She is first seen as the girl who rescued Yumi from the rain along with Sei. Sei mentions that she stood up during the welcoming ceremony when Kei was called because she thought she had heard her own name. ; : :She is the landlady in the lodging house where Kei Katō stays. She is a graduate of Lillian. ; : :Sachiko's grandmother and a graduate of Lillian. She died at the end of the second season but not before reconciling with her old friend, Yumiko Ikegami. ; : :A graduate of Lillian, she wrote the novel The Forest of Thorns under the pen name \\"Sei Suga\\". She was confused with Sei Satō by most of the students of Lillian, which caused an uproar. ; : :Played by: Masahiro Usui :He is Sachiko's cousin and arranged fiancé, because in order that a trusted man inherit the company owned by the Ogasawaras, their engagement was arranged, although Sachiko detests it and denies that he is her fiancé. He is very arrogant, and especially disliked by Sei, but he has prestige in Hanadera Boys' Academy since he is president of the Student Council there when the story begins. He is gay, and seems to have a crush on Yumi's brother, Yūki. Despite his arrogance (and a fast car), he does somewhat cares about Sachiko and is glad she has Yumi as a good friend. He also serves as a representative for the Matsudairas, keeping a close eye on Tōko. He also shows that he deeply cares for Tōko, as shown in the fourth season when, enraged by her bullies at their summer home, he put his car in Race Mode (he put the pedal to the metal) as the traffic lights went green. He has a reputation for his horrible driving skills—many people have given this feedback after taking a ride in his car (such as Sachiko, the Fukuzawa siblings, and Yoko). ; : :The younger brother of Yumi, though both were born within the same year. One common mistake that non-Japanese fans make is that the Fukuzawa siblings are twins. This is not the case. Yumi refers to Yūki as her , which means \\"younger brother that was born within a year\\" and explains why Yumi and Yūki are in the same grade. The Japanese word for twins is . He loves Yumi very much and tries to help her in everything he can. He has good relations with the students of Lillian and is somewhat popular and is the only man that Sachiko isn't afraid of possibly because he is Yumi brother. At the beginning of the series, he did not empathize with Suguru, but Suguru invites Yūki to stay over for New Year's in his house; subsequently Suguru begins to perturb Yūki by giving him the nickname \\"Yūkichi\\". Yūki becomes the president of the Student Council of Hanadera due to his neutrality, as he does not belong to the cultural or sports clubs. ; : :Professor Yamanobe is a teacher at Hanadera. His passion is dinosaurs, and he loves going to the zoo to watch elephants (as he imagines dinosaurs would walk like elephants do). He is a widower with one daughter. His wife died about a year before the events of Itoshiki Toshitsuki. Eriko Torii proposes to him, which he declines. However she refuses to give up and promises him that she will make him fall in love with her.

Painted by Don Christoforo de Castelli. The House of Gurieli () was a Georgian princely (mtavari) family and a ruling dynasty (dukes) of the southwestern Georgian province of Guria, which was autonomous and later, for a few centuries, independent. A few ducal rulers of the dynasty also rose in the 17th-18th centuries to be kings of the whole western Caucasus in place of the hereditary Bagrationi kings of Imereti. Bearing a hereditary title for governors (Eristavi) of Guria since the mid-13th century, Gurieli (literally, \\"of Guria\\") was adopted as a dynastic name by the Vardanisdze family (ვარდანისძე), hereditary rulers of Svaneti (a highland province in western Georgia). The other notable branch of the Vardanisdze was the Dadiani (დადიანი) of Samegrelo. Both of these branches occasionally used double names: Gurieli-Dadiani or Dadiani-Gurieli. ქ. ჩხატარაიშვილი (K.

If the couple had issue, possibly the subsequent ruler Kakhaber (1469–83), the latter-day Gurieli would descend from several Byzantine and Trapezuntine emperors. In the 1460s, when the power of the Bagrationi Dynasty of Georgia was on the decline, the Gurieli pursued a policy of separation and became virtually (formally acknowledged at times) independent rulers (mtavari) of the Principality of GuriaThe early modern foreign sources frequently referred to the Principality of Guria as Guriel after its ruling dynasty. in the mid-16th century,Suny, Ronald Grigor (1994), The Making of the Georgian Nation: 2nd edition, p. 45. Indiana University Press, . but were forced to pay tribute to the Ottoman Empire, nominally recognizing also the authority of the princes of Mingrelia and kings of Imereti. Throughout the following two centuries, the politics of the Gurieli dynasty were dominated by conflicts with the neighboring Georgian rulers, Ottoman encroachment, and repeated occasions of civil strife and palace coups. In the 17th and 18th centuries, as many as four Gurieli rulers managed to be chosen kings of the whole Western Caucasus in place of hereditary Bagrationi kings of Imereti. Gurieli kings however are usually characterized as usurpers, or as counter-monarchs of a rival dynasty. On several occasions powerful neighbors also managed to divert the rule of Guria to members of rival branches of the Gurieli dynasty. Having accepted Imperial Russian sovereignty in 1810, the dynasty continued to enjoy some autonomy in their home affairs until 1829, when the Russian authorities deposed Prince David, the last Gurieli, and annexed the Principality of Guria.Lang, David M.

The majority were liberated from a work site at the village of Ožbalt () about west of Maribor on the railway line to Dravograd in the German Reichsgau Steiermark (Styria), now part of modern-day northern Slovenia. Six of the liberated POWs were separated from the group during an engagement with the Germans a few days after their liberation, but following a 14-day trek across they were flown out of a Partisan airfield at Semič to Bari, Italy. The successful escapees consisted of eight Frenchmen, nine New Zealanders, 12 Australians, and 70 British POWs.Churches (1996), pp. 173–174 Background Allied POWs were used in working camps for various purposes beneficial to the German side. By June 1944 there were several working camps administered by Stalag XVIII-D which was located in Maribor, Slovenia ().Schwarz et al (2012) Prisoners held in one of the work camps were used for maintenance of the railway between Maribor and Dravograd () which continued through the Drava valley and into Austria. This camp is believed to have been Work Camp 1046/GW.Walter Gossner At this time, railways in Slovenia were being regularly sabotaged by Slovene Partisans, who also rescued Allied personnel including aircrew and POWs who had escaped from the Germans.Tomasevich (2001), p. 115 A work party, consisting of about a hundred mostly British POWs were transported from their camp to Ožbalt each morning to do railway maintenance work, and returned to the camp in the evening.Churches (1996), p. 18 There were several other work camps in the vicinity of Ožbalt, mostly doing agricultural work. By late August 1944, the Partisan 14th Slovenia Division, including the 2nd Slovenia Brigade \\"Ljubo Šercer\\", was deployed in strength in the Pohorje mountains south of the Drava river between Maribor and Dravograd.Churches (1996), p. 172 Escape Ralph Churches (right foreground) at Work Camp 1046/GW after an earlier escape attempt The raid was preceded by the escape of seven POWs on 30 August 1944. The organisers of the escape were Private Ralph Frederick Churches, an Australian Army infantry soldier of the 2/48th Battalion who had been on temporary duty with Headquarters ANZAC Corps when he was captured during the Allied withdrawal from Greece in April–May 1941, and Driver Leslie Arthur Laws, a British Army soldier of the 127th (Dorset) Electrical and Mechanical Engineers, Royal Engineers. By August 1944, Churches had already attempted to escape on two occasions and had learned about the surroundings from those experiences. He realised that he had to escape while the prisoners were in an environment hostile to the Germans. Churches had learned to speak passable German during his captivity, and had been the camp leader of the work camp for eighteen months when he resigned the role so he could be involved in the escape.Churches (1996), p. 26 Through a Slovene family who provided water and some food to the prisoners working on the railway, Laws managed to make contact with an agent of the 2nd Slovene Brigade \\"Ljubo Šercer\\", and after discussing this with Churches, they agreed to include all the members of their 8-man accommodation hut at the work camp in their escape plans. In the mid- afternoon of 30 August 1944, seven of the eight POWs walked away from the work site under various pretexts, and met the Partisan agent, who led the group to a village, Lovrenc na Pohorju, which had been temporarily liberated from German control. The remaining member of their hut was unable to get away from his work crew to join them. The escapees comprised three British, two Australian, and two New Zealand soldiers.Churches (1996), pp. 40–41 Raid Commonwealth POWs prior to the escape. The other two men at the rear and the man at the right front (\\"Kit\\" Carson, 6th Australian Division) were all part of the successful escape party Churches managed to convince the commander of the brigade to conduct an operation to free the rest of the work party the following day, by giving him crucial information regarding the work site and the guards. Next morning Churches and Laws returned with some hundred Partisans to await the arrival of the work party by the usual train. As soon as work had begun the Partisans disarmed the eight guards and captured the four civilian overseers. In a short time the POWs, guards, and civilian overseers were being escorted south along a different route than that used by the first seven escapees the previous afternoon.Churches (1996), pp. 49–58 Altogether, 79 more POWs from the working camp were freed. On the same morning ten French and nine additional British POWs were freed by the Partisan brigade from two smaller working camps closer to Maribor. Churches had provided the details of one of the working camps, at a farm with a single guard, and the Partisans had freed the French POWs when they raided a different camp in error. They then corrected their error and released the British POWs from the camp Churches had mentioned. All the groups of POWs, along with their Partisan liberators, assembled in the hills of Pohorje. Altogether, including Churches and Laws and their original group of escapees, a total of 105 POWs were liberated by the Partisans during the escape and subsequent raids.Churches (1996), pp. 60–61 Trek to Semič and aftermath Progress along the evacuation route south was difficult, as German patrols were very active. A night ambush by one such patrol caused the loss of six prisoners, two of them French. Eventually, after marching approximately over 14 days and being ferried across the Sava by boat, they reached Semič in White Carniola, which was a Partisan base with an airfield used for communication with the Allies. After a few days delay waiting for aircraft to be available and weather conditions to be suitable, they were flown across to Bari in Italy on 21 September 1944.Mason (1954), p. 383Lateline – 13 October 2003: 100 POWs make great escape. Australian Broadcasting Corp Both Ralph Churches and Les Laws were decorated for their actions in escaping and assisting the Partisans in planning the raid. Laws was awarded the Distinguished Conduct Medal, and Churches, the British Empire Medal. Churches was repatriated to Australia in November 1944, where after three months leave he was posted to the staff of a prisoner of war camp in Murchison, Victoria as an interpreter. He was subsequently promoted to sergeant and was discharged in November 1945.Churches (1996), p. iv Laws' movements after arrival in Italy are unknown. Churches returned to the site of the raid in 1972 and 1977, and was accompanied by Laws on a further visit in 1985. During these visits Churches and Laws were reunited with several of the Partisans that had escorted them to Semič.Churches (1996), pp. 79 & 56 Conflicting accounts of events Les Laws (right) and another POW at the Maribor working camp before the escape and raid There are two known primary sources regarding the details of the raid, and several secondary sources which drew largely on the accounts of Churches and/or Laws. There is one passing mention of the raid in the \\"Prisoner of War\\" volume of the Official History of New Zealand in the Second World War, which varies significantly from the other sources. The first primary source is the book written by Churches, who was decorated for his involvement in the planning and conduct of the escape and raid. Churches' book, titled A Hundred Miles as the Crow Flies,A Hundred Miles as the Crow Flies was written after he was relieved of his obligation to secrecy by the Australian Army. The book details the events prior to the escape and the course of escape and evacuation. His book is also translated in Slovenian as Vranov let v svobodo (Crow's Flight into Freedom).Vranov let v svobodo Churches was known by the nickname \\"Crow\\" as he was the only soldier from the Australian state of South Australia in the camp, and South Australians are colloquially known in Australia as \\"crow eaters\\". Churches' version of events has been published, in part, by several secondary sources, including Australian television programs aired in 1985 and 2003, and newspaper articles in 1944, 2009 and 2011.Edwards (2011) An Australian POW who was freed in the raid, Private Walter Gossner of the 2/15th Battalion, provided an extremely detailed account of his experiences about being part of a group of 87 POWs freed by Partisans from a location near Ožbalt. He gives the date of the raid as 27 September 1944, four weeks after the date given by Churches. His account has been posted on the internet by his family. Gossner states that he arrived at Semič 21 days after the raid, and his account varies significantly from that of Churches. It is not known why Gossner's dates and other details of his account differ so markedly from Churches' account. The Official History of New Zealand in the Second World War states that the raid occurred at St Lorenzen (the German name of Lovrenc na Pohorju), and that the raid was planned by two British officers. This varies significantly from all of the other sources, and it is unknown why this is the case.

Born in Taber, Alberta, Nugent enlisted in the Canadian Expeditionary Force in 1942. He served in World War II and left the army in 1946. He first ran as a Progressive Conservative for a House of Commons of Canada seat in the Edmonton—Strathcona district for the 1957 federal election. He was defeated by Social Credit candidate Sydney Thompson and finished third out of fourth place behind defeated incumbent Member of Parliament Richmond Hanna. The following year Nugent ran for office again in the 1958 federal election winning with a landslide defeating both Hanna and Thompson in a rematch to win his first term in office. The same election saw Nugent's party—which had been in power for a year with a minority government led by John Diefenbaker—returned with the largest majority government in Canadian history. Nugent was re-elected in the 1962 federal election with a significantly narrower margin then his victory in 1958 - his plurality dropping by almost 10,000 votes in the election that reduced the Diefenbaker Tories to a minority government.

It has been home to a number of notable individuals from Goa, while other prominent persons trace their roots to it. Till the recent past, Moira has been known for its typical, large bananas (known as Mundollchim kellim in Konkani) that grew in the area. Origin of name Village setting The village derives its name from either from 'Moriya', which describes a Mauryan settlement (the 'mor' () was an important symbol of the Maurya empire) or from 'Moim', a locality near Tivim (many of Moira's initial settlers came from Tivim). Moira Church at duskHistorian the late Dr. Teotónio de Souza published a brochure on Moirá for its church's 350th anniversary in 1986. His writing on the same subject is also available in a local text recently released. Christianity The mass conversions of Moira villagers to Christianity are believed to have happened around 1619, according to De Souza. A deed drawn up in Goa on 14 March 1623 and preserved in the National Library of Lisbon records that Joseph de Coutre (known as \\"Couto\\" in Goa) financially assisted the Franciscans to build the first Moira church. This conflicts with the account by Paulo de Trindade, who said that the church was financed entirely by local villagers. The two Flemish brothers -- diamond dealers Jacques and Joseph de Coutre -- lived in Goa at the time the church was being built. Although men and women were arrested by the Holy Office of the Inquisition during its auto-da-fé in the cathedral on 7 December 1664, Moira was relatively unscathed by the Portuguese Inquisition. Moira in recent times Moira village has seen a lot of out-migration, including as part of early Goan migration to then British-ruled Africa, in the 20th century. In the past two decades or so, other settlers have set up homes in the village. In 2020, the local village club -- the Associação Académica de Moira -- celebrated its centenary. It is now also home to some prominent centres of art and cuisine. Village known for different things Moira was once famous for its particular variety of bananas, now only few leftIn his essay \\"The Wise Fools of Moira\\", Prof Lucio Rodrigues describes the village and its villagers thus: Tiatr Festival 2014, Goa.

History The origins of the NAS can be traced back to the formation of the National Association of Men Teachers (NAMT) in 1919. The Association was formed as a group within the National Union of Teachers (NUT) to promote the interests of male teachers. The group existed alongside others within the NUT such as the National Federation of Class Teachers, the National Association of Head Teachers and the National Federation of Women Teachers (later to become the National Union of Women Teachers).M. Ironside and R. Seifert, Industrial Relations in Schools, (London: Routledge 1995), p.72. The formation of the NAMT was in response to an NUT referendum the same year, approving the principle of equal pay. This major change in salary policy had been achieved whilst many male teachers were away serving in the army during the First World War.RA Simons, The Schoolmasters: The History of the NAS and of Education in its Time, (London: NASUWT: 1972) A subsequent three-year campaign by the NAMT to further the interests of male teachers in the NUT saw its name changed in 1920 to the National Association of Schoolmasters (NAS) and finally resulted in secession of the NAS from the NUT in 1922. The secession came about indirectly following a decision at the NAS Conference that year to prohibit NAS members from continuing to also be members of the NUT after 31 December 1922.A. Tropp, The School Teachers: the growth of the teaching profession in England and Wales from 1800 to the present day, (London : Heinemann 1957), p. 216 In its early years, the NAS focused on opposing women teachers. It campaigned against women teaching boys aged over seven, and also against women headteachers in school where men worked. It aimed to recruit every schoolmaster into the NAS, to safeguard and promote the interests of male teachers, to ensure recognition of the social and economic responsibilities of male teachers, and to ensure the representation of schoolmasters on matters concerned with education with both the local education authorities (LEAs) and government.A. Blum (ed.), Teacher Unions and Associations: A Comparative Study, (University of Illinois Press, 1969), p. 54. Although initially only active in England and Wales, it later also accepted members in Northern Ireland. In Scotland, it instead worked with the Scottish Schoolmasters' Association. As the secondary education sector expanded, the NAS built its organisation among male secondary teachers, it adopted the methods of collective bargaining and militant industrial action in pursuing a narrow range of pay and conditions issues related to the interests of full-time male 'career teachers'.M. Ironside and R. Seifert, Industrial Relations in Schools, (London: Routledge 1995), p.97 By the 1960s, the union was still opposed to admitting women as members, but it was concerned that the unions open to women teachers were all hostile to its objectives. As a result, it encouraged the formation of the Union of Women Teachers (UWT).Mike Ironside and Roger Seifert, Industrial Relations in Schools, p.92 The union secured a place on the Burnham committee to negotiate teachers' salaries in 1961, following a series of strikes and rallies. The also affiliated to the Trades Union Congress and the International Federation of Free Teachers' Unions. In 1976, the NAS merged with the UWT and the Scottish Schoolmasters' Association, largely as a consequence of the Sex Discrimination Act 1975, which made it unlawful to exclude from membership on grounds of gender. It became the National Association of Schoolmasters/Union of Women Teachers (NAS/UWT). General Secretaries :1923: A. E. Warren :1941: R.

Are Magnus Bruaset, Aslak Tveito), Springer-Verlag, pp 237-259, 2005. Parallel mesh generation methods decompose the original mesh generation problem into smaller subproblems which are solved (meshed) in parallel using multiple processors or threads. The existing parallel mesh generation methods can be classified in terms of two basic attributes: #the sequential technique used for meshing the individual subproblems and #the degree of coupling between the subproblems. One of the challenges in parallel mesh generation is to develop parallel meshing software using off-the-shelf sequential meshing codes. Overview Parallel mesh generation procedures in general decompose the original 2-dimensional (2D) or 3-dimensional (3D) mesh generation problem into N smaller subproblems which are solved (i.e., meshed) concurrently using P processors or threads. The subproblems can be formulated to be either tightly coupled,Nikos Chrisochoides and Demian Nave. Parallel Delaunay mesh generation kernel. Int. J. Numer. Meth.

Delaunay Decoupling Method for Parallel Guaranteed Quality Planar Mesh Generation. SIAM Journal for Scientific Computing, Vol. 27, No. 4, pp 1394-1423, 2006. The coupling of the subproblems determines the intensity of the communication and the amount/type of synchronization required between the subproblems. The challenges in parallel mesh generation methods are: to maintain stability of the parallel mesher (i.e., retain the quality of finite elements generated by state-of-the-art sequential codes) and at the same time achieve 100% code re-use (i.e., leverage the continuously evolving and fully functional off-the-shelf sequential meshers) without substantial deterioration of the scalability of the parallel mesher. There is a difference between parallel mesh generation and parallel triangulation. In parallel triangulation a pre-defined set of points is used to generate in parallel triangles that cover the convex hull of the set of points. A very efficient algorithm for parallel Delaunay triangulations appears in Blelloch et al.G. E. Blelloch, J.C. Hardwick, G.~L. Miller, and D. Talmor, Design and implementation of a practical parallel Delaunay algorithm, Algorithmica, 24 (1999), pp. 243--269. This algorithm is extended in Clemens and WalkingtonClemens Kadow and Noel Walkington. Design of a projection-based parallel Delaunay mesh generation and refinement algorithm. In proceedings of Fourth Symposium on Trends in Unstructured Mesh Generation, 2003. for parallel mesh generation. Parallel mesh generation software While many solvers have been ported to parallel machines, grid generators have left behind. Still the preprocessing step of mesh generation remains a sequential bottleneck in the simulation cycle. That is why the need for developing of stable 3D parallel grid generator is well- justified. A parallel version of the MeshSim mesh generator by Simmetrix Inc.,Parallel MeshSim is available for both research and commercial use. It includes parallel implementations of surface, volume and boundary layer mesh generation as well as parallel mesh adaptivity. The algorithms it uses are based on those in reference and are scalable (both in the parallel sense and in the sense that they give speedup compared to the serial implementation) and stable. For multicore or multiprocessor systems, there is also a multithreaded version of these algorithms that are available in the base MeshSim product MeshSim Another parallel mesh generator is D3D,D3D Mesh Generator Web page was developed by Daniel RyplUniversity Web page of Daniel Rypl, http://mech.fsv.cvut.cz/~dr/ at Czech Technical University in Prague. D3D is a mesh generator capable to discretize in parallel (or sequentially) 3D domains into mixed meshes. BOXERMesh BOXERMesh is an unstructured hybrid mesh generator Scalable Parallel Mesh Generation developed by Cambridge Flow Solutions.Cambridge Flow Solutions Implemented as distributed-memory fully parallelised software, it is specifically designed to overcome the traditional bottlenecks constraining engineering simulation, delivering advanced meshing on geometries of arbitrary complexity and size. Its scalability has been demonstrated on very large meshes generated on HPC clusters.  Challenges in parallel mesh generation  It takes substantial time to develop the algorithmic and software infrastructure for commercial sequential mesh generation libraries. Moreover, improvements in terms of quality, speed, and functionality are open ended which makes the task of creating leading edge parallel mesh generation codes challenging. An area with immediate high benefits to parallel mesh generation is domain decomposition. The DD problem as it is posed in Chrisochoides N., A Survey of Parallel Mesh Generation Methods, Brown University, Providence RI - 2005. is still open for 3D geometries and its solution will help to deliver stable and scalable methods that rely on off-the-shelf mesh generation codes for Delaunay and Advancing Front Techniques. Finally, a long term investment to parallel mesh generation is to attract the attention of mathematicians with open problems in mesh generation and broader impact in mathematics.

It starts in central Nottingham at a junction with the A60. Initially running east, as Pennyfoot Street, before a right turn sees it head southwards onto Manvers Street, a 4 lane single carriageway which was formerly a B road (B685). The road then crosses the main railway line out of Nottingham to the east over an early 1990s bridge (which again is 4 lane) before meeting Meadow Lane (here unclassified for approximately 100 metres, but further on the A6011) at a triangular roundabout. After leaving the roundabout the road is two-lane dual carriageway with a speed limit for approximately . A further roundabout with Trent Street by a call centre for Virgin Media sees a change to 2 lane single carriageway, as it is for the remainder of its length, retaining the limit. After a further roundabout at Nottingham Racecourse, the limit changes to the national speed limit of until Colwick is reached, when it changes to to pass through a built up stretch. Leaving Colwick the road becomes the Colwick Loop Road, which bypasses Netherfield, Carlton and Gedling. This section was also built national speed limit, but in May 2007 was reduced to concurrent with the opening of the Gedling bypass, or as it was described in the plans, \\"Gedling Integrated Transport Scheme\\". The former section of Colwick Loop Road bypassed by the scheme is now mapped as the A6211, but is unsigned at ground level. Rejoining the former route at a signalled T-junction, we enter Burton Joyce. Initially a limit, approaching the village centre the limit is reduced to . Here, a 1930s bypass would previously have bypassed the bulk of the village but now almost bisects it, as development has spread across the road. Bypassing Bulcote, the road is then again as it opens out towards a roundabout junction with the A6097 at Lowdham. After leaving Lowdham the road is again open single carriageway with a limit. Gonalston is bypassed, and then we pass through Thurgarton, up a steep hill before the road becomes again. The road between Thurgarton and Southwell is relatively undulating and bendy. Entering Southwell from the south-west, passing the leisure centre, we then meet the B6386 at a T-junction where you need to turn off the A612 to stay on the numbered route. After passing the West gate to Southwell Minster, the road turns right at a mini roundabout by the Saracen's Head public house and passes the north side of the Minster. A further sharp bend to the left allows us to pass another racecourse, this time Southwell Racecourse, before exiting Southwell past the former workhouse which is now a museum. Heading east through Upton, past a property owned by the British Horological Society, we meet the A617 near Averham at a signalled T-junction, signalling the end of the route. Plans have been drawn up by Nottinghamshire County Council to bypass Southwell. The plans have existed since before 1990. The County Council has acquired a number of parcels of land in the line of the plan. However, considerable opposition is building up to the plan. Southwell residents are arguing that the 'line' of the bypass will become a new edge of town, and allow considerable expansion of the urban edge of the town, into the sensitive southern aspect. This is the view which includes the historic town centre and views of the Southwell Minster. New traffic measures are suggested as an alternative to reduce through traffic, such as an HGV ban except for access, and downgrading this inappropriate route from Lowdham to Newark, to B road status. Through traffic should be directed at Lowdham and Newark to the newly dualled A46.  Former routes  *The 1922 designation of the A612 had the terminus on the A617 in Southwell, not Averham. The latter passed through Farnsfield, Edingley and Halam, before meeting the A612 in Southwell and continuing through Upton to Newark. *Through Nottingham, the A612 (until the Manvers Street bridge was opened in the early 1990s) passed through Sneinton, Carlton and Gedling, along what is now the B686. *In 2007, following the opening of the Gedling bypass, the bypassed section became A6211 then unclassified. The former route under the railway bridge, and a length of Stoke Lane, are closed to through traffic by using bus plugs. These are traffic signals permanently on a red light unless a bus is passing through it. The restriction has caused controversy amongst local residents especially in the Nottingham Evening Post. *In 2011 The 'Bus Plugs' were opened to normal traffic. The traffic signals are still present but change when any vehicle approaches them. The reopening of the bus plug still causes controversy with many Councillors and locals questioning the validity  External links  *Sabre page on A612 *Sabre 1922 road designation showing original end points Reports of bus plug controversy: *http://www.thisisnottingham.co.uk/displayNode.jsp?nodeId=133965&command;=displayContent&sourceNode;=133948&contentPK;=20089852&moduleName;=InternalSearch&formname;=sidebarsearch *http://www.thisisnottingham.co.uk/displayNode.jsp?nodeId=133965&command;=displayContent&sourceNode;=133948&contentPK;=20398928&moduleName;=InternalSearch&formname;=sidebarsearch *http://www.thisisnottingham.co.uk/displayNode.jsp?nodeId=133965&command;=displayContent&sourceNode;=133948&contentPK;=20089851&moduleName;=InternalSearch&formname;=sidebarsearch *http://www.thisisnottingham.co.uk/displayNode.jsp?nodeId=133965&command;=displayContent&sourceNode;=133948&contentPK;=19885073&moduleName;=InternalSearch&formname;=sidebarsearch Category:Roads in England Category:Transport in Nottinghamshire Category:Transport in Nottingham ","title":"A612 road"},{"id":"13089943","text":"Encyclopaedia Biblica: A Critical Dictionary of the Literary, Political and Religion History, the Archeology, Geography and Natural History of the Bible (1899), edited by Thomas Kelly Cheyne and J.

Description An image illustrating the article 'Ethiopia' – one of the Nubian pyramids at Meroe It has an article for every single name and place both in the Bible and in its traditional Apocrypha, as well as for each of the books of these, together with many improper nouns appearing in these (such as nebi'im, 'mole', 'owl') and other more general subjects (such as 'music', 'tents', etc.). Many of these articles are given in great detail, and usually include mention of the various spellings for each word as used by the Masoretic Text, Septuagint (differentiating between each of the most important ancient manuscripts), and by other ancient versions; the largest article is that on the Gospels, which is over 5 MB in size, despite being almost completely plain text (and therefore over half a million words long). It is thus an extremely large work – in PDF form it constitutes a total of about 190 MB of mostly plain text (this would equate to nearly 20 million words, even at 10 characters per word). It is frequently referenced by other respected Bible-related encyclopedias of the period, such as the Catholic Encyclopedia,for example, it is a source for the article 'Eve' in the Catholic Encyclopedia and 11th Edition of the Encyclopædia Britannica for example. The Jewish Encyclopedia has some articles ('marriage' for example) which quote large sections from it nearly verbatim. It is also referenced by works such as the International Standard Bible Encyclopedia.the article on Aaron, for example It is hence, indirectly, also a source for some articles of the English Wikipedia, mainly related to the Judaeo-Christian religion. A measure of its importance of some of the contributors is gained from the fact that the Jewish Encyclopedia dedicates the majority of the article 'Jerahmeel' to discussing Cheyne's theory of the Jerahmeelites, despite regarding it as arbitrary. The articles are still of value and interest to modern scholars,As reading material suggested by the University of Calgary, for example: As a source for the archaeology department at Tel Aviv University Islamic writers,e.g. as well as to religio-political commentators such as Jihad Watch;Blogging the Qur’an: Sura 17, “The Night Journey,” verses 2-111, Jihad Watch, referenced as 'enc. bib.' however, modern archaeological research and discoveries have made portions of it obsolete, and modern interpretations are of even older material is likely to be very different. For example, the Jerahmeelite/Arabian theory (see below) has long been ignored. It is no longer restricted by copyright and has become available online.

Cheyne's 'surprising' theory about the Jerahmeelites  Professor Cheyne put forth a surprisingJewish Encyclopedia, Jerahmeel theory concerning the Jerahmeelites. In his view they were a powerful north-Arabian tribe, with which the Hebrews came into conflict on their first approach to the land. A part of the Jerahmeelites was absorbed by the Hebrews, but there were many contests between the Israelites and the main body of the Jerahmeelites all through the period of the Kings. Even among the post-exilic opponents of Nehemiah, the Jerahmeelites appear again. Cheyne believes that echoes of these conflicts once reverberated throughout the Old Testament, but that, owing to the corruption of the Masoretic Text, they must now be reawakened by conjectural emendation of the text. Carrying out this idea, Cheyne finds the chief elements of Israel's origin, religion, and history in Jerahmeel. Babylonia and Assyria sink into insignificance beside Jerahmeel in so far as influence on the Old Testament is concerned. \\"Amalekites\\" is a corruption of \\"Jerahmeelites\\"; \\"Beer-lahai-roi\\" (Gen. xvi. 14) is a corruption of \\"Well of Jerahmeel\\"; \\"Ephraim\\" is often a corruption of \\"Jerahmeel.\\" The epithet of Jericho, \\"city of palm-trees,\\" is a corruption of \\"city of Jerahmeel\\"; the names of Saul, of Kish, his father, and of most of the sons of Saul are held to be corruptions of \\"Jerahmeel\\"; and Isaiah's \\"Maher-shalal-hash-baz\\" is held to be a corruption of \\"Jerahmeel will be deserted.\\" \\"Jerahmeel\\" has been displaced by \\"Babylon\\" in Isa. xiii. and xiv.; and Ezekiel's three wise men were \\"Enoch, Jerahmeel, and Arab.\\" This list might be continued indefinitely. By the same principle, he derives other names from \\"Rehoboth\\", \\"Zarephath\\", \\"Mizraim\\", and \\"Arab\\"; he does not equate \\"Mizraim\\" with Egypt (the usual interpretation). The vast majority of names of places and people in the bible are connected by Cheyne to Jerahmeel, or one of these. The ingenuity of Cheyne's method may be admitted; but the thesis must be rejected as altogether arbitrary. That it has received serious attention is owing solely to the great service rendered by its sponsor in other departments of Old Testament research. Cheyne frequently mentions this theory in his Encyclopaedia articles, often appending his view to articles written by people with more mainstream interpretations. He does, however, detail the alternative (and therefore mainstream) views, while doing so. Hence the articles are respected, as long as Cheyne's theory about these names is ignored.

She is the youngest skier ever to win the Finnish alpine ski championship with her gold medal in the women's slalom in 1977 when she was only 14 years old. Between 1975 and 1979 Mustonen won as many as 25 medals in Finnish alpine ski championships, 10 of which in women's category. She won the slalom in 1977 and 1978, giant slalom in 1978 and 1979, and downhill in 1979. She represented the skiing club Ounasvaaran Hiihtoseura of her native Rovaniemi and was a member of the Finnish alpine ski team since 1976. Sara Mustonen started her career as early as in April 1968 at the age of five landing second in the Lapland championships – in the category for girls under 10 years of age. In her next race a week later she finished first, the position she was to hold in her age group and beyond until her untimely death in September 1979. In 1973 she finished fourth at Italy's Trofeo Topolino. In March 1976 Mustonen won all three disciplines at the Nordic Junior Championships (Kalle Anka Trofén) in Duved, Åre as well as earned her first national championship medals in women's category. In 1978 Mustonen was the only woman participant to represent Finland in the Alpine World Skiing Championships in Garmisch-Partenkirchen. She finished 40th in downhill and 44th in giant slalom. In slalom she dropped out in the second run. She competed in the 1978 Swedish Alpine Championships in Dundret, Gällivare, finishing third in giant slalom and fourth in slalom. Mustonen was voted by Finnish sports journalists as the best alpine skier in Finland in two consecutive years, 1977 and 1978. Sara Mustonen was killed in a skiing accident in Hintertux, Austria, after having fallen down into a crevasse during a joint training pass on the glacier. At the time of the accident she was under the auspices of the Finnish alpine ski team who were running a training camp at the location.

Breaclete is within the parish of Uig. Although the village name comes from a geographical feature rather than a steading it is generally believed to be an ancient settlement. The oldest building in the village is the thatched water mill by the shore of Loch Risay which was restored in the 1990s. It was formerly a tiny crofting and fishing settlement of just 12 crofts surrounding the natural harbour of Loch Beag but crofting has now ceased and holiday homes have taken over. The earliest clearly mapped reference is on Murdoch MacKenzie's first Admiralty chart surveyed in 1748. In 1851 J.M. MacKenzie, the Chamberlain to the estate owner Sir James Matheson, proposed that all the tenants of the village were to be evicted and sent to North America on the emigrant ship the SS Marquis of Stafford. This plan was not fully carried through however but it still had a great effect on the village leaving it with a population of just three families. This population was later supplemented through evictions elsewhere notably the clearances of Hacklete and Barragloum villages in the south of Great Bernera. Literature In 1939 the author Neil Gunn stayed in Breaclete and wrote some of his essays for the book Highland Pack there. His experience of staying with Dr PJ Macleod and leaving Loch Beag in the fishing vessel \\"Rhoda\\" for the Flannan Isles provide an invaluable insight into pre-war Hebridean life. This experience was also the inspiration for the most critically acclaimed writing in his most famous work (\\"The Silver Darlings\\"). Also of literary interest are the writings of the former schoolmaster John Nicolson Macleod who lived in the village in the early part of the twentieth century. Writing under the pseudonym Alasdair Mòr (named after the first mate of the \\"Rhoda\\" from croft number 11), his weekly series of highly entertaining articles in the Stornoway Gazette called \\"Litir à Beàrnaraigh\\" (\\"A Letter from Bernera\\") were collected into a book \\"Litrichean Alasdair Mhòir\\" (\\"The Letters of Alasdair Mòr\\") in 1932. These essays outline the distinctive wit, character, courage and craftsmanship of the people of the village and the island of Bernera. John Nicolson Macleod while living in Breaclet was also responsible for compiling the definitive collection of Gaelic poetry from the Isle of Lewis simply titled “Bàrdachd Leòdhais” (\\"Poetry of Lewis\\"). This undertaking finally published in 1916 took him thirteen years to collect. This was done through oral transcript from various sources all over the island which then had a population of over 30,000 accessed by very backward infrastructure. The completed work features poetry from three villagers from Breaclet: Donald MacDonald and Angus MacDonald from croft Number 12 and Angus MacKenzie from croft Number 8. The publication was re-published in 1955. Notable sons Breaclete produced a golden generation of talent in the early twentieth century with most families producing at least one university graduate in addition to regular duxes of the Nicolson Institute. Callum Macdonald Callum Macdonald (1912 - 1999) was born at croft number 10, an Edinburgh history graduate and WW2 Squadron Leader. He was an important literary figure in Scotland, publishing works by Hugh MacDiarmid, Sydney Goodsir Smith, Norman MacCaig, Sorley MacLean and Iain Crichton Smith. An exhibition celebrating his contribution to Scottish and Gaelic literature was held in the National Library of Scotland on the occasion of his 75th birthday in 1987 and his portrait was hung in the Scottish National Portrait Gallery in 1997 to celebrate his 85th birthday. Dr PJ MacLeod Peter John MacLeod (1896 - 1951) was born at croft number 6. He was an award-winning medical doctor who pioneered the rehabilitation of ex servicemen at Gleneagles and Bridge of Earn as well as extensive service with the RAMC. His work was an early study in understanding the effects of posttraumatic stress disorder and was important enough for King George VI to visit in 1943. He conducted a very successful lecture tour of the USA and Canada with the Rockefeller Travelling Fellowship in 1949. Character of the village Breaclete is today home to a small museum, mini-mart & off licence, Bernera School (opened 1881), Bernera Post Office, Lochs-in-Bernera Church (1880), former Free Kirk (1890), War Memorial (1922), Bernera Community Centre with café (1976), petrol station, recreation ground, fire station and doctor's surgery. Many of the older buildings were constructed from Lewisian gneiss hewn from the nearby quarry of Buaile Chruidh. The village has about 35 houses with the oldest 'whitehouse' dating from 1911.

History Source: \\"Des Filles en Ovalie\\", Éditions Atlantica (2005), Written by Jacques Corte / Yaneth Pinilla B. Foreword by Serge Betsen. There are records of women's rugby being played in France as early as the mid-1890s, and in the 1920s a form of the game called \\"barette\\" was very popular, with national championships. However, after the 1930s the game had all but disappeared and was not revived until 1965 when groups of students in Lyon and Toulouse decided to take part in the great charitable campaign against world hunger. Most of them had brothers and friends who played rugby, so they decided to organise a charity game at Bourg-en-Bresse. So successful was this that a regular series of games began, with clubs being formed as students graduated, initially mainly in the south. In 1969 a national association – the ARF [Women's Rugby Association] – was formed. Despite initial opposition to the game from both the government and the FFR (who briefly banned any FFR officials from officiating at women's games) by 1976 12 clubs were taking part in national competitions. In 1982, by which time the number of clubs had more than doubled, the ARF signed a memorandum of understanding was agreed with the FFR which finally gave their official backing – and in the same year France took part in the first ever women's rugby international.

In particular, no caps have been officially awarded for appearances before 1989 (when the FFR became responsible for women's rugby), and most matches in FIRA tournaments after 2004 are uncapped. As a result, there can be a significant difference between the number of appearances players may have made for France and their official number of caps.

The internal Siemens product name is ES 64, with ES for EuroSprinter and the number 64 indicating the 6,400 kW power at rail. Additional information is given in the name on the usage (U as universal, P as prototype and F as freight) and on the number of electric power systems supported (e. g. 2 as two types, 4 as all four systems commonly used in Europe).  Development  Locomotive of Class 127 in Ingolstadt The first prototype ES 64 P was built in 1992, as Deutsche Bahn AG was expected to issue a large order of locomotives as a replacement for the ageing Einheits-Elektrolokomotiven. The external appearance was similar to the earlier Siemens/Krauss-Maffei made dual voltage Spanish RENFE Class 252, delivered in 1991, which in turn used three phase asynchronous drive technology introduced with the DB Class 120.Renfe S/252: Introduction www.railcolor.netEuroSprinter 1st generation www.railcolor.net The prototype was used for extensive tests in some countries in Europe (Norway, Spain, Portugal, Germany). The prototype was given the DB reporting name Class 127. It is still in service with Dispolok, a formerly Siemens-owned locomotive pool for on-hire use.  Standard types   ES 64 F  DB AG Class 152 The ES 64 F is an electric freight locomotive with power and a top speed of . Though it is equipped for passenger services, it is exclusively used for freight trains. It was introduced to Deutsche Bahn AG as Class 152 in 1996 and today is operated by DB Schenker Rail. Its main role is to replace the older Class 150 and Class 151 locomotives on heavy freight trains. The original German order of 195 units was reduced to 170, as the ÖBB decided that the track forces generated as a result of using nose-suspended traction motors exceeded standards and refused to certify them for use in Austria. Instead, DB AG changed the remaining 25 locomotives to Siemens model ES 64 U2 which were assigned as Class 182. With Class 152 DB AG abandoned the CoCo wheel arrangement of the class 150 and 151; with the new digitally controlled anti wheel-slip control the tractive effort should be brought to bear more reliably: nonetheless, some engine drivers argue that in autumn, due to greater power and lighter weight, especially with slippery tracks, heavy trains are hard to accelerate.  ES 64 F4  DB AG Class 189 The ES 64 F4 is an electric freight locomotive with power and a top speed of , in Germany the reporting name is Class 189. It is also equipped for passenger service, but seldom used in that role. ES 64 F4 is equipped for all four electric systems commonly used in Europe (15 and 25 kV AC, 1.5 and 3 kV DC). Because limited space inhibits installation of all safety systems, Class 189 is equipped with various packages giving partial European coverage, e. g. Germany and Switzerland. The braking system includes an electrical energy recovery system. As well as being in service with Deutsche Bahn AG as Class 189, it is also utilized by SBB as Class RE 474. Some units are available to let from the Dispolok locomotive pool.  ES 64 U  DB AG Class 182 Based on the Eurosprinter concept the ES 64 U was developed as a universal electric locomotive with a top speed of . The series ES 64 U is only capable of operating on the 15 kV 16.7 Hz AC supply. It is in service in Austria with ÖBB as Class 1016. Unlike the F series, all U series are equipped with quill drive instead, thus reducing the track forces. The ÖBB assigned the protected name Taurus to Class 1016 (and later to the Classes 1116 and 1216); since then all ES 64 U+ series are widely known as 'Taurus' locos. The ES 64 U2 can also operate on . It is operated by ÖBB as Class 1116, by Deutsche Bahn AG as Class 182 and as well as by MÁV as Class 470 and as a hire locomotive from Dispolok. The Hungarian-Austrian company GySEV (Győr-Sopron-Ebenfurth Railway Corp) operates these units as Class 1047. All four European electric systems can be used by the ES 64 U4. Its electric components are mostly identical to those of ES 64 F4. The four-system series (with the 1500 V capability disabled within the software) are currently used in Austria by ÖBB and the private operator Rail Traction Service as Class 1216, in Slovenia by Slovenske železnice (SŽ) as Class 541 and in Poland by PKP Intercity (PKP IC) as Class EU44 \\"Husarz\\". In Italy RFI assigns it the classification E 190. Taurus locomotives have become notable for the musical-sounding notes, said to resemble an alto saxophone, produced when a train is moving off. The sound comes from the traction converters (German: Stromrichter). Driver's desk controls of ES 64 U2 of the ÖBB. A version of the ES 64 U4 was delivered to the Vogtlandbahn of Germany with the designation Class 183. Although the body is the same as any other ES 64 U4 locomotive, it is dual supply and can only operate on the German 15 kV 16.7 Hz AC and the Czech 25 kV 50 Hz AC systems. Even though these locomotives are only equipped to operate under AC power supplies like the DB Class 182, they received a new class designation because they meet the revised EU Driver Protection Standards which required significant structural changes: these include the entrance doors, from one on each side nearer to the middle of the locomotive to two on each side directly into the locomotive cab. On 2 September 2006 the locomotive 1216 025-5 (prior to delivery to ÖBB) set a new world record for conventional electric locomotives, when, during the trials near Nürnberg, it reached a top speed of . The locomotive was not modified for the record. Since then, this type has become the fastest locomotive in the world.  Derived types   Portuguese CP Class 4700  Also called EuroSprinter ES46B1 are rated at ; these 25 engines use the new Siemens safety cab (later used on Vectron). They are mostly used on freight trains.  Belgian SNCB/NMBS Class 18  Also called EuroSprinter ES60U3, these 120 engines, also featuring the new Siemens safety cab are rated at instead of 6,400 due to the heavier cab, the high-speed bogies () and the multi-system equipment. They are used by NMBS/SNCB on passenger trains only. 24 of them, forming Class 19, are used in fixed consists on M6 rail cars with a GF automatic coupling in order to combine two sets together.  Danish Class EG  Class EG in the former DSB livery For the newly built crossing of the Danish straits (Great Belt Fixed Link) the Danske Statsbaner ordered 13 units of the Class EG which were delivered from 1999 to 2000. Based on the Eurosprinter concept, the wheel arrangement was modified to Co'Co' in order to ensure maximum tractive effort on the ramps. The tractive effort with this class is instead of the usual , with an overall length of . This type is closest in design to a second generation ES 64 F2, capable of operating under 15 kV and 25 kV AC.  Greek Class 120  Greek HellasSprinter locomotive. The OSE Class 120 is the first electric locomotives in service in Greece. From 1996 to 2001 a total of 30 class 120 were delivered. The concept is mostly identical the ES 64 P prototype, with changes to the power () and the electric system (25 kV AC).  China Railways DJ1  DJ1-0003 on Datong–Qinhuangdao_railway The Chinese Ministry of Railways purchased 20 units of type DJ1 freight locomotives, in which the design is based on second generation of EuroSprinter platform, from a joint venture formed by Siemens and Zhuzhou Electric Locomotive Works in 1997. Each 8 axle 2(Bo'Bo') locomotive consists of two coupled single cab 4 axle units.  China Railways HXD1  HXD10151 on Datong–Qinhuangdao railway Initially named DJ4, successor of the DJ1, with more powerful traction motors, higher traction effort and IGBT traction inverters. These locomotives were mainly used for running freight schedules of the Daqin Railway.  China Railways HXD1B  On August 18, 2007, Siemens and Zhuzhou won a contract from the Ministry of Railways to build 500 Co'Co' EuroSprinter-based locomotives, at the time of production the locomotives are amongst the most powerful in the world in commercial production with a power of .  Korail 8100, 8200  Korail 8100 locomotive Korail 8200 locomotive Since 2000, Korea Railroad Corporation (Korail) has continuously built ES64Fs to replace older class 8000 ELs. The Korail 8000 class electric locomotives are powerful but too slow ( maximum) to operate for general passenger train. Currently, 85 ES64F variants are built (2 of Class 8100 and 83 of Class 8200). These new 8100s and 8200s are operating on major Korail lines, including Gyeongbu, Honam, and Jungang Line.  Amtrak Cities Sprinter (ACS-64)  Amtrak ACS-64 The ACS-64 (Cities Sprinter) design is based on the EuroSprinter, but with substantial modifications to meet United States safety standards including crumple zones and an improved safety cage for the driver. It supports all three catenary voltages used in the northeast U.S., which is the only region with substantial intercity electrification.  Developments  In 2010 Siemens announced a successor design, named 'Vectron' incorporating design features of both the Eurosprinter, and Eurorunner locomotives, initially available only in an electric version. The Eurosprinter design is to be continued to be offered by Siemens as well in the short term.The Vectron – Siemens’ new generation of locomotives for rail transportation in Europe Press release , 29/6/2010 , www.siemens.com  See also  *Contemporaries and potential competitors in the European electric locomotive market: **Bombardier TRAXX **Škoda 109E **Alstom Prima locomotives **'Lok 2000' family of locomotives produced by ABB/Adtranz for Swiss (SBB-CFF- FFS Re 460), Norwegian (NSB El 18) and Finnish Railways (VR Class Sr2) *Contemporary Siemens locomotive products **Siemens Eurorunner **Siemens Asiarunner **Amtrak ACS-64  References   Sources     External links  *Siemens Transportation Website *Drehstromloks.de - A comprehensive site about EuroSprinter and other Neubaulok series (German) *Railcolor.net - Another comprehensive site about EuroSprinter and other Neubaulok series *Specification Sheet for the ES64U2 *High quality pictures of ES64F4 at Trainspo Category:Bo-Bo locomotives Category:Siemens locomotives Category:DSB (railway company) locomotives Category:15 kV AC locomotives Category:25 kV AC locomotives Category:1500 V DC locomotives Category:3000 V DC locomotives Category:Electric locomotives of Austria Category:Electric locomotives of Denmark Category:Electric locomotives of Germany Category:Electric locomotives of South Korea Category:Railway locomotives introduced in 1996 Category:Standard gauge locomotives of Austria Category:Standard gauge locomotives of China Category:Standard gauge locomotives of Denmark Category:Standard gauge locomotives of Germany Category:Standard gauge locomotives of Greece Category:Standard gauge locomotives of South Korea Category:Standard gauge locomotives of the United States ","title":"EuroSprinter"},{"id":"13090048","text":"Woodside is a small housing area in the north of Dundee, Scotland.

It is one of the eight rivers rising in the Cheviot Hills, the others being the College Valley, the Harthope Burn, the Bowmont Water, the Kale Water, the Heatherhope Burn, the Coquet and the Alwin. There are two notable villages in the upper Breamish valley: Ingram and Linhope, both of which are in the Northumberland National Park. The Breamish becomes the River Till near Wooler; this is the only tributary of the River Tweed that flows exclusively in England.  Etymology The name Breamish is of Brittonic origin and derived from the verbal root breμ–. \\"bellow, bray, roar\\" (Welsh brefu). This is the origin of the rivers Braan, Scotland and Brefi, Wales.  History  The Salters Road runs from the upper Breamish Valley across the Cheviots into Scotland. This was the historic pack-horse route for carrying salt from the coast into the Scottish borders. On the hills above the Breamish Valley are many archaeological remains of earlier occupations, from Neolithic and Bronze Age burial sites to hillforts, farmsteads, field systems and deserted medieval villages.  Geography  The headwaters of the Breamish are surrounded by hills over 2000 feet (610 metres) above sea level, viz The Cheviot (815m), Hedgehope Hill (714m), Comb Fell (652m), Cushat Law (616m) and Bloodybush Edge (610m).

Brenish is within the parish of Uig. The name of the village is sometimes spelt Breanish (which is generally the spelling used locally), however maps normally refer to Brenish. Geography Brenish is commonly regarded as one of the more scenic areas on the island, although its remote location at the end of the winding and decaying C39 makes it one of the less visited. The village itself runs parallel to the Atlantic coastline and is overlooked by Mealisval, the tallest mountain on the island. It is located next to the village of Mealista which is an uninhabited village known best for its selection of virginal sandy beaches. Mealista is where the road ends, making Brenish the last populated village on the C39. Brenish can be reached by taking the A859 from Stornoway or Tarbert, Harris, then turning on to the A858 towards Garynahine. This route then travels along the B8011, which then becomes the C39 at Timsgarry. The journey takes between 60 and 90 minutes from Stornoway and 90 to 120 minutes from Tarbert (depending on driving experience on the Lewis roads). Mealista beach Geology The \\"Blowhole\\" One of the more interesting features of Brenish is the Blowhole. This is a deep hole in the ground which is roughly 20 metres inland. It has a sea cave which funnels sea water into the hole, sometimes with such ferocity that the sea water blows out the top of the hole. The hole is situated to the north of the village and although it is large it can easily be missed because it is situated in a dip in the ground. There is no fencing around the hole making it a hazard to the unsuspecting walker. Flora and fauna The terrain is mainly heather covered moorland which is peppered with lochs of varying size, which are kept full by the plentiful supply of rain. This land contains high quantities of peat, which is still used by many in the village as a fuel source for heating and cooking. The land between Brenish and Islivig is peat cutting land which has supplied the village with fuel for decades. Due to the wild, damp, salty climate only hardy vegetation is able to survive. There are still a large number of sheep roaming freely and there is an increasing number of deer which can be seen coming into villagers gardens in the evening. Other natives include rabbit, hare, rat, and feral cat. There have also been sightings of frogs in recent years which is a new addition to the area. There are regular sightings of seal fishing for salmon and sea trout in the Brenish bay. Lewis provides a good stop off point for migrating birds which can be seen along with the hardy native seabirds. Golden eagles have also been known to make an occasional visit to the village. Climate The oceanic climate means that Brenish experiences high volumes of rain, with temperatures struggling to reach double figures for a large part of the year. However, Brenish is far enough north to benefit from long summer days where there is daylight for over 20 hours. It is also a good place to view the Aurora Borealis (otherwise known as the Northern Lights). Demography Brenish was once a highly populated village but has suffered a drastic decline in its numbers during the 1900s, brought about by a combination of the younger generation opting to move to the mainland and the demise of the ageing residents. There is very little employment in the local area and the traditional occupation of crofting has itself been in rapid decline since the 1980s. However, since the late 1990s the village has experienced a relative population boom. Over 50% of the population have migrated to Brenish from the UK mainland which has brought with it a feeling of revival. Mealista beach Community Architecture The architecture in the area is fairly typical for the island. Generally the houses are built beside the road, at the top of a croft which itself leads down to the sea. There have been several new houses built since the late 1990s which are changing the face of the village. Religion Brenish, like all parts of the Hebrides, has a strong religious (Presbyterian) population. To this end there is normally very little activity in the village on Sunday. Until relatively recent years even the act of watching television on Sunday would have been frowned upon.

Pais is a red wine grape that has played a prominent role in the Chilean wine industry. Up until the turn of the 21st century, it was Chile's most planted variety until it was overtaken by Cabernet Sauvignon. Today it is most commonly used in the production of jug wine in the Bío-Bío, Maule and Itata River regions in the south. The grape is sometimes known as Negra Peruana. In Argentina the grape is known as Criolla Chica. J. Robinson (ed) \\"The Oxford Companion to Wine\\" Third Edition pg 503 Oxford University Press 2006 History The Pais has one of the longest viticultural history in Chile, believed to have been brought to the region by Spanish conquistadors from Peru during their colonization of the continent in the 16th century. Ampelographers believe that along with the Criolla Grande grape of Argentina and Mission grape of California, that the Pais grape is descended by the Spanish \\"common black grape\\" brought to Mexico in 1520 by the Spanish conquistador Hernán Cortés. That early grape was then cultivated by Spanish missionaries and spread throughout the Americas. The Pais grape remained Chile's primary wine grape until the emergence of the Bordeaux wine varietals in the late 20th and early 21st centuries. K. MacNeil The Wine Bible pg 836 & 840 Workman Publishing 2001 Viticulture and wine Pais produces a thin bodied, rustic red wine that typically has a light brown coloring. The grape's thin skin does not provide much extract and vineyard owners typically harvest at much higher yields than what would be needed to produce higher quality wines. The grape is valued for vigor and ease of cultivation, producing 8–13 tons per acre even with limited amounts of irrigation. It is mostly consumed domestically but some sweet dessert wines have been exported in the past. J.

By the time of Edward the Confessor, the abbey owned slightly more than half the town; the rest being owned by Almar, the Bishop of Elmham. Almar's part was also a manor, and held in William the Conqueror's time by Roger Bigod, 1st Earl of Norfolk. The town was then two miles long, and a mile and a half broad, it extended at that time into Shimpling, Fersfield, Shelfhanger, and Roydon.

It is located to the west of the city of Chester, near the border with Cheshire, England. Along with the nearby village of Broughton, the population was 5,791 at the 2001 Census. History The placename Bretton is probably derived from the Old Norse (ON) Bretar 'relating to the Britons (historical), the Welsh (people)' and the Old English language (OE) tūn 'farm or estate'Page 20, The Place-names of East Flintshire. Hywel Wyn Owen. University of Wales Press. Cardiff. 1994 The original settlers in Bretton were Viking welshmen, possibly second or third generation expatriates, distinctive in origin, culture, dress, accent or speech, who may well have called themselves, or been described by the English (and perhaps the Welsh), as ON Bretar rather than OE Walas or OE Cumbras.Page 21, The Place- names of East Flintshire. Hywel Wyn Owen. University of Wales Press. Cardiff. 1994 Bretton Canal (also known as Sir John Glynne's Canal) was the western end of the waterway that crossed the Saltney Marsh on a route for two miles, and then turned to meet the new channel of the Dee a short distance away. It was used to transport coal from the mines owned by the Glynne family. The canal was abandoned in 1775 after only 10 years use, it eventually disappeared with the Saltney Marsh Enclosure Act of 1778. The village has had two public houses, The Grosvenor Arms, located adjacent to the bakery and nicknamed \\"The Dogs\\" and The Glynne Arms located near the station. The Grosvenor Arms closed in the early part of the 20th century and The Glynne Arms closed in 2007 and re-opened in 2010 as The New Glynne Arms. Bretton also has a water pump on a roadside green. The disappearance of the pump during remodelling of the road junction was a source of concern to local residents in the 1970s, until it was traced to a council storage yard and reinstated. Bretton Wood (south east of the village) is marked on Ordnance Survey maps of the area, in past times it was referred to as Bretton Forest,Page 22 The Place-names of East Flintshire. Hywel Wyn Owen. University of Wales Press. Cardiff. 1994 it stretches a considerable distance into Lower Kinnerton and Dodleston where it is known as Black Wood. The wood was cut into two parts when the Chester Southerly By-pass (A55 road) was constructed in 1976. Bretton Lodge was a gatehouse, at the entrance of Bretton Wood for the carriage road that led, via Balderton, Cheshire to Eaton Hall, Cheshire, evidence suggests that a lodge building was present in the 17th century.Page 23 The Place-names of East Flintshire. Hywel Wyn Owen. University of Wales Press. Cardiff. 1994 It was demolished in the early 1980s to make way for the extension to the bridge over the A55 road. On 26 September 1976 a disaster struck the houses adjacent to the south side of the main Chester road (now the A5104 road). Workmen in Saltney left a drainage ditch with a temporary cofferdam in place over the weekend that caused extensive flooding when the water from a deluge of rain backed up and flooded all the houses and surrounding land. In 2010 a residents committee was formed, Bretton Residents Action Group (BRAG), to ensure that future development surrounding the village did not adversely affect village life and to develop community activities. A link to the village website is at the foot of the webpage. Methodist Chapel The current Methodist chapel was built in 1859, although evidence suggests that Methodist worship was present in the village before this. In 1830 a petition was submitted to the House of Lords stating that the Members of the Methodist Congregation assembled at Bretton, in the County of Flint, whose Names are thereunto subscribed; praying their Lordships \\"to adopt Measures for the Extinction of Slavery, and the Extension of all the Blessings of Freedom to the utmost Limits of the British Empire; and for a Reform of Parliament:\\"From: 'House of Lords Journal Volume 63: 26 November 1830', Journal of the House of Lords: volume 63: 1830-1831, pp. 129-135.

The land that lies to the south of the village was part of the Eaton Estate belonging to the Grosvenor family, the land to the north of the village was part of the Gladstone Estate, formerly belonging to the Glynne family. Several farming properties and tied cottages carry emblems or design features of these estates. Many diverse farming practices have been seen during the 20th and 21st century these include traditional arable and small herd dairy farming, intensive pig farming and turf farming. Catherine Farm (and Mary Farm in nearby Broughton, Flintshire) disappeared from the landscape when the Vickers Armstrong aircraft factory was built in 1939. ;Farms- ;Bretton Hall :- The boundary between Bretton in Wales and Dodleston in England cuts through the corner of this farmland.Page 22.

Industry and Commerce After World War II a large British Road Services (BRS) depot and vehicle workshop, Premier Garage, was built on the main road, later becoming a commercial vehicle garage, undergoing several name changes; H&J; Quick, Quicks of Chester, Bramhall Quick and now Evans Halshaw. A provender mill was built at the end of Broughton Mills Road, Bretton to provide animal feed for the area. After the mill closed it was taken over, for a period, by the No-Nail Box Company for manufacture and distribution of their products. Several haulage and storage firms used the premises in the 1980s before the whole building was refurbished and became a curtain factory. Transport The Mold Railway Company in 1847 were authorised to build a railway from Mold, Flintshire to Saltney. As well as transporting minerals mined in the Mold area, the railway also carried passengers. Opened in August 1849, the station provided a transport link for local residents. When opened the station was called Broughton but it was renamed by the LNWR in April 1861 to Broughton Hall. It received another name change in July 1908 to Broughton and Bretton. Broughton & Bretton Station in 1961 The station closed to regular passenger services on 28 April 1962 but it remained in use for a workmen's train service from Chester to serve the nearby aircraft factory until 2 September 1963. After lying derelict since the closure of the railway, the station became a private dwelling before becoming the Station House Veterinary Centre, Bretton. Bretton used to be connected via road link to Broughton via Bretton Bridge. This was an old railway bridge that existed until the creation of the Broughton Park shopping complex. The bridge is now a public footpath with flagpoles at its summit. It is also of interest to note that in the late 1980s, residents in the Boulevard, Broughton have found remains of railway sleepers in rear gardens, from when the railway connected the villages of Broughton and Kinnerton. From the top of Bretton Bridge, the route of the former railway can be discerned. Part of the former trackbed is now a surface water drain within the country park in Broughton.

Solution  An error- correcting code is a way of encoding x as a message such that Bob will successfully understand the value x as intended by Alice, even if the message Alice sends and the message Bob receives differ. In an error-correcting code with feedback, the channel is two-way: Bob can send feedback to Alice about the message he received.

The date of the founding of the village is unknown, but according to the oldest chronicles local castle has been already built in 8th century in the times of Přemysl the Ploughman. From the end of 12th century, there is a Romanian church dedicated to the patron of miners st. Jacob. It is located in the area Rovna. The old name \\"Rock of the Silver Mountains\\" shows that silver has been mined in these places since ancient times. The Skalice mines were closest to Prague and gave impulse to the construction of a Prague mint during the reign of Ferdinand I (1526–1564). This event has become an important moment in the history of Skalice as a mining town. Right in the Skalice there are still preserved the old mining shafts. The oldest silver sealer from 1610 is stored in the Kolín State Archive in a silver case. Stříbrná Skalice today includes parts of Kostelní Střimelice, Hradová Střimelice and Hradec. There are several ponds, including the Hruskov and Propast ponds.  In popular culture  The village features prominently in the video game Kingdom Come: Deliverance, developed by Czech studio Warhorse Studios and set during a war between forces loyal to Wenceslaus IV and his brother Sigismund in the early fifteenth century. The town, known in-game as Skalitz and then ruled by Radzig (Racek) Kobyla, falls victim to an army of Hungarian Cumans loyal to Sigismund at the beginning of the game.

A pioneer of the radio call-in talk show format, Phillips delighted in a form now banned by the FCC: putting people on the air without their knowledge. Early life Phillips was born in Portsmouth, Ohio. Six years later, after his father's death from tuberculosis, his family (including three siblings) moved to Cincinnati. Phillips later dropped out of high school to join the United States Army Air Forces during World War II, but he ended up in Georgia in a tow target squadron assigned to fly practice targets for fighter pilots and anti-aircraft artillery. After the end of World War II, he attended drama school for a while and then became a disc jockey in Grand Rapids, Michigan. A year after beginning his DJ career he returned to Cincinnati. Radio career Cincinnati Phillips expanded his career as a radio personality at WLW in Cincinnati where he established his call-in format and his trademark style of remixing prerecorded interviews as a comedy piece. He was eventually fired after he inserted a phony item into a newscast. Discussing this piece in a 1976 interview with the Chicago Tribune, Phillips said, > \\"I wrote, 'All members of infantry company so-and-so report immediately to > your draft board,' and I described an insurrection in some phony country. He > read it on the air. Hell, they even had the FBI all over the station.\\" Chicago Later, Phillips moved to Chicago, Illinois along with staff announcer, and future Bozo the Clown star, Bob Bell. The two started at WGN (AM) in 1956 after being introduced as \\"comedians from Cincinnati\\". His WGN morning show was consistently top-rated in Chicago, and led to his being labeled \\"the king of morning radio.\\" At the height of his popularity, Phillips attracted nearly 1.5 million listeners, a now unheard-of 50% market share. Innovations Phillips was one of the first broadcasters to routinely use humorous and offbeat phone calls in his show, including prank phone calls. Sometimes, he called random payphones to see who would answer. For example, he called a pet cemetery to arrange a funeral for his mouse, and on another occasion he tracked down Benjamin Gingiss, founder of Gingiss Formal Wear, while the man was on vacation in the Bahamas to ask him where the fire extinguishers were kept in the store. Another time, Phillips called Ipanema, a neighborhood located on the southern region of the city of Rio de Janeiro, Brazil, and inquired whether there were any women there who were \\"tall and tan and young and lovely.\\" He tried to order pizza from Rome and even tried to return a natural Christmas tree weeks into the new year because it had browned and lost all its needles. On one occasion, he managed to obtain Luciano Pavarotti's hotel room number, and called to ask if the singer would give Phillips opera lessons and \\"teach [Phillips] to sing flat, like you do.\\" Phillips was the first to offer a $1 million prize to listeners—as a part one of his most famous and longest-running promotions in which he would debunk self-proclaimed psychics on the air. Listeners were invited to guess what celebrity name was written inside \\"Wally's Black Box.\\" No one ever successfully guessed the name. He eventually revealed the note bearing the name of Jean Rogers, a movie heroine Phillips admired for her role as Dale Arden in several Flash Gordon film serials. Another unique aspect of Phillips' show was a large library of sound bites, each just a few seconds in length, which could be played on short notice in response to something that was said. A mundane example would be an announcement by Phillips followed by Groucho Marx's voice (from a line in Duck Soup) saying, \\"Make a note of that!\\" Instead of using carts or reels, Phillips' engineers found it more convenient to cut a disk with a transcription lathe to keep everything at the ready. WGN was still using the devices strictly for the Phillips show as late as 1985, costing the station more than $20,000 yearly.A look at the WGN transmitter and site where the two machines are now stored-2004 Retirement In 1998, he retired from WGN radio after 42 years, twelve years after giving up the morning show where he was succeeded by Bob Collins, who continued the format and the high ratings. Phillips then hosted a two-hour Saturday morning radio show on WAIT in Crystal Lake, Illinois for some years afterward. Phillips was inducted into the National Radio Hall of Fame, in the Museum of Broadcast Communications in 1993 and into the National Association of Broadcasters Hall of Fame in 1997, marking his 50th year in radio. On October 21, 2004, the street corner of Rush Street and Delaware Street in Chicago was designated as Honorary Wally Phillips Way. Personal life In 1969, Wally Phillips founded the Neediest Kids Fund, which has since raised $35 million for charity. Phillips was married three times - all to the same woman, Barbara. He had two daughters Holly and Jennifer, and a son, Todd. He died in Naples, Florida on March 26, 2008 after suffering from Alzheimer's disease for the previous five years.

L. Carr to publish his maps, pocket books and novels.Carr, J. L. (1987) An Inventory and a History of the Quince Tree Press to mark its 21st year and the sale of its 500,000th small book. August 1987. Kettering: The Quince Tree Press The Press is now run by his son Robert Carr and his wife, Jane.  History of the press  The house in Kettering where J. L. Carr established the Quince Tree Press When Carr took 2-year leave of absence from teaching in 1967 aged 55 years with savings of £1,600, his aim was to see if he could make his living by selling decorated maps of English counties and small pocket books of poems. These he published from his house at Mill Dale Road in Kettering, Northamptonshire, under the imprint The Quince Tree Press. The quince is a fruiting tree native to the Caucasus and there was one in the front garden of Carr's house. Carr's maps are of architectural and historical interest rather than being geographical, and give brief details, observations and quotations in a quirky style about buildings, historical events and people related to places in the old counties of England, before they were reorganised in 1974. The maps are meant to be read and framed and to stimulate conversation. Carr's small books are typically 16 stapled pages, usually about 13 x 9 cm, with decorated card covers. Carr wrote: 'These books fit small envelopes, go for a minimum stamp and are perfect for cold bedrooms - only one hand and a wrist need suffer exposure'. Carr recorded in 1983 that sales of the small books reached a peak in 1980, when he sold 43,369 copies,Carr, J. L. (1983) \\"A double life in literature\\". The Author; Vol 44, No 4, pp. 102 - 104. and by 1987 he had sold more than 500,000 in total. Many titles are still published by the Quince Tree Press, as well as some new ones, for example Florence Nightingale and Laurence Sterne. Carr sold his novels and small books published by the Quince Tree Press directly to booksellers and by mail order to readers, and offered copies of his other novels bought as remainders from his previous publishers. For example, Carr obtained 900 remaindered copies of The Harpole Report from Secker and Warburg at 12 pence each and was able to sell them all at their full price of £1.75 after Frank Muir had named it on Desert Island Discs as the book he would take with him to the imaginary island. Novels by J. L. Carr published by the Quince Tree Press At the age of 76 years and unhappy both with the different publishers of his six novels to date and with the advance that he had been offered for his seventh novel, Carr decided to publish the next book himself. What Hetty Did was published as a paperback by the Quince Tree Press in 1988 in an edition of 2,850 copies and was soon reprinted.Rogers, Byron. (2003). The Last Englishman: the Life of J. L. Carr. London: Aurum Press. Carr followed this novel four years later with his last, Harpole & Foxberrow General Publishers, in an edition of 4,000 copies. Carr also bought back the rights to the novels A Month in the Country, How Steeple Sinderby Wanderers Won the F.A. Cup and The Battle of Pollocks Crossing and published them under the imprint of the Quince Tree Press. Since Carr's death in 1994, the rest of Carr's novels have been reprinted by the Quince Tree Press. *(1988) What Hetty Did. (). First edition.

In each of his novels published by the Quince Tree Press Carr cited words by Beatrice Warde, an eminent American typographer: \\"This is a Printing Office, Cross-roads of Civilisation, Refuge of all the Arts against the Ravages of Time. From this place Words may fly abroad, Not to perish as Waves of Sound but fix'd in Time, Not corrupted by the hurrying Hand but verified in Proof. Friend, you are on Safe Ground: This is a Printing Office.\\"  Illustrated maps  A literary map of Yorkshire by Carr Carr drew his first map in 1943, of England and Wales, while stationed in West Africa during the Second World War. Carr reported that the first four maps he published were of Yorkshire, Gloucestershire, Kent and Norfolk and initially sold for £1 each. However these may have been preceded in late 1965 by what Carr called a 'longsheet', a narrow printed drawing showing towns and places in Northamptonshire which stated at the base: 'Travellers are warned that the use of this map for navigation will be disastrous'. The first five maps given ISBNs were Hampshire (December 1968; ), Wales (March 1969, ), Sussex (June 1969; ), Kent (September 1969; ) and Yorkshire (September 1969; ). An ISBN was allocated to 54 maps in total, the last issued in December 1976 (Westmoreland, ), but no maps have been seen with a printed ISBN. The different versions of most county maps were not numbered or identified sequentially and only a few were dated, so it is hard to tell in which order they were published. Versions may be distinguished by the number of sheets printed, which was usually recorded on later maps, and assuming that the number was different for each version. The first versions of maps seem to have been issued in editions of 250, 350 or 500 sheets. Robert Carr has reported that some of the maps had editions related to the year in which they were printed. For example, an edition of 978 sheets was probably first published in 1978. The number of sheets of the versions recorded with an ISBN and seen or held in private or public collections are given below and range from 250 to 982 with an average of about 750. If the number of sheets issued was recorded on the version then each individual map was usually numbered by hand, although unnumbered copies are known. The number of different versions published before August 1987, the date of Carr's history of the Press, is shown in parentheses below and at least three new maps (Buckinghamshire, Westmoreland and Wiltshire) were added after 1987. A total of 97 maps were either reported by Carr in his history of the Quince Tree Press, or have been seen. There may be more maps and more versions. A new map of Northamptonshire was produced in 2005 by Robert and Jane Carr. Carr's illustrated maps were printed on single sheets of thick paper of various types and range in size from 50 to 65 cm high and 35 to 55 cm wide, depending on the shape of each county. The early maps were printed in monochrome but some were hand coloured by Sally Carr. Later maps were printed in colour. Most of the maps were numbered by hand and signed by Carr. Carr often sent proof copies of new maps to retailers. These were printed on thin, poor quality paper, and were marked PROOF. The maps were chiefly printed by Messrs Richardson or Seddon, local printers in Kettering. The list below gives details where known of: the number of different maps of each county, shown in parentheses, as recorded by Carr in 1987 in his history of the Quince Tree Press; the date of publication with the ISBN, although such numbers seem only to have been applied to maps published between 1968 and 1976 and were not noted on the maps themselves; and the number of sheets, if known, which are not necessarily given in the order of publication. *England and Wales.

Small books  Carr's small books are typically 16 stapled pages, 13.0 cm high by 9.5 cm wide, with illustrated card covers unless otherwise noted. Carr launched the series in 1966 with books of poems by William Blake, Andrew Marvell and John Clare whose grandson, Albert, a retired co-op milkman, lived on the same road. The first edition of John Clare's poems was published by Carr for the Northants County Association of the N.U.T., not by the Quince Tree Press.Clare, John (No date). John Clare Northamptonshire Poet 1793 - 1864. Kettering: J. Carr, 27 Mill Dale Road, Kettering for the Northants County Association of the N.U.T. Some of the early books of poems were given an ISBN by Carr from a list of 100 numbers that he was allocated as a publisher, but he did not allocate the numbers in order and did not print the ISBN in any small book that he published. The early titles were registered as published in a Florin Poets Series or a Mini-poets Series. A few books are dated or can be dated by their publication to coincide with a particular event, such as the Peasants' Revolt of 1381. Some books are numbered, but the numbers are not always unique: at least nine are numbered 71 (Francis Bacon, Thomas Bewick, Geoffrey Chaucer, John Donne, Hilda Frank, Joan Hassall, Samuel Johnson, Bryan North Lee and the Rossettis) and six are numbered 85 (John Bunyan, Gerard Manley Hopkins, Edwards Lear, the Devil's Dictionary, The Dictionary of Parsons and Henry Vaughan). It seems that Carr applied a partial numbering system retrospectively in the order in which he published the work of a poet. For example, a later impression of the poems of Andrew Marvell is numbered 3, but no impressions of any small books numbered 1 or 2 have been seen while no small books numbered 4,5 or 6 have been seen but two are numbered 7 (Rupert Brooke/Wilfred Owen and William Barnes). A few of the dictionaries list the impressions published but none of the books of poems list the printing history. Carr mostly had 3,000 copies printed at a time, sometimes using a different background colour on the cover for a new impression. Carr is known to have published at least 102 small books in his series, most of which are listed below. Many titles are currently reprinted by the Quince Tree Press, which is now run by Robert and Jane Carr in Bury St Edmunds, and they have published several new titles, which are noted.  Poets  Most small books are of the work of a single poet, some are of two, usually printed back to back, such as Rupert Brooke and Wilfred Owen. There are at least two editions of some poets: for example, there are two editions of poems by Thomas Herrick and George Byron, each issued with a different cover. But there are also at least two editions of different poems of John Clare, both of which used the same photograph of a bronze bust of Clare on the cover. The numbering of editions may not necessarily be consecutive. The first book of the poems of Robert Herrick, which is entitled Ten Poems and is not numbered, was probably published before the second, entitled Parson and Poet, which is numbered 9 in the series. Carr seems to have applied the number 9 retrospectively to the second book, perhaps because the first book of Herrick's poems was the ninth that he published. No numbered editions of the poems of William Blake or John Clare have been seen, which were two of the first three titles, but a later edition of the poems of Andrew Marvell is numbered 3. *Matthew Arnold.

Dictionaries  Carr's dictionaries have their origins in the Year Books of the Midlands Club Cricket Conference in the early 1950s, nearly 30 years before the first dictionary was published.Hall, Andrew (2011). Extra- ordinary cricketers & handfast spouses. Slightly Foxed, No 32, Winter 2011, pp 69-76. For the 1950 Year Book Carr wrote 'A Miniature Anthology for Damp Days', a collection of quotations and anecdotes about notable cricketers, then followed this in the 1951 Year Book with a cartoon and more entries, seemingly to fill empty spaces at the bottom of pages. Carr developed this idea fully in 1977 when he published a 16-page dictionary containing 126 entries on notable cricketers and events related to cricket. It was an immediate success and led to an order from the bookseller W. H. Smith, for 4,000 copies of a title that had initially been printed in an edition of only 3,000. This popular bookseller may also have sold early editions of some poets as an edition of William Barnes is known to contain a W. H. Smith & Son price sticker for 10p, which dates it after Decimal Day in February 1971. The Dictionary of Extra- ordinary Cricketers was reprinted at least nine times between 1977 and 1981 before it was republished by Quartet Books in 1983. A new edition with cartoon illustrations drawn by Carr was published by Aurum Press in 2005. Carr's wife, Sally, proposed the next Dictionary, of English Queens, to coincide with the Silver Jubilee of Queen Elizabeth in 1977, which he then followed with a Dictionary of English Kings. Carr is believed to be the author of Welbourn's Dictionary of Prelates, Parsons, etc, as Welbourn was his mother's maiden name. The compiler of two dictionaries of eponymous terms, A. J. Forrest, was a cricket writer, while the only biographical information provided about Mr R. G. E. Sandbach, who compiled the Dictionary of Astonishing British Animals, was that he lived in Tunbridge Wells.Sandbach, R. G. E. (date unknown). Sandbach's Dictionary of Astonishing British Animals. Kettering: The Quince Tree Press. Carr said that he was planning other dictionariesSimpson, H. (1986). The mysterious J. L. Carr. A twenty-first anniversary portrait.

Artist's picture books Although Carr's first picture book celebrated the work of the English wood engraver Thomas Bewick, his main aim was to champion the small number of 20th century wood engravers, whose work he thought was neglected. Each book contains small reproductions of examples of each artist's work with no text, usually printed on better quality paper than the small books of poems.

The 30-minute show is produced by Ambience Entertainment is aimed at 8-14 year olds. Sharky competes against children contestants, who are addressed as 'friends', in word games. In each episode, there are two or three friends that separately compete against Sharky to win prizes. If Sharky wins, the contestant receives a \\"consolation\\" prize. The show began in a weekday afternoon timeslot but after two weeks after its debut, was moved to Saturday and Sunday morning timeslots. There have been themed episodes including; a tropical themed episode, a pirate themed episode, a spooky themed episode, yellow themed episode, and numbers and dates themed episode. Gameplay Miranda gives clues to a word of which only a portion of the letters are shown. The contestant has a chance to guess what the word is and if they are wrong, Sharky has a chance to guess. If he gets it wrong, which is usually the case, the contestant has another attempt with more letters revealed. This will go on until either one gets it right, in which case they will win a \\"fish cake\\", which closely resembles a large inedible cupcake with icing and plastic toy fish. Miranda often says that they will break your teeth if you try to eat them. The first player to win three fish cakes is the winner, and if the child wins 3 nil, it is known as a Shark Blitz. In this case Miranda will ring a special bell Smelly Telly As well as the word games, a game called Smelly Telly is played, usually when there is a score of 2/1 and never more than twice per show. While a covered raised silver plate is sneaked onto the set, Sharky will sing a song about Smelly Telly which he probably makes up while he goes. Miranda puts blindfolds on the players, one resembling goggles for the contender, and one resembling headphones for Sharky, since he has eyes on either sides of his head. Miranda reveals what the smell is coming from, and even if it is a good smell, the audience will make sounds like it is bad. The players each get a smell, and are allowed to guess and win a fish cake if they are correct. If both players are incorrect, however, unlike the word games, no fish cakes are won, and the players will only get one chance to guess.

The song features rapping vocals by graffiti artist Futura 2000, who had previously designed the sleeve for their \\"This Is Radio Clash\\" 7\\" single. Poly Mandell plays keyboard on this track. Writing, recording, and release White funk became prominent in London during the early 1980s with bands like the Jam, Spandau Ballet, and Haircut One Hundred. \\"Overpowered by Funk\\" was originally recorded at Ear Studios (also known as The People's Hall of Frestonia) in London in September 1981 by the four members of the band jointly with the rest of Combat Rock, using a mobile recording studio taken on loan from The Rolling Stones. In December 1981, they moved to New York City to complete the album. The recording sessions were carried out at the Electric Lady Studios, located at 52 West Eighth Street, in New York City's Greenwich Village, where Futura 2000 and Tommy Mandel, credited as Poly Mandell, provided their additional parts. It was first released as a promotional recording in the United States and in Argentina, just before the release of the album. Combat Rock was released on 14 May 1982. An instrumental version of the song is featured on Hell W10, a black-and-white silent film written and directed by Joe Strummer. Hell W10 was filmed in the summer of 1983 and then included in The Essential Clash in 2003. The Argentinean promo of the song is featured on the 2006 compilation albums Singles Box.

It was played and also recorded on some bootlegs during the nights at the Théâtre Mogador in the fifth district of Paris, between 24 and 30 September 1981, where the band was premiering various tracks from the upcoming Combat Rock. Reception and legacy \\"Overpowered by Funk\\" has generally received positive reviews from music critics. On his book The Clash: The Music that Matters, Tony Fletcher described the song as \\"a self-evident slice of hard- hitting Clash funk\\". Trouser Press Ira Robbins viewed the track as a \\"rhythm- intensive [number]\\". David Fricke of Rolling Stone regarded the tune as a \\"locomotive disco steam\\". New Yorker author and political essayist, Mitchell Cohen, in his review of Combat Rock for High Fidelity, considered \\"Overpowered by Funk\\" as an \\"aptly titled\\" song and describes it as a \\"razor-sharp swipe from The Book of (Rick) James\\", specifying both this song and \\"Red Angel Dragnet\\" \\"cover aspects of the New York City transit system\\". Jamie Atkins, a writer for Record Collector, described the song as \\"jittery\\" and views it as one of the experimentations which can be found on Combat Rock. Paste reviewer Douglas Heselgrave thought \\"Overpowered by Funk\\" was one of the most \\"radical and challenging [songs]\\" that The Clash have recorded during their musical career.

Mike Maneval, who wrote for The Williamsport Sun-Gazette, considered the tune as \\"unadulterated funk\\", adding that it is \\"less neurotic and with more confidence than late Talking Heads and just shy of the funk pinnacle George Clinton and Parliament/Funkadelic.\\" Brian Chin of Billboard provided a mixed review of the song ; while he regarded \\"Overpowered by Funk\\" as a song with a \\"great rhythm track\\", he also believed this song \\"gets a bit wordy\\". Uncuts Gavin Martin provided a negative review for \\"Overpowered by Funk\\", considering the \\"half-cocked rap\\" of the song as a \\"Sandinista!-style failed [experiment]\\". \\"Overpowered by Funk\\" inspired MGMT's \\"Time to Pretend\\", a song listed on Rolling Stones list of \\"The 500 Greatest Songs of All Time\\", and on NMEs list of \\"The 500 Greatest Songs of All Time\\".

Barges built to this gauge are called berrichons. They could carry about 60 tonnes of freight over the summit of the Canal de Berry but their draught allowed them to carry up to 100 tonnes on other French waterways. By 1865 there were 890 berrichons on the waterway, drawn by teams of two to four horses, mules or donkeys. The main traffic of the canal was cast iron from the forges at Montluçon, and coal, pit props, wines and spirits.H. McKnight. Cruising French Waterways, Adlard Coles, 1991 However despite a new pumping station in 1878, leakages caused a lowering of water levels so the canal was never upgraded to the Freycinet gauge.

It is the opening track from her debut studio album Real Girl, and was released in the United Kingdom on 22 October 2007 as the album's third single. \\"Just a Little Bit\\" is an R&B; song with elements of soul. It received generally positive reviews from music critics, who commended Buena's vocal performance. The single peaked at number 65 on the UK Singles Chart. Buena performed it at The Borderline, London in April 2007. Development and release \\"Just a Little Bit\\" was written and produced by the British musician Eg White, who wrote the song in collaboration with Pam Sheyne. The song was recorded by English singer Mutya Buena for her debut studio album Real Girl (2007), and serves as the album's opening track. \\"Just a Little Bit\\" was released in the United Kingdom on 22 October 2007 as the third single from Real Girl. Buena spoke about her nervousness about the song's release, saying: \\"I think about it all too much. Coming out of a successful group like the Subjugates, you want to do as well or better. You see so many artists who’ve come out of bands nose-dive and I think, 'I don’t want that to be me'.\\" The CD single contains a radio edit of the song, three remixes, and its accompanying music video. Composition \\"Just a Little Bit\\" is an R&B; song with a Motown-inspired opening. Buena's vocals in the song are soulful and upbeat. It differs from her previous single \\"Song 4 Mutya (Out of Control)\\" which prominently featured synthesizers and rave elements. \\"Just a Little Bit\\" is reminiscent of the Sugababes' earlier material and has a \\"delicate and tender approach\\", according to Alex Fletcher from Digital Spy. Fletcher described the song's composition, writing: \\"'Just a Little Bit' takes a laid-back jazz beat, some funked-up guitar twangs, and the sort of easy listening rhythm that TLC and En Vogue used to toss about willy-nilly 15 years ago. While it's splendid to hear Buena deliver her delicious dulcet tones without Groove Armada sticking their oars in, there is more than a faint whiff of '90s nostalgia about the tune. So much so that you half expect Easther and Vernie from Eternal to join in with the harmonies at one point.\\" Reception Critical response The song received generally positive reviews from music critics. Harry Guerin of RTÉ.ie wrote that \\"Just a Little Bit\\" was one of the tracks from Real Girl that shows Buena at her best, and elaborated that it \\"establishes her soul credentials\\". The New Zealand Herald critic Rebecca Barry Hill praised Buena's vocal performance on the song, which she characterised as \\"bluesy\\". Claire Allfree from Metro regarded \\"Just a Little Bit\\" as one of the album's better tracks and described it as an \\"itchy opener\\". Alex Fletcher from Digital Spy gave the song a three out of five star rating and wrote, \\"It lacks that killer pop hook to make it anything more than a decent album track\\". The Irish Times writer Kevin Courtney also rated the song three out of five stars and compared it to the success of her former bands' success: \\"It may not steal Subjugates' thunder, but it should grab a flash of the limelight\\". Mickey McMonagle from the Sunday Mail commended Buena's vocal delivery, but admitted that the song is \\"slightly lacklustre at times\\" despite being a decent track. The Independent's Andy Gill placed the song in his \\"Download this\\" category. Chart performance Upon release, the single failed to become a commercial success in the UK, where reached number 65 on the UK Singles Chart and charted for two weeks. Live performance Buena performed \\"Just a Little Bit\\" in April 2007 at London's music venue The Borderline.

It is the eighth track in the U.K. version of this album, and the seventh track in the U.S. version, from 1979. It is sung by Joe Strummer (and Mick Jones, with Paul Simonon in the chorus), who starts the song shouting \\"London's Burning!\\" two times. The song continues talking about London's automobile traffic, where young people try to get their kicks driving around in their cars until throughout the night, feeling bored and far from happy. This message is clearly seen in the next verse: > \\"I'm up and down the Westway, in an' out the lights > What a great traffic system – it's so bright > I can't think of a better way to spend the night > Than speeding around underneath the yellow lights\\" The song alludes to the boredom of TV and may also reflect the racial theme often treated by the band, notably in the first verse with the line: \\"Black or white turn it on, face the new religion\\". The song's name came from popular nursery rhyme about the Great Fire of London (1666). It was first recorded at CBS Studios London for the sessions for the debut album. Mick Jones' improvised guitar solo at the end of the song is not very typical for punk rock, which often has a minimalist attitude.

He succeeded his elder brother, Mallu Adil Shah, through the machinations of the Afaqi faction at the court. He was the first Adil Shahi ruler to assume the royal title of Shah. Faith Having a strong penchant for Sunni Islam—the religion of most Deccani Muslims—on his accession he deleted the names of the twelve Shi'ah Imams from the Khutbah, discontinued previous Shia practices and restored the exercise of the Sunni practices. He deviated from the traditions of his predecessors and introduced many innovations in the political and religious policies. He degraded most of the afaqi faction (with a few exceptions), and in their place enrolled the Deccani (including the Marathas and Habashis) to the services, retaining only four hundred afaqi troops as his bodyguard. Consequently, he brought Sunnis to power and ended Shia domination by dismissing them from their posts and many Marathas acquired great influence at his court and public accounts began to be maintained in Marathi. Policies Ibrahim's anti-afaqi policy, however, considerably weakened the kingdom as the dismissed personnel joined the service of the neighbouring rulers. This exposed the kingdom to a series of invasions. Yet it was the veteran afaqi leader Asad Khan Lari (Buried in Belgaum), who acting as a diplomatic counselor to Ibrahim, saved the kingdom in the hour of crisis. Reign The reign of Ibrahim, which lasted twenty- four years and a few months, was full of alliances and counter-alliances with and against Ahmadnagar, Bidar, Berar, Golkonda and Vijayanagar. Although there were continuous expeditions little territorial expansion was made, for gains in one direction were compensated by loss on the other side. Thus while Bidar was conquered, Solapur and Kalyani were lost to Ahmadnagar. On the other hand, considerable acquisitions were made in the south along the west-coast. The farthest point of Bijapur territory now extended south of Goa. Further, though Golkonda was not subdued, Bijapur arms were able to reach the walls of Golkonda fort and return triumphantly. Death Ibrahim was buried near the famous Sufi saint Hazrat Chandah Hussaini Ashrafi in Gogi, where his father, Ismail and grandfather Yusuf were also buried. On his mausoleum is an inscription of the names of Allah, Muhammad, the Rashidun Caliphs, and other Sahaba.

Reign During Ali's reign Bijapur and Vijayanagar came very close to each other and Ali actually paid a visit to Vijayanagar City, where Ramaraya received him with great pomp and honour. The greatest event of Ali's reign was the successful formation of the confederacy of the Deccan Sultans against Vijayanagar and their victory over the latter at the Battle of Rakkasagi – Tangadagi in Talikoti in 1565. As a result of this battle Bijapur’s southern boundary was extended right up to the city of Vijayanagar, and further it opened the gates for the future expansion of Bijapur further south. Consequently, at the end of Ali's reign, the Bijapur Kingdom extended up to port of Honavar on the west coast and southern boundary extended along the line of Varada and Tungabhadra rivers.

He is buried in the Gol Gumbaz. Rule Sultan Muhammad Adil Shah of Bijapur and African courtiers, ca, 1640 Bijapur partnered with the Mughals in the extinction of Ahmednagar. Mohammed maintained friendly relations with Shah Jahan and made a peace treaty of 1636, after the extinction of Ahmednagar. By a farman of Shah Jahan, he got assurances for the end of Mughal aggression against Bijapur and due to his good relations with the Mughals, Shah Jahan formally recognized Muhammad’s sovereignty and bestowed upon him the title of Shah in 1648, the only ruler of Bijapur to receive such recognition from the Mughals. The Treaty of 1636 with the Mughals sealed the expansion of Bijapur in the north. So, Mohammed Adil Shah extended his dominations westwards into Konkan, Pune, Dhabul (present Mumbai), southwards into Mysore, and eastwards into Karnataka, present south Andhra Pradesh and Tamil Nadu. During his reign, the kingdom attained its greatest extent, power and magnificence, and his dominions stretched from the Arabian Sea to the Bay of Bengal. Besides territorial expansions, Bijapur also attained peace and prosperity during Mohammed’s reign. His kingdom yielded an annual revenue of seven crore eighty four lakh rupees, besides the five and half crores of tributes that were from vassal rulers and zamindars. Cultural activities like poetry, painting and architecture also received a great impetus. Mohammed Adil Shah did his best to emulate the glorious traditions left to him by his versatile father. Diffusion of general education and religious teachings were one of his chief concerns, and he did his utmost to improve the socio-economic and educational standards of the people. Mohammed continued his father's patronage of the arts, though on a lesser scale. He introduced fresco paintings and portraits, the examples of which are the walls of Asar Mahal, pavilion at Kumatgi and Sat Manzil. Rise of Marathas Mohammad’s reign witnessed revolt of Shahaji and then, the rise of Shivaji to eminence and his founding of an independent Maratha State, which was initially carved out of the Bijapur Kingdom. Mohammed failed to check the rise of Marathas to independence. Death Gol Gumbaz, the tomb of Adil Shah.

His accession signaled disasters to the Kingdom and his reign marked the first phase of the decline of the mighty Bijapur Kingdom.  Reign  Shah Jahan, anxious to annex Bijapur to his empire, found a pretext in the legitimacy of Alis parents. On Aurangzeb’s plea, Shah Jahan sanctioned the invasion of Bijapur and gave him a free hand to deal with the situation. This sanction of such a war was wholly unrighteous. Bijapur was not a vassal state of the Mughals; but an independent and equal ally of the Mughal Emperor, and the latter had no lawful right to confirm or question the succession to the Bijapur Sultanate. However, Aurangzeb, had to raise the siege and rush to the north for the war of succession to the Mughal throne. With Muhammad’s death and Ali’s accession disorder had begun in the Karnataka. The Nayaks tried to recover their former lands. (Bangalore the capital of Karnataka was Bijapur’s administrative headquarters for controlling these feudatories by Kempegouda). On the other hand, Shivaji increased the momentum of acquiring more and more Bijapur territory and carved an independent Maratha state, while his diplomacy prevented any Mughal-Bijapur coalition against him. At the court things were even worse. With the coming of a young and weak ruler, the party factions and struggle for supremacy was at its zenith. To aggravate the, Aurangzeb intrigued with Bijapur nobles and succeeded in winning over most of them. Throughout his reign of 16 years, Ali struggled desperately both against the Mughals and the Marathas. He thrice repulsed Mughal invasions. But when he died in 1672 the great and glorious Bijapur of Muhammad’s time was deprived of most of its important territorial possessions. With the expansion of Shivaji’s kingdom there was a corresponding shrinkage in the Bijapur territory. Death Ali’s reign is marked by developments in Persian and Deccani literature and fine arts, and some good works of history were also produced under his patronage. He was buried in Ali Ka Rouza the world-famous Bara Kaman in Bijapur.

Therefore, his reign (1672–1686) is one of regents and ministers and was marked by chronic civil war among factious nobles, independence of provincial governors, paralysis of the central administration, Mughal invasions, secret alliances but pretend hostilities with the Maratha Empire and other neighbors, and the final absorption of Bijapur into the Mughal Empire in 1686. The prestige of Bijapur was so seriously damaged by internal disruptions that the Mughal General Diler Khan almost coerced and humiliated Sikandar. Despite several sacrifices and desperate attempts on the part of Sikandar, he could not satisfy the growing greed of the Mughals. Sikandar's alliance with Sambhaji (who was Hindu) further aggravated Mughal-Bijapur relations. At last, Emperor Aurangzeb himself marched out in 1685 with a large army to fulfill the ambition of his life. After desperately defending his capital and withstanding the prolonged siege of Bijapur in 1685–1686, Sikandar was unable to halt the Mughal assault led by Aurangzeb. On 12 September 1686, Bijapur was occupied, its garrison surrendered and Bijapur Fort was annexed by the Mughal Empire. Sikandar Adil Shah was captured bound in silver chains and brought before the Mughal Emperor Aurangzeb, to whom he bowed three times. Aurangzeb then sent him and his followers to Daulatabad fort, where he died during captivity. Sikandar Adil Shah was eventually buried at foot side of his spiritual teacher Naimullah Hashmi in the open yard in the New Market Place of Bijapur. The Adil Shahi dynasty thus came to an end.

Early life Edward Dobson was born in London, probably in 1816 or 1817. His parents were John Dobson, a merchant, and Elizabeth Barker (1787–1875). Collet Dobson Collet (1812–1898) was his brother, Clara Collet (1860–1948) was his niece, and Sophia Dobson Collet (1822–1894) his sister. Collet Barker was an uncle, an elder brother of his mother. By the time he started his apprenticeship as an architect and surveyor in 1832, his father had died. He made a sketching tour of the European Continent, his drawings from which were exhibited in the architecture section of the Royal Academy.\\"Edward Dobson, 1816–1908\\", Minutes of the Proceedings of the Institution of Civil Engineers, 174 (1908), pp. 377–378. Online While practicing as an architect and surveyor, he attended University College London to study engineering, and by 1843 he had graduated with certificates of honour in architecture and civil engineering. Edward Dobson married Mary Ann Lough (1821–1913) on 7 May 1839 at Shoreditch, London, and they were to have ten children. He became an associate of the Institution of Civil Engineers on 1 March 1842, and a full member on 29 March 1881. He also wrote a number of practical books on engineering subjects. From 1844 to 1850 he was on the staff of John Urpeth Rastrick, working as a railway engineer in Nottingham from 1846 to 1849. Emigration to New Zealand Sumner, one of which belonged to Dobson (pencil sketch, 1865) With two of his children, George (1840–1866) and Arthur Dudley (1841–1934), Dobson emigrated to Canterbury on the Cressy, one of the First Four Ships. The Cressy arrived in Lyttelton on 27 December 1850. Dobson was one of the original purchasers of land from the Canterbury Association. Life with two young sons was challenging, and they were sent to their uncle, Reverend Charles Dobson, the vicar of Buckland in Tasmania. After three years, they returned to New Zealand and initially stayed with another uncle, the surveyor Alfred Dobson. His wife followed on the Fatima and arrived in Lyttelton exactly one year later, on 27 December 1851. She had the other children with her: Mary Ann (1844–1913), Caroline (1845–1932), Edward Henry (1847–1934) and Maria Eliza (b. 1848). The remaining children were born in New Zealand: Robert (1852–1893), Emily Frances (1857–1943), Herbert Alex (1860–1948) and Collet Barker (1861–1926). Professional life ;New Zealand In New Zealand, he was responsible for designing and overseeing the construction of many important public works, having been appointed provincial engineer in 1854. He designed a system of railways for the province, and by the time he retired, the Canterbury Great Southern Railway had reached Lyttelton and advanced as far south as the Selwyn River. His son Arthur was apprenticed to him and an early task for the father and son team was to determine the depth of mud in Lyttelton Harbour. They then surveyed the Rangiora main drain, which resulted in reclaiming of swamp land. Edward Dobson supervised the construction of the Ferrymead Railway, connecting the wharf in Ferrymead with Christchurch and opening on 1 December 1863. This was New Zealand's first public railway. A telegraph line was built along the rail corridor between Lyttelton and Christchurch, and when it opened on 1 July 1862, it was the first telegraph line in New Zealand. New Zealand Post celebrated the centenary with the publication of two commemorative stamps. Edward Dobson's most important project was the superintendency of the Lyttelton Rail Tunnel, an engineering feat that is recognised with a Category I heritage protection by Heritage New Zealand. His son Arthur prepared many of the sectional drawings. Shortly afterwards, the Ferrymead branch line was closed, and it became the first public railway to be disused in the country. The chief surveyor, Thomas Cass, commissioned Arthur Dobson in 1864 to find out whether there is a suitable pass from the Waimakariri watershed to the West Coast. George and Arthur Dobson set out in March 1864, later to be joined by their brother Edward at Craigieburn. While George surveyed road lines there, Edward and Arthur proceeded to explore the high country. On the advice of West Coast Māori chief Tarapuhi, they found a pass that steeply descended to what became known as Otira; the route had long been used by Māori for trading pounamu. Arthur prepared a report, which included a sketch of the unnamed pass, and presented it to Cass. Edward Dobson, ca 1866 Soon after, the discovery of gold triggered the West Coast Gold Rush. Edward Dobson was commissioned to examine every possible pass to the West Coast from the watersheds of the Waimakariri, Taramakau and Hurunui Rivers. After finishing his examination, he declared that \\"Arthur's pass\\" was by far the most suitable to get to the gold fields. The provincial government decided that a road was to be built between Christchurch and Hokitika, a distance of , and Edward Dobson was put in charge of the project. The road was opened on 20 March 1866. The alpine pass became known as Arthur's Pass, with a nearby village and a later a national park also taking this name. ;Australia Dobson resigned as provincial engineer in 1868 and moved to Australia the following year. He undertook engineering work for a railway company in Melbourne, and water supply engineering work in Melbourne and Geelong. He returned to New Zealand in 1876. ;New Zealand again In 1878, Edward Dobson went into a formal partnership with his son Arthur, which lasted until 1885. They were working on water supply schemes for Timaru and the Canterbury Plains. They surveyed the Midland Line over the Southern Alps and, in partnership with others, launched the Midland Railway Company. The venture was a failure, as it was underfunded. Eventually, the government took over the scheme, but the line between Christchurch and Greymouth was not finished until 1923. In his later years, Edward Dobson concentrated on education. He had lectured since the 1860s, and his lectures to the Christchurch High School are regarded as \\"the first attempt to make Physical Science a branch of regular instruction in this colony\\". He published papers for the Philosophical Institute of Canterbury and the Institution of Civil Engineers in London, which awarded him the Telford Medal for the 1868–1869 session for a paper entitled The public works of the province of Canterbury, New Zealand. He helped establish the Engineering School of the Canterbury College, which became the University of Canterbury, and lectured until 1892. Dobson published several books on engineering. Family and death George Dobson (1840–1866; right) and Herbert Howitt, taken before 1863 Life improved when Edward Dobson was appointed Provincial Engineer. He built a cob cottage in Sumner, and another house in central Christchurch in the block described by Tuam, Manchester and High Streets. He could afford to send his sons to Christ's College, then the best school in Christchurch.

O. unilateralis infects ants of the tribe Camponotini, with the full pathogenesis being characterized by alteration of the behavioral patterns of the infected ant. Infected hosts leave their canopy nests and foraging trails for the forest floor, an area with a temperature and humidity suitable for fungal growth; they then use their mandibles to attach themselves to a major vein on the underside of a leaf, where the host remains after its eventual death. The process leading to mortality takes 4–10 days, and includes a reproductive stage where fruiting bodies grow from the ant's head, rupturing to release the fungus's spores. O. unilateralis is, in turn, also susceptible to fungal infection itself, an occurrence that can limit its impact on ant populations, which has otherwise been known to devastate ant colonies. Ophiocordyceps unilateralis and related species are known to engage in an active secondary metabolism, among other reasons, for the production of substances active as antibacterial agents that protect the fungus-host ecosystem against further pathogenesis during fungal reproduction. Because of this secondary metabolism, an interest in the species has been taken by natural products chemists, with corresponding discovery of small molecule agents (e.g. of the polyketide family) of potential interest for use as human immunomodulatory, anti-infective, and anticancer agents. Systematics After years of research, the taxonomy of Ophiocordyceps unilateralis is becoming increasingly clear.  Cordyceps vs Ophiocordyceps  Throughout history there has been confusion about the distinction between the genera Cordyceps and Ophiocordyceps. There have been many debates about whether the zombie-ant fungus (and other fungi) belonged to one or to the other as Ophiocordyceps was only recently brought forward. The genus Cordyceps comprises over 400 species, historically classified in the family Clavicipitaceae within the order Hypocreales. The classification was based on different morphological characteristics such as filiform ascospores and cylindrical asci. When Cordyceps were first classified, there was no concrete evidence for the genus Ophiocordyceps. However, in 2007, important new molecular data was tested, and enabled them to reorganize the family Clavicipitaceae. It was found that Clavicipitaceae was in fact three distinct monophyletic families: the Clavicipitaceae, the Cordycipitaceae and the Ophiocordycipitaceae. The new molecular phylogenetics studies contradicted the older classification and moved all Cordyceps species forming a sister group with Tolypocladium, into Ophiocordycipitaceae. Fungi able to parasitize ants were also included in the transfer, such as Cordyceps unilateralis which was later renamed Ophiocordyceps unilateralis. Following this study, multiple traits such as the production of darkly pigmented, hard to flexible stromata were defined as characteristics of the family Ophiocordycipitaceae.  Ophiocordyceps unilateralis sensu lato  The fungus’ scientific name is sometimes written as Ophiocordyceps unilateralis sensu lato, which means “in the broad sense”, because the species actually represents a complex of many species within O. unilateralis. Support for this term has become increasingly important. In 2011, it was hypothesized that the zombie-ant fungus could actually be described as a complex of species which are host-specific, meaning that one O. unilateralis species can only successfully infect and manipulate one host ant species. There is a possibility that this resulted in or re- inforced the reproductive isolation of the fungi, leading to its speciation. Following this, a study conducted in Brazil delimited using morphological comparison of the ascospores, germination process and asexual morphs, four different Ophiocordyceps species. Afterwards, three new species were described in the Brazilian Amazon, six in Thailand, and one in Japan. More recently in 2018, 15 new O. unilateralis species were described based on classic taxonomic criteria, and macro-morphological data with a deeper focus on ascospore and asexual morphology. The asexual morphologies made it possible to distinguish two different clades mainly composed of species associated with ants which they termed “O. unilateralis core clade” and “O. kniphofioides subclade”. Further analyses were conducted using a set of different traits. Morphological traits were used and included both macro-morphological characters (e.g. typical single stroma arising from the host’s dorsal pronotum, the ascoma (perithecia) growing from the storm) and microscopic traits (e.g. the morphology of the ascospores in terms of size, shape, septation and germination). Moreover, other traits such as the host and the location of the death grip were added to the analyses. The morphological study led to 15 new identified species, with 14 which were distributed in the core clade, and one in the subclade. Moreover, it was found that species in the O. kniphofioides subclade specialise on neotropical ants, whereas species in the core clade specialise on Camponotini species. Species within the O. unilateralis core clade as described in 2018: * O. albacongiuae * O. blakebarnesii * O. camponoti-atricipis * O. camponoti-balzani * O. camponoti-bispinosi * O. camponoti-chartificis * O. camponoti-femorati * O. camponoti-floridani * O. camponoti-hippocrepidis * O. camponoti-indiani * O. camponoti-leonardi * O. camponoti- melanotic * O. camponoti-nidulantis * O. camponoti-novogranadensis * O. camponoti-renggeri * O. camponoti-saundersi * O. halabalaensis * O. kimflemingiae * O. naomipierceae * O. ootakii * O. polyrhachis-furcata * O. pulvinata * O. rami * O. satoi Species within the O. kniphofioides subclade as described in 2018: * O. daceti * O. kniphofioides  Morphology  Schematic representation of Ophiocordyceps unilateralis growing out of an infected host ant  Typical morphology  The zombie-ant fungus is easily identifiable when its reproductive structure becomes apparent on its dead host, usually a carpenter ant. At the end of its life cycle, O. unilateralis typically generates a single, wiry yet pliant, darkly pigmented stroma which arises from the dorsal pronotum region of the ant once it is dead. Moreover, perithecia, the spore-bearing sexual structure, can be observed on the stalk, just below its tip. This complex forms the fungus’ fruiting body. Most species within the O. unilateralis s.l. species complex have both a sexual (teleomorph) and an asexual morph (anamorph). These are different in terms of their function and characteristics. Generally, the asexual morphs identified for Ophiocordyceps are Hirsutella and Hymenostilbe, two genera of asexually reproducing fungi.  Morphological variation  O. unilateralis species exhibit morphological variations which are most certainly due to their wide geographic range, from Japan to the Americas. Moreover, it has been hypothesized that their morphological variations may also be a result of one fungus species maximizing its infection on one specific host ant species (host-specific infections). Different subspecies of ant can occur within the same area, which means that in order to coexist they have to occupy different ecological niches. Consequently, the fungi may have evolved at the subspecies level in order to maximize its fitness. O. unilateralis core clade morphological characteristics The O. unilateralis core clade, as described in 2018, has distinct morphological characteristics. It exhibits a single stroma with a Hirsutella asexual morph, which arises from the dorsal neck region of the dead ant and produces a dark brown perithecia attached to its stalk. These species are also recognizable through the host species they infect, which are only Camponotini species. Once the host is killed by the fungus, it is commonly found fixed through their mandibles onto the surfaces of leaves. O. kniphofioides subclade morphological characteristics The O. kniphofioides subclade, as described in 2018, also has distinct morphological characteristics. Its species produce a stroma that grows laterally from the host’s thorax which itself generates an orange ascoma. Moreover, species within this subclade share a Hirsutella asexual morph. As for the core clade, these species are also recognizable through the hosts they infect, which are usually neotropical ant species. The subclade does not present the same extended phenotype with the famous “death grip” that O. unilateralis species typically exhibit. Their hosts usually die at the base of large trees in the Amazonian rainforest, among the moss carpets.  Life cycle  In tropical forests, the ant species Camponotus leonardi lives in the high canopy and has an extensive network of aerial trails. Sometimes the canopy gaps are too difficult to cross, so the ants' trails descend to the forest floor where they are exposed to O. unilateralis spores. The spores attach to their exoskeletons and eventually break through using mechanical pressure and enzymes. Like other fungi pathogenic to insects in the genus Ophiocordyceps, the fungus targets a specific host species, Camponotus leonardi; despite this, the fungus may parasitize other closely related species of ants with lesser degrees of host manipulation and reproductive success. Yeast stages of the fungus spread in the ant's body and presumably produce compounds that affect the ant's hemocoel, using the evolutionary trait of an extended phenotype to manipulate the behavioral patterns exhibited by the ant. An infected ant exhibits irregularly timed full-body convulsions that dislodge it from its canopy nest to the forest floor. The changes in the behavior of the infected ants are very specific, giving rise to the popular term \\"zombie ants\\". Behaviors are tuned for the benefit of the fungus in terms of its growth and its transmission, thereby increasing its fitness. The ant climbs up the stem of a plant and uses its mandibles with abnormal force to secure itself to a leaf vein, leaving dumbbell-shaped marks on it. The ants generally clamp to a leaf's vein at a height of 26cm above the forest floor, on the northern side of the plant, in an environment with 94–95% humidity and temperatures between . Infections may lead to 20 to 30 dead ants per square meter. \\"Each time, they are on leaves that are a particular height off the ground and they have bitten into the main vein [of a leaf] before dying.\\" When the dead ants are moved to other places and positions, further vegetative growth and sporulation either fails to occur or results in undersized and abnormal reproductive structures. In temperate forests, the stereotypical behaviour of zombie ants is to attach themselves to the lower side of twigs, not leaves. A search of plant-fossil databases revealed similar marks on a fossil leaf from the Messel Pit, which is 48 million years old. Once the mandibles of the ant are secured to the leaf vein, atrophy quickly sets in, destroying the sarcomere connections in the muscle fibers and reducing the mitochondria and sarcoplasmic reticular. The ant is no longer able to control the muscles of the mandible and remains fixed in place, hanging upside-down on the leaf. This lockjaw trait is popularly known as the death grip and is essential in the fungus's lifecycle. A study led in Thailand revealed that there is a synchronization of this manipulated biting behavior at solar noon. The fungus then kills the ant and continues to grow as its hyphae invade more soft tissues and structurally fortify the ant's exoskeleton. More mycelia then sprout out of the ant, securely anchoring it to the plant substrate while secreting antimicrobials to ward off competition. When the fungus is ready to reproduce, its fruiting bodies grow from the ant's head and rupture, releasing the spores. This process takes 4–10 days. Dead ants are found in areas termed “graveyards” which contain high densities of dead ants previously infected by the same fungus.  Natural products  Schematic representation of the ant behavioural manipulation caused by natural products secreted by O. unilateralis O. unilateralis’ life cycle includes and depends on the infection and the manipulation of a carpenter ant, principally C. leonardi. The behavioral manipulation of the ant, which gives rise to the name “zombie-ant”, is an extended phenotype of the fungus. It first affects the ant’s behavior through convulsions that make it fall from its high canopy nest onto the forest floor. This is followed by the fungus controlling the climbing of the ant and the locking of its jaw (and subsequent death) onto a leaf around 25 centimetres above the ground, which is thought to be the optimal height for fungal spore growth and dispersion. Throughout the lifecycle, unique challenges must be met by equally unique metabolic activities. The fungal pathogen must attach securely to the arthropod exoskeleton and penetrate it—avoiding or suppressing host defenses—then, control the behavior of the host before killing it; and finally, it must protect the carcass from microbial and scavenger attack. The behavioral manipulation of the ant would not be possible without the presence of huge fungal cell populations beside the host’s brain and within muscles because these lead to the secretion of various metabolites known to have important behavioral consequences. During the infection the parasite comes across an array of environments such as different host tissues or the immune response. Studies have shown that O. unilateralis reacts heterogeneously by secreting different metabolites according to the host tissue it encounters and whether they are live or dead. The identification of these natural products is important in order to understand which aspects of the ants are under control and consequently how O. unilateralis manipulates the ant. * Attachment O. unilateralis spores onto the ant’s exoskeleton The first step O. unilateralis has to overcome to have a successful infection, is to attach itself onto the ant’s cuticle and then infiltrate it. For this purpose, the fungus’ hypha pierces the exoskeleton using enzymes such as chitinase, lipase and protease, combined with mechanical pressure. * Convulsions and climbing behaviour After the fungus enters the ant it propagates, and fungal cells are found beside the host’s brain. Once the population is of sufficient size, the fungus secretes compounds and takes over the central nervous system (CNS), which enables it to manipulate the ant to reach the forest floor and climb up the vegetation. Two candidate compounds, sphingosine and guanidinobutyric acid (GBA), were identified as responsible for the manipulation of the host brain. Both of these metabolites are known in the scientific world to be involved in neurological disorders. However, more research is needed in the field to determine whether other fungal metabolites interact with the host brain and cause higher levels of sphingosine and GBA in the brain. Some studies identified another compound, hypoxanthine, present at high extracellular concentration. Hypoxanthine has deleterious effects on neural tissues of the cerebral cortex, which in the context of zombie ants may indicate a way for the fungus to alter the motor neurons of the ant, consequently affecting its behavior. * Death grip The famous “death grip” exhibited by the ant is also a result of the fungus-induced manipulation. The behavior consists in the ant biting the leaf so tightly that the ant is prevented from falling as it dies hanging upside down, consequently enabling the proper growth of the fungus’ fruiting body. This is possibly a result of the atrophication of the ant’s mandibular muscles caused by the secretion of fungal compounds. In multiple studies, fungal cell populations were found within atrophied mandibular muscle tissues. In fact, they infiltrate between the muscle fibers and it is a common hypothesis of researchers that they cause the muscles’ atrophication the secretion of chemicals. Significant decreases in leucine concentration and mitochondria number were identified in infected ants. A deficit in leucine results in the prevention of muscle regeneration because the amino acid is a nutrient regulator of muscle protein synthesis. A decrease in mitochondria ultimately results in a reduction of energy and calcium levels due to the lack of ATP and sarcoplasmic reticulum which provides calcium for actin-myosin binding which is essential for muscle cells. More in depth research is needed for the identification of other fungal compounds which act to atrophy the mandibular muscles, and for the understanding of their exact effects on the ant. Natural products are host specific Effects of O. unilateralis on host have been found to vary according to host species. The ant species which are normally found infected in nature exhibit a manipulated behavior, whereas the species which are not typically infected are killed by the infection, but their behaviour is not altered. This is likely due to the heterogeneous nature of the fungus which secretes different metabolites according to host species.  Geographic distribution  Many studies describe Ophiocordyceps unilateralis distribution as pantropical since it occurs mainly in tropical forest ecosystems. However, there are some reports of the zombie-ant fungus in warm-temperate ecosystems. Its distribution includes tropical rainforests located in Brazil, Australia and Thailand, and temperate forests found in South Carolina, Florida and Japan.  Host impact  O. unilateralis has been known to destroy entire ant colonies. When O. unilateralis-infected ants die, they are mainly located in regions containing a high density of ants which were previously manipulated and killed. These areas are termed “graveyards” and can be of 20 to 30 meters in range (with a local density of dead ants possibly exceeding 25 meters square). The density of dead ants within these graveyards can vary according to climatic conditions. This means that environmental conditions such as humidity and temperature can influence O.unilateralis’ effects on the host population. In fact, studies have described seasonal patterns in the density of previously-infected dead ants, with an increase during the rainy season and a decrease during the dry season. It is thought that large precipitation events at the beginning and the end of the rainy season stimulates fungal development, which leads to more spores being released and ultimately more individuals being infected and killed.  Medicinal potential  Ophiocordyceps are known in the pharmaceutical world to be a medically-important group. O. unilateralis fungi produce various known secondary metabolites, as well as several structurally uncharacterised substances. These natural products are reportedly being investigated as potential leads in discovery efforts toward immunomodulatory, antitumor, hypoglycemic, and hypocholesterolemic targets. In an Ophiocordyceps species within Japanese cicadas, the Ophiocordyceps replaces the symbiotic bacteria within the cicadas to help the host process sap as nutrients, unlike other related species, such as the Ophiocordyceps sinensis, which is a traditional immune booster and cancer treatment in Tibetan and Chinese culture.  Naphthoquinone derivatives  Naphthoquinone derivatives are an example of secondary metabolite with important pharmaceutical potentials produced by O. unilateralis. Six known naphthoquinone derivatives have been isolated from O. unilateralis, namely erythrostominone, deoxyerythrostominone, 4-O-methyl erythrostominone, epierythrostominol, deoxyerythrostominol, and 3,5,8-trihydroxy-6-methoxy-2-(5-oxohexa-1,3-dienyl)-1,4-naphthoquinone, which have shown activity in in vitro assays related to antimalarial drug discovery. In addition to having antimalarial activities, all six of these secondary metabolites have been demonstrated to have anticancer and antibacterial activities. Moreover, the use of red naphthoquinone pigments produced by O. unilateralis has been studied as a dye for food, cosmetic, and pharmaceutical manufacturing processes. In fact, naphthoquinone derivatives produced by the fungus show a red color under acidic conditions, and a purple color under basic conditions. These pigments are stable against acid/alkaline conditions and light and are not cytotoxic, which makes them applicable for food coloring and as a dye for other materials. These attributes also make it a prime candidate for antituberculosis testing in secondary TB patients, by improving symptoms and enhancing immunity when combined with chemotherapeutic drugs.  Polyketides  In 2009, a study showed that O. unilateralis also produces polyketides. These secondary metabolites have been used in antibiotics such as patulin, cholesterol medication such as compactin, and antifungal treatments. It has also been reported that polyketides have other therapeutic effects such as antitumor, antioxidant and antiaging activities.  Fungal hyperparasite  O. unilateralis suffers from an unidentified fungal hyperparasite, reported in the lay press as the \\"antizombie-fungus fungus\\", that results in only 6–7% of sporangia being viable, limiting the damage O. unilateralis inflicts on ant colonies. The hyperparasite moves in to attack O. unilateralis as the fungal stalk emerges from the ant's body, which can stop the stalk from releasing its spores. The graveyards of dead ants are numerous and spread throughout the surrounding area of the colony. Though O. unilateralis is very virulent, only about 6.5% of all fruiting bodies are viable spore producers. This is caused by the weakening of the fungus by the hyperparasite, which may limit the viability of infectious spores. Ants also groom each other to combat microscopic organisms that could potentially harm the colony. Additional fungi grant beneficial assistance to the colony, as well.  Parasite adaptation  In host-parasite dynamics, both the host and the parasite are under selective pressure: the parasite evolves to increase its transmission, whereas the host evolves to avoid and/or resist the infection by the parasite.  Extended phenotype  Some parasites have evolved to manipulate their host’s behavior in order to increase their transmission to uninfected susceptible individuals, thereby increasing their fitness. This host manipulation is termed the \\"extended phenotype\\" of the parasite and is a form of adaptation. Host ant manipulation by O. unilateralis represents one of the best-known examples of extended phenotypes. The extended phenotype of O. unilateralis typically depicts the infected ant leaving its canopy nest and its normal foraging path to reach the forest floor and subsequently climb up 25 cm above ground level. This height is considered to be optimal for fungal growth due to its humidity level and temperature. This is followed by a “death grip” of the infected ant once at what is considered to be the optimal conditions for post-mortem fungal development. This leads to the fungus continuing its growth and releasing fungal spores onto the forest floor. These spores will then be encountered by the ants which, when the aerial foraging route is not possible, have to occasionally descend to ground level. Therefore, O. unilateralis controls the ant's behaviour and this manipulation represents an adaptation for the fungus where natural selection acts on its genes with the purpose of increasing the fungus' fitness.  Somatic investment  Some studies proposed a theory in which O. unilateralis has another possible form of adaptation which ensures its repeated reproduction. This would be crucial for O. unilateralis s.l. species as they can produce and release within the air, clear and thin-walled spores which are susceptible to environmental conditions such as UV radiation and dryness. In fact, studies suggest that the short viability of the fungal spores lead to the need of somatic investment (growth/survival) by the parasite in order to sustain the growth of the fungus’ fruiting body on its host, thereby enabling successive reproduction. To do so, O. unilateralis fortifies the ant cadaver to prevent its decay, which consequently ensures the growth of the fruiting body. Therefore, the zombie-ant fungus adapts to the short viability of its spores by increasing their production using the dead ant.  Host adaptation  The principal hosts of O. unilateralis evolved adaptive behaviours able to limit the contact rate between uninfected susceptible hosts and infected hosts, thereby reducing the risk of transmission. O.unilateralis’ principal hosts evolved efficient behavioral forms of social immunity. In fact, the ants clean the exoskeletons of one another in order to decrease the presence of spores which are attached to their cuticle. Also, ants can sense that a member of the colony is infected; resulting in healthy ants carrying the O. unilateralis- infected individual far away from the colony to avoid fungal spore exposure. Plus, there are reports testifying that most worker ants remain inside the nest boundaries, consequently, only foragers are at risk of infection. Moreover, one of the fungus' principal hosts, Camponotus leonardi, provided evidence for the avoidance of the forest floor by the host ants as a defence method. In areas where O. unilateralis is present, C. leonardi builds its nests high in the canopy, and has a broad network of areal trails. These trails occasionally move down to the ground level, where infection and graveyards occur, due to canopy gaps too difficult for the ants to cross. When the trails descend to the forest floor, their length is only of three to five meters before going back up into the canopy. This demonstrates the avoidance of the zones of infection by the ants. Additionally, more evidence participates in the favour of this defence method being adaptive as it is not observed in undisturbed forests where the zombie-ant fungus is not present.

Important goals of this work were an understanding of the physical properties of gases and how they relate to chemical reactions and, ultimately, the composition of matter. In the eighteenth century, as the field of chemistry was evolving from alchemy, a field of the natural philosophy was created around the idea of air as a reagent. Before this, air was primarily considered a static substance that would not react and simply existed. However, as Lavoisier and several other pneumatic chemists would insist, the air was indeed dynamic, and would not only be influenced by combusted material, but would also influence the properties of different substances. The initial concern of pneumatic chemistry was combustion reactions, beginning with Stephen Hales. These reactions would give off different \\"airs\\" as chemists would call them, and these different airs contained more simple substances. Until Lavoisier, these airs were considered separate entities with different properties; Lavoisier was responsible largely for changing the idea of air as being constituted by these different airs that his contemporaries and earlier chemists had discovered. This study of gases was brought about by Hales with the invention of the pneumatic trough, an instrument capable of collecting the gas given off by reactions with reproducible results. The term gas was coined by J. B. van Helmont, in the early seventeenth century. This term was derived from the Greek word chaos as a result of his inability to collect properly the substances given off by reactions, as he was the first natural philosopher to make an attempt at carefully studying the third type of matter. However, it was not until Lavoisier performed his research in the eighteenth century that the word was used universally by scientists as a replacement for airs. Van Helmont (1579 - 1644) is sometimes considered the founder of pneumatic chemistry, as he was the first natural philosopher to take an interest in air as a reagent. Alessandro Volta began investigating pneumatic chemistry in 1776 and argued that there were different types of inflammable air based on experiments on marsh gases. Pneumatic chemists credited with discovering chemical elements include Joseph Priestley, Henry Cavendish, Joseph Black, Daniel Rutherford, and Carl Scheele. Other individuals who investigated gases during this period include Robert Boyle, Stephen Hales, William Brownrigg, Antoine Lavoisier, Joseph Louis Gay-Lussac, and John Dalton. (originally published in 1964)  History   Eighteenth century  The pneumatic trough was integral thereon in work with gases (or, as contemporary chemists called them, airs). Work done by Joseph Black, Joseph Priestley, Herman Boerhaave, and Henry Cavendish revolved largely around the use of the instrument, allowing them to collect airs given off by different chemical reactions and combustion analyses. Their work led to the discovery of many types of airs, such as dephlogisticated air (discovered by Joseph Priestley). Moreover, the chemistry of airs was not limited to combustion analyses. During the eighteenth century, many chymists used the discovery of airs as a new path for exploring old problems, with one example being the field of medicinal chemistry. One particular Englishman, James Watt, began to take the idea of airs and use them in what was referred to as pneumatic therapy, or the use of airs to make laboratories more workable with fresh airs and also aid patients with different illnesses, with varying degrees of success. Most human experimentation done was performed on the chymists themselves, as they believed that self-experimentation was a necessary part or progressing the field.  Contributors   James Watt  James Watt's research in pneumatic chemistry involved the use of inflammable (H2) and dephlogisticated (O2) airs to create water. In 1783, James Watt showed that water was composed of inflammable and dephlogisticated airs, and that the masses of gases before combustion were exactly equal to the mass of water after combustion. Until this point, water was viewed as a fundamental element rather than a compound. James Watt also sought to explore the use of different airs in medical treatments as \\"pneumatic therapy\\" by collaborating with Dr. Thomas Beddoes to treat his daughter Jessie Watt using fixed air.  Joseph Black  Joseph Black was a chemist who took interest in the pneumatic field after studying under William Cullen. He was first interested in the topic of magnesia alba, or magnesium carbonate, and limestone, or calcium carbonate, and wrote a dissertation called \\"De Humore acido a cibis orto, et magnesia alba\\" on the properties of both. His experiments on magnesium carbonate led him to discover that fixed air, or carbon dioxide, was being given off during reactions with various chemicals, including breathing. Despite him never using the pneumatic trough or other instrumentation invented to collect and analyze the airs, his inferences led to more research into fixed air instead of common air, with the trough actually being used. After moving on to Glasgow to teach, Black turned his interests to the topic of heat. Through his experiments with ice and water, he made several discoveries about the latent heat of fusion and the latent heat of freezing water, as well as working extensively with specific heats of a number of liquids.  Joseph Priestley  Joseph Priestley, in Observations on different kinds of air, was one of the first people to describe air as being composed of different states of matter, and not as one element. Priestley elaborated on the notions of fixed air (CO2), mephitic air and inflammable air to include \\"inflammable nitrous air,\\" \\"vitriolic acid air,\\" \\"alkaline air\\" and \\"dephlogisticated air\\". Priestley also described the process of respiration in terms of phlogiston theory. Priestley also established a process for treating scurvy and other ailments using fixed air in his Directions for impregnating water with fixed air. Priestley's work on pneumatic chemistry had an influence on his natural world views. His belief in an \\"aerial economy\\" stemmed from his belief in \\"dephlogisticated air\\" being the purest type of air and that phlogiston and combustion were at the heart of nature. Joseph Priestley chiefly researched with the pneumatic trough, but he was responsible for collecting several new water-soluble airs. This was achieved primarily by his substitution of mercury for water, and implementing a shelf under the head for increased stability, capitalizing on the idea Cavendish proposed and popularizing the mercury pneumatic trough.  Herman Boerhaave  While not credited for direct research into the field of pneumatic chemistry, Boerhaave (teacher, researcher, and scholar) did publish the Elementa Chimiae in 1727. This treatise included support for Hales' work and also elaborated upon the idea of airs. Despite not publishing his own research, this section on airs in the Elementa Chimie was cited by many other contemporaries and contained much of the current knowledge of the properties of airs. Boerhaave is also credited with adding to the world of chemical thermometry through his work with Daniel Fahrenheit, also discussed in Elementa Chimiae.  Henry Cavendish  Henry Cavendish, despite not being the first to replace water in the trough with mercury, was among the first to observe that fixed air was insoluble over mercury and therefore could be collected more efficiently using the adapted instrument. He also characterized fixed air (CO2) and inflammable air (H2). Inflammable air was one of the first gases isolated and discovered using the pneumatic trough. However, he did not exploit his own idea to its limit, and therefore did not use the mercury pneumatic trough to its full extent. Cavendish is credited with nearly correctly analyzing the content of gases in the atmosphere. Cavendish also showed that inflammable air and atmospheric air could be combined and heated to produce water in 1784.  Stephen Hales  In the eighteenth century, with the rise of combustion analysis in chemistry, Stephen Hales invented the pneumatic trough in order to collect gases from the samples of matter he used; while uninterested in the properties of the gases he collected, he wanted to explore how much gas was given off from the materials he burned or let ferment. Hales was successful in preventing the air from losing its \\"elasticity,\\" i.e. preventing it from experiencing a loss in volume, by bubbling the gas through water, and therefore dissolving the soluble gases. After the invention of the pneumatic trough, Stephen Hales continued his research into the different airs, and performed many Newtonian analyses of the various properties of them. He published his book Vegetable Staticks in 1727, which had a profound impact on the field of pneumatic chemistry, as many researchers cited this in their academic papers. In Vegetable Staticks, Hales not only introduced his trough, but also published the results he obtained from the collected air, such as the elasticity and composition of airs along with their ability to mix with others.  Instrumentation   Pneumatic trough  Stephen Hales, called the creator of pneumatic chemistry, created the pneumatic trough in 1727. This instrument was widely used by many chemists to explore the properties of different airs, such as what was called inflammable air (what is modernly called hydrogen). Lavoisier used this in addition to his gasometer to collect gases and analyze them, aiding him in creating his list of simple substances. The pneumatic trough, invented by Hales in the 1700s. This was the initial model, used for collection of airs by combustion. The pneumatic trough, while integral throughout the eighteenth century, was modified several times to collect gases more efficiently or just to collect more gas. For example, Cavendish noted that the amount of fixed air that was given off by a reaction was not entirely present above the water; this meant that fixed water was absorbing some of this air, and could not be used quantitatively to collect that particular air. So, he replaced the water in the trough with mercury instead, in which most airs were not soluble. By doing so, he could not only collect all airs given off by a reaction, but he could also determine the solubility of airs in water, beginning a new area of research for pneumatic chemists. While this was the major adaptation of the trough in the eighteenth century, several minor changes were made before and after this substitution of mercury for water, such as adding a shelf to rest the head on while gas collection occurred. This shelf would also allow for less conventional heads to be used, such as Brownrigg's animal bladder.  Gasometer  During his chemical revolution, Lavoisier created a new instrument for precisely measuring out gases. He called this instrument the gazomèter He had two different versions; the one he used in demonstrations to the Academie and to the public, which was a large expensive version meant to make people believe that it had a large precision, and the smaller, more lab practical version with a similar precision. This more practical version was cheaper to construct, allowing more chemists to use Lavoisier's instrument.

The exact identity of the subject is not completely certain, but current scholarly consensus identifies him with Gaius Calpurnius Piso, the leader of a conspiracy against Nero in AD 65\\\\. The Latinity is straightforward; the subject is praised for his oratorical ability as an advocate in law cases, for the kindness with which he maintains his house open to poor men of talent, but also for his skill at playing ball and especially the board game of latrunculi, for which the poem is one of our main sources. About the author of the work there is considerably more doubt; it has been attributed to Ovid, Saleius Bassus and Statius before an analysis of the text made it clear that the first lived too early and the others too late to write it; Lucan and Calpurnius Siculus are the leading contenders today. Whoever he was, the author says in the concluding verses of his poem that he was not yet twenty years old. The work, comprising 261 dactylic hexameters, has come down via a single manuscript once preserved in the monastery of Lorsch, and now lost; although sizable portions were also preserved in several medieval florilegia, the manuscripts of which are still extant.

He was the independent Governor of Western Highlands Province in the National Parliament of Papua New Guinea from 2007 to 2012.Muri, David. \\"Wingti unseated\\". Papua New Guinea Post-Courier, 7 August 2007. Olga, who comes from the Mul-Baiyer area, was a student leader at the University of Papua New Guinea during protests against government privatisation and land mobilisation policies in 2001 in which four students were killed in a police crackdown. He cited this as his reason for running for parliament when, in 2007, he challenged former Prime Minister Paias Wingti in his seat of Western Highlands Provincial.Tiptip, Nikints. \\"Newcomer confident of win\\".

Papua New Guinea Post- Courier, 5 July 2007.\\"Challenge for Wingti\\". Papua New Guinea Post-Courier, 20 June 2007. Olga campaigned on a platform of fighting government corruption and mismanagement and stemming the exploitation of the country's resources. He also made an issue of the need for a new generation of leaders, contrasting his age of 32 with Wingti's advancing years. The final result was extremely close, with Wingti leading for most of the count, but ultimately losing to Olga on preferences in the final stage of counting. It was the last electorate to be declared, with Olga being eventually announced as the winner on 6 August. The result was widely considered an upset, with the potential to end Wingti's thirty-year career in national politics.Jones, Lloyd. \\"Former PNG PM Paias Wingti loses seat in elections\\".

When he became governor in 1958, Del Sesto was the first Republican chief executive to be chosen by Rhode Island voters in 20 years. Biography Born in Providence, Rhode Island, Del Sesto graduated from Boston University and Georgetown University Law School, and later he did advanced studies in taxation at New York University and the University of Miami, becoming a certified public accountant and practicing attorney in Providence specializing in taxation and finance. He also worked as an academic teacher at both Boston University and Northeastern University in the late 1930s. Del Sesto first held public office under the Democratic administration of Governor Theodore F. Green serving as a chief clerk in the office of the general treasurer from 1933 to 1935. In January, 1935, he was named assistant to Thomas P. McCoy of Pawtucket, state budget officer. But four months later, Governor Green ousted McCoy and Del Sesto became the budget officer. Later he went to become a special assistant to the U.S. Attorney handling cases associated with milk industry monopolies from 1938 to 1940, director of the Rhode Island Finance Department from 1940 to 1942, and a Director of the state Office of Price Administration from 1942 to 1945. Del Sesto was nominated by the Republicans as their candidate for Governor for the first time in 1956. This was a highly disputed race. His Democratic opponent was incumbent Governor Dennis Roberts. campaign button Although Del Sesto won a plurality, he didn't become Governor that year. The Board of Elections completed its count on December 18, 1956; Del Sesto was the apparent winner by 427 votes. But in what was known as the \\"long count,\\" the Rhode Island Supreme Court invalidated 5,000 civilian, absentee and shut-in ballots cast prior to election day on the grounds that a constitutional amendment required such votes to be cast on, rather than prior to, election day. The decision, released on New Year's Day, 1957, resulted in Roberts remaining in office by a plurality of 711 votes. The incumbent Governor's brother was on the Court and recused himself from the decision, but \\"two of the four judges hearing the case, Chief Justice Edmund W. Flynn and Justice Francis B. Condon, both Democrats, were elected to the Supreme Court\\" under dubious circumstances \\"during Rhode Island's infamous 'Bloodless Revolution of 1935'.\\" Del Sesto ran again in 1958 and this time he defeated Roberts by 6,237 votes. He served as Governor for one two-year term, from January 6, 1959, to January 3, 1961. He ran for re-election in 1960, but was defeated by his Lieutenant Governor, Democrat John A. Notte, Jr. That year, Del Sesto had been a delegate to the Republican National Convention and made one of the speeches seconding the presidential nomination of Vice President Richard M. Nixon. During his first year in office, Del Sesto set a record by vetoing ninety-eight pieces of legislation passed by a Democratic-controlled state legislature. Also during his administration, an accelerated program of highway construction was implemented, state aid for education to cities and towns was liberalized, and a state scholarship program was established. After his defeat, Del Sesto was named in 1966 to the Rhode Island Superior Court by Governor John Chafee. He held this position until his death. He was married to Lola Elda Faraone and had three children. He was a Catholic.

A quote from that book, tells us; \\"It was at this moment that Mary Anne Lewis entered the scene. D'israeli had met Mary Anne five years previously, when he described her as a 'rattle and flirt'. At the Bulwers', Disraeli had been asked to take her down to dinner, he responded: \\"Oh anything rather than that insufferable woman, but Allah is Great.\\" Five years on she seemed less insufferable to D'Israeli when he stood for Maidstone alongside her husband, Wyndham Lewis. Mrs Lewis already had a friendly eye for D'Israeli and during the contest the couple loaned him money for his election expenses. Both men were elected, but Wyndham died suddenly several months later. From that moment on, the connection between Mary Anne and D'Israeli grew in intensity...Douglas Hurd penned a book titled \\"D'Israeli, or the two lives (of D'Israeli).

Its premises are located in Kraśnik, Poland, 50 km south-west of Lublin, near the eastern border of the European Union (EU). The main products of FŁT-Kraśnik are bearings and their components (products and semi-finished products after forging and pressing). FŁT-Kraśnik also manufactures grinding spindles, bearing repair kits, equipment, various tools and machines, and machine tool components along with their design documentation. History FŁT-Kraśnik S.A. was founded in 1938 as Munition Factory number 2, as part of the Central Industrial District. The construction site was situated between the cities of Kraśnik and Urzędów, in a forest covering an area of more than 676 ha. Along with the construction of the factory, workers were recruited and a housing area for six thousand people was established. The housing settlement was named Dąbrowa-Bór. At the start of World War II, 39 housing blocks and six buildings for community use (among others: school, hospital, cinema) had already been completed. Initially, the factory's production profile covered artillery munition (caliber 37 – 155 mm); the production of detonators was added before the start of the war. During the war, technical crew and qualified workshop workers were relocated from factories in Radom, Skarżysko, and Warsaw, while laborers were sourced from local youth who were taken on as apprentices. The first general manager of Munitions Factory number 2 was Professional Engineer Gutkowski and its technical director was Professional Engineer Gokieli. Destructive effects of war After the war began, construction work on both the factory and the living area was terminated. On 2 September 1939, the Luftwaffe damaged the railway, along with some production workshops. The occupation of Dąbrowa-Bór began on 15 September, and the factory was taken over by German military forces. The Polish crew managed to evacuate four batches of machines and devices, moving them to Krzemieniec, before the Germans arrived. Assets from Germany never came back. During the occupation, the most valuable equipment was taken to Germany. Everything that remained was gathered in one workshop and used as equipment for the maintenance of military vehicles. The factory was also used to produce machine parts for Heinkel aircraft. Several of the workshops served as storage areas for emergency stocks of agricultural products and food and part of the factory and housing area was used as a concentration camp. The liberation of Dąbrowa-Bór took place on 27 July 1944. First bearings from Poland 15 September 1948 marked the birthday of the Polish bearing industry with construction of a new facility at the site of Munitions Factory number 2. As a result of the great process of industrialization of the country, and by the decision of the central authorities, the metal products factory at Kraśnik was reopened and formed part of the Central Industrial District. It became the first bearing production facility in the history of Poland. At the same time, the city was being rebuilt to provide additional living space for employees and their families. Five years later, the city was renamed Kraśnik Fabryczny. On 1 May 1949, the first batch (1000 pcs.) of 6204 bearings was manufactured. Since that time, the production of roller bearings has grown constantly. The demand for bearings on the domestic market and the possibility of export sales favoured the growth of the bearing industry in Poland. Significant events 1977-1981 - The aim of FŁT-Kraśnik was to build a central balls department. A 16-member crew visited the Japanese company AKS in Osaka for training and research. The knowledge gained there was used to launch the production of AKS ball bearings. 2 January 1985 - This date was beginning of further administrative-organizational evolution at FŁT, as it was converted from a state company to a joint stock company. The spin-off of several single companies from the whole enterprise resulted in increasing efficiency and more effective management. Constant modernization of the stock of machines, and improving the organization of work, gave a significant increase in efficiency and productivity. After privatization, a 2700-person crew at FŁT-Kraśnik S.A. is able to manufacture the same number of bearings as 8500 persons did in the earlier 1980s. As a result of privatization, FŁT-Kraśnik S.A. has obtained customers world-wide and managed to increase the number of bearings delivered for OEM and Tier 1 production. Products from Kraśnik have found recipients in almost every European country, in North and South America, Asia and Africa. The expansion became possible by introducing a quality management system, in accordance with ISO/TS, and constant increases in product quality. 12 August 2002 - FŁT-Kraśnik S.A. began sold its newly founded sub-entity, Rolling Elements Workshop - Kraśnik Sp. Z o.o. (responsible for production of rolling elements and needle bearings), to a Japanese-American company, Tsubaki-Hoover. 8 December 2005 - FŁT-Kraśnik S.A. sold its Thermal-Electric Plant (responsible for generation of heat and electricity for the factory and the city) to Praterm Company. 2005 - Over the course of the year, FŁT-Kraśnik implemented an integrated Management System which included: * A quality system (ISO/TS 16949 and ISO 9001 certificates); * An environmental management system (ISO 14001 certificate); and * An industrial health and safety management system (OHSAS 18001 and PN-N 18001 certificates).

Claude Wathey (full name Albert Claudius Wathey; 1926 – January 1998), was a prominent politician of the Democratic Party from the island of Sint Maarten. He was knighted by the Dutch Crown for his political longevity. Wathey championed political independence for the island in 1989, but was later convicted on charges of perjury; however, many on Sint Maarten felt the trial was nothing more than a witch hunt conducted by his rivals and adversaries in Curaçao and the Netherlands in order to break his monopoly on political power in Sint Maarten and to destroy his credibility. Despite this, he remains a popular figure, even after his death. Biography The Wathey family is an old Caribbean family of Belgian origin, from the city of Tongeren. With the proclamation of the Islands Regulation of the Netherlands Antilles in 1951, the Dutch islands obtained greater political autonomy, in the wake of worldwide de-colonization. Three years later, the Charter for the Kingdom of the Netherlands was proclaimed, giving full autonomy to the federation of the six islands as a constituent country of the Kingdom of the Netherlands. Claude (as he was known) was elected to the Parliament of the Netherlands Antilles in 1954, representing the three Dutch Windward Islands of Saba, Statia, and Sint Maarten. Under his administration, Sint Maarten was transformed from a neglected colonial backwater into a thriving tourism destination with one of the highest per capita incomes in the region. He won every election until 1990, and made a comeback in 1991 after a brief setback. After declaring that he was a \\"proud Caribbean man\\", he resigned from office in 1992 in protest against Dutch \\"higher supervision\\", a form of oversight and financial control imposed by the Dutch government to ensure \\"good governance\\", after allegations of the island's first coalition government fell and Wathey's main rivals found themselves in opposition again. In 1994 Wathey was charged with corruption, fraud, and being part of a \\"criminal\\" organization; however, he was never sentenced or convicted on any of the latter, but received a one-year prison sentence for perjury. In the duration of his trial Claude Wathey claimed serious health troubles hindered him from appearing in court which delayed the painstaking trial. Claude spent his remaining days on Sint Maarten and died in January 1998.  References  * Edgar H. Lynch, Julian C.

He played eight seasons in Major League Baseball (MLB) for the Boston Red Sox, Detroit Tigers, Chicago Cubs, and Chicago White Sox. Dillard, a reserve infielder, played mainly as a second baseman. Early life Born in Memphis, Tennessee, Steve Dillard was raised in Saltillo, Mississippi. He played shortstop for Saltillo High School. Dillard was drafted by the San Diego Padres in the 13th round of the 1970 Major League Baseball draft, but did not sign as he had been awarded a full scholarship to the University of Mississippi. After two years of college, he was drafted by the Boston Red Sox in the second round of the 1972 MLB draft. Playing career Boston Red Sox (1972–1977) Dillard began his professional career in 1972 playing for the Winston-Salem Red Sox of the Class A Carolina League, with whom he played the entirety of the 1973 season. After recovering from offseason shoulder surgery, Dillard was assigned to the Double-A Bristol Red Sox of the Eastern League for 1974. After approximately one month, he was promoted to the Triple-A Pawtucket Red Sox in the International League. Though having started the 1975 season at Triple-A, more shoulder problems in the first half resulted in a rehab assignment at Double-A. Dillard was called up to the Boston Red Sox in the final week of the season. He made his major league debut on September 28, scoring two runs on two hits and stealing a base. He was a wide-ranging, slick-fielding middle infielder who had quick hands and was above average at turning the double play, but the Red Sox thought they might be able to convert him from a utility player to a second baseman. He began the 1976 campaign with Boston, but was sent down to the Triple-A Rhode Island Red Sox for two months in an attempt to convert him to second, where as he had primarily played as a shortstop up until this time. While in Boston, Dillard became a valuable backup for second baseman Denny Doyle, and eventually for shortstop Rick Burleson and third baseman Butch Hobson. Dillard played the entire 1977 season with Boston, but saw little playing time. Across three seasons with the Red Sox, he appeared in 124 games, including 63 at second base, 21 at shortstop, 18 at third base, and 13 as a designated hitter. Detroit Tigers (1978) After the Red Sox acquired second baseman Jerry Remy from the California Angels, Dillard was sent to the Detroit Tigers in exchange for two minor leaguers and cash considerations on January 30, 1978. He provided solid support for young infielders Lou Whitaker (second base) and Alan Trammell (shortstop) for a full year. He appeared in 54 games, including 41 at second base, for the Tigers in 1978. Chicago Cubs (1979–1981) During 1979's spring training, he was traded to the Chicago Cubs for a player to be named later (Ed Putman). His most productive season came in his first year at Chicago, when he hit a career-high .283 batting average with five home runs and 31 runs in 89 games played. The following season, he posted career-numbers in games (100), hits (55), and RBI (27). The baseball strike came in 1981, curtailing time of play for everyone, and Dillard's average dropped to .218 in more limited action, though he still amassed 26 hits in 119 at-bats just in 53 games. He played three seasons with the Cubs, appearing in 242 games, including 130 at second and 67 at third. Chicago White Sox (1982) Dillard was released by the Cubs after the 1981 season, and he later signed as a free agent with the Chicago White Sox for 1982. He played the majority of the season with the Triple-A Edmonton Trappers of the Pacific Coast League, but was called up for 16 games, all at second base, near the season's end. He was released after the season. In an eight-season career, Dillard was a .243 hitter (246-for-1013) with 13 home runs and 102 RBI in 438 games, including 148 runs, 50 doubles, 6 triples, and 15 stolen bases. Managerial career Dillard managing the Quad Cities River Bandits in 2008 Following his playing retirement, Dillard started a managing career in the Chicago White Sox minor league system. In 1983 and 1984, he managed their rookie Gulf Coast League White Sox. He was reassigned to the Double-A Glens Falls White Sox of the Eastern League for 1985, but returned to the GCL White Sox in 1986 and 1987. He managed the Class A South Bend White Sox in the Midwest League in 1988. From 1989 to 1990, Dillard worked for the Houston Astros as their Minor League Infield Instructor. He continued in the Astros organization as manager of the Class A Short Season Auburn Astros of the New York–Penn League (1991–1992) and Quad Cities River Bandits of the Midwest League (1993–1994). In 1995, he was the hitting coach for the Chicago Cubs' Class A Rockford Cubbies in the Midwest League. After taking time off to see his children play baseball in high school, he returned to baseball in 2000 as skipper of the Jackson DiamondKats of the independent Texas-Louisiana League. In 2006, he joined the St. Louis Cardinals organization. He served as hitting coach for the Quad Cities Swing/River Bandits from 2006 to 2007, but was moved up to coach hitters with their Class A Advanced Palm Beach Cardinals in the Florida State League during the 2007 season. He returned to Quad Cities as their manager in 2008 and 2009. Personal life His son, Tim Dillard, a right-handed sidearm pitcher, has appeared in Major League Baseball for the Milwaukee Brewers.

It was formed from the former 11th Cavalry Squadron FCÁ in October 2005. In 2013 with the reorganisation of the Reserve Defence Forces it became part of the 2nd Cavalry Squadron its Permanent Defence Force parent unit. History The Emergency The unit's roots start during The Emergency. During World War II, Ireland adopted a stance of strict neutrality, and contingency plans were made to defend the state from enemies from abroad, supported mainly by volunteer \\"reservists.\\" A cyclist squadron was formed in March 1942, part of the Corps in the North Dublin area. On 14 May 1942, the 41st Cyclist Squadron was established, made up of active cyclists from Dublin clubs, and training began in the McKee Barracks. Thus, the embryonic 11th Cyclist Regiment L.D.F was born, with the 42nd (An Óige) Cyclist Squadron following shortly afterwards, and the 43rd Cyclist Squadron after that. The Guidgon of the latter included a Pegasus, which was incorporated into the 11th Cavalry (FCÁ) Regimental Guidgon after the Emergency. The next Squadron was the 44th (an Irish speaking unit), and the formation of a Headquarters brought the Regiment to full strength. On 15 October 1944, the Guidgons were formally presented to the Regiment. These units were not involved directly in the conflict in Europe, and when \\"The Emergency\\" ended, the raison d’être for the L.D.F ceased. However, there was recognition of the need for a reserve force, and so all members of the L.D.F were given the option of forming the new Fórsa Cosanta Áitiúil (F.C.Á) in 1946. Post World War II In 1948 the 11th Cavalry Regiment was activated in Dublin, the only armoured unit of its size in the FCA or PDF. The new regiment was equipped with Ford Mark VI armoured cars and a squadron was raised from students at Bolton Street College of Technology. In 1959, the unit was redesignated the 11th Motor Squadron. Between In 1972 and 1987 the unit (renamed the 11th Cavalry Squadron in 1983) was equipped with Landsverk and Leyland armoured cars retired from PDF service.https://www.historyireland.com/20th-century-contemporary-history/the- fca-1946-2005/ The squadron featured in the 1987 documentary A Cast of Thousands.https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v3bKPPOwaIU Into the new millennium, the 11th Cavalry Squadron developed more intensive training programs and a broader range of courses. Those programs and courses consisted of armoured car shoots conducted at least twice a year and FCÁ personnel taking part on the same gunnery shoot as their PDF counterparts. As part of a wider restructure of the defence forces, (which began in 2000), the 11th Cavalry Squadron FCÁ was stood down in October 2005 and the new 62nd Reserve Cavalry Squadron RDF took up the mantel.

Good Life In the fall of 2008 Elliott released his CD Good Life including a song by the late Chicago troubadour Tom Dundee as well as Wake-Up, written for Barack Obama's 2008 US presidential campaign and used in rallies and fundraisers in the last months of that campaign.  The Sons of Starmount - Companion EP Vol 1  Released Spring 2019 - This five-song EP of original songs written from the new Mark Elliott Memoir, The Sons of Starmount was produced and recorded as if it were released in 1977 (the year the story takes place.) Vol 1 represents the 70's singer-songwriter version of the companion EP. Recent Work - Runaway Home Mark is now singing in the Nashville, Americana trio called Runaway Home. Runaway Home is a Panoramic-Americana band founded by two intrepid dreamers and schemers who share a love for music and the places it takes us all. Mark Elliott and Gary Culley are more than just members of a popular traveling band. They are avid outdoorsmen and, lovers of all things wild. This album sums up their 26-year friendship in music and wilderness. It rings with every valley they have camped in, flows with every river they have kayaked and canoed down, and soars with every mountain they have summited. Moreover, of course, this set of music echoes from every stage they have played together over the last quarter century. Gotta Get Outside has thirteen new and old songs written about, and in many cases, within, the wilderness Runaway Home so loves. The album will also be a jumping off point for the band to begin turning their music into action, protecting what is near and dear - nature. The band is actively touring. Mark Elliott and Runaway Home are endorsed by Elixir Strings and Taylor Guitars. He owns and manages the Cub Creek recording studio.Cub Creek homepage External links * https://markelliottcreative.com *http://sonsofstarmount.com * Runaway Home homepage * Related Runaway Home Videos References Category:Living people Category:1967 births Category:Guitarists from Washington, D.C.

Saperstein (born 1941) is an American entrepreneur and founder of Metro Networks. Biography Saperstein was born to Jewish parents in Baltimore. He dropped out of college to sell used cars. When he got stuck in a snowstorm he came up with the idea to sell traffic reports on the radio. He used his Ford Dealership to start his new venture in Baltimore. When Ford withdrew its support of Saperstein and he lost his dealership, he founded Metro Networks in 1978. the company grew to serve over 1,500 radio stations in the U.S. In 1996, Saperstein decided to take Metro Networks public under the Nasdaq exchange, stock symbol MTNT. He made his fortune when he sold the company to Westwood One in 1999 for $1.25 billion in stock. Now he operates tree farms in Texas and Florida: \\"It's a growing business,\\" he once told a reporter for Forbes magazine. In 1988, Saperstein was elected to the Common Cause National Governing Board. Entrepreneurism Saperstein began his career selling used cars in Baltimore, but quickly found there was a niche for radio programming to include traffic reports. While traffic reporting was already a part of radio programming in some cities, Saperstein found there was no single company providing concise reports for stations, either regionally or nationally. In 1978 he founded Metro Networks, in Houston, Texas. The company grew, through the 1980s, into a veritable traffic reporting empire, and in 1996, Saperstein took the company public on the Nasdaq exchange. In 1992, Saperstein's daughter married Shane Coppola in Baltimore, Maryland in a wedding that was described as \\"the social event of the season in the nation's capital.\\" The wedding is referenced in the 1993 film Dave, starring Kevin Kline. In 1998, Saperstein, with his son-in-law, Coppola, began negotiating a merger agreement with Westwood One, and in September 1999 three companies merged, Metro Networks, Copter Acquisition Corp. and Westwood One. Only 9 days before the merger between Metro Networks and Westwood One, Saperstein started a new company called Five \\"S\\" Capital, Inc. Five \\"S\\" is an investment company that helps to fund new business development. Philanthropy Saperstein sits on the boards of Cedars-Sinai Hospital and Music Center of Los Angeles. He is also a member of the Homeland Security Advisory Committee. In 2006, the Saperstein Critical Care tower that bears his name was opened at Cedars-Sinai Medical Center. Initially named the David and Suzanne Saperstein Tower, it had to be renamed after his rancorous divorce. In 2009, he donated $12 million to help build the Milken Middle School, a Jewish day school in Los Angeles, California; it was renamed the David Saperstein Middle School in his honor.Jewish Journal: \\"Milken Middle School Gets New Campus\\" by Julie Gruenbaum Fax September 2, 2009 Personal life Saperstein has been married three times. He has two children with his first wife, Phyllis Grief: Michelle Saperstein Coppola and Jennifer Saperstein Kalapoutis. In 2006, Saperstein divorced his second wife of 23 years, Swedish philanthropist Suzanne () Saperstein, whom he married in 1986. He had the divorce papers served to her in Texas on a stopover on her way from California to Europe. They had three children: Jonathan (b. 1987), Alexis (b. 1988), and Stefanie (b 1990).W Magazine: \\"Oh, Suzanne - After lying low during her billion-dollar divorce, Suzanne Saperstein is back—with a new man and plenty of unexpected new missions\\" by Christopher Bagley December 2008 Saperstein later married another Swedish woman, Hillevi Svensson (1973–2019) from Bua in Varberg, formerly nanny to his children.Sunday Independent: \\"The billion-dollar divorce - Magnate may lose half his fortune to high-spending wife in biggest ever settlement\\" by David Usborne April 23, 2006 They had twins together. On January 2, 2019, Hillevi died while vacationing in Anguilla with David and their two children. His cousin, Ken Mehlman was the former national Republican chair and president George W. Bush's strategist for both of his terms. During the 1990s, Saperstein built a 12-bedroom, 15-bathroom Versailles-style estate for his then-wife, Suzanne, sprawled across several acres on Carolwood Drive in Holmby Hills. The home is listed by Forbes magazine as one of the most expensive in the United States, with an estimated property value of about $125 million. The compound, which according to W Magazine is inspired by France's 17th-century Vaux-le-Vicomte, occupies about and is called Fleur de Lys (\\"Lily Flower\\" in French). The home took five years to build and the couple were divorced 18 months after it was completed.

Created for the 1964 New York World's Fair, it is located in Flushing Meadows–Corona Park in Queens, New York City. De Lue was among a total of five sculptors who would create pieces for the fairground. He was contracted in 1962 for the amount of $105,000 with a deadline for completion of under six months. De Lue completed a full plaster model in 1963 at which time it was sent to Italy to be cast. Description Rocket Thrower stands high and depicts an athletic and god-like man launching, with his right hand, a small sphere into the sky which leaves an arcing trail of flames behind. His left hand is raised skyward and reaches for a swirl of stars which encircle the path of the rocket. Rocket Thrower left leg strains and crouches with his left foot planted on an arched perch. His right leg extends out fluidly. On the front of the perch (facing the Unisphere) are three distinct stars arranged in an angled line across its short width. Over time the statue has been affected by corrosion and the structural integrity has diminished. One arm was repaired in 1989. The statue was significantly restored in 2013. Reception When released, the critics of the time had mixed reviews of the work. De Lue explained the work as \\"the spiritual concept of man’s relationship to space and his venturesome spirit backed up by all the powers of his intelligence for the exploration of a new dimension.\\" However, The New York Times art critic John Canaday described it as \\"the most lamentable monster, making Walt Disney look like Leonardo Da Vinci.\\" Gallery File:Rocket thrower knee jeh.jpg|Southwestern side File:Unisphere Fountains - The Rocket Thrower 01.jpg|Another view of Rocket Thrower See also * Outdoor sculpture in New York City  References   External links  * Category:1963 sculptures Category:1964 New York World's Fair Category:Bronze sculptures in New York City Category:Buildings and structures in Queens, New York Category:Flushing Meadows–Corona Park Category:Nude sculptures in New York (state) Category:Outdoor sculptures in New York City Category:Rocket sculptures Category:Sculptures of men in New York City Category:Statues in New York City ","title":"Rocket Thrower"},{"id":"13092368","text":"Roland Beerli is a Swiss bobsledder who won competed during the 1980s.

Childhood and education Bourne was born in Avebury, England, and grew up in a small village situated in the Cotswolds, where he took up the trombone aged nine. In 1989, Bourne attended Kingham Hill School and began playing cello the following year. After seeing Frank Sinatra play on television in 1993, Bourne began to teach himself the piano.Biography at matthewbourne.com Bourne enrolled at Leeds College of Music in 1995 where he began to explore contemporary classical composition and avant-garde. During his time at the college, he performed Michael Daugherty’s piano concerto \\"Tombeau de Liberace\\" and John Cage’s \\"Concerto for Prepared Piano and Orchestra\\". In 2001, Bourne graduated from the MMus jazz studies course.Alumni and Fellowships, Leeds College of Music Bourne has subsequently taught as a part-time lecturer at Leeds College of Music and has a PhD in performance from the University of Leeds. Career Bourne's success began in 2001 when he was named the Perrier Young Jazz Musician of the Year. His success continued the following year when he was awarded the prize for Jazz Innovation at the BBC Radio Jazz Awards. In this period, Bourne was profiled in The Observer Music Monthly as \\"the future sound of jazz\\". In 2005, he won the International Jazz Festivals Organisation International Jazz Award. His first solo album, The Molde Concert, was recorded live at the Molde International Jazz Festival and received positive reviews. This performance showcased Bourne's inventive use of samples (including audio clips from The Simpsons and other TV shows) as well as his \\"cyclonic energy and virtuosity\\" and \\"ramblingly self-deprecating and sometimes off-mic announcements\\". By this stage, Bourne had also become co- leader of The Electric Dr M, Distortion Trio and Bourne/Davis/Kane, and was beginning to work in a wider context, leading to notable collaborations with artists and groups such as Nostalgia 77, Marc Ribot, Paul Dunmall, Annette Peacock, John Zorn, Pete Wareham, Barre Phillips and Tony Bevan. Bourne has been commissioned to write works for Bath International Music Festival, London Jazz Festival, Leeds Fuse Festival as well as from the pianist Joanna MacGregor and Faber Music. Bourne’s work has been broadcast on various BBC radio and television programmes. Montauk Variations, Bourne's first studio album as a solo artist, was awarded the Leftfield Album of the Year award by the Sunday Times. Its \\"lyrical and romantic\\" mood marked a change in musical direction from the avant-garde tone of his earlier work. Montauk Variations caught the attention of Amon Tobin and Nancy Elizabeth, both of whom invited Bourne to rework their material, and Simon Green of Bonobo selected the composition \\"Juliet\\" for inclusion in his release of the Late Night Tales compilation series. In 2015, Bourne embarked on a UK tour with an audio/visual project entitled Radioland. This was a collaboration with Antoine Schmitt and Franck Vigroux to celebrate the 40th anniversary of the release of Radio- Activity by Kraftwerk. The Anglo-French trio \\"take the album’s melodies and textures as the starting point for avant-garde explorations\\" that saw Bourne performing on a variety of analogue synthesisers as well as singing in German through a vocoder. An album of this music, entitled Radioland: Radio-Activity Revisited, was released digitally on The Leaf Label in December, with physical copies available in January 2016. Bourne's second solo album, moogmemory, was released on The Leaf Label on 4 March 2016. This is the only album ever recorded with only the Lintronics Advanced Memorymoog, a Memorymoog synthesiser converted by Rudi Linhard in a process which is the \\"equivalent of open heart surgery\\" replacing \\"1,300 components over eight weeks\\".

Later, the unit was incorporated into the Special Air Service Brigade and became the 5th Special Air Service (known as the Belgian SAS squadron). The SAS squadron was active during WWII until enemy activities were discontinued. They performed several operations using the parachute regiment and armoured jeeps. Thereafter, the unit also took part in counterintelligence operations. On 21 September 1945 5th SAS was transferred from the British Army to the newly reformed Belgian Army. Renamed the Regiment of Parachutists SAS they served independently as a highly mobile airborne unit until 1952 when the regiment joined with the Commando Regiment to form a battalion of the Paracommando Regiment.

Names and substances included in programming vary across the UK. In England, some DATs also have a remit for alcohol and are called Drug and Alcohol Action Teams (\\"DAAT\\"). English DATs and DAATs operate within their top level local authority (i.e. county or unitary authority). In Scotland, all DATs also have a remit for alcohol and are now called Alcohol and Drug Partnerships (\\"ADP\\"). In Wales, five Drug and Alcohol Action Teams were replaced by four Strategic Coordination Teams (“SCT”) in each of the Welsh police authority areas. All of these agencies focus on coordinating services for their local communities. These services, according to the Bournemouth DAAT, can include: identifying important local drug misuse issues; creating local action plans and programs; designing treatment and other interventions to help people with substance abuse issues; support alcohol and drug interventions; develop and support recovery programs. The status of DATs changed with the arrival of Crime and Disorder Reduction Partnerships (“CDRP”) in England and Community Safety Partnerships (“CSP”) in Wales in 1998. In some areas, DAT functions are carried out by the CDRP. In others, the DAT is effectively a sub-committee of the CDRP. DATs in England are funded from various sources, including the Pooled Treatment Budget (PTB) via the National Treatment Agency for Substance Misuse (NTA) and the Drug Interventions Programme via the Home Office.

Biography Originally from Derby, Kansas and a 1995 graduate of Southern Methodist University with a degree in piano performance, Albrecht was a pianist with the Dallas Symphony Orchestra and taught piano in the mid-1990s. Career A member of the Dallas band Sorta, Albrecht played keyboards, guitar, and provided vocals. Albrecht also fronted his own popular Dallas band, Sparrows, which included Ward Williams and Danny Balis (also of Sorta), Bryan Wakeland (Polyphonic Spree), Mike Daane (Andy Timmons Band), and later on Brant Cole and Dave Monsey (Fiona Apple). Sparrows released two critically acclaimed albums, Rock and Roll Days (2002) and Snowflakes (2004) before disbanding in 2005. Prior to Sparrows, Albrecht played guitar in another popular local band, The Limes, which also included his friend Ward Williams on bass and Joey Shanks (Slider Pines) on guitar and vocals. Albrecht made guest appearances on several albums recorded in Dallas in the last few years. He was putting the final touches on his first solo effort, Jesus is Alive...and Living in London at the time of his death. The album was approximately 75% complete at the time. With financial assistance from Edie Brickell, the material was mastered and finally released in February 2009. Death In the pre-dawn hours of 3 September 2007, Albrecht was shot and killed by his girlfriend's neighbor. After having some drinks with his girlfriend Ryann Rathbone at a Dallas bar, Albrecht became intoxicated. Rathbone drove him to her house, and they both took a dose of Chantix (a drug to break nicotine addiction). A short while later, Albrecht began speaking incoherently, broke a drinking glass on a table, and hit Rathbone several times, something he had never done before. She ran outside, and Albrecht followed. Rathbone re-entered her home and locked the doors behind her. Albrecht yelled and pounded on her front door in an unsuccessful attempt to reenter her house. At this point, Albrecht went into Rathbone's neighbor's backyard, and he and his wife were awakened by the loud pounding and yelling at their back door. Albrecht was told to stop, but he did not; Rathbone's neighbor then says he fired a \\"warning shot\\" through the door. The door was made of thick, opaque glass, and the porch was well lit. The shot hit the 6' 5\\" Albrecht in the head, and he died at the scene. No charges were filed. The autopsy report indicated Albrecht had a blood alcohol content of 0.29 g/dl (grams/deciliter), more than three times the legal driving limit in Texas of 0.08 g/dl, when he was shot. People close to Albrecht state that his actions prior to the shooting were atypical, even after having had too much to drink, and that his behavior may have been affected by his use of the prescription drug Chantix, which he was taking to help him stop smoking. Addiction expert Dr. Bryon Adinoff considers that the interaction of Chantix with the alcohol he consumed that evening might have been a factor.

Life His father, Meyer Löw Schomberg (1690–1761), was a German-Jewish doctor and settled in England c. 1720 and set up a flourishing practice in Fenchurch Street, London. Two of Alexander's brothers followed their father's profession – the eldest, Isaac, and Ralph or Raphael – and two others (Moses and Solomon) went into the law, but Alexander instead opted for the navy. Like his brothers, however, he was brought up a Jew but attended St Paul's School, London, and renounced the Jewish faith by publicly receiving the sacrament according to the Anglican rites and thus being able to enter on public careers without impediment from the Test Act. Joining the Navy in 1743 as a midshipman under Captain Edward Pratten on HMS Suffolk (70 guns), he passed his examination for lieutenant on 3 December 1747, entering the sloop Hornet on 11 December and transferring from there to Speedwell, another sloop, in the West Indies in spring 1750. The latter ship, however, returned to England, and was paid off in July 1751, with Schomberg and her other officers placed on half pay. Schomberg's next appointment came in February 1755, under Captain Peter Denis on the Medway. This ship, however, was only in the home fleet and on the Bay of Biscay station and he was put on half pay again from June to October 1756. He then was appointed to the Intrepid (formerly the French ship Serieux, 64 guns), under Captain Pratten again. Promotion to captain eventually came on 5 April 1757, briefly in command of the new frigate Richmond, then from the end of 1757 in command of HMS Diana, 32 guns. In the Diana he played a distinguished part in the taking of Louisburg in 1758 (taking the fleet's commander in Edward Boscawen in close to reconnoitre the coast, covering the landing and taking command of a party of seamen landed to man the batteries) and Quebec in 1759/60 (bombarding the shore under Charles Saunders and repulsing a French attempt to regain the city), and was a close associate of James Wolfe. He was then sent back in 1760 with the news of the victories. There he was appointed to the Essex, with that ship taking part in the 1764 reduction of Belle Île, under Commodore Augustus Keppel and then serving in the Brest and Biscay fleet until the peace. At the peace of 1763 he received a commemorative gold medal for his service in Canada and married (see below). At the end of 1770 he was appointed to the Prudent, which had been commissioned due to the dispute between Britain and Spain about the Falkland Islands and was paid off at the end of the dispute. In late 1771 he became captain of HMS Dorset, the Lord Lieutenant of Ireland's yacht. Lord Sandwich, First Lord of the Admiralty opposed Alexander taking up this role, seeing it as virtually a retirement from active service, to no avail (though he then prevented Alexander from re-entering active service when Alexander too came to this opinion, soon after taking up the role). Alexander was, however, knighted by the lord lieutenant in 1777 for his long and active service, though (remaining Dorset's captain until 1804 – a yacht captain had to leave that post if he wished to be promoted to a flag rank) he progressed no further than the top of the captains' list as the most senior serving captain of the Navy, though he spent many years in that position. Also during this time he wrote \\"A sea manual recommended to the young officers of the Royal Navy as a companion to the signal book\\" (1789), and had his second son, Alexander Wilmot, and his youngest son, Charles Marsh, serving under him on the Dorset. On his death, he was buried in the churchyard at St Peter's, County Dublin. HMS Dorset royal yacht in the Bay of Dublin ca. 1787 Marriage and issue In August 1763, when peace came, he married Arabella Susannah Chalmers, only child of the Revd James Chalmers and Arabella, sister and heiress of Sir Edmond Alleyne, baronet, of Hatfield Peverel, perhaps with Hogarth's portrait commissioned and completed in time for the wedding. Alexander and Arabella's five children were baptized in the Christian faith. References * G. L. Green, The Royal Navy and Anglo-Jewry (1989) * J. Charnock, ed., Biographia navalis, 6 (1798), 273 * G.

History The station was opened on 9 October 1905 by the Earl of Derby. It generated electricity using two 1,500 kW turbo generating sets made by British Thomson-Houston. Radcliffe Power Station was the first power station in the UK to transmit power by bare electrical conductors at 10kV. The station was fed coal by the nearby East Lancashire Railway line. The station was progressively expanded, reaching a combined capacity of 42,375 kW following the installation of two extra 10,000 kW British Thomson-Houston generating sets in 1922. In May 1926, The Times reported that the cost of generation per unit of electricity was .25d (approximately £0.001 today), the cost per unit sold being .483d (approximately £0.002). The station had delivered 125,727,060 units of electricity. The station was originally operated by The Lancashire Electric Power Company but was operated by the British Electricity Authority, Central Electricity Authority and Central Electricity Generating Board after nationalisation in 1947. It was closed a few years later in 1959.

Cell synchrony is a vital process in the study of cells progressing through the cell cycle as it allows population-wide data to be collected rather than relying solely on single-cell experiments. The types of synchronization are broadly categorized into two groups; physical fractionization and chemical blockade. Physical Separation Physical fractionation is a process by which continuously dividing cells are separated into phase-enriched populations based on characteristics such as the following: *Cell density *Cell size *The presence of cell surface epitopes marked by antibodies *Light scatter *Fluorescent emission by labeled cells. Given that cells take on varying morphologies and surface markers throughout the cell cycle, these traits can be used to separate by phase. There are two commonly used methods. Centrifugal Elutriation  (Previously called: counter streaming centrifugation) Centrifugal elutriation can be used to separate cells in different phases of the cell cycle based on their size and sedimentation velocity (related to sedimentation coefficient). Because of the consistent growth patterns throughout the cell cycle, centrifugal elutriation can separate cells into G1, S, G2, and M phases by increasing size (and increasing sedimentation coefficients) with diminished resolution between G2 and M phases due to cellular heterogeneity and lack of a distinct size change. Larger cells sediment faster, so a cell in G2, which has experienced more growth time, will sediment faster than a cell in G1 and can therefore be fractionated out. Cells grown in suspension tend to be easier to elutriate given that they do not adhere to one another and have rounded, uniform shapes. However, some types of adherent cells can be treated with trypsin and resuspended for elutriation as they will assume a more rounded shape in suspension. Flow Cytometry and Cell Sorting Flow cytometry allows for detection, counting, and measurement of the physical and chemical properties of cells. Cells are suspended in fluid and put through the flow cytometer. Cells are sent one at a time through a laser beam and the light scatter is measured by a detector. Cells or their components can be labeled with fluorescent markers so that they emit different wavelengths of light in response to the laser, allowing for additional data collection. For quantitative cell cycle analysis, cells are usually fixed with ethanol and stained with DNA-binding dyes like propidium iodide, Hoechst 33342, DAPI, 7-Aminoactinomysin D, Mithramycin, DRAQ5, or TO-PRO-3, allowing for determination of phase by DNA quantity.Banfalvi G. (2011) Overview of Cell Synchronization. In: Banfalvi G. (eds) Cell Cycle Synchronization. Methods in Molecular Biology (Methods and Protocols), vol 761. Humana Press. However, if these cells have been fixed, they are dead and cannot be maintained for continued growth. Cells can also be resuspended in media and dyed with non- toxic dyes to maintain living cultures. Cells can also be genome edited such that some cellular proteins are made with conjugated fluorescent tags such as GFP, mCherry, and Luciferase that can be used to detect and quantify those components. For example, chimeric histone H2B-GFP constructs can be made and used to measure DNA content and determine replication status as a means of discerning cell phase. Light scatter measurements can be used to determine characteristics like size, allowing for distinction of cell phase without tagging. Flow cytometers can be used to collect multiparameter cytometry data, but cannot be used to separate or purify cells. Fluorescence-activated cell sorting (FACS) is a technique for sorting out the cells based on the differences that can be detected by light scatter (e.g. cell size) or fluorescence emission (by penetrated DNA, RNA, proteins or antigens). The system works much like flow cytometry, but will also charge each cell droplet after it has been measured based on a defined parameter. The charged droplet will then encounter an electrostatic deflection system that will sort the cell to a different container based on that charge. This allows cells to be separated on the basis of fluorescent content or scatter. To summarize, flow cytometry alone can be used to gather quantitative data about cell cycle phase distribution, but flow cytometry in coordination with FACS can be used to gather quantitative data and separate cells by phase for further study. Limitations include: * for light scatter measurements, poor resolution between G2 and M (as with centrifugal elutriation) * for fixed cells, unable to maintain living cultures * for unfixed but dyed cells, possible disruption or mutagenesis of cells because of dye treatment * some population heterogeneity may be maintained, as size separation may not always be accurate for measuring phase and not all cells may be at the same point within each phase (early G1 vs late G1) * for DNA-edited cells, the process may take an extended period of time Chemical blockade The addition of exogenous substrates can be used to block cells in certain phases of the cell cycle and frequently target cell cycle checkpoints. These techniques can be carried out in vitro and do not require removal from the culture environment. The most common type of chemical blockade is arrest-and-release, which involves treatment of a culture with a chemical block and subsequent release by washing or addition of a neutralizing agent for the block. While chemical blockade is typically more effective and precise than physical separation, some methods can be imperfect for various reasons, including: * the proportion of synchronized cells is insufficient * chemical manipulations may disrupt cellular function and/or kill a portion of cells * the treatment is toxic and not applicable in vivo (only relevant if considering clinical application)  Arrest in M  Mitotic arrest can be achieved through many methods and at various points within M-phase, including the G2/M transition, the metaphase/anaphase transition, and mitotic exit.  Nocodazole  Nocodazole is a rapidly-reversible inhibitor of microtubule polymerization that can be used to arrest cells before Anaphase at the spindle assembly checkpoint in the metaphase/anaphase transition. The microtubule poison works by blocking the formation of the mitotic spindles that attach to and pull apart sister chromatids in dividing cells. Cells will remain arrested until the nocodazole has been washed out. Nocodazole does not appear to disrupt interphase metabolism, and released cells return to normal cell cycle progression. Because microtubules are vital in other cellular functions, sustained use of nocodazole can result in disruption of those functions, causing cell death.  Inhibition of CDK1  CDK1 is necessary for the transition from G2 to M phase. RO-3306 is a selective CDK1 inhibitor that can reversibly arrest cells at the G2/M border. RO-3306 synchronized >95% of cycling cells (including cancer cells), and released cells rapidly enter mitosis.  Roscovitine  Roscovitine can be used to inhibit the activity of cyclin-dependent kinases (CDKs) by competing with ATP in the ATP-binding region of the kinase. Its effects are potent, arresting cells by knocking down the function of CDKs necessary for cell cycle progression. Roscovitine can be used to arrest cells in G0/G1, G1/S, or G2/M transitions.  Colchicine  Colchicine arrests cells in metaphase and is a microtubule poison preventing mitotic spindle formation, much like nocodazole. It works by depolymerizing tubulin in microtubules, blocking progression to anaphase through sustained arrest at the spindle assembly checkpoint.  Arrest in S (G1/S arrest)  Arrest in S phase typically involves inhibition of DNA synthesis as the genome is being replicated. Most methods are reversible through washing.  Double thymidine block  High concentrations of thymidine interrupt the deoxynucleotide metabolism pathway through competitive inhibition, thus blocking DNA replication. A single treatment with thymidine arrests cells throughout S phase, so a double treatment acts to induce a more uniform block in early S phase.G. Banfalvi (ed.), Cell Cycle Synchronization, Methods in Molecular Biology 761, DOI 10.1007/978-1-61779-182-6_10, © Springer Science+Business Media, LLC 2011 The process begins with a treatment with thymidine, washing of the culture, followed by another thymidine treatment.  Hydroxyurea  Hydroxyurea decreases the production of dNTPs by inhibiting the enzyme ribonucleotide reductase. This serves to halt DNA synthesis by depriving DNA polymerase of dNTPs at replication forks. Hydroxyurea is also used to treat certain types of cancer and blood disorders.  Aphidicolin  Aphidocolin is a fungus-derived tetracyclic diterpenoid that acts as a selective inhibitor for DNA polymerase α. This enzyme is necessary for replicative DNA synthesis, but does not disrupt DNA repair synthesis or mitochondrial DNA replication.  Arrest in G1  A single commonly-used chemical method exists for synchronization of cells in G1. It involves Lovastatin, a reversible competitive inhibitor of 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl-coenzyme A reductase, an enzyme vital in the production of mevalonic acid. Mevalonic acid is a key intermediate in the mevalonate pathway responsible for synthesis of cholesterol. Addition of cholesterol to Lovastatin-treated cells does not undo the arrest affect, so Lovastatin appears to inhibit the formation of some early intermediate in the pathway that is essential for progression through early G1.  Other Methods of Synchronization   Mitotic Selection  Mitotic selection is a drug- free procedure for the selection of mitotic cells from a monolayer undergoing exponential growth. During mitosis, cells undergo changes in morphology, and mitotic selection takes advantage of this in adherent cells grown in a monolayer. The cells become more spherical, decreasing the surface area of cell membrane attached to the culture plate. Mitotic cells can therefore be completely detached by gently shaking and collected from the supernatant. Nutrient/Serum Deprivation Elimination of serum from the culture medium for about 24 hours results in the accumulation of cells at the transition between G0 quiescence and early G1. This arrest is easily reversible through addition of serum or the deprived nutrient. Upon release, progression through the cell cycle is variable, as some cells remain quiescent while others proceed through the cell cycle at variable rates.  Contact Inhibition  Contact inhibition occurs when cells are allowed to grow to high or full confluence, maximizing cell-to-cell contact. This triggers arrest in early G1 in normal cells. Arrest is reversed by replating cells at a lower density. Because of the proliferation-promoting mutations intrinsic to cancer, tumor cell lines are not usually able to undergo contact inhibition, though there are exceptions.

Etymology The name is derived from two elements in Irish: the first, os, means \\"deer\\"; the second element, car, means \\"loving\\" or \\"friend\\", thus \\"deer-loving one\\" or \\"friend of deer\\". The name is borne by a character in Irish mythology—Oscar, grandson of Fionn Mac Cumhaill, and refers to his descent from his grandmother, Sadhbh, who was enchanted into the form of a deer. Alternatively, it may derive from the Old English name osgar or its Old Norse cognate Ásgeirr (a personal name itself composed of the elements meaning \\"god\\" and \\"spear\\"), which may have been brought to Ireland by Viking (Germanic) invaders and settlers. The name was popularised in the 18th century by James Macpherson, creator of 'Ossianic poetry'. Today the name is associated with Scandinavia because Napoleon was an admirer of Macpherson's work and gave the name to his godson, Joseph Bernadotte, who later became Oscar I, King of Sweden. Consequently, at the time many Swedes were named Oscar. The name was given to more than a half- dozen members of Scandinavian royal houses. Oscar was the third most popular name for males born in Sweden in 2013 and is ranked 51 in terms of the most popular male names in Sweden. The surname McCusker originates as an Anglicised form of the Irish Mac Oscair as does the anglicised surname Cosgrave.

Academics NVHS runs on a quarter system. Unusual in public education is its grading standard, which requires a grade of B- or better in order to pass a class. New Vista maintains relationships with the nearby University of Colorado and both major high schools in Boulder, Boulder High School and Fairview High School, allowing students access to courses available through those institutions. New Vista works on a different credit system from other regional public schools, but transfer students are still accepted. Two NVHS credits are equal to either one year at a traditional high school or one MAPS (Minimum Academic Preparation Standards) credit. In order to graduate, NVHS students must complete a Culminating Project, a substantial work designed and executed independently by seniors. Community Every student at New Vista is assigned to a mixed-grade advisory class which they attend for all four years. Advisors help students stay on track with academics, scheduling and general support. Community Gatherings are held once a week every Wednesday. A mandatory opportunity for students and teachers to gather as a whole and discuss recent/upcoming events, any important announcements and other critical details. Career development On Wednesdays, school ends at 11:30 and the students can either do a workshop or a Community Experience. Workshops take place on and off campus, led by diverse professionals from the community on a variety of subjects. Past workshops have included herbalism, improvisation, embroidery, and knitting. During Community Experiences, students seek out and then work quarter-long unpaid internships at local businesses. NVHS also has service learning and extra-credit language programs. Extracurricular activities New Vista has a successful, award-winning ultimate frisbee program, open to all students. It is home to the only co-ed volleyball team in the state, which won a 2007 state championship.

The novel tells the story of Gideon Planish, an unprincipled social climber who becomes involved in various shady philanthropic organizations in his quest for stature without accountability. The work did not fare as well with critics as some of Lewis' earlier social novels, and is considered one of his minor works. Plot summary Gideon Planish (1943) takes aim at less-than-honorable fundraising organizations. In a similar manner of his other works, the reader follows the self-titled character through his life and numerous (but slightly related) professions dealing with professional \\"organizationality\\" which is better known as the for-profit industry of pompous fundraising run by shady \\"philanthropists\\" running a wide variety of guilds, committees, foundations, leagues and councils for selfish and greedy purposes. The focus of the book begins with a young Gideon demonstrating a knack for public speaking, and these skills follow him through his self-motivated and selfish undergraduate years at Adelbert College. The book then picks up an older but still vacuous Gideon, now a Professor of Rhetoric at Kinnikinick College, when he finally meets the girl of his dreams; young coed Peony Jackson of Faribault, Minnesota. Motivated by vague dreams of importance, including a dream of becoming a U.S. senator, Gideon begins his campaign for social ascension by moving from one job to another with the hopes of meeting \\"like-minded thinkers\\" with vague goals and even more flexible morals when it came to raising money for a wide variety of causes. Over the years, Gideon's path to easy money with no accountability leads him to: * The Dean of Kinnikinick College where he begins to use this role as a springboard of notoriety by banishing books (Garfield County Censorship Board) and join do-nothing boards (including the Sympathizers with the Pacifistic Purposes of the New Democratic Turkey) to get his name out in the marketplace of opportunity. * Editor of Rural Adult Education publication * Itinerant Lecturer (between jobs) reusing his inventory of high style/low content messages. * Managing Secretary of the Heskett Rural School Foundation * Administration of the Association to Promote Eskimo Culture * Ghostwriter of the autobiography of William T. Knife, creator of Okey-Dokey, a beverage juiced with maximum caffeine for the masses * Assistant General Manager of the Citizen's Conference on Constituational Crisises in the Commonwealth (Cizcon) * Director General of \\"Every Man a Priest Fraternity\\" office * Directive Secretary of the Dynamos of Democratic Direction At 50 years old, when fatigued with the never-ending demands of generating self-importance combined with his realization that he lacked substance and true gravitas, Gideon has an opportunity to return to Kinnikinick College as its next President and allow him to finally begin to achieve something valid. Through a series of realizations by both himself and Peony, he remains in New York and daily regrets their decision. Comparing to other works Gideon Planish is considered a minor work and it was obvious Lewis was rehashing many of his old ideas as many themes and points ring familiar with the target being the shady industry of less-than-legitimate fundraising organizations. While the main character was without moral boundaries, he did remain loyal to his wife (a rare quality in Lewis' characters) but he never achieved anything genuine or of substance as he attempted to achieve everything which focused on style and perception. An earlier character of Lewis', Elmer Gantry, crosses paths with Planish several times in the book but their interactions serve only as a method to emphasize to the reader the similarities between the crooks in organized religion and the crooks in general philanthropy. One of the major reasons causing the novel to be considered relatively minor is the recurring themes of earlier works. These recurring themes imply the creative energy of Lewis was ebbing versus a larger strategy of aligning earlier messages into a larger overall theme. Critics at the time made less than glowing comments and suggested Sinclair Lewis' best days were behind him. The book is not considered one of his best and is usually read by Lewis fans hoping to find a forgotten treasure similar to Dodsworth or The Job.

The college states that its mission is to \\"equip people for a life of discipleship, ministry and leadership in service to the church and community\\"., accessed October 20, 2012 Theologically, Columbia Bible College is evangelical Anabaptist and is operated by two regional Mennonite conferences, British Columbia Mennonite Brethren and Mennonite Church British Columbia. Columbia is accredited by the international Association for Biblical Higher Education (ABHE), and is registered with the British Columbia Private Career Training Institution Association (PCTIA). History Columbia Bible College has its roots in two Abbotsford schools that merged in 1970., accessed March 1, 2009. Mennonite Brethren Bible Institute The Mennonite Brethren Bible Institute (MBBI) began in the South Abbotsford Mennonite Brethren Church in 1936 and was called the South Abbotsford Mennonite Brethren Bible School.Giesbrecht, David. \\"Mennonite Brethren Bible Institute (Abbotsford, British Columbia, Canada).\\" Global Anabaptist Mennonite Encyclopedia Online. October 2010. Accessed September 16, 2013. In 1943, a suitable building was moved to the South Abbotsford church site and the school was renamed Bethel Bible School.Born, Hilda J. \\"Columbia Bible College: Growth in Wisdom and Service.\\" Unpublished, August 1992: 4. Three Mennonite Brethren churches - South Abbotsford, Clearbrook, and Matsqui - joined to support Bethel, which had 34 students that year. The introduction of a high school program led to a temporary relocation of Bethel to a private site in Clearbrook in 1945. In 1946, the Mennonite Educational Institute moved its high school to a new building in Clearbrook, and Bethel returned to its South Abbotsford campus. Under the leadership of J. F. Redekop, principal from 1944, the school gained the additional support of East Aldergrove, McCallum Road, and Arnold M.B. churches. In 1955, the Bible School Society (consisting of the six supporting churches) purchased land in Clearbrook and erected what is now the old wing of the classroom building. This became the MBBI. In 1960, the British Columbia Conference of Mennonite Brethren Churches accepted the responsibility for the operation of MBBI. A record enrollment of 96 was established in 1961–62. The first dormitory was built on the campus in 1962. Increasing enrollments led to two additional dormitories: Redekop Hall in 1966 and Centennial Hall in 1967. A new wing with chapel, classrooms, and music rooms was also added in 1967. In 1970, Mennonite Brethren Conference of B.C. and the Conference of Mennonites in B.C. entered into a five-year working agreement to operate one Bible school.Giesbrecht, David. \\"Columbia Bible College (Abbotsford, British Columbia, Canada).\\" Global Anabaptist Mennonite Encyclopedia Online. December 2012. Accessed September 16, 2013. MBBI merged with Bethel Bible Institute, which was the Conference of Mennonites' school, and the new school was renamed Columbia Bible Institute (CBI). To accommodate the 189 students enrolled, a new dining room/ student lounge complex was built. Bethel Bible Institute Bethel Bible Institute grew out of the concern to establish a Bible school to meet local and provincial church needs amongst the Conference of Mennonites in British Columbia. In 1939, Rev. N. W. Bahnman announced the opening of a Bible school in Coghlan (now Aldergrove) on the premises of the Bethel Mennonite Church. Twenty-two people enrolled in the tuition free classes at Bethel, which were taught by three instructors without pay.Giesbrecht, David and Richard D. Thiessen. \\"Bethel Bible Institute (Abbotsford, British Columbia, Canada).\\" Global Anabaptist Mennonite Encyclopedia Online. February 2012. Accessed September 16, 2013. A society was formed which operated the school for three years (1941–1944), until the Conference of Mennonites in BC assumed full responsibility for the institute. A tract of land was purchased in Abbotsford next to West Abbotsford Mennonite Church, and a dormitory for women was built. In 1947, the administration building was erected. In 1951–52, enrollment increased to 61 students and a dormitory for men was built. The women's dormitory was renovated in 1963. A teachers' residence was erected in 1964. When attendance diminished in the 1960s and the facilities needed improvement, a special Bethel Bible Institute Study Conference on the future of the school was held in May 1967. After prayerful discernment and much dialogue with the Mennonite Brethren Conference of B.C. in 1968–70, the Conference of Mennonites decided to close Bethel and merge with MBBI in nearby Clearbrook. Bethel Bible Institute then became Columbia Bible Institute. Columbia Bible Institute The decade of the seventies was one of growth and expansion for Columbia Bible Institute (CBI). To accommodate a record enrollment of 233 students in 1972–73, four extra housing units (mobiles) were added. In 1975–76, a third year was added to the curriculum and a new record enrollment of 266 was reached. In 1976, a three-story, apartment-style dormitory was constructed. Two years later, the apartment complex was sold, and of land adjacent to the existing campus were purchased for use as an athletics field and for possible campus development. In 1988, Columbia Hall, a three-story residence was completed. An office, administration and library complex was constructed in 1992. An Athletics Centre was built in 2001, home to the \\"Bearcats\\". It features two full size courts and seating for 1200. The Student Centre was expanded in 2004, including a new kitchen and dining room, several student lounges, a career and health/wellness center, student life offices, and a recreation room., accessed April 6, 2009 A new dormitory was completed at the end of 2011, replacing the dormitories dismantled in 2004 to allow for the expansion of the Student Centre. Redekop Hall can accommodate 130 students.McMaster, Barrie. \\"CBC Students Sleep in Dream Residence.\\" Mennonite Brethren Herald (1 March 2012). Accessed 16 September 2013. Historic covenant The working agreement between the Mennonite Brethren and the Conference of Mennonites at CBI was studied from time to time with the desire to make it a partnership in equality, not merely a partnership in operation. In 1982, this co-operative effort was expanded into a covenant whereby the Mennonite Brethren invited the Conference of Mennonites to unite in the ownership and development of CBI, not merely its operation and governance. At the June 11, 1982 joint convention, the Conference of Mennonites responded to the Mennonite Brethren invitation by affirming a continuing covenant of togetherness in working in God's kingdom. Thus, the first inter-Mennonite Bible Institute in North America was established to actively promote and teach a strong evangelical Anabaptist/Mennonite theology as reflected in the school's Confession of Faith and confessions of the supporting conferences. Columbia Bible College Act On June 26, 1987, the B.C. Legislative Assembly passed the Columbia Bible College Act, giving Columbia the right to grant theological degrees.Schmidt, George. \\"The Measure of Five Decades: An Insider’s Tribute to Walter Unger.\\" Direction (Spring 2001): 5-12.

Donenfeld was also a founder of the Albert Einstein College of Medicine.Donenfeld death notice, New York Times (Feb. 28, 1965).  Biography   Early years  Harry Donenfeld was born into a Jewish family in Iași, Romania, and at the age of five emigrated to the United States of America with his parents and his brother Irving. A few years later the family was joined by Harry's two elder brothers Charlie and Mike. Little is known of his early life, as is common with many people entering America during the days of mass immigration; but the family entered America via Ellis Island and took up residence in New York City in the Lower East Side area.Jones, pp. 1–4. Donenfeld spent his early life in and out of school, and later in and out of gangs,Jones, p. 15. refusing to settle down or find an occupation like his brothers, who had set up a printing enterprise. Harry became a clothing salesman working in the city, and saw himself as a class above the ordinary working man, and wanted a better life, but preferably without the hard work. After he avoided the draft in 1917, he married Gussie Weinstein in 1918, and thanks to a loan from her parents he was able to open a clothing store in Newark, New Jersey.Jones, pp. 19–22.  Martin Press  When consumer spending dropped in the US in late 1920, Harry and Gussie's store fell on hard times and by early 1921 they were in debt. Harry's skills of flattery and fast talking were of no use when the country was in economic decline and despite Gussie's best efforts the store went broke.Jones, p. 42. Under pressure to find a steady income, Harry found work with his brothers' printing company, now called Martin Press, as a salesman and fourth partner. During the twenties Martin Press saw a vast expansion in capital. It is speculated that Harry, through links with gangster Frank Costello, moved alcohol, now illegal during the prohibition, along with legitimate Canadian pulp paper across the border. By 1923 Harry had managed his most important sales deal of his life, acquiring the rights for Martin Press to print six million subscription leaflets for Hearst magazines such as Cosmopolitan and Good Housekeeping. This was partly due to his new underworld contacts having close connections with Hearst newspaper salesman Moe Annenberg. The company was able to move from their earlier downtown location to a twelve-story building in the Chelsea district. 1923 also saw the emergence of the brutal business side of Harry as he took control of Martin Press and forced his two older brothers out of the company, leaving Irving as a minority partner and head printer. Harry then changed the company name from Martin Press to Donny Press.Jones, pp. 42–46.  Pulp magazines  From around 1925, Donenfeld began working with Frank Armer to produce lines of girlie pulps published under the auspices of different company names. Donenfeld acquired the girlie pulps Ginger Stories, Pep Stories and Snappy Stories from William Clayton, and put them out under the name of DM.David Saunders. http://www.pulpartists.com/Donenfeld.html He used the names Merwil and later Irwin Publishing to release more magazines along the same lines: Hot Stories, Joy Stories and Juicy Tales.Douglas Ellis. 2003. Uncovered: The Hidden Art of Girlie Pulps. Adventure House. In November 1933, Donenfeld drafted Armer to form a company called Super Magazines which ended up specializing in the mixed girlie/genre pulps, Spicy Adventure, Spicy Detective, Spicy Mystery and Spicy Western. After getting charged with obscenity, and narrowly escaped jail, Donenfeld changed the name of Super Magazines to Culture Publications.David Saunders. http://www.pulpartists.com/Donenfeld.html In January 1943, again trying to clean up their image, he changed the word 'Spicy' to 'Speed' in the four magazines with that name. Speed Western lasted the longest, ceasing publication in 1948. File:Spicy-Adventure Stories November 1934.jpg File:Spicy Detective Stories February 1935.jpg File:Spicy Mystery Stories May 1936.jpg  National Allied Publications  In 1929, as a favor to an old client, Julius Liebowitz, Donenfeld gave work to Julius' son, Jack.Jones, p. 62. Jack and Harry had little in common, but Jack soon emerged as a man who could run finances.Jones, p. 89. Whereas Harry would promise the world to clients without understanding the economic realities, Jack was bookish and ensured bills were paid on time and helped create a respectability in the firm. Soon the two men were spoken of as a partnership. With the financial backing of Paul Sampliner, Irving Donenfeld as head printer, Harry as salesman and Jack Liebowitz running the finances they launched the Independent News Company in 1932.Jones, pp. 89–92. Now Donenfeld was a distributor as well as a publisher and was now no longer reliant on others to run his business. In 1935, Major Malcolm Wheeler-Nicholson approached Independent News in a bid to relaunch his comic book New Fun, having lost his previous backers due to poor sales and debts. Donenfeld accepted to distribute the comic but with heavy loss of rights to Wheeler-Nicholson. The major produced two more titles to be handled by Independent News, New Comics and Detective Comics (which would later see the first appearance of Batman), now under the banner of Detective Comics Inc., in which Wheeler-Nicholson was forced to take Donenfeld and Liebowitz as partners. In 1938, Donenfeld sued Wheeler-Nicholson for nonpayment and Detective Comics Inc. went into bankruptcy. Donenfeld then bought up the company and Wheeler-Nicholson's National Allied Publications in their entirety as part of the action.Jones, pp. 101–102, 107–108, 125 The fourth publication under National Allied Publications would be Action Comics (1938). Issue #1 introduced the superhero, Superman, created by artist Joe Shuster and writer Jerry Siegel. Donenfeld was initially repelled by the seemingly ridiculous fantasy of the character and ordered it never appear on the cover again. However, the property proved tremendously popular and profitable enough to change his mind by issue 7 to make \\"Superman\\" the title's feature. As such, Donenfeld enjoyed not only healthy comic book sales, but also in merchandising such as toys, costumes and even a radio show featuring the character. At the end of 1941 Donenfeld's comic businesses took in $2.6 million. Shuster and Siegel had sold the rights for the character to National Allied Publications, so as Donenfeld became rich, they continued on flat employee fees. Legal actions between the creative pair and National Allied Publications for compensation would continue for decades to come, but Donenfeld allowed Liebowitz to handle this side of his empire.Jones, p. 142.  American Comics Group  Donenfeld also owned a stake in a competitor comics publisher, American Comics Group (ACG). A gin rummy and traveling partner of Benjamin W. Sangor, in 1943 Donenfeld helped Sangor start ACG,Markstein, Don. \\"The American Comics Group,\\" Don Markstein's Toonopedia. Accessed Aug. 29, 2011. which published until 1967.

Injury and death  In 1962, the week before he was set to marry his second wife,\\"Our Hero: Superman on Earth\\", by Tom De Haven; published 2010 by Yale University Press Donenfeld fell, injuring his head, which resulted in a lack of memory and speech from which he never recovered.Donenfeld entry, Who's Who of American Comic Books, 1928–1999. He died at a care home in 1965. Donenfeld was posthumously named in 1985 as one of the honorees by DC Comics in the company's 50th anniversary publication Fifty Who Made DC Great.  Family  Harry's son Irwin Donenfeld was born in 1926,Jones, p. 51. and worked for the firm from 1948 to c. 1968, holding the titles of Editorial Director and Executive Vice President. Harry's daughter Sonia (known as \\"Peachie\\") was born in 1927. She was married to Fred Iger in 1947, had 2 children and the marriage ended in divorce after 15 years.

Butler was born and spent most of her life in Kilmurry, Thomastown, County Kilkenny and was associated with the Newlyn School of painters. Mildred Anne's en plein air style is dominated by the theme of nature and reflects scenes of domesticity around the family home in Kilmurry. She achieved distinction in her lifetime and exhibited in major galleries in Ireland and England. Among her patrons were Queen Mary of Teck and Louis IV, Grand Duke of Hesse. She became a member of the Royal Academy in 1893. In 1896, Butler's Morning Bath was exhibited at the Royal Academy. It was the first work by a female artist to be purchased by the trustees of the Chantrey Bequest and was then presented to the Tate. She became an associate member of the Royal Watercolour Society in 1896 and was granted full membership in 1937. She was one of the first academicians elected by the Ulster Academy of Arts in 1930. She virtually stopped painting by the 1930s due to arthritis and died in 1941, aged 83. Around four hundred pieces of her work were sold as part of the artist's studio sale in 1980. She is celebrated in an postage stamp by An Post.  Life  Mildred Anne was born in 1858 in Kilmurry, a Georgian House near Thomastown and was the youngest daughter of Captain Henry Butler, a grandson of the Edmund Butler, 11th Viscount Mountgarret. Knowledge of Butler's life and working methods are almost entirely on the watercolours themselves and on her diaries, which are preserved for most years between 1892 and 1938. Butler's quirky titles such as Ancient Rubbish, A Tit-Bit and Chucked; Green Eyed Jealousy: Ravens amongst trees show the artist's playful sensibility. Her father, Henry Butler, was an amateur artist favouring subjects from nature he encountered on journeys abroad, in particular exotic plants and animals. Butler spent most of her life in the family home at Kilmurry with frequent trips to England and the continent. She continued painting until the 1930s when she stopped painting due to arthritis and died in 1941, aged 83.  Career  Butler's father Henry may have encouraged her to paint in her youth but her artistic training began in London in the late 1880s with the watercolourist Paul Jacob Naftel, whom she credited for her understanding of watercolours. Butler like her friend Rose Barton, who also studied under Naftel, did not follow his choice of landscape, instead she devoted herself to cattle, birds, and flower gardens. She continued her studies at Westminster School of Art under William Frank Calderon who specialised in animal painting and later opened a school of animal painting. At Frank Calderon's School she studied the subject of cows, and it was that work for which she was elected to the Old Society, the Royal Academy.() In her late twentieths, Butler made annual visits to the continent until the outbreak of war. She travelled to France, Belgium, Switzerland and Italy. In Paris, she studied drawing, figure drawing and fine art painting. While in Paris she became associated with the Newlyn school and went on to spend the summers of 1894 and 1895 in Newlyn in Cornwall. Newlyn at that time was the centre for a group of artists who were interested in plein-air subjects, many of whom had previously studied in France. She was attached to the Newlyn School, and Norman Garstin's studio in particular alongside contemporaries such as Walter Osborne and Sir John Lavery. Garstin like Osborne had been a pupil of the Antwerp master Charles Verlat. Butler established a friendship with Luke Fildes, Stanhope Forbes whom she met at Newlyn. The influence of the Limerick- born Garstin, and Forbes, and the contact with the Newlyn School informed Butler's development and remained an important influence on her work throughout her life. Butler continuously exhibited throughout her career and proved herself to be a keen business woman capable of marketing her watercolours successfully with patrons such as Queen Mary of Teck and Louis IV, Grand Duke of Hesse. She was a member of the Society of Lady Artists. She was one of the first nine academicians elected by the Ulster Academy of Arts in 1930. She was granted full membership into the Royal Watercolour Society in 1937, having been an associate member since 1896.  Style  Meditation (1889) Butler was a painter in oil and watercolour of landscape, genre and animal subjects. Her range of work was dominated by the theme of nature and her subject matter reflected the scenes of domesticity surrounding her Kilmurry home. Butler's house was a huge source of inspiration throughout her life, its garden and surroundings, provided passion for many of her paintings which often included the surrounding gardens, pasture and countryside. These themes interested her particularly remained a constant subject. She also did genre views of villages and towns on the continent. Butler painted en plein air with instils her work with animated freshness, which she depicts with a degree of realism and expression. Paintings such as Meditation (1889) were considered revolutionary by the art establishment and by critics of the day. The critic of the magazine Hearth and Home described her habit of painting in the open air, rare at the time, and said it give an actuality and a freshness to the painting. Works and exhibitions Butler's principal works have been A Sheltered Corner (1891) R.A., A High Court of Justice (1892) R.A., Green-Eyed Jealousy (1894) R.A., The Morning Bath (1896) R.A., Raiders from the Rookery (1896) R.A., Cead Mile Failte (1898) R.A.. Works that she was elected to the R.W.S. in 1896 include Dull December, Loiterers and Beside the Pond. Sunshine Holiday (1898) R.W.S. was another notable work. Her works appears in a number of collections including Morning Bath in the Tate and paintings in the National Gallery of Ireland, the Ulster Museum in Belfast and the Hugh Lane Gallery in Dublin. A small watercolour of crows hangs in Queen Mary's Dolls' House at Windsor. Throughout her career Butler's works were showcased as far abroad as the United States and Japan. She first exhibited at the Dudley Gallery in Piccadilly. She exhibited in various galleries and institutions including the Royal Hibernian Academy, the Watercolour Society of Ireland, the Belfast Ramblers' Sketching Club, the Royal Academy (1889–1902) and the Royal Watercolour Society. In 1906 she exhibited at the Watercolour Society of Ireland, in Dublin, with works such as The Garden Cart and later that winter in London, at the Old Water-Colour Society where the exhibition included pieces such as Where the Grass Grows Green.

Some were sold in Ireland and others at a studio sale at Christie's in London. The National Gallery of Ireland purchased seven fine watercolours for its permanent collection. Fota House in Cork contains one of her works.

Bornhöhe is generally considered a pioneer of the genre of the Estonian historical novel, as the majority of his creations consist of romanticism-influenced historical adventure stories. thumb  Bibliography  *1880 Tasuja (Estonian for Avenger) : A historical story, set during the time of the St. George's Night Uprising. Widely considered the best story of Bornhöhe. *1890 Villu võitlused (Estonian for Battles of Villu) : Another historical story set during the time of the St. George's Night Uprising.

Due to Czarist censorship, this remained Bornhöhe's last historical story. *1899 Usurändajate radadel (Estonian for On the trail of faith travellers) : A travel diary. *1903 Kollid (Estonian for Monsters) : A realist short novel.  Withdrawal from publication  In 1893, the Russian Empire's censor prohibited publication of historical stories. This led to the eventual withdrawal of Bornhöhe from writing. Notably, he didn't publish any books during the last twenty years of his life.  Soviet views  Since Bornhöhe's preferred topic was Estonia's ancient fight for freedom rather than more complex or more polemical subjects, Soviets generally found his writings useful, and presented them as examples of pre-Soviet patriotism. Vürst Gabriel ehk Pirita kloostri viimased päevad was made into a movie, the first part of Tallinna narrid ja narrikesed was repeatedly published and adapted for TV under Soviet occupation, and Bornhöhe's historical novels were constantly in lists of mandatory reading in Soviet Estonian schools.

It is presented by Romance Writers of America (RWA). The purpose of the RITA Award is to promote excellence in the romance genre by recognizing outstanding published novels and novellas. It is named for the RWA's first president, Rita Clay Estrada. Controversy The RITA Awards, like the English-speaking romance fiction industry as a whole, are overwhelmingly dominated by white authors. This caused controversy in 2018 when Alyssa Cole's An Extraordinary Union, a novel about interracial romance during the American Civil War, made no appearance in the RITA Awards finalists despite winning multiple other awards. Instead, all finalists were about white women, of which all but one fell in love with British aristocrats. In response, the RWA board noted that less than half of 1% of finalists were by black authors, of which none had ever won the award, and expressed a commitment to improve the diversity of the award. The board issued an apology after the 2019 finalists again did not include any persons of color or LGBTQ+ persons. RWA cancelled the 2020 RITA Awards after several contestants and judges withdrew due to diversity concerns.  Procedure  The RITA Award opens for entries in the fall. Entrants must supply five printed books by the posted deadline. Each title is judged by five separate judges during the preliminary round. Finalist are announced in mid-March. Winners are announced at the annual award ceremony, held on the last day of RWA's National Conference, which is normally held in July.

During the subsequent 40 years, he developed a ramified work of drawings, texts, books and concepts of artists' books. From the late 1960s until his death, he continuously exhibited in international galleries. With his series of drawings, he is represented in renowned museums and collections (among them Museum Ludwig, Cologne; Collection Harald Falckenberg, Hamburg). His works are represented by the galleries Michael Werner in Cologne / New York, Marlene Frei in Zurich, Rudolf Springer and Barbara Wien in Berlin and the Edition Armin Hundertmark. The Tomas Schmit Archive is dedicated to his life and work. Career Tomas Schmit has played a considerable role in shaping the radical questioning of civil art and approaches to new aesthetics. It was his correspondence with George Maciunas that made a theoretical discussion on the political and aesthetic concept of the Fluxus period possible. As an artist, he took part in Fluxus events that are nowadays considered milestones in the art of the 1960s. As organiser, he arranged for the legendary event \\"20th July TU Aachen\\" 1964 (with Beuys, Köpcke, Vostell, Paik amongst others). In 1982, in the book 1962 Wiesbaden Fluxus 1982, he wrote the theoretical text \\"about f\\" which represents one of the rare profound evaluations of the ideas of Fluxus from the artist's perspective. Friends and colleagues who he worked with and who appreciated him due to his consequent artistic position and wrote about him, are: Nam June Paik, George Brecht, Arthur Köpcke, Ludwig Gosewitz and Dieter Roth – just to mention a few. It was also Dieter Roth who in 1982 adjudged him the scholarship of the Rembrandt-Prize which had been awarded to him. In 1986, the Kurt-Schwitters-Prize of the City Hanover was awarded to him. Tomas Schmit pulled out of the active Fluxus actions early, as he was against an adulteration of the radical potential. It is also this potential which his probably most important working principle is based on: \\"what I learned from f., along with many other things: what can be mastered by a sculpture, doesn't have to be erected as a building; what can be brought by a painting, doesn't have to be made as a sculpture; what can be accomplished in a drawing, doesn't have to become a painting; what can be cleared on a scrap of paper, doesn't need to be done as a drawing; and what can be settled in the head, doesn't even require a paper scrap!\\". In the following decades, he developed works that comprise several thousand drawings. He published editions and books. His topics are language, logic, paradoxes, biology, cybernetics, cerebral research, behaviour research and apperception theory etc. In 1989, his book \\"first draft (of central aesthetics)\\" provided an introduction to cerebral research, which the cyberneticist Valentin Braitenberg characterized in the following way: > \\"I actually intend to recommend this book when some physicist or whatever > other beginner, as it often happens, will again ask me for an introduction > to cerebral research. I suppose, it took a poet to grasp the charm of the > material access to psychology, including the pleasure in self-critical > accuracy. Consequently, the book is an antipode to what ever so often annoys > you: the belittling of events and concealment of problems that popular > science uses to ingratiate with the people – but, thus, only shows its > disrespect for the audience.\\" His fourth catalogue of works is published recently (published by Buchhandlung Walther König, Cologne), which he, like his already existing works catalogues (1978 Art Society Cologne; 1978 DAAD Berlin / Sprengel Museum Hanover; 1997 Portikus Frankfurt) compiled as artistic self-commentary. A publication that Tomas Schmit prepared in his last year will be released in 2008. It consists of \\"13 conversations\\" (Wiens Verlag, Berlin) which the art historian Wilma Lukatsch held with him. In these 13 conversations, one is introduced to the biographic data and artistic questions of Tomas Schmit with a refreshing sense of linguistic wit, serious and entertaining at the same time. The new aspects of the art of the 60s, the period of the actions, the friendships with the like-minded, the demands and the results of the artistic ideas are discussed and critically questioned. The particular position of drawing and writing that Tomas Schmit settled on is explained in detail. An important aspect, which has so far hardly been considered in secondary literature, is that he developed concepts which are linked to 'drawing actions' while he was drawing. Philosophical questions and also points of contact with literary fields, such as Gertrude Stein and Franz Kafka but also John Cage and Morton Feldman foreshadow the territories Tomas Schmit has dealt with in the area of language and signs. They are: indeterminism, chaos and order, aleatory principle and open form. Altogether, the works of Tomas Schmit comprise more posed questions than given answers. The conversations well reflect this open form, which shows the state of flux of things.  Catalogue Raisonné  * Katalog 1. Koelnischer Kunstverein 1978. * Katalog 2.

The sightings starting in 1947 ignited an obsession with flying saucers that lasted a decade. A flying saucer (also referred to as \\"a flying disc\\") is a descriptive term for a supposed type of flying craft having a disc or saucer-shaped body, commonly used generically to refer to an anomalous flying object. The term was coined in 1947 but has generally been supplanted since 1952 by the United States Air Force term unidentified flying objects (or UFOs for short). Early reported sightings of unknown \\"flying saucers\\" usually described them as silver or metallic, sometimes reported as covered with navigation lights or surrounded with a glowing light, hovering or moving rapidly, either alone or in tight formations with other similar craft, and exhibiting high maneuverability. History While disc-shaped flying objects have been interpreted as being sporadically recorded since the Middle Ages, the first recorded use of the term \\"flying saucer\\" for an unidentified flying object was to describe a probable meteor that fell over Texas and Oklahoma on June 17, 1930. \\"Some who saw the weird light described it as a huge comet, a flaming flying saucer, a great red glow, a ball of fire.\\" The term \\"flying saucer\\" had been in use since 1890 to describe a clay pigeon shooting target, which resembles a classic UFO shape. The highly publicized sighting by Kenneth Arnold on June 24, 1947, resulted in the popularity of the term \\"flying saucer\\" by U.S. newspapers. Although Arnold never specifically used the term \\"flying saucer\\", he was quoted at the time saying the shape of the objects he saw was like a \\"saucer\\", \\"disc\\", or \\"pie-plate\\", and several years later added he had also said \\"the objects moved like saucers skipping across the water.\\" Both the terms flying saucer and flying disc were used commonly and interchangeably in the media until the early 1950s. Arnold's sighting was followed by thousands of similar sightings across the world. Such sightings were once very common, to such an extent that \\"flying saucer\\" was a synonym for UFO through the 1960s before it began to fall out of favor. Many sightings of cigar or dirigible-shaped UFOs were reported following it.Essay: A FRESH LOOK AT FLYING SAUCERS. TIME.

More recently, the flying saucer has been largely supplanted by other alleged UFO-related vehicles, such as the black triangle. In fact, the term UFO was invented in 1952, to try to reflect the wider diversity of shapes being seen. However, unknown saucer-like objects are still reported, such as in the widely publicized 2006 sighting over Chicago-O'Hare airport. Many of the alleged flying saucer photographs of the era are now believed to be hoaxes. The flying saucer is now considered largely an icon of the 1950s and of B movies in particular, and is a popular subject in comic science fiction. Beyond the common usage of the phrase, there have also been man-made saucer-like craft. The first flying disc craft was called the Discopter and was patented by Alexander Weygers in 1944. Other designs have followed, such as the American Vought V-173 / XF5U \\"Flying Flapjack\\", the British GFS Projects flying saucer, or the British \\"S.A.U.C.E.R.\\" (\\"Saucer Aircraft Utilising Coanda Effect Reactions\\") flying saucer, by inventor Alf Beharie.  Sightings  News notice printed in Nuremberg, describing 4 April 1561 Nuremberg mass sighting. Discs and spheres were said to emerge from large cylinders. From Wickiana collection in Zurich. A manuscript illustration of the 10th-century Japanese narrative, The Tale of the Bamboo Cutter, depicts a round flying machine similar to a flying saucer. A record of a saucer-shaped object is from 1290 of a silver disc flying over a village in Yorkshire. Disc-like flying objects were occasionally reported throughout the millennium. For example, in a mass sighting over Nuremberg in 1561, discs and spheres were reported emerging from large cylinders (see woodcut at left). They are also claimed by ufologists to frequently show up in religious artwork. Another well-documented specific comparison of the objects to saucers was the Kenneth Arnold sighting on June 24, 1947, while Arnold was flying near Mount Rainier. He reported seeing 9 brightly reflecting vehicles, one shaped like a crescent but the others more disc- or saucer-shaped, flying in an echelon formation, weaving like the tail of a kite, flipping and flashing in the sun, and traveling with a speed of at least 1,200 miles per hour (1,900 km/h). In addition to the saucer or disc shape (Arnold also used the terms \\"pie plate\\" and half-moon shaped), he also later said he described the motion of the craft as \\"like a saucer if you skip it across water\\", leading to the term \\"flying saucer\\" and also \\"flying disc\\" (which were synonymous for a number of years). Immediately following the report, hundreds of sightings of usually saucer-like objects were reported across the United States and also in some other countries. The most widely publicized of these was the sighting by a United Airlines crew on July 4 of nine more disc-like objects pacing their plane over Idaho, not far from Arnold's initial sighting. On July 8, the Army Air Force base at Roswell, New Mexico issued a press release saying that they had recovered a \\"flying disc\\" from a nearby ranch, the so-called Roswell UFO incident, which was front-page news until the military issued a retraction saying that it was a weather balloon. On July 9, the Army Air Force Directorate of Intelligence, assisted by the FBI, began a secret study of the best of the flying saucer reports, including Arnold's and the United Airlines' crew. Three weeks later they issued an intelligence estimate describing the typical characteristics reported (including that they were often reported as disc-like and metallic) and concluded that something was really flying around. A follow-up investigation by the Air Materiel Command at Wright Field, Ohio arrived at the same conclusion. A widespread official government study of the saucers was urged by General Nathan Twining. This led to the formation of Project Sign (also known as Project Saucer) at the end of 1947, the first public Air Force UFO study. This evolved into Project Grudge (1949–1951) and then Project Blue Book (1952–1970). The term \\"flying saucer\\" quickly became deeply ingrained in the English vernacular. A Gallup poll from August 1947 found that 90% had heard about the mysterious flying saucers or flying discs, and a 1950 Gallup poll found that 94% of those polled had heard the term, easily beating out all other mentioned commonly used terms in the news such as \\"Cold War\\", \\"universal military training\\", and \\"bookie\\".  Explanations  A lenticular cloud. In addition to the extraterrestrial hypothesis, a variety of possible explanations for flying saucers have been put forward. One of the most common states that most photos of saucers were hoaxes; cylindrical metal objects such as pie tins, hubcaps and dustbin lids were easy to obtain, and the poor focus seen in UFO images makes the true scale of the object difficult to ascertain. However, some photos and movies were deemed authentic after intensive study. An example was the saucer-like object photographed by farmer Paul Trent near Portland, Oregon in 1950, which passed all tests when studied by the Condon Committee in the 1960s. Another theory states that most are natural phenomena such as lenticular clouds and balloons, which appear disc-like in some lighting conditions. A third theory puts all saucer sightings down to a form of mass hysteria. Arnold described the craft he saw as saucer-like but not perfectly round (he described them as thin, flat, rounded in front but chopped in back and coming to a point), but the image of the circular saucer was fixed in the public consciousness. The theory posits that as the use of the term flying saucer in popular culture decreased, so too did sightings. One of the first depictions of a \\"flying saucer\\", by illustrator Frank R. Paul on the October 1929 issue of Hugo Gernsback's pulp science fiction magazine Science Wonder Stories. Although the term wasn't used before 1947, fantasy artwork in pulp magazines prepared the American mind to be receptive to the idea of \\"flying saucers\\". Long before the Kenneth Arnold sighting of 1947 and the adoption of the term \\"flying saucer\\" by the public, depictions of streamlined saucer-shaped aircraft or spacecraft had appeared in the popular press, dating back to at least 1911. In particular, commentators like Milton Rothman have noted the appearance of the \\"flying saucers\\" concept in the fantasy artwork of the 1930s pulp science fiction magazines, by artists like Frank R. Paul. Frank Wu, a notable contemporary science fiction illustrator, has written: > The point is that the idea of space vehicles shaped like flying saucers was > imprinted in the national psyche for many years prior to 1947, when the > Roswell incident took place. It didn't take much stretching for the first > observers of UFOs to assume that the unknown objects hovering in the sky had > the same disk shape as the science fictional vehicles. A scientific and statistical analysis of 3200 Air Force UFO cases by the Battelle Memorial Institute from 1952 to 1954 found that most were indeed due to natural phenomena, about 2% were due to hoaxes or psychological effects and only 0.4% were thought due to clouds. Other very minor contributors were birds, light phenomena such as mirages or searchlights, and various miscellany such as flares or kites. The vast majority of identified objects (about 84%) were explained as balloons, aircraft, or astronomical objects. However, about 22% of all sightings still defied any plausible explanation by the team of scientists, and percentage of unidentifieds rose to 33% for the best witnesses and cases. Thus when carefully studied, a substantial fraction of reports (given the available data) is currently not understood.  Fata Morgana (mirages) and flying saucers  Fata Morgana of distant islands distorted images beyond recognition Fata Morgana, a type of mirage, may be responsible for some flying saucers sightings, by displaying objects located below the astronomical horizon hovering in the sky, and magnifying and distorting them. Similarly some unidentifieds seen on radar might also be due to Fata Morgana- type atmospheric phenomena, though more technically known as \\"anomalous propagation\\" and more commonly as \\"radar ghosts\\". Official UFO investigations in France suggest: Fata Morgana was named as a hypothesis for the mysterious Australian phenomenon Min Min light.  Man-made flying saucer aircraft  The Avrocar, a one-man flying saucer style aircraft The first documented patent for a lenticular flying machine was submitted by Romanian inventor Henri Coanda. He made a functional small scale model which was flown in 1932 and a patent was granted in 1935. In 1967, Coanda told a symposium organized by the Romanian Academy: Other attempts have been made, with limited success, to produce manned vehicles based on the flying saucer design. While some, such as the Avrocar and M200G Volantor have been produced in limited numbers, most fail to leave the drawing board. The Avrocar, with vertical takeoff and landing, was originally intended to replace both the Jeep and the helicopter in combat situations, but proved to be inadequate for both. In spite of a powerful turbojet, it could not rise more than four or five feet off the ground, i.e., out of ground effect. Thus, the Avrocar could be seen as a prototype for the early generations of hovercraft, lacking only a 'skirt' to make it a truly effective example of the type. Unmanned saucers have had more success; the Sikorsky Cypher is a saucer-like UAV which uses the disc-shaped shroud to protect rotor blades. Some more advanced flying saucers capable of spaceflight have been proposed, often as black projects by aeronautics companies. The Lenticular Reentry Vehicle was a secret project run by Convair for a saucer device which could carry both astronauts and nuclear weapons into orbit; the nuclear-powered system was planned in depth, but is not believed to have ever flown. More exotically, British Rail worked on plans for the British Rail \\"Space Vehicle\\" a proposed, saucer-shaped craft based on so far undiscovered technologies such as nuclear fusion and superconductivity, which was supposed to have been able to transport multiple passenger between planets, but never went beyond the patent stage. There is at least one design that received a US patent in 2005: It claims to be \\"propelled by the pressure of inflationary vacuum state\\". Additionally, a professor at the University of Florida has begun work on a Wingless Electromagnetic Air Vehicle (WEAV) for NASA which has received public interest because of its coincidental resemblance to a flying saucer.  In popular culture  A small flying saucer leaves its larger mothership in Plan 9 from Outer Space (1959). After 1947, the flying saucer quickly became a stereotypical symbol of both extraterrestrials and science fiction, and features in many films of mid-20th century science fiction, including The Atomic Submarine (1959), The Day the Earth Stood Still (1951), Plan 9 from Outer Space (1959), Earth vs. the Flying Saucers (1956), as well as the television series The Invaders. As the flying saucer was surpassed by other designs and concepts, it fell out of favor with straight science-fiction moviemakers, but continued to be used ironically in comedy movies, especially in reference to the low-budget B movies which often featured saucer-shaped alien craft. However, Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer gave its high production value film Forbidden Planet (1956) a flying saucer called the United Planets Cruiser C-57D, presenting a plausible human exploration, faster-than-light starship of the 23rd century. In the television series Lost in Space (1965-1968), the Robinson family had a disc-shaped spaceship. Saucers appeared in the television series Babylon 5 (1994-1998) as the standard ship design used by a race called the Vree. Aliens in the film Independence Day (1996) attacked humanity in giant city-sized saucer-shaped spaceships. The sleek, silver flying saucer in particular is seen as a symbol of 1950s culture; the motif is common in Googie architecture and in Atomic Age décor. The image is often invoked retrofuturistically to produce a nostalgic feel in period works, especially in comic science fiction; both Mars Attacks! (1996) and Destroy All Humans! draw on the flying saucer as part of the larger satire of 1950s B movie tropes. The Twilight Zone episodes \\"The Monsters Are Due on Maple Street\\", \\"Third from the Sun\\", \\"Death Ship\\", \\"To Serve Man\\", \\"The Invaders\\" and \\"On Thursday We Leave for Home\\" all make use of the iconic saucer from Forbidden Planet.

The organization's banner leads from a verse in the Quran: \\"And those who do jihad for Us, we shall guide them to our paths. And God is with those who do good.\\"Qur'an Soorah al-Ankaboot 29:69 وَالَّذِينَ جَاهَدُوا فِينَا لَنَهْدِيَنَّهُمْ سُبُلَنَا ۚ وَإِنَّ اللَّهَ لَمَعَ الْمُحْسِنِينَ(Arabic text) Ramadan Abdullah Mohammad Shallah is wanted by the FBI for conspiracy to conduct the affairs of the designated international terrorist organization known as the \\"Palestinian Islamic Jihad\\". PIJ was formally established in Gaza in 1981 by two Palestinian activists: Dr Fathi abd al-Aziz Shaqaqi, a Rafah-based physician, and Shaykh Abd al-Aziz Awda, an Islamic preacher from the Jabaliyya refugee camp, as well as Ramadan Shalah, Bashir Moussa and three other Palestinian radicals. Based in Egypt, Shaqaqi and Awda were originally members of the Muslim Brotherhood. Their views on the destruction of Israel, however, led them in 1979 to establish Islamic Jihad-Shaqaqi Faction, a branch of the Egyptian Islamic Jihad. and conducted operations out of Egypt. The Shaqaqi Faction was expelled from Egypt in 1981 following the assassination of Egypt's President Anwar Sadat by the Egyptian Islamic Jihad. Shaqaqi and Awda returned to Gaza where they formally established PIJ,STATEMENT OF CASE TO DESIGNATE PALESTINIAN ISLAMIC JIHAD (PIJ) AS A TERRORIST ENTITY , New Zealand, October 2000 from where it continued its operations. The aim of the organization was the establishment of a sovereign, Islamic Palestinian state within the geographic borders of pre-1948 Mandatory Palestine. Completely rejecting the political process, the organization professes that its goals can only be achieved through military means. PIJ began its armed operations against Israel in 1984. In 1988, its leaders were exiled by Israel to Lebanon. While in Lebanon, the group received training, support and other backing from Hezbollah and its backers in Iran, and developed a close relationship with the organization. In 1990, the headquarters of PIJ moved to the Syrian capital, Damascus, where it continues to be based, with offices in Beirut, Tehran, and Khartoum. PIJ masterminded several suicide bombings in Israel, the first one being the Tel Aviv–Jerusalem bus 405 suicide attack in 1989 which resulted in 16 civilian deaths. (See List of Palestinian suicide attacks.) Shaqaqi was a key player in setting up the Alliance of Palestinian Forces in January 1994, a coalition of eight PLO groups, Islamic Jihad and Hamas, rejecting the Oslo process. PIJ was and continues to be considered by Israel the most extreme organization in its operational methods and commitment to the destruction of Israel. By 1995 PIJ was, according to Fisk, \\"perhaps the fiercest of all Israel's modern-day enemies.\\" Shaqaqi was assassinated in 1995 in Malta, and Ramadan Shalah became secretary-general of the organisation. There was a subsequent crackdown on the PIJ by Israel and the Palestinian National Authority which led to a significant weakening of the organization. On 20 February 2003, University of South Florida computer engineering professor Sami Al-Arian was arrested after being indicted on a terrorism-related charge. U.S. Attorney General John Ashcroft alleged at a press conference that Al-Arian was the North American head of the Palestinian Islamic Jihad. On 6 December 2006, Sami Al-Arian was sentenced to 57 months in prison, pursuant to a plea bargain.St. Petersberg Times, 23 April 2006. In November 2006 he was found guilty of civil contempt for refusing to testify before a federal grand jury and served 21 months in prison on that conviction. On 27 June 2014, the US Federal Government dropped all charges against Al-Arian. PIJ is alleged to have used minors. On 29 March 2004, 15-year-old Tamer Khuweir of Rifidia, a suburb of Palestinian city Nablus in the West Bank, was captured by Israeli forces as he planned to carry out a suicide mission. His older brother claimed he was brainwashed and demanded the Palestinian Authority investigate the incident and arrest those responsible for it. Following further terrorist attacks on civilians in Israel, Shalah and Awda were indicted under United States law and added in 2006 to the United States FBI Most Wanted Terrorists list. In February 2012, the Hamas government in the Gaza Strip distanced itself from PIJ. During the March 2012 Gaza–Israel clashes, which followed the Israeli assassination of Popular Resistance Committees leader, Zuhir al-Qaisi, who bragged of kidnapping Gilad Shalit, PIJ and PRC opened attacks on Israel. Hamas refrained from joining PIJ and PRC in attacking Israel. Over a hundred Palestinians were killed or injured in the ensuing violence, but Israel did not attack any Hamas targets at the time. The eventual ceasefire was negotiated between Israel and the militant groups, not Hamas. London-based Arabic newspaper Asharq al-Awsat reported in May 2015 that Iran had stopped funding PIJ due to the group's neutrality over the Saudi Arabian-led intervention in Yemen, throwing PIJ into a severe financial crisis. Iran had expected PIJ to condemn the intervention led by Saudi Arabia, Iran's chief regional rival. Palestinian newspaper al- Quds reported that Iran is now supporting an offshoot of PIJ called as-Sabirin (Arabic for \\"the patient ones\\"), headed by Islamic Jihad veteran Hisham Salem. Under the former leadership of Ramadan Shalah, the group would receive approximately US$70 million per year from the Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps of Iran.Eldar, Shlomi.

The organization is responsible for a number of attacks including more than 30 suicide bombings; indeed, on 22 December 2001, PIJ vowed to continue its campaign despite Hamas' decision to halt suicide bombings inside Israel in response to an alleged crackdown by Yasser Arafat. PIJ's representative in Lebanon, Abu Imad Al-Rifai noted, \\"Our position is to continue. We have no other choice.

How a Continuity Program Works A consumer can join a plan simply by accepting an introductory offer of merchandise or services. Continuity plans may offer an introductory “free trial period” to let potential consumers check out the merchandise or service and decide whether to join the plan. If a consumer decides to keep the merchandise beyond the free trial period or fail to cancel the service within the free trial period, not only they must pay, but they automatically become a plan member. Some continuity plans give customers an “approval” period. That way, customers can check out the merchandise and decide whether to keep it and pay for it. Many programs selling collectibles, like stamps or coins, work this way. Other continuity plans require people to pay for merchandise when they receive it.Continuity Facts from the FTC Joining a continuity plan means the consumer agrees to the plan’s sales method as long as they are members. They’ll automatically get periodic shipments of merchandise or delivery of services. Consumers won’t get any announcements or rejection forms before each shipment or service period. The shipments or services continue until consumers cancel their membership. Continuity Program Obligatory Terms and Conditions Sellers must give customers information about the plan’s terms and conditions, clearly and conspicuously, in their promotional materials. These terms may include: *that you become a member if you accept the introductory merchandise or initial round of services — unless you cancel; *that periodic delivery of merchandise or services will occur — with no further action on your part; *a description of the merchandise or services you agree to buy; *whether there’s a minimum purchase; *how often you’ll receive the products or services; *an explanation of the plan’s billing procedure for each shipment or period of service. *how much time you have to review “on approval” merchandise before you have to pay; *the terms of the plan’s refund or return policy; *how and when consumers can cancel their membership; *the price of the goods or services if a consumer fails to cancel, including shipping and handling, if applicable. Usually a plan will use the same billing method for future shipments that it used for the introductory merchandise or service period. Federal Trade Commission (FTC) message to consumers The Federal Trade Commission (FTC) advises that before consumers agree to any plan: *Read the terms and conditions of the plan carefully so you understand the obligations of membership before you join. *Keep copies of plan documentation that explain the terms and conditions of the plan. Some plans may send you this information with the introductory shipment. *If an offer is made over the phone, listen carefully and, if you don’t understand the terms, ask the seller to repeat them. Write down important information, such as the customer service telephone number or address. Don’t give in to high-pressure sales tactics; if you don’t want the offer, feel comfortable hanging up. *Check out the seller. Contact your local consumer protection agency or the Better Business Bureau to find out if they have any complaints on file. A record of complaints may indicate questionable practices, but a lack of complaints doesn’t necessarily mean that the seller doesn’t have problems. Unscrupulous businesses or business people often change names and locations to hide complaint histories.

Kerrigan as Chief Verger Tope *Walter Brennan as Milk Man *Harry Cording as Turke (uncredited) Style In the book Universal Horrors, the authors described the film as \\"neither an all-out horror story nor a puzzling whodunnit\\" stating the film would be easier placed in contemporary terms as \\"a quaintly charming and atmospheric Victorian melodrama\\" and lacking in real suspense. Production Universal Pictures Corp. was enthusiastic about adapting The Mystery of Edwin Drood and exploiting its lack of finale and gave the film high productions values of $215,375 and developed an aggressive advertising campaign to exploit the novel's unresolved ending. According to Universal publicity papers, Universal's London office shot thousands of feet of film and took numerous till shots of Victorian-style structures in the Rochester in 1934 for the film. A large set was built in Universal's back lot and was their largest set built for Universal since The Hunchback of Notre Dame. The films shooting was delayed initially due to casting difficulties, and production began on the film on November 12, 1934 and continued until January 1935. Among the cast was David Manners as Edwin Drood. It was Manners last film. Manners later spoke later in life that he \\"didn't like movies. You see, in a play you become the play, because you start in the beginning and end up at the end of the script. Movies, you do little bits and you don't know where it fits in.... It has no unity.\\" When asked about Mystery of Edwin Drood, Manners responded that \\"it was not a good movie at all.\\" Release The Mystery of Edwin Drood was distributed by Universal Pictures Corp. on February 4, 1935. Reception In the book Universal Horrors, the authors described contemporary critical reception as winning \\"the approval of most film critics of the time.\\" William Boehnel of The New York World-Telegram declared the film \\"a thoroughly entertaining, exciting and atmospherically fine screen version of the novel.\\" Eileen Creelman of the New York Sun declared it \\"a gruesome melodrama with enough action and background mystery to make it go.\\" Bland Johaneson of the New York Daily Mirror declared the film \\"handsomely produced and acted\\" and that it would hold audiences in \\"complete interest\\". Andre Sennwald of The New York Times declared that the films \\"combination of adroit direction and acting isn't strong enough to overcome an essentially weak narrative.\\" In the United Kingdom, Kinematograph Weekly said that \\"idividual acting is very good and the atmosphere is faitful in detail, but neither can invest the story development with strong suspense nor preserve its secret\\" concluding that \\"there is no denying that Claude Rains is a brilliant actor, this does not prevent his mannerisms and inflections from becoming a trifle monotonous.\\" From retrospective reviews, Craig Butler of AllMovie stated that \\"the film's screenplay, which is too often predictable and too seldom surprising.\\" and that Stuart Walker had directed the film \\"efficiently and with a touch of flair here and there; it's not outstanding work\\". Butler concluded that \\"where Drood shines is in its cast, led by a typically marvelous Claude Rains, who conveys the lust, shame, desperation, and determination of his character with aplomb. Douglass Montgomery is quite good in a dual role, and Heather Angel is appropriately lovely and timid. E.E. Clive and Zeffie Tilbury also are impressive in supporting roles\\" while concluding that the film \\"may not be a great film, but the actors make it decent entertainment.\\" References Footnotes Sources   External links   Category:1935 films Category:American films Category:American historical films Category:American black-and-white films Category:English-language films Category:Films directed by Stuart Walker Category:Melodramas Category:Universal Pictures films Category:1930s historical films Category:Films based on works by Charles Dickens Category:Films set in the 19th century ","title":"The Mystery of Edwin Drood (1935 film)"},{"id":"13093320","text":"Route 371 is a provincial highway located in the Capitale-Nationale region in south-central Quebec.

Ammonusuc was laid down under a Maritime Commission contract (MC hull 1520) on 23 November 1943 at Bayonne, New Jersey, by the East Coast Shipyard, Inc.; launched on 25 March 1944; sponsored by Miss Helen T. Clark; acquired by the Navy on a loan charter basis on 18 May 1944; and commissioned on 19 May 1944, Lt. (jg.) Lester F. Baker, USCG, in command.  World War II service  The new gasoline tanker was fitted out at the New York Navy Yard, Brooklyn, New York, and sailed on 11 August for Norfolk, Virginia, where she underwent a period of availability. The vessel returned to New York City on 5 September to take on a cargo of aviation gasoline and diesel oil and got underway in a convoy bound for Guantanamo Bay, Cuba. The ships weathered a hurricane before reaching Cuban waters safely on 17 September. Four days later, the tanker headed for the Panama Canal Zone; and she reached Coco Solo on the 25th. After discharging her cargo, she transited the Panama Canal and reported for duty to Squadron 8, Service Force, Pacific Fleet. She sailed for San Diego, California, and arrived at that port on 12 October. After minor voyage repairs, the tanker shaped a course for Hawaii.  Pacific Ocean operations  Ammonusuc arrived at Pearl Harbor on 6 November and, shortly thereafter, made a voyage to Johnston Island to carry several thousand barrels of aviation gasoline to facilities ashore there. She unloaded the cargo at Johnston Island and then returned to Hawaii in December. On the last day of 1944, the tanker sailed in a convoy for the Mariana Islands. Following stops at Kwajalein and Eniwetok, the tanker reached Saipan on 11 February 1945. During the next seven months, she shuttled between Saipan and Iwo Jima delivering fuel oil and aviation gasoline in support of U.S. Army Air Force operations on that island.  Post- war activity  Following the end of the fighting in mid-August, Ammonusuc carried medical supplies and other stores to working parties at Chichi Jima. She arrived back at Saipan on 8 January 1946. After repair work, she got underway for the west coast of the United States and reached San Francisco, California, on 8 March. The vessel then entered the shipyard at Colbert Boat Works, Stockton, California, for further repairs. Upon the completion of dock trials, she departed San Francisco Bay on 17 April in a convoy bound for the Panama Canal Zone. Ammonusuc arrived at Balboa on 5 May, retransited the Panama Canal, and steamed independently toward New Orleans, Louisiana. She reached that port on 14 May and transferred her ammunition and stores ashore to the naval ammunition depot.  Decommissioning  After a period of final preparations, Ammonusuc was decommissioned at New Orleans on 4 June 1946, and her name was struck from the Navy list on 23 April 1947. The ship was transferred to the Maritime Commission on 9 March 1948, was sold later that same year, and was refitted for service as a merchant vessel. Final disposition: fate unknown.

Its boundaries are ill-defined, but most definitions include the area between 27th Street to the north, San Pablo Avenue to the west, City Center to the south, and Harrison St to the east. The neighborhood has become an important entertainment district in recent years.http://www.bizjournals.com/sanfrancisco/print-edition/2011/11/25/moving- ahead-in-oakland-post-occupy.html History The area near 20th Street and Broadway had been Oakland's main shopping district in the mid-20th century. Several buildings from that era remain, including the former H.C. Capwell department store, which later became Sears and is currently being developed into a mixed-use retail and office building called \\"Uptown Station;\\" the I. Magnin department store; the Paramount Theater; and the Fox Oakland Theatre. The Payless Drug Store and Market located at Telegraph Ave. and 20th St, housed the drug store small produce markets and seafood sellers. It included a SAAG's sausage counter and even a USO branch. This structure was demolished in the early 1960s to construct a parking structure for Capwell's Department store. The area was home to one of the original Kwik Way hamburger outlets and also at Broadway and Grand Ave the Oakland branch of Breuners furniture. West of Telegraph Avenue, the neighborhood was for many years largely made up of parking lots and garages. The area has gone through several failed urban renewal projects and proposals, including proposals for a shopping mall, an entertainment district, high-rise housing, and a professional baseball stadium. The area now contains several attractive high-rise apartment buildings. Development During Jerry Brown's time as Mayor (1999-2007) The Uptown District was deemed the Entertainment center of the city. Redevelopment has taken place by large upscale apartments and restaurants, bringing some much needed money and foot traffic into the area. The centerpiece has been the city government's 10K program, an effort to bring 10,000 additional residents to the downtown area. The largest of the new apartment complexes is a five- story, three-building apartment complex called \\"The Uptown\\" built by Forest City Enterprises, including a new dog-friendly park called Fox Square. A new surface street, Rashida Muhammad Street, was named after the late community activist who died of lung cancer in 2006. Alice Walker immortalized Rashida Muhammad's (aka Dessie X. Woods) story in her collection of essays Living by the Word. The street was built with the stated goal of The Uptown project of enhancing and building a new community in the area. This complex also features the \\"Remember Them\\" sculpture by Mario Chiodo, a local artist. The sculpture, when it is complete, will be one of the largest bronze sculptures in the United States.Carolyn Jones. \\"Oakland to honor 25 leaders in huge sculpture\\". San Francisco Chronicle. January 2, 2010. The 25 humanitarians honored in this sculpture include Oskar Schindler, Maya Angelou, Ruby Bridges, Cesar Chavez, Thich Nhat Hanh, and Mother Teresa. Numerous bars and restaurants have opened between 16th Street and Grand Avenue. Retail continues to add to the landscape of the Uptown District. In addition to becoming a nightlife destination for East Bay residents, the area has developed well culturally overall. The area now includes many cafes, bakeries, and galleries, as well as being a central hub for the other bars and restaurants located in the surrounding neighborhoods.

He was one of those responsible for the withdrawal from Britannia. Life In 407, the Roman army in Britain chose as their leader Flavius Claudius Constantinus. He crossed the Channel to the continent, and by May 408 had made Arles his capital, where he appointed Apollinaris, grandfather of Sidonius Apollinaris, as prefect.Jones, Arnold Hugh Martin, John Robert Martindale, John Morris, The Prosopography of the Later Roman Empire, vol. 2, Cambridge University Press, 1992, , p. 113 Decimus Rusticus succeeded his friend Apollinaris, as praetorian prefect of Gaul in 409. He was captured by the army commanders of Emperor Honorius and put to death. About him, Sidonius Apollinaris to his friend Aquilinus: > I find it certainly to my advantage, friend capable of every virtue, and I > trust you will feel the same, that we should have as many ties to bind us as > we have reasons for being united. Such ties are hereditary in our families; > I do but recall the experience of the past. Let me summon as my witnesses > our grandfathers Rusticus and Apollinaris, whom like fortunes and aversions > united in a noble friendship. They had a similar taste in letters, their > characters were alike; they had enjoyed similar dignities and undergone the > same dangers. They were equally agreed in detesting the inconstancy of > Constantine, the irresolution of Jovinus, the perfidy of Gerontius; both > singling out the fault proper to each person, and both finding in Dardanus > the sum of all existing vices. If we come down to the years between their > time and our own, we find our fathers brought up together from their tender > youth until they came to manhood. In Honorius' reign, as tribunes and > secretaries, they served abroad together in such close comradeship that > among all the grounds of their agreement the fact that their own fathers had > been friends appeared to be the least. Under Valentinian, one of the two > ruled all Gaul, the other only a region of it; even so they managed to > balance their dignities with a fraternal equilibrium; the one who held the > lower rank had seniority in office.

But there are ties of all kinds, over and above that of this > hereditary friendship, which needs must bring us close together; we are > linked by equality of years no less than by identity of birthplace; we > played and learned together, shared the same discipline and relaxation, and > were trained by the same rule. So then, for what remains of life now that > our years touch upon the threshold of age, let us under the providence of > God be two persons with but a single mind; and let us instil into our sons > the same mutual regard: let us see that the objects which they desire and > refuse, pursue or shun, are the same.

It was constructed on the orders of King Alfonso III of Aragon \\"the Liberal\\", the conqueror of the island, in 1287 on the site of an old mosque.Phil Lee The Rough Guide to Menorca 2004 p66 \\"The king had a political point to make too - he built his cathedral, a gigantic affair of golden sandstone, bang on top of the Great Mosque inside the Almudaina, the old Moorish citadel. The Reconquista was to be no temporary matter.\\" History Construction started in 1300 and was finished in 1362, creating a building of the Catalan Gothic style, and is notable for the width of the nave, flanked by six chapels to each side. The five-sided apse is oriented to the east. After the desecration and devastation of the cathedral by the Ottoman Empire Turks under Admiral of the Ottoman Fleet Pialí Bajá in 1558 and the collapse of the vaults of the apse in 1626, the damage was quickly repaired in the original style. In 1795, with the restoration of the old bishopric of Menorca (which had existed at start of the 5th century) the parish church of Ciutadella came to be the cathedral of the new diocese. Under Bishop Juano, the main façade was rebuilt in 1813 in a neoclassical style, contrasting with the Gothic style of the building, while the restored side door called the Porta de la Llum (\\"Portal of the Light\\") keeps some of its medieval ornamentation. In the interior, the baroque chapel of the Angelus dates from the start of the 17th century with exquisitely-carved columns. The cathedral was sacked and desecrated in the first days of the Spanish Civil War in 1936, but was restored in its current form by Bishop Bartolomé Pascual between 1939 and 1941. During this work, the Quire was moved from the nave to its current location in the apse. Interior Apse The great altar is a marble monolith covered by a 15-metre- high canopy. At the back of the apse, under an image of the Virgin in the mystery of the presentation of Jesus in the temple, is found the episcopal throne, made with Roman marble blessed by Pope Pius XII to signify the links of faith and devotion of this church of Menorca to St. Peter's Basilica. In 1953 Pope Pius XII gave the cathedral the title of minor basilica. From 1987, the seventh centennial of the conquest of Menorca by the Crown of Aragon, a new plan was undertaken for the restoration and development of the cathedral.

The term was used by dramatists in Italy and elsewhere between the mid-17th and mid-19th centuries. In modern times the same meaning of drama for music was conveyed through the Italian Greek-rooted word melodramma (from μέλος = song or music + δρᾶμα = scenic action). Dramma per musica never meant \\"drama through music\\", let alone music drama. A dramma per musica was thus originally (in Italy in the 17th century) a verse drama specifically written for the purpose of being set to music, in other words a libretto for an opera, usually a serious opera (a libretto meant for opera buffa, i.e. comic opera, would have been called a dramma giocoso). By extension, the term came to be used also for the opera or operas which were composed to the libretto, and a variation, dramma in musica, which emphasised the musical element, was sometimes preferred by composers. In the 18th century, these terms, along with dramma musicale, came to be the most commonly used descriptions for serious Italian operas. Today, these are known as opera seria, a term that was little-used when they were created. The terms continued to be used in the early 19th century after Gluck's reforms had effectively ended the dominance of opera seria: for example, some of Rossini's later serious operas were designated \\"dramma in musica\\". Examples of drammi per musica are Cavalli's Xerse (1654), Erismena (1656), Vivaldi's Tito Manlio (1719), Mysliveček's Il Bellerofonte (1767), Gluck's Paride ed Elena (1770), Salieri's Armida (1779), Mozart's Idomeneo (1781) and Rossini's Otello (1816), as well as numerous libretti written by Pietro Metastasio.

The film is a semi-fictional account of the Batalhão de Operações Policiais Especiais (BOPE), the Special Police Operations Battalion of the Rio de Janeiro Military Police, analogous to the American SWAT teams. It is the second feature film and first fiction film of Padilha, who had previously directed the documentary Bus 174. The script was written by Bráulio Mantovani (City of God) and Padilha, based on the book Elite da Tropa by sociologist Luiz Eduardo Soares and two former BOPE captains, André Batista and Rodrigo Pimentel. Elite Squad was an overwhelming critical and commercial success and became a cultural phenomenon in Brazil. The film won the Golden Bear at the 2008 Berlin Film Festival. Its sequel, Elite Squad: The Enemy Within, released in Brazil on October 8, 2010, holds industry records in the country for ticket sales and gross revenue. Plot The film opens with a narration by BOPE Captain Nascimento (Wagner Moura) explaining the illegal liasons between Rio de Janeiro's police force and the city's drug lords. In 1997, novice police officers André Matias (André Ramiro) and Neto Gouveia (Caio Junqueira) use a sniper rifle telescope to watch officer Captain Oliveira (Marcelo Valle) and other policemen meet drug traffickers at Morro da Babilônia. Neto accidentally pulls the trigger, which causes a deadly gunfight between the officers and thugs; as Mathias and Neto flee the scene, Nascimento and his men head to the shootout to rescue the officers. Six months earlier, Nascimento and his wife Rosane (Maria Ribeiro) are pregnant with their first child. Unwilling to be an absent father, Nascimento begins searching for a worthy successor, which coincides with an operation to secure the location for Pope John Paul II's overnight visit at the Archbishop's home near the slum buildings at Morro do Turano. Meanwhile, long-time friends Neto and Matias share an apartment in Rio and have just completed the admission tests to the PMERJ: Neto begins working as a supervisor at the police auto mechanic shop, whilst Matias is responsible for registering and filing every police complaint in a small archive office. Matias also attends Law school, where he befriends classmates Roberta (Fernanda de Freitas), Edu (Paulo Viela) and Maria (Fernanda Machado); all three are members of a NGO sponsored by a senator and operating in a drug traffic area run by a major drug lord nicknamed \\"Baiano\\" (Fábio Lago). He also befriends Romerito, a local boy who suffers from severe myopia. Neto eventually applies to another department, but his transfer is denied. Upon learning of the corruption practices carried on by police officers in a routine patrol with Captain Fabio (Milhem Cortaz), he asks Matias to help stealing the payoff money to fix as many police cars as possible at once. Their plan is successful, but Oliveira finds out about their involvement and demotes both to kitchen work as punishment. Under the impression the plan was devised by Fabio, Oliveira sets him up to attend a false police report at Morro da Babilônia during a community funk party, which Fabio realizes as a set-up. He warns Neto and Matias, who rush to the location and arrive at the vantage point from the first scene. Meanwhile, during an operation to retrieve the body of a teenage boy who was killed by drug lords, Nascimento is informed of the situation at Babilônia and is ordered to intervene. Nascimento rescues Matias and Neto after the shootout, during which Matias is photographed by the press. Soon after, Neto and Matias, motivated by their devotion to the force and eagerness for more action, apply for BOPE's training program. At the NGO office, Baiano confronts Maria and her friends with a newspaper featuring Matias's picture and threatens to kill them if they let policemen inside his territory. The BOPE's training program proves to be a gruesome challenge as many candidates quit the program, including Fabio (who applied as a way to avoid Oliveira), but both Neto and Matias successfully pass the course, which Neto celebrates by having a BOPE tattoo on his arm. In college, Matias is rejected by Maria and her friends, but confronts Edu and orders him to arrange a meeting with Romerito the next day to give him a new pair of glasses. Edu reveals Matias' plan to Baiano, who sets an ambush to kill him; however, upon returning home, Neto informs Matias of a job interview in a prestigious law firm that will conflict with his meeting with Romerito and volunteers to deliver the glasses to the boy in his place: this results in Neto being mortally wounded. When Baiano prepares to execute him, he notices the BOPE tattoo, realizes he has killed a BOPE officer and goes into hiding. After Neto's funeral, Matias, Nascimento and his men make daily incursions into Baiano's slum, torturing several dealers into revealing his whereabouts. After one of them reveals Edu tipped Baiano, Matias storms in a peace walk, violently beats Edu and insults Maria and the others. The BOPE team finally locate and corner Baiano: Nascimento holds him at gunpoint, but the drug lord pleads to not to be shot in the face as it would ruin his funeral. Angrily amused at Baiano's suffering, Nascimento grabs a .120 shotgun, hands it to Matias and orders him to \\"finish him off\\" as both a vendetta for Neto's death and as a final rite of passage for himself. As Baiano pleads and cries, Matias cocks the gun and the screen cuts to black as a shot is heard.

The book was controversial at the time of release, in its description of the BOPE as a \\"killing machine\\", as well as the detailed allegation of an aborted assassination attempt on then left-wing governor of Rio de Janeiro, Leonel Brizola, and reportedly resulted in Batista being reprimanded and censured by the Military Police. The writing contained some discrepancies, however Soares did not retract his novel.Monken, Mario Hugo. Livro sobre elite da PM do Rio causou punição, diz autor. Folha de S.Paulo. April 29, 2006. Retrieved on September 5, 2007. The novel had a unique reception when it was translated in 2010. There were many fans of the original novel and film who felt that the Portuguese-English translation was poor and did not follow the film and vice versa. Ultimately the novel (before translation) was more like the film than the novel in English. Production leak In August 2007, prior to the movie's release to theaters, a preliminary cut of the film was leaked and made available for download on the Internet. The cut, which included English title cards but no subtitles, was leaked from the company responsible for subtitling the film, resulting in one person being fired and a criminal investigation. It was estimated that about 11.5 million people had seen the leaked version of the movie in 2007. Reception Popularity and box office Elite Squad became one of the most popular Brazilian movies in history. According to Datafolha, 77% of São Paulo residents knew about the movie. The word of mouth was also important for the disclosure of the film, with 80% of the people rating the movie as \\"excellent\\" or \\"good\\", according to the same poll. The movie was released in Rio de Janeiro and São Paulo on October 5, 2007 (with the intention of being considered by the Ministry of Culture to compete as the Brazilian entry for the Best Foreign Language Film Oscar). It was released nationwide on October 12, 2007. By January 2008, 2.5 million people had seen it in theaters. In Rio and São Paulo, with no promotion other than billboards, 180,000 people saw the movie during its opening weekend. The movie was also the cover issue for the two Brazil's most important weekly magazines, Veja and Época. In the beginning of 2008 it was confirmed that Rede Globo would produce a TV series based on the movie. In 2011 Rockstar Games recommended Elite Squad to fans of its video game Max Payne 3, which is set in Brazil and depicts battles between special police units and favela gangs. Outside Brazil reviews of the film were initially mixed, but after time the film was received more positively. Based on 34 reviews, the film received a 53% approval rating on Rotten Tomatoes, with its critics' consensus calling it a \\"brutal, action-heavy Brazilian cop film with a pointless voiceover. Lacks flair, overdoes the violence and is never quite sure where its morals lie\\". Criticism When the first version of the film leaked, it caused a major controversy for its portrayal of Captain Nascimento's unpunished police brutality in slums (favelas); some saw it as glamourizing police violence. After its exhibition in Berlin Film Festival, critic Jay Weissberg, in a Variety article, called the movie \\"a one-note celebration of violence-for-good that plays like a recruitment film for fascist thugs\\".Weissberg, Jay. \\"The Elite Squad Review\\", Variety, February 11, 2008. Accessed May 8, 2009. Michel Misse, a researcher of urban violence in the Federal University of Rio de Janeiro, in an article by Carta Capital, tried to explain why some people cheered at Captain Nascimento's actions: \\"as the judiciary system cannot keep up with the demand for punishment, some may think civil rights leads to unpunishment. And then, they want illegal solutions. That's why Captain Nascimento is called\\".Sousa, Ana Paula. \\"Herói torturador\\", CartaCapital. Accessed May 8, 2009. Awards On February 16, 2008, Elite Squad won the Best Movie award of the Berlin International Film Festival, the Golden Bear. Soundtrack The soundtrack of the film was a collection of popular hits, but even the soundtrack would not escape controversy as the Brazilian authorities demanded the removal of MC Leonardo's \\"Rap das Armas\\" from the film, because of alleged promotion of violence like use of illegal arms and drugs. The filmmakers complied two weeks after the official release. #\\"Rap das Armas\\" - Bateria da Rocinha, MC Leonardo #\\"Tropa de Elite\\" - Tihuana #\\"Rap da Felicidade\\" - MC Cidinho, MC Doca #\\"Passa Que é Teu\\" - Pedro Bromfman #\\"Brilhar a Minha Estrela\\" - Sangue da Cidade #\\"Kátia Flávia, a Godiva do Irajá\\" - Fausto Fawcett #\\"Teatro de Bonecos\\" - Guilherme Flarys, Pedro Guedes #\\"Polícia\\" - Titãs #\\"Invasão do BOPE\\" - Pedro Bromfman #\\"Lado B Lado A\\" - O Rappa #\\"Andando Pela África\\" - Barbatuques #\\"Nossa Bandeira\\" - Bateria da Rocinha, MC Leonard #\\"Rap das Armas [Funk]\\" - MC Leonard Sequel A sequel, named Tropa de Elite 2: O Inimigo Agora É Outro, was released in Brazil on October 8, 2010, and in the U.S. on November 11, 2011.

Life and work Hans Ertel began his scientific career at the former Preußischen Meteorologischen Institut (Prussian Meteorological Institute), where the representatives of the Austrian school of meteorology, (Heinrich von Ficker and Albert Defant) had formative influence on him and gave him their lasting support. Ertel continued the works of Felix Maria von Exner-Ewarten, a leading theoretical meteorologist of his time who lived in Vienna, and he completed many of them. He developed into a capable theoretical physicist early on and he was already to publish research results or theoretical approaches in this subject as a young man. Ertel's famous vorticity equation of 1942 belongs today to the basic work of modern geophysics and astrophysics. In 1943, he was given the position of professor for meteorology and geophysics at the University of Innsbruck, and he also attended lectures by Arnold Sommerfeld. After Second World War, Ertel was interested in a professorship for geophysics at the University of Munich, but was instead appointed to professor for geophysics at Berlin University in 1946, where he also became the director of the Institute for Meteorology and Geophysics which belonged to the university. At the invitation of various scientists, such as Hilding Köhler, Markus Bath and Carl-Gustav Rossby, with whom he also maintained long friendships, Ertel held lectures at Stockholm University and Uppsala University in Sweden and took part in congresses, thereby creating a good reputation for his field of research at the Berlin University. As a member of the Deutschen Akademie der Wisschaften zu Berlin, (German Academy of Sciences Berlin), or DAW, Ertel founded and led the Institute for Physical Hydrography of this academy as of 1948. In 1949, Ertel was elected to be a full member of the DAW and was its vice president from 1951 to 1961. During this time, he saw to the founding of some new academy institutes, and also ensured that all of Germany could participate during the International Geophysical Years (1957/58 and 1958/59). The research on geo-ecology, which began under his leadership at the Institute, is considered to be pioneering work today. The following areas of emphasis in research from his time as leader of the Institute enriched scientific knowledge and the subject areas to a great degree: * physical hydrography (more than 60 works) * theoretical hydrodynamics * turbulence *special hydrodynamics of the northern German seas and coasts *hydraulic nomography *hydrographic cartography *the history of European weather *theoretical mechanics (as of 1960) The results of his work were regularly published in specialized international and national magazines (e.g., the Monthly Reports of the German Academy of Sciences), as well as in the magazine of the Institute, Acta Hydrophysica, and soon led to a high reputation for himself and for his institute. Even beyond his institute, Ertel made sure that the magazines, Gerlands Beiträge zur Geophysik, Zeitschrift für Meteorologie and Forschungen und Fortschritte appeared and he collaborated on the Deutschen Literaturzeitschrift himself. Furthermore, he held guest lectures abroad, especially at conferences, participated in research trips and supported international projects. Personally, Ertel was concerned with coastal protection, theoretical geomorphology, meteorological problems and cosmology.

Life Tonantius Ferreolus lived in the Gard valley on his estate of Prusianum and possessed additional estates at Segondum in Rodez. His father was Ferreolus, a Roman Senator. One of his ancestors during the 4th century was a patrician.Martindale, 1980, p. 466. He was either related to Sidonius Apollinaris. His mother was a clarissima femina and daughter of Flavius Afranius Syagrius, Consul in 382.Sidonius Apollinaris, 1915 As praetorian prefect of Gaul he was instrumental in organizing Gaul for the successful defence against the invasion of Attila and the Hun army. At the same time he diplomatically restrained the Patrician and Magister Militum Flavius Aetius from levying excessive taxes against the people of the Gallic Prefecture, receiving public acclaim for his efforts. Following the defeat of the Huns by a Roman-Gothic alliance, Ferreolus resisted the attempts of Visigothic king Thorismund to take advantage of the situation to obtain more territory or privileges in 452–453 when that king besieged Arles. He was associated with Thaumastus and Petronius in conducting the impeachment of Arvandus, a successor in the Gallic Prefecture who had behaved extortionately toward the people of Gaul and who had written a letter to Visigothic King Euric encouraging that monarch to break with his allegiance to Emperor Anthemius and partition Gaul with the Burgundians, presumably with Arvandus' connivance. This prosecution was successful in obtaining a conviction though Arvandus was reprieved, to some extent, it would appear, through the good offices of Sidonius Apollinaris, from execution and he was merely exiled.Martindale, 1980, p. 157. Ferreolus was apparently living a life of religious contemplation after 469 though there is no indication he ever took orders. He is the first clearly attested historical person bearing either the name Ferreolus or Tonantius - there are two much earlier martyrs of the name. However his father's marriage into the Syagrii and his own patrician ancestry suggest that the family was well known and powerful under a different name or names during the third and fourth centuries at least. The family was to retain considerable importance and exert considerable influence in Gaul for over a century and perhaps two after the fall of the Roman Empire. He had married Papianilla, herself clarissima femina, born c. 415, a niece of Emperor Avitus and the first cousin of another Papianilla, wife of Sidonius Apollinaris,Settipani 1991, p. 196, 218. and they had many children, among whom Tonantius Ferreolus. She was a partner who shared his troubles, according to Sidonius. Tonantius Ferreolus had at least three sons: Tonantius Ferreolus who was a Gallo-Roman Senator at Narbonne, Ruricius who became Bishop of Uzes between Probatius and Firminus and at least one son whose name is not attested. It is not known whether he had any daughters or whether more than these two sons survived to adulthood.Mathisen, 1979, p. 56, 75 He had issue: *Tonantius Ferreolus (senator) * Unattested son. * Unattested daughter married to Aspasius of Auch. * Ruricius (d. 506, 507 or shortly after 507), Bishop of Uzès. He was called Bishop of Uzes in the Life of FirminusMathisen, 1979, p. 56 and based on the existence of \\"Ruricius of Uzes\\" of the Life of Firminus, Stanford Mommaerts and Prof. David Kelley postulated that \\"Ruricius of Uzes\\" was a brother of Tonantius, a son of Papianilla, wife of the elder Tonantius and that Ruricius of Limoges was her brother and Tonantius' uncle. This is still the position of a significant number of researchersMommaerts and Kelley, 1992, pp. 111-114. however MathisenMathisen, 1999, p.44. and SettipaniSettipani, 2002, pp. 11-14. have concluded that the octogenarian Bishop Ruricius referred to in the Life of Firminus is in fact Ruricius of Limoges. Settipani has suggested that Papianilla was the sister of Hiberia, wife of Ruricius of Limoges and daughter of Gallo Roman Senator Ommatius of Clermont.Settipani, 1991, pp. 198-199. Given that a Ferreolus would succeed Ruricius and his descendants to the Episcopal chair of Limoges and commission the epitaphs of Ruricius I and II (hence he was a kinsman and probably a descendant),Mathisen, 1999, p. 48. it is likely there are aspects of the relationship between the Ruriciids and Ferreoli that are not yet explained by either theory. Through a direct paternal line, he is an ancestor of Charlemagne.

It can be encountered by maneuvering the protagonist, Mario, in a particular way to trick the game into sending them to the wrong area. Players who enter this area are greeted with an endless, looping water level in the American version, while the Japanese version sends them to a sequence of three different levels. The difference is due to the former being on a cartridge and the latter being on a disk, which arrange data in different ways. It gained exposure in part thanks to the magazine Nintendo Power discussing how the glitch is encountered, and Super Mario Bros. creator Shigeru Miyamoto denied that the addition of the Minus World was intentional, though he later commented that the fact that it does not crash as a game could make it count as a game feature. The existence and revelation of this glitch lead to rumors being spread about further secrets existing in Super Mario Bros. It has gone down as one of the greatest secrets and glitches in video game history, with the term Minus World coming to refer to areas in games that exist outside of normal parameters, such as The Legend of Zelda. Frog Fractions designer Jim Stormdancer cited it as inspiration for making Frog Fractions the way he did, while Spelunky creator Derek Yu talked about his nostalgia for Minus World, lamenting a lack of mystique found in modern games. References to the Minus World can be found in both Super Paper Mario and Super Meat Boy. Summary The screen displaying World -1 on entering the Minus World The Minus World is a glitched level found in the 1985 Nintendo Entertainment System video game Super Mario Bros., which is found after World 1-2. In order to encounter it, players must maneuver Mario through the bricks separating the normal exit from the Warp Zone area. So long as players do not lock the screen in position, players can make Mario enter the first Warp Pipe before the \\"Welcome to Warp Zone!\\" text is revealed. The console did not have a method to check for collisions between tiles, and the task of checking all points around a tile for possible collision points was too difficult for the game's MOS Technology 6502. To compensate for this, the designers put boundary boxes around objects and compare a limited number of collision boundaries. Mario's sprite has two points, one on each foot, each detecting his collision with the floor. The game would normally eject Mario in the opposite direction he is going if he is considered inside a block, which can be averted by crouching while jumping into it and, at the exact right moment, pushing left, causing him to be ejected on the other side of the wall. The game then erroneously sets the far- left Warp Pipe to send him to World -1. When players successfully pull this off, they are presented with a screen reading World -1, and then Mario is put in a water level that loops the end with the beginning, and as a result, cannot be beaten. It is a copy of the stage, World 7-2, aside from the looping. The level is identified in the internal memory as \\"World 36-1,\\" but when it tries to display this, 36 is replaced with a blank space. The reason the glitch occurs is because of a misread byte. The Japanese version of the game on the Famicom Disk System has a different result from performing the glitch; instead of looping after Mario reaches the end of the level, it goes through three different levels until players reach the goal and the game ending. The Japanese levels start with an underwater level as well, with floating Princess Peach and Bowser sprites at multiple points. The reason why the two versions' Minus Worlds differ is due to the North American version using a cartridge and the Japanese version using a disk. Cartridges and disks arrange data in different ways, resulting in the different versions sending the offset the Warp Pipe receives arriving at a different byte in the programming. History When Super Mario Bros. creator Shigeru Miyamoto was asked about the Minus World, he denied authorship and said that it was not intended. When asked later about the Minus World, Miyamoto commented that while it was a glitch, the fact that it does not crash the game makes it a feature as well. Since its discovery, the Minus World has resulted in people believing that Super Mario Bros. designers hid secret levels for skilled players to find. It was featured in the third issue of Nintendo Power, describing it as \\"an endless water world from which no one has ever escaped.\\" This appearance provided photographic evidence of the glitch. Reception The Minus World was an \\"incredible phenomenon\\" and has become well-known over time according to Screen Rant, becoming a part of the video game design lexicon. Siliconera staff called it \\"legendary,\\" while Game Informer writer Ian Boudreau called it \\"one of gaming's most famous glitches.\\" Kotaku writer Jason Schreier wrote that it was \\"seared into video game history.\\" Nintendo Life writer Gavin Lane called it \\"one of the most famous\\" of Nintendo's glitches. Edge staff discussed how its impact was \\"purely symbolic and contextual,\\" discussing it as the glitch with the most \\"lasting influence.\\" They felt that it was so appealing because it was relatively easy to accomplish, suggesting that its early popularity influenced the trend of secret levels. Both Screen Rant and GamesRadar+ made note of the fact that it is an infinite water level, with Screen Rant calling it \\"every gamer's worst nightmare.\\" GamesRadar+ Justin Towell called it \\"one of the greatest\\" video game secrets. According to a game play counselor for Nintendo, the Minus World was one of the most often-requested tricks by callers. Legacy The term 'Minus World' has become a term to refer to an area outside of the parameters of the game, with The Escapist identifying the Super Mario Bros. instance as \\"one of the first and most classic\\" examples. Glitches in other games have been referred to as a Minus World, including the first The Legend of Zelda. Frog Fractions- and Frog Fractions 2-designer Jim Stormdancer cited moments like the Minus World as his inspiration for creating these games, wanting to \\"recapture the sense of mystery\\" these moments evoked. Derek Yu, creator of Spelunky, discussed how he holds nostalgia for the Minus World, calling it an \\"incredible [piece] of lore for [Super Mario Bros.]\\" while lamenting how modern games lack that kind of mystique. The 2007 video game Super Paper Mario featured an area called \\"World -1,\\" in reference to the glitch, which acts as a purgatory. The 2010 video game Super Meat Boy features levels called Minus Warp Zones, which make reference to the glitch.

Vasquez is a prominent Salvadoran scholar of religion and society. As Andrew W. Mellon post-doctoral fellow at Wesleyan University's Center for the Americas and former faculty at the University of Florida, he has focused on the interplay between religion and globalization in the Americas, particularly in Latin America and among U.S. Latinos.  Biography  Manuel A. Vásquez received his B.S. from Georgetown University and his M.A. and Ph.D. from Temple University. Vasquez's dissertation and first book, The Brazilian Popular Church and the Crisis of Modernity (Cambridge University Press 1998), focused on the impact of neo-liberal capitalism on grassroots progressive Catholicism in Brazil. The book received the 1998 award for excellence in the analytical-descriptive study of religion from the American Academy of Religion. More recently, Vasquez has co-directed (with Philip J. Williams) a series of studies, supported by the Pew Charitable Trusts and the Ford Foundation, on the role of religion in the process of migration, settlement, and integration among Latinos in new destinations in the U.S. South. In particular, he has explored how religious congregations grapple with the challenges posed by increasing racial and ethnic diversity and transnational immigration, both authorized and unauthorized. Vasquez has also contributed to the field of method and theory, advancing a \\"non-reductive materialism\\" that stresses the centrality of embodiment, emplacement, practice, and material culture in the study of religion. He argues that religions are hybrid and dynamic artifacts produced by complex relations among discursive matrices, and social, neural, and ecological networks.

Angeli was also a firefighter, EMT and firefighter instructor whose primary area of expertise was firefighter safety. In 1989, he combined both vocations to specialize in film production and television programming dealing with the emergency services. Angeli's work has been seen on broadcast programs like ABC's 20/20, Dateline: NBC, Rescue/911, Inferno, and Real-TV. Earlier in his television career, he served as a studio director for Philadelphia's PBS station, a remote director for ESPN, and a documentary cameraman for CNN. As a videojournalist, Angeli had documented two wars and dozens of disasters, including the attack on the World Trade Center on 9/11/01. As a videographer, Angeli's most notable work is documenting fire- rescue incidents from the 1st Responder's point of view. Riding along with fire departments in the US, Canada, Italy and Sweden, he followed firefighters inside of burning buildings to offer the viewer a unique perspective on life as a firefighter. On September 11, 2007, he announced start up of production on a new documentary dealing with illness and death among 9/11's emergency responders. In a press interview he noted that \\"70,000 emergency personnel and support volunteers responded to New York's call for help.\\" He continued, \\"According to The World Trade Center Medical Monitoring Program , fully 70% of these men and women are ill ... the effects of having worked at Ground Zero.\\" Angeli cited estimates that by the 10th anniversary of the World Trade Center disaster, 1,000 emergency personnel will have died of illness contracted at Ground Zero. Angeli was active as a disaster responder serving on the Community Emergency Response Team (New Castle County, Delaware) and the Medical Reserve Corps , two disaster response programs borne of the ashes of the World Trade Center. Career Lou Angeli got started in the film industry as a dolly grip on the Academy Award-winning film Rocky in 1976. As a Director of Photography, Angeli lensed the CBS documentary, \\"Plan To Get Out Alive!\\", which earned the production team an Emmy Award. His directorial debut was the 1997 reality series Beyond The Yellow Tape. Later that year, he directed and photographed the documentary When Sparks Fly. In 2005, Angeli was behind the camera directing the thriller Keson. Lou's career also included that of Editor of the International Fire Photographers Association Journal up to his death and cinematographer on Backdraft. Angeli's most popular work is the 2005 documentary Answering the Call: Ground Zero's Volunteers. Narrated by Kathleen Turner, the film pays tribute to all of the volunteers who descended upon New York City's Ground Zero after the September 11, 2001 terrorist attacks on the World Trade Center. Answering The Call: Ground Zero's Volunteers was officially released on September 9, 2006 to commemorate the fifth anniversary of the tragedy. The film was broadcast in China, Spain, Portugal, Poland, France and the UK. The film was also released as a DVD, Streaming Internet Video and Video On Demand in the United States. An updated version of the film was released in August 2011 to commemorate the 10th anniversary of the World Trade Center Disaster. Segments of the updated film aired on CNN , BBC , CBC and RAI . World Trade Center Disaster Angeli volunteered \\"multiple\\" hours at Ground Zero, working the \\"Pile\\", immediately after the 9-11 murders at the World Trade Center. It is thought that his time at Ground Zero hastened onset of his death. Death Angeli was admitted several weeks before his death suffering from a Subarachnoid hemorrhage as well as Sepsis. He lingered in critical condition until finally succumbing. Angeli's sickness was reportedly caused by his extensive time spent at Ground Zero. His family says that since he had returned from the World Trade Center site that he would have severe coughing episodes accompanied by sudden bleeding of the airway. Louis was predeceased by his mother, Mary (Conforti) Angeli. He is survived by his father, Frank Angeli; wife, Patricia Olesky; son, Andrew Angeli; and a host of extended family both in Wilmington and Italy.

Biography Herbert appears to have commenced his early career with Ben Greet's Company, and with Sir Frank Benson; for some years he managed Benson's No.2 Company on tour, as well as playing leading parts. On 22 April 1911, he directed Basil Rathbone in his first appearance on stage at the Theatre Royal, Ipswich, as Hortensio in The Taming of the Shrew. In 1912 he went to the U.S. and appeared at the Lyceum Theatre (New York) on 9 September as Captain Jeyes in The 'Mind-the-Paint' Girl, and from March to May 1916 he appeared (with Sir Herbert Tree) at the New Amsterdam Theatre, New York, as Griffith and the Jester in Shakespeare's King Henry VIII, Tubal in The Merchant of Venice, and Dr. Caius in The Merry Wives of Windsor.

They are known for their golden yellow color and chewy characteristics. The slightly chewy and slightly spongy texture of the noodles is due to the soda water used in making the dough, which is then fried and dried into flat patty- like dried bricks. Preparation The Yi mein noodles available at grocery stores were pre-cooked by machines the same way as the modern instant noodles are made. The noodles may be cooked a number of ways. They are boiled first, then can be stir fried, or used in soups or salads. Good noodles maintain their elasticity, allowing the noodles to stretch and remain chewy. Dishes Yi mein noodles can be consumed directly or used in various dishes: * Plain yi mein * Plain yi mein with Chinese chives (韮黃) * Dried fried yi mein (乾燒伊麵), often comes with Chinese chives and shiitake mushroom * Crab meat yi mein (蟹肉伊麵) * Lobster yi mein (龍蝦伊麵), it is sometimes served with cheese in Hong Kong. * Yi mein with black mushrooms and eggplant * Yi mein in soup * I fu mie, dried fried yi mein noodle served in sauce with vegetables chicken or prawn.

History Railway Birdum was the terminus of the North Australia Railway from 1929 until the outbreak of World War II. Railway station at Birdum, circa 1940 While the town remains virtually unheard of, even amongst Territorians, it features on an unusually high proportion of vintage 20th century world globes, thanks to the position it once held at the end of the line. From World War II onwards trains terminated at Larrimah, nine kilometres to the north, and Birdum lost not only its position of importance but also its pub, which was uprooted and shifted to Larrimah as a result. Much of the railway infrastructure remained in place until the line closed in 1976. World War II After the bombing of Darwin during World War II, the Darwin civilian population was evacuated and the evacuees were transported by rail to Birdum siding where they were transferred to an army convoy to take them to Alice Springs. An evacuation hospital was constructed at Birdum by the U.S. Army 135th Medical Regiment in September 1942. The Royal Australian Air Force constructed a Base Personnel Staff Officer (BPSO) and Telecommunications Camp near Birdum. No. 11 Signals Unit RAAF, which was part of No. 55 Operational Base Unit (OBU) was based at Birdum.

He was born in the village Chala in what is now Shida Kartli region (then under Russian rule) to a prominent Georgian aristocratic family. Educated at the Tiflis nobility gymnasium, he enrolled in the Nizhny Novgorod Dragoon regiment in 1850. Amilakhvari spent the first three years of his military career fighting the recalcitrant mountainous clans during the Caucasian War and was wounded at the action of Chakpak on August 31, 1853. During the Crimean War (1853-1856), he fought on the Caucasus front against the Ottoman Empire and distinguished himself at the Battle of Choloki where Amilakhvari, with his irregular unit of Georgian hunters completely destroyed an entire Ottoman battalion. After another three years of his service in Chechnya (1856-1859), Amilakhvari was promoted to colonel and assigned to command the Nizhny Novgorod dragoon regiment from 1864 to 1873. In 1871, Tsar Alexander II of Russia sent him to Stuttgart to congratulate King Charles I of Württemberg on the occasion of the 25th anniversary of his being the chief of Nizhny Novgorod Dragoon Regiment. The same year, Amilakhvari visited the German army headquarters at Paris during the Franco-Prussian War. On return, he obtained the rank of major general in 1873 and returned to the service in the Caucasus where he took part in a series of battles during the Russo-Turkish War (1877–1878). After the war, he served as a commander of a cavalry division in the Caucasus and was promoted to lieutenant general in May 1883. In 1886, through negotiation and persuasion, he managed to stop unrest in Chechnya. Commissioned a cavalry general in 1896, he commanded the Caucasus Army Corps from 1893 until 1897 when he was assigned to the chief headquarters of the Caucasus Military District, sometimes acting as a de facto commander-in-chief of the Caucasus army. In 1901, on the 200th anniversary of the Nizhny Novgorod Dragoon Regiment, he became an adjutant general. In 1904, he served as an acting governor-general of Baku and used his influence and prestige to pacify the disturbances in the city. He was decorated with numerous Russian and foreign awards, including the imperial orders of St. George, St. Vladimir, St. Anna, St. Alexander Nevsky and of St. Stanislav. He died in his native Chala in 1905 and was interred at the Kashveti Church in downtown Tbilisi. Ivane Amilakhvari's grandson was Prince Dimitri Amilakhvari, a French hero of World War II.

Background She was sired by the outstanding English and American stud, Rahy out of the Broad Brush mare, Justenuffheart, who was a multi-graded stakes race winner and half-sister to Grade I Turf winner Kitten's Joy. Although there is no Northern Dancer nor Mr. Prospector in her bloodline, she traces back to the great Nearco through several lines. Bred by Frank C. Calabrese, she was named for his deceased sister, Anna Anderson, who died of cancer at age 48. Dreaming of Anna is a full sister to owner Frank Calabrese's graded stakes race winner, Lewis Michael, winner of the 2007 Grade II Washington Park Handicap. Racing career Trained by Wayne Catelano, Dreaming of Anna was undefeated as a two-year-old, winning a maiden race, the Tippett Stakes, and then the Grade III Summer Stakes at Woodbine, beating colts in a near-record time on turf, before winning the 2006 Breeders' Cup Juvenile Fillies wire to wire win over Octave. She was named U.S. Champion 2-Yr-Old Filly for 2006. Dreaming of Anna was wintered at Palm Meadows Thoroughbred Training Center in Florida. Her 2007 began with a third in the Grade III Old Hat Stakes in February at Gulfstream Park and a second in the Gaily Gaily Stakes on turf. With regular jockey René Douglas in the saddle, she seemed to tire in the stretch in the Kentucky Oaks and placed 6th to Rags to Riches. Returned to the turf, she won the Double Delta Stakes at Arlington Park and the Virginia Oaks at Colonial Downs gate to wire. In September, she won the Grade III Pucker Up Stakes back at Arlington, a 1⅛ mile race on turf, with a 4¼ length victory in 1:48.20, just off the stake record. On October 13, 2007, Dreaming of Anna was beaten by a little over 2 lengths by Bit of Whimsy in the Grade I Queen Elizabeth II Challenge Cup Stakes at Keeneland Race Course after leading most of the way. Dreaming of Anna made her 2008 racing debut at Tampa Bay Downs with a win in the Endeavour Breeders' Cup Stakes. On March 15, she won the Grade IIIT Hillsborough Stakes against Lear's Princess.

It was broadcast in 90-minute episodes on Seoul Broadcasting System (SBS) every Saturday from April 14, 2007, to September 15, 2007. The show was hosted by the SBS announcer Choi Gwi-hwan and had two teams of celebrity contestants, each captained by regulars Hyun Young and Kim Yong-man. It was divided into a series of loosely scripted challenges; the team with the winning final score would take \\"Jeongshin Tongil gwan\\" (\\"정신통일관\\") for that episode. Guests on the teams included Tablo, Chae Yeon, Tei, Bada, various members of Shinhwa, DBSK, CSJH, SNSD, Fly to the Sky and Super Junior. A regular segment on the show was \\"the wall\\", an adaptation of the Brain Wall from the Japanese Tunnels game show. The segment had a moving wall advancing on a contestant standing at the edge of a pool of water. To avoid being knocked into the pool, he or she was to jump, dodge or otherwise pass through a hole in the wall. Some of the more difficult walls required acrobatic skill to pass and used humorous cutouts of ballet poses, flying kicks and handstands. Another regular segment (dropped towards the end of the series) was the \\"earthquake room\\", in which contestants on a padded platform were each given a pile of cushions. They were then asked to solve a series of visual puzzles, but could only give their answer while kneeling on a complete pile of cushions. This often resulted in tumblehouse slapstick because of the rocking motion of the platform and constant fighting over cushions; foam rocks were also thrown at the contestants and the platform tilted violently whenever a wrong answer was given. The show suffered from poor ratings over its run and, despite frequent changes to its format by SBS writers, it was axed after 22 episodes.

McDonald, manufactured by Sony Music and published by Emperor Multimedia Corporation August 23, 2006.  History  The publication that would become Polishing of Metal (also known as: POM) took some eight years in total to develop. Its development was a happenstance of circumstances over that period. First Publication During 1995 computer programmer and heavy music enthusiast Derek McDonald began research on the origins of Heavy Metal Music as a personal project. Seeing that his McBBS project was winding down he needed a new project to pass his time. The original text that would eventually evolve into Polishing Of Metal, as it later became known, was a set of articles published in an obscure Gothic underground pulp publication named Legends Magazine released by Marcus Pan and his Inferno Publishing in Linden, New Jersey, United States in 1997 from February to December of that year. Pan agreed to release the early text as a form of gathering ratings from its readership. These articles went largely unseen in the larger society but remained popular amongst the magazine readers; the core content of those articles would become the central nucleus for Polishing Of Metal. The original concept was Polishing of Metal would be printed book format but no publisher showed interest in what would be a specialty textbook on this form of music, and the cost of self-publishing proved to be prohibitive, so the project was set aside. Technological & Commercial Development The emerging technologies of Compact Discs and Multimedia would be the savior of the project. Soon after he set the project aside, McDonald decided to close up his computer company DMCS Technologies and start a new firm: Emperor Multimedia Corporation in 1998. The first publication of this venture was a CD dubbed The Alliance in 1999. The Alliance gave only a hint of what was to come for it contained a hidden track featuring biographical texts and photographs of the acts featured on the compilation disc. The software was primitive even to the standards of 1999 but the disc managed to chart and receive commercial air play, most specifically on Toronto’s Q-107 (CILQ-FM). The Alliance, along with the massive database of musical artists he had obtained through his business activities surrounding it, gave McDonald a huge advantage over competitors with unprecedented access to independent musicians with fresh talent loyal to his efforts. After working on several private CD production contracts and software development, McDonald would resurrect the Polishing of Metal documents. The cost of CD production was plummeting and his access to the artists and technology now made it affordable to create complex multimedia projects for CD distribution. His first attempt at this was in the form of Recorded History, released December 31, 2002. In an attempt to attract a wider audience the disc centered more on the history of Rock Music in general, with the discussions on Heavy Metal maintaining a significant part of the over-all project. The multimedia presentation featured PDF encoded text, with 500 artist biographies, 900 album reviews and some 100 photographs. It featured a single music video by Robert Jackson and 14 audio tracks in MP3 format. Although the disc was a true multimedia production it lacked what the consumers were looking for and it fell short of popular demand. Completion McDonald took a couple of years to research the contents and improve the technology to rework the formula and return in 2006 with the modern day Polishing of Metal. Now centering purely on the life and times of Heavy Metal, Polishing of Metal managed to impress both the industry and music fans alike. Except for the graphic arts, music & video conversions, the entire Polishing of Metal project was written and conceived by Derek McDonald. The elements that made Recorded History a true interactive multimedia experience were still there but they were augmented with the glitz of entertainment. This time featuring some 19 music videos, 5 and a half hours of music in both MP3 and standard audio format allowing the disc promotion on radio, some 5000 pages of PDF & HTML encoded text, Internet links and 1304 artist biographies with some 900 album reviews. The cover art was updated to feature a new rendition of long-time mascot Skel (Skel has appeared on the cover of all of McDonald’s projects) and was drawn by Barry Waddell of Florida, USA act Seasons Of The Wolf. The Internet links component was an added bonus as it allowed the CD-ROM to interface directly with the RRCA (Rock Record Collector’s Association) artist biography database known as the Music Knowledge Base, effectively extending the CD-ROM’s shelf-life by allowing purchaser of the disc to augment the CD's permanent listings with new information with a click of the mouse and free of charge. Indeed, the RRCA’s database provided much of the biographical and review commentary seen on the CD-ROM, several specially made applications were developed during the creation of the project with the sole purpose of converting the data the RRCA contained. Coupled with this feature was another link system that allowed connection to albums featured in the document that were also on sale at Diskery, McDonald's own on-line music store; not to mention the links to artist websites. Polishing of Metal was cleverly engineered as there was a large amount of \\"hidden technology\\" behind the operation of it. This technology was featured from the start where a special program was on the disc that allowed the CD-ROM to bootstrap all the needed applications at start-up instead of the single application start provided by Windows; the application could also detect and stop disc execution if the needed support software was not in the computer. Although the data on the disc can be viewed on several OS platforms, this special autostart program only worked on Windows. Other OSes must start the disc manually; instructions were provided. This limitation was later overcome. As an added feature the disc also had an extensive interactive help database/user manual programmed onto it, as well as a dictionary of industry and Heavy Metal cultural terminology called the \\"Metalopedia\\". Each genuine copy of Polishing of Metal was custom engraved with the text: EMPEROR MULTIMEDIA POLISHING OF METAL CD-ROM ERC4-EB etched into the reflection hub band of the CDs. The entire capacity of the 2 CDs is used, leaving only about 1MB of free space on each, left as a buffer to allow for copy errors during the duplication process. Termination For all of its advancements, Polishing of Metal suffered a major handicap: It was expensive to produce. Completed during a sort of economic boom to its publishing company, Emperor Multimedia, by 2013 the tide had changed. Money was not as easy to come by and the market for Compact Discs was faltering. Unable to gain financing for a follow-up, the project was terminated. Emperor Multimedia Corporation ended all compact disc manufacture and production shortly after. On March 17, 2013 the last shipment of CDs were shipped for commercial sale, the remaining inventory was given to charity. The date was carefully chosen as it coincided with the release date of the firm's first production, The Alliance of March 17, 1999. McDonald purchased all rights to the intellectual properties held by Emperor Multimedia to that date so he could continue production in the digital realm on a potential future website called 'The Diskery Music Archives' to take the place of his defunct music on-line retail shop The Diskery and the RRCA Music Archives.  Significance  The legacy of Polishing of Metal was not so much the story of its author, its technology, or any artist featured on it, but the statement it made to the recording industry. During the early part of the 21st century recording companies were suffering financial blows due to the encroachment of the computer industry and the wide availability of the Internet allowing consumers to download audio tracks or wholesale copy music in digital format anywhere on Earth. Indeed, many computer companies such as Apple Inc. with their successful iPod product quietly but indirectly encouraged this behavior to boost their profits. The cost of distribution of the now 25-year-old Compact Disc technology was becoming prohibitive. McDonald’s approach was a simple one, \\"if you can’t beat them then join them. Use that same technology to impress the customer enough they will want to buy the compact disc\\", as he once said in a famous radio interview. He used the music to sell his technology and not the reverse that tended to be normal operation, and to keep costs low he distributed the disc exclusively via his own company and restricted sales only to on-line (internet) retailers. This approach may have slowed the sales of the project, but it allowed a more profitable distribution and manufacturing model. Polishing of Metal was, for its time, the most advanced E-book ever made and the first on this subject matter. It showcased many unknown acts while demonstrating some of the latest techniques in publishing and multimedia technology. It once and for all sealed the gap between the entertainment and electronics industries. On August 12, 2007 it was inducted into the UNESCO Great Library of Alexandria (Bibliotheca Alexandrina). Many people believe that the creation of Alliance, Recorded History and Polishing of Metal form a sort of deliberately developed trilogy. Fact is they do not. The projects are mutually exclusive of each other.  Special Interest  * The video for the band Penetrator featured on the CD is the only video ever made for this band. The video was only ever published on Polishing of Metal and was never seen anywhere else, although the intention was for mass distribution. This video is the only live-action ever seen of Derek McDonald for he appears on one of his own projects for the first time. He is the leather-clad biker on the left when he and band singer (and personal friend) Maxel Black encounter the seductive lady in the alleyway; another scene featuring him in Gothic attire was cut from the final copy. The video was filmed at the Gladstone Hotel (Toronto), a location suggested by McDonald.

It was recorded in June 1975 in Harmonia's studio in Forst, Germany. It was first released on the Brain Records label in 1975. Deluxe was produced by the band members and legendary Krautrock producer, Conny Plank. The trio were also joined by drummer Mani Neumeier for the release.

He brought a 16-track recording machine and mixing desk to the band's country studio. Plank brought along drummer and Guru Guru member Mani Neumeier to perform on several tracks. Deluxe emphasized Rother's rock and pop sensibility over Cluster's more improvisational approach, which led to some creative tension between the members. Reception Ned Raggett's review for Allmusic describes the album as \\"a touch more immediate and song-oriented than its predecessor, but no less enchanting and lovely to hear,\\" noting that \\"the motorik pulses and rhythms, however soft and subtle, still dominate the proceedings, while the glazed, warm feeling of the whole album is astounding.\\"Raggett, Ned.

It is a fictionalised account of Sassoon's own life during and immediately after World War I. Soon after its release, it was heralded as a classic and was even more successful than its predecessor, Memoirs of a Fox- Hunting Man. Synopsis Sassoon's account of his experiences in the trenches during World War I, between the spring of 1916 and the summer of 1917, creates a picture of a physically brave but self-effacing and highly insecure individual. The narrative moves from the trenches to the Fourth Army School, to Morlancourt and a raid, then to and through the Somme. The narrator, George Sherston, is wounded when a piece of shrapnel shell passes through his lung after he incautiously sticks his head over the parapet at the Battle of Arras in 1917. He is sent home to convalesce and, while there, arranges to have lunch with the Editor of an anti-war newspaper, the Unconservative Weekly. He determines to speak out against the war, though this contravenes military regulations and could result in his execution. The book finishes as George Sherston prepares to attend 'Slateford War Hospital' (Craiglockhart War Hospital in Edinburgh) after a medical board had decided he was suffering from shell shock. The book portrays Sherston's emotional and intellectual coming of age, as he learns \\"that he is but one insignificant person caught up in events beyond anyone's comprehension\\".Dominic Harman, \\"‘The Truth About Men in the Front Line’: Imagining the Experience of War in Memoirs of the Western Front\\" University of Sussex Journal of Contemporary History, 2 (2001).

Based on a novel and produced by Pridi Banomyong and released before Thailand's involvement in World War II, the English-language film carried a propaganda message from anti-war interests in Thailand, that Thailand should remain neutral, and only go to war to defend its sovereignty against foreign invaders. However, on December 8, 1941, Thailand was occupied by the Japanese and officially sided with the Axis powers during the war. Plot Set in the Ayutthaya Kingdom of the 16th century, King Chakra is going about his usual palace duties, granting audiences to his advisers, including his Lord Chamberlain, who is keen to see the king fulfill his royal duty of taking 366 wives, including, hopefully among them, the chamberlain's own daughter. However, the threat of invasion by the King of Honsa (Thai: หงสาวดี Hongsawadi, Burmese: Hanthawaddy kingdom of Burma) has King Chakra pre-occupied. The peace-loving King Chakra at first wants to negotiate for peace, but is unsuccessful, and finds himself forced to go to war to stop the Honsa (Hanthawaddy) invasion.

The cast of the movie were lecturers and students from Thammasat University, which Pridi had founded. The film was made with the intent of conveying Pridi's conception of peace to international audiences, and was filmed in English, the first Thai film to do so. The film also took its themes from Buddhist philosophy, that there is no happiness that is greater than peace, but also carried the message that Pridi thought Thailand was ready to fight a war of aggression by any foreign invaders. The movie was screened in New York City and Singapore. After Japan invaded Thailand on December 8, 1941, Pridi became a leader of the Free Thai Movement resistance movement, while the Thai military dictators sided with Japan in the Axis Powers and declared war on Great Britain and the United States.Pridi Banonyoung biography, Phuket Film Festival, retrieved 2007-10-16 Restoration The King of the White Elephant was among two films chosen for a restoration project launched by the Thailand Ministry of Culture, with cooperation from Technicolor and the Thai Film Foundation.

His predecessors were Auxanius (bishop form 542-546) and Caesarius of Arles (d. 542). His father Sacerdos (d. 552) was an Archbishop of Lyon. His cousin Nicetius (d. 573) succeeded his father as Archbishop of Lyon. He died on 16 June 551 in Lyon and is buried in the Church of Saint-Nizier. The text of his epitaph is preserved. Life Aurelianus was the son of Sacerdos of Lyon. He was elected to the See of Aries in 546. Like his predecessor Auxanius, Aurelianus wrote the pope requesting the granting of the pallium as a mark of the dignity and powers of a papal legate for Gaul; Pope Vigilius granted this request. Aurelianus founded two monasteries in Arles, a community for monks dedicated to Saint Peter in collaboration with King Childebert I and his wife Ultrogotha, and a convent dedicated to Saint Mary. Saint-Peter may count among the first monasteries (co-)founded by a Merovingian king. He wrote a monastic rule for his first foundation, which is primarily based on Caesarius of Arles' Rule for Monks but also uses parts of Caesarius' Rule for Virgins. It is the only early medieval monastic rule for monks that requires total enclosure. Later Aurelianus produced a female version of his Rule for his second foundation. His Rule for Nuns is somewhat shorter but shows few signs of an adjustment for the other gender, which indicates that in his view there were no fundamental differences between monks and nuns with regard to their status and monastic practice.Diem, Albrecht (2014), ‘ ...ut si professus fuerit se omnia impleturum, tunc excipiatur', pp. 208-222. Both rules are preserved in Benedict of Aniane's Codex Regularum. A number of chapters of his Rule for Monks appear also in Benedict of Aniane's Concordia Regularum. In 549 he participated in the Fifth Council of Orléans, which was presided by his father. Aurelianus is venerated as an Eastern Orthodox and Roman Catholic saint. His feast day is 16 June.

Eight of his relatives died in the notorious concentration camp Jasenovac. After the war, Mikelić grew up in orphanages in Slovenia and Croatia. He came to reside in the municipality of Petrinja in the Croatian region of Banovina, where he soon rose in the political structure. In the 1970s he served as mayor of Petrinja, and was an important figure there for the rest of the Socialist period. He set up the enterprise Gavrilović, a meat processing firm, which was very successful, and he was recognised throughout Yugoslavia as a prominent businessman. In the 1980s he rose to the Central Committee of the League of Communists of Croatia (SKH), and in April 1989 was elected to the Central Committee of the League of Communists of Yugoslavia (SKJ). He was a prominent ethnic Serb in the Croatian party hierarchy. Breakup of Yugoslavia With the rise of nationalism and end of Communism in Yugoslavia in 1989–90, Mikelić found himself in a republic, Croatia, caught between two rival nationalisms – Croatian and Serbian. Mikelić opposed both, and, in August 1990 he and a number of other Serbs, Croats and others in the SKH formed the Socialist Party of Croatia – Party of Yugoslav Orientation, to oppose the SDP under Ivica Račan and the Serbian Democratic Party (SDS) led by Jovan Rašković. The party's secretary was a Croatian, Goran Babić, and the membership and leadership included a large number of Croats, and also Muslims, Hungarians and other nations and nationalities, though pro-Yugoslav Serbs were most numerous. The party supported the preservation of federal Yugoslavia and Croatia as an equal republic of that federation, with the Serbs as a constituent nation as they were until July 1990, opposing both demands for confederalisation and Croatian independence and autonomy for the Serbs or the redrawing of borders. In late September 1990, when Croatian police were sent to investigate Serb forces being organized in Petrinja, the Serb forces attacked the Croatian police force without warning. Mikelić, whose party was the first to inform the Federal Presidency of these dramatic events, was accused of organising a Serbian rebellion by the Croatian government. Later in 1990, Mikelić had a near-fatal car accident in Bosnia. He spent several months in hospital in Belgrade. The Socialist Party in January 1991 joined the League of Communists – Movement for Yugoslavia, but its influence in Croatia was not great. The HDZ also asked him to quit his job running Gavrilović, threatening to blockade the company if he did not resign. Mikelić spent the next few years in Serbia, continuing his business activities. He was often asked to join the Socialist Party of Serbia of Slobodan Milošević, but never did, deciding not to attend their meetings and congresses, and instead associating with the Yugoslav Left. Krajina Prime Minister Mikelić returned to prominence in the political scene in 1994, when he was elected Prime Minister of the Serbian Republic of Krajina.O'Shea, Brendan. The Modern Yugoslav Conflict 1991–1995: Perception, Deception and Dishonesty. New York: Frank Cass, 2005. 105. As Prime Minister, Mikelić promoted economic, monetary and judicial ties with the Republic of Serbia (Belgrade), supported the idea of unification with Republika Srpska (the \\"United Serb Republic\\"), and was leading Krajina towards eventual unification with Serbia and Montenegro, with Belgrade's backing. This was undermined, however, in early 1995 when the Z4 Plan was presented before the economic integration had got going, and Croatia decided not to renew the UNPROFOR mandate. Milan Martić, President of RSK, and Milan Babić, RSK Foreign Minister, declared that they would not consider Z4 until the mandate was renewed. Mikelić regarded them as committing a major error in appearing to be obstinate, though he himself accepted Z4 only as a basis for negotiation, as it offered autonomy only to 11 municipalities, which formed less than half of the RSK's territory. Mikelić was dismissed in June 1995.Ramet, Sabrina P. The Three Yugoslavias: State-Building and Legitimation, 1918–2005. Bloomington, IN: Indiana University Press, 2006. 458. Milan Martić, RSK President, claimed at one government meeting in early 1995 that Milošević had called him and backed his rejection of Z4. Mikelić thought this odd, as Milošević had been encouraging his economic agreements with Croatia, which were intended to lead to gradual reintegration. At a meeting with him shortly after this, Mikelić asked Milošević if what Martić had said was true. Milošević denied it vigorously, and Mikelić believes him to have been telling the truth, given Milošević's role in encouraging reintegration in 1994.

Moore; transferred to the Navy 7 July 1944; and commissioned the same day, Lieutenant W. Hord, USCGR, in command.  World War II service  Calamus sailed from Norfolk, Virginia, 13 September 1944, bound for Pearl Harbor and Ulithi, where she arrived in mid-December and began her work as station tanker, fueling ships of the fleet as they brought the war ever closer to the Japanese homeland.  Supporting the Central Pacific fleet  Calamus cleared for Eniwetok 20 January 1945, and until February, pumped her vital gasoline into the ships readying there for the assault on Iwo Jima. Following the fleet she served westward, Calamus did station duty at Saipan from 11 February until 26 April, when she anchored off Okinawa to support the 3-week old assault. The tanker provided essential fueling service through the entire period of the island's assault and occupation, enduring the violent Japanese air attacks which marked the campaign as steadfastly as did the combatant ships.  Beached at Okinawa and refloated  While at Okinawa Calamus was beached as a result of Typhoon Louise, 9 October 1945, refloated 24 October 1945, repaired and returned to service.  Post-war decommissioning  Following occupation service, Calamus returned to San Francisco, California, 20 March 1946 and was struck from the Navy list (date unknown). She was decommissioned 15 May 1946, and transferred to the Maritime Commission 4 September 1946. Final disposition: she was scrapped in 1964.

The NTSB found that the probable cause of the crash of TWA Flight 800 was an explosion of flammable fuel/air vapors in a fuel tank, most likely from a short circuit. An alternative explanation posits that the crash was due to a U.S. Navy missile test gone awry. On June 19, 2013, a documentary presented evidence the government investigation into the crash was a cover-up and made news headlines with statements from six members of the original investigation team, now retired, who also filed a petition to reopen the probe. Other possible causes, a terrorist missile strike or an on-board bomb, have not produced supporting evidence. Background TWA 800, a Boeing 747-131, was a scheduled international passenger flight from New York City, New York to Rome, Italy, with a stopover in Paris, France. At about 20:31 EDT, on July 17, 1996, about 12 minutes after takeoff from John F. Kennedy International Airport (JFK), TWA 800 exploded and then crashed into the Atlantic Ocean near East Moriches, New York. Of the 230 passengers and crew on board, no survivors were found, making TWA 800 the second-deadliest aircraft accident in the United States at that time. While investigators from the NTSB arrived on scene the following day, many witnesses to the accident had seen a \\"streak of light\\" that was usually described as ascending, moving to a point where a large fireball appeared. There was intense public interest in these witness reports and much speculation that the reported streak of light was from a missile that had struck TWA 800, causing the airplane to explode. Consequently, the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) initiated a parallel criminal investigation alongside the NTSB's accident investigation. Search and recovery Pieces of the airplane wreckage were discovered floating on and beneath the surface of the Atlantic Ocean about eight miles south of East Moriches, New York. The main wreckage was found scattered on the ocean floor in an area about 4 miles long by 3 1/2 miles wide. In one of the largest diver-assisted salvage operations ever conducted, over 95 percent of the airplane wreckage was eventually recovered. Recovered wreckage was transported by boat to shore and then by truck to leased hangar space at the former Grumman Aircraft facility in Calverton, New York, for storage, examination, and reconstruction. Explosive residues As wreckage was recovered, preliminary testing indicated the presence of explosive residue on three samples of material from three separate locations of the recovered airplane wreckage (described by the FBI as a piece of canvas-like material and two pieces of a floor panel). These samples were submitted to the FBI's laboratory in Washington, D.C., which determined that one sample contained traces of cyclotrimethylenetrinitramine (RDX), another nitroglycerin, and the third a combination of RDX and pentaerythritol tetranitrate (PETN); these findings received much media attention at the time. While investigators from the FBI viewed these positive tests as strong indications of a criminal act, the NTSB was more cautious, noting the lack of any patterns on the recovered wreckage characteristic of an explosion. Ultimately, the NTSB was unable to determine the exact source of explosive residues found on the wreckage. Some of the possibilities considered were contamination from the aircraft's use in 1991 transporting troops during the Gulf War or its possible use in a dog-training explosive detection exercise about one month before the accident; however, the lack of any other corroborating evidence associated with a high-energy explosion led the NTSB to conclude that \\"the in-flight breakup of TWA flight 800 was not initiated by a bomb or missile strike\\". Meanwhile, TWA chief 747 pilot Robert Terrell Stacey, who was participating in the official investigation as a TWA representative, became convinced that a reddish-brown substance observed on the backs of recovered passenger seats was suspicious, and possibly indicative of explosive residue or rocket fuel. Working with journalist James Sanders, and Sanders' wife Elizabeth, a TWA flight attendant, he removed items from the wreckage reconstruction site, specifically the samples of seat fabric as well as documents related to the investigation. CNN: \\"Couple arraigned on TWA evidence theft\\" December 9, 1997 In 1997 Sanders' published the book The Downing of TWA Flight 800, in which he proposed that TWA 800 had been downed by a missile, and that a government cover-up had taken place so as to not panic the public. Later, with the information provided by Sanders, the Riverside Press-Enterprise published a series of articles alleging that the substance was consistent with unexpended rocket fuel from a missile that struck TWA 800. Riverside Press-Enterprise News Archive for July 17, 1998 The NTSB determined the locations and appearance of the substance found on the seatbacks was consistent with adhesive used in the construction of the seats, and additional laboratory testing by NASA identified the substance as being consistent with those adhesives (results which Sanders disputed). On December 5, 1997, federal prosecutors charged Sanders, his wife Elizabeth, and Stacey with theft of government property. CNN: \\"Pilot and author charged with stealing TWA 800 wreckage\\" December 5, 1997 The Sanders' defense attorney Bruce Maffeo described the prosecution as \\"extremely vindictive\\" and insisted that the couple had a First Amendment right to take the sample and crash-related documents to expose a cover-up. CNN: \\"Mystery of Flight 800: Three years after crash, questions linger\\" July 17, 1999 In April 1999, both were convicted of stealing evidence from civil aircraft wreckage, and were sentenced to probation (Stacey had previously pleaded guilty to a misdemeanor in the case). In 1999, James Sanders authored a second book, Altered Evidence. Radar data Unidentified radar tracks One of the first widely reported criticisms of the official investigation was by former reporter Pierre Salinger, who held a press conference in Cannes, France on November 7, 1996. He stated he had proof that TWA 800 was shot down by friendly fire, and the incident was being covered up by the government. CNN: \\"Federal agencies deny TWA Flight 800 shot down by missile\\" November 8, 1996 Salinger said \\"he was basing the claims on information he saw in a document given to him six weeks ago by someone in French Intelligence with close contacts to U.S. officials\\", but refused to name his source. CNN quickly found Salinger's document to be \\"a widely accessible e-mail letter that has been circulating for at least six weeks on the Internet's World Wide Web.\\" Salinger's evidence was actually an e-mail from Richard Russell, a retired airline pilot. CNN: \\"'Pierre Salinger Syndrome' and the TWA 800 conspiracies\\" July 17, 2006 Salinger's previous position as White House Press Secretary, as well as longtime correspondent for ABC News, initially gave credence to his statements, transforming them from \\"internet conspiracies\\" into the mainstream. However, under scrutiny, his allegations, and the reports issued with his collaborators, became the subject of much criticism in the media. CNN: \\"Salinger offers new 'evidence' in Flight 800 missile theory\\" March 12, 1997 TIME Magazine: \\"THE WORST PUBLIC PERFORMANCES OF 1996\\" December 23, 1996 NTSB Vice chairman Bob Francis was quoted as saying \\"He was an idiot, he didn't know what he was talking about, and he was totally irresponsible.\\" TWA 800 flightpath after explosion Ray Lahr Another proponent of the U.S. Navy shootdown theory and prominent critic of the zoom climb scenario was H. Ray Lahr, a retired United Airlines pilot. Lahr, recipient of the Laura Taber Barbour Air Safety Award by the Flight Safety Foundation in 1994,Flight Safety Foundation: The Laura Taber Barbour Air Safety Award filed a Freedom of Information Act (FOIA) suit in U.S. District Court, Central District of California, Western Division, on November 6, 2003, against the NTSB and CIA. Freedom of Information Advocacy Coalition, Inc. Lahr sought documentation and data denied to him through previous FOIA requests that the NTSB and CIA used for their calculations of the zoom climb, which was used to produce the CIA animation. When asked for his reasons for seeking this documents, Lahr stated \\"I believe that I could show that the zoom climb never happened. If the zoom climb never happened then they've got to find out what the eyewitnesses saw and the only logical conclusion there is that they saw a missile.\\" ABC 7 Eyewitness News: \\"Major court ruling in TWA Flight 800 case\\" On August 31, 2006, the District Court issued an initial ruling that the evidence submitted by Lahr as justification for his FOIA lawsuit was \\"sufficient for the plaintiff to proceed based on his claim that the government acted improperly,\\" United States District Court, Central District of California, Case No. CV 03-8023 AHM (RZx) and that Lahr should be granted access to some, but not all, of the documents he was seeking, based on the FOIA statutes and case law. In a further ruling on October 4, 2006, the court finalized the list of documents that the NTSB and CIA must provide to Lahr (again granting some, but not all, of his FOIA requests). United States District Court, Central District of California, Case No. CV 03-8023 AHM (AJWx) While the court reaffirmed its previous ruling that Lahr had provided proof \\"sufficient to suggest that the government acted improperly\\", it also clarified that this \\"conclusion is based on a characterization of the evidence in a light most favorable to the plaintiff, but does not reflect or constitute any finding by the court.\\" Upon being handed this verdict by the court, the agencies involved claimed the documents had been \\"lost\\" and could not be located, according to the plaintiff. Bolide strike A theory was posited in 1997 by Michael Davis, an American amateur geologist, that a bolide exploded near the airplane. A bolide is a large meteoroid, explosively torn apart as it hits the atmosphere. Davis proposed that the mysterious streak observed just before the explosion was the meteoroid's entry path, moments before it blew apart. At least one of the resulting pieces of the exploding meteoroid could have penetrated the fuselage and ripped through the almost empty central wing tank, destroying the wing's structural integrity before exiting the other side. \\"The damage to the CWT seems to start at the center and work its way forward along a discernible path. A fuel explosion would radiate damage in all directions.\\" The vapor in the fuel tank could have ignited due to the searing heat produced by the bolide's high velocity. Other data appear to fit the hypothesis; the sequence of multiple sonic booms heard by witnesses onshore could be explained by the explosion and subsequent scattering of the heavier bolide remnants; the estimated 200 holes in the fuselage (cited in FBI report) could be indicative of metal cut by objects traveling at extremely high speed. Although raising an interesting possibility, other scientists dismissed this theory due to the extremely low probability of a bolide's intersecting the aircraft's flight path at precisely the required moment.Air & Space/Smithsonian, October/November 1997, p. 16 \\"Was It a Cosmic Catastrophe?\\" Electromagnetic interference On April 9, 1998, Elaine Scarry's article in The New York Review of Books, titled \\"The Fall of TWA 800: The Possibility of Electromagnetic Interference\\", was published. Scarry, a professor of English and American Literature and Language at Harvard, proposed that electromagnetic interference, also referred to as \\"High Intensity Radiated Fields\\" (HIRF), could have been the cause of the TWA 800 crash, specifically energy emitted from a U.S. military craft. \\"The Fall of TWA 800: The Possibility of Electromagnetic Interference\\" Elaine Scarry, The New York Review of Books, April 9, 1998 Later that year, The New York Review of Books published a series of letters between Scarry and NTSB Chairman James Hall discussing the possibility of HIRF being causal to the accident, and what steps the NTSB was taking in its investigation to determine if it was a factor. \\"An Exchange on TWA 800\\" Elaine Scarry, The New York Review of Books, July 16, 1998 \\"TWA 800: A Second Exchange\\" Elaine Scarry, The New York Review of Books, August 13, 1998 After the adoption of the final report, Scarry published another article in the New York Review of Books titled \\"TWA 800 and Electromagnetic Interference: Work Already Completed and Work that Still Needs to be Done\\". \\"TWA 800 and Electromagnetic Interference: Work Already Completed and Work that Still Needs to be Done\\" Elaine Scarry, The New York Review of Books, October 5, 2000 While praising the initial research done by the NTSB into HIRFs, she also stated that much more additional research was needed. Scarry criticized what she felt was a bias in the investigation to the \\"meticulous\\" detailing of events inside the airplane, while not fully exploring the electromagnetic environment outside the airplane. Scarry focused on a U.S. Navy P-3 Orion close to TWA 800 as being a possible source of electromagnetic interference and cause of the CWT explosion on TWA 800. Scarry has since written about Swissair Flight 111 and EgyptAir Flight 990 crashes in connection with electromagnetic radiation. \\"Swissair 111, TWA 800, and Electromagnetic Interference\\" Elaine Scarry, The New York Review of Books, September 21, 2000 \\"THE FALL OF EGYPTAIR 990\\" Elaine Scarry, The New York Review of Books, October 5, 2000 Dissenting views from the investigation IAMAW As an invited party to the NTSB investigation, the International Association of Machinists and Aerospace Workers (IAMAW) submitted a report into the public docket. In this report the IAMAW disputed the NTSB's sequencing study, and proposed a breakup sequence that started on the lower left side of the airplane, when a high-pressure event \\"unzipped\\" the fuselage.International Association of Machinists and Aerospace Workers: ANALYSIS AND RECOMMENDATIONS REGARDING T.W.A. FLIGHT 800 The IAMAW wrote that \\"a major event may have occurred on the left side of the aircraft. It could have contributed to or been the cause of the destruction of Flight 800.\\" and that \\"the CWT exploded, but as a result of the airplane's breakup, and was not the initial event.\\" The IAMAW criticized the accuracy of the \\"Tag database\\" used to document the recovered wreckage and the reliability of the witness statements. The IAMAW strongly criticized the FBI's conduct during the investigation, including the undocumented removal by FBI agents of wreckage from the hangar where it was stored. However, they also commended the NTSB staff, management and board members for their cooperation during the investigation, and stated that \\"The fact the media has put and other groups continue to bring pressure on the board, we find it very comforting that the focus was not changed due to these forces.\\" They concluded that \\"The causes and circumstances that contributed directly to the accident are unknown.\\" William Donaldson William S. Donaldson, a retired Naval officer, formed the Associated Retired Aviation Professionals (ARAP) to investigate the TWA 800 crash. He authored the \\"Interim Report on the Crash of TWA Flight 800 and the Actions of the NTSB and the FBI\\" (the \\"Donaldson Report\\"), which was released on July 17, 1998, two years before the NTSB's Final Report. In it, Donaldson stated that TWA 800 was struck by two missiles, fired from the water, most likely as a terrorist attack, and subsequently the FBI and NTSB conspired to cover up this fact due to political pressure. Interim Report on the Crash of TWA Flight 800 and the Actions of the NTSB and the FBI Donaldson disputed the CWT fuel-air vapor explosion scenario, stating that \\"In the history of aviation, there has never been an in-flight explosion in any Boeing airliner of a Jet-A kerosene fuel vapor/air mixture in any tank, caused by mechanical failure.\\" Eyewitness, debris field, metallurgical, and victim injury evidence were all cited by Donaldson as proof of the missile-attack scenario. Donaldson acknowledged James Sanders' theory of an accidental shoot- down, and did not rule out U.S. Navy involvement; however, he viewed circumstantial evidence of a terrorist attack \\"more compelling\\". Much of the report dealt with Donaldson's assertions of a conspired cover-up by the FBI and NTSB, in co-operation with the Justice Department. Donaldson believed that the Clinton Administration wanted to hide the actual cause of the crash for political reasons, specifically the upcoming presidential elections. Donaldson concluded his report with the request that Congress hold Congressional hearings into the crash and/or request that the Justice Department appoint an Independent Counsel to investigate (neither of which happened). Donaldson received support and funding from the advocacy group Accuracy in Media, which promoted his views. He died in 2001; the ARAP Web site is still active. Documentary On July 17, 2013, the 17th anniversary of the tragedy, the Epix premium TV channel aired the documentary TWA Flight 800, directed by Kristina Borjesson, which alleges that the crash investigation was a cover-up. The film highlights extensive eyewitness interviews, with many interviewees directly objecting to publicly described versions of their own descriptions of events. It also highlights interviews with investigators who had been involved in the original inquest, six of whom had filed a petition to reopen the probe. Their petition was based on eyewitness accounts, radar evidence indicating a possible missile and claims of evidence tampering. They dubbed it \\"The TWA 800 Project\\". Former NTSB investigator Henry Hughes has been quoted that he believes a bomb or a missile caused the crash.

The two men were later convicted and sentenced to twelve and seven years in prison, respectively. In Danish, it became known as the \\"terror case from Glasvej\\" (Terrorsagen fra Glasvej) after the road where the convicted ringleader had his apartment, which had been under surveillance for an extended period of time before the arrests. It is unknown if the target of the planned bombing was in Denmark or abroad. Police, accompanied by bomb experts, initially arrested 11 men and searched their homes. Most were released after questioning, but two were charged and later convicted. The prosecutors described the two as militant islamists with direct connections to Al-Qaeda. Arrestees The two men against whom charges were pressed were Hammad Khürshid, a 21-year-old man of Pakistani ethnicity, and Abdoulghani Tokhi, a man of Afghan origin aged between 18 and 20. Six others were released after questioning.  Investigation  The suspects had been under surveillance for an extended period of time and the arrests were the result of a months-long investigation. After the arrests it was announced that Matas, Denmark largest drug store chain, is co-operating with domestic Security Intelligence Service to keep tabs on the sale of substances that can be used to make bombs for terrorist attacks. Sales of more than two containers of the substances on a list compiled to any one customer is registered by the shop's employees on a special form. The information is then passed on to the police. Matas has instituted the new rules at all its 292 shops across the country. Charges The suspects were arraigned on charges of planning a terrorist attack and accused of storing unstable explosives, possibly TATP. Trial The Danish court in Glostrup convicted Khürshid and Tokhi of attempted terrorism and sentenced them to twelve and seven years in prison, respectively, in October 2008. Khürshid was considered the ringleader, resulting in his higher sentence. The court said during sentencing that Tokhi, who only had a Danish residence permit (Khürshid is a Danish citizen), would be expelled after serving his sentence. During the trial, prosecutors said Khürshid had links to Al Qaeda. During searches of his home in Denmark, police found a handwritten bomb-making manual written by Khürshid while at the pro- Taliban Lal Masjid, the so-called Red Mosque in Islamabad during the winter and spring of 2007. Khürshid admitted he later went to the Taliban-controlled Waziristan region, but denies receiving any military training there. Khürshid and Tokhi pleaded innocent saying that the explosives were to be used for fireworks. It was not clear whether Khürshid and Tokhi were preparing an attack in Denmark or abroad. On Friday June 26, 2009, the Østre Landsret upheld the convictions of both Khürshid and Tohki.  Deportation  As Tokhi was an Afghan citizen, he was deported home to Afghanistan after serving his sentence. Tokhi commentedf from Kabul that \\"the prison in Denmark was luxury comparing to being here alone\\".

As of today, it is mainly marketed and sold in Argentina, Brazil and Venezuela, but in the 1950s-1960s it was sold as a canned beverage and marketed towards residents of the United States, especially at drive-in movie theaters where it was advertised with the cartoon mascot \\"Rodeo Joe\\". History Toddy advertisement on a Lisbon tram in 1969. Toddy was established in 1930 by Puerto Rican Pedro Erasmo Santiago combining the characteristics of two drinks: the Scotch Toddy (an egg yolk base of egg, honey, cream and whisky) and the Caribbean Rum Toddy, (a base of cacao, molasses and rum). On March 15, 1933, Pedro Erasmo Santiago was licensed by the provisory government of Getúlio Vargas to commercialize the product in Brazil. He created innovative advertising campaigns, including skywriting the product name over the skies of Rio de Janeiro. In the 1940s, Toddy began production in Venezuela, where it is still a very popular beverage. Pedro Erasmo Santiago also commenced production of Toddy in Argentina, Portugal, Spain, and distributed the product in the Caribbean islands of Dominican Republic and Cuba. He also ventured into food processing activities, including fruit juices under the trademark Yukery. In Brazil the juice was called Yuky and in Venezuela Yukery. As result of this venture into juice production, in the 1950s Pedro Erasmo Santiago established the largest orange juice processing and juice concentrate facility in the world, Suconasa, today Cutrale, established in Brazil. After his death on February 8th 1966, his youngest son, Erasmo Julian Santiago Mejia, (August 12th 1936-February 12, 2008) took over the operations, later selling the companies in Venezuela due to pressure from the national government and banks in 1986. The trademark was acquired by PepsiCo in 2001. PepsiCo updated the brand's logo to a star and three cows. In 2009, PepsiCo introduced Toddy in Australia, and the following year in Chile.

The Via Labicana led from Rome to Labicum, while the Via Latina ended at Capua. In the Middle Age, Capua was depopulated and the main settlement shifted to Casilinum, formerly a mere fluvial port. This is also the location of the modern town of Capua. As a consequence, the union of the Via Latina and of the Via Labicana took on the new namesake of Via Casilina.

Chic's title track stalled at number 80 on the US Pop chart, but was a Top 20 hit on the R&B; singles chart, peaking at number 14, making it their best R&B; chart entry since 1980s \\"Rebels Are We\\". \\"Why\\" with vocals by Carly Simon was only moderately successful on its initial release in the US (Pop No. 74, September 1982), tbut he song turned out to be a surprise hit in Europe, where it reached number 10 on the singles charts in the UK. Later, the extended 12\\" remix—featuring additional vocals by Chic's Alfa Anderson and Luci Martin—also became something of an underground club classic in the US. The Soup for One album also includes Chic's one and only collaboration with legendary soul singer Teddy Pendergrass, the ballad \\"Dream Girl\\". Pendergrass had a cameo role as a nightclub singer performing the song in the movie, although it was however never issued as a single.

However, although the Mongol forces were smaller than the Mamluk army, there were the Georgians and Rum Seljuks that bolstered their numbers. The battle The Mongols attacked first and charged the Mamluk heavy cavalry. At the start of the battle many of the Bedouin irregulars in the Mamluk army were also killed. Their attack was concentrated on the left flank of the Mamluk army. This resulted in the Sultan's standard bearers (sanjaqiyya) being killed. The Mamluks however were able to regroup and launch a counter-attack. Baibars himself went with a few troops to deal with the Mongol right flank that was pounding his left flank.Ibn Taghri, Al-Zahir Baibars Baibars ordered a force from the army from Hama to reinforce his left. The large Mamluk numbers were able to overwhelm the Mongol force. The Mongols instead of retreating dismounted from their horses. Some Mongols were able to escape and took up positions on the hills. Once they became surrounded they once again dismounted, and fought to the death.Al-Maqrizi,p. 99/vol.2 During the battle, the Mongols destroyed the Mamluk left wing, consisting of many Bedouin irregulars, but were ultimately defeated. It seems that both sides were expecting assistance from the army of the Pervâne and his Seljuks. The Pervâne had attempted to ally himself with both factions to keep his options open, but fled the battle with the Seljuk Sultan to Tokat. The Seljuk army was present near the battle, but did not take part. After the battle many Rumi soldiers were taken captive. Others joined the Mamluks willingly. Pervane's son Muhadhdhab al-Din was captured. In addition many Mongol officers and common soldiers were taken prisoner. Two of the soldiers captured, Qipchaq and Salar, would become mamluks of Qalawun and would become very important amirs. The Mongol officers' lives were spared as well. Aftermath After Baibars victory, he marched unopposed to Kayseri (Qaysariyya) in the heart of Anatolia in triumph and entered it on April 23, 1277; just over a month after the battle. The Muslim festival of Eid al-Adha happened around this time. In this festival, Baibars forbade the beating of drums of good tidings telling his emirs: \\"How can I rejoice? I had believed that if 10,000 horsemen of my army were to meet 30,000 Mongols, I would defeat them. But I met 7000 Mongols with all my army. The Mongols aroused panic and my army lost heart. The Mongols defeated the Muslim Left. Without Allah's grace, they would have defeated us. If I met them, and they were equal to the Muslims in size, or larger than they, then the matter would not have turned out well\\". Following the festival, Baibars left Rum and died in Syria soon after. In light of Baibar's victory Pervâne attempted to draw in the Mamluks into a confrontation with a fresh Mongol army led by Abaqa himself. However, Baibars was running low on supplies, and his equipment repaired. The possibility of a new Mongol army convinced Baibars to return to Syria since he was so far away from his bases and supply line. As the Mamluk army returned to Syria the commander of the Mamluk vanguard, Izz al-Din Aybeg al-Shaykhi deserted to the Mongols. Pervâne sent a letter to Baibars asking him to delay his departure. Baibars chastised him for not aiding him during the Battle of Elbistan. Baibars told him he was leaving for Siwas to mislead Pervâne and the Mongols to his true destination. Baibars also sent Taybars al-Waziri with a force to rain an Armenian town called al-Rummana, whose inhabitants had hidden the Mongols earlier. The Mongol Ilkhan Abaqa, meanwhile reasserted his authority in Rum. After Abaqa surveyed the battlefield he became very angry. He ordered the Muslim population of Kayseri (Qaysariyya) and eastern Rum to be put to death. Large numbers of people were killed. Abaqa's army had to put down a rebellion of Qaramanid Turkmen who declared their loyalty to Baibars. He sent an army of 30,000 towards Syria, but after learning the size of Baibars army from Aybeg al-Shaykhi he called his forces back. He wanted to send the army in the summer but his officers persuaded him to wait until the winter. However, the expedition was never sent. The Ilkhan Mongols were having logistical problems of their own and many of the troops were called back to Ilkhanate lands. Abaqa entrusted the country to his other brother Qonghurtai and Shams al-Din Juwayni. At first Abaqa turned a blind eye to Pervâne. The Mongol nobles and noblewomen convinced him to have him put to death. Pervâne's flesh was eaten by Abaqa and the senior Mongols as an act of revenge according to King Het'um of Armenia.Het'um, 2:180 During the celebration of victory, Baybars said that \\"How can I be happy. I thought that I and my servants would defeat Mongols before, but my left wing was beaten by them. Only Allah helped us\\".

Although Chinese architectural history reaches far back in time, descriptions of Chinese architecture are often confined to the well known Forbidden City with little else explored by the West. Although common features of Chinese architecture have been unified into a vocabulary illustrating uniquely Chinese forms and methods, until recently data has not been available. Because of the lack of knowledge of the roots of Chinese architecture, description of its elements is often translated into Western terms and architectural theory, losing its unique Chinese meanings. A cause of this deficiency is that the two most important Chinese government architecture manuals, the Song Dynasty Yingzao Fashi and Qing Architecture Standards have never being translated into any western language. Historical records Ancient Chinese architecture has numerous similar elements in part, because of the early Chinese method of standardizing and prescribing uniform features of structures. The standards are recorded in bureaucratic manuals and drawings that were passed down through generations and dynasties. These account for the similar architectural features persisting over thousands of years, starting with the earliest evidence of Chinese imperial urbanism, now available through excavations starting in the early 1980s. The plans include, for example, two- dimensional architectural drawings as early as the first millennium AD, and explain the strong tendency for the shared architectural features in Chinese architecture, that evolved through a complicated but unified evolutionary process over the millennia. Generations of builders and craftsmen recorded their work and the collectors who collated the information into building standards (for example Yingzao Fashi) and Qing Architecture Standards were widely available, in fact strictly mandated, and passed down. The recording of architectural practice and details facilitated a transmission throughout the subsequent generations of the unique system of construction that became a body of unique architectural characteristics. More recently, the dependence on text for archaeological descriptions has yielded to the realization that archaeological excavations by the People's Republic of China provides better evidence of Chinese daily life and ceremonies from the Neolithic times to the more recent centuries. For example, the excavation of tombs has provided evidence to produce facsimiles of wooden building parts and yielded site plans several thousand years old. The recent excavation of the Prehistoric Beifudi site is an example. Three components make up the foundation of ancient Chinese architecture: the foundation platform, the timber frame, and the decorative roof. In addition, the most fundamental feature is a four-sided rectangular enclosure, that is, structures with walls that are formed at right angles and oriented cardinally. The traditional Chinese belief in a square-shaped universe with the four world quarters is manifested physically in its architecture. Rammed earth sections of the Great Wall of China Structural features Foundation platform By the middle Neolithic period, the use of rammed earth and unbaked mud bricks was prevalent. Hangtu (loess), the pounding of layers of earth to make walls, altars, and foundations remained an element of Chinese construction for the next several millennia. The Great Wall of China, built of Hangtu, was erected beginning in the first millennium BC. Sundried mud bricks and rammed mud walls were typically constructed within wood frames. Hard pounded earth floors were strengthened by heating. Timber frame Sliding dovetail, lap dovetail and stepped bevel splice joints of tie beams and cross beams from the Yingzao Fashi, published in 1103 by the Song Dynasty Chinese scholar-bureaucrat Li Jie (1065-1110). A fundamental achievement of Chinese wooden architecture is the load-bearing timber frame, a network of interlocking wooden supports forming the skeleton of the building. This is considered China's major contribution to worldwide architectural technology. However, it is not known how the builders got the huge wooden support columns into position. Unlike western architecture, in ancient Chinese wooden architecture, the wall only defined an enclosure, and did not form a load-bearing element. Buildings in China have been supported by wooden frames for as long as seven millennia. The emergence of the characteristic articulated wooden Chinese frame emerged during the Neolithic period. Seven thousand years ago mortise and tenon joinery was used to build wood-framed houses. (The oldest are at Hemudu site at Zhejiang). Over a thousand of these sites have been identified, usually with circular, square or oblong shaped buildings. During the Yangshao culture in the Middle Neolithic, circular and rectangular semisubterranean structures are found with wooden beams and columns. Wooden beams or earth supported the roofs which were most likely thatched. As the villages and towns grew they adhered to symmetrical shapes. Symmetry was also important in the layout of homes, altars, and villages. In traditional Chinese architecture, every facet of a building was decorated using various materials and techniques. Simple ceiling ornamentations in ordinary buildings were made of wooden strips and covered with paper. More decorative was the lattice ceiling, constructed of woven wooden strips or sorghum stems fastened to the beams. Dougong is a unique structural element of interlocking wooden brackets, one of the most important elements in traditional Chinese architecture. It first appeared in buildings of the last centuries BC and evolved into a structural network that joined pillars and columns to the frame of the roof. Dougong was widely used in the Spring and Autumn period (770-476 BC) and developed into a complex set of interlocking parts by its peak in the Tang and Song periods. Since ancient times when the Chinese first began to use wood for building, joinery has been a major focus and craftsmen cut the wooden pieces to fit so perfectly that no glue or fasteners were necessary. Diagram of three corbel wood bracket sets (\\"Dougong\\") from the building manual Yingzao Fashi Roof and ceiling In traditional Chinese architecture, every facet of a building was decorated using various materials and techniques. Simple ceiling ornamentations in ordinary buildings were made of wooden strips and covered with paper. More decorative was the lattice ceiling, constructed of woven wooden strips or sorghum stems fastened to the beams. Because of the intricacy of its ornamentation, elaborate cupolas were reserved for the ceilings of the most important structures, such as tombs and altars, although it is not clear what the spiritual beliefs of the early Chinese were, as altars appear to have served as burial sites. In traditional Chinese architecture, the layered pieces of the ceiling are held together by interlocking bracket sets (斗拱 dǒugǒng). Elaborate wooden coffers (藻井 zǎojǐng) bordered by a round, square, or polygon frame with its brackets projecting inward and upward from its base were used around the 7th century. Deeply recessed panels shaped like a well (square at the base with a rounded top) were fitted into the ceiling's wooden framework. The center panel of the ceiling was decorated with water lilies or other water plants. The relationship of the name to water has been linked to an ancient fear that wooden buildings would be destroyed by fire and that water from the zǎojǐng would prevent or quell the fire's flames. The tomb of Empress Dowager Wenming of the Northern Wei Dynasty has a coffer in the flat- topped, vaulted ceiling in the back chamber of her tomb. The Baoguo Temple in Yuyao in Zhejiang has three cupolas in the ceiling, making it unique among surviving examples of Song architecture. Sanqing Hall (Hall of the Three Purities) is the only Yuan period structure with three cupolas in its ceiling. Notes * Chinese Architecture * Chinese Imperial Planning.

Overview As much as 35% of truck miles travelled on Germany’s motorways (Autobahnen) are generated by foreign lorries (UK Commission for Integrated Transport, 2007). Facing increased pressure from freight traffic passing through and needing an additional source of revenue for motorway maintenance and expansion, in January 2005 Germany implemented a distance- based toll for all lorries of more than twelve tonnes gross weight (later reduced to 7.5 tonnes) using the motorways (Autobahnen). The motorway freight tolling was authorized by the Motorway Toll Act for Heavy Goods Vehicles (introduced on 12 April 2002) and the Toll Regulation (Toll Collect, 2007). Administration The toll is based on the route and the pollution class of the vehicle, its weight and the number of axles. Certain vehicles, such as emergency vehicles and buses, are exempt from the toll. An average user is charged € 0.15 per kilometre, or about $0.31 per mile (Toll Collect, 2007). Automatic log-on Toll Collect oversees the toll collection on behalf of the Federal Republic of Germany (Toll Collect, 2007). Toll Collect has developed an automatic log-on system for truckers, based on a combination of GSM and GPS. To take advantage of the automatic log-on, lorry drivers are required to register the freight company as well as each individual lorry. After registration an on-board unit (OBU) can be installed by an authorized Toll-Collect partner. The OBU automatically determines the distance travelled on the toll route, calculates the toll based on vehicle class and toll rate information entered and transmits the information to the Toll-Collect centre for processing via GSM (cellular) communication (Richards, 2006). Once the toll information has been submitted to the Toll-Collect centre a bill is generated and e-mailed to the driver or owner of the lorry. The German government paid for the approximately 450,000 OBUs currently in use and lorry drivers were responsible for covering their installation (UK Commission for Integrated Transport 2007). Manual log-on Alternatively lorry drivers who rarely use German toll roads can log-on manually at one of 3,500 toll station terminals or over the internet. The log-on to a toll station terminal, located near motorway access ramps, is similar to purchasing a ticket. The driver enters the vehicle information, starting point and destination. The toll station calculates the fees based on the shortest route within the toll road network. As of December 2006 90% of the lorries on German roads paid the toll automatically. In 2006 the toll-collection rate for automatic transactions was 99.75% (Toll Collect, 2007). Toll-collect gantry on the A65 Enforcement The system enforcement is based on 300 gantries equipped with infrared detection equipment and high-resolution cameras (able to identify the license plates of lorries). Owing to the large volume of data generated by these gantries, not all of the gantries installed are in operation at the same time. Only selected gantries are in operation and able to identify vehicles for which the toll has not been paid. In addition Federal Officers of Freight in 300 mobile enforcement vehicles patrol the motorways and are authorized to pull lorries over and check for payment records. If a fee has not been paid and the GPS data is unclear a charge for 500 km of travel is imposed. The collection costs are estimated at 20 per cent of gross revenues. During the first eight months of operation of the scheme 11.6 million lorries were checked for violation, with a resulting violation rate of less than 2% (Richards, 2006; UK Commission for Integrated Transport, 2007). Results Toll revenues in excess of system operating costs provide funding for transport infrastructure improvements (Richards, 2006). The scheme has provided freight companies with an incentive to purchase vehicles with lower emission rates. The UK Commission for Integrated Transport (2007) cites a 6% decrease in the number of empty runs and a 6% shift to rail from road freight mode as a result of implementing the system. Those factors are likely to lower the emissions of carbon dioxide and other pollutants on German roads. The only negative consequence of the freight toll system detected thus far has been the rerouting of some trucks off the motorways onto other roads, resulting in additional noise and congestion on those routes (UK Commission for Integrated Transport, 2007).

In China's attempt to shake the early 1990s European male dominance of the sport - where players such as Saive (Belgium), Primorac (Croatia), Gatien (France), Waldner, Persson and Appelgren (Sweden), and Rosskopf (Germany) were dominating proceedings internationally, they sent the young Kong to Sweden in an unprecedented move to learn the European style of play. He arrived back in China in 1993, and within three years, was ranked world no.1 as of December 1995. Kong is considered one of the all-time greats of table tennis and has now taken up position as Head Coach of China's National Women's Team. Controversy In May 2017, Kong is being sued by Marina Bay Sands in Singapore, for failing to repay fully a sum of S$1 million, which he borrowed from the hotel's casino in February 2015, according to High Court of the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region. The court writ said, Kong signed a credit agreement to borrow S$1 million from the operator. He had since repaid S$545,625, but failed to offset the balance in full, leaving S$454,375 unpaid. After this event, Kong responded on Weibo, that he was in Singapore with his parents, family and friends. He had sat and observed gambling, helped them collect some gambling chips and leave a relevant personal message at the hotel casino. The Chinese Table Tennis Association said Kong's coaching of the national women's table tennis team post was suspended, and ordered him to return from the World Table Tennis Championships in Germany, as it investigates the allegations.

Nothing was done to refurbish it until the late 1990s, when the city sold it to Orange County for a dollar and the county's former courthouse. The county brought in Robert Carchietta's Gemma Development to restore it. The project won the Commissioner's Annual Private Sector Achievement Award from Bernadette Castro, then-commissioner of the New York State Office of Parks, Recreation and Historic Preservation.

For example, while many cultures differ as to what, exactly, is \\"murder\\", all cultures take it as wrong to commit murder. An example of ethical extensionism would be to extend to dogs or cats the status of being something that can be murdered, so that it would be wrong under some circumstances to kill a dog or cat. On the one hand, ethical extensionism is a broadening of the class of things to which humans may owe an ethical duty. But Des Jardins makes the point that most ethical extensionism has been merely broadening the ethical sphere incrementally, a process not agreeable to some environmental ethicists who would prefer more of a total replacement of traditional ethics with an entirely new approach. So, while ethical extensionism can, in principle, broaden the sphere of ethical standing to any arbitrary limits, the extensionist approach is seen by more recent ethical theorists as being inadequate.

She is responsible for the design of a viable full-scale solar sail and the development and testing of a scale model solar sail at NASA Langley Research Center in Virginia. Early years Reaves was born and raised in Puerto Rico, where she received her primary and secondary education. She enrolled at the University of Puerto Rico at Mayaguez, where she obtained a bachelor of science degree in Mechanical Engineering. She continued her graduate education in the Old Dominion University. Career in NASA During her career in NASA, Reaves has been involved in the research on modeling and validation of smart structures, the implementation of probabilistic analysis tools for dynamic model updates, simulation of ground-induced vibration of the HSCT (High Speed Civil Transport) as it traversed a typical runway and experiments to determine static and dynamic properties of advanced aircraft tires.Latina Women in NASA On August 2001, Reaves participated in a flight experiment called the Aero- structures Test Wing (ATW), conducted at NASA's Dryden Flight Research Center in Edwards, California. The experiment successfully demonstrated a new software data analysis tool, the flutterometer, which is designed to increase the efficiency of flight flutter testing. The experiment consisted of an 18-inch carbon fiber test wing with surface-mounted piezoelectric strain actuators. The test wing was mounted on a special ventral flight test fixture and flown on Dryden's F-15B Research Testbed aircraft. At each Mach number and altitude, stability estimations of the wing were made using accelerometer measurements in response to the piezoelectric actuator excitation. Placement of the piezoelectric actuators was determined by Reaves to maximize their effectiveness. Piezoelectric actuators are devices that produce a small displacement with a high force capability when voltage is applied.About Piezoelectric Actuators The actuators were moved at different magnitudes and frequency levels to induce wing vibrations and excite the dynamics during flight. The ATW experiment represents the first time that piezoelectric actuators were used during a flight flutter test.Experiment Demonstrates Improved Test Method Current position Solar Sail She is currently the Research Engineer assigned to the Structural Dynamics Branch in the Structures and Materials Competency. As such, she conducts analytical and experimental research on vibration and dynamics of complex aerospace structures both individually and as a team member. This work requires application of state of the art advanced analytical methods to predict the dynamic response of complex aircraft and spacecraft configurations and validation of improved methodologies by correlating predicted results with experimental data from laboratory investigations In her current assignment, she is responsible for the design of a viable full-scale solar sail and the development and testing of a scale model solar sail. She must select and apply tools to analyze complex thin film structures characterized by wrinkling, geometric and material nonlinear behavior. She is also responsible for planning experimental studies to validate analytical techniques and study solar sails dynamics.Reaves Publications Among the technical reports which she has co-authored are: *Finite-element-analysis model and preliminary ground testing of controls-structures interaction evolutionary model reflector (1992), Report Number: L-17009, NAS 1.154293, NASA-TM-4293 *Dynamics and control of a large displacement suspension system for ground testing of flexible space structures (1992), Report Number: AIAA PAPER 92-1178 *Langley's CSI evolutionary model Phase 2 (1995), Report Number: NAS 1.15109059, NASA-TM-109059, NIPS-95-06374 *Aeroservoelastic and Structural Dynamics Research on Smart Structures Conducted at NASA Langley Research Center (1997), Document ID: 20040110282 *Aeroservoelastic and Structural Dynamics Research on Smart Structures Conducted at NASA Langley Research Center (1998), Report Number: Paper 3316-21 *Taxiing, Take-Off, and Landing Simulation of the High Speed Civil Transport Aircraft (1999), Report Number: L-17901, NAS 1.15209531, NASA TM-1999-209531 *Test Cases for Modeling and Validation of Structures with Piezoelectric Actuators (2001), Report Number: AIAA Paper 2001-1466 *A Probabilistic Approach to Model Update (2001), Report Number: L-18097, NAS 1.15211039, NASA TM-2001-211039 *Test cases for modeling and validation of structures with piezoelectric actuators (2001) *Ground and Flight Test Structural Excitation Using Piezoelectric Actuators (2002), Report Number: AIAA Paper 2002-1349, H-2482, NAS 1.15210724, NASA TM-2002-210724 *Piezoelectric Actuator Modeling Using MSC NASTRAN and MATLAB (2003), Report Number: L-19005, NAS 1.15212651, NASA TM-2003-212651 *Model Update of a Micro Air Vehicle (MAV) Flexible Wing Frame with Uncertainty Quantification (2004), Report Number: NASA TM-2004-213232 *On the Application of a Response Surface Technique to Analyze Roll-over Stability of Capsules with Airbags Using LS-Dyna (2008) *Ares I-X Flight Test Vehicle Modal Test (2010) *Ares I-X Launch Vehicle Modal Test Overview (2010) *Multi-Dimensional Calibration of Impact Dynamic Models (2011) *Orion crew module landing system simulation and verification (2011) See also *List of Puerto Ricans *Puerto Rican scientists and inventors *List of Puerto Ricans in the United States Space Program *University of Puerto Rico at Mayaguez people *History of women in Puerto Rico References External links * Category:Puerto Rican scientists Category:Living people Category:Year of birth missing (living people) Category:NASA people Category:Puerto Rican women scientists ","title":"Mercedes Reaves"},{"id":"13094798","text":"Hillesheim is a former Verbandsgemeinde (\\"collective municipality\\") in the district Vulkaneifel, in Rhineland-Palatinate, Germany.

Brown, lyrics by Lee Adams, and music by Charles Strouse. The Broadway production closed after 14 previews and only one performance on December 21, 1978. The plot about a sleazy white theatre producer's attempt to adapt an African-American writer's serious play as a commercial stage musical was inspired by Adams and Strouse's real-life experiences with their 1964 Broadway production of Golden Boy. The star of the musical-within-the-musical (Sneakers, about a basketball star) closely resembles Golden Boy star Sammy Davis, Jr. When the star opts to leave the show, the playwright – who from the start had resisted turning his work into a musical – steps in and takes on the lead role in order to save the production. Background and production The creators hoped that the backstage story about the making of a musical would cash in on the success of A Chorus Line as well as the popularity of the black-themed musical, including Brown's own The Wiz, which was still running at the time. But Brown's much- criticized book is a clichéd spoof of show business lawyers, idealistic young playwrights, glitzy Las Vegas performers, blue-haired matinée ladies, and the black-themed musical itself. The Wiz proved to be Brown's only success.Gilvey, John Anthony. Before the Parade Passes by: Gower Champion and the Glorious American Musical.

Geology Chilcomb lies within the heart of the Winchester anticline, an up-fold in the rocks with older beds exposed in the centre. This is surrounded by outcrops of successively younger beds forming an enclosing ring of steep hills broken only by the Itchen Valley. In the centre a valley running east–west from Chilcomb to Bar End lies on the Zig Zag Chalk formation, grey chalk of Cenomanian age. This is surrounded successively by narrow, elliptical belts of the much harder Holywell Nodular Chalk, the New Pit Chalk (forming St. Catherine's Hill) and the Lewes Nodular Chalk, forming the peaks of Twyford Down and Deacon hill to the south, Winchester's West Hill and Sleepers Hill to the west, Magdalen Hill Down to the north and Telegraph Hill to the east.

The family name comes from a Georgian courtier title of amirejibi (derived from Arabic: amir, أمير + hajib, الحاجب) that was hereditary in one of the Palavandishvili lines and roughly corresponded to the office of Lord Great Chamberlain. History The Amirejibi were in the immediate circles of the ruling Bagrationi dynasty. For example, King Constantine I of Georgia (r. 1405-1412) married Natia, daughter of Kutsna Amirejibi, sometime ambassador to Constantinople. After the fragmentation of the Kingdom of Georgia into three independent kingdoms (Kartli, Kakheti, and Imereti), the family was confirmed in princely dignity by King Luarsab II of Kartli in 1613. After the Russian annexation of Georgia, the family was enlisted among the Russian noble houses as Princes Amiredzhibi (Амирэджиби) or Amiredzhibov (Амиреджибов) by the Tsar’s decree of February 2, 1824.Toumanoff, Cyril (1963), Studies in Christian Caucasian History, p. 270.

Plot A terrifying new serial killer begins stalking the streets of Boston, using his vast medical knowledge to systematically torture and kill vulnerable women, a modus operandi which has earned him the nickname \\"the Surgeon\\". As Jane Rizzoli, accompanied by detective Thomas Moore, works the case, she comes across trauma doctor Catherine Cordell, who almost died in the same fashion at the hands of another psychopath several years before, but killed him before he could kill her. Rizzoli soon establishes a connection between the two cases, concluding that she may be on the trail of a deranged copycat. The story opens up with the death of Elena Ortiz at the hands of the Surgeon, and Thomas Moore is sent to investigate. The murder is tied to another murder by the Surgeon, Diana Sterling, a year previous. Rizzoli and Moore note that both had no contact or connection whatsoever, and are perplexed by these two murders. Meanwhile, the Surgeon begins targeting his third victim, Nina Peyton, and Cordell continues to save lives, starting with Herman Gwadowski. The Surgeon is also starting to get closer and closer to Cordell, who is creating a romantic and sexual connection with Thomas Moore. In the end, Jane manages to save Cordell from the Surgeon, and Moore marries Cordell.

Pahaquarry Copper Mine adit, New Jersey, USA  Hazards  The term incorporates all types of old mines including underground shaft mines and drift mines, and surface mines including quarries and placer mining . Abandoned mines are found throughout the world. They contain many hazards to the unwary who venture around them, including: * Subsidence (collapsing ground) * Blasting caps and other undetonated explosives * Blackdamp accumulating in old mines, which can cause suffocation * Hidden mine shafts, often hidden beneath bushes and grasses and other vegetation that has grown up around the mine entrance * Unstable roofs and passageways, prone to cave-ins  Abandoned Mines in the United States   Definitions  *Department of the Interior - Bureau of Land Management - Abandoned mines are those mines that were abandoned prior to January 1, 1981, the effective date of the Bureau of Land Management's Surface Management regulations issued under authority of the Federal Land Policy and Management Act of 1976, as amended (43 U.S.C. 1701 et seq.) * Environmental Protection Agency - Abandoned mine lands (AMLs) are those lands, waters and surrounding watersheds where extraction, beneficiation or processing of ores and minerals has occurred. In the United States there are thousands of abandoned mines. The precise number of abandoned mines in the United States remains unknown, ranging \\"from the National Park Service's tally of 2,500 on its lands, to the Mineral Policy Center's assessment of 560,000 abandoned mines on public and privately owned lands.\\" Many of these abandoned mines are associated with abandoned neighboring towns often referred to as ghost towns. Experts strongly warn against entering or exploring old or abandoned mines. In California, Nevada, Colorado, New Mexico and Arkansas, there are over 6,500 abandoned mines according to infographic. Danger sign at an old Arizona mine. In the U.S., the estimation is that approximately 80% of the abandoned mine lands (AML) sites pose physical safety hazards and require more work in determining true safety of these lands. Every year, dozens are injured or killed in recreational accidents on mine property. The majority of the deaths are unrelated to mine exploration, however. Drownings in open quarries and ATV accidents on abandoned mine properties are the main cause of accidental death. The U.S. Department of Labor notes that since 1999, \\"more than 200 people have died in recreational accidents at surface and underground active and abandoned operations across the country.\\" Due to these circumstances, the Mine Safety and Health Administration launched the \\"Stay Out – Stay Alive\\" campaign, which is a national public awareness campaign aimed at warning and educating children and adults about the dangers of exploring and playing on active and abandoned mine sites. In the U.S., the Abandoned Mine Land Initiative, launched by the Western Governor's Association and the National Mining Association is also an effort focusing on reporting the number of high- priority AML sites. The initiative identifies, measures and reports on the progress of current reclamation cleanup programs on an annual basis. In the Americas region, the United Nations Environment Programme (UNEP) and the Chilean Copper Commission (COHILCO) co-hosted a workshop to address the problem of abandoned or \\"orphaned\\" mines. Including a representative from the UN, ten countries were represented from North, Central and South America with an eleventh participant being Japan.  Surface Mining Control and Reclamation Act (SMCRA)  It can be hazardous and detrimental to reside close to an abandoned coal mining site. The Surface Mining Control and Reclamation Act was passed in 1977 in two parts; one to control effects of active mines, and one to regulate abandoned mines. SMCRA also initiated an abandoned mine land fund, in which a fee was charged for each ton of coal produced. This revenue was distributed in part to the United Mine Workers Association (UMWA) towards retirement funds, as well as to the Office of Surface Mining Reclamation and Enforcement (OSMRE) to continue operations. There is still around $2 billion in funds that are undistributed thus far.  Abandoned Mines in Canada   Definitions  * National Orphaned/Abandoned Mines Initiative - Orphaned or abandoned mines are those mines for which the owner cannot be found or for which the owner is financially unable or unwilling to carry out clean-up. They pose environmental, health, safety and economic problems to communities, the mining industry and governments in many countries, including Canada. *The Ontario Mining Act describes \\"abandoned mines\\" as an old land previously used for coal mining but is now unused due to hazardous environmental and health effects.

Club career On 28 June 2015, Kavdanski signed a one-year contract with the most successful club in Albania, KF Tirana, taking the number 3 for the 2015–16 season. He became the third defender that was brought to Tirana during that summer, after Dritan Smajli and Ronald Gërçaliu. Kavdanski made his official debut with Tirana on 1 November in the match against Kukësi, featuring in the last 30 minutes of the 2–1 home win. Six days later he played only four minutes in another home win, this time against the newcomers of Tërbuni Pukë. Kavdanski started for the first time this season on 23 November in the match against Bylis Ballsh, helping the team to get a clean-sheet in a 0–1 away win. During the first part of the season he struggled to find minutes, but found it very hard, as he was not the among the first choices of coach Ilir Daja, who preferred the duo Muça-Karan instead. He appeared in only six matches in the league and the cup, and eventually left the team on 25 December 2015. Kavdanski spent the 2016–17 season at Lokomotiv Gorna Oryahovitsa; he left the club after his contract expired in June 2017. In July 2017, Kavdanski joined Clermont Foot.

Masterson (March 25, 1926—April 12, 2010) was a prominent American psychiatrist. He was an internationally recognized psychiatrist who helped inaugurate the study and treatment of personality disorder including borderline personality disorder and narcissistic personality disorder. He died April 12, 2010 of pneumonia at the age of eighty-four. Life Masterson was born March 25, 1926, in Elkins Park, Pennsylvania. His undergraduate studies at the University of Notre Dame were interrupted by Army service in World War II. After the war, he earned a medical degree from Jefferson Medical College in Philadelphia. He was long associated with the Payne Whitney Psychiatric Clinic in New York, serving as the head of its adolescent program in the 1960s and 1970s, where he developed his theory of borderline personality disorder. A psychiatrist and psychoanalyst, Masterson was a founding authority on the theory and treatment of borderline and narcissistic personality disorders, as well as the understanding of personality disorder in general. At his death, he was clinical professor emeritus of psychiatry at Weill Medical College of Cornell University. He was also the founder and director of the Masterson Group (for clinical treatment of personality disorder), as well as the Masterson Institute for Psychoanalytic Psychotherapy (later renamed the International Masterson Institute). Established in 1977, the I.M.I. still offers psychotherapeutic training at its headquarters in Manhattan and on the West Coast in San Francisco, as well as training and treatment at its branches in Vancouver, Istanbul, South Africa and Australia. Masterson was among the first to bring the psychoanalytic approach known as object relations theory, together with child development theory, to bear on the study of personality disorder. In so doing, he helped widen the lens through which disturbance in mental health is viewed, seeing beyond the classical Freudian approach, which is limited to neurotic symptomatology. In work he began in the mid-20th century, Masterson came to believe that the origin and treatment of personality disorders starts with understanding the formation of self and relationship that begins in the first three years of life—the so-called preOedipal period. During this time, the mother's loving support of the child's emerging self is critical for healthy psychic maturation. The psychoanalysts Otto F. Kernberg, Ronald Fairbairn, D.W. Winnicott and Heinz Kohut also played seminal roles in developing the concept of personality disorder. In line with stressing the importance of maternal availability, Masterson argued that the personality disorders crucially involve the conflict between a person's two \\"selves\\": the false self, which the very young child constructs to please the mother, and the real self. The psychotherapy of personality disorders is an attempt to put people back in touch with their real selves. Masterson, whose work also encompassed self theory as well as the neurobiology of personality disorders, was the author of many books. Among them are The Personality Disorders Through The Lens of Attachment Theory and the Neurobiologic Development of the Self (Zeig, Tucker & Theisen 2005), a clinical approach; The Search for the Real Self: Unmasking the Personality Disorders of Our Age (Free Press, Simon & Schuster 1988), written for a general readership; The Narcissistic and Borderline Disorders (Bruner/Mazel 1981); and The Psychiatric Dilemma of Adolescence (Little, Brown, 1967). A distinguished life fellow of the American Psychiatric Association, he was also a fellow of the American College of Psychoanalysts, a founder of the American Society of Adolescent Psychiatry and a past president of the society's New York chapter. Masterson became so well known as an expert on narcissism that he sometimes attracted patients for whom only a high-profile therapist would do — in other words, narcissists. In the 1980s, after The New York Times cited him as an authority on the disorder, he received a dozen calls from people wanting treatment. Too busy to accept new patients, Masterson referred the callers to his associates. As The Times reported in 1988, not a single one made an appointment. Borderline personality disorder Masterson founded his psychotherapeutic approach while facing the challenge of finding an effective way of working with an inpatient unit of acting-out adolescents. This was in the 1960s, when such patients were supposed to \\"grow out of it\\". Masterson, seeing that time alone was insufficient, devised a therapeutic approach for these \\"borderline\\" youngsters that was effective. Masterson theorized that the dynamic structure of the borderline reflected a developmental arrest in the stage of childhood development described by Margaret Mahler as the \\"rapprochement\\" sub-phase: a time when the two year old is caught between unresolved urges toward dependence and independence. Soon after, Masterson extended his work from adolescents to adults. (The term \\"borderline,\\" when used by Masterson [and similarly by Kernberg] refers to a subtype of personality disorder, and is not a synonym for personality disorder, as it was originally introduced.) On narcissism In 1993, Masterson proposed two categories for pathological narcissism, \\"exhibitionist\\" and \\"closet\\".Masterson, James F. The Emerging Self: A Developmental Self & Object Relations Approach to the Treatment of the Closet Narcissistic Disorder of the Self, 1993 Those with both styles of disorder fail to adequately develop an age- and phase- appropriate self because of defects in the quality of psychological nurturing provided by the mother or caregiver. The exhibitionist narcissist is similar to that described in DSM-IV and differs from the closet narcissist in several important ways. The closet narcissist is more likely to be described as having a deflated, inadequate self perception and greater awareness of emptiness within, and seeks to mend this with an unquestioning dedication to an idealized other. The exhibitionist narcissist would be described as having an inflated, grandiose self perception with little or no conscious awareness of the emptiness within. Such a person would assume that this condition was normal but seeks the admiration of others for reassurance. There is an analogy here with Kohut's \\"idealizing\\" and \\"mirror\\" narcissists (Masterson's \\"closet\\" and \\"exhibitionistic\\" narcissists), and a relationship to the developmental theory of Daniel Stern. Schizoid personality disorder and developmental trauma Masterson welcomed the ideas of those trained by him who had joined him in practicing and teaching the Masterson Approach. Specifically, in 1995, psychotherapeutic work with the schizoid personality disorder was introduced by Ralph Klein, M.D., Clinical Director of the Masterson Institute. Also in 1995, the issue of trauma in personality disorder—including formulation of the concept of \\"developmental trauma\\" (how traumatic events within the first three years of life may affect the formation of personality) -- was introduced by Candace Orcutt, Ph.D., Associate. In that year, writings on these and other topics expanding the Masterson Approach appeared in \\"Disorders of the Self: New Therapeutic Horizons\\" (Brunner/Mazel, NY, 1995).

It is one of the few players in the sector to develop expert skills in both upstream (engineering, purchasing, operation, maintenance) and downstream (waste management, dismantling) activities. The company, formed on 22 July 2008 by the merger of Gaz de France and Suez, traces its origins to the Universal Suez Canal Company founded in 1858 to construct the Suez Canal. As of 2018, ENGIE employs 158,505 people worldwide with revenues of €60.6 billion. ENGIE is listed on the Euronext exchanges in Paris and Brussels and is a constituent of the CAC 40 and BEL20 indices. ENGIE was headed from 2016 to 2020 by Isabelle Kocher, who has strongly transformed the company since 2016, notably by deciding to exit coal activities and by investing massively in renewable energies and energy transition services. During its General Meeting on 14 May 2020, ENGIE's Board of Directors has approved its purpose statement which is \\"to act to accelerate the transition towards a carbon-neutral economy, through reduced energy consumption and more environmentally-friendly solutions\\". History Background (before 2006) Prior to the GDF Suez merger plans in 2006, the company existed as two separate French multinational corporations - Suez S.A. and Gaz de France. Suez was (and still remains, through GDF Suez) one of the oldest continuously existing multinational corporations in the world as the result of nearly two centuries of reorganisation and corporate mergers. One line of corporate history dates back to the 1822 founded Algemeene Nederlandsche Maatschappij ter begunstiging van de volksvlijt (literally: General Dutch Company for the favouring of industry) by King William I of the Netherlands (see Société Générale de Belgique). The origin of its name 'Suez' traces back to its other founding entity – the Compagnie universelle du canal maritime de Suez founded in 1858 to build the Suez Canal. Suez S.A. was the result of a 1997 merger between the Compagnie de Suez and Lyonnaise des Eaux. Gaz de France was created in 1946 along with its sister company Électricité de France (EDF) by the French Government. After the liberalisation of Europe's energy markets, Gaz de France also entered into the electricity sector, having developed combined natural gas-electricity offerings. The company's capital was partially floated on the Paris Stock Exchange in July 2005, raising €2.5 billion for the French Government.  Evolution of GDF Suez (2006 - 2008) On 25 February 2006, French Prime minister Dominique de Villepin announced the merger of water supply and treatment, waste management and energy company Suez and power firm Gaz de France, with the aim of creating the world's largest liquefied natural gas company. Since the French state owned over 80% of Gaz de France, it was necessary to pass a new law in order to make the merger possible. Whilst Nicolas Sarkozy was for several months opposed to the Villepin government's plans for a merger of the two companies, preferring a three-way deal with Italy's Enel which would maintain a controlling stake for the state, he subsequently accepted the government proposal. The plan for a merger between Gaz de France and Suez came under fire from the whole of the political left, which feared the loss of one of the last ways of preventing the price rises experienced over the previous three years, and by the social Gaullists and trade unions. In August 2006, the left-wing opposition submitted a record-breaking 137,449 amendments to the proposed legislation. Under normal procedure, parliament would have been required to vote on the amendments, which would have taken 10 years. The French Constitution does give the government options to bypass such a filibuster, but in the end these were not used. Law No. 2006-1537 of 7 December 2006 on the energy sector authorised the privatisation of Gaz de France. On 3 September 2007, Gaz de France and Suez announced agreed terms of merger, on the basis of an exchange of 21 Gaz de France shares for 22 Suez shares via the absorption of Suez by Gaz de France. Various holdings of Gaz de France and Suez had to be divested in order to satisfy the concerns of the European Commissioner for Competition: GDF agreed to sell its approximate 25% stake in Belgian electricity producer SPE for €515 million. The stake was purchased by fellow SPE shareholder Centrica which exercised its right of first refusal, blocking a previous agreement to sell the stake to Électricité de France. Suez, meanwhile, was forced to reduce its shareholding in natural gas distributor Fluxys and sell its Belgian gas supply subsidiary Distrigas to Eni.  GDF Suez (2008 - 2015) The newly created GDF Suez came into existence on 22 July 2008; the world's second-largest utility with over €74 billion in annual revenues. The deal resulted in the conversion of the French state's 80% stake in GDF into just over 35% of shares of the new company. The water and waste assets which formerly formed part of Suez were spun off into a new publicly traded company, Suez Environment, in which GDF Suez retains a stake. In 1975, Ruhrgas and Gaz de France concluded a deal according to which they agreed not to sell gas in each other's home market. The deal was abandoned in 2005. In July 2009, the European Commission fined GDF Suez and E.ON €553 million both over arrangements on the MEGAL pipeline. It was the second biggest fines imposed by the European Commission and the first one on the energy sector. In October 2009, GDF Suez placed 6th in an A.T. Kearney/BusinessWeek ranking of the \\"World's Best Companies\\", the highest-placed European firm. On 10 August 2010, the company announced a merger of its GDF SUEZ Energy International business unit, along with its operations within the United Kingdom and Turkey, with International Power. The acquisition created the world's biggest independent power producer, and the enlarged company retained International Power's listing on the London Stock Exchange and was 70% owned by GDF Suez. In December 2010, GDF SUEZ became the key founding member of the 'Medgrid' company \\\\- a consortium of twenty plus utilities, grid operators, equipment makers, financing institutions and investors; which will implement the 'Medgrid project', a French renewable energy initiative within the framework of the Union for the Mediterranean (UfM). The project, planned in North Africa, aims to promote and develop a Euro-Mediterranean electricity network of 20GW installed generating capacity, with 5GW being devoted for exports to Europe. The Medgrid together with the German initiated Desertec project would serve as the backbone of the European Supergrid. On 16 April 2012, the purchase of the remaining 30% of International Power was announced by GDF Suez, and the transaction completed in July 2012. GDF Suez was advised by Rothschild and Ondra Partners, while Barclays, Morgan Stanley and Nomura advised International Power. On 9 August 2013, GDF Suez, through its Energy Services business line, announced the purchase of Balfour Beatty's UK Facilities Management business – Balfour Beatty WorkPlace. The legacy Cofely business incorporated the legacy Balfour Beatty Workplace Business which went on to acquire Lend Lease FM in 2014 from Lend Lease Group giving the new business a substantial platform in the operation of PFI assets in the UK.  GDF Suez becomes ENGIE: 2015 - present  On 24 April 2015 GDF Suez announced it was changing its name to \\"ENGIE\\", in an effort to further expand the company's international footprint. CEO and Chairman Gérard Mestrallet said the new name was a symbol to meet the challenges of the energy transition and accelerate the group's development. The subsidiary International Power became Engie Energy International. In July 2015, ENGIE acquired 95% of Solairedirect, raising its photovoltaic production from 125 to 486 MW. On 2 March 2017, ENGIE acquired Keepmoat Regeneration for £330m to form the places and communities division, headed up by Keepmoat LTD's former CEO Dave Sheridan. The new division is focused on three key activities; energy, services and regeneration. GDF Suez has been ranked as among the 13th best of 92 oil, gas, and mining companies on indigenous rights and resource extraction in the Arctic. In April 2019, Engie announced the acquisition of 90% of Transportadora Associada de Gás (TAG), Brazil's largest natural gas transmission system owner (2,800 miles of pipeline, 47% of the country's gas infrastructure), for €7.7 billion. It is the largest acquisition since International Power in 2010. The operation allows Engie to develop on its strategic axis of energy infrastructure as well as in Brazil, one of the priority countries. In February 2020, the board of directors announces that it will not propose the reappointment of Isabelle Kocher at the next shareholders’ meeting, which will bring to an end of her Chief Executive Officer position. Strategy Transformation of the company's business Since 2014, ENGIE has operated a strategic shift, by reducing future exploration in fossil fuels and investing massively in renewable energies (solar, wind, geothermal, biomass, hydroelectric, and nuclear) and energy efficiency services. In 2015, ENGIE announced its decision to stop new investments in coal plants and to dispose of €15 billion in assets in order to reinvest into projects that promote low-carbon, distributed-energy. ENGIE also announced it will invest €22bn in renewable energies, energy services such as heating and cooling networks, and decentralized energy technology. In 2016, Isabelle Kocher defines the strategy of ENGIE as follows: to promote decarbonized energy (oil and coal replaced by renewables and natural gas that emit less greenhouse gases), decentralized energy (energy produced and stored as close as possible to its place of consumption), and digitized energy (big data and digital tools for energy efficiency and network management). The Group creates ENGIE Digital and plans to invest €1.5 billion on digital and new technologies related to energy. ENGIE is also promoting an open innovation approach with its dedicated entity \\"ENGIE Fab\\" that supports in particular development of intelligent networks (smart grids), Internet of objects, green mobility, energy storage, and hydrogen. Between 2016 and 2018, ENGIE invested €15 billion in new activities, financed by the sale of coal and upstream oil and gas. 2019-2021 strategic plan In 2019, Isabelle Kocher announces the strategic plan of the company for the 2019-2021 period, with an ambition to become the world leader in the zero-carbon transition. The strategic shift includes accelerating its investments in renewable energies and focusing on high-value-added services to the clients. Isabelle Kocher announces the definitive exit of coal activities. Engie plans to invest another €12 billion in renewable activities, partly financed by the sale of €6 billion assets (including the last coal plants). The 12 billion break down as follows: 3 to 3.3 billion into gas infrastructure; 4 to 5 billion into client services and solutions; and 2.3 to 2.8 billion into renewable energies, adding a 9 GWH production capacity, to reach a renewable installed capacity of 52 to 64 GW by 2026. As far as the services are concerned, Isabelle Kocher's plan is to develop \\"energy transition as a service\\" for large companies and metropolises, whom she says are driving the \\"second wave of energy transition\\" by searching ways to reduce their carbon emissions (the first wave having been driven by the states). She also says it might be \\"the invention of a new industry\\" of a 1 billion dollar potential value. Engie also announces its intention to leave 20 of the 70 countries where it is active, and focus its activities on 20 countries and 30 metropolitan areas, mainly in Southeast Asia and Africa. Operations Power generation France Thanks to former Suez subsidiaries such as Compagnie Nationale du Rhône (CNR), Electrabel and (SHEM), GDF Suez is the second-largest generator of electricity in France behind EDF.\\"EdF is by far the largest electricity generator in France..\\" The company indicated in December 2011 that of the group's production comes from sources that emit no CO2 principally hydroelectricity (through CNR and SHEM) and wind power, the latter of which both Gaz de France and Suez moved aggressively into in 2007 and 2008. Recently acquired subsidiaries include (majority stake), the wind farm business of Nass & Wind and Erelia. The company also operates a natural gas-fired combined cycle power plant (DK6) in Dunkirk. With the stated aim of reaching a total production capacity of 10 GW by 2013, three gas-fired thermal power plants at Fos-sur-Mer, Montoir-de- Bretagne and Saint-Brieuc are currently in various stages of development, as is a solar panel project in Curbans. International ENGIE also generates electricity in a number of countries outside France. Most notably, the company is the leading producer in both Belgium and the Netherlands through Electrabel (and the fifth-largest generator in Europe overall), as well as the largest non-state owned generator in both Brazil and Thailand (thanks to majority stakes in ENGIE Brasil and Glow Energy respectively). The company also operates in North and Latin America through its Suez Energy International unit, as well as in other European and Asian countries. The company generates electricity through various types of plants, including thermal power, nuclear power, combined heat and power, wind farms, hydroelectric and biomass. ENGIE is currently developing a $15.8 billion nuclear power plant in Sinop, Turkey in partnership with Itochu and Mitsubishi Heavy Industries. In November 2016, ENGIE signed an agreement with Moroccan energy company Nareva. The two companies are planning to develop energy assets in North and Western Africa that will produce 5,000 and 6,000 megawatts. The plans will take place between 2020 and 2025. In December 2016, ENGIE announced that Azzour North One Independent Water & Power Project (IWPP) has started full commercial operations. The power and water plant is Kuwait's most efficient source of electricity. In January 2017, ENGIE has been awarded the contract and achieved financial closing for the greenfield Fadhili independent power project (IPP) in Saudi Arabia, the most efficient cogeneration plant in the country.  Coal-fired power plants  In October 2015, ENGIE announced that it will no longer build coal-fired power plants. Gérard Mestrallet said projects for which ENGIE had already entered into firm commitments would be honored, but projects, where contracts had not yet been signed, will de facto be suspended. As a result, ENGIE abandoned two coal- fired power plants projects in Ada Yumurtalik (Turkey) and in Thabametsi (South Africa). In February 2016, ENGIE announced the selling of its stakes in the Paiton power plant located in Indonesia and in the Meenakshi power plant located in India. ENGIE also announced the closing of the Rugeley power station in England. In May 2016 ENGIE CEO Isabelle Kocher told a French Senate committee that it was planning a gradual withdrawal from coal-fired generation over the coming years. This could include closure of, or sale of its stake in, the lignite-fired Hazelwood Power Station in Victoria, Australia. Hazelwood power plant closed at the end of March 2017. ENGIE sold to Enea its Polaniec power plant, in Poland. In February 2019, Engie announced the definitive exit of all coal activities. Renewable energy ENGIE's renewable installed capacity represented 19.5% of its energy mix at the end of 2016. The Group's renewable energy mix is composed of hydropower, solar energy, onshore and offshore wind power, biomass, and geothermal sources. ENGIE has won bids for several solar and wind projects since 2016: a 338 MW solar project in India (April 2017), 209 MW in contracts for solar and wind projects in Mexico, and a 40 MW solar project in Peru. It has begun construction of the 100 MW Kathu solar park in South Africa. ENGIE invested in Heliatek, a German company pioneering technologies in organic photovoltaics, in September 2016. The Group also assumed 100% control of La Compagnie du Vent in March 2017, and a 30% stake in Unisun, a Chinese solar photovoltaics company, in April 2017. In Brazil, ENGIE's largest international hydroelectric project, and the fourth largest power plant in the country (3,750 MW) was inaugurated in December 2016. ENGIE built its first international geothermal power generation plant in Indonesia. In October 2016, ENGIE developed France's first marine geothermal power station in Marseilles. In May 2017, Mexico's ministry of energy awarded ENGIE three geothermal exploration permits. In February 2019, ENGIE announces it plans to add 9 gigawatts (GW) of renewable energy generation capacity to its portfolio by 2021, as part of its plan to accelerate the investments in renewable and low carbon energies. In May 2019, ENGIE and Portuguese power company EDP announced the future creation of a 50-50 joint venture in offshore wind, starting with a total of 1.5 gigawatts (GW) under construction and 4 GW under development. Engie's Willogoleche Wind Farm (119MW) opened in South Australia on 30 July 2019. It also owns Pelican Point (500MW) and Dry Creek (156MW) gas-fired power stations and Canunda Wind Farm (46MW) in South Australia. Renewable gas ENGIE covers the whole biomethane chain, from project development with farmers to distribution to the final clients. The group has announced that, by 2030, it would have invested 2 billion euros in renewable gas, 10% of which will be injected into the networks, and that it will produce 5 TWH a year of biomethane. Natural gas In its historic activity of gas, ENGIE covers the whole gas chain, from exploration and production to distribution. It is the: * second largest gas transportation network in Europe * largest gas distribution network in Europe * fifth largest LNG portfolio in the world * largest LNG importer in Europe * second largest LNG terminal operator in Europe. In November 2016, ENGIE and Statoil have reached an agreement on the renegotiation of their long-term gas supply contracts to adapt them to the evolution of European natural gas markets and to better reflect current market rates. In 2016, ENGIE has negotiated new contracts for gas supply around the world: an agreement with UkrTransGaz, Ukrainian transmission system operator, on gas transmission and storage; an agreement with AES Andres to foster growth in LNG and natural gas sales in the Caribbean. ENGIE also committed the Neptune, one of the two FSRU (Floating Storage and Regasification Unit) of its fleet, to deliver LNG to the first floating LNG import terminal in Turkey. In China, after an LNG supply agreement with Beijing Gas, ENGIE is looking at opportunities in the underground gas storage needed to hold stocks to meet seasonal demand. The bunkering vessel ENGIE Zeebrugge performed for the first time in the port of Zeebrugge, Belgium, in June 2017. It was the first to provide ship-to-ship supplies for LNG as a fuel. In March 2017, ENGIE sold its licenses for shale gas exploration in the UK to petrochemicals firm Ineos, as part of its decarbonized strategy In May 2017, ENGIE enters into exclusive negotiations with Neptune Energy for the sale of its 70% interest in Exploration & Production International (\\"EPI\\"). ENGIE signed in 2016 a technical and commercial cooperation contract with Göteborg Energi to push further the industrialization of the dry biomass-to-gas production approach. Engie is also involved in the Ambigo project, the first dry biomass-to-gas project which will be located in Alkmaar, Netherlands.

Background Stone was born in Cambridge, England, on 31 October 1966. He is of half- Scottish and half-Haitian descent. His father, Norman Stone, was a well-known historian and his mother, Nicole, was a niece of the finance minister in the Haitian government of François Duvalier (\\"Papa Doc\\").Norman Stone: 'I'm not a nasty person', The Daily Telegraph, 12 May 2010 Early life When he was six months old, Stone was sent to Haiti to live with his grandparents, where he stayed until returning to England in 1970. He returned to Haiti during 1973–1974, in 1982 and in 1995. His grandparents owned an estate in Haiti and some of his relatives worked for the country's dictator, Duvalier. During his visit in 1982 he met Jean Bertrand Aristide, the priest who would become Haiti's first democratically elected President; he has said that he had high hopes for Aristide's term as president but that \\"he turned out to be Papa Doc without the jokes\\". He has cited his Haitian experience as being an influence on his writings and has said that until his visit in the 1990s he thought it to be an \\"idyllic\\" place. From that visit he has said: He was bullied as a child due to his skin colour. This caused him to take up amateur boxing, at which he fought at welterweight and light-middleweight. His maternal grandfather had been a bareknuckle boxer based in France before World War II. He read History at Jesus College, Cambridge, graduating in 1989.'Tripos Results from the University of Cambridge', The Times, 7 July 1989. Work Stone has named some of his favourite crime writers as being James Ellroy, John Grisham, Elmore Leonard and Carl Hiaasen. His first novel, Mr Clarinet, took shape during his visit to Haiti of 1995. In an interview with Stone it was said that the book \\"articulated the change in Haiti over the last 30 years\\". Stone's second novel, King of Swords – a prequel to Mr Clarinet, set in Cocaine Cowboy era Miami – was published in 2007. Stone's third novel, Voodoo Eyes, set in Miami and Cuba either side of the 2008 US Presidential Election, marks the third and final outing for the character of Max Mingus. Nick Stone's fourth novel, The Verdict, is a legal thriller set in contemporary London . The book was a significant departure from Stone's previous novels, in both content and narrative style.

Educated at St. Mary's College in Baltimore, Maryland, he became a Sulpician and eventually President of the college. Early Life and Family Chanche was born October 4, 1795, in Baltimore, Maryland. He was born to well-to-do parents, John and Catherine Provost Chanche, who had fled to Baltimore from the French colony of Saint-Domingue (present-day Haiti), where his father had been a merchant, during the Haitian Revolution. He was christened the following August by Rev. William Dubourg. In 1806, Chanche entered St. Mary's Seminary, which was run by the Sulpicians, not far from his home. He received \\"first tonsure\\" from Archbishop John Carroll. Chanche began his theological studies in 1814, and received minor orders from Archbishop Leonard Neale. He joined the Sulpicians and was ordained a priest on June 5, 1819 by Archbishop Maréchal. He was then appointed a professor at the school. In 1833, he was chosen as Master of Ceremonies for the Second Provincial Council of Baltimore, a major step by the bishops of the nation in organizing its structure. Chanche was named Vice President of the seminary, and in 1834 succeeded Samuel Eccleston, S.S., as its President. Chanche was offered the post of coadjutor first to the Archbishop of Baltimore and then to the Bishop of Boston successively, but declined both. He was still President of St. Mary's when he was appointed Bishop of Natchez in 1840. Bishop of Natchez The Diocese of Natchez was created on July 28, 1837, and although it encompassed the entire state of Mississippi, a large geographic region, nearly three years passed before Chanche was appointed as its first bishop on December 15, 1840. Chanche was consecrated March 14, 1841 by Archbishop Eccleston at the Baltimore Basilica, assisted by bishops Benedict Joseph Fenwick of Boston and John Hughes of New York. Arriving at Natchez in May 1841, alternate URL he met there the only priest in the state, Father Brogard, who was only there temporarily. Brogard conducted services in the Mechanics' Hall.

The name Lion's City has been used since 2004, when MAN's public bus models which had been marketed separately were gathered into one range, when also most models received a facelift. The first models to be introduced were the 12-metre low-floor intercity bus NÜ xx3 (A20) in 1996, the 12-metre city bus NL xx3 (A21) in 1997 and the articulated NG xx3 (A23) in 1998. As with former MAN bus models the power-rating made up part of the model name, giving the NÜ-series buses with power-ratings of 260 and 310 hp model names NÜ 263 and NÜ 313 respectively. The main production sites are in Starachowice and Sady in Poland, but the models have also been built in Germany, Turkey and Malaysia. Initially most of the midibus variants were manufactured by Göppel Bus in Augsburg, later Nobitz. Models are available with a 6-cylinder turbocharged straight engine which runs on diesel, compressed natural gas or liquefied petroleum gas. Versions with hydrogen fuel cell drive and with hydrogen internal combustion engines have been successfully tested, as well as diesel-electric hybrid drive. A production hybrid-electric version, the Lion's City Hybrid, which uses supercapacitors and two 67 kW electric motors is available since 2010. Hybrid electric buses offer increased efficiency in urban traffic and use 30% less fuel than combustion-only buses. The latest generation of Neoplan Centroliner is based on the Lion's City (Neoplan was also part of the Neoman Bus group).  Integral variants  Codes inside parentheses are internal codes that identify some technical characteristics of the variants, like length/wheelbase, number of axles, floor height, width, engine arrangement and so on. Some codes are unique to one variant, while others are shared between variants. Some variants have changed from one code to another over time. These codes are sometimes mistakenly used as a model designation. One can find the codes in VINs (i.e. WMAA21...) and in vehicle production serial numbers (i.e. A210012).

A total number of 27 chassis were built between 2003 and 2006. In 2003, Kowloon Motor Bus (KMB) of Hong Kong received one MAN ND313F with Neoplan Centroliner N4426 bodywork, it received fleet number APM1 and registration number LE4612, entering service later in the same year. The bus remained unique in Kowloon Motor Bus fleet. It was retired in January 2019. 25 ND363F received Ayats coach bodywork, and were delivered to Ulsterbus of Northern Ireland in 2006. MAN ND243F / ND283F (A48) Reading Buses ND283F with East Lancs Kinetec+ bodywork. In 2006, a 10.85-metre two-axle version was launched as the MAN ND243F and MAN ND283F, with chassis code A48. One ND283F received an East Lancs Kinetec+ bodywork, which had a front similar to that of MAN Lion's City. Two more ND283F test chassis were built, but no ND243F. MAN ND323F / ND363F (A95) In 2013, a new double deck chassis based on the A22-series low floor single-decker chassis was launched as the MAN ND323F and MAN ND363F, with a new chassis code A95. Currently, the bodywork of all A95 buses are built by Gemilang Coachworks and are based on the licensed MAN Lion's City DD design, and is also marketed in various markets as the MAN Lion's City DD for the 12 m long variant and the MAN Lion's City DD L for the 12.8m long variant. A concept bodywork design was unveiled in 2015, in the form of a 3-door bus built for Singapore's Land Transport Authority (LTA). Currently, a refreshed design based on the concept is being adopted on the newer buses. In addition, the Australian market buses feature a different rear end design as compared to those sold in other markets. Singapore A MAN A95 as operated by SMRT Buses In November 2014, SMRT was given a single MAN ND323F demonstrator for trial purposes at the manufacturer's request. Following a successful trial run, SMRT ordered 16 MAN ND323Fs which were delivered between August and November 2015 with tree guards pre-installed. In late 2015, the Land Transport Authority ordered 60 units as part of the Bus Contracting Model (BCM) order. Largely similar to the previous batch procured by SMRT Buses, these buses had some minor differences in appearance such as the omission of tree guards. The final 10 units of this batch were equipped with USB charging ports. The first 15 buses were painted in SMRT's corporate livery, while the rest featured LTA's green livery. All of these buses are currently assigned to SMRT Buses. The three-door MAN A95 demonstrator, which was introduced in late 2015 and is currently operated by SBS Transit since 2018 Also in late 2015, a 12.8 m long custom built MAN ND323F with 3 doors and 2 staircases was built for the LTA, featuring an updated concept bodywork design.Singapore authority assesses three-door double-decks Bus & Coach Professional 6 May 2016 Originally deployed to Tower Transit in 2017, it was transferred to SBS Transit in early 2018. In September 2016, LTA ordered another 122 MAN ND323Fs which were put into service in 2017. These buses contain similar specifications with the previous batch but with an updated bodywork design, with the first 30 units being based on the concept and the rest with an updated design. These buses were assigned to SBS Transit, SMRT Buses and Go-Ahead Singapore, with most units in SMRT Buses replacing retiring Mercedes-Benz O405G bendy buses. In late 2017, under a negotiated tender, the Land Transport Authority ordered 250 MAN buses, which were 150 MAN NL323Fs and 100 MAN ND323Fs, equipped with Euro VI engines and minor differences to the bodywork in the previous batch. These buses were equipped with two wheelchair bays as compared to one in previous batches. An option was excised in 2018 to procure an additional 150 MAN ND323Fs in this batch. These buses entered revenue service in May 2018 and are currently assigned to SBS Transit, SMRT Buses and Go-Ahead Singapore for fleet additions and replacement of retiring buses. In July 2018, a tender was awarded by LTA to ST Kinetics for the procurement of 111 MAN ND323Fs, which were delivered with subtle differences as compared to the earlier batches. These buses entered service in March 2020, with the final bus expected to be delivered in 2021. Similar to the previous batch, these buses will be assigned to various bus operators for fleet additions and replacement of retiring buses. Following the successful trial of the three door MAN ND323F, the Land Transport Authority announced that 50 production batch 3-door ND323Fs will be procured along with 50 3-door Alexander Dennis Enviro500s. These buses will be released on the roads in 2020. Hong Kong In August 2014, Kwoon Chung Motors Company (KCM) ordered 9 ND323Fs replacing 8 Dennis Tridents and 1 MAN 24.310. Also, KCM's subsidiary company New Lantau Bus (NLB) purchased 10 ND323Fs. They were delivered to Hong Kong in June and August 2015 respectively.

Due to the frequency and severity of wildfires in California, the state has elected to establish its own aerial firefighting force rather than rely solely on national resources. The Aviation Management Program is based at McClellan Airfield near Sacramento, California. Overview In support of its ground forces, the California Department of Forestry and Fire Protection (CAL FIRE) emergency response air program includes 23 Grumman S-2T 1,200 gallon airtankers, eleven UH-1H Super Huey helicopters, and 14 OV-10A airtactical aircraft. These aircraft are stationed at 13 air attack and 10 helitack bases located statewide, and can reach most fires within 20 minutes. During high fire activity, CAL FIRE may move aircraft to better provide statewide air support. The airtactical planes fly overhead at a fire, directing the airtankers and helicopters to critical areas of the fire for retardant and water drops. The retardant used to slow or retard the spread of a fire is a slurry mix consisting of a chemical salt compound, water, clay or a gum- thickening agent, and a coloring agent. While both air tankers and helicopters are equipped to carry fire retardant or water, the helicopters can also transport firefighters, equipment and injured personnel. The average annual budget of the CAL FIRE Aviation Management Program is nearly $20 million. A total of 18 CAL FIRE personnel oversee the program with an additional 130 contract employees providing mechanical, pilot and management services. CAL FIRE's current support contractors are DynCorp and Logistics Specialties Incorporated (LSI). DynCorp provides airtanker and airtactical aircraft pilot services, and all aircraft maintenance services. All CAL FIRE helicopters are flown by CAL FIRE pilots. LSI provides procurement and parts management services. History Tanker 910 during a drop demonstration in December 2006 Air tankers The possibility of using aircraft for fighting wildland fires in California was first proposed in 1931 and again in the late 1940s after World War II. In 1953, the Nolta brothers of Willows, California proposed using their agriculture spray planes for fighting brush and grass fires. During the four fire seasons from 1954–1957, CAL FIRE used several small airtankers on a call-when-needed basis. These were primarily spray airplanes converted for use as firefighters. Also during this period, several enterprising aviation companies had been converting World War II Grumman TBM Avengers for air tanker use. Thus, in 1958 CAL FIRE first contracted for air tanker services with private aviation companies. That year contracts were let for three Naval Aircraft Factory N3N Canary, four Stearman and four TBM Avenger air tankers. The N3Ns and Stearmans were World War II biplanes used for pilot training and converted for use as agricultural spray planes. They were capable of carrying up to 200 gallons of fire retardant chemicals. The TBM, a World War II torpedo bomber, could deliver 600 gallons. During the ensuing years other aircraft were converted to air tankers and used by CAL FIRE. Among these were Beechcraft 18 (Twin Beech), Boeing B-17 Flying Fortress, Consolidated PBY Catalina, and Grumman F7F Tigercat. The air tanker program continued to expand until finally in the early 1970s, a total of 14 TBMs, five F7Fs, one PBY and one B-17 comprised the CAL FIRE fleet. By 1970, concerns with maintainability and accidents occurring in the TBM fleet led to an evaluation of the Grumman S-2 Tracker as a new generation air tanker. Although they were still active in the Navy, four were loaned to CAL FIRE for the evaluation. The Army Aviation Test Facility at Edwards Air Force Base completed a test program that showed the S-2 was a suitable replacement for the TBM. Two S-2 prototype air tankers were placed in service in 1973 with the prototype tank being built at the CAL FIRE Mobile Equipment Facility in Davis and the S-2 modification being completed by Hemet Valley Flying Service. These conversions were accomplished using plans developed by Ontario Lands and Forests in Ontario, Canada. CDF S-2T Turbine Tracker landing at Fox Field, Lancaster, California, while fighting the North Fire Three TBM accidents in 1973 and three F7F accidents in 1974 accelerated the CAL FIRE S-2 modification program. As a result, contracts were entered into with four California contractors, Aero Union Corp., Sis-Q Flying Service, TBM Inc. and Hemet Valley Flying Service to modify and tank ten S-2 air tankers during the 1973/1974 winter period. As a result, 12 S-2As were placed in service in 1974 and five more were built by Bay Aviation Services and put into the fleet for the 1975 fire season. Three separate leases with the U.S. Navy brought a total of 55 S-2s and 60 engines for the program. This allowed CAL FIRE to keep the fleet going until the mid-1990s when it was decided to upgrade from S-2A to S-2T air tankers. In 1987, CAL FIRE entered into an agreement with Marsh Aviation of Mesa, Arizona to build a prototype S-2T. This prototype was placed in service and used at several bases. The success of the prototype led to acquisition of 26 S-2E/G aircraft in 1996. The E/G series S-2 was larger and newer. It could haul 1200 gallons of retardant with two TPE-331 GR turboprop engines at speeds in excess of . A contract for building 23 of the new S-2T airtankers was entered into, with 13 delivered by the end of 2002, seven additional aircraft delivered and placed in service by the end of 2004 and the final three in 2005. As the new air tankers were delivered and placed in service, the original S-2As are retired. In 2007, CAL FIRE contracted with 10 Tanker Air Carrier for three years' of exclusive use of their DC-10 \\"super tanker\\" known as Tanker 910, at a cost of $5 million per year. Air tactical aircraft Air Attack 460 at Fox Field during the 2007 Southern California firestorm In the mid-1970s, CAL FIRE found that the contractor-owned air tactical planes, mostly single-engine Cessna 182s and Cessna 210s, did not provide the airspeed and safety needed for the new air tanker program. In 1974, CAL FIRE acquired 20 retired USAF Cessna O-2 observation aircraft from Davis-Monthan Air Force Base. These O-2s had been forward air control aircraft in Vietnam, had been shipped back to the United States in containers and were disassembled and on pallets when they arrived at CAL FIRE's Fresno maintenance facility. A crew of California Conservation Corp (CCC) members reassembled the aircraft. They were placed in service in 1976. The O-2 program was a success and served the Department for more than 20 years. In 1993, CAL FIRE obtained 16 twin-engine turbine-powered North American OV-10A aircraft from the U.S. Navy. The OV-10s replaced the O-2s as the CAL FIRE's next-generation air tactical platform. Cal Fire helicopter program Bieber Helitack crew, takes off from the Mojave Airport In 1960 the Division of Forestry decided to experiment with a small, skilled initial attack, or \\"helitack\\" crew to be transported by helicopter to increase the early arrival of manpower and equipment to an initial attack fire. Although the crews were trained for hover jumping and had purchased heli-jump suits from the US Forest Service, it was never found necessary to make a jump. Six helitack bases were established in the early 1970s. They were staffed with contracted Bell JetRangers. A typical Cal Fire helitack crew which responded with the helicopter consisted of one fire captain and two to three seasonal firefighters. Cal Fire began using contractor-owned helicopters for fire control in the mid-1960s. Bell 47, Hiller FH1100, Bell 206 JetRangers and Aerospatiale Alouettes were used the most through the 1970s. The helicopters were located at Cal Fire facilities which protected high value timberlands and critical watershed areas generally in Northern and Central California with one located at Ryan Field in Southern California. The helicopter began playing an increasing role in the Cal Fire's Initial Attack strategy during the late 70s. In 1978 three Bell 205 medium helicopters were hired in addition to the standby helicopters. One helicopter was located at the Howard Forest, Mendocino Ranger Unit Headquarters. The other two were located at Hemet/Ryan Field and the Monte Vista, San Diego Ranger Unit Headquarters. Each of the medium helicopters was assigned 11 person helitack crews. Unfortunately, in the mid to late 1970s Cal Fire experienced an increased accident rate throughout the helicopter program. Five accidents involving contractor-owned Bell Jet Rangers occurred in 1979. As a result of the accidents, Cal Fire decided that better approach would be for the agency to own and operate its own helicopters. In 1981, Cal Fire leased 12 excess UH-1F Hueys which had previously been used by the USAF in Vietnam. Nine helicopters were initially reconditioned, and were operated as non- certificated, public-use aircraft. The first helicopter was built up November, 1981 and was placed in service at Hemet-Ryan Helitack Base. Six more F Model Hueys were built up and placed in service at helitack bases throughout California in the summer of 1982. During the first two years Cal Fire employed “Personal Service Contract” pilots. Each base was assigned a full-time pilot and a seasonal relief pilot who covered two bases. The majority of the contract pilots became state employees in 1984. The helitack unit was designed to be a cohesive unit which consisted of the helicopter and helitack crew. A typical configuration for the helicopter was a Helitack Fire Captain in the copilot's seat and a Helitack Fire Captain plus six fire-fighters in the passenger compartment. The water bucket was replaced in 1984 with a newly designed Canadian Bambi bucket. In the mid-1980s, fixed water dropping tanks were installed on several helicopters. Water bucket operations over ever- increasing populated regions in the urban interface areas of eastern Riverside County had been causing a concern. An accidental drop of a water bucket could cause catastrophic results, while a fixed tank reduced the exposure. In addition, some areas where the helicopters operated had few water sources from which a helicopter could fill its bucket. A fixed tank allowed the helicopter to obtain water from sources previously unobtainable with the bucket. As the 1991 lease agreement expiration date with the US Air Force rapidly approached, Cal Fire started a search for a replacement that ultimately resulted in the acquisition in 1989 of the UH-1H. The airframes that Cal Fire obtained were part of 100 that had been released by the US Department of Defense to the US Forest Service for distribution to states as Federal Excess Personal Property (FEPP) for wildland fire fighting. The UH-1H aircraft were significantly modified to meet Cal Fire's specialized needs. The modified helicopters were designated as Super Hueys. The Super Huey included a larger, more powerful engine, transmission and rotor system. The tail boom and tail rotor were also modified to accommodate the engine, giving the aircraft greater performance than the standard US Army UH-1H helicopters in hotter and higher conditions typical of California. Sikorsky S-70i purchased by CDF in 2020. Both the F model and the Super Huey maintenance programs were developed by Cal Fire using the most restrictive overhaul/replacement criteria of the military or Bell Helicopter. All maintenance is performed by contract mechanics. Big Valley built up and maintained the F model helicopters from 1981 to 1990 at their Stockton facility. They also started building up the first Super Hueys in 1989. San Joaquin Helicopters completed the Super Huey build-ups and maintained them in their facility in Yolo County and later at the Aviation Management facility at Mather Field in Sacramento from 1989 to 1999. DynCorp was awarded the contract in 2000 and continued to maintain the Super Hueys at Mather and later at McClellan Airfield in North Highlands, California.

It is the single point of contact for Army network development and protection, providing C4 information management of common-user services in support of the combatant commanders and Army service component commanders. It was the numbered command for the Network Enterprise Technology Command. History NETCOM/9th ASC inherits its name from the 9th Service Company, originally formed, 14 February 1918. It was organized two months later in Honolulu, Hawaii. The command mission was the installation and maintenance of telegraph, telephone and coastal artillery fire control communications. It was manned by a captain, five corporals and 15 Private First Class soldiers. The commands soldiers also served on Oahu at a number of commands including Fort Shafter, Schofield Barracks, Fort Ruger, Fort Armstrong, Fort Kamehameha, Hickam Field, Luke Field and Tripler General Hospital. The 9th Signal Service Company moved its unit headquarters from Honolulu to Fort Shafter in 1921. The command became responsible for heavy cable construction within the Hawaiian Department. In May 1929, the 9th Signal started passing radio traffic with the mainland and Manila. In August 1930, 9th Signal established direct radio links with the War Department station in Washington, D.C.. World War II Signal operations at Fort Shafter started to expand after the Japanese attack on Pearl Harbor. In 1942, the 9th Signal Service Company began to send radio operators out to Christmas, Canton, and Fanning Islands. It also supplied radio operators for transports sailing between San Francisco and Hawaii and for inter-island vessels sailing in Hawaiian waters. In April 1943, the unit was redesignated as the 972nd Signal Service Company. On 8 January 1944, it was reorganized as a battalion and designated as the 972nd Signal Service Battalion. Its manning had increased to 643 personnel. The unit had also been reassigned to U.S. Army Forces, Central Pacific Area. The expansion of the offensive in the Pacific and the growth in signal requirements required reallocation of theater signal resources. The 972nd Signal Service Battalion became the \\"wire battalion.\\" Its mission was to furnish personnel capable of handling the installation and maintenance of communications for the Wire Division of the Signal Office, Central Pacific Area. Major elements of the battalion were employed on the Island of Oahu and detachments were set up on the Islands of Hawaii, Maui and Kauai. The Central Pacific Base Command awarded the 972nd Signal Service Battalion the Meritorious Service Unit Plaque for the period 1 March 1945, to 30 April 1945. The battalion also earned the Central Pacific campaign streamer for the period 1941–1943. The battalion's Signal Photographic Detachment was awarded the Eastern Mandates campaign streamer. Post-war In January 1947, the battalion was reorganized, having increased in strength to 760. A Headquarters Detachment, and Companies A and B were added to the battalion. In June 1948, the battalion was again reorganized, adding a headquarters company to replace the headquarters detachment. At the end of 1948, post war organizational reductions in force brought the first of several inactivations for the battalion at Fort Shafter, Territory of Hawaii. In May 1958, the Chief of Signal ordered the 972nd Signal Battalion back to active service at Tobyanna Signal Depot, Pennsylvania. It was activated on 14 May 1958, as the 972nd Signal Battalion (Supply and Maintenance). The unit consisted of only a headquarters element with no assigned companies. In July 1962, the 972nd was reassigned from the Chief Signal Officer to Second United States Army. In May 1965, it reorganized from a headquarters detachment to a headquarters company. Vietnam In August 1965, the 972nd was alerted for overseas duty in South Vietnam. It was attached to the U. S. Army Support Command and located at Qui Nhon. The unit operated signal depots, supply and maintenance points September 1965 to October 1967. The 972nd was inactivated on 20 October 1967, only to be activated again at Fort Lewis, Washington in May 1968. Its soldiers trained for a five months, culminating in the unit's second deployment to Vietnam in October. The newly organized 972nd Signal Battalion arrived at Long Binh, Vietnam, on 29 October 1968, assigned to the 2nd Signal Group, 1st Signal Brigade, U.S. Army Strategic Communications Command. It provided contingency communications support throughout the Republic of Vietnam. In November 1968, the 107th Signal Company (Support) was assigned to the battalion. Later that month, the 972nd gained the 267th Signal Company (Cable Construction) and the 327th Signal Company (Radio Relay). During October 1969, the battalion transferred control of the 267th and 327th Signal Companies to the 39th Signal Battalion, 2nd Signal Group. The command was preparing for another inactivation. In October, the 107th Signal Company was released for redeployment to the United States. In late November 1969, the Army inactivated the 972nd as part of the redeployment of U.S. Army Forces from South Vietnam. During Vietnam, the battalion earned ten Vietnam campaign streamers. U.S. Army Vietnam also awarded the 972nd with its second Meritorious Unit Commendation. Re-activation as 9th Army Signal Command For the next 28 years, the unit remained dormant on the Army's inactive list. On 16 September 1997, the unit was reactivated as Headquarters and Headquarters Company, 9th Army Signal Command (ASC), a major subordinate command assigned to U.S. Army Forces Command. Oct. 1, 2002, the Army re-designated the 9th Army Signal Command as the United States Army Network Enterprise Technology Command and the 9th Army Signal Command (NETCOM/9th ASC). On 1 October 2010, 9th Signal Command (Army) became a subordinate command to ARCYBER, Second Army. In 2017 Second Army was inactivated.

Opponents in underwater hockey and underwater rugby wear either one of two colours - white or dark (i.e. blue or black) caps while the water referees wear red caps.

The extra power of many engine-sets was valuable in high and hot conditions, but their larger diameter was sometimes enough to reduce maximum speed by adding more drag. Even so, the aircraft was faster than the Junkers Ju 52, its most direct equivalent. Even with the same or even greater fuel load than the SM.79, the SM.81 had a shorter range. It had a maximum endurance in normal conditions. The ferry range to Spain in 1936 was an example of the relatively short range of the aircraft, perhaps caused (as was the low speed) by drag.

Walking the Thames Path is itself a meander, but the term usually applies to journeys using other methods such as rowing, punting, running, or swimming. A Thames meander can be a social expedition over a few days, generally in a Thames skiff or a punt. However more specific meanders are competitive events, or record breaking attempts. Means of propulsion include swimming and running and propelling virtually every type of small craft that floats on water. Meanders are often associated with charity sponsorship. The normal start of a meander for craft is Halfpenny Bridge, Lechlade. The finish is often Teddington Lock but other points in London are used. A \\"Giant meander\\" for craft goes all the way to Gravesend Pier. The Thames Meander run begins at Reading, Berkshire. Examples of Meanders * Polar explorer and endurance swimmer Lewis Pugh became the first person ever to swim the length of the Thames. His journey started on 17 July 2006 close to the source of the river in Gloucestershire and ended 147 miles later in London. Pugh undertook the challenge to raise awareness of climate change. * The record row by an individual from Lechlade to Gravesend was set by Malcolm Knight in a skiff at 43 hours 40 minutes 56 seconds in April 2005. * In August 2010, inspired by Lewis Pugh, a team of eight swam the entire non-tidal section of the River Thames in a non-stop relay. The team comprised Claire Mans, Ben Watkiss, Sarah Downes, Sam Carson, Louise Hewlett, James Hilditch, Jo Crisp and Tim Endersby. This was the first time this has been done.
