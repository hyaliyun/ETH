Seyi Oyesola is a Nigerian doctor, who co-invented \\"hospital in a box\\". Fed up with hospitals that were always short in supplies and prone to outages, Dr. Oyesola co-invented hospital in a box, a mini hospital run with solar energy or off grid and completely mobile.Seyi Oyesola: Doctor. TED, filmed Jun 2007 posted May 2008.  Early Life and Education  He was born Babaseyi Oyesola but popularly known as Dr. Seyi Oyesola. This doctor was born in Nigeria but grew up in Cleveland,and in USA. He graduated from high school in 1975 and came down to Nigeria where he obtained his Bachelors of Science Degree from the University of Lagos in 1986. Dr. Seyi practiced in Nigeria for a short time before going to the United Kingdom and the United States for specialized trainings in anesthesiology and critical care.  Career  Dr. Seyi Oyesola came back again to Nigeria, his original home in 2015, to practice. But lo, the state of the community hospitals and health centers disheartened him as people died from simple treatable and manageable illnesses like trauma, burn and heart attacks. This was where the innovation on improving the health sector in the country began. He wanted to save life and gave back to the communities that gave him, his heritage. Dr. Seyi worked in the University of Lagos where he rose to lead a team of young doctors in anesthesiology. Dr Oyesola was appointed consultant at Medway Maritime Hospital in the UK. In 1998, he joined the University of Los Angeles in California as a visiting Assistant Professor. In 1999, he became a consultant in anesthesia and critical care in the UK National Health Service (NHS). He also taught at the medical simulation center of the Imperial College School of Medicine in 2001. Presently, Dr. Seyi Oyesola is the Chief Medical Director of Delta State University Teaching Hospital (DELSUTH) in Nigeria. This wonder doctor created history when his medical Team performed the first successful kidney transplant at the facility in 2014. He has worked for more than 25 years on the special need in anesthesiology and critical care, bringing innovation, developing high-tech medical equipment and training to African hospitals as well as visiting rural hospitals. One of his most outstanding contributions to medical practices was the co-creation of ‚Äúhospital in a box‚Äù called CompactOR (Compact Operating Room) in 2007. This movable set has the capability of bringing surgical care to every part of Africa. This magical set was portable and could be delivered to rural areas and other places with jeep or helicopter. Another amazing characteristics of the ‚Äúhospital in a box‚Äù was that it could be set up in just ten minutes with complete operating room with all the relevant surgical tools including the defibrillators, EKG monitoring, anesthesia and surgical lighting. It was solar paneled and could perform oral surgeries like the removal of wisdom teeth, removal of cataracts, gall bladders and appendices. Reports have it that ‚Äúhospital in a box‚Äù has successfully been used. The estimated cost of the basic hospital in a box was less than ¬£50,000 (around US $77,350) which was about one fifth of the cost made available for the same services.

'nanny jewel bug'), also known as the flat-headed wood-borer, is a metallic, bullet-shaped, woodboring beetle of the Buprestidae family. It is endemic to Japan. Habitat and appearance This insect is commonly found on the islands of Honsh≈´, Shikoku and Ky≈´sh≈´. The white, legless larvae are tadpole-shaped and grow to in length, while adults reach a length of in length and have brown and black stripes with gold flecks running the length of the body. This species is present from May through August and is attracted to sun, preferring to fly during the hottest part of the day, feeding on young buds and tree leaves. Reproduction The larvae are ideally adapted to woodboring, being dorsally flattened with a broad thorax. Females lay approximately 75 eggs in the crevices of bark or on wounded trees and sometimes in the exposed beams of older houses where they become serious pests. The larvae tunnel under the tree bark where they vigorously feed on wood. The larval stage of this insect may last for many years. Occasionally males are selectively killed at the embryo stage by bacteria known as Wolbachia. This can result in a limited number of males in the population. Females lacking a male can then reproduce using an asexual form of reproduction known as parthenogenesis.

Federal Register. August 8, 1997. Only 200 individuals were tallied in a 1996 survey. In 1997 the plant was listed as an endangered species on the federal level. Description Lithophragma maximum is a rhizomatous perennial herb growing erect or leaning with a slender naked flowering stem. The leaves are located on the lower part of the stem, each divided into three sharply toothed leaflets. The stem bears up to 25 flowers, each in a cuplike calyx of red or green sepals. The five petals are white or pink-tinged, approximately 4 millimeters long, and usually divided into about five pointed lobes. Conservation As of 2000 there were over 400 individuals remaining, but about one fourth of these are located in one canyon. All of the plants grow on land owned and tended by the United States Navy.Center for Plant Conservation The two main threats to the species have been erosion of the local habitat and the presence of feral goats and pigs. The latter issue was resolved when the Navy removed the feral herbivores. A genetic analysis revealed a relatively high genetic diversity across populations of this woodland star, probably due to the isolation of the populations from each other in the rugged, steep habitat. This suggests that it is important to protect each population in order to conserve the genetic variance in each.

Access to private health insurance is rationed on price and ability to pay. Those unable to afford a health insurance policy are unable to acquire a private plan except by employer-provided and other job-attached coverage, and insurance companies sometimes pre-screen applicants for pre-existing medical conditions. Applicants with such conditions may be declined cover or pay higher premiums and/or have extra conditions imposed such as a waiting period. The poor are given access to Medicaid, which is restricted by income and asset limits by means-testing, and other federal and state eligibility regulations apply. Health maintenance organizations (HMOs), which are common among the rest of the population, restrict access to treatment by financial and clinical access limits. Those 65 and older and a few others also qualify for Medicare, but it also has many restrictions. In the media and in academia, some have advocated explicit healthcare rationing to limit the cost of Medicare and Medicaid. They argue that a proper rationing mechanism would be more equitable and cost- effective.Peter G. Peterson on Charlie Rose-July 3 2009-About 17 min in NYT- Leonhardt-Healthcare Rationing Rhetoric Overlooks Reality-June 2009 The Congressional Budget Office (CBO) has argued that health care costs are the primary driver of government spending in the long term.CBO Testimony Background Peter Singer wrote for the New York Times Magazine in July 2009 that healthcare is rationed in the United States: David Leonhardt wrote in the New York Times in June 2009 that rationing presently an economic reality: \\"The choice isn't between rationing and not rationing. It's between rationing well and rationing badly. Given that the United States devotes far more of its economy to health care than other rich countries, and gets worse results by many measures, it's hard to argue that we are now rationing very rationally.\\" He wrote that there are three primary ways the US rations healthcare: #The increases in healthcare premiums reduce worker pay. In other words, more expensive insurance premiums reduce the growth in household income, which forces tradeoffs between healthcare services and other consumption. #The increases also prevent smaller companies from affording health insurance for their workers. #The cost prevents the certain types of care from being provided. During 2007, nearly 45% of US healthcare expenses were paid for by the government. In 2009, an estimated 46 million individuals in the United States did not have health insurance coverage. In 2008, Tia Powell led a New York State work group to set up guidelines for rationing ventilators during a potential flu pandemic.Cornelia Dean, Guidelines for Epidemics: Who Gets a Ventilator?, The New York Times, March 25, 2008 Methods used By insurance companies Dr. Gerald Grumet has chronicled how private insurers and third party payers delay and impede the utilization of medical services through creating inconvenience and confusion for both patients and physicians through complex claims review processes with layers of administrative handling that supersede the autonomy of treating physicians.\\"Health Care Rationing Through Inconvenience: The Third Party's Secret Weapon,\\" Grumet, Gerald W., M.D., New England Journal of Medicine. 1989 Aug 31; 321(9): 607-611. President Obama noted that US healthcare was rationed based on income, type of employment, and pre-existing medical conditions, with nearly 46 million uninsured. He stated that millions of Americans were denied coverage or face higher premiums because of pre-existing medical conditions. In an e-mail to Obama supporters, David Axelrod wrote, \\"Reform will stop 'rationing' - not increase it.... It‚Äôs a myth that reform will mean a 'government takeover' of health care or lead to 'rationing.' To the contrary, reform will forbid many forms of rationing that are currently being used by insurance companies.\\"Huffington Post-Nutter-Axelrod's Whitehouse E-mail-August 2009 A 2008 study by researchers at the Urban Institute found that health spending for uninsured non-elderly Americans was only about 43% of health spending for similar, privately-insured Americans. That implied rationing by price and ability to pay.NYT-Reinhardt-Rationing Healthcare-What Does it Mean? Fareed Zakaria wrote that only 38% of small businesses provided health insurance for their employees during 2009, versus 61% in 1993, because of rising costs.Washington Post-Zakaria-More Crises Needed?-August 2009 An investigation by the House Subcommittee on Oversight and Investigations showed that health insurers WellPoint Inc., UnitedHealth Group and Assurant Inc. canceled the coverage of more than 20,000 people, allowing the companies to avoid paying more than $300 million in medical claims over five years. It also found that policyholders with breast cancer, lymphoma, and more than 1000 other conditions were targeted for rescission and that employees were praised in performance reviews for terminating the policies of customers with expensive illnesses.How Would You Ration Health Care? Bloomberg Businessweek, citing LA Times article Private and public insurers all have their own drug formularies through which they set coverage limitations, which may include referrals to the insurance company for a decision on whether the company will approve its share of the costs. American formularies make generalized coverage decisions by class, with cheaper drugs at one end of the scale and more expensive drugs with more conditions for referral and possible denial at the other end. Not all drugs may be in the formulary of every company, and consumers are advised to check the formulary before they buy insurance.http://www.ahip.org/content/default.aspx?bc=41|329|20888 The phenomena known as medical bankruptcy is unheard of in countries with universal health care in which medical copayments are low or no nonexistent. In the United States, however, research shows that many bankruptcies have a strong medical component, even among the insured. Medical insurance before the Affordable Care Act allowed annual caps or lifetime caps on coverage, and the high cost of care made it common for insured persons to suffer bankruptcy after breaching those limits. By price A July 2009 NPR article quoted various doctors describing how America rations healthcare. Dr. Arthur Kellermann said: \\"In America, we strictly ration health care. We've done it for years.... But in contrast to other wealthy countries, we don't ration medical care on the basis of need or anticipated benefit. In this country, we mainly ration on the ability to pay. And that is especially evident when you examine the plight of the uninsured in the United States.\\"NPR-Healthcare Rationing Already Exists-July 2009 Rationing by price means accepting that there is no triage according to need. Thus, in the private sector, it is accepted that some people get expensive surgeries such as liver transplants or non-life-threatening ones such as cosmetic surgery, when others fail to get cheaper and much more cost-effective care such as prenatal care, which could save the lives of many fetuses and newborn children. Some places, like Oregon for example, explicitly ration Medicaid resources by using medical priorities.Time Magazine-Ethics: Rationing Medical Care-Sept 09 Polling has discovered that Americans are much more likely than Europeans or Canadians to forgo necessary health care (such not seeking a prescribed medicine) on the grounds of cost. According to a recent survey commissioned by Wolters Kluwer, the majority of physicians and nurses (79%) say the cost to the patient influences the treatment choices or recommendations the provider makes.Mending Healthcare in America 2020: Consumers + Cost Rationing by pharmaceutical companies Pharmaceutical manufacturers often charge much more for drugs in the United States than they charge for the same drugs in Britain, where they know that a higher price would put the drug outside the cost-effectiveness limits applied by regulators such as NICE. American patients, even if they are covered by Medicare or Medicaid, often cannot afford the copayments for drugs, which is rationing based on ability to pay. Rationing by government control After the death of Coby Howard in 1987 Oregon began a programme of public consultation to decide which procedures its Medicaid program should cover in an attempt to develop a transparent process for prioritizing medical services. Howard died of leukaemia, which was not funded. His mother spent the last weeks of his life trying to raise $100,000 to pay for a bone marrow transplant, but the boy died before treatment could begin. John Kitzhaber began a campaign arguing that thousands of low-income Oregonians lacked access to even basic health services, much less access to transplants. A panel of experts was appointed, the Health Services Commission, to develop a prioritized list of treatments. The state legislators decided where on the list of prioritised procedures the line of eligibility should be drawn. In 1995 there were 745 procedures, 581 of which were eligible for funding. Republican Newt Gingrich argued that the reform plans supported by President Obama expand the control of government over healthcare decisions, which he referred to as a type of healthcare rationing. He expressed concern that although there is nothing in the proposed laws that would constitute rationing, the combination of three factors would increase pressure on the government to ration care explicitly for the elderly: an expanded federal bureaucracy, the pending insolvency of Medicare within a decade, and the fact that 25% of Medicare costs are incurred in the final year of life. Princeton Professor Uwe Reinhardt wrote that both public and private healthcare programs can ration and rebutted the concept that governments alone impose rationing: \\"Many critics of the current health reform efforts would have us believe that only governments ration things.... On the other hand, these same people believe that when, for similar reasons, a private health insurer refuses to pay for a particular procedure or has a price-tiered formulary for drugs ‚Äì e.g., asking the insured to pay a 35 percent coinsurance rate on highly expensive biologic specialty drugs that effectively put that drug out of the patient's reach ‚Äî the insurer is not rationing health care. Instead, the insurer is merely allowing \\"consumers\\" (formerly \\"patients\\") to use their discretion on how to use their own money. The insurers are said to be managing prudently and efficiently, forcing patients to trade off the benefits of health care against their other budget priorities.\\"NYT-Rheinhardt-Rationing Healthcare: What Does It Mean?-July 2009 During 2009, former Alaska Governor Sarah Palin wrote against rationing by government entities, referring to what she interpreted as such an entity in current reform legislation as a \\"death panel\\" and \\"downright evil.\\" Defenders of the plan indicated that the proposed legislation, H.R. 3200, would allow Medicare for the first time to cover patient-doctor consultations about end-of-life planning, including discussions about drawing up a living will or planning hospice treatment. Patients would be allowed but not required to seek out such advice on their own. The provision would limit Medicare coverage to one consultation every five years. However, as governor, Palin had supported such end of life counseling and advance directives from patients in Alaska in 2008.Office of the Governor of Alaska-Healthcare Decisions Day Ezra Klein described in the Washington Post how polls indicate senior citizens are increasingly resistant to healthcare reform because of concerns about cuts to the existing Medicare program that may be required to fund it. That is creating an unusual and potent political alliance, with Republicans arguing to protect the existing Medicare program although they historically opposed that and other major entitlement programs.Washington Post-Ezra Klein-No Government Healthcare! (Except for Mine)-August 2009 The CBO scoring of the proposed H.R. 3200 (America's Affordable Health Choices Act of 2009) included $219 billion in savings over 10 years, some of which would come from Medicare changes.CBO Report-July 14 By economic value added A concept called \\"quality-adjusted life year\\" (QALY - pronounced \\"qualy\\") is used by Australian Medicare to measure the cost-benefit of applying a particular medical procedure. Ir reflects the quality and the quantity of life added by incurring a particular medical expense. The measure has been used for over 30 years in the country's universal single-payer healthcare system and has been implemented in several other countries to help with rationing decisions. Australia applies QALY measures to control costs and ration care and allows private supplemental insurance for those who can afford it. By comparative effectiveness research Medicare spending per person varied significantly across states in 2006 Several treatment alternatives may be available for a given medical condition, with significantly different costs but no statistical difference in outcome. Such scenarios offer the opportunity to maintain or improve the quality of care while significantly reducing costs through comparative effectiveness research. Writing in the New York Times, David Leonhardt described how the cost of treating the most common form of early-stage, slow- growing prostate cancer ranges from an average of $2,400 (watchful waiting to see if the condition deteriorates) to as high as $100,000 (radiation beam therapy):NYT-Leonhardt-In Health Reform, A Cancer Offers and Acid Test According to economist Peter A. Diamond and research cited by the Congressional Budget Office (CBO), the cost of healthcare per person in the US also varies significantly by geography and medical center, with little or no statistical difference in outcome:Peter Diamond-Healthcare and Behavioral Economics-May 2008 Comparative effectiveness research has shown that significant cost reductions are possible. Office of Management and Budget (OMB) Director Peter Orszag stated: \\"Nearly thirty percent of Medicare's costs could be saved without negatively affecting health outcomes if spending in high- and medium-cost areas could be reduced to the level of low-cost areas.\\"The New Yorker-Gawande-The Cost Conundrum-June 2009 President Obama has provided more than $1 billion in the 2009 stimulus package to jumpstart Comparative Effectiveness Research (CER) and to finance a federal CER advisory council to implement that idea. Economist Martin Feldstein wrote in the Wall Street Journal, \\"Comparative effectiveness could become the vehicle for deciding whether each method of treatment provides enough of an improvement in health care to justify its cost.\\"WSJ-Feldstein-Obamacare All About Rationing- August 2009 By government Former Republican Secretary of Commerce Peter George Peterson indicated that some form of rationing is inevitable and desirable considering the state of US finances and the trillions of dollars of unfunded Medicare liabilities. He estimated that 25 to 33% of healthcare services are provided to those in the last months or year of life and advocated restrictions if quality of life cannot be improved. He also recommended for a budget to be established for government healthcare expenses by establishing spending caps and pay-as-you-go rules that require tax increases for any incremental spending. He has indicated that a combination of tax increases and spending cuts will be required. He advocated addressing those issues under the aegis of a fiscal reform commission. Arizona modified its Medicaid coverage rules because of a budget problem that included denying care for expensive treatments such as organ transplants to Medicaid recipients, including those who had previously been promised funding. MSNBC's Keith Olbermann and others have dubbed Governor Jan Brewer and the state legislatures as a real life death panel because many of those poor people who are now being denied funding will lose their lives or have health because of the political decision. By age In the US, the discussion on rationing healthcare for the elderly began to be noticed widely in 1983 when economist Alan Greenspan asked \\"whether it is worth it\\" in referring to the use of 30% of the Medicare budget on 5‚Äì6% of those eligible who then die within a year of receiving treatment. In 1984, the Democratic governor of Colorado, Richard Lamm, was widely quoted but claimed to have been misquoted as saying that the elderly \\"have a duty to die and get out of the way.\\"\\"Gov. Lamm asserts elderly, if very ill, have 'DUTY TO DIE'\\". New York Times. March 29, 1984. Medical ethicist Daniel Callahan's 1987 Setting Limits: Medical Goals in an Aging SocietySetting Limits: Medical Goals in an Aging Society. Daniel Callahan. Edition reprint. Georgetown University Press, 1995 (orig. pub. 1987). . discusses whether healthcare should be rationed by age. He calls the elderly \\"a new social threat\\" and selfish and for age to be used as a criterion in limiting healthcare. Callahan's book has been widely discussed in the America media, including the New York Times, the Washington Post, the Wall Street Journal, and \\"just about every relevant professional and scholarly journal and newsletter.\\"Growing old in America. Beth B. Hess, Elizabeth Warren Markson. 4th Ed. Transaction Publishers, 1991. . p. 329. One of the major arguments against such age-based rationing is the fact that chronological age, by itself, is a poor indicator of health.Aging: Concepts and Controversies. Harry R. Moody, Director of Academic Affairs, AARP. 5th Ed. Pine Forge Press, 2006. . p.301. Another major argument against Callahan's proposal is that it inverts the Western tradition by making death a possible good and life a possible evil. Amherst College Jurisprudence Professor Robert Laurence Barry called Callahan's view \\"medical totalitarianism.\\" One book-length rebuttal to Callahan from half-a-dozen professors who held a conference at the University of Illinois College of Law in October 1989 was in 1991's Set No Limits: a Rebuttal to Daniel Callahan's Proposal to Limit Health, edited by Robert Laurence Barry and Gerard V. Bradley, a visiting professor of religious studies at the University of Illinois at Urbana‚ÄìChampaign. Arguments in favor Australian philosopher Peter Singer argued for rationing processes: Medicare and Medicaid Spending as a percentage of GDP The Congressional Budget Office reported in June 2008: In other words, all other federal spending categories (such as Social Security, defense, education, and transportation) would require borrowing to be funded, which is not feasible. President Obama stated in May 2009, \\"But we know that our families, our economy, and our nation itself will not succeed in the 21st century if we continue to be held down by the weight of rapidly rising health care costs and a broken health care system.... Our businesses will not be able to compete; our families will not be able to save or spend; our budgets will remain unsustainable unless we get health care costs under control.\\" Healthcare rationing remained a political topic into 2017, with Bernie Sanders and Ted Cruz debating on CNN whether a single-payer system would lead to healthcare rationing.

The Cyrtogomphoceratidae are endogastric, the Westonoceratidae, exogastric. Ulrichoceras has a cyrtoconic, endogastric shell that expands fairly rapidly to the middle of the body chamber, then contracts toward the aperture. The cross section is slightly depressed, atypical for cyrtogomphoceratids but not so for Reudemannoceratids; dorsal and ventro lateral sides are broadly rounded, the venter moderately flattened. Sutures have broad ventral lobes. The siphuncle is between the center and the venter; segments are short and not strongly contracted at the septal foremina, connecting rings are thickened and have enlarged bullettes. Ulrichoceras, named by Foerste, 1925, type U. beloitense, comes from the Middle Ordovician of Wisconsin, U.S.A.

He currently resides in the Bay Area, California. Early life He comes from a family of vocalists. His mother, Gladys Williams, performed in clubs around Baton Rouge with soul R&B; singer-pianist Bobby Powell and with blues singer and harmonica player, Raful Neal. Donnie' s father, Eddie McQuarter, is a gospel singer. And the R&B-turned-gospel; singer Beau Williams is a cousin. Williams made his public performing debut at age 11 at Mount Wade Baptist Church in Baton Rouge with a rendition of the Winans' \\"He Set Me Free.\\" At school, he and his sister Terrell, won first place in a talent show singing Bobby Brown and Whitney Houston's \\"Something in Common.\\" He made his nightclub debut at age 15 singing Sam Cooke's \\"A Change Is Gonna Come\\" at Raful Neal's blues bar in Baton Rouge. Before relocating to the Bay Area city of Livermore in 2000 with his mother and his four siblings, Williams made his recording debut singing hooks on a CD by the Baton Rouge hip-hop group Smoke Click. In Oakland, he did likewise for the hip-hop crew Big Bang Theory, with whom he performed locally, including opening a show for E-40. Career Donnie was lubing cars at Wal-Mart in Livermore in 2004 when two coworkers overheard him singing as he worked and suggested he try out for American Idol. One offered to drive him to Pasadena for the audition. They arrived and Williams sang \\"A Song for You\\" for judges Simon Cowell and Randy Jackson. Williams was quickly put through to Hollywood after receiving positive commentary from the judges. Williams made it into the Top 32 of American Idol's third season, along with Fantasia Barrino, Jennifer Hudson, and friend LaToya London. Some say he seemed a sure shot for the Top 12 but one night before he was slated to return to Hollywood for the next segment of the show, he was invited to a celebration party thrown by friends. He had too much to drink and was arrested on the way home for driving under the influence. As a result, the producers of American Idol kicked him off the show and replaced him with George Huff. Donnie was distraught. He quit drinking and his sobriety is reflected in the ballad \\"Higher Power\\" on his debut album Just Like Magic and particularly in the anti-substance abuse message of the video for the song. In its \\"Best of the East Bay 2008\\" issue, the East Bay Express Newspaper named him \\"The Best R&B; or Soul Singer\\" next to Goapele who won \\"Reader‚Äôs Choice Award.\\" In 2007 The San Francisco Chronicle called him \\"a soul stylist of the first order\\" who \\"might have given Fantasia Barrino some serious competition on \\"American Idol\\" if he had not been bounced from the show early in 2004 after a drunken-driving arrest.‚Äù Williams credits Stevie Wonder, Sam Cooke, Ron Isley and Donny Hathaway as influences and also includes gospel singers Marvin Winans and Dorinda Clark-Cole among his favorites. He has sung the national anthem at an NBA Warriors basketball game. Recordings A few years after being kicked off American Idol he returned with a fresh outlook on life. He hooked up with Park Place band leader and Bay Area based Paul Tillman Smith to begin recording his debut album Just Like Magic. Smith's compositions have been recorded in past years by such singers as Phyllis Hyman, Jean Carne, Lady Bianca, Freddie Hughes, Derrick Hughes, Lenny Williams, Rosie Gaines, and the late Prince vocalist Bonnie Boyer. Multi-instrumentalist Nelson Braxton (Frank McComb, Martin Luther, Ledisi, Braxton Brothers) and Norman Connors additionally serve as co-producers of the CD. Donnie says the lead single \\"Higher Power\\" was created to inspire a sense of hope. Guest vocalist LaToya London appears on \\"Send My Baby Back,\\" a 1968 hit by Berkeley vocalist Freddie Hughes. London additionally materializes in a duet on the title track 'Just Like Magic.' Several songs from \\"Just Like Magic\\" are featured in the upcoming film \\"Tears of a Clown\\" featuring BET Comedian D.C. Curry which was nominated for \\"Best Feature Film of the Year\\" at the Pan African Film Festival. \\"Just Like Magic\\" features Keyboardist and hip-hop MC Kev Choice (Voted by East Bay Express as \\"The Most Multi-Talented Musician\\") and who served as the musical tour director for Lauryn Hill in both 2006 and 2007. On keys Kev Choice has supported such artists as Michael Franti & Spearhead, Goapele, Too Short, Martin Luther, Jennifer Johns, DJ Quik and Zion I. Music can be heard from Keyboardist Sundra Manning who is most well known for her collaborative work alongside Grammy Nominated vocalist Ledisi on the debut album Soulsinger. Other cameos include vocalists Rosie Gaines and Bonnie Boyer (Prince), Keyboardists Michael Stanton, Rodney Franklin & Herman Jackson (musical director for Jessica Simpson, Stevie Wonder, the Isley Brothers and Marvin Gaye) Eric Daniels (musical director for Mariah Carey & Janet Jackson), Sax men Scott Mayo (Earth, Wind and Fire), Vince Lars & Charlie Spikes (Tony Toni Tone), Guitarists Carl Lockett and Tommy Oregon (Janet Jackson), drummer Brian Collier and the Oak Town Horns.

Gregory was also a Liberal member of the Legislative Assembly of Saskatchewan from 1934 to 1940 at The Battlefords provincial riding. He was first elected as a Liberal party candidate for the House of Commons at The Battlefords riding in the 1940 general election. After serving one term in the House of Commons, Gregory was defeated by Max Campbell of the Co-operative Commonwealth Federation in the 1945 federal election.

It is located in the City of Charles Sturt. History Brooker Residence, Queen St Croydon, approximately 1910 The land on which the suburb now stands was purchased in 1853 by Alfred Watts and Philip Levi. They laid out the Village of Croydon in 1855, comprising Croydon Farm of and lots of up to . The village may have been named after Croydon, England, then a part of Surrey, the same county in which Levi had been born. In 1904, market gardener and greengrocer John Brooker founded a jams and conserves business on Queen Street, producing \\"Croydon\\" branded products. The business prospered, leading to the construction of the Croydon Jam Factory on the corner of Queen Street and Princes Street in 1945. However production was soon moved to Woodville North in 1951. The Croydon factory became a warehouse for Godfreys Ltd., a whitegoods retailer. One of Croydon's first farm barns, later converted into a home in the 1920s exists far into a lot on Bedford Street, Croydon, a true example of a Brick and Stone building, proving Croydon's true history. This Original Barn, now renovated into a family home is believed to have been built by Richard Day who developed the suburb some 100 odd years ago. Richard Day, founder of Croydon, South Australia. Developed his own Huge Villa cottage on the site of 14 St Lawrence Ave in Croydon, it was demolished around the time of 1970 and a retirement village was built. A long dusty driveway starting from south road led to this Cottage. The original barn of this home still remains on Bedford St, Croydon. At this time, croydon was mainly farmland.

On postnatal day 15, motor coordination deficits were evident on horizontal bar and inclined or vertical grid tests in association with a weaker grip strength. Further differences were detected on postnatal day 22 and evaluation at the adult age revealed impairments indicative of permanent motor alterations. As adults, Dab1(scm) mutants showed motor coordination impairments on stationary beam, coat-hanger, and rotorod tests but were more active in the open-field. Dab1(scm) mutants were also less anxious in the elevated plus-maze but with higher latencies in the emergence test.

It is located in the City of Charles Sturt. History Hendon aerodrome plaque Initially part of Albert Park in the district of Woodville, the new suburb of Hendon was laid out in 1921 by Wilkinson, Sands and Wyles Ltd, on part of the land previously owned by the aviator, Harry Butler, who established the adjacent aerodrome there in 1920. Consequently, several streets were named after aircraft. The site of the \\"Hendon\\" aerodrome, also known as \\"Captain Butler's Aerodrome\\", was compulsorily acquired in July 1922 by the Civil Aviation branch of the Department of Defence, and used as the first \\"Adelaide Airport\\". By 1927 the site was becoming inadequate due to the increasing density of surrounding development and the erection of powerlines around its boundaries, so aviation operations were shifted to Parafield.Marsden, Susan (1977): A history of Woodville. Corporation of the City of Woodville. Pp. 169-176. The Commonwealth had originally intended to fund the development of Parafield Aerodrome through the subdivision and sale of the land at Hendon, but with the end of the 1920s economic boom, these plans lapsed and the site remained as a cow pasture. Soon after the outbreak of World War II the still vacant former Hendon aerodrome was one of three sites in South Australia set up as munitions factories (the others were at nearby Finsbury, and Salisbury). The Hendon factory, used to manufacture small arms ammunition, was serviced by an adjacent railway station located on a spur from the Grange railway line; after the station's closure in 1980, the rail corridor was later reused for the easternmost section of West Lakes Boulevard. By 1947 the entire site of the former munitions factory had been acquired by Philips Electrical Industries.Trove collection, National Library of Australia Hendon's new role The Advertiser, 23 April 1947.

At its peak in the late 1950s the factory employed almost 3,500 skilled workers, mostly women, who were valued for their dexterity and patience. The company's activities were progressively reduced during the 1970s, but one notable feature of the period was the collaboration of the company with the Polish-Australian artist Stan Ostoja-Kotkowski, a pioneer of the use of laser, sound and image technology in art.Dr Ian Macdonald: Explorer in Sound and Light, a study of the works of Joseph Stanislaw Ostoja-Kotkowski Accessed 26 March 2014.

Tiselius, with support from the Rockefeller Foundation, developed the \\"Tiselius apparatus\\" for moving boundary electrophoresis, which was described in 1937 in the well-known paper \\"A New Apparatus for Electrophoretic Analysis of Colloidal Mixtures\\". The method spread slowly until the advent of effective zone electrophoresis methods in the 1940s and 1950s, which used filter paper or gels as supporting media. By the 1960s, increasingly sophisticated gel electrophoresis methods made it possible to separate biological molecules based on minute physical and chemical differences, helping to drive the rise of molecular biology. Gel electrophoresis and related techniques became the basis for a wide range of biochemical methods, such as protein fingerprinting, Southern blot, other blotting procedures, DNA sequencing, and many more. Electrophoresis before Tiselius Early work with the basic principle of electrophoresis dates to the early 19th century, based on Faraday's laws of electrolysis proposed in the late 18th century and other early electrochemistry. Experiments by Johann Wilhelm Hittorf, Walther Nernst, and Friedrich Kohlrausch to measure the properties and behavior of small ions moving through aqueous solutions under the influence of an electric field led to general mathematical descriptions of the electrochemistry of aqueous solutions. Kohlrausch created equations for varying concentrations of charged particles moving through solution, including sharp moving boundaries of migrating particles. By the beginning of the 20th century, electrochemists had found that such moving boundaries of charged particles could be created with U-shaped glass tubes.Vesterberg, pp. 4-5 Methods of optical detection of moving boundaries in liquids had been developed by August Toepler in the 1860s; Toepler measured the schlieren (shadows) or slight variations in optical properties that in inhomogeneous solutions. This method combined with the theoretical and experimental methods for creating and analysing charged moving boundaries would form the basis of Tiselius's moving boundary electrophoresis method.Vesterberg, p. 5 Development and spread of the Tiselius apparatus The apparatus designed by Arne Tiselius enabled a range of new applications of electrophoresis in analyzing chemical mixtures. Its development, significantly funded by the Rockefeller Foundation, was an extension of Tiselius's earlier PhD studies. With more assistance from the Rockefeller Foundation, the expensive Tiselius apparatus was built at a number of major centers of chemical research. Rise of zone electrophoresis By the late 1940s, new electrophoresis methods were beginning to address some of the shortcomings of the moving boundary electrophoresis of the Tiselius apparatus, which was not capable of completely separating electrophoretically similar compounds. Rather than charged molecules moving freely through solutions, the new methods used solid or gel matrices to separate compounds into discrete and stable bands (zones); in 1950 Tiselius dubbed these methods \\"zone electrophoresis\\". Zone electrophoresis found widespread application in biochemistry after Oliver Smithies introduced starch gel as an electrophoretic substrate in 1955. Starch gel (and later polyacrylamide and other gels) enabled the efficient separation of proteins, making it possible with relatively simple technology to analyze complex protein mixtures and identify minute differences in related proteins. Widespread application Since the 1950s, electrophoresis methods have diversified considerably, and new methods and applications are still being developed as Affinity electrophoresis, Capillary electrophoresis, Electroblotting, Electrophoretic mobility shift assay, Isotachophoresis, Pulsed-field gel electrophoresis, and Preparative electrophoresis.

It is located on the road between Bolderwood and Emery Down, approximately from the latter. It is near to Millyford Bridge and is used as a Waymark.http://www.rffs.org.uk/archived%20programmes/Programme_March_June_2008.html Because it was also operated by the Canadian Forestry Corps, it is also referred to locally as the Canadian Fireplace. Plaque Plaque located next to the Portuguese fireplace Next to the memorial is a plaque explaining the significance of the fireplace which reads: \\"This is the site of a hutted camp occupied by a Portuguese army unit during the first World War. This unit assisted the depleted local labour force in producing timber for the war effort. The Forestry Commission have retained the fireplace from the cookhouse as a memorial to the men who lived and worked here and acknowledge the financial assistance of the Portuguese government in its renovation.\\" In World War I, local labour was in short supply due to the war effort. In order to help with the timber production for the war, a Portuguese Army unit with the Canadian Timber Corps helped the local population whilst local foresters were away fighting. The fireplace is what remains of the cookhouse of the camp of those people who lived, worked and helped out in the area. History of the camp On 15 February 1916, 18 months after the beginning of the First World War, the Colonial Secretary cabled to the then Governor- General of Canada, H.R.H. the Duke of Connaught, that Canadian timber could no longer be imported on a large enough scale to meet requirements for the war as there was not enough freight for munitions, food, forage and other essential items due to the scarce number of people available. This required the felling of English forests and woodlands in order to meet the requirements. Of chief concern was finding enough skilled labour, in particular, fellers, hauliers and sawyers. Therefore, they requested that a First Battalion of Lumbermen be formed of 1500 Canadian workers to come over to Great Britain to help out. The Canadian government was quick to respond and sent them over in batches. To save time, the Canadians brought over their own equipment and modifications were made to adapt to being in Britain. The differences in conditions were so great between Canada and Britain that it required highly expert knowledge to carry out the changes. This was done very quickly and few changes then had to be made again. The Canadian lumbermen were of unknown quantity as were the conditions in Britain to the Canadians. An initial advance party of 15 Canadians set up in a camp near Lyndhurst. The actual first 400 Canadians set up in the South of England to facilitate organisation with later contingents setting up elsewhere in the UK. In 1917‚Äì1918, the Canadian Forestry Corps received help from Portuguese labourers. A typical encampment was 4 to in size. The camp was surrounded by four fences of various sizes and also included a mess room, canteen, sleeping quarters, wash and bath houses, tailors' and boot shops, laundry, drying room, cookhouse, hospital and non-commissioned officer's quarters and electricity was included. Guards were positioned at wooden and barbed wire gates as well as strategic points around the camp. There were 25 huts on site for workshops and various other uses. At the height of the camp's usage there were around 100 Portuguese and 200 Canadian and associated workers on site. Light railways were built by the Canadians with a single locomotive, and this helped to speed up the timber production. The Canadians moved from a camp in Norley Wood in the south of the New Forest and were better equipped for the environment than were the Portuguese, who at one point went on strike because they were not even given oilskins. The Canadians were better equipped than the Portuguese. Special arrangements had to be made so that Canadians and Portuguese got abundant food and the food they required as there was a difference in diversity. The Portuguese required a diet of largely fish, bread, potatoes, beans, rice and olive oil as well as green vegetables and onions. Eventually it was decided that Portuguese were better used for other work than timber as the workers found best suited were Finnish and prisoners of war.

No one was injured, but the battleship remained stuck for over two weeks before being freed from the sand. The ship was so damaged that she had to return to port and enter dry dock for repairs. After the battleship was freed, a naval court of inquiry found Captain William D. Brown and a handful of other naval officers guilty of negligence. Brown was moved down 250 places on the promotion list, effectively ending his naval career. Missouri was repaired and reentered service with the active fleet shortly afterward. She would go on to serve in the Korean War before being decommissioned in 1954. She entered the Puget Sound Reserve Fleet in Bremerton, Washington, where she remained until being reactivated in 1984 as part of the 600-ship Navy plan put forth by then President Ronald Reagan and his Navy Secretary John Lehman.  Background  Missouri was one of the \\"fast battleship\\" designs planned in 1938 by the Preliminary Design Branch at the Bureau of Construction and Repair. She was laid down at the Brooklyn Navy Yard on 6 January 1941, launched on 29 January 1944 and commissioned on 11 June. The ship was the third of the Iowa class, but the fourth and final Iowa- class ship commissioned by the United States Navy. The ship was christened at her launching by Mary Margaret Truman, daughter of Harry S. Truman, then a United States senator from Missouri. Missouri (at left) transferring personnel to , while operating off Japan on 20 August 1945. Missouri was active in the Pacific Theatre of World War II, escorting the Fast Carrier Task Forces and shelling beachheads for Allied Army and Marine Corps personnel involved in amphibious operations against the Imperial Japanese forces. After the atomic bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki the Empire of Japan capitulated to Allied demands, signing the instrument of surrender to the allied powers aboard Missouri on 2 September 1945. Between 1945 and 1950 the US fleet of battleships had been entirely decommissioned; however, Missouri was spared this fate due to the influence of now-President Truman, who refused to allow the battleship to be decommissioned, and against the advice of Secretary of Defense Louis Johnson, Secretary of the Navy John L. Sullivan, and Chief of Naval Operations Louis E. Denfeld, Truman ordered Missouri to be maintained with the active fleet partly because of his fondness for the battleship and partly because the battleship had been christened by his daughter. As a result, Missouri was involved in various training and flag waving exercises at home and abroad between World War II and the Korean War.Bonner, pp. 24‚Äì32  Events leading to the accident  In October 1949, amid increasing political scrutiny,Although Missouri had fought against the Japanese in the Pacific Theatre of World War II she was rendered obsolete by the aircraft carrier, and this obsolescence extended past her time in World War II and into the Cold War with the rise of long-range bombers which could carry nuclear ordnance and ICBMs. When combined with the ongoing military drawdown of the armed services and the merger of the formerly independent Department of the Navy and Department of War into the newly created Department of Defense in accordance with the National Security Act of 1947 the Navy came under increasing attacks for being unneeded in an age when it was believed that the Army and Air Force could do the same jobs as the Marine Corps and Navy. This hostile disagreement between the services branches erupted into a war of words in 1949 when then Secretary of Defense Louis A. Johnson canceled , the first of the so called \\"supercarriers\\"; fallout from this incident ultimately compelled the United State Congress to hold hearings on the matter. Missouri arrived at the Norfolk Naval Shipyard for three months of scheduled maintenance. During this period Captain Harold Page Smith was relieved by Captain William D. Brown. A graduate of Annapolis and veteran of 30 years, Captain Brown had amassed a distinguished record commanding submarines and destroyers, but had never commanded a ship the size of Missouri, and had not been to sea in a command capacity since World War II.Newell, p. 11Stillwell, p. 145 Captain Brown formally assumed command of Missouri on 10 December, just ahead of the completion of maintenance work on the battleship. On 23 December, Brown took the battleship out for a brief trip around the Virginia capes and returned to Norfolk on Christmas Eve. Her next scheduled departure was 17 January, at which time Missouri was to sail to Guantanamo Bay for maneuvers. On 13 January, Brown received a request from the Naval Ordnance Laboratory for the Missouri to proceed through a channel in which the United States Navy had strewn acoustic cables as part of an ongoing project that aimed to identify ships by their propeller signatures. The request was entirely optional, but as the captain was preoccupied with the details of the upcoming sortie to Cuba he gave the letter little attention and instead referred the matter to his operations officer, Commander John R. Millett, who in turn referred the letter to the ship's navigator, Lieutenant Commander Frank G. Morris.Newell, p. 71Stillwell, p.. 146 On 14 January, Captain Brown and his operations and navigating officers met to discuss the upcoming cruise to Cuba and the details surrounding this cruise, and also talk briefly about the acoustical test they were to run. The ship was to pass between two orange-and-white-striped buoys that marked the entrance and exit from the range. The range itself was located precariously close to the \\"danger bearing\\"‚Äîthe shoal area in which the safe of water that could accommodate a ship shoaled to only . To make matters worse, the range through which Missouri was to pass had originally been marked with five buoys, but this number had been reduced to two buoys two days prior to the arrival of Captain Brown. Morris was aware that three of the five buoys had been removed from the range, but had not received authorization to delete the non-existent buoys from the chart. Although informed of this during the conference, Captain Brown and Commander Millett left the conference under the mistaken belief that there were still five buoys marking the acoustical range.  Grounding  At 7:25 am 17 January 1950 Missouri set sail for the Atlantic Ocean with harbor pilot R. B. McCoy at the helm. Because of the better view afforded on the forward mast structure, the battleship was sailed through the Chesapeake Bay from the eighth level of the battleship's forward mast structure. At the time she had a full complement of ammunition and water, and her fuel tanks were 95% full, which brought Missouris total displacement to 57,000 tons; she drew at her bow and at her stern. At 7:49 am, near the Elizabeth River Channel Buoy 3, the pilot turned control of the battleship over to Captain Brown and departed for shore. The weather was clear and Missouri was now free to run through the acoustic channel. Missouri sailed toward two red markers that Commander George Peckham believed marked the shoal water in the channel. With the departure of R. B. McCoy, Captain Brown assumed full command of Missouri. He ordered the battleship engines brought to two- thirds speed and order a course set for 053 on the recommendation of navigator, Lieutenant Commander Morris. The tower aboard Missouri from which the Captain Brown conned the battleship during the grounding accident. This was taken after Missouris 1986 recommissioning, as is evidenced by the 20 mm Phalanx CIWS gun located just to the right of the bridge. At 8:05 am, as Missouri sailed past Fort Wool, Captain Brown turned control of the ship (known in naval terms as the \\"conn\\" of the ship) over to the officer of the deck and departed for the chart house. His arrival at the chart house caused Ensign E. R. Harris, who had been tracking the battleship's course on the chart, to move away from the table, resulting in the interruption of the plot. Around the same time Captain Brown informed Commander Peckham that Missouri would soon run an acoustical range. This was the first time that the executive officer had heard about a planned acoustical range run.Newell, p. 72 Approximately two minutes after departing for the chart room, Captain Brown reemerged on the open bridge and reassumed the conn of the battleship. He summoned Lieutenants Hatfield and Arnold, Missouris morning and forenoon officers of the watch, respectively, and informed them of the planned run through the acoustical range. As with Commander Peckham, this was the first time that either of these two men had heard anything about the planned acoustical test run. When Captain Brown noted their confused looks, he promptly informed the men to \\"Go get yourselves informed\\", at which point both officers reported to the chart room on level eight. There they learned of the impending run through the acoustical range by looking at the chart with the buoys marking the range; despite this, both remained confused over aspects of the planned run.Stillwell, pp. 146‚Äì147 At 8:10 am Captain Brown ordered a course change to 060 degrees and informed the men that the conn for the battleship would remain on the eighth-level bridge until they cleared the course. This was unusual for Missouri, as the conn was usually shifted to the fourth-level bridge during the transit at the point when a ship passed Fort Wool and Old Point Comfort. The initial course change to 060 was altered to 058 as a result of a strong ocean current that swung Missouri too far to the right during the course correction.Stillwell, p. 147 It was at this point that the first indication that something was dangerously amiss during the transit occurred. The executive officer, who passed through the chart room while preparing for the shift change, noticed that Missouri was rapidly approaching the shoal water, and promptly told Morris \\"For God's sake watch it!\\" At the same time a discussion occurred on the eighth-level bridge as to whether it would be advisable for the battleship's speed to be increased to 15 knots. Morris and Millet differed in opinion on the idea; the former felt speed should be reduced five knots, and the latter felt that any steady speed held during the transition would be okay. Captain Brown therefore decided to increase speed to 15 knots, and the engine room replied by increasing power. Around the same time, Lieutenant Arnold located a small buoy with orange-and- white stripes away. Initially this buoy was identified as one of the acoustical range markers as a result of the letter \\"B\\" painted on it, but this information was not properly relayed to the rest of the crew. Mistakenly believing that this was the marker for the right side of the range, both Captain Brown and the battleship's operation's officer agreed to order the battleship to pass to the left of the marker. By then Missouri was sailing for the danger line marking the separation between the deep water of the channel into the shallow water of the shoals. This was made apparent when a pair of spar buoys marking the entrance to a shallow fishing channel appeared ahead of Missouri. Brown incorrectly identified these markers as the end of the acoustical range, but several of the quartermasters, as well as Commander Peckham, Lieutenant Arnold, and other officers knew this was an incorrect assumption. It was at this point the first recommendation to turn right was made by Morris, the navigator; Brown declined because of his mistaken belief that the markers for the fish channel were actually the end of the acoustical range. A similar recommendation from Commander Peckham also went unheeded.Newell, p. 77 Around the same time in Missouris Combat Information Center (CIC) crew members manning the battleship's navigational radar system noticed that the radar returns indicated that Missouri was steaming for dangerous waters; however, the CIC crew did not report this information to the captain. Lieutenant John Carr, the officer on duty in the CIC at the time of the grounding, concluded that the radar equipment was likely not operating correctly. Carr later explained the decision not to report the radar information by stating, \\"the standard practice on board ship did not call for radar advice to the bridge in the absence of specific requests.\\" He also pointed out that the fathometer, a water depth-reading instrument, was out of order and had not been repaired in the yard.Stillwell, pp. 147‚Äì148 At 8:15 am Missouri crossed the danger bearing into the shoal water. At this time Commander Peckham sent a message to Captain Brown stating \\"Ship heading into Danger shoals. Recommend you come right immediately!\\", but this message was relayed by \\"talkers\\" (men charged with relaying messages for officers to different stations) and the talker who was supposed to pass Peckham's message to Brown had a tendency to mumble badly. At the same time Peckham was attempting to alert Brown of the impending grounding, Morris again approached Brown and recommended coming right to avoid the shoal water. Captain Brown did not recall being informed of this, and made no reply to Morris. At this point Morris took a bearing on Thimble Shoals, and alarmed at the impending grounding Morris frantically returned to the captain waving his arms and shouting \\"Come right! There's shoal water ahead!\\" A disbelieving Captain Brown dismissed Morris' pleas by stating that it was his belief that the navigator did not know where they were. To verify Morris' claims of impending shoal water, Brown asked Commander Millet to check Morris's position. As a precautionary move, Brown then ordered Quartermaster Travis, Missouris helmsman, to alter course to 058, but this order came too late. At 8:17 am, Missouri slid up on a shoal (or mud bar) and stuck to the ground. In a last- ditch effort to save the ship, Peckham sent a message to Brown stating \\"Come right immediately! Twist ship!\\",This order, if followed, would have resulted in the battleship making a hard right turn, while the engine room would have reversed the starboard engines and set the port engines to full, which would have aided Missouri by bringing her full engine power into the turn as well. (Newell, p. 77) but this effort was too little, too late; Missouri had already run aground. Her hull had traveled approximately ,Stillwell, p. 148 which was very nearly the entire length of the shoal, raising the battleship several feet out of the water, and her engines were shut down after the bay sand began to clog the battleship's intakes in engineering.This swift response from the engineers aboard Missouri in the aftermath of the grounding earned the engineers commendations for their quick reaction. Had the engines not been shut down so swiftly, more serious damage to the battleship may have occurred; as it was, the loss of the engines eliminated the electrical power aboard the ship and caused the emergency diesel generators to switch on. The generators were unable to operate long though, owing to the presence of sand in the condensers. (Stillwell, p. 150) She had come to rest on an almost even keel on the sandbar within plain sight of \\"Admirals Row\\", the historic homes along Dillingham Boulevard at Naval Station Norfolk occupied by 18 flag officers of the United States Navy stationed at Hampton Roads, and the homes of a similar number of high-ranking officers of the United States Army stationed at Fort Monroe.Newell, p. 78  Salvage  By 8:30 am a request went out summoning all available tugs to the site of the grounding with the hope that they would be able to free the leviathan before any further damage occurred. An attempt made by Missouris sailors on the day of the grounding met with failure, as did an initial attempt to pull Missouri back into deep water with sixteen tugboats.Stillwell, p. 153 Before the tugs could lend any further assistance, the naval brass postponed the attempt, pending the outcome of further assessment. Missouri had traversed the shoal nearly 2,500 feet, and to compound her problem she had run aground during an unusually high tide. To add insult to injury, she had become the butt of a number of bad jokes among the American public, the Navy's rival service branches, and the Soviet Union's Atlantic fleet, who were quick to pounce upon the dreadnought's grounding as material for the naval publication Red Fleet.Newell, p. 80 Initially, high- ranking US Navy officials elected to contract a private salvage firm to free the battleship, but Admiral Smith, at the time Commander, Cruisers, Atlantic, and the man who was responsible for issuing Missouris orders disagreed with this plan. He reasoned that if the Navy got her on to the shoal, then they should be responsible for getting her off the shoal. Ultimately, he won his case for a US Navy salvage effort, but he was explicitly informed by officials at The Pentagon that his career would ride on his ability to successfully get Missouri back into deep water. To better organize the salvage effort, Smith and a number of men on his staff moved aboard Missouri to supervise her return to deep water.Stillwell, p. 150 Smith's supervision also extended to answering the nearly 10,000 letters sent to the Navy from concerned citizens offering advice on how to get the battleship back into deep water.Stillwell, p. 151 Admiral Wallin, seen here c. 1951‚Äì1953, was singled out for command of the Missouri salvage operation Commanding this salvage effort was Rear Admiral Homer N. Wallin. Wallin was the Navy Yard Commandant at Norfolk, and as a captain he had been instrumental in cleaning up the mess left by the Imperial Japanese Navy after the 7 December 1941 air raid that brought the United States into World War II. In total the salvage team that Wallin commanded successfully resurrected 19 of the 21 ships initially declared total losses and helped to refit those ships to serve in the Second World War. Wallin pledged to assist in the salvage effort, and initiated a five-point plan aimed at getting Missouri off the mud and back into the water:Later it would be concluded that if Missouri had to go aground her locale was perfect; she had grounded in protected waters and in an area abundant with salvage equipment. (Stillwell, p. 151) * Remove as much weight as possible from the battleship,Stillwell, p. 152 * Lift the ship,This would later be accomplished with the use of pontoons. (Stillwell, p. 153) * Remove as much sand as possible from around the battleship, * Use the combined power of the area's tugboats to pull the battleship, * Dredge the channel to provide deep water for Missouri to reenter the shipping lanes. Because Missouri had run aground during an unusually high tide, Wallin required a date on which the tide would be roughly comparable to the conditions under which Missouri was grounded in order to free her. The date selected was 2 February.Stillwell, pp. 152‚Äì153 With time as a factor, Wallin took charge of the operation and put his five- point plan into motion. With the assistance of Admiral Smith, Wallin was able to assemble a large salvage force which included submarine rescue ships, special salvage ships, divers, and pontoons to add additional buoyancy for the tug boats when the time came to move Missouri. On 19 January, Comber, an army dredge, arrived at the site of the Missouri grounding and began the process of sucking mud out of the intended path through which Missouri would be freed. On 22 January, Comber was joined by the civilian-run dredge Washington in the dredging phase of Wallin's plan. Around the time the dredging began, Missouris crew began offloading all non-essential items. Both 16-inch and 5-inch shells, powder, food, drink, and other materials were removed from the battleship and placed aboard barges and other ships to help lighten Missouri. At the same time, the fleet oilers and began the process of offloading Missouris fuel. As the fuel was required to operate the generators aboard Missouri, its absence resulted in a shift from supplying the power Missouri required with her own generators to relying on the submarine rescue ships for power and water needs.Stillwell, p. 154 Originally, the weight-reduction phase had included removing the anchors from the battleship, but Wallin ordered one of the anchors to be reattached. His reason for doing so was that the anchor would effectively shift Missouris center of gravity forward to a narrower part of the battleship, thereby reducing the friction at her widest point. During this time, the Bureau of Ships offered valuable technical and salvage advice to both the civilian and military participants in the salvage effort.Stillwell, p. 156 On 31 January, an attempt was made to free Missouri with the assembled collection of tug boats and salvage ships. This attempt was ultimately unsuccessful, owing to an anchor from a previous wreck that had become embedded in Missouris hull. The extreme force generated by the tugs caused several two-inch cables made from wire rope to break, and the failed attempt also revealed that Missouri needed to lose more weight if the next attempt was to be successful. In light of this, some additional changes were made for the next attempt, which included cutting the anchors and chains off the battleship‚Äîafter they had been re-added at Wallin's request‚Äîand the inclusion of additional pontoons to help lighten Missouri even more. A second attempt was tentatively scheduled for 1 February.  Missouri freed  The hull of the incomplete battleship is floated out of drydock to allow Missouri to enter drydock for repairs On 1 February Missouri was finally freed with the assistance of 23 vessels. Five tug boats pulled alongside, six pulled astern, and three swung to the bow to facilitate movement. Additionally, two Gypsy- class salvage vessels, and , and seven yard tugs helped keep the other vessels in place. Kedge anchors were also used to expedite the process. About the time that Missouri began to move again, she suffered one last incident: while being towed off the shoal, she bumped into Windlass, wiping out a portion of Windlasss side railing. However, the damage was insignificant, and as the battleship slowly returned to the harbor, the band played Missouri Waltz, Anchors Aweigh, and Nobody Knows the Trouble I've Seen. Crewmen also hoisted battle flags and hoisted signal flags which read \\"Reporting for Duty\\". A Norfolk harbor pilot was responsible for issuing the engine and rudder orders to the battleship, while Missouris own navigator issued course orders for the battleship during the tow.Stillwell, p. 157 With an audience observing the process, Missouri finally returned to the deep water at 7:09 am. Following her liberation from the muddy shoal, Missouri was towed back to the naval yard where her incomplete sister ship had been removed from dry dock to allow Missouri to undergo repairs, which‚Äîapart from structural inspection‚Äîincluded replacement of some of her double-bottom plating that had buckled and ruptured three fuel tanks.  Aftermath  Captain Brown was court-martialed as a result of the incident, pleaded guilty, and was relieved of command of Missouri. As a result of his plea, he suffered the loss of 250 places on the list of captains awaiting ships. He spent the rest of his active duty time on shore duty. Four others were court-martialed, two were cleared of all charges, one received a letter of reprimand, and one was reduced on the promotion list. Despite these setbacks, Missouri was repaired and returned to fleet. She stayed in commission throughout the Korean War, and‚Äîafter the cease-fire agreement‚Äîwas decommissioned into the United States Navy reserve fleets, where she remained until the 1980s. Despite proof to the contrary, rumors continued to circulate that Missouri suffered permanent damage as a result of the grounding incident. Thereafter, the ship was sometimes referred to as the \\"Muddy Mo,\\" a takeoff on \\"Mighty Mo\\".Maritime quest.com  Notes   References   Bibliography    * Category:1950 disasters in the United States Category:Iowa-class battleships Category:Maritime incidents in 1950 Category:United States Navy in the 20th century Category:Non-combat naval accidents Category:1950 in Virginia ","title":"1950 USS Missouri grounding"},{"id":"24011400","title":"List of airlines of Spain"},{"id":"24011401","text":"Zhangixalus suffry is a species of flying frog first described to science in 2007.IUCN It is endemic to the eastern Himalayas.http://www.panda.org/wwf_news/news/?uNewsID=171701 References suffry Category:Amphibians described in 2007 ","title":"Zhangixalus suffry"},{"id":"24011402","text":"Salix barrattiana is a species of flowering plant in the willow family known by the common name Barratt's willow.

Empty dwelling management orders (EDMOs) are a legal device used in England and Wales, which enable local authorities to put an unoccupied property back into use as housing. EDMOs were created by the Housing Act 2004, with the relevant legislation coming into effect in mid-2006;Sections 132 through 138; see also Schedule 7 of the Act. in the three and a half years to the end of 2010, however, only 43 had been issued. Background A significant number of residential properties in Britain are empty at any one time; whilst a large proportion of these are empty on a temporary basis, for example during refurbishment or during changes in ownership, many remain unoccupied for long stretches of time. These properties pose a problem in two ways; they tend to decrease the quality of life in their area, by becoming magnets for vandalism and the like, and they indirectly contribute to the problem of homelessness by limiting the pool of available housing. Local authorities have traditionally had a number of powers to force abandoned buildings back into use, most notably the power of compulsory purchase and enforced sale. In the first of these cases, the property is purchased by the council; in the second, the owner is compelled to offer it for sale in the open market. However, both of these required a forcible change of ownership, and especially with an enforced sale, there was no guarantee that the building would actually be put back into use. In 2001, the Empty Homes Agency suggested that rather than force the properties to be sold, the local authorities could instead force them to be rented out to tenants, a \\"compulsory leasing\\" process. A parliamentary select committee adopted the idea, but government support for legislation was limited. In 2003, as the government drafted plans for housing reform, it issued consultation papers on a proposed form of \\"empty homes management orders\\", but they were not made part of the final Housing Bill. They were added to the bill, now titled as \\"empty dwelling management orders\\", in an amendment by David Kidney MP, with broad cross-party support.\\"Story So Far...\\", Guide to Empty Dwelling Management Orders Whilst they had broad parliamentary support, the EDMOs were strongly criticised in some sections of the media, with the Daily Express reporting that the government wanted to seize 250,000 homes, and a columnist in the Sunday Times declaring that Britain had become a \\"communist country\\". In 2015, Peter Box, spokesman for the Local Government Association, said that councils considered EDMOs \\"complex and difficult to use.\\" Brandon Lewis, speaking as housing minister, said that EDMOs were \\"an ineffective and unpopular policy of the last administration, which undermined civil liberties and which simply didn't work.\\" The legislation first came into force in 2006, but no orders were issued that year. As of June 2009, 24 interim EDMOs had been approved, \\"nearly half\\" of which had been approved in the preceding twelve months;House of Lords written answer by Lord McKenzie of Luton, 24 June 2009 by the end of 2010, a total of 43 had been approved.House of Commons written answer by Andrew Stunell, 1 February 2011 Powers A local authority wishing to use an EDMO must apply to a residential property tribunal for approval of an interim order, the first stage in the process. The tribunal must be satisfied that the property has been empty for at least two years, as well as being heavily vandalised or actively used for \\"antisocial\\" purposes.House of Commons statement by Eric Pickles, 10 January 2011 The regulations originally stated that a house simply had to be unoccupied for six months and not likely to be occupied in the near future, with a good chance that if an EDMO was granted it would be put back into use.Empty Dwelling Management Orders: Guidance for residential property owners, p.3 However, this period was extended by the Coalition government following the 2010 United Kingdom general election, with the new policy coming into force in November 2012.Wilson, Wendy (2012). Empty Dwelling Management Orders (EDMOs) - Commons Library Standard Note. The new regulations also require that the property be \\"causing a nuisance for the community\\", and that there is local support for the use of an EDMO.The Housing (Empty Dwelling Management Orders) (Prescribed Period of Time and Additional Prescribed Requirements) (England) (Amendment) Order 2012. Statutory Instrument 2012 no. 2625. Certain classes of property are completely exempt ‚Äì houses temporarily unoccupied because the resident is in care, for example, or holiday homes. Properties in the process of being sold or let are likewise exempt. The tribunal is not required to grant requests which comply with the requirements, and where it does grant the request there is an appeals process for property owners.Empty Dwelling Management Orders: Guidance for residential property owners, p.4 The orders cannot be granted for partly occupied buildings ‚Äì so it cannot be used on an empty set of lodger's rooms within a house ‚Äì or for non-residential properties.Empty Dwelling Management Orders: Guidance for residential property owners, p.5 Once an interim EDMO has been granted, it lasts for up to twelve months, during which the authority works with the owner to try and agree a way to put the property back into use. The authority is considered legally in possession (in control) of the property during this time, but does not gain legal ownership; it can change the locks but not sell the house. If no agreement is reached during this time, and the building remains unoccupied, the authority may make a final EDMO, which lasts for up to seven years. A final EDMO differs from an interim EDMO in that the authority is not required to obtain the owner's consent before finding a tenant for the property.Empty Dwelling Management Orders: Guidance for residential property owners, p.1 If the authority fails to find an occupier for the property, or decides it cannot reasonably get the property occupied, it must hand back possession to the owner. When a tenant has been found under the EDMO, the rent is paid to the local authority, who are able to recover any costs they may have incurred by taking possession of the property and making it habitable, as well as the routine costs of maintenance and letting. However, any money over and above these costs is to be paid to the owner of the property.Empty Dwelling Management Orders: Guidance for residential property owners, p.10 Notes References Empty Dwelling Management Orders: Guidance for residential property owners.

It is the most saline of nine such lagoons (often referred to as \\"salt ponds\\") in southern Rhode Island. Geography Quonochontaug Pond is the deepest and most saline of the salt ponds. It is connected directly to the sea by a breachway that was stabilized with rock jetties by the US Army Corps of Engineers in the 1950s. And, as in the other ponds, sand eroding from the ocean side of the barrier beach is transported through the breachway into the pond where it settles and creates expanding shoals. In contrast to the other ponds, however, much of ‚ÄúQuonnie‚Äôs‚Äù western barrier beach remains in a protected, undeveloped state even though it is privately owned. The town boundary between Westerly and Charlestown cuts through the middle of the pond. Water quality in past years has been very good because the pond is relatively deep, well flushed by the tides, and development has been limited. Quonnie is the least intensely developed of any of the ponds. Most of the development is residential and much of it is occupied only seasonally. Like all of the ponds, Quonnie is an important nursery for winter flounder, young striped bass, blue fish, and tautog. Bay scallops fluctuate in abundance from year to year, but in a good year, they are often found in this salt pond. In the past few years, development pressures have increased dramatically, even though the watershed area is relatively small and a large portion of it is wet, red maple swamps.

A station was first built there in 1890 to service to new Crocker Wheeler plant in the district. The stop was named in honor of Andr√©-Marie Amp√®re, a pioneer in electrodynamics and reconstructed as a new Renaissance Revival station in 1908. Ampere was the second stop on the branch west of Newark Broad Street Station until 1984, when the Roseville Avenue station was closed. In June of that year, the station, along with 42 others, was entered into the National Register of Historic Places. In 1986, after continuous deterioration, New Jersey Transit demolished the westbound shelter built in 1921. The agency discontinued rail service to Ampere on April 7, 1991. The entire station was demolished in 1995.  History   Delaware, Lackawanna and Western Railroad (1868 - 1960)  The Montclair Branch was chartered in 1852 as the Newark and Bloomfield Railroad, running through Bloomfield and nearby West Bloomfield (present-day Montclair). However, tracks were not constructed along the owned right-of-way until 1856; in June that year trains began running between Newark, Bloomfield and West Bloomfield. The railroad had a large deficit to start; the ticket agent at West Bloomfield was also the brakeman for the one-car train. On April 1, 1868, the Morris & Essex Railroad bought out the alignment of the Newark and Bloomfield Railroad. The Morris & Essex began running services on the line, which was renamed the Montclair Branch when West Bloomfield was renamed Montclair shortly after. The Delaware, Lackawanna and Western Railroad soon gained trackage rights, and by the turn of the 20th century, the railroad had begun constructing track depressions and raises to eliminate grade-level crossings on city streets. Before 1890, conductors and engineers on the Lackawanna were ordered to stop at the station only on request from the railroad. The first station at Ampere was constructed in 1890 on a request made by Crocker Wheeler, a local electrical machine industry in East Orange. The station itself was built as a one-story stone structure with a pyramid-shaped roof and eaves overhanging the rails. There was also sidings set to go into the Crocker Wheeler plant. In honor of Andr√©-Marie Amp√®re, the French founder of electrodynamics, the station was named Ampere. The station quickly received a lot of residential and commercial influx, with people developing the area at a high rate. In 1907 and 1908, the Lackawanna built a new structure at Ampere between Springdale and Fourth Avenues. This new station, costing the Lackawanna $44,000 (1907 USD) was a new brick Renaissance Revival structure containing a green terra cotta roof, large arched doorway and concrete pedestrian tunnel under the tracks. The new station was opened with a large ceremony, also joined by the French ambassador to the United States, Jules Jusserand. By 1912, trains heading to or from the Lackawanna's Hoboken Terminal (built in 1907) made more than sixty stops daily at the Ampere station. East Orange, continuing to develop after its 1899 inception, began building new luxury apartment buildings and large branches of New York City's department stores, becoming a major commerce stop. After the town originally did not want the Lackawanna to raise the tracks in their town, they sued the Lackawanna to prevent construction. In 1921, the city was forced by a judge to comply to the Lackawanna's project. Tracks through Ampere were raised twelve feet higher and a second story was added to the station depot. A platform canopy was added to the westbound side of the station along with a brick shelter. The station saw electric train service for the first time in 1930 when the Lackawanna in conjunction with Thomas Edison with overhead catenary wires. It is at this time, the 1940s and 1950s, that the station was in its prime, with the Montclair Branch thought to be the most used commuter rail line in the United States. During the times after World War II, East Orange saw a loss in industry and a lowering tax base. The Crocker Wheeler plant, was bought by the Carrier Corporation to manufacture refrigerators and air conditioners.  Erie Lackawanna Railroad and Conrail (1960 - 1980)  In 1960, the Erie Railroad and the Lackawanna, both facing financial problems, announced a merger of the railroads on October 17 of that year, forming the Erie- Lackawanna Railroad. That was absorbed in April 1976, when the Erie-Lackawanna merged as part of the new federal Consolidated Rail Corporation (Conrail).  New Jersey DOT and New Jersey Transit (1980 - 1995)  A view of the platform at the deteriorating Ampere depot Commuter rail operations under Conrail was short-lived, turned over to the New Jersey Department of Transportation for service in 1980. It is at this point, the DOT (and the newly formed New Jersey Transit) shut down the inside waiting room of the deteriorating station depot. On June 22, 1984, as part of a thematic nomination, Ampere station was added to the National Register of Historic Places. However, the station's interior continued to fall into disrepair. The westbound shelter added in 1921 was demolished in 1986. The next year, New Jersey Transit petitioned the Commissioner for Natural and Historic Resources to demolish the station. The commissioner directed New Jersey Transit to first stabilize the station and either sell it to East Orange or advertise the station for lease or sale to a private developer. By 1990, the station served just 51 people boarding twenty- eight trains daily. Service was suspended at Ampere and the nearby Grove Street station on April 7, 1991, ostensibly until ridership forecasts increased substantially. The next year, the station suffered a large fire. After being unable to find a new use for the structure, New Jersey Transit demolished the station in 1995.  Proposed reconstruction of Ampere  The Ampere station site in April 2015 with the abandoned platforms In 2005, the city of East Orange began looking into the idea of rebuilding and reopening a new station at Ampere. The station site remains, with its asphalt platforms and eastbound driveway left in place. The station's stairs were all removed, and the landing to one entrance has catenary wires running on it. A study conducted in 2005 envisioned the station would attract commuters who would not go to Brick Church station, the main one in East Orange. The study also suggested applying for funds from the Department of Transportation's transit village program. Because the station remains on the National Register of Historic Places, construction plans would need to be approved by the United States Secretary of the Interior. A new structure would need to meet the Americans with Disabilities Act of 1990 form, with high-level platforms ( off the ground and long), new canopies, ramps and stairs. The new station will also have an average of thirty-second dwell time at the station, resulting in a minute and twenty seconds added to the commute time. Due to the level of usage, no more than a three-sided brick shelter, similar to those at Montclair Heights or Lake Hopatcong stations would be needed.

The hills consists of several hundred small flows and cones. Volcanism in the area started about 1.4 million years ago in the northern parts of the hills, and over time the volcanism propagated towards the southeast. These volcanoes are still considered active, since their last two eruptions (Shaitani and Chainu) occurred in 1856.

He was a member of Peter's close-knit group of friends who organized themselves into the Jolly Company and The All-Joking, All-Drunken Synod of Fools and Jesters. Life Vinius was the son of a Dutch merchant Andries Winius,http://research.frick.org/montias/browserecord.php?-action=browse&-recid=1670 who in 1627 associated with Isaac Massa and went to Moscovia as a grain trader. In 1628 he married Geertruid van Rijn.City Archives Amsterdam In 1632, during the time of Michael of Russia, he settled in Russia to found a water- powered ironworks in Tula, Russia, and in Serpukhov. Then he seems to have forced his wife to become either Greek Orthodox,Moderniser of Russia: Andrei Vinius, 1641-1716 By Kees Boterbloem or Russian Orthodox. Their son Andrew was raised to speak, besides Dutch, also Russian and German;Marion Peeters, p. 103. he knew French, Polish and Latin too, which he later taught to Peter the Great. Around 1664 Vinius married an aristocratic Russian woman. He became the translator of his second cousin Nicolaas Witsen in 1665, visiting the country in the company of Jacob Boreel. Witsen became his life long friend with their common interesting in cartography. Vinius, who lived in the German Suburb with the most of the other foreigners of Moscow, served in the Ministry of Foreign Affairs. Between 1672 and 1674 he travelled as a diplomat to London, Paris and Madrid. He then headed, together with his brother, to the Post Office, becoming the first Russian Postmaster in 1675. So he was able to secretly send maps and all kinds of antique objects to Witsen. Vinius taught the young Tsarevich Peter Dutch (and Latin?). He often corresponded with Peter, on matters ranging from war games and military strategy to their drunken parties as part of the Drunken Synod. Vinius was also the one who, after the Azov campaigns, arranged the parade into Moscow under a pagan arch that bewildered many Muscovites. During the Great Northern War, after the Battle of Narva, Russian artillery was reduced to almost nothing. Peter appointed Vinius to the post of Inspector of Artillery and ordered him to produce more cannons. Upon the Tsar's order and against the wishes of many Russians, Vinius melted down many of the church bells of Russia and even ordered beating-by-knout of the iron founders who were working too slowly. By melting a quarter of the church bells in Russia, eight months after the end of the Battle of Narva Vinius managed to produce hundreds of cannons to send to the Russian army. Despite his old age, on Peter's command, he also went into Siberia to look for potential new mines, and ended up establishing several ironworks beyond the Ural Mountains. In 1700 and in 1706 he came to the Dutch Republic. Vinius had lost all of his land and goods, because of a conflict with Alexander Danilovich Menshikov. Vinius tried to connect the Greek- or Russian Orthodox and Dutch Reformed church. In 1709 Vinius was back in Moscow and received back his property. In 1712 his house burned down; his wife died in the fire. References Bibliography   * Marion Peters, De wijze koopman.

Then, a week later, Barker and Hudson pulled off the unprecedented feat of destroying five kite balloons on a single sortie. By 26 May 1918, Hudson's win total reached seven balloons and six airplanes; besides the mass victories over balloons with Barker, Hudson had destroyed four airplanes and driven two down out of control. He was posted briefly, without success, to 45 Squadron. Postwar, Hudson returned to Canada to work in pulp mills making paper. Honours and awards *16 September 1918 ‚Äì T./Lt.

He then joined the Royal Naval Air Service, and was posted to 4N Squadron as a Sopwith Camel pilot on 15 June 1917. Less than a month later, on 10 July, he shared his first aerial victory with Flight Commander Arnold Jacques Chadwick, as they set a German Albatros D.V afire in midair for a win apiece. On 25 July, Keirstead, Chadwick, and James Enstone shared in the destruction of a seaplane east of Dixmude. On 18 August, Keirstead drove another Albatros D.V down out of control. On 24 September 1917, he drove a third Albatros down out of control, then immediately set afire another and killed its pilot from Jasta 28. Oberleutnant Jahn's death made Keirstead an ace and garnered him a DSC. Keirstead would win three more times in 1917, ending the year with an out of control win on 6 December. His DSC would be gazetted on 22 February 1918. The big day of Flight Commander Keirstead's career as an ace came on the afternoon of 21 March, when he drove down a Pfalz D.III fighter, destroyed another, and teamed with a Belgian Spad to destroy yet another Pfalz. He would score two more single victories after his squadron was redesignated 204 Squadron RAF, rounding off his tally on 12 June 1918. In summary, Keirstead was credited with destroying six enemy airplanes, including three shared wins; driving six more down out of control; and sharing in the capture of a Rumpler.

Manuel switched to the Royal Naval Air Service in March 1917. After training, he spent a short period in 12 Naval Squadron. On 12 August 1917, he was posted to 10 Naval Squadron as a Sopwith Camel pilot. Nine days later, he drove a German Albatros D.V down out of control, and destroyed another five minutes later. A month later, on 21 September, Manuel destroyed a German reconnaissance two-seater. Another D.V fell under his guns on 15 November 1917. He then received the Distinguished Service Cross on 19 December to close out his year. Manuel scored his fifth victory on 18 February, destroying another D.V to become an ace. He drove another down out of control the next day. He would continue to score until his final two wins on 9 June 1918. Not even a hand wound caused by an exploding Very pistol during a patrol on 9 May 1918 seemed to phase him, as he quickly returned from hospital to fly combat.

Titanoceras grew to be fairly large, with a tightly spiraled shell that reached a diameter of about 8 in (20 cm +) with about three volutions. The inner coils are partially enveloped by the next outer, resulting in a channel or impression along the inner rim, the dorsum. Otherwise all whorls are visible. (The descriptive term is evolute). Whorls have a somewhat rectangular cross section that is wider than high; in contrast with the otherwise similar and contemporary Domatoceras. The venter, which forms the outer rim, may be broadly arched. Septa are close spaced making chambers broad but short. Sutures have shallow lobes along the sides and across the venter and short saddles in between, along the ventro-lateral shoulders, but go straight across the dorsum. Titanoceras is found is limestone, indicating it lived in shallow- water carbonate banks. It could no doubt swim, but probably was not an active swimmer unlike fish and squid. It most likely spent its time crawling over or just above the sea floor. Titanoceras probably preyed upon crustaceans, bottom fish, and perhaps other cephalopods. Titanoceras is placed in the Grypoceratidae, a family of similar genera within the Nautilida. Nautilid families that are more similar and have a common ancestor are combined in superfamilies. The Grypoceratidae are part of the Trigonocerataceae.

Most tornadoes form in the U.S., although some events may take place internationally, particularly in parts of neighboring southern Canada during the summer season. Synopsis The 2000 tornado season as a whole was slightly below normal to near average. There were 1,075 tornadoes confirmed in the United States. January was inactive with just 16 tornado reports. Activity in February was high, with several strong tornadoes throughout the South. March was also quite active, with a notable tornado in Fort Worth, Texas taking place at the end of the month. The spring months saw normal activity, with substantial outbreaks in both April and May. Most of June was marked by below normal activity, with 135 tornadoes confirmed. The end of June and all of July had tornado reports nearly every day, resulting in an active early summer period. This activity continued into the beginning of August, but the latter part of the month saw few tornadoes, as well as the start of September. The rest of September was slightly more active. The fall months had normal activity; however, a pattern shift at the end of November caused December as a whole to be inactive, even though the F4 storm in Tuscaloosa, Alabama was the second-deadliest December tornado since 1950. Events January There were 16 tornadoes confirmed in the U.S. in January. February There were 56 tornadoes confirmed in the U.S. in February. February 13‚Äì14 Damage in Camilla, Georgia from an F3 tornado A storm system spawned strong tornadoes across the Southeast on February 13, killing 19 people and injuring 175, making it the deadliest outbreak in the year. All the deaths occurred in Southwestern Georgia. The most notable tornado was an F3 storm that caused 11 fatalities in the city of Camilla. Several other states, such as Alabama, Arkansas, Florida, and Tennessee were affected on the 13th, and a few weak tornadoes struck the Carolinas on the 14th. March There were 102 tornadoes confirmed in the U.S. in March. March 28 A low-end F3 tornado struck the city of Fort Worth, Texas on March 28 killing two people and injuring 80. The storm took a 4-mile path through the city, damaging skyscrapers and other high-rise buildings. In addition to this tornado, a small outbreak of tornadoes produced another F3 storm which traveled one mile through Arlington, Texas caused $500 million in damage and left about 80 people homeless. April There were 135 tornadoes confirmed in the U.S. in April. April 3 A storm system spawned 29 tornadoes from Texas to South Carolina on April 3, mainly F0 and F1 storms. One of the strongest tornadoes, an F2, killed one person in Piedmont, Alabama. April 23 An outbreak of tornadoes on April 23, Easter Sunday, produced 33 tornadoes across Oklahoma, Texas, Arkansas, and Louisiana, with three of these being rated F3. An F1 tornado moved through Shreveport, Louisiana, injuring six people. May There were 241 tornadoes confirmed in the U.S. in May. May 11‚Äì12 On May 11, an F3 tornado killed one person near Cedar Falls, Iowa. On May 12, another F3 storm caused two fatalities in Laguna Park, Texas. May 17‚Äì18 A storm system produced 69 tornadoes from May 17 to May 18, which occurred from Colorado to New York. Most were rated F0, but one powerful F3 storm near Brady, Nebraska injured two people.https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H-tgDx_amc8 June There were 135 tornadoes confirmed in the U.S. in June. July There were 148 tornadoes confirmed in the U.S. in July. July 14 (Canada) A severe thunderstorm over the Rockies tracked eastward across the province during the early evening on July 14. At 7:00 MDT, an F3 tornado touched down and moved toward Green Acres Campground at Pine Lake, Alberta. 12 people at the campground were killed and over 100 were injured. Winds up to caused $15.2 million (2000 Canadian dollars) in damage to the campground. Overall, it ranks as the fourth-deadliest tornado in Canadian history. July 25 A moderate outbreak of 14 tornadoes took place across Minnesota. 12 of these were rated F0; however, a violent F4 storm hit the city of Granite Falls, which killed one and injured 15. Millions of dollars in damage occurred across the city's residential areas. This tornado is ranked as one of the strongest in Minnesota's history. August There were 52 tornadoes confirmed in the U.S. in August. September There were 47 tornadoes confirmed in the U.S. in September. September 20 Four tornadoes touched down across Ohio. The most notable storm was an F4 tornado that moved through Xenia. One person was killed and 100 were injured along its 21-mile path, which paralleled the path of the famous tornado in 1974. It was that tornado which prompted local officials to install 10 tornado sirens across Greene County, Ohio, which failed to function during the tornado, due to power outages and no battery backup system. In the end, 48 homes were destroyed and 125 were damaged by the tornado. October There were 64 tornadoes confirmed in the U.S. in October. November There were 50 tornadoes confirmed in the U.S. in November. December There were 26 tornadoes confirmed in the U.S. in December. December 16 After a lull in activity, a storm system produced a moderate outbreak of tornadoes on December 16, the strongest which killed 11 and injured 125 in Tuscaloosa, Alabama and was rated F4. The tornado moved through portions of Southeastern Tuscaloosa destroying 110 homes and causing $12 million in damages (2000 US dollars). This tornado is tied as the second- deadliest December tornado since 1950, only behind the F5 in Vicksburg, Mississippi on December 5, 1953. In the end, the entire outbreak of 24 tornadoes was responsible for 12 fatalities and $35 million in damage across seven states.

Gameplay In this screenshot, a Silicon force is attacking a White Sharks settlement. Submarine Titans is a real-time strategy video game that takes place in the year 2115 after a comet has struck Earth, driving two human factions, the militant White Sharks and the scientific Black Octopi, to establish underwater bases and fight for dominance over the oceans. The comet also brought a mysterious alien race known as the Silicons, who compete with the two human factions to collect resources and build a gate that would take them back to their homeworld. Each faction has its own ten-mission campaign, and the player can play the three campaigns in any order. With the exception of their technology trees, the human factions share many similarities and are functionally identical. However, the Silicons use a different resource model. The White Sharks and Black Octopi require a supply of oxygen to power all their structures and must harvest metal and a special element called Corium to build submarines and facilities, while the Silicons must extract silicon from the sea floor to produce their basic resource and use metal to generate energy and power their regeneration ability. Nevertheless, they harvest Corium in the same way as the human factions do. Because the game takes place underwater, units can be moved up or down in relation to the sea floor, in addition to their movement in a two-dimensional direction. The terrain of the map, which can have hills, mountains and land bridges, affect how a base can be constructed and the movement of the player's units. The game includes a level editor, allowing players to create their own maps. It is also the first real-time strategy game to feature a spectator mode, which allows players to watch multiplayer matches without intervening in the gameplay. Development Submarine Titans was developed by Ellipse Studios, an Australian video game company based in Adelaide and formerly known as Megamedia Australia. The development team was composed of 16 people and included seven programmers, four artists, a sound engineer, as well as people who focused on areas such as background and mission development. The game was conceived by one of the game's artists, who was interested in futuristic stories. Although the development team was experienced and had previously worked on video games, the company struggled to find a publisher in Australia, where the video game industry was not a popular market at the time. The engine, which was specifically developed for the game, is capable of rendering 3D landscapes and generating objects as pre-rendered 3D sprites without hardware acceleration. The game was released to manufacturing on June 22, 2000. It was published by Strategy First in North America. Reception Submarine Titans received mixed reviews from critics. Greg Kasavin from GameSpot criticized the game for having too steep of a learning curve. He also criticizes the game for having unclear voices and text, even though he notes that the story is detailed according to the manual but the game is very strategical and is very interesting to play. GameSpy editor Tim McConnaughy has mostly praised the game, citing very good premise and delivery, rich configuration options and a clean interface. He noted simple combat and some AI problems and bugs as negatives.

History  Midstate College's origins date back to 1857, when a commercial school was started in Peoria. In 1865, a similar school opened, and the two schools combined in 1868. In 1888, the merged school was bought by George W. Brown, principal of Jacksonville Business College, and named Brown's Business College of Commerce. In 1902, a new building was completed at 240 South (now Southwest) Jefferson Street, on the corner of Jefferson and Harrison Streets downtown, and Brown's Business College moved into the second and third floors. Over time, Mr. Brown increased his properties to 20 institutions, including Cairo, Decatur, Jacksonville and Rockford in Illinois; Davenport and Muscatine, Iowa; and St. Louis, Missouri. Mr. Brown continued ownership of the Peoria school until 1913, then sold it to a Mr. Reed. Reed sold the school in 1960 to A.R. Beard, Don Beard, and Arline H. Bunch, who renamed the school Midstate College of Commerce. In 1965, the Bunch family purchased the stock, and renamed the school to simply Midstate College in 1970. R. Dale Bunch became president around 1965. In October 1997, Midstate moved from its 95-year-old downtown location to 411 West Northmoor Road, near the corner of Northmoor Road and Knoxville Avenue (Illinois Route 40). The downtown building was bought by a developer, was renovated, and became known as the Prairie Building in 1998. Requires JavaScript. In November 1999, Midstate was approved as a four-year institution and began offering a Bachelor of Business Administration degree; other bachelor's degrees have been added since. The Arline H. Bunch Business Center opened in January 2002. Bunch's daughter, Meredith N. Bunch, became college president in November 2010; R. Dale Bunch remained chairman of the board. In 2018, Midstate College announced an upcoming Master of Business Administration program. In July 2019, Meredith Bunch announced that Midstate would close at the end of the 2019 summer semester and put the campus up for sale, after the college went through declining enrollment and a potential partnership with another educational institution fell through, leaving the college with a lack of funding.

Hillcrest is bounded by the side streets of Lord Howe Avenue, Oxford Street and Bristol Terrace to the north, Blacks Road to the east, North East Road to the South and Fosters Road to the west. Its housing stock has undergone a radical transformation in recent years from being predominately weatherboard dwellings on traditional large blocks, with a large percentage of Housing SA owned dwellings, to one containing almost as many smaller houses since a concerted effort to update the housing stock began in 1993 by the Government of South Australia. There is ongoing urban infill occurring in Hillcrest. The North East Road section of the suburb is almost completely commercial in nature, noted for its large number of motor vehicle dealerships, and is also home to North Adelaide Basketball Club at Hillcrest Stadium and the North East Community Assistance Project which is housed in the heritage listed former Gilles Plains Primary School building. The suburb is also home to the Aveo Crestview Retirement Village on the former Anchor Foods (not to be confused with the unrelated New Zealand dairy product manufacturer) factory site on Fosters Road which was opened in 1993 when Anchor Foods consolidated their production in Perth, Western Australia. Its other buildings of note include the Oakden Medical Centre and the Hillcrest Community Centre, which has been operated by the City of Port Adelaide Enfield since 1995, adjacent to the Hillcrest Primary School with whom it originally was a shared project.

Heitjans, J. Karger, Ed, ‚ÄúDiffusion in condensed matter: Methods, Materials, Models,‚Äù 2nd edition, Birkhauser, 2005, pp. 1-965. Diffusion along both the grain boundary and in the lattice may be modeled with an Arrhenius equation. The ratio of the grain boundary diffusion activation energy over the lattice diffusion activation energy is usually 0.4‚Äì0.6, so as temperature is lowered, the grain boundary diffusion component increases. Increasing temperature often allows for increased grain size, and the lattice diffusion component increases with increasing temperature, so often at 0.8Tmelt (of an alloy), the grain boundary component can be neglected.

As a student, he joined the Polish Social Democratic Party of Galicia; he supported the Polish Socialist Party ‚Äì Left faction over the Polish Socialist Party ‚Äì Revolutionary Faction led by J√≥zef Pi≈Çsudski. Before World War I he joined the pro- independence paramilitary Polish organization, the Union of Armed Struggle. With the outbreak of World War I, he was conscripted into the Austro-Hungarian Army in 1914, and was badly wounded in 1917. During his convalescence in Vienna, he became a member of a secret Polish organization, the Polish Military Organisation. As a member of PMO he encouraged Polish soldiers to desert from the Austrian Army and join newly created Polish formations. This resulted in a threat of court martial from the Austro-Hungarian Army, but eventually he was freed. Next, he participated in the battle of Lw√≥w during the Polish‚ÄìUkrainian War. In interwar Poland, Pr√≥chnik became an activist of the Polish Socialist Party and supported initiatives designed to improve the situation of the country's working class. He supported the inclusion of Silesia into renascent Poland. In the 1928 legislative elections, he was elected a deputy to the Polish Sejm. He steadily drifted to more extreme left position, supporting cooperation with the communists. Often - under pen-name Henryk Swoboda and publishing mostly in Robotnik - published essays attacking the right-wing sanacja Polish government and the endecja faction, which he blamed for undermining the nascent Polish democracy. This resulted in some of his publications being censored by the state. Some of his works would appear in unabridged version only after his death, published in the People's Republic of Poland. He worked as an archivist in Piotrk√≥w and Pozna≈Ñ. For a time he was employed by Poland's Ministry of Culture and Religion. His attempt to enter the academic life ended when his application for a position in the University of Warsaw was rejected, due to his left wing views being unpopular among the right wing faculty there (despite a support from his candidature from professor Wac≈Çaw Tokarz. He nonetheless became a member of the Polish Historical Society, published in historical journals and attended professional conferences. During World War II, in occupied Poland, Pr√≥chnik continued his political activities, supporting a PPS-affiliated underground printing press (Barykada Wolno≈õci). He joined the leftist PPS group, Polish Socialists (Polscy Socjali≈õci), but he tried to reconcile the divisions within PPS and took part in the negotiations with the more centrist PPS-WRN. He was involved in the collaborative underground effort to document Nazi crimes in Poland, worked in the underground Military History Bureau and contributed to the Kronika Okupacji project. He advocated cooperation with the Soviet Union. He became a member of the Political Consultative Committee. On 22 May 1942 he died of a heart attack. Tributes Pr√≥chnik's Warsaw grave Several landmarks and organizations in Poland bear Pr√≥chnik's name. Works In his historical works, Pr√≥chnik was a strong adherent to Marxist views, and supported the dialectic materialism perspective. He was interested in studying the revolutionary processes, including social movements. He published numerous articles, both in academic journals and popular press, as well as several books.

Plot Ace flyer \\"Tailspin\\" Tommy Tomkins (John Trent) starts a model flying club for young boys, to learn about aviation. When Mr. Brown (Joseph E. Bernard) receives a large payroll by aircraft, then by car, gangster Mike Lewis (Dennis Moore) and two gang members try to hold him up. Tommy agrees to carry the next payroll by small aircraft and then helps Mike's little brother Whitey (Tommy Baker), a tough orphan, get a model aircraft and join the model club. On the night of a bad rain storm, Flight 14 (the payroll flight) is due to arrive with Brown's payroll, but an accident at a dam has Tommy flying to drop medical supplies. Tommy tries to land, but with zero visibility, he overshoots the field and crashes. While search parties look for Tommy east of the airfield, Whitey is sure he knows where Tommy crashed and sends the boys out to search. After Whitey finds Tommy's wrecked aircraft, he sends his model aircraft up into the sky. Tommy's friends, Skeeter (Milburn Stone) and Betty Lou (Marjorie Reynolds), see Whitey's model aircraft and rescue Tommy. Headlines praise Whitey's heroism and Mike introduces him to gang boss Dawson (Julius Tannen), a toy manufacturer who proposes a \\"Whitey Lewis\\" aircraft that features a secret code. Tommy helps Whitey invent a model aircraft to be used during emergencies that can sky-write using smoke signals. When Flight 14 finally arrives with the payroll, Tommy takes it on his plane with him. The gangsters pretend to have a car accident and Whitey, worried his brother is hurt, sends a smoke signal to Tommy, who lands and is held up. At first, Tommy believes Whitey is with the gangsters but then they are both taken hostage. In the basement of Dawson's cabin hideout, Tommy and Whitey repair Whitey's miniature model and send a smoke signal, spotted by a pilot overhead. The police find Whitey's model and search for the hideout, but Tommy sends Whitey upstairs to escape. Whitey is caught, and when Dawson hurts his brother, he slugs Dawson, who shoots him. The gang escapes by car but drives over a cliff. Tommy helps Whitey out of the cabin and later, Mr. Brown gives Whitey a scout uniform. The head of Whitey's school makes plans for an air scout troop that will soon become a national organization led by Tailspin Tommy.

Throughout his career he maintained important relations with the Kingdom of Navarre, which his lands and lordships bordered. There were at least three persons named \\"Nu√±o √Ålvarez\\" in mid eleventh-century Castile.Reilly, 38. Peterson, 11, counts 86 mentions of that name in documents between 1028 and 1065, with 52 of these coming between 1033 and 1054. Eighteen documents are signed by more than one Nu√±o √Ålvarez, usually clearly distinguished by the use of alio (\\"other\\") to qualify one of them. Nu√±o √Ålvarez de Carazo appears in sixteen documents between 1033 and 1054 with the honorific ' or 'This honorific appears only in the most formal class of documents in mid-eleventh-century Spain, cf. Peterson, 12 n10. and two with the territorial appellation de Carazo. He was the eldest of his brothers and may have been the maternal great uncle of Rodrigo D√≠az de Vivar, his brother Rodrigo being the father of Rodrigo D√≠az's mother.According to Peterson, 12 n9, his brothers were, in descending order of age: Fort√∫n (died c. 1054), Diego (who was the tenant of Oca as late as 1086), Rodrigo (died c. 1082), and Gonzalo (fl. 1032‚Äì75). He also had at least one sister named Mumadona (married to Salvador Gonz√°lez). Chaytor, 36, has Nu√±o constantly at the court of Ferdinand and his son Sancho II, but Reilly, 38, knows of no charter of Sancho II's signed by a Nu√±o √Ålvarez. Since Nu√±o's brother Diego and sister Mumadona held land at Carazo and Lara de los Infantes, it seems likely that Nu√±o's lordship in this region was based on familial estates and patrimonial lands. Carazo is not particularly near the border with Navarre, but it is probable that the land between them was sparsely populated. The lowlands near where the river Arlanza entered the Arlanz√≥n were probably part of his lordship, and Nu√±o possessed properties in Pe√±alba and Vilviestre del Pinar halfway between Carazo and Navarre.For arguments concerning Nu√±o's landholdings, cf. Peterson, 13‚Äì14. Nu√±o's importance in the frontier region southeast of Burgos is apparent in the archives of the monasteries of San Pedro de Arlanza and San Pedro de Carde√±a.Peterson, 13 and n15, counts twenty appearances in twenty-six documents between the years 1037 and 1054 for Nu√±o at Arlanza, and fourteen out of a possible fifty-two at Carde√±a. Nu√±o also had properties in La Bureba, including at Ibeas de Juarros and perhaps at Oca.The references to these properties date from 1028 to 1031 and are found in the archives of San Mill√°n de la Cogolla. The obscure reference to ribulo de Auca may not refer to Oca. Cf. Peterson, 15 and n18. In 1016 Sancho III of Navarre and Sancho Garc√≠a of Castile established by agreement the border between their respective realms. Sometime later, probably between 1030 and 1035,The final five years of Sancho III's reign seem most likely, considering his extensive involvement in Castile at that moment (cf. Peterson, 25), and Nu√±o's appearance in his charters relating to La Bureba at about this time. Nu√±o √Ålvarez and his neighbour across the border in Navarre, Fort√∫n Ochoiz, re-confirmed the division and the frontier. This act, confirming only the border as it passed through the Sierra de la Demanda, is preserved in a short notice in a document from the Becerro Galicano, a cartulary of the monastery of San Mill√°n de la Cogolla.According to Mart√≠nez D√≠ez (1998), 42, the document is authentic. It is presented here in original Latin with English translation. While in this document Nu√±o bears the honorific duenno, in the few other documents of San Mill√°n in which he appears he carries the typical Navarrese honorific senior. It is the only record of the division of 1016, only the surveying for which was perhaps undertaken, the hypothetical treaty never being drawn up or confirmed. It is also possible that Nu√±o and Fort√∫n confirmed the old frontier in an act of rebellion, without authority from their respective lords.The possibility is raised by Peterson, 25. In this case, the lords would have been Garc√≠a S√°nchez III and Ferdinand I, who were often at odds. Nu√±o had other relations with Navarre after La Bureba, which was part of Castella Vetula (Old Castile), was allotted to Navarre on the division of Sancho III's realm (1035). Four times Nu√±o visited the court of Garc√≠a S√°nchez III of Navarre when it visited O√±a, the capital of Castella Vetula and the place of Sancho III's burial. The Navarrese scribes referred to him and the other visiting Castilians the phrase isti sunt castellani (\\"these are Castilians\\") and relegated them to the bottom of witness lists.Peterson, 14. This can be explained by his allegiance to Ferdinand I of Castile, who was often at odds with his brother Garc√≠a. Nu√±o probably died fighting alongside his king against the king of Navarre at the Battle of Atapuerca in 1054, where his brother Fort√∫n probably also died.Peterson, 12.

The generic name means \\"Broadened rostrum crocodile\\", with \\"Musturzabal\\" meaning \\"broadened rostrum\\" in Basque and \\"suchus\\" meaning \\"crocodile\\" in Greek. The type and only species is M. buffetauti, named after the French paleoherpetologist Eric Buffetaut. The material first assigned to Musturzabalsuchus in 1997 has been found from the locality of La√±o in Condado de Trevi√±o, northern Spain. Although dating back to the Late Cretaceous, the exact age of the strata in which material of Musturzabalsuchus occurs in the locality is not known: it is either Late Campanian or very Early Maastrichtian. Despite the unusually high quantity of remains belonging to the genus (most other continental Late Cretaceous crocodilian genera from Europe are poorly represented), the only skeletal elements known from Musturzabalsuchus are the maxilla and mandible. Some fragments of these bones have been found from the locality of Armu√±a in the province of Segovia that were previously referred to an unnamed trematochampsid. Like the holotype and paratype material found from La√±o, these fossils, known collectively as UPUAM-502, are Campano-Maastrichtian in age. Another specimen (MHNM 10834.0) from the Fuvelian Lignites of France has been referred to Musturzabalsuchus in 1999. However, the characteristics used to assign the material to better-known specimens of Musturzabalsuchus from Spain were questioned in a later study. Material from Musturzabalsuchus has been found more recently from Valencia, Spain, being slightly older in age than specimens from other localities, dating back to the Early or Middle Campanian. Phylogenetics Illustration of the remains of \\"Crocodilus\\" (Massaliasuchus) affuvelensis from the Fuvelian Lignites, 1869. Mandible resembling Musturzabalsuchus illustrated at top. Musturzabalsuchus was assigned to Alligatoroidea on the basis of several characters, including a lateral displacement of the foramen aereum of the articular. Additionally, the enlarged fourth mandibular tooth occludes into a pit in the rostrum. Only the latter feature is present in the more derived alligatorids, and thus it is excluded from the family. The pit that the fourth mandibular occludes into is placed posterior to the last premaxillary tooth, similar to what is seen in \\"Diplocynodon\\" hantoniensis, another early alligatoroid. A figure used in an 1869 study by P. Matheron of crocodylian remains from the Fuveau lignites (illustration) pictured a mandible similar in profile to that of Musturzabalsuchus, but was labeled as belonging to the crocodylian Crocodilus affuvelensis. In 1997 it was suggested that due to this apparent similarity, along with the vagueness of descriptions in the 1869 paper and the loss of the syntype, that C. affuvelensis could be reassigned to Musturzabalsuchus, although it was also acknowledged that the lack of posterior cranial material in the genus made detailed comparisons difficult. A recent 2008 study on Matheron's specimens concluded that they belonged to a new genus distinct from Crocodylus and different from Musturzabalsuchus, named Massaliasuchus. A recent phylogenetic analysis recovered Musturzabalsuchus as a member of Allodaposuchidae, outside Alligatoroidea. Paleobiogeography Musturzabalsuchus and Acynodon, a contemporary crocodilian also common from La√±o, are thought to have been closely related to Paleolaurasian alligatoroids. The later genus is the only taxon not known from North America to be related to the more derived Late Cretaceous tribodont alligatorids. It is clear that Musturzabalsuchus was endemic to Europe, and was most likely restricted to Ibero-Armorica Island,Ibero-Armorica consisted of what is now the Iberian Peninsula and southern France as the genus is absent from Northern and Eastern European localities from which other alligatoroid fossils have been found.

It is a brick Carnegie library built in 1903 in the Classical Revival architectural style. It served continuously as the city's library until 1974, when it was closed after a newer library was built in the city's Stockade District. Since then it has been the property of the Kingston City School District, which has used it as the offices for the janitorial department at neighboring Kingston High School. In 1995 it was listed on the National Register of Historic Places. Starting in 2009, the library was renovated into an arts and technology center. On September 12, 2011, it was officially reopened as the Carnegie Learning Center used by Kingston High School and the community. Building The library building sits on a lot on the south side of Broadway, slightly raised from street level. Kingston Hospital is across the street, as is City Hall. Just to the east is Kingston High School. It is a one-and-a-half-story rectangular building of brown brick on a rough-cut bluestone foundation. A limestone pedimented entry portal is located in the middle of the front. It is heavily decorated with classical motifs. Two ionic columns frame the recessed entrance. On the pediment itself is a book-and-flower frieze. Limestone bands also go around the building at both the lower end of the brick and the top level of the fenestration. Both interior floors are . The lower floor has what was once a lecture hall with raised dais, two study rooms, two bathrooms and a boiler room. A staircase with a Craftsman-style bannister leads up to the main floor, where there are remnants of a cast iron mezzanine for book stacks. Leaded pane glass partitions divide the rooms. Two fireplace surrounds remain at either end. History Kingston established its first public library in 1899, a quarter-century after it had been formed from a merger of the previous villages of Kingston and Rondout. It was housed in a room in City Hall, but within three years of the library's establishment it had already outgrown it. In 1902 the library's trustees wrote to Andrew Carnegie, who had funded libraries all over the world, to see if he would consider providing them with the money to build a freestanding library. His secretary wrote back. If the city of Kingston would commit itself to spending $3,000 a year ($ in contemporary dollars) to maintain the library, Carnegie would donate $30,000 ($740,000 in contemporary dollars) to build it. City Council accepted the offer and passed an ordinance establishing the required level of funding and accepting Carnegie's gift. Local steamboat magnate Samuel Coykendall donated the land, provided the trustees raise money for its purchase through subscription. Ground was broken in 1903 and the new building was opened the next year. It remained the city's library until 1974, when more space was needed and the current library on Franklin Street was built. After the library moved out, it became property of the school district. The interior was heavily modified to serve as classroom space, but that proved unworkable. It was used as the offices of the high school's custodial services until renovations. During that time the building was neglected, and the front entrance was fenced off from the sidewalk. In 2009 school district voters approved a $3.6 million proposal to rehabilitate the library building into an arts and technology center. The building is now open to the Kingston City School District.

Its focus is to bring together patrons of Parkour and Freerunning and aims to bring the sport and philosophy to the mainstream audience. History The World Freerunning Parkour Federation (WFPF) was founded in January 2007 as a partnership between Ruff Magic Entertainment, a New Jersey limited liability company, and eight Parkour and Freerunning athletes. The athletes, Daniel Ilabaca, Ryan Doyle, Tim Shieff, Oleg Vorslav, Victor Lopez, Gabriel Nunez, Paul Darnell and Richard King, and the company principals, Victor Bevine, David Thompson and production partner Francis Lyons came together with the stated purpose of bringing the sport of Parkour to mainstream American audiences through television and other media and live formats. Other member athletes of the WFPF include Brian Orosco, Miguel Southee Jr., King David, Michael Turner and Daniel Arroyo from the U.S. Pip Andersen, Philip Doyle, Ben Jenkin from the UK, Marcus Gustafsson and Filip Ljungberg of Sweden, and Justin \\"Jet\\" Sheaffer from the U.S. MTV In 2009, the WFPF partnered with MTV to develop and produce MTV‚ÄôS ULTIMATE PARKOUR CHALLENGE, a one-hour competitive format special starring WFPF member athletes Daniel Ilabaca, Ryan Doyle, Tim Shieff, Pip Andersen, Brian Orosco, King David, Michael Turner and Daniel Arroyo. On May 6, 2010, the first of 6 episodes (the first 3 were broadcast live) of ULTIMATE PARKOUR CHALLENGE (or UPC) aired on MTV, with US athlete Brian Orosco replaced by the UK‚Äôs Ben Jenkin. Each week the competitors were put in a new environment to compete, with the first episode taking place on the historic Queen Mary Hotel, in Long Beach, California.. Other environments included Venice Beach, a Hollywood Western Town, a castle in the Hollywood Hills, a shopping mall and Downtown LA‚Äôs Pershing Square. The show garnered 3.5 million viewers in the 12-24 year old male demo and is still the most viewed Parkour event in history. Other projects The WFPF partnered with Athletes for Hope, a charitable organization founded by Tony Hawk, Lance Armstrong and Mia Hamm among others, to facilitate opportunities for athletes to serve as role models for underserved youth around the U.S. WFPF athletes have donated their services to events at the Harlem Children‚Äôs Zone as well as at the New York Fresh Air Fund. The WFPF website is designed for the parkour community and dedicated to its interests and concerns. The site combines parkour news, event promotion, parkour athlete interviews and highlighted bios and affiliate information and videos. The website includes a social-networking site similar to Facebook. The website currently has profiles posted from every U.S. state and over 60 countries worldwide. Part of the mission of the WFPF is to fill any voids in the parkour community and one example of this is their release of the KO parkour shoe. \\"KO\\" is the brand name for WFPF merchandise and is described by the WFPF as their motto saying \\"to Know Obstacles is to Know freedom.\\" The WFPF roots in charitable work have led to their approach being to focus on helping others overcome any obstacle in their path and the KO motto represents this focus. Using their sister site KnowObstacles.com the WFPF has proven true to their motto to provide for the parkour community as they developed a parkour shoe that many recognize as one of the best shoes out there made specifically for training parkour and free running. The most notable qualities are the lightweight feel, simple design and grip on the sole. Competition and Controversy In the weeks leading up to production of the MTV special, there was considerable controversy within the Parkour community both for and against the WFPF over its choice to support a competitive format television show and whether that violated the organization‚Äôs mission statement. In the main, judgment was deferred until the airing of the MTV show, due in large measure to the esteem in which the WFPF athletes are held in the worldwide Parkour community. WFPF management According to the WFPF website, the Ruff Magic principals, Victor Bevine and David Thompson have over thirty years combined experience working in youth development, having directed and developed arts and intervention programs for at-risk youth. Francis Lyons is the Emmy Award-winning executive producer of MTV‚Äôs hit series MADE, and is a partner at One Louder Productions. World Parkour Championship In 2018 WFPF launched the World Parkour Championship #WPC series holding their first event in Mardin, Turkey in June in partnership with Case Productions. Future WPC events are in the works around the world.  Results  * 2018 World Parkour Championship Mardin: MEN (SPEED) 1st. Erik Mukhametshin, 2nd. Joey Adrian, 3rd.

WFPF has held parkour instructor certifications in USA, Canada, Thailand, Scotland, Wales, England, Portugal. As of the Spring of 2019 over 1000 parkour instructors have been attended and been certified by WFPF. In 2016 WFPF certification was named the official Parkour certification for British Columbia Gymnastics in Canada. WFPF also offers online certifications for Parkour instructor assistants as well as Parkour Competition Judge certifications which are required to judge any WFPF competition. Many WFPF certifications are done in partnership and with the endorsement of IPTC- International Professional Training Certification which was established in 1978.

Statement of the theorem The statement of the result is that if 2\\\\le r are natural numbers and r divides k, then the complete hypergraph K^k_r decomposes into 1-factors. K^k_r is a hypergraph with k vertices, in which every subset of r vertices forms a hyperedge; a 1-factor of this hypergraph is a set of hyperedges that touches each vertex exactly once, or equivalently a partition of the vertices into subsets of size r. Thus, the theorem states that the k vertices of the hypergraph may be partitioned into subsets of r vertices in \\\\binom{k}{r}\\\\frac{r}{k} = \\\\binom{k-1}{r-1} different ways, in such a way that each r-element subset appears in exactly one of the partitions. The case r = 2 In the special case r = 2, we have a complete graph K_n on n vertices, and we wish to color the edges with \\\\binom{n}{2}\\\\frac{2}{n} = n-1 colors so that the edges of each color form a perfect matching. Baranyai's theorem says that we can do this whenever n is even. History The r = 2 case can be rephrased as stating that every complete graph with an even number of vertices has an edge coloring whose number of colors equals its degree, or equivalently that its edges may be partitioned into perfect matchings. It may be used to schedule round-robin tournaments, and its solution was already known in the 19th century. The case that k = 2r is also easy. The r = 3 case was established by R. Peltesohn in 1936. The general case was proved by Zsolt Baranyai in 1975. References *. *. *.

On August 1, 2016, Dr. Wolf von Laer became the Chief Executive Officer. History Origin Students participating in an Institute for Humane Studies Koch Summer Fellowship got together on July 24, 2007 to discuss successes and challenges faced by classical liberal student organizations. In 2008, Alexander McCobin and Sloane Frost decided to organize a conference for 40 students who were involved in libertarian student organizations. As more students contacted the planners to participate, more students joined the planning. The first Students for Liberty conference was held at Columbia University from February 22 to 24, 2008, with 100 students participants. The perceived success of the conference encouraged the planners to form Students for Liberty to provide continuing support to student groups.John Stossel \\"(I Didn't Know) I'm a Libertarian\\", , Stossel, March 31, 2011Jonathan Perri \\"Interview: Alexander McCobin of Students for Liberty\\", , HeadCount, January 14, 2011 In the news CPAC in Washington, DC SFL co- founder and former president Alexander McCobin opened his remarks on the February 19, 2010 panel \\"2 Minute Activist: Saving Freedom Across America\\" at the Conservative Political Action Conference (CPAC) by thanking the American Conservative Union for welcoming GOProud as a co-sponsor of the event.Gene Healy, \\"Don't trust anyone under 30?\\", , Washington Examiner, Washington, DC, March 2, 2010 Archived copy at the Library of Congress (November 25, 2010).

Formed in 1940 in Northern Ireland, they carried out a number of small-scale raids in Norway and France between 1941 and 1943 before being disbanded and its personnel dispersed to other commando units. Background The commandos were formed in 1940, by the order of Winston Churchill the British Prime Minister. He called for specially trained troops that would \\"develop a reign of terror down the enemy coast\\".Chappell 1996, p.5 At first they were a small force of volunteers who carried out small raids against enemy occupied territory,Chappell 1996, p.3 but by 1943 their role had changed into lightly equipped assault infantry which specialised in spearheading amphibious landings.Moreman 2006, p.8 The man initially selected as the overall commander of the force was Admiral Sir Roger Keyes himself a veteran of the landings at Galipoli and the Zeebrugge raid in the First World War.Chappell 1996, p.6 Keyes resigned in October 1941 and was replaced by Admiral Louis Mountbatten. By the autumn of 1940 more than 2,000 men had volunteered for commando training, and what became known as the Special Service Brigade was formed into 12 units called commandos.Haskew 2007, p.48 Each commando would number around 450 men commanded by a lieutenant colonel. They were sub divided into troops of 75 men and further divided into 15-man sections. Commandos were all volunteers seconded from other British Army regiments and retained their own cap badges and remained on their regimental roll for pay.Moreman 2006, p.12 All volunteers went through the six-week intensive commando course at Achnacarry. The course in the Scottish Highlands concentrated on fitness, speed marches, weapons training, map reading, climbing, small boat operations and demolitions both by day and by night.van der Bijl 2006, p.12 By 1943 the commandos had moved away from small raiding operations and had been formed into brigades of assault infantry to spearhead future Allied landing operations. Three units were left un-brigaded to carry out smaller-scale raids.Moreman 2006, pp.84‚Äì85 History Formation Formed on 5 August 1940 in Belfast and Derry in Northern Ireland, under the command of Lieutenant Colonel S. Harrison, the unit, although technically a part of the Special Service Brigade under Brigadier Joseph (Charles) Haydon,Chappell 1996, p. 15. largely remained independent of it and carried out small scale raiding and sabotage operations.Moreman 2006, p. 18. Training was conducted at various locations in Northern Ireland, including at Aldergrove Airport, where the commandos carried out a mock attack. In early 1941 they were billeted for a brief time at Warsash before undertaking combined operations training at Inverary, Scotland. Operations Compared with some of the other commando units, No. 12 Commando had a short history. Its first raid came on the night of 27/28 July 1941 when a party of 16 men carried out a landing near Ambleteuse, France. Embarking on an assault landing craft, they were towed to a position from the mouth of the Slack River by a Motor Launch. Although no prisoners were taken, the raid was partially successful and the commandos were ashore for approximately an hour before returning to their landing craft and heading back to Britain.Saunders 1959, p. 41. On 9 December 1941, a detachment from No. 12 Commando, along with a detachment from No. 6 Commando and some Norwegian soldiers, took part in Operation Kitbag, a raid on the town of Flor√∏ in Norway.Chappell 1996, p. 14. Embarking on , an infantry landing ship, they set out from Scapa Flow. During the voyage an incident occurred while some of the men were priming grenades for the raid which resulted in six men were killed and another 11 were seriously wounded,Saunders 1959, p. 42. nevertheless the decision was made to continue with the raid. In the end, however, due to navigational difficulties the operation was eventually called off when the naval commander was unable to locate the fjord upon which Floss was located. Later that month, on 26 December 1941, No. 12 Commando took part in Operation Anklet, which was the only raid it undertook during its history where the entire unit took part.Chappell 1996, p. 47. The operation was a diversionary raid on the Lofoten Islands in Norway, as part of the wider Operation Archery, which was a larger commando raid on V√•gs√∏y and M√•l√∏y. No. 12 Commando along with 68 Norwegians from Norwegian Independent Company 1 and a demolition party landed on the island capturing the German garrison who surrendered without a fight.Chappell 1996, p. 14. Under Harrison's command, they landed at Reine and after the garrison surrendered, the commandos stayed on the island for two days to carry out demolitions work, destroying two German wireless stations before withdrawing.Saunders 1959, p. 51. They took 29 German prisoners and over 200 volunteers for the free Norwegian forces in Britain with them. After this No. 12 Commando undertook a series of small scale operations, with half of the unit forming Northforce in Norway, while the other half carried out operations in France along with the Small Scale Raiding Force as part of Forfarforce.Saunders 1959, pp. 187‚Äì188. On 27/28 February 1942, a detachment took part in the Bruneval Raid, providing the recovery parties for the paratroops. Later other detachments took part in the St Nazaire RaidSaunders 1959, p. 70. and a raid on Sark known as Operation Basalt.Saunders 1959, p. 100. In total the commando played a part in at least 15 raids between 1941 and late 1943. Disbandment The decision was finally made to disband the unit in December 1943 as part of the re-organisation of the commandos into four brigades underneath the divisional-sized commando Group HQ and the subsequent conceptual change in emphasis from small-scale raiding towards that of larger- scale infantry operations in which the commandos were treated as highly trained infantry instead of raiders.Chappell 1996, p. 30. In addition to this, the losses suffered by the commando units serving in North Africa and Italy needed to be replaced. At the time there were widespread shortages across the entire British Army, and the volunteer nature of the commandos meant that there were even greater difficulties to replace commando losses. As a result, it was decided that some of these losses could be made up by disbanding No. 12 Commando.Moreman 2006, p. 29. Following the disbandment of the unit, many of the unit's personnel were transferred to other commando units, namely Nos. 1, 3, 5 and 6 Commandos.

His other major exhibitions have included the Primavera 2005 show at the Museum of Contemporary Art, Sydney, and the inaugural National Indigenous Art Triennial (Culture Warriors) at the National Gallery of Australia in 2007. In 2012, his work was included in the National Museum of Australia's exhibition Menagerie: Contemporary Indigenous Sculpture as well as in the second National Indigenous Art Triennial, while international recognition came in 2013 with representation in the National Gallery of Canada's exhibition of international indigenous art. Life Mellor was born in Mackay, Queensland, in 1971. His father was of American and Australian descent; his mother had Irish, Mamu, Ngagen, and Ngajan heritage. Mellor's maternal great-great-grandmother, Eleanor Kelly, and great- grandmother, May Kelly, were Indigenous Australian people from the rainforest country around Cairns. The family was peripatetic: in his first twenty years, Mellor lived in Mackay, Queensland; Scotland; Brisbane, Queensland; Sutton Grange, Victoria; Adelaide, South Australia; and Cape Town, South Africa, as well as in the Northern Territory. Mellor went to school at Steiner Schools in South Australia and South Africa; in high school he was taught art by his mother. Looking back at the influence of his schooling upon his art, he remarked how, despite the Eurocentric origins of Rudolf Steiner's approach to education, \\"there are comparable elements and themes inherent in [Steiner's] philosophical narrative that parallel an Indigenous outlook, which is holistic in the way it approaches deeper and more intuitive readings of the environment and landscape.\\" The Fine Art Department of Birmingham Institute of Art and Design, where Mellor completed his Masters After completing a Certificate in Art at the North Adelaide School of Art in 1991, Mellor undertook a Bachelor of Arts with Honours at the ANU in 1992‚Äì1994, and a Masters in Fine Art at Birmingham Institute of Art and Design, part of the Birmingham City University, in 1995‚Äì1996. In the early 2000s, he entered a doctorate at the ANU, where he also taught print-media and drawing. He completed his PhD in 2004. As of 2013, Mellor is a lecturer at Sydney College of the Arts, within the University of Sydney. Mellor is married to artist Joanne Kennedy. Career In the early 1990s, Mellor won drawing prizes at the ANU's Canberra School of Art and the Grafton Regional Gallery in New South Wales. Through the mid-1990s, while studying in Canberra and Birmingham, he was represented in numerous student and other exhibitions, in Australia, Belgium, Japan, Korea and the United Kingdom. These included exhibitions titled Passage, at Kyoto Seika University in Japan in 1994, and Fragile Objects at the National Library of Australia in 1996. Mellor's works have been included in the National Aboriginal & Torres Strait Islander Art Award on several occasions, in 2000, 2001, and every year from 2003 to 2010. In 2003, his mezzotint print Cyathea cooperi, portraying tree ferns native to the Queensland rainforest, was highly commended. Subsequent entries have included Of fragile dreams the heart which nevermore in 2005, Untitled (Ernie Grant in Blackman Street) in 2006, Exotic lies and sacred ties (the heart that conceals, the tongue that never reveals) in 2008, and A Transcendent Vision (of life, death and resurrection) in 2010. Reviewing the 2008 exhibition, academic Sarah Scott expressed surprise that Mellor's 2008 piece had neither attracted an award nor been purchased for the Northern Territory's public collection. Primavera 2005, an annual exhibition of young artists' work held at the Museum of Contemporary Art in Sydney, included Mellor's work Fig 1-100 (This particular collection made sense), a mixed media composition that included specimens of Ulysses butterflies. He has had numerous other exhibitions, both individually and as part of group shows, at galleries including the Queensland Art Gallery in 2003, the Canberra Museum and Art Gallery in 2006, and the Indigenous Ceramic Art Awards, at Shepparton Gallery in Victoria in 2007. Mellor's work was represented in the first National Indigenous Art Triennial in 2007, with the elaborate (and elaborately named) sculpture The contrivance of a vintage Wonderland (A magnificent flight of curious fancy for science buffs, a china ark of seductive whimsy, a divinely ordered special attraction, upheld in multifariousness) featuring a diorama that included sculpted kangaroos made with blue and white crockery fragments (evoking Spode bone china), real kangaroo skin (used for the ears and paws), and synthetic eyeballs; stuffed birds sat in a life-sized mixed- media tree overhead. The work featured in media reports of the exhibition, including by The Adelaide Advertiser, The Canberra Times, The West Australian and the Australian Broadcasting Corporation. Since graduating, Mellor has won several awards, including the Canberra Critic's Choice Award in 2006, and the $15,000 John Tallis National Works on Paper Acquisitive Award in 2008. The following year, he won the Victorian Indigenous Ceramic Art Award, held at Shepparton Art Gallery in Shepparton, Victoria. In August 2009, Mellor won the AU$40,000 National Aboriginal & Torres Strait Islander Art Award, for his mixed media work From Rite to Ritual. It was only the third time in the award's 26 years that an urban Aboriginal artist had been the winner. Earlier that year his solo show at Brisbane's Jan Murphy Gallery had sold out. Also in that year, Mellor's work was featured alongside that of Patricia Piccinini and Cherry Hood in the Newcastle Region Art Gallery's show Animal Attraction. Though Mellor has not had a painting hung in the Archibald Prize, he was the subject of Paul Ryan's portrait that was a 2010 finalist in that competition. In 2012, his work was included in the National Museum of Australia's exhibition Menagerie: Contemporary Indigenous Sculpture, and in the second National Indigenous Art Triennial. He was also selected for inclusion in that year's Blake Prize, with his work Bulluru Storywater. Mellor received international recognition in 2013, when he was included in Sakah√†n, the National Gallery of Canada's \\"most ambitious contemporary art exhibition in its history\\". Among the national collections containing Mellor's work are the National Gallery of Australia, which owns his prize-winning From Rite to Ritual, and the Parliament House Art Collection. Most other major Australian art collections have holdings, including the state gallery of his birth state, Queensland, and the main public gallery of the city where he completed much of his tertiary study, the Canberra Museum and Gallery. Other state and territory galleries in which he is represented include the Art Gallery of South Australia, the Museum and Art Gallery of the Northern Territory and the National Gallery of Victoria. Public regional galleries that have collected Mellor's creations include Newcastle Regional Art Gallery in New South Wales, and Warrnambool Art Gallery in Victoria. He is also represented in the Australian government's collection, Artbank, as well as in large, private collections such as the Kerry Stokes. In the 2010s, Mellor became involved in administrative and leadership roles in the arts community. In 2010, he became a member of the Visual Arts Board of the Australia Council for the Arts. In 2011, Mellor was not an entrant in the National Aboriginal & Torres Strait Islander Art Award, as he instead became one of its judges. Appointed to the Visual Arts Board for a further term, Mellor in 2013 became its Chair. At the same time, Mellor continued to exhibit works. In 2014, a survey of his works opened at the University of Queensland Art Museum, and was scheduled to travel to the Museum and Art Gallery of the Northern Territory later in the year. The exhibition was favourably reviewed in theguardian.com, with art critic Sharne Wolff drawing attention to Mellor's newest sculpture, Anima, which she said \\"marks a dramatic change\\" for the artist, bearing \\"no resemblance to Mellor‚Äôs more glamorous output\\". His work featured as part of the Edinburgh International Festival, with a show titled Primordial: SuperNaturalBayiMinyjirral displayed at the National Museum of Scotland. A large work of Mellor's, Entelekheia (2016), consisting of photographic images of plants etched in concrete, can be found on the exterior walls of the International Convention Centre in Sydney. Technique and themes Mellor's From Rite to Ritual (2009) Mellor's extensive scholarly art education has led to his art having a strong theoretical base. In interviews he has acknowledged the influence of diverse artists, including Indigenous painter Rover Thomas, Australian Sulman Prize winner Tim Storrier, Romantic painters including Germany's Caspar David Friedrich, and contemporary German artists Joseph Beuys, and Beuys' student Anselm Kiefer. He has harnessed a wide range of media during his career, including printmaking, drawing, painting and sculpture utilising wood, glass, steel and ceramics, as well as a range of more unorthodox materials, as his 2007 Indigenous Art Triennial entry demonstrated. Reflecting on that sculpture, Artlink Magazine's reviewer, Daniel Thomas, remarked on how the work signified \\"how colonisers always get things wrong; how Europeans looking for China, and its fine porcelain manufactures, stumbled instead upon the land of the kangaroo, and traded and planted ideas of racial and cultural superiority\\". When Sarah Scott considered the 2008 work Exotic Lies and Sacred Ties, which, like From Rite to Ritual, drew on evocations of Spode china, she highlighted its exploration of the history of cross-cultural relations. Noting the landscape that forms the central element of the painting, she observed: From Rite to Ritual examined relationships between Indigenous and settler cultures, including differences in spiritual practices. Mellor, in an artist's statement for the awards, described the work as showing \\"what is a moment of contact, a conversation and interaction between two cultures; it speaks of the challenges of settlement, and the differences in spiritual enactment and belief\\". Commenting on the work, the judges of the prize remarked that the \\"surprising scale and layering of imagery, with its understated political and historical references\\" made the work \\"outstanding\\" and of \\"great complexity and grace\\". Art writer Nicolas Rothwell described the work as drawing a parallel \\"between Aboriginal initiation rituals and the ceremonies inside a Masonic lodge.\\" Mellor's earlier works examined the relationships between cultures, including in his mezzotint prints in which he juxtaposed \\"images of native and introduced flora and fauna‚Äîfor example, a kangaroo with a bull‚Äîto symbolise two different peoples and cultures\\". These issues were also addressed in his painting for the exhibition Native Titled Now, shown in South Australia in 1996. Mellor's interest in cultural interactions extends beyond the making of his art. In a panel discussion on Indigenous art education, Mellor emphasised that, in teaching Indigenous art within visual arts, it was important to be aware of both Aboriginal and settler history, \\"so you can talk about their interaction and the whole set of issues that arise from those two things being parallel\\". Mellor's emphasis on past interactions between cultures led gallerist and critic Michael Reid to consider that Mellor's works had earned him \\"an important place in the visual narrative of Australian history\\". For Mellor, Indigenous identity is a theme highlighted both in his work and (not necessarily by his own choice) in public life. As a fair-skinned man with blue eyes and caucasian features, his appearance has occasionally raised questions of \\"authenticity\\". Mellor found himself the target of columnist Andrew Bolt, who took issue with Mellor entering and winning the 2009 National Aboriginal & Torres Strait Islander Art Award. Bolt wrote \\"This white university lecturer, with his nice Canberra studio, has by winning pushed aside real draw-in-the- dirt Aboriginal artists such as Dorothy Napangardi, Mitjili Napanangka Gibson and Walangkura Napanangka, who had also entered and could really have used that cash and recognition.\\" Commentator Ellie Savage, criticising Bolt, wondered why someone who \\"neither draws in the dirt nor lives in it\\" should therefore have \\"no right to enter competitions for Indigenous artists\\". Bolt two years later lost a case brought by nine Indigenous Australians‚Äînot including Mellor‚Äîfor racial discrimination over articles that criticised fair- skinned Indigenous people, including the post that had lambasted Mellor.. Art writer Maurice O'Riordan, reviewing the 2009 Award, noted the Bolt controversy, but pointed out that Mellor, while in early works acknowledging his own Indigenous heritage, is not concerned with the definition of Aboriginality, but with historical interaction between cultures and the re- imagining of history.

Plamondon was born in L'Ancienne-Lorrette in the Province of Quebec. He was taken in charge by a local parish priest at age six, and was taught to read and write. He attended the Petit S√©minaire de Qu√©bec and planned to enter the priesthood himself, but later chose to become a lawyer. He published a short work entitled Almanach des dames pour l‚Äôann√©e 1807, par un jeune Canadien while still a legal scholar, and was licensed as an advocate, barrister, attorney, and solicitor on August 1, 1811. It is estimated that Plamondon earned at least ¬£500 per year. He also trained young legal scholars, including Thomas Cushing Aylwin. Plamondon was a founding member of the Literary Society of Quebec, and served for a time as its secretary. It was in this capacity that he delivered a speech praising King George III of the United Kingdom in 1809. He later served as a militia captain in the War of 1812. He was a founding member of the Quebec Education Society in 1821, and was one of the few francophone members of the Quebec Library. Plamondon died on January 1, 1828.

The main focus is to provide a realistic racing experience for the online multiplayer game and to allow single player races against AI cars. Users can set personal bests which can then be uploaded to LFSWorld in hotlap mode, and take driving lessons in 'training' mode. LFS is entirely distributed via the Internet. It can be downloaded and installed for free from the official website, but unlocking all of the features requires purchasing a license. Without a license it functions as a feature-limited demo, with only one track and three cars available. Gameplay LFS features input support for steering wheels, mice, keyboards, joysticks, and gamepads. It supports output to 2D and 3D including virtual reality goggles like Oculus Rift. Races can either be set to end at a certain number of laps, or be set to run for a certain length of time, as seen in endurance racing. There is support for refueling and tire changes in pit stops and mid-race adjustment of pit strategy. Pit lane speed limits of 80 km/h (50 mph) are enforced by penalties similar to those seen in real motorsport, including drive-through, stop and go, or time penalties. Starting grids can be determined at random, from the finishing positions in the previous race, or from the results in a qualifying period before the race. A training mode is included to help drivers acquaint themselves with driving skills and the handling characteristics of each car. The lessons cover subjects such as cornering, throttle and brake control, and negotiating opponents. To pass each lesson, the lesson must be completed within a certain set of objectives. They are arranged as in sets, one for each car and ordered from slow to fast. Each lesson must be completed before advancing to the next, however, completing them is not necessary to unlock cars, as all are available in any other mode from the beginning. Simulation Among other things, the physics engine simulates tires, the suspension, aerodynamics, the drivetrain, several gearbox types, clutch overheating, car body damage, and engine damage. The tire model features dynamic wear, dynamic dirt, flat spots, hot spots and tire wall deformation. The simulator supports 3D devices, including 3D TVs, headsets, projectors, the HTC Vive, and Oculus Rift (both DK1 and DK2, from version 0.6F and 0.6G). Cars LX4, a lightweight two-seater sports car The S2 release offers a total of 20 different vehicles. They range from beginner- friendly models to cars more suited for players with more experience. There is a broad power spectrum, ranging from under 100 hp to over 700 hp. The cars range from fictional sports cars, GT DTM-like race cars and former JGTC series cars to road legal hatchbacks. While LFS' car selection mainly includes fictional cars, it also has five real officially licensed cars: *BMW Sauber F1.06 *Formula BMW *McGill University's Formula SAE (in conjunction with McGill Racing Team) *Valmet RaceAbout 2003 concept sports car designed by Helsinki Polytechnic Stadia *Volkswagen Scirocco (Not yet released) Tracks LFS has seven different fictional track areas, including one loosely based on eastern central London, one based on Jamaican surroundings and one near Kyoto, Japan. Each one of them has several different configurations and each of those can be also driven in reversed configuration. The simulator also contains a laser-scanned version of Rockingham Motor Speedway as part of the S3 license. Additionally, users can create their own custom layouts using cones and other objects with the in-game autocross editor; the two car park environments in the game are useful for creating such layouts. Releases The game is intended to be released in three parts, S1 (Stage 1), S2, and S3. Each stage will feature improvements in many areas, such as physics model, graphics and sound. Technical improvements introduced in each new stage become available for previous stages as well, with the main difference between stages being additional cars and tracks, as well as the maximum number of players connected to a server. A fully working, commercial, alpha version of Stage 2 was released on June 24, 2005. Stage 3 was launched on 19 December 2015, and the latest patch (0.6T) was released in July 2018.Live for Speed, version 0.6T Some backward compatibility exists; an S3 license holder may also be able to access servers for S2, S1 or demo servers. Competition Formula BMW LFS was used in Intel Racing Tour, a competition arranged in Germany in 2007 with a brand new BMW Z4 (E85) car as the main prize for the winner. Thanks to Intel Racing Tour, the BMW Sauber F1.06 was added to the game in an update. LFS is also related to V1 Championship which was launched in 2008 and shown on TV in the United Kingdom. V1 Championship is a competition arranged by a company called V1 Championship Limited whose aim is to discover a new British racing driver talent. LFS was used as a part of the driver selection process in addition to physical and psychological tests before testing in real cars. If successful in V1 Championship, the contender would acquire a seat in a racing team and would have required to fully commit to have a career in motorsport. Thanks to this co-operation with V1 Championship, LFS acquired a license to use the Formula BMW car and to help at modelling it to the game. An opportunity to add Rockingham Motor Speedway to LFS came through a contact from V1 Championship, and the track has been announced to be part of the S3 content. However, the track was not playable until game version 0.6K, released in December 2015. Future development LFS was used by Turtle Entertainment and Volkswagen to showcase the new Scirocco in Leipzig Games Convention in 2008. A competition using LFS was held and the prize was a real Scirocco car. The Scirocco release for Live for Speed had been scheduled for December 19, 2008, however it has been delayed indefinitely due to unexpected fatal flaws in the latest patch and with the Scirocco itself, forcing the LFS team to remake the suspension system and tire physics. LFSWorld LFS integrates with LFSWorld.net, a real-time comprehensive statistics website and database with an online skin support. Each racer's online race statistics are collected including per-lap personal bests, lap counts, distances traveled, and the amount of fuel burnt. Users can view other racers' stats and download their hotlaps as well. Also included is a database of community formed teams. Additionally, there is an official world record lap time chart, where racers can upload hotlaps, which exists per track and car. Users may also upload custom car skins to the website, from where the skins then are automatically downloaded as needed in-game to other players. Reception Critical reception The original Live for Speed was a nominee for PC Gamer USs 2003 \\"Best Racing Game\\" award, which ultimately went to NASCAR Racing 2003 Season. A writer for the magazine called Live for Speed evidence that \\"accurate driving physics and fun, accessible racing action can co-exist in the same game\\". PC Gameworld's 2003 review of Live for Speed S1 by Walter Hurdle scored 89% and said: \\"A very strong simulation that offers fun and a high level of realism.\\" Justin Kranzl of APC magazine called the S1 release \\"the best PC racing simulator ever\\". Pelit magazine's 2004 review of LFS' S1 release by Mika √Ñ√§ril√§ scored 92/100 and said: \\"Saloon cars and meticulous simulation. Absolute cream of the crop.\\" Free translation from Finnish Bytesector.com's 2005 review of S2 release said: \\"Nothing short of going to a track actually compares to the experience. Live for Speed is, by far, the most intense and demanding game I've ever played.\\" Awards In 2005, AutoSimSport magazine gave LFS their \\"Best simulation\\" award and Blackhole Motorsports website readers voted to give LFS the following awards: *BHM \\"Game of the Year\\" award *BHM \\"Best Multiplayer\\" award *BHM \\"Best Physics\\" award *BHM \\"Surprise of the Year\\" award References External links *Official LFS site *Official LFSWorld statistics site *LFS Manual Wiki *LFS Forum Category:2003 video games Category:Racing simulators Category:Racing video games Category:Video games developed in the United Kingdom Category:Windows games Category:Windows-only games Category:Oculus Rift games ","title":"Live for Speed"},{"id":"24011925","text":"Special Kindness In Packages, Inc.

Before his accession to the governorship, Calvo served as the Guam Legislature from 1971 to 1975. He is a member of the Republican Party of Guam. Early life Calvo was born in Aga√±a, Guam, and is the eldest son of Eduardo \\"Jake\\" Torres Calvo (1909‚Äì1963) and Veronica Mariano McDonald (1913‚Äì2009). His only two brothers and two sisters-in-law are Edward (1936‚Äì2004), Thomas (1940‚Äì2015), Frances Matias Calvo & Rosario Castro Calvo. His paternal grandparents were Attorney Don Tomas Anderson Calvo and Do√±a Regina Martinez Torres. His maternal grandparents were John Francis McDonald and Dolores Mariano. He attended George Washington High School in Guam. He then attended the Peacock Military Academy and Santa Clara University. Political career He embarked on a business career in his family's insurance company in 1958, and entered politics during the 1960s as a member of the Republican Party. He was elected as a senator in the Legislature of Guam in 1965, and during his three terms in the body served as chair of the government Committee on Finance and Taxation and parliamentary leader of the Republican Party. Calvo was elected governor in 1978, and served until 1982. Calvo-Palomo Campaign (1974) Calvo teamed up with Senator Tony Palomo to challenge the incumbents, Gov. Carlos Camacho and Lt. Gov. Kurt Moylan. The Calvo-Palomo ticket's attacks on the administration included charges of corruption and favoritism, and the primary election was so close ‚Äì Camacho-Moylan won by only 261 votes ‚Äì that Calvo- Palomo decided to run as a write-in team for the general election. While Calvo-Palomo lost in the general election, they forced a runoff election to be held between Camacho-Moylan and the Democratic team of Ricardo J. Bordallo and Rudy Sablan. Camacho-Moylan lost the runoff, and afterward Carlos Camacho retired from politics and gave control of the Republican Party to Calvo. Governorship (1979‚Äì1983) During his first year as governor, Calvo reduced the government of Guam's deficit by $27 million, but the deficit continued to climb for the rest of his term due mainly to long-standing problems with tax collections. Guam's economy began to regain health under Calvo's administration, as he sought to attract new businesses to Guam, including a tuna-fishing fleet, a garment manufacturer, and hotel construction. Visitor arrivals also registered sharp increases. But Calvo's term as governor was marred by the teacher's strike of 1981, which lasted many months and caused deep divisions in Guam's education system. He lost to Bordallo-Reyes Campaign in the 1982 election and decided to retire from politics. Although he has never run for office since, Calvo remains strongly influential in Republican politics, as its senior statesman, and his son Eddie Baza Calvo was one of the most popular senators in I Liheslaturan Gu√•han/the Guam Legislature and was elected governor of Guam in 2010 along with running mate Ray Tenorio. Personal life He is married to Rosa Herrero Baza and had eight children, including Eddie Calvo, who was Governor of Guam from 2011 to 2019. References External links * Paul M.

The unique Springfree design was invented by Dr. Keith Vivian Alexander, an associate professor in the Mechanical Engineering Department at the University of Canterbury in Christchurch, New Zealand.Associate Professor Keith Alexander ‚Äì University of Canterbury History A springfree trampoline After careful analysis of worldwide trampoline data in 1992, Dr Keith Vivian Alexander of Canterbury University, Christchurch, New Zealand, revealed that there were three major impact zones to a traditional trampoline designed by George Nissen in the 1930s; these impact zones would need to be engineered out in order to build the safest trampoline: #The Springs ‚Äì on the jumping surface #The Steel Frame ‚Äì on the jumping surface/ jumpers may fall and injure themselves #The Ground or obstructions on the ground ‚Äì jumpers would hit as a result of falling off In 1999, he released his first prototype utilizing glass-reinforced plastic rods, with the first commercial versions began selling in late 2004. In 2009, the Springfree Trampoline won an Australian Design Award. Design Alternative springfree trampoline The most obvious difference between a Springfree Trampoline and the traditional trampoline design is the use of glass- reinforced plastic rods instead of steel coil springs. The US Consumer Product Safety Commission estimates that in 2001 there were 91,870 hospital emergency room-treated injuries associated with trampolines. The Springfree trampoline uses rods to form a flexible soft edge resulting in the rigid frame being lowered around 450mm below the jumping surface. This removes two known hazards from the jumping surface ‚Äì the rigid perimeter frame and the steel coil springs. The base of the trampoline is also more rigid than conventional trampolines. Injury statistics Virginia Judge, Fair Trading Minister has ordered a review of the safety of backyard trampolines due to the concerns raised by child safety experts. They have concluded that around 15% of children are admitted to hospital following trampoline injuries; most of the injuries are from falling off the trampoline and 29% are from children falling into/onto the steel frame and springs of the trampoline. A paper has been written on the effectiveness of Pads and Enclosure Nets as safety interventions on consumer trampolines. In 1998 the American Association of Pediatricians wanted to ban consumer trampolines because of the rising injury rate; the International Trampoline Industry Association (ITA) have endeavored to deliver safer trampolines, the ITA and American Society of Testing an Materials (ASTM) agreed on upgrading Trampoline Safety Standards. These improvements appeared in 1999 which included extended padding to cover the springs and the steel frame, warnings and no access to children under 6 and in 2001 enclosure nets were brought in to prevent falling off. It is questioned whether these interventions really work.

After three years with Stockport County, without breaking into the first team, he moved to Preston in February 1908 followed by a further move in the summer of 1908 to join Chorley of the Lancashire Combination. At Chorley, Brittleton began to establish a reputation as a useful inside-forward and attracted the attention of several Football League clubs.

Joe: A Real American Hero toyline, comic books and animated series. He is the G.I. Joe Team's communications expert and debuted in 1986. Profile Born in Phoenix, Arizona, Mainframe's real name is Blaine L. Parker, and his rank is sergeant E-5. Mainframe was both an athlete and a scholar as a child, though as a self- confessed nerd, he would much rather learn about computers than do anything else. He graduated high school at the age of seventeen, and immediately enlisted in the Army airborne. He soon headed into battle overseas, receiving his Combat Infantryman Badge, and later left the army to get his degree from MIT on the G.I. Bill. Mainframe then did a stint developing computer software in Silicon Valley, making big bucks and fighting boredom with a stick. Luckily, the Marines were looking for a few good men with just his qualifications, and Mainframe was soon back in uniform. He even served at the Pentagon for a time, before joining the G.I. Joe Team as a computer specialist. The world's ever-increasing reliance upon technology makes him a valued member of the G.I. Joe Team, and his ability to design computer viruses makes him a nuisance to Cobra Command. Toys A Real American Hero Mainframe was first released as an action figure in 1986. He was also available in 1987, and was discontinued in 1988. A re-colored version of Mainframe was also released in 1986, as an exclusive in a special set from Toys R Us named \\"Special Mission: Brazil\\". The boxed set also included Claymore, and re-colored versions of Dial Tone, Leatherneck, and Wet Suit. The set included a cassette tape that detailed the secret mission. 25th Anniversary In 2008, a new version of Mainframe was released, but renamed \\"Dataframe\\".

Mainframe and Dusty are sent in to locate a Cobra Terror Drome launch base hidden in the country after spy satellites detect the base's infrared signature. In exchange for helping them ambush one of Sharif's weapons convoys, the Royalists give the Joes a guide to lead them through the desert, a local teen named Rashid. Much of the story deals with Rashid's disrespect for Mainframe for not being a 'real' soldier. However, after watching Mainframe reprogram a Firebat to strafe enemy troops and hearing about his past as a frontline soldier from Dusty, Rashid changes his mind about Mainframe and even becomes an expert in computer in order to honor him.G.I.

Formation Formed by students at the University of Florida, the band played their first gig at the Gainesville venue The Covered Dish and went on to perform there frequently for a period of several years. The band toured the US and shared the stage with Blink-182, Bloodhound Gang, Less Than Jake, For Squirrels, Fastball, Marvelous 3, Harvey Danger, James Brown and others. They performed at many music venues including CBGB, Mercury Lounge, House of Blues and others. They also performed at festivals including CMJ Music Marathon, Sundance Film Festival, Warped Tour, Stop the Violence, NEMO, Atlantis Music Conference and Alachua County Music Harvest, among others. In 1999, the Gainesville music community awarded the band \\"Favorite Pop Band\\" at the annual Hogtown Music Awards and they were later profiled in Billboard magazine. The band was formed by the brothers Youngman (vocalist/guitarist John and bassist Bill) and the lineup around them changed a few times. Geoffrey May was the band's first drummer, replaced by dino Fernandez, who was the longest-running member besides the brothers. In between regular guitarists, Derron Nuhfer (formerly of Less Than Jake) would sometimes also sit in with the group playing guitar. The band's guitarists also included Mike Hale, Ray Powell and Aaron Carr. Commercial success In 1998, Slack Season recorded a set of demos with producer-engineer Michael Ray FitzGerald at Music Factory in Jacksonville Beach, Florida. Those demos garnered interest from Epic Records VP of A&R; Rose Noone. The band drove to New York in the middle of winter to showcase at Arlene Grocery, but no deal ensued. After a couple false starts with other labels and producers, the band flew to New York City on September 8, 2001 to showcase for MCA Records executives and producer Don Gehman at CBGB. Shortly after the September 11 attacks the group disbanded.

Nikk≈ç Sh≈çnin later appointed Nichimoku as his successor as Head Priest (Kancho) of Taiseki-ji temple. Pious beliefs claim that he will someday leave the state of Nirvana to usher conversion of the Emperor of Japan and the widespread propagation of Nichiren Shoshu Buddhism. Today, the Mokushiza seat inside the Dai-Kyakuden (English: Grand Reception Hall) of Taisekiji Head Temple is named in honor of Nichimoku Sh≈çnin. In 1333, Nichimoku died at age 74, and his cremated remains are stored within Taisekiji, while the anniversary of his death on November 15 coincides with the Shichi-Go-San tradition for young children called Mokushi-E ceremony, later popularized during the Edo period. The symbol crest attributed to Nichimoku is the Three Friends of Winter combination, and in Buddhist iconography he is often portrayed with a flattened scalp. Early life Three commemoriative Buddhist stupas in honor of Nichiren, Nikk≈ç and Nichimoku. Circa 1685, during the Tokugawa period. Taisekiji temple. Nichimoku Sh≈çnin was born in Hateke-go in Izu, Tagata District, Shizuoka prefecture, on 28 April 1260. His father was Niida Goro Shigetsuna and his mother was Ren Ani, who was the eldest daughter of Lord Nanjo Hyo-e Shichiro, the father of Nanjo Tokimitsu. Ren Ani was the elder sister of Nanjo Tokimitsu. In the year 1274, at the age of 12, Nikk≈ç Sh≈çnin met Nichimoku at Mount Soto. That year he witnessed a debate between the chief priest, Shikizobozu, and Nikk≈ç Sh≈çnin, and later became Nikk≈ç's disciple. At the age of thirteen, he entered the Shingon Enzobo temple, a center that focused on teaching the principle of the master and disciple relationship, as it commonly applied to mostly Samurai warriors. In 8 April 1276, (age 14), he entered the priesthood and embraced the Dharma at Mount Soto Temple; he upheld Nikk≈ç Sh≈çnin as his master and received the disciple name of Kunaikyo-Kimi. As Nichiren's disciple On 24 November 1276, he traveled with Nikk≈ç Sh≈çnin to Mount Minobu. There, he met Nichiren for the first time, who approved his new Buddhist training. For seven years, he served Nichiren as an assistant until Nichiren's death in 1282. In Buddhist iconography, Nichimoku is featured with a flattened scalp due to a legend claiming that every day for seven years, Nichimoku Sh≈çnin made several trips to the river in the valley of Minobu to fetch morning water for Nichiren. Nichimoku then carried the water in a wooden bucket on his head which is said to have caused a depression in his head. Today, a similar custom is performed by younger Nichiren Shoshu priests in training, upon which they fetch early morning water at a nearby river for the Dai Gohonzon image. In February 1279, Nichiren finally inscribed a Gohonzon for Nichimoku, now kept inside the Head Temple Taisekiji. In September 1282, Nichimoku accompanied Nichiren and Nikk≈ç to the therapeutic hot springs of Hitachi, in Iwaki City of Fukushima Prefecture. On the way, they stopped at the house of Ikegami Munenaka at Musashi Province in Ota, Tokyo where Nichiren died. Upon Nichimoku's return to Mount Minobu, he maintained Nichiren's grave, and he traveled to Oshu Province in the Tohoku Region to propagate the teachings of Nichiren. He established the four Oshu temples Hongen-ji, Jogyo-ji, Myoen-ji, and Myokyo-ji. Sho-Chiku-Bai, The Pine tree, Plum tree and Bamboo tree, the crest symbol adopted by Nichimoku Sh≈çnin. A Chinese porcelain plate of the Qianlong Emperor, 1735. As a result of Nichimoku's efforts in the Oshu region, Nikk≈ç Sh≈çnin bestowed the Gohonzon upon numerous believers in the area almost every year, after establishing Taiseki-ji. There are 30 Gohonzons inscribed by Nichimoku that are still catalogued and preserved to this day. After doctrinal conflicts between Nikk≈ç Sh≈çnin and Mimbu Niko and Hakiri Sanenaga, the steward of Mount Minobu, he sided with Nikk≈ç and left Yamanashi Prefecture. On 13 October 1290, Nikk≈ç Sh≈çnin bestowed a Joza Gohonzon to Nichimoku to mark the beginning of transfer of successorship. This ‚Äò‚ÄôJoza‚Äô‚Äô Gohonzon is currently enshrined in the Reception Hall (Dai-Kyaku-den) of Taisekiji, and is now known as the Ogazawari Gohonzon. Eight years later, in 1298, Nikk≈ç Sh≈çnin followed Nichiren‚Äôs example of assigning successors and designated six senior disciples, headed by Nichimoku. After this designation, Nikk≈ç Sh≈çnin moved to Omosu (currently Kitayama Hommon-ji Temple) and began to transfer the entirety of Taiseki-ji to Nichimoku Sh≈çnin. On 10 November 1332, Nikk≈ç Sh≈çnin, at the age of 87, finalized the transfer of successorship to Nichimoku Sh≈çnin via the ‚ÄúArticles to be Observed After the Passing of Nikk≈ç‚Äù (Nikk≈ç ato jo-jo no koto), which he had previously prepared, along with the Buddhist articles that were previously confiscated from Kuonji Temple. Nikk≈ç died four months later on 7 February 1333. At age 74, Nichimoku continued to warn and remonstrate against the Kamakura imperial authorities and his frequent travels under difficult conditions worsened his already poor health. His legs slowly became paralyzed and he was constantly ill. Nevertheless, he considered it his mission to present Nichiren's treatise Rissh≈ç Ankoku Ron (Á´ãÊ≠£ÂÆâÂõΩË´ñ) (On Securing the Peace of the Land through the Propagation of True Buddhism) to Emperor Go- daigo in person, which failed. For this reason, some pious believers claim this to be an unfinished task for his future rebirth. Prior to his leaving Takiseki-ji one last time, Nichimoku Sh≈çnin is claimed to have privately chosen Nichido Sh≈çnin from among his senior disciples. Accompanied by the priests Nichizon and Nichigo, Nichimoku Sh≈çnin then set forth on his journey to remonstrate against the Emperor of Japan. Traveling to Kyoto with paralysis took approximately 11 days, and he finally fell mortally ill at Tarui in Mino Province in Gifu Prefecture. The two disciples who accompanied him constantly remained at his side and cared for him. In the end, Nichimoku Sh≈çnin directed his two disciples to go on to meet with the Emperor and remonstrate in his stead; furthermore, he instructed them to report the news to Nichido Sh≈çnin. Then, he directed the two to enshrine a Gohonzon and he quietly chanted Nam Myoho Renge Kyo. Death and legacy The High Priest sits opposite in the Mokushiza seat belonging to Nichimoku Sh≈çnin. The 2:30 AM Ushitora Gongyo service, Taisekiji Head Temple, Japan. Nichimoku died on 15 November 1333, on which his two disciples mistook him to still be asleep. Both disciples, Nichizon and Nichigo cremated Nichimoku Sh≈çnin and carried his remains with them, as they went on to confront the Emperor in his stead. Later on, Nichizon remained in Kyoto to propagate while Nichigo returned to Taiseki-ji with the remains of Nichimoku Sh≈çnin. Pious traditions claim that upon his return to the Saha world of humans, he will accomplish the unfinished task of remonstration before his mortal death on 15 November 1333, on which present High Priests of Nichiren Shoshu customarily offer a banquet dinner for younger priests in training in hopes of finding the rebirth of Nichimoku Sh≈çnin among the prospective candidates. According to pious hagiography, Nichimoku Sh≈çnin's deathbed poem read as follows: Among believers, the anniversary of his death on November 15 is associated with the Shichi-Go-San tradition for young children of receiving sweets and money, which was later popularized during the Edo period, now called the Mokushi-e ceremony. The venerated Mokushiza seat inside the Dai-Kyakuden (English: Grand Reception Hall) of Taisekiji Head Temple is named in honor of Nichimoku Sh≈çnin, while the traditional Buddhist liturgy of Gongyo is recited silently in his name. The symbol crest attributed to Nichimoku is the combination of Pine tree, Plum tree, Bamboo, signifying the ancient Chinese symbol of Three Friends of Winter which are believed to auspiciously endure hardship through the winter season.

Described as \\"a strong, burly full- back with, at times, an inclination to be over-exuberant\\", Brookes retained his place for five matches, before being replaced by the veteran Bert Lee. Brookes was recalled for the third match of the 1913‚Äì14 season, but after six matches Lee returned briefly before Fred Smith took over at right-back.

Two diesel-hauled carriage trains, the Capital Connection and the Northern Explorer (previously Overlander), pass through the station but did not stop even when the station was still open. Muri and Kenepuru stations had been considered for closure by the Greater Wellington Regional Council, claiming that both had low usage and would require considerable expenditure to upgrade for the new Matangi units and for safety considerations ($600,000 estimated for Muri).The Dominion Post 28 July 2009 page A5 & Kapi- Mana News 21 July 2009 page 1 Following a sub-committee meeting of the Greater Wellington Regional Council, Muri station was closed on 30 April 2011.  History  The line through Muri was built by the Wellington and Manawatu Railway Company (WMR), completed to Longburn in 1886. During the last stage of finishing the tunnels on the coastal escarpment towards Paekakariki, the last stop coming from Wellington was called Pukerua, near where Muri Station was. There were no roads into the area yet and passengers had to leave the train, climb down to the beach and continue by rail on temporary tracks to Paekakariki. Material for the construction of the railway north of Muri was offloaded from ships anchored off Pukerua into small boats and brought to the beach. From there, a tramway took the rails, sleepers and bricks up to the railway track at Muri. Muri opened on 28 July 1952, 45 chains (905 m) north of Pukerua Bay, and was closer to the centre of the population of Pukerua Bay at the time.

Fagan attended Columbus High School in Columbus, Wisconsin and then Beloit College, where he was a Phi Beta Kappa member and a star athlete. He lettered in football and track and also played basketball. He was offered a scholarship in 1941 to study at Northwestern University, but he turned it down to enter a Marine officers' training school instead. He joined the Marines on June 24, 1941. Military career Fagan was commissioned a second lieutenant in the Marines in January 1942. Fagan served as commanding officer of Company G, Second Battalion, 9th Marine Regiment, 3rd Marine Division. He fought in the Bougainville, Guadalcanal, New Zealand, Kwajalein, Eniwetok, and Guam campaigns. He was severely wounded in hand-to-hand combat on Iwo Jima on February 26, 1945; he was evacuated and died the following day. Fagan was twice awarded the Navy Cross: once for his actions at the Battle of Guam, the other for his actions at the Battle of Iwo Jima. He received the second award posthumously.

The name was coined by photographer Michael Yon to honor two soldiers who were killed in combat; Benjamin Kopp, a US Army Ranger, and Joseph Etchells, a British soldier. Both were killed in combat in Sangin, Afghanistan in July of 2009. Other names that have been used to describe this phenomenon include scintillation, halo effect, pixie dust, and corona effect. Explanation The Kopp‚ÄìEtchells effect is created by metallic sparks, similar to the sparks generated when grinding metal. Helicopter rotors are fitted with abrasion shields along their leading edges to protect the blades. These abrasion strips are often made of titanium, stainless steel, or nickel alloys, which are very hard, but not as hard as sand. When a helicopter flies low to the ground in desert environments, sand can strike the metal abrasion strip and cause erosion, which produces a visible corona or halo around the rotor blades. The effect is caused by the pyrophoric oxidation of the ablated metal particles. In this way, the Kopp‚ÄìEtchells effect is similar to the sparks made by a grinder, which are also due to pyrophoricity. Abrasion strips made of titanium produce the brightest sparks, and the intensity increases with the size and concentration of sand grains in the air. Sand particles are more likely to hit the rotor when the rotorcraft is near the ground. This occurs because sand is blown into the air by the downwash and then carried to the top of the rotor disk by a vortex of air. This process is called recirculation and can lead to a complete brownout in severe situations. The Kopp‚ÄìEtchells effect, however, is not necessarily associated with takeoff and landing operations. It has been observed without night vision goggles at altitudes as high as . Other theories Rotor tip lights produce a visually similar but distinct effect. The effect is often and incorrectly believed to be an electrical phenomenon, either as a result of static electricity as in St. Elmo's Fire, or due to the interaction of sand with the rotor (triboelectric effect), or a piezoelectric property of quartz sand. Mechanical action has been considered, whereby impact with the sand particles may cause photoluminescence. Additionally, mechanisms relating to triboluminescence, chemiluminescence, and electroluminescence have been suggested. Yet another incorrect theory is that the extreme speed of the helicopter blades pushes sand particles out of the way so fast that they burn up like meteors in the atmosphere due to adiabatic heating. Groundcrew have mistaken the phenomenon for fire or other malfunctions. Consequences MV-22 Osprey in this long-exposure photograph. The erosion associated with the Kopp‚ÄìEtchells effect presents costly maintenance and logistics problems, and is an example of FOD. Sand hitting the moving rotor blades represents a security risk because of the highly visible ring it produces, which places military operations at a tactical disadvantage when trying to remain concealed in darkness. The light from the Kopp‚ÄìEtchells effect can interfere with the pilot's ability to see, especially when using night vision equipment. This may cause difficulty with landing safely, and produce spatial disorientation. With repeated exposure, the Kopp‚ÄìEtchells effect could damage night vision gear.

The soil in the area is gravelly and rocky, and it is damp in the area known as Na Brodcu to the south, where the water table lies just below the surface. Name The name Podskrajnik is a fused prepositional phrase that has lost case inflection, from pod 'below' + Skrajnik, referring to the Skrajnik Ridge. History The Krive Doli site in Podskrajnik The village arose in the mid-19th century in the vicinity of three springs. Villagers from neighboring Zel≈°e also walked to Podskrajnik to draw water until water mains were installed in Zel≈°e in 1911, and during droughts water was also drawn from the Cerkni≈°ƒçica River in nearby Dolenja Vas. A pump and a water tower were installed west of the village in 1854; the tower was dismantled in 1938, but is recalled by the microtoponym Pri Turnu (literally, 'at the tower') at the site. The Gornik Brickworks operated at Na Brodcu until the First World War, employing workers from Friuli. There are several gravel pits in Podskrajnik, which were used to supply a local industry manufacturing concrete products. After the Second World War, there was a military installation immediately northwest of Podskrajnik at a site called Krive Doli. The area has been developed into a retail center today.

Vocalist and bass guitarist, Ez Gom√©r got his start in the mid-eighties when he joined the Swedish melodic metal band Leviticus in time to perform on its third and finest release Setting Fire to the Earth (1986). In 1987, after some extensive European and American touring with Leviticus and after opening for bands like Uriah Heep, Nazareth and Twisted Sister, Gom√©r felt it was time to move on. During his tenure in Leviticus, Ez struck up a friendship with the band's lead vocalist Terry Haw which at this time led to the creation of an energetic new group called Jet Circus consisting only of Gom√©r and Haw. As a live act a drummer was added and showed the band as a trio. Biography Creating Hybrid Metal Gom√©r wanted to create something fresh and different and told \\"The whole idea was to dig inside instead of looking at others\\". Experimenting and having fun was high priority. As a result, the two came up with the creative \\"hybrid-form\\" of funky groove-laden hard rock ‚Äì found on the Sony Epic 1991, US debut release for Jet Circus, Step On It. Jet Circus landed a rare endorsement deal from Harley-Davidson in time for the American release and created an immediate buzz in the hard rock/metal community as well as amongst critics. When served a sound so different and fresh, they did not even have a name for what they heard. The suggestions were as many as there were critics. Some reported \\"Elvis meets Cheap Trick\\" others wrote \\"Led Zeppelin meets Beastie Boys meets Run DMC\\". \\"Jet Circus is what it would sound like if you could plug your guitar into a Harley.\\" Perhaps Derek Oliver of British Kerrang! said it best: \\"Jet Circus.. is the best band I‚Äôve heard to come out of Scandinavia ‚Äì this band is brilliant.\\" Jet Circus is groovy music from the heart ‚Äì all of its own brand. With the 1991 US radio hit song \\"Victory Dance\\", Jet Circus were amongst the first to experiment with metal and rap, which later on led them to be mentioned in the media as grandfathers for bands like Limp Bizkit and Linkin Park. Ez Gom√©r replied: \\"That‚Äôs fine with me as long as I don‚Äôt have to retire\\". In time for their first US tour, Jet Circus went No1 on the CCM radio chart with \\"Break This Jail\\" and were airplayed somewhere in the States every twenty minutes for almost a year with songs like \\"Victory Dance\\", \\"Rockin Horse\\", \\"Jet Blue\\", \\"Step On It\\" and \\"Break This Jail\\" ‚Äì which also went on to be ‚ÄúMetal song of the year‚Äù on CCM. Following a tour of the U.S that same year, Ez and Terry Haw began writing and recording the material that would make up Jet Circus' sophomore effort ‚Äì No Mercy For The Living Dead, but with never ending hazzle with the record company, this album project is still unfinished. No Mercy For The Living Dead was recorded 1992‚Äì93 and 2004. Terry Haw who, since 1993, showed less interest in the band left the band finally in 2003, leaving Gom√©r to be the sole member of Jet Circus. After the American Sony Epic debut, Jet Circus have since then released albums in Japan (Virgin/All Fired Up) South America ‚Äì Brazil, Argentina, Puerto Rico, Peru, Europe ‚Äì Scandinavia, England, Germany, Belgium, Netherlands, Italy, Spain and sold approximately half a million albums. From 1993 to 2004, Gom√©r recorded with bands and artists such as: Mikkey Dee (Motorhead, Dokken), Tony Carey (Rainbow), Stephen Pearcy (Ratt), BB Cunningham (Jerry Lee Lewis), James Lott (Carl Perkins, Johnny Cash), Sayit, (Tony Franklin, Richard Marx), Tommy Denander (Toto, Paul Stanley, Radioactive), Jani Stefanovic (Divinefire, Miseration) Pete Pritchard (Scotty Moore, Eric Clapton).

Coates made his debut for the \\"Saints\\" in the opening match of the 1912‚Äì13 season, a 2‚Äì2 draw with Northampton Town. Nine matches into the season, he lost his place to the veteran Bert Lee but returned in December. Despite showing \\"early promise\\", his form faded as the season went on and in March he was dropped in favour of Richard Brooks. In the summer of 1913, Coates was released and returned to Lancashire to re-join Heywood United.

It was first built around 1850 in the Greek Revival architectural style. Twenty years later, it was bought by Hewett Boice, a local quarry operator. He had the house refurbished in the then-popular Second Empire style. It was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 2001. Property It is a two-and-a-half-story frame building with a two-story rear wing on a stone and brick foundation on the east side of Fair Street. Nearby on that side of the street are the Chichester and William Kenyon houses, both also listed on the Register. It is topped with a mansard roof shingled in patterned slate with an overhanging, bracketed eave. The roof is pierced by round-arched decorated dormer windows. See also: The five-bay west (front) facade has an ornate Victorian porch along its entire first story. On the south elevation is a projecting bay window and the remains of a porte-cochere. A central hall with pressed-metal ceilings, lincrusta wall coverings and flat- paneled wainscoting opens up from the entrance vestibule. A finely crafted staircase goes up from the side, its landing lit by a stained glass window. There are Greek Revival moldings in every room on the first floor, and Italianate marble fireplace surrounds in the parlors. Outside are several contributing resources. Five are objects, all made of bluestone: a carriage mounting block with \\"H. BOICE\\" carved into it, hitching post, two plinth blocks with planters, and a walkway. The former carriage house at the rear of the property, now converted to a home studio, is also contributing. History The minimal records available for the history of Fair Street in the late 19th century, when it was the residence of many of the city's most affluent residents, suggest that the house was built around 1850 by Erastus Cooke, a local lawyer. In 1869 he sold it to Elizabeth P. Cockburn of Hurley, NY. In 1885, she and her husband Wiliam Cockburn sold the house to Hewitt Boice, whose quarry had provided some of the stone for the Brooklyn Bridge, for $7,000 ($ in contemporary dollars). He renovated its exterior in a high Second Empire style, most of which remains intact. In 1917 Boice's daughter, Virginia Boice Seeley inherited it. She, in turn, deeded it to her stepmother, Katherine Deyo Boice, who remarried and lived there until she died in 1953. It has been through several other owners since then but remains a private residence.

The name is used in Africa (especially West Africa) and the Caribbean. The basic principle is that each member of the group makes a standard contribution to a common fund once per time period. Then each period the total contributions are disbursed to a single member of the group. The recipient changes each period in a rotating fashion such that all the members of the group are eventually recipients. Overview A member who receives a distribution early on effectively receives a loan. They collect a larger sum of money early and \\"repay\\" as they make contributions going forward. A member who receives a distribution toward the end of a rotation has effectively been \\"saving\\" their contributions leading up to the disbursal. Traditionally the arrangement is conducted in cash and without any interest charged. The organizer of the sou-sou may be compensated for their efforts as a courtesy. Since a sou-sou is not a written or legal contract it relies on personal trust to discourage malfeasance. For this reason it is more likely that the participants are members of the same community and know each other.  Around the world  The concept of a susu is used throughout the world and has over 200 different names that vary from country to country.

It was attested between the fifth and thirteenth centuries. As its name entails, it was the province of the church's Patriarch. The province consisted of a number of dioceses in the region of Beth Aramaye, between Basra and Kirkuk, which were placed under the patriarch's direct supervision at the synod of Yahballaha I in 420.  Background  It was not normal for the head of an eastern church to administer an ecclesiastical province in addition to his many other duties, but circumstances made it necessary for the patriarch Yahballaha I to assume responsibility for a number of dioceses in Beth Aramaye. The dioceses of Kashkar, Zabe, Hirta, Beth Daraye and Dasqarta d‚ÄôMalka (the Sassanian winter capital Dastagird), doubtless because of their antiquity or their proximity to the capital Seleucia- Ctesiphon, were reluctant to be placed under the jurisdiction of a metropolitan, and it was felt necessary to treat them tactfully. A special relationship between the diocese of Kashkar and the diocese of Seleucia- Ctesiphon was defined in Canon XXI of the synod of 410: 'The first and chief seat is that of Seleucia and Ctesiphon; the bishop who occupies it is the grand metropolitan and chief of all the bishops. The bishop of Kashkar is placed under the jurisdiction of this metropolitan; he is his right arm and minister, and he governs the diocese after his death.' Although their bishops were admonished in the acts of these synods, they persisted in their intransigence, and in 420 Yahballaha I placed them under his direct supervision. This ad hoc arrangement was later formalised by the creation of a 'province of the patriarch'. Kashkar, by tradition an apostolic foundation, was the highest ranking diocese in the province, and its bishops enjoyed the privilege of guarding the patriarchal throne during the interregnum between one patriarch's death and the election of his successor. The diocese of Dasqarta d‚ÄôMalka is not mentioned again after 424, but bishops of the other dioceses were present at most of the fifth- and sixth-century synods. Three more dioceses in Beth Aramaye are mentioned in the acts of the later synods: Piroz Shabur (first mentioned in 486); Tirhan (first mentioned in 544); and Shenna d‚ÄôBeth Ramman or Qardaliabad (first mentioned in 576). All three dioceses were to have a long history. According to Eliya of Damascus, there were thirteen dioceses in the province of the patriarch in 893: Kashkar, al- Tirhan (Tirhan), Dair Hazql (an alternative name for al-Nu ømaniya, the chief town in the diocese of Zabe), al-Hira (Hirta), al-Anbar (Piroz Shabur), al-Sin (Shenna d‚ÄôBeth Ramman),  øUkbara, al-Radhan, Nifr, al-Qasra, 'Ba Daraya and Ba Kusaya' (Beth Daraye),  øAbdasi (Nahargur) and al-Buwazikh (Konishabur or Beth Waziq).Assemani, BO, ii. 458‚Äì9 Eight of these dioceses already existed in the Sassanian period, but the diocese of Beth Waziq is first mentioned in the second half of the seventh century, and the dioceses of  øUkbara, Radhan, Nifr and Qasr were probably founded in the ninth century. The diocese of Nahargur was in the province of Maishan during the Sassanian period, and it is not known when or why it was transferred to the diocese of the patriarch. The first bishop of  øUkbara whose name has been recorded, Hakima, was consecrated by the patriarch Sargis around 870, and bishops of Qasr, Radhan and Nifr are first mentioned in the tenth century. A bishop of 'Qasr and Nahrawan' became patriarch in 963, and then consecrated bishops for Radhan and for 'Nifr and Nil'. Eliya's list helps to confirm the impression given by the literary sources, that the East Syrian communities in Beth Aramaye were at their most prosperous in the tenth century. A partial list of bishops present at the consecration of the patriarch Yohannan IV in 900 included several bishops from the province of the patriarch, including the bishops of Zabe and Beth Daraye and also the bishops Isho øzkha of 'the Gubeans', Hnanisho ø of Delasar, Quriaqos of Meskene and Yohannan 'of the Jews'. The last four dioceses are not mentioned elsewhere and cannot be satisfactorily localised.MS Paris BN Syr 354, folio 147 In the eleventh century decline began to set in. The diocese of Hirta (al-Hira) came to an end, and four other dioceses were combined into two: Nifr and al-Nil with Zabe (al-Zawabi and al-Nu ømaniya), and Beth Waziq (al-Buwazikh) with Shenna d'Beth Ramman (al-Sin). Three more dioceses ceased to exist in the twelfth century. The dioceses of Piroz Shabur (al-Anbar) and Qasr and Nahrawan are last mentioned in 1111, and the senior diocese of Kashkar in 1176. In 1139, at the consecration ceremony of the patriarch  øAbdisho ø III, a bishop from the province of Nisibis was required to proclaim the new patriarch's name, 'because all the bishops of the grand eparchy [Beth Aramaye] had died and their thrones were vacant; something which had never happened before'.Mari, 157 (Arabic), 133 (Latin) By the patriarchal election of 1222 the guardianship of the vacant patriarchal throne, the traditional privilege of the bishop of Kashkar, had passed to the metropolitans of  øIlam. The trend of decline continued in the thirteenth century. The diocese of Zabe and Nil is last mentioned during the reign of Yahballaha II (1190‚Äì1222), and the diocese of  øUkbara in 1222. Only three dioceses are known to have been still in existence at the end of the thirteenth century: Beth Waziq and Shenna, Beth Daron and (perhaps due to its sheltered position between the Tigris and the Jabal Hamrin) Tirhan. However, East Syrian communities may also have persisted in districts which no longer had bishops: a manuscript of 1276 was copied by a monk named Giwargis at the monastery of Mar Yonan 'on the Euphrates, near Piroz Shabur which is Anbar', nearly a century and a half after the last mention of a bishop of Anbar.MS Harvard Syr 27  The diocese of Seleucia-Ctesiphon  For much of their history the patriarchs of the Church of the East sat at Seleucia-Ctesiphon or, more precisely, the Sassanian foundation of Veh-Ardashir on the west bank of the Tigris, built in the third century adjacent to the old city of Seleucia, which was thereafter abandoned. Ctesiphon, founded by the Parthians, was nearby on the east bank of the Tigris. In Syriac texts the double city was normally referred to either by its early name Seleucia-Ctesiphon or as Mahoze ('the capitals'), Mahoza rabba ('the great capital') or Mdinatha d'Beth Aramaye ('the cities of Beth Aramaye'). After the Arab conquest the city was often called by its Arabic name al-Mada øin, 'the two cities'. The diocese of Seleucia-Ctesiphon was a comparatively late foundation, because of the hostility of the Sassanian government to an overt Christian presence in the capital. References to bishops of Seleucia-Ctesiphon in the Parthian period are clearly anachronistic, and several early Sassanian bishops of Seleucia-Ctesiphon are equally unlikely to be genuine. The first bishop of Seleucia-Ctesiphon whose historical existence is not in doubt was Papa, who was consecrated around 280. At a turbulent synod convened at Seleucia-Ctesiphon in 315, Papa secured grudging recognition from the other Persian bishops of the primacy of the diocese of Seleucia-Ctesiphon.Wigram, 47‚Äì55 During the fifth century the diocese of Seleucia-Ctesiphon became the metropolitan diocese of the province of the patriarch. This was a lengthy and complex process, which had to be managed tactfully. At the synod of Isaac in 410, the bishop of Seleucia- Ctesiphon was recognised as 'grand metropolitan and chief of all the bishops', and a special relationship was defined between the diocese of Seleucia- Ctesiphon and the much older diocese of Kashkar, which claimed an apostolic foundation. For the time being, the dioceses of Beth Aramaye remained independent. At the synod of Yahballaha in 420 the dioceses of Beth Aramaye were placed under the direct authority of the 'grand metropolitan'. By the end of the fifth century the synodical acts speak of a 'province of the patriarch', also known, in parallel with the title 'grand metropolitan', as the 'grand eparchy'. Thereafter the metropolitan authority of the bishops of Seleucia-Ctesiphon over the dioceses of Beth Aramaye does not seem to have been challenged. The Nestorian patriarch Hnanisho ø II (773‚Äì80) moved the patriarchal seat to Baghdad, the capital of the Abbasid Caliphate. This move did not affect the patriarchal title. The patriarchs of the Church of the East remained bishops of Seleucia-Ctesiphon, as they do to this day, and the diocese of Seleucia-Ctesiphon remained the metropolitan diocese of the province of the patriarch.  The diocese of Kashkar  According to legend, the diocese of Kashkar was the oldest diocese in Persia. It was said to have been founded by the apostle Mari in the first century, several decades before the establishment of a diocese in the Persian capital Seleucia-Ctesiphon.Mari, 5 (Arabic) (ed. Gismondi) Although a first-century foundation date is highly unlikely, the diocese of Kashkar was certainly one of the oldest dioceses of the Church of the East. The antiquity of the diocese and its claim to an apostolic foundation were recognised at the synod of Isaac in 410, when it was ranked second after the patriarchal diocese of Seleucia-Ctesiphon and its bishop was appointed guardian of the patriarchal throne (natar kursya).Chabot, 272 The earliest-known bishop of Kashkar was  øAbdisho ø, who was one of several Persian bishops who opposed the claim to precedence put forward by the bishop Papa of Seleucia-Ctesiphon in 315.Chronicle of Seert, i. 26 The last-known bishop of Kashkar was Sabrisho ø, who was transferred from the diocese of Qaimar to Kashkar by the patriarch Eliya III (1176‚Äì90).Sliba, 111 (Arabic) By 1222 the guardianship of the vacant patriarchal throne, for centuries a privilege of the bishops of Kashkar, was in the hands of the metropolitans of Beth Huzaye.Wilmshurst, The Martyred Church, 34‚Äì5, 116‚Äì17, 159‚Äì60 and 214 The diocese of Hirta The East Syrian diocese of Hirta (Arabic: al-Hira, ÿßŸÑÿ≠Ÿäÿ±ÿ©) is first attested in 410, but may have been a fourth-century foundation. Its last-known bishop, Yohannan Bar Nazuk, became patriarch in 1012. The bishop Hosea of Hirta was among the signatories of the acts of the synod of Isaac in 410.Chabot, 275 The bishop Shem øon of 'Hirta d'Tayyaye' ('Hirta of the Arabs') was among the signatories of the acts of the synod of Dadisho ø in 424.Chabot, 285 The bishop Shem øon of Hirta was among the signatories of the acts of the synod of Acacius in 486.Chabot, 306 The bishop Eliya of Hirta was among the signatories of the acts of the synod of Baba√Ø in 497.Chabot, 315 The bishop Joseph of Hirta was among the signatories of the acts of the synod of Isho øyahb I in 585.Chabot, 423 The bishop Sabrisho ø of Hirta flourished in the reign of the patriarch Gregory (605‚Äì9).

In the patriarchal election of 731 he refused to stand himself, and transferred his support to the bishop Aba of Kashkar (the future patriarch Aba II).Mari, 66 (Arabic), 58 (Latin) In 741 he arranged a welcome for the newly elected patriarch Aba II in Hirta.Mari, 66‚Äì7 (Arabic), 58‚Äì9 (Latin) The bishop Joel of Hirta was among the signatories of the acts of the synod of Timothy I in 790.Chabot, 607 The bishop Hnanisho ø Bar Saroshwai of Hirta flourished at the beginning of the ninth century. He was the author of a lost lexicon, whose contents were incorporated almost entire into the more famous tenth-century lexicon of Abu'l Hassan Bar Bahlul.Wright, A Short History of Syriac Literature, 228 The bishop Joseph of al-Hira (Hirta) was appointed metropolitan of Maishan during the reign of the patriarch Mari (987‚Äì99).Sliba, 94 (Arabic) The patriarch Yohannan VI Bar Nazuk was bishop of Hirta before his consecration as patriarch on 19 November 1012.Elijah of Nisibis, Chronography, i. 35.

The bishop Shem øon of Piroz Shabur was among the signatories of the acts of the synod of Gregory in 605. The future patriarch Sliba-zkha (714‚Äì28) was appointed bishop of al-Anbar during the reign of the patriarch Hnanisho ø I (686‚Äì700) and ejected by the anti-patriarch Yohannan Garba. He later became metropolitan of Mosul.Mari, 65 (Arabic), 57 (Latin) The bishop Yohannan of Piroz Shabur was among the signatories of the acts of the synod of Timothy I in 790.

He remained its bishop until his consecration as patriarch on 13 December 884.Elijah of Nisibis, Chronography, i. 89. In 921/2 the bishop Eliya of Piroz Shabur 'confessed his sin before the patriarch Abraham and stated in a written confession that he had sinned and erred in holding that Our Lord had not eaten the bread which he blessed and broke and gave to the disciples on the day of the Passover'.Elijah of Nisibis, Chronography, i. 97. The bishop Sabrisho ø of Piroz Shabur (al-Anbar) was appointed metropolitan of  øIlam during the reign of the patriarch Mari (987‚Äì99). The bishop Eliya, metropolitan of Mosul (Athor) when Elijah of Nisibis completed his Chronography in 1018/9, was originally bishop of Piroz Shabur and later metropolitan of Damascus. The bishop Mundhar of al-Anbar was present at the consecration of the patriarch Eliya I in 1028. The bishop Mari ibn  øAus of 'Radhan' was transferred to the diocese of Anbar by the patriarch Sabrisho ø III shortly after his consecration in 1063/4.Mari, 125 (Arabic), 110 (Latin) He was present at the consecration of the patriarch  øAbdisho ø II (1074‚Äì90) in 1074, and died at an unknown date during his reign.Mari, 130‚Äì1 (Arabic), 114‚Äì15 (Latin) The diocese of Karme The bishop Daniel of Karme was among the signatories of the acts of the synod of Acacius in 486, and his priest and secretary Aba signed the acts of the synod of Babai in 497 on his behalf.Chabot, 307 and 316 The diocese of Tirhan The Nestorian diocese of Tirhan was founded in the sixth century, probably to counter the influence of the important Jacobite centre of Tagrit. The first-known bishop of Tirhan, Bar Nun, was among the signatories of the acts of the synod of Aba I in 544. The Tirhan district lay to the southwest of Beth Garmai, and included the triangle of land between the Jabal Hamrin (known to the Nestorians as the mountain of Uruk) and the Tigris and Diyala rivers. Its chief town was Gbilta. The diocese of Tirhan was probably included in the province of the patriarch instead of the province of Beth Garmai because Seleucia-Ctesiphon was closer to Gbilta than Kirkuk (the metropolitan seat of Beth Garmai), and could be conveniently reached by water. The bishop Sliba-zkha of Tirhan, who flourished during the reign of the patriarch Ya øqob II (753‚Äì73), secured permission from the Jacobite authorities for the construction of a Nestorian church in Tagrit, in return for the restoration to the Jacobites of a church in Nisibis that had earlier been confiscated by the Nestorians. The last-known bishop of Tirhan, Shem øon, subscribed to the acts of the synod of Timothy II in 1318. (The Nestorian author Sliba ibn Yuhanna, who flourished around the middle of the fourteenth century, was wrongly claimed by Assemani as a bishop of Tirhan.) The diocese probably lapsed around the middle of the fourteenth century, and is certainly unlikely to have survived into the fifteenth century. The centuries-old status of Tagrit as the residence of the Jacobite maphrians was ended in 1393, when the town was destroyed by Timur Leng. Timur's troops also devastated the Tirhan district. These campaigns scattered the surviving Christian communities in Tirhan, and there are no later references to either Nestorian or Jacobite Christians in the district.

These sources mention several East Syrian monasteries and churches in or near Baghdad used as residences by the East Syrian patriarchs at different periods, and the relevant references have been conveniently collected by the French scholar J. M. Fiey, who also precisely localised most of the sites concerned. The patriarchal residences included the monastery of Klilisho ø, also called 'the patriarchal monastery' (Dair al-Jathaliq), residence and burial place of the patriarch Timothy I (780‚Äì823) and several of his ninth- century successors; the monastery of Mar Pethion, residence of the patriarch Sabrisho ø II (831‚Äì5); the church of Asbagh in the al-Shammasiya quarter, residence and burial place of the patriarch Yohannan II Bar Narsa√Ø (884‚Äì91); the nearby 'Greek Palace' (Darta d'Romaye, Dar al-Rum), residence and burial place of sixteen of the seventeen patriarchs from Yohannan III (893‚Äì9) to Eliya II (1111‚Äì32); the monastery of  øAbdon to the north of Baghdad, burial place of the patriarch Abraham III (906‚Äì37); the church of Mar Sabrisho ø in the Suq al-Thalatha quarter, burial place of the patriarchs Bar Sawma (1134‚Äì6), Isho øyahb V (1149‚Äì75) and Eliya III (1176‚Äì90); the church of Mart Maryam of Karkh, residence and burial place of the patriarchs Yahballaha II (1190‚Äì1222), Sabrisho ø IV (1222‚Äì4) and Sabrisho ø V (1226‚Äì56); and the palace of Duwaidar  øAla al-Din, burial place of the patriarchs Makkikha II (1257‚Äì65) and Denha I (1265‚Äì81).Fiey, ‚ÄòR√©sidences et s√©pultures‚Äô, passim Makkikha II was the last East Syrian patriarch to reside permanently in Baghdad. Baghdad's Christian population was spared by the Mongols when the city was captured and sacked in 1259, but the Mongol defeat at  øAin Jalut in 1261 was followed by a Moslem reaction against the Christians of the caliphate. There were violent Moslem demonstrations in 1268 and 1269 in Baghdad, which forced the patriarch Denha I, consecrated in Baghdad in 1265, to withdraw first to Erbil and finally to Eshnuq. He died quite by chance in Baghdad in 1281, during his first visit to the city for sixteen years, and was probably the last East Syrian patriarch to be buried there. His successor Yahballaha III was consecrated in Baghdad in 1281, but also avoided the city for much of his reign, preferring to reside first in Eshnuq and finally in Maragha. However, a poem written in Karamlish in 1295 mentions that he restored the chapels and apartments in the Greek Palace, probably during the reign of the sympathetic il-khan Arghun, and built a 'very beautiful gallery for counsel, recreation, and the reunions of the fathers'. The accession of the il-khan Ghazan in 1295 was followed immediately by a persecution of Christians in Baghdad and several other cities, in which a number of churches were confiscated. In Baghdad most churches were spared in return for bribes, but a new church built by Makkikha II was confiscated and turned into a mosque. The Moslems also recovered the palace of Duwaidar  øAla al-Din, which had been taken from them and given to Makkikha II by Hulegu after the city's capture in 1259, and required the East Syrians to remove for reburial elsewhere the remains of the patriarchs Makkikha II and Denha I and other prominent clerics and monks buried there. Yahballaha III does not appear to have revisited Baghdad after these events, and after his death in 1317 was buried in Maragha. References Citations Bibliography * Abbeloos, J. B., and Lamy, T.

She completed her undergraduate studies at the University of California, Berkeley, her doctoral dissertation at Yale, and studied as a fellow at Oxford. After teaching at the University of Idaho, the Lewiston State Normal School, and with the Extension Division of the University of California, Reinhardt was elected president of Mills College in 1916, and held the position until 1943, making her the longest serving president in the history of the school. Reinhardt was a peace activist during the First World War, an active member of the Republican Party, and supported the ratification of the Treaty of Versailles as well as the formation of the League of Nations. She wrote and spoke extensively throughout the US and Europe, to a range of social, political and business groups, on topics including the education of women, women's suffrage, world peace, and international cooperation. Reinhardt was president of the American Association of University Women, and a prominent member of the American Unitarian Association, serving for two years as its first female moderator. As the only female member of the Unitarian Commission of Appraisal, she delivered the Ware Lecture in 1932, and was briefly a minister in Oakland, California. She was a director of the Starr King School for the Ministry, and was a delegate at the inaugural meeting of the United Nations in 1945. Aurelia Henry Reinhardt was married to George F. Reinhardt in 1909. They had two sons, who she raised after his unexpected death in 1914. Following her retirement in 1943, she traveled internationally before returning to California, where she died on January 28, 1948, due to heart problems. A lifelong advocate for the marginalized and dispossessed, she was the recipient of honorary degrees from a number of educational institutions, and has been commemorated through the establishment of a society, fellowship, a university building, and a professorship bearing her name. She was named nationally as \\"one of the ten outstanding women of 1940,\\" and honored as the California State Mother in 1946. Early life Aurelia Isabel Henry was born on April 1, 1877, in San Francisco, California. The second of six children, she was the daughter of Mary and William Warner Henry, a wholesale grocer, land owner, and businessman. She spent part of her childhood in San Jacinto and Escondido, California. After graduating from Boys High School in San Francisco in 1888, she studied at the University of California, Berkeley, completing a bachelor's degree with a major in English literature in 1898. While attending the University of California she, along with her sisters, worked with their mother who ran a boardinghouse in Berkeley. Henry then taught elocution and physical culture at the University of Idaho from 1898 to 1901. She completed a Ph.D. in literature at Yale in 1905 with a doctoral dissertation on Epicoene, or the Silent Woman by Ben Jonson. She taught at Lewiston State Normal School in Idaho beginning in 1903, taking one year off to revise her dissertation for publication, and eventually becoming the head of the English Department. She traveled abroad as a recipient of an Association of Collegiate Alumnae Fellowship, studied as a fellow at the University of Oxford, traveled Italy, and published an English language translation of De Monarchia by Dante Alighieri. She then returned to teaching in Idaho for another three years. By 1908 her brother Paul had fallen ill, and she left her teaching position to care for him in Arizona, until his death in 1909. While there, she met and began a relationship with Paul's doctor, George F. Reinhardt, professor of hygiene, founder and director of the student health service at the University of California, Berkeley, and member of the California Board of Medical Examiners. The two were wed in 1909, in a ceremony at the Unitarian Universalist Church of Berkeley. He later died unexpectedly in 1914, following an \\"operation for a minor affliction\\" and four days of illness. They had two sons, who Aurelia Henry Reinhardt cared for alone following her husband's death. Career In 1914 Reinhardt became a lecturer in English in the Extension Division of the University of California. She was a member of the Town and Gown Club of Berkeley, Prytancan and English Club of the University of California, Phi Beta Kappa, the Dante Society of America, and Concordance Society of America. After two years of teaching she was appointed president of the then-struggling Mills College in Oakland, California, at that time the only women's college on the West Coast and the second oldest women's college in the country. Reinhardt succeeded acting president Hettie Belle Ege, who remained on the Mills faculty until 1930.\\"Hettie Ege, Dean Emeritus of Mills, Dies in Sleep\\" Oakland Tribune (November 20, 1942): 25. Retrieved September 21, 2019, from Newspapers.com. Arriving with her two young children, Reinhardt is said to have remarked that she was \\"the first college president who arrived on campus pushing a perambulator\\". There she served from 1916 to 1943, through a period of substantial growth, making her the longest serving president in the institution's history. During her tenure Mills constructed 17 additional buildings (growing from 11 to 28 total), increased enrollment three-fold in 15 years, and \\"gained national, even worldwide favor\\", including admission to the Association of American Colleges and Universities in 1917. Reinhardt was active in local, national, and international organizations, lecturing and writing on topics including international cooperation, suffrage, and women's rights. In 1919 she served the Oakland Chamber of Commerce as chair of the City Planning Committee, and she was regularly invited to speak at a range of organizations, such as the Retail Furniture Association of California, the Western Fruit Jobbers Association, the San Francisco Chamber of Commerce, and the Advertising Club of Los Angeles. Starting in the First World War, Reinhardt worked as an advocate for world peace. She supported Democratic President Woodrow Wilson's proposal to create the League of Nations, despite herself being active in the Republican Party. In 1919 she traveled as a delegate to Tokyo for the meeting of the Institute of Pacific Relations, and in 1920 to Washington, D.C., to deliver a petition of 30,000 signatures from Californians urging the ratification of the Treaty of Versailles to end the war. In total, she was a member of more than a dozen peace organizations over the course of her career. Reinhardt, c. 1919 In 1922 Reinhardt traveled again to Oxford and then to France as a representative of the American Association of University Women. She served as vice president, and then in 1923, president of the Association, a position she held until 1927, helping to strengthen that organization significantly. In 1928 she was a Republican elector from California, and opponent of Franklin D. Roosevelt's New Deal. She continued her work with the Association of University Women into the 1930s, as chair of their Committee on International Relations from 1927 to 1933, also held the chair for the General Federation of Women's Clubs in their Department of Education from 1928 to 1930. Then, during the 1936 presidential election, traveled as a delegate to the Republican National Convention. In 1929 she again traveled to Japan in the interest of the Institute of Pacific Relations, this time meeting in Kyoto. Reinhardt was a devoted and active Unitarian throughout her life. In the 1940s she served as the first female moderator of the American Unitarian Association from 1940 to 1942, which according to contemporary news reports was the first time a large church in the nation had been represented by a woman. Reinhardt served briefly as a minister at the First Unitarian Church of Oakland and delivered the Ware Lecture at the May 1932 meeting of the American Unitarian Association. She also served for a decade on the board of directors at the Starr King School for the Ministry. Reinhardt was the only woman member of the Unitarian Commission of Appraisal, commissioned to \\"study the church and find new directions for its re invigoration\\". In 1945 Reinhardt was a delegate to the inaugural meeting of the United Nations in San Francisco, and spoke to numerous groups throughout the country, advocating for the value of organizations such as UNESCO. Throughout her life, Reinhardt \\"invariably took the side of those individuals who had no resources, who lacked adequate support, or who had in some other way been marginalized by society.\\" She has also been described as an \\"avid nature lover\\", and advocated variously for environmental preservation efforts, and against unchecked and reckless development. Later life and death Following her retirement as president of Mills College in 1943, Reinhardt traveled in Latin America, Europe, and finally Russia before returning to California. She died on January 28, 1948, in Palo Alto, California, from heart problems. Her ashes are interred at the Columbarium in Oakland. Her eldest son, G. Frederick Reinhardt, was a diplomat. His brother Paul Henry Reinhardt, an ophthalmologist in Palo Alto, served with the U.S. Navy in the Pacific Theater of the Second World War and later taught ophthalmology at Stanford University. Recognition and commemoration Reinhardt in academic regalia from a 1922 publication Reinhardt was the recipient of multiple honorary degrees, including from: * The University of California (1919) * The University of Southern California (1924) * Colorado College (1931) * Williams College (1937) * Mount Holyoke College (1937) * Oberlin College (1937) Mills College hosts the namesake Aurelia Henry Reinhardt Society, which recognizes those who financially support the college through a bequest or other charitable gift, as well as the Aurelia Henry Reinhardt Faculty Purse, awarded to seniors to support post-graduate study. The school's campus also includes the Aurelia Henry Reinhardt Alumnae House, designed by architect Clarence W. W. Mayhew and built in 1949. The Aurelia Henry Reinhardt Fellowship was established in 1940 with fundraising from the South Pacific section of the American Association of University Women and is offered annually to distinguished women scholars. In 1981 the Starr King School for the Ministry introduced the Aurelia Henry Reinhardt Professorship, in order to \\"ensure a feminist perspective on the faculty\\". The archives at Mills College hosts the Reinhardt Collection, a compilation of texts related to \\"women, with a strength in women‚Äôs suffrage, birth control, and social issues\\", and the school also includes the student run Aurelia Reinhardt Historical Society, established to \\"inspire an appreciation of the history of the Mills community\\". Reinhardt was named \\"one of the ten outstanding women of 1940\\" by the publication American Women. She was also selected as the California State Mother in 1946, by the American Mothers Committee of the Golden Rule Foundation. In 2019, the Redwood Regional Park in the San Francisco Bay Area was renamed Dr. Aurelia Reinhardt Redwood Regional Park in honor of her efforts in helping to establish the East Bay Regional Park District.

He served as interim chancellor of the Nevada System of Higher Education and the University of Arizona College of Law carried his name. Biography Early life and education Rogers was a 1956 graduate of Las Vegas High School. He had degrees in accounting (B.S.) and law (LL.B.) from the University of Arizona and a Master of Laws (LL.M.) from the University of Southern California. He was a teaching fellow in the law school of the University of Illinois in 1963 and 1964. In 1998 he was awarded a Doctor of Laws (LL.D.) from the University of Arizona. Rogers holds honorary doctorates from University of Arizona, Idaho State University, Kentucky Wesleyan College, Carroll College and University of Nevada, Las Vegas. He was also a member of the State Bar Associations of Nevada, Arizona and California. Career He was the founder of Valley Broadcasting Company in 1971 and had served as the company's chief executive officer from 1979 to 2014 on KVBC-TV (now KSNV), the NBC affiliate in Las Vegas, The station went on the air as KLRJ-TV on channel 2 on January 23, 1955, licensed to Henderson and owned by the Donrey Media Group (now Stephens Media LLC) along with the Las Vegas Review-Journal and KORK radio (920 AM; now KBAD). Soon after, the station changed its calls to KORK-TV, matching its radio sister, and moved its license and studios to Las Vegas. The station became a primary affiliate of NBC, but carried other networks as well. During the late 1950s, the station was also briefly affiliated with the NTA Film Network. In 1967, KORK-TV moved to channel 3 to avoid interference with newly signed-on KTVN in Reno, Nevada. From 1971 onward, a group of local residents led by Las Vegas attorney James E. \\"Jim\\" Rogers made an effort to take control of KORK. The group gained further momentum in the late 1970s after Donrey began heavily preempting NBC programming in order to sell more local advertising, though NBC was far less tolerant of this than the other networks at the time. The most notable of these preemptions was the 1978 World Series, angering both NBC and several Las Vegas area viewers, some of whom complained to the Federal Communications Commission. Facing pressure from both NBC and the FCC, Donrey was forced to sell the station to the Rogers group's holding company, Valley Broadcasting Company, in 1979. Donrey retained KORK radio, and as a result on October 1, 1979 the station became KVBC, reflecting the new ownership. Since then, the station has more or less cleared the whole NBC lineup. Rogers owns 98% of the stock of Sunbelt Communications Company (now Intermountain West Communications Company), which owns and operates the NBC affiliate television stations in Las Vegas, Reno and Elko, Nevada; Yuma, Arizona-El Centro, California; Helena, Montana; Pocatello-Idaho Falls, Idaho; Casper, Wyoming; and the Fox affiliate in Twin Falls, Idaho. Rogers was in active law practice in Las Vegas from 1964 through 1988, at which time he ceased practicing to devote 100% of his time to the development of the television and radio stations of Sunbelt. Rogers became a member of the Board of Directors of Nevada National Bank in 1981 (the third largest bank in Nevada), served as a member of the bank's Loan Committee for ten years and was chairman of the board from 1985 to 1987. He was involved in the purchase of Nevada National Bank by Security Pacific Bank of California in 1989, and served on the board of directors of Security Pacific Bank, Nevada until it was purchased by Bank of America. He was a founder and served on the board of directors of Community Bank of Nevada, and was chairman of its Loan Committee until he left that bank to form Nevada First Bank in 1998. He is a founder and presently serves as the chairman of the board of Nevada First Bank. Rogers was appointed by the Board of Regents to serve as the UCCSN's Interim Chancellor on May 7, 2004. Philanthropic activity An active supporter of education, he and his wife, Beverly, have made substantial financial contributions to various colleges and universities. Their gift to the University of Arizona College of Law totaled $115 million. In November 1998, the Arizona Board of Regents renamed the University of Arizona college of Law James E. Rogers College of Law. Active in all the communities in which Sunbelt has television stations, Rogers serves as a member of the Dean's Advisory Council of the University of Nevada, Engineering College in Reno, Nevada (to which he has given or pledged $750,000); is a member of the Dean's Council of the UNLV College of Law in Las Vegas (to which he has given or pledged $28,500,000); and is a member and President-Elect of the Idaho State University Foundation in Pocatello, Idaho (to which he has given or pledged $20 million). Sunbelt has constructed a building on the campus of Great Basin Community College in Elko, Nevada at a cost to Sunbelt of approximately $1.25 million. This building houses an NBC station and a classroom for teaching communications. Marriage and children He was married to Beverly Barlow. Jim Rogers had 3 children from a previous marriage: Suzanne Rogers Plant, Kimberly Rogers Cell, and Perry Rogers; and eight grandchildren. He announced in early 2014 that when he died (June 14, 2014), his wife, Beverly, would take over ownership of the television stations. The flagship station was later sold to Sinclair Broadcast Group which effectively made Intermountain West Communications Company as a defunct company.

It is double tracked, has an island platform layout, and is 30.4 km from Wellington railway station, the southern terminus of the NIMT. It is one of two railway stations in Pukerua Bay, the other one at Muri being closed.  Services  Pukerua Bay is the fourth station north of Porirua on the Kapiti Line for commuter trains operated by Transdev Wellington under the Metlink brand contracted to the Greater Wellington Regional Council. Services between Wellington and Porirua or Waikanae are operated by electric multiple units of the FT/FP class (Matangi). Two diesel-hauled carriage trains, the Capital Connection and the Northern Explorer, pass through the station but do not stop. All suburban services running between Wellington and Waikanae stop at Pukerua Bay. Off-peak trains stop at all stations between Wellington and Waikanae. During peak periods, some trains from Wellington that stop at all stations may terminate at Porirua or Plimmerton and return to Wellington while a number of peak services run express or non-stop between Wellington and Porirua before stopping at all stations from Porirua to Waikanae. Travel times by train are twenty-four minutes to Waikanae, fifteen minutes to Porirua, thirty-six minutes to Wellington for trains stopping at all stations, and thirty-two minutes for express trains that do not stop between Porirua and Wellington. Trains run every twenty minutes during daytime off-peak hours, more frequently during peak periods, and less frequently at night.metlink Before July 2018, off-peak passenger train services between Wellington and Waikanae ran every thirty minutesmetlink Kapiti Train Line timetable effective from 20 January 2016 but were increased to one every twenty minutes from 15 July 2018. The commuter trains were formerly of the DM/D class or EM/ET class.  History  The line through Pukerua Bay was originally part of the Wellington - Manawatu Line, built by the Wellington and Manawatu Railway Company (W&MR;). The W&MR; was a private railway built as an alternative to the government's Wairarapa Line. The railway from Plimmerton to Pukerua Bay was constructed during 1885 under the no. 12 or \\"Pukerua\\" contract. Pukerua Bay railway station was opened on Christmas Day 1885, while the full line to Longburn was completed in November 1886. Following the completion of the railway line between Pukerua Bay and PaekƒÅkƒÅriki, the train station was called Pukerua. For a short time between 1919 and 1921, the train station was called Waimapihi, named after the Waimapihi block of land most of Pukerua Bay was situated in. In 1923, the station was renamed to Pukerua Bay to distinguish it from the South Island station Pukerau. From the 1920s onwards, Pukerua Bay station was a popular destination for weekend visitors from Wellington, with a road from the train station to the beach opened in 1926, well before the road into Pukerua Bay from Plimmerton. At one time a short service siding with trailing crossover on the down side was used to allow (steam) banking engines from PaekƒÅkƒÅriki to return down the bank. The station building once had a long drop, and three other buildings next to the siding. Sheep were driven along the now restored path through the bush at the bottom of Seavista Drive, to be loaded onto wagons at the station. Once double-tracking of the railway line from Wellington was completed, the original station building was replaced in 1940 with the current island platform. The station's platform upgrade in 2010 raised platform height, bringing it into line with other stations on the network and added safety features such as yellow tactile strips and put electrical ducting in place to support a real-time passenger information system later introduced by the Greater Wellington Regional Council.

However, the white gate forming the entrance to the property can be seen from the road. History 19th century It was built in 1828 for Benjamin Sampson, born in 1770, who was originally a bal carpenter (i.e. carpenter at a mine) and became founder of the gunpowder works at Kennall Vale. He also held the post of Manager and shareholder in the Perran Foundry, and was an adventurer in Tresavean Mine, from which he derived a large fortune. He had Tullimaar built and resided there until his death 12 years later in 1840. He was buried at Gwennap.In his book, Cornish Explosives, (2nd edition, 2006) pages 33-34, Bryan Earl asserts that the gunpowder works was a subsidiary of the Fox family's Perran Foundry. In the Journal of the Trevithick Society, Volume 28: 2001. Ken Sampson has challenged this assertion and made it clear that Benjamin Sampson was the principal share-holder.(\\"Benjamin Sampson 1770-1840\\"; p. 31-36.) The house has been the home of many distinguished residents or guests including Sarah Parkin widow of Dr. Henry Parkin, RN, Inspector-General of Hospitals and Fleets, and illegitimate child of one of the daughters of George III, who spent her last years there. Mother of Caroline (later Mrs F Hearle-Cock). The 1861 census shows that the house was occupied by William Henry Lanyon, manager of Kennall Vale. In 1870 the Rev. Francis Kilvert spent nearly 3 weeks on holiday at Tullimaar with his friends Mr and Mrs William Hockin.From 20 July to 6 August 1870, Francis Kilvert stayed with the family of William Hockin at Tullimaar: Source: Kilvert, Francis (1989) Kilvert's Cornish Diary; edited by Richard Maber and Angela Tregoning. Penzance: Alison Hodge . In the 1891 census, it was occupied by Francis Hearle Cock, solicitor, and his family. His two nieces, Mabile Mary Arundell and Katherine Mary Arundell, the granddaughters of Baron Arundell of Wardour, also lived there.Cornwall online census project - 1891 census - Transcript of Piece RG12/1833 (Part 2). 20th century Tullimaar was inhabited until at least 1918 by the Hearle-Cocks, when Francis Hearle-Cock's widow, Caroline, died. It was, presumably, inherited by her only child and heir, Catherine. Tullimaar was later occupied by American troops during the latter part of World War II and U.S. General Dwight D. Eisenhower stayed at the house for two weeks in the run-up to D-Day in 1944. These troops brought all their stores with them and when they eventually left on D-Day, all the packing cases, some of which were not even opened, were dumped in Rosemanowes Quarry. In the central east room of the house there is a commemorative brass plaque with the wording 'A shot was fired through this window by a sentry Running Amok 1944'. It is reported that the incident occurred whilst Eisenhower was using the house as his personal headquarters. Marthe Bibesco, the Franco-Romanian writer, lived here, after purchasing Tullimaar in 1957 until 1973. She had a plaque placed in the hall stating that the Normandy landings had been planned by General Eisenhower while staying in the house during 1944. Doubt was cast on this by local historians and later owners covered the plaque (which still exists) with a wall hanging. However it was subsequently confirmed that Eisenhower and Winston Churchill had met at Tullimaar for discussions prior to D-Day. In recent years the house was home to Nobel Prize-winning novelist Sir William Golding who lived at Tullimaar with his wife Ann Brookfield from 1985 until his death thereThe writer D. M. Thomas describes an evening spent at Tullimaar a few hours before Golding's death: The Guardian, Saturday 10 June 2006 in June 1993. He described it as \\"a devastatingly beautiful house in the middle of a flowering wilderness\\" and drafted several of his novels while living there. Golding and his wife Ann selected Tullimaar because of the privacy from unwelcome fan attention provided by its relatively remote location and the surrounding woodlands. The house was later occupied by David Golding, William's son, born in 1940. Description Tullimaar (\\"House on the Hill\\") is set in a parkland of five acres of woods and gardens. It includes a gardener's lodge and a separate cottage. William Golding devoted much of his final years to clearing a large walled garden located to the south of the house from overgrowth, substituting rows of apple trees. The mansion itself features a succession of tall windows on both floors, reaching almost to each floor.

Throughout history, various endonyms and exonyms have been used in reference to ethnic Serbs and their lands. Basic terms, used in Serbian language, were introduced via classical languages (Greek and Latin) into other languages, including English. The process of interlingual transmission began during the early medieval period, and continued up to the modern times, being finalized in major international languages at the beginning of the 20th century. Etymology The ethnonym is mentioned in the Middle Ages as Cervetiis (Servetiis), gentis (S)urbiorum, Suurbi, Sorabi, Soraborum, Sorabos, Surpe, Sorabici, Sorabiet, Sarbin, Swrbjn, Servians, Sorbi, Sirbia, Sribia, Zirbia, Zribia, Suurbelant, Surbia, Serbulia / Sorbulia among others. There exist two prevailing theories on the origin of the ethnonym *S≈ïb—ä (plur. *S≈ïby), one from a Proto-Slavic language and another from an Iranian-Sarmatian language. Other derivations like from Old Indic sarbh- (\\"fight, cut, kill\\"), Latin sero (\\"make up, constitute\\"), and Greek siro (ŒµŒπœÅœâ, \\"repeat\\") are considered as unreliable. *The most prevailing theory considers it of Proto-Slavic origin. According to Hanna Popowska-Taborska, who also argued native Slavic provenance of the ethnonym, the theory advances a conclusion that the ethnonym has a meaning of a family kinship or alliance, and it is argued by Pavel Jozef ≈†af√°rik, Josef Perwolf, Aleksander Br√ºckner, Franz Miklosich, Jan Otrƒôbski, Heinz Schuster-≈†ewc, Grigoriƒ≠ Andreevich Il πinskiƒ≠, J. J. Mikkola, Max Vasmer, Franciszek S≈Çawski among others. German-Sorbian scholar Schuster-≈†ewc listed the *sr—äb- / *s—årb- roots in Slavic words meaning \\"to sip, munch\\", found in Polish s(i)erbaƒá, Russian —Å–µ—Ä–±–∞—Ç—å, etc., and also cognates in non-Slavic languages, such as Lithuanian su≈ôbti, Middle German s√ºrfen, which all derive from Indo-European onomatopoeic roots *serbh- / *sirbh- / *surbh- meaning \\"to sip, to breast-feed, to flow\\". According to him, the basis of the ethnonym lays in \\"kinship by milk\\" and \\"brotherhood in milk\\" which was widespread in early ethnic groups (between both relatives and non-relatives) and thus carried the secondary meanings of \\"those who belong to the same family, kinsman\\"; \\"member of the same kin, tribe\\"; and finally an ethnonym (name of a people, nation). According to Vasmer's etymological dictionary, the root *s—ärb—ä is most probably connected with Russian paserb (–ø–∞—Å–µ—Ä–±, \\"stepson\\") and Ukrainian priserbitisya (–ø—Ä–∏—Å–µ—Ä–±–∏—Ç–∏—Å—è, \\"join in\\") in the meaning of \\"alliance\\". Zbigniew Go≈ÇƒÖb similarly derived it from Proto-Indo-European in the meaning of \\"outgrowth, member of the family\\". Stanis≈Çaw Rospond derived the denomination of Srb from srbati (cf. sorbo, absorbo), and Proto-Indo- European base *serp≈ÇynƒÖƒá as a possible reference to the humid areas inhabited by the same people, which was also argued by Stanis≈Çaw Kozierowski. *Another theory considers it of Iranian origin., pp. 404-406 Oleg Trubachyov derived it from Indo-Aryan *sar- (head) and *bai- (to hit), or assumed Scythian form *serv that in Old Indian sarva has a meaning of \\"all\\" which has a semantic analogy in Germanic Alemanni. There are also those like J. Nalepa who related the ethnonym of the Serbs and Croats, and Kazimierz Moszy≈Ñski derived Slavic s—årb—ä and Serboi (Œ£Œ≠œÅŒ≤ŒøŒπ) from Indo-European *ser-v- (to protect) which had an equivalent in classical Scythian language, *—Ö–∞rv-, from which presumably derived the Slavic ethnonym *—Ö·πõvati (Croats). However, this theory is rejected by Ukrainian scholars, and Russian linguists like Vyacheslav Ivanov and Vladimir Toporov, because the Serbs were unrelated to the East Slavs as well the origin and meaning of the Serbian ethnonym in the scholarship is deemed as clear and distant from the Croatian ethnonym. Endonym The earliest found mention of the Serbs in the Balkans is from Einhard's Royal Frankish Annals, written in 822, when prince Ljudevit went from his seat at Sisak to the Serbs (believed to have been somewhere in western Bosnia), with Einhard mentioning \\"the Serbs, a people that is said to hold a large part of Dalmatia\\" (lat. ad Sorabos, quae natio magnam Dalmatiae partem obtinere dicitur). De Administrando Imperio, written by Byzantine emperor Constantine VII in the mid-10th century, tells of the early history of the Serbs. He mentions White Serbia (or Boiki) from where migrated the White Serbs. Furthermore, the emperor wrote that their name in the tongue of the Romans means a \\"servant\\" because of which the \\"serbula\\" means menial shoes while \\"tzerboulianoi\\" for those who wear poor man's footwear, and that the region or town of Servia (Serblia) near Thessaloniki received its name from the Serbs who once lived there, but this derivation is a paraetymology as well as account's reliability is disputable. Some scholars argue that the Serb ethnonym is antique. According to this theory, it is connected to the mentions of Tacitus in 50 AD, Pliny the Elder in 77 AD (Naturalis Historia) and Ptolemy in his Geography 2nd century AD, of the Sarmatian tribe of Serboi of the North Caucasus and Lower Volga. ƒêorƒëe Brankoviƒá (1645‚Äì1711), in his Chronicles, wrote: \\"The Serbian name comes from the Savromat name, as Philipp Melanchthon testifies... According to a second version the Serbian name comes from the Sires people who used to live in the Asian part of Scythia. Among the Sires, wool grew in the same way as silk\\". In 1878, Henry Hoyle Howorth connected Ptolemy's mention of the town of Serbinum (Œ£Œ≠œÅŒ≤ŒπŒΩŒøŒΩ), modern Gradi≈°ka, Bosnia and Herzegovina, to the Serbs, and also found the Serb ethnonym Cervetiis (Servetiis) in the works of Vibius Sequester.Howorth (1878), pp. 66-68 In De Bello Gothico Procopius (500-565) uses the name Sporoi as an umbrella term for the Slavic tribes of Antes and Sclaveni, it is however not known whether the Slavs used this designation for themselves or he himself coined the term. It has been theorized by the older generation of scholars that the name is a corruption of the ethnonym Serbs,Elements of Ethnic Identification of the Serbs. By Danijela Gavriloviƒá. Facta Universitatis. Series: Philosophy, Sociology and Psychology Vol. 2, n¬∞ 10, 2003, pp. 717 - 730. as Sporoi may be identical with 'Sorpi=Serpi=Serbi' and 'Sclavini'. Exonyms During the medieval and early modern period, several exonyms were used as designations for Serbs and Serbia. ;Rascia and Rasciani Since the late 12th century, the term \\"Rascia\\" (sr. –†–∞—à–∫–∞/Ra≈°ka), with several variants (Rasscia, Rassia, Rasia, Raxia), was used as an exonym for Serbia in Latin sources, along with other names such as Servia, Dalmatia and Slavonia. It was derived from the town of Ras, a royal estate, and seat of an eparchy. The first attestation is in a charter from Kotor dated to 1186, in which Stefan Nemanja, the Grand Prince (1166‚Äì1196), is mentioned as \\"≈æupan of Rascia\\". It was one of the common names for Serbia in western sources (Papacy, Italian, German, French, etc.), often in conjunction with Serbia (Servia et Rascia). \\"Rascia\\" was never used in Byzantine works. The term is often used in modern historiography to refer to the medieval \\"Serbian hinterland\\" or \\"inner Serbia\\", that is, the inland territories in relation to the maritime principalities at the Adriatic (the \\"Pomorje\\"). The term is attested since the late 12th century, but in historiography, the early medieval Serbian Principality is sometimes also called Ra≈°ka (Rascia), erroneously (and anachronistically). In DAI, the Serbian hinterland is called \\"baptized Serbia\\", while Ras is only mentioned as a border town. The misconceptions arose from the much later Chronicle of the Priest of Duklja, that projected later terminology on earlier periods. In historical reality of the early medieval period, the city of Ras became a local administrative center only in 970-975, when Byzantines created a short-lived Catepanate of Ras. In 1019, the Eparchy of Ras was organized, with jurisdiction over eastern parts of inner Serbia, and thus the foundation was laid for gradual emergence of a regional name, derived from Ras. Retaking the city of Ras from Byzantines, local Serbian rulers made it one of their main seats, and since it was also a seat of a local bishop of Ras, it gradually became the most important center of inner Serbia. By the end of the 12th century, term Ra≈°ka (Rascia) became common designation for central parts of inner Serbia, and it was also used to designate the state centered in that region, namely the Serbian state of the Nemanjiƒá dynasty. Between the 15th and 18th centuries, the term (, ) was used to designate the southern Pannonian Plain inhabited by Serbs, or \\"Rascians\\" (, ), who had settled there following the Ottoman conquests and Great Serb migrations. ;Other medieval exonyms *The Serbs were often called \\"Triballi\\" in Byzantine works. The Triballi was an ancient Thracian tribe that inhabited the area of the Morava Valley in southern Serbia. They were last mentioned in the 3rd century. The educated Byzantine authors sought an ancient name for the Serbs, and adopted it as the most likely. It was in use between the 11th and 15th century. *In the Byzantine chronicle Alexiad, covering the 11th century (written in 1148), Anna Komnene mentions the Serbs by the names Sklaveni and Dalmati (ŒîŒ±ŒªŒºŒ¨œÑŒ±Œπ, Dalmatai), with Dalmatia starting from Kosovo and Metohija.Anne Comnene, Alexiade (Regne de L'Empereur Alexis I Comnene 1081-1118) II, pp. l57:3-l6; 1.66: 25-169. Texte etabli er traduit par B. Leib t. I-III (Paris, 1937-1945). John Kinnamos, in his work covering 1118‚Äì76, wrote: \\"the Serbs, a Dalmatic (Dalmatian) tribe\\" (), thus using \\"Dalmat(ian)s\\" or \\"Dalmatic (Dalmatian) people\\" in the context of the Serbs, and \\"Dalmatia\\" in the context of Serbia. There are numerous other, less prominent, instances, poetic for example ‚Äî Theodore Prodromus, Michael Italicus and the typikon of the Pantokrator monastery, among others. ;Early modern exonyms *\\"Vlachs\\", referring to pastoralists, was a common exonym for Serbs in the Ottoman Empire and later. The term \\"Vlachs\\" was also used for Slavs who shared lifestyle (as shepherds) with Romance peoples (Vlachs); it was used for the Serbs who settled the Military Frontier. Documents from 13th to the 15th century show that Vlachs (descendants of indigenous peoples) Serbs considered as \\"others\\" i.e. different from themselves.Sima M. ƒÜirkoviƒá, SRBI MEƒêU EUROPSKIM NARODIMA,(Serbs) 2008. http://www.mo-vrebac- pavlovac.hr/attachments/article/451/Sima%20%C4%86irkovi%C4%87%20SRBI%20ME%C4%90U%20EVROPSKIM%20NARODIMA.pdf #page=5 Croatian nationalist historiography (including Ustashe propaganda) claim that the settlers were not Serbs, but ethnic Vlachs, thus implying that Serbs of Croatia are not Serbs. All South Slavic ethnic groups had some Romance ingredient, although there is no evidence that all or most Serbs in Croatia were of Vlach origin. In Bosnia, Orthodox Christians were called \\"Vlachs\\", actually used as a synonym of \\"Serbs\\". It was used as a derogatory term, and as a common name for Orthodox Serbs in Catholic lands, and lesser in the Ottoman Empire. Tihomir ƒêorƒëeviƒá (1868‚Äì1944), as did other academics, stressed that the name \\"Vlach\\" did not only refer to genuine Vlachs (Romance- speaking people), but also to cattle breeders in general. Serbs that took refuge in the Habsburg Military Frontier were called \\"Vlachs\\" by the Croats. In the work About the Vlachs (1806), Metropolitan Stevan Stratimiroviƒá stated that Roman Catholics from Croatia and Slavonia scornfully used the name \\"Vlach\\" for \\"the Slovenians (Slavs) and Serbs, who are of our, Eastern [Orthodox] confession\\", and that \\"the Turks (Muslims) in Bosnia and Serbia also call every Bosnian or Serbian Christian a Vlach\\".T. ƒêorƒëeviƒá, 1984:110 That the name \\"Vlach\\" used to signify the Serbs is testified by Vuk Karad≈æiƒá in his many recorded proverbs. The term may have originated from Stari Vlah, from where refugees arrived in what was then the Holy Roman Empire. *In Dalmatia, terms used for Serbs were: \\"Morlachs\\" (Morlaci), \\"Vlachs\\" (Vlasi), Rkaƒái,Andriƒá, Jasna. \\"Nadimak\\" Rkaƒá\\"(Rkaƒç).\\" Etnolo≈°ka tribina 18.11 (1988): 43-58. Rkaƒçi, \\"Greek Dalmatians\\" (Garƒçki Dalmatini), or \\"Greek people\\". The Catholics used the pejorative word rkaƒá, derived from Venetian, for Orthodox people. The terms Ri≈°ƒáani, Rkaƒái (Grkaƒái), Morlaci (crni Vlasi), were used for primitive shepherds, Serbs, who moved in Bukovica, and mountain pastures on the border of Lika (Velebit) and Bosnia (Dinara). *Illyrians (), or the Illyrian nation (): During the early modern period, Serbs were also referred to as Illyrians, most commonly by the state administration of the Habsburg Monarchy. Since the end of the 17th century, those archaic terms were used in a classicizing manner, as a historical reference for geographical position of Serbian homeland in regions that were formerly covered by the ancient Illyricum. Among official documents that used such terminology was the Declaratory Rescript of the Illyrian Nation (), issued in 1779 by Empress Maria Theresa in order to regulate several questions related to possition of the Serbian Orthodox Metropolitanate of Karlovci. Misnaming Because of a confusion of ethnicity/nationality with religious affiliation, many authors from historic times referred to and recorded Serbs by the following names: *by the major regional names of: Bosnians, Herzegovinians, Krajishniks and Slavonians.

There are 2 time slots conducted per week.KMBS website This MBA course is part-time, and is mainly aimed at ambitious working professionals, who can dedicate their time for this MBA after their work hours. One of the main advantages of this college is that only one subject is instructed at a time, so a good amount of concentration can be dedicated to a specific course. Assignments are done at the end of each course, either individually or in groups (depending on the instructors). There is a canteen within the campus. The campus also holds a modern library, entertainment area, prayer rooms, IT internet room and modern, well-equipped classrooms. They have a 3 month summer vacation during July, August and September. Because student numbers are restricted, KMBS provides an elite, personal atmosphere in which every student is given a high level of attention and service. KMBS has a well established relationship with the National Bank of Kuwait, who recruit some of the top students who graduate every year. A new sprawling campus was planned, to be built in the Fintas region.

In a common example, drivers of private vehicles may be allowed to drive, park, or purchase gasoline on alternating days, according to whether the last digit in their license plate is even or odd. Similarly, during a drought, houses can be restricted from using water outdoors according to the parity of the house number. Typically a day is \\"odd\\" or \\"even\\" depending on the day of the month. An issue with this approach is that two \\"odd\\" days in a row occur whenever a month ends on an odd-numbered day.Editorials on file (1979) Volume 10, Part 1 Sometimes odd or even may be based on day of the week, with Sundays excluded or included for everyone. Effectiveness Motorists with even-numbered licenses line up for gasoline on an even-numbered day, Portland, OR, 1973. The efficacy of odd‚Äìeven rationing is debated. For gasoline, it does not actually reduce consumption much, since people prevented from filling up one day will just fill up the day before, and/or the day after; the total number of people in line on each day is roughly unchanged.Odd Even Gasoline Rationing by Jim Johnston on November 14, 2012Odd scheme Odd Scheme by Don Boudreaux on November 12, 2012 Some propose that it has psychological effects like reducing panic buying,Why Gas Lines Are Like Bank Runs & Why Odd/Even Gas Rationing Actually Works by Barry Ritholtz ‚Äì November 13th, 2012, 7:15AM discouraging people from making small purchases on a daily basis,ET Fuel Rationing Is Hard to Gauge by CARL BIALIK November 16, 2012, 6:53 p.m. or emphasizing the shortage and further discouraging unnecessary trips.November 17, 2012, 3:46 AM Does Odd‚ÄìEven Rationing Work? Carl Bialik Rationing access, rather than gasoline, based on number plate parity can reduce traffic congestion. In some areas, wealthier people purposely own two cars with opposite-parity number plates, to circumvent any restrictions. Vanity plates which do not contain any digits may be arbitrarily classed as odd or even.  Dealing with 0  Mathematically, zero is an even number; indeed, half of the numbers in a given range end in 0, 2, 4, 6, 8 and the other half in 1, 3, 5, 7, 9, so it makes sense to include 0 with the other even digits for rationing. However, some people do not know that zero is even, and this ignorance can cause confusion. The relevant law sometimes stipulates that zero is even.For example, a 1980 Maryland law specifies, \\"(a) On even numbered calendar dates gasoline shall only be purchased by operators of vehicles bearing personalized registration plates containing no numbers and registration plates with the last digit ending in an even number. This shall not include ham radio operator plates. Zero is an even number; (b) On odd numbered calendar dates ‚Ä¶\\" Partial quotation taken from Google book search, accessed on 2008-02-22. In fact, an odd‚Äìeven restriction on driving in 1977 Paris did lead to confusion when the rules were unclear. On an odd-only day, the police avoided fining drivers whose plates ended in 0, because they did not know whether 0 was even. The quote is attributed to the heute broadcast of October 1, 1977. Arsham's account is repeated in U.S. gasoline rationing Odd‚Äìeven rationing was instituted in the U.S. as part of the response to the second gasoline crisis in 1979, when turbulent conditions in Iraq and Iran led to worldwide oil price increases, even though a supply shortage did not materialize in the U.S. After Hurricane Sandy hit the eastern coast in late October 2012, gasoline became scarce and caused lines to extend miles past stations and people to wait for hours to fill cars or gasoline tanks for generators powering houses without electricity. Panic buying and fuel hoarding began within days of the storm. On November 3, 2012, New Jersey governor Chris Christie issued a gas rationing system to follow the odd‚Äìeven rule to ease lines in 12 counties. A few days later on November 8, New York City Mayor Michael Bloomberg, along with Nassau County Executive Ed Mangano and Suffolk County Executive Steve Bellone, instituted an odd‚Äìeven rationing system due to gasoline shortages from Hurricane Sandy. In New York City, such rationing lasted through November 23 due to the increased travel and gasoline demand during the Thanksgiving week, while it ended more than a week earlier in the other counties. License plates without numbers, such as vanity plates, were considered odd.http://newyork.cbslocal.com/2012/11/09/gas-rationing-odd-even-rule-goes- into-effect-in-nyc-long-island/ India In Delhi, during the ministry of Arvind Kejriwal, private vehicles could be on the road only on certain days, depending on their license plate number, from January 1, 2016. The scheme aimed to reduce pollution and smog in Delhi. The scheme was ended on November 11, 2017. The scheme came into force for the third time on November 4, 2019, after the success of first two times. The results were visible from the very first day as people of Delhi welcomed the move.

The habitat is the understorey of subtropical and tropical rainforest on fertile soils. The natural range of distribution is from the Richmond River, New South Wales to tropical Queensland. This plant features beautifully scented flowers.  Description  Atractocarpus chartaceus is a shrub or a small tree, up to 6 metres (20 ft) in height, with a stem diameter of 8 cm (3 in). The trunk is crooked and asymmetrical at the base. The bark is brownish grey, and relatively smooth with some wrinkles or horizontal cracks. The tips of the branchlets have fawn hairs. The leaves are opposite on the stem, or whorled. The juvenile leaves are very thin and linear in shape. The adult leaves broad and reverse lanceolate, being narrower at the stem end, and measure 5 to 15 cm (2‚Äì6 in) long, 0.5 to 3 cm (0.2-1.2 in) wide. Leaves often marked by the trail of a leaf miner. The mid rib is not raised on the upper surface, although the lateral veins are markedly raised on the upper surface. The midrib is raised under the leaf. The creamy white flowers form from August to November; they are usually single at the end of branchlets, occasionally in pairs. Flowers fragrantly scented similar to the gardenia. Flower stalks 2 to 5 mm long. The edible fruits mature from April to August, being an orange or red berry, 1.5 to 2 cm long. Many triangular seeds are set in a sweet pulp. Seeds 4 to 5 mm long. Regeneration from fresh seed is fairly slow but reliable. Atractocarpus chartaceus juvenile foliage  Uses  The small size, scented flowers and attractive fruit makes it suitable as garden plant. It prefers some shade and good drainage in cultivation. Taxonomy German naturalist and Government Botanist for Victoria Ferdinand von Mueller originally described Atractocarpus chartaceus in 1860 as Gardenia chartacea, before giving it the name Randia chartacea in 1875 by which it was known for many years. The specific epithet chartacea refers to its thin and papery leaves. Then in 1999, the genus was revised by botanists Christopher Puttock and Christopher Quinn and the Narrow-leaved Gardenia gained its current binomial name.

He played in the Football League for Nelson, Burnley and Crystal Palace and also had spells in non- league football. Born in Newbiggin-by-the-Sea, he returned to the north-east of England after his football career and died in North Seaton, near Ashington, at the age of 82.  Career  Earle began his career with Newbiggin Athletic, before moving to Blyth Spartans in July 1924, where he became a professional in November that year. Outside of football, he also worked in the local coal mine. Earle's performances were noticed by Third Division North team Nelson who required a new outside-left. In the early hours of 15 September 1925, Nelson representatives visited the mine where Earle had just completed a night shift and signed him on a free transfer. The team had a game later that day and Earle travelled to Nelson to play the match, making his debut in the 2‚Äì2 draw with Ashington despite having had no sleep during the night. On 19 December 1925, he scored his first goal in the Football League in the 7‚Äì0 win over Tranmere Rovers, and scored two more in the following game against Wigan Borough. At the end of the 1925‚Äì26 campaign several First Division clubs, including Liverpool, Everton and Aston Villa, declared their interest in Earle, but Nelson declined all approaches for the player. He scored his first senior hat-trick on 4 September 1926 in the 5‚Äì1 win against Doncaster Rovers at Seedhill. From the day he signed to his final match on 18 December 1926, Earle played in 57 first-team matches, never missing a game during his time with the club. In December 1926, he was signed by nearby First Division side Burnley for a transfer fee of ¬£1,250. He made his Burnley debut on 12 February 1927 in the 1‚Äì4 defeat to Derby County. Earle found his opportunities limited at his new club, and was unable to displace first-choice outside-left Louis Page. Earle played in the 2‚Äì5 loss to Sheffield United on 29 March, before scoring his first Clarets goal in the 1‚Äì2 defeat against Sheffield Wednesday on 23 April. Despite this, Earle never again appeared for Burnley in a first- team match, and was placed on the transfer list at the end of the 1927‚Äì28 season. However, no offer was forthcoming and he joined non-league Boston Town on a free transfer in July 1928. Earle spent five years with the Lincolnshire club before moving back into league football when he signed for Third Division South outfit Crystal Palace in the summer of 1933. He scored on his debut in the 4‚Äì0 win over Southend United in August 1933. Altogether, Earle managed three goals in 10 league appearances for the club, before leaving in August 1934 to return to non-league football with Gresley Rovers. He joined Boston United midway through the 1934‚Äì35 season, before signing for Wisbech Town in November 1935, where he ended his career in the summer of 1936.

It stars Lou Taylor Pucci, Chris Pine, Piper Perabo, and Emily VanCamp as four survivors of a viral pandemic attempting to avoid the looming threat of becoming infected. Filmed in 2006, it received a limited release in the United States on September 4, 2009, following Pine's breakout performance in Star Trek earlier that year. It received positive reviews from critics and grossed $5.8 million. In 2020, the film received renew focus and praise during the COVID-19 pandemic. Plot An infectious virus has spread worldwide, killing most of the population. Two brothers, Brian and Danny, along with Brian's girlfriend Bobby and Danny's friend Kate, head to Turtle Beach in the southwestern United States, a secluded beach motel where they believe they can wait for the viral pandemic to die out and eventually start a new life. To help them survive, they follow a set of rules created by Brian. On their way to the beach, the group encounter survivor Frank and his infected daughter Jodie, whose vehicle has run out of fuel. The four escape from Frank when he attacks them but their car breaks down and they are forced to help Frank and Jodie so they can use his vehicle. At Frank's insistence, they travel to a nearby high school where a serum for the pandemic is rumored to have been developed. Upon arriving, Frank, Brian, Danny, and Kate discover that the serum does not work, and the last remaining doctor is preparing to euthanize a group of infected children and himself. Meanwhile, Bobby is infected by Jodie and hides her infection from the others. Frank is later forced to bring Jodie to a portable toilet, giving Brian the opportunity to leave them behind and take their vehicle. The group then stops at a hotel, which, unknown to them, is being used as a base by armed survivalists. When the survivalists return, they ambush the group and declare their intent to keep the girls. Forcing Bobby and Kate to disrobe to check them for infection, the survivalists discover that Bobby is infected and order them away. With Bobby's infection revealed to the rest of the group, Brian forces her to leave. As they run low on fuel, Brian kills two women to siphon their vehicle but suffers a gunshot wound in the process. While treating his brother's injury, Danny discovers that Brian is infected, from having previously kissed Bobby. That night, Danny attempts to leave Brian behind but Brian takes the keys to their vehicle. Determined to not die alone from the virus, Brian refuses to surrender the keys and urges Danny to kill him. Left with no other option, Danny shoots Brian to death. Danny and Kate reach Turtle Beach the next morning, but Danny realizes that without his brother, the place that had seemed so special to them as kids is now empty.

Development  The SZD-24 Foka was designed for competition flying in the 'Standard' class as well as aerobatic flying. The design originated from a design competition within SZD which was won by the ‚ÄùDelfin‚Äù, to become the SZD-24 Foka in production. The first flight, by SP-2069, took place in May 1960 at Bielsko but results were not good with poorly performing airbrakes which were unable to limit the airspeed below VNE (Velocity Never Exceed). This posed a problem as OSTIV (Organisation Scientifique et Technique Internationale du Vol √† Voile ‚Äì International Scientific and technical organisation for gliding) rules for the Standard class in gliding competitions stipulate that speed limiting devices must limit maximum speed to VNE or below. A second prototype was quickly built, fitted with much improved air-brakes as well as improved canopy locks and an additional access panel in the rear fuselage. Adam Zientek carried out the first flight of the second prototype on 24 May 1960 which went on to take third place in the 'Standard' class at the 1960 World Gliding Championships at K√∂ln in Germany, piloted by Adam Witek. The SZD-24 Foka prototype was much admired for its performance, elegance, aerodynamically clean lines and comfortable semi reclined flying position. The pre-production variant, called SZD-24A, introduced more refinements and the line was steadily improved up to the SZD-32 Foka 5 final production variant. Description (SZD-24-4A ) The SZD-24 Foka series were Standard class gliders of predominantly wooden construction with fixed wheel and skid undercarriage. Fuselage 250px The fuselage comprised a wooden structure with the cockpit in the extreme nose transitioning with very clean lines to the integral fin at the rear. The forward opening canopy was jettisonable in case of emergency and comprising plexiglass clear portions fitted to a 'Duralumin' frame. A 300√ó125 mm mainwheel, with mechanically operated brakes connected to the airbrake lever, was fitted in a semi recessed position augmented by flush fitting skids under the nose and tail. The construction methods of the fuselage evolved throughout the series culminating in large panels, formed in concrete moulds, of plywood and PVC foam sandwich giving a very smooth finish, high strength and reduced weight. The pilot sat semi-reclined in an adjustable back-rest seat with headrest and non-adjustable rudder pedals. The instrument panel sits on a column above and between the pilots legs, with basic instruments and supplementary instruments as required. A single tow hook is fitted to the left of the nose-skid with a release control cable operated by a control knob at the base of the instrument panel. The forward sliding canopy comprised the entire top half of the forward fuselage which slid forward, on runners, controlled by a knob in a track on the left side of the cockpit rim. The canopy was constructed around a 'Duralumin' frame with 'Plexiglas' transparent section and moulded opaque nose section. Wings The trapezoidal wings were built up with heavy gauge moulded plywood skins, supported by wooden ribs, using NACA 633-618 at the root changing smoothly to NACA 4415 at the tip. Large metal plate air brakes are fitted well aft of the main spar at approximately ¬æ chord, in already-turbulent air flow. Roll control is provided by ailerons in the trailing edges of the outer wings. The SZD-24-2 Foka 2 was fitted with reduced area ailerons to reduce drag, but roll control was dramatically reduced. Tail Unit The sharply swept fin (used to increase control power and stability with a smaller fuselage, reducing weight), was integral with the fuselage and supported the plywood skinned tail plane at approx ‚Öì fin span. The mass balanced rudder and elevators were built up from wood/plywood and fabric covered. Surface Finish As delivered the Foka's were given a similar surface finish, with a broad stripe, tapering from the centre-section to nose and tail, either side of the fuselage and a contrasting colour on the remainder of the fuselage. A large stylised Foka logo was added in the stripe under the cockpit. Wings were usually white with red wing tips. Operational history The Foka was the holder of seven world records and many Polish national records including: * 300 km triangle World Record @ 62.29 km/h by Pelagia Majewska in 1960 * 300 km triangle World Record @ 72 km/h by Pelagia Majewska in 1963 * 300 km triangle World Record @ 82.5 km/h by Adela Dankowska in 1963 (later the same day) * World record Out and return Leszno- Olsztyn-Leszno (682 km) in 1964 by Jan Wr√≥blewski * World record free distance of 744 km in 1964 by Henryk Lisiecki * First five places at the 1962 International Professional Gliding competition at Leszno in Poland. * Simultaneous completion of a 535 km triangle by 34 pilots flying 'Foka's at the Polish National Gliding Championships in 1964. Other achievements by 'Foka' aircraft include: * Camille Labar first in the 1962 French National Gliding Championships. * Jaques Lacheny first out of 47 in the European Cup Gliding championship. * The Foka 4 was also the only standard class glider ever to win the open-class World Gliding Championships, in 1965 at RAF South Cerney, Gloucestershire, piloted by Jan Wr√≥blewski; Edward Makula in a Foka 4 came fourth. Foka 4's piloted by F. Kƒôpka and Jerzy Popiel came 3rd and 4th in the Standard class. After several accidents attributed to structural failure, all Foka aircraft extant have now been limited to a maximum speed of in clear air and IFR/rough air. Following a fatal accident due to failure of the wing attachment mechanism in 2010 and another fatal accident with a glider with similar assembly mechanism, the British Gliding Association has issued a Safety Alert for owners of Foka IV gliders.  Variants  ;SZD-24 Foka:The first prototype, ( SP-2069), flown on 2 May 1960, was found to be longitudinally unstable and the airbrakes incapable of limiting the speed to below VNE (Velocity Never Exceed). ;SZD-24A Foka A:The second prototype (SP-2070), flown on 24 May 1960 with improved structure enlarged airbrake panels, improved canopy locks and 1.5 kg of ballast in the rear fuselage. Compliant with OSTIV regulations for the Standard class, SP-2070 was flown by Adam Witek at the 1960 World Gliding Championships to third place in the Standard class. ;SZD-24B Foka B:Three pre-production aircraft, (SP-2241 to SP-2243), first flown in February 1961, with canopy locks reverting to those used in the first prototype, canopy made from two sheets of plexiglas bonded along the centre-line for better visibility, large panels produced using bonded plywood / PVC foam sandwich, plywood covering increased in thickness to 2.5mm, removal of the lead ballast in the tailcone, a 10% enlarged rudder area and a reinforced tailskid. ;SZD-24C Foka C:Production aircraft with improved laminar flow over the nose, main-wheel moved forward 45 cm to reduce wear on the nose-skid, larger airbrakes, improvements to the instruments, KP-18 oxygen regulator and bottle fitted in the luggage compartment, and Elektron magnesium alloy castings for the flying control mountings and fittings. Foka C's were exported to 19 countries with circa 100 being built. The slightly heavier SZD-24C Foka C could fly faster for similar best L/D and minimum sink values. ;SZD-24-2 Foka 2:A single SZD-24-2 Foka 2 (SP-2362) was built, incorporating attempts to reduce drag by improving laminar flow and reducing the area of the ailerons. Trials flown in 1961 showed no appreciable improvement in performance over the SZD-24C, only decreased roll response, with the time taken for rolling from 45¬∞ one way to 45¬∞ the other increasing from 2.8 seconds to 4 seconds, as well as poorer performance at speeds above 85 km/h.. ;SZD-24-3 Foka 3:A single glider, built, under the supervision of J . Trzeciak M.Sc., with experimental wings constructed with three laminations, remained unflown despite excellent results from static strength testing. ;SZD-24-4 Foka 4:Two prototypes of the Foka 4 series were built with the fuselage and tail coming from the SZD-24C and wings, with slight modifications, from the SZD-24-2. The new wings were manufactured with graduated thickness impregnated plywood formed to shape in concrete moulds The first prototype was flown on 26 February 1962 with excellent results, proving to be easy to fly with pleasant handling characteristics and good performance, as well as effective and easy to use airbrakes. The second prototype (SP-2363) took part in the 1963 World Gliding Championships at Junin in Argentina with credible results. ;SZD-24-4A Foka 4A:Production Foka 4 aircraft. ;SZD-24-4 M Foka 45:Production Foka 4 aircraft.

Watkins also played cricket and hockey for Carmarthenshire. Rugby career Watkins began his rugby career with Carmarthenshire-based team Llandovery, and during the 1898/99 season was captain of the senior XV.Jenkins (1991), pg 162. By the time he was first selected to play for the Wales national team, he had switched club to Llanelli, at the time one of the most prominent Welsh clubs. His first international game was against Scotland, in the second Wales game of the 1904 Home Nations Championship. After a draw in the opening match to England, the Welsh selectors had brought in five new caps, four among the pack, for the Scottish encounter. Wales won 21‚Äì3, with the Welsh backs scoring heavily thanks to the sustained possession achieved by Watkins and the rest of the forward players. Watkins was then reselected for the final Wales game of the tournament, an away match at the Balmoral Showgrounds against Ireland. Wales lost the match by two points, with complaints for the loss being directed at poor refereeing decisions. In the 1904/05 season Watkins was given the captaincy of Llanelli, and retained his position in the Wales team, playing in all three matches of the Triple Crown winning 1905 Championship. The opening game of the series was against England, played at the Cardiff Arms Park. Wales dominated from the start of the match and scored seven tries, two of which were scored by Welsh forwards, Arthur Harding and Watkins himself. This try was Watkins only international points. The next two matches saw an away victory over Scotland and a home win over Ireland. The 1905 winning team is still recognised as one of the strongest Welsh teams in history, centred on a formidable pack. With Wales dominating the Home Nations, the next game was to be the historic encounter with the Original All Blacks, New Zealand's first touring team. Despite being available for the opening game of the 1906 Home Nations Championship less than a month later, Watkins was not selected for the 'Match of the Century', which saw Wales narrowly beat the All Blacks. Wales changed their pack formation to counter the New Zealand tactics, and the Welsh selectors brought in Charlie and Cliff Pritchard at the expense of Watkins and Cardiff's Billy O'Neill. Watkins played his final Wales international against England in January 1906. With his international career now behind him, Watkins played in one final showcase match in Wales, when he was part of the Llanelli team to face the touring South Africans of 1906. Played on 29 December at Stradey Park and led by 'Danny' Walters, Llanelli played an exciting encounter against the Springboks, but lost 16‚Äì3.

Adams first tried to formulate the gum into a rubber suitable for tires. When that didn't work, he made the chicle into a chewing gum called Chiclets.

Region S√∏nderjylland‚ÄìSchleswig's FDE building, August 2009. Region S√∏nderjylland‚ÄìSchleswig was established on 16 September 1997 in Aabenraa. It is a recognized Euroregion, a legistrative cooperation between two or more European regions sharing a common border. All Euroregions are organised in the Association of European Border Regions with head domicile in Gronau. Just the coordinating centre for the cross border cooperation within Region S√∏nderjylland‚ÄìSchleswig is for filled by the Regional Office in Padborg.  Name  Region S√∏nderjylland‚ÄìSchleswig refers to the historical background, which the cross-border cooperation has. Both Schleswig and S√∏nderjylland have become two independent institutions which characterized the old Duchy of Schleswig that got divided in 1920 between Denmark and Germany. The southeastern part of Schleswig/S√∏nderjylland, which belongs to the German district of Rendsburg-Eckernf√∂rde, declined to become part of the cross-border cooperation.

At the same time the co-operation supports the European Charter for Border Regions and Cross-border regions that was carried out by the Association of European Border Regions in 1995. The foundation for the co-operation is based on equal rights and a mutual respect for the other side‚Äôs cultural peculiarity, and decisions are made in unanimity. The Regions administrative domicile is located where the partners decide to place the secretary of the organization.  Objectives  There are several different objectives for the cross-border cooperation. First of all, a wish for a broader demographic contact and cultural exchange between the two populations, which in turn should lead to a deeper mutual understanding and an increased knowledge of each culture and language in the longer term. In order to support this objective, Region S√∏nderjylland‚ÄìSchleswig provides administrative and financial support for cultural projects, for example through the Interreg project ‚ÄúKulturDialog‚Äù, exchanging teachers, cross border school cooperation and various language projects are prioritized. There is also great focus on economic integration and interaction of the cross-border labour marked. Since 2004 the Infocenter, under Region S√∏nderjylland‚ÄìSchleswig, has provided advice and counselling for cross-border commuters. The centre started as an Interreg project but became so popular, that it was permanently established in 2007. The Infocenter provides free advice and counselling both to the business community, local government and private individuals, wanting to expand job or living opportunities on the other side of the border. Here there is close cooperation with various other networks, for example trade unions, employment agencies, local authorities and clubs. Our internet page; Pendlerinfo, administered by the Regional Office thus offers information and help for commuters. Infocenter regularly hold lectures in conjunction with both Danish and German employment agencies and unemployment insurance representatives, in-service training of employees in the councils dealing with cross-border commuting, and give personal counselling. Region S√∏nderjylland‚ÄìSchleswig is also active in voicing concerns specific to the border region. Region S√∏nderjylland‚ÄìSchleswig has for example pointed out the need for mutual recognition of business educations. Also building projects of current interest like the Fehmarn Belt Bridge and general infrastructure within the border region has the attention of Region S√∏nderjylland‚ÄìSchleswig. In order to support the cross-border business community there has also been some actual projects like the development of Danish-German parking discs and a pocket dictionary.  Organization  The organization consists of: * Board * Committees and business groups * Regional Office as secretary The board consists of eight members. Chairman of the board is currently Hans Philip Tietje, Region Syddanmark. The responsibilities are many: the board prepares and carries out decisions and works closely together with the Regional Office. Furthermore, the board can appoint business groups for special assignments. Last but not least the board represents Region S√∏nderjylland‚ÄìSchleswig interests in any public debate. Decisions are based on a majority of votes but unity is always the goal. The Regional Forum has one committee: Committee for Culture, Contact and Cooperation. Furthermore, there has been established several business interest groups. The Regional Office in Padborg is the coordinating centre for all Region S√∏nderjylland‚ÄìSchleswig's activities. Political cooperation is coordinated and initiatives from political side are closely monitored. One current example is the initiative to improve the exchange of language teachers. The teaching of Danish in Germany is especially affected by this, because Danish-German exchange of teachers, which should be taken for granted, is difficult due to administrative differences in in-service training. The committee in cooperation with the Regional Office has just made an official enquiry to the ministry in Kiel.  Finances  The expenses of the organization are curtailed by 50% to each the Danish and the German partners, excluding any grants from any side. All partners have full access to all financial information of the organization. The budget for 2012 is 5.7 million DKK.

Cecil Paget was the son of Sir George Ernest Paget, Chairman of the Midland Railway Company (MR) 1890-1911. He was born in Sutton Bonington, Nottinghamshire, educated at Harrow and Pembroke College, Cambridge, and then joined the MR as an engineering pupil of S. W. Johnson, the company's Locomotive Superintendent. Paget rose quickly to become Works Manager at the main Derby Works from 1904, under Johnson's successor R. M. Deeley. He was also Deeley's deputy. Promotion April 1907 saw Paget appointed General Superintendent of the MR by the new General Manager Guy Granet. The role, which would now be called Chief Operating Officer, was expanded from that of the previous 'Superintendent of the Line' and put him in charge of the daily running of the locomotive department, which was formerly a responsibility of his erstwhile boss, Deeley. The appointment was also open to charges of nepotism against his father. This inevitably led to some friction.Barnes 1969, p.224, p.228 Paget locomotive Paget locomotive Interest in possible developments of the classic steam locomotive led Paget to design and build a 2-6-2 steam locomotive with many novel features (8 single-acting cylinders, rotary valves, etc.) at Derby. He financed this from his own pocket, and work began in 1906 while he was Works Manager. When Paget ran out of money for his experimental locomotive, it was completed by the MR at an additional cost of ¬£1,500,Mills 2000, p.21 but, without the close supervision of Paget, and probably because of the animosity of Deeley, there was inadequate testing and a lack of remedial work on the design. Work stopped in 1909 and the remains of the locomotive were scrapped in about 1915. Traffic management Paget's radical ideas were more successful in the sphere of traffic management and his introduction of train reporting, centralised traffic control and locomotive numbering by power type quickly reduced costs incurred by delays to trains.Barnes 1969, pp.224-226 Locomotive policy A point of agreement with Deeley was the need for larger locomotives to haul heavier trains, but this policy failed to get past the company's board because of the capital expenditure required (particularly on replacing weak under-bridges).Barnes 1969, pp.266-267 Military service He served in France with the Railway Operating Division in World War I,Barnes 1969, pp.228 commanding operations in France and Belgium and rising to the rank of Lieutenant-Colonel in the Royal Engineers. His military awards were the DSO in 1916, the CMG in 1918 and he was Mentioned in Despatches. The French awarded him Officier de la L√©gion d'honneur and the Belgians their Officier de l'Ordre de la Couronne. Family In 1906 Cecil Paget married Lady Alexandra Osborne, fourth daughter of the 9th Duke of Leeds, and they restored a 17th-century hall at Kings Newton,Derbyshire UK 2008 near Melbourne, just south of Derby, as their home. Cecil lived there until his death.Steam Index 2007 After the war Paget didn't return to railway work.Mills 2000, p.23 He succeeded to the baronetcy in 1923, his elder brother George having been killed during the 1900 Transvaal campaign in the second Boer War. His wife obtained a divorce in 1925 and Paget subsequently married Florence, daughter of James Butt. He died in 1936, survived by his second wife, but without children, and was buried in the family plot at Marlepit Hill cemetery, Sutton Bonington.Beswic 2003 Footnotes References * Barnes, E. G.

The sharakans written by Pahlavuni typically have strong doctrinal influences and several relate to either the Feast of the Annunciation or Palm Sunday. Two of his better known sharakans are Khorhudn Hanchar and Metsahrash. Pahlavuni earned the nickname ‚Äúthe younger lover of martyrs‚Äù because of his love for translating martyrologies from Greek and Latin to Armenian.

Grigor III held office as catholicos for a little more than fifty years, and his younger brother Nerses Shnorhali assisted him greatly during this time. Pahlavuni was able to maintain peace within the Cilician Kingdom and the catholicate during a time of instability due to raids from foreign invaders. Because of these foreign invasions, Grigor III chose to seek refuge and moved the catholicate two times; once in 1116 from Karmir Vank at Kesun to its new location in Tsovak, and again in 1149 to Hromgla.

A short lyric poem of 110 verses, it describes how Rama, hero of the Ramayana epic, sends a message via a swan to his beloved wife, Sita, who has been abducted by the demon king Ravana. The poem belongs to the ' \\"messenger poem\\" genre and is very closely modeled upon the Meghad≈´ta of KƒÅlidƒÅsa. It has particular significance for Srivaishnavites, whose god, Vishnu, it celebrates.  Sources  The Hansa-Sandesha owes a great deal to its two poetic predecessors, KƒÅlidƒÅsa's Meghad≈´ta and Valmƒ´ki's RamƒÅyana. Vedanta Desika's use of the Meghaduta is extensive and transparently deliberate; his poem is a response to one of India's most famous poems by its most celebrated poet. Vedanta Desika's debt to Valmƒ´ki is perhaps more pervasive but less obvious, and possibly less deliberate too. Where the poet consciously plays with Kalidasa's verse, he treats the Ramayana more as a much-cherished story. Nevertheless, he is clearly as familiar with the details of Valmiki's poem as with Kalidasa's, and he echoes very specific images and details from the epic.  The poet  Vedanta Desika (IAST:) is best known as an important acarya in the Srivaishnavite tradition of South India which promulgated the philosophical theory of . He was a prolific writer in both Tamil and Sanskrit, composing over 100 philosophical, devotional and literary works; the Hamsa-Sandesha is his only work of this kind. Vedanta Desika was born in 1269 AD. One popular story about his birth and childhood runs as follows: His devout parents were childless. One day they were visited in two separate but simultaneous dreams in which they were instructed to go to Tirupati, an important pilgrimage spot in south India, where they would be given a son. Once there, his mother had another dream in which she gave birth to Venkatesha's (the god of Tirupati) ' (bell). The next day the temple bell was missing and the chief priest, who had also had a visitation, celebrated the imminent birth of a child sent by the lord. Twelve years later, was born, the ' (incarnation of the bell) who later became best known as Vedanta Desika (an honorific which literally means \\"guide for the Vedanta\\").As detailed by A talented child, he amazed the senior priests at the age of five and proclaimed that he had learnt all there was to know by 20. Vedanta Desika was the chief acarya of Kanchi (now Kanchipuram in Tamil Nadu), the centre of the northern Srivaishnavite community, but later went to live in Srirangam (a town near Madurai in southern Tamil Nadu), the centre of the southern Srivaishnavites. He died at Srirangam in 1370, having returned to the city after its re-capture by Hindus following a Muslim sack. Vedanta Desika's intent of writing such a poem was to attract Sanskrit Literature fans and purists towards the SriVaishnava Philosophy by using this poem as a medium of introducing Srivaishnava concepts in the poem. Structure of the text The poem is divided into two clear parts, in line with Kalidasa's Meghaduta. The first half, of 60 stanzas, describes how Rama sights and engages the swan as his messenger,Verses 1.2-1.7 and then describes to the swan the route he should take and the many places ‚Äì primarily holy spots - he ought to stop on the way.Verses 1.8-1.60 The second part begins in Lanka where the poet introduces us to the ashoka grove where Sita is being held,Verse 2.7 the tree beneath which she sits,Verse 2.8 and finally Sita herself in a string of verses.Verse 2.9-2.23 The actual message to Sita consists of only 16 verses,Verses 2.31-2.46 after which Rama dismisses the swan and the narrator completes the story of the Ramayana. The poem ends with an autobiographical note by the poet.Verses 2.48-50 respectively Hamsa The messenger in this poem is referred to as a ' ('royal ).Verse 1.2 According to Monier-Williams, a ' is a \\"goose, gander, swan, flamingo, or other aquatic bird\\" and he notes that it can refer to a poetical or mythical bird. Although popularly thought of as a swan, particularly in modern India, ornithologists have noted that swans do not, and never have, existed in the Indian avifauna, and Western translations tend to plump for 'goose', or 'flamingo'; 'crane' is also a possibility. Genre The ' ('messenger poem') genre is one of the best defined in Indian literature. There are about 55 messenger poems in Sanskrit, plus others written in vernacular tongues. These span India chronologically, topographically and ideologically: there are Muslim and Christian messenger poems, and poets are still composing these poems today. Each follows Kalidasa's Meghaduta to a greater or lesser extent. They involve two separated lovers, one of who sends the other a message, and thus are designed to evoke the ' ('feeling of love'). And they adhere to a bipartite structure in which the first half charts the journey the messenger is to follow, while the second describes the messenger's destination, the recipient and the message itself. Metre The metre used in Hamsa-Sandesha is the slow ('slowly advancing') metre which is thought to be suitable for the love-in-separation theme. The specifications of this metre are encapsulated in the following line (which is itself set to the ' rhythm): :'''' The line means, by way of several technical abbreviations, that the ' metre has a natural break after the first four syllables and then after the next six, with the last seven syllables as one group. It is further defined as containing several different ga·πáas, i.e., poetical feet consisting of predefined combinations of guru and laghu ‚Äì long and short ‚Äì syllables. When each line is scanned it looks like the following: :(‚Äì ‚Äì ‚Äì) ( ‚Äì u u ) ( u u u ) (‚Äì ‚Äì u) (‚Äì ‚Äì u) (‚Äì) (‚Äì) with the vertical bars representing the natural pauses and the brackets the predefined feet. Each stanza consists of four lines or pƒÅdas. In European terms, the scansion may be written out as follows: :‚Äì ‚Äì ‚Äì ‚Äì u u u u u ‚Äì ‚Äì u ‚Äì ‚Äì u ‚Äì x Commentaries Commentaries include one by Agyatkartrik. Views and criticism The Hamsa-Sandesha was written during the medieval literary resurgence, long after the classical heyday of Sanskrit literature, and falls into the category of post-1000 AD regional Sanskrit literature. Such literature tended to enjoy less national recognition than its predecessors and in modern India literary works of this type are all but forgotten. The Hamsa- Sandesha too has slipped into obscurity for all but Srivaishnavites. What criticism and discussion there is tends to focus either on the Hamsa-Sandesha in the shadow of the Meghaduta,See or on its religious and philosophical significance. Modern Western scholarship on the poem and its author includes books and articles by Stephen P Hopkins, and and by Yigal Bronner and David Shulman.

He was a host of the Kabarett shows Scheibenwischer and Neues aus der Anstalt. Biography Schramm was born in Bad Homburg vor der H√∂he. His father was a member of the Social Democratic Party of Germany (SPD) which influenced his later performances as a Kabarett artist. At his gymnasium (high school) he claims to have been the only working class child in his class. Georg Schramm ‚Äì ‚ÄûDrei Kinder ‚Äì da braucht man keinen Anlageberater‚Äú. In: S√ºddeutsche Zeitung. 10. Juli 2009 He then enlisted for the Bundeswehr as a short-term career soldier which he retired from as a reserve officer. Afterwards he studied psychology in Bochum and worked as a psychologist in a rehab clinic from 1976 to 1988. Since 1992 he has been working full-time as a Kabarett artist. Kabarett Schramm never stars on the stage as himself but uses a range of different characters to speak their minds. Even if he stars on the stage as \\"Schramm\\", he only does so acting as a character of the same name. Most of the time he uses three characters for his performances: ;Lothar Dombrowski: Dombrowski is a Prussian pensioner, disabled by a war and living in a retirement home. He is against any trends and funny comedy. Schramm uses this character to dish out coarse criticism of current events. ;Oberst Sanftleben: An officer of the Bundeswehr, Schramm created this character based on his personal experience with the army. Sanftleben often comments on military and war related matters, for example the Iraq War and offers his personal insight on the reasons for those conflicts. Also, he shines a light on warlike aspects of the financial crisis. ;August: August is a worker and SPD member from Hesse, talking in the typical dialect of that region. Coming from a social democratic background himself, Schramm uses August to both criticize the party from a member's perspective and to shield it from criticism. The character is partly modeled after Schramm's father. Schramm is considered the most aggressive, outspoken and serious Kabarett artist of his time. In 2007, he published his first book, Lassen Sie es mich so sagen ‚Äì Dombrowski deutet die Zeichen der Zeit, a compilation of texts from his shows from 1983-2007. Television From 2000 to 2006 he was a regular guest in the Scheibenwischer which he co-hosted since 2003. He left the show on 24 April 2006 for reasons of conceptional and personal differences with fellow co-hosts Bruno Jonas and Mathias Richling. From 2007 to 2010 he co-hosted Neues aus der Anstalt with Urban Priol.

It stands high above the surroundings just south of the main road from Stege to the white cliffs of M√∏n. The impressive whitewashed building can be seen from miles around and has been used as a landmark by sailors in the Baltic Sea. History Elmelunde is the oldest church on the island of M√∏n, apparently constructed on a site where a wooden church once stood. The flat mound, to the north of the church, is even older. It is believed to be a heathen burial ground from the Bronze Age. The present church dates back to 1085 when parts of the present choir and nave were built in the Romanesque style. Only the triumphal arch and the sidewalls remain from this period. The earliest additions were carried out around the year 1200 when the church was extended towards the west. Work on the tower began around 1300 but was not completed until 1500. The wooden ceiling was replaced by Gothic crossvaulting in 1462.Elmelunde Kirkes historie from Keldby og Elmelunde Sogne.

The paintings were hidden for centuries as, following the reformation, they were covered with layer after layer of limewash. In 1969, the National Museum of Denmark undertook major restoration work on the wall paintings. The vaults were cleaned, earlier restoration work was corrected and new frescos were revealed. The paintings in the nave and choir were discovered in 1885 and initially restored in 1895. During the most recent restoration work, it was found that the church had earlier been decorated with Romanesque frescos, traces of which could be seen on the walls of the nave and on the triumphal arch. However, until now, it has not been possible to restore them. The most comprehensive wallpainting work was in fact carried out by the Elmelunde Master presenting a variety of scenes from the story of the Creation and the New Testament but also with illustrations of everyday activities such as ploughing and hunting. Between the paintings, margins with frills depicting flowers, plants and other ornaments can be seen. The figures all have sleepy faces, a characteristic of the Elmelund Master.

It was founded in 1980 by Dieter Hildebrandt and produced by BR / RBB to be broadcast on Das Erste. The show ended in 2008 after 28 years on the air. Conception Scheibenwischer had its focus on solely Kabarett and used a more solemn way of humor, as opposed to lighthearted stand-up comedy. As such, the topics discussed by the artists on the show have sometimes had a potential to cause uproar and scandals with contemporary politicians, especially conservative ones like Franz Josef Strau√ü. Alongside Hildebrandt, who hosted the show until 2003, a number of prominent artists were guests on the show, such as Gerhard Polt, Wolfgang Stumph, Andreas Rebers, Hagen Rether, Philipp Weber, the musical group Bierm√∂sl Blosn or singer Konstantin Wecker. The guest artist was an essential part of the show, which served as a framework for different artists to be featured. History Founding Dieter Hildebrandt. Hildebrandt pitched the idea of the show to Sender Freies Berlin (SFB) in 1980 after his previous program, Notizen aus der Provinz on ZDF, had been canceled. It was taken up and produced by SFB to be broadcast on the ARD channel. After creating the show, Hildebrandt was famously attacked by the Bavarian chief of state and candidate for German chancellor, Franz Josef Strau√ü, as a \\"political poisoner,\\" which served to strengthen Hildebrandt's image as a mordant but incorruptible critic of politicians. Glory years The show was at its height during the 1980s and 1990s with a conservative Kohl federal government; however, some state governments as well as (though less frequently) Eurocrats became the object of its satirical acts. During that time, several sketches were broadcast that made the show famous, such as Kriegerdenkmal (war memorial), Rhein-Main-Donau-Kanal (Rhine‚ÄìMain‚ÄìDanube Canal) or Der Verstrahlte Gro√üvater (the radioactive grandfather). It was also the time of the most controversies (see below). Change of personnel Franz Josef Strau√ü was an outspoken and harsh critic of the show. In 2003 Hildebrandt decided to leave the show due to his advanced age. The show was taken over by Bruno Jonas, who had been co-host since 2000, Mathias Richling, and Georg Schramm. It was now produced by Bayerischer Rundfunk in collaboration with RBB, and filmed alternately in Berlin and Munich. In 2006, Georg Schramm left the show due to differences in opinion with respect to the format of the show. He was replaced by Richard Rogler who himself left the show again in 2008. By the end of 2008, Bruno Jonas, who had been a regular on the show since 1985, left the show, with Richling remaining as the sole host. End of the show In 2008, Hildebrandt, who had been holding the rights to the name Scheibenwischer since 1980, forbade the further use of the name for the show because Richling wanted to change the nature of the program to feature more stand-up comedy guests. The show was terminated in February 2008 and was replaced by Satire Gipfel (satire summit) with Richling again as host. Political scandals In 1982, the sketch Rhein-Main-Donau-Kanal was broadcast, addressing the corruption charges against members of the governing Christian Social Union of Bavaria who were involved with companies building the Rhine‚ÄìMain‚ÄìDanube Canal (the canal was a favorite project of the Bavarian government). The broadcast led to several complaints by the involved members with SFB, but ultimately only served to make the show more popular. On 22 May 1986, Bayerischer Rundfunk (BR), being the relaying network for the ARD in Bavaria and at that time still closely linked to the Christian Social Union of Bavaria, cut broadcasting the show across the whole ARD.A Cabarettist of the Old School Helmut Oeller, the program director for BR, justified the move saying that the sketch Der Verstrahlte Gro√üvater (The Radioactive Grandfather), performed in response to the Chernobyl disaster, contained \\"non-community-friendly elements\\". The sketch, written by Werner Koczwara, starred Lisa Fitz at the phone calling the Commission for Radiation Protection and asking whether her 91-year-old grandfather \\"who had inadvertently been left out on the veranda in the rain and had died soon after, could be buried normally\\" or if he should be handled as \\"hazardous waste\\"; and if the priest must hold his sermon in a radiation protection suit.Transcritp of the sketch at sowi-online.de Oeller's request to have the sketch removed from the show was unsuccessful. The failure to broadcast the program in Bavaria led to harsh criticism and claims of censorship against BR. The controversy triggered people to bring copies of the sketch into Bavaria for private screenings as well as artists refusing to work with BR again, and caused the Munich Abendzeitung to publish excerpts of the script.

A suicide car bomber attacked police headquarters, and at least 25 people were killed and 164 injured. It was the most serious terrorist attack in Ingushetia in the early 21st century, where there had been social and political unrest related to independence movements. The militant Islamist Caucasus Emirate claimed responsibility for the attack. Background  Attack  At 9:08 a.m.(MSK) on 17 August 2009, an unidentified militant drove a GAZelle truck into the gates of a police headquarters building in Nazran, Ingushetia's largest city. The attack occurred as police officers were lining up nearby for a morning briefing. Policemen fired at the car, but were unable to stop it. The blast, which reportedly had the force of 400 kg of dynamite, created a crater wide and deep, damaged the police headquarters building and nearby apartments. It also caused ammunition stored in the police headquarters to explode. Twenty people were reported to have been killed and 138 were injured.

Aftermath  The Ingush authorities announced a three-day mourning period. They promised to pay 100,000 rubles ($3,000 USD) and 50,000 rubles ($1,500 USD) in compensation to the families of those killed or injured. Russia's Ministry of Emergency Situations dispatched a plane to Ingushetia carrying medical specialists and aid for the victims. Following the attack, Russian President Dmitry Medvedev sacked Ingush Interior Minister Ruslan Meiriyev, saying that the attack could have been prevented. \\"This is the outcome not only of the problems related to terrorist attacks, but also of the republic law enforcement agencies' unsatisfactory work,\\" Medvedev said. German Chancellor Angela Merkel offered condolences to those affected by the attack. According to Vladimir Markin, a spokesman for the Prosecutor General's Office, the most likely motives for the bombings are revenge for the work carried out by the police against militants or an attempt to destabilize the situation in the region.

The Financial Times. August 18, 2009 On 19 August, President Dmitry Medvedev said that the continuing attacks against Ingush leadership, law enforcement officials and civilians must be dealt with severe punishment. He said that although external factors such as foreign funding for Islamist terrorists are also a concern, for the most part North Caucasus' security problems are the results of internal reasons such as corruption and socio- economic problems. \\"The roots are in the structure of our life, in unemployment, clans who could not care less about people and whose only concern is to how to divide the money poured in here, to get a contract and to settle scores with one another later, as well as corruption, which has really become very widespread among law enforcement authorities.\\" On 21 August, the militant Islamist Caucasus Emirate group claimed responsibility for the attack.

Although Chechen separatist activity was confirmed to be diminished due to the heavy-handed security measures undertaken by Chechen President Ramzan Kadyrov, violence in Chechnya has been replaced by Islamic insurgency in the neighbouring republics, Dagestan and Ingushetia. After the June attempt on President Yevkurov's life, there had been several incidents just days before the Nazran attack on 17 August. Several other leading Ingush officials have been assassinated since June 2009, including Deputy Chief Justice of the Supreme Court Aza Gazgireeva, former Deputy Prime Minister Bashir Aushev, the head of the Forensics and Investigations Center Magomed Gadaborshev, and Construction Minister Ruslan Amerkhanov.

It was the seat of the √ì Fionnachta chief of Clann Chonnmhaigh, one of the two main branches of this Connacht family. In 1232, Adam de Staunton fortified the site further as part of the Norman conquest, but this were retaken and demolished by the native O'Connors the following year. The rebuilt castle was occupied in 1294 by de Oddingseles. He died the following year. The de Birminghams then took over but it was again destroyed by the O'Connors and 1307 they were supplanted by a branch of the Burkes, the head of which was known as MacDavid. The MacDavid Burkes occupied it for the next 300 years. During the seventeenth century wars of conquest and dispossession a junior branch of the Caulfeild family came to own the castle and surrounding territory. They continued to own it throughout the Protestant Ascendancy. In late 1932, an IRA unit, under the command of Se√°n McCool and Mick Price, took over Donamon Castle to set up an IRA training camp. In 1939 the Divine Word Missionaries came to Ireland and purchased the castle from the Irish Land Commission. The Missionary Society constructed several new buildings to create a campus for training people before they went into the field. The Castle itself is still their home in Ireland.

In 1918, during the so-called \\"Aster Revolution\\" his career suddenly rocketed from colonel status to Secretary of War on 31 October 1918. He swore to the government of Mih√°ly K√°rolyi in front of the Hungarian Parliament on 2 November 1918. During the swearing-in ceremony (wearing a red tie) he spoke the infamous words: \\"[T]raditions of a thousand years and slavery of a thousand years had to be demolished. Five years of war were needed, thousands and thousands of deaths were needed so that a new victorious life could emerge from it. This new victorious life is born under pacifism.

The Hungarian Royal Honv√©d army still had more than 1,400,000 soldiers when Mih√°ly K√°rolyi was announced as prime minister of Hungary. K√°rolyi yielded to U.S. President Woodrow Wilson's demand for pacifism by ordering the disarmament of the Hungarian army. This happened under the direction of B√©la Linder, minister of war in the K√°rolyi government.Dixon J. C.

Due to the full disarmament of its army, Hungary was to remain without a national defence at a time of particular vulnerability. Military and political events drastically and rapidly changed after the Hungarian disarmament. On 5 November 1918, the Serbian army, with the help of the French army, crossed southern borders. On 8 November, the Czechoslovak Army crossed the northern borders, and on 13 November, the Romanian army crossed the eastern borders of the Kingdom of Hungary. On 13 November, K√°rolyi signed an armistice with the Allied nations in Belgrade. It limited the size of the Hungarian army to six infantry and two cavalry divisions.Krizman B. The Belgrade Armistice of 13 November 1918 in The Slavonic and East European Review January 1970, 48:110. Demarcation lines defining the territory to remain under Hungarian control were made. The lines would apply until definitive borders could be established. Under the terms of the armistice, Serbian and French troops advanced from the south, taking control of the Banat and Croatia. Czechoslovakia took control of Upper Hungary and Carpathian Ruthenia. Romanian forces were permitted to advance to the River Maros (Mure»ô) . However, on 14 November, Serbia occupied P√©cs.Breit J. Hungarian Revolutionary Movements of 1918‚Äì19 and the History of the Red War in Main Events of the K√°rolyi Era Budapest 1929. pp. 115‚Äì116. Referring to the negotiations with the Entente Cordiale, the Ministry of Military led by Linder sent a telegraph to the Foreign Office on 6 November 1918 to order the German troops onto the banks of Danube and Sava, which they refused.Istv√°n N√©meth: A Mackensen-√ºgy ‚Äì Egy hadsereg bolyong√°sa (Mackensen-case: Wandering of an Army) Later the complete honv√©ds of the ex-Austrian-Hungarian army were asked to return and to hand over all weapons. This led to Hungary being totally defenseless. During the rule of K√°rolyi's pacifist cabinet, Hungary lost the control over approx. 75% of its former pre-WW1 territories (325 411 km¬≤) without fight and was subject to foreign occupation. Minister without portfolio Criticised for his dilettantism, he resigned as Secretary of War on 9 November, but he kept his membership in the government. His task was to lead the negotiations for the preparations of the peace treaty. On 7 November there were already negotiations in Belgrade between the delegation led by Mih√°ly K√°rolyi and the commander of eastern Entente troops, general Franchet d'Esperey. On 13 November, Linder signed the Armistice of Belgrade together with General Henrys (commander of French Eastern Army) and voivode ≈Ωivojin Mi≈°iƒá (commander general of the Serb army). During the period of the Hungarian Soviet Republic, he was engaged in numerous diplomatic moves as the military attach√© of the Ministry of Military in Vienna (2 May ‚Äì 5 August 1919). Activities in Baranya, fleeing abroad After the collapse of the Hungarian Soviet Republic, he joined the Socialist Party, and on 23 September 1920 he became the mayor of P√©cs. At this time P√©cs was still occupied by the Serb army, even though there was a valid border agreement with Entente. Later he was the leader of the P√©cs-Baranya Republic and on 14 August 1921 of the Baranya‚ÄìBaja Serbian‚ÄìHungarian Republic. The latter republic was upheld for eight days, and its president was painter Petar Dobroviƒá. When the Serb troops left the Baranya region for Yugoslavia on 14 August 1921, Linder joined them. His remembrance Linder lived in Yugoslavia till his death. The Kingdom of Serbs, Croats and Slovenes and Josip Broz Tito's Yugoslavia honoured him for his activities between 1918-1919, and he received state funeral and a honorary tomb in Belgrade. However, Hungarians condemn him as he had a significant part in the borders of the Republic of Hungary being set disadvantageously at the Treaty of Trianon and Hungary had no armies to counter the inordinate demands of the Little Entente.

It was sanctioned by the International Baseball Federation. History Competitive international women‚Äôs baseball began when Japan sent a nationally selected squad, sponsored by a sports drink company named Team Energen, to Florida to participate in the North American Women's Baseball League‚Äôs 1999 South Florida Diamond Classic. At the 1999 South Florida Diamond Classic, Team Energen showed that they could play at the top level of women‚Äôs baseball. After a meeting between Japanese and American officials following the tournament, plans were initiated for a contest between a national women‚Äôs baseball team from the United States and Team Energen in Tokyo. In May 2000, a United States national women's baseball team flew to Tokyo and played the first competitive international women's baseball game on May 1 in the Seibu Dome against a nationally selected Team Energen squad. The Japanese team defeated the US team in front of 3,000 enthusiastic fans. Organisers were impressed at the success of the game and decided to organise an annual competition called the Women's World Series to be held in the United States or Canada in the summer of 2001. After discussions over the summer with women‚Äôs baseball program organisers within the AWBF, Baseball Ontario, the Baseball Victoria (Australia) and the Baseball Federation of Japan plans were developed for the 2001 Women's World Series in Toronto. The Toronto Blue Jays agreed that several games including the championship game of the 2001 Women‚Äôs World Series would be played in the Toronto SkyDome. This proved to be an irresistible venue for attracting Japanese and Australian teams to North America. Australia selected their national women's team from a tryout process woven into their women's first Australian women's national baseball championship. The Australian Baseball Federation selected and trained the team which entered the 2001 Women's World Series. Baseball Canada also selected and trained a women's national team in 2001. Canada dropped out of international competitions after a disappointing fourth-place finish and did not resume play until the 2004 Women's World Series in Uozu City, Japan. The American Women‚Äôs Baseball Federation (AWBF) with the help of the Roy Hobbs Baseball organization selected and organized the 2001 United States team through tryouts held in several areas of the country. A team ranging in ages from 15-41 represented the United States well eventually winning the inaugural 2001 Women‚Äôs World Series. The 2002 Women's World Series was played in St. Petersburg, Florida with Japan, Australia and the United States entering teams. In the Gold Medal game played at Tropicana Field following a Major League Baseball game Australia defeated Japan 7-4. The 2003 Women‚Äôs World Series was hosted by Australia and was played August 25‚Äì30 on the Gold Coast in Queensland at the Australian Baseball Federation national training site, Palm Meadows Baseball Complex. Japan was to host the 2003 event originally, but the SARS virus closed that venue in June 2003. Teams from the United States, Australia and Japan accepted. Japan won the 2003 Women‚Äôs World Series defeating Australia 4-2. Following the 2003 Women‚Äôs World Series representatives from the three countries met to discuss whether the 2004 Women‚Äôs World Series would be rescheduled because of the newly sanctioned IBAF 2004 Women's Baseball World Cup. The three country representatives and the IBAF agreed to reschedule the event for July 16‚Äì23, 2004 as to honour commitments to the World Cup. Eight teams played in the 2004 Women's World Series. This enormously successful event witnessed new teams from Korea, India, Hong Kong and Chinese Taipei (Taiwan).

Defection  On August 13, 1967, the anniversary of construction beginning of the Berlin Wall five years earlier, Sch√∂lzel decided to desert from the West German Army, and then defected to communist East Germany. Sch√∂lzel worked as a laborer in Leipzig until he began studying philosophy at Humboldt University in East Berlin in 1970, earning his diploma in 1974 and a doctorate in 1982, later becoming employed as a research assistant at the university.  Stasi informant  Sch√∂lzel was recruited by the East German government under the Socialist Unity Party (SED) as an informant for the country's domestic intelligence agency, the Stasi, receiving the code name \\"Andr√© Holzer\\". At Humboldt University, Sch√∂lzel infiltrated opposition groups where he reported on the activities of numerous individuals, including Wolfgang Templin. Stefan Wolle of the Research Network on the Communist State (Forschungsverbund SED- Staat) at the Free University of Berlin described Sch√∂lzel as an informant who \\"...with real enthusiasm and great perfidiousness, he went behind the backs of the people with whom he was friends.\\"https://www.welt.de/politik/article787242/Die_schoene_junge_Welt_der_Stasiveteranen.html He maintained being an informant for the Stasi until 1989, shortly before East Germany was dissolved the following year.  Post-reunification activity  After the Reunification of Germany, Sch√∂lzel was suspended from his job at Humboldt University in 1991 and dishonourably discharged in 1994, due to his activities as an informant for the Stasi. Sch√∂lzel's informant activities were the subject of a documentary film, Verraten ‚Äì sechs Freunde und ein Spitzel, broadcast by ARD in 2007. In the film, Arnold Sch√∂lzel acknowledged having been an informant for the Stasi, and when asked by film-maker Inga Wolfram why he had betrayed his friends, he replied: \\"Well, you betrayed 17 million people\\", referring to the population of East Germany.http://www.taz.de/?id=start&art;=1739&id;=497&cHash;=85d148a5d6 In 1997, Sch√∂lzel became the feuilleton editor of Junge Welt, the largest far- left newspaper in Germany, and in February 2000 he became editor-in-chief. The newspaper is under observation by the Bundesamt f√ºr Verfassungsschutz, who categorized it as left-wing extremist, and was described by the conservative German newspaper Die Welt as being dominated by former members of the Stasi.

Life Ezechiele Ramin was born in Padua (in the Veneto region of Italy) in 1953, the fourth of six sons in a modest family. He studied at a Liceo classico in a Catholic school (Collegio Vescovile Gregorio Barbarigo) where he became aware of the poverty widespread throughout the world. This pushed him to join the charity Mani Tese (\\"Outstretched Hands\\"), organising several camps to collect funds in order to support small projects related to the association. In 1972, he decided to join the religious institute of the Comboni Missionaries of the Heart of Jesus; his studies brought him to move first to Florence, then to Venegono Inferiore (in the Province of Varese) and finally to Chicago, where he graduated from Catholic Theological Union and served in the St. Ludmila Parish. After having experienced missionary work with impoverished Native Americans in South Dakota and later, for one year, in Baja California (Mexico), he was ordained a priest on September 28, 1980 in his native Padua. He was assigned to a parish in Naples but, following the 1980 Irpinia earthquake, he moved to San Mango sul Calore to assist the victims; he returned to Naples in 1981 where he organised one of the first pacific demonstrations against camorra. The following year he moved to Troia in Apulia, where he acted as a focal point for vocational groups. Cacoal In 1984, he was assigned to Cacoal, in Rond√¥nia (Brazil). On January 20, 1984 he moved to Bras√≠lia, where he underwent further education in pastoral care, and finally reached Rond√¥nia in July of that year. He seemed wary of the situation in Cacoal, but accepted his assignment with the words \\"If Christ needs me, how can I refuse?\\" There he encountered a difficult situation: the many small farmers of the area were oppressed, through both legal and illegal actions, by the local landowners. Also, the indigenous Suru√≠ tribes had only recently been forced to become sedentary by being allocated land by the Brazilian government and were growing restless. Inspired by the teachings of Dietrich Bonhoeffer, he put himself to the front in their struggle for justice, trying to lead them to a pacific protest rather than to start an armed revolution. The situation he was in brought him to fear for his life. In early 1985 he was threatened with being killed; in many of the letters he wrote to his family in that year he wonders if he will ever see them again. Death and aftermath On July 24, 1985, Father Ramin, alongside the local trade union leader Adilio de Souza, chaired a meeting in Fazenda Catuva in Ji-Paran√°, in the nearby state of Rond√¥nia, trying to persuade the small farmers employed there to avoid taking arms against the landowners, going against a request of caution issued by his superiors. On his way back with de Souza, at midday, he was attacked by seven pistoleros (hired gunmen) who shot him more than 50 times. Before dying, he whispered the words \\"I forgive you\\". As Father Ramin's body couldn't be recovered by his fellow missionaries for about 24 hours after his death, a group of Suru√≠ indios kept vigil until their arrival. He was buried in the Padua Cemetery. Some days after the event Pope John Paul II declared Ramin a \\"martyr of charity\\". Dom Ivo Lorscheiter, the then-President of CNBB (the National Conference of Brazilian Bishops), took inspiration from Father Ramin's murder to urge the Brazilian society to work towards a deep \\"structural change\\". The reaction to Father Ramin's murder by the local farmers went against his teachings: in November of the same year a landowner and his general manager were killed by the same people Father Ramin had been trying to help, and some days later another farm manager was shot. In 1988, two of the men who shot Father Ramin ‚Äì Deuzelio Goncalves Fraga and Altamiro Flauzino ‚Äì were condemned to respectively 24 and 25 years' imprisonment by the Cuiab√° tribunal. Others have not been identified nor arrested. Some years after Father Ramin's death another Comboni priest from Padua, Father Pietro Settin, visited the area where Ramin was murdered, discovering that Adilio de Souza, the union leader who had been with Father Ramin on the day of his death, had become the owner of a piece of land. Father Settin theorized that he might have received it in exchange for betraying Father Ramin. Other activities Father Ezechiele Ramin's main hobbies were cycling and playing football; he also wrote poetry. His numerous letters to his friends and family were collected and published in a volume edited by Ercole Ongaro and by Father Ramin's brother Fabiano, entitled Testimone della speranza ‚Äì lettere dal 1971 al 1985 (Witness of Hope ‚Äì Letters 1971 ‚Äì 1985). Several of them (in Italian) are publicly available. He also produced a considerable number of drawings, especially in charcoal, that were the subject of an exhibition held in 2010 in his native city of Padua, promoted by the local Comune (municipality) and organised by Maria Cristina Ferin, Federica Millozzi and Fabiano Ramin. Several of them had already been collected in a book and published.Ezechiele Ramin (pub. Oct 2005), \\"Frammenti di un mosaico. Disegni\\", ed. Imprimenda, Limena (PD), He documented his experiences through photography. Tributes Several initiatives in honour of Father Ezechiele Ramin are regularly held both in his native Padua and in Cacoal, mostly linked to promoting peaceful protest instead of armed revolution and to awakening the young people's awareness and interest in the missionary world. In 2005 ‚Äì the twentieth anniversary of his death ‚Äì he was remembered by Padua Archbishop Antonio Mattiazzo in an initiative about modern martyrs; in the same year, a bronze sculpture by Ettore Grego in Father Ezechiele's memory was unveiled by Padua Mayor Flavio Zanonato in Piazza San Giuseppe, in front of the church Father Ramin used to frequent as a child and young man. Also in 2005, Catholic Theological Union in Chicago, where Father Ramin studied, commissioned an icon bearing his image by the renowned icon painter Robert Lentz, who represented Father Ramin with a turtle dove to symbolise his belief in nonviolence. The presence of a halo around Father Ezechiele's head is, however, improper according to the Catholic iconography, as Father Ramin has not been officially recognised as a Saint. Lentz, though, has often added halos to icons representing martyrs not conventionally recognised as saints, such as Albert Einstein, C√©sar Ch√°vez and He»ü√°ka S√°pa (Black Elk). In 2010 he and Sister Dorothy Stang were chosen by the Comboni missionaries in Brazil as symbols of the local people's struggle for land ownership. Besides a collection of his letters to friends and family, three further books about Father Ramin's life have been published: Lele ‚Äì creare primavera (Lele ‚Äì Creating Spring), by Ezio Sorio,Ezio Sorio (1989), \\"Lele ‚Äì creare primavera\\", ed. EMI, Bologna, Lele vive (Lele Is Alive), by Paulo Lima (2005),Paulo Lima (2005), \\"Lele Vive\\", ed. EMI, Bologna, and Ezechiele Ramin: la forza di una testimonianza (Ezechiele Ramin: the Strength of a Witness) by fellow Comboni missionary Giovanni Munari.Giovanni Munari (2006), \\"Ezechiele Ramin: la forza di una testimonianza\\", ed. EMI, Bologna, In 1998 RAI, the Italian national television network, commissioned La casa bruciata, a TV movie inspired by his life. It was directed by Massimo Spano with a soundtrack by Ennio Morricone and featured Giulio Scarpati. In late 2011 a musical reading of selected passages from Ezechiele Ramin testimone della speranza. Lettere e scritti 1971 ‚Äì 1985 was organized in Padova on Human Rights Day, with actor Andrea Pennacchi and the international \\"music collective\\" Luomodellazappa. Two Italian Comuni named a street after \\"Padre Ezechiele Ramin\\": Padua, the city of his birth, and Rome. Cadoneghe, in the province of Padua, dedicated an auditorium to him and Padua named a nursery school after him. Again in Padua, the non-profit association Angoli di Mondo (Corners of the World) opened a public information centre, the Centro di Documentazione Ezechiele Ramin. The parish of Saint Richard of Andria in Andria (in Apulia) dedicated its meeting and recreation room to Father Ezechiele Ramin. In Brazil, in Picos (Piau√≠), the Angoli di Mondo association supported the building and activation of a day care centre for street children that was named after Father Ramin. Beatification cause The Comboni missionaries, led by Superior General Father Teresino Serra, are trying to advance the cause for Father Ezechiele's martyrdom (and therefore his status as a Blessed and possibly as a Saint) to be formally recognised by the Catholic Church, although as to the Comboni missionary community in Latin America \\"for them and the people who knew him, Ramin is already a saint\\". He is considered a \\"witness of the faith\\".

They are one of the two major historical ringing Societies based in London, the other being the Ancient Society of College Youths. Formation of the Society It is claimed, SRCY History that a prominent London ringing Society, known as the London Scholars, rang the bells at Shoreditch church as William Augustus, Duke of Cumberland and second son of George II, passed by on his return from the Battle of Culloden in April 1746. Victory was hailed everywhere and it became popular to adopt the name 'Cumberland' at every opportunity and thus the London Scholars changed their name. Whether or not the Society of Royal Cumberland Youths (The word 'Royal' was added in the 1870s) descends from the London Scholars, there is no doubt about the foundation of the Society in its present form, which, according to the original Name Book, now housed in the Guildhall Library, was on 6 September 1747. The early Society The lists of members from the first century of the Society's existence shows that at that time it attracted some of the great names in ringing history, such as John Reeves, George Gross and William Shipway, and records of the many first performances achieved at that time still exist in the ringing chambers of City churches. Gross's outstanding achievement, remarkable in its time, was the celebrated peal of 12,000 Oxford Treble Bob Royal, CCCBR records of 12,000 Oxford TB Royal at Shoreditch, 1784 at Shoreditch on 27 March 1784, in 9 hours and 5 minutes, which he conducted. The Society marked the 200th anniversary of this peal with one of 12,000 Middlesex Surprise Royal on 27 March 1984. In 1896 the Society welcomed its first female member, Mrs George Williams. At this time women were still excluded from ringing societies, which were typically male-only organisations. Mrs Williams was the first lady to ring a peal. London towers The Headquarters of the SRCY is St Martin-in-the- Fields, and it looks after Shoreditch. It also has strong connections with Spitalfields, Holborn and Clerkenwell. Publicity While the SRCY is a London-based Society, it has two Country meetings every year, SRCY About Us (March and July) to different parts of the UK so it's easier for other members to take part. There have been several tours to the US and Australia in recent times, which has resulted in US based members getting together on their own accord. During the 2010 National 12 Bell Eliminators, held on 27 March, the SRCY hosted the Eliminator at Shoreditch. During this event ITV London Tonight covered part of the event, including interviewing the Master at the time, Mary Holden.

Operators The boat companies running services include the London Waterbus Company, the Jenny Wren and Jason's Canal Boat Trips. The companies operate on the canal under licence from Canal and River Trust, and are run independently of other London public transport services and therefore cannot use Oyster Cards or contactless payment on these services. Vessels A water bus near London Zoo The London Waterbus Company has a fleet of four traditional canal barges or narrowboats which have been converted to carry passengers as a water bus service. Two of the vessels are of historic interest and are noted on the National Register of Historic Ships. Services The London Waterbus Company runs daily scheduled water bus services all year round, with regular services running between Camden Lock and Little Venice, as well as Zoo Express services into London Zoo (including zoo admission). They have online ticketing with additional limited walk up availability for seats with card payments onboard. The Jenny Wren operates a similar route, offering a scheduled pleasure cruise service from Camden Lock to Little Venice and back with a tour guide. During the winter months, the boat is available for private hire only. Jason's Trip has operated public trips from Little Venice to Camden since 1951. Jason operates from the first weekend in April to the first weekend in November. Route At the western end of the canal, water bus services run from the area known as \\"Little Venice\\" in Maida Vale, north-west London, at the junction of the Regent's Canal and the Grand Union Canal. This part of the canal was originally called Browning's Pool, after the English poet Robert Browning who lived here from 1862 to 1887, and who is believed to have coined the name \\"Little Venice\\".Little Venice Music Festival From Little Venice, the canal passes under the ancient Roman Road of Watling Street (today the A5 road) through the Maida Hill tunnel, and then passes through St John's Wood, curving parallel to Prince Albert Road around the northern edge of Regent's Park. The London Zoo water bus stop lies on the zoo side of the canal and can only be accessed by London Zoo visitors (there is no access to Regent's Park without buying a zoo ticket). At the Cumberland Turn, the junction with the former Cumberland Basin, the canal bends left past a floating Chinese restaurant. The service terminates at the Grade II listed Camden Lock, only twin-lock remaining on the Canal. The locks were constructed in 1818-20 by James Morgan, and are located in the popular Camden Town area.

He was a top contender in the F.I.M. 500cc Motocross World Championship during the late 1960s and early 1970s where, he placed five times in the top five including two second place finishes. __TOC__ Motorcycle racing career Banks was the son of a successful builder from Bury St Edmunds. His first motorcycle was a Greeves trials motorcycle that he bought from Dave Bickers, the 1960 and 1961 European motocross champion. He then gained a sponsorship from the Dot motorcycle company and in 1963 he placed third at the Swiss Grand Prix just after turning 19. His impressive results led to an offer to ride for the BSA factory racing team in 1966 as a teammate to Jeff Smith. He contested a few rounds of the 1967 500cc motocross world championship scoring a third place at the Luxembourg Grand Prix and, placing 12th in the season final points standing. He won the 1967-1968 BBC Grandstand winter series to claim his first major victory. Entering the 1968 season, Banks faced strong competition from the defending world champion Paul Friedrichs and his ƒåZ teammate Roger De Coster as well as the Swedish Husqvarna team riders Bengt √Öberg and √Öke Jonsson. He won his first individual race victory in the second moto of the Finnish Grand Prix where he relegated Friedrichs to second place. He won his first-ever overall world championship race at the ninth round of the series with a victory at the French Grand Prix and, followed one week later with a victory at the Dutch Grand Prix. The setting of round 10 at the Belgian Grand Prix was a rugged, narrow track in the forests surrounding the picturesque hilltop Citadel of Namur. Banks would claim the championship points lead from Jonsson with a second place finish in Belgium as Jonsson suffered mechanical malfunctions. Banks finished third behind Vic Eastwood and Friedrichs at the penultimate round in Luxembourg. Going into the final race of the season, Banks held a slim points lead over Friedrichs and Jonsson. Friedrichs came out on top by winning the last race of the season to win the 1968 world championship by one point over Banks. Banks began the 1969 season strongly with second place finishes at the season opening Austrian Grand Prix and in round 3 at the Dutch Grand Prix then, scored consecutive victories at the Czechoslovakian and Russian Grands Prix. After finishing second to De Coster at the Belgian Grand Prix, his luck began to change. He suffered an ignition failure in the West German Grand Prix, had a tire puncture in Luxembourg then, suffered another ignition failure in the French Grand Prix. Finally, at the Swiss Grand Prix he punctured another tire, allowing Bengt √Öberg to overtake him to win the 1969 500cc motocross world championship. Banks suffered a dislocated knee during the 1970 season that forced him to miss the world championships. He returned from his injury to place second behind BSA teammate Dave Nicoll in the 1970 Trans-AMA motocross series, established by the American Motorcyclist Association as a pilot event to help establish motocross in the United States. By the late 1960s, advances in two stroke engine technology meant that the heavier, four stroke machines such as Banks' BSA, were becoming obsolete in the motocross world championships. In the middle of the 1971 season, BSA announced that they were ceasing operations, leaving Banks unemployed. He would complete the remainder of the season riding as a privateer on a Husqvarna motorcycle. At the end of the world championships, he returned to the United States where, he rode a ƒåZ motorcycle to once again finished as runner-up in the 1971 Trans-AMA series, this time to Suzuki rider Sylvain Geboers. 1973 Cheney 500 cc BSA B50 Victor He then accepted an offer from designer Eric Cheney to campaign BSA B50 motorcycles in the 1973 FIM Motocross World Championship. Despite the BSA's weight handicap, Banks still managed several top five placings in the world championships against lighter, two stroke motorcycles, including an impressive performance at the 1973 500cc United States Grand Prix in Southern California where, on the hard packed desert terrain, the explosive power delivery of two stroke engines put them at a disadvantage to more tractable power delivery of Banks' BSA. He finished the first moto in third place behind Willy Bauer and Roger De Coster then, finished the second moto in fourth place behind Bauer, Gerrit Wolsink and Jaak van Velthoven. After two seasons riding for Cheney, in 1975 Banks switched to CCM motorcycles, also powered by BSA engines. He managed some impressive results in 1977 including, a fourth place in Canada and an inspired performance at the 500cc British Grand Prix where he finished the second moto in second place behind Heikki Mikkola on a Yamaha and ahead of fellow countryman Graham Noyce on a Honda. 1977 would be his final season in the motocross world championships. During his motorcycle racing career, Banks won four British 500cc motocross championships, four BBC Grandstand trophy titles, two World of Sport championships, was named East Anglian Sports Personality of the Year, and was twice the runner-up in the 500cc motocross world championship. His son, Mark Banks won the 1988 125cc British motocross national championship and, his grandson Elliot Banks Browne won the 2012 MX2 British national championship.

(Although not explicitly recognized as a founder, Dave Room helped build the Institute from months of its inception into a funded organization.) Its initial purpose was to implement programs to educate the public on issues surrounding global fossil fuel depletion (see peak oil, peak coal, peak gas) and climate change, as well as on possible responses to these challenges. A key tool for this was a film called \\"The End of Suburbia,\\" which featured Richard Heinberg and James Howard Kunstler among others. Post Carbon promoted the concept of Relocalization, a strategy to build community resilience based on the local production of food, energy, and goods, and the development of more localized governance, economy, and culture.Vancouver Straight (2009-07-23). Hello local, goodbye global: Relocalization movement gains momentum Post Carbon Institute was one of the few organizations in this period actively promoting the concept of peak oil, along with groups such as the Association for the Study of Peak Oil and Gas, the International Forum on Globalization, and the Transition Towns movement, and websites such as EnergyBulletin.net and The Oil Drum.

Early success He was born in Hope, North Dakota in 1898 and originally worked as an assistant director during the silent era. In 1929 he directed his first film, the comedy Three Live Ghosts. He enjoyed an early success with the Eddie Cantor Technicolor musical Whoopie! (1930) and much of his subsequent work was in musicals and comedies. In 1933, he directed Flying Down to Rio which launched the screen partnership of Fred Astaire and Ginger Rogers although it had originally been designed as a starring vehicle for the Mexican actress Dolores del R√≠o.Robinson p.232 The following year Freeland made a film version of the long-running Broadway revue George White's Scandals. Britain In 1935 Freeland went to London to make the musical comedy Brewster's Millions starring Jack Buchanan.Marshall p.77 He was to work in Britain for the remainder of the decade. In 1936 he made Accused at Isleworth Studios, which was produced by and starred his fellow American Douglas Fairbanks, Jr. who had also moved to Britain at the time. A Paris-set murder mystery, the film also featured Dolores Del Rio. He directed Fairbanks again in the costume drama The Amateur Gentleman the same year. Britain was experiencing a major boom in filmmaking at the time, and many of Freeland's projects were made with an eye to the international market. However he also directed comedies with more local appeal such as Skylarks (1936) featuring Nervo and Knox and Hold My Hand (1938) with Stanley Lupino. During his time in England Freeland worked for a variety of companies, many of which were independents which had been established during the boom. Amongst these was Capitol Films for whom he made Jericho, a drama with Paul Robeson. By 1937 the boom was over and his final films in England were made by better-established studios such as London Films and Associated British. His last film to be released in the decade was a Jack Buchanan comedy-thriller The Gang's All Here. Later career He returned to the United States during World War II, and made two films in Hollywood. In the late 1940s he returned to Britain to make a final three films. Following the release of the comedy Dear Mr. Prohack (1949) he retired from directing. He was married to the American actress June Clyde.IMDB entryBFI Database Like her husband Clyde spent much of the 1930s working in British films. Filmography * Three Live Ghosts (1929) * Whoopee!

APPRO is registered with the Ministry of Economy of Afghanistan as a not-for-profit organization and headquartered in Kabul, Afghanistan. Mission APPRO's mission is to facilitate critical dialogue on policy and reconstruction issues. This mission has two components. The first component is to measure development progress against strategic reconstruction objectives and provide insights into how to improve performance against the milestones set by the Government of Afghanistan and the international donors. The second component is to train and mentor a pool of Afghan researchers to conduct research consistent with internationally recognized standards for social scientific research. Research at APPRO is undertaken to address existing and pressing knowledge gaps in the policy making process and to advance the learning of researchers, academics, and decision and policy makers at all levels.

Understanding Gender in Agricultural Production: A Review of the Literature and a Conceptual Framework Understanding Gender in Agricultural Production: An Annotated Bibliography for the Case of Afghanistan Research areas APPROResearch at APPRO conducts research on the crosscutting themes of Aid Effectiveness, Rights Issues and Development, Political Economy, Governance, and Natural Resource and Environmental Management. The research is designed and carried out to promote dialogue and collaboration between parties with varying agendas who share a focus on reconstruction. All research projects are conducted from a systems perspective. APPRO recognizes that in any policy environment intended solutions create new and unaccounted for problems. As a result, research at APPRO is focused on the close examination of the interface between new and pre-existing forms of organization. Particular attention is thus paid to identifying and mapping autochthonous structures and optimal ways in which policy solutions are absorbed by the system to establish what works and why. Aid effectiveness Work under Aid Effectiveness is intended to inform the government, civil society, and the international development community about successes and pitfalls of aid through a systemic examination of the flows, processes, and outputs of the aid system. To this end, APPRO has evaluated a large number of programs and projects implemented by national and international organizations in Afghanistan since 2001. While the findings from these evaluations remain confidential to APPRO's clients, the evaluations have provided APPRO with in-depth insights into operational issues and challenges associated with development aid provision in a variety of contexts including humanitarian aid, women's rights, vocational training, security sector reform, access to justice, natural resource management and education. Based on the learning from these evaluations, APPRO provides training modules on the dynamics of the policy process and program / project design. Rights issues and development This theme examines socio-economic, civil and political issues from a human rights perspective. Afghanistan has signed a number of international conventions promoting social and economic, civil and political rights. Research under this theme is intended to enhance understanding and appreciation of the barriers in meeting human rights objectives in reconstruction efforts. The research also aims to increase consensus on how national and international programs and projects in Afghanistan can work more strategically and coherently to integrate human rights in reconstruction programming. To date, APPRO has carried out a number of research projects on protection issues, including women's access to justice and security sector reform. Political economy This theme explores the organization of economic activity in rural and urban settings in Afghanistan at the macro-, meso- and micro-scales of analysis. APPRO views the Afghan political economy as a product of the interaction between various economic actors with vested interests constrained or enabled by different factors. Effecting change in the political economy thus requires in-depth understanding of the physical and material conditions, the institutions of governance and the policy decisions. To date, APPRO has carried out a number of research projects on informal labor markets, micro enterprises, urban economic development, service provision in urban areas, rural economic development, and value chain analysis of selected agricultural products. Governance This theme examines the dynamics of societal and organizational transformation toward a legitimate, democratic, desirable and sustainable mode of governance, paying particular attention to the formal and informal institutions through which governance is exercised, changes that result in a more convincing system of government, and efforts likely to increase general consent about and legitimacy of the governing bodies. Studies under this theme place particular emphasis on the linkages between governance and its institutions and the trade-offs that need to be made between social, economic, environmental and political considerations and priorities. Governance is researched at multiple jurisdictional scales descriptively (i.e., governance of) and normatively (i.e., governance for). Based on this holistic view of governance, APPRO provides training on the policy process and institutional analysis to governmental and non-governmental bodies. Natural resource and environmental management This theme focuses on how the sustainability of resource use and environmental management can be increased through adopting a mix of traditional and modern (technological) approaches. APPRO's research under this theme emphasizes the crucial linkages that need to be made between modern approaches to natural resource management and generations-old and (often) sustainable resource use and coping strategies. The scale of analysis ranges from organizational (e.g., enterprise production) to sub-national and national. At all scales of analysis a lifecycle approach is adopted to map and analyze processes to establish where efficiencies can be incorporated into the system, how equity in resource use can be increased, and how adverse environmental impacts can be eliminated, minimized or managed. To date APPRO has applied this approach to examining the impact of climate change on agricultural production, gender and agricultural production, and the agricultural innovation systems for selected products. These studies have focused on the innovative capacity, coping strategies, and system resiliencies exhibited by rural communities when subjected to shocks such as climate change.

The species was first described by Augustus Radcliffe Grote in 1874. It is found from Newfoundland west to the Pacific coast and Vancouver Island and Haida Gwaii, British Columbia, south to North Carolina and Colorado. Acronicta hesperida was formerly considered to be a separate species, but is now considered a synonym. The wingspan is 45‚Äì55 mm. Adults are on wing from May to July in one generation depending on the location. The larvae feed on alder, birch, poplar, hawthorn and willow. They have fine hairs that are actually hollow, containing a toxin within. If direct contact is made through handling or even indirect contact through clothing, shaking a tree branch with a alder dagger caterpillar on it can result in exposure to these fine hairs. Mild to severe rashes may appear for up to a week and may spread easily to other areas of the body through clothing rubbing on exposed area or scratching. Some people react more seriously while others have no reaction at all. Applying strong adhesive tape to the area immediately after exposure may help to remove the fine hairs from your skin/clothes.

Early life and education  Igor Linshits was born into a family of engineers in Rustavi, Georgia. After finishing school in Rustavi, Linshits moved to Moscow to study chemical engineering at the Lomonosov Institute of Fine Chemical Technology, graduating in 1988.  Career in Russia  In 1988, Linshits established his first business manufacturing hairbrushes and combs. In 1990, he and his partners started a business in trading and processing oil products that quickly grew into one of the largest businesses of its kind in Russia. In 1993, he spun off from his partners to establish his own business, Neftyanoi. Neftyanoi initially focused on trading commodities, especially oil products such as wheat and cotton, before moving into direct investments. Its most prominent deals involved Lukoil-Neftekhim and mail.ru. In the late 1990s, Linshits invested in a petrochemical plant. Then, in partnership with Lukoil, he established Lukoil-Neftekhim, previously known in English as Lukoil Chemical. Linshits sold his shares to Lukoil in 2000. Also in 2000, in cooperation with Yuri Milner, he bought a 10% stake in mail.ru, then a largely unknown Russian internet portal. Over the next few years, he increased his ownership stake to more than 30%. Together with Milner, Linshits took an active role in the development of mail.ru, now Russia‚Äôs second largest internet company by revenue. While in Moscow, Linshits developed a number of real estate projects. The largest was Silver City; a 60,000 square meter, class A office building located in the center of Moscow.  Career in the U.K.  In 2009, Linshits immigrated to the U.K., where he became a citizen and founded Delin Capital, a private investment company that includes Delin Capital Asset Management (DCAM) https://dc-am.co.uk/ and Delin Ventures. Linshits established DCAM to capitalize on ecommerce‚Äôs impact on commercial real estate. Today DCAM is a leading pan-European investor, developer, and manager of logistics real estate. In 2017, DCAM concluded a partnership with Blackstone to acquire prime logistics assets in Germany, Benelux, and the U.K. Linshits currently serves as Chairman of the Investment Committee at DCAM. Linshits established Delin Ventures as a follow-up to his success with mail.ru. Delin Ventures, an early-stage technology investor, supports emerging venture fund managers as well as making direct investments in early-stage technology companies.

Personal life  In 2004, Linshits appointed his close friend Boris Nemtsov, a well-known and outspoken member of the Russian opposition, as the Chairman of Neftyanoi. Nemtsov was assassinated in 2015 by unknown parties. Subsequent to Nemtsov‚Äôs appointment, the Russian authorities accused Linshits and a number of employees of a subsidiary of banking regulation violations.https://neftegaz.ru/en/press/view/2228 In 2006, Linshits chose to emigrate from Russia.

It was the first time that a foreign military unit, the First Czechoslovak Independent Field Battalion, fought together with the Red Army. Under the command of Ludv√≠k Svoboda, later President of Czechoslovakia, the Czechoslovak soldiers delayed the advance of Germans to the Mzha river. On 13 March the position was abandoned as untenable due to the complete German encirclement of Kharkov.  Aftermath  The Soviet supreme command highly valued both the bravery of the Czechoslovak soldiers and the political significance of the fact that the Soviet people were no longer alone in their struggle against Germany. First Lieutenant Otakar Jaro≈°, the commander of the 1st company (who was killed in the course of the battle and posthumously promoted to captain) was the first foreign citizen ever to be awarded the highest Soviet military order, the Hero of the Soviet Union. Moreover, one of the local schools in Sokolovo was named in his honor. The initial personnel of the Czechoslovak army was heavily composed of Jewish refugees, but after the liberation of Ukraine many Volhynian Czechs were drafted into the army, leading to an increase in antisemitism. Svoboda attempted to counter this with an antisemitic show trial of Maxmilian Holzer, who was blamed for the defeat at Sokolovo, at which Svoboda served as the main witness. Holzer was sentenced to death but \\"volunteered\\" to a penal unit, to which he was reportedly sent with a note that he not return alive. At a 1963 press conference, Svoboda claimed that this incident occurred because of a misunderstanding. In popular culture Florenc Station of Prague's Metro The Battle of Sokolovo was widely celebrated under the post-war communist regime in Czechoslovakia as an example of Soviet-Czechoslovak comradeship. The town of Falkenau an der Eger in Karlovy Vary Region was renamed Sokolov in 1948 after the expulsion of Germans from Czechoslovakia. A prominent street in Prague was renamed Sokolovsk√° street and a mosaic depicting the battle in the socialist realism style was inaugurated in the Florenc metro station in the city. The battle became the subject matter of a 1974 Czechoslovak film with the same name, directed by Otakar V√°vra. See also Marie Ljalkov√°, Czech sniper who became famous for her actions at Sokolovo.

The project is considered abandonware as no information has been released by developers since 2016 and the official website is down. A \\"FreeArc Next\\" version is under development, with version FA 0.11 released in October 2016. The \\"Next\\" version supports 32- and 64-bit Windows and Linux and includes Zstandard support.FA 0.11 release notes, Bulat Ziganshin Algorithms FreeArc uses LZMA, prediction by partial matching, TrueAudio, Tornado and GRzip algorithms with automatic switching by file type. Additionally, it uses filters to further improve compression, including REP (finds repetitions at separations up to 1gb), DICT (dictionary replacements for text), DELTA (improves compression of tables in binary data), BCJ (executables preproccesor) and LZP (removes repetitions in text). Benchmarks Archive size In 2010 Tom's Hardware benchmarks comparing it to the other popular archivers, FreeArc narrowly outperformed WinZip, 7-Zip, and WinRAR in its \\"best compression\\" mode. In the \\"default compression\\" tests, it lost to 7-Zip's LZMA2, but still compressed better than WinRAR and WinZip. Speed In the same Tom's Hardware tests, FreeArc was outpaced at default settings by 7zip's LZMA2 default compression, and also by WinRAR, even at its best compression settings. FreeArc's compression at its best settings was slower than both 7zip and WinRAR, but still came ahead of WinZip. Efficiency In a metric devised by Werner Bergmans of Maximum Compression Benchmark, FreeArc compression is more efficient than programs for classic formats like .Z (LZW), .zip (Deflate), .gz or bzip2. (The scoring formula used in this non-public test, : \\\\text{score}_X = \\\\text{time}_X \\\\times 2^{10\\\\cdot\\\\left(\\\\frac{\\\\text{size}_X}{\\\\text{size}_{\\\\text{TOP}}} - 1\\\\right)} multiplies the sum of compression and decompression times by a factor that exponentially grades the ratio of archive sizes achieved by the program under test relative to the best known archive size for that data set.) As of November 2010, FreeArc is the top program in this benchmark, followed by NanoZip, bsc and WinRAR. It works faster than WinRAR and 7zip., golem.de Features Like RAR and ZIP it is an archiver, not just a data compressor like gzip or bzip2. Initially it supported only its own archive format, normally identified by the \`.arc\` file name extension, incompatible with others; there is no relationship with other .arc formats. More recently, decompression support for other archive types was added, including zip, rar, and 7z. FreeArc has both a command line interface and a GUI. Other features include: * Solid compression with \\"smart updates\\" which avoid recompression when possible * AES/Blowfish/Twofish/Serpent encryption,Patrick Schmid, Achim Roos, (March 10, 2010) 7-Zip 9.1 Beta And FreeArc 0.60, Tom's Hardware including chaining of encryption algorithms * FAR and Total Commander plug-ins * Ability to create self-extracting archives and installers * Archive protection and recovery layer using Reed-Solomon error correction with user- defined size (for example, recovery over Internet being 0.1%, while default is autosize 1-4%). Supported platforms Windows binaries are available from the developer. There is no 64-bit variant of version 0.666, but FA 0.11 supported both 32- and 64-bit systems.  FreeArc Next  In October 2016 the first public release of FreeArc Next was released. It is currently available only as a CLI application for 32 and 64 bit Windows and Linux platforms.

ChessCube has officially closed its website. History Mark Levitt, founder of ChessCube, was involved in chess publishing in the early 1990s. From 1997 to 1998, Mark built the online Chess World for British Telecom's GamePlay.com, but GamePlay.com naturally dropped its board and card games in 1999 after it listed. Mark launched ChessCube as a market test in 2007 in South Africa, and ChessCube was offered internationally in January 2008. As of August 2009, ChessCube had over 650,000 registered users from over 200 countries. On 10 August 2009, ChessCube announced a US$1.25m VC funding from InVenFin. ChessCube has secured $1.8m to date in venture capital. Investors include InVenFin, a subsidiary of Venfin Limited, Michael Leeman and Vinny Lingham. ChessCube shut down on 31 January 2020. Users ChessCube has over 1,000,000 registered users globally. ChessCube's community is managed by moderators who are ChessCube players themselves. Moderators may mute players who are abusive. They can also, as similar to members, report users if it seems like they are cheating. Various chat rooms are set up for various groups, mainly by country, but also by politics, and other discussions. A dedicated ChessCube forum also exists independently of the main site to discuss the site and other topics. Memberships In mid-2011, ChessCube switched to VIP memberships while still allowing people without memberships to play a limited number of games for free. If people win cubits however by betting and winning games, it is possible to continue to play on the site way past the original number of games. This can be seen with many members who have played hundreds of games but are not VIP members. VIP members gain VIP status by buying crowns, another form of currency like the cubit, and are able to play in hourly VIP-only locked tournaments. They are noted unlike other members by their username being in gold instead of the usual grey and they have a crown under their mini-profile. Grandmasters and other FIDE titled players, as similar to other sites, automatically gain premium memberships. Features The ChessCube live chess is developed in Adobe Flash. ChessCube Play is ChessCube's live chess platform. Games can be rated or unrated, tournament or standard, and timed or untimed. Fast games are timed games less than 10 minutes. Slow games are games longer than 15 minutes. Games can be standard or Chess960, a variant where starting positions are shuffled. Registered users who are logged in can spectate live games. \\"Tournament or standard\\" refer to either playing solo live games or tournaments on the site where people pay cubits to enter. People have two different ratings, one as their \\"standard rating\\" and the other as their \\"tournament\\" rating. People who do well in these tournaments gain prizes, usually cubits, but occasionally crowns. ChessCube Chat allows all registered players who are logged in to chat to one another, either in chat rooms, while playing chess games against one another or while spectating chess games. ChessCube also allows all registered players to have a customizable profile, invite friends, follow friends, and earn cubits, which is like a currency for the chess site. Cubits can be used to buy items in the virtual store such as backgrounds, voices, chess piece colors, and chess piece styles. They can also be used to play games. \\"Crowns\\" are another form of currency, mostly for premium/VIP players but also for those who are strong enough to win tournaments where they are crowns as prizes. Crowns can be used to enter specific tournaments and to buy things at a much lower \\"level\\" easier and permanently. ChessCube Cinema is an Adobe AIR application that can be downloaded to a user's desktop. It allows chess videos and lectures to be downloaded and viewed by the user.

Proof: In view of the previous lemma, it is sufficient to show that the lower nilradical of R is nilpotent. Because R is right Noetherian, a maximal nilpotent ideal N exists. By maximality of N, the quotient ring R/N has no nonzero nilpotent ideals, so R/N is a semiprime ring. As a result, N contains the lower nilradical of R. Since the lower nilradical contains all nilpotent ideals, it also contains N, and so N is equal to the lower nilradical. Q.E.D.

He is most known for his extant work in Sanskrit, the Vardhaman Charitra (Life of Vardhamana). This epic poem which runs into eighteen cantos was written in 853 CE. It is the earliest available Sanskrit biography of the last tirthankara of Jainism, Mahavira. In all, he authored at least eight works in Sanskrit. In Kannada, none of his writings, including the Karnataka Kumarasambhava Kavya (an adaptation of Kalidas's epic poem KumƒÅrasambhava) that have been referenced by latter day poets (including Nagavarma II who seems to provide a few quotations from the epic poem in his KavyavalokanaR S Hukkerikar (1955), p.88, Karnataka Darshana, Popular Book Depot, 1955) have survived. His writings are known to have influenced Kannada poet Sri Ponna, the famous court poet of Rashtrakuta King Krishna III, and other writers who wrote on the lives of Jain Tirthankaras. Kesiraja, (authored Shabdamanidarpana in c. 1260 CE), a Kannada grammarian cites Asaga as an authoritative writer of his time and places him along with other masters of early Kannada poetry. Biography Asaga's name is considered an apbramsha form of the Sanskrit name A≈õoka or Asanga. A contemporary of Rashtrakuta King Amoghavarsha I (800‚Äì878 CE), Asaga lived in modern Karnataka and made important contributions to the corpus of Rashtrakuta literature created during their rule in southern and central India between the 8th and 10th centuries. Like Kannada writer Gunavarma, Asaga earned fame despite having received no direct royal patronage. In his Vardhamacharita, Asaga mentions writing eight classics though the only one other work has survived, the Shanti purana in Sanskrit. Asaga claims to have composed his writings in the city of Virala (Dharala), Coda Visaya (\\"Cola desa\\" or Coda lands), in the Kingdom of King Srinatha, who was perhaps a Rashtrakuta vassal. In Kaviprasastipradyani, the epilogue to the Shanti purana, Asaga claims he was born to Jain parents and names his three Jain teachers, including Bhavakirti. Much of what is known about Asaga has come down from references to his works made by later-day writers and poets. Kannada poet Sri Ponna (c. 950), who used one of his narrative poems as a source, claims to be superior to Asaga.Warder A.K. (1988), p. 248 Asaga's writings have been praised by later-day poets and writers, such as Kannada writer Jayakirti (Chchandanuphasana), who mentions Asaga's Karnataka Kumarasambhava Kavya. Several of its verses have been quoted by later authors of Kannada literature such as Durgasimha, Nayasena and Jayakirti (a Kannada language theorist of the early 11th century) who refer to Asaga as the best writer of desi Kannada, which may be considered as \\"traditional\\" or \\"provincial\\" form of the language. The Indologist A. K. Warder considers this unique because Asaga was also famous for classical Sanskrit. The 11th century Kannada grammarian Nagavarma II claimed Asaga to be an equal to Sri Ponna, and 12th century Kannada writer Brahmashiva refers to Asaga as Rajaka, a honorific that means \\"one among the greats\\" of Kannada literature. His writings appear to have been popular among later Kannada writers up to the decline of the Vijayanagara Empire in the 16th century. Though his Kannada writings are deemed lost, his name is counted among noted poets of Kannada literature from that period, along with the likes of Gajaga, Aggala, Manasija, Srivardhadheva and Gunanandi. The 10th century Apabhramsha poet Dhaval praised Asaga's writing Harivamsa-purana.

Following the Structured Professional Judgment (SPJ) model, the SAPROF was designed as a positive addition to other SPJ risk assessment tools, such as the HCR-20 (Historical Clinical Risk - 20; Webster, Douglas, Eaves & Hart, 1997), creating a more balanced assessment of risk for future (sexual) violence. The SAPROF aims to contribute to an increasingly accurate and well-rounded assessment of risk for future violent behavior. Moreover, the dynamic positive approach of protective factors aims to create new opportunities for effective and achievable treatment interventions. Retrospective results at the Van der Hoeven Kliniek in The Netherlands show good interrater reliability and good predictive validity for violent recidivism. Moreover, the changeability of the protective factors in the SAPROF during treatment provides an indication for the usability of the SAPROF as a guideline for positive treatment planning and risk management (De Vries Robb√©, De Vogel, & De Spa, under review). Frequent users of the SAPROF in forensic psychiatry state that the instrument can be helpful in formulating treatment goals, justifying stages of treatment, atoning treatment phasing and facilitating risk communication (Van den Broek & De Vries Robb√©, 2008). Vivienne de Vogel, Corine de Ruiter, Yvonne Bouman and Michiel de Vries Robb√© (2007) originally developed the SAPROF in Dutch and in 2009 the English Version was published.

It survives as a sparsely populated, predominantly rural locality, which includes Gatton Park, no more than 12 houses, and two farms on the slopes of the North Downs near Reigate. The parish lay within Reigate hundred. Toponymy Early forms of Gatton's name include Gatatune (recorded between 871 and 889) and Gatetuna (in 1121). The name is thought to mean \\"goat-farm\\". This may indicate either that the township had a specialised function (goat-farming) within the economy of a much larger Anglo-Saxon estate; or that it was required to make a specialised tribute obligation, in the form of goats, to its overlord. History Gatton \\"Town Hall\\" Gatton appears in Domesday Book of 1086 as Gatone. It was held by Herfrid from the Bishop of Bayeux. Its Domesday assets were: 2¬Ω hides; 5 ploughlands; a church; of meadow; and woodland and grazing for 7 pigs. It rendered ¬£6.Open Domesday From 1332 onwards Gatton was taxed as a town (at a higher rate than that payable by a village or rural settlement); and from 1450 part of the parish was the parliamentary borough of Gatton, sending two members to the House of Commons. However, there is no evidence of the late medieval settlement developing any other distinctively urban characteristics. Instead, the settlement shrank, and by the beginning of the 17th century the antiquary William Camden was able to describe it as \\"scarce a small village, though in times past it hath beene a famous towne\\". By 1831 the parliamentary borough had only seven voters and 23 houses, placing it among the most notorious of \\"rotten boroughs\\". It was abolished by the Reform Act of 1832. Gatton \\"Town Hall\\", on Gatton Park estate, is a folly erected in 1765: it takes the form of an open Doric temple. It was here that the parliamentary elections were held. Behind it stands a large urn bearing a Latin inscription, which includes the line \\"Salus populi Suprema Lex Esto\\": \\"Let the well-being of the people be the supreme law\\". James Ogilvy commented in 1914: \\"The whole erection could shelter about thirty people from the rain; whether it superseded an earlier town hall does not appear to be known.\\" A salient of the parish ran southwards, south of Merstham to the boundary of Nutfield, but it was added to Merstham in 1899.A Vision of Britain through Time: Gatton CP/AP Church The church is dedicated to St Andrew. Before the early 19th century, it was a late medieval building revealing evidence of early Norman origins.Blair 1991 pp. 122, 204 n108. It was heavily remodelled in the \\"Gothick\\" style in 1834 by Frederick John Monson, 5th Baron Monson, essentially as his private chapel and a showcase for his collections. Its contents include a fine 15th-century rood screen, brought from another unidentified English church. In 1930, stones from the structure were removed by Sir Jeremiah Colman (1st Bart.) and the contemporary rector of Gatton and given to Colorado College of Colorado Springs, Colorado in the United States to be incorporated into the structure of the Eugene Percy Shove Memorial Chapel in honor of the donor's ancestor, Edward Shove, who was rector of Gatton from 1615 to -46. The church is adjacent to the Royal Alexandra and Albert School. It is now used generally as a chapel: it has a joint benefice with and is reliant for regular services on services in Merstham Village, the conservation area part of Merstham. Geography Gatton lies on the crest of the escarpment of the North Downs and on its southern slopes, primarily in the Reigate (RH2) post town.Ecclesiastical Parish - Click on Find Us for the mapPostcode map, see and type RH1 then RH2 Gatton Park that forms most of its southern half now houses the boarders of The Royal Alexandra and Albert school. As defined by its ecclesiastical parish, Gatton has no more than 12 houses. In Gatton to the north, Upper Gatton Farm, Crossways Farm, Old Trees and Olde Forge (all along High Road) are all on the crest (uplands) of the North Downs near to Chipstead, a large village adjoining Gatton to the north. The North Downs Way The North Downs Way passes from Colley Hill on the Reigate/Kingswood border into the area of Gatton at the top of Reigate Hill, through Gatton Park and then Reigate Hill golf course, there descending into Quality Street, Old Merstham and into the M25 ring, along Rockshaw Road and up to Chaldon. Gatton Park Gatton Park has extensive landscaped grounds, and these wider areas, away from the public footpath, are opened to the public on a few afternoons each year. Gatton Park open days Gatton Bottom Gatton Bottom is a road following a dry valley/dene from Reigate Hill to the near the top of Old Merstham and is known as one of three access roads from the south side to the Junction 8 interchange of the M25, the others being Wray Lane (one-way) and Reigate Hill. This area still marks the border between the steep downs' rise to its north and the rise then fall of Gatton Park to its south. Homes surrounding the east of Gatton Bottom are all in the Merstham Village Conservation Area. Elevations, soil and geology Gatton's elevations range from 215m AOD, the highest elevation, along Fort Lane, a cul- de-sac off the intersection of Reigate Hill (M25 Junction 8) which leads to four homes over the boundary in Reigate, a radio transmitter station, and a water tower. On the A217 is the Bridge House Hotel, whose name refers to a footbridge carrying the North Downs Way across the A217Bridge House Hotel, Reigate Hill 85m to the east. Ordnance Survey map, courtesy of English Heritage Three main types of soil form bands from north to south. However in the fields to the northeast, i.e. mostly made up of Upper Gatton Park and Farm, there is a round area of \\"free-draining, slightly acid, sandy soil\\" which as the Soilscape study indicates is used for dry pasture, coniferous woodland and, as not stated there, for wheat. One wood includes a small section in the east the \\"freely draining slightly acid loamy soil\\" that provides the infill of the Downs and is seen for example in Kingswood and counterintuitively all of the southern developed parts of Reigate, Redhill, most of Dorking, much and all of central Croydon and all around the lowland commons, heaths and parks of south-west London. Throughout the north, the soil is fertile \\"slightly acid loamy and clayey soil with impeded drainage\\", interrupted by a steep narrow middle course of mid-fertility \\"shallow lime- rich soils over chalk or limestone\\" which the M25 motorway passes through in Gatton, producing a sheer chalk face on the northern bank east of the Junction 8 interchange, whereas on its very gradual descent to the north-west close to Leatherhead grassed banks surround a far more shallow chalk cutting of the M25 ‚Äî the only other locations where the M25 passes through chalk slopes are approaching Junction 4 close to Orpington, Halstead and Shoreham, Kent. Across the south of Gatton Park and Reigate Hill Golf Course soil is \\"slowly permeable, seasonally wet slightly acid but base-rich, loamy and clayey\\".Cranfield University, National Soil Resources Institute In terms of geology, overlying the rather older Hythe, Sandgate and Folkestone Beds under even deeper seas, Gault Clay and the Upper Greensand were deposited. The Gault Clay contains phosphate-rich nodules in discrete bands and has a rich marine fauna with abundant ammonites, bivalves and gastropods. The Upper Greensand comprises a variety of sediments with fine silts at the base giving way upwards into type of sandstone. Beginning 90 million years ago the North Downs hard chalk was deposited, a white limestone comprising over 95% calcium carbonate. This contains thin beds of marl and nodules of flint, either scattered or in bands. The North Downs extending from Farnham to Dover, Kent are formed by this chalk. They now have an often white, almost vertical south- facing slope.Natural England - Geodiversity References External links * Reigate and Redhill Guide and Directory * A Vision of Britain through Time: Gatton Category:Hamlets in Surrey Category:Deserted medieval villages in England Category:Former populated places in Surrey ","title":"Gatton, Surrey"},{"id":"24015426","text":"DoubleSpace was a disk compression utility supplied with MS-DOS starting from version 6.0.

Feather holes often characteristically occur on wing and tail feathers of some small- bodied species of passerines. In the case of barn swallows, it was suggested that the holes were feeding traces of avian lice, either Machaerilaemus malleus and/or Myrsidea rustica (both Phthiraptera: Amblycera). Hole counts were shown to be highly repeatable, and thus counts appeared to be useful measures to quantify the intensity of infestation. Since then, a number of influential papers have been published on the evolutionary, ecological, and behavioral aspects of host-parasite interactions based on the assumption that holes were chewed by Machaerilaemus malleus. More specifically, host sexual selection, feather breakage, flight performance, immunity levels, arrival dates, and even song characteristics were shown to covary with the number of holes. Cross-fostering experiments showed that infestation levels were heritable. Recently, however, it was shown that Machaerilaemus malleus is apparently absent from Europe, where all these studies were carried out. Correlational evidence supports the hypothesis that feather holes are feeding traces of lice, however, the occurrence of Brueelia spp. lice (Phthiraptera: Ischnocera) provides the best fit to the distribution and abundance of feather holes both in barn swallows and across several small passerines.

There was an operating room for \\"cases of a severe nature\\". A mortuary was located in the yard. Benefactors included Elizabeth Layland, who in 1734 had left ¬£60 for the poor or the education of children, enough to generate an annuity of over ¬£2 each year for the cottage hospital. The hospital was enlarged at a cost of ¬£700 between 1882 and 1883. There were then 25 beds, some of which were made available for patients outside a five miles radius of Lytham. A new ward, in memory of Dr. L. Fisher, was subscribed for and built in around 1910. The hospital was completely rebuilt in the late 1920s when a time capsule containing contemporary artifacts was buried for future discovery. The hospital joined the National Health Service in 1948.

He is the son of the former Japanese gymnast, Mitsuo Tsukahara, who was also a multiple gold medalist in the Olympic Games during the 1960s and 70s.Mitsuo Tsukahara Olympic results He competed at the 1996, 2000 and 2004 Olympics as well as many World Championships for team Japan from 1996 until 2006. In 2009, he moved to Australia, gaining citizenship in 2012, and currently represents Australia's national gymnastics team, most recently competing at the 2014 Glasgow Commonwealth Games.  Competitive History   Late 1990s  Naoya participated at the 1996 Olympics in Atlanta. The Japanese team finished 10th in the team final. Individually, Naoya qualified into the all-around final and finished 12th in the final. Although Naoya did not get any medal in the 1996 Olympics, he had been quite successful after that. In the 1997 World Championships, he won two bronze medals in the all-around and on parallel bars. In the 1999 World Championships, he had pushed himself to a higher level of success, winning silver medals in all-around and on parallel bars.  2000 Summer Olympics  Following his successes at the World Championships, Naoya eventually came to his second Olympic Games, the 2000 Olympics in Sydney. This time the Japanese gymnastics team was edged by the Russian team for a bronze medal. Individually, Naoya qualified 6th and 10th into the horizontal bar and all-around final respectively. He finally finished 18th in all-around final, and a fall in the horizontal bar final made him come last, with a score of 8.825.  2001‚Äì2003  After the 2000 Summer Olympics, Naoya could not regain his form of 2000. In addition, there were some fabulous gymnasts rose in Japan, including Hiroyuki Tomita, Isao Yoneda and Takehiro Kashima. Naoya's character in the national team changed from an all-around competitor into an anchor for the Japanese gymnastics team. In the 2003 World Championships, Naoya made it into the all-around and parallel bars finals, finishing 7th in the all-around while his teammate, Hiroyuki Tomita, won a bronze in that event. Individually, Naoya placed 4th on his strongest event, parallel bars with a score of 9.675.  2004 Summer Olympics  Naoya made the 2004 Summer Olympics held in Athens, Greece. The Japanese team showed strong performances and eventually won the team gold medal. Naoya placed 4th on floor exercise in prelim with a 9.725, the same score of his teammates, Isao Yoneda and Daisuke Nakano. However, the tie-breaker policy favoured his two teammates into the final. He did not qualify into the all-around final.  After the 2004 Summer Olympics  Naoya was 27 when the Olympics in Athens wrapped, which was an age considered 'old' for gymnastics. Nevertheless, he kept competing. He won a bronze medal with the team in the 2006 World Championships but could not make the 2008 Summer Olympics. He was still competing as of Summer 2010.  Competing For Australia  In 2009, he moved to Australia, competing and winning at the 2009, 2010, 2011, and 2013 Australian National Gymnastics Championships, and winning 2nd place behind Joshua Jefferis in 2012. In 2012, he gained Australian citizenship, allowing him to compete representing Australia in international competitions. However, the process was not completed in time for qualification to the 2012 Olympic Games. In 2013, he competed at the 2013 World Championships, narrowly missing the all-around finals, but premiering two new variations of the V-cross on still rings. FIG later announced the Li Ning 2 to V-cross as the \\"Tsukahara,\\" named after the athlete. This rare honor for a gymnast is one his father also experienced multiple times. He also competed in the 2014 Commonwealth Games in Glasgow, UK. In March 2016, Tsukahara retired.

It was recorded in Perth, Australia and released on the Offworld Sounds record label run by Ryder's cousin Pete Carroll and Mallinder. Carroll also founded littleBIGMAN records with Happy Mondays drummer Gaz Whelan and currently manages The Panics, Tim and Jean, Meg Mac and Georgia Fair. Recording The album was recorded following a Happy Mondays Big Day Out tour of Australia. Shaun Ryder stayed on in Australia moving into Pete Carroll's house where he heard tracks Carroll and Shane Norton were working on for Offworld Sounds. \\"Our Pete just said, 'Tell us a story.' I've got that many, Pete reckoned I should record them once and for all\\" said Shaun Ryder. \\"I'm kind of a novelist in the way that 9/11 was a Great American Novel\\" the singer added. Ryder was keen to work on some new material and over a period of early morning sessions in Carroll's garage studio Amateur night in the Big Top began to take shape. The album was never conceived as a commercially focused release-it's an honest hard edge punk record. There's an overall feel and concept; Ryder's lyrics are autobiographical, touching on his early days with Happy Mondays in \\"The Story\\" and \\"1987\\" while \\"Clowns\\" and \\"Long Legs\\" express his feelings about the music industry and the legal issues he was facing.

These regulatory elements bind small molecules which results in a conformational change within the 5‚ÄôUTR of the mRNA. The changes in the mRNA secondary structure subsequently result in changes in the expression of the adjacent open reading frame. Bioinformatic studies have identified several riboswitches present in M. florum. These riboswitches have been mapped to regions located upstream of the guaAB operon and resemble purine riboswitches. The riboswitches identified in M. florum can be classed as novel riboswitches as they deviate in sequence and structure within the loops regions that are required in aptamer binding compared to conventional purine riboswitches. Mutagenesis confirmed that changing nucleotides within the loop regions of this riboswitch altered the specificity for ligand binding. This study showed that the novel riboswitches have a greater diversity in ligands they bind as they were found to bind alternative ligands such as nucleosides. The novel riboswitches were all shown to lie upstream of a putative intrinsic terminator stem and this indicates that these riboswitches control transcription termination. Comparative genomics has shown that these novel riboswitches are exclusive found in M. florum and not present in other strains of bacteria.

Active throughout the communist period and first acknowledged as one among the young socialist realists promoted by the regime, Taru primarily associated with satirical magazines such as Urzica. Recognized early on for his controversial involvement with the propaganda apparatus, he later focused on his work for children, and became one of the noted visual artists employed by the Editura Ion CreangƒÉ publishing house. Also known as art collectors, he and his wife Josefina donated one of the principal estates exhibited by the Museum of Art Collections. His own works are featured in several Romanian museums. Biography A graduate of the Carol I High School in Craiova, Constantin Ilie, \\"Regalul artelor frumoase\\" , in Gazeta de Sud, May 25, 2006 Taru first became noted as an artist in the years after World War II, when he affiliated with the communists and socialist realists who received official endorsement from the Romanian Communist Party. Art critic Pavel ≈ûu≈üarƒÉ cited his name among young artists who needed affirmation and found it through political compromise, the \\"hardcore\\" group \\"who illustrated, through their attitudes, their iconography and implicit philosophy, the benchmarks, the aspirations and the utopias of a system that had an imperative need for artists to promote its doctrine and provide it with symbolic credentials.\\" Pavel ≈ûu≈üarƒÉ, \\"Realismul socialist ≈üi 'revigorarea' limbajului\\", in Rom√¢nia LiterarƒÉ, Nr. 21/2006 In the context of the Cold War, Taru became especially known for stereotypical political cartoons, such as those targeting Wall Street business Nicolae Prelipceanu, \\"Cronica de teatru. Jocul ielelor ≈üi-al √Ænt√¢mplƒÉrii\\" , in Via≈£a Rom√¢neascƒÉ, Nr. 6-7/2007, p.238 (republished by the Romanian Cultural Institute's Rom√¢nia CulturalƒÉ ) or wealthy peasants known as chiaburi (the equivalent of kulaks). Gheorghe M√¢ndrescu, \\"Grafica ≈üi propaganda √Æn primii ani ai regimului comunist √Æn Rom√¢nia. Exemple din colec≈£ia Muzeului Na≈£ional de ArtƒÉ din Cluj-Napoca\\" , in Tribuna, Nr. 48, September 2004, p.21 The latter were especially controversial, since they coincided with the forced collectivization and the murderous campaign targeting the rural elites. One of Taru's watercolors, called Demascarea chiaburului (\\"Unmasking the Chiabur\\"), shows a proletarian, a communized peasant and a militiaman publicly shaming the rich peasant for not handing in his production quota (which, in reality, was set to a preferential and debilitating level). After the Tito‚ÄìStalin split, when Soviet-aligned Romania pursued a propaganda war on the Socialist Federal Republic of Yugoslavia, the artist was enlisted to produce giant panels showing Josip Broz Tito as a butcher holding a bloody axe (in the line of posters deeming him a \\"butcher of the Yugoslav peoples\\"). G. Pienescu, \\"Intermezzo (I)\\", in Via≈£a Rom√¢neascƒÉ, Nr. 10/2008 During the 1950s, Taru also created a regularly published comic strip, built around and named after its main character, the dwarf BarbƒÉcot.\\"Eugen Taru (1913 - 1991, Romania)\\", entry in Lambiek's Comiclopedia; retrieved August 17, 2009 The decade coincided with a slump in the history of Romanian comics: while exercising ideological control over the comic strip scene, the authorities reputedly preferred to invest in animation, viewed as a more effective means of spreading propaganda. Adrian Grama, Vlad Stoicescu, \\"Rahan ≈üi Pif, scƒÉpa≈£i de comunism\\", in Evenimentul Zilei, June 28, 2008 In this context, Taru's survived as one of the comic strips most familiar to the general public during communism (alongside those created by Ion Deak, Pompiliu Dumitrescu, Puiu Manu, VintilƒÉ MihƒÉescu, Dumitru Negrea, Ion Popescu-Gopo and L√≠via Rusz). Taru was still working at Urzica after 1965, when the regime changed cultural direction under new leader Nicolae Ceau≈üescu. According to artist Mihai P√Ænzaru-Pim, who began working for the magazine in 1969, Taru, alongside Cik Damadian and actor Hora≈£iu MƒÉlƒÉele, discreetly stood against the policies enforced by Ceau≈üescu, defined by him as \\"the stupid attempt to induce ideology on a wise people\\". Vasile Arhire, \\" 'Umorul, r√Æsul, ironia nu trebuie sƒÉ disparƒÉ din starea noastrƒÉ cotidianƒÉ'‚Äîdialog cu Mihai P√Ænzaru-Pim, caricaturist\\", in Evenimentul, April 19, 2008 P√Ænzaru-Pim contends that, as a result, Urzica was among the publications most likely to bypass communist censorship with ≈üop√¢rle (lit. \\"lizards\\", or pieces subtly criticizing the regime in a seemingly innocent context). Together, Taru and P√Ænzaru-Pim were also the first Romanian cartoonists to receive international awards.Florian Doru Crihana, A Few Words about Rumanian Caricature , at Muzeum Karykatury; retrieved August 17, 2009 An area where Taru's contribution has traditionally been seen as superlative was that of book illustration. According to his entry at the National Museum of Art, Taru was one of the local artists \\"who consolidated the prestige of book illustration as an autonomous genre, enriching the concept of 'illustration' with more complex functions than the mere visualization of a literary sequence or a poetic state.\\" Colec≈£ia Josefina ≈üi Eugen Taru, at the National Museum of Art of Romania site; retrieved August 17, 2009 Recalling her introduction to the genre as a child, graphic artist Arina Stoenescu lists Taru, alongside Rusz and Val Munteanu, as one of three most memorable artists to have been associated with the state-run children's book publisher Editura Ion CreangƒÉ.Arina Stoenescu, \\"All Those Images\\", in the Romanian Cultural Institute's Plural Magazine , Nr. 30/2007 Among the noted drawings produced by Taru in this area were his 14 pieces for a 1959 edition of Childhood Memories by the 19th century Romanian literature classic Ion CreangƒÉ, Florin Rusu, \\"Bijuteria de pe Valea Ozanei\\", in Evenimentul, May 18, 2002 and his illustrations for a 1986 translation of Miguel de Cervantes' Don Quixote (the second Romanian edition of the book to feature original illustrations, after the 1976 version by Val Munteanu).\\"Ilustratorii lui Don Quijote\\", in the National Library of Romania's Revista BNR, Nr. 1/2005, p.38 Estate Taru and his wife Josefina gathered a sizable collection of artistic works, which, together with some of Taru's own creations, was donated to the Museum of Art Collections.

Yet the resort is just twenty minutes from the beach (the Costa C√°lida) and an international airport - Aeropuerto Internacional Regi√≥n de Murcia The Resort is bordered to the south by the Peraleja Golf Resort. The resort comprises an 18-hole golf course designed by Nicklaus Design which is integrated with 1864 apartments. The resort‚Äôs town-centre retains the colonial style of the Riquelme family construction architectural style containing a restaurant, bar, grocery store, and golf shop. The golf course and community are gated with external access only possible through a single gatehouse. There are 19 swimming pools scattered around the resort On the resort, there are a plethora of native trees, including olive, pomegranate, and carob, as well as five large lakes and small waterfalls. The resort is well known as a haven for wildlife, with nearly 100 different species of birds, including coots, redfish, little grebes, martinete, bittern, curlew, parakeets, herons, and a rare black swan, having been seen. A golden eagle and eagle owl have also been seen.

This makes the resort much more accessible and allows residents and holiday makers quick access to Sucina and the beach. Sucina is a 45-minute walk from the gatehouse. The beach is a 20-minute drive away and so access to a car is often essential. There is no taxi company in Sucina and so taxis in Hacienda Riquelme are not common.

Gus Edson (September 20, 1901 - September 26, 1966) was an American cartoonist known for two popular, long running comic strips, The Gumps and Dondi. Born to Max and Emma Edson in Cincinnati, Ohio, Gus Edson dropped out of school at age 17 to join the Army, serving in Australia in 1918. After his discharge, he studied briefly at Pratt Institute and the Art Students League. Edson was a sports cartoonist with the New York Evening Graphic from 1925 to 1928, followed by a year with the Paul Block Chain of Newspapers and a year at the New York Evening Post. Along with his freelance work, he was a standby ghost for King Features Syndicate, eventually arriving at the Daily News as a sports cartoonist (1931‚Äì35). In 1933, while at the Daily News, he created his first daily comic strip, Streaky, which he wrote until 1935. When Sidney Smith, creator of The Gumps, died suddenly in 1935, Edson took over Smith's strip. Two years later, there was a continuity problem, as noted in Editor & Publisher: :Gus Edson, who has been carrying on the Andy Gump assignment, reported to his office at the Chicago Tribune-New York News Syndicate and found a mail stack of more than 100 letters waiting for him, all containing reminders, in one form or another, that the two principals in the current chapter of the Gump strip, who are planning marriage, have been wed before. When the artist contemplated marrying off Tom Carr and the Widow Zander, after the former had been released from prison, his staff reminded him that the couple had been married previously in the story of the strip some eight years ago and then had drifted apart when the Widow Zander's husband, believed to be dead, had returned. Edson's firm conviction that no one would remember the previous situation was rocked when he was faced with the mail-bag full of reminders.\\"700 Letters Catch Cartoonist\\", Editor & Publisher, July 24, 1937. Edson wrote and drew The Gumps for 24 years. His assistant on The Gumps in the early 1950s was the actor Martin Landau. Cousin Juniper was a topper strip which Edson also drew for his Sunday page. Edson helped sell war bonds during World War II, and he traveled around the world entertaining troops with his amusing chalk talks. Radio In March 1948, Edson was heard on ABC's America's Town Meeting of the Air. During the discussion \\"What's Wrong with Comics?\\", Edson questioned panelist John Mason Brown, challenging Brown's negative notions about comic strips. Dondi In the early 1950s, Edson was one of several National Cartoonists Society members who participated in European USO Tours. After a visit to Germany, he created Dondi in 1955 with Irwin Hasen. In 1957, Edson recalled the origin of the strip: :My search for the perfect collaborator came to a sudden and successful conclusion on a lovely May morning in 1954, in storybook Heidelberg. How clearly its details pierce the dimming mists of time! I was at breakfast with a diminutive artist, name of Hasen. Casually I remarked on the excellence of our Spiegel Eier. He wept. My interest was piqued. \\"Why do you weep?\\" I inquired. \\"Because the Spiegel Eier tastes so good,\\" he simpered. That was all. But it was everything! Here indeed was the understanding heart for which I would have combed the world!... One more date in the saga of our collaboration fell on September 26, 1955. An important executive named Moe Reilly gave Dondi a job. \\"How's he doing?\\" you ask. Modesty forces me to admit that the kid is getting along so well that Hasen and I are now living the life of Reilly. In case you care, this is how we collaborate. I lock myself in a small-type room (you know where). Two days later, I stagger out with a whole roll‚Äî er, ream of scribbling. These brain squeezings I then boil down into the written material for six daily strips and a Sunday page. Since I can't typewrite, I prepare two clean longhand copies, one of which I relay to Hasen. He takes it from there (and beautifully!). The other copy goes to editor Moe Reilly. Once a month, Hasen, Moe Reilly and I have food and beverages together to discuss Dondi's future plights. We enjoy these bacchanalian revels very much because the Syndicate pays for them.Cartoonist Profiles, Summer, 1957 In 1961, Edson scripted the Dondi film adaptation, and he also wrote a proposed sequel, The Carnival Kid. Edson was a member of the Society of Illustrators, the National Cartoonists Society and the Writer‚Äôs Guild of America. Books Edson's strips were collected in several books, including Andy Gump in Radioland (1937) and The Gumps (1952). Whitman Publishing collected his Streaky strips in the 158-page book, Streaky and the Football Signals. Awards In addition to his savings bond drives, Edson volunteered for various causes and fundraising campaigns. The Treasury Department recognized his efforts by awarding him a Distinguished Service Award in 1954.Syracuse University: Gus Edson Papers During the 1940s, Edson lived on Brookside Road in Darien, Connecticut. He later moved to 149 Weed Avenue in Stamford, Connecticut, home to several cartoonists, including Ernie Bushmiller, Alex Raymond and Mort Walker. In Stamford, Edson helped raise money for community groups.Carella, Angela. \\"Angela Carella: Comic history in strip of a park\\", News Times, May 10, 2010. He died of heart failure September 27, 1966 in Stamford.

Edson was honored by a plaque in the park, a reminder of his close ties with the group of poker pals in the Stamford Police department. The plaque reads: :Gus Edson Lookout dedicated to \\"friend of the cop\\" Stamford Police Assn. Etched into the surface of the plaque is a portrait of Edson with Dondi and Andy Gump. In 1997, Edson's home at 149 Weed Ave. was torn down to make space for a small housing development. Edson's son is the poet-novelist Russell Edson.

His research focuses on the relationship between media and justice. It analyzes how media policies have an effect on the public interest; minority rights; the unequal distribution of communication resources, and the silencing of the public's voice, in particular that of members of marginalized communities. Central among the theoretical approaches to justice he currently investigates is the capabilities approach. He has also written extensively about media regulation, critiquing policies regarding broadcasting, cable television, public broadcasting, mobile services, and audiovisual services in Israel as well as low power FM, network neutrality and universal service policies in the U.S. As a member of the International Media Concentration Group, he analyzed (with Moran Yemini) media concentration in Israel between 1984-2013. He is the author or editor of 7 books and more than 60 journal articles, law reviews and book chapters in five languages and has been cited in congressional and Knesset hearings. Critics have described his books as deserving of \\"high praise for their energetic and creative investigation\\", as \\"must-read for policy makers, educators, industry leaders and others interested in bringing U.S. communications into the 21st century,\\" and as \\"display[ing] enviable intellectual courage\\".

Between 1993 and 1997 he was director of legal affairs and international relations at the Israel Broadcasting Authority where he co-authored the Nakdi Report. In 2000 he was appointed vice president for regulatory affairs at Cellcom (Israel), where he attracted public attention when attacking the government's caving in to pressures of Bezeq, the national telco, and refusing to undergo a polygraph test enforced on the corporation's senior management. Professor Schejter has been involved in public life in Israel and the United States. In Israel, he has served on a number of public committees charged with studying and developing new policies regarding a wide range of issues. In 2007-2008 he headed the Future of American Telecommunications Working Group, which proposed a telecommunications and media policy agenda for the incoming Obama administration, and he has addressed regulators, and academic audiences worldwide. Most recently, in 2015 he headed a government panel that proposed sweeping changes to the Israeli media industry.

F. C. Harrison, was a British academic who was Professor of History at the University of Sussex and author of books on history, particularly relating to Victorian Britain. Career Harrison was born in Leicester in 1921. He was educated at City Boys' School and at Selwyn College, Cambridge. During World War II he served in the British Army as a captain in the 17th (Uganda) Battalion of the King's African Rifles. After the war he became a lecturer, then Deputy Director of the Department of Adult Education and Extra-Mural Studies at the University of Leeds. From 1961 to 1970 he was Professor of History at University of Wisconsin. He then was appointed Professor of Social History at the University of Sussex, where he remained until his retirement. He has held visiting appointments at Harvard University and the Australian National University.author information for Late Victorian Britain He died on 8 January 2018 at the age of 96.John Fletcher Clews Harrison Obituary Work 'John Harrison writes always for an informed general public and not for examiners or fellow specialists', E.P.Thompson once commented, adding that 'he writes always with clarity, in an unhurried, authoritative, economical style'.Review of Harrison's book The Second Coming in the Guardian 13 September 1979. Thompson and Harrison had been colleagues in the University of Leeds Adult Education Department and the years they spent teaching adult students in 'extramural' classes up and down Yorkshire shaped their determination to make academic history as accessible as possible. This was also reflected in Harrison's formative role in the UK Society for the Study of Labour History, of which he was the first secretary.Joan Allen, Alan Campbell and John McIlroy, Histories of Labour: National and International Perspectives (2010), p. 28. At the heart of Harrison's achievement as a historian are three books. # Learning & Living (1961), described as 'the most influential and widely read work in the field of adult education history'.'John Harrison: an appreciation', Living and Learning, ed. M.Chase and I.Dyck (1996), p. 1. # Robert Owen & the Owenites in Britain and America (1969), published in the USA under its subtitle The Quest for a New Moral World. # The Second Coming: Popular Millenarianism, 1780‚Äì1850. In his conclusion, Harrison commented: We see only as through a glass, darkly. At the end of this book it is apparent how little we know about what ordinary people \\"think and feel\\".' However the editors of his festschrift (see Honours below) believe Harrison 'as much as any historian of the nineteenth century, has opened up the history of ordinary people, their thought and feelings. His work is anything but doctrinaire, and it has eschewed preoccupation with narrow, male-dominated, labour movement institutions'. John Harrison's autobiography (Scholarship Boy: A Personal History of the Mid-Twentieth Century, 1995) is informative not only about the author's academic career but also life in pre- war Leicester and military service with the King's African Rifles. Honours For his 75th birthday his lifetime's work was celebrated by his colleagues with a festschrift: * This original collection of critical essays on issues of eighteenth- and nineteenth-century rural life, popular politics and beliefs brought together fifteen well-known historians. All were associated with Harrison, and all shared his interest in the importance of the personal in history, as opposed to the history of impersonal institutions. Among the essays on popular belief were studies of millenarianism, the secularist tradition and a case study of American Muggletonianism ‚Äì the last by E. P. Thompson. Other essays addressed Owenism, Chartism, the Chartist Land Plan, gender and autobiography, vegetarianism and popular journalism. There were critical evaluations of the influence of America on British radicalism and socialism, on the motives that drove workers' children to become teachers, and on the construction of images of English rural life.

History After this initial phase (18th century), Minderico began to expand its vocabulary continuously and creatively. This expansion was (and continues to be) intimately related to the socio-cultural experiences of the inhabitants of Minde. For example, names and nicknames of well-known persons from Minde and the neighbouring areas were used as lexemes to express physical or psychological characteristics, as these characteristics were salient for those persons. This method of lexical formation can be explained by the fact that Minde, due to its geographical isolation, is a small and close knit community, where everyone knows one another. Therefore, using names of persons as a means to express the characteristics associated to them was immediately understood amongst members of the speech community; this was not an obstacle to effective communication. The Interdiciplinary Centre for Social and Language Documentation (CIDLes), an institution dedicated to the research and documentation of endangered languages in Europe and the development of language technologies for lesser-used languages, is now working on the linguistic documentation of Minderico and, together with the speech community, on its revitalization.

He was a New York City civic leader who served as the Deputy Mayor of the City of New York, and President of the New York City Board of Education. He is often confused with his father of the same name, Robert F. Wagner Jr., who served as Manhattan Borough President and Mayor of the City of New York during Robert III‚Äôs youth. He was also the grandson of Senator Robert Ferdinand Wagner I. He changed his name to Robert F. Wagner Jr. after his father dropped the ‚ÄúJr‚Äù. Biography Robert III was the son of Robert Ferdinand Wagner II and his first wife Susan. Robert III was nine years old when his father, the Manhattan Borough President, was elected to the first of three terms as the Mayor of The City of New York. He was educated at the Buckley School in Manhattan, Phillips Exeter Academy, graduated from Harvard University in 1965, studied abroad at the University of Sussex, and then earned an MPA with a concentration in Urban Affairs from the Woodrow Wilson School at Princeton University. Public service Wagner was an elected City Councilman-at-large in Manhattan. He lost the Democratic primary for Manhattan Borough President (his father's old job) to Andrew Stein in 1977, which seemingly ended the possibility of Wagner ascending to higher elected office. He served as Deputy Mayor for Policy, Head of the City Planning Commission, Head of the Health and Hospitals Commission, and President of the New York City Board of Education under New York City Mayor Edward Koch. More noteworthy, Wagner served as a Senior Policy Adviser to New York City mayors and New York governors for over twenty years. Primarily a Democrat, he supported Republican-Liberal Rudolph Giuliani in his candidacy for mayor against David Dinkins. At the time of his death, Wagner was serving as Senior Policy Adviser to Mayor-Elect Rudolph Giuliani of New York City, who was expected to return Mr. Wagner to his post as a Deputy Mayor; was chairman of the civic group Citizens Union; was vice-president of the polling organization LH Research; and had expressed an interest in joining the Democratic Presidential administration of Bill Clinton in an urban policy capacity - his expertise. Death On November 15, 1993, Wagner died from complications due to AIDS in San Antonio, Texas, while researching a book he was writing on urban America. He had complained of flu-like symptoms to friends in the two days preceding his death, but had not sought medical treatment. He was survived by his younger brother Duncan. A memorial service was held for him at St. Patrick's Cathedral.

Although the initial research was essentially descriptive in an attempt to describe language development from the stand point of social development, more recently, researchers have been attempting to explain a few varieties of acquisition in which learner factors lead to differential acquisition by the process of socialization; called the theory of \\"social interactionist approach\\".Gallaway, C. & Richard, B.J. 1994, Input and Interaction in Language Acquisition, Cambridge University Press, UK. Socio- cultural theory Vygotsky, a psychologist and social constructivist, laid the foundation for the interactionists view of language acquisition. According to Vygotsky, social interaction plays an important role in the learning process and proposed the zone of proximal development (ZPD) where learners construct the new language through socially mediated interaction. Vygotsky's social- development theory was adopted and made prominent in the Western world though by Jerome BrunerBruner, J. (1983). Child's Talk: Learning to Use Language\\" Oxford: Oxford University Press. who laid the foundations of a model of language development in the context of adult-child interaction. Under the social interactionist approach, a child's language development occurs within the child's construction of a social world, also known as the \\"social- cognitive model\\". (Behaviorism, by contrast, emphasizes the role of stimulus- response conditioning in language acquisition.) Under SIT, the deepest level of representation specifies the communicative intent primarily and semantic content secondarily. This approach to language acquisition theory combines the \\"traditional behavioral\\" approach and \\"linguistic-semantic\\" approach to language production. Under SIT, language acquisition is thought to occur differently than under other predominant theories. It emphasizes how environment shapes acquisition. This is more relevant with regard to children's acquisition than with adult acquisition. Two open questions remain for SIT. One, how does a child's knowledge change in the course of development? Two, how is- or how was- the existing language system of an adult formed? Social integrationists describe a dynamic system where typically children cue their parents into supplying the appropriate language experience that children require for language advancement. In essence, that allows efficient communication despite its primitives.Niedzielski, N.A. & Preston D.R. 2003, Folk Linguistics, Walter de Gruyter, Berlin. (By contrast, the behavioral approach posits that children are passive beneficiaries of the language training techniques employed by their parents. Also by contrast, the linguistic approach posits that children are active language processors of whose maturing neural systems guide development.) Current strand Social- interactionists, such as Alison Gopnik, Andrew Meltzoff, Anat Ninio, Roy Pea, Catherine Snow, and Ernest Moerk theorize that interaction with adults plays an important part in children's language acquisition. However, some researchers such as Bambi B. Schieffelin and Elinor Ochs claim that the empirical data on which theories of social interactionism are based have often been over-representative of middle class American and European parent-child interactions. Anthropological studies of other human cultures, as well as low- educated Western families, suggests rather that many of the world's children are not spoken to in a manner documented for educated Western families, but nevertheless grow up to be fully fluent language users. Many researchers now take this into account in their analyses. In addition, social interactionists criticize the claim made by Noam Chomsky according to which the linguistic input children are presented with by adults addressing them, is full of errors and discontinuities. Another argument of nativists on which interactionists provide contrary empirical evidence is the availability of negative feedback on, and corrections of, children's errors.Moerk, E.L. (1983). A behavioral analysis of controversial topics in first language acquisition: Reinforcements, corrections, modeling, input frequencies, and the three-term contingency pattern. Journal of Psycholinguistic Research, 12, 129-155 Moerk (1994) conducted a meta-analysis of 40 studies and found substantial evidence that corrections do indeed play a role. From this work, corrections are not only abundant but contingent on the mistakes of the child.Moerk, E.L. (1994). Corrections in first language acquisition: Theoretical controversies and factual evidence. International Journal of Psycholinguistics, 10, 33-58 (see behavior analysis of child development).

The Other Cinderella) is a 1977 American erotic musical comedy film directed by Michael Pataki and starring Cheryl \\"Rainbeaux\\" Smith, Brett Smiley, and Sy Richardson. Plot An adaptation of the fairy tale, Cinderella traces the misadventures of Cinderella (Smith), who suffers abuse from her two incestuous stepsisters and her man-crazy stepmother. Cinderella longs for the day when she will escape her drudgery and struggles to keep her spirits up until then (\\"Cinderella\\"). The Prince (Smiley), a jaded young man who no longer feels pleasure from ordinary sex (\\"My Kingdom Won't Come\\"), has been reluctant to marry, to the concern of his bickering parents the King and Queen. The King decides to host a ball in the hopes that the Prince will find at least one woman who satisfies his sexual urges (\\"The Royal Ball\\") and sends forth the Royal Chamberlain to invite all the willing women in the land. The Chamberlain, however, is more interested in his own sexual conquests and is delayed by his constant attempts to seduce the women he is meant to be inviting. Word of the ball reaches Cinderella and her stepsisters. The stepsisters gloat about how they will seduce the Prince (\\"Do It To Me\\"). They humiliate Cinderella by dumping ashes and garbage over her, then set out for the ball without her. Cinderella, heartbroken, cries herself to sleep and has a nightmare about being sexually assaulted. With Cinderella asleep and the family gone, a wanted cat burglar and self-proclaimed transvestite and kleptomaniac (Richardson) ducks into the empty house to hide from an angry mob. Upon being discovered by Cinderella, he convinces her that he is her \\"fairy\\" godmother and sends her upstairs to bathe while he burgles the house (\\"Grab It\\"). When Cinderella emerges fully cleaned, he is amazed at her beauty and decides to help her after all. Producing a \\"magic wand\\" he has stolen previously, he is astonished to discover that the device really works and uses it to give Cinderella a beautiful gown. As a finishing touch, the Fairy Godmother enchants Cinderella's vagina into \\"a snapper\\" to make her irresistible to the Prince. The wand bears a warning that the magic will only last until midnight. The Fairy Godmother accompanies Cinderella to make sure she leaves on time, but secretly uses the opportunity to steal the crown jewels. Meanwhile, Cinderella's desperate stepmother throws herself at the reluctant Lord Chamberlain (\\"It's So Hard To Find A Man\\"). At the ball, the Prince indulges in a blindfolded orgy with every willing woman in his kingdom, but finds himself bored by them all until he encounters Cinderella's magical vagina. He falls instantly in love with her, but before he can learn her true identity, the clock strikes midnight, and the Fairy Godmother rushes Cinderella away with the full court in pursuit (\\"Oh, A Snapper!\\"). The following day, the Prince must have sex with every woman in the land in order to identify his beloved. By the time he reaches Cinderella's house, he is so exhausted that he must be brought in on a stretcher, and Cinderella must approach him cowgirl style. Recognizing \\"the snapper,\\" the Prince declares Cinderella to be the girl he loves, and the two depart for the palace. On their way, they see that another angry mob has captured the Fairy Godmother and intend to execute him for burgling the royal palace. Cinderella quickly tells the Prince that the Fairy Godmother was the one who gave her her magical vagina, and the Prince halts the execution and offers the Fairy Godmother a royal pardon and a position in court. The Fairy Godmother jumps aboard their carriage and declares that the story has ended happily for all before settling back to watch Cinderella and her Prince have sex.

The organ is believed to be the oldest tracker-style pipe organ in Michigan.  History  The First Congregational Church founded in 1882 by a small group of Scottish residents, headed by Allen McIntyre, which included a number of prominent businessmen and employees of the local Calumet and Hecla Mining Company. It soon became apparent that the congregation would need its own church, and a building committee was formed in 1886. The Calumet and Hecla Mining Company donated land, and the committee procured architectural drawings from Holabird and Roche, using them to build the church for an original cost of $8325. The building was dedicated in February 1887, three months before a devastating fire swept through Lake Linden; the church was one of the few frame buildings in the area to escape damage. The church continued to be in use until the 1980s, when the congregation dwindled to the point where they were not large enough to maintain the building. The church was deeded to the Houghton County Historical Society, which has continued to use and maintain it as the Houghton County Heritage Center. Limited restoration has been ongoing since 1993; the restoration included repainting the church in the original colors.

It is used as an alternative to the widely used but vaguely defined term Buddhist. Dhamma practitioner is seen by many as a more accurate description for those who practice the Buddha's teachings, and more fitting with classification schemes given in the Pali Canon. In contrast, the terms Buddhist and Buddhism are relatively recent inventions that some see as a Westernized framing of the teachings of the Buddha in terms fitting for religions such as Christianity, and not words that have an equivalent in the teachings of the Buddha. In the earliest sources, the Buddha himself referred to his teaching as the \\"Dhamma and Discipline proclaimed by the Tathagata\\". Due to these reasons and the fact that the Buddha's teachings are strongly rooted in practical application, the term Dhamma Practitioner has been used by many teachers as a description of those on the Buddha's path.http://www.ajahnchah.org/book/Opening_Dhamma_Eye1.php \\"So the Dhamma practitioner must become one who witnesses the Dhamma for himself.\\"http://www.imisangha.org/articles/Be_A_Professional_Dharma_Practitioner.html Traditional classification schemes for those on the Buddha's path The seven types of individuals In the Pali Canon, several suttas record a scheme of classification to denote those on the Buddha's path, classed as 'the seven types of individuals', differentiated by the degree to which they have attained liberation and the means by which they have achieved this end. One such scheme is recorded in the Kitagiri Sutta (MN 70) http://www.metta.lk/tipitaka/2Sutta-Pitaka/2Majjhima- Nikaya/Majjhima2/070-kitagiri-e1.html The Buddha elaborated on each one as follows: The first two are references to Arahants, those who have completed the Buddha's teachings and attained enlightenment. Arahants who have mastered the formless attainments are known as \\"liberated both ways\\", whilst those who have not attained the formless dimensions are called \\"released through discernment\\".  Those who have become a stream-enterer and also abide in the meditative formless dimensions are known as \\"bodily witness\\". * Those who have become a stream-enterer but have not attained the meditative formless dimensions are known respectively as \\"attained to view\\" and \\"released through conviction\\", depending on the way in which they developed the path.  Finally those who are yet to become a stream-enterer but are still on the path are known as a \\"Dhamma-follower\\" and a \\"Conviction-follower\\", depending on whether the faculty of wisdom or the faculty of faith is strongest.  The eight types of individuals Another classification scheme found in the Pali Canon is that based on the four stages of enlightenment, often broken down into \\"the eight types of individuals\\". That is the four groups of noble disciples when taken as pairs: # the path of one practicing for the fruit of stream-entry # the fruition of stream-entry # the path of one practicing for the fruit of once-returning # the fruition of once-returning # the path of one practicing for the fruit of non-returning # the fruition of non-returning # the path of one practicing for the fruit of arahantship # the fruition of arahantship. Taking each attainment singly gives the \\"eight types of individual.\\"  References  * Category:Buddhist titles ","title":"Dhamma Practitioner"},{"id":"24016288","text":"Denis Petrovich Sinyayev (; born 13 October 1984) is a Russian professional football player.

There is also a version for four players. It bears many similarities to Dou Shou Qi, Game of the Generals and the Western board game Stratego. It is a non-perfect abstract strategy game of partial information, since each player has only limited knowledge concerning the disposition of the opposing pieces. Because of the Chinese nature of the game, terms used within the game may vary in translation. Luzhanqi is mainly played by children as a precursor to games like xiangqi and weiqi,Haiwang Yuan; The magic lotus lantern and other tales from the Han Chinese, Libraries Unlimited, 30 May 2006 p52Terill, Ross; Flowers on an iron tree: five cities of China, Little, Brown, 1975 p199 but people of other ages may also enjoy it as a game of leisure. Objective The aim of the game is to capture the opponent‚Äôs flag through penetrating his defenses, while trying to prevent him from capturing the player's own flag. Board The Luzhanqi board has a number of features which affect how pieces move. *Post (ÂÖµÁ´ô) - also Soldier Station: a normal space, marked as a rectangle on the board. Pieces can move on or off these spaces at will, and can be attacked and captured on the *Roads - usually marked as thin lines on the board. A piece can only travel one space across a road at any time. *Railroads ‚Äì usually marked as thick lines on the board, a piece can travel any number of spaces along a railroad in a straight line, as long as its path is not obstructed by another piece. *Campsite (Ë°åËê•) ‚Äì marked as a circle on the board, with 5 in each player's territory. A piece on a campsite cannot be attacked. *Mountains (Â±±Áïå) ‚Äì pieces cannot move over these two spaces. *Frontlines (ÂâçÁ∫ø) ‚Äì these three spaces are the only points at which a piece can enter the opponent‚Äôs territory. Pieces do not land on these spaces, they pass over them. *Headquarters (Â§ßÊú¨Ëê•) ‚Äì positioned at two sides of the central axis at the sixth rank of the player's territory, the Flag must be placed on one of these two spaces. Any piece that has been placed on or has entered headquarters can no longer move. Pieces The pieces Each player has 25 pieces, which are identical except for markings on one side. They are listed here in order of order, where any piece of a higher order may capture one of lower order (if the enemy is of the same order, both pieces will be removed from the board). Each player has: *one Field Marshal (Âè∏‰ª§), order 9 *one General or Army Commander (ÂÜõÈïø), order 8 *two Major Generals or Division Commanders (Â∏àÈïø), order 7 *two Brigadier Generals or Brigade Commanders (ÊóÖÈïø), order 6 *two Colonels or Regiment Commanders (Âõ¢Èïø), order 5 *two Majors or Battalion Commanders (Ëê•Èïø), order 4 *three Captains or Company Commanders (ËøûÈïø), order 3 *three Lieutenants or Platoon Commanders (ÊéíÈïø), order 2 *three Engineers or Sappers (Â∑•ÂÖµ), order 1 *two Bombs (ÁÇ∏Âºπ) *three Landmines (Âú∞Èõ∑) *one Flag (ÂÜõÊóó) Some of these pieces have special features and abilities: *The Engineers are the only pieces which can turn corners when travelling along the Railroad. Engineers can also capture Landmines without being removed from the board. *Bombs, when in contact with any opponent piece, destroy both itself and the piece. They may capture the opponent's flag. Bombs cannot be placed on the front line (the first rank) during the initial set-up. *Landmines are immune to any attack, and cause the destruction of attacking pieces (except when attacked by an Engineer or destroyed by a bomb). Depending on the ruleset used, Landmines may or may not be removed from play following a capture. Landmines may only be placed on the fifth and sixth ranks during set-up. The Landmine cannot move from its original position. *The Flag must be placed on one of the two Headquarters spaces on the sixth rank. It cannot move. Its capture brings the victory of the attacker and ends the game. Also, when Field Marshal is destroyed, the Flag must be revealed to the opposing player. Gameplay Both players begin by arranging their pieces on their half of the board, with the markings that indicate rank facing towards them (and hence invisible to the opponent). Some version allows the pieces to be placed face up, allowing both players to see them. Initially, all pieces must be placed on posts or headquarters; bombs may not be placed on the first rank, landmines must be placed on the last two ranks, and the flag must be placed in one of the headquarters spaces. Play then proceeds by turns, with each player moving one piece per turn. On each move a piece may move to any connected adjacent space, or use the Railroad lines to travel to more distant spaces. When a piece lands on a space occupied by an opposing piece, the respective orders of the two pieces are compared (either by the players or by an independent referee). The lower-ordered piece is removed from the board; if the two are of equal order, both are to be removed from the board. Special pieces (see above) also play their respective roles. As soon as a player's Field Marshal (order 9) is lost (having collided with the opposing Field Marshal, or was destroyed by a bomb or landmine), he must declare so by revealing the headquarters in which his Flag is placed. When a player attacks his opponent's headquarters, he will win the game if he enters the one with the flag; if he picked the other headquarters, then normal attacking rules apply, and if the attacking piece captures the headquarters piece, it must remain there and not move, revoking its purpose as a piece. However, with this, it becomes obvious to the attacking player that the flag must be planted in the other headquarters. (Some variants do not include this rule.) Strategies It is feasible to send the Brigadier Generals or Major Generals (order 6 and 7) to attack the opponent's pieces, for these pieces are effective in getting rid of lower-ordered pieces and identifying those of higher order. Smaller-ordered pieces can be used to infiltrate the opponent's campsites, while Engineers are employed to remove landmines when the route to the opponent's fifth and sixth ranks is clear. Bombs should be sent to campsites as soon as possible to prevent accidental bombing, and should only be employed to destroy the highest-ordered pieces of order 8 and 9, to defend one's own flag from being captured, or to destroy a blocking landmine. The arrangement of landmines and nearby pieces should also be carefully thought out to secure the defense of the headquarters. Four-player version A typical 4-player Junqi gameboard One of the main spin-offs of Luzhanqi is derived from arranging a board for four-players, with each taking up a territory adjacent to another at 90-degree angles. Players at opposite ends team up to defend against the other pair; the game ends when both players of a team has their flags captured, or when all sides are unable to defeat each other and thus agree to a draw. If a player has his flag captured, he must admit defeat, thus removing all of his pieces off the board. He may also do so by resigning if his situation looks hopeless. In this case, if his ally across the board is still in the game, the game continues; otherwise, it ends with the victory of the other team. Even if a player admits defeat or resigns, his team may still win if his ally is able to defeat both opposing teams. As shown in the diagram, there will no longer be Mountains or No-man's Lands, for the 9 shared spaces in the middle of the territories will be public territory. There are now curved railroads, where the rule for railroads still apply across the curve for all pieces: in a single turn, moving pieces can still travel along any part of the yellow line in the diagram, but not in the direction of the arrow. Engineers are still spared from this restriction and may move to any space accessible via railroads. Other variants There are many variant rules of Junqi. Before a game, players usually decide which rule to use. Common *\\"Flying Bombs\\": Under this rule, Bombs move the same way Engineers do. *\\"Explosive Mines\\": Under this rule, An attempt by pieces (other than an Engineer) to capture a Mine kills both the moving piece and the Mine, as opposed to killing only the moving piece. An Engineer still captures a Mine. This rule is more common in 2-players game. Two players *\\"Flag Carrier\\": Under this regional variant, games are not won by merely capturing flags. In order to win, a player has to let a piece \\"take\\" the flag with it, and carries it back to his/her own flag. A piece carrying the flag moves normally, and if it is captured, the Flag returns to the original headquarters it was in. Also, under this variant, pieces do not become immobile upon entering a headquarters. Four players *\\"Allied Visible\\": Under this rule, a player has the right to know his/her ally's piece arrangement, i.e. the rank of all his/her ally's pieces. (In some online games, allied players' pieces are simply made visible to each other.) *\\"All Visible\\": Under this rule, all players place their pieces with their marked side up, that is, making all pieces' rank visible to all players, effectively making it an abstract strategy game of full information.

The trams were imported from Sweden, where they had originally run on the Gothenburg Tramway under the designation M25. The trams were originally delivered to the Gothenburg Tramway between 1958 and 1961. A total of 36 trams were eventually exported to Oslo, Norway, numbered 264 to 299. History 125 trams were built by H√§gglund for G√∂teborgs Sp√•rv√§gar, where they were designated M25 and given the serial numbers 501‚Äì625. They were built between 1958 and 1962. Following the decision to change from left to right-side driving on Dagen H on 3 September 1967, the tram company ordered an additional 130 trams in the M28 and M29 series. The M25s were then sent back to H√§gglunds to be converted to right-hand driving, with doors on both sides. Two trams were then driven back-to-back, and the direction of the trams could simply be reversed on Dagen H. Oslo In the early 1990s, the Ring 3 bypass highway was being upgraded, and this caused a disruption to the Gr√ºnerl√∏kka‚ÄìTorshov Line at Storo where it crosses this highway. To continue operations on the line, trams had to turn without a turning loop, but the company did not have enough trams which could run this way. However, Gothenburg had a number of surplus M25 trams capable of running back to back trams. The trams were therefore purchased by Oslo at the token price of NOK 1 each, although upgrading the trams for Oslo use cost NOK 200,000. The rear travelling car in a back-to-back set had to be closed during a trip as its doors were facing the wrong side of the road. The trams were phased out as they were replaced with the new Italian articulated trams (SL95). 2001 accident Safety concerns regarding the SM91 were raised after a fatal accident during the evening rush hour at Holbergs plass on 16 January 2001. A mother with a stroller caught her foot by the tram doors as she was entering, and was dragged behind the tram when it started to move. The injuries she sustained were fatal. It was later found that the tram driver had reported trouble with the tram's doors several times in the hours before the accident. Four minutes before the accident, she had requested a new tram, but was denied one because there were no more trams available. Prior to the fatality, there had been several incidents with passengers getting caught in the doors as they were carrying strollers, although in the previous incidents the tram had been able to stop before the situation became more serious. In the aftermath of the accident, Oslo Sporveier stopped coupling the trams together in two-car trains and ran them only individually. The safeguards against people getting trapped in the doors were also replaced, and emergency handles were installed. Both the tram company and the female 30-year-old tram driver were charged with negligent homicide. In the Oslo District Court, both the company and the driver were acquitted on the homicide charge, but found guilty on lesser counts. On appeal, the tram company was finally convicted in Borgarting Court of Appeal and ordered to pay a fine of NOK 5 million; this was the first time a company had been found guilty of homicide in Norway. The conviction against tram driver on the lesser counts regarding failure to demonstrate due care in the traffic were upheld, and she received a 30-day suspended jail sentence. Specifications The M25 Class was built by H√§gglunds as 125 single-car trams from 1958 to 1962. The standard gauge trams are long, wide and weigh . They are equipped with two bogies, each with two axles, giving a Bo'Bo' wheel arrangement. The axle distance is , the bogie-centre distance is and the wheel diameter is . Each tram had four motors totalling in power output, giving a maximum speed of . The trams seated 38 people and stood 38 more.

It is a short, quiet and narrow (4 metre wide) open laneway, running between Little Bourke Street and Lonsdale Street in the central business district of Melbourne. Caledonian Lane is most notable as the former home to the St Jerome's Laneway Festival. It is also notable due to controversial developments in 2009 involving the redevelopment of the Post Office precinct and Department Store precinct also involving the shutting down of both St Jerome's and the festival. A consortium involving Myer and Colonial First State applied for exemption from the City of Melbourne Heritage Overlay to widen the lane by 4 metres to improve access for delivery trucks and in the process demolish the Art Deco Lonsdale House in 2009. Permission was granted by both the City of Melbourne and the State planning minister Justin Madden MP on 24 July 2009 under controversial circumstances. In response to the demolition for the sake of lane widening, a preservation group called Save Lonsdale House formed in late 2009. Until 2004, Caledonian Lane was home to a number of small independent store owners, however the buildings were sold under vacant possession in 2007. The lane is bitumen with a small strip blue stone cobbled gutter, has street lighting attached to Lonsdale House and is by both pedestrian and vehicular traffic, mainly delivery trucks.

It is intended to be posted outside rooms of patients with an infection that can spread through airborne transmission. An airborne transmission is disease transmission through small particulates that can be transmitted through the air over time and distance. Diseases capable of airborne transmission include many of considerable importance both in human and veterinary medicine. The relevant pathogens may be viruses, bacteria, or fungi, and they may be spread through breathing, talking, coughing, sneezing, raising of dust, spraying of liquids, flushing toilets, or any activities which generate aerosol particles or droplets. Human airborne diseases do not include conditions caused by air pollution such as volatile organic compounds (VOCs), gases and any airborne particles. Airborne transmission is distinct from transmission by respiratory droplets. Respiratory droplets are large enough to fall to the ground rapidly after being produced (usually greater than 5 Œºm ‚Äì although this arbitrary cut-off value has never been demonstrated experimentally or supported theoretically), as opposed to the smaller particles that carry airborne pathogens. Also, while respiratory droplets consist mostly of water, airborne particles are relatively dry, which damages many pathogens so that their ability to transmit infection is lessened or eliminated. Thus the number of pathogens that can be transmitted through an airborne route is limited. Overview Airborne diseases include any that are caused via transmission through the air. Many airborne diseases are of great medical importance. The pathogens transmitted may be any kind of microbe, and they may be spread in aerosols, dust or liquids. The aerosols might be generated from sources of infection such as the bodily secretions of an infected animal or person, or biological wastes such as accumulate in lofts, caves, garbage and the like. Such infected aerosols may stay suspended in air currents long enough to travel for considerable distances; sneezes, for example, can easily project infectious droplets the full length of a bus.https://www.chicagotribune.com/opinion/ct-xpm-2014-04-19-ct-sneeze-germs- edit-20140419-story.html Airborne pathogens or allergens often cause inflammation in the nose, throat, sinuses and the lungs. This is caused by the inhalation of these pathogens that affect a person's respiratory system or even the rest of the body. Sinus congestion, coughing and sore throats are examples of inflammation of the upper respiratory air way due to these airborne agents. Air pollution plays a significant role in airborne diseases which is linked to asthma. Pollutants are said to influence lung function by increasing air way inflammation. Many common infections can spread by airborne transmission at least in some cases, including but not limited to: measles morbillivirus, chickenpox virus; Mycobacterium tuberculosis, influenza virus, enterovirus, norovirus and less commonly coronavirus, adenovirus, and possibly respiratory syncytial virus. Because the drying process often damages the pathogens, the number of diseases that can be spread through an airborne route is limited. Airborne diseases can also affect non-humans. For example, Newcastle disease is an avian disease that affects many types of domestic poultry worldwide which is transmitted via airborne contamination. Often, airborne pathogens or allergens cause inflammation in the nose, throat, sinuses, and the upper airway lungs. Upper airway inflammation causes coughing congestion, and sore throat. This is caused by the inhalation of these pathogens that affect a person's respiratory system or even the rest of the body. Sinus congestion, coughing and sore throats are examples of inflammation of the upper respiratory air way due to these airborne agents. Routes of transmission Airborne infections usually occur by the respiratory route, with the agent present in aerosols (infectious particles < 5 ¬µm in diameter). This includes dry particles, often the remainders of an evaporated wet particle called nuclei, and wet particles. This kind of infection usually requires independent ventilation during treatment. e.g., tuberculosis. Transmission Environmental factors influence the efficacy of airborne disease transmission; the most evident environmental conditions are temperature and relative humidity. The sum of all the factors that influence temperature and humidity, either meteorological (outdoor) or human (indoor), as well as other circumstances influencing the spread of droplets containing infectious particles, as winds, or human behavior, influence the transmission of airborne diseases. *Rainfall, the number of rainy days being more important than total precipitation; mean daily sunshine hours; latitude and altitude are relevant when assessing the possibility of spread of any airborne infection. Some infrequent or exceptional events influence the dissemination of airborne diseases, including tropical storms, hurricanes, typhoons, or monsoons. Climate determines temperature, winds and relative humidity, the main factors affecting the spread, duration and infectiousness of droplets containing infectious particles. The influenza virus is spread easily in the Northern Hemisphere winter due to climate conditions which favour the infectiousness of the virus. *After isolated weather events, the concentration of airborne fungal spores is decreased; a few days later, an exponentially increased number of spores is found, compared to normal conditions. *Socioeconomics has a minor role in airborne disease transmission. In cities, the spread of airborne disease is more rapid than in rural areas and urban outskirts. Rural areas generally favor higher airborne fungal dissemination. *Proximity to large bodies of water such as rivers and lakes can be a cause of some outbreaks of airborne disease. *Poor maintenance of air conditioning systems has led to outbreaks of Legionella pneumophila. *Hospital-acquired airborne diseases are associated with poorly-resourced medical systems, which make isolation challenging. Prevention Some ways to prevent airborne diseases include disease-specific immunization, wearing a respirator and limiting time spent in the presence of any patient likely to be a source of infection. Exposure to a patient or animal with an airborne disease does not guarantee contracting the disease, as infection is dependent on host immune system competency plus the quantity of infectious particles ingested. Antibiotics may be used in dealing with air-borne bacterial primary infections, such as pneumonic plague. The United States Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) advises the public about vaccination and following careful hygiene and sanitation protocols for airborne disease prevention. Many public health specialists recommend physical distancing (also known as social distancing) to reduce the transmission of airborne infections.

Taking its inspiration from the world‚Äôs biggest half marathon the Great North Run, Great Swim uses the formula of mass participation events to provide a focus and a challenge for which the individual can train. After the success of the inaugural Great North Swim on 14 September 2008, which attracted over 2,200 swimmers of all ages and abilities (including five of the six Olympic Open Water Medallists), the series was expanded in 2009 to 4 events. The Great London Swim took place for the first time on 15 August 2009 in Royal Victoria Dock. The Great Scottish Swim took place on Saturday 29 August 2009 at Strathclyde Park, followed by the Great North Swim on 12 and 13 September 2009 and finally the Great East Swim on Saturday 26 September in Alton Water. In 2010 the series was extended to include an event in Salford Quays. All events that year were televised on Channel 4 with hour shows dedicated to each event with extended coverage of the elite races. In addition, 500m swims have been added to the program at some venues as well as a 2 mile swim which was called The Great North Swim the Extra Mile when introduced in Windermere. However, 2010 saw the cancellation of both the Great Scottish and Great North Swims due to the presence of blue-green algae at both sites, leaving several thousand swimmers disappointed. 2011, however had 10,000 swimmers sign up to the Great North Swim, held over 3 days and included two mile, one mile and half mile events. The Great Salford Swim was shown live on BBC that year but has since been re-branded as The Great Manchester Swim (although still taking place at the same venue). After a further cancellation of the Great Scottish Swim in 2012, a new venue, Loch Lomond, has been chosen as the venue for the event for 2013. The Great Manchester Swim was cancelled from 2017. Most events feature an elite race for women and another elite race for men, combined with a series of \\"waves\\" of other swimmers with up to 200 swimmers in each wave. The course is GPS calibrated to ensure that the exact distance is covered and each competitor is electronically timed, either with a chip strapped to the ankle, or with chips stuck on the cap issued to each swimmer. Although not specifically a charity swim, many participants have raised money for a range of charities. Specific charity partners are nominated for each event (and sometimes are able to provide entries) but no restrictions are in place around fund-raising.

It is recorded in the National Heritage List for England as a designated Grade I listed building. Originally it consisted of two medieval houses which were joined together in the 18th century. The pavement runs through the ground floor storey of the northern part of the building, leaving a separate cabin or chamber between the pavement and the road. History The building dates from the mid- to late 15th century, and is said to be the oldest surviving intact medieval house in Chester. It was originally two houses, which were joined in the 18th century. It formed part of Lorimer's Row, a group of buildings with an arcade at ground level, as distinct from the Rows in the centre of the city whose walkways are at the first floor level. From an early date, the south part of the building has been an inn, its first licence possibly dating from 1494. The separate cabin or chamber has been used for a number of functions; these include being a ticket office for stage coach operators in the 18th century and in the 20th century a soda fountain bar and a barber's shop. In the 19th century the southern part of the building was an inn while the northern part housed a shop. The inn closed in the 1930s. In 1948 the building was used as an antique shop but its condition deteriorated so much that it was threatened with demolition. In the 1950s the Chester Civic Trust campaigned for its survival, it was restored, and has since been used as a clothes shop and, more recently, as a restaurant. Architecture The building is timber- framed on a sandstone plinth with brickwork added later which has subsequently been rendered and painted. The roofs are of grey slates. The two buildings comprising the whole have separate frames each with roofs leading to gables over the street. At ground level the southern part of the building has an arcade open to the street with a pier to the south and an octagonal column south of the centre. The northern part has a separate cabin or chamber adjacent to the street with the walkway between its rear and the rest of the building. On the street side of the chamber is a three-pane canted oriel window and a door. On the upper floor each part of the building has a horizontal window with a small one-paned window between them.

Plot summary Gunfighter Ernie Parsons escapes hanging for the killing of a disreputable character by the false testimony of a woman attracted to him. During his escape, he finds the body of a murdered minister. Searching the corpse, Ernie discovers a letter from a town who have invited the deceased man sight unseen to be their town minister. Ernie appropriates the victim's clothes and belongings to escape his pursuers and vows revenge on the minister's murderer. Welcomed to town, Ernie's first action is to preside over a funeral of Sam Underwood, a man murdered on the orders of town boss Mr. Ross. Attracted to Underwood's daughter, Ernie decides to stay, using his gunfighter skills to stand up to Ross. Ernie is disgusted by the cowardice of the townspeople, dismissing Ross's men as mere cowboys wearing pistols as opposed to professional gunfighters. With his men cowed by the preacher's gunfighting skills, Ross hires a professional gunfighter to kill him. The two hold a duel in the center of town. When both miss each other at close range, the gunfighter takes it as a sign and leaves. Parsons is ambushed by Ross's men and dragged through the desert and left for dead. He is found in the desert and brought back to the Underwood's home. Parsons arranges for a fake burial and takes to the hills, attacking Ross's men through surprise attacks. Eventually, Parsons is persuaded to head back to town. Parsons holds a service at church and is interrupted by Ross, who pretends to arrange a truce. The next day, Ross and his men come to town to ambush Parsons. Parsons asks for the help of men from the church, but they are too scared to help. When Parsons takes on Ross and his men alone, some of the men come to his aid. Ross is killed by Parsons and the war is over. Free to marry Underwood's daughter, Parsons instead rides away, feeling his work is done and his impersonation of a preacher will only lead to trouble. As Parsons rides away, he meets a preacher heading to town to investigate the events. The preacher convinces Parsons that he was right to protect the town in his own way, but doesn't convince Parsons to return.

She was the first woman to serve as foreign editor of a major international news organization, the first woman news director of an American television network and the first woman to serve as spokesman for the Secretary General of the United Nations. Early life Foa was born in Buffalo, New York. Her family moved to Troy, New York, when she was seven. She graduated from Barnard College of Columbia University in 1967. She went on to major in journalism and East Asian studies as a Carnegie Foundation Fellow, earning a master's degree from Columbia in 1969. Career UN spokesman In 1996, Foa became the first woman to serve as the spokesman for the United Nations Secretary General in the 51-year history of the organization. In a profile of Foa in the New York Times of August 5, 1996, correspondent Barbara Crossette wrote that \\"When Secretary General Boutros Boutros-Ghali put Ms. Foa, a strong-willed and irreverent former journalist, in charge of his public image and that of the world organization in January, some diplomats were aghast.

As UN Spokesman, Foa frequently clashed with the U.S. Administration which was refusing to pay its UN dues and seemed determined to oust Boutros-Ghali as a gesture to Senator Jesse Helms. Helms was rumored to have demanded Boutros- Ghali's removal as UN Secretary General in return for approving the appointment of UN Ambassador Madeleine Albright as US Secretary of State. In July 1996, James Rubin, Albright's spokesman at the U.S. Mission to the U.N., threatened to investigate and take action against any UN employee found to be campaigning for Boutros-Ghali's re-election. Foa pounced. She accused the Clinton Administration of resorting to bully tactics akin to McCarthyism in the US in the 1950s. She offered herself as the first target of investigation \\"because I think he is doing a great job.\\"Chronology of the Secretary General Election 1996.

When Newsweeks Indo-China correspondent Fran√ßois Sully was killed in Cambodia, Foa was sent to take over the Phnom Penh beat. There, she was considered one of the most dogged journalists, earning the enmity of high-level U.S. government officials.Holly Sklar. Washington's War on Nicaragua. 1999. p. 90 In April 1973, she was expelled from Cambodia at the request of the U.S. Embassy because of her reporting on the U.S. government's violation of the Cooper-Church Amendment. That amendment, passed in reaction to the 1970 American invasion of Cambodia, forbid the provision of American advisors to the Cambodian army and prohibited all air operations in direct support of Cambodian forces. Her reporting brought Richard Moose and James G. Lowenstein, Indochina investigators for the U.S. Senate Foreign Relations Committee, to Phnom Penh. When U.S. Embassy officials told them that Foa's stories were ridiculous, they went to her office to ask about the source of her reports. There they listened on Foa's transistor radio to embassy officials directing the bombing by American warplanes. The Senate ordered an immediate halt to the bombing of Cambodia.Coups and Earthquakes: Reporting the World for America by Mort Rosenblum. 1979.Sideshow: Kissinger, Nixon and the Destruction of Cambodia by William Shawcross. Simon and Schuster. 1979. Cambodia expulsion After her expulsion from Cambodia, where she had worked as a stringer for both Newsweek and United Press International, Foa joined UPI in Hong Kong. In October 1973, Prince Norodom Sihanouk agreed to an interview with her in Beijing. Foa spent nearly a month traveling across China. She was one of the first American reporters allowed to visit China, which was still in the throes of the Cultural Revolution. From Hong Kong, Foa had reporting stints in New Delhi, Rome, Vienna and Bangkok before being sent to Hong Kong as UPI's Asia Pacific news editor in 1982. Foreign editor In 1984, she was named foreign editor of United Press International ‚Äì becoming the first woman foreign editor of a major international news organization. As foreign editor, she supervised the work of 175 editors and correspondents covering nearly every nation on earth. Her appointment as UPI's foreign editor two years later was short-lived. Foa had just completed a restructuring of the Mexico City bureau, when UPI was purchased by Mexican Mario V√°zquez Ra√±a. V√°zquez called Foa into his office and ordered her to cancel the appointment of the new chief correspondent, Louis Toscano, because Toscano \\"was not polite to the Mexican government.\\" Foa refused. The new owner asked if she could learn just two words in Spanish: \\"Si Senor.\\" Foa shook her head and was fired.Down to the Wire: UPI's Fight for Survival by Gregory Gordon and Ronald E. Cohen. McGraw-Hill. 1989. News director and vice president for news In 1986, she became vice president for news and news director of Univision, a Spanish-language network with 500 affiliates across the Americas. She thus became the first woman news director of a major U.S. television network. Emilio Azcarraga, a Mexican television magnate and V√°zquez' biggest rival, was setting up a Spanish-language television network in the United States when he read reports of Foa's firing. He immediately hired her as his news director and vice president for news, telling aides \\"Anyone who tells V√°zquez to stuff it is for us.\\" UN refugee work In 1991, Foa was asked by the U.N. High Commissioner for Refugees to come to Geneva and overhaul their public image. She is widely credited with turning the agency into the most respected of all UN organizations. Foa had often covered refugee situations. Her father, Joseph V. Foa, had been forced into flight when Italian dictator Benito Mussolini enacted racial laws aimed at the Jews of Italy. Foa spoke out frequently podium repeatedly on behalf of Iraqi Kurds, Rwandans and Bosnians. When Serb troops moved against the Bosnian enclave of Srebrenica, Foa urged the international community to speed the deployment of peacekeepers to the region. The more than 50,000 people crowded in Srebrenica, she said, \\"are very frightened, because they know, as we've seen, that the life expectancy of a Bosnian soldier on Serb territory is very short.\\" \\"People don't do dirty things in the night when international observers are walking around,\\" said Foa. \\"I don't think the Serbs will risk the wrath of the world by moving in.\\"Srebrenica Succumbs. TIME. April 26, 1993. However, in July 1995, more than 8,000 Bosnian men and boys were massacred in Srebrenica by units of the Army of the Republika Srpska led by General Ratko Mladic. The 400 Dutch peacekeepers were helpless in the face of the huge Serb force. Foa gave UNHCR such a high profile that her work caught the eye of Secretary General Boutros Boutros-Ghali. \\"Some officials and diplomats assigned to the United Nations say that in response to the bad publicity, Mr. Boutros-Ghali wanted to give the United Nations a brash new face and image, particularly in the United States. Others say the Secretary General saw Ms. Foa as a valuable personal asset in a year in which he would be seeking a second term. \\"He thought she could do for him what she had done for Mrs. Ogata (the High Commissioner for Refugees),\\" one European diplomat said. Foa, aware that Washington was determined to veto Boutros-Ghali for a second term, made a symbolic statement about its unwillingness to pay dues. She carried a blue beret, like the ones worn by UN Peacekeeping forces around the world, to her daily briefing. Symbolically, she took off her hat to nations that did pay.Fight for financial health, U.N. pushes members to pay up.

The New York Times. April 21, 1996. In July 1996, Burundi looked on the verge of repeating the 1994 Rwandan genocide beginning with the massacre of at least 304 people in Bugendana. Shortly thereafter, President Sylvestre Ntibantunganya was deposed. Foa urged the international community to act before they saw appalling TV images of slaughter. \\"Unfortunately, it is not until we see babies being macheted to death on TV, that public opinion forces their governments into action,\\" she said. \\"We do not want to see that this time.\\"Appearance by Sylvana Foa on BBC News, July 25, 1996. Together with the then head of the UN Peacekeeping Department, Kofi Annan, Foa aimed to put emotional pressure on the U.S. and other Western powers through the media.

The United States did not feel it had vested interests in Burundi.Media Coverage; Help Or Hindrance in Conflict Prevention by Nik Gowing. Carnegie Commission on Preventing Deadly Conflict. 1997. At the end of Boutros-Ghali's term, Foa moved to Israel to live with her long-time partner, businessman Shmuel Dankner. For several years she wrote an extremely popular column, \\"Letter from Israel\\", for the Village Voice. She occasionally undertakes missions for the United Nations or NGOs from Liberia to Uganda and teaches a course at local universities entitled \\"So, You Want To Change the World?\\" Awards Foa was twice nominated for a Pulitzer Prize. The first was for her coverage of the assassination of Indian Prime Minister Indira Gandhi, which included a 3,000‚Äìword profile based on an interview Foa conducted shortly before the Prime Minister's murder. The second was for her coverage of the 10th anniversary of the end of the Vietnam War, including an exclusive interview with Le Duc Tho.

Kavanah is a theological concept in Judaism about a worshiper's state of mind and heart, his or her sincerity, devotion and emotional absorption during prayers. In Hasidic Judaism, a Jewish tradition that emphasizes piety, Kavvanah is the emotional devotion, self-effaced absorption during prayers rather than a liturgical recitation driven religiosity. In esoteric Jewish mysticism (Kabbalah), Kavvanah refers to the practice where the devotee concentrates on the secret meanings of prayer letters and words, sometimes referring to the permutations of the divine name. Some kavanot are particular to the tradition of Kabbalah during meditation. Kavanah has been much debated subject among Judaism scholars, with traditional sources accepting that Jewish rituals without at least minimal kavanah is insufficient.Kavvanah, Judaism, Encyclop√¶dia BritannicaShulchan Aruch 60:6 and 589:8 Different Jewish authorities see various levels of kavanah required for various rituals, and especially for prayer. Some prayerbooks (siddurim) list kavanot for particular prayers. Some particular kavanot are associated with particular holidays, for example Sukkot, Pesach, Shavuot, and others. Discussion Kavvanah comes from an ancient verbal root also found where the object or subject is the \\"heart\\". It connotes \\"to direct, to prepare, to establish\\", an orientation of mind, heart, intention. According to Moshe Halbertal, it implies concentration and sincerity, it is not rote recitation but the very essence of a prayer where the devotee expresses a plea and supplication to God, while really believing, feeling, meaning the prayer. Kavvanah is both emotional and intellectual devotion, states Herman Cohen. According to the rabbinic tradition, both action and proper intention is important during a prayer, and kavvanah refers to the latter. A related term in Judaism is kavvanot, states Pinchas Giller, which refers to \\"ideas, texts and formulae\\" to be contemplated during praying. Kavanah in prayer requires devotional belief and not merely reciting the words of a prayer. According to Sutnick, this implies that the worshiper understand the words of the prayer and mean it, but this can be difficult for many Jews today when they pray using liturgical Hebrew, which many Jews outside of Israel do not understand. In Hasidism, it is one of four themes of religious worship and spiritual striving. The true faithful constantly contemplates the presence of the divine (hitbonenut), constantly cleaves and communes with the divine (devequt), intensely ecstatically feels the divine (hitlahavut), and is intently devoted to this divine (kavvanah). The Kavanah is therefore the strength that the devotee uses in the intention towards God: in other words, it is a sort of concentration followed by the truthful perception of a response to faith, that is, when one is certain that God listens, precisely during the ecstatic action of the bond with God, in this realization. According to the Hasidic tales but not only, children also know how to reach a good level of kavanah and it isn't absolutely useless to teach them Shema, even before Bar mitzvah In Chovot HaLevavot Chovot HaLevavot (Duties of the Heart) by Rabbi Bachya ben Joseph ibn Paquda (section 8, chapter 3), gives 3 general categories for kavanah under the rubric \\"the different ways of serving God\\": # duties of the heart alone ( which is the subject of his book) To be humble and reverence respect to God and to Love God with all your heart, all your soul and all your strength (To love God with sincere and honesty) and keep your heart, your mind your thought to regard humility, reverence respect, to have good wills, loving kindness, morality & virtues towards God and towards another: # duties of the body and heart together, such as prayer, Torah study, praising and glorifying God, teaching wisdom, enjoining right conduct, warning against evil, and the like; # duties of the limbs alone, in which the heart has no part except for initially directing the act to God, for example sukkah, lulav, tzitzis, mezuzah, observing Shabbos and the festivals, giving charity, and similar duties in which distraction by other thoughts does not harm the one who performs them. Kabbalah In Kabbalah, Kavanah often refers to the permutations of the divine name that aim at overcoming the separation of the forces in the Upper World.

It was written by Jeff Greenstein and Bill Wrubel and directed by series producer James Burrows. The episode originally aired on the National Broadcasting Company (NBC) in the United States on November 21, 2002. Guest stars in \\"Marry Me a Little, Marry Me a Little More\\" include Harry Connick Jr., Katie Couric, Judith Ivey, and Debbie Reynolds. The episode focuses on Grace (played by Debra Messing) impulsively accepting a marriage proposal from her boyfriend Leo (Harry Connick, Jr.) despite that the two have only known each other for a short time. They get married and tell their friends about the news, despite Grace's best friend Will's (Eric McCormack) unease about the whole idea. Grace and Leo decide to host a wedding reception for themselves, but at the festivity, Grace learns unsettling details about Leo, which gives her reason to wonder if she has made a mistake. Before the episode aired, some critics worried that bringing Leo into the storyline would disrupt the friendship between Will and Grace. Co-creator David Kohan, however, believed the two characters had to \\"move on forward in their lives in some way\\", and sought to assure the worrying critics that a third individual added to the mix would be unlikely to replace Will as the best friend of Grace. NBC was also in full support of creating a triangle between the three characters, stating that it was a way for the producers to find a new \\"spark\\" for the series. Once the episode aired, it received generally mixed reviews from television critics. Despite this, \\"Marry Me a Little, Marry Me a Little More\\" was watched by 24.3 million households in its original airing, according to Nielsen ratings. The episode also garnered Will & Graces second-largest audience ever among adults aged 18 to 49. The Nation magazine commented that this was the first time that a prime-time sitcom showed a Jewish protagonist (Grace) marrying inside the faith. Plot Katie Couric, co-host of The Today Show, appears in the episode. When Grace (Debra Messing) and her boyfriend Leo (Harry Connick Jr.) take a walk around Central Park, they notice a tent and a van parked nearby, after a bride and groom ran past them. Eager to know what is happening, Grace stops by the van, sees Katie Couric, and asks her what is going on. Katie tells Grace that The Today Show is having massive televised weddings in the park for ratings sweeps week. When Katie asks Grace and Leo if they would like to get married, Leo says yes, but Grace believes he is being sarcastic, only later realizing that he is serious. Leo explains to Grace that because they originally met in a park, they should also get married in a park. Leo proposes and Grace accepts, despite that the two have only known each other for two months. Upon arriving at Will's (Eric McCormack) apartment, Grace and Leo reveal to their friends, Will, Jack (Sean Hayes), and Karen (Megan Mullally), that they have gotten married. The friends' reactions to the news are not positive; in particular, Grace's gay best friend Will is uneasy about the whole idea. Leo and Grace, however, assure Will that they will have a wedding reception in honor of him, which improves Will's relationship with both Grace and Leo. During the reception, Grace learns many things she did not know about Leo, including that his first name is Marvin (revealed by his mother, Eleanor (Judith Ivey)). So many unsettling details about Leo come to light that Grace becomes uneasy and leaves the reception; Leo follows her. The two run into Katie in the lobby who tells them that The Today Show has scrapped the wedding segment because the judge who performed the ceremony was not licensed in New York so their marriage is not valid. Upon learning this, Grace tells Leo that she needs time to think about their relationship. Leo returns to the reception and announces to everyone that his marriage to Grace is not legitimate. Grace returns to the reception later, and reveals that she does want to marry Leo. At a Jewish synagogue, where Grace and Leo's wedding is to take place, Grace learns from her mother, Bobbi (Debbie Reynolds), that her father will not be able to walk her down the aisle. Grace panics, but Karen suggests that Will should walk with her instead. She agrees and calls upon him. Although Will at first declines to give her away because of the prior argument, they make up and he finally escorts her down the aisle. After the wedding reception, Will, Grace, Leo, Jack, and Karen walk through Central Park enjoying Grace and Leo's marriage. Production \\"Marry Me a Little, Marry Me a Little More\\" was written by Jeff Greenstein and Bill Wrubel and was directed by series producer James Burrows. It was the one-hundredth episode of Will & Grace, and the producers celebrated the milestone by planning an hour-long episode followed by a clip show featuring highlights and outtakes from past seasons. In an interview with The Jewish Journal in 2001, David Kohan, the co-creator of Will & Grace, in discussing the lead characters, stated that a marriage could be a problem for the dynamic between the two characters: \\"I'd love for [Grace] to find a Jewish love interest, but that relationship might actually work, and then there'd be no more 'Will & Grace'.\\" Kohan, however, changed his mind by the time of a follow-up interview in 2002: he noted that the characters had to \\"move on forward in their lives in some way\\" and it would be unlikely that Grace's possible husband would displace her gay best friend, Will. In July 2002, reports surfaced that a possible wedding involving Grace would happen, but the staff were not allowed to reveal anything. Musician Harry Connick Jr., was cast in the role of Leo. Musician Harry Connick Jr., was cast in the role of Leo. He received a call from co-creators Kohan and Max Mutchnick asking him to appear on Will & Grace, and agreed to do it after learning that it was his wife's favorite show. According to Debra Messing, who plays Grace, Kohan and Mutchnick had a specific vision of Grace's husband from the start. They thought it was important that Grace meet a \\"menschy, nice Jewish man who happens to be a hottie, and that's what we got with Harry Connick Jr,\\" she said. According to The Nation magazine, this was the first time that a prime- time sitcom showed a Jewish protagonist (Grace) marrying inside the faith. Connick, who is part-Jewish, said he enjoyed the fact that he was not asked to sing on the show, because \\"it throws you out of character a little bit when that stuff happens. It's been great just doing the acting thing.\\" Messing, in discussing Grace and Leo's relationship, commented that it is \\"unlike anything that Grace has ever been a part of before and just the little that we've done so far, it feels wonderful to be playing with Harry.\\" In another interview, also discussing the characters' relationship, she explained, \\"...bringing Leo into it and making it a viable and potent relationship for Grace, that's never happened before. I think she's a little less frenetic and neurotic, and I think that really being in love markedly changes Grace. That sexual energy in a great way has shaken things up, because it is the greatest threat to the friendship of Will and Grace to date.\\" Before the Grace and Leo storyline was written, NBC worried that the show's characters never seemed to move forward or mature. They wanted the show to be more like Friends, which received higher ratings because of its romantic storyline cliffhangers. Greenstein commented that \\"there was an interchangeability among the episodes from season to season. We wanted to create more continuing story arcs; we wanted to deepen the predicaments the characters are in, get the audience kind of rooting for something from week to week.\\" In November 2002, negotiations were made for Connick to play a series regular on Will & Grace; he originally signed on for only 13 episodes. Jeff Zucker, who at the time served as President of NBC Entertainment, commented that creating a triangle between Will, Grace, and Leo was a \\"brilliant\\" way to give the series a new spark. He was confident that it would be well received by the audience and the fans. The Central Park scenes were filmed in November 2002. The episode was filmed over three days at the end of October and beginning of November 2002. It was supposed to take only two days, but the filming of the wedding scenes was postponed after Messing got sick on the first day. On November 3, 2002, the rooftop terrace scene was filmed at the New York Palace Hotel. In November 2002, the scene in Central Park was shot in New York. The wedding ceremony was filmed, in part, at Temple Israel of Hollywood. As the actors performed their lines in front of a studio audience, the writing staff stood behind the cameras taking notes in the script and watching the audience's reaction to jokes. The writers often stopped the cameras and added new inflections to the dialog. According to the Knoxville News Sentinels Terry Morrow, the cast handled the changes quickly, and scenes were routinely redone up to three times even if the actors executed their lines properly. Debbie Reynolds and Judith Ivey guest-starred in the episode as the mothers of Grace and Leo, respectively. Reynolds had played Grace's mother in the episode \\"The Unsinkable Mommy Adler\\" in season one, while Ivey played Connick's mother in the previous episode, \\"The Needle and the Omelet's Done\\". Katie Couric portrayed herself in the episode. Vera Wang designed Grace's wedding dress, which cost approximately $20,000. The show's costume designer, Lori Eskowitz-Carter, provided Sergio Rossi boots worth $1,750 for the episode, while Grace's jewelry was supplied by Martin Katz. Reception \\"Marry Me a Little, Marry Me a Little More\\" brought in an average of 24.3 million viewers during its original airing on November 21, 2002, the second-largest audience ever for a Will & Grace episode; as a result, CSI: Crime Scene Investigation received its smallest audience that season. The episode received an 11.8 rating/27% share among viewers in the 18-49 demographic, making it Will & Graces second-largest audience ever in that demographic. Editor Peter Chakos was nominated for an Emmy Award in the category of \\"Outstanding Multi-Camera Picture Editing for a Series\\" at the 55th Primetime Emmy Awards. The episode received a mixed reception from television critics. Alan Pergament of The Buffalo News commented that \\"like all hourlong episodes of comedies, this one becomes a little bloated in the middle. But it holds up for the most part and has some very funny and poignant moments, including an emotional rooftop scene between Will and Grace that defines their friendship.\\" Whitney Matheson of USA Today said she \\"was bored to tears\\" by the episode, while Jeffrey Robinson of DVD Talk thought it was a \\"fun episode\\". Seth Davis of Sports Illustrated was not complimentary towards Connick: \\"Whoever came up with the idea to cast Connick on Will & Grace should be fired.\\" A writer from Entertainment Weekly, however, commented that Leo \\"fits right in to the antic Will & Grace world of Will, Grace, Jack, and Karen.\\" Matt Roush of TV Guide was not thrilled of the idea of Grace getting married, writing: \\"Well, is the show called Will & Grace & Leo? I don't think so.\\" The Star-Ledgers Alan Sepinwall commented that Will & Grace \\"has already been infected with a sense of cattiness and despair, as the writers try to top each other's nasty one-liners. A happy, healthy relationship could be just the cure for what's ailing the one-time Emmy winner.\\" Bill Carroll, Vice President and Director for the Katz Television Group, a consulting firm, wondered where the show would head after Grace got married: \\"The real question now is, where is the critical development of that show going to be? Now that they've married her off, where is the show's focus?\\" The Hartford Courants Roger Catlin did not think Grace's and Leo's marriage would last long. \\"Are we to believe Will & Grace will now be about a married woman, her husband and her gay roommate? That they'll all still live together? That Connick will no longer have merely special-guest status? The inevitable breakup and annulment to come are as obvious as the sweeps-timing of the ceremony.\\" References External links * \\"Marry Me a Little\\" at IMDb * \\"Marry Me a Little, Marry Me a Little More\\" at TV.com * \\"Marry Me a Little More\\" at IMDb Category:2002 American television episodes Category:Television episodes about weddings Category:Will & Grace episodes Category:Television programs directed by James Burrows ","title":"Marry Me a Little, Marry Me a Little More"},{"id":"24016702","text":"\\"I Dies from Love\\" was the eighth episode of the first series of the British television series, Upstairs, Downstairs.

Also involved with the committee is Marjorie's best friend, Lady Prudence Fairfax, (who becomes annoyed with the newcomer when she brags about her daughter Wilhelmina becoming great friends with Lady Prudence's daughter, Agatha, whom she had only met the night before) and Lady Templeton, an elderly, acerbic and slightly eccentric lady who can't stand being cooped up with a herd of women as she complains to an amused Hudson. Marjorie however sees her as a good person, and mentions that Richard says she is the sanest person he knows. Emily's kitchen work is suffering as a result of her ardor for William, (in this episode she is also pulling double duty as under-house parlourmaid, which allows her to work with Rose) and she is receiving a great deal more verbal lashings from Mrs. Bridges. An example is when Emily mistakenly put salt into the sugar jar, which ruins one of Mrs. Bridges' puddings. Meanwhile, Mrs. Van Groeben pulls Lady Marjorie aside and tells her that she thinks that their charity should only be given to a few privileged servants, which annoys Lady Marjorie. Lady Marjorie sharply tells her guest that the committee's efforts are to help everyone in domestic service, and not just a certain few. The uncaring Mrs. Van Groeben then changes the subject, attempting to impress Lady Marjorie with news of a house party held by Lord Nicholson, only to be stunned when Marjorie fondly refers to him as \\"Toby Nicholson\\", revealing that she is a close friend of his. Emily and William spend their days off together often, and Emily falls deeply in love with William and wants nothing more than to marry him. But Mrs Van Groeben, who is somewhat unsympathetic and more than a bit snobbish (her tendency to be condescending to everyone makes her immediately disliked by Lady Marjorie and Lady Prudence, and absolutely loathed by Lady Templeton), forbids the relationship out of envy and firmly orders William to stop seeing her, bribing him with promises of a new uniform and an increased status in her household. The cowardly William obeys, not wanting to jeopardize his promotions, claiming he never saw Emily as anything more than \\"a bit of fun.\\" Meanwhile, back at 165 Eaton Place, Lady Marjorie, in a much more kindly manner than Mrs. Van Groeben, tells Emily that William cannot see her anymore, and Emily's heart breaks. Lady Marjorie is more sympathetic towards Emily's situation because she had been through the same thing with her son, James's friend, Charles Hammond. The other below stairs members, with the exception of Rose, are too preoccupied to notice Emily's misery. Mrs Bridges continues her vicious tongue lashings at Emily, taunting her about William's real intentions and mocking her dreams of marriage, until Rose, discovering what is going on and hearing the cook's spiteful taunting, harshly puts a stop to it and comforts a sobbing Emily. Emily sends William a love letter, penned by Rose, declaring how much she loves him. However, the next morning, while bringing a hamper of food for a servants' outing to Hampstead Heath (the reason for the meetings that Lady Marjorie had with Lady Prudence, Lady Templeton and Mrs. Van Groeben), William cruelly ignores a distraught Emily; while Harris, the Van Groebens' head coachman, returns her unopened letter and kindly explains to a broken-hearted Emily that he has a lot of new duties. He then encourages her to look forward to the outing and the grand time she would have. The next day, during the preparations for the servants' outing, Emily, overcome with grief, commits suicide by hanging herself in her room. A sobbing Rose, who discovered Emily's dead body when she was sent to get her for the outing, tells Hudson what happened. Hudson tells Lady Marjorie the news and while he goes to explain the situation to the other servants, a shaken Lady Marjorie reveals that her kitchen-maid has \\"had an accident\\" to Lady Prudence, Lady Templeton and an uncaring Mrs. Van Groeben. Meanwhile, below stairs, Mrs. Bridges is sitting in her chair, crying brokenheartedly, and feeling very guilty, the devastated Bellamy staff stay behind from the servants' outing, and Hudson, using his various contacts, has the undertakers, Mr. Waterman and Mr. Lowe, take her body out of the house. When told that she was more or less going to be used for medical research (as she was a Catholic who killed herself and could not be buried in consecrated ground, and was considered a mortal sinner), Hudson was rocked to the core, and sharply tells the undertakers that God will forgive her! and after praying for the Lord's mercy on her soul, Hudson wipes tears from his eyes. Emily's body is then carried from the house. In the novelization of the scripts by John Hawkesworth, it is told that after Emily kills herself, the other Bellamy servants viciously condemn William, and Lady Marjorie severs all social contact with Mrs. Van Groeben and her family because of the tragedy. However, in the series' next episode, Why is Her Door Locked?, Lady Marjorie mentions that Mrs. Van Groeben raved about a dinner that Mrs. Bridges had prepared the previous night.

In addition to creating and maintaining other area trails for the Connecticut Forest & Park's (CFPA) Blue- Blazed Trail System, he also organized Sherman, Connecticut's first Boy Scout troop in 1931, as well as the Housatonic Trail Club in 1932, for amateur and avid hikers. History While hiking in 1929, Ned Anderson met Judge Arthur Perkins, a member of CFPA's Connecticut's Blue Blazed Trails Committee, who introduced Anderson to Myron Avery. These two men were drumming up interest in Benton MacKaye's vision of a 2,000-mile contiguous footpath from Maine to Georgia‚ÄîThe Appalachian Trail. Most people with whom they met were interested but few were committing to it; Anderson took an immediate interest.Tomaselli, Doris. 2009. \\"Ned Anderson: Connecticut's Appalachian Trailblazer ‚Äì Small Town Renaissance Man\\". Sherman Historical Society. Sherman, CT. . pp. 47-62 Taking on dual roles as Chairman of CFPA's Blue Blazed Trails' Housatonic Section (officially ‚Äì 1932), and as a member of the Appalachian Trail Conference's (ATC--now Appalachian Trail Conservancy) Board of Managers (he was the ATC's 49th member), Ned mapped and cleared, cut, hacked, and blazed the state's trail from Dog Tail Corners in Webatuck, NY, (coming from Bear Mountain across the Hudson River) which borders Kent, CT, at Ashley Falls, all the way up to another Bear Mountain at the Massachusetts border. Anderson spearheaded and maintained the Candlewood Mountain, Schaghticoke (SCAT-uh-coke) and Housatonic Range trails as well. Ned Anderson organized Sherman's first boy scout troop in 1931 (Troop #48), and the boys earned badges by trailblazing. To spread the interest in hiking, nature and the trail, he organized The Housatonic Trail Club (HTC,) in 1932, which gave a portion of its annual dues to the ATC. Anderson and his volunteers maintained upkeep of his trails for nearly twenty years (1929-1948). In between, members piled in his bus (see biography below) and were treated to hikes all over New England. Anderson drew the first official maps for the statewide Blue Blazed Trail System, which were made available to hikers in individual booklets. A comprehensive map was soon published in the 1933 issue of the Telephone News. CFPA's 1934 proposal to publish a complete trail guide finally came to fruition in 1937, with the first edition of the Connecticut Walk Book. It featured Ned's Candlewood Mountain Trail. This and Ned's Schaghticoke and Housatonic Range trails were also highlighted in a smaller publication, Walk Around New Milford. The entire Appalachian Trail was completed in 1937 and by 1939 the National Park Service and U.S. Forest Service were working to formalize and protect the trail as a ‚Äúscenic trailway.‚Äù Anderson officially retired from trail management in 1948 at age 63, whereupon the ATC board passed a formal resolution expressing their gratitude and sincere appreciation for his labors and accomplishments and distinguished service on behalf of the Appalachian Trail. Legacy Ten Mile River In 1949, volunteer members of the Appalachian Mountain Club (AMC) took over maintenance of Connecticut's portion of the AT. In 1968, the National Trails System was created, and the Appalachian Trail was the first trail so designated. In 1979, a portion of Connecticut's Appalachian Trail was rerouted. (The ATC has worked over the years to move more of the trail off public roadways and to allow for protected ‚Äúcorridors.‚Äù) This was a combined effort between the Naromi Land Trust of Sherman, CT, and the Appalachian Trail Conference. Along this new leg at the confluence of the Ten Mile and Housatonic rivers north of Sherman, CT, a bridge now spans the waterway. In an unprecedented move by the ATC, it bears a plaque in dedication‚Äîto Ned K. Anderson.Tomaselli, pp. 62-75 Today, the Appalachian Trail is maintained by 31 trail clubs and multiple partnerships, and managed by the National Park Service, United States Forest Service, and the nonprofit Appalachian Trail Conservancy. In fact, over 5,500 volunteers log over 200,000 hours of service annually. Volunteers from the Connecticut Chapter of the Appalachian Mountain Club maintain the whole of the Connecticut section of the Appalachian Trail. The ATC has expanded its role to include education, science and awareness in addition to trail maintenance and protection.Tomaselli, pp. 65-66 Connecticut Forest & Park Association continues to be a strong advocate for trails and conservation efforts throughout Connecticut and continually updates and publishes the Connecticut Walk Book, which is now done in two volumes--East and West, and features over 800 miles of trails. The Blue Blazed trails Anderson created and oversaw as a section manager have long since been delegated each to individual leaders and teams and continue to thrive. Anderson was included in the 2015 class of the Appalachian Trail Hall of Fame at the Appalachian Trail Museum. Personal life Born in Hartwell, Ohio, in 1885, Ned Anderson spent his youth in Mt. Vernon, NY, while his father worked for his wife's family's renowned, NYC-based Kipp Wagon Works. Anderson enjoyed the outdoors and developed an early love of nature and hiking. He attended both Columbia and Cornell (studying geology) for a time.Tomaselli, pp. 3-46 In 1906, his father retired and purchased Brae Burn farm (a poultry operation) in Sherman, CT. Ned (at 20) went along to work it. He continued to hike and camp. In 1914 he met and married Lena May Clark. The couple had four children. Anderson worked for the Long Island-based Sperry Company and lived in Brooklyn during World War I. It was there that Lena died of the flu epidemic in 1919. Anderson took his children back to the farm, soon met and married Edna Holstein, a city girl visiting family. They were married in 1921, and had one child together. The farm switched from poultry to dairy and the couple opened their 1840 farmhouse as a country bed and breakfast. Guests came from all over the world. When their oldest son was ready for high school, Anderson bought a bus to ensure that Clark would get home in time to do his chores. And for the next thirty-three years, most of the children in Sherman went to and from school in a punctual, orderly and, by all accounts, adventurous fashion. On Sundays, Anderson used the bus to fetch area children for Sunday school and return them all home again. He asked no compensation for this ‚Äúgood deed‚Äù and provided his services faithfully for twenty-five years. Ned and Edna shared an avid interest in and enthusiasm for young people. Their home was always open to and often filled with their children's friends. They also believed firmly in upgrading the educational experience in and out of the classroom. While Edna was instrumental in organizing Sherman's first PTA and bringing much needed services to the school district and into the schools, Anderson, who thought the world‚Äîespecially the outdoors‚Äîa most worthy classroom, sought to bring their bus-riding passengers an education on the way to and from school and via an array of entertaining class trips. Since the bus was privately owned, the Andersons could take their view of education on the road‚Äîand so often did. Over the years, the Andersons suffered setbacks, such as the Great Depression, when the price of a gallon of milk dipped to that of a 3¬¢ postage stamp. And there were devastating tragedies: the death of a child and a catastrophic fire that destroyed their barn, equipment, supplies, and much of their herd. Although the HTC hikers and the Sherman community rallied to raise moneys for the Andersons, it was a financial loss from which they never fully recovered. Edna became an artist and well-respected jewelry designer. She showed at Society of Connecticut Craftsmen (SCC) fairs, sold in NYC's fine department stores, and at the artist co-op she and Ned ran at Brae Burn Farm. He often collected and polished the stones she would use in her gold and silver designs. In addition to hiking,Tomaselli, p. 24 Anderson also had a love for exploring nature underground as well. In the late '20s and '30s, he accompanied and assisted author, Clay Perry, to map and explore (and discover) caves. Their investigations of--and treks and crawls through--caves, abandoned mines, gorges and other subterranean finds across New England, were chronicled in Perry's 1939 book, Underground New England. The National Speleological SocietyTomaselli, p. 24 was organized in 1941 in Washington, DC. The first chapter or ‚Äúgrotto‚Äù formed of the NSS was the New England Chapter of Middlebury, CT. Co-organized by spelunker and author, Clay Perry and Ned Anderson, who was also its V.P. Anderson officially retired from trail management in 1948 at age 63.Tomaselli, p. 61 He avidly continued hiking and spelunking for a number of years. Even as he got older and less sure-footed, he was known to take a jaunt with walking stick or cane, down the lane to visit with neighbors. Edna said that when her husband's legs gave out, so did he. Anderson died in 1967 at age 82.

The OpenBoot ROM is able to boot from network, using RARP and TFTP.https://www.netbsd.org/docs/network/netboot/intro.sun.html Like all other SPARCstation systems, the IPC holds system information such as MAC address and serial number in NVRAM. If the battery on this chip dies, then the system will not be able to boot without manual intervention (keyboard entry of boot parameters).  NVRAM  The SPARCstation IPC uses an M48T02 battery-backed RTC with RAM chip which handles the real time clock and boot parameter storage. An issue with this chip is that the battery is internal, which means the entire chip must be replaced when its battery runs out. As all SPARCstation IPCs made are now older than the battery life of this chip, a substantial number of these systems now refuse to boot. Additionally, the SPARCstation IPC design used the reserved bits in the M48T02's NVRAM in a non- standard way; since later revisions of the M48T02 chip exert stricter control over these bits, a current M48T02 will store the NVRAM data, but the RTC will not function correctly and the system may fail to auto-boot. Due to incompatibilities with modern M48T02s, it is common to modify failed NVRAMs by cutting into the encapsulation and patching in a new battery.http://www.menet.umn.edu/~bob/FAQ/sun-nvram-hostid.faq It is also possible to replace the entire encapsulation, which also contains a 32.768 kHz clock crystal.https://www.vintage-radio.net/forum/showthread.php?t=71241 Operating systems The following operating systems will run on a SPARCstation IPC: *SunOS 4.0.3c onwards *Solaris 2.0 to Solaris 7 *Linux ‚Äì Some but not all distributions still support this SPARC32 sub-architecture *NetBSD/sparc32 since 1.0 *OpenBSD/sparc32 - All versions up to 5.9 (OpenBSD 5.9 was the last release to support SPARC32https://www.openbsd.org/sparc.html)  Related computers  The SPARCstation 1+ (Sun 4/65) is architecturally very similar but housed in a pizza box form factor The SPARCstation IPX (Sun 4/50) is a later lunchbox form factor system  See also  * SPARCstation * SPARCstation 5 References  External links  * Obsolyte: SPARCstation IPC * Parts List for SPARCstation IPC * SunSolve Documentation Category:Sun workstations Category:SPARC microprocessor products ","title":"SPARCstation IPC"},{"id":"24016902","text":"Kandukuru may refer to: * Kandukur, Prakasam district, a village in Prakasam district, Andhra Pradesh, India * Kandukur revenue division, Prakasam district * Kandukuru, Khammam district, a village in Khammam district, Andhra Pradesh, India * Kandukur, Ranga Reddy district, a village in Ranga Reddy district, Telangana, India ","title":"Kandukuru"},{"id":"24016906","text":"In mathematics, the theta function of a lattice is a function whose coefficients give the number of vectors of a given norm.

Biography McClure was born the son of John and Margaret McClure. His father was the architect on the Earl of Galloway‚Äôs estates in Wigtownshire and at the time of John's birth was supervising the building of the parish church in Kirkudbright. Career in China After an education at nearby Sorbie he joined the Merchant Marine. He was employed by the Taku Tug & Lighter Company, as a sailor based in Tianjin, China, and later for many years was a ship‚Äôs captain for Hong Kong- based Jardine, Mattheson, and Co. and so knew the coasts of China well.‚ÄòAberdeen Weekly Journal‚Äô of Thursday, 22 November 1894 Before the start of the First Sino-Japanese War he had been the Master of the merchant vessel Kow Shing, which had built in 1883 in Barrow-in-Furness in England and which flew under the British flag. He had returned to England for the acceptance of his vessel and had sailed her back to China. The Kow Shing was sunk by a squadron of the Imperial Japanese Navy in the Battle of Pungdo, marking the start of hostilities between the Empire of Japan and Empire of China; however, McClure was no longer in command of the Kow Shing by July 1894. He had been appointed to command the Chinese dispatch boat Pei-Ho and was carrying dispatches between Port Arthur, Chemulpoo and other Chinese ports. By mid- November 1894 McClure had been appointed ‚ÄúAssistant Admiral of the Beiyang Fleet‚Äù.‚ÄòThe Times‚Äô of Saturday, 17 November 1894. As well as being made an Admiral by the Chinese he was also appointed a Mandarin of the highest class Admiral Ding Ruchang committed suicide after the retreat of the Beiyang Fleet from the Battle of the Yalu River (1894) into the naval base of Weihaiwei. Along with Ding Ruchang several other senior Chinese officers committed suicide on the 12‚Äì13 February 1895 after their failure to stop the Japanese at the Battle of Weihaiwei. Ding Ruchang had started surrender negotiations with the Japanese commander on 12 February but after the suicides of all the senior Chinese staff command of the Beiyang Fleet fell to McClure who wrote a letter of surrender in Admiral Ding‚Äôs name, and had it translated into Chinese and transmitted to the Japanese on the morning of 12 February. Per the terms of the letter, the remaining ships, forts and stores were surrendered to the Japanese. McClure requested that all Chinese troops, civilians and the foreign military advisors be allowed to depart unmolested, and suggested that the British China squadron oversee compliance with the surrender agreement. Admiral It≈ç Sukeyuki of the Imperial Japanese Navy, despite the reservations of some members of his staff, agreed to all terms. McClure was taken to Japan as a prisoner of war after the surrender, and from there was repatriated to the United Kingdom, and subsequently settled in Kirkcudbright. After 1895 McClure died at his home \\"Seaview\\", Garlieston, Dumfries & Galloway, Scotland on 18 January 1920 after a long illness. He was aged 83. He had only moved to Garlieston in the last two years of his life so he was buried in the town he was born in and lived in when he returned from China.
