She served in the Pacific during World War II. Lamson participated in the Battle of Tassafaronga, and remained undamaged until hit by a Japanese kamikaze during the recapture of the Philippines. Lamson was sunk during the Operation Crossroads atomic weapons tests at Bikini Atoll in 1946. History Lamson was laid down 20 March 1934 by Bath Iron Works Corp., Bath, Maine; launched 17 June 1936; sponsored by Miss Francis W. Andrews; and commissioned 21 October 1936, Commander H. E. Paddock in command. After shakedown in the Atlantic and Caribbean, Lamson departed Norfolk, Virginia 16 June 1937 for the Pacific. Arriving San Diego, California, 1 July, the destroyer performed exercises and tactical training operations until she sailed for Pearl Harbor 5 October 1939. Lamson continued training operations from her Hawaiian base for the next 2 years. She was returning to Pearl Harbor from patrol duty during the Japanese attack 7 December 1941. After a search for the Japanese task force, the destroyer patrolled Hawaiian waters and steamed to Johnston Island to rescue civilians. Departing Pearl Harbor 6 January 1942, Lamson arrived Pago Pago, Samoa, 2 weeks later for ASW patrols, then was assigned to the ANZAC Squadron in the South Pacific. During early March she arrived in the Fiji Islands to join the expanded ASW screen which was formed to keep the South Pacific supply lines open. After 6 months of patrol and screening operations, Lamson saw action 22 October when, with Mahan, she attacked Japanese picket boats stationed between Gilbert and Ellice Islands. The two destroyers made a coordinated attack beating off enemy air raids and sank two enemy craft. On 30 November, Lamson joined Rear Admiral Wright‚Äôs Task Force 67 during the Battle of Tassafaronga. One Japanese destroyer was sunk and one damaged while the American force lost one cruiser and three damaged. Lamson returned to operate in the South Pacific for the next 8 months, screening convoys en route to Guadalcanal. Constantly at sea on patrol and ASW screen, the destroyer assisted other units as they paved the way for the Allied advance across the Pacific. Arriving Milne Bay 19 August 1943, Lamson joined Destroyer Squadron 5, the forerunner of the mighty 7th Fleet, to engage in the New Guinea operations. In the landings at Lae and Finschhafen during September, she joined in the preinvasion bombardment, gave fire support after the landings, and escorted to the island reinforcement convoys needed to spearhead the drive toward Japan. After 2 months of escort duty, Lamson joined three other destroyers 29 November and penetrated 160 miles into enemy territory to bombard Madang, the main Japanese naval base on New Guinea. On 15 December she engaged in preinvasion bombardment of Arawe, New Britain, and, during the landings at Cape Gloucester 11 days later, downed two ‚ÄúVals.‚Äù Continuing the New Guinea operation, the destroyer bombarded Saidor 2 January 1944. After a brief overhaul at Mare Island and training at Pearl Harbor, Lamson arrived at Eniwetok 8 August to join the 5th Fleet. For the next 2 months she engaged in patrol duty and ASW screen in the Marshall Islands before reassignment to the 7th Fleet. Departing Hollandia 25 October, Lamson steamed to the Philippines to serve as picket, patrol and screening ship for the massive Leyte assault. Throughout November the destroyer beat off numerous suicide plane attacks aimed at convoys bringing supplies to the Philippines. According to the ships action report; while screening a convoy off Ormoc Bay, Lamson downed two ‚ÄúDinahs‚Äù before a \\"Tony\\" made a fast low approach on the starboard quarter and struck the ships number two stack with its right wing and spun around crashing into the after port corner of the transmission room. Four men were killed and seventeen wounded.Rielly, Robin, \\"Kamikaze Attacks of World War II\\"; 2010, p. 143. She arrived at the Puget Sound Navy Yard 16 January 1945 for extensive repairs. Returning Eniwetok 10 May, Lamson operated for the rest of the war on patrol and air-sea rescue work off Iwo Jima. A fitting climax to Lamson's fine war record came on 3 September, when she arrived at Chichi Jima to supervise the surrender of the Bonin Islands. Following occupation duty at Sasebo, Japan for 1 month, the destroyer departed Japan 29 October for San Diego, arriving there 29 November.

Fate However, Lamson was still destined to play a valuable role in America‚Äôs progress as she arrived at Bikini Atoll later in May 1946 to participate in Operation Crossroads. The destroyer was sunk in Test Able, the atomic explosion 2 July 1946. Lamson received five battle stars for World War II service.

A video scaler is a system which converts video signals from one display resolution to another; typically, scalers are used to convert a signal from a lower resolution (such as 480p standard definition) to a higher resolution (such as 1080i high definition), a process known as \\"upconversion\\" or \\"upscaling\\" (by contrast, converting from high to low resolution is known as \\"downconversion\\" or \\"downscaling\\"). Video scalers are typically found inside consumer electronics devices such as televisions, video game consoles, and DVD or Blu-ray players, but can also be found in other AV equipment (such as video editing and television broadcasting equipment). Video scalers can also be a completely separate devices, often providing simple video switching capabilities. These units are commonly found as part of home theatre or projected presentation systems. They are often combined with other video processing devices or algorithms to create a video processor that improves the apparent definition of video signals. Video scalers are primarily a digital device; however, they can be combined with an analog-to-digital converter (ADC, or digitizer) and a digital-to-analog converter (DAC) to support analog inputs and outputs. Process This is a comparison of several common video resolutions. The more pixels in an image the greater the possibility for finer detail and fidelity. The \\"native resolution\\" of a display is how many physical pixels make up each row and column of the visible area on the display's output surface. There are many different video signals in use which are not the same resolution (neither are all of the displays), thus some form of resolution adaptation is required to properly frame a video signal to a display device. For example, within the United States, there are NTSC, ATSC, and VESA video standards each with several different resolution video formats. Multiple common resolutions are also used for high-definition television; 720p, 1080i, and 1080p. While scaling a video signal does allow it to match the size of a particular display, the process can result in an increased number of visual artifacts in the signal, such as ringing and posterization. Scaling by television channels Television channels which air a mixture of 16:9 (or high definition) programming and 4:3 (or standard definition) programming may employ scaling and/or cropping in order to make the programming fill the entire screen, as opposed to pillarboxing the feed instead, in order to maintain consistency in format. Likewise, broadcasters downscale programming produced in 16:9 for broadcast on their 4:3 feeds through letterboxing‚Äîeither as a full 16:9 letterbox, or a partial 14:9 letterbox‚Äîa technique used primarily by European broadcasters during the transition to digital terrestrial television. The Active Format Description standard is a system of variables defining various scaling, letterboxing, and pillarboxing states; broadcasting equipment and televisions can be configured to automatically switch to the appropriate state based on the AFD flag encoded in the content and the aspect ratio of the display. When the U.S. cable network TNT introduced an HD feed in 2004, it controversially employed a stretching system known as FlexView (which was also offered to other broadcasters). FlexView used a nonlinear method to stretch more near the edges of the screen than in the center of it. The practice was imposed by the senior vice president of broadcast engineering at TNT, Clyde D. Smith, who argued that pillarboxing led to inconsistency between programs for viewers, could cause burn-in on plasma televisions, some older HDTVs could not stretch 4:3 content automatically, and the quality of stretching on some displays was poor. Despite TNT's intentions, the system was frequently criticized by viewers of high definition channels, with some nicknaming the effect \\"Stretch-O-Vision\\". In 2014, FXX faced similar criticism for its use of cropping and scaling on reruns of The Simpsons (which only started producing episodes in HD beginning in its 20th season), as its cropping method caused various visual gags to be lost. In February 2015, FXX announced that in response to these complaints, it would present these episodes in their original 4:3 aspect ratio on its video-on-demand service. Since about 2008, some networks and cable companies have run high definition versions of old programing that was originally shot on film shown in the 4:3 format. This format always cropped the sides of the image. For example, syndicated broadcast stations and the cable network TBS air Seinfeld in HD. The series producer, Sony Pictures went to the 35mm film source, making new HD masters and cropping the top and bottom parts of the frame, while restoring the sides.

ABRO traced its history back to the foundation of the Corps of Armourers in 1858. History On 1 April 1993, the Army's static workshops in Great Britain, previously under the control of the Equipment Support Organisation, were reorganised as the Army Base Repair Organisation. It comprised the headquarters at Andover, a contract repair branch and a network of base and district workshops. It employed 3,581 civilian workers and 219 military staff. Apart from the HQ at Andover, there were other major units at Bovington, Old Dalby, Leics, Catterick, Colchester, Donnington, Stirling and Warminster. Smaller sites were located at Bicester, Edinburgh, Sennybridge and York. On 1 April 2002, the Army Base Repair Organisation was established as a trading fund under the name ABRO. Its services included: * Maintenance, repair and overhaul * Complex service and repair * Assembly, integration and test * Calibration * Diagnostics * Fleet management * Mobile support teams * Obsolescence management * Re-manufacture * Workshop management ABRO's annual turnover was typically in excess of ¬£147 million and each year carried out work on over 1,000 product lines of military and commercial vehicles and equipment, as well as over 55,000 ad hoc repair tasks.

He was a member of the U.S. House of Representatives from 1789 until 1791. He was also a U.S. Senator from Georgia from 1793 to 1795, and from 1801 until his death in 1806. In 1797 he was elected 23rd Governor of Georgia, serving from 1798 to 1801 before returning to the senate. Early life Jackson was born in Moretonhampstead, Devonshire, England. He immigrated at age 15 to Savannah, Georgia in 1772, and it was then that he became a ward of Savannah lawyer, John Wereat. As a young man, Jackson became well known as a duelist with a fiery temper. In 1785, he married Mary Charlotte Young, with whom he had five sons, four of whom later became prominent in the state's public affairs. Revolutionary War During the American Revolutionary War, he served in the 1st Brigade Georgia Militia at the defense of Savannah, the Battle of Cowpens, and the recapture of Augusta and Savannah. When the British left Savannah in July 1782, General Anthony Wayne gave Jackson the privilege of receiving the keys to the city. Even after the Revolutionary War, Jackson remained an important and influential figure in the Georgia Militia; he participated in the expansionist drive against the Creek Nation in Georgia. Jackson eventually thus rose to the rank of brigadier general of Georgia's militia in 1786 and major general in 1792. Political career After the war, he built up his law practice in Savannah. Jackson was elected to the first Georgia state legislature in 1777 after he had been clerk of court in the Provincial Congress. His interest in the military was rekindled when he joined the Georgia militia in the defense of Georgia frontier settlers against Indian inhabitants. In 1788, Jackson was elected governor of Georgia but declined the position, citing his inexperience. In 1789, Jackson was elected to the First United States Congress. Prior to his election, though, Jackson had to fight an uphill battle in one of Georgia's most contentious districts. The First District was the least populated district in the state, and the three-fifths ratio in counting slaves, the district was considered to have a population of over 16,000 individuals. The district in which Jackson ran for Congress was one of the most contested in the state. During the election, Jackson had to campaign against two popular people who had all served in Congress, William Houston and Henry Osborne. Jackson won the seat for the first district by a narrow margin, and the result was unsuccessfully challenged by Osborne. As a Jeffersonian Republican, he vigorously opposed Secretary of the Treasury Alexander Hamilton's financial plans for federal assumption of the states' debts from the Revolutionary War. Jackson opposed many of Hamilton‚Äôs plans on how to relieve the states of their debts from the Revolutionary War. One of the first plans that Hamilton proposed was that of placing a tax on spirits. The proposition received a resounding rebuttal from Jackson who said that it would \\"deprive the mass of the people of almost the only luxury they enjoy, that of distilled spirits.\\" It was originally suggested that the tax would be $0.15 per gallon tax, but Jackson countered that with a $0.12 per gallon tax. Jackson‚Äôs suggestion was denied so the bill was passed with the $0.15 per gallon tax on distilled spirits. The next bill that Jackson and Hamilton fought over was the assumption of states‚Äô debts from the war. Hamilton wanted to lump all of the states' debts from the Revolutionary War into one national debt in which the states all worked together to pay off the debt. Jackson strongly believed that states like Georgia that accumulated little debt during the war should not have to work to pay off other states' debts by paying more taxes. He was also strongly opposed to efforts to curtail slavery. While serving as a member of the House of Representatives, Jackson was a very active member; he served on over 20 committees and reported on many more. It was during his first term that Jackson became known for his fiery temper and personality; there was a point when he became so impassioned over the topic at hand that the senators who were meeting above the House chambers had to close the windows so as to muffle Jackson's voice. Defeated for re-election in 1791 by his former Revolutionary commander, Anthony Wayne (for whom Wayne County is named), in a campaign rife with charges of irregularities on the part of Wayne's supporters, Jackson contested the outcome. He was convinced that Wayne had not won his seat fairly so he mounted a campaign against Wayne and his supporters, and finally succeeded in removing Wayne from Congress. Making effective use of grand jury presentments and newspapers, Jackson secured a seat in the legislature and subsequently oversaw the ouster of Wayne's campaign manager from his state judgeship. Jackson then took his struggle for vindication to Congress, where he convinced the House that Wayne had not won fairly. He failed to regain his seat after the tie-breaking vote of the Federalist Speaker. Meanwhile, the state of Georgia sold millions of acres of its western lands, called the Yazoo region, at extremely low prices to a group of investors. Jackson, believing that the sale was influenced by bribery of state legislatures, resigned his post in the Senate to run for a seat in the Georgia legislature in 1795. He won the election and began to lead a campaign to repeal the Yazoo land sale. In 1798, he won the election for governor of Georgia and proceeded to implement the legislation repealing the Yazoo land sale. Jackson placed blame for the Yazoo land fraud on his political enemies, including James Gunn and the Federalists. He built the Georgia Democratic- Republican party and led it to statewide dominance. Jackson was re-elected to the Senate in 1801 and served until his death in 1806. Legacy He is buried in the Congressional Cemetery, a National Historic Landmark in Washington, DC. Jackson was the patriarch of a political dynasty in Georgia. His son, Jabez Young Jackson, was a representative from Georgia in the Twenty-fourth and Twenty-fifth United States Congress. His grandson, also named James Jackson, was a U.S. Representative from Georgia, a judge advocate on the staff of General Thomas \\"Stonewall\\" Jackson and a trustee of the University of Georgia. Jackson is the namesake of Jackson County, Georgia,Jackson, Georgia, James Jackson Parkway Northwest in Atlanta. Fort James Jackson, which protected the city of Savannah from attack by sea during most of the nineteenth century, is today a museum and restored garrison. The ghost town of Jacksonboro, Georgia is also named for Jackson.

He attended Barlows Lane primary school and Liverpool Institute High School, now the Paul McCartney-sponsored Liverpool Institute of Performing Arts. Career Buchanan was in a heavy metal band called Marseille which formed in 1976: they were part of the new wave of British heavy metal scene, releasing four albums and six singles, touring America and performing with Judas Priest, Nazareth and Whitesnake. The band reformed in 2009 with a performance at The Cavern Club, Liverpool. =Television= Buchanan made his television debut on a Saturday morning show called No. 73, later renamed 7T3. He had attended the original audition, having met the No. 73 producers when his band Marseille appeared on Southern Television's Saturday Banana. He did not become a regular until the third series of No. 73 shown in 1983. After production ceased on 7T3 in 1988, he went on to present Motormouth, another Saturday morning children's programme made by TVS alongside Gaby Roslin. Buchanan stayed with Motormouth until the show's cancellation in 1992. He presented the CITV show Art Attack from its inception in 1990 until the show ended in 2007. The show won two BAFTA awards. In March 2000, Britt Allcroft (subsequently Gullane Entertainment) purchased the rights to the series from Buchanan in a ¬£14 million transaction. In 1991, he hosted the British version of Finders Keepers, a room-raiding game show for TVS, then Scottish Television when TVS lost their licence to broadcast. He co-hosted the show with Diane Youdale, the former Gladiators star, in its final series in 1996. He also presented Animal Crazy with co-host Jenny Powell for two series between 1994 and 1995 which was produced by the Media Merchants for Granada Television, and It's a Mystery alongside Sophie Aldred, from 1996 to 1999.

Among the popular songs Livingston helped write are \\"It's the Talk of the Town\\", \\"Under a Blanket of Blue\\", \\"Blue and Sentimental\\", \\"Close to You\\", \\"Mairzy Doats\\", \\"Wake the Town and Tell the People\\", \\"The Twelfth of Never\\", and \\"Young Emotions\\". From the 1940s to the 1960s he wrote songs for numerous films and television series, including Cinderella (1950), Bronco (1958), 77 Sunset Strip (television series, 1958), Hawaiian Eye (television series, 1959), Bourbon Street Beat (television series, 1959), Surfside 6 (television series, 1960), and the song \\"This is It\\" (for the 1960s The Bugs Bunny Show). He worked on Tin Pan Alley and co-wrote with Mack David the theme song to Casper the Friendly Ghost, and co-wrote The Unbirthday Song for Alice in Wonderland and Trick or Treat For Halloween for Trick or Treat with David and Al Hoffman. Livingston's Broadway compositions included the musical Molly and the musical revue Bright Lights of 1944, both with Mack David. With Mack David, he was nominated three times for the Academy Awards, the first time in 1951 for the song \\"Bibbidi-Bobbidi-Boo\\" from Cinderella (1950) with Al Hoffman, again in 1960 for the song \\"The Hanging Tree\\" from the film of the same name (1959), and the last time for \\"The Ballad of Cat Ballou\\" (from the 1965 film Cat Ballou) in 1966. In 1965, he and his wife, Ruth, were shot by their son, Gary, for \\"bugging him about getting out of bed at 1 PM,\\" after his attempted suicide the previous night. He died of a heart condition at his home in Beverly Hills, California, at the age of 78.

Certain types of implied warranties must be specifically disclaimed, such as the implied warranty of title. \\"As is\\" denotes that the seller is selling, and the buyer is buying an item in whatever condition it presently exists, and that the buyer is accepting the item \\"with all faults\\", whether or not immediately apparent. This is the classic \\"buyer beware\\" situation, where the careful buyer should take the time to examine the item before accepting it, or obtain expert advice. On the other hand, the phrase \\"as is\\" does not disclaim ‚Äò‚Äôexpress‚Äô‚Äô warranties: these may, for example, be created by the seller's description of an item. In other words, though the item may be sold \\"as is\\", nevertheless, if it for example does not conform to the seller's description of it, the buyer may void the sale. For example, a seller of a used automobile sells it to a buyer, and puts into the contract of sale the statement: \\"The buyer accepts the automobile AS IS, WITH ALL FAULTS.\\" Two minutes after the buyer drives off with it, the car stalls, and the engine seizes. Unless the buyer can show that there was some fraud involved, or the seller breached an express warranty, the buyer is not entitled to a refund. This would be a specific example where fraud in the inducement could outweigh anything in the contract, express or implied: it simply does not matter what disclaimer or limitations may be found in the contract, if the contract is void (or voidable) for any reason. Disgruntled buyers of real estate, and their respective improvements, may be faced with other complicated property law issues if a deed is conveyed as a result of a contract with an \\"as is\\" clause. In real estate, these are the larger potential problems than issues with the structure itself, which can be drawn out with an inspector. Searching public records is often difficult, and often done lazily by the seller; this means that the buyer may be burdened with liens on the home, and face various fees related to things such as public utilities. In many jurisdictions disclaimer of various implied warranties is void. For instance, the United Kingdom's laws on consumer protection, and unfair contract terms may limit the ability of a manufacturer or seller to limit or exclude liability for various types of damage. See, for instance, the Unfair Terms in Consumer Contracts Regulations 1999 and Sale of Goods Act 1979. However, in the United States' Uniform Commercial Code, \\"as is\\" is quoted as an example of the type of language capable of excluding all implied warranties through which the law might otherwise protect a buyer.Uniform Commercial Code, ¬ß 2-316.

The most important conduits in the postwar period are the economic ministries: the Ministry of Finance and the Ministry of Economy, Trade and Industry (METI, formerly the Ministry of International Trade and Industry, known as MITI). The Ministry of Finance has operational responsibilities for all fiscal affairs, including the preparation of the national budget. It initiates fiscal policies and, through its indirect control over the Bank of Japan, the central bank, is responsible for monetary policy as well. The Ministry of Finance allocates public investment, formulates tax policies, collectes taxes, and regulates foreign exchange. The Ministries *The Ministry of Finance establishes low interest rates and, by thus reducing the cost of investment funds to corporations, promotes industrial expansion. *METI is responsible for the regulation of production and the distribution of goods and services. It is the \\"steward\\" of the Japanese economy, developing plans concerning the structure of Japanese industry. The former MITI had several special functions: controlling Japan's foreign trade and supervising international commerce; ensuring the smooth flow of goods in the national economy; promoting the development of manufacturing, mining, and distribution industries; and supervising the procurement of a reliable supply of raw materials and energy resources. *The Ministry of Land, Infrastructure and Transport is responsible for oversight of all land, sea, and air transport. It is charged with supervising all construction in Japan and Japanese-supported construction abroad. Its responsibilities also include land acquisition for public use and environmental protection as it relates to construction. *The Ministry of Health, Labour and Welfare is responsible for supervising and coordinating all health and welfare services. *The former Ministry of Posts and Telecommunications was responsible for the postal service and electronic communications, functions now filled by Japan Post and Nippon Telegraph and Telephone and their private competitors. Japanese market economy model Japan's market economy model shapes the relationship between government and business. There is debate among scholars on how to classify Japan's market economy and welfare state model. Some argue that the focuses of Japan's government, businesses, and laborers are solely oriented towards increasing economic productivity. This is considered the productivist or developmental welfare capitalism model. Institutional features in Japan pointing towards this model include the cooperation between MITI and businesses in directing the Japanese economy towards high productivity goals. Labor subordination is another aspect of this model that allows the Japanese government to focus solely on economic development rather than the development of social programs. The other market economy and welfare state model that Japan is argued to fit under is the hybrid model. The hybrid model is a combination of liberal and cooperative welfare states. Similar to other liberal market economies such as the United States, Japan has very low levels of welfare spending. However, unlike in other liberal economies, the Japanese government plays a direct role in coordinating the actions of Japanese businesses through the use of bureaucracy. MITI is responsible for drafting large-scope economic plans that include picking the next winning and losing industry sectors that the Japanese government should invest in or support. This aspect of Japan's market economy is similar to the cooperation between businesses and government. Another aspect of the Japanese market economy that follows the cooperative model is the role of family values. Japanese values of meritocracy and hard work mirror the labor conditions in the Japanese economy. However, unlike cooperative market economies that draw their values from Christian thought, Japanese market values derive themselves from Confucianism. These parallel distinctions between liberal and cooperative market economies are why scholars argue that Japan fits a hybrid market economy model. Attitudes toward government direction Japanese attitudes towards government have historically been shaped by Confucianism. Japan often has been defined as a Confucian country, but one in which loyalty is more important than benevolence. Leadership stemmed from the government and authority in general, and business looked to government for guidance. These attitudes, coupled with the view of the nation as a family, allowed government to influence business, and businesses worked hard not only for their own profits but also for national well-being. There was a national consensus that Japan must be an economic power and that the duty of all Japanese was to sacrifice themselves for this national goal. Thus, the relationship between government and business was as collaborators rather than as mutually suspicious adversaries. Corporate organizations Links between the corporate world and government in Japan were maintained through three national organizations: the Federation of Economic Organizations (Keizai Dantai Rengokai‚ÄîKeidanren), established in 1946; the Japan Association of Corporate Executives (Keizai D≈çyukai), established in 1946; and the Japan Federation of Employers Association (Nihon Keieishadantai Renmei‚ÄîNikkeiren), established in 1948. Keidanren is considered the most important. Its membership includes 750 of the largest corporations and 110 manufacturers' associations. Its Tokyo headquarters serves as a kind of \\"nerve center\\" for the country's most important enterprises, and it works closely with the powerful Ministry of International Trade and Industry (MITI). There is evidence, however, suggesting that the federation's power is not what it had been, partly because major corporations, which had amassed huge amounts of money by the late 1980s, are increasingly capable of operating without its assistance. Nikkeiren was concerned largely with labor-management relations and with organizing a united business front to negotiate with labor unions on wage demands during the annual \\"Spring Struggle\\". The Keizai D≈çyukai, composed of younger and more liberal business leaders, assigned itself the role of promoting business's social responsibilities. Whereas Keidanren and Nikkeiren were \\"peak organizations\\", whose members themselves were associations, members of the Keizai D≈çyukai were individual business leaders (see Labor unions in Japan). Because of financial support from corporations, business interest groups were generally more independent of political parties than other groups. Both Keidanren and the Keizai D≈çyukai, for example, indicated a willingness to talk with the Japan Socialist Party in the wake of the political scandals of 1988-89 and also suggested that the LDP might form a coalition government with an opposition party. Yet through an organization called the People's Politics Association (Kokumin Seiji Kyokai), they and other top business groups provided the Liberal Democratic Party (LDP) with its largest source of party funding. Small business Japan's streets are lined with small shops, grocery stores, restaurants, and coffeehouses. Although supermarkets and large discount department stores are more common than in the 1980s, the political muscle of small business associations was reflected in the success with which they blocked the nationalization of the country's distribution system. The Large-Scale Retail Store Law of 1973, amended in 1978, made it very difficult in the late 1980s for either Japanese or foreign retailers to establish large, economically efficient outlets in local communities. Many light industrial goods, such as toys, footwear, pencils, and kitchen utensils, were still manufactured by small local companies rather than imported from the Republic of Korea, Taiwan, or Hong Kong. Traditional handicrafts, such as pottery, silk weaving, and lacquerware, produced using centuries-old methods in small workshops, flourished in every part of the country. Apart from protectionism of the \\"non-tariff barrier\\" variety, the government ensured the economic viability of small enterprises through lenient tax policies and access to credit on especially favorable terms. Major associations representing small and medium-sized enterprises included the generally pro-LDP Japan Chamber of Commerce and Industry (Nihon Shoko Kaigisho, or Nissho for short), which was established in 1922 but whose origins are traced to the establishment of the Tokyo Chamber of Commerce and Industry in 1878, the National Central Association of Medium and Small Enterprise Associations, the Japan League of Medium and Small Enterprise Organizations, and the Japanese Communist Party- sponsored Democratic Merchants and Manufacturers Association. Although small enterprises in services and manufacturing preserved cultural traditions and enlivened urban areas, a major motivation for government nurturing of small business was social welfare. In Calder's words, \\"Much of small business, particularly in the distribution sector, serves as a labor reservoir. Its inefficiencies help absorb surplus workers who would be unemployed if distribution, services, and traditional manufacturing were uniformly as efficient as the highly competitive and modernized export sectors. Lately, however, government relations agencies such as GR Japan and ShinNihon Public Affairs have started to appear also in Japan, run by former diplomats, members of parliament, and civil servants.

Santos Montano briefly joined Zozobra in its early years and also performed with Stephen Brodsky's (Cave In, Converge) new band New Idea Society for a while. =Return, No, The Ape of God and The Ape of God (2012‚Äì2017)= Old Man Gloom abruptly ended an eight-year period of silence by announcing that they would resume touring and release a new album titled No in 2012. The announcement gave little notice that a new album would be coming out and the album itself received minimal promotion. The announcement was made on May 1, 2012 on the band's official Facebook page that No would receive a wide release on June 26 through Hydra Head Records, or fans could pick up a copy of the album at Old Man Gloom's upcoming tour dates, beginning the following day on May 2, 2012. The band and label tried to keep the new album quiet before the announcement, but in 2011, an Easter egg in a magazine advertisement hinted at a new Old Man Gloom being released in 2012, and producer Kurt Ballou tweeted about work on the new album, but later retracted his statement by claiming it was a late April Fools' Day joke. In late 2014, Old Man Gloom announced the release of a follow-up to No titled The Ape of God for November 11, 2014 through Profound Lore Records and also the release of an unofficial documentary directed by Kenneth Thomas about the band's history leading up to (but not including) The Ape of God titled Here is a Gift for You. The band promoted the album with online streams of \\"Predators\\" and \\"The Lash\\" prior to the official release date. For several months, The Ape of God was marketed and promoted as a single album, but the weekend before the official release date, Old Man Gloom announced that they were actually releasing two different studio albums both with the name The Ape of God, and that the version of the album sent to the press to review (which also subsequently leaked online) was a \\"fake\\" album that featured songs from both albums in a different sequence and edited down to shorter versions. One album, The Ape of God (PFL145) features eight songs in a similar composition to other Old Man Gloom albums, and the other album The Ape of God (PFL145.5) features four songs that are longer and more atmospheric than other Old Man Gloom songs ‚Äî similar to the band's 2001 albums Seminar II and Seminar III. A remastered version of Meditations in B was released on April 7, 2015 on Hydra Head Records. The band's first live album (recorded in London at April 3, 2014) was released in early 2016 through Ektro Records. =Death of Caleb Scofield (2018)= On March 28, 2018, Scofield died at the age of 39 in a car accident in New Hampshire, after his car hit a concrete barrier at a high speed. Montano, Turner and Newton agreed to keep performing as Old Man Gloom to honor Scofield following his death. In a Facebook statement, Montano said: > In a quiet moment, in a very loud room filled with more people than I could > count, Aaron and I were sitting across from one another, totally drained, > zombiefied, just looking at each other. He leaned towards me, and I leaned > towards him. He quietly said 'Santos, do you still want to do Old Man > Gloom?' My stomach dropped, and I responded 'we have to now. We don't have a > choice.' We spoke to Nate and he agreed. I don't know what it means, or how > it will manifest itself, but we will continue and do our best to honor > Caleb, and that means we must exist. I share this very private moment > because I truly feel after this week you are all a part of our story so much > more than I ever realized. Thank you for showing us that. We love you all. The band enlisted long-time friend and Scofield's Cave In bandmate Stephen Brodsky to perform with them at the late bass player's tribute show on June 13, 2018 in Boston, MA. Prior to Scofield's death, Old Man Gloom planned to record a new album in 2018. Unbeknownst to Scofield and Newton, Montano and Turner also had secret plans to record a second new album as a duo (a \\"sequel\\" to Meditations in B) and release it on the same day. About the secret plans, Mantano said: \\"Yes, we were going to troll ourselves this time. I mean, half of ourselves. We figured it was the only place left to go, to fully shit on our own bandmates AND the general public with more gloom.\\" In December 2018, Old Man Gloom began working on a new studio album with Brodsky, who was also reported as becoming an official member of the band.

This observable constraint is due to various properties of general relativity, the expanding universe, and the physics of Big Bang cosmology. Cosmological horizons set the size and scale of the observable universe. This article explains a number of these horizons. Particle horizon The particle horizon (also called the cosmological horizon, the comoving horizon, or the cosmic light horizon) is the maximum distance from which light from particles could have traveled to the observer in the age of the universe. It represents the boundary between the observable and the unobservable regions of the universe, so its distance at the present epoch defines the size of the observable universe. Due to the expansion of the universe it is not simply the age of the universe times the speed of light, as in the Hubble horizon, but rather the speed of light multiplied by the conformal time. The existence, properties, and significance of a cosmological horizon depend on the particular cosmological model. In terms of comoving distance, the particle horizon is equal to the conformal time that has passed since the Big Bang, times the speed of light. In general, the conformal time at a certain time is given in terms of the scale factor a by, :eta(t) = int_{0}^{t} frac{dt'}{a(t')} or :eta(a) = int_{0}^{a} frac{1}{a' H(a')} frac{da'}{a'}. The particle horizon is the boundary between two regions at a point at a given time: one region defined by events that have already been observed by an observer, and the other by events which cannot be observed at that time. It represents the furthest distance from which we can retrieve information from the past, and so defines the observable universe. Hubble horizon Hubble radius, Hubble sphere, Hubble volume, or Hubble horizon is a conceptual horizon defining the boundary between particles that are moving slower and faster than the speed of light relative to an observer at one given time. Note that this does not mean the particle is unobservable, the light from the past is reaching and will continue to reach the observer for a while. Also, more importantly, in the current expansion models light emitted from the Hubble radius will reach us in a finite amount of time. It is a common misconception that light from the Hubble radius can never reach us. In models assuming decreasing H with time (some cases of Friedmann universe), while particles on the Hubble radius recede from us with the speed of light, the Hubble radius gets larger over time, so light emitted towards us from a particle on the Hubble radius will be inside the Hubble radius some time later. In such models, only light emitted from the cosmic event horizon or further will never reach us in a finite amount of time. The Hubble velocity of an object is given by Hubble's law, :v=x H. Replacing v with speed of light c and solving for proper distance x we obtain the radius of Hubble sphere as :r_{text{HS}}(t)=frac{c}{H(t)}. In an ever-accelerating universe, if two particles are separated by a distance greater than the Hubble radius, they cannot talk to each other from now on (as they are now, not as they have been in the past), However, if they are outside of each other's particle horizon, they could have never communicated. Depending on the form of expansion of the universe, they may be able to exchange information in the future. Today, :r_{text{HS}}(t_0) = frac{c}{H_0}, yielding a Hubble horizon of some 4.1 gigaparsecs. This horizon is not really a physical size, but it is often used as useful length scale as most physical sizes in cosmology can be written in terms of those factors. One can also define a comoving Hubble horizon by simply dividing the Hubble radius by the scale factor :r_{text{HS}, mathrm{comoving}}(t)=frac{c}{a(t) H(t)}. Event horizon The particle horizon differs from the cosmic event horizon, in that the particle horizon represents the largest comoving distance from which light could have reached the observer by a specific time, while the event horizon is the largest comoving distance from which light emitted now can ever reach the observer in the future.Lars Bergstr√∂m and Ariel Goobar: \\"Cosmology and Particle Physics\\", WILEY (1999), page 65. The current distance to our cosmic event horizon is about , well within our observable range given by the particle horizon. In general, the proper distance to the event horizon at time t is given by :d_e(t) = a(t) int_{t}^{t_{max}} frac{cdt'}{a(t')} where t_{max} is the time-coordinate of the end of the universe, which would be infinite in the case of a universe that expands forever. For our case, assuming that dark energy is due to a cosmological constant, d_e(t_0) < infin. Future horizon In an accelerating universe, there are events which will be unobservable as t rightarrow infin as signals from future events become redshifted to arbitrarily long wavelengths in the exponentially expanding de Sitter space. This sets a limit on the farthest distance that we can possibly see as measured in units of proper distance today. Or, more precisely, there are events that are spatially separated for a certain frame of reference happening simultaneously with the event occurring right now for which no signal will ever reach us, even though we can observe events that occurred at the same location in space that happened in the distant past. While we will continue to receive signals from this location in space, even if we wait an infinite amount of time, a signal that left from that location today will never reach us. Additionally, the signals coming from that location will have less and less energy and be less and less frequent until the location, for all practical purposes, becomes unobservable. In a universe that is dominated by dark energy which is undergoing an exponential expansion of the scale factor, all objects that are gravitationally unbound with respect to the Milky Way will become unobservable, in a futuristic version of Kapteyn's universe. Practical horizons While not technically \\"horizons\\" in the sense of an impossibility for observations due to relativity or cosmological solutions, there are practical horizons which include the optical horizon, set at the surface of last scattering. This is the farthest distance that any photon can freely stream. Similarly, there is a \\"neutrino horizon\\" set for the farthest distance a neutrino can freely stream and a gravitational wave horizon at the farthest distance that gravitational waves can freely stream. The latter is predicted to be a direct probe of the end of cosmic inflation.

BTR-D stands for Bronetransportyor Desanta (–ë–¢–†-–î, –ë—Ä–æ–Ω–µ—Ç—Ä–∞–Ω—Å–ø–æ—Ä—Ç–µ—Ä –î–µ—Å–∞–Ω—Ç–∞, literally \\"armoured transporter of the Airborne\\").‚Ä† It is based on the BMD-1 airborne IFV. NATO gave it the designation BMD M1979. Development history In 1969, the BMD-1 airborne IFV entered service with the Soviet Army. The vehicle had many flaws(citation needed), but the biggest one was that the troop compartment was extremely cramped and could only transport up to four infantrymen; this number was often reduced to three because it was impractical for four infantrymen to operate inside the troop compartment and dismount from the vehicle. Because of that, in the beginning of the 1970s, the Volgograd Tractor Factory design bureau, who designed the BMD-1, began designing a new airborne APC based on the BMD-1. The prototype was completed in 1974 and at the same year it entered production and service with the Soviet Army as the BTR-D. Description =Overview= While the BTR-D is based on the BMD-1, it is 60 mm longer and lacks a turret; instead, it has a small flat superstructure with a hatch on top. =Crew= The crew consists of the driver, the commander and the left bow mounted machine gun gunner, all of whom are in the same positions and have the same equipment as in the BMD-1. =Armament= Although the turret with all of the main armament was removed, the two bow mounted machine guns have been retained. However, the original PKT tank machine guns have been replaced by PKB general purpose machine guns. The vehicle can also be fitted with pintle-mounted automatic grenade launchers (AGS-17, AGS-30 or AGS-57) and/or machine guns (PKM, 6P41, \\"Utyos\\" or \\"Kord\\"). =Maneuverability= The BTR-D is powered by the same engine as the BMD-1, however, its suspension is longer because the entire vehicle has been lengthened by 60 mm. Because of this, the vehicle has six roadwheels on each side instead of five. It also has five return rollers on each side unlike the BMD-1, which has four. =Amphibious ability= =Armour protection= The armour protection is slightly better on the BTR-D than on the BMD-1. That's because the upper front armour has a dual slanted angle. =Troop compartment= Because the turret has been removed, the troop compartment has been enlarged and can carry up to ten fully equipped soldiers. It's also linked with the crew compartment in the front. Also, there are two firing ports in the sides and one in the rear, two of which are for RPK-74 light machine guns. =Equipment= The BTR-D has all the same equipment as the BMD-1, but also has towing equipment for ZU-23-2 twin AA autocannon. =Air-drop techniques= Service history The BTR-D entered service with the Soviet Army in 1974 and was used by Soviet airborne troops during the Soviet‚ÄìAfghan War, where it was seen for the first time by the West in 1979. As of now, the BTR-D and vehicles based on it are used by the following units of Russian Army or are stationed in following bases: *76th Guards Air Assault Division from Pskov, which is part of Western Military District (90 BTR vehicles, 30 BTR-RD and 49 BTR-ZD as of 2000), the subunits of this division include : 104th airborne regiment from Pskov (34 BTR-D, 6 BTR-RD , 13 BTR-ZD and 6 BMD-1KSh) :234th airborne regiment from Pskov (32 BTR-D, 6 BTR-RD , 12 BTR-ZD and 5 BMD-1KSh) :1140th artillery regiment from Pskov (14 BTR-RD , 3 BTR-ZD , 1 BMD-1KSh and 18 2S9 Anona) :165th independent air defense division from Pskov (4 BTR-ZD and 1 BMD-1KSh) :656th independent engineer battalion from Pskov (8 BTR-D and 1 BMD-1KSh) :728th independent communications battalion from Pskov (2 BTR-D, 6 BMD-1KSh, 3 BMD-1R and 2 R-440-ODB ) :7th independent repair battalion from Pskov (2 BTR-D).warfare.ru VDV *98th Guards Airborne Division from Ivanovo (92 BTR vehicles, 27 BTR-RD and 38 BTR-ZD as of 2000), the subunits of this division include :217th airborne regiment from Ivanovo (32 BTR-D, 6 BTR-RD , 11 BTR-ZD , 7 BMD-1KSh and 1 BMD-1R) :331st airborne regiment from Kostroma (33 BTR-D, 6 BTR-RD , 15 BTR-ZD , 5 BMD-1KSh and 1 BMD-1R) :1065th artillery regiment from Kostroma (15 BTR-RD , 3 BTR-ZD and 2 BMD-1KSh) :318th independent air defense division from Ivanovo (4 BTR-D, 8 BTR-ZD and 1 BMD-1KSh) :661st independent engineer battalion from Ivanovo (7 BTR-D and 1 BMD-1KSh) :674th independent communications battalion from Pskov (2 BTR-D, 6 BMD-1KSh, 4 BMD-1R and 3 R-440-ODB ) :15th independent repair battalion from Pskov (7 BTR-D). *106th Guards Airborne Division from Tula which is a part of the Western Military District (132 BTR vehicles, 33 BTR-RD and 49 BTR-ZD as of 2000), the subunits of this division include :51st airborne regiment from Tula (32 BTR-D, 6 BTR-RD , 13 BTR-ZD , 2 BMD-1KSh and 1 BMD-1R) :137th airborne regiment from Ryazan (38 BTR-D, 6 BTR-RD , 13 BTR-ZD , 7 BMD-1KSh and 1 BMD-1R) :1182nd artillery regiment from Yefremov (4 BTR-D, 3 BTR-ZD , 2 BMD-1KSh and 18 2S9 Anona) :107th independent air defense division from Donskoy (18 BTR-D, 6 BTR-ZD and 1 BMD-1KSh) :332nd independent engineer battalion from Tula (8 BTR-D and 1 BMD-1KSh) :731st independent communications battalion from Tula (2 BTR-D, 6 BMD-1KSh, 5 BMD-1R and 2 R-440-ODB ) :15th independent repair battalion from Tula (4 BTR-D and 1 BREM-D). *7th Guards Mountain Air Assault Division from Novorossyysk, Southern Military District (121 BTR vehicles, 27 BTR-RD, 38 BTR-ZD and 55 2S9 Anona as of 2000), the subunits of this division include :108th airborne regiment from Novorossyysk (35 BTR-D, 9 BTR-RD , 13 BTR-ZD , 7 BMD-1KSh and 19 2S9 Anona) :247th CDO regiment from Stavropol' (26 BTR-D, 9 BTR-RD and 13 BTR-ZD ) :1141st artillery regiment from Anapa (5 BTR-D and 9 BTR-ZD ) :30th independent air defense division from Novorossyysk (4 BTR-D and 8 BTR-ZD ) :629th independent engineer battalion from Starotitarovskaya (8 BTR-D) :743rd independent communications battalion from Novorossyysk (2 BTR-D, 8 BMD-1KSh and 3 R-440-ODB ) :6th independent repair battalion from Novorossyysk (4 BTR-D and 1 BREM-D). *31st independent airborne brigade from Ul'yanovsk which is a part of the Central Military District (57 BTR-D, 24 BTR-RD, 19 BTR-ZD, 8 BMD-1KSh and 2 BMD-1R as of 2000). *45th independent Spetznaz regiment from Kubinka, Moscow (1 BTR-D). *Ryazan airborne troops institute (6 BTR-D, 5 BTR-RD, 2 BTR-ZD and 2 BMD-1KSh).

Population Geography The village lies at the confluence of the rivers Sagne and C√©l√©, at the foot of the Rochecourbe cliffs. The village also forms part of the pilgrimage route for those travelling to Santiago de Compostella and is the final stop before Cahors. History The overhanging cliffs that dominate the town are home to a ruined castle, built by the English and also known as the ch√¢teau du diable (\\"devil's castle\\"). The castle was first mentioned in a document dating from 1259, and was the medieval home of the lords of Barsac. In 1380, during the Hundred Years' War, it fell into the hands of a force from Aquitaine controlled by the English. It was liberated ten years later by Jean d'H√©brard, lord of Saint-Sulpice, who subsequently ordered its demolition. The nearby Pech Merle cave is home to prehistoric cave paintings, being one of the few prehistoric sites in France which remain open to the general public. The Ch√¢teau de Cabrerets has been listed since 1996 as a monument historique by the French Ministry of Culture.

Map showing location of the Hoge Kempen National Park, at the southeastern extremity of the Campine. The natural regions of Belgium. Campine continues into the Netherlands, not shown here. The Campine (French) or De Kempen (Dutch) is a natural region situated chiefly in north-eastern Belgium and parts of the south-eastern Netherlands which once consisted mainly of extensive moors, tracts of sandy heath, and wetlands. It encompasses a large northern and eastern portion of Antwerp province and adjacent parts of Limburg in Belgium, as well as portions of the Dutch province of North Brabant (area southwest of Eindhoven) and Dutch Limburg around Weert. Today the Campine is becoming a popular touristic destination. Old farms have been transformed into bed-and-breakfast hotels, the restaurant and caf√© business is very active, and an extensive cycle touring network has come into existence over the past few years. Part of the Campine is protected as the Hoge Kempen Nationaal Park (High Campine National Park). It is located in the east of the Belgian province of Limburg, between Genk and the Meuse valley and was opened in March 2006. Covering almost , it forms part of the Natura 2000 network. The area is mostly heathland and pine forest. In May 2011 it was placed on UNESCO's Tentative List for consideration as a World Heritage Site. Etymology The Medieval Latin name Campania, firstly attested in the mid-11th century by a monk of Saint-Trond named Stepelinus, stems from the root kamp- ('field') attached to the suffix -injo, denoting the uncultivated or the virgin fields. The inhabitants of the Campine region are known as Kempenaars. Culture The region, described as a desolate flat land often appears in the books of the prominent Flemish writer Hendrik Conscience (1812‚Äì1883), who spent much of his childhood there. Another author who has written many novels playing in the Campine was Georges Eekhoud (1854‚Äì1927). In 1837 Victor Hugo made a journey through Belgium and visited the Campine and the towns of Lier and Turnhout, and wrote about his journey.Camby, J. (1935) Victor Hugo en Belgique. Paris: L'Ecran du Monde During the interbellum Felix Timmermans, Stijn Streuvels, Jozef Simons and the poet Jozef De Voght wrote about the Belgian Campine. The painters Jakob Smits (1855‚Äì1928) and Frans Van Giel (1892‚Äì1975) painted many Campine landscapes. The region is rich in folk tales, such as the stories about the Buckriders (Dutch: Bokkenrijders) and those concerning the gnome king Kyri√´ (Dutch: Kabouterkoning Kyri√´). The Museum Kempenland in Eindhoven has a considerable and historically important art collection of painters, draughtsmen, sculptors, blacksmiths and other craftsmen from this region. Much of the architectural, agrarian and historical and cultural heritage of the Campine can be visited in the open-air museum of Bokrijk. The old way of living and the Campine dialects have been the topic of scientific research.Bont, Antonius Petrus de (1958) Dialekt van Kempenland 3 Deel [in ?5 vols.] Assen: van Gorcum, 1958-60. 1962, 1985 In the Roman era the name of the region was Toxandria or Taxandria. History The Campine is an area in the Belgian provinces Antwerp, Limburg and the extreme north of the province Flemish Brabant, and in the south of the Dutch province Noord- Brabant. It stretches from the east of the city of Antwerp and towards the west of Eindhoven. Farther east the Campine is in the Groote Peel, a region which is geographically related to the Campine. The south border is formed by the river Demer, and the east border by the valley of the river Meuse. The Campine plateau is part of the Campine region. The Campine Basin, which extends from Belgium into the Netherlands, is formed by the Devonian and Carboniferous sedimentary rocks on the northern flank of the Brabant Massif. Since it was a region with a poor sandy soil, there are only a few old or large cities in the region. Most of those cities are located at the outer rim of the region, such as Hasselt, Diest, Aarschot, Lier (the self-styled gate of the Campine, a title also claimed by the Northern-Brabant Oirschot), Breda, Tilburg, Eindhoven, Maaseik, and Maastricht. Turnhout is an exception. West of Turnhout clay was used for the production of barge, which is one of the reasons why the Noord-Kempens Canal was dug to Antwerp. Also the more central Herentals was an historical industrial center, thanks to its textile industry of which the Lakenhal on the main market place is a remaining monument. The printing industry in Turnhout is historically important, with companies such as Brepols and more recently Cartamundi. The region was sparsely populated, and therefore chosen by monks who were looking for silence, such as those of the abbeys of Achel, Brecht, Zundert, Postel, Westmalle and Tongerlo. In the 19th and 20th centuries, industry established itself in the region, such as the metallurgy in Balen-Overpelt-Lommel. In 1872 the Sabli√®res et Carri√®res R√©unies (SCR), now Sibelco, was founded to extract the silica sand layers in Mol for industrial applications (glass). In 1891, the Koninklijke Philips Electronics N.V. was founded in Eindhoven (Noord-Brabant). In the 20th century, the first nuclear installation in Belgium, the SCK‚Ä¢CEN, was built in Mol in 1962. The European Institute for Reference Materials and Measurements (IRMM) was founded in Geel in 1957. Pharmaceutical industry was founded in Beerse in the 1960s, with Janssen Pharmaceutica and more recently with Genzyme in Geel. Soudal (silicon) in Turnhout and Ravago (plastics) in Arendonk became leading companies in their markets. Wide open spaces with scarce population also led to the establishment of several military bases, such as the army installations at Leopoldsburg and Brasschaat, and the air bases of Kleine Brogel, Oostmalle, Weelde and Zutendaal. Due to the exploitation of the Campine coal basin, especially after World War II, new industrial activity was established, such as in Geel, Beringen and Genk. The Belgian village of Malle is called Heart of the Campine', while Westerlo and Kasterlee are called Pearl of the Campine. The most picturesque villages in the Dutch, Northern-Brabant Campine are Oirschot, Eersel and Hilvarenbeek. The other villages have lost much of their historical elements in their course towards industrialisation. In the Dutch Campine eight villages are located which are known under the name acht zaligheden (E: eight blessed ones). The denomination zaligheden has been borrowed from the sel, which is at the end of the name of seven of these eight villages selligheden). Mechelse Hei (Maasmechelen heath) In the Campine there are still a number of bunches, marshes, heathlands and pastures. Large areas of the region were also covered with pine which was used in the coalmines of Wallonia and Limburg. The first pine in the Campine was sown in the Gierlebos in Vosselaar by Adriaan Ghys for Amalia van Solms in 1667.Harry De Kok, Het Turnhout Van Toen, Publ. Marc Van de Wiel, Bruges, 1987, p.112 Where the Campine, up to around 1960 includes mainly heathland, oak grove and marsh, these were modified by heavy fertilisation and building activities and were gradually changed into a rather small-scale landscape. Here and there still up to several dozen acres of large heathland - and forests, such as the Kalmthoutse Heide (E: Kalmthout heathland) at Kalmthout, Belgium, the De Maten in Genk, De Zegge (Geel), Zwart Water (Lichtaart), the Zwart Water moors (Turnhout), the Liereman (Oud-Turnhout) and the Prinsenpark (Retie). The natural reserves De Teut in Zonhoven and Ter Haagdoornheide in Houthalen- Helchteren and the Nationaal Park Hoge Kempen. At the border with Belgium in the Dutch part of Campine near Bladel there is natural landscape area with heathland such as Cartierheide and De Pals and Kroonvense Heide. To the North, the area between Boxtel and Oisterwijk is called Kampina. In a number of villages one can still see the typical Campine langgevelboerderijen (long- facade farms).

Intertrust is headquartered in Silicon Valley and has offices in Munich, Tokyo, Seoul, London, Paris, Mumbai, Beijing, Tallinn, Riga and Bangalore.  History  Victor H. Shear received a BA in sociology from Brandeis University, served as chief executive of Data Scientific Corporation from 1982 to 1985, and then co-founded Personal Library Software. Around 1985, Shear attempted to obtain one of the first US patents for software. For example, one patent covered metering and protecting data on a compact disc from 1986. Granted May 2, 1989 The company began under the name Electronic Publishing Resources in January 1990. David M. Van Wie became involved with InterTrust in early 1991. Intertrust technology, called digital rights management (DRM), enabled trusted transactions, from healthcare, enterprise computing to entertainment and consumer electronics. In 1995, the company announced its technology would be used by Novell. Former Bell Labs Fellow David P. Maher became chief technology officer in 1999. In 1996, Electronic Publishing Resources was renamed Intertrust Technologies. At the peak of the Internet bubble in October 1999, despite a lack of any earnings, Intertrust had its initial public offering. It was listed on the NASDAQ exchange with symbol ITRU. Within six months, the share price rose from $9 to $35, and a secondary offering on April 12, 2000 raised another $92 million. In 2001, two companies were acquired: PublishOne, Inc., and ZeroGravity Technologies, and Nokia invested $20 million. However, by the end of 2001 losses had climbed to over $115 million a year, and shares were sometimes trading below $1 each. Workforce reductions and office closures were announced in October 2001 and January 2002, which helped to end the losses. In May 2002, further workforce reductions were announced, and marketing and development of software ceased as the company focused on licensing intellectual property. In early 2003, the company became a joint venture of Philips, Sony and Stephens Inc., and Talal Shamoon was appointed as the CEO Intertrust Office 920 Stewart Dr #100 Sunnyvale, CA 94085 In April 2004, Microsoft settled the 2001 lawsuit, and agreed to pay $440 million to license Intertrust‚Äôs patents. The week before the settlement, Microsoft and Time Warner announced they had acquired a majority stake in ContentGuard, a company which developed similar software. In 2006, the company co-founded the Coral Consortium for content interoperability with Fox, Samsung, Sony, Philips, Panasonic and HP. Intertrust licensed DRM technologies to large technology and media corporations. The company then developed technology called Marlin, with mixed success. The continued emphasis on intellectual property caused the company to be called a \\"patent troll\\". Huawei Technologies announced it would license Marlin in 2011. A 2007 venture using Marlin with Pioneer Corporation called SyncTV had an investment from HTC Corporation in 2012. A public key infrastructure (PKI) service for Marlin called Seacert was announced in 2011. Between 2008 and 2016, Intertrust invested in companies that developed synergistic technologies. In March, 2013, Intertrust filed a patent suit against Apple Inc. Apple settled the suit in April 2014 for undisclosed terms.

The goal was to promote industrial development by co-operating closely with private firms. The objective of industrial policy was to shift resources to specific industries in order to gain international competitive advantage for Japan. The policies and methods were used primarily to increase the productivity of inputs and to influence, directly or indirectly, industrial investment. Administrative guidance (gy≈çsei shid≈ç Ë°åÊîøÊåáÂ∞é) is a principal instrument of enforcement used extensively throughout the Japanese government to support a wide range of policies. Influence, prestige, advice, and persuasion are used to encourage both corporations and individuals to work in directions judged desirable. The persuasion is exerted and the advice is given by public officials, who often have the power to provide or to withhold loans, grants, subsidies, licenses, tax concessions, government contracts, import permits, foreign exchange, and approval of cartel arrangements. The Japanese use administrative guidance to buffer market swings, anticipate market developments, and enhance market competition. Mechanisms used by the Japanese government to affect the economy typically relate to trade, labor markets, competition, and tax incentives. They include a broad range of trade protection measures, subsidies, de jure and de facto exemptions from antitrust statutes, labor market adjustments, and industry-specific assistance to enhance the use of new technology. Rather than producing a broad range of goods, the Japanese selected a few areas in which they could develop high- quality goods to produce in vast quantities at competitive prices. A good example is the camera industry, which since the 1960s has been dominated by Japan. Historically, there have been three main elements in Japanese industrial development. The first was the development of a highly competitive manufacturing sector. The second was the deliberate restructuring of industry toward higher value-added, high productivity industries. In the late 1980s, these were mainly knowledge-intensive tertiary industries. The third element was aggressive domestic and international business strategies. Japan has few natural resources and depends on massive imports of raw materials. It must export to pay for its imports, and manufacturing and the sales of its services, such as banking and finance, were its principal means of doing so. For these reasons, the careful development of the producing sector has been a key concern of both government and industry throughout most of the twentieth century. Government and business leaders generally agree that the composition of Japan's output must continually shift if living standards are to rise. Government plays an active role in making these shifts, often anticipating economic developments rather than reacting to them. After World War II, the initial industries that policy makers and the general public felt Japan should have were iron and steel, shipbuilding, the merchant marine, machine industries in general, heavy electrical equipment, and chemicals. Later, they added the automobile industry, petrochemicals, and nuclear power and, in the 1980s, such industries as computers and semiconductors. Since the late 1970s, the government has strongly encouraged the development of knowledge-intensive industries. Government support for research and development grew rapidly in the 1980s, and large joint government-industry development projects in computers and robotics were started. At the same time, government promoted the managed decline of competitively troubled industries, including textiles, shipbuilding, and chemical fertilizers through such measures as tax breaks for corporations that retrained workers to work at other tasks. Although industrial policy remained important in Japan in the 1970s and 1980s, thinking began to change. Government seemed to intervene less and become more respectful of price mechanisms in guiding future development. During this period, trade and direct foreign investment were liberalized, tariff and nontariff trade barriers were lowered, and the economies of the advanced nations became more integrated, as the result of the growth of international trade and international corporations. In the late 1980s, knowledge-intensive and high-technology industries became prominent. The government showed little inclination to promote such booming parts of the economy as fashion design, advertising, and management consulting. The question at the end of the 1980s was whether the government would become involved in such new developments or whether it would let them progress on their own.

He was known for protecting the open space of the Santa Monica Mountains and successfully pushing the city to ban smoking in restaurants and government buildings. Biography Braude was born on August 11, 1920, in Chicago, Illinois, the only son of Benjamin and Rose Braude, and attended the University of Illinois in 1937. He graduated from the University of Chicago in 1941 with a bachelor's degree in political science. He was a research assistant with the Cowles Commission for Research in Economics in 1941 and an instructor in social science at the University of Chicago in 1942. He owned and operated small businesses and a small investment firm until he was elected to the City Council in 1965.Los Angeles public library reference fileSteve Hymon and Patrick McGreevy, \\"Marvin Braude, 85,\\" Los Angeles Times, December 9, 2005 Braude was married to Marjorie Sperry of Chicago on September 26, 1948; they went to Yosemite on their honeymoon and decided then to move to California, which they did in 1951. She became a medical doctor and specialized in psychiatry. The couple moved to the Brentwood district of Los Angeles in 1952. They had two children, Liza, born in May 1953, and Ann, born in July 1955. Marjorie Braude, who became head of the Los Angeles Domestic Violence Task Force, died one month after her husband. He was co-founder and first president of the Santa Monica Mountains Regional Park Association, founder of Capital for Small Business in Los Angeles and president of the Crestwood Hills Association.\\"Crestwood Hills Group to Picnic on Labor Day,\\" Los Angeles Times, August 31, 1958, page WS-4 He was described as being \\"professorial, cranky and wonkish . . . abrupt and cantakerous, especially with those who stood in his way.\\" \\"The polyester suits he ordered from Sears, Roebuck & Co. catalogs were one of his trademarks. He brought health food in plastic containers to the banquets he was obliged to attend.\\" Braude died at the age of 84 on December 7, 2005, in Rancho Mirage, California, after breaking his leg in a fall and contracting pneumonia while in the hospital. He chose to be cremated, said his daughter Ann, because he believed using open space for cemeteries was \\"poor land-use policy.\\" A memorial service was held at University Synagogue in Brentwood, Los Angeles, and donations were asked for the Santa Monica Mountains Conservancy. City Council =Elections= See also List of Los Angeles municipal election returns, 1965 and after. In April 1965, Braude took on conservative incumbent Karl L. Rundberg in Los Angeles City Council District 11 and finished the primary election with less than half the votes of Rundberg (11,033 against 22,397), but in the May 1965 final, a \\"wave of public indignation over plans to carve a major highway across the Santa Monica Mountains\\" carried him into office:Jeffrey L. Rabin, \\"This Time,\\" Los Angeles Times, March 28, 1993 he beat the veteran Rundberg by 22,023 votes to 18,976. Braude was not seriously threatened in succeeding elections until 1997, when he faced \\"a strong challenge\\" from Cindy Miscikowski, his former chief of staff, among others. In 1996 he said he would begin to donate large sums of money from his $100,000 salary and his extensive financial portfolio to fund city projects within his district if he were reelected.\\"Braude Vows to Donate $426,000 for District Projects,\\" Los Angeles Times, April 23, 1996. He decided, however, to retire instead of campaigning. In that era (1971), the 11th District covered Pacific Palisades, Brentwood, West Los Angeles, with sections of Tarzana, Encino, Rancho Park, Westdale, Mar Vista and Venice. It covered 52 square miles and had some 210,000 residents. =Positions= * Mulholland Drive.

Collins English Dictionary. ; ‚Äì 13 July 1944) was a Russian Orthodox Christian theologian, philosopher, priest and economist. Biography =Early life: 1871‚Äì1898= Sergei Nikolaevich Bulgakov was born on 16 July 1871 to the family of an Orthodox priest (Nikolai Bulgakov) in the town of Livny, Oryol guberniya, in Russia. The family provided Orthodox priests for six generations, beginning in the sixteenth century with his ancestor Bulgak, a Tatar.George Vernadsky, The Mongols and Russia, Yale University Press (1943), p. 384Catherine Evtuhov, The Cross & the Sickle: Sergei Bulgakov and the Fate of Russian Religious Philosophy, Cornell University Press (1997), p. 23Judith Deutsch Kornblatt & Richard F. Gustafson, Russian Religious Thought, Univ of Wisconsin Press (1996), p. 135 Metropolitan Macarius Bulgakov (1816‚Äì1882), one of the major Eastern Orthodox theologians of his days, and one of the most important Russian church historians, was a distant relative.Rowan Williams, \\"General introduction\\" in Sergii Nikolaevich Bulgakov, Sergii Bulgakov: Towards a Russian Political Theology, A&C; Black (1999), p. 3 At the age of fourteen, after three years at the local parish school, Bulgakov entered the seminary in Orel. Although in 1888, Bulgakov quit the seminary after a loss of his faith. Bulgakov later notes that the passion for the priesthood waned as he grew disenchanted with Orthodoxy because his teachers were unable to answer his questions.Sergei Bulgakov, A Bulgakov Anthology, Wipf & Stock (2012), p. 3 After Bulgakov quit seminary, he entered a secular gimnasium in Elets to prepare for the law faculty of Moscow University. =Early political thought: 1890‚Äì1897= In 1890, Bulgakov entered Moscow University where he chose to study political economy and law. Although, as he reflected years later, literature and philosophy were his natural inclination and he had no interest in law. Bulgakov only chose to study law because it seemed more likely to contribute to his country's redemption.Sergei Bulgakov, A Bulgakov Anthology, Wipf & Stock (2012), p. 4 After his graduation in 1894, he began graduate studies at the university and taught for two years at the Moscow Commercial Institute. It was during his graduate studies when Bulgakov studied with the economist Alexander Chuprov. Bulgakov's thought during his studies with Chuprov has generally been seen through the lens of the Marxist-Populist debate. From this perspective, he has been labeled a \\"legal Marxist.\\"See especially the biography of Bulgakov in Richard Kindersley, The First Russian Revisionists: A Study of \\"Legal Marxism\\" in Russia. Oxford: Clarendon Press, 1962; pp. 59‚Äì63. In 1895, Bulgakov published a review of Karl Marx's unfinished third volume of Das Kapital, and authored an essay in 1896, ‚ÄúOn the Regularity of Social Phenomena.‚Äù In the following year, Bulgakov published a study ‚ÄúOn Markets in Capitalist Conditions of Production.‚Äù It was these writings that originally established Bulgakov as a significant representative of Marxism in Russia. =From Marxism to Idealism: 1898‚Äì1902= On January 14th, 1898, shortly before embarking for Western Europe, Bulgakov married Elena Tokmakova, with whom he had two sons and a daughter.Russian Religious Thought edited by Judith Deutsch Kornblatt and Richard F. Gustafson. Univ of Wisconsin Press (1996). p.135 In 1898 Bulgakov left for Western Europe to begin his research for his dissertation, Capitalism and Agriculture, that was intended to test the application of Marx‚Äôs theory of capitalist societies to agriculture. Bulgakov examined the entire agricultural history of Germany, the United States, Ireland, France, and England. However, Bulgakov's master thesis ended by declaring that Marx‚Äôs pretensions about capitalist societies based on the English economy were unfounded due to inapplicability of Marx's theory to agriculture, and therefore the impossibility of any universal account of capitalist society. In 1900 Bulgakov presented his finished dissertation for examination. It was this examination that led Bulgakov to being a privatdozent at the University of Kiev and Professor of Political Economy at the Kiev Polytechnic Institute in 1901. It was already evident in lectures such as \\"Ivan Karamazov as a philosophical type\\" delivered in Kiev that Bulgakov has already distanced himself from Marxism. At the time of Bulgakov teaching about Dostoevsky, the counterweight to Marxism in 20th Russia was Neo-Kantianism. While Bulgakov was heavily influenced by Neo-Kantianism, it was Vladimir Soloviev, who he began to read in 1902, that influenced Bulgakov to finally reject materialism and accept idealism. Bulgakov's idealism eventually led him back to the Orthodox Church. =Turmoil: 1903‚Äì1909= 1907 caricature portraying Bulgakov as a member of the State Duma Together with Petr Struve, Bulgakov published the journal Liberation and with him was a founder of the illegal political organization ‚ÄúUnion of Liberation‚Äù in 1903. After the Revolution of 1905 its members formed the Constitutional Democratic (Kadet) Party, which held the most seats in the representative assemblies, the First and Second Dumas (1906‚Äì1907). But Bulgakov did not join the Kadets and instead formed the Union of Christian Politics, a party advocating Christian socialism. Although he was elected to the Second Duma in 1907 as a deputy for Orel province, Bulgakov had no party allegiance. In June 1907, the Second Duma dissolved after barely five months in session. After the dissolution of the Second Duma, Bulgakov lost what remaining zeal he had for direct political involvement. Another major factor in his eventual separation from the Union of Liberation was the increasingly anti-Christian direction being championed by leading representatives of left- liberal politics. Earlier, in 1905 Bulgakov, along with the Brotherhood of Christian Struggle, bishops, priests, and many others, supported the call for a council of the Orthodox Church in support of social reforms. In 1906, a preconciliar commission prepared six volumes of information for the council. Unfortunately, Nicholas II thwarted the council, but the information collected by the commission would be put to use when the council eventually convened in eleven years later. Amidst the chaos of 1905, Bulgakov made the acquaintance of Pavel Florensky (1882‚Äì1937), with whom he would establish a long-lasting friendship. Bulgakov and Florensky were among founding members of the Religious-Philosophical Society in memory of Vladimir Soloviev, which was organized in Moscow at the end of 1905. During 1904‚Äì1909, his focus shifted to an explicitly Christian perspective. Bulgakov also changed his attitude towards the controversial Nicholas II. He believed Nicholas II was responsible for the social problems plaguing Russia. Although Bulgakov did not appreciate the increasing radicalization of the leftists in Russia and their abandonment of Russian Orthodoxy in favor of a purely secular state. Quite the contrary, it caused him to uphold the positive value of governance by Nicholas II, even as he continued to detest him, accusing him of promoting the revolution and bringing about the demise of the royal family. Bulgakov continued to struggle with the meaning of political power as he wrote Unfading Light. In the summer of 1909, Bulgakov's four-year-old son Ivashechka, died. At the funeral Bulgakov had a profound religious experience that is generally regarded as his final step in his journey back to Orthodoxy.Sergei Bulgakov, Unfading Light: Contemplations and Speculations, Eerdmans (2012), p. xxv Bulgakov would later contemplate on the meaning of death in his later works, including Unfading Light. =Civic life: 1918‚Äì1944= In 1918, Bulgakov was ordained to the priesthood, and rose to prominence in church circles. He took part in the All- Russia Sobor of the Russian Orthodox Church that elected patriarch Tikhon of Moscow. Bulgakov rejected the October revolution and responded with On the Feast of the Gods (\\"–ù–∞ –ø–∏—Ä—É –±–æ–≥–æ–≤\\", 1918), a book similar to the Three Talks of Vladimir Solovyov. In 1918, Bulgakov moved to join his family in the Crimea, where for two years he taught political economy and theology at the university in Simferopol. Unfortunately, the Bolsheviks captured Simferopol in 1920 and removed him from his teaching position. In 1922 the Soviet government exiled around 150 prominent intellectuals on the so-called Philosophers' ship, Bulgakov, Nikolai Berdyaev, and Ivan Ilyin among them. In 1925 he helped found St. Sergius Orthodox Theological Institute (l'Institut de Th√©ologie Orthodoxe Saint-Serge) in Paris, France. While living in Paris, he completed two dogmatic trilogies on Sophiology ‚Äî the first, The Burning Bush (1926), The Friend of the Bridegroom (1927), Jacob‚Äôs Ladder (1929); the second, The Lamb of God, The Comforter, The Bride of the Lamb (1939). It is in The Bride of the Lamb that Bulgakov argues for apokatastasis. Bulgakov states that humankind will ‚Äúultimately be justified.‚Äù After the publication of his book, The Lamb of God, Bulgaakov was accused of teachings contrary to Orthodox dogma by the Metropolitan Sergius I of Moscow, in 1935, and recommended his exclusion Moscow Orthodox Church until he amended his \\"dangerous\\" views. The Karlovtsy Synod (i.e., Russian Orthodox Church Outside Russia) also joined in this condemnation. Metropolitan Evlogy set up a committee in Paris to investigate Bulgakov‚Äôs orthodoxy, which reached a preliminary conclusion that his thought was free from heresy. However, an official conclusion was never reached. He was the head of this institute and Professor of Dogmatic Theology until his death from throat cancer on 12 July 1944. His last work was devoted to the Apocalypse. He was buried in Sainte-Genevi√®ve-des-Bois Russian Cemetery in the southern suburbs of Paris.  Bibliography     Bulgakov, Sergei (1899).

Key passages occur in ¬ß256-¬ß271. The argument was central to philosophical discussion in the second half of the 20th century. In the Investigations Wittgenstein does not present his arguments in a succinct and linear fashion; instead, he describes particular uses of language, and prompts the reader to contemplate the implications of those uses. As a result, there is considerable dispute about both the nature of the argument and its implications. Indeed, it has become common to talk of private language arguments. Historians of philosophy see precursors of the private language argument in a variety of sources, notably in the work of Gottlob Frege and John Locke.A detailed account can be found in: Dejnozka, Jan Origins of the Private Language Argument Di√°logos 66, 59‚Äì78, 1995 Locke is also a prominent exponent of the view targeted by the argument, since he proposed in his An Essay Concerning Human Understanding that the referent of a word is the idea it stands for. Significance The private language argument is of central importance to debates about the nature of language. One compelling theory about language is that language maps words to ideas, concepts or representations in each person's mind. On this account, the concepts in one's head are distinct from the concepts in another's head. But I can match my concepts to a word in our common language, and then speak the word. You then match the word to a concept in your mind. So our concepts in effect form a private language which we translate into our common language and so share. This account is found for example in An Essay Concerning Human Understanding, and more recently in Jerry Fodor's language of thought theory. Wittgenstein argues, in his later work, that this account of private language is inconsistent. If the idea of a private language is inconsistent, then a logical conclusion would be that all language serves a social function. This would have profound implications for other areas of philosophical and psychological study. For example, if one cannot have a private language, it might not make any sense to talk of private experiences or of private mental states. Philosophical Investigations The argument is found in part one of the Philosophical investigations. This part consists of a series of \\"remarks\\" numbered sequentially. The core of the argument is generally thought to be presented in ¬ß256 and onward, though the idea is first introduced in ¬ß243. =What a private language is= If someone were to behave as if they understood a language of which no one else can make sense, we might call this an example of a private language.¬ß269. It is not sufficient here, however, for the language to simply be one that has not yet been translated. In order to count as a private language in Wittgenstein's sense, it must be in principle incapable of translation into an ordinary language ‚Äì if for example it were to describe those inner experiences supposed to be inaccessible to others.¬ß256. The private language being considered is not simply a language in fact understood by one person, but a language that in principle can only be understood by one person. So the last speaker of a dying language would not be speaking a private language, since the language remains in principle learnable. A private language must be unlearnable and untranslatable, and yet it must appear that the speaker is able to make sense of it. =The sensation S= Wittgenstein sets up a thought experiment in which someone is imagined to associate some recurrent sensation with a symbol by writing S in their calendar when the sensation occurs.¬ß258. Such a case would be a private language in the Wittgensteinian sense. Furthermore, it is presupposed that S cannot be defined using other terms, for example \\"the feeling I get when the manometer rises\\"; for to do so would be to give S a place in our public language, in which case S could not be a statement in a private language.¬ß270. It might be supposed that one might use \\"a kind of ostensive definition\\" for S, by focusing on the sensation and on the symbol. Early in The Investigations, Wittgenstein attacks the usefulness of ostensive definition.¬ß27‚Äì34 He considers the example of someone pointing to two nuts while saying \\"This is called two\\". How does it come about that the listener associates this with the number of items, rather than the type of nut, their colour, or even a compass direction? One conclusion of this is that to participate in an ostensive definition presupposes an understanding of the process and context involved, of the form of life.¬ß23. Another is that \\"an ostensive definition can be variously interpreted in every case\\".¬ß28, italics in original In the case of the sensation S Wittgenstein argues that there is no criterion for the correctness of such an ostensive definition, since whatever seems right will be right, 'And that only means that here we can't talk about \\"right\\".' The exact reason for the rejection of private language has been contentious. One interpretation, which has been called memory scepticism, has it that one might remember the sensation wrongly, and that as a result one might misuse the term S . The other, called meaning scepticism, has it that one can never be sure of the meaning of a term defined in this way. =Memory scepticism= One common interpretation is that the possibility exists that one might misremember the sensation, and therefore one does not have any firm criterion for using S in each case.This account is supported by ¬ß207 So, for example, I might one day focus on that sensation, and link it to the symbol S; but the next day, I have no criteria for knowing that the sensation I have now is the same as the one yesterday, except for my memory; and since my memory might fail me, I have no firm criteria for knowing that the sensation I have now is indeed S. However, memory scepticism has been criticized as applying to public language, also. If one person can misremember, it is entirely possible that several people can misremember. So memory scepticism could be applied with equal effect to ostensive definitions given in a public language. For example, Jim and Jenny might one day decide to call some particular tree T; but the next day both misremember which tree it was they named. If they were depending entirely on their memory, and had not written down the location of the tree, or told anyone else, then they would appear to be with the same difficulties as the individual who defined S ostensively. And so, if this is the case, the argument presented against private language would apply equally to public language. This interpretation (and the criticism of Wittgenstein that arises from it) is based on a complete misreading, however, because Wittgenstein's argument has nothing to do with the fallibility of human memory, but rather concerns the intelligibility of remembering something for which there is no external criterion of correctness. It is not that we will not, in fact, remember the sensation correctly, but rather that it makes no sense to talk about our memory being either correct or incorrect in this case. The point, as Diego Marconi puts it, is not so much that private language is \\"a game at which we can't win, it is a game we can't lose\\". Wittgenstein makes this clear in section 258: \\"A definition surely serves to establish the meaning of a sign.‚ÄîWell, that is done precisely by the concentrating of my attention; for in this way I impress on myself the connexion between the sign and the sensation.‚ÄîBut \\"I impress it on myself\\" can only mean: this process brings it about that I remember the connexion right in the future. But in the present case, I have no criterion of correctness.\\" This absence of any criterion of correctness is not a problem because it makes it more difficult for the private linguist to remember his sensation correctly; it is a problem because it undermines the intelligibility of such a concept as remembering the sensation, whether correctly or incorrectly. Wittgenstein explains this unintelligibility with a series of analogies. For example, in section 265 he observes the pointlessness of a dictionary that exists only in the imagination. Since the idea of a dictionary is to justify the translation of one word by another, and thus constitute the reference of justification for such a translation, all this is lost the moment we talk of a dictionary in the imagination; for ‚Äújustification consists in appealing to something independent\\". Hence, to appeal to a private ostensive definition as the standard of correct use of a term would be \\"as if someone were to buy several copies of the morning paper to assure himself that what it said was true.\\" =Meaning scepticism= Another interpretation, found for example in the account presented by Anthony KennyKenny, Anthony. Wittgenstein pp.193‚Äì4 has it that the problem with a private ostensive definition is not just that it might be misremembered, but that such a definition cannot lead to a meaningful statement. Let us first consider a case of ostensive definition in a public language. Jim and Jenny might one day decide to call some particular tree T; but the next day misremember which tree it was they named. In this ordinary language case, it makes sense to ask questions such as \\"is this the tree we named T yesterday?\\" and make statements such as \\"This is not the tree we named T yesterday\\". So one can appeal to other parts of the form of life, perhaps arguing: \\"this is the only Oak in the forest; T was an oak; therefore this is T\\". An everyday ostensive definition is embedded in a public language, and so in the form of life in which that language occurs. Participation in a public form of life enables correction to occur. That is, in the case of a public language there are other ways to check the use of a term that has been ostensively defined. We can justify our use of the new name T by making the ostensive definition more or less explicit. But this is not the case with S. Recall that because S is part of a private language, it is not possible to provide an explicit definition of S. The only possible definition is the private, ostensive one of associating S with that feeling. But this is the very thing being questioned. \\"Imagine someone saying: 'But I know how tall I am!' and laying his hand on top of his head to prove it.\\"¬ß279. A recurrent theme in Wittgenstein's work is that for some term or utterance to have a sense, it must be conceivable that it be doubted. For Wittgenstein, tautologies do not have sense, do not say anything, and so do not admit of doubt. But furthermore, if any other sort of utterance does not admit of doubt, it must be senseless. Rush Rhees, in his notes on lectures given by Wittgenstein, while discussing the reality of physical objects, has him say: > We get something similar when we write a tautology like \\"p ‚Üí p\\". We > formulate such expressions to get something in which there is no doubt ‚Äì > even though the sense has vanished with the doubt.The Language of Sense Data > and Private Experience: Notes taken by Rush Rhees of Wittgenstein's > Lectures, 1936 Lecture VIII, February 24, 1936. in Klagge, James, Nordmann, > Alfred (editors) (1993) Ludwig Wittgenstein: Philosophical Occasions > 1912‚Äì1951p. 318. See for comparison, Investigations, ¬ß298 As Kenny put it, \\"Even to think falsely that something is S, I must know the meaning of S; and this is what Wittgenstein argues is impossible in the private language.\\"Kenny (1973) p. 192 Because there is no way to check the meaning (or use) of S apart from that private ostensive act of definition, it is not possible to know what S means. The sense has vanished with the doubt. Wittgenstein uses the further analogy of the left hand giving the right hand money.¬ß268 The physical act might take place, but the transaction could not count as a gift. Similarly, one might say S while focusing on a sensation, but no act of naming has occurred. =The beetle-in-a-box= The beetle-in-a-box is a famous thought experiment that Wittgenstein introduces in the context of his investigation of pains.¬ß293 Pains occupy a distinct and vital place in the philosophy of mind for several reasons.Rorty, Richard Philosophy and the Mirror of Nature, 1979 One is that pains seem to collapse the appearance/reality distinction.Rorty, p. 97 If an object appears to you to be red it might not be so in reality, but if you seem to yourself to be in pain you must be so: there can be no case here of seeming at all. At the same time, one cannot feel another person's pain, but only infer it from their behavior and their reports of it. If we accept pains as special qualia known absolutely but exclusively by the solitary minds that perceive them, this may be taken to ground a Cartesian view of the self and consciousness. Our consciousness, of pains anyway, would seem unassailable. Against this, one might acknowledge the absolute fact of one's own pain, but claim skepticism about the existence of anyone else's pains. Alternatively, one might take a behaviorist line and claim that our pains are merely neurological stimulations accompanied by a disposition to behave.Rorty, pp. 18‚Äì19 Wittgenstein invites readers to imagine a community in which the individuals each have a box containing a \\"beetle\\". \\"No one can look into anyone else's box, and everyone says he knows what a beetle is only by looking at his beetle.\\" If the \\"beetle\\" had a use in the language of these people, it could not be as the name of something ‚Äì because it is entirely possible that each person had something completely different in their box, or even that the thing in the box constantly changed, or that each box was in fact empty. The content of the box is irrelevant to whatever language game it is used in. By analogy, it does not matter that one cannot experience another's subjective sensations. Unless talk of such subjective experience is learned through public experience the actual content is irrelevant; all we can discuss is what is available in our public language. By offering the \\"beetle\\" as an analogy to pains, Wittgenstein suggests that the case of pains is not really amenable to the uses philosophers would make of it. \\"That is to say: if we construe the grammar of the expression of sensation on the model of 'object and designation', the object drops out of consideration as irrelevant.\\" =Following a rule= It is common to describe language use in terms of the rules that one follows, and Wittgenstein considers rules in some detail. He famously suggests that any act can be made out to follow from a given rule.\\"Whatever I do is, on some interpretation, in accord with the rule\\", ¬ß198‚Äì9 He does this in setting up a dilemma: > This was our paradox: no course of action could be determined by a rule, > because every course of action can be made out to accord with the rule. The > answer was: if everything can be made out to accord with the rule, then it > can also be made out to conflict with it. And there would be neither accord > nor conflict here.¬ß201 One can give an explanation of why one followed a particular rule in a particular case. But any explanation for rule following behaviour cannot be given in terms of following a rule, without involving circularity. One can say something like \\"She did X because of the rule R\\" but if you say \\"She followed R because of the rule R1\\" one can then ask \\"but why did she follow rule R1?\\" and so potentially become involved in a regression. Explanation must have an end.¬ß87 His conclusion: > What this shows is that there is a way of grasping a rule which is not an > interpretation, but which is exhibited in what we call \\"obeying the rule\\" > and \\"going against it\\" in actual cases.¬ß201, italics in original So following a rule is a practice. And furthermore, since one can think one is following a rule and yet be mistaken, thinking one is following a rule is not the same as following it. Therefore, following a rule cannot be a private activity.¬ß202 Kripke's interpretation In 1982 Saul Kripke published a new and innovative account of the argument in his book Wittgenstein on Rules and Private Language.Kripke, Saul. Wittgenstein on Rules and Private Language. Basil Blackwell Publishing, 1982. Kripke takes the paradox discussed in ¬ß201 to be the central problem of the Philosophical Investigations. He develops the paradox into a Grue-like problem, arguing that it similarly results in skepticism, but about meaning rather than about induction.Kripke, Saul. Wittgenstein on Rules and Private Language. pp 7‚Äì25 He proposes a new form of addition, which he calls quus, which is identical with plus in all cases except those in which either of the numbers to be added is greater than 57, thus: > text{x quus y}= begin{cases} text{x + y} & text{for }x,y <57 [12pt] > 5 & text{otherwise} end{cases} He then asks if anyone could know that previously when I thought I had meant plus, I had not meant quus. He claims that his argument shows that \\"Each new application we make is a leap in the dark; any present intention could be interpreted to accord with anything we may choose to do. So there can be neither accord nor conflict\\".Kripke, Saul. Wittgenstein on Rules and Private Language. pp 55 Kripke's account is considered by some commentators to be unfaithful to Wittgenstein,E.g., G.P. Baker and P.M.S. Hacker, Scepticism, Rules, and Language (Oxford: Blackwell, 1984) and Colin McGinn, Wittgenstein on Meaning (Oxford: Blackwell, 1984). and as a result has been referred to as \\"Kripkenstein\\". Even Kripke himself suspected that many aspects of the account were inconsistent with Wittgenstein's original intent, leading him to urge that the book \\"should be thought of as expounding neither 'Wittgenstein's' argument nor 'Kripke's': rather Wittgenstein's argument as it struck Kripke, as it presented a problem for him.\\"Kripke, Saul.

Structure The root emerges from the posterior part of the spinal cord and travels to the dorsal root ganglion. The dorsal root ganglia contain the pseudo-unipolar cell bodies of the nerve fibres which travel from the ganglia through the root into the spinal cord. The lateral division of the dorsal root contains lightly myelinated and unmyelinated fibres of small diameter. These carry pain and temperature sensation. These fibers cross through the anterior white commissure to form the anterolateral system in the lateral funiculus. The medial division of the dorsal root contains myelinated fibres of larger diameter. These transmit information of discriminative touch, pressure, vibration, and conscious proprioception originating from spinal levels C2 through S5. These fibers are pushed in towards the posterior median sulcus to form the gracile fasciculus and the cuneate fasciculus of the posterior column‚Äìmedial lemniscus pathway.

There are many variations on single back formations including two tight ends and two wide receivers, one tight end/three wide receivers, etc. The running back can line up directly behind the quarterback or offset either the weak side (away from the tight end) or the strong side (towards the tight end). Use in the NFL New England Patriots in a standard singleback formation against the Steelers in 2005. Notice running back Corey Dillon (#28) lined up 7 yards behind quarterback Tom Brady, who is under center. Washington Redskins coach Joe Gibbs first began using the single-back as a base offense in order to move defenders off the line of scrimmage. He found that having an extra receiver on the line forced defenses to choose their poison by either defending the pass or the run because they were not able to focus on both at once using the number of personnel that they had on the field. He also then began utilizing sets of two tight ends as blockers mainly to protect his quarterbacks from Lawrence Taylor. He believed having an extra blocker on the line would make it easier to keep Taylor out of his backfield. By using different formations and motion before the ball was snapped, he also found that he could confuse defenders on whether the play would be a pass or a run. This formation has gained popularity in the NFL as teams have started trading out a fullback, or blocking back, in favor of another wide receiver or tight end who is usually faster and better able to receive the ball, while still helping the run game with down-field blocks. The effectiveness of the formation is further increased if the team has athletic tight ends with good pass catching abilities, thereby increasing the versatility of the formation. It is, moreover, good for bootlegs and reverses. Miami Dolphins lined up in an offset singleback set vs the Bills in 2010. Notice running back Ronnie Brown (#23) lined up behind the right tackle instead of directly behind quarterback Chad Henne. Brown is also only 4 yards deep in the backfield when offset, as opposed to 7 yards normally. A nearly obsolete variant is the offset singleback set, in which the running back is offset behind a tackle or a guard. In this look, the running back would usually be closer to the line of scrimmage than in a standard singleback look (3-5 yards as opposed to 5-7 yards). This generally would be on 3rd downs or other passing downs, with the back aligned to the side of the defender he was assigned to block. However, the back could also catch a pass or take a handoff, using mechanics similar to that of the pro set. As shotgun became more popular, teams began utilizing this back placement with the quarterback in the shotgun instead of under center. In shotgun singleback, the running back therefore stands about the same distance from the line of scrimmage as his quarterback. However, traditional offset singleback formations are still run on rare occasions, nearly always in passing situations. Single-back offenses have gained popularity due to zone blocking and advanced defenses. There are several combinations of single back formations that are used in Division 1 and NFL football. Speed offenses will use single back because the defense still has to respect the run out of these formations since you can line up many tight ends and still have a down field passing game. Single back offenses create match-up problems in the defense. Linebackers will often have to cover receivers in passing routes while defensive safeties are used more to come up and stop the run on the line of scrimmage. Teams that run a single-back offense typically rely on quick receivers that run great routes, balanced tight ends (blocking/receiving), intelligent, shifty running backs, fast and intelligent offensive linemen, and a quarterback that can read defenses and make safe throws under pressure. Single-back offenses are more common in the NFL than in college or high school.

However, his primary interest was in painting. In the meantime, he took lessons in painting by mail from Germany. In 1920, after graduating from the high school, Ihap Hulusi went to Munich, Germany, and studied painting for five years specializing in illustrations. Following his return, ƒ∞hap Hulusi's father enrolled him to the Ministry of Foreign Affairs in Istanbul against his will. So Ihap Hulusi dropped off after a while and devoted himself to commercial graphic art. Career Ihap Hulusi‚Äôs first work was the illustration for a toothpaste advertisement poster. In 1929 he established his first workshop in Istanbul and designed 1930 the famous bottle label for the Turkish liquor Raki brand \\"Kul√ºp Rakƒ±sƒ±\\". This artwork on the bottle label is still in use today. With the Latin alphabet reform in 1928, Atat√ºrk commissioned him in 1934 to make illustrations in order to promote the adoption of the new Turkish alphabet.

The two had met in the St. Louis area in 1994 where both lived, with Roberts working for a computer store and Gladney a customer. Gladney put up the initial capital ($600,000 or $1 million, according to different sources) for a 75% stake in the startup, with Roberts‚Äô stake the remaining 25%.\\"7-Up vs. Coke, Part 1\\" Riverfront Times Gary Zimmerman, recruited by Roberts from SBC Communications Inc. to become vice president of engineering at Savvis in November 1995, built out Robert's first national network design. The original network design was unique within the industry at the time it became fully operational, and there was significant coverage and discussion in the trade press regarding both the network and its architect, Roberts. In 2001, the last year in which Robert's original design was in use, Savvis was ranked the #1 fastest Backbone Network by Keynote Systems, an independent network ratings service. Roberts closed a revenue contract with Apple Computer, Inc. as their first large customer, dealing with David Zimmerman and Marty Suzuki at Apple's Cupertino headquarters. By leveraging the Apple Computer customer reference and testimonials, the company was able to close additional large contracts with other industry providers, and it quickly gained wide industry recognition. During this growth spurt, the company attracted the notice of St. Louis' Gateway Venture Partners, who subsequently invested millions of dollars. After the Gateway investment, Sam Sanderson, former CEO of Rogers Cable, was brought to helm the company. Sanderson brought much needed support to the company, closing substantial contracts and placing the company into an aggressive marketing position. Contemporaneously, Bob Murphy was named to the chief financial officer position (Murphy was previously the CFO of Williams Communications). Murphy in turn attracted additional capital, and a sound financial management team. = DiamondNet becomes Savvis = In 1996, DiamondNet changed its name to Savvis Communications Corporation.Savvis, Inc. = Founders part with Savvis = In 1997, Roberts left the company, and Gladney left his position as CEO to become vice chairman. Gladney's relationship with Savvis ended shortly thereafter in 1999. By the time of the company's IPO (in 2000), Gladney's stake was 1% of the outstanding shares. Growth and acquisitions  In 1999 Savvis was acquired by Bridge Information Systems. After a year as a Bridge Company, Savvis was spun off by Bridge as a public company.

Joydeep Sircar led the teams that explored the watershed ridge and discovered the pass after approaching through the Parbati River valley in Kullu. After an abortive attempt on an impassable col further north in 1992, the pass was located and reached in 1993, but the team refrained from crossing it into Spiti under the mistaken impression that they could be arrested because they did not have Inner Line Permits required for Spiti. Two years later, the 1995 team planned to approach from the Spiti side, which involves much less height gain, but tremendous autumn floods in the upper valley of the Beas River and other areas of Himachal which wrecked roads forced them to take the Parbati approach again. This time they crossed the pass on 21 September and completed the route from Manikaran to Kaja. Leomann's 1:200,000 map of Himachal Pradesh (Third Edition, 2005) shows a dotted track beginning at a point between the Kach (should read Kachh) and Bara Dwari Thach campsites, and crossing the Kullu-Spiti watershed divide into the West Debsa Glacier to follow the West Debsa and Debsa streams to Thidim (should be Thango) in the Parahio Valley. This is a fairly accurate representation of the 1995 route, though the pass is unmarked.

Popular with all of the local residents for various activities, it often hosts religious festivals, sports tournaments and small special events. In the past, Carter's Steam Fair visited the park every year. However, they had to suspend the annual event due to the discovery of ground subsidence in the park in 2001. Chalk mines were found underneath the park and the weight of the fairground rides posed a great danger.

Early years Born and raised in Atlantic, Iowa, Podolak played college football at the University of Iowa, where he was a quarterback and running back. Playing career Podolak was selected in the second round of the 1969 NFL/AFL draft, 48th overall, by the Kansas City Chiefs, and the team won Super Bowl IV in his rookie season. During a nine-year career from 1969 to 1977, Podolak became the Chiefs' second all-time leading rusher with 4,451 yards and 34 touchdowns on 1,158 carries. He was also known for his work on special teams as a pass receiver and return man, catching 288 passes for 2,456 yards and 6 touchdowns while averaging 8.6 yards per punt and 20.5 yards per kickoff return. His 8,178 career combined yards are the second-most in the team's history. Podolak led the Chiefs in rushing four times, in receiving three times, and in punt returns three times. In the Chiefs' playoff loss to the Miami Dolphins on Christmas Day in 1971 (still the longest game in NFL history), Podolak had a playoff-record 350 total yards: 85 rushing, 110 receiving, and 155 on returns. Podolak, who wore jersey number 14, was inducted into the Chiefs' Hall of Fame in 1989. After football After retirement, Podolak turned to broadcasting. He worked as a color commentator for NFL telecasts on NBC in 1978. In 1982, he began working as a commentator for Iowa Hawkeye football games on WHO radio in Des Moines and a statewide network. He worked with play-by-play announcer Jim Zabel until 1996 and then with Gary Dolphin.

The city (also known originally as Barbastra or Bergiduna) is at the junction of the rivers Cinca and Vero.  History  An ancient Celtiberian city called Bergidum or Bergiduna, in Roman times Barbastro (now called Brutina) was included in the Hispania Citerior region, and later of Hispania Tarraconensis. After the fall of the Western Roman Empire, it was part of the Visigoth kingdom. Barbastro and the Barbitaniya area were overtaken by Musa bin Nusair in 717, as part of the Ummayad push to conquer northern states of the Marca Hispanica and the name Madyar was given to the town. It was later settled by the Banu Jalaf who made it the capital of the Emirate of Barbineta and Huesca until 862, and was known as the Emirate of Brabstra until 882. In 1064, Sancho Ram√≠rez, King of Arag√≥n, and his Frankish Christian forces, led by William VIII of Aquitaine and Le Bon Normand, invaded the city, which at the time was part of the emir of Zaragoza. This attack was known as the Siege of Barbastro. Contemporary sources state that 50,000 people died in the attack, but modern historians view this as an exaggeration since the whole population of the town did not exceed 2,000. The following year, however, it was reconquered by the Moors. In 1101 it was conquered by Peter I of Aragon, who made it a bishopric seat. Barbastro since then followed the history of Aragon and Spain. During the Spanish Civil War 51 Claretians were executed in Barbastro by militiamen of the Popular Front. Numerous socialist, republican and communist activists were jailed and executed in the following years after the Spanish Civil War. Barbastro's economy flourished until the 20th century, when a period of decline began, ending only in the 1960s due to the growth of agricultural production.

It was called the GNAT (German Navy Acoustic Torpedo) by the British.  Description  The forerunner of the Zaunk√∂nig was the G7e/T4 Falke, codename \\"Falcon,\\" which was introduced in March 1943, but saw limited use for trial and was rapidly phased out of service in favor of the later that received a number of significant enhancements. It was faster, had more range, possessed a magnetic or contact detonator and could be equipped with a percussion pistol. The T5 torpedo was capable of 24 knots (44 km/h) and had an effective range of about 5000 metres against convoy escorts vessels proceeding at speeds between 10 (18 km/h) and 18 knots (33 km/h). The homing system consisted of two hydrophone receivers and altered the direction of the rudder via an electropneumatic device. The acoustic homing torpedo was specifically designed as to be attracted by the pitch of an escort's propellers and would ‚Äî even if aimed inaccurately ‚Äî explode under the ship's stern. There were three variants: * Two flat-nosed versions which contained four sets of magnetostriction hydrophones. * A round- nosed version which contained two magnetostriction hydrophones inside a funnel-shaped baffle.  Use  The acoustic homing torpedo required a minimum distance of to lock onto the target after launch. The detection range of the hydrophones varied much according to circumstance, but 450 m (500 yards) was considered reasonable for a ship moving at 15 knots.Campbell (1985). Naval Weapons of World War Two, p. 264 After at least two unconfirmed instances of U-boats ( and ) sinking after being allegedly hit by their own torpedoes, the BdU ordered the submarines to dive to and go completely silent after launching acoustic torpedoes to minimize the risk. The first 80 T5s were delivered on 1 August 1943, and the weapon was first used in a large-scale maneuver against the North Atlantic convoys ONS 18/ON 202 in late September 1943. The commanders reported a number of torpedo strikes and recorded the sinking of nine commercial steamers and 12 escort ships after the battle. In fact, only six merchant ships and three escort vessels, a destroyer, a frigate and a corvette were sunk. However, despite some initial success, in particular sinking destroyers and corvettes, the Zaunk√∂nigs effectiveness was quickly nullified by the introduction of a decoy known as Foxer noise maker. The NDRC worked on countermeasures to an acoustic torpedo long before its introduction by the Germans. At the end of September 1943, it was promptly installed on all transatlantic escort vessels. Grossadmiral D√∂nitz not satisfied with the development of countermeasures, realized, that his brief success against the North Atlantic trade convoys was only a flare up and recorded: In spite of highly effective Allied countermeasures, a total of over 700 T5s were fired in combat, sinking 77 ships.

It sought to combine Catholic belief with left-wing politics and was influenced by the thinking of Ludwig Wittgenstein and Karl Marx. Influential members included Terry Eagleton and Herbert McCabe. Denys Turner is a significant theologian influenced by Slant. Description The context of Slant has been explained by James Smith in his critical introduction to Terry Eagleton. Slant came into being in the mid-1960s in Cambridge, as a journal \\"devoted to a Catholic exploration of .. radical politics\\". The first issue was published in spring 1964. This issue began with an introduction by Raymond Williams and for the first six issues Slant was a quarterly journal. From volume 2 (February/March 1966), it evolved to a bimonthly publication, which was eventually published by Sheed and Ward, a Catholic publishing house. Slant ceased publication in 1970 after 30 issues. The editorial board of Slant included a number of individuals who were at that time students at Cambridge, or who had recently been students in Cambridge, and who subsequently went on to academic careers: Adrian Cunningham (who went on to be Professor of Religious Studies at the University of Lancaster), Terry Eagleton, and Leo Pyle (later, Professor of Biotechnology, University of Reading).

availability, and cost of credit, while fiscal policy deals with government expenditures, taxes, and debt. Through management of these areas, the Ministry of Finance regulated the allocation of resources in the economy, affected the distribution of income and wealth among the citizenry, stabilized the level of economic activities, and promoted economic growth and welfare. The Ministry of Finance played an important role in Japan's postwar economic growth. It advocated a \\"growth first\\" approach, with a high proportion of government spending going to capital accumulation, and minimum government spending overall, which kept both taxes and deficit spending down, making more money available for private investment. Most Japanese put money into savings accounts, mostly postal savings. Budget process The Budget Bureau of the Ministry of Finance is at the heart of the political process because it draws up the national budget each year. This responsibility makes it the ultimate focus of interest groups and of other ministries that compete for limited funds. The budgetary process generally begins soon after the start of a new fiscal year on April 1. Ministries and government agencies prepare budget requests in consultation with the Policy Research Council. In the fall of each year, Budget Bureau examiners reviews these requests in great detail, while top Ministry of Finance officials work out the general contours of the new budget and the distribution of tax revenues. During the winter, after the release of the ministry's draft budget, campaigning by individual Diet members for their constituents and different ministries for revisions and supplementary allocations becomes intense. The coalition leaders and Ministry of Finance officials consult on a final draft budget, which is generally passed by the Diet in late winter. In broad outline, the process reveals a basic characteristic of Japanese political dynamics: that despite the oft-stated ideals of \\"harmony\\" and \\"consensus,\\" interests, including bureaucratic interests, are in strong competition for resources. Political leaders and Budget Bureau officials need great skill to reach mutually acceptable compromises. The image of \\"Japan Incorporated,\\" in which harmony and unanimity are virtually automatic, belies the reality of intense rivalry. The late- twentieth-century system is successful insofar as political skills and appreciation of common interests minimize antagonisms and maintain a balance of power among groups. It is unclear, however, whether this system will continue as Japan faces such problems as growing social inequality and an aging society.

The species should not be confused with rocambole garlic, which is A. sativum var. ophioscorodon. Description The sand leek is a perennial plant with an egg-shaped bulb. The plant produces two to five unstalked leaves, the bases of which are sheath-like. Each leaf blade is linear, 7‚Äì20 mm wide, flat with a slight keel, an entire margin and parallel veins. The edges of the leaf and the central vein are rough to the touch. The flowering stem is cylindrical, growing to a height of and the upper half is leafless. The whole plant has an onion-like aroma. The inflorescence is a globular cluster surrounded by membranous bracts in bud which wither when the flowers open. Each individual flower is stalked and has a purple perianth long. There are six tepals, six stamens and a pistil formed from three fused carpels. Mixed with the flowers are a number of purple bulbils. The fruit is a capsule, but the seeds seldom set, and propagation usually takes place when the bulbils are knocked off and grow into new plants. Habitat The natural habitat of A. scorodoprasum is damp broad-leaved woodland, forest margins, shores, hillside meadows and hedgerows. It was at one time used as a kitchen herb and can sometimes be found near old habitations. Cultivation A. scorodoprasum is edible but seldom cultivated, and has a shorter flower stalk and fewer and more inconsistently shaped cloves than Rocambole garlic. Sand leek also has a dark violet bulb wrapper.Growing Great Garlic, 2nd Edition, Filaree Productions, 1992, p. 7.

Florenskiƒ≠, Florenskii, Florenskij; ; ‚Äì December 1937) was a Russian Orthodox theologian, priest, philosopher, mathematician, physicist, electrical engineer, inventor, polymath and neomartyr.Flight from Eden Biography =Early life= Pavel Aleksandrovich Florensky was born on in Yevlakh, Elisabethpol Governorate, into the family of a railroad engineer, Aleksandr Florensky, in the town of Yevlakh in Elisabethpol Governorate (in present-day western Azerbaijan). His father came from a family of Russian Orthodox priests while his mother Olga (Salomia) Saparova (Saparyan, Sapharashvili) was of the Tbilisi Armenian nobility in Georgia.Natalino Valentini, (ed.) Pavel Florenskij, La colonna e il fondamento della verit√†, San Paolo editore, 2010, p. lxxi.

Florensky completed his high school studies (1893-1899) at the Tbilisi classical lyceum, where several companions were later to distinguish themselves, among them the founder of Russian Cubo-Futurism, David Burliuk. In 1899, Florensky underwent a religious crisis, connected to a visit to Leo Tolstoy caused by an awareness of the limits and relativity of the scientific positivism and rationality which had been an integral part of his initial formation within his family and high school. He decided to construct his own solution by developing theories that would reconcile the spiritual and the scientific visions on the basis of mathematics. He entered the department of mathematics of Moscow State University and studied under Nikolai Bugaev, and became friends with his son, the future poet and theorist of Russian symbolism, Andrei Bely. He was particularly drawn to Georg Cantor's set theory. He also took courses on ancient philosophy. During this period the young Florensky, who had no religious upbringing, began taking an interest in studies beyond \\"the limitations of physical knowledge\\"Salt of the Earth by St. Paul Florensky In 1904 he graduated from the Moscow State University and declined a teaching position at the university: instead, he proceeded to study theology at the Ecclesiastical Academy in Sergiyev Posad. During his theological studies there, he came into contact with Elder Isidore on a visit to Gethsemane Hermitage, and Isidore was to become his spiritual guide and father. Together with fellow students Ern, Svenitsky and Brikhnichev he founded a society, the Christian Struggle Union (–°–æ—é–∑ –•—Ä–∏—Å—Ç–∏a–Ω—Å–∫–æ–π –ë–æ—Ä—å–±—ã), with the revolutionary aim of rebuilding Russian society according to the principles of Vladimir Solovyov. Subsequently he was arrested for membership in this society in 1906: however, he later lost his interest in the Radical Christianity movement. =Intellectual interests= Father Pavel Florensky During his studies at the Ecclesiastical Academy, Florensky's interests included philosophy, religion, art and folklore. He became a prominent member of the Russian Symbolism movement, together with his friend Andrei Bely and published works in the magazines New Way (–ù–æ–≤—ã–π –ü—É—Ç—å) and Libra (–í–µ—Å—ã). He also started his main philosophical work, The Pillar and Ground of the Truth: an Essay in Orthodox Theodicy in Twelve Letters. The complete book was published only in 1914 but most of it was finished at the time of his graduation from the academy in 1908. According to Princeton University Press: \\"The book is a series of twelve letters to a 'brother' or 'friend,' who may be understood symbolically as Christ. Central to Florensky's work is an exploration of the various meanings of Christian love, which is viewed as a combination of philia (friendship) and agape (universal love). He describes the ancient Christian rites of the adelphopoiesis (brother-making), which joins male friends in chaste bonds of love. In addition, Florensky was one of the first thinkers in the twentieth century to develop the idea of the Divine Sophia, who has become one of the central concerns of feminist theologians.\\" Recent research by Michael Hagemeister, known mostly for his work on The Protocols of the Elders of Zion, has authenticated that antisemitic material, written under a pseudonym, is in Florensky's hand. Florensky's biographer Avril Pyman evaluates Florensky's position regarding Jews as, contextually for the period, a middle way between liberal critics who excoriated at the time of the incident Russia's backwardness and the behaviour of instigators of pogroms like the Black Hundreds. After graduating from the academy, he married Anna Giatsintova, the sister of a friend, in August 1910, a move which shocked his friends who were familiar with his aversion to marriage.Avril Pyman,Pavel Florensky: A Quiet Genius: The Tragic and Extraordinary Life of Russia's Unknown da Vinci,Continuum International Publishing Group, 2010 p.86. He continued to teach philosophy and lived at Troitse-Sergiyeva Lavra until 1919. In 1911 he was ordained into the priesthood. In 1914 he wrote his dissertation, About Spiritual Truth. He published works on philosophy, theology, art theory, mathematics and electrodynamics. Between 1911 and 1917 he was the chief editor of the most authoritative Orthodox theological publication of that time, Bogoslovskiy Vestnik. He was also a spiritual teacher of the controversial Russian writer Vasily Rozanov, urging him to reconcile with the Orthodox Church. =Period of Communist rule in Russia= After the October Revolution he formulated his position as: \\"I have developed my own philosophical and scientific worldview, which, though it contradicts the vulgar interpretation of communism... does not prevent me from honestly working in the service of the state.\\" After the Bolsheviks closed the Troitse- Sergiyeva Lavra (1918) and the Sergievo-Posad Church (1921), where he was the priest, he moved to Moscow to work on the State Plan for Electrification of Russia (–ì–û–≠–õ–†–û) under the recommendation of Leon Trotsky who strongly believed in Florensky's ability to help the government in the electrification of rural Russia. According to contemporaries, Florensky in his priest's cassock, working alongside other leaders of a Government department, was a remarkable sight. In 1924, he published a large monograph on dielectrics. He worked simultaneously as the Scientific Secretary of the Historical Commission on Troitse-Sergiyeva Lavra and published his works on ancient Russian art. He was rumoured to be the main organizer of a secret endeavour to save the relics of St. Sergii Radonezhsky whose destruction had been ordered by the government. In the second half of the 1920s, he mostly worked on physics and electrodynamics, eventually publishing his paper Imaginary numbers in Geometry (¬´–ú–Ω–∏–º–æ—Å—Ç–∏ –≤ –≥–µ–æ–º–µ—Ç—Ä–∏–∏. –†–∞—Å—à–∏—Ä–µ–Ω–∏–µ –æ–±–ª–∞—Å—Ç–∏ –¥–≤—É—Ö–º–µ—Ä–Ω—ã—Ö –æ–±—Ä–∞–∑–æ–≤ –≥–µ–æ–º–µ—Ç—Ä–∏–∏¬ª) devoted to the geometrical interpretation of Albert Einstein's theory of relativity. Among other things, he proclaimed that the geometry of imaginary numbers predicted by the theory of relativity for a body moving faster than light is the geometry of the Kingdom of God. For mentioning the Kingdom of God in that work, he was accused of anti-Soviet agitation and propaganda by Soviet authorities. =1928‚Äì1937: exile, imprisonment, death= Pavel Florensky in 1934 In 1928, Florensky was exiled to Nizhny Novgorod. After the intercession of Ekaterina Peshkova (wife of Maxim Gorky), Florensky was allowed to return to Moscow. On 26 February 1933 he was arrested again, on suspicion of engaging in a conspiracy with Pavel Gidiulianov, a professor of canon law who was a complete stranger to Florensky, to overthrow the state and install, with Nazi assistance, a fascist monarchy.Avril Pyman, pp. 154ff. He defended himself vigorously against the imputations until he realized that by showing a willingness to admit them, though false, he would enable several acquaintances to resecure their liberty. He was sentenced to ten years in the labor camps by the infamous Article 58 of Joseph Stalin's criminal code (clauses ten and eleven: \\"agitation against the Soviet system\\" and \\"publishing agitation materials against the Soviet system\\"). The published agitation materials were the monograph about the theory of relativity. His manner of continuing to wear priestly garb annoyed his employers. The state offered him numerous opportunities to go into exile in Paris, but he declined them. He served at the Baikal Amur Mainline camp until 1934 when he was moved to Solovki, where he conducted research into producing iodine and agar out of the local seaweed. In 1937 he was transferred to Saint Petersburg (then known as Leningrad) where, on 25 November, he was sentenced by an extrajudicial NKVD troika to death. According to a legend he was sentenced for the refusal to disclose the location of the head of St. Sergii Radonezhsky that the communists wanted to destroy. The saint's head was indeed saved and in 1946 the Troitse-Sergiyeva Lavra was opened again. The relics of St. Sergii became fashionable once more. The saint's relics were returned to Lavra by Pavel Golubtsov, later known as Archbishop Sergiy. After sentencing, Florensky was transported in a special train together with another 500 prisoners to a location near St. Petersburg, where he was shot dead on the night of 8 December 1937 in a wood not far from the city. The site of his burial is unknown. Antonio Maccioni states that he was shot at the Rzhevsky Artillery Range, near Toksovo, which is located about twenty kilometers northeast of Saint Petersburg and was buried in a secret grave in Koirangakangas near Toksovo together with 30,000 others who were executed by the NKVD at the same time.Antonio Maccioni, \\"Pavel Aleksandroviƒç Florenskij. Note in margine all'ultima ricezione italiana\\", eSamizdat, 2007, V (1-2), pp. 471-478 In 1997, a mass burial ditch was excavated in the Sandarmokh forest, which may well contain his remains. His name was registered in 1982 among the list of New Martyrs and Confessors.Natalino Valentini. Pavel A. Florenskij, San Paolo editore, Milan 2010 p.lxxxii. =Influence= Florensky, often read for his contributions to the religious renaissance of his time or scientific thinking, came to be studied in a broader perspective in the 1960s, a change associated with the revival of interest in neglected aspects of his oeuvre shown by the Tartu school of semiotics, which evaluated his works in terms of their anticipation of themes that formed part of the theoretical avant-garde's interests in a general theory of cultural signs at that time. Read in this light, the evidence that Florensky's thinking actively responded to the art of the Russian modernists. Of particular importance in this regard was their publication of his 1919 essay, delivered as a lecture the following year, on spatial organization in the Russian icon tradition, entitled \\"Reverse Perspective\\",Pavel Florensky (Nicoletta Misler ed.), Beyond Vision: Essays on the Perception of Art, Reaktion Books 2006 pp.197-272 a concept which Florensky, like Erwin Panofsky later, picked up from Oskar Wulff's 1907 essay, 'Die umgekehrte Perspective und die Niedersicht.Marcus Plested, Orthodox Readings of Aquinas, Oxford University Press 2012 p.9 and n.1. Here Florensky contrasted the dominant concept of spatiality in Renaissance art analysing the visual conventions employed in the iconological tradition. This work has remained since its publication a seminal text in this area down to the present day. In that essay,Clemena Antonova, 'Changing prceptions of Pavel Florensky in Russian and Soviet Scholarship,' in Costica Bradatan, Serguei Oushakine (eds.) In Marx's Shadow: Knowledge, Power, and Intellectuals in Eastern Europe and Russia, Lexington Books, 2010 pp.73-94 pp.80, 82-83 his interpretation has recently been developed and reformulated critically by Clemena Antonova, who argues rather that what Florensky analysed is better described in terms of \\"simultaneous planes\\".Clemena Antonova, Space, Time, and Presence in the Icon: Seeing the World with the Eyes of God, Routledge, 2016 p.169.Matthew J.

The rate of cleavage is 30 times greater at the 5' side of A or T than at G or C and results in the production of mononucleotides and oligonucleotides with terminal 3'-phosphates. The enzyme is also active against double-stranded DNA and RNA and all sequences will be ultimately cleaved. Characteristics The enzyme has a molecular weight of 16.9kDa. The pH optimum is reported as 9.2. The enzyme activity is strictly dependent on Ca2+ and the pH optimum varies according to Ca2+ concentration. The enzyme is therefore easily inactivated by EGTA. Sources This enzyme is the extracellular nuclease of Staphylococcus aureus. Two strains, V8 and Foggi, yield almost identical enzymes.

Release Although the band did release the song as a single and filmed a video for it (featuring the band members performing the song on a boat, with a cameo appearance by Kirk Hammett of Metallica, who has been a close friend of Claypool since they attended the same school), the single had very limited success due to its being released on an indie label, and the band did not receive mainstream attention until their next single, \\"Jerry Was a Race Car Driver\\", from their 1991 major label debut Sailing the Seas of Cheese.

It was followed by Coelebs Married in 1814. It is sometimes known by the title Coelebs in Search of a Wife: Commprehending Observations on Domestic Habits and Manners, Religion and Morals. The novel focuses on C≈ìlebs, a well-to-do young man who tries to find a wife who can meet the lofty moral requirements laid down by his (now deceased) mother. Coelebs in Search of a Wife was extremely popular when it was published. It combined its novelistic narrative with religious lessons, which helped it to become the first nineteenth century novel to be accepted enthusiastically by the large religious reading public (in Britain, the novel had often been seen as an unrespectable and even immoral literary form).

Much of the unit was drawn from the 12th York Regiment, the Rangers, with men coming from ten other militia regiments ‚Äì of which four still exist. The unit fought in France and Flanders as part of the 4th Infantry brigade, 2nd Canadian Division. Notable actions include the Somme, Vimy Ridge, Hill 70, Passchendaele, Amiens, the advance along the Scarpe, Canal du Nord, Canal de le Escault and the advance to Mons in the Last Hundred Days. The battalion was disbanded in 1920. The 20th Battalion (Central Ontario), CEF, is perpetuated by The Queen's York Rangers (1st American Regiment) (RCAC). Casualties All together, 4,310 officers and men served in the 20th Battalion during the war. Of them, 843 were killed in action or died of wounds (19.6%) ‚Äì often having been wounded earlier. Another 1,855 (43%) were wounded, often repeatedly. 91 died of disease or accidentally.

NPs are trained to assess patient needs, order and interpret diagnostic and laboratory tests, diagnose disease, formulate and prescribe treatment plans. NP training covers basic disease prevention, coordination of care, and health promotion, but does not provide the depth of expertise needed to recognize more complex conditions. According to the American Association of Nurse Practitioners, an organization that aggressively lobbies for the expansion of the scope of practice of NPs, NPs are educated at the graduate level to provide \\"primary, acute, chronic, and specialty care to patients of all ages\\", depending on their field of practice. The scope of practice for a NP is defined by legal jurisdiction. In some places, NPs are required to work under the supervision of a physician, and in other places they can practice independently. History =United States= The present day concept of advanced practice nursing as a primary care provider was created in the mid-1960s, spurred on by a national shortage of physicians. The first formal graduate certificate program for NPs was created by Henry Silver, a physician, and Loretta Ford, a nurse, in 1965. In 1971, The U.S. Secretary of Health, Education and Welfare, Elliot Richardson, made a formal recommendation in expanding the scope of nursing practice to be able to serve as primary care providers. In 2012, discussions have risen between accreditation agencies, national certifying bodies, and state boards of nursing about the possibility of making the Doctorate of Nursing Practice (DNP) as the new minimum standard of education for NP certification and licensure by 2015. =Canada= Advanced practice nursing first appeared in the 1990s in Ontario. These nurses practiced in neonatal intensive care units within tertiary care hospitals in collaboration with pediatricians and neonatologists. Although the role of these nurses initially resembled a blended version of clinical nurse specialists and NPs, today the distinction has been more formally established. United States =Education requirements= Becoming a Nurse Practitioner (NP) does not always require experience as a registered nurse in addition to a graduate degree. NP's are required to be licensed Registered Nurses prior to obtaining their APRN certification. To become an NP requires between 1.5 and 3 years of post- baccalaureate training, in addition to prior training and experience as an RN, though there are alternate routes to training. There are many types of nurse practitioner programs in the United States with the vast majority being in the specialty of a Family Nurse Practitioner (FNP).. American Association of Nurse Practitioners. Retrieved May 5, 2020/ There are also Psychiatric, Adult Geriatric Acute Care, Adult Geriatric Primary Care, Pediatric, and Neonatal nurse practitioner programs. Many of these programs have their pre-clinical or didactic courses taught online with proctored examinations. Once the students start their clinical courses they have online material, but are required to perform clinical hours at an approved facility under the guidance of an NP or Physician. Each clinical course has specific requirements that vary on their program's degree/ eligibility for certification. For instance FNP's are required to see patients across the lifespan; where as Adult Geriatric NP's do not see anyone below the Age of 13.. Nurse Journal. Retrieved May 5, 2020. The amount and quality of education required to be an NP has been the subject of controversy in the United States. Opponents of independent practice have argued that NP education can consist of online coursework with few hours of actual patient contact. To become an NP requires between 1.5 and 3 years of post-baccalaureate training, in addition to prior training and experience as an RN, though there are alternate routes to training. A new nurse practitioner may have between 500 and 1,000 hours of clinical training.Compare the Education Gaps Between Primary Care Physicians and Nurse Practitioners. Primary Care Coalition. Retrieved August 10, 2019. The quality of education and of applicants for NP schools has been cited as a reason to not allow NPs to practice medicine autonomously. Some graduate nursing schools have 100% acceptance rates.https://www.usnews.com/education/best-graduate-schools/the- short-list-grad-school/articles/2016-08-16/10-graduate-nursing-programs-with- the-highest-acceptance-rates =Quality of care= A review of studies comparing outcomes of care by NPs and by physicians in primary care, urgent care, and anesthesia conducted by the Department of Veteran Affairs found that outcomes in the assessed studies were generally comparable. One systematic review states that utilization of NPs under physician supervision may improve access to care in emergency and critical care settings. Scope of practice =United States= Because the profession is state-regulated, the scope of practice varies by state. Some states allow NPs to have full practice authority, however, in other states, a written collaborative or supervisory agreement with a physician is legally required for practice. Autonomous practice was introduced in the 1980s, mostly in states facing a physician shortage or that struggled to find enough healthcare providers to work in rural areas. The extent of this collaborative agreement, and the role, duties, responsibilities, nursing treatments, and pharmacologic recommendations again varies widely between states. NPs can legally examine patients, diagnose illness, prescribe some medications, and provide treatments. In 2017, twenty- two states gave full practice authority to NPs and do not require the supervision of a physician. Thirty-eight states require NPs to have a written agreement with a physician in order to provide care. Twelve of those states require NPs to be supervised or delegated by a physician, this physician may not be on site. = Canada = In Canada, an NP is a registered nurse (RN) with a graduate degree in nursing. Canada recognizes them in primary care and acute care practice. NPs diagnose illnesses and medical conditions, prescribe Schedule 1 medications, order and interpret diagnostic tests, and perform procedures, within their scope of practice, and may build their own panel of patients at the same level as physicians. Primary care NPs work in places like primary care and community healthcare centers, as well as long-term care institutions. The main focus of primary care NPs includes health promotion, preventative care, diagnosis and treatment of acute and chronic diseases and conditions. Acute care NPs serve a specific population of patients. They generally work in in-patient facilities that include neonatology, nephrology, and cardiology units. There are currently three specialties for Nurse Practitioners in Canada: Family Practice, Pediatrics, and Adult Care. NPs who specialize in Family Practice work at the same level and offer the same services as Family Physicians with the exclusion of Quebec, where only Physicians are allowed to formulate a medical diagnosis. =United Kingdom= In the United Kingdom nurse practitioners carry out care at an advanced practice level. They often perform roles similar to those of doctors. They commonly work in primary care (e.g. GP surgeries) or A&E; departments, although they are increasingly being seen in other areas of practice. Licensing and board certification =United States= The path to becoming an NP in the U.S. begins by earning an undergraduate degree in nursing and requires licensure and experience as an RN. One must then complete graduate or doctoral studies with additional medical training before taking national board certification testing in their specialty field. = Australia = In Australia, RNs who have the equivalent of three years of full-time experience (5000 hours) and have completed a program of study approved by the Nursing and Midwifery Board of Australia (a postgraduate nursing master's degree including advanced health assessment, pharmacology for prescribing, therapeutics and diagnostics and research), or a program that is substantially equivalent to an approved program of study, may apply to the Nursing and Midwifery Board of Australia for endorsement as a Nurse Practitioner. The Australian professional organisation is the Australian College of Nurse Practitioners (ACNP). = Canada = In Canada, the educational standard is a graduate degree in nursing. The Canadian Nursing Association (CNA) notes that advanced practice nurses must have a combination of a graduate level education and the clinical experience that prepare them to practice at an advanced level. Their education alone does not give them the ability to practice at an advanced level. Two national frameworks have been developed in order to provide further guidance for the development of educational courses and requirements, research concepts, and government position statements regarding advanced practice nursing: the CNA's Advanced Nursing Practice: A National Framework and the Canadian Nurse Practitioner Core Competency Framework. All educational programs for NPs must achieve formal approval by provincial and territorial regulating nurse agencies due to the fact that the NP is considered a legislated role in Canada. As such, it is common to see differences among approved educational programs between territories and provinces. Specifically, inconsistencies can be found in core graduate courses, clinical experiences, and length of programs. Canada does not have a national curriculum or consistent standards regarding advanced practice nurses. All advanced practice nurses must meet individual requirements set by their provincial or territorial regulatory nursing body. = Israel = As of November 2013, NPs were recognized legally in Israel. Salary The salary of an NP generally depends on the area of specialization, location, years of experience, and level of education. In 2015, the American Association of Nurse Practitioners (AANP) conducted its 4th annual NP salary survey. The results revealed the salary range to be between $98,760 to $108,643 reported income among full-time NPs. According to the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics, NPs in the top 10% earned an average salary of $135,800. The median salary was $98,190. According to a report published by Merritt Hawkins, starting salaries for NPs increased in dramatic fashion between 2015 and 2016. The highest average starting salary reached $197,000 in 2016. The primary factor in the dramatic increase in starting salaries is skyrocketing demand for NPs, recognizing them as the 5th most highly sought after advanced health professional in 2016.

It produces very fine and valuable timber which was formerly much sought after to make furniture. Due to over-exploitation it is now a protected species. Other names for it are Cape Walnut, Red List of South African Plants Cape laurel, and laurel wood. The name \\"stinkwood\\" comes from a strong smell that is released when it is fresh felled. Description Giant stinkwood tree in indigenous afrotemperate forest, South Africa. It is a large, evergreen tree, that grows up to 30 m tall. The leaves are dark green and glossy, with bubbles (bullae) produced on the upper surface of the leaves, hence the specific name bullata. The flowers are often dioecious. Distribution This tree is indigenous to the high forests of South Africa, from Table Mountain in the south, to the afro-montane forests of Limpopo in the north. It has been effectively exterminated on the slopes of Table Mountain where it has been felled for timber and replaced by invasive pine plantations. It is also frequently and fatally stripped of its bark, which is taken for use in traditional medicine. Consequently, it is now a Protected Tree in South Africa. Uses The tree yields a beautiful timber much prized by cabinet- makers. The wood is dark walnut or reddish brown to black with a yellow sap- wood, and the grain extremely fine, close, dense and smooth. It is said to be as durable as teak. The tree is badly overexploited and the wood is no longer available commercially. It is one of the most popular plants traded for traditional medicine in South Africa, mainly for its perceived effectiveness in treating urinary diseases. Cultivation Ocotea bullata can be a very impressive tree for a larger garden or park. Care must be taken with their planting and they prefer a shady position but, once established, they are quite fast growing. Stinkwood trees can be propagated with some difficulty from cuttings. It can also be grown from seed, which must be freshly picked, cleaned and planted immediately. Germination takes around 30 days. Pests and diseases Ocotea bullata can be attacked by the fungus-like pathogen Phytophthora cinnamomi, which causes dieback. Trees are more prone to attack in areas of indigenous forest that have been disturbed for commercial purposes.

Originally titled Twisted Mego Theatre, it predominantly featured scale action figures made by the Mego Corporation (a line very popular in the 1970s, during the childhood years of much of the magazine's staff), and principally those based on Marvel Comics characters, such as Spider-Man (\\"Mego Spidey\\") and the Incredible Hulk. The artwork was done in the fumetti style by photographing toys on sets built by the magazine's staff, and using Photoshop to add effects and word balloons. The series was known for its bizarre humor and pop-culture references.  Publication history  Twisted Mego Theatre debuted in ToyFare's 1996 Winter Special. The strip ended when ToyFare published its final issue in January 2011.Melrose, Kevin (January 24, 2011). \\"Breaking: Wizard and ToyFare magazines fold\\". Comic Book Resources. Plot and characters Collectively, the strips take place in a fictional world called Megoville.Thomas, Jr., Dr. Ronald C. \\"Playing with Themselves: Robot Chicken and 'Twisted Toyfare Theatre,'\\" The New York Review of Science Fiction (Oct. 2010), pp. 17-19. Mego toys based on other properties, such as television shows like CHiPs, Star Trek, and The Dukes of Hazzard make frequent appearances alongside the Marvel characters. Originally, Mego toys based on DC Comics characters also appeared, but legal issues led to their removal. Reprints of strips featuring DC characters were edited so that other characters appeared in their place. The broad scope of Twisted ToyFare Theatre called for the appearance of characters/figures never officially released by Mego. This led the strip's creators to commission customized figures for those characters, or to do their best with existing figures, the latter case resulting in such \\"customized\\" characters as \\"John Denver\\" (actually a Bo Duke Mego figure wearing glasses) or Iceman's \\"Snowman\\" incarnation represented as a Mego figure covered in modeling clay and rolled in shredded coconut. Additionally, a large variety of other toy lines were featured, either independently, or alongside the Megoville characters. These lines included Star Wars, Smurfs, Transformers, G.I. Joe, Masters of the Universe, Gobots, and a host of others. The Marvel Mego characters also met their \\"evil twins\\" twice, in the form of the other toy lines based on Marvel characters, such as Marvel Legends. While Twisted ToyFare Theatre features toys based on pre-existing characters, their personalities were usually caricatures of the original; writer Doug Goldstein said a favorite technique of his was to take some facet of their personality and twist it just slightly, making it ludicrous while still being true to the character: *Spider-Man (referred to as \\"Mego Spidey\\" by fans and ToyFare staffers) ‚Äî often acts as the central character. Sarcastic and slightly self- centered, he remains aloof of the troubles of others and usually wants nothing to do with whatever craziness is affecting everyone else (in stark contrast to the real character's motto of ‚Äúwith great power comes great responsibility‚Äù). *The Hulk ‚Äî Mego Spidey's dim-witted and childlike constant companion (much to Mego Spidey's annoyance and disgust) and is usually a source of scatological humor. During the Megoville Civil War, the Hulk is launched into space by Iron Man in exchange for Mego Spidey siding with the pro-prohibition heroes. In a parody of the \\"Planet Hulk\\" storyline, it was revealed in the July 2008 issue that the Hulk becomes king of the world he lands on, but returns to Earth after his newfound wife is killed in an explosion (which he causes by placing metal in the spaceship's microwave). *Aunt May ‚Äî a senile and slightly overbearing old woman who refuses to die (much to Mego Spidey's eternal chagrin). *Bucky ‚Äî Captain America's sidekick/errand boy. Most of Megoville considers him nothing short of a loser and joke. After Cap dies, Nick Fury teaches Bucky to be a gritty anti-hero, despite his incredible ineptness, to the point that even the Megoville villains consider him to be not so much of a twerp. *George W. Bush ‚Äî the mayor of Megoville. *Captain America ‚Äî presented as a nationalistic, slightly bigoted man out of touch with the current generation. Following the real Cap's death in Marvel Comics, Mego Cap is accidentally killed by the Red Skull, Mysterio, Electro, and the Lizard during a drunken binge. However, he appears alive and well two issues later, albeit without an explanation for his resurrection. *Captain Kirk ‚Äî an unrepentant womanizer whose shirt keeps disappearing and reappearing. *Cobra Commander ‚Äî of G.I. Joe fame, seems to have set up a secondary headquarters in Spider- Man's house, much to Spider-Man's frustration and annoyance. He has a regular Wednesday night game of Risk with Gargamel, Megatron and Skeletor and is a comically inept leader to the point that the other members of Cobra like to draw mustaches on his faceplate while he is sleeping. In an early 2008 issue, Cobra Commander joins G.I Joe after losing control of Cobra to Dr. Mindbender's fast food mogul/world conqueror clone BurgerMeister, and changes his name to Private Commander. Predictably, his ineptness causes the Joes more harm than when he was their opponent and Duke sends him to go undercover with the Decepticons in order to get rid of him. *Conan the Barbarian ‚Äî a sometime companion of Mego Spidey. At times he fights to control his rage, but ultimately fails, with bloody results. *Daredevil ‚Äî a bungling blind man, with much humor coming from his blindness, and who has unknowingly revealed his identity many times. He also sues Ben Affleck after he \\"sees\\" Daredevil. His girlfriend Karen Page is a porn star. *The Defenders ‚Äî includes the Hulk, the Silver Surfer, Namor, and Dr. Strange; Megoville's most pathetic super-team, who are only called on for menial tasks like getting a cat out of a tree. *Doctor Doom ‚Äî a pompous megalomaniac who only speaks in the third person and is quick to yell \\"Curse you, Richards!\\" (in reference to Mr. Fantastic of the Fantastic Four) when his plans fail. He has launched the Baxter Building into space several times (so many that, at one point, he launches one into space and another falls on him). The word \\"accursed\\" is a trademark registered in his name. *Doctor Octopus is a glutton who is rarely seen not eating. He sometimes uses his tentacles to steal from vending machines. *The Gobots ‚Äî appear from time to time as the pathetic second-stringers of the Transformers. Usually posing as second-stringers to Transformer characters. Cy-kill is shunned from Cobra Commander's Wednesday night game of Risk. *The Green Goblin ‚Äî working with the publicity and success of the Spider-Man movie, becomes a rich rap artist referring to himself as 'Griz-een Griz-oblin', and performs with his Green Goblin mask on over more traditional rap attire. *Iron Man ‚Äî a comical drunk, rarely seen sober, a parody of the fact that the real character is a recovering alcoholic. However, after going to rehab and recovering, he attempts to reinstate Prohibition, which causes a \\"Civil War\\" to break out, with most of Megoville joining Cap's \\"Secretly Drunk Avengers\\". Iron Man returns to his usual drunk self, however, after Hawkeye shoots him with a \\"booze arrow\\". *Alan Moore ‚Äî appears several times in the comic (with a great exaggeration of his hair). Several times he corrects others for mistaking the Man-Thing for the Swamp Thing. On few occasions he states his displeasure about the possibility of writing Watchmen 2. *Northstar ‚Äî Marvel character well known for being an outed homosexual; usually the target of stereotypical gay jokes. A recurring theme has the X-Man Banshee berating Northstar for being a \\"poofter\\" (a slang term for a homosexual), or taking advantage of Daredevil's blindness by trying to make out with him. *Reed Richards ‚Äî an egotistical supergenius who does not understand the physical and emotional cost of his work. He is also something of an ass, which seems appropriate for one who calls himself \\"Mr. Fantastic\\". *Sue Richards ‚Äî frequently intimated to be sexually promiscuous and has presumably cheated on her husband (Mr. Fantastic) on many occasions (although one Twisted ToyFare Theatre strip declares their original marriage illegal, prompting a new ceremony that ultimately is not completed). * Spock ‚Äî totally exasperated, sighs frequently, and realizes the futility of talking sense into Kirk. *The Thing ‚Äî the \\"bully\\" of the Fantastic Four and often plays pranks on other Megoville citizens, generally taking his responsibilities as a superhero far too lightly and often ignoring alert signals and cries for help. He is the constant (albeit usually unknowing) tormentor of a lone creature living in the Negative Zone. *Thor ‚Äî frequently appears alongside Mego Spidey and the Hulk in the early strips, but later virtually vanishes from the series (the reasons for which is the focus of a later strip).

DC Comics controversy Many early Twisted ToyFare Theatre strips featured several DC Comics characters, though an early strip entitled \\"The Super-Friends\\" featured Spider-man insulting the DC heroes for their ridiculousness. DC later filed a cease and desist order, preventing Twisted ToyFare Theatre from ever using DC characters. However, Twisted ToyFare Theatre writers not-so-subtly poked fun at this with rare appearances of \\"Bat-Pumpkin\\", a Batman Mego figure with his costume re-colored to orange and purple and a pumpkin image replacing the Bat-symbol; even rarer were appearances of a similarly-altered Robin figure as Bat-Pumpkin's sidekick, \\"Squash\\". At other times, Marvel characters shushed DC references (\\"Ix-nay on the DC oke-jays!\\"), while in a Matrix parody, Mego Spidey encountered a \\"Crippled, web-savvy, redheaded secretary.\\" whom he mistakenly thought was the Oracle; she was quick to correct him by saying \\"Heavens, no! That would be too close to a DC Comics copyright infringement.\\" Collections The strips were reprinted by Wizard Entertainment, the publisher of ToyFare, in collections separate from the magazine. These contained additional content, including behind-the-scenes information on how the stories were written and photographed, and Official Handbook of the Marvel Universe-style biography pages about featured Twisted ToyFare Theatre characters. Wizard published 12 of these collections ‚Äî 11 regular collections and a special 10th-anniversary collection. Various toy-collecting celebrities provided introductions for the collected volumes, including Kevin Smith, Seth Green, Stan Lee, Paul Dini, Mark Hamill, Rob Van Dam, \\"Weird Al\\" Yankovic, Patton Oswalt, and Joe Quesada. Jeph Loeb provided the introduction for the Twisted ToyFare Theatre 10th Anniversary Collection. Robot Chicken connection  The television show Robot Chicken, which features animated action figures, sprung from Twisted ToyFare Theatre ‚Äî quite literally, as former writer Tom Root is head writer for the show, along with fellow Twisted ToyFare Theatre alumnus Matthew Senreich. Robot Chicken producer Seth Green is also an avid toy collector and was a long-time friend of the magazine.

Life Huan worked as an official under the administrations of Emperor Ai of Han (.27-1), Wang Mang (.9-23), the Gengshi Emperor (.23-25), and Emperor Guangwu of Han (.25-57). Huan was a close associate of the court astronomer and mathematician Liu Xin, as well as the author and poet Yang Xiong. Works In addition to his many rhapsodies, essays, and memorials, Huan's major work was the Xinlun or New Discussions, which was admired by Emperor Guangwu despite Huan Tan's besmirched reputation for having closely associated himself with the regime of the usurper Wang Mang. His Xinlun is also the earliest text to describe the trip hammer device powered by hydraulics (i.e., a waterwheel), which was used to pound and decorticate grain. Legacy Huan's mode of philosophical thought belonged to an Old Text realist tradition. He drew explicitly on Legalism in his writings on government, saying that in certain historical epochs harsher punishments are needed. He was supported by other contemporaries such as the naturalist and mechanistic philosopher Wang Chong (27-), the latter who Crespigny states was probably heavily influenced by Huan Tan.. Huan Tan is reported by Yu Yingshi (b. 1930) to uphold self-contradictory views on immortality. On one hand, he is quoted to say that \\"the way of immortals\\" is a fabrication of the lovers for the strange; on the other, however, he was reported to admit the practice as genuine and efficient. Possible explanation lies in the fact that the Xinlun was a later compilation which might have confused his own statements with the quotations of his opponents.

It is located in south-west England, in Stratton-on-the-Fosse, between Bath, Frome, Wells and Bruton, and is attached to Downside Abbey. Originally a school for English Catholic boys, it was established in 1617 by English and Welsh monks, living in exile at Douai, France. The monastic community returned to England in 1795, with both the community and its school initially housed in the Shropshire home of Sir Edward Smythe, a former pupil. By 1814, the abbey and school had been re-established at its present site, in Somerset. Downside School became fully co-educational in all year groups in 2005. The school Downside School Downside is run by lay staff and three members of the Benedictine community based at Downside Abbey. It has a board of governors consisting of a chairman and ten others. Of the latter, one is a member of the Benedictine community.\\"School Governors\\" Downside School. In 2019 the school and the abbey became separate trusts. The school is divided into six houses: five senior houses and one junior house, with both day pupils and boarders in the same houses. Each house takes its name from the community's martyrs or benefactors: * Powell House although in the senior school is a Junior House for all boys in Third Form before they join their senior house in Fourth Form. It is named after the Martyr Blessed Philip Powell, a monk of St Gregory's at Douai. * Barlow House (Boys) is situated on the south side of the main quad. It is named after the Martyr, Ambrose Barlow who was also a monk of St Gregory's at Douai. The house colours are black and white. * Caverel House (Girls) was formerly a boys' house but was re-furbished and changed to a girls' house following the admission of girls to Downside in September 2005. Caverel is named after the Benefactor, Abbot Philippe de Caverel. The house colours are green and white. * Isabella House (Girls) was founded in 2007 as a second girls' house in the senior school. The house is situated in a purpose-built building in the south-east of the school grounds. Isabella is named after a Benefactor, Infanta Isabella Clara Eugenia of Spain and Portugal. The house colours are gold and blue. * Roberts House (Boys) is situated in the north and west sides of the main quad. It is named after the martyr and monk of St. Gregory's in Douai, St. John Roberts. The house colours are red and white. * Smythe House (Boys) is situated in the east side of the main quad, and is named after the major benefactor, Sir Edward Smythe. The house colours are yellow and black. History Downside School Monks from the monastery of St Gregory's, Douai in Flanders, came to Downside in 1814. In 1607, St Gregory's was the first house after the Reformation to begin conventual life with a handful of exiled Englishmen. For nearly 200 years, St Gregory's trained monks for the English mission and six of those men were beatified by Pope Pius XI in 1929. Two of the monks, SS John Roberts and Ambrose Barlow, were among the Forty Martyrs of England and Wales canonised by Pope Paul VI in 1970. Imprisoned then driven from France, due to the Revolution, the community remained at Acton Burnell in Shropshire for 20 years before finally settling in Somerset in 1814. The Monastery was completed in 1876 and the Abbey Church in 1925, being raised to the rank of a minor basilica by Pius XI in 1935 . Attached to the Monastery, the school provides a Catholic boarding education for boys and girls between the ages of 11 and 18. During the 19th century, Downside remained a small monastic school. It was Dom Leander Ramsay who founded the modern Downside and planned the new buildings, designed by Leonard Stokes, that opened in 1912 and now form two sides of the \\"Quad\\". The 20th century brought about changes for Downside, with the expansion of the school buildings and the school population, numbering over 600 boys at one point. Over the decades, the number of pupils fell, but development drives and renewed demand for boarding education has seen student numbers rise. As part of the renewal, girls were admitted in 2004. Since the opening of Isabella House in 2007, approximately 60% of the pupils are boys and 40% are girls. Air crashes On Saturday 15 May 1943, during a cricket match between the school and an army team, two Hawker Hurricane fighter aircraft appeared over the playing fields at around 3 pm. They proceeded to circle the fields, performing manoeuvres as they did so, an eyewitness describing them \\"diving over the field and banking steeply\\". In what would be the final pass, at around 3:20 pm, both aircraft flew across the cricket ground at an extremely low altitude and climbed rapidly to clear the tall fir trees bordering the field. The second aircraft appeared to clip the trees with its tail and nose-dived straight into the ground, crashing and bouncing, the burning debris finally coming to rest amongst the schoolboys watching the cricket match from an embankment. The pilot and nine people on the ground were killed, with 15 others injured, ten of them seriously. In September 2013, a single-person aircraft crashed in the school grounds, causing the death of the pilot. Child abuse The school entrance Following investigation into the English Benedictine Congregation, including Ampleforth College and Downside School, amongst other institutions, the Independent Inquiry into Child Sexual Abuse (IICSA) published a report in August 2018. Ten individuals from the two schools, including monks, were convicted or accepted a caution for abuse. The report said that appalling abuse was inflicted on pupils over 40 years, but the schools tried to cover up the allegations. The chair of the inquiry, Prof. Alexis Jay, said that, for decades, the schools tried to avoid giving any information to police or authorities, with monks being \\"secretive, evasive and suspicious of anyone outside the English Benedictine Congregation\\", prioritising \\"the reputation of the Church and the wellbeing of the abusive monks\\" over safeguarding the interests of pupils. In 2001, after new procedures were introduced following the Nolan Report, which recommended that abuse should be referred to the statutory authorities, monks gave the appearance of co-operation and trust, but in reality continued to cover up the abuse. A 2018 statement on the school's website embraced the findings of the Social Care Institute of Excellence (SCIE) audit, completed in March 2018, and released a revised and stringent Child Protection Policy. Andrew Hobbs, formerly the acting head, and designated safeguarding lead during the audits and the Independent Inquiry into Child Sexual Abuse (IICSA), was appointed headmaster of Downside in September 2018.Downside School (2018). Independent Inquiry into Child Sexual Abuse (IICSA). Retrieved 4 September 2018. In May 2020, it was revealed that in the time following the release of the 2018 IICSA report regarding child sex abuse at Downside School, the school had experienced significant financial problems due to spiralling legal costs, and, to raise money, had been forced to sell some of its Renaissance-era paintings. Sports Members of the school compete in a range of sports, including rugby, football, netball, hockey, cricket, golf and tennis, and even the Downside Ball Game, a variation on Fives, played on a purpose-built outdoor court. Sports are played most afternoons, with every pupil expected to participate at least three times a week.Sporting Life Downside School =Cricket ground= The cricket pavilion The first recorded match on the school's cricket ground was in 1898, when the school played Lansdown.Other matches played on Downside School In 1934, the ground hosted a single first- class match between Somerset and Glamorgan.First-Class Matches played on Downside School In media In 2003, Downside was the setting for the Channel 4 television show, A Second Chance, in which Ryan Bell, a teenager from London, was sent to Downside to see if a \\"difficult\\" student would do better when educated in the independent sector.

The marque's badge was unusual in featuring a tortoise -- a pet tortoise walked into the frame of an inaugural photo-shoot, taken in the grounds of the makers. Because of the irony (the slowness of tortoises) the animal was chosen as the emblem. The Gordon-Keeble came about when John Gordon, formerly of the struggling Peerless company, and Jim Keeble got together in 1959 to make the Gordon GT car, initially by fitting a Chevrolet Corvette V8 engine, into a chassis by Peerless, for a USAF pilot named Nielsen. Impressed with the concept, a 4.6 litre Chevrolet (283 c.i.) V8 was fitted into a specially designed square-tube steel spaceframe chassis, with independent front suspension and all-round disc brakes. The complete chassis was then taken to Turin, Italy, where a body made of steel panels designed by Giorgetto Giugiaro was built by Bertone. The car's four five-inch headlights were in the rare, slightly angled \\"slanted\\" arrangement also used by a few other European marques, generally for high-speed cars such as Lagonda Rapide, Lancia Flaminia and Triumphs, as well as Rolls-Royce. The interior had an old luxury jet feel, with white on black gauges, toggle switches, and quilted aircraft PVC. Front ¬æ view Rear view The car appeared on the Bertone stand in March 1960, branded simply as a Gordon, at the Geneva Motor Show. At that time problems with component deliveries had delayed construction of the prototype, which had accordingly been built at breakneck speed by Bertone in precisely 27 days. After extensive road testing the car was shipped to Detroit and shown to Chevrolet management, who agreed to supply Corvette engines and gearboxes for a production run of the car. The car was readied for production with some alterations, the main ones being a larger 5.4-litre (327 c.i.) Chevrolet V8 engine and a change from steel to a glass fibre body made by Williams & Pritchard Limited. Problems with suppliers occurred and before many cars were made the money ran out and the company went into liquidation. About 90 cars had been sold at what turned out to be an unrealistic price of ¬£2798. Each car had two petrol tanks. In 1965 the company was bought by Harold Smith and Geoffrey West and was re-registered as Keeble Cars Ltd. Production resumed, but only for a short time, the last car of the main manufacturing run being made in 1966. A final example was actually produced in 1967 from spares, bringing the total made to exactly 100. The Gordon-Keeble Owners' Club claim that over 90 examples still exist. An attempt was made to restart production in 1968 when the rights to the car were bought by an American, John de Bruyne, but this came to nothing, although two cars badged as De Bruynes were shown at that year's New York Motor Show along with a new mid-engined coup√©.

Two different packaging editions were produced, a blue case and a red case. The blue case contains three cards featuring the lead voice actress from the game, Mariko K≈çda, alongside the characters she played, Mari Kousaka and Natsumi Kawai; the red case contains a photo booklet which also focuses on her. A PlayStation version of this title also exists, while there are no bonus packaging variants such as in the Saturn version, there are two releases, the difference being that one is on the Best of the Best label. During the game, the player takes on the role of Mari Kousaka, who was just hired as a DJ. There is then a choice of three out of four guests to interview: Aya Isokawa, a comedian (played by voice actress Aya Hisakawa); Nanacy Hiruma, an eccentric artist; Miyu Enjoji, and Kururi Shibasaki. Do well enough throughout these interviews by picking from multiple choice dialogues, and go on to interview superstar Natsumi Kawai. The ultimate goal is to convince her to sing a jingle for Mari's radio show. Summary The game is set up much like a dating sim. The main gameplay comes from multiple choice selections, and most endings involve whichever character the player held the strongest interview with. The Miyu Enjoji ending even includes a lingerie scene. As all of the guests are female, this could almost classify as a GxG sim, though the male manager and executive endings make this barely an all pairings title. 1997 video games Sega Saturn games PlayStation (console) games ","title":"Free Talk Studio"},{"id":"2849091","text":"Daiwa may refer to: Places: *Daiwa, Hiroshima, a former town in Kamo District, Hiroshima, Japan *Daiwa, Shimane, a former village in ≈åchi District, Shimane, Japan Companies and related: *Daiwa Securities Group, a Japanese security brokerage *Daiwa House, a Japanese homebuilder *Daiwa Cup, a Go competition *The Daiwa Anglo-Japanese Foundation, a United Kingdom-based charity *Daiwa Adrian Prize, awarded by the Daiwa Anglo-Japanese Foundation *Globeride (formerly Daiwa Seiko Corporation), a Japanese producer of fishing and outdoor equipment *Daiwa Major, a Thoroughbred racehorse ","title":"Daiwa"},{"id":"2849094","text":"State Route 109 (SR 109) is a short, unsigned state highway in the U.S. state of California.

Life and career L√∂be was born in Liegnitz (present-day Legnica) in the Prussian province of Silesia. The son of a carpenter, he had to work as a waiting-boy helping to support the family. Finishing school he was trained as a typesetter at a printing shop in Breslau (Wroc≈Çaw) and after his journeyman years worked in Dessau, Anhalt and Thuringian Ilmenau. To support his mother, he returned to Silesia in 1898, taking up a job at the Breslau Volkswacht newspaper. Shortly afterwards he was appointed editor-in-chief, a post he held until 1920. His journalistic work often landed him in prison, for instance, when he called on readers to come to a demonstration to protest against the Prussian three-class franchise. In 1901 he married Clara Schaller. L√∂be was dispensed from conscription in the German Army and did not serve in World War I on account of an illness in his lungs. During the Nazi years, L√∂be worked at the Walter de Gruyter academic publishing house. In the end of World War II L√∂be found himself in Glatz (K≈Çodzko), from where he was expelled according to the resolutions of the Potsdam Agreement. He joined the staff of the daily newspaper Das Volk, and later became co-publisher of the Telegraf in Berlin. He died in West Germany's capital, Bonn and is buried in an Ehrengrab at the Berlin-Zehlendorf cemetery. Politics L√∂be on his way to the Reichstag, October 1930 L√∂be joined the SPD in 1895 and in 1898 he founded the local branch of the SPD in Ilmenau. In 1899 he became party chairman in Middle Silesia and was elected to Breslau's city government in 1904. He served as a member of the Silesian provincial Landtag diet from 1915 to 1920. During World War I he together with Karl Liebknecht was known as a \\"leftist\\" opponent of SPD leader Friedrich Ebert and the party's Burgfrieden policies. Upon the German Revolution of 1918‚Äì1919 L√∂be declined to join the Council of the People's Deputies and the cabinet of his party fellow Chancellor Philipp Scheidemann. Instead he became vice president of the constituent Weimar National Assembly and from 1920 to 1933 he was a member of the German Reichstag, serving as its president (1920‚Äì24 and 1925‚Äì32) and vice-president (1932‚Äì33). In 1921 he became a member of the Prussian state council. L√∂be played a vital role in overcoming the divergences with the USPD deputies. Upon Ebert's death in 1925, he refused to run as SPD candidate in the presidential election against the conservative Paul von Hindenburg, a task then performed by the Prussian Minister-president Otto Braun, who was defeated in the first round. L√∂be was a member of the Reichsbanner Schwarz-Rot-Gold organization and briefly acted as SPD party chairman in early 1933 (after the Machtergreifung of the NS regime on 30 January 1933), preparing the Sopade exile in Prague, before the SPD was banned on 22 June. L√∂be was imprisoned by Nazi authorities on 23 June, and released at the end of 1933.http://www.fes.de: 22.06.1933: Faktisches Verbot der SPD After the 20 July 1944 Plot, he was arrested because of his connections with the resistance circle around Carl Friedrich Goerdeler. L√∂be was interrogated by the Gestapo and deported to Gross-Rosen concentration camp. The plotters had designated him for Reichstag President. After World War II, he was instrumental in the reconstruction of the SPD. L√∂be was a member of the Parlamentarischer Rat between 1948 and 1949 and the deputy chairman of the SPD faction. From 1949‚Äì53, he was a member of the West German Bundestag parliament in Bonn. L√∂be was the Father of the House during the first legislative period, though he was not an elected member, but rather appointed by the Senate of West Berlin as their non-voting delegate. The second oldest member was Chancellor Konrad Adenauer, whom L√∂be survived by three and a half months. Honorary positions Paul-L√∂be-Haus, Berlin From 1949 to 1954 L√∂be was President of the German Council of the European Movement and in 1954 he became President of the Kuratorium Unteilbares Deutschland. In 1951 L√∂be was awarded the Grand Cross of the Order of Merit of the Federal Republic of Germany. In 1955 he became an honorary citizen of Berlin. One of the new parliamentary buildings which serves Bundestag members in Berlin is named after L√∂be. Funeral Ceremony At the time of L√∂be's state funeral at the Rathaus Sch√∂neberg on 9 August 1967, Andreas Baader (the later Red Army Faction militant), the author Hans Magnus Enzensberger, and others in a satirical rally carried a coffin bearing the words \\"SENAT\\" to the front of the city hall. From inside the coffin, the Kommune 1 activist Dieter Kunzelmann, wearing a nightgown, and fellow demonstrators passed out leaflets proclaiming \\"Today you want to celebrate Paul L√∂be up the chimney [‚Ä¶] We want to bury a few smart corpses that are slowly stinking to high heaven\\", followed by a list of the current members of the Berlin Senate. Although 24 of the demonstrators were arrested, some participants evaded the police, including Baader, Enzensberger and another later RAF member, Gudrun Ensslin.Klaus Stern und J√∂rg Herrmann, Andreas Baader: Das Leben eines Staatsfeindes (Munich: dtv, 3rd ed. 2007), p. 86.

It contains many of the typical elements of a hearty and adventurous Shute yarn such as flying, the future, mystic states, and ordinary people doing extraordinary things. Plot summary The story is opened by its initial narrator - an Anglican priest in the Bush Brotherhood named Roger Hargreaves - who describes his ordinary circumstances in a large parish of the Australian outback in 1953. As part of his duties, he has to minister to the dying and this brings him into contact with an aged, alcoholic, opium-smoking, diseased, ex-pilot and ex-ringer named Stevie. Caught in Stevie's squalid cabin in a heavy rainy season, Hargreaves struggles with recurring malaria whilst on deathwatch for Stevie. As both men are in altered mental states the story shifts and Stevie becomes David 'Nigger' Anderson, a decorated member of the Royal Australian Air Force, telling his story to Hargreaves. But this is a story set 30 years in the future, in 1983. David Anderson is a quadroon, of mixed European and Aboriginal ancestry. As a first rate pilot he is chosen by his country to be a member of an elite test pilot team in the UK. Although of humble origins, Anderson has advanced quickly in the RAAF and is soon offered a position commanding one of two aircraft of the Queen's Flight. The England of the 1983 in the story is a technically advanced country that has been abused and bled dry by Socialism. Austerity is the watchword, and rationing is still in force. It is an England in which the Royal Family is revered by the common people, but abused by politicians who use them as whipping boys for the economic woes of England. When the politicians attempt indirectly to control the foreign travel of the monarch by curtailing her use of UK government aircraft, the Canadian and Australian governments each donate a modern jet transport to the Queen's Flight, provide for operating expenses, and furnish crews. Anderson is chosen as the captain of the Australian plane. Both Canada and Australia are heavily royalist countries, and Anderson is shocked at one point by the suggestion that Australia could become a republic. Both are democracies, though subject to the \\"multiple vote\\"‚Äîeveryone gets one vote, but other votes can be earned by individuals, up to a maximum of seven. Anderson himself has three votes in Australian elections. At first absorbed by the job, Anderson slowly becomes aware of what is going on around him. He sees the Secretary of State for Air, Lord Coles, inspect the advanced aircraft, and insist that a signal gun be placed in the radio-equipped aircraft in case it needs to land in a field. The Prime Minister, Iorweth Jones, is more intelligent, but only interested in scoring political points. The Royal family, though, is delighted at the gift of the aircraft, and the middle-aged Queen and Consort come down to inspect them. Anderson repeatedly meets, and slowly falls for, a junior secretary to the Queen, Rosemary, daughter of an Oxford don, who is assigned to help streamline the administrative aspects of the Commonwealth aircraft joining the Queen's Flight. Anderson learns of the difficult political situation the Queen is faced with. The Queen's visit to Canada in the Canadian craft coincides with another attack on the Royal Family by Labour politicians. The Prince of Wales has Anderson fly him to Ottawa so he can meet with the Queen. It is later made clear that the Prince carries an ultimatum from himself and his sister (the Queen has only two children)‚Äîthey will not take the job of monarch as it now stands. Anderson is ordered to fly the Queen and her entourage, including Rosemary, not back to England, but on to Australia to meet with politicians there. En route, they have a lengthy refueling delay on Christmas Island, allowing the Queen to relax a bit‚Äîuntil local officials show up with their wives, in formal dress. Anderson, struck with food poisoning, dreams of the scene with Hargreaves and Stevie in the cabin in the wet. After he recovers, the party move on to Australia. The Queen meets not only with current Australian politicians but with elder statesmen Sir Robert Menzies and Arthur Calwell (active politicians in real-life 1953). After the meetings the Queen is flown back to England, but ground control diverts the flight hundreds of miles to Yorkshire on the pretext that the well-qualified Australian airmen are not qualified to land at a commercial airport‚ÄîHeathrow‚Äîin poor weather; in reality the diversion to Yorkshire is apparently intended to inconvenience the Queen. After Royal intervention the crews are all granted accreditation as civil aviators without further ado. Anderson asks Rosemary to marry him, but she refuses so long as the Queen needs her. She arranges for Anderson to meet her father, a political scientist. Her father inadvertently reveals that the Queen is contemplating having a Governor General of Britain who will deal with the politicians, with the monarch devoted to Commonwealth affairs, to make the monarchy bearable for her and her family. The Queen announces this on her Christmas broadcast, and makes it clear that she and her family will not return to Britain without the country having undergone political reforms, meaning the multiple vote. Though David takes every precaution to protect the aircraft, which takes off with the Queen soon afterwards, a sixth sense, deriving from his Aboriginal heritage, tells him something is wrong. He searches the party's luggage, and finds a sealed metal box, obviously a bomb. It seems impossible to get the box outside due to winds, but through skilled flying, he is able to create the right conditions. The Queen swears all to secrecy, and awards David the Seventh Vote, given only by Royal commission. The party reaches Australia safely. Meanwhile, in Britain, the new Governor General has summoned Parliament to debate the multiple vote. Prime Minister Jones' government falls, and a new government, still Labour, is expected to institute the political reform. Now that the Queen is no longer in a crisis situation, Rosemary can leave the royal employment and marry David. In an epilogue, the framing story resumes. Stevie has died peaceably and an exhausted Hargreaves tries to separate dream from reality. This becomes more difficult when the child who will grow to be David Anderson is presented to him for christening. DeHavilland Ceres The fictional DeHavilland Ceres flown by the Queen's Flight appears to be based on the concept of the Avro Atlantic, a civilianised jet airliner version of the Avro Vulcan jet bomber, designed for intercontinental travel. This was a design concept at the time the novel was written, and did not enter production. Multiple vote Perhaps the most interesting (and enduring) feature of the book is the \\"multiple vote\\", seen as a necessary reform of democracy. A person can have up to seven votes. Everyone gets a basic vote. Other votes can be earned for education (including a commission in the armed forces), earning one's living overseas for two years, raising two children to the age of 14 without divorcing, being an official of a Christian church, or having a high earned income. The seventh vote, which in the book is awarded to David Anderson for his heroism, is only given at the Queen's discretion by Royal Charter. Plural voting was possible in Britain in the past. Until the late 1940s, the graduates of all British universities sent representatives to Parliament, and property owners could vote both where they lived and where they owned property; a university- educated property owner could therefore have three votes. The graduates of the National University of Ireland and of Trinity College are still represented in the upper house of Ireland's parliament. Mark Twain had used the idea of multiple votes for merit in his short story \\"The Curious Republic of Gondour\\".

It can grow up to 45 cm long and weigh up to 8 kg. This species can be recognized by its black or brown oval carapace (upper shell) with distinctive low keels on the second and third scutes. Yellow spots on the side of its head give this species its common name. These spots are most prominent in juveniles and fade with age. Females can be up to twice the size of males. Podocnemis unifilis is a type of side-necked turtles, so called because they do not pull their heads directly into their shells, but rather bend their necks sideways to tuck their heads under the rim of their shells. Side-neck turtles are classified as members of the suborder Pleurodira. Juvenile These turtles are native to South America's Amazon and Orinoco basins, as well as rivers systems of the Guianas. They are found in tributaries and large lakes, naturally calm waters. During flood season, they may venture into flooded forests or floodplain lakes. They feed on fruits, weeds, fish, and small invertebrates. The females lay two clutches of eggs each year, each with four to 35 eggs in it. They make their nests in sandy areas on the banks of rivers, where the eggs will hatch 66 to 159 days after they are laid. The eggs are laid at the peak of dry season so the nest will not be washed away with the floods of the rainy season. Eggs incubated below 32 degrees Celsius will hatch as males, while those incubated above 32 degrees Celsius will hatch as females. Within a few days after hatching, the young turtles begin to forage for food alone. This food includes vegetable matter, grasses, fruits, leaves, carrion and mollusks. Podocnemis unifilis was one of the foreign species exploited by the American pet turtle trade in the 1960s. This species are at risk of predation by humans, birds, snakes, large fish, frogs and mammals. Importation of this species is now strictly regulated by Federal law, but a captive, self-sustaining population exists in the United States‚Äîsome groups in zoos, others in the hands of private collectors. Individuals of this species have lived more than 30 years in captivity. References # Yellow-headed sideneck turtle (Podocnemis unifilis). (n.d.).

Porkbusters is an effort led by mostly conservative and libertarian bloggers to cut pork barrel spending by the U.S. Congress used to help pay for projects. The effort was launched on September 18, 2005, after the massive scale of the reconstruction effort necessary for the areas devastated by Hurricane Katrina had become apparent. It quickly picked up steam as blogger Glenn Reynolds (aka \\"Instapundit\\") began promoting the idea and the influential-though-anonymous blogger NZ Bear set up a website showing which members of the U.S. Congress had committed to cutting projects in their own districts to help offset the disaster recovery effort. Reynolds encourages his readers to send him copies of pork-cutting letters they send to their representatives and Senators, along with the responses from the elected officials. He then posts these on his website under the heading \\"Porkbusters Update\\". In operation for less than six weeks, as of October 13, 2005 the project has already managed to garner $84,000,000 in specific budget cut commitments out of various Representatives and non-specific agreements out of many more. In addition, those Representatives who have been contacted and have negative responses are highlighted and their contact information is made available for their constituents. Coburn Amendment The Porkbusters project endorsed the Coburn Amendment. Officially titled the Coburn Amendment to the Transportation, Housing, and Urban Development appropriations bill (HR 3058), the Coburn Amendment was a bill proposed by Senator Tom Coburn that would divert money from the transportation bill, specifically the $220 million for the Gravina Island Bridge in Alaska to the reconstruction of the \\"Twin Spans\\" bridgehttps://maps.google.com/maps?ll=30.181044,-89.822502&spn;=0.185801,0.253098&t;=h in Louisiana.

The Muschelkalk (\\"mussel chalk\\") consists of a sequence of limestone and dolomite beds. In the past, the time span in which the Muschelkalk was deposited could also be called \\"Muschelkalk\\". In modern stratigraphy, however, the name only applies to the stratigraphic unit. Occurrence An outcrop of Muschelkalk cliffs forms the shore of the Wutach River, in the south of Baden- W√ºrttemberg. The name Muschelkalk was first used by German geologist Georg Christian F√ºchsel (1722-1773). In 1834, Friedrich August von Alberti included it into the Triassic system. The name indicates a characteristic feature of the unit, namely the frequent occurrence of lenticular banks composed of fossil shells. The Muschelkalk is restricted to the subsurface in most of Germany and adjacent regions as the low countries, the North Sea and parts of Silesia, Poland and Denmark. Outcrops are found in Thuringia, the Harz, Franconia, Hesse, Swabia, and the Saarland and in Alsace. The Muschelkalk was deposited in a land-locked sea which, in the earlier part of its existence, had only imperfect communications with the more open waters of the Tethys Ocean to the south. The basin in which the Muschelkalk was deposited is called the Germanic Basin. Sometimes stratigraphic units with the same age from the Alps, southern Europe and even Asia are called Muschelkalk too. Of course these rocks have little history in common with the central European Muschelkalk except for similarities in fossil content. Closer at hand, the Alpine Muschelkalk differs in many respects from that of Central Europe, and in its characteristic fossil fauna has a closer affinity with the Triassic Tethys realm. Stratigraphy The Muschelkalk can be up to 100 meters thick; it is divisible into three subdivisions, of which the upper and lower are pale thin-bedded limestones with greenish-grey marls, the middle group being composed of gypsiferous and saliniferous marls with dolomite. Stylolites are common in all the Muschelkalk limestones. The lithostratigraphic status of the Muschelkalk differs regionally. In Germany it is considered a group, in the Netherlands a formation. =Germany= The top of the hard limestone (Schaumkalk) bed forms the top of the Wellenkalk or Lower Muschelkalk and the base of the Orbicularismergel, part of the Karlstadt-Formation. Outcrop near D√∂rzbach, Baden-W√ºrttemberg. Encrinus liliiforrnis from the Upper Muschelkalk at Kirchberg an der Jagst, Baden-W√ºrttemberg. Field of view approximately 20mm The German Muschelkalk Group is subdivided into three subgroups: Upper, Middle and Lower Muschelkalk. The Lower Muschelkalk consists mainly of limestone, calcareous marls and clayey marls. Some beds are composed of porous cellular limestone, the so-called Schaumkalk, there are also oolite beds. The Lower Muschelkalk is divided into six formations: Jena Formation, R√ºdersdorf Formation, Udelfangen Formation, Freudenstadt Formation and Eschenbach Formation. The Lower Muschelkalk is sometimes called Wellenkalk, the \\"wave\\" chalk, so called on account of the buckled wavy character the bedding has received. In the Saarland and Alsace and northern Eifel, the Lower Muschelkalk has more sandy beds, the Muschelsandstein., \\"mussel sandstone\\" The Middle Muschelkalk or Anbydnite Group consists mainly of evaporites (gypsum, anhydrite and halite) and is divided into three formations: Karlstadt Formation, Heilbronn Formation and Diemel Formation. The sedimentary facies at the margins of the Germanic Basin is different and these deposits are classified as a separate formation, the Grafenw√∂hr Formation, which continues into the Upper Muschelkalk. In the Middle Muschelkalk, weathering can form characteristic cellular dolomite (Zellendolomit). The Upper Muschelkalk (Hauptmuschelkalk) is similar to the Lower Muschelkalk and consists of regular beds of shelly limestone, marl and dolomite. It is divided into six formations: Trochitenkalk, Mei√üner Formation, Irrel Formation, Gilsdorf Formation and Warburg Formation. The lower portion or Trochitenkalk is often composed entirely of the fragmentary stems of the crinoid Encrinus liliiformis; higher up come beds with a series of ammonites, Ceratites cornpressus, Ceratites nodosus, and Ceratites semipartitus in ascending order. In Swabia and Franconia the highest beds are platy dolomites with Tringonodus sandergensis and the crustacean Bairdia. Fossil content In addition to the fossils mentioned above, the following are Muschelkalk forms: Terebratulina vulgaris, Spiriferina Mantzeln and S. hirsute, Myophoria vulgaris, Rhynchotites hirundo, Ceratites Munsteri, Ptychites studeri, Balatonites balatonicus, Aspidura scutellate, Daonella Lommeli, and in the Alpine region several rock-forming Algae, Baciryllium, Gyroporella, Diptopora, etc. Exploration The salt beds are worked at Halle (Saale), Bad Friedrichshall, Heilbronn, Szczecin and Erfurt. It is from this division that many of the mineral springs of Thuringia and south Germany obtain their saline contents.

In 1960 they switched back to the Leeds League, joining Division One of the league, now known as the West Yorkshire League.The West Yorkshire League 1950 and after Non-League Matters They were Division One champions in their first season, and after finishing as runners-up in 1963‚Äì64, they won the league again in 1964‚Äì65. In 1968 Guiseley joined Division Two of the Yorkshire League. League restructuring saw them demoted to Division Three in 1970, but a fourth-place finish in 1970‚Äì71 resulted in an immediate promotion back to Division Two. Another fourth-place finish in 1973‚Äì74 earned the club promotion to Division One. Although they were relegated at the end of the following season, they won Division Two in 1975‚Äì76, earning an immediate promotion back to Division One. The club went on to finish as Division One runners-up in 1979‚Äì80 and 1980‚Äì81. In 1981 the league merged with the Midland League to form the Northern Counties East League, with Guiseley placed in the Premier Division. The late 1980s and early 1990s was another successful period for Guiseley. In 1989‚Äì90 they reached the semi-finals of the FA Vase for the first time, losing 4‚Äì0 on aggregate to Bridlington Town. They reached the final the following season, beating Gresley Rovers 3‚Äì1 in a replay at Bramall Lane after the first match at Wembley had ended in a 4‚Äì4 draw. They also won the Northern Counties East League Premier Division, earning promotion to Division One of the Northern Premier League. They had the opportunity to retain the FA Vase in 1992‚Äì93 when they reached the final again, but lost 5‚Äì3 to Wimborne Town. The season also saw them reach the first round of the FA Cup for the first time, losing 1‚Äì0 to Third Division Chester City. In 1993‚Äì94 Guiseley won Division One of the Northern Premier League, earning promotion to the Premier Division. They also reached the semi-finals of the FA Trophy, losing 2‚Äì1 on aggregate to Runcorn, as well as becoming the first Division One team to win the league's President's Cup.

In 2002‚Äì03 another first round FA Cup appearance ended with a 4‚Äì0 defeat at Luton Town. A ninth-place finish in 2003‚Äì04 was enough to earn a return to the Premier Division due to league restructuring caused by the creation of the Conference North and South. In 2008‚Äì09 the club won the league's Challenge Cup and finished fourth in the Premier Division, qualifying for the promotion play-offs. However, they were beaten 2‚Äì1 by Nantwich Town in the semi-finals. The following season saw the club win the Premier Division, earning promotion to the Conference North.

Career One of Urbano's first gigs was as a member of Bourgeois Tagg, a 1980s band that was fronted by Brent Bourgeois and Larry Tagg and included Lyle Workman as the guitarist. They had moderate success with their second album, Yo-Yo, which was produced by Todd Rundgren, and featured the Top 40 hit, \\"I Don't Mind At All.\\" When Bourgeois Tagg split, Michael, Larry, and Lyle recorded and toured with Todd Rundgren for his Nearly Human Tour. While with John Hiatt (1995‚Äì1999), Urbano toured extensively as one of Hiatt's \\"Nashville Queens\\" that included bassist Davey Faragher (Elvis Costello) and guitarist David Immergluck (Counting Crows). The Nashville Queens also worked with Hiatt in the studio, recording Walk On, Little Head and Crossing Muddy Waters. Urbano is perhaps best known today for being drummer for pop rock group Smash Mouth. He originally joined the band briefly in mid-1999, replacing original drummer Kevin Coleman, and performed during the first portion of their Astro Lounge tour, though was soon replaced by touring drummer Mitch Marine. When Marine departed, he joined Smash Mouth permanently in early 2000. He stayed for six years and departed on February 14, 2006. Before Smash Mouth, Urbano had played drums with The Spent Poets, The Kinetics, Deathray, Third Eye Blind, John Hiatt, Black Lab, Cracker, Paul Westerberg, Red House Painters, Willy DeVille, Camper Van Beethoven, and Sheryl Crow.Salt Lake Tribune - Local band's big break comes at worst time - Scott Sherman - August 9, 2009 In 2006 Urbano left Smash Mouth due to creative differences. He recorded with Fischerspooner and played live with Cake as well as leading Artist Development at fuzz.com. In July 2007, he worked with Luciano Ligabue for recording a new song, \\"Niente paura\\". In early 2008 he became a band member with Luciano Ligabue, playing drums for the European Tour, and through mid-2008 in the main stadiums of Italy for the ElleSette tour. He was also in the band for the seven dates at Verona Arena in September and October 2008 with the Arena's orchestra, and during the same months of 2009 for ten concerts.

Formerly known as Barton Aerodrome and City Airport Manchester, It is known by the Civil Aviation Authority (CAA) as Manchester/Barton. The United Kingdom's first purpose-built municipal airport, it has four grass runways. The airfield operates Tuesday - Sunday, from 9 am BST until 6 p.m. or sunset (whichever earlier) for fixed-wing aircraft. Commercial, private, military, police and air ambulance helicopters can operate in the hours of darkness by arrangement. The airport is also used as a refuelling stop for light aircraft and helicopters. It lies on the edge of Chat Moss and the aircraft movements area suffers from occasional periods of waterlogging, restricting fixed wing operations. Works to improve drainage on the airfield have seen some success in reducing the number of closures. It has a CAA Ordinary Licence (Number P886) that allows flights for the public transport of passengers or for flying instruction as authorised by the licensee, City Airport Limited. The aerodrome is not licensed for night use.Civil Aviation Authority Aerodrome Ordinary Licences History A 2015 view of the main hangar which was completed during January 1930 1951 view of Barton Aerodrome's 1930s buildings including the Airport Hotel and farm buildings converted for passenger use. Also wartime temporary structures, now demolished A light aircraft prepares to depart from Barton with the 1932-built control tower at right and a postwar hangar at left An aircraft parking area at City Airport in front of the control tower * Autumn 1928: Construction of Manchester's new municipal aerodrome at Barton, near Eccles started, to replace the temporary Manchester (Wythenshawe) Aerodrome. * January 1930: The grass airfield and large hangar were completed. The first passenger charter flight occurred. Barton was managed until 1933 by Northern Air Lines, who based several Avro 504s and other types for training, club and charter flights. * Summer 1930: Imperial Airways operated a thrice-weekly scheduled service to London's Croydon Airport via Castle Bromwich Aerodrome, Birmingham, subsidised by the councils of Manchester, Liverpool and Birmingham. This service was timed to fly north from Croydon in the evening and to return south next morning, in order to provide connections to and from European airports from Croydon. * Spring 1933: A control tower and associated wireless station were completed, the first at a municipal airport outside London, and able to communicate with aircraft in flight and give pilots bearings from the airfield. The tower is still operational and is believed to be the oldest in Europe still in use for its original purpose. * August 1934: Scheduled services resumed. Croydon-based Railway Air Services commenced a Croydon- Barton-Belfast-Glasgow route. * Spring 1935: Linking services to Liverpool, Blackpool and the Isle of Man were introduced. Other smaller airlines, including Isle of Man Air Services operated services from Barton. * June 1938: All schedules were transferred to the newly completed larger Ringway Airport (which between 1940 and 1957 also accommodated RAF Ringway). * World War II: Barton was requisitioned and used for military aircraft repair and overhaul, carried out by civilian firms including Air Taxis Ltd and David Rosenfield Ltd. Aircraft types involved were Avro Ansons, Dominies, Fairey Battles, Fairey Fulmars, Hawker Hurricanes and F4U Corsairs, followed by the scrapping of Fairey Swordfish. Over 700 Percival Proctor training and communications aircraft were assembled and tested at Barton by F. Hills & Sons of Trafford Park. There is a wartime concrete air raid bunker still at the site hidden under overgrown vegetation near the main road (A57). * 1940‚Äì1942: The sole wartime scheduled air service from Ireland to the UK occasionally used Barton from 1940 to 1942, operated from Dublin by Aer Lingus and West Coast Air Services. Aer Lingus often used their Douglas DC-3, the heaviest airliner type to serve Barton on a timetabled route. This was the last scheduled service though the airfield. * 1946: Lancashire Aero Club moved from Woodford Aerodrome to Barton and remain based there until 2007. * 1946 to 1953: Manchester University Air Squadron (MUAS) was based in one of the wartime- built western hangars. In 1953 the unit moved to RAF Woodvale near Southport, Lancashire. MUAS had flown Tiger Moth and Chipmunk trainers. * 1 October 1948 to 31 March 1953: No.2 Reserve Flying School, also flying Tiger Moths and Chipmunks, was based at Barton and gave primary flight training to volunteers, who would later serve in the Royal Air Force. The unit used the same facilities as MUAS. On 31 March 1953 the unit closed. * 21 July 1996: The last known airworthy de Havilland Mosquito, a Trainer Mk III built by de Havilland at Leavesden in early 1945 (serial number RR299), crashed with the loss of both crew after suffering engine power loss when performing a wing-over manoeuvre during the Barton Aerodrome air show. * 2003: Manchester Ship Canal Developments, (of which Peel Holdings Group is the majority shareholder), bought the land, hangars and other buildings from Manchester City Council. * November 2003 : Peel Investments (North) Limited submit an initial planning application, requesting permission to build the Western Gateway Infrastructure Scheme (WGIS) to the south of the A57 road, opposite the airfield (see Port Salford).[services.salford.gov.uk/solar_documents/ptrp160409b.doc] One feature of the proposal is a new rail spur running along the eastern boundary of the airfield. * May 2004 : Initial consultations with parties likely to be affected by WGIS. * 2006: The control tower underwent a major programme of rebuilding and refurbishment. * 2007: Lancashire Aero Club left the airfield after a dispute with Peel Holdings. * 2010: City Airport Ltd no longer part of Peel Airports. Airfield Management Company now fully part of Peel Holdings. * 2010: The Original Hangar (known as The Pemberton Hangar), a Grade II listed building, long used as a warehouse for timber and sheet walling materials, underwent a full refurbishment. * 2011: Former University of Manchester building converted into a new Helicopter facility, branded as City Heliport. Peel established Cardinal Helicopter Services, a premium Helicopter Charter company operating from the Heliport with a Sikorski S.76C++ Helicopter. * 2011: The 'Clubhouse' building which houses the Airfield Cafe/Bar is fully refurbished and relaunched as 'The Airfield Lodge' with new management and longer opening hours. * Jan 2015: The Airfield Cafe/Bar is taken over by City Airport Ltd and renamed as 'Runway 26' with the aim of re-developing the facility to cater for the wider requirements of pilots, visitors and the general public. City Airport has changed little since its opening, and is considered a good example of the airfields of the 1930s. There are several historical items of note at Barton. The control tower is protected by its grade II listed building status, along with the original terminal building and hangar. The airfield is regularly used as a setting for films and TV programmes, amongst them \\"Brass\\" (where Barton masqueraded as Croydon Airport), Mersey Beat, GBH and Island at War. The distinctive control tower often features prominently in the making of such programmes and films. Retrieved on 28 August 2008. Use of City Airport by heavier aircraft is hampered by the soft peaty nature of the area, being at the edge of Chat Moss, and by the low-lying land and areas of nearby standing water encouraging fog. It would have needed much heavy work consolidating the ground (compare the struggle building the Liverpool and Manchester Railway across Chat Moss in 1826). During 2010‚Äì11, additional drainage was added to improve surface water draining, due to the original clay pipes deteriorating and no longer functioning. Emergency Services Both the National Police Air Service and the North West Air Ambulance base helicopters at the airfield. NPAS is active 24 hours a day, 365 days a year. It operates an EC135. North West Air Ambulance is a registered charity providing a Helicopter Emergency Medical Service (HEMS) covering Lancashire, Greater Manchester, Cheshire, Merseyside and Cumbria. The NWAA has two EC135 helicopters based primarily to serve Greater Manchester, South Lancashire, Cheshire and Merseyside. They operate during daylight hours only. The charity also has a third helicopter based in Blackpool. City Heliport In 2011, the airport opened its new 'City Heliport' facility, aimed at the commercial helicopter charter market, expanding and complementing the existing services provided at the Airport. The heliport features a dedicated jet A1 fuel facility, conference room, small office units and a dedicated passenger lounge. City Heliport (which is not licensed) can accept helicopters during the hours of darkness by arrangement. This facility is used particularly during football matches at nearby Old Trafford, (Manchester United) and City of Manchester Stadium (Manchester City).

It was originally serialized by Kodansha in Bessatsu Friend and collected in seven tank≈çbon volumes. It is distributed by Del Rey Manga in North America. The story is about a shy, naive Japanese teenager with a split personality. The manga is titled after the board game Othello, and not the Shakespearian play. The game involves a lot of switching back and forth between black and white pieces, representing Yaya and Nana's constant flip-flop. Plot Yaya is a shy, quiet teen with a passion for singing, Japanese rock music, gothic lolita, cosplay and music in general. But she has a secret: When she looks in a mirror or hits her head, Yaya's second personality, aptly named Nana, takes over her body and puts the wrong- doers in their places, shouting her catchphrase \\"Heavenly Punishment!\\" and once the damage is dealt, \\"Justice is done!\\" The series chronicles Yaya and Nana's somewhat episodic adventures against bullies, perverts, and generally mean people. The manga also has a lot to do with music, as several of the characters have connections to the music industry or play in a band. Though this is a different manga, Pon-chan (another manga, Guru-Guru Pon Chan, by the same author) shows up. Characters ; Yaya Higuchi : Yaya is an innocent and timid teenager who, because of her personality, is constantly attacked and ridiculed by people who claim to be her friends. She likes to wear gothic lolita on Sundays, and likes Japanese rock groups, but no one knows about it and she considers it her \\"true self\\". As a result of her being unable to do anything but go along with people who treat her badly, she develops an alter- ego named Nana. Yaya becomes fearful that she may be going insane, because she is not aware of her Nana personality, and doesn't remember large chunks of time because of it. Nana often appears if Yaya looks in a mirror, hits her head or falls asleep, but also comes out if Yaya really needs help. When she finds out about her alter-ego, Yaya gets scared and locks herself up inside, so Nana is always out. She comes to terms with it later, though, and the two girls are able to happily share one body, and even change on command. Eventually, as Yaya becomes stronger, Nana's interventions are no longer needed and she apparently fades away for good. However, it is later revealed that the two personalities have merely come together, with both Yaya and Nana's personality traits present within one conscious body. :Yaya has an interest in a visual kei band called Juliet and looks up to the lead singer of Juliet, even though the make-up band disappeared a while ago. ; Nana :Unlike the very shy Yaya, Nana is tough, cunning, sarcastic, and bold. She comes out whenever Yaya needs help because of her inability to stand up for herself. Nana kicks butt throughout the series, and reveals several people as fakes. Her phrase, whenever she accomplishes her goal, is \\"Justice is done!\\" Nana becomes a guest singer for the group \\"Black Dog\\" a few times, and later has Yaya sing with them. She gets to be out for a long while when Yaya locks herself up. Nana eventually goes away when Yaya no longer needs her to fix her messes. ; Moriyama : Yaya's handsome classmate and talented guitarist who begins a tentative romantic relationship with her. At the beginning of the series, Yaya feels that he is somewhat unkind, but in time she realizes that he is a caring person. He is one of the few people who are genuinely kind to Yaya, and helps her when Nana's existence becomes more than she can handle. He is the lead singer of the popular rock group, Black Dog. He lets Yaya become the Black dog's manager. He then also realizes that he loves Yaya as much as she loves him. ; Seri and Moe : Yaya's classmates and alleged friends who actually take pleasure in tormenting her. They call her names and treat her like their servant. They are the first ones to discover Yaya is into gothic lolita but fail to actually reveal it to anyone, as Nana stops them. ; Sh≈çhei Shinyoji : Moriyama's adult friend who has taken an interest in Nana's voice and may also be trying to pursue a more intimate relationship with her. Yaya idolizes him because he is the former singer of the band 'Juliet', a rock band created by the music industry. Sh≈çhei says that he is done with Juliet. ; Megumi Hano (Hano-chan) : A bright and optimistic transfer student who turns out to be a sadistic, jealous, and selfish manipulator and fangirl of Moriyama's. She sets her sights on Yaya when she discovers how close she is to Moriyama. Hano pressures Yaya into signing a contract that would supposedly get her into the music industry and meet Sh≈çhei. But, in actuality, Hano nearly forces Yaya into prostitution to profit off her. Nana \\"defeats\\" her during a sky diving challenge Hano instigates. Megumi has an older brother, Keisuke, who was the drummer for Juliet. Keisuke holds a grudge against Sh≈çhei for leaving the band, which caused the band to fall apart. ; Sh≈´ko : Moriyama's strong-willed ex-girlfriend, who suddenly appears and tries to take Moriyama back, just as he is getting closer with Yaya. Sh≈´ko reveals to Yaya her alter-ego when she records her becoming Nana on her phone's camera. When Sh≈´ko realizes how much Moriyama cares for Yaya, she backs off and leaves them to develop their relationship. ; Black Dog : Moriyama's band, of which he is the lead singer and lead guitarist. The other three members, Furuta, Ukon and Awane, are all college age. Their name comes from the Led Zeppelin song \\"Black Dog\\". Release Written and illustrated by Satomi Ikezawa, the chapters of Othello were serialized in the Japanese magazine Bessatsu Friend and collected into seven tank≈çbon volumes by Kodansha. The volumes were published from August 6, 2001 to September 13, 2004. Del Rey licensed Othello for an English- language release in North America and published the seven volumes from October 12, 2004 to February 28, 2006.

History RAF Foulsham at Foulsham in Norfolk was built between 1941 and 1942 for No. 2 Group RAF Bomber Command and opened in May 1942 and declared operational on 26 June 1942. Foulsham was one of the few airfields to be fitted with FIDO in 1944, a fog dispersal system which used fires at the sides of the runways. The airfield was equipped with three tarmac and woodchip runways and 37 hardstandings. It also had 9 hangars, five of which were built for storing Airspeed Horsaglider aircraft ready for D Day. The first residents were No. 98 Squadron RAF and No. 180 Squadron RAF, flying North American Mitchell bombers. The station was then used by No. 3 Group RAF who used Short Stirling and Avro Lancaster bombers. No. 514 Squadron RAF was formed at Foulsham, flying Lancasters. The station then became the home of No. 192 Squadron RAF, which was part of No. 100 Group RAF, an electronic warfare unit which had its headquarters at Bylaugh Hall. 192 Squadron was later joined by another 100 Group squadron, No. 462 Squadron, Royal Australian Air Force, which operated Handley Page Halifax aircraft. During World War II, 45 aircraft based at RAF Foulsham were lost. Many aircraft made emergency landings at Foulsham, including USAAF Boeing B-17 Flying Fortress F \\"Ruthie II\\", which made an emergency landing there in 1943 after an epic return flight for which co-pilot John C. Morgan was awarded the highest U.S. medal, the Medal of Honor. The airfield remained the property of the Ministry of Defence until the 1980s.

To achieve this, Nyerere provided what is regarded as one of the most successful cases of ethnic repression and identity transformation in Africa. Pierre Englebert and Kevin C. Dunn, \\"Inside African Politics\\" 2013: 81 With over 130 languages spoken within its territory, Tanzania is one of the most ethnically diverse countries in Africa. Despite this obstacle, ethnic divisions remained rare in Tanzania when compared to the rest of the continent. Languages A total of 130 languages are spoken in Tanzania; most of them are from the Bantu family. Swahili and English are the two official languages of Tanzania. However, Swahili is the national language. Given the conditions of the period, it was not possible to introduce Swahili in the entire educational system, because the scale of the task of writing or translating textbooks for primary schools was already considerable. As a result, English, the colonial language since the end of World War I, is still the language of high schools and universities. Many students leave school after finishing primary education. Although the many non-official languages in Tanzania are not actively suppressed, they do not enjoy the same linguistic rights as Swahili and English. They also face language extinction, with one, the Kw'adza language, having no remaining speakers. Literature Some writers include: * Edwin Semzaba * Euphrase Kezilahabi Media Music =National anthem= The Tanzanian national anthem is Mungu ibariki afrika (God Bless Africa), composed by South Africa's composer Enoch Sontonga. The song is also the national anthem of South Africa (with another tune), Zambia. =Music industry= The music industry in Tanzania has seen many changes in the past ten years. With a fusion of local and foreign music traditions, Tanzanian musicians have grown in prominence within the African Great Lakes region. It includes artists from traditional music, such as Dionys Mbilinyi, Sabinus Komba, and many others, to new vibrant artists in R&B;, pop, Zouk, Taarab, and dance. Imani Sanga is a composer, ethnomusicologist, church organist, and choral conductor. Mwakisinini Felix is a music artist who contributed a lot in church music as a composer, trainer, and choral conductor. Arts =Painting= Tingatinga are popular Tanzanian paintings, which are painted with enamel paints on canvas. Usually, the motifs are animals and flowers in colorful and repetitive design. The style was started by Mr. Edward Saidi Tingatinga, who was born in South Tanzania. Later, he moved to Dar es Salaam. Since his death in 1972, the Tingatinga style expanded both in Tanzania and worldwide. One of the most famous African artists, George Lilanga, was born in Tanzania. Other recognized Tanzanian abstract artists include David Mzuguno, Haji Chilonga, Salum Kambi, Max Kamundi, Thobias Minzi, Robino Ntila, John Kilaka, Godfrey Semwaiko, Evarist Chikawe, and many others (see also: http://www.artshost.org/rafiki). =Cartoons= Tanzania's cartoons have a history that can be traced back to the work of pioneering artists, such as Christian Gregory with his Chakubanga cartoons in the Uhuru newspaper back in the 1970s and 1980s, and Philip Ndunguru in the early 1980s. Outspokenly political cartoons were created on a more recent date. In the past decade, the art of cartoons and comics has really taken off in Tanzania. At the present date, there are dozens of cartoonists, some of whom are well known throughout the country. From the 1960s and so on, a number of artists prepared the way, and their names are cited by today's artists as essential influences. Some of these known cartoonists in Tanzania include Ally Masoud 'kipanya', Sammi Mwamkinga, Nathan Mpangala 'Kijasti', King kinya, Adam Lutta, Fred Halla, James Gayo, Robert Mwampembwa, Francis Bonda, Popa Matumula, Noah Yongolo, Oscar Makoye, Fadhili Mohamed, and many others (see the excellent history of cartoons in Tanzania at the Worldcomics website: http://www.worldcomics.fi) =Sculpture= Apart from his paintings, George Lilanga, who died in 2005, was also one of Tanzania's most famous sculptors. Tanzanian craftsmen and artists have created a rich legacy of sculptures, representing abstract images of people, animals and most of all, the famous Makonde carvings of surrealist sheitani figures, made out of extremely hard ebony (mapingo) wood. Sports Cuisine Traditional Tanzanian food consisting of pilau kuku (seasoned rice with chicken), mishkaki (grilled meat), ndizi (plantain), maharage (beans), mboga (vegetables), chapati (flatbread) and pili pili (hot sauce) Barbecued beef cubes and seafood in Forodhani Gardens, Zanzibar A Ramadan dinner in Tanzania Tanzanian cuisine varies by geographical region. Along the coastal regions (Dar es Salaam, Tanga, Bagamoyo, Zanzibar, and Pemba), spicy foods are common, and there is also much use of coconut milk. Regions in Tanzania's mainland consume different foods. Some typical mainland Tanzanian foods include wali (rice), ugali (maize porridge), nyama choma (grilled meat), mshikaki (marinated beef), samaki (fish), pilau (rice mixed with a variety of spices), biriyani, and ndizi-nyama (plantains with meat). Vegetables commonly used in Tanzania include bamia (okra), mchicha (a kind of spinach), njegere (green peas), maharage (beans), and kisamvu (cassava leaves). Tanzania grows at least 17 different types of bananas which are used for soup, stew, and chips. Additionally, some breakfast food that you would typically see if you were to go to Tanzania are maandazi (fried doughnut), chai (tea), chapati (a kind of flat bread), and chipsi mayai. Famous Tanzanian snack foods include isheti, kashata (coconut bars), kabaab (kebab), sambusa (samosa), mkate wa kumimina (Zanzibari rice bread), vileja, vitumbua (rice patties), and bagia. Since a large community of Indians have migrated into Tanzania, a considerable proportion of Tanzanian cuisine has been influenced by Indian cuisine. Famous chefs, such as Mohsin Asharia, have revolutionized traditional Indian dishes, such as kashata korma tabsi and voodo aloo. Many Indians own restaurants in the heart of Dar es Salaam, and have been welcomed by indigenous Tanzanians.

Banks Japan's traditional banking system was segmented into clearly defined components in the late 1980s: commercial banks (thirteen major and sixty-four smaller regional banks), long- term credit banks (seven), trust banks (seven), mutual loan and savings banks (sixty-nine), and various specialized financial institutions. During the 1980s, a rapidly growing group of nonbank operations‚Äîsuch as consumer loan, credit card, leasing, and real estate organizations‚Äîbegan performing some of the traditional functions of banks, such as the issuing of loans. In the early postwar financial system, city banks provided short-term loans to major domestic corporations while regional banks took deposits and extended loans to medium-sized and small businesses. Neither engaged much in international business. In the 1950s and 1960s, a specialized bank, the Bank of Tokyo, took care of most of the government's foreign-exchange needs and functioned as the nation's foreign-banking representative. Long-term credit banks were intended to complement rather than to compete with the commercial banks. Authorized to issue debentures rather than take ordinary deposits, they specialized in long- term lending to major keiretsu (Á≥ªÂàó). Trust banks were authorized to conduct retail and trust banking and often combined the work of commercial and long- term credit banks. Trust banks not only managed portfolios but also raised funds through the sale of negotiable loan trust certificates. Mutual loan and savings banks, credit associations, credit cooperatives, and labor credit associations collected individual deposits from general depositors. These deposits were then loaned to cooperative members and to the liquidity-starved city banks via the interbank money markets or were sent to central cooperative banks, which in turn loaned the funds to small businesses and corporations. More than 8,000 agricultural, forestry, and fishery cooperatives performed many of the same functions for the cooperatives. Many of their funds were transmitted to their central bank, the Norinchukin Bank, which was the world's largest bank in terms of domestic deposits. In 1990, the five largest banks in the world, measured by total assets, were Japanese banks. These banks opened branches abroad, acquired existing foreign banks, and became engaged in new activities, such as underwriting Euro-yen bond issues. The investment houses also increased overseas activities, especially participating in the United States Treasury bond market (where as much as 25 to 30% of each new issue was purchased by Japanese investors in the late 1980s). As of March 1989, the five largest city banks in Japan (in order of total fund volume) were Dai-Ichi Kangyo Bank, Sumitomo Bank, Fuji Bank, Mitsubishi Bank, and Sanwa Bank. Government institutions A group of government financial institutions paralleled the private banking sector. The Japan Export-Import Bank (JEXIM), the Japan Development Bank, and a number of finance corporations, such as the Housing Loan Corporation, promoted the growth of specialized sectors of the domestic economy. These institutions derived their funding from deposits collected by the postal savings system and deposited with the Trust Fund Bureau. The postal savings system, through the 24,000 post offices, accepted funds in various forms, including savings, annuities, and insurance. The post offices offered the highest interest rates for regular savings accounts (8% for time deposits in 1990) and tax-free savings until 1988, thereby collecting more deposits and accounts than any other institution in the world. The Japan Bank for International Cooperation (JBIC) is the only government institution with an international focus. This bank provides financing for trade between Japan and developing countries, performing the function of export-import banks run by governments in other countries (including the United States), although its participation is possibly greater. Securities Japan's securities markets increased their volume of dealings rapidly during the late 1980s, led by Japan's rapidly expanding securities firms. There were three categories of securities companies in Japan, the first consisting of the \\"Big Four\\" securities houses (among the six largest such firms in the world): Nomura, Daiwa, Nikko, and Yamaichi. The Big Four played a key role in international financial transactions and were members of the New York Stock Exchange. Nomura was the world's largest single securities firm; its net capital, in excess of US$10 billion in 1986, exceeded that of Merrill Lynch, Salomon Brothers, and Shearson Lehman combined. In 1986, Nomura became the first Japanese member of the London Stock Exchange. Nomura and Daiwa were primary dealers in the United States Treasury bond market. The second tier of securities firms contained ten medium-sized firms. The third tier consisted of all the smaller securities firms registered in Japan. Many of these smaller firms were affiliates of the Big Four, while some were affiliated with banks. In 1986 eighty-three of the smaller firms were members of the Tokyo Securities and Stock Exchange. Japan's securities firms derived most of their income from brokerage fees, equity and bond trading, underwriting, and dealing. Other services included the administration of trusts. In the late 1980s, a number of foreign securities firms, including Salomon Brothers and Merrill Lynch, became players in Japan's financial world. Japanese insurance companies became important leaders in international finance in the late 1980s. More than 90% of the population owned life insurance and the amount held per person was at least 50% greater than in the United States. Many Japanese used insurance companies as savings vehicles. Insurance companies' assets grew at a rate of more than 20% per year in the late 1980s, reaching nearly US$694 billion in 1988. The life insurance companies moved heavily into foreign investments as deregulation allowed them to do so and as their resources increased through the spread of fully funded pension funds. These assets permitted the companies to become major players in international money markets. Nippon Life Insurance Company, the world's largest insurance firm, was reportedly the biggest single holder of United States Treasury securities in 1989. =Stock Exchange= The Tokyo Securities and Stock Exchange became the largest in the world in 1988, in terms of the combined market value of outstanding shares and capitalization, while the Osaka Stock Exchange ranked third after those of Tokyo and New York. Although there are eight stock exchanges in Japan, the Tokyo Securities and Stock Exchange represented 83% of the nation's total equity in 1988. Of the 1,848 publicly traded domestic companies in Japan at the end of 1986, about 80% were listed on the Tokyo Securities and Stock Exchange. Two developments in the late 1980s helped in the rapid expansion of the Tokyo Securities and Stock Exchange. The first was a change in the financing of company operations. Traditionally large firms obtained funding through bank loans rather than capital markets, but in the late 1980s they began to rely more on direct financing. The second development came in 1986 when the Tokyo exchange permitted non-Japanese brokerage firms to become members for the first time. By 1988 the exchange had sixteen foreign members. The Tokyo Securities and Stock Exchange had 124 member companies in 1990. In 1990, five types of securities were traded on the Tokyo exchange: stocks, bonds, investment trusts, rights, and warrants alone. Japan's stock market dealings exploded in the 1980s, with increased trading volume and rapidly rising stock prices. The trading recorded by the Nikkei 225 stock average, compiled by the Nihon Keizai Shimbun (Japan Economic Daily), grew from 6,850 in October 1982 to nearly 39,000 in early 1990. During one six-month period in 1986, total trade volume on the Tokyo exchange increased by 250% with wild swings in the Nikkei. After the plunge of the New York Stock Exchange in October 1987, the Tokyo average dropped by 15%, but there was a sharp recovery by early 1988. This was the height of the Japanese asset price bubble, which collapsed in the year 1990, and was followed by the lost decade.

He served as Minister of Agriculture and Fisheries under Ramsay MacDonald in 1924 and between 1929 and 1930. Background and education Born Noel Edward Buxton, the second son of Sir Thomas Buxton, 3rd Baronet, he was educated at Harrow and at Trinity College, Cambridge. Political career In 1896, Buxton acted as Aide-de-Camp to his father during his time as Governor of South Australia. He served on the Whitechapel Board of Guardians and Central Unemployment Body, and was a Member of the Home Office Departmental Committee on Lead Poisoning. Buxton stood unsuccessfully for Ipswich in 1900. He was elected as Liberal Member of Parliament for Whitby in 1905, a seat he held until 1906.leighrayment.com House of Commons: West Lothian to Widnes He was out of parliament until the January 1910 general election, when he was returned for Norfolk North.leighrayment.com House of Commons: New Romney to Northampton He joined the Labour Party in 1919 and in 1922 he successfully contested his Norfolk North seat as a Labour candidate. He continued to represent the constituency until 1930. When Labour came to power under Ramsay MacDonald in January 1924, Buxton was appointed Minister of Agriculture and Fisheries, with a seat in the cabinet, and sworn of the Privy Council. He remained as Minister of Agriculture and Fisheries until the government fell in December 1924. He resumed the post in 1929 (once again as a member of the cabinet) when Labour returned to office under MacDonald, and held it until 1930, when he was raised to the peerage as Baron Noel-Buxton, of Aylsham in the County of Norfolk. He changed his surname at this point to 'Noel-Buxton', so enabling that to be his title. Balkans The Balkans became a very important part of Buxton's career. In 1912, as Buxton had been warning, war broke out between the newly independent Balkan countries of Bulgaria, Greece, Montenegro and Serbia and the Ottoman Empire. Buxton was Chairman of the Balkan War Relief Committee. Shortly after the war had broken out, he visited Bulgaria with Mabel St Clair Stobart, founder of the Women's Sick and Wounded Convoy Corps. He helped her convince the government to agree to send an all-female medical unit to the war. During the First World War (1914‚Äì1915), he went on a political mission with his brother, Charles Roden Buxton, with the object of securing the neutrality of Bulgaria. While in Bucharest, Romania in October 1914, an assassination attempt was made on them, by Turkish activist, Hasan Tahsin. Buxton was wounded and his brother was shot through the lung. They both recovered and continued to have an interest in the region. After their return, they published a book describing the region and its recent history, The War and the Balkans (London: George Allen and Unwin, 1915). It begins with these words: Vitosha from the boulevard named after the brothers Noel & Charles Buxton in Sofia, Bulgaria () > No one now denies the supreme importance of the Balkans as a factor in the > European War. It may be that there were deep-seated hostilities between the > Great Powers which would have, in any case, produced a European War and that > if the Balkans had not offered the occasion, the occasion would have been > found elsewhere. The fact remains that the Balkans did provide the occasion. > A great part of the Serbo-Croat race found itself under the Austrian Empire, > and with its increasing consciousness of nationality became more and more > dissatisfied with its lot. The independent kingdom of Serbia for its part > has taken active steps to spread abroad the idea of uniting its brothers > under its own flag. It was Austria's ambition to crush this dangerous little > State, the one rallying point of a vigorous and determined race. Buxton's publications include Europe and the Turks; With the Bulgarian Staff; Travels and Reflections, 1929; and he was part-author of The Heart of the Empire, Travel and Politics in Armenia, The War and the Balkans, Balkan Problems and European Peace, and Oppressed Peoples and the League of Nations. Family Noel was the great-grandson of the abolitionist, Sir Thomas Fowell Buxton he married Lucy Edith Pelham Burn in 1914. She succeeded him as Member of Parliament for Norfolk North in 1930.

Noel Buxton Trust Inspired by the abolitionism of his great-grandfather, he established the Noel Buxton Trust in 1919. This had a commitment to \\"a worldwide view of human welfare\\". The initial grant was made to the Fight the Famine Council, which was led by Eglantyne Jebb and his sister-in-law Dorothy Buxton which later became the Save the Children Fund. The charity is still functioning has recently funded the Family Rights Group, the Community Chaplaincy Association working with ex-prisoners, and Excellent, a charity supporting sustainable development with subsistence communities in Africa.

Beck himself would be out of commission by December due to an automobile accident.  Reception and legacy  In a contemporary review for The Village Voice, music critic Robert Christgau was unimpressed by the album and facetiously remarked that Stewart and Beck had encouraged Hopkins' overblown playing. At the time, Beck commented on the album cover the impossibility of coming up with anything original, and that Beck-Ola indeed was not. Although a short album at half an hour, along with its predecessor it is regarded as a seminal work of heavy metal due to its use of blues toward a hard rock approach and the squaring off of Beck's guitar against Stewart's vocals, and claims that it was duplicated the same year by Beck's confederate Jimmy Page with his singer Robert Plant in Led Zeppelin,Nick Logan and Bob Woffinden, editors.

Some video search engines parse externally hosted content while others allow content to be uploaded and hosted on their own servers. Some engines also allow users to search by video format type and by length of the clip. The video search results are usually accompanied by a thumbnail view of the video. Video search engines are computer programs designed to find videos stored on digital devices, either through Internet servers or in storage units from the same computer. These searches can be made through audiovisual indexing, which can extract information from audiovisual material and record it as metadata, which will be tracked by search engines.  Utility  The main use of these search engines is the increasing creation of audiovisual content and the need to manage it properly. The digitization of audiovisual archives and the establishment of the Internet, has led to large quantities of video files stored in big databases, whose recovery can be very difficult because of the huge volumes of data and the existence of a semantic gap.  Search criterion  The search criterion used by each search engine depends on its nature and purpose of the searches. = Metadata = Metadata is information about facts. It could be information about who is the author of the video, creation date, duration, and all the information that could be extracted and included in the same files. Internet is often used in a language called XML to encode metadata, which works very well through the web and is readable by people. Thus, through this information contained in these files is the easiest way to find data of interest to us. In the videos there are two types of metadata, that we can integrate in the video code itself and external metadata from the page where the video is. In both cases we optimize them to make them ideal when indexed.  Internal metadata  All video formats incorporate their own metadata. The title, description, coding quality or transcription of the content are possible. To review these data exist programs like FLV MetaData Injector, Sorenson Squeeze or Castfire. Each one has some utilities and special specifications. Converting from one format to another can lose much of this data, so check that the new format information is correct. It is therefore advisable to have the video in multiple formats, so all search robots will be able to find and index it.  External metadata  In most cases the same mechanisms must be applied as in the positioning of an image or text content. = Title and description = They are the most important factors when positioning a video, because they contain most of the necessary information. The titles have to be clearly descriptive and should remove every word or phrase that is not useful. = Filename = It should be descriptive, including keywords that describe the video with no need to see their title or description. Ideally, separate the words by dashes \\"-\\". = Tags = On the page where the video is, it should be a list of keywords linked to the microformat \\"rel-tag\\". These words will be used by search engines as a basis for organizing information. = Transcription and subtitles = Although not completely standard, there are two formats that store information in a temporal component that is specified, one for subtitles and another for transcripts, which can also be used for subtitles. The formats are SRT or SUB for subtitles and TTXT for transcripts. = Speech recognition = Speech recognition consists of a transcript of the speech of the audio track of the videos, creating a text file. In this way and with the help of a phrase extractor can easily search if the video content is of interest. Some search engines apart from using speech recognition to search for videos, also use it to find the specific point of a multimedia file in which a specific word or phrase is located and so go directly to this point. Gaudi (Google Audio Indexing), a project developed by Google Labs, uses voice recognition technology to locate the exact moment that one or more words have been spoken within an audio, allowing the user to go directly to exact moment that the words were spoken. If the search query matches some videos from YouTube, the positions are indicated by yellow markers, and must pass the mouse over to read the transcribed text. = Text recognition = The text recognition can be very useful to recognize characters in the videos through \\"chyrons\\". As with speech recognizers, there are search engines that allow (through character recognition) to play a video from a particular point. TalkMiner, an example of search of specific fragments from videos by text recognition, analyzes each video once per second looking for identifier signs of a slide, such as its shape and static nature, captures the image of the slide and uses Optical Character Recognition (OCR) to detect the words on the slides. Then, these words are indexed in the search engine of TalkMiner, which currently offers to users more than 20,000 videos from institutions such as Stanford University, the University of California at Berkeley, and TED. = Frame analysis = Through the visual descriptors we can analyze the frames of a video and extract information that can be scored as metadata. Descriptions are generated automatically and can describe different aspects of the frames, such as color, texture, shape, motion, and the situation.  Ranking criterion  The usefulness of a search engine depends on the relevance of the result set returned. While there may be millions of videos that include a particular word or phrase, some videos may be more relevant, popular or have more authority than others. This arrangement has a lot to do with search engine optimization. Most search engines use different methods to classify the results and provide the best video in the first results. However, most programs allow sorting the results by several criteria. = Order by relevance = This criterion is more ambiguous and less objective, but sometimes it is the closest to what we want; depends entirely on the searcher and the algorithm that the owner has chosen. That's why it has always been discussed and now that search results are so ingrained into our society it has been discussed even more. This type of management often depends on the number of times that the searched word comes out, the number of viewings of this, the number of pages that link to this content and ratings given by users who have seen it. SEO by Google central webmaster = Order by date of upload = This is a criterion based totally on timeline. Results can be sorted according to their seniority in the repository. = Order by number of views = It can give us an idea of the popularity of each video. = Order by length = This is the length of the video and can give a taste of which video it is. = Order by user rating = It is common practice in repositories let the users rate the videos, so that a content of quality and relevance will have a high rank on the list of results gaining visibility. This practice is closely related to virtual communities.  Interfaces  We can distinguish two basic types of interfaces, some are web pages hosted on servers which are accessed by Internet and searched through the network, and the others are computer programs that search within a private network. = Internet = Within Internet interfaces we can find repositories that host video files which incorporate a search engine that searches only their own databases, and video searchers without repository that search in sources of external software.  Repositories with video searcher  Provides accommodation in video files stored on its servers and usually has an integrated search engine that searches through videos uploaded by its users. One of the first web repositories, or at least the most famous are the portals Vimeo, Dailymotion and YouTube. Their searches are often based on reading the metadata tags, titles and descriptions that users assign to their videos. The disposal and order criterion of the results of these searches are usually selectable between the file upload date, the number of viewings or what they call the relevance. Still, sorting criterion are nowadays the main weapon of these websites, because the positioning of videos is important in terms of promotion.  Video searchers repositories  They are websites specialized in searching videos across the network or certain pre-selected repositories. They work by web spiders that inspect the network in an automated way to create copies of the visited websites, which will then be indexed by search engines, so they can provide faster searches. = Private network = Functioning scheme Sometimes a search engine only searches in audiovisual files stored within a computer or, as it happens in televisions, on a private server where users access through a local area network. These searchers are usually software or rich Internet applications with a very specific search options for maximum speed and efficiency when presenting the results. They are typically used for large databases and are therefore highly focused to satisfy the needs of television companies. An example of this type of software would be the Digition Suite, which apart from being a benchmark in this kind of interfaces is very close to us as for the storage and retrieval files system from the Corporaci√≥ Catalana de Mitjans Audiovisuals. Digitalize or die (Al√≠cia Conesa) This particular suite and perhaps in its strongest point is that it integrates the entire process of creating, indexing, storing, searching, editing, and a recovery. Once we have a digitized audiovisual content is indexed with different techniques of different level depending on the importance of content and it's stored. The user, when he wants to retrieve a particular file, has to fill a search fields such as program title, issue date, characters who act or the name of the producer, and the robot starts the search. Once the results appear and they arranged according to preferences, the user can play the low quality videos to work as quickly as possible. When he finds the desired content, it is downloaded with good definition, it's edited and reproduced. Digition Suite from Activa Multimedia  Design and algorithms  Video search has evolved slowly through several basic search formats which exist today and all use keywords. The keywords for each search can be found in the title of the media, any text attached to the media and content linked web pages, also defined by authors and users of video hosted resources. Some video search is performed using human powered search, others create technological systems that work automatically to detect what is in the video and match the searchers needs. Many efforts to improve video search including both human powered search as well as writing algorithm that recognize what's inside the video have meant complete redevelopment of search efforts. It is generally acknowledged that speech to text is possible, though recently Thomas Wilde, the new CEO of Everyzing, acknowledged that Everyzing works 70% of the time when there is music, ambient noise or more than one person speaking. If newscast style speaking (one person, speaking clearly, no ambient noise) is available, that can rise to 93%. (From the Web Video Summit, San Jose, CA, June 27, 2007). Around 40 phonemes exist in every language with about 400 in all spoken languages. Rather than applying a text search algorithm after speech-to-text processing is completed, some engines use a phonetic search algorithm to find results within the spoken word. Others work by literally listening to the entire podcast and creating a text transcription using a sophisticated speech-to-text process. Once the text file is created, the file can be searched for any number of search words and phrases. It is generally acknowledged that visual search into video does not work well and that no company is using it publicly. Researchers at UC San Diego and Carnegie Mellon University have been working on the visual search problem for more than 15 years, and admitted at a \\"Future of Search\\" conference at UC Berkeley in spring 2007 that it was years away from being viable even in simple search.  Video search engines  = Agnostic search = Search that is not affected by the hosting of video, where results are agnostic no matter where the video is located: * blinkx was launched in 2004 and uses speech recognition and visual analysis to process spidered video rather than rely on metadata alone. blinkx claims to have the largest archive of video on the web and puts its collection at around 26,000,000 hours of content. * CastTV is a Web-wide video search engine that was founded in 2006 and funded by Draper Fisher Jurvetson, Ron Conway, and Marc Andreessen. * Munax released their first version all-content search engine in 2005 and powers both nationwide and worldwide search engines with video search. * Picsearch Video Search has been licensed to search portals since 2006. Picsearch is a search technology provider who powers image, video and audio search for over 100 major search engines around the world. = Non-agnostic search = Search results are modified, or suspect, due to the large hosted video being given preferential treatment in search results: * AOL Video offers a video search engine that can be used to find video located on popular video destinations across the web. In December 2005, AOL acquired Truveo Video Search. * Bing video search is a search engine powered by Bing and also used by Yahoo!

It was closely based on the novel of the same name by Georges Bernanos. Published in 1936, the novel received the Grand prix du roman de l'Acad√©mie fran√ßaise. It tells the story of a young sickly priest who has been assigned to his first parish, a village in northern France. Diary of a Country Priest was lauded for Laydu's debut performance, which has been called one of the greatest in the history of cinema; the film won numerous awards, including the Grand Prize at the Venice International Film Festival, and the Prix Louis Delluc.Wakeman. pp. 57. Plot An idealistic young priest arrives at Ambricourt, his new parish. He is not welcome. The girls of the catechism class laugh at him in a prank, whereby only one of them pretends to know the Scriptural basis of the Eucharist so that the rest of them can laugh at their private conversation. His colleagues criticize his diet of bread and wine, and his ascetic lifestyle. Concerned about Chantal, the daughter of the Countess, the priest visits the Countess at the family chateau, and appears to help her resume communion with God after a period of doubt. The Countess dies during the following night, and her daughter spreads false rumors that the priest's harsh words had tormented her to death. Refusing confession, Chantal had previously spoken to the priest about her hatred of her parents. The older priest from Torcy talks to his younger colleague about his poor diet and lack of prayer, but the younger man seems unable to make changes. After his health worsens, the young priest goes to the city to visit a doctor, who diagnoses him with stomach cancer. The priest goes for refuge to a former colleague, who has lapsed and now works as an apothecary, while living with a woman outside wedlock. The priest dies in the house of his colleague after being absolved by him.

Bernanos rejected Aurenche's first draft. By the time Bresson worked on the screenplay, Bernanos had died. Bresson said he \\"would have taken more liberties,\\" if Bernanos were still alive.Fran√ßois Truffaut, \\"A Certain Tendency of the French Cinema\\" Film Theory: Critical Concepts in Media and Cultural Studies ed. Philip Simpson. New York: Taylor & Francis (2004): 11 This film marked a transition period for Bresson, as he began using non-professional actors (with the exception of the Countess). It was also the first film in which Bresson utilized a complex soundtrack and voice-over narration, stating that \\"an ice-cold commentary can warm, by contrast, tepid dialogues in a film. Phenomenon analogues to that of hot and cold in painting.\\"Wakeman, John. World Film Directors, Volume 1. The H. W. Wilson Company. 1987. pp. 57. Guy Lefranc was assistant director on the movie.  Analysis  The film is a blending of dialogue and commentary, founded on the interior voice of the priest. Faithful to the spirit of Georges Bernanos, the author of Journal d'un cur√© de campagne, Bresson strips the story open thoroughly by composing a sequence of exemplary sobriety. At such a point could Fran√ßois Truffaut say that the film, which he particularly admired, had sound scenes that were \\"down-to-earth.\\" (Bresson limits the most possible expressions and intonations of professional comedians; thus, for this sequence, he did not work elsewhere with amateurs, which he called \\"models\\"). Forcing himself a remarkable distance from relation to his subject who is \\"a man who limits perpetual states of the soul,\\" he refuses all melodramatic effects and all mystic interpretations. A profoundly religious and Christian film, Diary of a Country Priest is also the exploration of being a rebel of prey to a fixed idea, a theme that is consistent in the work of Bresson. Absent of all \\"psychologism,\\" like all judgement of value, the director uniquely raises a question to something of significance to himself, thereby making Diary of a Country Priest a captivating and mysterious work. Reception Diary of a Country Priest was a financial success in France and established Bresson's international reputation as a major film director.

He amassed a large collection of botanical texts which were bequeathed to Magdalen College, Oxford, and translated a number of classical texts into English.  Life  SE Hampshire, R Gunther 1922 John Goodyer was born in Alton, Hampshire, to Reginald Goodyer (c. 1578‚Äì1619) and Ann Goodyer. Reginald Goodyear was a local yeoman, and he and his wife had four children, John being the youngest. Learned in Greek and Latin, he evidently received a good education, possibly at the grammar school at Alton. At that time he would have served an apprenticeship prior to his employment as an estate manager (steward). This would probably have been to William Yalden (d. 1644). Yalden was a land agent for estates owned by Magdalen College, Oxford near Petersfield, to the south, and whose second wife was John Goodyer's sister, Rose (d. 1652). When he first started work, Goodyer lived at nearby Buriton, close to his employer before moving further west to the village of Droxford, in the Meon Valley. In 1629 he moved back to the Buriton area, being given the lease of a neighbouring farm and house by the Bilsons at a nominal rate \\"in consideration of his faithful service\\" as the lease states. Three years later, in November 1632, he married Patience Crumpe (b. c.1600), daughter of a London tailor, and moved to an area of Petersfield known as The Spain, where his substantial house still stands. The house was known as The Great House at that time and as Goodyers now. Such was Goodyer's reputation that in 1643 during the English Civil War (1642‚Äì1651), Ralph Hopton, one of the senior Royalist commanders, ordered troops \\"to defend and protect John Goodyer, his house, family, servants and estates\\". This order was found underneath the floorboards of the house. St Mary's Church, Buriton After his wife died he moved to the hamlet of Weston, near Buriton, where he died in April or early May 1664 at the age of 71 and was buried in an unmarked grave near his wife's at St Mary's Church, Buriton. With no children to succeed him, the majority of his estate passed to his nephew, the Reverend Edmund Yalden, the only son of William and Rose Yalden.  Work  Page from Goodyer's Dioscorides = Employment = Goodyer started working for Sir Thomas Bilson (1592‚Äì), Lord of the Manor of Mapledurham, in the parish of Buriton, near Petersfield around 1616, an appointment probably obtained through the offices of Yalden. Bilson resided at West Mapledurham Manor House, (demolished 1829) and Goodyer initially leased a nearby house from him. Although a servant, he remained very close to the Bilson family, three of Sir Thomas' sons being close friends for life and being remembered in his will. He also held a position as the agent for two Bishops of Winchester: Thomas Bilson (father of Sir Thomas Bilson) and later, Lancelot Andrewes. = Botanical fieldwork = Goodyer's work involved spending much time in the countryside, and he took an interest in the plants he observed and how they were named. His intellectual interests prompted him to acquire botanical texts and to cultivate the company of apothecaries, who at that time possessed much of the knowledge of plants and their properties. Amongst these was John Parkinson in London whom he visited in 1616. His notes start from this date, reach a peak of activity by 1621, and are few following 1633. They show that the area he explored and recorded covered from Bristol, to Weymouth, Wellingborough, and Romney Marsh. His findings were mainly published by Thomas Johnson and his contemporaries, rather than by himself, leading to his work being largely forgotten after his death. They suggest his intention was to produce a guide to the English flora, matching his observations with the texts of the continental authors he had studied, but he was never able to complete this. Goodyer added many plants to the British flora. He is credited with clarifying the identities of the British elms, and for discovering an unusual elm endemic to the Hampshire coast between Lymington and Christchurch named for him as Goodyer's elm; this was believed by the botanist Ronald Melville to be a form of the Cornish elm. He is also believed to have introduced the Jerusalem artichoke to English cuisine. Although not formally trained in medicine, like many herbalists of his time, he had a small practice using herbal remedies, skills he passed on to his nephew, Rev. Edmund Yalden. = Scholarly activity = One of his most important contributions was his work with botanist Thomas Johnson in producing a revised and corrected edition of John Gerard's Herbal (1597), arguably the greatest herbal of its time, in 1633. Johnson called him his \\"onely assistant\\". He also translated a Latin version of Dioscorides's work, De Materia Medica, and Theophrastus' Historia Plantarum (1623).  Legacy  Proceeds from the residue of his estate were used to establish the John Goodyer Charity to help the poor of Weston, a charity that still exists today. He bequeathed his papers and extensive collection of 239 printed works to Magdalen College, Oxford in 1664, through his connection to the Yaldens. The Yaldens had managed the college's local estates, while two of their sons attended the college and Edmund was also a fellow there. In his time Goodyer was well regarded, the contemporary botanist William Coles calling him \\"the ablest Herbarist now living in England\\" in 1657. But because of the lack of publications during his lifetime he remained largely forgotten and unrecognized after his death. He is mentioned in neither the Dictionary of National Biography (1890) nor the first Flora of Hampshire (1883). His rediscovery dates from about 1910, first by the charity he created and then by botanists. Canon John Vaughan is credited with discovering Goodyer and had called him the \\"forgotten Botanist\\" in 1909. In 1912 J.W. White described how Goodyer contributed to the work of many other botanists and made their work better known: \\"every writer of the period owned help from Goodyer in one way or another\\". He became recognised as one of the earliest amateur British botanists, and in 1922 Gunther at Magdalen College assembled his papers and published an account of his life and work. Around this time a stained glass window (Figure 1) was installed in St Mary's Church, Buriton as a memorial to him, after funds were raised by public description. It includes the Goodyer coat of arms and motto with an inscription stating: > To the Glory of GOD and in memory of John Goodyer of Alton Mapledurham > Petersfield 1592‚Äì1664. Royalist, Botanist, and founder of the Goodyer > Charity Weston. Buried in Buriton Churchyard His house in Petersfield bears a commemorative plaque (Figure 2). In recognition of his industry, Goodyera, a genus of small terrestrial European orchids, was named after him by Robert Brown. The second Flora of Hampshire (1996) was dedicated to his memory. The 350th anniversary of his death was celebrated at Magdalen College in 2014. = Descendants = Being childless, Goodyer had no direct descendants. However, Anne, the youngest daughter of William and Rose Yalden married a Petersfield lawyer named John Worlidge. Of their ten children, the eldest, John (1640‚Äì1700) wrote many books on agriculture, including Systema agriculturae or The Mystery of Husbandry Discovered (1669), Vinetum Britannicum or A Treatise of Cider (1676), Apiarum or A Discourse of Bees (1676), and Systema horti-culturae or The Art of Gardening (1677).

Currently, Epiphone is a subsidiary of Gibson and manufactures the G-400 and other budget models at a lower cost in Asia. Visually and ergonomically, it is almost identical to a 1962 SG.  History  Introduced in 19891989 Epiphone Catalog after Epiphone production moved to Korea in cooperation with the Samick Corporation, the G-400 has been in continuous production for thirty years. Upon introduction, it featured dot fretboard inlays, two open-coil humbuckers, green key tuners with the Epiphone logo stamped on their backs, a differently shaped truss rod cover with \\"Gibson\\" printed vertically, black \\"speed\\" knobs, and \\"narrow-open Book\\" headstock. By 1990, the G-400 was sporting the modern \\"clipped-ear\\" headstock with no holly inlay1990 Epiphone Catalog In 1996, several features of the G-400 were changed. These changes included black \\"top hat\\" knobs with silver inserts, trapezoidal fretboard inlays, chrome covers on the humbuckers, and a \\"holly\\" headstock inlay. Until 2002, the vast majority of G-400s were built in Korea by the Samick Corporation. Now, most G-400s are built in Epiphone's Qingdao, China plant. In 2002, Epiphone began using Grover tuners on the G-400. In 2004, the truss rod cover was changed to the current shape with \\"SG\\" printed on it. In 2005, the logo ink stamped on limited edition models was changed. In 2009, the G-400 (along with several other Epiphone models) made the switch from chrome-plated hardware to nickel-plated hardware. Also, the neck was changed to a \\"slim taper\\" profile. in 2012, Epiphone introduced the G-400 Pro with Alnico Classic PRO‚Ñ¢ 4-wire humbuckers. = Woods = The Epiphone G-400 is made of Philippine/Indonesian mahogany (more commonly known as Luan, Lauan or Meranti, botanic genus Shorea which has 196 subspecies), which is not actually related to the mahogany species. In 2005, Epiphone began putting thin veneers of African mahogany on the front and back of the Cherry finished G-400s. Features The design of the G-400 follows that of the Gibson SG. Features include dual pointed cutaways, smaller pickguard (but in some cases, such as the 1966 model or any limited edition model, there is still a large pickguard), set neck, trapezoidal fingerboard inlays (late 80s and early 90s models had dot inlays), dual humbucker pickups, and beveled mahogany body. The biggest visual differences from the Gibson SG are the Epiphone headstock and wood-bound neck. The standard G-400, not limited edition, is available in two finishes: ebony and cherry. The Faded G-400 comes in worn brown and worn cherry. In addition, new models now have Grover-brand machine heads. Variants The G-400 is available in many models, including G-400, Pro, Deluxe, Deluxe Flametop, Custom, Vintage, '66 Limited edition, SG Special, Tony Iommi Signature, Gothic and an Alpine White EMG pickup outfitted Limited Edition, the latter of which is very rare.

It is down the line from and is situated between and on the main line. It is managed by Great Western Railway, which also operates all the trains. It is an important junction, where the former Great Western Railway line to and , the main line to , and the South Wales Main Line via diverge. It is approximately from the central bus station and the town centre. It is served by GWR services from Paddington to Bristol Temple Meads, , Cheltenham Spa via Gloucester, and the rest of South Wales, and to .  History  The National Rail logo above the station can be seen from a distance and helps travellers locate it The main line of the Great Western Railway (GWR) was built and opened in stages. Construction began in late 1835, and by the end of August 1840 the line was open between and (later known as Challow), also between Bristol and Bath. The section from Faringdon Road to a temporary terminus at (near Wootton Bassett) was opened on 17 December 1840; this passed to the north of the market town of Swindon (now known as Old Town); but the only intermediate station opened at that time was at . Meanwhile, the Cheltenham and Great Western Union Railway had in 1836 been authorised to link the GWR with Gloucester and Cheltenham, and for this line, a junction at Swindon had been decided upon. The GWR line was planned by Isambard Kingdom Brunel to rise from both London and Bristol to a summit near Swindon, and to have easy gradients east of that summit, and steeper gradients to the west. Brunel, and his colleague Daniel Gooch, decided in October 1840 that one locomotive would not be able to manage the whole distance without taking on fuel; and it would be necessary to change locomotives part-way. Reading was chosen as one place to change engines, being both a major station and, at just under 36 miles, approximately one-third of the 118-mile distance from Paddington to Bristol. They also felt that it would be convenient to change locomotives at Swindon; not only was this almost two-thirds of the way (just over 77 miles) and the site of the junction for the Cheltenham line, it was also the summit of the line; and a train from London could have its fast locomotive replaced by a slower but more powerful locomotive for the journey on to Bristol. Accordingly, it was necessary to provide locomotive maintenance facilities at Swindon. The proximity of the North Wilts Canal was also a factor, since it would enable coke for the locomotives and coal for the workshops to be supplied from the Somerset Coalfield at a reasonable price. A station was then planned around the junction, and opened at the same time as the first portion of the Cheltenham line (from Swindon to and Cirencester); the GWR main line was extended from Hay Lane to on the same day, 31 May 1841. The GWR had engaged the Westminster firm of Messrs. J. & C. Rigby to build several stations, including all those between and ; this firm was also given the construction contracts for all of the buildings at Swindon, including the station and its refreshment rooms, the locomotive repair shops, 300 houses and other buildings needed for the workers. The GWR was short of money, and in late 1841 the contractors, instead of asking for payment, agreed to give Swindon station and its refreshment rooms to the GWR free of charge, and to lease back the refreshment rooms for 99 years at one (old) penny per year. Part of the deal was that In this \\"reasonable period\\", not only could the passengers be refreshed but the locomotive would also be changed. Messrs. Rigby would then be able to use the profits from the refreshment rooms to recover their financial outlay. Not long after the contract was finalised, Rigby then sublet the rights to S. Y. Griffiths of Cheltenham for seven years, for which Griffiths paid Rigby ¬£6,000 up front and then ¬£1,100 per year. Before this expired, Rigby sold the lease to J. R. Phillips for ¬£20,000 in August 1848. With the railway passing through the town in early 1841, the Goddard Arms public house in Old Swindon was used as a railway booking office in lieu of a station. Tickets purchased included the fare for a horse-drawn carriage to the line at the bottom of the hill. Swindon railway station opened in 1842 with construction of the GWR's engineering works continuing. Until 1895, every train stopped here for at least 10 minutes to change locomotives. Swindon station hosted the first recorded railway refreshment rooms, divided according to class. Swindonians, for a time, were eminently proud that even the current King and Queen of the time had partaken of refreshments there. The station in 1842 was built of three storeys, with the refreshment rooms on the ground floor, the upper floors comprising the station hotel and lounge. Until 1961, when Swindon Town station closed, the station was known as Swindon Junction. The original building was demolished in 1972, with today's modern station and office block erected on the site. The Travel Centre (booking office) at Swindon was APTIS-equipped by the end of October 1986, making it one of the first stations with the ticketing system which was eventually found across the UK at all staffed British Rail stations by the end of the 1980s.

Diagnostic Criteria 313.81 (F91.3) Unlike children with conduct disorder (CD), children with oppositional defiant disorder are not aggressive towards people or animals, do not destroy property, and do not show a pattern of theft or deceit.  History  Oppositional defiant disorder was first defined in the DSM-III (1980). Since the introduction of ODD as an independent disorder, the field trials to inform the definition of this disorder have included predominantly male subjects. Some clinicians have debated whether the diagnostic criteria presented above would be clinically relevant for use with females. Furthermore, some have questioned whether gender-specific criteria and thresholds should be included. Additionally, some clinicians have questioned the preclusion of ODD when conduct disorder is present. According to Dickstein, the DSM-5 attempts to: :\\"redefine ODD by emphasizing a 'persistent pattern of angry and irritable mood along with vindictive behavior,' rather than DSM-IV's focus exclusively on negativistic, hostile, and defiant behavior.' Although DSM-IV implied, but did not mention, irritability, DSM-5 now includes three symptom clusters, one of which is 'angry/irritable mood'‚Äîdefined as 'loses temper, is touchy/easily annoyed by others, and is angry/resentful.' This suggests that the process of clinically relevant research driving nosology, and vice versa, has ensured that the future will bring greater understanding of ODD\\".  Epidemiology  Oppositional defiant disorder has a prevalence of 1% to 11%. The average prevalence is approximately 3.3%. Gender and age play an important role in the rate of the disorder. In fact, ODD gradually develops and becomes apparent in preschool years; often before the age of eight years old. However, it is very unlikely to emerge following early adolescence. There is difference in prevalence between boys and girls. The ratio of this prevalence is 1.4 to 1 in favor of boys being more prevalent than girls before adolescence. On the other hand, girls' prevalence tends to increase after puberty. When researchers observed the general prevalence of oppositional defiant disorder throughout cultures, they noticed that it remained constant. However, the sex difference in ODD prevalence is only significant in Western cultures. There are two possible explanations for this difference which are that in non-Western cultures there is a decrease prevalence of ODD in boys or an increase prevalence of ODD in girls. Other factors can influence the prevalence of the disorder. One of these factors is the socioeconomic status. Youths living in families of low socioeconomic status have a higher prevalence. Another factor is based on the criteria used to diagnose an individual. When the disorder was first included in the DSM-III, the prevalence was 25% higher than when the DSM-IV revised the criteria of diagnosis. The DSM-V made more changes to the criteria grouping certain characteristics together in order to demonstrate that ODD display both emotional and behavioral symptomatology. In addition, criteria were added to help guide clinicians in diagnosis because of the difficulty found in identifying whether the behaviors or symptoms are directly related to the disorder or simply a phase in a child's life. Consequently, future studies may obtain results indicating a decline in prevalence between the DSM-IV and the DSM-V due to these changes.  Signs and symptoms  The fourth revision of the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual (DSM-IV-TR) (now replaced by DSM-5) stated that the child must exhibit four out of the eight signs and symptoms to meet the diagnostic threshold for oppositional defiant disorder. These symptoms include: # Often loses temper # Is often touchy or easily annoyed # Is often angry and resentful # Often argues with authority figures or for children and adolescents, with adults # Often actively defies or refuses to comply with requests from authority figures or with rules # Often deliberately annoys others # Often blames others for his or her mistakes or misbehavior # Has been spiteful or vindictive at least twice within the past 6 months.Disruptive, Impulse-Control, and Conduct Disorders. Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders: DSM-5. (2013). Arlington, VA: American Psychiatric Association.Oppositional defiant disorder. (2004). In W. E. Craighead, & C. B. Nemeroff (Eds.), The concise Corsini encyclopedia of psychology and behavioral science (3rd ed.). Hoboken, NJ: Wiley. Retrieved from https://search.credoreference.com/content/entry/wileypsych/oppositional_defiant_disorder/0 These behaviors are mostly directed towards an authority figure such as a teacher or a parent. Although these behaviors can be typical among siblings they must be observed with individuals other than siblings for an ODD diagnosis. Children with ODD can be verbally aggressive. However, they do not display physical aggressiveness, a behavior observed in conduct disorder. Furthermore, they must be perpetuated for longer than six months and must be considered beyond a normal child's age, gender and culture to fit the diagnosis. For children under 5 years of age, they occur on most days over a period of 6 months. For children over 5 years of age they occur at least once a week for at least 6 months. It is possible to observe these symptoms in only 1 setting, most commonly home. Thus the severity would be mild. If it is observed in two settings then it would be characterized as moderate and if the symptoms are observed in 3 or more settings then it would be considered severe. These patterns of behavior result in impairment at school and/or other social venues. =Etiology= There is no specific element that has yet been identified as directly causing ODD. Researchers looking precisely at the etiological factors linked with ODD are limited. The literature often examines common risk factors linked with all disruptive behaviors, rather than specifically about ODD. Symptoms of ODD are also often believed to be the same as CD even though the disorders have their own respective set of symptoms. When looking at disruptive behaviors such as ODD, research has shown that the causes of behaviors are multi factorial. However, disruptive behaviors have been identified as being mostly due either to biological or environmental factors.Goldstein, S., & In DeVries, M. (2017). Handbook of DSM-5 Disorders in Children and Adolescents. =Genetic influences= Research indicates that parents pass on a tendency for externalizing disorders to their children that may be displayed in multiple ways, such as inattention, hyperactivity, or oppositional and conduct problems. Research has also shown that there is a genetic overlap between ODD and other externalizing disorders. Heritability can vary by age, age of onset, and other factors. Adoption and twin studies indicate that 50% or more of the variance causing antisocial behavior is attributable to heredity for both males and females. ODD also tends to occur in families with a history of ADHD, substance use disorders, or mood disorders, suggesting that a vulnerability to develop ODD may be inherited. A difficult temperament, impulsivity, and a tendency to seek rewards can also increase the risk of developing ODD. New studies into gene variants have also identified possible gene-environment (G x E) interactions, specifically in the development of conduct problems. A variant of the gene that encodes the neurotransmitter metabolizing enzyme mono amine oxidase-A (MAOA), which relates to neural systems involved in aggression, plays a key role in regulating behavior following threatening events. Brain imaging studies show patterns of arousal in areas of the brain that are associated with aggression in response to emotion-provoking stimuli. =Prenatal factors and birth complications= Many pregnancy and birth problems are related to the development of conduct problems. Malnutrition, specifically protein deficiency, lead poisoning or exposure to lead, and mother's use of alcohol or other substances during pregnancy may increase the risk of developing ODD. In numerous research, substance abuse prior to birth has also been associated with developing disruptive behaviors such as ODD. Although pregnancy and birth factors are correlated with ODD, strong evidence of direct biological causation is lacking. =Neurobiological factors= Deficits and injuries to certain areas of the brain can lead to serious behavioral problems in children. Brain imaging studies have suggested that children with ODD may have subtle differences in the part of the brain responsible for reasoning, judgment and impulse control. Children with ODD are thought to have an overactive behavioral activation system (BAS), and under active behavioral inhibition system (BIS). The BAS stimulates behavior in response to signals of reward or non punishment. The BIS produces anxiety and inhibits ongoing behavior in the presence of novel events, innate fear stimuli, and signals of non reward or punishment. Neuroimaging studies have also identified structural and functional brain abnormalities in several brain regions in youths with conduct disorders. These brain regions are the amygdala, prefrontal cortex, anterior cingulate, and insula, as well as interconnected regions. =Social- cognitive factors= As many as 40 percent of boys and 25 percent of girls with persistent conduct problems display significant social-cognitive impairments. Some of these deficits include immature forms of thinking (such as ego centrism), failure to use verbal mediators to regulate his or her behavior, and cognitive distortions, such as interpreting a neutral event as an intentional hostile act. Children with ODD have difficulty controlling their emotions or behaviors. In fact, students with ODD have limited social knowledge that is based only on individual experiences, which shapes how they process information and solve problems cognitively. This information can be linked with the social information processing model (SIP) that describes how children process information in order to respond appropriately or inappropriately in social settings. This model explains that children will go through five stages before displaying behaviors: encoding, mental representations, response accessing, evaluation and enactment. However, children with ODD have cognitive distortions and impaired cognitive processes. This will therefore directly impact their interactions and relationship negatively. It has been shown that social and cognitive impairments result in negative peer relationships, loss of friendship and an interruption in socially engaging in activities. Children learn through observational learning and social learning. Therefore, observations of models have a direct impact and greatly influence children's behaviors and decision-making processes. Children often learn through modeling behavior. Modeling can act as a powerful tool to modify children's cognition and behaviors. =Environmental factors= Negative parenting practices and parent‚Äìchild conflict may lead to antisocial behavior, but they may also be a reaction to the oppositional and aggressive behaviors of children. Factors such as a family history of mental illnesses and/or substance abuse as well as a dysfunctional family and inconsistent discipline by a parent or guardian can lead to the development of behavior disorders. Parenting practices not providing adequate or appropriate adjustment to situations as well as high ratio of conflicting events within a family have been shown to be causal factors of risk for developing ODD. Insecure parent‚Äìchild attachments can also contribute to ODD. Often little internalization of parent and societal standards exists in children with conduct problems. These weak bonds with their parents may lead children to associate with delinquency and substance abuse. Family instability and stress can also contribute to the development of ODD. Although the association between family factors and conduct problems is well established, the nature of this association and the possible causal role of family factors continues to be debated. In a number of studies, low socioeconomic status has also been associated with disruptive behaviors such as ODD. Other social factors such as neglect, abuse, parents that are not involved, and lack of supervision can also contribute to ODD. Externalizing problems are reported to be more frequent among minority-status youth, a finding that is likely related to economic hardship, limited employment opportunities, and living in high-risk urban neighborhoods. Studies have also found that the state of being exposed to violence was also a contribution factor for externalizing behaviors to occur.  Diagnosis  For a child or adolescent to qualify for a diagnosis of ODD, behaviors must cause considerable distress for the family or interfere significantly with academic or social functioning. Interference might take the form of preventing the child or adolescent from learning at school or making friends, or placing him or her in harmful situations. These behaviors must also persist for at least six months. Effects of ODD can be greatly amplified by other disorders in comorbidity such as ADHD. Other common comorbid disorders include depression and substance use disorders. Management Approaches to the treatment of ODD include parent management training, individual psychotherapy, family therapy, cognitive behavioral therapy, and social skills training. According to the American Academy of Child and Adolescent Psychiatry, treatments for ODD are tailored specifically to the individual child, and different treatment techniques are applied for pre- schoolers and adolescents. = Psychopharmacological treatment = Psychopharmacological treatment is the use of prescribed medication in managing oppositional defiant disorder. Prescribed medication to control ODD include mood stabilizers, anti-psychotics, and stimulants. In two controlled randomized trials, it was found that between administered lithium and the placebo group, administering lithium decreased aggression in children with conduct disorder in a safe manner. However, in a third study it found the treatment of lithium over a period of two weeks invalid. Other drugs seen in studies include haloperidol, thioridazine, and methylphenidate which also is effective in treating ADHD, as it is a common comorbidity. Effectiveness of drug and medication treatment is not well established. Effects that can result in taking these medications include hypotension, extrapyramidal symptoms, tardive dyskinesia, obesity, and increase in weight. Psychopharmacological treatment is found to be most effective when paired with another treatment plan, such as individual intervention or multimodal intervention. In one case, a 16-year-old boy was given estrogen at an L. A. juvenile jail due to allegedly having ODD due to somewhat elevated testosterone levels, developing gynecomastia and requiring breast reduction surgery as a result. = Individual interventions = Individual interventions are focused on child specific individualized plans. These interventions include anger control/stress inoculation, assertiveness training, and child-focused problem solving skills training program, and self-monitoring skills. Anger control and stress inoculation helps prepare the child for possible upsetting situations or events that may cause anger and stress. It includes a process of steps they may go through. Assertiveness training educates individuals in keeping balance between passivity and aggression. It is about creating a response that is controlled, and fair. Child-focused problem solving skills training program aims to teach the child new skills and cognitive processes that teach how deal with negative thoughts, feelings and actions. = Parent and family treatment = According to randomized trials evidence shows that parent management training is most effective. It has strong influences over a longer period of time and in various environments. Parent-child interaction training is intended to coach the parents while involving the child. This training has two phases. The first phase being child-directed interaction, whereby it is focused on teaching the child non directive play skills. The second phase is parent directed interaction, where the parents are coached on aspects including clear instruction, praise for compliance, and time-out noncompliance. The parent-child interaction training is best suited for elementary aged children. Parent and family treatment has a low financial cost, that can yield an increase in beneficial results. = Multimodal intervention = Multimodal intervention is an ineffective treatment that looks at different levels including family, peers, school, and neighborhood. It is an intervention that concentrates on multiple risk factors. The focus is on parent-training, classroom social skills, and playground behavior program. The intervention is intensive and addresses barriers to individuals' improvement such as parental substance abuse or parental marital conflict. An impediment to treatment includes the nature of the disorder itself, whereby treatment is often not complied with and is not continued or stuck with for adequate periods of time.  Comorbidity  Oppositional defiant disorder can be described as a term or disorder with a variety of pathways in regard to comorbidity. A high importance must be given to the representation of ODD as a distinct psychiatric disorder independent of conduct disorder. In the context of oppositional defiant disorder and comorbidity with other disorders, researchers often conclude that ODD co-occurs with an attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), anxiety disorders, emotional disorders as well as mood disorders. Those mood disorders can be linked to major depression or bipolar disorder. Indirect consequences of ODD can also be related or associated with a later mental disorder. For instance, conduct disorder is often studied in connection with ODD. A strong comorbidity can be observed within those two disorders, but an even higher connection with ADHD in relations to ODD can be seen. For instance, children or adolescents who have ODD with coexistence of ADHD will usually be more aggressive, will have more of the negative behavioral symptoms of ODD and thus, inhibit them from having a successful academic life. This will be reflected in their academic path as students. Other conditions that can be predicted in children or people with ODD are learning disorders in which the person has significant impairments in regard to the academic area and language disorders in which problems can be observed related to language production and/or comprehension.

It traced its descent from a firm of instrument makers founded by William Elliott (1780 or 1781-1853) in London around 1804. The research laboratories were originally set up in 1946 at Borehamwood and the first Elliott 152 computer appeared in 1950. In its day the company was very influential. The computer scientist Bobby Hersom was an employee from 1953-1954, and Sir Tony Hoare was an employee there from August 1960 to 1968. He wrote an ALGOL 60 compiler for the Elliott 803. He also worked on an operating system for the new Elliott 503 Mark II computer.The Emperor's Old Clothes) The founder of the UK's first software house, Dina St Johnston, had her first programming job there from 1953‚Äì1958, and John Lansdown pioneered the use of computers as an aid to planning on an Elliott 803 computer in 1963. In 1966 the company established an integrated circuit design and manufacturing facility in Glenrothes, Scotland, followed by a metal‚Äìoxide semiconductor (MOS) research laboratory. In 1967, Elliott Automation was merged into the English Electric company and in 1968 the computer part of the company was taken over by International Computers and Tabulators (ICT). Origins William Elliott was born in either 1780 or 1781 and apprenticed to the instrument maker William Blackwell in 1795. In 1804, Elliott began his own company to make drawing instruments, scales, and scientific instruments. In 1850, his two sons Charles and Fredrick joined his business. The company prospered, and manufactured a range of surveying, navigational, and other instruments. William Elliott died in 1853. In the 1850s the company began manufacturing electrical instruments, which were used by researchers such as James Clerk Maxwell and others. Charles Elliott retired in 1865, and when Frederick died in 1873 he left the business to his wife Susan. In 1876, the company expanded to a new factory to manufacture telegraph equipment and instruments for the British Admiralty. There was increased demand for electrical switchboards for the growing electric power industry. Susan Elliott became partners with Willoughby Smith, who had significant expertise in telegraphic instruments; she was the last Elliott family member associated with the company when she died in 1880. Smith in turn brought his sons in to manage the company operations. In 1893, the instrument making company Theilers joined Elliotts, with W. O. Smith and G. K. E. Elphinstone as managers. Elphinstone had useful connections with the British Navy. He was knighted for his contributions at Elliotts during World War I, with developments in gunnery instruments for the Navy.Simon Lavington, Moving Targets: Elliott-Automation and the Dawn of the Computer Age in Britain, 1947 ‚Äì 67, Springer Science & Business Media, 2011 pages 13-17 In 1898, the company moved out of London to a new site in Kent. One of the main products at this site was naval gunnery tables, which were mechanical analog computers, which were manufactured until after the Second World War. Aircraft instruments became an important product line with the development of heavier than air flight; instruments such as tachometers and altimeters were vital in aviation. In 1916, the company changed its name to Elliott Brothers (London), Limited.http://rochesteravionicarchives.co.uk/about-us/history-elliott- brothers/ History of Elliott Brothers, retrieved 2017 Oct 12 In 1920, Siemens Brothers started purchasing shares of the company. The end of Admiralty contracts after the war severely affected Elliott Brothers, which had not been involved in radar and electronics technology during the war. Siemens Brothers had sold their interest in the company, and a new director, Leon Bagrit, was instrumental in rebuilding and redirecting the firm into new areas. In 1946, John Flavell Coales founded the Research Laboratories of Elliott Brothers at Borehamwood. This laboratory was the site of development of radar systems for the Government, and in 1947 produced a stored-program digital computer. By 1950 the laboratory had a staff of 450, and had developed the commercial Elliott 401 computer. In 1953, Elliott formed an \\"Aviation Division\\" at Borehamwood. In 1957, the company changed its name to Elliott Automation Ltd. By 1966, Elliott Automation had started their own semiconductor factory at Glenrothes, Scotland. The company had about 35,000 employees. In 1967 Elliott Automation was merged into the English Electric company. Elliott Automation The Elliott Automation logo Elliott Automation (as it had become) merged with English Electric in 1967. The data processing computer part of the company was then taken over by International Computers and Tabulators (ICT) in 1968; this marriage was forced by the British Government, who believed that the UK required a strong national computer company. The combined company was called International Computers Limited (ICL). The real-time computer part of Elliott Automation remained, and was renamed Marconi Elliott Computer Systems Limited in 1969 and GEC Computers Limited in 1972, and remained at the original Borehamwood research laboratories until the late 1990s. The agreement which governed the split of computer technologies between the two companies disallowed ICT from developing real-time computer systems and disallowed Elliott Automation from developing data processing computer systems for a few years after the split. The remainder of Elliott Automation which produced aircraft instruments and control systems, was retained by English Electric. EASAMS EASAMS was E A Space and Advanced Military Systems (the EA was never spelled out), based in Frimley, Surrey - first at the nearby Marconi Electronic Systems plant in Chobham Road and later, when it became a limited company, at its headquarters in Lyon Way. It evolved its proprietary EMPRENT, an early program evaluation and review technique (PERT) planning system used in building North Sea oil platforms, and for the BAC TSR-2. Developments for the cancelled TSR-2 were later incorporated into multirole combat aircraft (MRCA), which finally became the Panavia Tornado. EASAMS senior management was highly conservative, and a number of innovative engineers working on 'private venture' projects such as Hierarchical Object-Oriented Design (HOOD) and Ada language development left to form their own firms. These included Admiral Computing (which later merged with Logica), Systems Designers Ltd (which later merged with Electronic Data Systems (EDS) and later became part of Hewlett- Packard (HP) and Software Sciences (later a part of IBM UK). EASAMS Ltd was an independent company within General Electric Company plc (GEC), founded in 1962 to provide services in system design, operational research and project management. In the 1990s EASAMS became part of Marconi Electronic Systems before losing its identity.

All were shipped in robust \\"militarized\\" cases suitable for mounting in vehicles, ships and aircraft. **Civilian customers were sold versions of the 920A, 920B and 920C called Elliott 920A, 903 and 905 respectively. These were shipped in desk sized cabinets suitable for use in an office or laboratory environment. **Versions of the 920B and 920C for industrial automation were sold as Arch 900 and Arch900 respectively. These were shipped in industrial cabinets similar to those used for the civilian systems. ***The 903 903 was a desk-sized machine popular with universities and colleges as a teaching machine, with small research laboratories as a scientific processor and also as a versatile system for use in industrial process control. It was typically equipped with 8 or 16K of core store and was predominantly a paper tape based machine but card readers, line printers, incremental graph plotters and magnetic tape systems were also available. The machine was usually programmed in symbolic assembly code, Algol or Fortran II. The civilian 920C was the 905, also in a desk-sized configuration. Some 905s had fixed head disk systems attached. A Fortran IV system was provided for the 905. * Elliott 502 (1964) **One 502 used to generate simulated radar signals for training operators of Linesman/Mediator system. * Elliott 4100 series (1966) A joint development with NCR Corporation.

History The first homes in the area were laid out in the 1820s along the newly completed Louisville to Lexington turnpike, referred to in that stretch as Story Avenue. Two of the first landowners in the area, Whig Party loyalist George Buchanan and Isaac Stewart, had the new community's streets named after major Whig Party members, such as John Quincy Adams, Daniel Webster and Henry Clay. In the 1850s Beargrass Creek was rerouted away from what is now downtown Louisville and through the area, making it an ideal area for butchers and stockyards because the animal remains could be dumped in the creek and such businesses were banned in the downtown area for sanitation reasons. The population swelled as waves of German immigrants entered the area. Bourbon Stockyards, built in 1836, was the first stockyard to locate in Butchertown. A bank is in portions of the original building. Due to the high German population, and resentment of them by supporters of the Know Nothing party, Butchertown was where the \\"Bloody Monday\\" riots of August 1855 began as Know Nothings tried to prevent Germans and Irish from voting in an election. The riots killed 22 people. For the first 100 years of its existence, Butchertown was a thriving residential and industrial area, though other Louisville neighborhoods regarded it as a haven for drunkards and brawlers. However, the area began declining after the great Ohio River flood of 1937 destroyed many of the homes there. Many other homes were demolished for the construction of the Ohio River flood wall, the construction of interstates and the Kennedy Interchange (\\"Spaghetti Junction\\") through the area, and the expansion of industrial land into formerly residential areas. Suburbanization continued to bring the residential areas into decline, until the few remaining residents began lobbying for rezoning (the entire area was zoned as industrial), and fixing up vacant and underrepaired houses. Since the 1990s the area has attracted many young professionals. In recent years, the east Market Street area of downtown Louisville has seen a great deal of revitalization, including the expansion of Waterfront Park, Louisville Slugger Field, and the conversion of empty store fronts into new condominiums. This has helped spur further improvements in Butchertown itself, as many new antique shops and art galleries have opened off the Market Street corridor. A large condominium complex is planned near the Heigold House, and the former Big Four railroad bridge in the adjacent waterfront park has been converted into the longest pedestrian-only bridge in the world. In the 2000s, there were plans as part of the Ohio River Bridges Project to move the Kennedy Interchange further south when it was to be reconfigured by 2018, meaning that more buildings in Butchertown would be razed. However, these plans were scrapped in favor of reconfiguring the interchange in its existing location. Furthermore, the project included a second interstate bridge just east of the John F. Kennedy Memorial Bridge that opened as the Abraham Lincoln Bridge on December 6, 2015. The necessity of flyover ramps for the new bridge led to the demolishing of about one-third of Butchertown's David Armstrong Extreme Park, along with a rebuild of facilities on an adjacent property. Demographics As of 2000, the population of Butchertown was 975, of which Whites were 82.8%, Blacks were 7.2%, Hispanics were 5.3%, and other races were 4.7%. Males of all races were 60.1% of the population, while females were 39.9%. Attractions Thomas Edison House Butchertown contains several attractions, including the David Armstrong Extreme Park and Thomas Edison House, a shotgun house near where Thomas Edison lived in 1866 on Washington Street. The remaining front facade of the former early 19th century Heigold House, which features a detailed sketch of important early Whig Party leaders, displays the words \\"dedicated the greatest man in history, George Washington\\" etched across its front. The rest of the Fulton Street house has been razed. Butchertown is also known for its emergence of more modern shops, restaurants, and destination spots. Located on E. Washington Street is Copper & Kings, a brandy and absinthe distillery that offers daily tours and various community events. It is also home to an LGBT night club and a variety of newer eateries. Lynn Family Stadium, a soccer stadium for Louisville City FC, was planned to open in April 2020 at the eastern edge of the neighborhood, though the opening has since been delayed due to the coronavirus pandemic. It will anchor a larger complex of offices, retail, and hotel that is planned to open at a later date.

Since 1984, he has been a judge of the United States Court of Appeals for the First Circuit. He served as chief judge of that court from 1994 to 2001. He is the first and to date only Hispanic to serve on the First Circuit. Before becoming an appellate judge, he served from 1974 to 1984 on the U.S. District Court for the District of Puerto Rico. He is also a former competitive sailor, competing for the Puerto Rican team at the Summer Olympic Games in 1964, 1968, 1972, and 1976. Education and career Torruella was born in San Juan, Puerto Rico, in 1933. He received a B.S. degree from the Wharton School of the University of Pennsylvania in 1954, a J.D. from Boston University School of Law in 1957, an L.L.M. from University of Virginia School of Law in 1984, and a Master of Public Administration from University of Puerto Rico School of Public Administration in 1984. His LL.M work focused on judicial process. In 2003, Torruella received a Master of Studies in modern European history from Magdalen College, Oxford. Career as a lawyer Although he intended to practice law in Massachusetts following his graduation from law school, Torruella did not take the Massachusetts bar examination because he contracted a serious case of the mumps the day before the exam.Jose A. Fuentes-Agostinia & Gustavo A. Gelpi, Jr., \\"Judges Profile: The Honorable Juan R. Torruella,\\" Federal Lawyer (August 1997). He instead returned to Puerto Rico and was admitted to the bar there. He served as law clerk to Associate Justice Pedro Pimentel of the Puerto Rico Supreme Court, and then worked for three years for the National Labor Relations Board in an investigations and litigation role in Puerto Rico. His practice was mostly in civil law, including admiralty, aviation, and labor law, but he also served as court-appointed counsel in some criminal cases. Torruella was in private practice of law in San Juan from 1959 to 1974, where he handled cases in both the federal courts and the Puerto Rico courts. He first worked at the law firm of Fiddler, Gonzalez & Rodriguez for eight years, becoming a partner at the firm. Torruella then became a solo practitioner, and then practiced law in partnership with Jaime Pieras, Jr., who later became a federal district judge. Federal judicial service =District court= Torruella was nominated by President Gerald Ford on November 18, 1974, to a seat on the United States District Court for the District of Puerto Rico vacated by Judge Hiram Rafael Cancio. He was confirmed by the United States Senate on December 18, 1974, and received his commission two days later. He served as Chief Judge from 1982 to 1984. His service was terminated on October 30, 1984, due to his elevation to the First Circuit. In 1979, Torruella was the judge in various criminal trespass cases against demonstrators who entered a beach in Vieques to protest its use by the U.S. Navy. Torruella ordered that the demonstrators receive separate trials. Some defendants were sentenced to prison; others received six-month suspended sentences. Some of the demonstrators were radical pro- independence advocates and refused to acknowledge the federal court's jurisdiction or to defend themselves at trial.Puerto Ricans Vow to Avenge Death in U.S. Prison, New York Times (November 18, 1979).Radicals Say Attack on Bus Is Retaliation for 3 Deaths, New York Times (December 4, 1979). The Vieques cases were the highest-profile of Torruella's cases over his decade as a district judge. =First Circuit= Torruella was nominated by President Ronald Reagan on August 1, 1984, to the United States Court of Appeals for the First Circuit, to a new seat created by 98 Stat. 333. The First Circuit is the U.S. court of appeals covering Massachusetts, New Hampshire, Maine, Rhode Island, and Puerto Rico. He was confirmed by the Senate on October 3, 1984,PN1037 ‚Äî Juan R. Torruella del Valle ‚Äî The Judiciary, 98th Congress (1983-1984), Congress.gov. by voice vote. He received his commission the following day, becoming the first Puerto Rican to serve on the circuit court bench. Jos√© A. Fust√© replaced Torruella on the district bench.PN614 ‚Äî Jose Antonio Fuste ‚Äî The Judiciary: 99th Congress (1985-1986), Congress.gov. Torruella served as chief judge of the First Circuit from 1994 to 2001. Although his length of service entitles him to take senior status, Torruella has chosen to remain a judge on active service.Ruggero J. Aldisert, A Nonagenarian Discusses Life as a Senior Circuit Judge, 14 J. App. Prac. & Process 183, 188-89 (2012). Notable decisions and work Torruella has consistently been an advocate of Puerto Rican rights and dissented from a 2005 ruling en banc First Circuit decision that Puerto Ricans are properly denied a voice in the election of the president of the United States because Puerto Rico is not a state.Igartua-de la Rosa v. United States, 417 F.3d 145 (1st Cir. 2005). In August 2017, Torruella wrote a lengthy dissent when the en banc circuit rejected a lawsuit challenging Puerto Rico's exclusion from congressional apportionment.. Torruella is the author of the book The Supreme Court and Puerto Rico: The Doctrine of Separate and Unequal (University of Puerto Rico: 1988), a study of the Supreme Court's decisions in the Insular Cases, in which Torruella argues that \\"colonial rule and the indignities of second-class citizenship can be ended not, as in the case of the Philippines, by granting the colony its independence ... but rather, by securing for Puerto Rico equality under American law\\" including Puerto Rican statehood. The book was favorably reviewed by Judge Jos√© A. Cabranes in the Harvard Law Review. In a 2018 article, Torruella argued that \\"Puerto Rico's colonial relationship to the United States throughout the United States' various 'experiments' with Puerto Rico and its people, although variously labeled for political purposes and constitutionally denominated an 'unincorporated territory,' has merely perpetuated the inherent inequality of the United States citizens who reside in Puerto Rico as compared to the rest of the nation, and is the major cause of the Island's economic crisis.\\" Torruella authored the First Circuit opinion in Planned Parenthood of Northern New England v. Heed (2004), in which the court upheld the district court's decision declaring New Hampshire's \\"parental notification\\" abortion law unconstitutional, and enjoining its enforcement. The decision held that the state law was inconsistent with the Constitution and relevant Supreme Court constitutional decisions in Roe v. Wade, Stenberg v. Carhart, and Planned Parenthood of Southeastern Pennsylvania v. Casey.Planned Parenthood v. Heed, 390 F.3d 53 (1st Cir. 2004). The case later went to the Supreme Court in Ayotte v. Planned Parenthood of Northern New England (2006).Ayotte v. Planned Parenthood of N. New Eng., 546 U.S. 320 (2006). In 2009, Torruella wrote the opinion in Noonan v. Staples, Inc., allowing a suit for libel to proceed because even though the statements at issue were true they reflected \\"actual malice.\\" (Under the law in Massachusetts and elsewhere in the U.S., truth is usually an absolute defense to libel, but Massachusetts law contains an exception if the defendant made the statement with \\"actual malice.\\")..Noonan v. Staples, Inc., 556 F. 3d 20 (1st Cir. 2009). Torruella's decision did not decided the question of whether this exception was inconsistent with the Constitution's First Amendment because the argument was raised too late in the proceedings. A Harvard Law Review comment indicated that \\"the court's analysis serves as an indication that, had the constitutional claim been appropriately asserted, the law would not have survived.\\" In 2012, Torruella joined a unanimous First Circuit panel decision (written by Judge Michael Boudin) in Massachusetts v. United States Department of Health and Human Services. The decision struck down section 3 of the Defense of Marriage Act (DOMA), which denied federal benefits to all same- sex couples, even those legally married under state law.Lyle Denniston, DOMA ban on gay marriage falls (FINAL UPDATE), SCOTUSBlog (May 31, 2012).Massachusetts v. U.S. Dep't of Health & Human Services, 682 F.3d 1 (2012). In 2015, Torruella dissenting from a First Circuit decision denying Dzhokhar Tsarnaev's request for a writ of mandamus compelling the district court to grant a change of venue of Tsarnaev's trial due to widespread pretrial publicity.In re Tsarnaev, 780 F.3d 14 (1st Cir. 2015) (per curiam). In July 2020, Torruella joined the opinion of Judge O. Rogeriee Thompson in vacating the federal death sentence of convicted Boston Marathon bomber Dzhokhar Tsarnaev, on the basis of legal errors in the sentencing proceedings. The First Circuit remanded to the district court for a new penalty phase. In a concurring opinion, Torruella wrote that he would have gone further to hold that the district court's denials of Tsarnaev's motions for change of venue were an abuse of discretion that \\"denied Tsarnaev the right to a fair trial and sentencing determination,\\" given the huge media coverage of the bombing in the Boston area. Torruella cited the precedent in the trial of Timothy McVeigh for the Oklahoma City bombing, in which a change of venue to Denver was granted.David Abel, Travis Andersen, Tonya Alanez and Milton J.

Tsarnaev (1st Cir. 2020). Sailing career Torruella competed for Puerto Rico in four Olympic sailing events: * 1964: Enoshima in the Finn (31st) * 1968: Acapulco in the Flying Dutchman (28th) * 1972: Kiel in the Flying Dutchman (27th) * 1976: Kingston in the Soling (22nd) Torruella was captain of the Puerto Rican team in each of the four Olympics. He also competed in the 1975 and 1979 Pan American Games. In the 1984 Summer Olympic Games in Los Angeles, Torruella served as a coach; he was informed of his appointment to the First Circuit while coaching in summer 1974. As a yachtsman, Torruella has made several long-distance sea voyages, including two trans-Atlantic crossings in 1992, on the 500th anniversary of Columbus's first voyage; a few years later, Torruella undertook an 8,000-mile sailing trip across the Caribbean Sea and Panama Canal to the Pacific Ocean, where he visited the Gal√°pagos Islands and Port Montt, Chile, before traveling to Buenos Aires, Argentina, via Cape Horn. Personal life Torruella met his wife, Judy, as a law student; they had four children, and also grandchildren.

It was a Military Airlift Command (MAC) and United States Air Forces in Europe (USAFE) installation, occupying the south side of Frankfurt Airport. Its military airport codes are discontinued. Established in 1945, Rhein-Main Air Base was the primary airlift and passenger hub for United States forces in Europe. It was billed as the \\"Gateway to Europe\\". It closed on 30 December 2005. During its lifetime, the base's host airlift wing operated C-130 Hercules and Douglas C-9 Nightingale aircraft, as well as supporting many transient C-5 Galaxy, C-141 Starlifter, C-17 Globemaster III, KC-135 Stratotanker and KC-10 Extender flight operations each day. Daily or weekly contract air passenger flights were also conducted for United States personnel arriving in or leaving Europe. Arrival After the U.S. 7th Army moved through the Frankfurt area, the 826th Engineer Aviation Battalion (EAB), a unit of the IX Engineer Command, arrived at Frankfurt/Rhein-Main Airfield on 26 April 1945. It was classified as Advanced Landing Ground (ALG) Y-73. On 11 May 1945, the engineers began the task of clearing rubble and reconstructing major buildings. The Army engineers built new runways, aprons and hardstands, and taxiways leading to the terminal, as well as extending and widening the existing runway. Frankfurt/Rhein-Main Airfield was initially used by the Ninth Air Force as a tactical fighter base. Tactical air groups stationed at the airfield were: * 362d Fighter Group (8 April 1945 - 30 April 1945) * 377th Fighter Group (14 April 1945 - 2 May 1945) * 378th Fighter Group (14 April 1945 - 2 May 1945) * 379th Fighter Group (8 April 1945 - 30 April 1945) * 425th Night Fighter Squadron (12 April 1945 - 2 May 1945) Air Transport The initial USAAF transport unit at Rhein-Main was the 466th Air Service Group, activated on 20 November 1945. The 466th operated the aerial port, with a mixture of C-47 Skytrain, C-46 Commando, and C-54 Skymaster transport aircraft using the base for transport operations. The Rhein-Main transport passenger and cargo terminal was completed in 1946, and air traffic into Rhein-Main increased after the closure of the military passenger terminal at Orly Air Base, France, in March 1947, when the USAFE Eastern Air Transport Service opened its hub at Rhein-Main. The 61st Troop Carrier Group was reassigned to Rhein-Main on 30 September 1946 from nearby Eschborn Air Base and assumed control of the transport mission, carrying out routine transport operations from the base using C-47s and C-54s. Troop Carrier Squadrons of the 61st TCG were the 14th, 15th, and 53rd. At Rhein-Main Air Base, military and civilian supplies from Glessen Quartermaster Depot arrive in trucks of the 67th Transportation Company for transfer to waiting aircraft during the Berlin Airlift. Berlin Airlift Memorial (built in 1985). Memorial with a Douglas C-47 Skytrain (USAF) nearby. Berlin Airlift The ongoing dispute over Berlin strained relations between the Soviet Union and the Western Allies (United States, United Kingdom, France). On 24 June 1948, the Soviet Union blocked access to the three Western-held sectors of Berlin, which lay deep within the Soviet-controlled zone of Germany, by cutting off all rail and road routes going through Soviet-controlled territory in Germany. The commander of the American occupation zone in Germany, General Lucius D. Clay, USA, gave the order on 25 June to launch a massive airlift using both civil and military aircraft. Rhein-Main Air Base became the main American terminal in western Germany for the airlift. The aircraft of the 61st TCG participated using C-54 Skymasters to ferry coal, flour, and other cargo into West Berlin. Additional Troop Carrier Squadrons were assigned to the 61st group, these being the 20th, 48th, and 54th. On 19 November 1948, the 513th Troop Carrier Group (Special) was activated at Rhein-Main Air Base to assist in the airlift, also using C-54s. Squadrons of the 513th were the 313th, 330th, 331st, 332d, and 333d. The Soviet Union lifted its blockade at 00:01, on 12 May 1949. However, the airlift did not end until 30 September, as the Western nations wanted to build up sufficient amounts of supplies in West Berlin in case the Soviets blockaded it again. 1949-1959 Although originally envisioned as a bomber base by USAFE, as a result of the Berlin Airlift, Rhein-Main became a principal European air transport terminal. With the end of the blockade, the 513th TCG was inactivated on 16 October 1949. The 61st TCG returned to routine transport operations until the outbreak of the Korean War. The 61st was reassigned to McChord Air Force Base, Washington on 21 July 1950. The 61st was replaced by the 60th Troop Carrier Wing, which transferred from Wiesbaden Air Base, West Germany on 2 June 1950. The 60th was equipped with the heavier C-82 Packet cargo aircraft. In 1953, the C-119 Flying Boxcar arrived, bringing an increased cargo capability to the wing. The 60th TCW consisted of the following squadrons: * 10th Troop Carrier Squadron * 11th Troop Carrier Squadron * 12th Troop Carrier Squadron In 1955, with the opening of USAFE bases in France, most heavy transport flights were shifted there and Rhein-Main became a passenger and tactical cargo hub. The 60th Troop Carrier Wing relocated to Dreux-Louvillier Air Base, France on 15 October 1955. The 1614th Support Squadron of the Military Air Transport Service's (MATS) 1602d Air Transport Wing headquartered at Chateauroux, France provided aircraft maintenance, passenger services, air cargo handling, hotel operations and airlift operational support during the 1950s and 1960s. Rhein-Main was placed under the 7310th Air Base Wing, which for over a decade provided ground service as well as cargo and passenger loading and unloading for USAFE and MATS transports. During the Cold War, the dependents of military and government personnel living on base or in the surrounding communities attended Gail S. Halvorsen Elementary School, Rhein-Main Elementary School, William H. Tunner Middle School, Rhein-Main Junior High School, and Frankfurt American High School.American Overseas Schools Historical Society USAFE turned over the northern part of the base to the German government for use as Flughafen Frankfurt am Main, the chief commercial airport for the greater Frankfurt area, in April 1959. The remainder of the base stayed in USAF hands as the principal aerial port for the Department of Defense in Germany.  435th Tactical Airlift Wing  C-5As flown from Rhein-Main AB being offloaded in the Middle East during Operation Desert Shield. U.S. Air Force C-17 Globemaster IIIs and C-141 Starlifters are parked on the ramp at Rhein-Main Air Base, Germany, on 26 December 1995. The aircraft are being used to deploy troops and equipment for the NATO Implementation Force (IFOR) in Bosnia and Herzegovina and neighboring countries in support of Operation Joint Endeavor. The 1966 closure of USAFE bases in France increased cargo traffic at Rhein-Main extensively. On 1 July 1969, MAC transferred the 435th Tactical Airlift Wing from RAF High Wycombe in the United Kingdom to Rhein-Main as host unit and upgraded its facilities. Squadrons assigned to Rhein-Main along with the 435th TAW were: * 37th Tactical Airlift Squadron (assigned 1 October 1977) (Lockheed C-130 Hercules) * 55th Aeromedical Airlift Squadron (assigned 31 March 1975) (McDonnell Douglas C-9A Nightingale)Ravenstein, p.230 * 630th Military Airlift Support Squadron (MASSq) There were also other Military Airlift Command Squadrons in USAFE, notably at Torrej√≥n AB in Spain and In√ßirlik AB in Turkey, which were made part of the 435th TAW. The 630th MASSq operated Rhein-Main's freight and passenger terminals and provided aircraft maintenance for transitory Boeing C-17 Globemaster III, C-141 Starlifter and C-5 Galaxy aircraft supporting aerial ports in Europe, the Middle East, and Africa. TDY support of missions was not uncommon. Rhein-Main AB was the principal Port of Entry for all U.S. servicemen and women serving in West Germany as well as military and diplomatic air freight destined for U.S. bases and embassies throughout Europe, the Middle East, and Africa. The 37th TAS took part in airlift operations during Operations Desert Shield/Storm in Southwest Asia (the Middle East), from 14 August 1990 ‚Äì 29 March 1991. It also air-dropped humanitarian supplies in Operation Provide Comfort for the relief of fleeing Kurdish refugees in northern Iraq in April‚ÄìMay 1991. The 37th AS conducted airlift and airdrop missions to Bosnia and Herzegovina for Operation Provide Promise, starting July 1992. The 55th Aeromedical Airlift Squadron flew aeromedical missions throughout Europe, Africa and the Middle East. On 1 July 1975, the USAF and Military Airlift Command entered into an agreement with the Federal Republic of Germany that only transport aircraft would be stationed at Rhein-Main Air Base. Events of note at Rhein-Main Air Base: * On December 10, 1978, the first group of military dependents evacuated from Iran on C-141s landed in Rhein-Main after leaving Tehran late the day before. They had spent the first night in Athens, their second leg of the trip was to Rhein-Main and then they were transported to McGuire Air Force Base. Each plane held approximately 150 women and children. * On January 20, 1981, the American hostages held during the Iran hostage crisis were flown to Rhein-Main in a C-9A Nightingale aeromedical aircraft. * On 23 October 1983, the bombing of the Marine barracks in Beirut, Lebanon occurred. Rhein Main AB was instrumental in the processing of the casualties from that bombing in the days and weeks to follow. 241 military personnel perished in the blast. * On August 8, 1985, the Red Army Faction terrorist group snuck a car laden with explosives onto the base and parked it behind the headquarters building. At approximately 7:15 AM the car exploded, killing Airman first class Frank Scarton of Michigan and Becky Jo Bristol of San Antonio, Texas, and wounding 20 others. * In 1990, Rhein-Main Air Base was a major staging base for supplies and equipment heading to the Gulf War.  Post-Cold War use  The U.S. staged Operation Provide Hope, a symbolic yet substantial airlift in February 1992 to the former Soviet Union, from Rhein-Main AB. A closing ceremony to the airlift phase (a much larger ground phase of Operation Provide Hope began in the spring) was held in late February at Rhein-Main AB, using a Russian Antonov An-124 cargo aircraft to transport the last shipment of air- delivered supplies. On 1 April 1992 the 435th TAW was realigned from Military Airlift Command (MAC) to United States Air Forces in Europe (USAFE) and redesignated as the 435th Airlift Wing (435 AW). The 37th Tactical Airlift Squadron (37 TAS) became the 37th Airlift Squadron (37 AS) on the same date. At its peak, Rhein-Main AB had a population of 10,000. However, by 1993, USAF officials announced the intent to downsize the base by half. On 1 July 1993, the 55th Aeromedical Airlift Squadron moved to Ramstein Air Base with its C-9A Nightingale aircraft. The 37th Airlift Squadron was subsequently reassigned to Ramstein on 1 October 1994. With these moves completed and most heavy Air Mobility Command (AMC) airlifters moving transcontinental cargo and passenger traffic to Ramstein and Spangdahlem Air Base, the stage was set for a complete closure in 2005. On 1 April 1995, the 435 AW was inactivated. The 435 AW was replaced by the 469th Air Base Group under USAFE and the 726th Air Mobility Squadron (726 AMS) under AMC. The 469 ABG inactivated on 10 October 2005. The 726th Air Mobility Squadron was the last unit at the base. From September 2001 until 2005, Rhein-Main continued to provide support for transient C-130, C-141, C-17, C-5, KC-135, KC-10 and AMC-chartered civilian airliners supporting both US military activities throughout Europe, as well as a waypoint for air mobility operations throughout Southwest Asia towards the wars in Afghanistan and Iraq. Special Operations Lockheed C-130A-LM Hercules, AF Serial No. 54-1637 of the 7406th Operations Squadron Although the major mission of Rhein-Main Air Base was strategic and tactical airlift, the base also operated a substantial special operations mission. The 7406th Operations Squadron was activated at Rhein-Main on 10 May 1955 and received its first aircraft (RB-50s) in March 1956. The RB-50s were replaced with specially configured C-130A-II reconnaissance aircraft in 1958. The 7406th owned and maintained the aircraft and provided the flight crews. A separate USAF Security Service squadron provided the crew that manned the intelligence collection positions on the aircraft. One of these C-130s (56-0528) was shot down with the loss of a crew of seventeen over Yerevan, Soviet Armenia on 2 September 1958.See Tart, Larry and Keefe, Robert. The Price of Vigilance: Attacks on American Surveillance Flights. NY: Ballantine Books, 2001. 656 p. Four Soviet MiG-17 pilots took turns firing on the unarmed C-130 when the American aircraft penetrated Soviet airspace while on a mission along the Turkish-Armenian border. Between June 5‚Äì10, 1967, during the Arab-Israeli Six- Day War, the 7406th flew dangerous, unarmed missions over the battle gathering electronic intelligence data. The 7406th continued flying recon missions from Rhein-Main in the C-130B models until 30 June 1973 when the squadron's sister Security Service flying squadron moved to Ellinikon International Airport, near Athens, Greece (known to the U.S. as Hellenikon AB). Operational missions were flown until 13 June 1974 from Greece when the unit was disbanded. The 7206th nomenclature continued, embodied in the 7206th Air Base Group which was a support group in Athens until 1993. Surveillance missions continued at Hellenikon under the auspices of the 6916th ESS. MC-130E of the 7th Special Operations Squadron With the relocation of the 7406th to Greece, the 7th Special Operations Squadron was moved from Ramstein to Rhein-Main as one of the units shuffled as part of Operation Creek Action. The 7406th's Hercules had been used for covert communications intelligence (COMINT) missions along the Eastern Bloc borders. The 7th SOS's MC-130Es, code-named 'Combat Talon', were no less mysterious and were also striking to look at with their matte black camouflage scheme and two large hooks on the nose. The 7th SOS's MC-130Es were spotted in every corner of Europe. The 7th SOS was reassigned to the 7575th Operations Group in 1977, and then to the 39th Aerospace Rescue and Recovery Wing on 1 February 1987. It was relocated to RAF Alconbury in the United Kingdom in December 1992, coming under a different group in the process. The 7575th Operations Group operated at Rhein-Main from 1 July 1977 to 31 March 1991. Initially, three unique units were assigned to the group: the 7405th Operations Squadron, the 7580th Operations Squadron, and the 7th Special Operations Squadron. The 7405th had recently moved from Wiesbaden Air Base and converted to flying heavily modified C-130E Hercules airlifters. The 7580th was staffed with electronic warfare officers and specialized aircraft maintenance personnel who flew in the back of or maintained the 7405th's aircraft. The mission of the 7405th and 7580th was to conduct covert reconnaissance flights through the West Berlin Air Corridor, also known as the Berlin corridors and control zone. Closure On 23 December 1999, the U.S. and German governments agreed to close the base. The last military passenger and cargo flights took place in late September 2005 and the base's formal closure ceremony took place on 10 October 2005. The final handover to the German government occurred on 30 December 2005 and the 726th AMS transferred to Spangdahlem Air Base. The Frankfurt Airport Authority has leveled the entire base, and in October 2015, commenced building a third passenger terminal (Terminal 3) and other airport facilities. Fraport Website on Construction of Terminal 3 In 2019, it became known that excavated soil from the construction site for Terminal 3 was contaminated with PFAS chemicals with the volume of polluted soil being approximately 600,000 cubic metres. It was considered highly probable that the contamination originated with firefighting foams which had been used by the USAFE, primarily for training purposes.

It is probable that he died in or about 1265, when his chronicle ceases. Chronicle Taxster's chronicle forms part of the Chronica Buriensis, or Chronicle of Bury St Edmunds, in which he was followed by two other writers. His sources, where borrowed from other chronicles, have been identified. Original writing starts at 1212. An edition of the chronicle for the period 1212 to 1301 was published in 1964 by Antonia Gransden. The chronicle for the period 1258‚Äì1263 was printed by H. R. Luard in his edition of Cotton (Rolls Series). The work, which in the earlier part is compiled from Florence of Worcester, William of Malmesbury, and Ralph de Diceto, begins with the creation of the world. The description of contemporary events was subsequently used by John de Everisden, Johannes de Oxenedes, and Bartholomew Cotton. Taxster's chronicle exists in two manuscripts, one in the British Museum (Cott., Julius, A. 1.), the other in the College of Arms (Arundelian Manuscript, 6).

The design reflected developments of the Pacific campaign, including long range and the ability to efficiently Replenish At Sea (RAS). Statistics =Size= Dianas standard displacement was 3,610 tons. Length and beam of the ship are and respectively, she was capable of steaming at over . The normal peacetime complement of Diana was 297 officers and men. =Launch= The ship was built at Clydebank, Glasgow, by Yarrow and Co. Ltd. (Yard No 1846 ), laid down 3 April 1947 and launched Thursday 8 May 1952 by Lady McGrigor, wife of Admiral of the Fleet Sir Rhoderick McGrigor, and first commissioned 29 March 1954. Originally the name was to be Druid but this changed to Diana during construction. At the time Diana was considered a large destroyer, being nearly as big as a pre-war light cruiser. The Daring class was a logical outcome of the Pacific War, where the ability to stay at sea for long periods was of prime importance. =Armament= The main armament consisted of six dual purpose guns in three totally enclosed turrets, two forward, one aft. At the time of building the control system for the guns was the most advanced in the Royal Navy, being completely radar controlled. The guns were considered, at the time, highly accurate with a high rate of fire. In summary her armament was: (1960) *Six 4.5 inch guns *Two 40 mm Bofors Guns *Five torpedo tubes *One triple Squid anti-submarine mortar =Electrical supply= The ship's electrical power was produced by two turbine generators and three diesel generators. The current used was 440 volts, 60 cycle alternating current (AC) power. Of the eight Darings, four ships were designed to operate on direct current (DC) for their electrical supply and four to operate on AC. The object was a practical test to determine which form of electrical supply was the most practical. Diana was an AC ship, as were all Royal Navy ships following this 'test'. =Propulsion= *Engines by Parsons *Propulsion: geared turbine, 2 shaft =Name, goddess and crest= \\"This Diana of ours is a very demanding person, goddesses tend to be that way\\" Captain G. J. Kirkby, DSC **, Royal Navy, Captain, HMS Diana 1961. The ship's Commission book of 1961 describes Diana (the goddess) as having a distinctly complex personality. Apart from being the huntress, by the light of the sun she was pure and chaste; by the light of the moon, however, she became abandoned and dark. See Diana (goddess). Career Diana at sea, 1954 Diana saw action during the Suez Crisis, when on 31 October 1956, she sank the , which was engaged in a one-sided gun duel with the cruiser in the Red Sea, marking the last time a ship was sunk by another in conflict using gunfire alone. =South Pacific atomic tests controversy= In 1956 Diana was ordered into the radioactive fallout zone of two nuclear weapon tests codenamed Mosaic 1 and Mosaic 2 near the Monte Bello Islands in the Indian Ocean. The aim of the order, given by British defence officials, was to discover the effects of atomic fallout, both on the ship itself and upon its 308-strong crew. Since the exposure, around two-thirds of the crew have died, and survivors attest that a variety of fallout-related diseases are responsible. The ship's then- captain, John Gower, who died in 2007 aged 95, wrote after sailing through the fallout zone that he much disliked having to 'continue to serve in a ship, parts of which had been unacceptably radioactive'. As of January 2008, the British Ministry of Defence has refused to pay compensation to the remaining crew of Diana, citing a legal technicality that all such claims must be lodged within three years of the diagnosis to which they refer. According to newspaper reports, the decision may see the collapse of the claimants' case, or at the least delay the compensation until 2012, at which time more of the ship's crew may have died. This incident is referred to in the SAS drama Ultimate Force by Ross Kemp's character, SSGt Garvie, who claims his father was a crew member at that time. On 26 January 1968, Diana was on passage from Gibraltar to Malta when she was ordered to divert to the search for the Israeli submarine Dakar, which had gone missing on her delivery trip from Britain to Israel. After calling at Malta to pick up a medical officer and diving experts, Diana was on course to the search zone when she picked up a distress signal from the Spanish tanker MV Bahia Blanca, which was on fire. After helping Bahia Blancas crew to extinguish the fire, Diana continued to the search area, taking part in the search operations until 31 January. =Sale to the Peruvian Navy= Diana in the Peruvian Navy in September 1973 renamed BAP Palacios (DM-73) HMS Diana was acquired by the Peruvian Navy in 1969 together with sister ship . Renamed , the ship was refitted at Cammell Laird, Birkenhead. The refit comprised enclosing the foremast and installing a Plessey AWS-1 radar. The destroyer's armament was further increased with the addition of eight Exocet surface-to-surface missiles in two quadruple mountings.Gardiner and Chumbley 1995. p. 304 Palacios was commissioned in April 1973. In 1975, a helicopter landing area was installed which was expanded with the addition of a hangar in 1977-78. This necessitated the removal of the aft 4.5 in gun. The gun was later re-installed and the hangar removed. The refit in 1977-78 also saw the streamlining of the funnel which was also raised, the installation of a Selenia NA-10 director aft for the upgraded twin Breda Bardo 40mm gun mounts and the removal of the Squid mortar and sonar. Palacios served until 1993 when she was stricken.

He finally took possession in 1567 and began construction of a Tudor mansion.\\"Parishes: Waltham St Lawrence\\", from website British History Online (Accessed 13 September 2007). With the identification in 2005 of the younger Sir Henry Neville as a candidate for the authorship of the Shakespearean plays and sonnets, it is conceivable that some of those works might have been composed at Billingbear.

Before the islands of Puerto Rico came under United States sovereignty in 1898, Protestantism was suppressed under Roman Catholic Spanish rule. History In Monta√±a, Aguadilla, a group called \\"los b√≠blicos\\" met clandestinely under the direction of Antonio Badillo. Many freethinkers and Protestants belonged to Masonic lodges, as many in the older generation still do. In 1872, the first Protestant church was established in Puerto Rico, when Bishop W. W. Jackson, from the Anglican dioceses of Antigua provided for the creation of the Holy Trinity Anglican Church in Ponce, followed several years later by All Saints Anglican Church in Vieques. Soon after the change of sovereignty, United States Protestant denominations agreed to divide the island in order to facilitate missionary penetration. The two existing Anglican churches in Ponce and Vieques served as the basis for a new diocese of the Episcopal Church of the United States, which has since had six diocesan bishops. Presbyterians, Methodists, Baptists, Congregationalists and Disciples of Christ started the missionary work. While the President appointed the governors, these denominations were influential in government policies. After the 1940s this changed; nevertheless Protestantism kept growing, particularly Pentecostalism, which grew mostly among the poor and the rural.  Institutions  Mainline Protestants started educational and health institutions. Presbyterians founded InterAmerican University,InterAmerican University with 11 campuses and 40,000 students, and Ashford Presbyterian Hospital in San Juan. Seventh-day Adventists founded Adventist University near Mayag√ºez. In 1907, the Episcopal Church established St. Luke's Hospital in Ponce, the centerpiece of a multi-hospital health services organization today. An interdenominational Seminary, Seminario Evang√©lico de Puerto Rico was begun in 1909. There is a Council of Churches, founded by the cooperating denominations of the original community agreement. In 1940, Juanita Garcia Peraza and her followers founded the \\"Mita\\" congregation, the only Protestant religion of Puerto Rican origin.Latin American issues Vol. 3  Present situation  Estimates of the Protestant population vary greatly. The CIA World Factbook estimates that 85% of the population is Roman Catholic while the remaining 15% are Protestants and other religions. Pollster Pablo Ramos stated in 1998 that the population was 38% Roman Catholic, 28% Pentecostal, and 18% were members of independent churches, which would give a Protestant percentage of 46% if the last two populations are combined. Protestants collectively added up to almost two million people. \\"The conclusion is that Puerto Rico is no longer predominantly Catholic.\\"The San Juan Star, Sunday, 12 April 1998: \\"Study reflects growing numbers of churchgoers\\". Another researcher gave a more conservative assessment of the proportion of Protestants: \\"Puerto Rico, by virtue of its long political association with the United States, is the most Protestant of Latin American countries, with a Protestant population of approximately 33 to 38 percent, the majority of whom are Pentecostal. David Stoll calculates that if we extrapolate the growth rates of evangelical churches from 1960-1985 for another twenty-five years Puerto Rico will become 75 percent evangelical.\\"Ana Adams: \\"Brincando el Charco...\\" in Power, Politics and Pentecostals in Latin America, Edward Cleary, ed., 1997. p. 164.

Most of its readers are in Attleboro and North Attleborough, Massachusetts, but it also covers nearby Foxborough, Mansfield, Norfolk, Norton, Plainville, Rehoboth, Seekonk, and Wrentham, Massachusetts. The Sun Chronicle office also publishes the weekly Foxboro Reporter, weekly North Chronicle, weekly shopper Entertainment ADvisor, and the Silver City Bulletin in Taunton, Massachusetts. In February 2005, The Sun Chronicle began publishing in the morning after decades as an afternoon newspaper.Reilly, Tom. \\"Welcome to Journalism 101.\\" The Sun Chronicle (Attleboro, Mass.), February 22, 2005. The Sun Chronicle head office is located at 34 South Main Street in Attleboro, Massachusetts.  Beginnings  The Sun Chronicle was founded in 1971 by Guy S. DeVany, who merged The Attleboro Sun (1889‚Äì1971), of which he was publisher, with The Evening Chronicle of North Attleborough (1871‚Äì1971). The North Attleborough Evening Chronicle began February 3, 1871 as The Attleborough Chronicle, a 4-page weekly founded by Walter Phillips, a Providence newspaperman whose wife was Attleboro native Francena Capron. Phillips moved the newspaper's headquarters to North Attleboro in January 1873. Its name was changed to the North Attleborough Evening Chronicle in 1887, when the town of North Attleborough split from Attleboro.\\"Sun Chronicle Combination of Dedication, Tradition.\\" The Sun Chronicle (Attleboro, Mass.), p. 1, March 1, 1971. The Attleboro Sun published its first issue September 3, 1889. For decades the two papers were friendly rivals. The Chronicle was a small newspaper with big connections; for most of its history, its publisher was the prominent Republican Congressman Joseph W. Martin, Jr., who served in the House from 1925 to 1967 and was Speaker of the U.S. House of Representatives from 1947 to 1949 and again from 1953 to 1955. Martin ran the Chronicle for six decades, and gave North Attleboro a reputation for conservatism. The Attleboro Sun, for its part, was sold by a group of local businessmen in 1906 to John S. Vallette, an advertising salesman for The Providence Journal. He appointed a 19-year-old reporter, Charles C. Cain, Jr., as the paper's editor. Vallette expanded the newspaper's reach, and pushed for Attleboro to adopt a city form of government, which it did in 1914. Then in 1929, Cain became the newspaper's publisher, and in 1933 he appointed Clarence D. Roberts as editor. Roberts remained with the paper for about half a century, in later years contributing columns from Florida.  Merger  In 1957, Charles Cain sold the Sun to a group of local businessmen. DeVany, who published newspapers in the Midwest, replaced Cain. His tenure was marked by the Sun's modernization. In 1969, it was he who engineered the sale of the paper to Howard J. Brown and United Communications. Meanwhile, Joe Martin died in 1968, and two years later his brother sold the Chronicle to United Communications, too. The Sun and the Chronicle operated separately under the same ownership for one year until they merged in March 1971 and became The Sun Chronicle. At the time, their combined circulation was 16,000. The 20-page first issue of The Sun Chronicle was published on March 1, 1971. An advertisement for it on the back cover of the 12-page final edition of The Attleboro Sun declared: \\"The new Sun Chronicle will be an adventure in print . . . stimulating . . . provocative . . . at times disturbing . . . always interesting.\\"Advertisement. The Attleboro Sun (Attleboro, Mass.), p. 12, February 27, 1971. DeVany and General Manager Paul A. Rixon modernized the new Sun Chronicle, expanded its facilities, and boosted its circulation. For example, The Sun Chronicle says it was the first newspaper to convert from hot-type production to offset printing. DeVany retired in 1983, and Rixon, who had been with the paper since 1960, took over as publisher.Schoetz, David. \\"Guy DeVany, 91; Oversaw Creation of Sun Chronicle\\". The Boston Globe, December 1, 2003. He continued The Sun Chronicle's modernization, and also acquired The Foxboro Reporter in 1986. Rixon launched a Sunday edition of The Sun Chronicle in 1989.

It shows how denotational semantics, operational semantics and algebraic semantics can be combined in a unified framework for the formal specification, design and implementation of programs and computer systems. The book of this title by C.A.R. Hoare and He Jifeng was published in the Prentice Hall International Series in Computer Science in 1998 and is now freely available on the web. Theories The semantic foundation of the UTP is the first-order predicate calculus, augmented with fixed point constructs from second-order logic. Following the tradition of Eric Hehner, programs are predicates in the UTP, and there is no distinction between programs and specifications at the semantic level. In the words of Hoare: > A computer program is identified with the strongest predicate describing > every relevant observation that can be made of the behaviour of a computer > executing that program.C.A.R. Hoare, Programming: Sorcery or science? IEEE > Software, 1(2): 5‚Äì16, April 1984. . . In UTP parlance, a theory is a model of a particular programming paradigm. A UTP theory is composed of three ingredients: * an alphabet, which is a set of variable names denoting the attributes of the paradigm that can be observed by an external entity; * a signature, which is the set of programming language constructs intrinsic to the paradigm; and * a collection of healthiness conditions, which define the space of programs that fit within the paradigm. These healthiness conditions are typically expressed as monotonic idempotent predicate transformers. Program refinement is an important concept in the UTP. A program P_1 is refined by P_2 if and only if every observation that can be made of P_2 is also an observation of P_1. The definition of refinement is common across UTP theories: P_1 sqsubseteq P_2 quadtext{if and only if}quad left[ P_2 Rightarrow P_1 right] where left[ X right] denotesEdsger W. Dijkstra and Carel S. Scholten. Predicate calculus and program semantics. Texts and Monographs in Computer Science. Springer-Verlag New York, Inc., New York, NY, USA, 1990. . the universal closure of all variables in the alphabet. Relations The most basic UTP theory is the alphabetised predicate calculus, which has no alphabet restrictions or healthiness conditions. The theory of relations is slightly more specialised, since a relation's alphabet may consist of only: * undecorated variables (v), modelling an observation of the program at the start of its execution; and * primed variables (v'), modelling an observation of the program at a later stage of its execution. Some common language constructs can be defined in the theory of relations as follows: * The skip statement, which does not alter the program state in any way, is modelled as the relational identity: mathbf{skip} equiv v' = v * The assignment of value E to a variable a is modelled as setting a' to E and keeping all other variables (denoted by u) constant: a := E equiv a' = E land u' = u * The sequential composition of two programs is just relational composition of intermediate state: P_1 ; P_2 equiv exists v_0 bullet P_1 [ v_0 / v' ] land P_2 [ v_0 / v ] * Non- deterministic choice between programs is their greatest lower bound: P_1 sqcap P_2 equiv P_1 lor P_2 * Conditional choice between programs is written using infix notation: P_1 triangleleft C triangleright P_2 equiv ( C land P_1 ) lor ( lnot C land P_2 ) * A semantics for recursion is given by the least fixed point mu mathbf{F} of a monotonic predicate transformer mathbf{F}: mu X bullet mathbf{F}(X) equiv sqcap left{ X mid mathbf{F}(X) sqsubseteq X right} References Further reading * Jim Woodcock and Ana Cavalcanti.

This colorless, flammable liquid with a characteristic smell is mainly used as a solvent either directly or as its esters. Its isomers, the other butanols, include n-butanol, 2-butanol, and tert-butanol, all of which are important industrially. Production Isobutanol is produced by the carbonylation of propylene. Two methods are practiced industrially, hydroformylation is more common and generates a mixture of isobutyraldehydes: :CH3CH=CH2 + CO + H2 ‚Üí CH3CH2CH2CHO The reaction is catalyzed by cobalt or rhodium complexes. The resulting aldehydes are subsequently hydrogenated to the alcohols, which are then separated. In Reppe carbonylation, the same products are obtained, but the hydrogenation is effected by the water-gas shift reaction.. =Laboratory synthesis= Propanol and Methanol can be combined to isobutyl alcohol. =Biosynthesis of isobutanol= E. coli as well as several other organisms has been genetically modified to produce C4 alcohols from glucose, including isobutanol, 1-butanol, 2-methyl-1-butanol, 3-methyl-1-butanol, and 2-phenylethanol. The host's highly active amino acid biosynthetic pathway is shifted to alcohol production. Applications The uses of isobutanol and n-butanol are similar. They are often used interchangeably. The main applications are as varnishes and precursors to esters, which are useful solvents, e.g. isobutyl acetate. Isobutyl esters of phthalic, adipic, and related dicarboxylic acids are common plasticizers. Isobutanol is also a component of some biofuels. Safety and regulation Isobutanol is one of the least toxic of the butanols with an of 2460 mg/kg (rat, oral). In March 2009, the Canadian government announced a ban on isobutanol use in cosmetics..

History Big Bang was the result of an agreement in 1983 by the Thatcher government and the London Stock Exchange to settle a wide-ranging antitrust case that had been initiated during the previous government by the Office of Fair Trading against the London Stock Exchange under the Restrictive Trade Practices Act 1956. These restrictive practices included the London Stock Exchange's rules establishing fixed minimum commissions, the \\"single capacity\\" rule (which enforced a separation between brokers acting as agents for their clients on commission and jobbers who made the markets and theoretically provided liquidity by holding lines of stocks and shares on their books), the requirement that both brokers and jobbers should be independent and not part of any wider financial group, and the stock exchange's exclusion of all foreigners from stock exchange membership. The day the London Stock Exchange's rules changed on 27 October 1986 was dubbed \\"Big Bang\\" because of the increase in market activity expected from an aggregation of measures designed to alter the structure of the financial market. The effect of Big Bang led to significant changes to the structure of the financial markets in London. The changes saw many of the old firms being taken over by large banks both foreign and domestic and would lead in the following years to further changes to the regulatory environment that would eventually lead to the creation of the Financial Services Authority. Consequences The effects of Big Bang were dramatic, with London's place as a financial capital decisively strengthened, to the point where it is arguably the world's most important financial centre. The boom resulted in the relocation of institutions into new developments in the nearby Isle of Dogs area, particularly that of Canary Wharf. Although the \\"Big Bang\\" eased stock market transactions there is a debate in the UK about how far it affected the 2007‚Äì2012 global financial crisis. In 2010, Nigel Lawson, Thatcher's Chancellor at the time of Big Bang, appeared on the radio programme Analysis to discuss the banking reform. He explained that the 2007‚Äì2012 global financial crisis was an unintended consequence of the \\"Big Bang\\". He said that UK investment banks were previously very cautious, as they operated with their own money, but after merging with major retail banks, the depositors' savings were put at risk, and according to the programme this led U.S. banks to follow suit. In 2011 former British Prime Minister Gordon Brown expressed regret at not implementing tougher regulations during his tenure of chancellor between 1997 and 2007, responding to \\"relentless pressure\\" from the City not to over- regulate. Similar events  Subsequent similar actions, such as the deregulation of the Japanese financial markets circa 1997, have analogously also been tagged with the phrase Big Bang.

After immigrating to Israel in 1936, he founded the Breslover Yeshiva in Jerusalem and served as its rosh yeshiva for decades. Introduction to Uman Rosen was born in Pu≈Çtusk, Poland, which was then part of the Russian Empire. He was orphaned as a very young boy. He was sent to a nearby city to begin learning Torah at the age of five, and proved himself to be a gifted student. At the age of 12, he was accepted at the ≈Åom≈ºa Yeshiva. There, he came across a copy of Tikkun HaKlali (Rebbe Nachman of Breslov's \\"General Remedy\\"), and met a Breslover Hasid who convinced him to visit the Breslover community in Uman. Rosen made the trip in 1914. Later he said that what impressed him about the community was that the followers of Rebbe Nachman, who were obviously Hasidim, abided by all the halachot of the Shulchan Aruch without engaging in \\"Hasidic twists\\" or reinterpretations of the law. Rosen decided to stay in Uman, however, after he heard that Rebbe Nachman had said, \\"The most difficult spiritual devotion is far easier than a simple physical transaction.\\" He sought an explanation from Rabbi Abraham Chazan, a leading Breslover teacher. (Chazan had moved to Jerusalem, but visited Uman every year. During World War II, Chazan was unable to leave the country and spent the time teaching and strengthening the Breslover community in Uman.) Chazan explained, \\"Hitbodedut (meditation) is the greatest spiritual devotion one can perform. All it takes is speaking with one's mouth. Even earning just a small amount of money requires more effort than that.\\" Upon hearing this, Rosen decided to remain in Uman and continue to learn from Chazan and other Breslover rabbis. Community leader Rabbi Levi Yitzchok Bender. Eventually, Rosen and Rabbi Levi Yitzchok Bender became the joint leaders of the Breslover community in Uman. Rosen displayed his commitment to his flock during a government-engineered famine in Ukraine engineered by Joseph Stalin's forced collectivization of agriculture (see Holodomor). Rosen organized shipments from the bread lines in Moscow to the starving community in Uman, and also appealed to the American Jewish Joint Distribution Committee for assistance. This latter act brought Rosen and Bender to the attention of the NKVD in November 1935. The two were arrested and charged with making contact with foreign organizations. They were imprisoned, put on trial and faced the death sentence, but won an unexpected reprieve from by a sympathetic Jewish official in the Ministry of Justice in Kiev. Rosen and Bender were allowed to return to their homes, but were placed under \\"city arrest\\" and not allowed to leave Uman. However, both men fled the city. While Bender migrated from place to place, Rosen traveled straight to Moscow to pick up an exit visa that he had applied for in 1931. Aliyah to Israel When the exit visa was ready, he used it to flee to Jerusalem, together with his family, arriving in the summer of 1936. Rosen's arrival heralded a new beginning for the fledgling Breslover community in Israel. Together with Rabbi Abraham Sternhartz, who had also immigrated to Jerusalem in 1936, Rosen led the Breslover community in Israel with warmth and dedication. Yeshiva founder The Breslov Yeshiva and Synagogue in Mea Shearim, Jerusalem. In 1937, he founded the Breslover Yeshiva in the Old City and served as its rosh yeshiva. Sixteen years later, he spearheaded the construction of a larger Breslover synagogue and yeshiva in Meah Shearim. His ambitious plans for a four-story structure were ridiculed by some, since there were only about 150 Breslover Hasidim in the entire country at the time. Today, however, the building is not large enough to house the many people who come to it for prayers and study. The yeshiva building also operates gemachs (free-loan funds) for needy families, medical expenses and general loans. Beyond his responsibilities as rosh yeshiva, Rosen was a central address for all who sought a sympathetic ear for their problems and worries. Invariably visitors would leave his study wondering what had bothered them so much in the first place. The problems didn't disappear, but Rosen was able to cut away all the surrounding anxieties and pressures and zero in on the one issue that the person needed to work on to improve his situation. Rosen often explained, \\"The Torah has five Books. The Shulchan Aruch has four volumes. What happened to the fifth volume? That corresponds to one's common sense, knowing where and how to apply your knowledge.\\" Weakened by typhus and other ailments during his youth, Rosen nevertheless radiated strength, joy and serenity throughout his life. Even when he grew very weak near the end of his life, he arose every night at midnight to recite the Tikkun Chatzot (Midnight Lament) and practiced hitbodedut regularly. When people asked him how he found the strength to pursue these rigorous devotions, he answered, \\"If you get used to it when you are young, it comes automatically after so many years.\\" In the last year of his life, when he was bedridden most of the time, he remarked, \\"What would I be able to do now, if I didn't have Rebbe Nachman's advice of hitbodedut?\\" References *Kramer, Chaim (1989).

Koreans use Chinese-derived family names and in Korean, Cai is Ï±Ñ in Hangul, Chae in Revised Romanization,\\"Popular Chinese Surnames in Singapore.\\" at Statistics Singapore. 2000 ranking based on romanized form of Chua. It is also a common Cantonese name in Hong Kong where it is romanized as Choy, Choi or Tsoi. In Macao and Malaysia, it is spelled as Choi, in Malaysia and the Philippines as Chua or Chuah, in Thailand as Chuo (‡∏â‡∏±‡πà‡∏ß). Moreover, it is also romanized in Cambodia as either Chhay, Chhuor or Chhor among Chinese Cambodians and as Tjoa or Chua in Indonesia. History The Cais are said to be the descendants of the 5th son of King Wen of Zhou, Ji Du. Ji Du was awarded the title of marquis (h√≥u) of the State of Cai (centered on what is now Shangcai, Zhumadian, Henan, China), and he was known as Cai Shu Du (\\"Uncle Du of Cai\\"). Together with Guan Shu and Huo Shu, they were known as the Three Guards. When King Wu died, his son King Cheng was too young and his uncle, the Duke of Zhou, became regent. Seeing that the power of the Duke of Zhou was increasing, the Three Guards got jealous and rebelled against Zhou together with Wu Geng. The Duke of Zhou suppressed the rebellion, and Cai Shu was exiled. King Cheng reestablished Cai Shu's son Wu or Hu as the new Duke of Cai. Some 600 years later in the Warring States period, the State of Chu conquered Cai in 447 BC and was itself conquered by the Qin state which, in turn, formed the Qin Empire, China's first empire. With the spread of family names to all social classes in the new empire, many people of the former state of Cai began to bear it as a surname. The Cai descendants have undertaken the following two major migrations. During the Huang Chao Rebellion (AD 875) at the end of the Tang Dynasty (AD 618-907), the Cai clan migrated to Guangdong and Fujian provinces. Another later migration occurred when Ming Dynasty loyalist Koxinga moved military officials surnamed Cai and their families to Taiwan in the 17th century. As a result, the surname is far more common in these areas and in areas settled by their descendants (e.g., Southeast Asia) than in other parts of China. Transliteration and romanization =Chinese= Cai is written the same (Ëî°) in both simplified and traditional Chinese characters. In Mandarin Chinese, the surname is transliterated as C√†i in pinyin and Tongyong Pinyin, Ts'ai in Wade-Giles, and Tsay in Gwoyeu Romatzyh. In Southern Min or Taiwanese, it is Chho√† in PeÃçh-oƒì-jƒ´. In Cantonese (Hong Kong and Macau), it is Coi3 in Jyutping and Choi in Yale. (This should not be confused with the predominantly Korean family name Choi which has a different character [Â¥î]). In Hakka it is Tshai in PhaÃçk-fa-s·π≥. (In Tongyong pinyin, it is Cai in Siyen Hakka and CaÃ±i in Hoiliuk Hakka.) In Fuzhou dialect, it is Ch√°i (in B√†ng-u√¢-c√™). =Other languages= Koreans use Chinese-derived family names and in Korean, Cai is Ï±Ñ in Hangul, Chae in Revised Romanization, and Ch'ae in McCune-Reischauer. Vietnamese also use Chinese-derived family names. In Vietnamese, the name is Th√°i. The Chinese name Ëî° is usually transliterated via Sino-Vietnamese as Th√°i but sometimes as S√°i. Japanese do not use Chinese family names but for Chinese in Japan who carry the name, it is „Åï„ÅÑ in Hiragana and Sai in the major romanization systems. =Romanization= Cai is romanized as Cai in the People's Republic of China, Tsai (or occasionally Tsay or Chai for Mandarin) or Tsoa in the Taiwan, and Choi or Choy in Hong Kong and Malaysia. In Malaysia, Singapore, and Brunei, the most common forms are Chua or Chuah for Teochew and Hokkien speakers, Chai for Hakka speakers, Choi or Tsoi for Cantonese speakers, and Toy or Toi for Taishanese speakers. In Indonesia, it is usually romanized as Tjoa/Tjhoa/Tjoea/Tjhoea (Hokkien & Teochew), Tjhoi (Cantonese) or Tjhai (Hakka) with Dutch spelling, or Tjua/Tjhua (Hokkien & Teochew) with old Indonesian spelling, or Chua (Hokkien & Teochew), Choy/Choi (Cantonese) or Chai (Hakka) with current Indonesian spelling. In the Philippines, it is Chua or Cua ( or ). Chua is pronounced in other Anglophone countries outside the Philippines. Other variations include Chye and Coi. Derivative names In addition, some of the Chuas (Cais) who resided in the Philippines adopted Spanish names to avoid persecution by the Spanish rulers during the Philippines' Spanish colonial rule from the early 16th to late 19th century. Hispanicized forms of the name include Chuachiaco, Chuakay, Chuapoco, Chuaquico, Chuacuco, Chuason, Chuateco, and Chuatoco.Hector Santos. Kat√°logo ng mga Apelyidong Pilipino (Catalog of Filipino Names). These names were formed from the surname, one character of the given name, and the suffix \\"-co\\", a Minnan honorific ko (Âì•), literally meaning \\"older brother\\". In Thailand, most Thais of Chinese descendance use Thai surnames. Legislation by Siamese King Rama VI (1910-1925) required the adoption of Thai surnames which was largely directed at easing tensions with Chinese community by encouraging assimilation. Thai law did not (and does not) allow identical surnames to those already in existence,Kriengsak Niratpattanasai. \\"Why many Thais have a long surname.\\" Thailand Tales column in the APMF Asian Business Strategy Ezine. so ethnic Chinese formerly surnamed Chua incorporating words that sound like \\"Chua\\" and have good meaning (such as Chai, meaning \\"victory\\") into much longer surnames. After Suharto came to power, his regime created many anti- Chinese legislations in Indonesia. One of them was 127/U/Kep/12/1966 which strongly encouraged ethnic Chinese living in Indonesia to adopt Indonesian- sounding names instead of the standard three-word or two-word Chinese names. Many Indonesianized names are Chinese surname syllables with western or Indonesian prefix or suffix - resulting in many exotic-sounding names. Although two Chinese individuals shared the same Chinese surname, they may employ different strategies for the Indonesian-sounding names. For example, Indonesianized forms of Cai include Tjuatja, Cuaca, Tjuandi, Cuandi, Tjahjana, Tjahja, etc. Despite the Indonesianization, the Chinese surnames are still used today by the Chinese-Indonesian diaspora overseas (mostly in the Netherlands, Germany, and USA); by those Chinese-Indonesians courageous enough during Suharto's regime to keep their Chinese names (e.g., Kwik Kian Gie), or by those who couldn't afford to process the name change through Indonesia's civil bureaucracy. After Suharto resigned from the presidency, subsequent governments revoked the ban on the ethnic Chinese from speaking and learning Chinese in public. Using the original Chinese surnames is no longer a taboo but only a small minority have decided to re-adopt the original Chinese surnames of their grandparents or to use the Mandarin Chinese pinyin romanization, pronunciation and spelling and most retain their changed names as the post-1965 generations have been culturally Indonesianized.

Clifton was named because of its hilly location on the Ohio River valley escarpment. Clifton is bounded by I-64, N Ewing Ave, Brownsboro Road, and Mellwood Ave. History New Condos in Clifton Unlike other Louisville neighborhoods, Clifton was developed over a period of 60 years, with the first homes built in the 1860s sitting next to homes built in the 1910s, although nearly all homes were built in Victorian styles. Its residential areas are also much less dense than other nearby areas like Butchertown or the Original Highlands. The Louisville and Lexington toll pike, which is now called Frankfort Avenue, went through the heart of the area and was lined with small shops. The area began to revitalize in the 1990s, as numerous restaurants, boutiques, and antique shops opened up along Frankfort Avenue. Area attractions include the Kentucky School for the Blind and the American Printing House for the Blind.

Vanpools have a lower operating and capital cost than most transit vehicles in the United States, but due to their relatively low capacity, vanpools often require subsidies comparable to conventional bus service. http://www.ntdprogram.gov/ntdprogram/pubs/profiles/2012/Transit%20Profiles%202012%20Report%20Year%20Summary.pdf Vehicles may be provided by individuals, individuals in cooperation with various public and private support programs, through a program operated by or on behalf of an element of government, or a program operated by or on behalf of an employer. The key concept is that people share the ride from home or one or more common meeting locations and travel together to a common destination or work center. A number of programs exist (within the United States) to help lower the cost of that shared ride to the end user. Among these are traditional funding available to public agencies, public-private partnerships, and the Best Work Places for Commutershttp://www.bwc.gov/ (Commuter Choice Programs). A tax benefit is available under 26 U.S.C. ¬ß132(f) Qualified Transportation Fringe Benefit allowances. These public transportation programs seek to reduce the number of cars on the road (with all the attendant environmental benefits). Additional benefits include: * Speed: The van can use the HOV (High Occupancy Vehicle) lanes because normally more than 2-3 people ride. * Fixed schedule (makes life more predictable). * Saving the cost of gasoline (in some cases, it is part of the program). * Riders often can have significant reductions in the cost of personal automobile insurance (insurance for the rideshare component is usually provided as part of the vanpool program). * Incentives from local/federal transportation authorities offset cost. In many cases, an employer may elect to subsidize the cost of the vanpool and the vehicles' maintenance. In some cases, the vehicles are provided and maintained by the municipality; in others in partnership with or by a third-party provider. For example, UCLA operates an extensive network of vans, in which faculty, staff and students are eligible for discounted rates, although anyone commuting to the Westwood area is allowed to participate, with drivers receiving the highest discounts. The vans are centrally maintained, fueled, and cleaned. The King County Metro Vanpool Programhttp://metro.kingcounty.gov/tops/van-car/commutervans.html is a successful demand responsive transport program in the Puget Sound area, specifically in King County, Washington. Another successful program is operated by Pace in Illinois. The oldest multi-employer vanpool program in the country is in Treasure Valley, Idaho.

It is one of the famous painted monasteries from southern Bukovina, in Suceava County. The monastery was constructed by Stephen the Great in 1488 over a period of 3 months and 3 weeks to commemorate the victory at Battle of Vaslui. Often known as the \\"Sistine Chapel of the East\\", the frescoes at Vorone»õ feature an intense shade of blue known in Romania as \\"Vorone»õ blue.\\" The monastery is located to the south of Gura Humorului in Suceava County, in the valley of the Vorone»õ River. The legend of the origin of the church unites two men central to Romanian history: the founder of the monastery, Stephen the Great, and Saint Daniil the Hermit, the first abbot of the monastery. The tomb of Saint Daniil is located within the monastery. The church is one of the Painted churches of Moldavia listed in UNESCO's list of World Heritage sites. History The age of the monastic site is not known. A legend tells us that Stephen the Great, in a moment of crisis during a war against the Ottoman Turks, came to Daniel the Hermit at his skete in Vorone»õ and asked for advice. Daniel told him not to surrender the fight. Then, after victory, he must build a monastery dedicated to Saint George. The original entrance above the Church of Saint George, now in the exonarthex, bears the inscription: The church was built on a triconch plan (with three apses), with a chancel, a naos with its tower, and a pronaos. In 1547, the Metropolitan Bishop of Moldavia Grigorie Ro»ôca added the exonarthex to the west end of the church and had the exterior walls painted. His contribution is recorded on the left of the entrance door: The monastery contains tombstones commemorating Saint Daniel the Hermit, Grigorie Ro»ôca, and other patrons of the church and noblemen. Vorone≈£ was known for its school of calligraphy, where priests, monks and friars learned to read, write and translate religious texts. The school produced two notable copies of Romanian translations of the Bible: The Codex of Vorone»õ, discovered in 1871, and The Psalter of Vorone»õ, found in 1882. These books are now held at the Romanian Academy. The monastery was deserted soon after 1775, when the Habsburg Monarchy annexed the northern part of Moldavia. The monastic community returned to Vorone»õ in 1991. Since their return, those living in the monastery have constructed housing for the resident nuns, a chapel, fountains, stables, barns, and a house for pilgrims. Church The katholikon (main church) of Saint George at Vorone»õ Monastery is possibly the most famous church in Romania. It is known throughout the world for its exterior frescoes of bright and intense colours, and for the hundreds of well-preserved figures placed against the renowned azurite background. The small windows, their rectangular frames of crossed rods and the receding pointed or shouldered arches of the interior doorframes are Gothic. The south and north doors of the exonarthex of 1547 have rectangular frames, which indicate a transition period from Gothic to Renaissance. But, above them, on each wall is a tall window with a flamboyant Gothic arch. The whole west fa√ßade is without any openings, which indicates that the intention of the Metropolitan Ro»ôca was from the beginning to reserve it for frescoes. On the north fa√ßade is still visible the original decoration of the church, the rows of ceramic enamelled discs in yellow, brown and green, decorated in relief. These include heraldic motifs, such as the rampant lion and the aurochs' head of the Moldavian coat of arms, and creatures inspired by Western European mediaeval literature, such as two-tailed mermaids. The tower is decorated with sixteen tall niches, in four of which are windows. A row of small niches encircles the tower above them. The fragmented roof probably follows the shape of the original roof, which doubtless was made with shingles.

Flavoproteins are involved in a wide array of biological processes, including removal of radicals contributing to oxidative stress, photosynthesis, and DNA repair. The flavoproteins are some of the most-studied families of enzymes. Flavoproteins have either FMN or FAD as a prosthetic group or as a cofactor. The flavin is generally tightly bound (as in adrenodoxin reductase, wherein the FAD is buried deeply). About 5-10% of flavoproteins have a covalently linked FAD. Based on the available structural data, FAD-binding sites can be divided into more than 200 different types. 90 flavoproteins are encoded in the human genome; about 84% require FAD, and around 16% require FMN, whereas 5 proteins require both. Flavoproteins are mainly located in the mitochondria. Of all flavoproteins, 90% perform redox reactions and the other 10% are transferases, lyases, isomerases, ligases. Discovery Flavoproteins were first mentioned in 1879, when they isolated as a bright-yellow pigment from cow's milk. They were initially termed lactochrome. By the early 1930s, this same pigment had been isolated from a range of sources, and recognised as a component of the vitamin B complex. Its structure was determined was reported in 1935 and given the name riboflavin, derived from the ribityl side chain and yellow colour of the conjugated ring system. The first evidence for the requirement of flavin as an enzyme cofactor came in 1935. Hugo Theorell and coworkers showed that a bright-yellow-coloured yeast protein, identified previously as essential for cellular respiration, could be separated into apoprotein and a bright-yellow pigment. Neither apoprotein nor pigment alone could catalyse the oxidation of NADH, but mixing of the two restored the enzyme activity. However, replacing the isolated pigment with riboflavin did not restore enzyme activity, despite their being indistinguishable under spectroscopy. This led to the discovery that the protein studied required not riboflavin but flavin mononucleotide to be catalytically active. Similar experiments with D-amino acid oxidase led to the identification of flavin adenine dinucleotide (FAD) as a second form of flavin utilised by enzymes. Examples The flavoprotein family contains a diverse range of enzymes, including: * Adrenodoxin reductase that is involved in steroid hormone synthesis in vertebrate species, and has a ubiquitous distribution in metazoa and prokaryotes. *Epidermin biosynthesis protein, EpiD, which has been shown to be a flavoprotein that binds FMN. This enzyme catalyses the removal of two reducing equivalents from the cysteine residue of the C-terminal meso-lanthionine of epidermin to form a --CC-- double bond. *The B chain of dipicolinate synthase, an enzyme which catalyses the formation of dipicolinic acid from dihydroxydipicolinic acid. *Phenylacrylic acid decarboxylase , and enzyme which confers resistance to cinnamic acid in yeast See also *Phototropin *Cryptochrome References External links * The menu \\"science\\" of the program STRAP provides A comprehensive collection of all flavo-proteins with known 3D-structure.

Owned by Evanov Radio Group (but with a 30% stake held by outside investors under numbered companies), it broadcasts a soft adult contemporary format. CKDX's studios are located on Dundas Street West in the Eatonville neighbourhood of Etobicoke, Toronto, while its transmitter is located near Aurora History The station was launched on February 28, 1980 as AM 1480 CKAN, broadcasting from 6 am to midnight with a hybrid easy listening/beautiful music format. The station switched to a country music format in 1984. In 1986, the station switched to a Top 40 format, and in 1988 the station began broadcasting 24 hours a day. The station shut down on March 17, 1992 due to financial problems, and resumed broadcasting on May 17 of that year when the problems were resolved. At the time of the shutdown, the station was known as Energy 1480. In December of that year, the station adopted its current CKDX callsign with an oldies/easy listening format. CKDX subsequently moved to the FM dial in 1994, branding itself as The Phoenix.Decision CRTC 94-438 Since moving to FM, the station has gone through several technical changes.Decision CRTC 99-479 The station went through a number of format changes in the next several years, adopting a dance music format again as Power 88.5 (after a brief period as 88.5 The X) on February 21, 1997 at 8 AM. On July 19, 1999, at 5 p.m., the station returned to country as 88.5 The Kat. So you're just back from vacation and as you're driving across the North end of town, you punch in Power 88... Toronto Star, July 25, 1999 On June 1, 2000, at Noon, the station flipped to a format that has never been tried in Canada before: \\"Rhythmic oldies\\" as Dancing Oldies 88.5. By 2001, the \\"Dancing Oldies\\" format aired throughout the day, while modern dance music was broadcast at night. It was at this point in time that the station became known as Foxy 88.5, The Dance Music Station. This lasted until January 2002, when it flipped to adult standards while retaining the \\"Foxy\\" branding. In April 2007, the station rebranded as 88.5 The Jewel. It adopted the \\"Jewel\\" branding shortly after the launch of sister station CJWL-FM in Ottawa, which is also branded as \\"The Jewel\\". In 2009, after a few years with the adult standards format, the station changed to more of an older-skewing adult contemporary format to replace CJEZ-FM (which became adult hits as CHBM-FM) as CHFI-FM's competing adult contemporary station. It was at this point that CHFI began skewing towards a younger audience for its AC format. All of the Jewel stations present an adult contemporary variety of music, from artists such as Elton John, Rod Stewart, Celine Dion, The Eagles, Kelly Clarkson, James Taylor, Lady Antebellum, Adele and Michael Bubl√©. 88.5 The Jewel also features traditional easy listening/adult standards music on \\"The Lounge\\" program, which is simulcast on the other Jewel stations, seven days a week from 7 to 11pm. This program is hosted by a revolving roster of on-air personalities from Jewel stations, playing \\"Music With Style\\", often with standards from the Great American Songbook. Frequently played artists include Louis Armstrong, Diana Krall, Gladys Knight and Frank Sinatra. Following The Lounge in the 11pm hour is the \\"Instrumental Concert Series,\\" a beautiful music block. In addition to competing with CHFI (though less so since this station's change in format), 88.5 The Jewel also competes with Hamilton's CKLH-FM K-Lite and St. Catharines's CHRE-FM (EZ Rock).

History The name 'Waltham' is believed to be derived from the Anglo-Saxon words Wealt and Ham, meaning 'dilapidated homes'.Ford, David Nash (2001). Royal Berkshire History. Retrieved 6 October 2005 The church is called St. Lawrence and thus gives the village its name. There is evidence of the existence of a Roman temple in Weycock Field in the parish. The word Weycock is thought to be a corruption of the Saxon word, Vic-cope, meaning 'the road on the hill'. Most of the coins found from the site are of the lower empire (except for a silver one of Amyntas, the grandfather of Alexander the Great) and the area was occupied until AD 270. The high-road to London formerly left the London to Reading main-road at the 29th milestone and ran across Weycock Field (often referred to as Weycock Highrood). The Priory of Hurley maintained a grange in the village on the site of what is now Church Farm (to the north-west of the present Church) and this is why the great tithes of the parish were formerly appropriated to the Prior of Hurley. Until quite recent times a large lake separated Waltham St. Lawrence from Ruscombe (the name 'Stanlake' would seem to be a survival of this) and so the southern end of the parish was known as South Lake. The Normans, who became possessed of the manor after the Conquest, gave the name of 'Sud-Lac Rue' to the area which later became known as Shurlock Row. The parish church was built where the ancient high-road entered the village. The manor is mentioned as early as AD 940 but its continuous appearance in historical records may be said to begin with its sale by Ethelred the Unready in 1006. His widow, Queen Emma, bestowed it upon √Ülfwine, the Bishop of Winchester. The Domesday Book records: \\"The King holds Waltham in demesne\\" and it remained a royal manor until 1189 when Godfrey de Luci, Bishop of Winchester, purchased it from the Crown. It was retained by the bishops of Winchester until the Reformation. Bishop Ponet of Winchester surrendered the manor of Waltham to King Edward VI in 1551, and the King donated it to Sir Henry Neville, one of the gentlemen of his Privy Chamber, but Queen Mary returned it to Bishop John White of Winchester. King Edward's grant was confirmed (and Queen Mary's annulled) by an Act of Parliament in the first year of Queen Elizabeth I. Billingbear House was built by Sir Henry Neville in 1567, and this Elizabethan mansion existed as the home of the Nevilles until it was pulled down after a fire in the early 20th century. His son was the early-17th-century diplomat, Sir Henry Neville, junior. The parish register records that: > \\"September 17th, 1667, King Charles 2nd, with his brother James Duke of > Yorke, Prince Rupert Duke of Cumberland, James Duke of Monmouth and many > more of the nobles dined at Bellingbeare in the great Parlour\\".Waltham St > Lawrence Parish Registers At that time, Richard Neville was Lord of the Manor. Henry Neville, the last heir of this branch of the family, who had assumed the name of Grey, as heir of his maternal grandfather, Baron Grey of Werke, died in 1740. On the death of his widow, who afterwards had married as her second husband the Earl of Portsmouth, the manor of Waltham St. Lawrence was inherited by Richard Aldworth of Stanlake, whose father had married the daughter and heir of Colonel Richard Neville. Mr. Aldworth, on his accession to this property, took the name of Neville. The village school‚Äînow a County Primary School‚Äîwas originally a National School with an endowment of ¬£35 by Lord Braybrooke, a Neville descendant. The first Dame School held in the parish was held at 'Honeys'. The village war memorial is at Paradise Corner, which takes its name from the nearby Georgian manor house, Paradise House, on The Street. Location and amenities Waltham St Lawrence is located in a rural setting in East Berkshire, south of the A4 trunk road and north of the M4 motorway, between Maidenhead and Reading. The parish is bordered by those of Twyford and Hurst to the west and White Waltham and Maidenhead to the east. The population is around 1000 adults with an all-ages estimate of 1,500 living in approximately 550 households. Residents are mainly employed in local towns such as Reading or Bracknell, although a significant number also commute to London. Waltham St Lawrence used to have its own village shop (with part-time post office), There is a public house, the Bell, while Shurlock Row, in the parish, has another, the Shurlock Inn. West End, between the two villages, is a residential area, where the local village school is located. Transport The nearest rail stations are at Twyford , Maidenhead ), Wokingham and Bracknell . There is a local bus service to Maidenhead and Bracknell. Parish church The tower of St Lawrence church =Architecture= The Church of St. Lawrence, a grade II* listed building, is of considerable antiquity. The original building probably ante-dates Bishop Godfrey's acquisition of the manor, for traces of pre-13th-century work can still be traced in the crude Norman arches at the west end of the nave. The church was rebuilt in the 13th century when a new aisle in the Decorated style was thrown out on the north side, and the Norman work was broken down, thus opening the new aisle to the nave. Later the chancel, with its side aisles was begun from the east end and the north and south walls of the nave were extended to join up with the new work in the 13th century. At the end of the 14th century, the south aisle of the chancel was enlarged and a square-headed window with trifoliated lights was inserted. Between this side-chapel and the south aisle of the nave is an Early English pointed arch. The window in the north chapel has a 14th-century window and on the south wall may be seen the remains of the ancient piscina. The porch on the south side of the church hides the old south door which is Norman work, set in a section of 11th-century walling. The Early English Church was plastered inside and on this were commonly painted frescoes. A remnant of this treatment is to be found on the easternmost pillar of the north aisle. Close to this pillar and (behind the priest's stall) on the north side are to be seen traces of a pointed arch which evidently formed the doorway to the rood stairs. This is now blocked up. The Church has a small chancel with choir stalls and a pipe organ built by Henry Willis. The church building was restored in 1847 during the incumbency of the Revd. E. J. Parker, B.D., who gave the stained glass for the east window, which shows in its central panel the Crucifixion, with the Resurrection and Ascension of Our Lord on either side. The praying angels on either side of this window are adapted from the famous fresco in the Riccardi Palace in Florence. The reredos is 19th-century work and shows ‚Äì in three compartments‚Äîthe Descent from the Cross (centre); on the right, the Descent of the Holy Spirit at Pentecost; and on the left, Saint Paul preaching in Athens. =Bells= At the west end of the church is a square embattled tower, with a small turret at the south-west angle containing a staircase leading to the belfry and the top of the tower. The ringing chamber is open to the church and contains a beautiful window in which is the only good glass in the building. This window, and the square- headed doorway below it, is of the Perpendicular period in English architecture. The tower was built in two sections. The lower part dates from the 14th century and the upper from the 16th. Some of the bells date back to the time of Charles II, but the peal only from 1808, when the bells were recast and rehung. The peal was again rehung in 1931, and by the generous aid of G. A. Monkhouse, Esq., bells four and six were recast by Gillett and Johnston of Croydon. Extracts from the registers make it plain that the tenor and treble, together with the second bell, were broken in 1659, and these ‚Äì together with the sacring bell ‚Äì were recast into five bells, and a peal rung for them for the first time on Tuesday, 23 April: \\"the day which King Charles the 2nd was crowned at Westminster\\". The sacring bell ‚Äì which hangs in its own turret at the top of the tower ‚Äì bears the following inscription: \\"The gift of John A. Beere of the Hill Henbolt. Pray for the welfare of Robert Conisbe 1681\\". The A'Bear family lived at Hill Farm at Hare hatch in the adjoining parish of Wargrave. =Registers= The parish registers date from 25 November 1558. The originals are lodged for safekeeping with the county archivist in Reading, but parish priest possesses a transcript (1558 to 1812) by Edmund Newbery. Apart from the usual entries of births, marriages and deaths, there are interesting memoranda, such as the following: > \\"Memorandum that the yewe tree at the churchyard gate on the right hand as > one goeth into the churchyard up to the churchpond was planted by Thos. > Wilkinson vicar of Waltham in February 1655\\" > \\"Mabel modwyn widowe abact 68 years old arraigned for witch craft at Redding > 29th Feb: and condemned on the 5th of March, 1655. Shee lived at ye south- > wist cornr. of lower Innings in ye cornr. next to Binfield\\". Silver Band The origins of the Waltham St. Lawrence Band go back to 1886. The founder players were mainly village tradesmen backed by two wealthy benefactors, William Landsdowne Beale and the Revd. Grey Neville. Little is recorded of the band's early days, but it was certainly a well established part of the local scene by 1910. The band was revived after the disruptions of World War 1 in 1922, and made great progress under the direction of Twyford publican Ernest Pearce. Activities included regular appearances at \\"hospital parades\\" to raise funds for Royal Berks Hospital, and there were significant contest successes in the inter-war years, including a first prize at Fairford Contest in 1938. After World War 2, the band was re-established in 1946 as the Waltham St. Lawrence Silver Prize Band, again under the direction of Mr Pearce. He continued as conductor until his death in 1953. It was a struggle to get the band going again, and it is thanks to the efforts and determination of Sydney Boyd that the band continues to exist today. Syd continued to play a leading role until his death in 1982. In 1950 the name changed again to East Berks Silver Band, reflecting the wider area from which members were being drawn. Jack Clark, who formerly played cornet for Morris Motors band among others, became bandmaster in 1954. There were a number of contest successes both locally and at national level through the 1950s. In 1957 the East Berks Silver Band decided to base itself in Reading, a move that was unacceptable to many members. A new Waltham St. Lawrence Band was formed, based in the village and rehearsing then, as now, in the village's Neville Hall on a Wednesday evening. Mr C.Tuffley was made bandmaster, but died soon afterwards, being succeeded by W. T. Kirkland. In 1960, F.Lewingdon became bandmaster until 1967. Between 1967-75 the role alternated between J. Shaw and F. Merrick. In 1975 the baton was taken up by John Lawes, who was very active on the Reading music scene, and also conducted the Reading Operatic Society's orchestra. He composed and arranged many pieces for the band, including easier items for a 10-piece ensemble. John promoted a move towards a more modern presentation, with more \\"swing\\" music and interaction with the concert audience. Jim Pullen, who joined the band on trombone in 1986, became bandmaster in 1988. Previously a professional musician in the RAF, Jim was also a capable string bass and guitar player. As well as tackling demanding pieces from the brass band repertoire, the band also learned to handle jazz and rock genres under Jim's direction, and recorded its first CD, \\"Serenade\\", reflecting the wide range of music it was playing. Jim had to stand down for a period in 2004 due to pressure of work, and the band was conducted during that time by Sarah Topp, a graduate musician and also a fine singer. Derek Holland was appointed MD in 2006, and continued in the post until early 2016. Under his direction the band learned many \\"forgotten gems\\" of the brass band and light classical repertoire, and Derek's comprehensive background knowledge about composers and musicals added sparkle to many concerts. Notable events in Derek's time as MD included visits to Germany in 2008 and 2013, and a number of special performances for the Queen's jubilee in 2012. The band's second CD, marking the previous year's 125th anniversary, was also recorded in 2012. Jim Pullen (see above) was reappointed as the band's musical director from February 2016 until October 2017. Steve Block was appointed musical director in January 2018. After studying Trumpet and Composition at the Royal Academy of Music in London, Steve enjoyed a 40-year career in music education, with a parallel amateur career of conducting, composing and brass playing. On retirement, he was able to take up two further musical pursuits, singing and brass banding, whilst continuing to conduct and compose. Steve‚Äôs conducting has ranged from choirs and musical theatre companies to bands and orchestras, and he has been privileged to conduct performances at the Royal Albert Hall, Royal Festival Hall, Birmingham Symphony Hall, and also Dudley Castle where he performed his own specially commissioned work in the presence of H.M. The Queen. Steve‚Äôs first musical love is (and has always been) conducting, and he is delighted to have been appointed as Musical Director for Waltham St Lawrence Silver Band, and is looking forward to a long and warm association with this talented and friendly band.

History Boston Pizza in London, Ontario Boston Pizza began in Edmonton, Alberta, on August 12, 1964, when four Greek immigrants, Trifon Agioritis, Gus Agioritis, Perry Agioritis, and Ninos Agioritis opened Boston Pizza and Spaghetti House. By 1970, Boston Pizza had 17 locations in Western Canada, 15 of which were franchised. One of the first franchisees was Jim Treliving, a Royal Canadian Mounted Police officer. In 1968, he noticed the growing popularity of Boston Pizza and purchased the rights to open a restaurant in Penticton, British Columbia. While in Penticton, he met George Melville, a chartered accountant. He acted as Treliving's business consultant for four years, and, in 1973, became Treliving's business partner. Over 10 years, they opened 16 restaurants in British Columbia. In 1983, Treliving and Melville acquired the Boston Pizza chain from Ron Coyle, who had acquired the company from Agioritis in 1978. The two divested 15 of their restaurants to other franchisees, converted one restaurant to a corporate training restaurant and set about establishing systems and operating standards to standardize company operations. In the early 1980s, Boston Pizza expanded into Eastern Canada but by late 1985 most, if not all restaurants in Ontario were closed. In 1986, Boston Pizza became the official pizza supplier for Expo 86 in Vancouver. This major success for the company led to expansion in Eastern Canada. In the next two years, it led to another 17 franchises. By 1995, the chain had grown to 95 restaurants in Western Canada with sales in excess of $110 million (CAD). Over the many years, the restaurants had become a success, more sports bars had been established as an integral part of the business. In 1997, Mark Pacinda was hired to bring the chain to more eastern areas of Canada. Once an Eastern Office was opened in Mississauga, another restaurant was opened in Ottawa in September 1998. The company later opened a regional office in Laval, Quebec, in April 2004. , there are 348 Boston Pizza restaurants in Canada, and over 40 in the U.S. and Mexico. =Boston's= Boston's chain logo Boston's was the U.S. and Mexican version of the Boston Pizza franchise. In 1998, a U.S. headquarters was set up in Dallas, Texas. The Boston Pizza name was changed to Boston's The Gourmet Pizza, Restaurant and Sports Bar.https://www.bostons.com Boston's had over 30 stores in the U.S. and four in Mexico. =Promotional branding= As part of an advertising campaign created by ZIP communication, during the first round of the 2011 Stanley Cup playoffs, when the Boston Bruins played the Montreal Canadiens, the company temporarily rebranded its Montreal locations as \\"Montreal Pizza\\". In the final round of the playoffs, when the Bruins played the Vancouver Canucks, the company temporarily rebranded its British Columbia locations as \\"Vancouver Pizza\\". Trademark dispute In 2002, Boston Pizza commenced a lawsuit against Boston Market in the Federal Court of Canada over the trademark use of the word \\"Boston\\" in Canada. In its defence, Boston Market alleged that Boston Pizza's trademarks were invalid because they described a style of pizza from a specific area. The dispute continued after Boston Market ceased operations in Canada in 2004. The parties settled the dispute in 2008 under an agreement that Boston Market would not use the words \\"Boston\\" or \\"Boston Market\\" in Canada for five years for restaurants or any food or drink products (other than pre-packaged food products, but not including pizza and lasagna). Boston Market also agreed that it would not challenge Boston Pizza's use in Canada of any trademark that uses the words \\"Boston\\" or \\"Boston Pizza\\" (with certain exceptions).

Barely a year after its creation, it was relocated to Cranborne Barracks (Salisbury) where its headquarters remained for the rest of its existence. The Regiment became part of the Southern Rhodesian Army when the Federation dissolved at the start of 1964 and, later that year, reformed into a commando battalion. After Rhodesia's Unilateral Declaration of Independence on 11 November 1965, the RLI became one of the country's main counter-insurgency units during the Rhodesian Bush War, which pitted the government security forces against the rival guerrilla campaigns of Zimbabwe African National Liberation Army (ZANLA) and the Zimbabwe People's Revolutionary Army (ZIPRA). An all-white regiment, the RLI was made up wholly of professional soldiers until 1973, when capable conscripted national servicemen were first introduced. Foreign volunteers from across the world, including many veterans of foreign conflicts, also joined and became a key part of the Regiment. The RLI was nicknamed \\"The Saints\\" or \\"The Incredibles.\\" It was regarded, through astounding success with both internal Fireforce operations in Rhodesia and external preemptive strikes against guerrillas based in Mozambique and Zambia, as one of the world's foremost exponents of counter-insurgency warfare. So prominent were the airborne aspects of typical RLI operations that the battalion became a parachute regiment in 1976. The RLI served under the short-lived government of Zimbabwe Rhodesia in 1979, and the interim British government that followed. After serving under the new government of Zimbabwe for a brief period, the unit was disbanded in October 1980. The RLI's tactics and training contributed to repeated successes in its counter-insurgency operations. \\"The advantage this gave them...\\" says United States Army Lieutenant-Colonel Dave Grossman, \\"...added up to nothing less than total tactical superiority.\\" Alexandre Binda writes that the RLI \\"...earned for itself an enviable reputation as one of the world's foremost anti-terrorist forces,\\" while Major Charles D.

As a premise, a commando could have five troops, of which only four troops were normally activated. However, with the arrival of Intake 150 (in May 1976), the commandos were up to full strength for the first and only time. Some of the commandos mustered five troops until the end of 1976; with the university students demobbing at the end of 1976, the commandos reverted to four troops (in 2 Commando's case 9 Troop was deactivated). The troops in each commando relayed R&R; (military) consistently one at a time, which meant that the average fighting strength of a commando in bush mode was just over 70 men. Depending on the deployment and/or purpose, troops were divided into a small headquarters and either two 'patrols' or three 'sections'. Support Commando had a history dissimilar to all the other units and had been called Support Group for the era prior to 1976. = Base group = Battalion Headquarters ‚Äî Front and Rear ‚Äî was called Base Group after Support Group branched out from the original Headquarters Company. Base Group imparted logistical, operational and tactical support at the Front, through specialised sub-units, and organised administrative support (regimental policing, training, store keeping, record keeping and accounting, trucking, catering, nursing, etc.) at the Rear. A sizable portion of the administrative support was performed by detachments from various military services (Services Corps, Medical Corps, etc.) stationed at Cranborne Barracks.  Signals Troop and Tracking Troop  Signals Troop and Tracking Troop were specialised sub- units that interpolated into Support Group or Base Group and worked with all the Commandos. A high percentage of Signals Troop had served in one or more Commandos before being selected and trained (in-house) as communicators; they focused on front line communications in support of special operations and airborne forces. Others were trained by the Corps of Signals and provided essential services (exchange of classified information, etc.) for the Battalion. During the early planning stages for proposed changes to Support Group, it was accepted that Base Group was more suitable as the cynosure for all signals. The troop headquarters section was relocated to the RLI Joint Operations Command (JOC), and a team of specialist operators ‚Äî properly cross- trained as proficient riflemen for combat duties ‚Äî was attached to and deployed with each of the Commandos. So Signals Troop was scattered but still functioned as the vital organ that connected all the detachments in the combined operations network. Tracking Troop was also sedulous and operated out of Base Group in the same manner as Signals Troop; a number of specialist trackers would be attached to a Commando as/when required to be dropped onto spoor for follow-up work. The new Selous Scouts Regiment had requested some specialist trackers for a combative tracking unit, so Tracking Troop was disbanded and a distinct home found for everyone concerned ‚Äî primarily within the Selous Scouts unit and RLI, but also the SAS (Rhodesian Special Air Service). The majority were transmigrated to Support Group where they eventually became known as Reconnaissance Troop after the change to a Commando was actualised. = Support Group/Commando = Support Commando had been called Support Group and came from the original Headquarters Company; consequently, they had some additional skills and resources. Support Commando had a Headquarters and four cross-trained Troops: Mortar, Assault Pioneer, Anti-Tank and Reconnaissance, so every commando was a similar size (4 troops). The troops were not renamed because they maintained their capacity to provide the battalion with supporting fire and specialised resources in both conventional warfare and counter insurgency operations. During most counter- insurgency operations Support Commando fulfilled the same role as all the other commandos, which was enough to justify the change from being called Support Group. Mortar Troop was equipped with 81mm mortars and consisted of a headquarters section and three purposeful sections (two mortars per section). Assault Pioneer Troop provided the Battalion with combat engineering capabilities through a headquarters section and three purposeful sections. Anti-Tank Troop was equipped with six 106mm recoilless rifles, and also consisted of a headquarters section and three purposeful sections (two anti- tank weapons per section, each mounted on a modified Rodef 2.5). The remnants of Tracking Troop, with additional resources for reconnoitering, were the basis for the fourth troop: Reconnaissance Troop.  Ranks  The RLI was a fledgling unit when operations started, and it needed to grow and mature; albeit a very prominent unit in the permanent forces, its size did not warrant a full Colonel. Sometimes the Officer Commanding a Commando/Group was a Captain. The ranks above Colour (Staff) Sergeant were addressed as \\"Sir\\" by the subordinate ranks. The Officers would refer to a CSM (WO2) as \\"Sergeant Major\\" and the RSM (WO1) as \\"R-S-M\\". All ranks tended to be called \\"troopies\\" by the Rhodesian media.  Operations  Operational areas of the Rhodesian Security Forces during the Bush War. The RLI was at the forefront of the Rhodesian Bush War, a conflict between the internationally unrecognised government, made up mostly of the country's minority whites, and communist guerrillas attempting to overthrow it and introduce majority rule. The Bush War had started in earnest on 21 December 1972, when Zimbabwe African National Liberation Army (ZANLA) insurgents attacked Altena and Whistlefield Farms near the north-eastern town of Centenary, and lasted until the Lancaster House Agreement of 1979. The country became known as Zimbabwe the following year.  Fireforce actions  The RLI's characteristic deployment was the Fireforce rapid response operation, first created at Mount Darwin and then tested at Centenary in June 1974. This was an operational assault or reaction composed of a first wave of 32 soldiers (as a rule) carried to the scene by three helicopters and one DC-3 Dakota, called \\"Dak\\", with a command/gun helicopter and a light attack aircraft in support. The latter was a Cessna Skymaster, armed with two roof mounted .303 Browning machine-guns and normally two 37 mm SNEB rocket pods and/or two small napalm bombs called Frantans, and/or two mini-Golf bombs which were manufactured in Rhodesia. The RLI became extremely adept at the execution of this very technical type of military operation. A Commando would be based at an airfield with usually four helicopters, one DC-3 Dakota and the Cessna (known as the \\"Lynx\\"). One of these helicopters was equipped with a MG 151/20 20mm cannon and seating arrangement for the mastermind of the engagement, usually the officer commanding of the Commando. This helicopter was called the K-car with a crew of three consisting of the pilot, a technician (gunner), and the fireforce commander. The other helicopters used in each call-out, known as G-cars, were typically Alouette Mk IIIs, though in 1979 a few Bell UH-1s were used. The G-cars were armed with fully automatic weapons (the original FN MAG was replaced by twin Browning .303 machine-guns) and each carried one Stop ‚Äî the stick leader, a machine- gunner and two riflemen ‚Äî along with the pilot and his technician, who also operated the helicopter's machine-gun(s). The carrying capacity of the G-car dictated the combat organisation of the Commando: Stop-1 was assigned to the first G-car, Stop-2 to the second, and Stop-3 to the third. Stop-4 to Stop-8 were paratroopers in the Dakota. Alouette III helicopters acquired by the Royal Rhodesian Air Force in 1962. The RLI used these helicopters for its Fireforce operations. In more detail, each Stop of four soldiers (called a \\"Stick\\") had: one leader with a FN FAL and 100 rounds (also a VHF radio to communicate); one machine-gunner with a FN MAG and 400 rounds; and two riflemen, each with a FN FAL and 100 rounds (plus hand-grenades, rifle- grenades and medical supplies). All the rounds were 7.62 √ó 51 mm NATO. From early 1979 onward, a radio was also issued to one of the riflemen. The Dakota carried five stops of paratroopers, two on the port side and three on the starboard side. Apart from the parachutes, paratroopers equipment was tantamount to heliborne-troopers equipment; but the paratroopers had other problems akin to jumping. Every machine-gunner had to jump with his weapon strapped to his side. Together the eight stops, 32 men in total, were described as the \\"First Wave\\". Each Fireforce took charge of huge swathes of the country (many thousands of square miles). Inherently there were only three permanent Fireforce bases. Any sighting of the enemy was reported and a siren sounded at the most convenient base. The First Wave of heliborne-troopers, already in a state of alacrity, would grab their weapon and webbing (and everything else that they needed) while rushing to the helicopters. At the same time, the paratroopers would run to a designated place where their equipment was kept ready, and dispatchers (usually assisted by off-duty comrades) would help them kit out. Normally the Second Wave, called the Landtail, rushed to trucks, although if \\"jousting\\" or the \\"scene\\" was nearby they would wait at the airfield to be picked up by the helicopters after the First Wave had been deployed. Soldiers alternated as Heliborne troopers, Paratroopers, Landtail, and Off-duty throughout the Bush Trip. The Landtail was often an important factor as they helped with refueling the helicopters and recovering the deceased enemy (and their weapons), the parachutes and other equipment. Sometimes a smaller Third Wave had to prepare if numbers permitted; but quite often, only the First Wave was engaged in shooting. In general, most soldiers preferred to be in the Heliborne First Wave and, although the number of operational parachute jumps was truly remarkable, the majority of soldiers were carried into action by helicopter. The most important factors, apart from the reaction of the enemy and the terrain, in a Fireforce operation were the reliability of intelligence and the skill of the operations commander. The majority of successful engagements were enabled by the skills of the Selous Scouts (many of whom were former enemy); they had the capacity to insert observation posts into the bush without being noticed by the inhabitants. The difficulty of commanding the scene was extreme and good Fireforce commanders were highly prized by the men. Any advance warning for the enemy of the approaching helicopters, and the anticipated reactions caused by surprise and confusion, were decisive factors in the coming engagement. Wind direction/speed, the presence of a tree covered ridge-line, or a multitude of other factors could make the difference between life or death. If the enemy was trapped in adverse terrain, such as a simple village surrounded by open ground, normally no-one escaped unless it was near nightfall.  Other actions  In addition to Fireforce, the four Commandos were often used as special forces in patrolling actions, mostly inside Rhodesia, but sometimes inside Zambia and Mozambique. During these operations troops were required to carry well over of equipment for five to ten days on patrol. Upon their return to base for re-supply, they were often required to turnaround and patrol again in short order. Attacks were also carried out on enemy camps within Zambia (in the case of ZIPRA) and Mozambique (against ZANLA); these attacks usually involved two or more Commandos. The Rhodesian Special Air Service, used almost exclusively for external operations, often accompanied the Rhodesian Light Infantry on these operations, as did the Selous Scouts. = Patrols = Most of the Rhodesian Light Infantry's patrol operations took place in Rhodesia, though some patrols occurred in Zambia and Mozambique. Patrolling bush trips were unpopular with the troops due to the arduous nature of the duty and the comparative lack of action to Fireforce operations. A Commando could be more exhausted from a patrolling bush trip than the most intense Fireforce period, even if the unit saw more combat in the latter. However the nature of patrolling work greatly expanded the minds of the troops. Patrols varied from travelling by day and setting up ambushes at night, to observation post work, where a position was occupied to observe the locality. Extreme precautions were made to be clandestine on these observation posts, though it was suspected that the locals were often aware of the Observation Post's presence. Regardless the type of patrol, a night march would normally be made to the area. Conditions could make this task most difficult, especially when it was so dark that the troopies were completely blind. Scarcity of water could present an issue to the patrol. The civilians were not regarded as hostiles by the troops. There were numerous occasions when they helped each other and process of great empathy took place. If a patrol learned of enemy presence the patrol force immediately moved to engage the enemy. On occasions the patrols were ambushed. Patrols in Mozambique were considered the most hazardous, due to the violent reaction of FRELIMO (also known as FPML). = Externals = The RLI carried out external assaults on guerrilla bases in Zambia (against ZIPRA) and Mozambique (against ZANLA); there were many of these, and also one in Botswana. The larger raids combined Fireforce teams and were similarly executed, save for the greater scale of planning and logistics. There were also several raids by individual Commandos where the presence of FRELIMO units led to greater resistance. Just like in a regular Fireforce operation, the element of surprise was most important. Canberra and Hunter jets would bomb the target just before the Commandos arrived; and outcomes could be out of all reason, from total \\"lemons\\" to the most successful days in the Battalion's history. For example, when three Commandos of the Battalion participated in an attack on ZIPRA camps in Zambia in October 1978, there were no enemy casualties. November 1977's Operation Dingo, a joint attack by the RLI and Rhodesian SAS on ZANLA camps in Mozambique at Chimoio and Tembue, is retrospectively described by Squadron Leader P. J. H. Petter-Bowyer as an \\"astounding success\\". \\"Operation Dingo cost ZANLA in excess of 3,000 trained men and something in the order of 5,000 wounded, many too seriously to be of further use,\\" he writes. \\"Others lost all interest in the fighting and deserted.\\" From the Rhodesian side, six men were wounded and two were killed. The stop of four was used in these raids (though they were organised into larger entities). The plans for these raids varied from sudden and fairly simple operations (subject to change on the fly) to highly intricate. The political situation interfered on occasions and this was much resented: the troops always thought that these operations were most important.  Armaments  Riflemen were equipped with a 7.62√ó51mm NATO battle rifle, preferring the Belgian FN FAL or its variants: the British-made L1A1 Self-Loading Rifle (L1A1 SLR) and the South African R1. The Heckler & Koch G3A3, with its origins in West Germany, was also an option. All RLI members were armed with FN FALs by 1968. The primary infantry support weapon was the 7.62√ó51mm belt-fed FN MAG. Soldiers also carried a variety of hand grenades including high-explosive (HE), white-phosphorus (WP), and colored smoke. To prevent accidental ignition of a grenade, the safety levers which upon release activated the fuse of the grenade, were taped down. Soldiers were issued HE and WP rifle grenades as well as anti-tank grenades or rockets. Sometimes \\"bunker bombs\\" were carried. Machine-gunners and some riflemen carried sidearms. The 7.62√ó51mm round fired by the FAL and the MAG had a significant range advantage compared to the 7.62√ó39mm round fired by the AK-47, SKS, RPD, and RPK firearms normally carried by the ZANLA and ZIPRA forces. The 7.62√ó51mm NATO round has been proven effective out to 800 meters, whereas the 7.62√ó39mm is considered less effective (out to ¬± 400 meters). This disparity in effectiveness, combined with the higher training standards and experiences of the RLI, would probably be a decisive factor in engagements when the RLI forces could fire upon the enemy from a distance (less dangerous return fire). Still, the RLI favoured being close to the enemy. Issued webbing was not used much which led to a bewildering array of webbing/packs. Often the stops stayed the night at a Fireforce scene and sometimes patrolled the area the next day, other times these operations led into the night and through the following day. On direct action missions, additional ammunition was issued to all soldiers for their personal weapons as well as for squad weapons such as mortars and machine- guns. Bergens with rations (water, batteries for the squad radio, etc.) were carried on patrols. Riflemen were required to carry a panga, which could be used to chop down bush to create a landing zone so that helicopters could extract them. Strangely, some riflemen tried not to carry this piece of equipment, while some gunners and stop commanders (also known as stick leaders and whose rank varied from Trooper to Captain) did carry them. Only the Stop Commanders carried mini-flares. These devices were about the size and shape of a large pencil, which were used to signal positions, though never at night, and were popular with the troops. The parachute harnesses were Saviac Mk1s, of U.S. manufacture. They were extremely reliable with a reserve parachute on the chest. The parachutes were overhead static line. From 1977 onwards the RLI was forbidden to wear shorts on operations, due to the dangerous visibility of the soldiers' white legs. This rule was strictly adhered to, but a rule which required troops to wear ankle-boots when in para-stops was often broken. The number of parachute injuries on ops was insignificant, despite (or perhaps, because of) around half of landings falling into trees. Sometimes they fell onto boulders or buildings or fences or boggy ground. Fields varied from as hard as concrete to soil so dry and diffuse that it swallowed them up. Extremely fast \\"ground rush\\" was frequently experienced, due to taking place on the sides or top of great hills. Confusingly the stops in the Dak were dropped in \\"sticks\\", supposedly noted in entries in the parachute log books held by troops ‚Äî which were filled in by themselves ‚Äî as other data pertinent to the jump. This resulted in the log books often being filled with false data. The port side of the Dak was much preferable than the starboard. There were many times when exiting from G-cars was extremely dangerous due to not being able to descend close enough (because of trees, etc.). The stick then had to carefully clamber out and hold on to the side-step before jumping from a greater height, all while a mass of leaves and twigs whirled about inside the helicopter causing much more stress for the pilot and his technician. Alouettes were extremely reliable and much more capable of dropping off stops in rough terrain, although they had a tendency to sway a little as the troops jumped out, but the Bells had more carrying capacity, range and speed. Browning .303 Mk II machine-gun, as equipped to K-cars and G-cars on Fireforce. Both these vehicles were armed with twin-Browning M1919 machine- guns chambered in .303 British, which were never indiscriminately fired by the tech. The K-car Gunners had to be careful, for there was always a shortage of 20mm rounds and there were many times when troops were only yards away from the target. K-cars with four Browning .303 machine-guns (instead of the 20mm cannon) were not popular with the troops, as they were less effective. The numbers of the enemy killed by the K-car in a scene varied from zero to all (and are included in the estimate for those killed). On some Fireforce operations Hunter jets were used, and more rarely, Vampires. Up to the second quarter of 1979, troops were required to collect and remove all deceased persons from the scene. This rule was very strictly adhered to, even if it reduced in the short term the effectiveness of the Fireforce (due to the immense effort of it). The plight of the civilians was most profoundly realised by the troops.  Casualties  The Rhodesian Light Infantry Regimental Association maintains a Roll of Honour which lists 85 men killed in action from March 1968 to December 1979. A further 15 are listed as having died on operations from September 1961 to December 1979. Another 34 are listed as deceased from other causes, from 1961 to December 1979. Of the 85 killed in action, 66 occurred in the last four years of the war, thirty-one in 1979 alone. These figures mirror fairly accurately the ratio of combat the Battalion was in. The number of wounded is not known. It is known that in one of the Commandos there were more than 50 wounded in action in a two-year period where it had 21 killed in action. There were of course many other casualties, from accidents and illness/disease, or bad landings on jumps. These figures are very low for a battalion that was involved in so much combat, though it must be remembered that the Commandos were both smaller than the companies of the average strength infantry battalion of modern warfare and fighting with modern weapons and tactics against a relatively untrained, though well equipped, foe. United States Army Lt-Col Dave Grossman wrote:  Conclusion  The Trooper, the RLI's regimental statue, on the grounds of Hatfield House in England in 2014 The 1st Battalion, Rhodesian Light Infantry, was a special forces light infantry unit highly capable of performing any task ordered, no matter the means of transport (whether crossing the Zambezi river in little boats, walking long miles with huge weights, or riding high in G-cars and Daks), no matter what type of operation. Supposing the enemy was always at a disadvantage, with no air support and very limited means of communication, the soldiers always continued to seek them ‚Äî even when left without conveyance. The men liked to walk close to the enemy, believing it to be the most efficient way of finding them, and dealing with them. In the words of Alexandre Binda, the RLI \\"...earned for itself an enviable reputation as one of the world's foremost anti-terrorist forces.\\" Following the creation and independence of the Republic of Zimbabwe (April 1980), the ultimate military parade of the RLI, for the ceremonial laying-up of its regimental colours, took place at Cranborne Barracks on 17 October 1980. The unit's last commanding officer, J. C. W. Aust, recalled being \\"amazed\\" by the large crowd of allegiant spectators surrounding the parade square, including the former government minister P. K. van der Byl who attended unannounced. A Rhodesian Air Force Alouette III helicopter unexpectedly arrived overhead, during the final ceremony, in Aust's words \\"...circling, in a moving salute and farewell\\". Two weeks later, the Rhodesian Light Infantry was disbanded ‚Äî on 31 October 1980. A nucleus of RLI officers and other personnel (instructors) became involved in training and helping to form the First Zimbabwe Commando Battalion of the Zimbabwe National Army. The regimental statue, \\"The Trooper\\" (or \\"The Troopie\\") left Zimbabwe on 28 July 1980 on a South African Air Force C-130 Hercules, together with the regiment's documents/records, trophies and other paraphernalia. By arrangement, everything was put into storage at the South African National Museum of Military History in Johannesburg ... and thereafter moved to the British Empire and Commonwealth Museum in Bristol, England. The Trooper statue now stands on the grounds of Hatfield House, country seat of the Marquess of Salisbury, where it was re-dedicated on 28 September 2008. A copy of the statue also exists in South Africa.

History  The album was released in 1998 and was the second live offering from Delirious? after Live & In the Can, which was released a few years prior. It was recorded on a leg of the band's legendary first full UK tour, at the Southampton Guildhall venue. Originally d:tour 1997 Live @ Southampton on first publication, the title was later shortened to d:tour 1997 Live on reprints. It is now known simply as d:tour in fan circles. As with Live and in the Can, special packaging was produced for the album, this time in the form of a cardboard slip case with internal artwork. The tour featured the songs of the band's first full studio album, King of Fools, several of which are featured here. Other songs on the album include \\"Come Like You Promise\\", which was originally found on a long out of print solo album by guitarist Stu G, Have You Heard? It also appeared on Live & In the Can, was later rerecorded as a b-side for the single \\"It's OK\\", and now appears on the compilation album Deeper. \\"Summer Of Love\\" also appears, having only previously been released as a b-side on the DeEPer EP.  Reception  It was released to critical acclaim, \\"The Phantom Tollbooth\\", gave the album four out of five stars. Cross Rhythms gave the album a 10/10 grade in a review by renowned Christian music journalist and radio producer Mike Rimmer who said, \\"This little beaut of an album is a stark, raw, powerful snatch of the heady atmosphere.\\"  Current Status  In the modern day, whilst still revered by many fans, d:tour is now difficult to find, after having been out of print for several years. Delirious? have since removed all traces of its existence from its official website, not mentioning it in the discography and not supplying it to sellers. However, it is still mentioned in the slip notes for their 2002 compilation album Deeper. Live footage of the gig is available on the DVD release Archive:D, which contains the video version of the gig, previously released on VHS as A View From The Terraces.

The current Washington High School was constructed in 1992 adjacent to Paul Brown Tiger Stadium. Football Football came to the Massillon in 1894 with the first high school game between Massillon High School and Canton Central High School. In the early years, the players consisted of working boys because most boys did not attend high school. By 1904 more boys began attending school past 8th grade. 1909 was Massillon's first undefeated football team. From 1910-1920 high school football in Massillon grew and improved, and by 1916 they were named the Scholastic Champions of Ohio. The school mascot, the Tiger, was adopted from the city's former professional football team known as the Massillon Tigers. Paul Brown, a 1925 graduate of Washington High School, returned to Massillon in 1932 to begin his renowned coaching career. In his nine years at Massillon, Brown posted an 80‚Äì8‚Äì2 record which included a 35-game winning streak and six state championships. thumb209x209px Famous resident football player, coach and founder-owner of the Cleveland Browns and Cincinnati Bengals Paul Brown is memorialized in statue form in front of Massillon, Ohio's \\"Paul Brown Tiger Stadium\\". The Massillon Tigers are historically one of the winningest high school football teams in the United States, currently ranked 5th in the nation in all-time wins. The Tigers have compiled a current record of 880 wins, 290 losses, and 36 ties. Along with the Canton McKinley High School Bulldogs, the Tigers represent one half of what many consider to be the greatest high school football rivalry in the nation. It is the only high school contest in America to feature odds in Las Vegas. In 128 meetings (1894‚Äì2017), Massillon leads the series 70-53-5. Massillon and their fierce rivalry with Canton are subjects of the 2001 documentary film Go Tigers!. A total of 23 professional players, 3 NFL coaches and 14 collegiate all-Americans have graduated from Massillon High School. The Tigers play their home games at Paul Brown Tiger Stadium. The stadium currently holds 16,600 people and is named after former Tiger player and head coach Paul Brown. Besides being the regular season home of the Massillon Tiger Football team, the stadium hosts Ohio High School Athletic Association state football playoff games, divisional championship games, as well as numerous other activities such as band shows and other sports including soccer. Every fall, the booster club provides a live tiger cub named \\"Obie\\" who is on the sidelines for each home football game. So strong is the tradition and history, the booster club provides each baby boy born in Massillon a miniature football. In summer 2008, due to the success of the Tigers' athletic programs, ESPN nominated the city of Massillon as a candidate for Titletown USA. The final results ended with Massillon finishing in the top 4. =Titles= Prior to the implementation of the playoff system in 1972, Washington High School won the Ohio AP State Championship title 24 times; however, they have never won a State Title in any sport in the playoff era. The Tigers were state runners-up in 2018 (lost 42-28 to Archbishop Hoban) and 2019 (lost 34-17 to La Salle). They have been recognized as the AP National Champions nine times ‚Äì in 1935, 1936, 1939, 1940, 1950, 1952, 1953, 1959, 1961 ‚Äì the most in the nation. =Past coaches= * Hap Fugate, 1909‚Äì1911 (19‚Äì8‚Äì3) * Sidney Jones, 1912‚Äì1913 (9‚Äì9‚Äì1) * John Snavely, 1914‚Äì1919 (41‚Äì8‚Äì2) * Elmer Snyder, 1920 (3‚Äì4‚Äì1) * Dave Stewart, 1921‚Äì1925 (38‚Äì9) * Dan Atkinson, 1926‚Äì1927 (8‚Äì7‚Äì3) * Elmer McGrew, 1928‚Äì1931 (20‚Äì16‚Äì4) * Paul Brown, 1932‚Äì1940 (80‚Äì8‚Äì2) * Bud Houghton, 1941, 1946‚Äì1947 (21‚Äì6‚Äì3) * Elwood Kammer, 1942‚Äì1944 (26‚Äì4) * Augie Morningstar, 1945 (5‚Äì0‚Äì5) * Chuck Mather, 1948‚Äì1953 (57‚Äì3) * Tom Harp, 1954‚Äì1955 (17‚Äì2‚Äì1) * Lee Tressel, 1956‚Äì1957 (16‚Äì3) * Leo Strang, 1958‚Äì1963 (54‚Äì8‚Äì1) * Earle Bruce, 1964‚Äì1965 (20‚Äì0) * Bob Seaman, 1966‚Äì1968 (20‚Äì9‚Äì1) * Bob Commings, 1969‚Äì1973 (43‚Äì6‚Äì2) * Chuck Shuff, 1974‚Äì1975 (12‚Äì7‚Äì1) * Mike Currence, 1976‚Äì1984 (79‚Äì16‚Äì2) * John Maronto, 1985‚Äì1987 (20‚Äì10) * Lee Owens, 1988‚Äì1991 (35‚Äì13) * Jack Rose, 1992‚Äì1997 (48‚Äì17) * Rick Shepas, 1998‚Äì2004 (53‚Äì27) * Tom Stacey, 2005‚Äì2007 (26‚Äì11) * Jason Hall, 2008‚Äì2014 (57‚Äì21) * , 2015‚Äìpresent Notable individuals * Andy Alleman, offensive lineman; played college football at the University of Akron; Played for the NFL's Kansas City Chiefs * Paul Brown, Washington H.S.

Massillon Tiger Swing Band  The Massillon Tiger Swing Band was created by the legendary George \\"Red\\" Bird in 1938 during the Paul Brown era of Massillon football. The band became known as \\"The Greatest Show in High School Football\\" and is still a very important part of the Massillon football tradition. The band's swing style includes moving formations and musicians marching with a swing step. The Tiger Swing band begins every home football game with the traditional hometown songs of \\"Massillon Will Shine\\", \\"Stand Up and Cheer\\" (to acknowledge the other team), ‚ÄúEye of the Tiger‚Äù, ‚ÄúSeven Nation Army‚Äù, The W.H.S. Alma Mater, and The Star Spangled Banner/ The National Anthem. At the beginning of each half time show, they perform what is known as \\"Opening Routine\\". This is a tradition that goes back for decades and consists of the band's entrance (\\"Turn Arounds\\") followed by \\"Fanfare\\", \\"Tiger Rag\\" and \\"Carry On\\". This entire routine is marched at 180 beats per minute and is practiced from the beginning of the rehearsals through the entire season. Each home game the Swing Band performs a new halftime show for the crowd, always with a theme. The band includes the Drum Major, Majorettes, and the mascot, Obie. The Swing Band is currently directed by Jason Neel, who has been the head director since 2005. The 2011 edition of the Massillon Tiger Swing Band had an enrollment of 137.

In the Canadian Forces, an armoury is a place where a reserve unit trains, meets, and parades. History Le R√©giment de Hull, which is housed in Salaberry Armoury, formed on 7 August 1914. The Regiment, which is a unit of the Reserve Armoured Corps, is the only Francophone unit in the National Capital Region. The armoury was built beginning on 1 January 1938, designed by the architect Lucien Sarra-Bournet in the late Ch√¢teau Style with a steeply pitched gable roof and prominent chimneys. The armoury was named after Colonel Charles de Salaberry, a hero of the War of 1812. The armoury, which has been identified as an historic site is one of a series of armouries built across Canada during the 1930s. During World War II, this building was the scene of local recruitment efforts. Salaberry Armoury is a Recognized Federal Heritage Building.

Every piece was made-to-order, and when not needed it was neither sold nor discarded. At least one out-of-the-way room was selected to store the pieces that were not in use. This was called the lumber room. Such is what is alluded to in the definition in the Oxford English Dictionary (OED), whose first reference is Richardson's novel Pamela (1740) and which is mentioned in a bit more detail in Daniel Pool's literary reference book of the 1990s, What Jane Austen Ate and Charles Dickens Knew, among other literary reference works. The phrase 'lumber room' is found in British fiction at least during the 19th century (e.g., Arthur Conan Doyle's 1891 Sherlock Holmes short story \\"The Five Orange Pips\\"), and the use of the word lumber in this phrase is that found in many obsolescent turns of phrase heard in various English-speaking countries. Probably one of the most evocative references is the short story by \\"Saki\\" (H. H. Munro) called \\"The Lumber Room\\": \\"Often and often Nicholas had pictured to himself what the lumber-room might be like, that region that was so carefully sealed from youthful eyes and concerning which no questions were ever answered. It came up to his expectations. In the first place it was large and dimly lit, one high window opening on to the forbidden garden being its only source of illumination. In the second place it was a storehouse of unimagined treasures.\\"http://www.readbookonline.net/readOnLine/397/ accessed 10/06/2010 In Charles Dickens' A Christmas Carol, the lumber room is one of several places Scrooge looks for intruders when he returns to his dismal, dark home after his \\"melancholy meal in his melancholy tavern\\" on Christmas Eve. The concept of a lumber room is also referenced by J.R.R. Tolkien in Book 1 of The Fellowship of the Ring: \\"His memory is like a lumber room. Thing wanted always buried.\\" referring to Barliman Butterburr, the owner of the Prancing Pony in Bree. The OED mentions in the verb \\"lumbering\\" that it first meant to obstruct with pieces of wood to make things from, and then shifted to general obstruction, hence furniture fit the later meaning.

The soup is usually accompanied by slices of paio, chouri√ßo or lingui√ßa (boiled separately with that water being discarded, the sausage added last minute to the soup), and with Portuguese broa corn-bread or rye-bread for dipping. In Portugal, caldo verde is typically consumed during Portuguese celebrations, such as weddings, birthdays, and popular celebrations. For example, the St. John festival, in Braga or Porto. It is sometimes consumed before a main course meal or as a late supper.

He was the youngest son of retired professional wrestler Ric Flair, younger half-brother of wrestler David Flair. Amateur wrestling career Fliehr attended Providence High School in Charlotte, North Carolina and Blair Academy in New Jersey, and was an accomplished amateur wrestler achieving numerous awards. During a tournament, Fliehr attacked another competitor after he taunted Fliehr by mocking his father. In April 1998, Fliehr won the AAU National Wrestling Tournament. Professional wrestling career =World Championship Wrestling (1998‚Äì2000)= Fliehr wrestled two matches in the now defunct World Championship Wrestling (WCW). In the first, on October 4, 1998, he was ten years old when he defeated Eric Bischoff and on June 12, 2000, he teamed with his father Ric in a loss to David Flair and Vince Russo in a tag team match. =Independent circuit and All Japan Pro Wrestling (2008‚Äì2013)= Flair (left) in a tag team match with Greg Valentine Fliehr made an appearance on March 29, 2008 during the WWE Hall of Fame. The next night, he made his first WrestleMania appearance with his family representing Ric Flair in the Hall of Fame. He also sat at ringside during the WrestleMania XXIV event. He appeared on Raw the following night with his family to honor his father's career. Throughout 2008, Flair was trained by Harley Race. Flair made his debut on December 6, 2008, under the name \\"Reid Flair\\", teaming with his elder brother David to defeat The Nasty Boys in Charlotte, North Carolina, with Hulk Hogan as the special guest referee. He wrestled for many independent promotions such as Big Time Wrestling and Northeast Wrestling. On April 11, 2009, Flair, his brother David, and Brad Anderson beat Jeff Lewis, C.W. Anderson and Masked Superstar at an NWA Charlotte show. The match ended controversially with a double pin, when Flair pinned Lewis while CW Anderson pinned Brad Anderson. At the end of the match, Flair was awarded the NWA Mid-Atlantic Heritage Championship belt. At NWA Charlotte's next show on May 25, however, Lewis was announced as the NWA Mid-Atlantic Heritage Champion, with no explanation given. On May 2, he and David took on Buff Bagwell and Rikki Nelson and would lose. In June 2010, Reid teamed up with George South Jr. to take part in The Anderson Brothers Classic 4 Tournament where they defeated Caleb Konley and Cedric Alexander in the semi finals and Charlie Dreamer and Jake Manning in the final. In August he made his debut for Lucha Libre USA. In the same month next year he participated in NWA Future Legends Tournament and lost to John Skyler in the semi-final. In late 2012, it was reported that Flair had started training with All Japan Pro Wrestling. Flair made his in-ring debut for All Japan on January 26, 2013, when he replaced his sick father in a tag team match, where he and Keiji Mutoh were defeated by Seiya Sanada and Tatsumi Fujinami, with Sanada submitting him for the win. During February, Flair worked All Japan's Excite Series tour, wrestling undercard tag team matches. On March 15, Flair wrestled his first singles match in All Japan, submitting Yasufumi Nakanoue with the figure-four leglock. Flair returned to the United States following All Japan's March 17 event, which was 12 days before his death. Personal life Fliehr was born in Charlotte, North Carolina, to professional wrestler Ric Flair and Elizabeth Fliehr. He was the youngest of two siblings; he has a half-sister, Megan, a half-brother, David, and sister, Ashley. Fliehr attended and graduated from Providence High School in 2006. His favorite band was Guns N' Roses. Fliehr was arrested on June 23, 2007, for assault and battery, and was released after posting bail. On March 4, 2009, Fliehr was arrested for driving while impaired in Mecklenburg County, North Carolina, and was released after posting $1000 in bail. Fliehr was arrested again on April 26, 2009. After crashing his car, police found black tar heroin inside it, and he faced felony charges. He was also charged with driving while impaired, driving with a revoked license, and possession of drug paraphernalia, and was released after posting $15,000 in bail. He later overdosed twice in 2011. During the Ric Flair 30 for 30 special, Triple H revealed that Fliehr wanted to sign a developmental contract with WWE but failed two drug tests, the second one being announced and actually worse than the first test. Ric, in denial of his son's problems, told Triple H that he thought that Fliehr had gotten a \\"supplement from GNC\\" instead of being honest with himself of Fliehr's real problems. Ric later admitted during the 30 for 30 special that he felt that he may have been a best friend to Reid at times when Reid would have been better served with Ric acting as his father. =Death= On March 29, 2013, Flair was found dead in bed at a Residence Inn in the SouthPark neighborhood of Charlotte, North Carolina. He was 25 years old. On June 14, 2013, Fliehr's autopsy revealed that it was drug overdose of heroin and traces of two prescription tranquilizers, clonazepam, and alprazolam, which contributed to his death. =Posthumous Raw controversy= On November 16, 2015, six days before Survivor Series, Reid's sister WWE Divas Champion Charlotte signed a contract to face Paige at the event. Charlotte proclaimed she was doing this for Reid as a tribute to him. Paige then mocked her by saying that \\"Your little baby brother, he didn't have much fight in him, did he?\\" It was later revealed that WWE did not ask permission from the Flair family to reference Reid's death, and had given no prior warning to his parents.

In 1882 Van Camp Packing Company was founded, selling catsup beginning in 1888.www.metnews.com In 1894 his son Frank Van Camp is credited with the creation of the now-famous recipe for pork and beans in tomato sauce.Gray, R. (1994). Indiana History: A Book of Readings (pp. 207‚Äì208). Bloomington: Indiana University Press. By 1898 the Van Camp Packing Company had increased annual production to six million cans. By 1909 Indiana, bolstered by the Van Camp family's company had become the nation's leading producer of canned baked beans. Frank Van Camp went on to found Van Camp Seafood. Company history The firm is considered to have been a trendsetter in the canned-foods industry. In 1933, it was acquired by James and John Stokely, who operated the Stokely canned tomato company in Newport, Tennessee, forming Stokely-Van Camp, Inc., with the resultant combined company headquartered in Indianapolis. In the 1940s, the company built two warehouses in Bellingham, Washington. By the 1970s, Stokely-Van Camp agreed to produce, market and distribute a new beverage called Gatorade. This product was the first sports drink, and would eventually generate more in sales than the rest of SVC's other products combined.The Encyclopedia of Indianapolis at Google Books Sale and brand history In 1983, the brand passed to the Quaker Oats Company when it purchased Stokely-Van Camp. Quaker Oats sold Van Camp's to ConAgra in 1995, while Stokely was sold to Seneca Foods in 1985 and currently produces canned beans and other canned vegetables. Over the years, a number of foods have been sold under the Van Camp's name, including its popular Tenderoni pasta product, but it only sells canned cooked beans, including pork and beans, baked beans, kidney beans, a vegetarian variant of its pork and bean recipe, Chili and \\"Beanee Weenee\\"‚Äîa mixture of beans with slices of frankfurter made of beef and chicken in tomato sauce.

Gypsy Sun and Rainbows Lee was an old friend of Jimi Hendrix and Billy Cox. They had all played together in various R&B; acts, and in 1969 Lee joined Hendrix's new band Gypsy Sun and Rainbows as rhythm guitarist, occasionally playing alternating lead. The newly formed band was hired to play the Woodstock Music Festival for which Hendrix had been previously booked to play as the Jimi Hendrix Experience. Lee had been back from the Vietnam war for only two weeks, was unemployed when Hendrix called him and had joined Gypsy Sun and Rainbows only a week before the Woodstock concert. At the concert Hendrix and Lee both wore white outfits, and exotic headgear was much in evidence. Lee wore a distinctive green bandana that had long tassels hanging over his eyes, which at the time he thought was a statement of originality as he explains in the Woodstock DVD, whereas Billy Cox wore a multi-coloured turban and Hendrix a bright pink bandana and large shining ear studs. Lee played a 1955 Gibson Les Paul Custom guitar and sang his own composition \\"Master Mind\\" as well as two Impressions numbers sung as a medley - \\"Gypsy Woman\\" and \\"Aware of Love\\", with Hendrix playing Curtis Mayfield style back up. Lee also took several solos and played some alternating lead (\\"weaving\\") with Hendrix. Although all the songs he sang lead on at Woodstock were recorded, the Hendrix estate owns the rights to them and has thus far prohibited their release. After Woodstock these \\"hired guns\\" briefly continued to help Hendrix develop his new style, which included the first of his classic, new \\"message\\" songs, in which Hendrix attempted to communicate his complex philosophy towards the current Vietnam war and human relationships in general: Machine Gun, Message to Love and Izabella. This group then played at the Harlem \\"United Block\\" benefit and later performed at the small \\"Salvation\\" club in Greenwich Village to a mixed reception. Lee, Velez and Sultan then went off to pursue their briefly interrupted careers. Sultan later played occasional sessions for Hendrix. Al Green years During the 1970s, Lee acted as the band director and lead guitarist for Al Green's touring band. He appeared on The Tonight Show Starring Johnny Carson and television specials around the world with Green. Lee also was a songwriter and wrote for Stax Records early recording artists, the Astors. \\"Judy\\", a song he wrote during his days playing with Hendrix in Nashville was covered by Al Green and the Spidells. Lee briefly traveled with blues great Albert King. He said King fired him because his playing overshadowed King's. In the 1980s and 90s, Lee teamed with his friend, El Espada, Timothy Lee Matthews, and they collaborated on Matthews' CD Songs for the Greats. Matthews, co-writer of the classic blues song, \\"Breaking Up Somebody's Home\\", called Lee the consummate sideman. Lee's distinctive complementary rhythm and lead style can be heard on nine of the eleven songs on Matthews' CD. Larry Lee lived in Memphis, Tennessee and played in the regional rock/blues/R&B; outfit Elmo and the Shades. Lee was a member of Elmo and the Shades for eight years and was an integral part of their success during this period. The band enjoyed much popularity during this time playing nightclubs, casinos, parties, and occasional blues festivals throughout Memphis and the Mid-South. Lee is featured on three cuts on the new CD (2009) by Elmo and The Shades, Blue Memphis. They are \\"Same Old Dog\\", \\"I Get the Blues for Free\\", and the title cut \\"Blue Memphis\\". Lee took his leave from the group in August 2006 as his battle with cancer left him too weak to perform. Larry was as soulful a blues singer and incredibly moving blues guitarist as Memphis, Beale St. and the world has ever seen. Lee also joined in with Mike Strickland and the Usual Unusual Clowns at random intervals. Death Larry Lee died in Memphis, Tennessee on October 29, 2007 after a year battling stomach cancer, and was buried at 11 a.m. on November 6 in West Tennessee Veterans Cemetery. He left wife Carrie Lee, daughter April D. Lee and three sons - Lawrence H. Lee III, Robert A. Lee, and Thomas Lee. He was also survived by his mother, Lula Lee, and five grandchildren.

The station broadcasts an active rock format as Y108. CJXY's studios are located on Main Street West (next to Highway 403) in Hamilton, while its transmitter is located atop the Niagara Escarpment near Burlington. History The station was originally launched in 1948 as 94.1 CHML-FM, a simulcast of AM station CHML. The simulcast was subsequently dropped in the 1950s, leaving the station silent. The owners relaunched the FM signal on 95.3 in 1964, with distinct programming from its AM sister station. In 1967, the station adopted the new callsign CKDS-FM, in honour of company founder Kenneth D. Soble, who had died in 1966. In 1974, CHML and CKDS-FM were purchased by ML Radio, a division of what was to become Western International Communications. On September 1, 1991, CKDS-FM dropped its long-time adult contemporary/easy listening format, and adopted the CJXY callsign and a classic rock format as Y95. In 2000, CHML and CJXY were acquired by Corus Entertainment. On August 31, 2001, CJXY swapped frequencies with Corus' CING-FM, taking over CING's former 107.9 frequency; at the same time, it changed its moniker to the current Y108. CJXY had old-time CFNY-FM host Alan Cross as program director until 2004, when he returned to CFNY. Tammy Cole is currently CJXY's program director.

The western maintained section of the route is called the Wentworth Springs Road; it begins in Georgetown, California, a hamlet in California's Gold Country. The road continues from its intersection with State Route 193 toward Wentworth Springs, where the trailhead for the unmaintained portion of the route exists adjacent to Loon Lake. The trail portion of the route is about long and passes in part through the Eldorado National Forest as well as the Tahoe National Forest and the Lake Tahoe Basin Management Unit. The eastern maintained portion of the trail is called the McKinney Rubicon Springs Road, and leads to Lake Tahoe.  Trail summary  Looking across the Granite Bowl A Jeep climbing up the first part of Walker Hill The Little Sluice Obstacle There are entrances to the trail, either at Wentworth Springs at the Loon Lake spillway or on the Lake Tahoe side along highway 89 near Tahoma. The Wentworth Springs entrance, at Gerle Creek, is the original entrance to the trail, and starts with an obstacle known as Devil's Postpile (not to be confused with Devils Postpile National Monument near Mammoth Lakes). The Loon Lake route is shorter, first crossing the Granite Bowl, a large open rock valley. (The Loon Lake entrance previously had an obstacle known as The Gatekeeper. It was demolished in October 2004 to limit trail use deemed unacceptable by the USFS and had nothing to do with erosion. The Wentworth Springs entrance joins the trail from Loon Lake shortly before Ellis Creek. After driving through the relatively mild section beyond Ellis Creek the Walker Hill obstacle is encountered. It includes a rocky climb followed by a notch that can either be straddled or side-hilled. A short distance beyond Walker Hill is the Soup Bowl. The Soup Bowl is a short climb with a series of ledges that are difficult to climb. High clearance and long wheelbases help with this obstacle. After passing the Soup Bowl, the Little Sluice awaits. The Little Sluice, also known as the Sluice Box or simply as \\"The Box\\", is close to Spider Lake. Such can be bypassed in two ways for vehicles that cannot ascend the main trail. The most common bypass route is to the left of the obstacle known as the long bypass. The second way to bypass the Little Sluice is to drive up Toyota Rock. Toyota Rock is to the right toward Spider Lake (so named because it resembles a spider from above), just before the large rocks in the Little Sluice, and leads to the slabs that surround Little Sluice. The large rocks in the Little Sluice were reduced in size in the fall of 2012 by El Dorado County in order to reduce concentrated camping and the \\"spectator\\" atmosphere at the Sluice. The section is still difficult, but difficulty has been reduced. After passing the Little Sluice the next obstacle is Thousand Dollar hill (also sometimes called Million Dollar hill). It is a rock ledge followed by a steep grade, facing downhill if driving the trail toward Lake Tahoe. As of 7/15/2012, Thousand Dollar Hill has been closed. This obstacle had a moderately difficult bypass (the original trail), which is now the only route open. The trail splits again about a half mile past this point, the lower trail continuing on the granite slabs (aka Indian Trail) or the upper trail through the Old Sluice. Both routes lead to Buck Island Lake. The granite slabs are off camber but are an easier and much quicker route to take. Before passing Buck Island Lake you come across Silby Rock. Silby Rock can be considered difficult if the wrong line has been taken. Before hitting the rock, you'll be coming out of a stream that can make the rocks slick. The trail then continues toward the Big Sluice. This downhill section contains a switchback with a rock drop-off and an off camber rocky section, leading to the Rubicon River Bridge and then into the private property of the Rubicon Springs. Rubicon Springs is on private property and must be respected as such. A cabin (in the same spot as the former 2-story hotel) houses the caretaker family. A seemingly endless number of camp spots is available around the springs, as well as a helipad for emergencies and for large events to fly supplies in. Most large events will set up base camp in the Springs because it is large enough for hundreds of people to camp. Notable annual events are the Jeepers Jamboree (maximum of 500 vehicles), the Jeep Jamboree (200 vehicles), the Toyota Land Cruiser Association's Rubithon (approximately 150-200 vehicles), and the Marlin Crawler Round-Up (approximately 150-200 vehicles). After Rubicon Springs is Cadillac Hill. Cadillac Hill is a series of switchbacks up to Observation Point, starting with a rutted out section with many exposed tree roots. After turning a hairpin the trail becomes very off camber and contains a series of boulders to maneuver around or over. After that is a steep stairstep obstacle to climb. At the top of the hill is Observation Point, a good place to see where you have just driven and to take a short break before the long dirt road back to Lake Tahoe. There are a few small sections of rocks like \\"Potato Patch\\" and the \\"Slabs\\" after this but nothing that poses a significant obstacle.  Rubicon land use issues  A stock Ford Ranger descending Big Sluice In 2001 the Lahontan Water Board contemplated filing an order to force closure of the east end of the trail near the Tahoe Basin. In order to prevent this closure Friends of the Rubicon (FOTR), a grass-roots, user-driven organization was formed and built more than thirty erosion control devices on the trail in order to prevent erosion and siltation of the watershed. The Lahontan Water Board dropped their effort and FOTR kept the trail open and have conducted many work projects on the trail each year since then. The initial organized effort to close the trail involved embroiling El Dorado County in an effort to manage the trail. This effort resulted in the Rubicon Trail Master Plan which the county rejected because it was projected to be too costly. Most of the costs involved were for monitoring, not for fixing problems on the trail. When the Master Plan effort failed multiple complaints were filed with the Central Valley Regional Water Quality Board. The complaints were that the trail was causing erosion and siltation of the watershed, sanitation problems were not being addressed, and OHVs were spilling oil on the trail. These complaints resulted in a Draft Cleanup and Abatement Order that would have closed the trail had it been implemented as written. During the hearing, before issuing a final order, testimony was heard from El Dorado County, the Eldorado National Forest, and the Rubicon Trail Foundation. The result of that hearing was a more manageable order requiring El Dorado County and the Eldorado National Forest to repair the trail, build bridges, obtain an accurate user count, conduct education and planning efforts, report regularly to the board, and provide more law enforcement on the trail. The Cleanup and Abatement Order was rescinded on October 14, 2014, noting the efforts by government agencies and trail users to redress water quality concerns.http://www.edcgov.us/Government/Parks/CAO_Rescission_10-10-14.aspx The Rubicon Trail Foundation, Friends of the Rubicon, El Dorado County, and the Eldorado National Forest continue their efforts to keep this \\"crown jewel\\" of OHV routes open.  Usage  Part of the trail is used as a testing ground by Jeep and many aftermarket Jeep product companies local to Northern California including (Metalcloak) (RuffStuff Specialties), (SPIDERWEBSHADE), and quite frequently, (GenRight). The Rubicon variants of the Jeep Wrangler and Jeep Gladiator are named after this trail. Many large events take place on the trail, ranging from Jeep-only events (Jeep Jamboree) and 4x4 enthusiast events (Jeepers Jamboree, TLCA's Rubithon, Marlin Crawler Round-Up, Cantina on the Con) to family trips to special events organized just for SUVs and stock 4x4s that could not otherwise complete the trail. As of April 2016, the TV show Top Gear USA on History Google Imaged the entire Rubicon Trail with the NCTech iSTAR 360 degree camera as part of their show. A few hundred of the 6000 images can be found on Google Maps provided by NCTech.http://www.nctechimaging.com https://jeepequipment.com/how-to-install- a-winch-on-a-jeep/  Gallery  File:El Dorado National Forest as viewed from Rubicon Trail.jpgView of surrounding forest from the top of \\"Cadillac Hill\\".

The firm was ranked among the 100 largest firms by revenue in the United States and was one of the 100 most prestigious firms according to Vault's surveys of the legal industry. The firm's largest practices included defense of pharmaceutical and medical device manufacturers in product liability litigation and related matters, patent enforcement and prosecution, corporate transactions, and commercial litigation. On January 9, 2020, Pepper Hamilton announced its planned merger with Atlanta-based firm Troutman Sanders to form Troutman Pepper Hamilton Sanders. The combined firm has 1,100 attorneys, making it the largest purely American law firm and one of the 50 largest law firms in the world. The merger completed on July 1, 2020. History George W. Pepper, founder The firm was founded in 1890 in Philadelphia by George Wharton Pepper, who joined the practice of Bayard Henry. Pepper emerged as a leading lawyer in Philadelphia and the nation, and was prominent in Republican politics. Pepper's essays on conflicts of laws were cited by Justice Brandeis in the landmark ruling Erie Railroad v. Tompkins (1938).Vault.com Pepper was also instrumental in Supreme Court arguments that lead to many New Deal provisions being struck down as beyond the Federal Government's commerce power. In 1954, the Pepper firm and another Philadelphia law firm ‚Äî Evans, Bayard & Frick ‚Äî merged as Pepper, Bodine, Frick, Scheetz & Hamilton creating a 35-lawyer entity. This merger brought in John Johnson, an eminent antitrust lawyer who represented Standard Oil and U.S. Steel and went on the argue 168 cases before the U.S. Supreme Court. In 1955, shortly after the merger of the Pepper and Evans firms, George Wharton Pepper retired from practice because of failing health. He was succeeded as chairman of the firm by John D.M. Hamilton, who was chairman of the Republican National Committee in 1940. In 1960, another merger brought in the firm of Moffett, Frye & Leopold. The firm grew significantly in the 1980s, 1990s and in recent years. In 2007, the partnership elected Nina M. Gussack as chairwoman of Pepper's Executive Committee, the first woman to be elected to that position.Mondics, Chris.

It appears to the spectator that anyone lying on this \\"bed\\" would be injured by the nails, but this is not so. Assuming the nails are numerous enough, the weight is distributed among them so that the pressure exerted by each nail is not enough to puncture the person's skin. Uses One use of such a device is for magic tricks or physics demonstrations. A famous example requires a volunteer to lie on a bed of several thousand nails, with a board on top of him. Cinder blocks are placed on the board and then smashed with a sledgehammer. Despite the seemingly unavoidable force, the volunteer is not harmed: the force from the blow is spread among the thousands of nails, resulting in reduced pressure; the breaking of the blocks also dissipates much of the energy from the hammer. This demonstration of the principles of weight distribution requires that the weight of the volunteer be spread over as many nails as possible. The most dangerous part is the moment of lying down or getting up, when one's weight may briefly be supported on only a few nails. Some \\"beds\\" have rails mounted at the sides to help users lie down and get up safely. The bed of nails is used by some for meditation, particularly in Asia, and for certain alleged health benefits, such as back pain relief, see acupressure mat. Less traditional settings, such as science centers, may use an electronic retractable bed of nails, where the user lies on a flat plastic bed with holes in it, and can then activate the machine to have nails rise up all at once. The nails should retract before getting off the bed. This retraction eliminates the most dangerous part of a traditional bed of nails, getting on and off the bed. Guinness World Records 'Most motorcycles driven over the body while lying on a bed of nails' was achieved by Burnaby Q. Orbax of the Monsters of Schlock on 26 October 2015 when he had 70 motorbikes driven over him in two minutes while lying on a bed of nails. 'Heaviest concrete block break on a bed of nails' was achieved by Neal Hardy (Australia) on 12 February 2012 when he had 15 blocks weighing 774.99 kg (1708 lb 8 oz) placed on his chest and broken. 'The most melons chopped in half on somebody‚Äôs stomach (with a samurai sword while they lay on a bed of nails)' was achieved by Johnny Strange (UK) on 13 October 2013 when he chopped 10 watermelons in half on the stomach of his assistant in 30 seconds.

It included concepts and philosophies such as just in time, kaizen and total quality management. Managerial style The Japanese term \\"hourensou\\" (also rendered as \\"Ho-Ren-So\\") refers to frequent reporting, touching base and discussing ‚Äì important attributes that are said to characterize collaboration and information flow within effective Japanese corporate culture. Hou' stands for 'Houkoku', the Japanese word for 'reporting'. 'Ren' comes from 'Renraku', the word for 'informing'. 'Sou' is derived from 'Soudan', the word for 'consulting'. refers to \\"getting your hands dirty\\", to identify or solve immediate problems and leaders are not exempt from this. Aspects of these principles are often mistaken by western managers as \\"micromanagement\\". In contrast, these principles are used as tools to shepherd processes. Mohammed Ala and William Cordeiro (1999) described the Japanese decision-making process of \\"ringiseido\\". \\"Ringiseido\\" provides the opportunity for equal ranking managers or employees of a group within a company to partake in an individual's idea. The process adheres to the Japanese cultural desire of harmony among people. The physical action of \\"ringiseido\\" is referred to as the \\"ringi decision-making process.\\" It fosters an environment of support and agreement for a decision once a higher ranking manager has reviewed and accepted the recommended decision.Ala, Mohammad; Cordeiro, William P., Can We Learn Management Techniques From the Japanese Ringi Process? Business Forum January 1, 1999 The term of \\"ringi\\" has two meanings. The first meaning being of \\"rin\\", 'submitting a proposal to one's supervisors and receiving their approval,' and \\"gi\\" meaning 'deliberations and decisions.' Corporate policy is not clearly defined by the executive leadership of a Japanese company. Rather, the managers at all levels below executives must raise decisions to the next level except for routine decisions. The process of \\"ringi decision-making\\" is conducted through a document called a \\"ringisho\\".Ala, Mohammad; Cordeiro, William P., Can We Learn Management Techniques From the Japanese Ringi Process? Business Forum January 1, 1999 (p. 22‚Äì23). The \\"ringisho\\" is created and circulated by the individual who created the idea. As the \\"ringisho\\" reaches a peer for review, the peer places his or her \\"personal seal (hanko) right side up\\" to agree, \\"upside down\\" to disagree, and sideways to indicate being undecided. Once all peers have reviewed the \\"ringisho\\" the peers' manager reviews the \\"ringisho\\" and places his or her hanko on it. The upper level manager's decision is final and the \\"ringisho\\" is sent back to the originator who either initiates the idea or re-evaluates, based on the \\"hanko\\" of the upper level manager.  Leadership values  Tony Kippenberger (2002) elaborates on the leadership values that are deeply rooted in the Japanese business culture. These values were created by Konosuke Matsushita, the prominent deceased entrepreneur of Matsushita's Electric Company, who cared deeply for the employees of his company as if they were family. Matsushita firmly believed that a business as large as his was responsible to help all of society prosper, and not simply for those that owned and ran the company to prosper. In 1933 Matsushita, during the great depression, created seven \\"guiding principles\\":*Kippenberger, T. (2002). Leadership styles . Oxford, United Kingdom: Capstone Publishing. *Service to the public ‚Äì by providing high-quality goods and services at reasonable prices, we contribute to the public's well-being; *Fairness and honesty ‚Äì we will be fair and honest in all our business dealings and personal conduct; *Teamwork for the common cause ‚Äì we will pool abilities, based on mutual trust and respect; *Uniting effort for improvement ‚Äì we will constantly strive to improve our corporate and personal performances; *Courtesy and humility ‚Äì we will always be cordial and modest and respect the rights and needs of others; *Accordance with natural laws ‚Äì we will abide by the laws of nature and adjust to the ever-changing conditions around us; and *Gratitude for blessings ‚Äì we will always be grateful for all the blessings and kindness we have received.\\" The \\"guiding principles\\" were \\"remarkable for their time\\". The seven principles are used by Matsushita's company today and serve as principles for other Japanese companies. Because the \\"guiding principles\\" are such powerful statements and an extension of the Japanese cultural into business, the principles have been renamed the \\"Seven Spirits of Matsushita\\" to honor Matsushita.*Kippenberger, T. (2002). Leadership styles . Oxford, United Kingdom: Capstone Publishing. p.71-72 Smaller companies In smaller companies, an entirely different corporate culture developed. Similar to the Meister system of Germany, new recruits are placed under skilled senior specialists and spend years learning every technique that they have. They are trained to develop deeper understanding of specific areas of skills instead of the broader and less deep training that those in a larger corporation receive. They learn to produce work of high quality using few simple tools and few or no advanced industrial tools. Japanese women in management As the modern cultures of the world continue to evolve, cultural concepts either lose presence or evolve with the modern concepts. Japan is experiencing such an evolution in regard to women in the workplace and in management roles. While a main reason for this evolution is the adoption of western influence on Japanese society, Japan is being forced to support this evolution because it is grappling with a declining population and lower birth rate which will lead to a smaller workforce. According to \\"Cloud, or Silver Linings?\\" published in the Economist (2007), it was reported that in 2006 Japan's birth rate was 1.32 and has been below 2.1 since the 1970s. A birthrate of 2.1 is necessary to successfully maintain current population numbers. The article described that the OECD has proven there is a \\"positive correlation between fertility and female employment.\\" Thus, if an effort is made to support females work ambitions and family desires, then women will be more willing and likely to want to have children and families and not have to sacrifice their career in the process. Japanese officials are not taking this information lightly. During his last year in office, Prime Minister Junichiro Koizumi (2002‚Äì2007) began legislation to foster \\"financial support for families with young children and an expansion of child-care facilities (p. 27).Cloud or silver linings?

It was chartered in Tennessee in 1852, and opened in 1859. The MC&L; entered receivership after the American Civil War, and financial troubles led to an 11-day strike in 1868 that ended when Louisville and Nashville Railroad (L&N;) leased the line. L&N; finally purchased the MC&L; in 1871 and operated it as its Memphis Branch. L&N; was merged into CSX, and CSX sold the former MC&L; line to R.J. Corman Railroad Group in 1987, becoming that company's Memphis Line.  History  The company received its original charter on January 28, 1852, and amended its charter in 1854 to merge with the Nashville and Memphis Railroad and to build a line from Memphis through Clarksville to the state border in the direction of Bowling Green, Kentucky. Construction began in Fall 1854. In 1855 the charter was amended to allow it to build into Kentucky to a point on the Tennessee River to connect with the Memphis and Ohio Railroad. After construction had begun, William Andrew Quarles was appointed president, succeeding William B. Munford. The first train operated between Clarksville and Guthrie, Kentucky, on October 1, 1859, becoming the first railroad to operate in Clarksville. The line's extension to Bowling Green was completed on September 16, 1860, with the first regular train operating through to Bowling Green on September 24. A ceremonial first train was operated on September 18, including a symbolic handshake between William Quarles and James Guthrie of the L&N; at the Kentucky/Tennessee state line. The line of gauge track connected with the Memphis and Ohio Railroad and the Louisville and Nashville Railroad (L&N;) between Memphis and Louisville. In Louisville, the railroad used the L&N; Depot as the terminal for its passenger trains, and provided connections through to New Orleans via Humboldt, Tennessee.

Heavy rain again caused disruption in December 1866 through a landslide near Clarksville. In 1868 the railroad was bankrupt and could not pay its wages; this led to an 11-day strike in February, during which time through trains from Memphis to Louisville were routed on competing lines via Nashville and McKenzie. The strike ended when the L&N; leased the line on February 17. The railroad was dissolved on September 30, 1871, then purchased by the L&N.; Although the L&N;'s purchase was effective as of October 1, 1871, the company's accounting was kept separate until October 1872. L&N; operated the line as its Memphis Branch, but saw declining traffic through the early 20th century, with the last passenger train serving Clarksville in February 1968.

She became the first woman to climb Denali (Mount McKinley) on June 6, 1947. She was the wife and climbing partner of mountaineer and scientist Bradford Washburn. Early life Barbara Washburn, n√©e Polk, grew up in the Boston-area suburb of West Roxbury, Massachusetts. She attended the Boston Girls Latin School and graduated from Smith College. As a young woman, she took courses at Harvard University and worked as a secretary for Bradford Washburn, then the director of the New England Museum of Natural History (now the Boston Museum of Science). When the Washburns announced their engagement, Barbara Washburn resigned from her job at the museum. They married on April 27, 1940, honeymooned in New Hampshire, then spent the summer on an Alaskan expedition. Mountaineering and first ascents = Mount Bertha = Shortly after marrying Bradford Washburn, Barbara Washburn was asked to accompany her husband and a team of six others on an expedition to attempt the first ascent of remote 10,182 ft Mount Bertha, a mountain in the Fairweather range of Alaska, during the early summer of 1940. As the expedition's leader, Bradford Washburn envisioned a relatively casual affair. Besides Barbara Washburn, who had no mountaineering experience, a 16-year-old Lowell Thomas Jr. came along at the request of his father, Lowell Thomas. According to Bradford Washburn's later recounting, \\"His father figured that if Barbara was going it must be easy\\". Washburn wrote that prior to her marriage, \\"I had no mountaineering background.\\" Once in Alaska, the team ferried heavy loads up through a series of camps along the flanks of the mountain. She recalled of that time, \\"I had no real feeling about being a pioneering woman on a serious Alaskan expedition. I only knew that as the only woman, I had to measure up.‚Äô‚Äô On the first attempt at the summit, the team climbed too slowly and had to turn back 1700ft from the top. On the way down, Bradford Washburn decided that they should rappel down an open crevasse to save time. According to Washburn, she learned to rappel on the fly with only brief instructions: \\"Now tie the rope around your waist....you just swing across this ice slope, and this is called rappelling.\\" For the second summit attempt, three team members, Lowell Thomas Jr., Alva Morrison and Lee Wilson, decided to remain in camp. The remaining five, Barbara and Bradford Washburn, with Maynard Miller, Michl Feuersinger and Thomas Winship, achieved the summit on July 30, 1940. In August, as they returned to Juneau, Alaska, Washburn felt that she was not recovering from the ordeal as quickly as the others and sought the advice of a doctor, only to learn that she was several months pregnant. = Mount Hayes = In 1941, fearing that war time activities would preclude further expedition opportunities, Bradford Washburn pushed for the couple to take on a new challenge. Mount Hayes, a 13,832 ft peak in the Hayes Range of Alaska, had been subject to two previous attempts at the summit, one reaching 11,000 ft, but had not yet had a first ascent. Bradford Washburn later recalled it being one of the few expeditions the couple did with no additional angle, such as map-making or scientific discovery, but simply for the fun of it, in fear that the war would irrevocably alter their circumstances and prevent any future adventures. With a three-month-old baby, Washburn was initially reluctant to go on the trip, but was eventually persuaded. Bradford Washburn's parents would care for the infant Dorothy \\"Dottie\\" Washburn in their absence. The Washburns assembled an experienced team, including Ben Ferris, Sterling Hendricks, Bill Shand, Robin Montgomery and Henry Hall. The remote location of Mount Hayes required a complex plan of approach. The group was able to fly supplies into an impromptu landing spot approximately 19 miles northeast of Mount Hayes, with the help of bush pilot Johnny Lynn. Further supplies were air dropped at various points closer to the mountain, and the whole team met up near the start of the Hayes glacier at 4,600 ft on July 17, 1941. Further supplies were parachuted to the climbers and they established a base camp at 4,900 ft with enough supplies to last 30 days. Between July 21 and 24, the team ferried loads up the shoulder of the mountain to 8,300 ft, with some delays for poor weather. Robin Montgomery departed from the expedition, as planned, to rendezvous with a bush plane on August 1, leaving five remaining. Perched in a notch above 9000 ft, the climbers set up a forward camp. On July 29, 1941, they made a reconnaissance mission towards the summit, intending to perhaps complete the entire climb. The crux appeared as a \\"knife-like crest,\\" according to Bradford Washburn, \\"a tenuous arete of snow and ice, thin as paper, wound into another cleft 300 yards away.\\" With poor weather setting in, the climbers decided not to attempt the final sections. On August 1, the team planned a second attempt. Henry Hall, though an experienced climber, at 46 years old, was older than the rest of the team. Worn out from the first attempt, he decided to remain in camp for the second attempt. More stable weather conditions, and fixed ropes and ice steps cut during the previous climb quickened their way to the final stretches. At the crux, Washburn was chosen to lead the knife-like ridge, with the rationale that as the lightest climber, she would be easiest for the others to pull back up if the ridge should give way. A climber from a later expedition to Mt. Hayes would describe this section as \\"so narrow and the snow so soft that you could not put your feet side by side.\\" Bradford Washburn's biographer, David Roberts, questioned the rationale for Washburn's lead, writing that \\"the crux pitches on a mountain such as Hayes should have been led by the best climber, which in this case was Brad. He weighed only about thirty pounds more than his wife. [...] Had Barbara slipped off the ridge, or broken loose a cornice or even a chunk of the ridge, she would have taken a long, horrific pendulum fall down the sheer precipice on either the east or the west side. Even held on belay, she might have seriously injured herself, and it would have been no easy matter to get her back up to the ridge.\\" In Washburn's obituary, the American Alpine Journal singled out this section of the climb as her greatest feat of mountaineering, noting that \\"what was probably the hardest bit of technical climbing Brad ever performed in his long Alaskan career was a ridge traverse led by his wife.\\" The ridge did not give way, and the climbers reached the summit that afternoon. = Denali = Barbara Washburn was asked to return to Alaska to participate in Operation White Tower, an attempt at climbing Denali (then Mount McKinley) in 1947. The expedition was funded by RKO Pictures, who planned to use publicity from the climb to attract public interest towards an upcoming film, set in the Alps, The White Tower. Originally, studio executives wanted to support a trip to Mount Everest, but were convinced by Bradford Washburn that this was geopolitically unfeasible in the immediate aftermath of World War II. Now a mother of three, Washburn was initially hesitant to join the climb, but eventually agreed after consulting the family physician, who assured her a lengthy absence would not harm the children. The first ascent of the south (higher) peak occurred in 1913. Denali is approximately 130 miles South-Southwest of Fairbanks, Alaska, 20,310 ft in height, with the upper reaches permanently swathed in snow and glaciers. Operation White Tower drew together complex interests. The New England Museum supported scientific, surveying and photographic endeavors during the climb. The U.S. Air Force, interested in cosmic ray research and high altitude camping, helped with logistics, while the Alaska Communications System set up the team with radio support. The National Park Service allowed the use of a ranger station, while Chief Ranger Grant Pearson accompanied the expedition. Four representatives from RKO also took part in the expedition to capture photography, film and written accounts of the climb. In the end, 17 people would take part in the actual expedition: Carl Anderson, George Brown, Hakon Christensen, Robert Craig, William Deeke, Sgt. James Gale, William Hackett, Robert Lange, Earl Norris, Grant Pearson, Leonard Shannon, Harvey Solberg, William Sterling, H.T. Victoreen, Bradford Washburn, Barbara Washburn and George Wellstead. Washburn was the only woman on the climb. Washburn, Hackett and Lange were the first to reach the summit, on June 6, 1947, followed by Deeke, Craig, Gale, Browne and Bradford Washburn. As the only woman on the expedition, Washburn became the first woman to climb Denali.  Cartography and other work  The Washburns often worked in tandem, in areas of mountaineering, exploring, mapping, and museum administration. She did not realize that she had been the first woman to climb Denali until after their ascent.The Accidental Adventurer: Memoir of the First Woman to Climb Mt. McKinley by Barbara Washburn, Lew Freedman and Bradford Washburn, Epicenter Press, May 2001. She typically accompanied her husband on his expeditions, and contributed to his work at the Boston Museum of Science. With her husband, she completed a large-scale map of the Grand Canyon, published as a National Geographic magazine supplement in July 1978. For that achievement and others, the Washburns received in 1980 the Alexander Graham Bell Medal from the National Geographic Society. \\"Bradford and Barbara Washburn ... received it in 1980 for their contributions to geography and cartography\\". In 1981, the Washburns produced the most detailed and accurate map ever made of Mount Everest. Washburn's memoir is The Accidental Adventurer: Memoir of the First Woman to Climb Mt. McKinley by Barbara Washburn, Lew Freedman, and Bradford Washburn, Epicenter Press, May 2001.  Personal life  Barbara and Bradford Washburn raised three children, Dorothy, Edward and Elizabeth.

It is mentioned several times in the Hebrew Bible. The word Dedan ( D…ô·∏èƒÅn; Dudan, Dadan, Daedan in Brenton's Septuagint Translation Brenton's Septuagint Translation: Isaiah 21) means \\"low ground\\". The people of Dedan are called Dedanim (in Hebrew) or Dedanites.  Men named Dedan In the Hebrew Bible, the name Dedan is assigned to two different men: * A son of Raamah (Genesis 10:7). His descendants are mentioned in Isaiah 21:13, Ezekiel 25:13 and Ezekiel 27:15. They probably settled among the sons of Cush, on the north-west coast of the present Persian Gulf. * A son of Jokshan, son of Abraham and his concubine Keturah (Genesis 25:3, 1 Chronicles 1:32). His descendants settled on the Syrian borders about the territory of Edom. They probably led a pastoral life. The name Dedan comes possibly from the Hebrew noun (dd), meaning breast or nipple, or the Hebrew verb (dada), meaning move slowly, lead slowly (Psalm 42:5, Isaiah 38:15).Abarim Publications, The name Dedan in the Bible, accessed 7 April 2018 It may be connected with (dwd) the root for beloved (aunt, uncle, even the name David).  History  Dedan is mentioned in the Book of Ezekiel, (Chapters 27 and 38). Chapter 27 is a roster of the trading partners of the city of Tyre (today in modern Lebanon), where Dedan is noted as a nation or kingdom which traded in saddle blankets (Ezekiel 27:20). The oasis kingdom is also mentioned in the prophetic vision of the war of Gog and Magog (Ezekiel 38; see also, Revelation 20:8), and appears to be a nation of significance in this end-times prophecy of Ezekiel. Isaiah 21:13 and Ezekiel 27:15 identify the Dedanim or Dedanites as a trading people.Cambridge Bible for Schools and Colleges on Isaiah 21, accessed 7 April 2018 In Ezekiel 38:13, Dedan is joined with Sheba and \\"Tarshish and all her strong lions\\": all these nations joining together to inquire of the advancing armies of Gog: \\"Have you come to plunder? Have you gathered your hordes to loot, to carry off silver and gold, to take away livestock and goods and to seize much plunder?\\" Now known as Al Ula in northern Saudi Arabia, known to the ancient Greeks and Romans as Hijra, Hegra or Egra, the former is about the same distance, about 250 miles north from Medina as Medina is north of Mecca.

Shinel; sometimes translated as \\"The Cloak\\") is a short story by Ukrainian-born Russian author Nikolai Gogol, published in 1842. The story and its author have had great influence on Russian literature, as expressed in a quote about Russian realist writers from Eug√®ne-Melchior de Vog√º√© (often misattributed to Fyodor Dostoyevsky): \\"We all come out from Gogol's 'Overcoat'.\\" Writing in 1941, Vladimir Nabokov called it \\"The greatest Russian short story ever written\\". The story has been adapted into a variety of stage and film interpretations.  Summary  A stamp depicting \\"The Overcoat\\", from the souvenir sheet of Russia devoted to the 200th birth anniversary of Nikolai Gogol, 2009 The story narrates the life and death of titular councillor Akaky Akakievich Bashmachkin (Russian: –ê–∫–∞–∫–∏–π –ê–∫–∞–∫–∏–µ–≤–∏—á –ë–∞—à–º–∞—á–∫–∏–Ω), an impoverished government clerk and copyist in the Russian capital of St. Petersburg. Although Akaky is dedicated to his job, he is little recognized in his department for his hard work. Instead, the younger clerks tease him and attempt to distract him whenever they can. His threadbare overcoat is often the butt of their jokes. Akaky decides it is necessary to have the coat repaired, so he takes it to his tailor, Petrovich, who declares the coat irreparable, telling Akaky he must buy a new overcoat. The cost of a new overcoat is beyond Akaky's meager salary, so he forces himself to live within a strict budget to save sufficient money to buy the new overcoat. Meanwhile, he and Petrovich frequently meet to discuss the style of the new coat. During that time, Akaky's zeal for copying is replaced with excitement about his new overcoat, to the point that he thinks of little else. Finally, with the addition of an unexpectedly large holiday salary bonus, Akaky has saved enough money to buy a new overcoat. Akaky and Petrovich go to the shops in St. Petersburg and pick the finest materials they can afford (marten fur was too expensive, so they use cat fur for the collar). The new coat is of impressively good quality and appearance and is the talk of Akaky's office on the day he arrives wearing it. His superior decides to host a party honoring the new overcoat, at which the habitually solitary Akaky is out of place; after the party, Akaky goes home, far later than he normally would. En route home, two ruffians confront him, take his coat, kick him down, and leave him in the snow. Akaky finds no help from the authorities in recovering his lost overcoat. Finally, on the advice of another clerk in his department, he asks for help from an \\"important personage\\" (Russian: –∑–Ω–∞—á–∏—Ç–µ–ª—å–Ω–æ–µ –ª–∏—Ü–æ), a general recently promoted to his position who belittles and shouts at his subordinates to solidify his self- importance. After keeping Akaky waiting, the general demands of him exactly why he has brought so trivial a matter to him, personally, and not presented it to his secretary. Socially inept Akaky makes an unflattering remark concerning departmental secretaries, provoking so powerful a scolding from the general that he nearly faints and must be led from the general's office. Soon afterward, Akaky falls deathly ill with fever. In his last hours, he is delirious, imagining himself again sitting before the general; at first, Akaky pleads forgiveness, but as his death nears, he curses the general. Soon, a corpse, identified as Akaky's ghost, haunts areas of St. Petersburg, taking overcoats from people; the police are finding it difficult to capture him. Finally, Akaky's ghost catches up with the general‚Äîwho, since Akaky's death, had begun to feel guilt over having mistreated him‚Äîand takes his overcoat, frightening him terribly; satisfied, Akaky is not seen again. The narrator ends his narration with the account of another ghost seen in another part of the city. Characters Akaky Akakievitch Bashmachkin: Bureaucrat in one of the departments of the Russian government in St. Petersburg, the nation's capital city. Bashmachkin, about fifty, is a quiet, self-effacing man with red hair and a receding hairline. His job is to copy documents such as letters. Although he enjoys his work and never makes a mistake, he has no desire to take on more challenging work, realizing that he has limited capabilities. Because he is meek and dresses shabbily, most of his coworkers regard him as a nobody and frequently pick on him. When his cloak becomes so frayed that it can no longer protect him against the bitter cold, he dedicates himself to saving enough money to purchase a new cloak. Petrovich: One-eyed, heavy- drinking, decent, tailor whom Bashmachkin hires to make his new cloak. Petrovitch was once a serf. Wife of Petrovich: Woman of plain looks whom the narrator says Petrovitch calls \\"a low female and a German\\" when they argue. Bearded Assailants: Men who rob Akaky of his new cloak. Landlady of Bashmachkin: Elderly woman who advises Akaky to report the theft of his cloak to the district police chief. District Police Chief: Official who hears Akaky's report about his stolen cloak. The policeman asks Akaky embarrassing questions, as if he were a criminal. The policeman is of no help. Employee With Advice: Coworker of Akaky who advises him to see a certain prominent personage in a government office who will help Akaky track down his stolen cloak. Prominent Personage: Bureaucrat mainly concerned with demonstrating the power he wields as a supervisor. He excoriates Akaky for not going through the proper government channels to get an interview. He is of no help. Physician: Doctor called after Akaky develops a throat infection. He tells Akaky's landlady to order a coffin. Interpretations Gogol makes much of Akaky's name in the opening passages, saying, \\"Perhaps it may strike the reader as a rather strange and farfetched name, but I can assure him that it was not farfetched at all, that the circumstances were such that it was quite out of the question to give him any other name...\\" The name Akaky Akakievich Bashmachkin in Russian means \\"Akaky Bashmachkin, the son of Akaky Bashmachkin\\", similarly to \\"John Johnson\\", and has similar comedic value; it also communicates Akaky's role as an everyman. In addition, the literal meaning of the name, derived from the Greek, is \\"harmless\\" or \\"lacking evil\\", showing the humiliation it must have taken to drive his ghost to violence. His surname Bashmachkin, meanwhile, comes from the word 'bashmak', a type of shoe. It is used in an expression \\"–±—ã—Ç—å –ø–æ–¥ –±–∞—à–º–∞–∫–æ–º\\" which means to be \\"under someone's thumb\\" or to \\"be henpecked\\".http://dic.academic.ru/dic.nsf/eng_rus/29246/–±—ã—Ç—å Akaky progresses from an introverted and hopeless but functioning non-entity with no expectations of social or material success to one whose self-esteem and thereby expectations are raised by the overcoat. Akaky is not merely introverted, but described as humorously fit for his position as a non-entity. He is not oppressed by the nature of bureaucratic work because he enjoys performing bureaucratic tasks. Akaky ‚Äúlabored with love‚Äù and longed for nothing but copying. He found it ‚Äúa varied and agreeable employment. Enjoyment was written on his face.‚ÄùNikolai Gogol, ‚ÄúThe Overcoat‚Äù (Coradella Collegiate Bookshelf Editions, 2004) 5. A good contrast would be Melville's Bartleby, the Scrivener. Bartleby is quite adept at his job as a copyist, but arrives ‚Äúincurably forlorn‚Äù when he is first employed.Herman Melville, ‚ÄúBartleby the Scrivener,‚Äù Billy Budd and Other Stories (New York: Penguin Books, 1986) 11. Bartleby begins rejecting his work saying ‚ÄúI would prefer not to,‚Äù gradually rejecting more and more, until he finally dies staring at a wall having rejected life itself. Bartleby's antisocial, otherworldly and melancholy features make him uncanny and he has been interpreted as a provocateur of existential crisis.For an existential reading of Bartleby see Olga Todoric, \\"Bartleby, the Absurd Hero\\" Moderna Spr√•k 94.1 (2000) 15‚Äì18. Akaky, on the other hand, is presented in a humorous way initially. This is partly because he represents a ‚Äútype‚Äù presented in anecdotal form by Gogol.See Vissarion Belinsky‚Äôs theory of literary types in ‚ÄúThe Russian Story and Mr. Gogol‚Äôs Stories‚Äù (1835). He enjoys copying because he lacks an inner life. Gogol makes light of his fitness for mundane bureaucratic activities by joking that Akaky was always ‚Äúto be seen in the same place, the same attitude, the same occupation; so that it was afterwards affirmed that he had been born in undress uniform with a bald head.‚Äù When Akaky is asked to make a minor change in a document instead of merely copying it, he cannot do it.Gogol 3‚Äì6 Critics have noted the famous ‚Äúhumane passage‚Äù which demonstrates a sudden shift in the narration's style from comic to tragic.Boris Eichenbaum, Beth Paul and Muriel Nesbitt, ‚ÄúThe Structure of Gogol‚Äôs ‚ÄòThe Overcoat,‚Äô‚Äù The Russian Review 22.4 (1963): 13. Though Akaky is not oppressed by his task, he is by his coworkers who treat him ‚Äúin a coolly despotic way‚Äù and ‚Äúlaughed at and made fun of him‚Äù to which Akaky usually ‚Äúanswered not a word‚Äù until finally he is provoked to exclaim ‚ÄúLeave me alone! Why do you insult me?‚Äù in a way ‚Äúwhich moved to pity‚Äù so that a new worker suddenly ‚Äústopped short‚Äù as if he had ‚Äúundergone a transformation‚Äù. This young man never forgot Akaky and his ‚Äúheart-rending words‚Äù which carried the unspoken message ‚ÄúI am thy brother.‚Äù Remembering Akaky he ‚Äúshuddered at how much inhumanity there is in man.‚ÄùGogol 3‚Äì5 Indeed, the coworker's comments underscore one possible interpretation of the story: > \\"How little humane feeling after all was to be found in men's hearts; how > much coarseness and cruelty was to be found even in the educated and those > who were everywhere regarded as good and honorable men.\\" The narrator's portrayal of Akaky jars the reader, like the young man himself, from carefree mockery to graven sympathy. Gogol is noted for his instability of style, tone, genre among other literary devices, as Boris Eichenbaum notes. Eichenbaum also notes that Gogol wrote ‚ÄúThe Overcoat‚Äù in a skaz‚Äîa difficult to translate colloquial language in Russian deriving from or associated with an oral storytelling tradition. Co-workers start noticing him and complimenting him on his coat and he ventures out into the social world. His hopes are quickly dashed by the theft of the coat. He attempts to enlist the police in recovery of the coat and employs some inept rank jumping by going to a very important and high ranking individual but his lack of status (perhaps lack of the coat) is obvious and he is treated with disdain. He is plunged into illness (fever) and cannot function. He dies quickly and without putting up much of a fight. The Overcoat is a philosophical tale in the tradition of a stoic philosopher or Schopenhauer. Akaky's overcoat allows him to become human instead of a merely bureaucratic tool. A Marxist reading of the text would interpret Akaky's material desire as granting him humanity. The story does not condemn private acquisition and materialism, but asserts that human beings can have fulfillment from attention to material goods. Material goods, in particular clothing, do not merely mask real human character, but can modify a person's identity in a positive and liberating way. Akaky's social alienation and belittlement give way to community inclusion and genuine respect. People are brought together by material goods. It is also possible to read the text from a psychoanalytic perspective.See Daniel Rancour-Laferriere, Out from Under Gogol's Overcoat: A Psychoanalytic Study, (Anne Arbor: Ardis 1982) 251. Akaky's libido is repressed and sublimated into the task of copying. After he acquires the coat, he expresses sexual interest. Akaky ‚Äúeven started to run, without knowing why, after some lady.‚ÄùGogol 27 He also ‚Äúhalted out of curiosity before a shop window to look at a picture representing a handsome woman‚Ä¶baring her whole foot in a very pretty way.‚ÄùGogol 25 He laughs and doesn't know why because he experiences previously unknown feelings. Akaky also treats the coat with the tenderness and obsession of a lover. When the construction of the coat is first commissioned Akaky feels that his existence became ‚Äúfuller, as if he were married.‚ÄùGogol 19 Akaky's low position in the bureaucratic hierarchy is evident, and the extent to which he looks up the hierarchical ladder is well documented; sometimes forgotten, according to Harold McFarlin, is that he is not the lowest-ranked in the hierarchy and thus in society. He has mastered the bureaucratic language (\\"bureaucratese\\") and has internalized it to the extent that he describes and treats the non-civil servants (\\"only two 'civilians,' the landlady and tailor, play more than incidental roles\\") as if they are part of the same world‚Äîthe tailor is described as sitting \\"like a Turkish Pasha\\", that is, a government official, and Akaky \\"treats the self-effacing old landlady just like his bosses treat him at the office ('somehow coldly and despotically')\\". Critical assessment Vladimir Nabokov, writing in his Lectures on Russian Literature, gave the following appraisal of Gogol and his most famous story: \\"Steady Pushkin, matter-of-fact Tolstoy, restrained Chekhov have all had their moments of irrational insight which simultaneously blurred the sentence and disclosed a secret meaning worth the sudden focal shift. But with Gogol this shifting is the very basis of his art, so that whenever he tried to write in the round hand of literary tradition and to treat rational ideas in a logical way, he lost all trace of talent. When, as in the immortal The Overcoat, he really let himself go and pottered on the brink of his private abyss, he became the greatest artist that Russia has yet produced.\\" Adaptations =Films= A number of films have used the story, both in the Soviet Union and in other countries: *The Overcoat (1916) - an American silent film directed by Rae Berger *The Overcoat (1926) - a Soviet silent film directed by Grigori Kozintsev and Leonid Trauberg *The Overcoat (1951 film) - a film of Marcel Marceau's Mime Play with W.

Here the story is transposed to the East End of London and the protagonists are poor Jews working in the clothing trade. *The Overcoat (1959) - a Soviet film directed by Aleksey Batalov *\\"Nayi Sherwani\\" (1986), an adaptation for the Indian DD National television series Katha Sagar by Shyam Benegal *The Overcoat (1997) - a Greek film *The Overcoat (2001) - a Canadian made-for-TV film produced by the CBC *The Overcoat - an unfinished animated film by Yuriy Norshteyn, in the works since the early 1980s. *The Overcoat (2017) - a short film adapted and directed by Patrick Myles starring Jason Watkins, Tim Key, Vicki Pepperdine and Alex Macqueen. *The Overcoat (2018) - an animated special adapted by Hugh O'Conor and directed by Sean Mullen & Meelis Arulepp, starring Cillian Murphy and Alfred Molina. =Radio= *Gogol's story was adapted twice on the radio series Theatre Royal, first on October 11, 1953 and then on August 4, 1954, both versions starring Sir Michael Redgrave as Akaky. *Hans Conreid starred as Akaky in an adaptation on The CBS Radio Mystery Theater on March 3, 1977. *On April 3, 2002, the BBC Radio 4 series Three Ivans, Two Aunts and an Overcoat broadcast an adaptation by Jim Poyser of the story starring Stephen Moore as Akaky. In this version, the Very Important Person whose overcoat Akaky's ghost takes is Akaky's immediate superior Colonel Borzov, and the ending is altered to have Akaky's ghost visit him in his office (rather than on his way home in his sleigh, as in the story) to take both the overcoat and Borzov's Very Important Person medal (and a bag of sugared rusks). =Ballet= *The Russian composer German Okunev was working on a ballet version of 'The Overcoat' at the time of his death in 1973: it was completed and orchestrated by V.

A film version was produced by the CBC. *The Danish choreographer Flemming Flindt created a version for Dennis Nahat and the Clevelend-San Jose Ballet. The principal role was performed by Rudolph Nureyev at the world premiere at the Edinburgh Festival in the summer of 1990. =Play= *Marcel Marceau adapted \\"The Overcoat\\" as a Mime Play in 1951. He revived his play in 1954 and 1959. His last version of \\"The Overcoat\\" toured the United States in 1960. *THE OVERCOAT, adapted by Tom Lanter and Frank S.

He played in Major League Baseball as a catcher for the San Francisco Giants (1964-1965), Chicago Cubs (1966-1973, 1976-1977), Minnesota Twins (1974), and the San Diego Padres (1975). Hundley played the majority of his career with the Cubs and was considered their leader in the late 1960s and early 1970s. Despite being a light-hitter, Hundley was regarded as one of the best defensive catchers of his era, and the best Cubs catcher since Gabby Hartnett in 1940. Baseball career Hundley was signed by the San Francisco Giants as an amateur free agent in 1960 for the sum of $140,000. While playing for the Double-A El Paso Sun Kings in 1963, he posted a .325 batting average with 23 home runs and 81 runs batted in. Hundley made his major league debut with the Giants on September 27 1964. He returned to the minor leagues in 1965, playing for the Tacoma Giants of the Pacific Coast League although, he was called back to the major leagues briefly in June when regular Giants catcher Tom Haller was injured. In December 1965, he was traded to the Chicago Cubs along with future 20-game winner Bill Hands in exchange for Lindy McDaniel and Don Landrum, as part of first-year manager Leo Durocher's rebuilding effort. Durocher installed the 24-year-old Hundley as the Cubs' starting catcher and he went on to play in 149 games in 1966, breaking Mickey Cochrane's 41-year-old major league record for most games played by a rookie catcher. He also hit for the cycle on August 11, 1966, in a 9-8, 11 inning victory against the Houston Astros and set a major league record for most home runs by a rookie catcher with 19. Hundley led National League catchers in assists and finished the season ranked fourth in the 1966 National League Rookie of the Year voting. Hundley continued to shoulder a heavy workload in 1967, playing in 152 games and committing just four errors to set a National League record for fewest errors by a catcher in a season. He led National League catchers in putouts and won the 1967 National League Gold Glove Award for catchers as the Cubs improved from a last place finish in 1966 to finish in third place. Hundley was the first catcher to begin using a new hinged catcher's mitt that permitted a one-handed catching style, protecting his throwing hand. He became a stalwart for the Cubs, setting a record in 1968 with 160 games behind the plate (147 complete) as the Cubs again finished the season in third place. The Cubs began the 1969 season by winning 11 of their first 12 games and held first place from the first day of the season. By late June, Hundley's batting average was above .300 along with 11 home runs earning him a spot as a reserve for the National League team in the 1969 All-Star Game. The entire Chicago Cubs infield joined Hundley on the National League team with third baseman Ron Santo and shortstop Don Kessinger making the team as starting players. By August 16, the Cubs were nine games ahead of the second place New York Mets and appeared to be on their way to winning the National League Eastern Division title. However, as the season entered its final month, the Cubs would suffer an eight-game losing streak while the Mets countered with a ten-game winning streak. After 155 days in first place, the Cubs dropped to second place as the Mets went on to clinch the division title and eventually won the world championship. Hundley ended the year with a .255 batting average with 18 home runs and 64 runs batted in. He led National League catchers in assists and in games played becoming the first player to catch 150 games for three consecutive years (1967‚Äì1969). In his book, The Bill James Historical Baseball Abstract, baseball historian Bill James cited manager Durocher's method of using his regular players everyday without any rest days as a factor in the Cubs' 1969 collapse. Hundley's heavy workload began to take its toll on his body. He missed the first four games of the 1970 season when he suffered a chip fracture in his left thumb during a tag play at home plate. Worse was to come on April 21, 1970 when he suffered a severely sprained left knee during a collision at home plate with the Cardinals' Carl Taylor. The injury forced him to miss three months of the season and he ended the year having appeared in only 73 games. Hundley once again missed the opening day game of the 1971 season with an ailing knee. He made his first appearance of the season as a pinch hitter in the ninth inning of a game on April 12, 1971 and collapsed after hitting a fly ball to center field. Hundley returned to play on May 11 but, after only eight games, he had to undergo knee surgery and missed the rest of the season. Hundley returned to play in 114 games for the Cubs in 1972 and led National League catchers with a .995 fielding percentage. However, his damaged knee forced him to favor one side which caused his throws to be off mark. His heavy workload had exacted a price and he was never the same player after his knee injuries. After being traded by the Cubs, he played for the Twins, Padres, and then returned to play for the Cubs in 1976. In 1977, new Cubs manager Herman Franks named Hundley as his bullpen coach. He was activated late in the season and appeared in two games before retiring at the age of 35. Career statistics In a fourteen-year major league career, Hundley played in 1,061 games, accumulating 813 hits in 3,442 at bats for a .236 career batting average along with 82 home runs, 381 runs batted in and a .292 on-base percentage. He ended his career with a .990 fielding percentage. While Hundley was a relatively light hitter (more so later in his career), he was valued for his defensive skills and for the way he handled the pitching staff. Cubs' relief pitcher Phil Regan said of Hundley in 1972, \\"He's not only our catcher, he's our leader.\\" He was one of few catchers to steal home, doing so on May 19, 1966 against Gary Kroll of the Houston Astros after tripling off Turk Farrell. Hundley caught two no-hitters in 1972; Burt Hooton on April 16 and Milt Pappas on September 2. He is one of a handful of men to catch two no-hitters in one season. Post retirement Hundley managed in the Cubs minor league system from 1979 to 1981, leading the Midland Cubs to first place in the Western Division of the Texas League in 1979. After leaving the playing field, Hundley originated the idea of baseball fantasy camps, and since the early 1980s, has operated them to the delight of many a middle aged fan/camper and also to the former pro players who return to the uniform to help coach the teams. For years, Hundley operated camps for many major league teams but now concentrates on the Chicago Cubs. He also occasionally filled in as a commentator on Cubs radio broadcasts.{{cite web url=https://apnews.com/7cba5f159fc3f8cd41eb29d5ef71d6ba title=Cubs' Broadcaster Faces Surgery publisher=Associated Press accessdate=July 20,2019{{cite web url=https://www.chicagotribune.com/news/ct- xpm-2001-04-15-0104150199-story.html title=Cubs Catcher's House Quite a Catch publisher=Chicago Tribune accessdate=July 20,2019 His son Todd Hundley was also a catcher, playing in the major leagues for 15 years.

It provides a form of market exclusivity outside that provided by patent rights.Mossinghoff, Gerald. \\"Overview of the Hatch- Waxman Act and Its Impact on the Drug Development Process.\\" Food and Drug Law Journal. 54. (1999): 187-194. Pharmaceutical companies argue that since test data is so expensive to produce, it is an unfair advantage to let other companies rely on that data without cost. Critics charge that it can act as a restriction to producing a generic copy; that although it would not raise prices of drugs, it would prevent prices from falling due to generic competition; and make it more costly for the poor to gain access to life- saving drugs (e.g. anti-HIV & anti-malarial medications.) Developed countries with innovative pharmaceutical industries (including the United States) have sought data exclusivity provisions in Free Trade Agreements with their trading partners, e.g. DR-CAFTA which includes such a provision. According to the European Commission: :\\"\\"Data exclusivity\\" refers to the period during which the data of the original marketing authorisation holder relating to (pre-) clinical testing is protected. Accordingly, in relation to marketing authorisation applications submitted after 30 October 2005 for the applications filed in the framework of national procedures or 20 November 2005 for applications filed in the framework of the centralised procedure, 'data exclusivity' refers to the eight-year protection period during which generic applicant may not refer to the information of the original marketing authorisation holder and 'marketing exclusivity' refers to the ten-year period after which generic products can be placed on the market. However, in relation to marketing authorisation applications submitted before the above mentioned dates, the wording 'data exclusivity' refers to the six or ten-year protection period granted to the original marketing authorisation (MA) holder before generic applicants can file their applications for marketing authorisation.\\" European Commission, Pharmaceutical Sector Inquiry, Preliminary Report (DG Competition Staff Working Paper), 28 November 2008, page 17 (pdf, 1.95 MB). (See copyright notice in page 1: \\"Reproduction of parts of this report that are based on the Commission's own research is authorised, provided that the source is acknowledged. For material quoted in this report that is derived from other sources, permission must be sought directly from the copyright holder.\\") One critical issue in this regard is the issue of data exclusivity for pioneer drug companies (pharmaceutical R&D; organizations). From the standpoint of economics, industries where the R&D; process is costly and risky need longer exclusivity periods to realize innovation benefits, compared to those industries where innovation is easier and less costly. Some academics allege that pharmaceutical data exclusivity protection unfairly restricts the rapid public dispersal of knowledge that is supposed to be the trade-off for a grant of a patent or intellectual monopoly privilege.Faunce TA, Vines T, Gibbons H.

Specifically, it is considered unethical under the Declaration of Helsinki to undertake duplicative clinical trials on human subjects. Similar concerns have been raised in the context of test data protection for certain agricultural or cosmetic products, leading in some countries to proposals for cost sharing rather than exclusive rights as the form of test data protection.

The sculpture, by Niall Breton, reflects the anguish of seafaring people who watch for the safe return of loved ones. Anguish (from the Latin angustia \\"distress\\") is \\"extreme unhappiness caused by physical or mental suffering.\\"\\"anguish\\". Cambridge Dictionary. The feeling of suffering from anguish is typically preceded by a tragedy or event that has a profound meaning to the being in question. Anguish can be felt physically or mentally (often referred to as emotional distress). Anguish is also a term used in philosophy, often as a synonym for angst. It is a paramount feature of existentialist philosophy, in which anguish is often understood as the experience of an utterly free being in a world with zero absolutes (existential despair). In the theology of S√∏ren Kierkegaard, it refers to a being with total free will who is in a constant state of spiritual fear in the face of their unlimited freedom. Mental health Anguish is made up of fear, distress, anxiety and panic. These stressors cause an enormous amount of dissonance, which could then lead to issues of mental health. While taken literally anguish may be defined as a physical event, but it may be extrapolated to an event of one‚Äôs psyche. It has been found that the anguish of a significant change in the way a young student lives (i.e. their new responsibilities, being on their own, multiple deadlines etc.) has contributed to significantly increased rates of college students suffering from anxiety and depression.WILSON, R. (2015, September 4). An Epidemic of Anguish. Chronicle of Higher Education, pp. A38‚ÄìA42. Philosophy *Kierkegaard views anguish as the same as suffering. Everyone wants to find the \\"truth\\" but it takes anguish and suffering to \\"appropriate\\" the truth. Kierkegaard put it this way in 1847 and 1850. *Friedrich Nietzsche saw a new form of anguish emerging from secularisation‚Äôs erosion of any moral absolute, producing thereby what he ironically called ‚ÄúThe advantages of our times: nothing is true, everything is permitted‚Äù.Albert Camus, The Rebel (Vintage) p. 70 and p. 67 *Jean-Paul Sartre saw anguish as the product of man‚Äôs existential freedom, liable to manifest itself whenever a decision has to be made:W Ziegler, Sartre in 60 Minutes (2016) p. 48-50 thus when walking along a cliff, you might feel anguish to know that you have the freedom to throw yourself down to your imminent death.S Atkinson ed., The Philosophy Book' (London 2011) p. 195 *Hannah Arendt saw the routines of everyday life as serving as ‚Äúbanisters‚Äù against existential despair:G Gutting ed., The Cambridge Companion to Foucault (Cambridge 2003) p. 328 and p. 345 ‚Äò ‚Äúguardrails against anguish‚Äù: alarm clocks...signposts, tax forms, policemen‚Äô.J Reynolds, Understanding Existentialism (Bucks 2006) p. 72 Anguish and ethics A study done at the University of Princeton‚Äôs Center for the Study of Brain, Mind, and Behavior suggests that the presence of the emotion influences the decisions made. The study uses a functional magnetic resonance imaging machine to measure the brain waves of a subject when put into a difficult position. In this particular session, the subject was presented with a situation where she had to decide the fate of five people versus one person by the flip of a switch, and then decide the fate of five people versus one person by the physical acting of condemning a man to his death. The results of the fMRI stated that the decision of death by switch was easier than the decision of physically pushing a man to his death. It is theorized that the participant is being subjected to the emotion of anguish when faced with future possibility of physical condemning another person and therefore the brain enforces an ‚Äúemotional block‚Äù to encourage the cessation of this behavior.Breuer, H. (2004). Anguish and Ethics. Scientific American Special Edition, 14(1), 10‚Äì11. Music Music has a particular way of eliciting emotions into its listeners. Hearing a song, symphony, or sonnet filled with anguish, one might begin to reflect upon their own life and experiences that coincide with the notes, thereby bringing repressed memories beyond subconscious to our salient mind.Elliott, D.

The various category winners are awarded a copy of a statuette, officially called the Black Reel Award. The awards, first presented in 2000 in Washington, DC, are overseen by FAAAF. The awards ceremony was initially awarded online during its first two years before the first live show presentation in 2002. The awards have broadcast to radio since 2014. The Black Reel Awards is the oldest cinema-exclusive awards ceremony for African-Americans. The 20th Annual Black Reel Awards ceremony were held on February 6, 2020. History Founded by film critic Tim Gordon and Sabrina McNeal in 2000, the first annual Black Reel Awards presentation was held on February 16, 2000 online courtesy of Reel Images Magazine. Two years later, the third annual Black Reel Awards held its first live presentation at a private dinner function at the Cada Vez in Washington, DC with an audience of about 150 people. Twenty statuettes were awarded, honoring African-American artists, directors and other participants in the filmmaking industry, for their works in 2001. The ceremony ran for 90 minutes. In subsequent years, the Black Reel Awards have largely been presented in the nation‚Äôs capital, with the exception of one year when the awards were moved to New York. The awards have been presented live several times: the fourth annual Black Reel Awards presentation was held at H20 on the Southwest waterfront in Washington, DC with an audience of about 200 people; the sixth annual Black Reel Awards presentation was held at the French Embassy with an audience of about 350 people; and the thirteenth annual Black Reel Awards presentation was held at the MIST Harlem with an audience of about 200 people. Initially winners were announced online. Later, the live awards presentations would use a sealed envelope to reveal the name of each winner. The Black Reel Awards benefit The Foundation for the Advancement of African-Americans in Film (FAAAF), a non-profit arts organization whose mission is to provide educational opportunities to future minority film executives. Through the FAAAF programs \\"Reel Kids,\\" and \\"Producer's Institute,\\" scholarships are awarded to minority junior high, high school and college graduate students pursuing careers in the movie and television industries. In 2015, the Foundation changed its name to The Foundation for the Augmentation of African- Americans in Film. =Institutions= The first Outstanding Actor award was given to Denzel Washington for his performance in The Hurricane. He subsequently received the same honor the next two years, for his performances in Remember the Titans and Training Day. At the 3rd Annual Black Reel Awards ceremony, held on February 16, 2002, the Outstanding Foreign Film category was introduced. The 6th Annual Black Reel Awards, held in 2005, presented the first Vanguard Award for entertainer of the year to Jamie Foxx for his performances in Collateral, Redemption: The Stan Tookie Williams Story, and Ray.

It is located on a small island at the southern end of the Ruisseau de la Brasserie, a small river running just to the west of Montcalm Street in the former city of Hull. The building was originally constructed in 1886 as the Hull Water Works, at a time when the site was at the heart of a largely industrial area. In the subsequent decades the building served a number of different purposes. In 1974, it suffered a devastating fire. The city of Hull and the National Capital Commission joined together to rebuild the structure as a theatre. It opened in 1976, and was the first municipally run theatre in Quebec. The theatre seats up to 119. It puts on a number of different shows per year, with some 25,000 spectators per annum.

The hamlet was named after Stephen Burritt, whose family was the first to settle in this area. At one time, the hamlet prospered due to its location on the Rideau Canal. The community straddles the river, so part is located in Rideau Township, now Rideau-Goulbourn Ward in Ottawa, and part in North Grenville Township. There is a lock on the canal to bypass rapids here, the Burritts Rapids Bridge which crosses the canal and a stationary bridge which crosses the river. History In 1793, Stephen and Daniel Burritt, from Arlington, Vermont, settled in the vicinity of the area now known as Burritt's Rapids. A plaque was erected by the Ontario Archaeological and Historic Sites Board commemorating the founding of Burritt's Rapids. By 1812, Burritts Rapids had become a bustling hamlet. At the peak of its prosperity, it had telegraphic and daily mail, 2 general stores, a bakery, a millinery shop, 2 shoe shops, a tin and stove store, a grist mill, a woolen mill, a tannery, 3 blacksmith shops, 3 wagon shops, a cabinet shop, 2 churches, 2 schools, 2 hotels, a bank and an Orange Lodge. The hamlet's natural advantages as a transportation centre were enhanced by the opening of the Rideau Canal in 1831. Burritts Rapids was the site of the first bridge across the Rideau River. A post office was opened in 1839. By 1866, Burritts Rapids was a village with a population of about 400 on the Rideau canal, in the townships of Oxford and Marlborough, and counties of Carleton and Grenville. It had two schools, and citizens were in the lumber business. Ottawa City and counties of Carleton and Russell Directory, 1866-7 Unfortunately, the hamlet was by-passed by the railway, and its importance gradually diminished with the decline of the canal as a means of transportation. Burritts Rapids was home to the Rideau Correctional and Treatment Centre from 1947 until its closure in 2004. It was subsequently demolished in 2013. Public high school students in this area go to South Carleton High School in Richmond. History of Burritts Rapids Community Hall The Hall was built in 1855 by John French and operated as a general store. In 1892, the building was sold and it changed hands several more times during the early 1900s. The facility became known as the \\"Albert C. White Memorial Hall\\" in 1927, but in October 1935, Casey Swedlove sold the Hall and its property to the community. At that time, the name was formally changed to The Burritt's Rapids Community Hall, and has been run as a non- profit facility ever since. In 1984, the Hall was designated under the Ontario Heritage Act as being of architectural and historical value: \\"‚Ä¶ the building is an outstanding example of an early nineteenth century vernacular temple- fronted commercial structure, of the Classical Revival Style. It is clad in narrow feather-edge clapboard and is highlighted by recessed panelled front doors, large commercial style front windows, with panelled surrounds, engage pilasters, with classical entablature, returned eaves and small 12 over 8 upper sashes‚Ä¶\\" In 1986, an extension was added to the south side of the building. Moneys for the project were donated by several local citizens and businesses, all of which are memorialized on a plaque inside the Hall. Many of the building materials were donated by the production company which filmed \\"Boy in Blue\\", in Burritts Rapids in 1984. The roof was installed by a volunteer group who proclaimed themselves to be \\"The Geriatric Builders\\". External links *Burritt's Rapids *Burritt's Rapids, Rideau Canal Info.

In 1955 the wines of Saint- √âmilion in the wine-growing region of Bordeaux were classified. Unlike the Bordeaux Wine Official Classification of 1855 covering wines from the M√©doc and Graves regions, the Saint-√âmilion list is updated every 10 years or so. Following the initial classification, the list was updated in 1969, 1986, 1996 and most recently in 2006. However the 2006 classification was declared invalid following a series of legal actions, and the 1996 version of the classification has been reinstated for the vintages from 2006 to 2009. The region's Syndicat Viticole started planning for a classification of St.-√âmilion wine in 1930, but it was not until October 7, 1954 that the principles behind the classification became official when the INAO agreed to take responsibility for handling the classification. The first list of classified St.-√âmilion estates was published on June 16, 1955, and was amended on August 7 and October 18, 1958. The original list contained 12 Premier grands crus class√©s and 63 Grands crus class√©s.  Controversy surrounding the 2006 classification  Ch√¢teau Monbousquet was one of the estates who had their initial promotions in the 2006 classification retracted following the controversy. The fifth classification of St.-√âmilion wine, announced in September 2006 and comprising 15 Premiers grands crus class√©s and 46 Grands crus class√©s, was challenged by four dissatisfied producers that had been demoted - La Tour du Pin Figeac, Cadet Bon, Guadet and Ch√¢teau de la Marzelle - and has resulted in several confusing legal turns during 2007 and 2008 that currently mean that the 2006 classification is invalid and the 1996 classification is applied instead. The legal dispute has centered on the fact that several members of the panel involved in assessing the wines had vested interests (e.g. as n√©gociants with business dealings with some of the ch√¢teaux), and thus could be suspected of not being impartial. Initially, an administrative tribunal in Bordeaux declared the classification temporarily suspended in March 2007, after which a Bordeaux court suspended the classification indefinitely by denying a motion to lift the initial suspension. After that the Conseil d'√âtat, the French supreme administrative court, on November 12, 2007 overturned the suspension of the 2006 classification, thereby reinstating it. However, this ruling was not final, and only decided that the case of the four demoted ch√¢teaux did not merit a suspension of the entire classification. The matter was returned to a Bordeaux court to assess if the complaining ch√¢teux had been fairly treated. On July 1, 2008 this court ruled that the wine tasting mechanism used in the 2006 classification was not impartial, thus again making the entire classification invalid. Immediately after the ruling, it was estimated that a further appeals process aiming at reinstating the classification could take about two years, and would have an uncertain result. This led the French regulatory body for wine, INAO, to request the French Government to use emergency powers to reinstate St.-√âmilion classification, which it did on July 11, 2008. This decision extended the validity of the 1996 classification to the vintages 2006 to 2009. Thus, the complaining demoted ch√¢teaux are able to keep their classification, but those who were newly promoted are not. Presumably, this measure will allow INAO to arrange for a less contested classification to be finalised by around 2010. The reaction among the estates who had their promotions retracted, such as Grand Corbin-Despagne, Monbousquet, Pavie- Macquin and Troplong Mondot, was one of despair, who beyond facing financial consequences stated the decision was unjust, and damaging to the image and community of St.-√âmilion. Xavier Pariente of Troplong-Mondot said, \\"That's almost 20 years of hard work and investment by all the personnel here wiped out at the stroke of a pen. It frightens me and it revolts me\\". Ch√¢teau Ang√©lus, as of 2012 a Premiers grands crus class√©s A estate. Chateau Soutard Ch√¢teau Figeac, a Premiers grands crus class√©s B estate. In December 2008, the French senate had allowed the 8 demoted estates to regain their previous status, with Pavie-Macquin and Troplong Mondot returning to Premiers grands crus class√©s, while Bellefond-Belcier, Destieux, Fleur-Cardinale, Grand Corbin, Grand Corbin-Despagne, and Monbousquet again to become classified as Grands crus class√©s, as a result of several months of lobbying. However, in January 2009 this proposal was thrown out by the French government constitutional council. In March 2009, it was stated that the French Court of Appeal had made a final ruling, that the 2006 Saint-√âmilion classification will not stand, although the ultimate outcome was the opposite. A law passed on May 13, 2009 contained a footnote clarifying that the six chateaux promoted to Grand Cru Classe in 2006 would be able to keep their status with immediate effect, and date it back to the date of the classification, therefore the status of the classified estates of 1996, plus the eight chateaux promoted in 2006, is mandated by law until 2011, two years beyond what was previously scheduled.  The 2012 classification  The 2012 classification was conducted differently than previous efforts, with tastings and inspections outsourced by INAO to independent groups with no involvement by St.-Emilion Wine Syndicate and Bordeaux wine trade, but instead wine professionals from Burgundy, the Rh√¥ne Valley, Champagne, the Loire Valley and Provence made up a seven-person commission. There is no longer a fixed number of ch√¢teaus which can be classified, and the new rankings elevated Ch√¢teau Pavie and Ch√¢teau Ang√©lus to Premier Classe A. Among new Premiers grands crus were Larcis Ducasse, Canon- la-Gaffeli√®re and garagiste producers Valandraud and La Mondotte, while Ch√¢teau Magdelaine was omitted from the list as it will be merged with Ch√¢teau B√©lair-Monange. Ch√¢teau La Tour du Pin Figeac (Moueix) did not apply for the 2012 classification, as it was being merged with Chateau Cheval Blanc. In January 2013, Ch√¢teau La Tour du Pin Figeac (Giraud-B√©livier), Chateau Croque- Michotte and Ch√¢teau Corbin-Michotte filed complaints with a Bordeaux administrative tribunal, claiming there were procedural errors in the selection process. Chateau La Tour du Pin Figeac, had previously challenged its demotion in the disputed 2006 classification without being reinstated in 2012, while Ch√¢teau Croque-Michotte was refused promotion from Grand cru to Grand cru class√© and Ch√¢teau Corbin-Michotte had been demoted from Grand cru class√©.Mercer, Chris, Decanter.com (January 15, 2013).

Although alheira derives from alho (garlic) and was once used to describe any sausage seasoned with it, not all present-day alheiras contain garlic, although it is still a common ingredient. The type of sausage that became known as \\"alheira\\" was invented by the Jews of Portugal, who in 1497 were given the choice of either being expelled from the country or converting to Christianity. Those conversos who remained and secretly retained their beliefs avoided eating pork, forbidden in Judaism; this put them at risk of being noticed not to hang sausages, traditionally made of pork, in their fumeiros (smokehouses). As a way to avoid attracting the attention of the Portuguese Inquisition or in rural areas the Portuguese Christians, they began to make sausages from other meats such as poultry and game, mixed with bread for texture. With time, the dish spread to the remaining population and became an example of typical Portuguese cuisine, though nowadays its preparation is no longer strictly guided by Jewish dietary precepts. Alheiras were traditionally grilled or roasted and served with boiled vegetables. Nowadays they are often fried and served accompanied by french fries and a fried egg. They are often one of the cheapest items on restaurant menus, although those made with game can be expensive. Although alheiras are typically associated with the city of Mirandela, the regions of Beira Alta and Tr√°s-os-Montes are also famous for their alheiras.

Biography He was the son of Pedro Palma y Aguilera and Dolores Lasso de la Vega and went to \\"San Jos√©\\" School in Bayamo under the direction of Jos√© Mar√≠a Izaguirre whom he would later meet again in Guatemala. He wrote poetry since his youth and is considered an important Cuban poet. He joined the revolutionaries of the Ten Years' War in Cuba (1868‚Äì1878) and served briefly as a recruiter for the revolutionary forces and as an aid to Carlos Manuel de C√©spedes, the leader of the insurrection. When Bayamo was about to fall to the Spanish forces, he set fire to his own house in the citywide fire started by the residents. He went to Jamaica, New York City and Guatemala in an attempt to gain support for the Cuban insurrection. In Guatemala he met the Honduran Marco Aurelio Soto and his cousin Ram√≥n Rosa who in 1876 -with the help of Guatemalan president Justo Rufino Barrios became president and Prime Minister of Honduras, respectively. He went to Honduras as private secretary to President Soto in 1876 and left this county and returned to Guatemala when Soto resigned as president, forced by his former ally, Justo Rufino Barrios. Not until 14 years later, in 1910, did he reveal that he was the author. He received a gold medal from the Guatemalan government for his literary and patriotic contributions. By the end of the 1890s, Palma had developed a strong friendship with public speaker and journalist Rafael Spinola, editor in chief of La Ilustraci√≥n Guatemalteca and also secretary of Infrastructure of president Manuel Estrada Cabrera; by 1899, Mexican writer and diplomat Federico Gamboa arrived to Guatemala as interim Mexican Ambassador and got to know both Spinola and Palma quite well.

In 1896 the Guatemalan president Jos√© Mar√≠a Reina Barrios promoted a contest to select the lyrics of the national anthem - the National Anthem of Guatemala. The winning piece was entered anonymously and won by unanimous decision; Palma was part of the jury that selected the winner lyrics. In the 1900s, it was frequent that he wrote contributions for the Albumes de Minerva, official proceedings magazine of the Fiestas Minervalias, main propaganda event of president Estrada Cabrera. However, the author of the lyrics of the National Anthem was still in the dark; between 1896 and 1910, Guatemalans were intrigued about the anonymous contributor that won the contest in 1897; but the enigma was over when Palma Lasso -already in his death bed- confessed that he was the famous ¬´An√≥nymous¬ª; he had not signed with his name given that he was part of the jury in 1897. In the 1910 Fiestas Minervalias the government awarded him with a prize and on 23 July 1911, Guatemalan intellectuals and president Manuel Estrada Cabrera, crown him with a silver laurel crown in his residence.  Death  By early August 1911, Palm was agonizing; his children took care of him until the very last moment -especially Zoila Am√©rica Ana, who has his inseparable companion- and died at his home on 2 August 1911. A large crowd came to present the respects and to say goodbye to the poet; his remains were covered with the Cuban flag -given that he was the Cuban consul at the time of his death-. His funeral took place at 10:00 am on 3 August; doctor Luis Toledo Herrarte pronounced a speech in representation of the government and Arturo Ubico Urruela, president of Congress, spoke about the terrible loss and how his adoptive country had loved the poet very much. Finally, Rafael Ar√©valo Mart√≠nez wrote a poem in his honor.  Monuments and ceremonies in his honor  * Theater \\"Jos√© Joaquin Palma\\", Calle \\"Carlos Manuel de C√©spedes\\" #172 e/ Perucho Figueredo y Lora, Bayamo, Cuba was named in his honor. * On 2 September 1944, general Federico Ponce Vaides, then interim president of Guatemala, issued an extraordinary decree to celebrate Palma's Centennial, however, the political situation Guatemala was going through at the time -after the resignation of general Jorge Ubico- did not permit the ceremonies to go as planned. On 11 September 1944, only the Universidad Nacional held a ceremony in their building, by invitation of doctor Carlos Federico Mora, president of the University. Doctor Calixto Garc√≠a, business attach√© of Cuba in Guatemala, was the guest of honor, David Vela gave the ceremonial speech and Jos√© Joaqu√≠n Palma, grandson of the poet spoke on his behalf. Then, on the house #27 on the 10 E. street, where Palma died in 1911, both Cuban and Guatemalan national anthems were played and a commemorative plaques was unveiled. * Carlos Pr√≠o Socarr√°s government in Cuba declared the house where Palma Lasso was born as a Cuban National Monument in 1951. = Return of his remains to Cuba = Palma funeral ceremony in Bayamo, Cuba, 1951. In 1951, Cuban president Carlos Pr√≠o Socarr√°s requested Guatemalan president Jacobo √Årbenz the return of Palma's remains to Cuba; upon learning that Palma's family agreed to this, √Årbenz asked his Secretary of Foreign Affairs and Secretary of Education to take care of the ceremonies. On 16 April 1951, after his remains were incinerated in presence of his family, Cuban Ambassador and a commission of the Guatemalan government, the urn was placed on an artillery cart of the Guatemalan Army and taken to Congress, where it remained for 24 hours, while it had a Guard of Honor of the President and his cabinet, representative to Congress, diplomats, Army cadets, school delegations, teachers, member of the Guatemalan Society of Geography and History, journalist and intellectuals. Doctor Ra√∫l Roa Garcia, director of Culture the Cuban government, made the ceremonial speech and a student choral group sang the anthems of Cuba and Guatemala, and, for the first time, the Hymn to \\"Jos√© Joaqu√≠n Palma\\", composed by Ra√∫l Marchena. To end the ceremony, a bronze plaque with the signatures of Palma Lasso and Rafael Alrez Ovalle ‚Äì who composed the music the Guatemalan Anthem ‚Äì was unveiled. The next day, 17 April, in a ceremony in Congress, colonel Alfredo Lima and doctor Aureliano S√°nchez Arango, pronounce a eulogy of Palma Lasso, and stressed the love that he had for his adoptive country, Guatemala. Zoila Am√©rica Ana Palma de Figueroa, daughter of the poet was in attendance for this ceremony, which ended with a speech by representative Marco Antonio Villamar Contreras, who bid farewell to Palma in the name of the people of Guatemala. Immediately after, his remains were lifted by the Secretaries of Education of both Cuba and Guatemala, doctor S√°nchez Arango and H√©ctor Morgan Garc√≠a, respectively and by the President of Congress and the Secretary of Foreign Affairs of Guatemala, Manuel Galich and the general public sang the original Guatemalan Anthem lyrics as they were written by Palma; then, the urn was placed on a military jeep and transported to La Aurora International Airport escorted by Army Cadets. Once at the cemetery, Morgan Garc√≠a, officially gave the remains to the Cuban delegation. At 1:15 pm, five Cuban airplanes took off back to Cuba, and were escorted by a Guatemalan plane formation to the Atlantic coast. Cuban president Carlos Pr√≠o Socarr√°s, his cabinet, diplomats, military commanders, journalist, school children, teachers and other guests received Palma's urn at the Rancho Boyeros military airport. Thousand of children with both Guatemala and Cuba flags walked alongside the urn until it was placed in the Hall of the Lost Steps and the government declared national mourning on 17 and 18 April. Palma was awarded the titles of \\"Bayamo's best son\\" and \\"Major general of the Cuban Army\\".

Established in 1930, it is named for the historical Virginia Gazette published between 1736 and 1780. It is published twice a week in the broadsheet format. Historical papers Virginia Gazette, November 4, 1763 There were actually three papers published in Williamsburg under the name The Virginia Gazette between 1736 and 1780. Together, these papers serve as an important record for Virginia's colonial history. The original Virginia Gazette, the first newspaper ever published in Virginia, was established by William Parks, who printed the first four-page edition on August 6, 1736. Its motto was \\"Containing the freshest Advices, Foreign and Domestick.\\" Three years earlier, Parks had founded The Maryland Gazette in Annapolis, Maryland. In 1743, Parks built a paper mill in Williamsburg; he purchased the raw material to create newsprint from Benjamin Franklin. The paper was published, successively, by William Parks (1736‚Äì1750), William Hunter (1751‚Äì1761), Joseph Royle (1761‚Äì1765), Alexander Purdie and John Dixon (1766-1775), Dixon and Hunter (1775-1778), and Dixon and Thomas Nicolson (1779‚Äì1780). The last issue was published on April 8, 1780, after which point the paper relocated to Richmond, Virginia's new capital. In 1766 William Rind founded a competing newspaper also called The Virginia Gazette. This paper was published by Rind (1766‚Äì1773), then by his widow Clementina Rind (1773‚Äì1774), and finally John Pinkney (1774‚Äì1776). Its last issue was printed on February 3, 1776. On February 3, 1775, Alexander Purdie, previously a publisher of the original Gazette, started a third paper of the same name. It was published by Purdie until his death in 1779; it was then published by John Clarkson and Augustine Davis until December 9, 1780. Afterward, various papers were published periodically around Virginia using the Virginia Gazette banner. Modern paper In 1893 W. C. Johnston brought the name Virginia Gazette back to Williamsburg in newspaper form, but unrelated to its colonial predecessors. An Ohio native and an alumnus of the College of William and Mary, Johnston served as clerk of the Williamsburg city council, member of the board of registrars and the Williamsburg Business Association, and postmaster. As editor of the Virginia Gazette, a Democratic weekly, Johnston campaigned vigorously to attract industry to the region. The Gazette, for example, described a new mill that opened in 1895 as \\"the morning star of the future that heralds a glorious dawn of prosperity upon this little city.\\" Typical content included local and national news, general interest stories, advertisements, business directories, college notes, and social happenings. L. S. Cottrell, Johnston's original printer, became owner and publisher in 1894 but sold the paper back to Johnston in March 1896. Circulation by 1900 was approximately 500, and there was no competing paper published in town during the paper's life. Robert P. Scott became owner and publisher of the Gazette in 1917, with Johnston still serving as editor. Local news still predominated, but national issues were becoming increasingly important. In 1920, Johnston editorialized against women's suffrage as a violation of states' rights: \\"No one questions the ability of women. . . . No one questions that they are as capable as men to cast their ballots. But thousands question the manner in which women are to be enfranchised and honestly believe that the surrender to the general government of the powers of the state is too big a price to pay for a privilege which is chimerical and visionary in the extreme.\\" By 1922, the paper ceased publication. Another Virginia Gazette appeared in 1925, associated with the William Parks School of Journalism at the College of William and Mary, but it lasted only through 1927. Havilock Babcock, of the journalism faculty was editor and students served as reporters and handled all the other newspaper jobs, except printing. In 1930, W. A. R. Goodwin, pastor of the local Bruton Parish Church and a co-founder of Colonial Williamsburg, made a push for a paper to return to Williamsburg under the banner of The Virginia Gazette. At Goodwin's urging publisher J. A. Osborne moved to town from Florida and established the modern paper. In 1961 the Osborne family sold the paper to John O. W. Gravely III. Gravely died in 1975 and his widow Martha became president and publisher. The Gravely family sold the paper in 1986 to the Chesapeake Publishing Corp. of Easton, MD., a subsidiary of Whitney Communications. Later in 2001 Chesapeake sold the paper to the Daily Press, a Tribune Co. daily in Newport News, Virginia. Through the years, the paper won Virginia Press Association's award for community excellent in publishing three times, in 1969, 1980 and 1994. Long a weekly newspaper, the Gazette expanded to twice-weekly in 1984. The current publisher is W. C. \\"Bill\\" O'Donovan who has served in that capacity since 1986. beginning as an editor under Gravely.

Conkling at Camp Upton in 1917 Major General Enoch Herbert Crowder, USA (April 11, 1859 ‚Äì May 7, 1932) was an American Army lawyer who served as the Judge Advocate General of the United States Army from 1911 to 1923. Crowder is most noted for implementing and administering the United States Selective Service Act of 1917, under which thousands of American men were drafted into military service during World War I. Early life and education Enoch Crowder was born in Edinburg, Missouri in 1859. After graduating from Grand River College at 16, he taught at local schools until applying to the United States Military Academy on the advice of his mother, Mary Crowder. He entered West Point in 1877, graduating in 1881. Lieutenant Crowder was assigned to the 8th Cavalry, stationed around Brownsville, Texas. During this tour he studied law and in received a license to practice law in Texas in 1884. The same year, Crowder obtained a transfer to the Jefferson Barracks in Missouri. In 1885, Lieutenant Crowder was assigned Professor of Military Science at the University of Missouri. Here he instructed two companies of cadets and created the first ROTC cadet band in the United States, which later became known as Marching Mizzou. Soon after obtaining a law degree in 1886, Crowder was promoted to First Lieutenant and ordered to rejoin his regiment as a troop commander in the Geronimo campaign. Following the campaign's conclusion in September 1886, he resumed teaching at the University of Missouri until 1889. Judge Advocate General Upon completion of this detail, Lieutenant Crowder returned to the 8th Cavalry at Fort Yates, Dakota Territory, where he participated in the final campaign against Sitting Bull. In 1891, upon his promotion to captain he accepted a position as the acting Judge Advocate General of the Department of the Platte in Omaha, Nebraska. In January 1895, this temporary branch transfer became final and Crowder was promoted to major. The beginning of the Spanish‚ÄìAmerican War marked his promotion to lieutenant colonel. From 1898 to 1901, while in the Philippines, he served as a judge advocate, and later served as secretary to the island governors, one of whom was Arthur MacArthur, Jr., father of Douglas MacArthur. He also served on the commission which arranged the Spanish surrender of the Philippines. During his service in the Philippines, he filled many important posts in the military government of the Islands, specializing in military law. In 1899, he headed the Board of Claims, served on the Philippine Supreme Court, and drafted the new Philippine criminal code. While in the Philippines, Crowder impressed then Governor General William Howard Taft with his legal acumen. Taft had Crowder serve as a de facto advisor to the Vatican's counsel regarding the transfer of \\"friars' lands\\" to Philippine nationals in an attempt to create a system of indigenous land ownership in the hopes that the people of the Philippines would have a stake in their eventual independence.Joshua Kastenberg, To Raise and Discipline an Army: Major General Enoch Crowder, the Judge Advocate General's Office, and the Realignment of Civil and Military Relations in World War I. DeKalb : Northern Illinois University Press, [2017] Impressed with the ability Crowder had demonstrated in the Philippines, Judge Advocate General Davis in 1901 called him to Washington to serve as deputy judge advocate general. In this capacity, Crowder assisted in the prosecution of the then noteworthy Deming case in 1902, became a member of the general staff, and attained the rank of colonel. In the Russo-Japanese War of 1904‚Äì1905 he was senior American observer with the Japanese Army. From 1906 to 1909, while serving on the staff of the provisional governors in Cuba, he oversaw the Cuban elections in 1908, and later helped draft a body of laws for Cuba. In 1910, he represented the United States at the Fourth Pan American Conference in Buenos Aires and in that capacity made official visits to Chile, Peru, Ecuador, Colombia, and Panama. On February 11, 1911, after studying the military justice and penal systems of France and England on a European tour, he returned to Washington to be promoted to brigadier general and assume the duties as Judge Advocate General of the United States Army, a post he held for 12 years. As Judge Advocate General, General Crowder initiated a number of innovations, including the regular publication of Judge Advocate General opinions; the issuance of a new digest (published in 1912) of all JAG opinions issued since 1862; and a program for the legal education of line officers at government expense. He additionally supervised the revision of the Articles of War for the first time since 1874, revised the Manual for Courts-Martial and took an active part in prison reform in the army. Selective Service Act On April 6, 1917, the United States officially entered World War I. As Provost Marshal of the Army, Crowder led the drafting of the Selective Service Act which was passed by the U.S. Congress in May 1917. General Crowder, as he became known, was also responsible for directing of the Selective Service and supervised the draft ‚Äì the registration, classification, and induction ‚Äì of all American men who were 18‚Äì30 years of age into the armed services ‚Äì over 2,800,000 men during the war. The officers who served under General Crowder during this period are legion. Among these are the following: Major Hugh S. Johnson, Major Cassius Dowell, Lieutenant Colonel Allen W. Gullion, Major John H. Wigmore, Major Charles B. Warren, Captain M. C. Cramer, and Lieutenant Colonel E. A. Kreger. Although offered a promotion to the rank of lieutenant general in 1918, General Crowder, mindful of public and Congressional opposition to ‚Äúswivel chair‚Äù generals, refused the promotion, seeking instead a field command. In October 1917, Crowder was promoted to major general. As Judge Advocate General, he supervised the administration of military justice in the army during the period when the number of general courts-martial rose from 6,200 in 1917 to over 20,000 in 1918. In 1918, the offices of Secretary of War Newton Baker issued the \\"work or fight\\" order, and Crowder became in charge of executing the order which mandated that virtually every activity in the country support the war effort. Crowder was also instrumental in ensuring that the United States applied the laws of war to German prisoners of war, and he sought to limit military jurisdiction to uniformed personnel. On September 26, 1918, in response to newspaper reports of military camps being overcome by the Great Influenza Pandemic, Crowder cancelled the military draft calls for October. He wrote a book entitled The Spirit of Selective Service. Post‚ÄìWorld War I After the war, General Crowder found himself, along with the entire military justice system, the center of a storm of controversy, stemming from charges that the military justice system was \\"un-American.\\" Crowder, a perceptive critic of the system who had already commenced work on needed reform, now accelerated his efforts. The specific recommendations he submitted to Congress, most of which were subsequently adopted, included greater safeguards for the accused, changes in the composition and powers of special courts-martial, and the addition of an authority in the President to reverse or alter any court-martial sentence found to have been adjudged erroneously. =Ambassador to Cuba= In the spring of 1919, at the invitation of Cuban President Menocal, Crowder went to Cuba to advise on revisions to the election laws which he had helped write years earlier. He stayed for several years with the U.S. title Special Representative of the President and imposed reforms and appointments on the government of President Alfredo Zayas before a U.S. bank would make a critical loan to the Cuban government. Once the loan was made, Zayas undid those reforms and appointments. Nevertheless, Crowder retired from the army on February 14, 1923, and on the same day was appointed the first Ambassador from the United States to Cuba, a post which he held until 1927. =Retirement and death= From 1927 until his death in 1932, General Crowder was engaged in the private practice of law in Chicago. Crowder died in Washington, D.C., on May 7, 1932. He was buried at Arlington National Cemetery. Awards and honors Among his honors and decorations were the Distinguished Service Medal, the Cuban Order of Carlos Manuel de Cespedes, the Japanese Order of the Rising Sun, Knight Commander of the British Order of St. Michael and St. George, Commander of the Legion of Honor, and Commander of the Italian Order of the Crown. Legacy Perhaps the most apt description of the service to his country by Enoch H. Crowder is contained in the words of the late Henry L. Stimson, Secretary of State in the cabinet of President Herbert Hoover and Secretary of War in the cabinets of Presidents William Howard Taft and Franklin D. Roosevelt, who said of General Crowder: His name is memorialized in his home state of Missouri through the naming of a state park in his honor and through the designation of the World War II training center at Neosho, Missouri, as Camp Crowder. The ROTC building at the University of Missouri, Crowder Hall, is also named in his honor. He has been the subject of biographical studies. See also * Fort Crowder (a.k.a.

It intended to convert a number of canals to railways, but was leased by the London and North Western Railway (LNWR) from 1847, and although they built one railway in their own right, the LNWR were keen that they did not build any more. They continued to act as a semi-autonomous body, managing the canals under their control, and were critical of the LNWR for not using the powers which the Shropshire Union Company had obtained to achieve domination of the markets in Shropshire and Cheshire by building more railways. The company grew out of the amalgamation of the Chester Canal with its branch to Middlewich and the Birmingham and Liverpool Junction Canal, which ran from Nantwich to Autherley. They took over the Eastern and Western branches of the Montgomery Canal, the Shrewsbury Canal and leased the Shropshire Canal. Although plans to convert them to railways had been dropped by 1849, the LNWR bought the Shropshire Canal outright in 1857, following severe subsidence, and used it as the route for a railway to Coalport, opened in 1861. Most of the profits came as a result of the company acting as a carrier, rather than from tolls. In addition to running narrow boats on the canals, they had a thriving business carrying goods across the River Mersey, between Liverpool, Ellesmere Port, and Birkenhead. They made a healthy operating profit until the 1870s, but this then diminished during the next 30 years. They looked at upgrading the canal to take larger vessels in the 1890s, prompted by the opening of the Manchester Ship Canal, but this did not occur. They saw a brief improvement in their financial position in the early 20th century, but this collapsed with the onset of the First World War. Government subsidies sustained them until 1920, but rising wage costs and the 8-hour day resulted in them ceasing to act as a carrier, and the LNWR bought the company in late 1922. On 1 January 1923, the LNWR became part of the London, Midland and Scottish Railway (LMS), with the passing of the Railways Act 1921 (Grouping Act). The Montgomery Canal closed in 1936 after a major breach, and most of the canals were closed under the provisions of an abandonment order obtained in 1944. The Ellesmere Port to Autherley section and the branch to Middlewich remained open, and have since been named the Shropshire Union Canal. The branch to Llangollen, which was retained as a water feeder, has been reopened in the leisure age as the Llangollen Canal, and parts of the Montgomery Canal have been restored, with ongoing plans for a full restoration. A fledgling scheme to conserve and reopen the Shrewsbury Canal is having some success, and a small part of the Shropshire Canal is now part of the Ironbridge Gorge Museums. Part of the Stafford to Shrewsbury Line, the only railway built by a canal company, remains open from Shrewsbury to Wellington, and is served by Transport for Wales. History Llangollen canal: The final narrows before Llangollen In 1844, the Ellesmere and Chester Canal Company, which owned the broad canals from Ellesmere Port to Chester and from Chester to Nantwich, with a branch to Middlewich, began discussions with the narrow Birmingham and Liverpool Junction Canal, which ran from Nantwich to Autherley, where it joined the Staffordshire and Worcestershire Canal. The two companies had always worked together, in a bid to maintain their profits against competition from the railways, and amalgamation seemed to be a logical step. An agreement was worked out by August, and the two companies then sought an Act of Parliament to authorise the takeover. This was granted on 8 May 1845, when the larger Ellesmere and Chester Canal Company was formed. =Reformation as a joint canal - railway company= Almost immediately, a committee was set up to look at options for converting all or part of the canals into railways, and extending the network. Although they had already tried using a steam tug to haul a train of boats, they realised that not all of their canals were suitable for such use, and that a locomotive on a railway with good gradients offered a better solution. The Staffordshire and Worcestershire Canal were alarmed by the announcement that many of the canals might close, on the basis that removal of one would have a serious effect on another, and sought to oppose the action. The committee met with the railway engineer Robert Stephenson on 24 July 1845, who suggested that various schemes should be joined together to avoid competition in Parliament. George Loch, who was on the board of the Ellesmere and Chester Canal, worked on the details for what would become the Shropshire Union, which involved amalgamation of several railway and canal companies. Among the canals to be included in the larger scheme were the Eastern and Western branches of the Montgomery Canal, the Shrewsbury Canal and the Shropshire Canal. While much of the canal network would be converted to railways, some would be retained in water, including the Shrewsbury Canal, the Shropshire Canal, and the line from Ellesmere Port via Barbridge to Middlewich, which served the trade in salt. Four new railways were proposed. The first would run from Crewe to Newtown, via Nantwich, Whitchurch, Ellesmere, Oswestry and Welshpool, with a branch from Whitchurch to Wem. At Newtown, it would meet with a projected railway to Aberystwyth. The second would run from the North Staffordshire Railway at Stone or Norton Bridge to Stafford, continuing through Newport, Donnington and Wellington to Shrewsbury. A third would follow the course of the River Severn from Shrewsbury to Worcester, with a branch from Ironbridge to Donnington and Wellington. The final one would connect Wolverhampton to the Chester and Crewe Railway, passing through Market Drayton and Nantwich. The proposed capital for the venture was ¬£1.4 million, and the engineers were listed as William Cubitt, Robert Stephenson and W A Provis, the resident engineer for the Ellesmere and Chester Canal. The joint company obtained Acts of Parliament in 1846 to cover the first three of the four railways, and to reform itself as the Shropshire Union Railways and Canal Company (SUR&CC;). The new company was authorised to take over the Shrewsbury Canal and to buy the Montgomery Canal and the Shropshire Canal. The intent behind the acts was to build railways at a reduced cost, by using the existing routes of the canals the company owned. New share capital of ¬£3.3 million could be raised, with an additional ¬£1.1 million if required. Holders of shares in the existing canal companies exchanged them for new shares. The Ellesmere and Chester was valued at ¬£250,004, the Birmingham and Liverpool Junction at ¬£150,000, and the Shrewsbury at ¬£75,000. The company carried forward debts and liabilities of ¬£800,207. =Takeovers= The Shropshire Union Company bought the eastern branch of the Montgomery Canal in February 1847, for ¬£78,210. Three years later, on 5 February 1850, they paid ¬£42,000 for the western branch. The Shropshire Canal had been valued at ¬£72,500, but rather than buy it, the company decided to lease it from 1 November 1849, paying ¬£3,125 per year. They also started work on the Shrewsbury and Stafford Railway, confident that it would not result in the canals losing revenue. However, dealing with ever- expanding railway companies proved difficult. They had originally formed a contract with the Shrewsbury, Wolverhampton, Dudley and Birmingham project, which was subsequently leased to the London and Birmingham Railway. The London and Birmingham saw the Shropshire Union's fourth railway proposal, from Wolverhampton to Crewe, as an important part of their main line to Holyhead, and formed an alliance with the Crewe and Holyhead Railway and the Manchester and Birmingham Railway. The three companies would support the Shropshire Union, against the Grand Junction Railway, who were proposing an alternative route between Wolverhampton and Crewe. The support was short-lived, as the London and Birmingham Railway, the Manchester and Birmingham Railway, and the Grand Junction Railway amalgamated on 1 January 1846, to become the London and North Western Railway (LNWR), and suddenly the Shropshire Union route was a threat. By the autumn of 1846, the LNWR had offered to lease the Shropshire Union, and the directors felt that a guaranteed income from a powerful company was probably better than most other options. They agreed to the terms in December, and the LNWR obtained an Act of Parliament in June 1847 to authorise the arrangement. The Shrewsbury and Stafford Railway was opened on 1 June 1849, and lease payments began a month later on 1 July. The arrangement of the lease was not fully completed until 25 March 1857, but the LNWR, struggling with their own success, persuaded the Shropshire Union not to build any more railways, in exchange for a commitment to servicing the canal debts. The Shropshire Union thus lost its independence after a very short period, but continued to manage the canals under its control, and in this they had a remarkably free hand. By 1849, the plan to turn the canals into railways had been dropped, and the Company were leasing the Shropshire Canal, which ran from Wrockwardine Wood where there was a junction with the Trench branch of the Shrewsbury Canal, to Coalport, on the River Severn. Following the Great Western Railway's take-over of the Shrewsbury and Birmingham's railway line through Oakengates and its branch from Madeley Wood to Lightmoor on 1 September 1854, the Shropshire Union manager, Robert Skey, recommended to the LNWR that the Shropshire Canal should be converted to a railway in January 1855, but no action was taken. However, after a series of breaches later that year and in 1856, the LNER were faced with spending ¬£30,000 on repairing the canal. Instead, they obtained an Act of Parliament in 1857, which allowed them to buy the canal for ¬£62,500, close the northern section from Wrockwardine Wood to the Windmill inclined plane, and build a railway line along its course. The closure was delayed until 1 June 1858, and the railway branch to Coalport opened in mid-1861. =Competition= The LNWR had sought to build a railway connecting Shrewsbury, Welshpool, Oswestry and Newtown in 1853, but had withdrawn the bill from Parliament after discussions with the Great Western Railway. The Oswestry and Newtown Railway was subsequently built by the Great Western, with support from former shareholders of the Montgomery Canal, who had hoped that selling the canal to the Shropshire Union would result in it being converted to a railway. It was completed in June 1861, and ran parallel to the Montgomery Canal. Another line opened in 1864, the Oswestry, Ellesmer and Whitchurch Railway, which was part of the Cambrian Railway. The Shorpshire Union negotiated with both companies on rates, and managed to keep the canal rates slightly lower than those on the railways. At their annual meeting in September 1861, Robert Skey stated that the canals brought some ¬£60,000 in trade to the LNWR each year. However, the relationship with the LNWR was not always smooth, who were castigated at the 1862 meeting for failing to use powers which the Shropshire Union already had, to gain control of Shropshire and Montgomeryshire through the construction of new railways. At that time, the Shropshire Union were busy converting and extending a tramway which ran from Pontcysyllte to Afon-eitha to allow locomotives to run on it. The work was finished in 1867, and ran for a time with a borrowed locomotive, until they bought their own from Crewe works in 1870. To save money on the maintenance of Trench Inclined Plane on the Shrewsbury Canal, the company leased Lubstree Wharf on the Humber Arm of the Newport Branch from 1870, and built a railway to Lilleshall Works, which provided most of the traffic on the Shrewsbury Canal. By 1869, the Shropshire Union had a thriving business carrying goods from a base at Chester Basin, Liverpool, across the River Mersey to Ellesmere Port and Birkenhead. The LNWR was also involved in cross-river trade, using private carriers, and this was transferred to the Shropshire Union in 1870, after they had suggested it. The company bought out the lighterage business of William Oulton in 1870, moved their base from Chester Basin to Manchester Basin, and bought the Mersey Carrying Co in 1883. Under the terms of the lease with the LNWR, the company was limited in the types of goods they could carry, and although they made a healthy operating profit until the late 1860s, this did not cover the interest on debts or dividends. Between 1850 and 1870, receipts had risen from ¬£104,638 to ¬£145,976, but costs had risen much faster, and the average surplus had fallen from ¬£45,885 to ¬£11,717. Most of the income was generated by their carrying business, rather than by tolls for use of the canal network. Haulage of their boats by horses had been contracted out to Bishtons until the mid-1860s, when the company took that function back, so that they could use steam haulage if that proved desirable, but in practice the only route where steam tugs were used was on the Ellesmere Port to Chester section. Horses were still thought to be cheaper, and remained in use until the carrying business ceased. In order to fulfill the carrying business, they owned 213 narrowboats in 1870, rising to 395 in 1889 and 450 in 1902. In 1888 they experimented with locomotive haulage, running on gauge tracks, at Worleston on the Middlewich Branch. Their engineer, G R Jebb, wrote a report on the experiment, but no further action was taken. The next development was at Ellesmere Port, where the Manchester Ship Canal cut off the Port from the River Mersey. From 16 July 1891, all traffic from the port had to pass along the canal, and entered the river through Eastham Lock. Access to the river had previously been by a tidal basin, but this was fitted with double gates where it connected to the ship canal. The Shropshire Union spent ¬£37,850 constructing a new quay next to the gates, long, and suitable for ships up to 4,000 tons. While the ship canal was under construction, the Shropshire Union investigated the cost of upgrading their line from Ellesmere Port to Autherley to take larger barges. Jebb estimated that it would cost around ¬£13,500 per mile (¬£8,400 per km), so the total cost would have been ¬£891,475. In the autumn of 1890, they were discussing plans for a large canal from the Mersey to Birmingham via the Potteries with the North Staffordshire Railway. Neither scheme came to fruition, but the Shropshire Union spent large amounts of money on building better wharves and warehouses at many of the Pottery towns. =Decline= For the final 30 years of the nineteenth century, the Shropshire Union network had made a small operating surplus, although it did not cover dividends or interest in its debts. The situation improved during the early years of the twentieth century, but collapsed again at the start of the First World War. Government subsidies propped up the operation when hostilities ceased, but wages had increased significantly, the eight-hour day had been extended to boatmen and rivermen, and raw materials were more expensive. When subsidies were withdrawn from 14 August 1920, the operation was no longer viable. Boating families who lived on 202 boats were told that all carrying would cease, although the waterways would stay open, in the hope that private boats might use them. The Ellesmere Port facilities were leased to the Manchester Ship Canal, for a period of 50 years, while the Great Western Railway took over those at Liverpool. In late 1922, the LNWR bought out the company, under the provisions of the L&NWR; (SUR&CC;) Preliminary Absorption Scheme, by exchanging all remaining Shropshire Union stock for LNWR stock. A few days afterwards, at the start of 1923, the LNWR was absorbed into the London Midland and Scottish Railway (LMS) as part of The Grouping, under which most of the railways of Britain were formed into four groups. A period of steady decline set in, with reduced maintenance making it more difficult for boats to operate. The Weston Branch of the Montgomery Canal had closed in 1917, following a breach near Hordley, and most of the main line was closed in February 1936 when a breach occurred just to the north of the aqueduct over the River Perry, about a mile (1.6 km) from Frankton Junction. Finally, the LMS obtained an Act of Abandonment in 1944, which resulted in the closure of of canals under their control. For the Shropshire Union system, this included the Montgomery Canal, the Shrewsbury Canal, and the remaining short section of the Shropshire Canal, leaving only the main line from Ellesmere to Autherley, and the branch to Middlewich. The branch to Llangollen was also retained, but only as a feeder to supply water to the canal. The other main sources of water were the Belvide Reservoir, near the A5 road at Brewood, and the outflow from the Barnhurst Sewage Treatment Works at Autherley Junction. Shropshire Union railways The Shropshire Union Company constructed and ran one of the few railways in England which were built by a canal company. The railway was the Stafford to Shrewsbury Line, via Newport and Wellington. The Shropshire Union Company were solely responsible for the section from Stafford to Wellington, but the building and operation of the long section between Shrewsbury and Wellington was shared with the Shrewsbury and Birmingham Railway. After the LNWR take over of the Shropshire Union network, the Shrewsbury and Wellington Railway was operated as a Joint railway by the Great Western Railway and the LNWR. The Stafford to Shrewsbury Railway opened on 1 June 1849 and was in length. The London and North Western Railway leased the line from July 1847, before it was complete. =Shropshire Union railways today= The Shrewsbury and Wellington section is still in use today by Transport for Wales. Passenger services on the Stafford to Wellington section ended on 7 September 1964. Goods services ceased between Stafford and Newport on 1 August 1966 and this branch from Wellington was cut back to Donnington on 22 November 1969. In June 2009, the Association of Train Operating Companies, in its Connecting Communities: Expanding Access to the Rail Network report, which proposed a ¬£500m scheme to open 33 stations on 14 lines closed in the Beeching Axe, including seven new parkway stations, identified the line from Stafford to Wellington as a potential link that could feasibly be re-opened. The canals today The Longden-on-Tern aqueduct on the Shrewsbury Canal As of 2017, the main line from Ellesmere Port to Autherley and the branch to Middlewich are still open; they are known as the Shropshire Union Canal. The branch from Hurleston Junction to Llangollen has been reopened for navigation, having been promoted as suitable for pleasure boating from the mid-1950s, and has been re- branded as the Llangollen Canal. The Montgomery Canal has been partially re- opened. The first section restored was at Welshpool, when the line of the canal was threatened by a bypass, and this isolated section was reopened in 1969. The section southwards from Frankton Junction has been restored and opened progressively since 1987, with additions in 1995, 1996, 2003, 2007 and the latest stretch from Redwith Bridge to Pryce's Bridge in July 2014. There are ongoing efforts to complete the restoration of most of the remaining un- navigable sections. A Trust has been set up to conserve the remains of the Shrewsbury Canal, with a view to reopening it in the longer term.The Shrewsbury and Newport Canals Trust A feasibility study and a detailed engineering report were commissioned and completed in 2004, and concluded that there were no major engineering obstacles to a full reopening. A short section of the Shropshire Canal including the Hay Inclined Plane has been incorporated into the Ironbridge Gorge Museums. The canal contains water near the derelict Madeley Wood Brick and Tile Works, and the section at the bottom of the inclined plane at Coalport is also in water. The inclined plane was partially restored in the 1970s, and further restoration took place in the 1990s.

The film is based on Hairyozuma shimatsu by Yasuhiko Takiguchi. Its original Japanese title is J≈çi-uchi: Hairy≈ç tsuma shimatsu. Donald Richie suggests an approximate translation, \\"Rebellion: Receive the Wife\\". Plot In the Edo period of Japan, in the year 1725, Isaburo Sasahara (Toshiro Mifune) is a vassal of the daimy≈ç of the Aizu clan, Masakata Matsudaira. Isaburo is one of the most skilled swordsmen in the land, whose principal rival is his good friend Tatewaki Asano (Tatsuya Nakadai). Isaburo is in a loveless marriage with a shrew of a woman. One day, one of the daimyo's advisors orders Isaburo's elder son Yogoro (Go Kato) to marry the daimyo's ex-concubine, Ichi (Yoko Tsukasa), even though she is the mother to one of the daimyo's sons. With much trepidation, the family agrees. In time, Ichi and Yogoro find love and happiness in the marriage and a daughter, Tomi, is born. However, the daimyo's primary heir dies, and he orders his ex-concubine to rejoin his household to care for their son and heir. The family refuses, but Ichi is tricked into the castle by Isaburo's younger son, and her husband and father- in-law are ordered to commit seppuku for their insolence and insubordination. Isaburo counters that he will comply only if the heads of the daimyo and his two primary advisors are brought to him first. Isaburo sends his younger son and wife away and dismisses his household servants. With his elder son, he prepares for battle, removing the tatami from his house to prevent slipping in the blood that will be spilled and removing the house's walls to allow for more space for combat. The daimyo's steward, accompanied by a platoon of 20 samurai, brings Ichi to the Sasahara house and tries to force her at spear point to renounce her marriage to Yogoro and join the daimyo's household. The daimyo also \\"graciously\\" offers to commute Isaburo and Yogoro's sentences to life confinement in a shrine outside his castle. Not only does Ichi refuse to join his household, she throws herself onto a spear instead of abandoning her husband. Her husband goes to her side and is killed with her in his arms. His father, enraged, kills the steward's entire party, killing the steward last as he attempts to flee. Burying the dead couple, Isaburo now decides to take his case to the Shogun in Edo regardless of the consequences to his clan, accompanied by Tomi. Tatewaki, who is guarding the gate, cannot permit Isaburo to pass, and a climactic duel follows with his good friend. Isaburo is the victor, but assassins hidden nearby cut Isaburo down with musket fire. In his dying breath, he laments that no one will ever know the love story of Yogoro and Ichi, which had inspired him, an otherwise obedient vassal, to rise against his clan and lord. He beseeches Tomi to be a good and kind woman like her mother, and to seek out a fine and kind husband like her father. As Isaburo dies, we see Tomi's wet-nurse comforting the baby: she has been secretly following him.

Typically backed by music properties, the investment vehicle was pioneered in 1997 by rock and roll investment banker David Pullman through his $55 million David Bowie bond deal. Background While a celebrity bond can cover any work of art whose future royalties are based in part on a widespread reputation of the creator of the work, celebrity bonds are usually music-based. For a music-based celebrity bond, the issuer seeks to put together intellectual property rights of one or various artists to \\"songs that have stood the test of time\\", typically \\"top-40 greatest hits across genres from jazz to rap to rhythm and blues\\". In addition to getting money upfront, artists additionally retain ownership of their work and do not have to pay tax on what the IRS considers a loan since yet-to-be received royalties are re-characterized by the bond agreement as loan interest and principal payments. The artists also pass on the risk to investors that the works backing up the celebrity bond will lose their appeal where the investors are in a better position than the artist to assess such a risk. Bowie Bonds Bowie Bonds are asset-backed securities of current and future revenues of the 25 albums (287 songs) that David Bowie recorded before 1990. Bowie Bonds were pioneered in 1997 by rock and roll investment banker David Pullman. Issued in 1997, the bonds were bought for US$55 million by the Prudential Insurance Company of America, or about $ in today's dollars. The bonds paid an interest rate of 7.9% and had an average life of ten years,\\"The Pennsylvania Gazette: David Pullman\\", fetched 16 March 2009, a higher rate of return than a 10-year Treasury note (at the time, 6.37%). Royalties from the 25 albums generated the cash flow that secured the bonds' interest payments.\\"The Pullman Group -- David Bowie Bonds\\" , fetched 15 March 2009. Prudential also received guarantees from Bowie's label, EMI Records, which had recently signed a $30m deal with Bowie. By forfeiting ten years worth of royalties, Bowie was able to receive a payment of US$55 million up front. Bowie used this income to buy songs owned by his former manager. Bowie's combined catalog of albums covered by this agreement sold more than 1 million copies annually at the time of the agreement. Shortly after launching, however, the rise of MP3 sharing caused music piracy to rise, and music sales to drop, which was one of the factors that led Moody's Investors Service to lower the bonds from an A3 rating (the seventh highest rating) to Baa3, one notch above junk status. The downgrade was prompted by lower-than-expected revenue \\"due to weakness in sales for recorded music\\" and that an unnamed company guaranteed the issue.\\"Bankers Hope For a Reprise Of Bowie Bonds\\" , 23 August 2005. Despite this, the Bowie bonds liquidated in 2007 as originally planned, without default, and the rights to the income from the songs reverted to Bowie.http://ftalphaville.ft.com/2016/01/11/2149761/a-short-history-of-the- bowie-bond/ Other artist rights securitization The Bowie Bond issuance was perhaps the first instance of intellectual property rights securitization, a financial practice of pooling various types of contractual debt such as residential mortgages, commercial mortgages, auto loans or credit card debt obligations and selling said consolidated debt as bonds, pass-through securities, or Collateralized mortgage obligation (CMOs), to various investors. The securitization of the collections of other artists, such as James Brown, Ashford & Simpson and the Isley Brothers, later followed. In 1998, Pullman raised $30 million for Motown songwriting team Holland‚ÄìDozier‚ÄìHolland, whose hits include Baby I Need Your Loving (1964) and Stop in the Name of Love (1965). Pullman then began putting together a package of works of various songwriters to sell them in a single deal rather than pitching the songs of a single artist. In September 1998, Pullman signed musician Jake Hooker (musician) to a celebrity bond. Hooker had co-written the 1982 Joan Jett hit song I Love Rock 'n' Roll. A month later in October, Pullman added to that same bond Duane Hitchings, a songwriter behind popular songs of diverse artists such as Rod Stewart, Tupac Shakur, and Kim Carnes. The 2005 success of Apple's iTunes and other legal online music retailers has led to a renewed interest in celebrity bonds. However, a 2011 offering by Goldman Sachs for SESAC bonds based on, among others, Bob Dylan and Neil Diamond, was delayed and ultimately canceled due to lack of investor interest. More recently, a range of funds have appeared offering investors access to music royalty streams; examples include Kobalt Capital, Round Hill Music, publicly traded Hipgnosis Songs Fund, The Music Fund and Alignment Artist Capital. Efforts of competitors in the small celebrity bond market often move towards overlapping. In the late 1990s, Pullman unsuccessfully sued former business partners, who began engaging in the royalty bond business, for misappropriation of what Pullman believed were his trade secrets in this area. Also, Pullman and competitor Parviz Omidvar have filed at least 11 lawsuits and countersuits against one another related to songwriter clients. Pullman's efforts mostly were towards complex financial deals and Omidvar's efforts have been more akin to a pawnbroker offering secured loans to artists who offer intellectual property collateral, with the unwritten expectation that the commercial note be paid off within weeks. As of 2012, Pullman himself assumes the risk for the stream of future royalties by purchasing royalties outright from artists who are looking to sell instead of packaging them for others to buy.

It is among the few European species in the genus Spermophilus. Like all squirrels, it is a member of the rodent order. It is to be found in eastern Europe from southern Ukraine, to Asia Minor, Austria, the Czech Republic, Slovakia, Serbia, Greece, Romania, Bulgaria, North Macedonia and north as far as Poland but the range is divided in two parts by the Carpathian Mountains. The European ground squirrel grows to a length of approximately and a weight of approximately . It is a diurnal animal, living in colonies of individual burrows in pastures or grassy embankments. The squirrels emerge during the day to feed upon seeds, plant shoots and roots or flightless invertebrates. The colonies maintain sentinels who whistle at the sight of a predator, bringing the pack scurrying back to safety. Breeding takes place in early summer when a single litter of five to eight young is borne. The European ground squirrel hibernates between autumn and March, the length of time depending on the climate. In preparation they will build up reserves of brown fat during the late summer. Description The European ground squirrel is about the size of a brown rat, with an adult measuring and a weight of . It has a slender build with a short bushy tail. The short dense fur is yellowish-grey, tinged with red, with a few indistinct pale and dark spots on the back. The underside is pale with a sandy-coloured abdomen. The large dark eyes are placed high on the head and the small, rounded ears are hidden in the fur. The dental formula is 1/1, 0/0, 2/1, 3/3. The legs are powerful with sharp claws well adapted for digging. Males are slightly larger than females otherwise they look alike. The European ground squirrel has a shrill alarm call that will cause all other individuals in the vicinity to dive for cover. It also makes various soft chirruping and growling noises. The European ground squirrel could be confused with the speckled ground squirrel which occurs in Poland (Lublin Voivodeship), Romania, Russia, Belarus and Ukraine, but that species has dark brown fur spotted with white and a thin tail and lives in areas with coarser vegetation. Distribution and habitat The European ground squirrel is native to central and southeastern Europe where its range is divided by the Carpathian Mountains. Its range includes land at altitudes of up to in southern Ukraine, Asia Minor, Austria, the Czech Republic, Slovakia, Hungary, Greece, Romania, Bulgaria, North Macedonia and north as far as Poland. It has become locally extinct in Germany and Poland but was reintroduced successfully into the wild in Poland in 2005. Some of the animals were sourced from the Budapest Ferenc Liszt International Airport. The European ground squirrel has very specific habitat requirements. It needs short turf in order to dig its tunnel system. It finds this on the steppes and in pasture, in dry banks, on sports fields, parks and lawns. These conditions are lost when changes in agricultural practice convert grassland into arable land and forest, or grazing ceases and the grass grows coarse and scrubland develops. Other places with short vegetation that sometimes provides suitable habitat are railway embankments and road cuttings and verges. Behaviour European ground squirrel whistling European ground squirrel eating the seeds of the denseflower mullein The European ground squirrel is a colonial animal and is mainly diurnal. It excavates a branching system of tunnels up to deep with several entrances. At other places in the home range it digs unbranched bolt holes in which to hide if danger threatens. If alarmed it emits a piercing whistle and when it is out in the open it often sits upright and looks around for predators. These include the weasel, fox, domestic cat and some species of birds of prey. It feeds on grasses, other plants, flowers, seeds, cultivated crops, insects and occasionally the eggs of ground nesting birds or their chicks. A study in Bulgaria found that the squirrel spent about eleven hours a day outside its burrow in mid-summer but by early autumn this has reduced to seven hours. Rather over half of the day was spent foraging but other activities observed included exploration, running, sitting, grooming, digging, scent marking and vigilance. During the winter it stops up the entrances to its burrow and hibernates in a nest of dry vegetation. Each individual occupies a separate chamber and during this period, the body temperature drops to 2.0 ¬∞C (36 ¬∞F), and the heart rate slows to a few beats per minute. During hibernation, the squirrel may wake up briefly for a few days and uses up the fat reserves accumulated during the summer, consuming about 90% of the fat stored in the body. In Bulgaria hibernation lasts from September to March. Breeding After emerging from hibernation in the spring, mating takes place during April or May. The gestation period is about twenty six days and five to eight young are born in a chamber deep in the burrow. They are naked and blind and their eyes open at about 4 weeks old. The female feeds them for six weeks and soon after that they are ready to leave the burrow. They reach maturity the following spring and may live for eight to ten years. Status The European ground squirrel is listed as being endangered by the IUCN in its Red List of Threatened Species. This is because the population trend is downward and it is believed that, over the last ten years, the population has diminished by more than 30%. The southern and the northwestern and northern parts of the range are most seriously affected. The main threats are the conversion of grassland and pasture to cultivated fields or to forestry, and the abandonment of grassland and its reversion to unsuitable tall grass meadows and bushy habitats that do not suit the animal. Urbanization and road building have sometimes fragmented communities and prevented recolonisation of empty sites.

In Singapore schools, these books are known to be used extensively by teachers and students in preparation for similar questions that may be asked in upcoming examinations. Most students review these past examination papers in order to seek to reveal applications of concepts as well as encounter the forms of various new concepts which would be covered in examinations but not explicitly in the syllabus. Critics of the education system claim this phenomenon to be signs of rote learning, that goes against the emphasis for creative thinking by the government. Until 2007, the term is not always truly literal since some of these books have compilations containing papers from more than two decades worth of examinations, which means that students will thus often be doing practice papers that are set even before they were born. SEAB has since implemented a new rule limited the publication of papers to the past ten years, which resulting in a spike of demand for older ten-year series. Ten-year series should not be confused with assessment books (books containing questions on specific subjects for students to practise), which serve as an additional practice, or as a form of enrichment. The latter are privately authored and sold in bookstores.

Bouchez appears in the opening credit sequence during the first half of the fifth season; beginning with \\"S.O.S.\\" Bouchez and her character were removed from the opening and listed as a special guest star. Character biography Rienne is number eight on the CIA's most wanted list. She worked secretly with Michael Vaughn for seven years. When she first approached Vaughn, she told him that his father Bill worked with her father on a project: Prophet Five. Renee has been responsible for numerous crimes, including the assassination of a Turkish interior minister, the deaths of three CIA agents in Serbia, an attack on a CIA listening post in Turkey, the theft of a cryogenic container from the Department of Special Research, and the infiltration of a US Army facility in Frankfurt, Germany. In \\"Out of the Box\\" some details of her past are revealed. She was frequently ill as a child. Her father, Luc Goursaud, was a test subject of Prophet Five until learning something which frightened him. He took Rienne and fled, but was later taken from Rienne as she watched from hiding. She swore to take revenge on Prophet Five. Many years later, Rienne stole a cryogenic container believing it contained her father. When opened, it instead disgorged Prophet Five researcher Doctor Aldo Desantis, who had worked with Ren√©e's father. Desantis has been transformed, possibly by Project Helix technology, into a duplicate of Luc Goursaud. Sydney exposed him as an impostor and Desantis was extracted by Gordon Dean. Rienne continued to work unofficially with APO. In the episode \\"The Horizon\\", she assisted Jack Bristow (albeit unsuccessfully) in trying to rescue Sydney from her Prophet Five kidnappers. During this mission, she executed Desantis, who was involved in the kidnapping, on the orders of Jack. In the episode \\"Maternal Instinct\\", she worked with Marcus Dixon to obtain information regarding a classified SD-6 mission. In the episode \\"30 Seconds\\", Sydney offered her a position at APO, but Ren√©e refused because she preferred to work according to her own schedule and she trusted very few people. She is later killed by Anna Espinosa, who altered her appearance and was posing as Sydney Bristow. A subsequent autopsy of Ren√©e recovered an incomplete microchip, hidden in her body for at least thirty years. It was marked with the name \\"Andre Micheaux\\", Vaughn's real name. The other half, hidden inside Vaughn, was marked \\"Ren√©e Goursaud\\", Ren√©e Rienne's real name. The completed microchip revealed the location of a nuclear fallout shelter containing research on Prophet Five compiled by Bill Vaughn and Luc Goursaud.

Nicknamed \\"Jumping Joe\\", he was considered one of the best defensive third basemen of his era. He played in Major League Baseball as a shortstop and third baseman from 1917 through 1931, most notably for the Philadelphia Athletics and the New York Yankees, with whom he played in five World Series. Baseball career Born in Mahanoy City, Pennsylvania, and later attending Hillhouse High School in New Haven, Connecticut, Dugan went directly from the College of the Holy Cross to the major leagues. He made his major league debut at the age of 20 with Connie Mack's Philadelphia Athletics on July 5, 1917. Dugan struggled as a hitter his first two years, batting a combined .195, but in 1919 he batted .271, then the next year hit .322. By , Dugan was being cited as the best third baseman in the major leagues. He was moved permanently to third base in 1921, and would be a steady .280-.300 hitter as well as a fine defensive third baseman for the rest of his career. It was in his first years in baseball that Dugan acquired the nickname of \\"Jumping\\", a nickname bestowed on him since he would often take unauthorized leaves from the team. After committing a few errors, he was booed by the Philadelphia fans. Sensitive and temperamental, he would leave the team until Mack was able to coax him back. Word of his departure spread around the league and, he would often be taunted by fans with the cry, \\"I want to go home!\\" In 1922, Dugan was traded by the Athletics to the Boston Red Sox. On July 23, 1922 he was sent by the Red Sox to the New York Yankees in a controversial deal. Red Sox owner Harry Frazee had been unloading his Red Sox players almost haphazardly, and Dugan's acquisition by the Yankees helped them edge out the St. Louis Browns in a tight pennant race. Because Dugan's trade occurred in the latter part of the season, and worried that teams might try to buy their way to a pennant during the season, major league baseball would later move up its trading deadline to June 15. Dugan had his most productive season in 1923, when he hit .283, scored 111 runs and led the league's third basemen in fielding percentage to help the Yankees win their first world championship. In a United Press International article, Dugan was proclaimed the hero of the 1923 World Series for his spectacular defensive performance as well as his timely hitting, which produced five runs batted in. Dugan posted a .302 batting average in 1924 and, in a year-end poll of major league baseball players, he was a near-unanimous selection as the best third baseman in the American League. Yankees manager Miller Huggins named Dugan as his leadoff hitter at the beginning of the 1925 season. In August, he suffered a severely wrenched knee and had to miss the rest of the season. He posted a .292 batting average for the season and once again led American League third basemen in fielding percentage. Dugan was the starting third baseman on the 1927 Yankees, a team considered by many the greatest baseball team of all time, although by this time Dugan was past his prime as injuries began to take their toll. In August 1928, Huggins replaced Dugan at third base with Mike Gazella in an effort to get more offense from the lineup. After appearing in 94 games, the Yankees gave Dugan his unconditional release in December of that year. He signed a contract to play for the Boston Braves in 1929 and finished the season with a .304 batting average in 60 games. Dugan did not play in but returned to play for the Detroit Tigers as a utility player in 1931. At the age of 34, he appeared in eight games before being released on May 29. Career statistics In a 14-year major league career, Dugan played in 1,447 games, accumulating 1,516 hits in 5,410 at bats for a .280 career batting average along with 42 home runs, 567 runs batted in and a .317 on-base percentage. He finished his career with a .957 fielding percentage as a third baseman. Dugan played in five World Series with the Yankees, playing in 25 series games and batting .267 (24-for-90). After his playing career, Dugan briefly managed in the minor leagues. He died in Norwood, Massachusetts, at age 85.

When grown for sufficient long time in cell culture, A549 cells may begin to differentiate, as signaled by the presence of multilamellar bodies. Usage A549 cells have served as models of alveolar Type II pulmonary epithelium, finding utility in research examining the metabolic processing of lung tissue and possible mechanisms of drug delivery to the tissue. In context of lung cancer drug development, the cells have served as testing grounds for novel drugs - such as paclitaxel, docetaxel, and bevacizumab - both in vitro and in vivo through cell culture and xenografting, respectively. Single-cell tracking of A549 has enabled to elaborate pedigree-tree profiles and demonstrate correlations in behavior among sister cells. Such observations of correlations can be used as proxy measurements to identify cellular stress and inheritance as a response to drug treatment. A549 has also been employed in viral research and associated protein expression changes as a consequence of viral infection. Although A549 is a cancer cell line, it has also been studied for its response to tuberculosis, specifically the production of chemokines as it is induced by the invading bacteria.

The Facing Identification Mark, or FIM, is a bar code designed by the United States Postal Service to assist in the automated processing of mail. The FIM is a set of vertical bars printed on the envelope or postcard near the upper edge, just to the left of the postage area (the area where the postage stamp or its equivalent is placed). The FIM is intended for use primarily on preprinted envelopes and postcards and is applied by the company printing the envelopes or postcards, not by the USPS. The FIM is a nine-bit code consisting of ones (vertical bars) and zeroes (blank spaces). The following five codes are in use: *FIM A: \`  \` (110010011) *FIM B: \`   \` (101101101) *FIM C: \`   \` (110101011) *FIM D: \`  \` (111010111) *FIM E: \`   \` (101000101) All defined FIMs start and end with a bar, and are palindromic, reading the same forward and backward. Thus, there are only 16 possible FIMs, 11 if the current limits of at most 3 consecutive bars or spaces are maintained. The FIM serves the following purposes: it allows the proper facing of mail for cancellation. It also identifies the manner in which postage is paid (e.g., business reply mail or Information Based Indicia (IBI) postage) and whether that business reply mail has a POSTNET bar code. If the POSTNET bar code is present, the mail can be sent directly to a barcode sorter. The five codes have the following uses: *FIM A is used for mail bearing regular postage and a POSTNET bar code. It is commonly used by preprinted courtesy reply mail and metered reply mail, but may be applied to any mail to speed delivery. *FIM B is used for business reply mail without a preprinted ZIP+4 bar code. Because this costs more than barcoded mail, it is rarely used. *FIM C is used for business reply mail with a preprinted POSTNET bar code. *FIM D is used only with IBI postage. *FIM E is used to mark customized mail bearing an Intelligent Mail Barcode.

They were originated by John Ambrose Fleming, in the late 19th century, as a simple way of working out the direction of motion in an electric motor, or the direction of electric current in an electric generator. When current flows through a conducting wire, and an external magnetic field is applied across that flow, the conducting wire experiences a force perpendicular both to that field and to the direction of the current flow (i.e they are mutually perpendicular). A left hand can be held, as shown in the illustration, so as to represent three mutually orthogonal axes on the thumb, fore finger and middle finger. Each finger is then assigned to a quantity (mechanical force, magnetic field and electric current). The right and left hand are used for generators and motors respectively. Conventions * The direction of the mechanical force is the literal one. * The direction of the magnetic field is from north to south. * The direction of the electric current is that of conventional current: from positive to negative. =First variant= * The Thumb represents the direction of the Thrust on the conductor / Motion of the Conductor * The Fore finger represents the direction of the magnetic Field * The Centre finger represents the direction of the Current. =Second variant= * The Thumb represents the direction of Motion resulting from the force on the conductor * The First finger represents the direction of the magnetic Field * The Second finger represents the direction of the Current. =Third variant= Van de Graaff's translation of Fleming's rules is the FBI rule, easily remembered because these are the initials of the Federal Bureau of Investigation. =Fourth variant (FBI)= * The F (Thumb) represents the direction of Force of the conductor * The B (Forefinger) represents the direction of the Magnetic field * The I (Centre finger) represents the direction of the Current. This uses the conventional symbolic parameters of F (for Lorentz force), B (for magnetic flux density) and I (for electric current), and attributing them in that order (FBI) respectively to the thumb, first finger and second finger. * The thumb is the force, F * The first finger is the magnetic flux density, B * The second finger is the electric current, I. Of course, if the mnemonic is taught (and remembered) with a different arrangement of the parameters to the fingers, it could end up as a mnemonic that also reverses the roles of the two hands (instead of the standard left hand for motors, right hand for generators). These variants are catalogued more fully on the FBI mnemonics page. = Fifth variant (Fire the field, feel the force and kill the current) = This approach to remembering which finger represents which quantity uses some actions. First of all you need to point your fingers like a pretend gun, with the index finger acting as the barrel of the gun and the thumb acting as the hammer. Then go through the following actions: * \\"Fire the field\\" out through your index finger * \\"Feel the force\\" of the gun recoil up through your thumb * Finally you display your middle finger as you \\"kill the current\\" Distinction between the right-hand and left-hand rule 300px Fleming's left-hand rule is used for electric motors, while Fleming's right-hand rule is used for electric generators. Different hands need to be used for motors and generators because of the differences between cause and effect. In an electric motor, the electric current and magnetic field exist (which are the causes), and they lead to the force that creates the motion (which is the effect), and so the left-hand rule is used. In an electric generator, the motion and magnetic field exist (causes), and they lead to the creation of the electric current (effect), and so the right- hand rule is used. To illustrate why, consider that many types of electric motors can also be used as electric generators. A vehicle powered by such a motor can be accelerated up to high speed by connecting the motor to a fully charged battery. If the motor is then disconnected from the fully charged battery, and connected instead to a completely flat battery, the vehicle will decelerate. The motor will act as a generator and convert the vehicle's kinetic energy back to electrical energy, which is then stored in the battery. Since neither the direction of motion nor the direction of the magnetic field (inside the motor/generator) has changed, the direction of the electric current in the motor/generator has reversed. This follows from the second law of thermodynamics (the generator current must oppose the motor current, and the stronger current outweighs the other to allow the energy to flow from the more energetic source to the less energetic source). The rule for motors can be recalled by remembering that \\"motors drive on the left in Britain\\". The rule for generators can be recalled by remembering that either the letters \\"g\\" and \\"r\\" is common to both \\"right\\" and \\"generator\\", or the phrase \\"Jenny is always right\\" (\\"genny\\" being a shortened version of generator). Physical basis for the rules Prediction of direction of flux density (B), given that the current I flows in the direction of the thumb. When electrons, or any charged particles, flow in the same direction (for example, as an electric current in an electrical conductor, such as a metal wire) they generate a cylindrical magnetic field that wraps round the conductor (as discovered by Hans Christian √òrsted). The direction of the induced magnetic field can be remembered by Maxwell's corkscrew rule. That is, if the conventional current is flowing away from the viewer, the magnetic field runs clockwise round the conductor, in the same direction that a corkscrew would have to turn in order to move away from the viewer. The direction of the induced magnetic field is also sometimes remembered by the right-hand grip rule, as depicted in the illustration, with the thumb showing the direction of the conventional current, and the fingers showing the direction of the magnetic field. The existence of this magnetic field can be confirmed by placing magnetic compasses at various points round the periphery of an electrical conductor that is carrying a relatively large electric current. The thumb shows the direction of motion and the index finger shows the field lines and the middle finger shows the direction of induced current. If an external magnetic field is applied horizontally, so that it crosses the flow of electrons (in the wire conductor, or in the electron beam), the two magnetic fields will interact. Michael Faraday introduced a visual analogy for this, in the form of imaginary magnetic lines of force: those in the conductor form concentric circles round the conductor; those in the externally applied magnetic field run in parallel lines. If those on one side of the conductor are running (from the north to south magnetic pole) in the opposite direction to those surrounding the conductor, they will be deflected so that they pass on the other side the conductor (because magnetic lines of force cannot cross or run contrary to each other). Consequently, there will be a large number of magnetic field lines in a small space on that side of the conductor, and a dearth of them on the original side of the conductor. Since the magnetic field lines of force are no longer straight lines, but curved to run around the electrical conductor, they are under tension (like stretched elastic bands), with energy bound up in the magnetic field. Since this energetic field is now mostly unopposed, its build-up or expulsion in one direction creates ‚Äî in a manner analogous to Newton's third law of motion ‚Äî a force in the opposite direction. Since there is only one moveable object in this system (the electrical conductor) for this force to work upon, the net effect is a physical force working to expel the electrical conductor out of the externally applied magnetic field in the direction opposite to that which the magnetic flux is being redirected to ‚Äî in this case (motors), if the conductor is carrying conventional current upwards, and the external magnetic field is moving away from the viewer, the physical force will work to push the conductor to the left. This is the reason for torque in an electric motor. (The electric motor is then constructed so that the expulsion of the conductor out of the magnetic field causes it be placed inside the next magnetic field, and for this switching to be continued indefinitely.) Faraday's law: the induced electromotive force in a conductor is directly proportional to the rate of change of the magnetic flux in the conductor.

The aim of the initiative is to encourage people to change from cars to buses and thus reduce traffic congestion. The strategy requires close co-ordination between the local authorities, who are responsible for the road changes required, and Dublin Bus who operate the vast majority of bus services. This co-ordination is managed by the National Transport Authority. The idea for the creation of QBCs first arose back in 1993 when Dublin Bus launched its \\"CitySwift\\" service on route 39 to Clonsilla along the Navan Road. This became part of the eventual Blanchardstown QBC some years later. There are currently sixteen QBCs in Dublin. A 2007 survey by the former Dublin Transportation Office found that bus average journey times in the morning peak were less than the corresponding car average journey times in twelve out of the sixteen QBCs monitored, with it being twice as fast in some cases.Dublin Transportation Office - November 2007 Quality Bus Corridor Monitoring Report The sixteen Quality Bus Corridors are as follows: * Ballymun QBC * Blanchardstown QBC * Bray QBC * Clontarf QBC * Crumlin Road QBC * Finglas QBC * Howth Road QBC * Lucan QBC * Malahide QBC * North Clondalkin QBC * Rathfarnham QBC * Rock Road QBC * South Clondalkin QBC * Stillorgan QBC * Swords QBC * Tallaght QBC According to the Dublin Transportation Office (now part of the National Transport Authority (Ireland)), the number of cars entering Dublin's inner city at the canal cordon points reduced by 7849 (21.43%) from November 1997 to November 2004. Conversely the number of bus passengers entering the inner city increased by 15016 (49.17%) during the same period. However between 2003 and 2004 there was a reduction in bus passengers entering the inner city of 7.10%. In part this may be attributable to the introduction of the Luas system, but an increase in car traffic of 5.74% was also noted. The effectiveness of the QBCs are compromised at various pinch points along the routes. In particular, the routing of the majority of buses on the Lucan routes through Lucan and Chapelizod villages at peak mean that time savings can be frittered away on narrow congested streets filled with school traffic. In November 2012, three QBCs (Swords, Blanchardstown and Tallaght) were designated for a potential upgrade to bus rapid transit status under the name Swiftway. Public consultation on this matter was carried out during February and March 2014. However, this project didn't not progress past this stage. Instead of providing a bus rapid transit service on just 3 QBCs, it was decided that all 16 QBCs would be upgrades to CBCs or Core Bus Corridors and all 16 would be given bus priority for their entire length through bus lanes, bus gates and other priority measure. On 29 May 2017, a new BusConnects plan was launched, with ‚Ç¨1 billion being spent over a ten-year period. It involves the implementation of the above mentioned bus rapid transit system, as well as next generation bus corridors, a redesign of the bus route network and a state-of-the-art, cashless ticketing system.National Transport Authority Bus Rapid Transit Core Network Report Planning permission will be submitted to An Bord Plean√°la in 2020.

That shot is referred to as the \\"Shot heard 'round Arkansas\\".Tom Friend, \\"N.C.A.A. Tournament: With All His Rainbows, Thurman's A Rainmaker\\", The New York Times, March 28, 1995 Thurman was named to the SEC All-Freshman Team in 1993, and was First Team All-SEC in 1994 and 1995. He also received some All-American recognition from the Associated Press and the Basketball Times in 1994 and 1995. Most Razorback fans consider him to be one of the greatest players in school history. His nickname was the \\"Ruston Rifle\\", making reference to Thurman's hometown, and his shooting prowess. After leading Arkansas to the National Championship game in 1995, Thurman, along with teammate and future NBA player Corliss Williamson, left college early to make himself available for the 1995 NBA Draft. His agent and coach had told him that he would be a first round pick, and many fans and analysts agreed with this; surprisingly, he was not drafted. Bomani Jones, \\"Enter at your own risk\\", ESPN, May 4, 2007 He tried out unsuccessfully with the New Jersey Nets before settling with the CBA's Shreveport Storm (now defunct) in 1995-96. While not making the NBA, Thurman played basketball in foreign countries including Cyprus, Greece, Lebanon and Macedonia, and played for the ABA's professional Arkansas RimRockers in their inaugural season. In 2005, Thurman was with Fastlink of the Jordanian basketball league. Prior to that, he was signed with Riyadi Beirut of the Lebanese league. He is considered the best foreign player of all time in the Macedonian Basketball League. Thurman continued playing professional basketball, but also developed a business career with Russ Phillips. He was the director of real estate for Cypress Properties, Inc., in Little Rock. Thurman was named the Director of Student- Athlete Development for men's basketball at the University of Arkansas, and was also the color analyst for the radio broadcasts of Razorback games. In April 2016, Thurman was named an assistant head coach for the Razorbacks by head coach Mike Anderson. Anderson was fired by the university after the 2018-19 season, and Thurman was not retained by the new head coach, Eric Musselman.

The preputial glands of female animals are sometimes called clitoral glands. The preputial glands of male musk deer produce strong-smelling deer musk which is of economic importance, as it is used in perfumes. Human homologues There is debate about whether humans have functional homologues to preputial glands. Preputial glands were first noted by Edward Tyson and in 1694 fully described by William Cowper who named them Tyson's glands after Tyson. They are described as modified sebaceous glands located around the corona and inner surface of the prepuce of the human penis. They are believed to be most frequently found in the balanopreputial sulcus. Their secretion may be one of the components of smegma. Some, including Satya Parkash, dispute their existence. While humans may not have true anatomical equivalents, the term may sometimes be used for tiny whitish yellow bumps occasionally found on the corona of the glans penis. The proper name for these structures is pearly penile papules (or hirsutoid papillomas). According to detractors, they are not glands, but mere thickenings of the skin and are not involved in the formation of smegma.

Blending fact and fiction, ethnographic observation, archival history, literary theory and memoir. Professor Carl Rhodes defines fictocriticism as \\"a writing engaged in genre-bending as a literary and theoretical engagement with existence and selfhood.\\" It is a new sub-categorization and therefore still being defined and redefined. The tradition of division among the practices of fiction, theory and criticism into single narrative stories, essays and critiques tend to merge in fictocriticism which combines elements into a single text. These texts thus often tell a story while making an argument. They range from avant- garde prose poetry to discursive meta-fictional inventions. Once Jacques Derrida asked for a name: > We must invent a name for those \\"critical\\" inventions which belong to > literature while deforming its limits. The name one could have given him was fictocriticism, but he went on anyway to write, and perform, critically, and sometimes fictionally, for instance by telling stories while making his philosophical arguments. Fictocriticism might trace its origins to Montaigne, continuing through Barthes and making a different appearance in the New Journalism of Tom Wolfe or Joan Didion. Tending towards the laid-back narrative, the inclusion of the local and singular; the embrace of contemporary culture and media, the name, and the style, have been adopted enthusiastically in Australia and Canada. Fictocriticism may also take alternative forms, such as art work. Artists such as Patricia Piccinini has been described as operating in a fictocritical dialogue, creating fictional futuristic creatures and companion species of a possible future. A prominent practitioner of fictocriticism today is Professor Michael Taussig, an Australian currently working in the Anthropology Department at Columbia University, who lectures on the subject of fictocriticism extensively.

She is remembered mainly as a co-founder and an early Mistress of Girton College, Cambridge University, which was the first university college in England to educate women. Life Davies was born in Carlton Crescent, Southampton, England to an evangelical clergyman and a teacher, (NOTE: her birth date is incorrect here.) although she spent most of her youth in Gateshead, where her father, John D. Davies, was Rector.The Feminist Companion to Literature in English, ed. Virginia Blain, Patricia Clements and Isobel Grundy (London: Batsford, 1990), p. 269. Davies had been tempted to train in medicine. She wrote the article \\"Female Physicians\\" for the feminist English Woman's Journal in May 1860, and \\"Medicine as a Profession for Women\\" in 1862. Furthermore, she \\"greatly encouraged\\" her friend Elizabeth Garrett in her medical studies. Women's rights After the death of her father, Davies moved in 1862 to London, where she edited the English Woman's Journal and became friends with the women's rights advocates Barbara Bodichon, Elizabeth Garrett Anderson and her younger sister Millicent Fawcett. Davies became a founding member of a women's discussion group, the Kensington Society, along with Elizabeth Garrett Anderson, Barbara Bodichon, Dorothea Beale and Frances Mary Buss, who together unsuccessfully petitioned Parliament to grant women voting rights. Davies began campaigning for women's rights to education and to degrees and teaching qualifications. She was active on the London School Board and in the Schools Inquiry Commission and instrumental in obtaining the admission of girls to official secondary-school examinations. Davies went on to advocate the admission of women to the Universities of London, Oxford and Cambridge. These, like all universities at the time, these were exclusively male domains.Biography. Retrieved 21 April 2019. Davies also became involved in the suffrage movement, which centred on a woman's right to vote. She was involved in organising for John Stuart Mill's 1866 petition to the British Parliament), which was signed by Paulina Irby, Elizabeth Garrett Anderson and 15,000 others, and the first to press for women's suffrage. That same year she wrote the book entitled The Higher Education of Women. Girton College In 1869, Davies led the campaign to found Britain's first women's college,Girton College Register, 1869‚Äì1946: Cambridge; CUP; 1948. with the support of Frances Buss, Dorothea Beale and Barbara Bodichon. Girton College was initially located in Hitchin, Hertfordshire, with Charlotte Manning as the first Mistress. The college then moved in 1873 to the outskirts of Cambridge. Davies strongly advocated a quality of curriculum equivalent to those offered to men of the time. Despite the Senate rejecting her proposal to let women officially sit for the papers, Davies continued to train students for the Cambridge Tripos exams on an unofficial basis. Davies served as Mistress of the College in 1873‚Äì1875. In 1877, Caroline Croom Robertson joined the management team as secretary to reduce the load on Emily Davies. The College (and the test of Cambridge University) would only begin to grant full Cambridge University degrees to women in 1940. Davies persistent fight for equal education for women was instrumental also in the founding in 1875 of Newnham College, which would be led by Anne Jemima Clough. In June 1901, Davies received an honorary Doctor of Laws (DLL) from the University of Glasgow. Davies also continued her suffrage work. In 1906, she headed a delegation to Parliament. She was known for opposing the militant and violent methods used by the Suffragette part of the women's suffrage movement, led by the Pankhursts. In 1910, Davies published Thoughts on Some Questions Relating to Women (). Emily Davies died in Hampstead, London, on 13 July 1921. Quotes Recognition In 2016, the Council of the University of Cambridge approved the use of Davies's name to mark a physical feature within the North West Cambridge Development. On 30 June 2019, a Blue Plaque jointly commemorating founders Emily Davies and Barbara Bodichon was unveiled at Girton College, Cambridge by Baroness Hale, President of the Supreme Court, and a graduate of Girton, as part of the college's 150th anniversary celebrations.

The pilot sat forward of the hopper over the wing leading edge, a position which gave a good field of view compared with the American practice of placing the pilot behind the hopper, though this view was somewhat restricted by the extensive canopy joinery and bulky rear decking. The Agricola's handling was generally described favourably, particularly its slow speed performance and controls, while its rugged and simple construction allowed for easy maintenance and repair. The aircraft was utilitarian rather than attractive; one website has short-listed the Agricola in a competition for the ugliest aircraft of all time. The type was first flown in 1955. It was out-competed in its target market by the PAC Fletcher and attempts to sell the type for Aerial application work in Britain, Australia and Europe met with little success. Only nine were made before production ceased. Of these ZK-BXO, is the sole survivor. Restored by John Stephenson of Whitianga, it was operated for many years by him as both a historic aircraft and personal transport. BXO was sold to the UK in 2005 and re-registered as G-CBOA. In March 2016, the aircraft was once again sold to New Zealand.

QFP's were invented by Eiichi Goto at the University of Tokyo as an improvement over his earlier parametron based digital logic technology, which did not use superconductivity effects or Josephson junctions. The Josephson junctions on QFP integrated circuits to improve speed and energy efficiency enormously over the parametrons. In some applications, the complexity of the cryogenic cooling system required is negligible compared to the potential speed gains. While his design makes use of quantum principles, it is not a quantum computer technology, gaining speed only through higher clock speeds. Apart from the speed advantage over traditional CMOS integrated circuit design is that parametrons can be operated with zero energy loss (no local increase in entropy), making reversible computing possible. Low energy use and heat generation is critical in supercomputer design, where thermal load per unit volume has become one of the main limiting factors. A related technology is the Rapid Single Flux Quantum digital logic.

The Redneck Games were held in East Dublin, Georgia, annually from 1996 until 2012. The games were started by Mac Davis, a local person who was the general manager of radio station WQZY-FM \\"Y96\\". Some American media reacted to the news that Atlanta had won the bid to host the 1996 Olympic Games by saying the event would be organized by a group of rednecks. The games were created to help children's needs. Around 5,000 people turned out for the first Redneck Summer Games ‚Äì over twice the population of East Dublin. Events include Mud Pit Belly Flop, Bobbin' for Pig's Feet, Redneck Horseshoes, Hubcap Hurl and the Armpit Serenade. The games received coverage from Good Morning America, Life, Maxim, MTV Road Rules/Real World Challenge, The Tonight Show, ABC, NBC, CBS, BBC, and Fox. Due to declining revenue and attendance, the Redneck Games were canceled in 2013. The site of the games, Buckeye Park, was under scrutiny from the Georgia Environmental Protection Division for bacterial contamination of a nearby creek and the Oconee River, but city officials asserted that the games' cancellation was not for this reason. Events Some events that were held during the Redneck Games included: *The cigarette flip *Bobbing for pig's feet *Seed spitting *Toilet seat throwing *Mud pit belly flop *Big-hair contest *Wet T-shirt contest *Armpit serenade *Bug zapping by spitball *Dumpster diving *Hubcap hurling For each of the events, a trophy is awarded; a half crushed, empty mounted beer can. Redneck Games elsewhere In 2001, Drew Scott of Wild Country 96.5 \\"borrowed\\" the games to set up a fundraising event for the Franklin County NY Make-A-Wish Foundation.

Name The name \\"Kapu≈°any\\" is probably derived from the Hungarian word kapu, meaning \\"gate\\". History  The territory of the town has been settled since time immemorial (findings from the Neolithic period). From the second half of the 10th century until 1918, it was part of the Kingdom of Hungary. The first written references to the settlement stems from 1211 (\\"Kapos\\") and 1214 (\\"Copus\\"). The settlement was awarded town status in 1430. The town was the second largest settlement (after Uzhhorod) of the Ung County and frequently served as a temporary or permanent station for migrants (Germans, Rusyns, Poles, Hungarians etc.) from the east to the west. In the town square there is a garden with a plaque commemorating the day the Germans marched into Veƒæk√© Kapu≈°any in 1944. This is significant as both Jews and Romas were persecuted and murdered by the Nazis during World War II. At that time, Veƒæk√© Kapu≈°any was part of Hungary (based on the First Vienna Award). The following villages were merged with the town: Mal√© Kapu≈°any (after 1913), Ve≈°kovce (1964). City parts *Veƒæk√© Kapu≈°any proper *Ve≈°kovce Characteristics Wood processing, food and building materials industries and Slovak and Hungarian high schools are located there as is a railroad transfer facility for goods on the broad gauge railroad to Ukraine. Many Communist remnants remain, notably the apartment buildings of the Communist era, where mainly poor Roma people now live. The rest of the population lives in mostly comfortable-looking homes and farms outside of the main thoroughfare but still within the town's borders. There are several churches, but no synagogue in Veƒæk√© Kapu≈°any. On the outskirts of the town there is a heavily damaged Jewish cemetery.

They are based on the Jack Kirby character of the same name. Publication history The OMACs first appeared in The OMAC Project #1 (June 2005) and were created by Greg Rucka. Fictional team biography =The OMAC Project= The OMACs are cyborgs, human bodies transformed by a virus into living machines to assassinate any and all beings with superpowers. The virus was created from Brainiac-13's nanotechnology, which had been acquired by the U.S. Department of Defense and Lexcorp, and was then secretly introduced into general vaccine supplies. The OMACs are featured in the mini- series The OMAC Project that leads up to the Infinite Crisis series. Brother MK I The new OMACs are controlled by the Brother MK I satellite. Brother MK I was created by Batman and programmed by Pseudopersons, Inc., scientist Buddy Blank, who in this retelling of the story is a partner of Wayne Industries. Its sole purpose was to gather data on all metahumans, both villain and hero. Batman had grown distrustful of metahumans after discovering that the Justice League altered his memories following an altercation with Doctor Light in Identity Crisis. Alexander Luthor Jr. later gave the satellite sentience as part of his plans. Maxwell Lord, recently promoted to the top rank of Checkmate, subverted the original mission of the Brother MK I satellite by inculcating a fear and suspicion of all metahumans. The first OMAC test subject was renamed \\"Buddy Blank\\", after the scientist who programmed the satellite. The OMACs' history may be more recent than Brother MK I's itself. Equus and Pilate, formerly featured in Superman: For Tomorrow, are later denounced as former iterations of the OMAC concept. In JLA: Classified an all mechanical OMAC is an enemy of the Metal Men. Since then, the design has improved to the current form, with little to no changes to the base model. Brother Eye When Maxwell Lord brainwashed Superman to kill Batman, Wonder Woman broke Lord's neck to free Superman from his control. Because Lord proffered this solution while held by her Lasso of Truth, Diana believed this was the only course of action possible; she was fiercely criticized from many quarters. Brother MK I, rechristening itself Brother Eye, initiated the \\"KingIsDead\\" protocol. Specifically designed to be used in the event of Lord's death, it ordered all of the OMACs (all 1,373,462 of them) to attack and kill all the metahumans on Earth and destroy Checkmate. A group superhero effort stopped the attack, using an EMP blast as well as a \\"Shut Down\\" command given by Sasha Bordeaux, who had become a third-generation cyborg linked to Brother Eye, now designated Blacknight 1. These measures effectively freed the majority of the OMAC hosts from their nanotech forms and reduced the number of OMACs to roughly 200,000. =Infinite Crisis= Truth and Justice In response, the satellite broadcast footage of Wonder Woman executing Maxwell Lord, preceded by the word MURDER, to media outlets all over the world, destroying her reputation. After this, Brother Eye initiated the final protocol, \\"Truth and Justice\\", by having all the remaining OMACs invade and attack her homeland, Themyscira, to wipe out all of the Amazons. It was revealed that Alexander Luthor Jr. was the one who wrested control of Brother Eye away from Batman. He used it to program his multiverse tuning fork and redirect its energy to where he needed it as part of his attempt to re-create Earth-Two, and in turn, a perfect Earth. Brother Eye continues to aid Alex Luthor by remapping out the multiverse and helping to guard the tuning fork with its OMACs, reasoning that it would eliminate the need for heroes like those who Batman had created it to monitor by aiding in the creation of a perfect Earth. thumb Downfall of Brother Eye Batman leads a collection of superheroes, consisting of: Hal Jordan, John Stewart, Green Arrow (only because Batman is attempting to trust people again and contacted him to see if he would come), Mister Terrific, Black Lightning, Black Canary, the new Blue Beetle, Metamorpho, Booster Gold and Sasha Bordeaux, to Earth's orbit using Intel from Booster Gold and Ted Kord's spaceship. Blue Beetle's scarab allows him to find and reveal Brother Eye's hidden location above Earth by negating its vibrational frequency. Brother Eye sends the OMACs and the two groups clash. With the two Green Lanterns fighting off most of the OMACs and Brother Eye's defenses, the heroes' ship crashes into Brother Eye. Metamorpho provides an oxygen supply as Blue Beetle and Booster Gold stay with the ship to guard it, but Blue Beetle later assists in the destruction of the device that Brother Eye used to hide in orbit and the rescuing of some of the other heroes. Batman goes to distract Brother Eye by shutting off the central computer, although Brother Eye tries to distract him by showing him Nightwing's confrontation with Superboy-Prime. Sasha, linked to Oracle, goes to upload every computer virus on Earth into Brother Eye's system as well as trying to prevent the artificial gravity from shutting down. Black Canary goes to the surveillance room to use her sonic scream to blind the Eye. Black Lightning and Mr. Terrific go to the memory banks so that Black Lightning fries as much circuitry as possible while Mr. Terrific, invisible to machines and electronics, delivers the fatal blow by knocking Brother Eye off orbit using its orbital thrusters. The plan works, and Brother Eye is deactivated. All of the remaining activated OMACs shut down, releasing their hosts. As all of the other heroes evacuate Brother Eye as it begins falling out of orbit to Earth, falling apart in the process, it tries to take Batman down with it, telling him he can never trust the costumed heroes again after what they did to him. Batman, however, says he will take his chances, and accepts Hal Jordan's aid in getting to safety. After crash-landing in Saudi Arabia, Brother Eye tries to download its system into Sasha as a means of self-preservation. However, Sasha manages to destroy the satellite, freeing herself from the nanobots infecting her. =DCU: A Brave New World= On June 28, 2006, DC released DCU: A Brave New World, which was the epilogue to the OMAC limited series. Brother Eye has not been fully decommissioned and lies in a NORAD facility. Michael Costner is the last OMAC unit, kept as emergency backup, and Brother Eye calls to him. This Brother Eye has corrupted programming and now believes all humans need to be subjugated and/or exterminated, whether metahuman or not. It has also recently begun to manifest disassociative behavior with at least two \\"personalities\\" now being heard in the OMAC's internal conversations. =OMAC limited series (2006)= The 2006 OMAC limited series (not to be confused with the 2005 OMAC Project limited series) follows \\"the last OMAC\\" Michael Costner. Brother Eye attempts to make Costner rebuild itself, but is forced to face his wrath when Costner regains control of both his forms, human and OMAC, and subsequently destroys Brother Eye again; although a tiny fraction of it is still active. =Countdown to Final Crisis= A portion of Brother Eye was later retrieved and rebuilt by Buddy Blank, a former scientist from Wayne Industries. This portion meets with the time-traveling Karate Kid who is seeking a cure for the Morticoccus, a 31st-century illness that had evolved from the OMAC virus. Announcing that \\"the Great Disaster has come to me\\", Brother Eye directs him to Bl√ºdhaven. Soon after, it reactivates its offensive protocols and assimilates the hangar it is being held in, turning the people within the hangar into new OMAC cyborgs. It then travels to the ruins of Bl√ºdhaven and assimilates the city's infrastructure and the people within it using the Atomic Knights and Firestorm as power sources. Later, it activates a Boom Tube and travels to Apokolips, where it assimilates the entire planet and attempts to obtain the Morticoccus virus from Karate Kid, who has also been led there. However, it is forced to flee Apokolips when attacked by the Pied Piper using the Anti-Life Equation. Later, Brother Eye transforms Buddy Blank into a modified OMAC resembling Kirby's version of the character. Buddy uses this power to save himself and his grandson from starvation in the Command-D bunker beneath Bl√ºdhaven. Brother Eye implies that it will contact Buddy again for a future need. =Batman and the Outsiders= Batman and the Outsiders. A modified OMAC is shown as a part of the new Outsiders team in the 2008 Batman and the Outsiders series. When a team from the Justice League attempts to seize a partially active OMAC, a leftover from The OMAC Project events, Batman takes the opportunity to reclaim it for himself‚Äîhaving Dr. Francine Langstrom (the long- suffering wife of Dr. Kirk Langstrom) create a clever forgery to leave in care of the League. The OMAC, aptly renamed ReMAC, appears to be \\"an iPod with its tracklist wiped\\". Dr. Langstrom is unable to discern who ReMAC was before being infected by the OMAC virus; finding ReMAC a mere husk, devoid of any personal identity. This complete lack of personality makes ReMAC the perfect infiltrator, using its advanced shapeshifting abilities and its unquestioning obedience for the Outsiders' sake. Since its lack of personality allows villains to snatch control of ReMAC, turning it into an enemy, Batman rigs up a telepresence system turning ReMAC into an advanced drone for Salah Miandad, Dr. Langstrom's chief assistant, enabling operation from the Outsiders HQ, the Batcave, or other secret locations. However, while testing a new neural interface, less dependent from his stamina, to control the former OMAC, Salah is knocked into a coma. His mind comes to reside in ReMAC, supplanting the missing personality of the drone for a while (one full issue), until, due to the machinations of the villainous Simon Hurt, ReMAC is fed a malicious self- destruct code that blows it to pieces, making the restoration of Salah's consciousness impossible. =Final Crisis= In Final Crisis, Darkseid and his prophets from Apokolips have taken new forms as humans on Earth after mass- distributing the Anti-Life Equation around the world. Batman has been captured; Superman is on a journey in the multiverse; and Wonder Woman has become a Female Fury. With most of the world's population under the influence of the equation, they are effectively under Darkseid's control seemingly making him the ruler of the Earth. In the one-shot Final Crisis: Resist, Mister Terrific and the Checkmate organization are working to mount a resistance against Darkseid, but seemingly do not have the means to do it. Sitting in despair in a Checkmate stronghold, Snapper Carr, through his hopeless rantings, gives Mister Terrific an ingenious idea. Using Sasha Bordeaux to make contact with Brother Eye, he convinces the A.I. to help them, explaining that it will surely be destroyed if Darkseid indeed captures the world. Realizing this, Brother Eye accepts Mister Terrific's terms and reveals that there are still millions of people infected with OMAC nanotech. These people, now mindless drones of Darkseid, are overwritten by Brother Eye and become OMAC soldiers under the command of Mister Terrific. This gives Checkmate and him the means to forcefully resist Darkseid. During the Final Crisis events when all seems lost, Lord (Brother) Eye prepares to leave the doomed Earth with his OMACs and the people of Command-D, the bunker underneath Bl√ºdhaven, and start a new society on another Earth in another universe. To this end, he asks Renee Montoya to serve as the head of a to-be-founded Global Peacekeeping Agency, her faceless appearance as the Question being an allusion to the faceless agents of the GPA from the original OMAC series. =Generation Lost= In the Justice League: Generation Lost limited series, the resurrected Maxwell Lord controls the squad of OMACs attacking Jaime Reyes's home and his family.Justice League: Generation Lost #2 (May 2010) The old Justice League International arrives and takes Jaime's family to safety.Justice League: Generation Lost #3 (June 2010) After Max escapes from the JLI, Booster Gold's partner, Skeets informs the JLI that he has the locations of the four formerly-dormant Checkmate cells which he had placed inside robotics laboratories that Max has been in contact with.Justice League: Generation Lost #10 (September 2010) The JLI travel to Chicago beneath the hidden robotics laboratory and learns that the OMAC variants were pure robots that are human/machine synthesis of the originals. Skeets scans the fingerprints of the robotics laboratory and discovers that Professor Ivo was here.Justice League: Generation Lost #11 (October 2010) When Captain Atom absorbs the energy from Magog's spear, he is propelled forward through time 112 years in the future, where Max, while long dead, has plunged humanity into a massive metahuman war that is ruled by OMACs. Captain Atom battled for survival alongside the future versions of the Justice League, however they all are eventually contaminated by a new version of OMACs and one by one become OMACs themselves. Captain Atom is eventually returned to the present, but not before Batman (Damian Wayne) tells him how to stop Max's ultimate plans.Justice League: Generation Lost #14 (November 2010) Afterward, Max gains new mental powers that can allow him to transform his targets into cadaver Black Lanterns, and then into OMACs after being fully restored to life.Justice League: Generation Lost #17 (January 2011) Max uses a device to enhance his new abilities, and he is able to turn people around the world into OMACs that attack Wonder Woman and the JLI.Justice League: Generation Lost #22 (March 2011) After this, Max sends his newest OMAC known as OMAC Prime, to which he had given both sentience and his voice, to attack Diana and the JLI.Justice League: Generation Lost #23 (April 2011) This new OMAC could assimilate the abilities of metahumans, in order to grow ever stronger with time, initially overwhelming the heroes it fought. During the final battle, Prime takes Blue Beetle's power, causing it to become nearly unstoppable, but Blue Beetle mentions to OMAC Prime that it cannot control the Scarab's power. Blue Beetle uses this to paralyze prime with crippling system failures before attacking and destroying OMAC Prime for good.Justice League: Generation Lost #24 (April 2011) =Possible Future= In Batman #700 (June 2010) in a vignette within the issue, Damian Wayne as Batman is shown having succeeded at what his father had failed to do: regaining control of Brother Eye.Batman #700 =Kevin Kho= In The New 52, a reboot of the DC Comics universe that launched in September 2011, a Cambodian-American man named Kevin Kho is introduced as the new O.M.A.C. and had worked as a genetic researcher at Project Cadmus.O.M.A.C. #1 Maxwell Lord is revealed to have had a hand in Kevin's transformation.O.M.A.C. #2 The series was cancelled after running eight issues, due to DC's introduction of a \\"Second Wave\\" of new titles. Additionally, O.M.A.C. joined the Justice League International in the title's final issue. During the \\"Forever Evil\\" storyline, the Crime Syndicate of America has captured Kevin Kho's O.M.A.C. form and is planning to use him as a weapon.Suicide Squad Vol. 4 #24 Harley, who is working for the Thinker, takes O.M.A.C. and activates him causing him to fire a laser on the mountain which collapses on the two teams inside it. Harley arrives at Belle Reve and drops O.M.A.C. near James Gordon Jr. James Gordon Jr. also learns that the Thinker is planning to use O.M.A.C. While James Gordon Jr. is talking to Harley, the Thinker has taken O.M.A.C. and begins transferring his mind to it. Now activated, O.M.A.C. proceeds to attack Amanda Waller, James Gordon Jr., Harley Quinn, King Shark, and Kamo.Suicide Squad Vol. 4 #25 King Shark begins to attack Kamo, until Amanda Waller is able to lie to both to get them to help her defeat OMAC.Suicide Squad Vol. 4 #26 OMAC is fighting King Shark and Kamo while Amanda Waller attempts to activate Belle Reve's failsafe through the Thinker's computer. Before she is able to do so, Kevin Kho reaches out to her telling her he is trapped within OMAC.Suicide Squad Vol. 4 #27 As Waller works with Kho, the team returns from the mountains, only to be dragged into the fight with OMAC. Having killed Kamo, OMAC is able to defeat Power Girl, Steel, Unknown Soldier, and King Shark and heads further into Belle Reve. Deadshot and Harley find \\"magic bullets\\" that will allow them to gain temporary super human powers. Deadshot fires them into Harley, Waller, himself, and Unknown Soldier and the Squad begins to attack OMAC.Suicide Squad Vol. 4 #28 Kho is able to regain control of OMAC before Waller has to enact her last resort. But without knowing, Captain Boomerang knocks OMAC into a porthole, sending him to another dimension.Suicide Squad Vol. 4 #29 Kevin Kho returns in DC Rebirth in Blue Beetle. He is a friend of Jaime Reyes. After seeing monsters in the city, OMAC takes control of Kevin and begins fighting. Jaime convinces OMAC to help him against the real enemy and OMAC agrees. Powers and abilities Brother Eye can activate the virus in any infected person, at any time, within planetary range. Once activated, the person is covered in cybernetic armor and becomes a thrall to Brother Eye's commands. An OMAC unit has access to archives on almost every metahuman on file, and can simulate countermeasures to the powers of a variety of superheroes and supervillains for the purpose of targeting the weaknesses of an opponent. Among the many inbuilt powers an OMAC drone possesses include flight, enhanced modular physicals pertaining to strength, speed, agility, reflexes, stamina, etc and firing various energy beams from its facial/chest eye and hands with caustic, concussive, or blinding effects. In addition, the OMAC unit can metamorphose their nanobionic forms into various shapes and sizes; e.i. being able to change & alter extremities, it's limbs into pincers and razor blades or even self generated cannonry, recombine upon and atop of one another to take on gigantic proportions as well as interface with technology using onboard micromachinery (regularly used amongst one another as a hive mind collective). Their main function is the application of nanotechnology in order to simulate the weaknesses of an opposing super powered beings whilst detaining and dispatching them. Such as shooting fire, project needles of artificial cellulose (against Alan Scott; an approximation of his weakness to wood), dispense flame-retarding foam, even once simulating Shazam's lightning power forcing Mary Marvel to revert to her human form. It can disable the Eradicator effortlessly. The only weakness an OMAC has is that it is human beneath its shell, intended as a deterrent to prevent heroes from using lethal force against them. The OMACs are dependent on their assessment of individual heroes & villains. When fighting multiple opponents, they require a few seconds to adapt their countermeasures for each meta in question. Atom Smasher was able to stop an OMAC that was attacking the JSA by stomping it before it could assess his threat level. OMACs are also very vulnerable to Mister Terrific, as he cannot be detected by technology. In the Superman/Batman series, Brainiac temporarily occupies a prototype OMAC drone.Superman/Batman 36, 2007. ReMAC, the OMAC possessed by the Outsiders, has the same powers and abilities of a regular OMAC. He greatly differs in his physical makeup, being red in color and with a more human-like face even in his armored form. Unable to contact Brother Eye and unable to access his former personality, ReMAC was controlled for a period by Dr. Salah Miandad. In this way, ReMAC retained his invulnerability and strength, but was limited by Salah's personal stamina and attention span, which was not always sufficient for a fight. Salah's mind was later trapped into the ReMAC body by a faulty mind interface, removing the limits of his below-average stamina. A very powerful and extremely deadly new class of O.M.A.C's were designed and employed by Maxwell Lord using the various resources of Checkmate, Project's Cadmus & M, the Metal Men responsometer tech, Amazo's absorption cell engineering and the xenomachinery of a Reach Scarab to fashion an all robotic legion of automatons which were easier to OMACtivate and conduct their motions while using the JLI to search out his ultimate goal. The culmination of all the incorporated innovation's from the greatest technological advancements on Earth was O.M.A.C Prime. A type of super android that could assess and exploit weaknesses, as well as implement psychological warfare using Max Lord's vocal patterns to offset his adversaries. Unlike other O.M.A.C's, Prime had the unique ability to mimic and combine the meta-abilities & utilities of other super types into itself, steadily making it stronger battle through the acquisition of new powers and technology assimilated into itself via observational stimulus.

This version is the classic Buddy Blank version. * In the Arrow episode \\"Corto Maltese\\", Ray Palmer is inspecting blueprints for OMAC. Later in the episode \\"The Secret Origin of Felicity Smoak\\", a group of cyber terrorists referring to themselves as Brother Eye use a virus to attack Starling City and threaten to shut down all banks and set everyone on an even socioeconomic status. Felicity Smoak is revealed to have created the \\"Brother Eye Virus\\" years ago with her then-boyfriend currently donning the name and leading the terrorist group, Cooper Seldon. In the episode \\"The Climb\\", Ray Palmer tells Felicity that he is changing the name of his exo-suit design from \\"OMAC\\" to \\"A.T.O.M.\\" =Video games= * The OMAC Project makes a cameo appearance in Batman's ending for the video game Mortal Kombat vs. DC Universe. In the game, it is explained that Batman designed the OMACs as a way to defend New Earth from multiverse invaders following the destruction of Dark Kahn (the merged form of Darkseid and Shao Kahn). These OMACs have an armor pattern that is similar to Batman's own costume and the acronym stands for Outerworld Monitor and Auto Containment. * Brother Eye and the OMAC Project appear in DC Universe Online with Brother Eye voiced by Ken Thomas. Brother Eye is reactivated and becomes a pawn of Brainiac in his plot to take over Earth. Brother Eye unleashes the OMAC virus and begins assimilating the area around the Gotham City Knights Dome. The players find Brother Eye in the sewers in Gotham City. Brother Eye's OMAC minions consist of Defective OMAC, OMAC Drones, OMAC MK II, OMAC Nanosyths, OMAC Sigmas, OMAC Units, OMAC Delta, and an OMAC Incinerator. * Brother Eye appears in Injustice 2, voiced by David Loefell as a communications hub linking every satellite and server on the planet which will warn Batman of impending crime. Bruce designed it after toppling Superman's regime in the previous game. During the game's story mode, Batman shows Black Canary and Green Arrow the new Batcave in the old Gotham Subway system built by Bruce's great-grandfather where Brother Eye is located. He explains Brother Eye's purpose to them. It is eventually taken over by Brainiac forcing Batman to abandon the Batcave. Cyborg hacks it, in though Brainiac states it is impossible for a mere human to penetrate his neural network though Cyborg reveals that he is not trying to. Cyborg reveals he is teaching Brother Eye to ignore Brainiac which successfully removes it from Brainiac's control. Catwoman then orders Brother Eye to activate communications so the Insurgency and Regime can coordinate evacuation of civilians in preparation for their attack on Brainiac's ship. Batman orders Brother Eye to broadcast their communications on the old Justice League band. Brother Eye is also the games announcer and its satellite interface acts as the game's main menu. The Brother Eye Vault acts as a menu for decoding Mother Boxes (as part of the game's loot box system), as well as regenerating and transforming customizable gear. In the Multiverse Mode intro, it is revealed that Brother Eye is equipped with the latest Source energy scanners enabling it to search for threats to both the Regime Universe and others allowing them to deal with crisis and ensure peace in the Multiverse. As a result Brother Eye plays a key role in the narrative of Multiverse Mode. * OMAC appears as a playable character in Lego DC Super-Villains.

It was written in 1888 and was not published until 1908. According to one of Nietzsche's most prominent English translators, Walter Kaufmann, the book offers \\"Nietzsche's own interpretation of his development, his works, and his significance.\\"Kaufmann, p. 201. The book contains several chapters with self- laudatory titles, such as \\"Why I Am So Wise\\", \\"Why I Am So Clever\\", \\"Why I Write Such Good Books\\" and \\"Why I Am a Destiny\\". Kaufmann's Nietzsche: Philosopher, Psychologist, Antichrist notes the internal parallels, in form and language, to Plato's Apology which documented the Trial of Socrates. In effect, Nietzsche was putting himself on trial with this work, and his sardonic judgments and chapter headings can be seen as mordant, mocking, self- deprecating, or sly. Peter Gast would \\"correct\\" Nietzsche's writings even after the philosopher's breakdown and would do so without his approval - something heavily criticized by today's Nietzsche scholarship. Within this work, Nietzsche is self-consciously striving to present a new image of the philosopher and of himself, for example, a philosopher \\"who is not an Alexandrian academic nor an Apollonian sage, but Dionysian.\\"Kaufmann, p. 202. On these grounds, Kaufmann considers Ecce Homo a literary work comparable in its artistry to Vincent van Gogh's paintings. Nietzsche argues that he is a great philosopher because of his withering assessment of the pious fraud of the entirety of Philosophy which he considered as a retreat from honesty when most necessary, and a cowardly failure to pursue its stated aim to its reasonable end. Nietzsche insists that his suffering is not noble but the expected result of hard inquiry into the deepest recesses of human self- deception, and that by overcoming one's agonies a person achieves more than any relaxation or accommodation to intellectual difficulties or literal threats. He proclaims the ultimate value of everything that has happened to him (including his father's early death and his near-blindness ‚Äì an example of love of Fate or amor fati). Nietzsche's primary point is that to be \\"a man\\" alone is to be actually more than \\"a Christ\\": his position is that the very idea of \\"a Christ\\" is in truth an empty impossibility, that it is nothing more than a dangerous creation of the human imagination. One of the main purposes of Ecce Homo was to offer Nietzsche's own perspective on his work as a philosopher and human being. He wrote: \\"Under these circumstances I have a duty against which my habits, even more the pride of my instincts, revolt at bottom ‚Äì namely, to say: Hear me! For I am such and such a person. Above all, do not mistake me for someone else!\\" Throughout the course of the book, he expounds ‚Äî in the characteristically hyperbolic style found in his later period (1886‚Äì1888) ‚Äî upon his life as a child, his tastes as an individual, and his vision for humanity. He gives reviews and insights about his various works, including: The Birth of Tragedy, The Untimely Meditations, Human, All Too Human, The Dawn, The Gay Science, Thus Spoke Zarathustra, Beyond Good and Evil, On the Genealogy of Morality, Twilight of the Idols and The Case of Wagner. The last chapter of Ecce Homo, entitled \\"Why I Am a Destiny\\", is primarily concerned with reiterating Nietzsche's thoughts on Christianity, corroborating Christianity's decadence and his ideas as to uncovering Christian morality. He signs the book \\"Dionysus versus the Crucified.\\" Notes References *Kaufmann, Walter. \\"Editor's Introduction\\" in On the Genealogy of Morals (translated by Walter Kaufmann and R.J.

Owned by Cumulus Media, the station services the Toledo metropolitan area and much of surrounding Northwest Ohio. Both the WQQO studios and station transmitter reside in Toledo's Scott Park neighborhood. Besides a standard analog transmission, WQQO broadcasts over two HD Radio channels, and is available online; WQQO-HD2 carries an active rock format branded as \\"100.7 The Zone\\", which is relayed over low-power analog translator W264AK.http://hdradio.com/station_guides/widget.php?id=84 HD Radio Guide for Toledo History The 105.5 MHz spot on the radio dial in the Toledo area began in November 1968 as WGLN, located in a cornfield in western Lucas County, the remote studio-transmitter location was the home of the \\"Jones Boys\\", a concept introduced in Toledo by station manager and native Toledoan Michael Drew Shaw. Like WTRX in Flint, Michigan where Shaw had been program director several years before being named manager at WGLN, every DJ used the last name Jones. Among the more notable, Davy Jones, Casey Jones, Tom Jones, and John Paul Jones. More notable D.J.s sporting the name JONES were Joe Hood, Steve Wright, Earl Sharninghouse, and Klaus Helfers, The station featured country music - the first such FM station in the market - and broadcast live performances. After a few months, WGLN became as \\"Golden 105,\\" featuring a primarily oldies playlist with a sprinkling of current hits introduced with the tagline \\"Here today, Golden tomorrow.\\" Then in late 1971, the format shifted to progressive rock. It was Toledo's first so-called underground FM station playing the songs and deep album cuts that no one else in the market was playing at the time. The station, however, was later sold in 1972 to Midwest Broadcasting and by spring of that year, 105.5 FM became a beautiful music station with the WXEZ call sign. In response to the format change, a citizens' group known as the Citizens' Committee to Keep Progressive Rock filed an objection with the FCC on the basis that Toledo already had several other middle-of-the-road/easy listening-type format stations and did not need another; the FCC rejected the appeal, and the committee continued to appeal the rejection until the Reams family changed WCWA-FM (104.7) to WIOT in December 1972, after which the objection was withdrawn. At this time, 105.5 FM was still located in its tiny studio in the rural cornfield setting at its transmitter site in Berkey, Ohio. It later was moved into the newly remodeled garage at the Pickle Road studios of WOHO. By the late 1970s it had transformed into an automated Top 40/rock format called \\"Z-Rock\\" (no relation to the heavy-metal music format of the same name) station known as \\"Z-105\\".\\"American Radio, Spring, 1978 Report\\" by James Duncan In 1979-1980, the station had a simulcast of sister station WOHO 1470 AM for morning drive time as well as for weekend broadcasts of American Top 40. In 1980 the station went on its own with live local on-air talent. As the format changed from rock to adult contemporary, it was known as \\"Z-105\\" to \\"3WM 105 FM\\" in the early 1980s. After dumping the WXEZ calls (to a Chicago station) they obtained WWWM- FM (from a Cleveland station who went by \\"M105\\"), hence the \\"3WM\\".\\"American Radio, Fall 1982\\" James H Duncan Jr. Their AM sister station on 1470, WOHO, then also changed their calls to WWWM from 1990-1995. The format was urban contemporary music at the time. The Toledo duopoly of 1470AM/105.5FM has always been owned by the Lew Dickey family, first as Midwestern Broadcasting, then as Cumulus Broadcasting/Media. The station re-branded as \\"Star 105\\" in 1998, changing format from adult contemporary to hot adult contemporary. In April 2007, Star 105.5 became Toledo's home for Delilah's syndicated love- songs program, which competes with the John Tesh show on Clear Channel's WRVF. WWWM had previously aired Delilah for a time during the late 1990s. At the same time, the station became known as \\"Star 105.5\\" rather than simply \\"Star 105\\" and modified its playlist in a more mainstream AC direction, adding more music from the 1970s. However, after Star 105.5 dropped Delilah, and in 2008 replaced her with the Billy Bush show, the station returned to hot AC and pre-1980s music was dropped. In April 2008, WWWM-FM began continuous HD Radio digital radio broadcasts. WWWM was re-branded as \\"Star 105\\" on March 19, 2012, concurrent with a format switch to contemporary hit radio; \\"Andrew Z in the Morning\\" was picked up for morning drive at this time, but dropped from the lineup that December. In September 2014, Denny Schaffer returned to the Toledo market to host morning drive on WWWM. On the morning of April 1, 2016, WWWM re-branded as \\"Channel 105.5\\", completing its shift back to Hot AC. By that June 22, WWWM re-branded as \\"Q105.5\\" under new WQQO calls; the WWWM call sign was subsequently parked on a co-owned Eden Prairie, Minnesota station. On September 4th, 2020, at 3PM, WQQO dropped the hot adult contemporary format and began stunting by playing 90s and 2000s throwback hip hop and pop hits, such as Eminem, Fabolous, Fergie, and Fall Out Boy, as a ‚Äúthrowback weekend‚Äù, while mentioning ‚Äú9/8/2020 at 5AM‚Äù on every sweeper, and dropping the Q105.5 moniker. Morning show host Eric Chase (formerly on rival WVKS) stated in a teaser video posted on the station‚Äôs Facebook page that he gets to do something he has always wanted to do since joining WQQO in 2017.

An earlier variant of the same aircraft had been designated PW-8 prior to 1925.\\"US Military Aircraft Designations & Serials 1909-1979 by J.M. Andrade, (Midland Counties Publications, ) 1970, 252pp. Design and development =PW-8= XPW-8B prototype for P-1 The Curtiss P-1 Hawk was the first US Army Air Service aircraft to be assigned the \\"P\\" (Pursuit) designation which replaced seven designations for pursuit aircraft, including \\"PW\\" (for \\"Pursuit, Water-cooled engine\\"). The P-1 was the production version of the Curtiss XPW-8B, an improved variant of the PW-8, 25 of which were operational with the Air Service's 17th Pursuit Squadron In September 1923, the Army ordered production of the PW-8. The PW-8 (Curtiss Model 33) had been developed from the R-6 racer and was acquired by the Air Service after a competition with the Boeing Model 15, designated the PW-9, to replace the existing Army fighter, the Boeing MB-3A. Although the PW-8 was faster than the PW-9 (both having top speeds in excess of 165 mph), it was otherwise outperformed by the Boeing plane, and its surface radiator cooling system, mounted on the upper and lower surfaces of the top wing for streamlining, was more difficult to maintain and vulnerable in combat. However, the Assistant Chief of the Air Service, Brigadier General Billy Mitchell, agreed to purchase 25 PW-8s in return for assistance by Curtiss in making the Dawn-to-dusk transcontinental flight across the United States. =P-1= P-1B Hawk P-2 Hawk The prototype of the P-1, the XPW-8B, came about when the Air Service, which had selected the Boeing PW-9 over the PW-8 as its main production fighter, asked Curtiss to modify the last of its three original XPW-8 prototypes with wings resembling those of the PW-9. Curtiss designated the modified aircraft its Model 34A and returned it to the Air Service for evaluation, from which the service ordered it into production as the P-1. The first production P-1, serial number 25-410, was delivered on August 17, 1925, and was followed in successive years by the P-1B and P-1C variants with improved engines. The newest P-1 variants remained in operational service until 1930. The March 7, 1925 order for the P-1 also requested five aircraft with the more powerful 500 hp (373 kW) Curtiss V-1400 engine installed. These were completed in January 1926. The first (SN 25-420) was then modified with a turbocharger mounted on the right side of the fuselage nose, and whose turbine was driven by engine exhaust; the craft was designated XP-2.Lloyd S. Jones, U.S. Fighters (Aero Publishers, Inc., 1975) pp. 14-15 However, the Curtiss V-1400 engine did not perform up to expectations, with or without the supercharger, and so after a year in service, three of the standard P-2 Hawks had their engines replaced with the Curtiss D-12 and were consequently redesignated as P-1s. The fifth machine (25-243) received a Curtiss V-1570 Conqueror engine and became the XP-6. 93 production P-1s were brought into service in the P-1, P-1A, P-1B, and P-1C variants. 52 other P-1s, variants P-1D, P-1E, and P-1F, were made by conversion of other Hawk variants, primarily AT-4 and AT-5 trainers. =P-3 and P-5 test variants= P-3 Hawk P-5 Superhawk The P-3 Hawk was similar to the P-1 Hawk but with a radial R-1340-3 Wasp radial engine. The first of the type, designated XP-3A, was the last P-1A (serial 26-300). Originally intended to be powered by a 390 hp (291 kW) Curtiss R-1454, the engine was deemed unsatisfactory and the 410 hp (306 kW) Pratt & Whitney R-1340 engine substituted. A second XP-3A (serial 28-189) included a cowling and spinner to reduce the drag due to the radial engine; entered in the National Air Races of 1929, its speed of 186.84 mph (300.69 km/h) gave it second place in the Thompson Trophy race. The remaining four aircraft were production P-3As, but primarily used to service test the Pratt & Whitney Wasp engine. In addition to the significant increase in drag, the radial engine also interfered with the pilot's view. Addition of a Townend ring cowling worsened the visibility problem, and had only a limited effect on speed. It was also tested with various types of deep-chord NACA cowls. Two of the XP-3A aircraft were re- engined in 1929 and 1930 with the Pratt & Whitney R-985-1 Wasp Junior engine. This aircraft was redesignated the XP-21. Tests were run with this aircraft, but it was never developed into a production aircraft, despite the designation. Five P-5 Superhawks, similar to the P-1C but with a turbocharged Curtiss D-12F engine, were delivered in 1928. They had a top speed of 166 mph (267 km/h) at 25,000 ft (7,620 m), considerably higher than the maximum ceiling of the P-1A, but their low-level performance was inferior\\"Weapons and Warfare volume 12\\" Editor Bernard Fitzsimons, (BPC Publishing Ltd., ), 1978, page 1255. =AT-4 and AT-5 trainers= A Curtiss AT-5A with a J-5 radial engine and alt= Two single-seat advanced trainer variants were placed into production, the AT-4 and AT-5A, using Wright-Hisso E / Wright-Hisso V-720 V-8 engines. All were re-engined with Curtiss D-12D engines and returned to use as fighters, designated P-1D and P-1F respectively. Five AT-4/XAT-5 test variants were re-classified as P-1E. A total of 202 PW-8, P-1, P-2, P-3, P-4, P-5, AT-4, and AT-5 airplanes were delivered. Operational history On June 23, 1924, taking off at 3:58 A.M., Army test pilot First Lieutenant Russell Maughan left Mitchel Field, New York, in PW-8 24-204, modified with additional fuel and oil tanks, made a dawn-to-dusk transcontinental flight across the US.\\"The Encyclopedia of Military Aircraft\\" by Robert Jackson, (Parragon Publishing, ), 2003, 384 pp. Refueling five times, he landed at Crissy Field, San Francisco, California, at 9:46 p.m., one minute before dusk, covering 2,670 mi (4,297 km) in 20 hours and 48 minutes. His flight time included four planned 30-minute stops at McCook Field, Ohio; Saint Joseph, Missouri; Cheyenne, Wyoming; and Salduro Siding, Utah; and an unplanned stop in North Platte, Nebraska for additional fuel when a muddy field in Missouri did not permit him to take on a full load. He also lost an hour at McCook to repair a broken fuel valve after an over-eager mechanic had over-torqued the valve, damaging it. The original fifteen P-1s served in the 27th and 94th Pursuit Squadrons, 1st Pursuit Group, Selfridge Field, Michigan. The first Hawk to serve with the Air Corps in quantity was the P-1A (17th, 27th, and 94th Pursuit Squadrons) beginning in 1925. In October 1928 the largest order of 33 P-1s was made. These were delivered by April 1929 as P-1Cs. The AT-4 and AT-5 trainer variants served with the 43rd Pursuit Squadron (School) at Kelly Field, Texas. Variants While a total of 202 Hawks were built in the basic variants PW-8, P-1, P-2, P-3, P-5, AT-4 and AT-5, conversions resulted in 148 having a P-1 designation. ;XPW-8 :Three manufactured, one modified to XPW-8A and later XPW-8B standard, one converted to CO-X two-seat observation aircraft. ;PW-8 :25 produced and flown by 17th Pursuit Squadron ;XPW-8A :XPW-8 23-1203 converted with a new cooling system and modified wings for trials ;XPW-8B :Model 34 - The XPW-8A fitted with single-bay tapered wing as prototype for the P-1 series. ;P-1 :Model 34A - Production version of the XPW-8B with modified rudder and additional wing center strut, and Clark Y aerofoil, powered by 435 hp (324 kW) Curtiss V-1150-1 (D12), ten built. ;P-1A :Model 34G - P-1 with three-inch fuselage stretch, larger wheels and revised fuel system, 25 built with Curtiss D-12C engine and three conversions from P-2.

Tarmvred has recorded primarily on the German Ad Noiseam label, although the latest release, the vinyl-only e.p. Tintorama, is on Low Res Records, based in Detroit, Michigan. Style of music Tarmvred's music has an experimental, electronic style, with heavy beats, a barrage of irregular percussion, distortion, and sparse use of melody. Only one brief stanza of clearly sung lyrics appear in all of their work, by guest vocalist Gertrud Polonyi; it appears on track 5 of Subfusc, as well as on the track \\"Mourning\\" on Onomatopoeic (apparently the same recording of the lyrics). Heavily distorted lyrics appear on a few other tracks, never more than briefly. Their tracks sometimes wander between rhythmic and chaotic, and have a wide variety of motives that continue falling away or appearing throughout the track. Tarmvred recorded much of Viva 6581 using a MOS 6581 sound chip, featured in early-80's computers such as the Commodore 64.

The programs focus on social justice, social welfare, anti-poverty, educational, and military recruiting. They draw their name from the historical South American hero, Sim√≥n Bol√≠var. Using increasing oil prices of the early 2000s and funds not seen in Venezuela since the 1980s, Ch√°vez created the \\"Bolivarian missions\\" in 2003, which were initially short-term projects dedicated to alleviating the largest socioeconomic problems facing Venezuela at the time. After enjoying political success, Ch√°vez made the missions his central priority for his administration, directly overseeing their operations and increasing funding during electoral campaigns. The most important missions created include Mission Robinson (literacy), Mission Barrio Adentro (free medical coverage), and Mission Mercal (affordable food).  Types  = Education = * Mission Robinson (launched July 2003)uses volunteers to teach reading, writing, and arithmetic to Venezuelan adults. * Mission Ribas (launched November 2003)provides remedial high school level classes to Venezuelan high school dropouts; named after independence hero Jos√© F√©lix Ribas. In 2004, about 600,000 students were enrolled in this night school programme, and paid a small stipend. They were taught grammar, geography and a second language. * Mission Sucre (launched in late 2003)provides free and ongoing higher education courses to adult Venezuelans. =Electoral= *Mission Florentino was organized by Hugo Ch√°vez to promote the option \\"No\\" in the Venezuelan recall referendum of 2004. The organizational centers of the Mission were named \\"Comando Maisanta\\" and were the ideological central headquarters for those who wished to keep Ch√°vez as the President of Venezuela for the remainder of his presidential period. =Environmental= *Mission Revoluci√≥n Energ√©tica (Mission Energy Revolution)a campaign launched November 2006 to replace incandescent lightbulbs with more energy-efficient fluorescent bulbs.http://ceims.mppre.gob.ve/index.php?option=com_content&view;=article&id;=46:mision- revolucion-energetica&catid;=23:misiones-bolivarianas = Food and nutrition = * Mission Mercalseeks to provide access to high-quality produce, grains, dairy, and meat at discounted prices. Seeks to provide Venezuela's poor increased access to nutritious, safe, and organic locally- and nationally grown foodstuffs. It also seeks to increase Venezuela's food sovereignty. Its concrete results, however, are highly debatable, as in 2007 the country is heavily more dependent on imported foodstuffs than it was in 1997, and has been facing chronic shortages in several basic supplies: milk, edible oils, sugar, cereals, eggs, and others. = Healthcare = * Mission Barrio Adentro (\\"Mission Inside the Neighborhood\\")a series of initiatives (deployed in three distinct stages) to provide comprehensive and community health care (at both the primary (Consultorios y Cl√≠nicas Populares or popular clinics) and secondary (hospital) levels, in addition to preventive medical counsel to Venezuela's medically under-served and impoverished barrios. * Mission Nevado ‚Äì Named after the dog of the Liberator Simon Bolivar, this program provides free medical services to pets (such as dogs) and their owners and handlers, most especially animals that have been rescued from torture and suffering from mistreatment from owners. = Housing = * Mission H√°bitathas as its goal the construction of new housing units for the poor. The program also seeks to develop agreeable and integrated housing zones that make available a full range of social servicesfrom education to healthcarewhich likens its vision to that of new urbanism. * Great Mission Housing Venezuela is the latest expansion of the housing missions since 2011. * Great Mission New Neighborhood, Tricolor Neighborhoodconducts house rehabilitation projects since 2009. = Identification = * Mission Identidadprovides Venezuelan national identity cards to facilitate access to the social services provided by other Missions. = Indigenous rights = * Mission Guaicaipuro (launched October 2003)carried out by the Venezuelan Ministry of Environment and Natural Resources, this program seeks to restore communal land titles and human rights to Venezuela's numerous indigenous communities, in addition to defending their rights against resource and financial speculation. = Land reform = * Mission Zamora an integrated land reform and land redistribution program in Venezuela. Several large landed estates and factories have been, or are in the process of being expropriated to stimulate the agricultural sector, create more economic activity and to redistribute wealth to the poor. = Rural development = * Mission Vuelta al Campo (\\"Return to the Countryside\\"; announced mid‚Äì 2005)seeks to encourage impoverished and unemployed urban Venezuelans to willingly return to the countryside. * Mission √Årbol (Mission Tree, announced June 2006)seeks to recover Venezuelan forests and to involve the rural population to stop harm to forests through from slash/burn practices by promoting more sustainable agriculture, such as growing coffee or cocoa. The projects aim to achieve this through self-organization of the local populations.‚ÄúWe Want to Change Human Interaction with Nature‚Äù.

It seeks to facilitate increased involvement of ordinary citizens in programs of endogenous and sustainable social development, emphasizing in particular the involvement of traditionally marginalized or excluded Venezuelan social and economic sectors, including those participating in Venezuela's significant \\"informal\\" economy. The mission's ultimate goal, according to Hugo Ch√°vez, is to foster an economy that brings \\"a quality and dignified life for all\\". In January 2006, Ch√°vez declared that, after fulfilling the first stage of the mission, the goal of the second stage will be to turn every \\"endogenous nuclei of development\\" into \\"military nuclei of resistance against American imperialism\\"Ch√°vez anunci√≥ n√∫cleos end√≥genos militares para la resistencia.

International assistance  = Cuba = Many of these programs involve importing expertise from abroad; Venezuela is providing Cuba with 53,000 barrels (8,000 m3) of below-market-rate oil a day in exchange for the service of thousands of physicians, teachers, sports trainers, and other skilled professionals.Bruce, Iain. Venezuela shuns IMF advice on oil money. BBC News (24 November 2004). In February 2010 seven Cuban doctors who defected to the US introduced an indictment against the governments of Cuba and Venezuela and the oil company PDVSA for what they considered was a conspiracy to force them to work under conditions of \\"modern slaves\\" as payment for the Cuban government' debt. In 2014, it was reported by Miami NGO, Solidarity Without Borders, that at least 700 Cuban medical personnel had left Venezuela in the past year and that up to hundreds of Cuban personnel had asked for advice on how to escape from Venezuela weekly. Solidarity Without Borders also stated that Cuban personnel cannot refuse to work, cannot express complaints and suffer with blackmail from threats against their family in Cuba.  Impact  The Bolivarian missions have been praised for their effect on poverty, education and health, and are described as \\"ways to combat extreme forms of exclusion\\" and \\"the mainstay of progress in the fight against poverty.\\" Spending on social programs initially increased, free health care clinics were built, food was subsidized, and small manufacturing cooperatives were created. On the other hand, the Ch√°vez government overspent on social spending without saving enough for economic distress, which Venezuela experienced shortly before and after Hugo Ch√°vez's death and during the economic policy of the Nicol√°s Maduro government. Poverty, inflation and shortages then began to increase. A multi-university study in 2015 questioned the effectiveness of the Bolivarian missions, showing that only 10% of Venezuelans studied benefited from the missions. Of that 10%, almost half were not affected from poverty. According to El Universal, experts stated that the missions actually worsened economic conditions in the country. =Health care= Mission Barrio Adentro, one of the flagship Bolivarian Missions of the widest social impact, drew praise from the Latin American branch of the World Health OrganizationWHO: Rep√∫blica Bolivariana de Venezuela: Cumpliendo las Metas del Milenio A report on Venezuela's objectives and progress regarding the UN Millennium Development Goals. and UNICEF.UNICEF: Venezuela‚Äôs Barrio Adentro: A Model of Universal Primary Health Care Barrio Adentro, however, has been criticized for poor working conditions of Cuban workers, funding irregularities, and an estimated 80% of Barrio Adentro establishments abandoned with some structures filled with trash or becoming unintentional shelters for the homeless.Matheus, Ricardo. Abandonados 70% de m√≥dulos de BA Diario 2001 (29 July 2007). The infant mortality rate went down 5.9% between 1999 and 2013. The Gini coefficient fell from 47.8 in 1999 to 44.8 in 2006. The government earmarked 44.6% of the 2007 budget for social investment, with 1999‚Äì2007 averaging 12.8% of GDP.Perdomo, Eucaris (Panorama 24 October 2006). Econom√≠a venezolana ha crecido un 12,5% en √∫ltimos 12 trimestres Retrieved 24 October 2006 =Poverty= During the Ch√°vez's presidency, poverty fell from 49.4% in 1999 to 30.2% in 2006 and extreme poverty went down from 21.7% to 9.9% in the same period according to the United Nations Economic Commission for Latin America and the Caribbean (ECLAC). However, the ECLAC showed a nearly 7% jump in poverty in 2013, from 25.4% in 2012 increasing to 32.1% in 2013. In a multi- university study by the Andr√©s Bello Catholic University (UCAB), the Central University of Venezuela (UCV) and the Simon Bolivar University (USB), a comparison to the Venezuelan government's National Statistics Institute (INE) showed that overall poverty trends eventually reversed and increased between 1999 and 2015, rising from approximately 45% in 1999 to 48.4% in 2015 according to the study performed by universities. Months later, the same universities found that 73% of Venezuelan households lived in poverty, with poverty increasing over 24% in about one year. Sustainability of missions From the beginning of the Bolivarian missions and past Ch√°vez's death, the sustainability of the missions was questioned. The Bolivarian government's over dependence on oil funds for large populist policies led to overspending on social programs and strict government policies created difficulties for Venezuela's import reliant businesses. Foreign Policy described Ch√°vez's Venezuela as \\"one of the worst cases of Dutch Disease in the world\\" due to the Bolivarian government's large dependence on oil sales and its lavish spending to please voters. Focus on the missions was increased during political campaigns in Venezuela, with Ch√°vez often overspending to fund their popularity. Following elections, government interest in the missions would then decline and their effectiveness would be negatively affected. The lack of institutional organization‚Äìmany missions had existing government services that only increased costs‚Äìand the \\"revolutionary\\" approach which often caused inefficient improvisation would eventually jeopardize the sustainability of the missions. As a result of Ch√°vez's policies, the durability of Bolivarian missions was put to the test shortly before and after Ch√°vez's death, when poverty increased, inflation rose and widespread shortages in Venezuela occurred, with such effects growing especially into the presidency of Nicolas Maduro. In 2014, Venezuela entered an economic recession. Estimates of poverty by the United Nations Economic Commission for Latin America and the Caribbean (ECLAC) and Luis Pedro Espa√±a, a sociologist at the Universidad Cat√≥lica Andr√©s Bello, show an increase in poverty. ECLAC showed a 2013 poverty rate of 32% while Pedro Espa√±a calculated a 2015 rate of 48% with a poverty rate of 70% possible by the end of 2015. According to Venezuelan NGO PROVEA, by the end of 2015, there would be the same number of Venezuelans living in poverty as there was in 2000, reversing the advancements against poverty by Hugo Ch√°vez.

It is long and tall. Only the northbound lanes of US 101 pass through it, as the southbound lanes descend from Gaviota Pass through a narrow canyon to the west of the tunnel. Because it is the only major route between the Santa Barbara County South Coast and the Santa Ynez Valley, bicycles are allowed through it. There is a rest area for both southbound and northbound lanes on the southern end of the tunnel, the southernmost one along U.S. Route 101. There are frequent rockslides in the area, especially during and following rain. Some of the hillsides and road cuts are covered in netting to prevent erosion. There are also fences made of netting along the roadway to stop rocks that do fall. An alternate bypass to this section of US 101 between Santa Barbara and Los Olivos is provided by State Route 154 (SR 154) capped by the Cold Spring Canyon Arch Bridge near the summit of San Marcos Pass. SR 154 cuts directly between Santa Barbara and Los Olivos in a northwestern direction, whereas US 101 runs along the coast of the Pacific Ocean about west before turning north passing through Buellton to meet up with SR 154 near Los Olivos.  History  Gaviota Pass is registered as California Historical Landmark #248. On this site during the Mexican‚ÄìAmerican War on Christmas Day 1846, the Mexican Army waited to ambush the American forces of John C. Fr√©mont. Fremont learned of their plans and instead crossed the San Marcos Pass to capture Santa Barbara.  In popular culture  The Gaviota Tunnel was featured in The Graduate, Wayne's World 2, and Sideways. But in the first two films, Dustin Hoffman and Mike Myers respectively travel the wrong way through the tunnel. In those movies, they are supposed to be going southbound, but go through the tunnel in the northbound direction (the tunnel does not have any southbound lanes). In Sideways, Paul Giamatti and Thomas Haden Church are heading north, and therefore pass through the tunnel in the correct northbound direction. In Grand Theft Auto V, the tunnel is known as the \\"Braddock Tunnel\\" and connects the town of Paleto Bay with the town of Grapeseed.

It is created and written by Leila Basen and David Preston and directed by Sean Dwyer and Michael Kennedy. The show revolves around thirteen- year-old Donovan Mackay. His mom and dad seem to be going through a second adolescence, while he's going through his first. His best friends, Ira and Shelley don't even register on the \\"cool meter\\" at school. His main crush, Chloe, is so far out of his league she doesn't know he's on the team. Luckily, Donovan has four teenagers living inside his head, Sparks, Maynard, Skipper, and RJ.

The area is centered just west of the intersection of Woodward Avenue and Grand Boulevard, and is bounded by, and includes the Virginia Park Historic District on the north, the Edsel Ford Freeway (I-94) on the south, John R Street on the east and the Lodge Freeway on the west.Randall Fogelman, Detroit's New Center, Arcadia Publishing, 2004, . New Center, and the surrounding areas north of I-94, are sometimes seen as coterminous with the North End, while in fact separate districts. The heart of New Center was developed in the 1920s as a business hub that would offer convenient access to both downtown resources and outlying factories. Some historians believe that New Center may be the original edge city--a sub-center remote from, but related to, a main urban core. The descriptor \\"New Center\\" derived its name from the New Center News, an automotive-focused free newspaper begun in 1933 that continues to operate under the name Detroit Auto Scene. From 1923 to 1996, General Motors maintained its world headquarters in New Center (in what is now Cadillac Place) before relocating downtown to the Renaissance Center; before becoming a division of GM, Fisher Body was headquartered in the Fisher Building. Both Cadillac Place and the Fisher Building are National Historic Landmarks. In addition to the government and commercial offices along Woodward and Grand Boulevard, New Center contains the Fisher Theatre, the Hotel St. Regis, the Henry Ford Hospital, restaurants, and residential areas. History In 1891, Detroit mayor Hazen S. Pingree broke ground on the construction of Grand Boulevard, a ring road that wrapped around the city of Detroit.Richard Bak, Detroit Across Three Centuries, Sleeping Bear Press, 2001, , p. 60.] The Boulevard ran for , curving from the Detroit River on the west to the river on the east and crossing Woodward Avenue at a point approximately from downtown. The Boulevard was originally thought to represent the absolute limit of the city's expansion, although tremendous growth at the beginning of the 20th century quickly pushed the city limits far beyond Grand Boulevard. In the 1890s, major railroad infrastructure known as the Milwaukee Junction was built just south of Grand Boulevard to facilitate industrial expansion in the city of Detroit.Eric J. Hill, John Gallagher, and the American Institute of Architects Detroit Chapter, AIA Detroit: The American Institute of Architects Guide to Detroit Architecture, Wayne State University Press, Detroit, 2002, . pp. 168-169. To take advantage of the rail line, industrial plants were built in this area on both sides of Woodward Avenue, with the automotive industry prominently involved. Part of this area east of Woodward is now the Piquette Avenue Industrial Historic District, while the area west of Woodward and south of the railroad tracks is the New Amsterdam Historic District. Most notably, in 1904, Burroughs Adding Machine Company built a large factory on Third, and the following year Cadillac built an assembly plant just to the east of Burroughs.Fogelman, pp. 57-66. In 1915, Henry Ford bought the financially struggling Detroit General Hospital and its lands on Grand Boulevard and Hamilton (just west of Woodward) and reopened it as Henry Ford Hospital with 48 beds.Fogelman, pp. 9-20 Soon after, Ford broke ground on a facility at the same location; the larger hospital opened in 1921. Architecture In the late 1910s and early 1920s, the automobile industry in Detroit grew rapidly. The economic surge made land in downtown Detroit difficult to obtain. The lack of suitable parcels frustrated William C. Durant in his search for the optimum location for his planned General Motors headquarters. Durant looked to the north, and settled on a location just west of Woodward Avenue on Grand Boulevard. At the time, the area was a residential district of private homes and small apartment buildings.Fogelman, pp. 22-23. Durant hired Albert Kahn to design his building, and ground was broken in 1919. The building was originally to be called the \\"Durant Building\\", but Durant left the company before the building was completed, so when it opened in 1922, the building was called the \\"General Motors Building\\" (now the Cadillac Place). As General Motors continued to grow, the company required more space. In the later 1920s, they built a second building, the General Motors Research Laboratory (also known as the Argonaut Building), also designed by Kahn, directly south of their headquarters. The building was built in two phases, and was completed in 1930.Fogelman, p.32. Around the same time, the Fisher Brothers of Fisher Body followed General Motors to the area. They broke ground on their eponymous Fisher Building in 1927, located across Grand Boulevard from the General Motors Building. The Fisher Brothers also hired Kahn, and spared no expense to construct their headquarters building. The followed this up with the construction of New Center Building (now the Albert Kahn Building), completed in 1932.Fogelman, pp. 37-48. The Great Depression, however, forced the Fishers to break off their plans to construct a complex of buildings in New Center, including a grandiose three-towered version of the Fisher building. In 1940 Saks Fifth Avenue opened their fourth full-line department store in this building.http://departmentstoremuseum.blogspot.com/2010/11/saks-fifth-avenue- new-york-city-new.html The store closed in 1978 and relocated to Fairlane Town Center in Dearborn. Henry Ford Hospital has continued to expand. The hospital has built numerous additions to their campus since its inception by Henry Ford, from the Clara Ford Nursing Home in 1925 to their high-rise clinic in 1955 to hospital apartments in 1976. In 1992, Henry Ford purchased the old Burroughs headquarters to the south and renamed it One Ford Place. The building is now the Henry Ford Hospital corporate headquarters. In 1966, the Hotel St. Regis was built on the north side of Grand Boulevard near General Motors' headquarters. In 1988, the hotel was doubled in size.Fogelman, p. 84-85. In 1980, General Motors built another addition to the heart of New Center, New Center One, located across Grand Boulevard from their headquarters. The new eight-story building housed retail stores, offices, and some divisions of General Motors.Fogelman, p. 35. In 1977, General Motors began refurbishing some of the residential neighborhoods north of Grand Boulevard. The result was the \\"New Center Commons\\", a collection of refurbished single-family homes on the north side of New Center. With the revitalization of Virginia Park, New Center has two distinct historic residential neighborhoods within its boundaries. General Motors also facilitated the rehabilitation of some multi-family dwellings. In the late 1990s and early 2000s, new townhomes and condominiums were constructed in what had been empty areas of New Center, including a section along Woodward just north of Grand Boulevard. Additional loft renovation (as well as TechTown, the WSU research and business incubator hub) took place at the same time within the New Amsterdam Historic District. Economy New Center served as a kind of corporate campus for GM for 70 years. However, the company left the area in the 1990s, moving their headquarters to the Renaissance Center downtown. The old General Motors Building‚Äînow called Cadillac Place‚Äîis owned and occupied by the State of Michigan. The economy of the New Center area is largely dominated by the Henry Ford Health System, the Detroit Public School system with their headquarters in the Fisher Building, and more than 2,000 State of Michigan employees in the high-rise office complex Cadillac Place. Shinola Detroit, has its headquarters, and 30,000-square-feet in the College for Creative Studies, ‚Äì CCS ‚Äì (originally the Argonaut building, or General Motors Research Laboratory). In 2012, Shinola renovated the fifth floor and turned it into their corporate office as well as a watch factory and bicycle workshop. In 2014, Shinola gifted the city of Detroit with four new 13-foot tall street clocks, installed at Cobo Center, Eastern Market, in front of the College for Creative Studies at the corner of Cass and Milwaukee, and near Shinola's own first retail location, at the corner of Cass and Canfield. Midtown Detroit, Inc., has become a driving force behind the planning, investment, and future development north of Detroit's downtown area, and has expanded those area boundaries, and of the New Center area by going north to Philadelphia Street, east to the Chrysler Freeway (I-75), south to the Edsel Ford Freeway (I-94), and west to Rosa Parks Boulevard.

New Center hosts the annual summer-long series of events in New Center Park and includes a 1,000 person outdoor concert venue with a center stage capable of hosting national acts.New Center Park Grand Boulevard, along its entire extent, became an attractive residential address at the beginning of the 20th century. This was also true in the area that was to become New Center. At the turn of the century, a number of private homes were built along Grand Boulevard and in the neighborhoods to the north, notably including what is now the Virginia Park Historic District on the northern edge of New Center.Fogelman, pp. 87-100 Interspersed in the area were small apartment buildings. Larger apartment buildings were constructed in the area in the 1920s to serve the population of workers and visitors to the area after larger office buildings had been built on Grand Boulevard. =Revitalization= The 2010s have seen a growth of new development in the New Center area. One of the first major projects, begun in 2010, was by the Henry Ford Health System of a $500 million revitalization effort of 300 mostly blighted acres for hospital expansion and neighborhood redevelopment just south of the main hospital campus on the western edge of New Center. Bounded by West Grand Boulevard to the north, the Lodge to the east, I-94 to the south and 14th Street to the west. The first development on the new South Campus site was the construction of a $30 million, 275,000-square-foot, Medical Distribution Center on 18-acres, built for Cardinal Health, Inc. Further plans were announced in 2017, with the construction of a new $150‚Äì160 million, 187,000-square-foot, six-story, Brigitte Harris Cancer Pavilion, along with a skywalk across West Grand Boulevard to connect it to the Henry Ford Hospital, scheduled to open in early 2020. Streetcar maintenance bay, inside Penske Tech Center Additional new construction in New Center includes Wayne State University's $92 million, 200,000-square-foot Integrative Biosciences Center (IBio), begun in 2012, as many as 400 researchers, and staff will work out of the IBio Center, at 6135 Woodward Avenue. In 2015, M-1 Rail began work on its $10.6 million headquarters, operations center, and streetcar maintenance facility, known as the Penske Tech Center, between E. Bethune and Custer streets along Woodward Avenue. In 2016, the real estate development group The Platform broke ground on The Boulevard at Third & Grand, a $60 million, six-story apartment complex with 231 apartments, and 17,500 square feet of retail space. In 2017, the Detroit Pistons and the Henry Ford Health System announced plans to build a new $127 million, 185,000-square-foot, practice, training, and team headquarters building, and a dedicated 54,000-square-foot sports medicine building, known as the Henry Ford-Detroit Pistons Performance Center, along Amsterdam Street between Second and Third Avenues. In 2019, WSU had its Computing & Information Technology (C&IT;) infrastructure enhanced with a new $15 million, 13,000-square-foot, state-of-the-art data center at Cass & Antoinette St., the new building will be attached to the current Computing Services Center in TechTown, along with a new Pocket park that will buffer the data center from Cass Avenue. New Center has also seen redevelopment of existing structures. This includes U-Haul's 2013 restoration of the 250,000-square-foot, seven-story historic NBC-Nabisco Building, built in 1920 at 899 W. Baltimore St. and, in 2014, the conversion of the Hotel St. Regis annex into a 58-apartment residential building. In 2015, Central Detroit Christian Community Development Corporation announced a $10.2 million plan to renovate the four-story, 44-unit, 42,200-square-foot Casamira Apartments at 680 Delaware St., built in 1925. In 2018, a local investment group purchased the 125-room Hotel St. Regis, and plans a $6 million modernization, and that was followed by the purchase of the Albert Kahn Building by a joint venture with a $58 million plan to convert it into 211 apartments, and more than 75,000 square feet of retail and office space.

In the mid-2000s, CSK operated five value concept retail stores under the Pay N Save brand name in and around Phoenix, Arizona. These stores sold primarily tools, hardware, sporting goods, housewares and other household goods, and seasonal items. To try and increase the tool business CSK built six stores that combined both auto parts and tools in Michigan, Colorado, Washington, and Arizona. The company ceased operations of the Pay N Save stores on August 26, 2007. CSK sponsored major league baseball in major markets throughout its trade areas, the 2Xtreme Racing monster truck team and the funny car driven by Del Worsham in the National Hot Rod Association. CSK was designated the Official Auto Parts Store of the NHRA. CSK served both the do-it-yourself (\\"DIY\\") and the commercial installer, or do-it-for-me (\\"DIFM\\"), customer. The DIY market, which comprises customers who typically repair and maintain vehicles themselves, was the foundation of the business. The DIFM market comprised auto repair professionals, fleet owners, governments and municipalities. History CSK Auto experienced growth through a combination of acquisitions and a program of store construction and expansion. In 1997, CSK acquired 81 Trak Auto stores in Southern California, converting them to the Kragen name and product mix. This led to an extremely productive year in 1998, as annual sales broke the $1-billion barrier for the first time, and the company opened, expanded, or relocated a total of 130 more stores. In June 1999, CSK added 86 more Checker stores in the Northern Plains states by acquiring the Big Wheel/Rossi Auto Parts chain, and in October of that year CSK completed its acquisition of 194 Al's and Grand Auto Supply stores in Washington, California, Idaho, Oregon, Nevada, and Alaska, solidifying its position as a retailer of automotive aftermarket parts and accessories in the western United States. To strengthen its position in the Northern Plains states, in April 2000, CSK purchased All-Car Distributors, operators of 21 stores in Wisconsin and one in Michigan. Link via ProQuest. These stores operated under the Checker banner. On December 19, 2005, CSK announced it had completed the purchase of Murray's, Inc. and its subsidiary, Murray's Discount Auto Stores. The 110 Murray's automotive-part and accessory retail stores in Michigan, Illinois, Ohio and Indiana retained the Murray's name and operating model. On April 1, 2008, O‚ÄôReilly Automotive, Inc. signed a deal to acquire all of CSK's common stock for approximately one billion dollars, including $500 million of debt. Starting in 2009, O'Reilly gradually rebranded Checker Auto Parts, Schucks Auto Supply, and Kragen Auto Parts stores as O'Reilly Auto Parts stores during a multi-year process that was finally completed in 2011. On March 5, 2009 the SEC filed a civil injunction against 4 former members of CSK Auto. The former members were charged with accounting fraud for the years of 2002, 2003, and 2004.

Over the years, Pay 'n Save was the leading drugstore chain in Washington and was the owner of several Washington-based retailers including Lamonts and Ernst. A 1984 sale of the company to The Trump Group and a 1986 attempt to transform the retailer into a bargain-basement merchandiser resulted in a loss of nearly $50 million. By 1988, Pay 'n Save was sold to Thrifty Corporation who later sold the stores to PayLess Drug who retired the Pay 'n Save name. As a result, most of the retailer's divisions were spun off as separate companies or shuttered. As of 2020, Pay 'n Save's membership discount chain, Bi-Mart, is the lone surviving division of the company (the chain has been an employee-owned company since 2003). At the company's peak, Pay 'n Save was operating 313 stores in ten western states under several different names including Pay 'n Save, Ernst, Bi-Mart, Lamonts, Sportswest, Schuck's Auto Supply, Yard Birds, Von Tobel's, and Price Savers. History =Founding; company acquisitions= In 1940, businessman Monte Lafayette Bean arrived in Seattle, Washington from Portland, Oregon to take over Tradewell Stores, Inc., a chain of grocery stores. By 1947, Bean and his son, M. Lamont Bean, opened the first Pay 'n Save drug store at Fourth Avenue and Pike Street in Seattle. In March 1959, M. Lamont Bean became the president of Pay 'n Save and began considering operating other stores that were not pharmacies. Shortly after, Bean began an interest in Ernst Hardware, a local hardware chain owned by Seattle brothers Fred and Charles Ernst. Fred Ernst agreed to sell Ernst Hardware and its nine locations to Pay 'n Save in February 1960. In 1962, Pay 'n Save acquired Malmo Nursery and began opening Ernst-Malmo combination stores; combining hardware, lumber, garden supplies, and nursery items in one building. The first Ernst-Malmo combination store was opened at the University Village shopping center in Seattle. By 1982, Ernst was operating 68 hardware stores. In 1965, Pay 'n Save acquired the Rhodes department stores chain. Pay 'n Save shuttered the Rhodes flagship store in Seattle during 1968. The Rhodes name was retired from the suburban branches when M. Lamont Bean renamed the stores Lamonts in 1970. During 1976, Pay 'n Save acquired discount chains Bi- Mart and Yard Birds. Yard Birds Yard Birds was originally a surplus store started in 1947 in Centralia, Washington. There were also Yard Birds stores in Chehalis, Olympia, and Shelton. While originally selling war surplus, Yard Birds became more of a discount store with many departments including hardware, toys, shoes and clothing, automotive, pets, sporting goods, furniture, a full-service grocery, and more. Yard Birds stores had a logo that featured a black bird with a yellow beak, reminiscent of the cartoon characters Heckle and Jeckle. These stores were not affiliated with Yardbirds Home Center in Northern California, which used a white stork with yellow overalls as its mascot. The Yard Birds store in Chehalis is closed, but the new owners have rechristened the space as the New Yard Birds Mall & Shop'n Kart. According to the New Yard Birds Mall website there is a Grocery store (Shop'n Kart), archery shop, an auto repair facility, a movie theater and the school district rents an area for some of their programs, plus they have rooms to rent for conferences. So while the original Yard Birds is gone, the name, building, and mascot live on. =History= * 1947Two friends, Bill Jones and Rich Gillingham, start Two Yard Birds Surplus in Centralia, Washington. Later that year they move the store to just north of Chehalis, Washington. * 1959Bill Jones and Rich Gillingham buy an old cannery in Olympia, Washington and start a sister store called Seamart. The Seamart store eventually takes on the Yard Birds name. * 1971A giant new store opens in Chehalis, Washington with a tall sculpture of a Yard Bird that is big enough for people to drive their car through. * 1976Pay 'n Save, a Pacific Northwest drug store chain, buys Yard Birds. * 1979A Yard Birds opens in Shelton, Washington. * 1987Employees buy out Yard Birds from Pay 'n Save. * 1993Facing growing competition from other retailers, Yard Birds in Olympia closes. * 1995Facing growing competition from other retailers, Yard Birds closes its stores in Chehalis and Shelton. =Death of founder; Trump Group takeover= A Bi-Mart store in Ontario, Oregon In October 1982, company founder Monte Lafayette Bean died at age 83. In 1983, Pay 'n Save entered the wholesale club business and opened the first Price Savers Warehouse in Salt Lake City, Utah. In December 1983, Pay 'n Save acquired Schuck's Auto Supply, Inc. for about $70 million in Pay 'n Save common stock. At the time, Schuck's had 58 stores in Washington, Oregon, and Idaho. In September 1984, the Pay 'n Save board voted to sell the retailer and to give a lockup option on $4.1 million shares to the Trump Group (no relation to New York real estate developer Donald Trump) in an effort to stave off other bids. Pay 'n Save's largest shareholders, Stuart Sloan and Samuel N. Stroum, vowed to fight the sale of the retail company. Sloan and Stroum, who owned 18 percent of Pay 'n Save's stock, issued a statement telling shareholders not to \\"be stampeded into acting hastily\\". On September 12, 1984, The Trump Group announced that it had withdrawn its offer to purchase Pay 'n Save in order to negotiate with Sloan and Stroum. On October 15, 1984, Pay 'n Save was officially sold to the Trumps for $358 million. =Sale of subsidiaries= A closed Ernst store in Boise, Idaho The company's sporting goods chain, Sportswest, was spun off in 1984 before being closed completely. After a brief period, Thrifty Corporation reopened the stores under the Big 5 Sporting Goods name. Sportswest was the first of several Pay 'n Save division to be sold over the next few years. In May 1985, Pay 'n Save announced it would put all its subsidiaries up for sale. During this time, Dayton-Hudson division Mervyns was expected to acquire the company's 20 Lamonts stores and Southland Corporation, then-owner of 7-Eleven, expressed interest in acquiring all 58 Schuck's Auto Supply stores. The first subsidiary to be sold was Price Savers Warehouse, in August 1985, to Cincinnati, Ohio- based Kroger. On November 1, 1985, Pay 'n Save successfully spun off Bi-Mart, Lamonts, and Schuck's to form a new company, Northern Pacific Corporation. With all divisions combined, the new company had sales of about $450 million, making it one of the Northwest's largest retail operations. Just eight days later, Pay 'n Save's flagship drugstore chain became controlled by a company equally owned by the Trump Group and a partnership headed by William Zimmerman, owner of California discount chain Pic 'N' Save. The sale left Pay 'n Save with 69 Ernst Home Center stores, three Yard Birds stores, and wholesaler Northwestern Drug Co. By January 1986, Pay 'n Save Corp. was renamed Seattle Standard Corp. =Return as a public company= After 19 months as a privately held company, Pay 'n Save announced plans to return as a public company in May 1986. The company planned to sell 3 million shares at from $16 to $18 a share. As part of the transaction, the company purchased Bi- Mart, a former division of the original Pay 'n Save Corp. The original company sold its first shares of common stock to the general public in 1962 and reverted to private ownership in October 1984. On May 15, 1986, days after announcing plans to go public again, Pay 'n Save announced it would be taking on a new image and announced plans to remodel its 108 stores, which would include a new blue-and-green paint scheme. The company also announced its new emphasis on bargain goods and plans to raise $225 million by selling convertible bonds and 10-year notes. In June 1986, Pic 'N' Save, filed a lawsuit against Pay 'n Save's investment banker, contending that materials outlining Pay 'n Save's stock offering misrepresent the role of Pic 'N' Save's former chairman, William Zimmerman. When Zimmerman left Pic 'N' Save in August 1984, he agreed not work for a competing company for one year, but the company's interests had been attempting to determine whether Zimmerman violated the agreement. The suit, filed in state Superior Court in Los Angeles, said that the \\"Zimmerman merchandising strategy\\", a key part in Pay 'n Save's business plan, includes Pic 'N' Save trade secrets and other confidential information. On July 1, 1986, Pic 'N' Save had filed a civil lawsuit against Pay 'n Save, William Zimmerman, and related parties, asking for more than $50 million compensatory damages and $50 million in punitive damages. By the end of July 1986, Zimmerman and the Trumps again turned Pay 'n Save into a public company by selling $52 million in stock, despite a dramatic decline in sales since they took over. The company later reported a $12.8 million loss in the first quarter ending August 2. Mike Reynolds, senior reporter for New York industry publication Chain Drug Review, blamed the company's decline on Zimmerman's approach displaying tables of low-cost imported items. By December, the company's president, Maynard Jenkins, resigned for a job in California and the company's discounted items would no longer be carried. =Return to old format= In January 1987, Pay 'n Save reported a loss of nearly $50 million in the last year. At the time, chief executive Gerald Nathanson said Pay 'n Save management believes a new merchandising strategy and restructuring \\"will strengthen Pay ' n Save and improve its future performance significantly\\". In February 1987, Pay 'n Save announced the closure of all stores in Montana and Wyoming. In June 1987, Pay 'n Save revealed its \\"back to basics\\" merchandising plan. The chain planned to revert their 106 drug stores back to the familiar blue-and-green color scheme, complete with new signs, and better lighting. The company's stores would focus on departments such as candy and snacks, stationery, household chemicals and greeting cards, while the pharmacies would remain the foundation of each store. The company's remodeling process was blamed for a loss of $9.6 million in the company's third quarter. =Thrifty Corporation and PayLess Drug= In April 1988, Pay 'n Save was put up for sale. The sale attracted interest from Thrifty Corporation, who previously acquired Sportswest from Pay 'n Save in 1984. On May 13, Thrifty announced plans to acquire the company's 110 Pay 'n Save drug stores and 37 Bi-Mart discount stores for stock worth $232 million. Thrifty also announced plans to keep the Pay 'n Save and Bi-Mart names and the company's current employees. In the previous year, Pay 'n Save was left with a $27 million loss and a $49 million loss in 1986. In August 1988, Gerald Nathanson, Pay 'n Save president and CEO, resigned from the company. Richard Dortch, who began working with Pay 'n Save as a store clerk in 1969, was elected president of the 124-drugstore chain in January 1991. By February 1992, Pay 'n Save was once again for sale. Days prior to the February 5 announcement, the company announced a loss of $88 million after a $250 million after-tax special charge. By March, PayLess Drug Stores, a then subsidiary of Kmart, emerged as a possible buyer for some or all Pay 'n Save 125 drugstores. PayLess officials were not able to comment at the time. In June 1992, PayLess Drug Stores officially acquired the money-losing Pay 'n Save drug stores from Thrifty Corporation. Leonard Green & Partners, a Los Angeles investment firm that specializes in management buyouts agreed to acquire Thrifty Corporation's other division, including Pay 'n Save's Bi-Mart. Following the sale, the Pay 'n Save stores were renamed PayLess Drug. M. Lamont Bean, the company's president from 1959 to 1984, died on February 5, 2004 at age 79. Current status of former subsidiaries * Bi-Mart: Bi-Mart's parent company, Thrifty PayLess was sold to Rite Aid in October 1996 for $1.3 billion. Rite Aid sold Bi-Mart to Endeavour Capital in 1997. By 2004, Endeavour Capital transferred ownership of the company to its employees through an employee stock ownership plan. * Ernst Home Centers: Ernst went public in 1994 in a bid to raise $50 million to open 55 superstores. Tough competition from larger stores forced the company to file for Chapter 11 bankruptcy in July 1996 and close 33 stores. The company suffered more losses and announced the closure of its remaining 53 stores in November 1996. * Lamonts: In August 1989, Northern Pacific sold the chain to Scottsdale, Arizona-based Aris Corporation for $135 million. Lamonts filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy in January 1995 and once more in January 2000. In April 2000, California-based Gottschalks purchased Lamonts' store leases for $19 million. The $19 million deal did not include Lamonts inventory, which was sold off. Gottschalks eventually filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy and liquidated in mid-2009 during the Late-2000s recession. * Price Savers Warehouse: Only three years after buying Price Savers, Kroger sold the 16-unit chain to a management-led investment group in September 1988. Kmart's Pace Membership Warehouse division acquired Price Savers for an undisclosed amount of cash in January 1991. Pace was eventually absorbed in Wal-Mart's Sam's Club division in 1993. * Schuck's Auto Supply: In 1987, Jules and Eddie Trump combined Schuck's, Kragen Auto Parts, and Checker Auto Parts to form Northern Automotive; later renamed CSK Auto. CSK Auto made a public offering of its stock in 1998 and became to first major auto parts retailer to sell products on the internet in 1999. O'Reilly Auto Parts, the third largest U.S. auto parts chain, acquired CSK Auto for $528 million in 2008. O'Reilly converted all CSK Auto-owned stores to the O'Reilly name shortly after. * Yard Birds: In 1987, Seattle Standard sold the chain to its employees through an employee stock ownership plan. Rich Gillingham, co- founder of Yard Birds, died in 1992. The company closed one store in 1993 and closed its last two stores in 1995. The Olympia store was burned down in the late 1990s. The store in Chehalis still remains.

He became famous from his appearances on Granada Television's The Comedians and ATV's The Golden Shot, delivering his catchphrase, \\"me old flower\\" in his broad Yorkshire accent. Early life and football career Williams was born in Royston, a small mining village in Barnsley, South Yorkshire. His father, also Charles, had come to Britain in 1914 from Barbados,Obituary, The Daily Telegraph, 4 September 2006. and enlisted in the Royal Engineers. After the First World War, his father settled in Royston, where he sold groceries from a horse and cart, and married a local woman, Frances Cook. His father had been forced to give up his job as a greengrocer as a result of trench foot acquired in France, and depended on National Assistance. After leaving school aged 14 (when, according to his autobiography Ee-I've Had Some Laughs, his father died), Williams worked at Upton Colliery during the Second World War, a reserved occupation. He played football for the colliery team, before turning professional, and signing for Doncaster Rovers in 1948, having also considered York City and Nottingham Forest , aged 19. A centre-half, he played for the first team in 1950, but then remained in the reserves until 1955, when he became an established first team player for four years. He played 171 times for Rovers in total, but scored only one goal, in a Second Division game away to Barnsley on 24 March 1956. In his own words, \\"I was never a fancy player, but I could stop them buggers that were.\\" He ended his career with Skegness Town in the Midland League. He married twice. He was first married to Audrey Crump on April Fool's Day, 1 April 1957. They had two children. He later married a second time, to Janice, who survived him. Showbusiness career Following his retirement from football in 1959, Williams tried his hand as a singer in local working men's clubs, but it was his comic chat between the songs that was best received, so he decided to move into comedy full-time. He eventually became Britain's first well-known black television comedian. He came to prominence from 1971, when he began appearing regularly on The Comedians. The show broadcast stand-up routines from relatively unknown but often very experienced club comedians, including Frank Carson, Mike Reid and Bernard Manning. The novel combination of a black man with a Yorkshire accent and his first-hand experience of life in the British working class made him unmistakable. Williams' comedy was often at his own expense, and particularly his colour. He used to respond to heckling by saying: \\"If you don't shut up, I'll come and move in next door to you\\".Obituary , The Independent, 4 September 2006. Like other popular comedians of his era, his comedy included jokes about \\"Pakis\\" and \\"coons\\". His reinforcement of his audience's prejudices and negative race stereotypes was perhaps a necessary product of the environment and time in which his career began, typified by a resurgent National Front, a minstrelsy variety show in the form of The Black and White Minstrel Show on the BBC, and the sitcom Love Thy Neighbour, in which he appeared as himself in one of the episodes, which were made by Thames Television for the National ITV network. Nevertheless, he was a role model for a new generation of British black comedians, such as Lenny Henry and Gary Wilmot, growing up in the 1970s, when almost all others were white. Broadcaster Dotun Adebayo wrote a 2012 play Skinteeth on the theme of Williams' comedy perpetuating 1970s stereotypes of black people.'Skinteeth' a new play starring Dotun Adebayo He reached the pinnacle of his comedy career in the early 1970s. In 1972, he spent a six-month season at the London Palladium; presented his own show, It's Charlie Williams, on Granada Television; appeared on This Is Your Life when he was surprised by Eamonn Andrews at the Batley Variety Club; and appeared at the Royal Variety Performance. In 1973, he presented a one-off special Charlie Williams Show on BBC2, The Charlie Williams Show from the BBC Guide to Comedy. and published an autobiography, Ee-I've Had Some Laughs. He was popular enough at this time to be featured as the star of his own one page comic strip in IPC's Shiver and Shake comic at this time. He was also the host of ATV's popular game show The Golden Shot for a six-month period from late 1973 to early 1974, although he often struggled to hold together this fast moving live show, and it ultimately had a detrimental effect on his career. In 1974 he released the Single ' Ta Luv ' , on the Pye Records Label, taken from The Good Companions musical. In 1976, Williams toured Rhodesia, and appeared before audiences at packed nightclubs in Salisbury. At that time the white minority rule government of Rhodesia had unilaterally declared independence from Britain, which had severed all ties with the Rhodesian government. By the late 1970s and early 1980s, his brand of humour was becoming old-fashioned, and his career declined. He caused offence to some, and praised by others, for defending the Robertson's Golliwog trade mark, and for saying that immigrants to the United Kingdom should conform to the British way of life. He retired after a final tour in 1995. Later life Williams was appointed a Member of the Order of the British Empire (MBE) in 1999 for his charity work. He was given a lifetime achievement award at the Black Comedy Awards in 2000, where it was recognised that he had \\"broken down barriers\\". In 2004, he was voted Doncaster Rovers' \\"all-time cult hero\\" by viewers of the BBC's Football Focus programme. Williams suffered from Parkinson's disease in his later life, and died on 2 September 2006, aged 78.

He is a French mastermind and criminal genius. Publication history The Brain first appeared in Doom Patrol #86 (March 1964) and was created by Arnold Drake and Bruno Premiani. Drake later commented: \\"I used that same concept in a Jerry Lewis comic book, and in a Bob Hope comic I had a totem pole that talked to him. Often times, I wrote the same storylines for the comedy stuff that I wrote for the serious stuff. I just turned it on its head\\". Fictional character biography As a scientist, the Brain performs experiments on animals to raise their intelligence. One of these is on a gorilla, who he names Monsieur Mallah and educates for almost a decade before making him his personal assistant. His colleague, Niles Caulder grows jealous of his work and arranges for the Brain to get caught in an explosion, which destroys his body. Only the brain survives, which Caulder plans on putting into a robotic body. Mallah rescues the Brain, transferring him to a computer network that keeps him functioning. The Brain and Mallah form the Brotherhood of Evil in hopes of conquering the world and getting revenge on Caulder. Caulder, now known as the \\"Chief\\", through a series of other accidents that he manipulated, forms the Doom Patrol (Caulder's involvement in the events which transformed the Doom Patrol, and the Brain, was a retcon decades after the creation of the Doom Patrol and the Brain; originally the incidents were genuine accidents). The Brain, Mallah, and their Brotherhood's criminal activities also pit them against the Teen Titans. The Brotherhood go against the newly formed Justice League, with the Brain using a genetic splicer to take the Flash's legs, Green Lantern's ring, Black Canary's vocal chords, and the Martian Manhunter's eyes.JLA: Year One #5 The Brain is defeated by the League and the Doom Patrol, the League using cybernetic implants created by Niles Caulder to compensate for their lost powers. Aquaman is thrown to the Brain, overpowers his control of the ring, and separates the Brain from his makeshift body.JLA: Year One #6 Art from Doom Patrol #34, by Richard Case. During Grant Morrison's Doom Patrol run, Mallah places the Brain in Robotman's new body (Robotman's brain had been removed from it due to its malfunctioning). In his new body, the Brain confesses to Mallah he is in love with him. When Mallah reveals he feels the same way, the two kiss. However, Robotman's body, having developed sentience and vowed never to be enslaved by a brain again, triggers a self-destruct mechanism and explodes as they kiss.Doom Patrol (vol. 2) #34 (July 1990) The two later resurface (the Brain back to floating in a jar), with no explanation of how they survived the explosion. The Brotherhood begins raiding genetic research facilities to unlock the secrets of cloning and create a new body for the Brain, so he and Monsieur Mallah can resume their romance.Teen Titans (vol. 3) #34 (May 2006)Teen Titans (vol. 3) #35 (June 2006)Teen Titans (vol. 3) #36 (July 2006) After a short while the Brain's new clone body begins to break down, so he has Mallah rip off his head and put his brain back into another jar.Teen Titans (vol. 3) #37 (August 2006) In the Salvation Run storyline, Brain and Monsieur Mallah appear amongst the villains that were sent to the planet Cygnus 4019. An altercation between Monsieur Mallah and Gorilla Grodd ends with Grodd beating Monsieur Mallah to death with Brain's chassis, also killing Brain in the process.Salvation Run #1-7 (January‚ÄìJuly 2008) In September 2011, The New 52 rebooted DC's continuity. In an alternate future of this new timeline, Brain and Monsieur Mallah assist Gorilla Grodd in taking over the remains of Central City at the time when The Black had taken over most of the world. They capture Animal Man and the heroes that are with him. Animal Man's group is saved by Frankenstein and his Patchwork Army.Animal Man Vol. 2 #15 He reappears in DC Rebirth Titans. Where the Brotherhood worked together on a narcotic element which is then distributed to the addict population of New York City.Titans Vol. 2 #19 The designer drug, Bliss; in actuality was designed to put people in a fugue state so Brain could use their dormant mental capacity as a type of cloud space to expand his own intellect into godlike territories.Titans Vol. 2 #20 In record time, the duo spearheaded their opiate both from a purer sample that they created. And through faulty counterfeits fabricated by the rival underlife, both having purposely leaked the original formula on the black market, then enlisted the mercenary Cheshire to steal back their original concoction while furthering the goal of expanding Brain's intelligence.Titans Vol. 2 #21 As his acumen began to reach hyper- genius levels of intellectual capacity. The Brain began to physically transcend his mortal coil at varying percentages over time, 10-15% enabling him to solve unsolvable mathematic formulas while masking his and Monsieur Mallah's operation, 23% giving him power over climate change and weather patterns, 47% enabling natural disaster & cosmological force phenomena manipulation and so on and so forth. As his mental abilities increased more and more with time he situated ecological catastrophes as bait to lure his enemies in the Justice League towards various traps while he worked towards achieving transcendent consciousness.Titans Vol. 2 #22 His ascent to godhood also came with the side effect of nullifying his empathy; becoming personally distant from the humanistic coil such as relations and his dearest confidante. To that end Mallah betrayed Brain to the Titans before he could reshape reality to his own ends, ending the threat he posed for good.Titans Vol. 2 Annual #2 Powers and abilities One of the most formidable villains ever encountered by the Doom Patrol, or even in DC Comics, The Brain is more of a cerebral opponent but all the more dangerous for it. A former polymath, The Brain has a genius-level IQ which he puts to use as a criminal mastermind and is more than capable of plotting out perfect crimes. The Brain is completely single-minded and motivated almost entirely towards the domination of others, the committing of even more perfect crimes, and ultimate revenge against Niles Caulder. Adept in psychology, he is also a master of coercion, deceit, and manipulation, being able to persuade almost anybody to do his dirty work for him, even to the point where his agents are under the illusion that they are not actually committing evil or immoral acts. It is, however, hinted that it is a result of mind control through telepathy by The Brain. It was through these cerebral abilities that The Brain was able to unite various villains under his leadership, forming the Brotherhood of Evil. Although others often act as brawns to his brain, most notably his assistant‚Äìpartner Monsieur Mallah, The Brain has occasionally used agile robotic bodies to give him mobility. The different contraptions which have been seen to hold his brain were designed by The Brain himself (also a master in biology and robotics) and have proved time and time again to be durable and even nigh-indestructible. On the rare occasion when The Brain has been vulnerable without robotic protection or assistance from other villains, he has protected himself by attacking opponents through telekinesis. Except for the times when he possesses robot bodies, the Brain is portrayed as an ordinary human brain, albeit housed within what could be described as a life-sized chess piece which contains the equipment required to keep him alive; it is this portrayal that was adapted in the animated versions of the Brain as mentioned in this article. In the original Doom Patrol series, he was regularly portrayed as a disembodied brain, bobbing inside a sealed dome filled with a nutrient bath, hooked up with numerous machines, including a loudspeaker to convey his voice. During a confrontation with the newly-formed Justice League and the Doom Patrol, the Brain used genetics equipment provided by the mysterious Locus organization to 'steal' the Martian Manhunter's eyes, Black Canary's vocal cords, the Flash's legs, and Green Lantern's right arm, granting him access to the Manhunter's vision abilities, Canary's sonic scream, the Flash's speed, and Green Lantern's power ring. However, during this time he was only ever shown using the ring and was caught off-guard by its vulnerability to yellow, with Aquaman eventually managing to overpower the Brain's will and use the ring to sever him from his makeshift body. In Rebirth, The Brain found a way to increase his intelligence by tapping some several hundred thousand people's vacant thought spaces to achieve mental divinity. Not only showcasing increased cognizant genius but obtaining various superpowers accessed via the power of his mind alone as a result.Titans Vol. 2 #19-22 Having solved Ordlich's heuristic paradox and deciphered the Voynich manuscript while masking his whereabouts from outside detection, changing and manipulating weather patterns via remote climate alteration, engineering natural disasters, manipulating cosmic & quantum force, casting himself into technology alla Cyborg-Superman, twist space/time and manipulating reality by sheer force of will. Other characters named Brain DC Comics previously had other villains named the Brain: The first villain was an ordinary criminal who earned his nickname for his cleverness and was not literally just a brain. He alongside Captain Bigg, Hopper, False-Face and Rattler were one of five small-time villains hired by Black Star to commit a bank robbery. They were all foiled by the Seven Soldiers of Victory.Leading Comics #2 (Spring 1942) The second villain to use the name Brain was a crime boss who fought Flash.Flash Comics #78 (December 1946) The third villain to use the name Brain is a criminal mastermind who fought Superman.Superman #83 (July 1953) Brain was also the alias used by three identical brothers who commit crimes while the city has been distracted by three giant boxes they have placed in each other after a fog has descended on the city, which the authorities try to open. The Flash jails the first two as they attempt robberies with clever tricks, like a tightrope which the first one cuts and spring-heeled shoes, and jails the last one when he attempts a bank robbery by draining his live wire suit with which he intended to break his brothers out with silver. It is then revealed the last box led into the bank vault.Showcase #8 Other versions =Other Earths= In Earth-S the Brain is a man named Warden Loomis and in the Earth- Two there are two unnamed Brains. =Smallville= In Smallville season 11, The Brain appears on the back of Monsieur Mallah, robbing the Mus√©e du Louvre. They are both taken down by Superman, and Impulse. In this version, Brain and Mallah are revealed to be lovers.Smallville Season 11 #9 In other media =Television= * An episode of The Superman/Aquaman Hour of Adventure was titled \\"The Brain, the Brave and the Bold\\", in which Aquaman battles a supervillain named the \\"Brain\\". * The Brain appears as the main antagonist of the fifth and final season of the Teen Titans animated series, voiced by Glenn Shadix in a computer-altered voice. His appearance is very similar to a Dalek, major antagonists in the British science fiction television series Doctor Who, and indeed the producers of Teen Titans mentioned the British show in interviews about Season Five. When interviewed at the unofficial Transformers convention TFCon, Derrick J. Wyatt stated that the Brain was a \\"Total Dalek\\", claiming that he even talked like one, and the resemblance was intentional. Like Mallah, his sexuality was not mentioned due to the targeted young audience. Considered the leader of the Brotherhood of Evil, he (like his comic counterpart) is a brain preserved in a robotic jar. The Brain seems to do very little during the series, and acts behind the scenes coordinating the villain attacks. When he appears in his secret base, he is frequently seen playing chess with Mallah and comparing it to the game of wits he considers himself to be playing against Robin. In the rare instances where he himself fights, he appears to possess limited telekinetic and telepathic abilities. He is otherwise defenseless and an easy target several times in the series, not even able to defend against a slap on the back from Beast Boy. As a result of his defenselessness from a physical standpoint, he relies almost entirely on his evil subordinates to carry out his plans. With himself providing the strategy and intelligence, this reliance proves mostly justified in the episode \\"Calling All Titans\\". In this episode, the Brain uses a stolen Teen Titans communicator (Robin's, to be precise, who gave it to Madame Rouge thinking she was Hot Spot) to track down and capture every honorary Teen Titan by sending villains to capture them. In most cases, the Brain is able to provide exactly the evil opponent (or more than one opponent) needed to capture any hero. The Brain seems unable to adapt to any possible holes in his plan, and this flaw costs him in the episode \\"Titans Together\\" as the remaining heroes infiltrate his base to free the captured heroes. In a last-ditch effort to escape when the tables turn, he detaches the skull jar from the rest of his body, simultaneously turning it into a fusion device to blow up his base so he could escape (saying that sometimes the best strategy is to \\"clear the field\\"), which he immediately activates. As he gets alarmingly close to leaving the now-ravaged Brotherhood base, the Brain is knocked off the scaffold by Beast Boy, which Robin retrieves seconds before the jar smashes onto the ground, and is subsequently flash-frozen by Beast Boy. * Brain appears in the Batman: The Brave and the Bold episode \\"Journey to the Center of the Bat!\\", voiced by Dee Bradley Baker in a French accent. He controls Chemo and uses him to attack a Bialyan city. The brain later has a cameo in the episode of \\"Deep Cover for Batman!\\". He joins Owlman and other villains in the following episode, but is defeated in a psychic battle against an alternate universe version of Batman. Unlike in his Teen Titans appearance, the Brain shows emotion and openly mocks Batman as he attempts to fight him. Besides his psychic powers, he displays a variety of weapons mounted on extendable robot arms. In \\"The Last Patrol!\\", he and Monsieur Mallah target the Chief, noting his old rivalry with him, only to end up fighting Batman. He and Monsieur Mallah are later defeated on General Zahl's ship. * Brain appears in Young Justice, voiced by Nolan North in the first appearance and by Corey Burton in all subsequent appearances; with both voice actors using a French accent. In \\"Revelation\\", it is revealed that Brain is L-6 of The Light (Project Cadmus' Board of Directors). In \\"Summit\\", Brain and Monsieur Mallah join the Light in a summit with the Reach within the caves of Santa Prisca. During a three-way fight between the Team, the Light, and the Reach, Impulse defeats Brain by disarming him of his weapons. * Brain appears in the Teen Titans Go! episode \\"Brian\\", voiced by Scott Menville. He captures the Teen Titans in order to steal their powers and fuel his Project B.R.I.A.N. (Brain's Robotic Indestructible Armor Nexus). A recurring gag in that episode is that the Teen Titans thought that Brain's name is Brian. This causes the little buddies of the Teen Titans to end up saving the Teen Titans and defeating Brain. The Brain returns in the episode ‚Äú40%40%20%‚Äù, wielding a new four-armed spider mech body. Here, he captures the other Titans while Cyborg is trying to break his addiction/dependence on his favorite song, \\"The Night Begins to Shine\\". During Cyborg's song-induced fantasy, the Brain tries to stop him using a giant stone mech and an army of flying punk zombies. With Monsieur Mallah's help, the Brain is able to destroy Cyborg's tape, rendering him powerless, but the other Titans sing the song for Cyborg to give him his strength back, allowing him to defeat Mallah and the Brain. * Brain appears in the Justice League Action episode \\"The Brain Buster\\", voiced by Jim Ward. He alongside Batman, Mister Terrific, Lex Luthor, and Calculator are abducted by Mister Mind posing as a cosmic being to see who is the more intellectual of the group by having them partake in three challenges. * In the Doom Patrol episode \\"Doom Patrol Patrol\\", Brain's Ultimax form was one of the villains that the original Doom Patrol fought. Steve Dayton has kept his robotic body, but has claimed that the brain escaped. =Video games= * Brain appears in DC Universe Online, voiced by Leif Anders. * Brain appears as a final boss in the DS version of Batman: The Brave and the Bold ‚Äì The Videogame. * The Brain has a cameo appearance in Injustice: Gods Among Us. He is seen in the Insurgency Level where he is placed next to Lex Luthor's battlesuit. * The Brain appears in Lego DC Super-Villains. He is unplayable but appears on Monsieur Mallah's back whenever the player selects Mallah. =Miscellaneous= * Brain made an appearance in issue #29 and a cameo in the Teen Titans Go! comic book series. * Although he never appeared in Justice League himself, a version of the Brain from this continuity appeared in a comic story based on the series, where the League faked an elaborate 'auction' to lure all of their villains into one place. When the Brain realizes what is happening, he attempts to deduce which members of the auction are actually League members in disguise, but his deductions are thwarted by the assumption that Superman, Batman and Wonder Woman were not among the League members (being seemingly frozen in time by Chronos) and he only had to track down Flash, Green Lantern, Hawkgirl and Martian Manhunter, when in reality even Chronos's role was faked (Chronos being a disguised Batman) and the League capture the villains. Brain and Mallah were both taken out after Wonder Woman, disguised as Catwoman, threw them into Metallo.

This control system included interlocks to close the throttle valve at the end of trip and to prevent opening the throttle again until the winding engine was reversed. The control system also incorporated a governor to control the speed of the hoist and indicator wheels to show the hoist operator the positions of the skips in the mine shaft. The hoist controllers for modern electric mining hoists have long included such features as automatic starting of the hoist when the weight of coal or ore in the skip reaches a set point, automatic acceleration of the hoist to full speed and automatic deceleration at the end of travel.H.K.

Formal definition  Let (M, g) and (N, h) be two Riemannian manifolds and f:Mto N a (surjective) submersion, i.e., a fibered manifold. The horizontal distribution mathrm{ker}(df)^{perp} is a sub-bundle of the tangent bundle of TM which depends both on the projection f and on the metric g. Then, f is called a Riemannian submersion if and only if the isomorphism df : mathrm{ker}(df)^{perp} rightarrow TN is an isometry. Examples An example of a Riemannian submersion arises when a Lie group G acts isometrically, freely and properly on a Riemannian manifold (M,g). The projection pi: M rightarrow N to the quotient space N = M /G equipped with the quotient metric is a Riemannian submersion. For example, component-wise multiplication on S^3 subset mathbb{C}^2 by the group of unit complex numbers yields the Hopf fibration. Properties The sectional curvature of the target space of a Riemannian submersion can be calculated from the curvature of the total space by O'Neill's formula, named for Barrett O'Neill: :K_N(X,Y)=K_M(tilde X, tilde Y)+tfrac34[tilde X,tilde Y]^V^2 where X,Y are orthonormal vector fields on N, tilde X, tilde Y their horizontal lifts to M, [*,*] is the Lie bracket of vector fields and Z^V is the projection of the vector field Z to the vertical distribution. In particular the lower bound for the sectional curvature of N is at least as big as the lower bound for the sectional curvature of M.

The protagonists of the sketch are Lisa Loopner (played by Gilda Radner) and Todd DiLaMuca (played by Bill Murray), whose repart√©e with one another would be the focus of the sketch, and regular character Mrs. Loopner (played by Jane Curtin), Lisa's mother, in whose home the sketches were usually set. Virtually all the time Mrs. Loopner, a widow, would wear a housecoat. She often referred to her \\"wifely duties\\" concerning her late husband, and told Lisa Loopner to \\"...go warm up the Gremlin...\\" before they went out somewhere. Todd would often give Lisa noogies by getting her in a headlock and knocking her on the top of the head, and a regular element of the sketches would be Todd making fun of her flat chest. He'd look down her shirt to see whether there were \\"any new developments\\" and then make a disparaging comment such as \\"Better put some Band-Aids on those mosquito bites,\\" to which Lisa's weary reply was often \\"That's so funny I forgot to laugh,\\" or \\"The last time I heard that I fell off my dinosaur\\". Todd's name was originally given as \\"Todd LaBounta\\", but was changed in later sketches after legal action was threatened by a real person with that name. When the earlier LaBounta \\"Nerd\\" sketches were re-run on repeat SNL broadcasts, the audio was re-edited so that Todd's last name was not heard. Guest stars included Michael Palin, who played Mr. Brighton, Lisa's piano teacher with an uncontrollable libido, in two sketches; Buck Henry as Todd's father, Marshall; and Steve Martin as Todd's rival Chas the Spaz. In 1979, the series producers came up with a sketch in the series titled \\"Nerds' Nativity\\". Intended to be aired three days before Christmas Day, the sketch was a source of friction between the show's producer, Lorne Michaels, and NBC's standards department. The standards department contended that it was inappropriate to spoof the nativity of Jesus; the producer countered that in fact the sketch was spoofing nativity plays. In the end, the sketch was broadcast, although with some of the dialogue cut, resulting in viewers sending letters of complaint to the program.

Definition and elementary properties  Let (X,d) be a metric space. A geodesic ray is a path gamma : [0,infty) to X which minimizes distance everywhere along its length. i.e., for all t,t' in [0,infty), :dbig(gamma(t), gamma(t') big) = big t - t' big. Equivalently, a ray is an isometry from the \\"canonical ray\\" (the set [0,infty) equipped with the Euclidean metric) into the metric space X. Given a ray Œ≥, the Busemann function B_gamma : X to mathbb R is defined by :B_gamma(x)=lim_{ttoinfty}big(dbig( gamma(t), x big) - t big) Thus, when t is very large, the distance dbig( gamma(t), x big) is approximately equal to t - B_gamma(x). Given a ray Œ≥, its Busemann function is always well- defined: indeed the right hand side Ft(x) above tends pointwise to the left hand side on compacta, since t-d( gamma(t), x )=d(gamma(t),gamma(0)) - d(gamma(t),x) is bounded above by d(gamma(0),x) and increasing since, if sle t, :t-s + d(x,gamma(s)) - d(x,gamma(t)) ge t -s -d (gamma(s),gamma(t)) = 0. It is immediate from the triangle inequality that :B_gamma(x) - B_gamma(y)le d(x,y), so that B_gamma is uniformly continuous. More specifically, the above estimate above shows that *Busemann functions are Lipschitz functions with constant 1. By Dini's theorem, the functions F_t(x)=d(x,gamma(t)) -t tend to B_gamma(x) uniformly on compact sets as t tends to infinity.  Example: Poincar√© disk  Let D be the unit disk in the complex plane with the Poincar√© metric : ds^2 = {4 ,dz^2 over (1 - z^2)^2}. Then, for z < 1 and Œ∂ = 1, the Busemann function is given by : B_zeta(z) = - log , left({1 - z^2over z - zeta^2}right), where the term in brackets on the right hand side is the Poisson kernel for the unit disk and Œ∂ corresponds to the radial geodesic Œ≥ from the origin towards Œ∂, Œ≥(t) = Œ∂ tanh(t/2). The computation of d(x,y) can be reduced to that of d(z,0) = d(z,0) = tanh‚àí1 z = log (1+z)/(1-z), since the metric is invariant under M√∂bius transformations in SU(1,1); the geodesics through 0 have the form Œ∂ gt(0) where gt is the 1-parameter subgroup of SU(1,1) :g_t=begin{pmatrix}cosh t/2 & sinh t/2  sinh t/2 & cosh t/2end{pmatrix}. The formula above also completely determines the Busemann function by M√∂bius invariance. Note that : {1 - z^2over z - zeta^2} le {1-z^2over (1-z)^2} = 1 -left({zover 1 - z}right)^2 le 1, so that the Busemann function in this case is non-negative. Busemann functions on a Hadamard space In a Hadamard space, where any two points are joined by a unique geodesic segment, the function F = Ft is convex, i.e. convex on geodesic segments [x,y]. Explicitly this means that if z(s) is the point which divides [x,y] in the ratio , then F(z(s)) ‚â§ s F(x) + (1 ‚àí s) F(y). For fixed a the function d(x,a) is convex and hence so are its translates; in particular, if Œ≥ is a geodesic ray in X, then Ft is convex. Since the Busemann function BŒ≥ is the pointwise limit of Ft, *Busemann functions are convex on Hadamard spaces. *On a Hadamard space, the functions F_t(y)=d(y,gamma(t)) -t converge uniformly to B_gamma uniformly on any bounded subset of X. Let . Since Œ≥(t) is parametrised by arclength, Alexandrov's first comparison theorem for Hadamard spaces implies that the function is convex. Hence for 0< s < t :g(s) le (1-{sover t})g(0) + {sover t} g(t). Thus :2sh(s)le (h(s) +s)^2 - s^2 =g(s) le (1-{sover t})d(x,y)^2 + {sover t} ( 2th(t) +h(t)^2 )le d(x,y)^2 + 2s h(t) +{sover t} d(x,y)^2, so that :F_s(y) - F_t(y)= h(s) - h(t) le {1over 2} (s^{-1} + t^{-1}) d(x,y)^2. Letting t tend to ‚àû, it follows that :F_s(y) - B_gamma(y) le {d(x,y)^2over 2s}, so convergence is uniform on bounded sets. Note that the inequality above for F_s(y) - F_t(y) (together with its proof) also holds for geodesic segments: if Œì(t) is a geodesic segment starting at x and parametrised by arclength then :d(y,Gamma(s)) -s -d(y,Gamma(t)) +t le (s^{-1} + t^{-1}) d(x,y)^2. Next suppose that x, y are points in a Hadamard space, and let Œ¥(s) be the geodesic through x with Œ¥(0) = y and Œ¥(t) = x, where t = d(x,y). This geodesic cuts the boundary of the closed ball (y,r) at the point Œ¥(r). Thus if , there is a point v with such that . This condition persists for Busemann functions. The statement and proof of the property for Busemann functions relies on a fundamental theorem on closed convex subsets of a Hadamard space, which generalises orthogonal projection in a Hilbert space: if is a closed convex set in a Hadamard space , then every point in has a unique closest point in and ; moreover is uniquely determined by the property that, for in , :d(x,y)^2 ge d(x,a) ^2 + d(a,y)^2, so that the angle at in the Euclidean comparison triangle for a,x,y is greater than or equal to /2. *If h is a Busemann function on a Hadamard space, then, given y in X and r > 0, there is a unique point v with d(y,v) = r such that h(v) = h(y) ‚àí r. For fixed r > 0, the point v is the closest point of y to the closed convex C set of points u such that h(u) ‚â§ h(y) ‚àí r and therefore depends continuously on y. Let v be the closest point to y in C. Then h(v) = h(y) ‚àí r and so h is minimised by v in (y,R) where R = d(y,v) and v is the unique point where h is minimised. By the Lipschitz condition r = h(y) ‚àí h(v) ‚â§ R. To prove the assertion, it suffices to show that R = r, i.e. d(y,v) = r. On the other hand, h is the uniform limit on any closed ball of functions hn. On (y,r), these are minimised by points vn with hn(vn) = hn(y) ‚àí r. Hence the infimum of h on (y,r) is h(y) ‚àí r and h(vn) tends to h(y) ‚àí r. Thus h(vn) = h(y) ‚àí rn with rn ‚â§ r and rn tending towards r. Let un be the closest point to y with h(un) ‚â§ h(y) ‚àí rn. Let Rn = d(y,un) ‚â§ r. Then h(un) = h(y) ‚àí rn, and, by the Lipschitz condition on h, Rn ‚â• rn. In particular Rn tends to r. Passing to a subsequence if necessary it can be assumed that rn and Rn are both increasing (to r). The inequality for convex optimisation implies that for n > m. : d(u_n,u_m)^2 le R_n^2 - R_m^2le 2rR_n -R_m, so that un is a Cauchy sequence. If u is its limit, then d(y,u) = r and h(u) = h(y) ‚àí r. By uniqueness it follows that u = v and hence d(y,v) = r, as required. Uniform limits. The above argument proves more generally that if d(xn,x0) tends to infinity and the functions hn(x) = d(x,xn) ‚Äì d(xn,x0) tend uniformly on bounded sets to h(x), then h is convex, Lipschitz with Lipschitz constant 1 and, given y in X and r > 0, there is a unique point v with d(y,v) = r such that h(v) = h(y) ‚àí r. If on the other hand the sequence (xn) is bounded, then the terms all lie in some closed ball and uniform convergence there implies that (xn) is a Cauchy sequence so converges to some x‚àû in X. So hn tends uniformly to h‚àû(x) = d(x,x‚àû) ‚Äì d(x‚àû,x0), a function of the same form. The same argument also shows that the class of functions which satisfy the same three conditions (being convex, Lipschitz and having minima on closed balls) is closed under taking uniform limits on bounded sets. Comment. Note that, since any closed convex subset of a Hadamard subset of a Hadamard space is also a Hadamard space, any closed ball in a Hadamard space is a Hadamard space. In particular it need not be the case that every geodesic segment is contained in a geodesic defined on the whole of R or even a semi-infinite interval [0,‚àû). The closed unit ball of a Hilbert space gives an explicit example which is not a proper metric space. *If h is a convex function, Lipschitz with constant 1 and h assumes its minimum on any closed ball centred on y with radius r at a unique point v on the boundary with h(v) = h(y) ‚àí r, then for each y in X there is a unique geodesic ray Œ¥ such that Œ¥(0) = y and Œ¥ cuts each closed convex set h ‚â§ h(y) ‚Äì r with r > 0 at Œ¥(r), so that h(Œ¥(t)) = h(y) ‚Äì t. In particular this holds for each Busemann function. The third condition implies that v is the closest point to y in the closed convex set Cr of points u such that h(u) ‚â§ h(y) ‚Äì r. Let Œ¥(t) for 0 ‚â§ t ‚â§ r be the geodesic joining y to v. Then k(t) = h(Œ¥(t)) - h(y) is a convex Lipschitz function on [0,r] with Lipschitz constant 1 satisfying k(t) ‚â§ ‚Äì t and k(0) = 0 and k(r) = ‚Äìr. So k vanishes everywhere, since if 0 < s < r, k(s) ‚â§ ‚Äìs and k(s) ‚â§ s. Hence h(Œ¥(t)) = h(y) ‚Äì t. By uniqueness it follows that Œ¥(t) is the closest point to y in Ct and that it is the unique point minimising h in (y,t). Uniqueness implies that these geodesics segments coincide for arbitrary r and therefore that Œ¥ extends to a geodesic ray with the stated property. *If h = hŒ≥ , then the geodesic ray Œ¥ starting at y satisfies sup d(gamma(t),delta(t)) < infty. If Œ¥1 is another ray starting at y with sup d(delta(t),delta_1(t)) < infty then Œ¥1 = Œ¥. To prove the first assertion, it is enough to check this for t sufficiently large. In that case Œ≥(t) and Œ¥(t ‚àí h(y)) are the projections of x and y onto the closed convex set . Therefore, d(Œ≥(t),Œ¥(t ‚àí h(y))) ‚â§ d(x,y). Hence d(Œ≥(t),Œ¥(t)) ‚â§ d(Œ≥(t),Œ¥(t ‚àí h(y))) + d(Œ¥(t ‚àí h(y)),Œ¥(t)) ‚â§ d(x,y) + h(y). The second assertion follows because d(Œ¥1(t),Œ¥(t)) is convex and bounded on [0,‚àû), so, if it vanishes at t = 0, must vanish everywhere. *Suppose that h is a continuous convex function and for each y in X there is a unique geodesic ray Œ¥ such that Œ¥(0) = y and Œ¥ cuts each closed convex set h ‚â§ h(y) ‚Äì r with r > 0 at Œ¥(r), so that h(Œ¥(t)) = h(y) ‚Äì t; then h is a Busemann function. h ‚àí hŒ¥ is a constant function. Let Cr be the closed convex set of points z with h(z) ‚â§ ‚àír. Since X is a Hadamard space for every point y in X there is a unique closest point Pr(y) to y in Cr. It depends continuously on y and if y lies outside Cr, then Pr(y) lies on the hypersurface h(z) = ‚àí r‚Äîthe boundary ‚àÇCr of Cr‚Äîand Pr(y) satisfies the inequality of convex optimisation. Let Œ¥(s) be the geodesic ray starting at y. Fix x in X. Let Œ≥(s) be the geodesic ray starting at x. Let g(z) = hŒ≥(z), the Busemann function for Œ≥ with base point x. In particular g(x) = 0. It suffices to show that . Now take y with h(x) = h(y) and let Œ¥(t) be the geodesic ray starting at y corresponding to h. Then :d(x,y) ge d(gamma(t),delta(t)),,,, d(x,delta(t))^2 ge d(x,gamma(t))^2+d(gamma(t),delta(t))^2,,,,d(y,gamma(t))^2 ge d(y,delta(t))^2+d(gamma(t),delta(t))^2. On the other hand, for any four points a, b, c, d in a Hadamard space, the following quadrilateral inequality of Reshetnyak holds: : d(a,c)^2 + d(b,d)^2 - d(a,d)^2 - d(b,d)^2le 2 d(a,b)d(c,d). Setting a = x, b = y, c = Œ≥(t), d = Œ¥(t), it follows that :d(y,gamma(t))^2 - d(x,delta(t))^2le 2d(x,y)^2, so that :d(y,gamma(t)) - d(x,gamma(t))le 2 {d(x,y)^2over d(y,gamma(t)) + d(x,gamma(t))}le {d(x,y)^2over t}. Hence hŒ≥(y) = 0. Similarly hŒ¥(x) = 0. Hence hŒ≥(y) = 0 on the level surface of h containing x. Now for t ‚â• 0 and z in X, let Œ±t(z) = Œ≥1(t) the geodesic ray starting at z. Then and . Moreover, by boundedness, . The flow Œ±s can be used to transport this result to all the level surfaces of h. For general y1, if h(y1) < h(x), take s > 0 such that h(Œ±s(x)) = h(y1) and set x1 = Œ±s(x). Then hŒ≥1(y1) = 0, where Œ≥1(t) = Œ±t(x1) = Œ≥(s + t). But then hŒ≥1 = hŒ≥ ‚Äì s, so that hŒ≥(y1) = s. Hence , as required. Similarly if h(y1) > h(x), take s > 0 such that h(Œ±s(y1)) = h(x). Let y = Œ±s(y1). Then hŒ≥(y) = 0, so hŒ≥(y1) = ‚Äìs. Hence , as required. Finally there are necessary and sufficient conditions for two geodesics to define the same Busemann function up to constant: *On a Hadamard space, the Busemann functions of two geodesic rays gamma_1 and gamma_2 differ by a constant if and only if sup_{tge 0} d(gamma_1(t),gamma_2(t)) < infty. Suppose firstly that Œ≥ and Œ¥ are two geodesic rays with Busemann functions differing by a constant. Shifting the argument of one of the geodesics by a constant, it may be assumed that BŒ≥ = BŒ¥ = B, say. Let C be the closed convex set on which B(x) ‚â§ ‚àír. Then B(Œ≥(t)) = BŒ≥(Œ≥(t)) = ‚àít and similarly B(Œ¥(t)) = ‚àí t. Then for s ‚â§ r, the points Œ≥(s) and Œ¥(s) have closest points Œ≥(r) and Œ¥(r) in C, so that d(Œ≥(r), Œ¥(r)) ‚â§ d(Œ≥(s), Œ¥(s)). Hence . Now suppose that . Let Œ¥i(t) be the geodesic ray starting at y associated with hŒ≥i. Then . Hence . Since Œ¥1 and Œ¥2 both start at y, it follows that Œ¥1(t) ‚â° Œ¥2(t). By the previous result hŒ≥i and hŒ¥i differ by a constant; so hŒ≥1 and hŒ≥2 differ by a constant. To summarise, the above results give the following characterisation of Busemann functions on a Hadamard space: THEOREM. On a Hadamard space, the following conditions on a function f are equivalent: *h is a Busemann function. *h is a convex function, Lipschitz with constant 1 and h assumes its minimum on any closed ball centred on y with radius r at a unique point v on the boundary with h(v) = h(y) ‚àí r. *h is a continuous convex function and for each y in X there is a unique geodesic ray Œ¥ such that Œ¥(0) = y and, for any r >0, the ray Œ¥ cuts each closed convex set h ‚â§ h(y) ‚Äì r at Œ¥(r). Bordification of a Hadamard space In the previous section it was shown that if X is a Hadamard space and x0 is a fixed point in X then the union of the space of Busemann functions vanishing at x0 and the space of functions hy(x) = d(x,y) ‚àí d(x0,y) is closed under taking uniform limits on bounded sets. This result can be formalised in the notion of bordification of X. In this topology, the points xn tend to a geodesic ray Œ≥ starting at x0 if and only if d(x0,xn) tends to ‚àû and for t > 0 arbitrarily large the sequence obtained by taking the point on each segment [x0,xn] at a distance t from x0 tends to Œ≥(t). If X is a metric space, Gromov's bordification can be defined as follows. Fix a point x0 in X and let XN = (x0,N). Let Y = C(X) be the space of Lipschitz continuous functions on X, .e. those for which f(x) ‚Äì f(y) ‚â§ A d(x,y) for some constant A > 0. The space Y can be topologised by the seminorms fN = supXN f, the topology of uniform convergence on bounded sets. The seminorms are finite by the Lipschitz conditions. This is the topology induced by the natural map of C(X) into the direct product of the Banach spaces Cb(XN) of continuous bounded functions on XN. It is give by the metric D(f,g) = ‚àë 2‚àíN f ‚àí gN(1 +f ‚àí gN)‚àí1. The space X is embedded into Y by sending x to the function fx(y) = d(y,x) ‚Äì d(x0,x). Let be the closure of X in Y. Then is metrisable, since Y is, and contains X as an open subset; moreover bordifications arising from different choices of basepoint are naturally homeomorphic. Let h(x) = (d(x,x0) + 1)‚àí1. Then h lies in C0(X). It is non-zero on X and vanishes only at ‚àû. Hence it extends to a continuous function on with zero set  X. It follows that  X is closed in , as required. To check that = (x0) is independent of the basepoint, it suffices to show that k(x) = d(x,x0) ‚àí d(x,x1) extends to a continuous function on . But k(x) = fx(x1), so, for g in , k(g) = g(x1). Hence the correspondence between the compactifications for x0 and x1 is given by sending g in (x0) to g + g(x1)1 in (x1). When X is a Hadamard space, Gromov's ideal boundary ‚àÇX =  X can be realised explicitly as \\"asymptotic limits\\" of geodesic rays using Busemann functions. If xn is an unbounded sequence in X with hn(x) = d(x,xn) ‚àí d(xn,x0) tending to h in Y, then h vanishes at x0, is convex, Lipschitz with Lipschitz constant 1 and has minimum h(y) ‚àí r on any closed ball (y,r). Hence h is a Busemann function BŒ≥ corresponding to a unique geodesic ray Œ≥ starting at x0. On the other hand, hn tends to BŒ≥ uniformly on bounded sets if and only if d(x0,xn) tends to ‚àû and for t > 0 arbitrarily large the sequence obtained by taking the point on each segment [x0,xn] at a distance t from x0 tends to Œ≥(t). For d(x0,xn) ‚â• t, let xn(t) be the point in [x0,xn] with d(x0,xn(t)) = t. Suppose first that hn tends to BŒ≥ uniformly on (x0,R). Then for t ‚â§ R, hn(Œ≥(t)) ‚Äì BŒ≥(Œ≥(t))=d(Œ≥(t),xn) ‚Äì d(xn,x0) + t. This is a convex function. It vanishes as t = 0 and hence is increasing. So it is maximised at t = R. So for each t, d(Œ≥(t),xn) ‚Äì d(xn,x0) ‚Äì t tends towards 0. Let a = X0, b = Œ≥(t) and c = xn. Then d(c,a) ‚Äì d(c,b) is close to d(a,b) with d(c,a) large. Hence in the Euclidean comparison triangle CA - CB is close to AB with CA large. So the angle at A is small. So the point D on AC at the same distance as AB lies close to B. Hence, by the first comparison theorem for geodesic triangles, d(xn(t),Œ≥(t)) is small. Conversely suppose that for fixed t and n sufficiently large d(xn(t),Œ≥(t)) tends to 0. Then from the above Fs(y) = d(y,Œ≥(s)) ‚Äì s satisfies :F_s(y) - B_gamma(y) le {d(x_0,y)^2over 2s}, so it suffices show that on any bounded set hn(y) = d(y,xn) ‚Äì d(x0,xn) is uniformly close to Fs(y) for n sufficiently large. For a fixed ball (x0,R), fix s so that R2/s ‚â§ Œµ. The claim is then an immediate consequence of the inequality for geodesic segments in a Hadamard space, since :d(y,x_n) -d(y,x_0) - d(y,x_n(s)) + s le {d(x_0,y)^2over s} le varepsilon. Hence, if y in (x0,R) and n is sufficiently large that d(xn(s),Œ≥(s)) ‚â§ Œµ, then :h_n(y)-B_gamma(y)=d(y,x_n) -d(y,x_0) - B_gamma(y) le d(y,x_n) -d(y,x_0) - d(y,x_n(s)) + s  + d(x_n(s),gamma(s)) + F_s(y) - B_gamma(y) le 3varepsilon.  Busemann functions on a Hadamard manifold  Suppose that x, y are points in a Hadamard manifold and let Œ≥(s) be the geodesic through x with Œ≥(0) = y. This geodesic cuts the boundary of the closed ball (y,r) at the two points Œ≥(¬±r). Thus if d(x,y) > r, there are points u, v with d(y,u) = d(y,v) = r such that d(x,u) ‚àí d(x,v) = 2r. By continuity this condition persists for Busemann functions: *If h is a Busemann function on a Hadamard manifold, then, given y in X and r > 0, there are unique points u, v with d(y,u) = d(y,v) = r such that h(u) = h(y) + r and h(v) = h(y) ‚àí r. For fixed r > 0, the points u and v depend continuously on y. Taking a sequence tn tending to ‚àû and hn = Ftn, there are points un and vn which satisfy these conditions for hn for n sufficiently large. Passing to a subsequence if necessary, it can be assumed that un and vn tend to u and v. By continuity these points satisfy the conditions for h. To prove uniqueness, note that by compactness h assumes its maximum and minimum on (y,r). The Lipschitz condition shows that the values of h there differ by at most 2r. Hence h is minimized at v and maximized at u. On the other hand, d(u,v) = 2r and for u and v the points v and u are the unique points in (y,r) maximizing this distance. The Lipschitz condition on h then immediately implies u and v must be the unique points in (y,r) maximizing and minimizing h. Now suppose that yn tends to y. Then the corresponding points un and vn lie in a closed ball so admit convergent subsequences. But by uniqueness of u and v any such subsequences must tend to u and v, so that un and vn must tend to u and v, establishing continuity. The above result holds more generally in a Hadamard space. *If h is a Busemann function on a Hadamard manifold, then h is continuously differentiable with dh(y) = 1 for all y. From the previous properties of h, for each y there is a unique geodesic Œ≥(t) parametrised by arclength with Œ≥(0) = y such that . It has the property that it cuts ‚àÇB(y,r) at t = ¬±r: in the previous notation Œ≥(r) = u and Œ≥(‚Äìr) = v. The vector field Vh defined by the unit vector dot{gamma}(0) at y is continuous, because u is a continuous function of y and the map sending (x,v) to (x,expx v) is a diffeomorphism from TX onto X √ó X by the Cartan-Hadamard theorem. Let Œ¥(s) be another geodesic parametrised by arclength through y with Œ¥(0) = y. Then dh ‚àò Œ¥ (0)/ ds = (dot{delta}(0),dot{gamma}(0)). Indeed, let H(x) = h(x) ‚àí h(y), so that H(y) = 0. Then : H(delta(s)) - H(x) le d(delta(s),x). Applying this with x = u and v, it follows that for s > 0 :(r- d(delta(s),u))/s le (h(delta(s)) - h(y))/s le (d(delta(s),v) -r)/s. The outer terms tend to (dot{delta}(0),dot{gamma}(0)) as s tends to 0, so the middle term has the same limit, as claimed. A similar argument applies for s < 0. The assertion on the outer terms follows from the first variation formula for arclength, but can be deduced directly as follows. Let a=dot{delta}(0) and b=dot{gamma}(0), both unit vectors. Then for tangent vectors p and q at y in the unit ballIn geodesic normal coordinates, the metric g(x) = I + Œµ x. By geodesic convexity, a geodesic from p to q lies in the ball of radius r = max p, q. The straight line segment gives an upper estimate for d(p,q) of the stated form. To obtain a similar lower estimate, observe that if c(t) is a smooth path from p to q, then L(c) ‚â• (1 ‚àí Œµ r) ‚ãÖ ‚à´  c'  dt ‚â• (1 ‚àí Œµ r) ‚ãÖ p ‚àí q. (Note that these inequalities can be improved using the sharper estimate g(x) = I + Œµ x2.) :d(exp_y p,exp_y q) = p-q + varepsilon max p^2, q^2 with Œµ uniformly bounded. Let s = t3 and r = t2. Then :(d(delta(s),v) -r)/s= (d(exp_y(t^3 a),exp_y(-t^2 b)) - t^2)/t^3 = (t^3a +t^2b - t^2)/t^3 + varepsilon t= (ta +b -1)/t + varepsilon t. The right hand side here tends to (a,b) as t tends to 0 since : {dover dt} b + t a_{t=0 }= {1over 2} ,{dover dt} b + t a^2_{t=0} = (a,b). The same method works for the other terms. Hence it follows that h is a C1 function with dh dual to the vector field Vh, so that dh(y) = 1. The vector field Vh is thus the gradient vector field for h. The geodesics through any point are the flow lines for the flow Œ±t for Vh, so that Œ±t is the gradient flow for h. THEOREM. On a Hadamard manifold X the following conditions on a continuous function h are equivalent: # h is a Busemann function. # h is a convex, Lipschitz function with constant 1, and for each y in X there are points u¬± at a distance r from y such that h(u¬±) = h(y) ¬± r. # h is a convex C1 function with dh(x) ‚â° 1. It has already been proved that (1) implies (2). The arguments above show mutatis mutandi that (2) implies (3). It therefore remains to show that (3) implies (1). Fix x in X. Let Œ±t be the gradient flow for h. It follows that and that is a geodesic through x parametrised by arclength with . Indeed, if s < t, then :s-t=h(alpha_s(x))-h(alpha_t(x)) le d(alpha_s(x),alpha_t(x))le int_{s}^t dalpha_tau(x)/dtau , dtau =int_s^t dh(alpha_tau(x)) , dtau = s-t, so that d(Œ≥(s),Œ≥(t)) = s ‚àí t. Let g(y) = hŒ≥(y), the Busemann function for Œ≥ with base point x. In particular g(x) = 0. To prove (1), it suffices to show that g = h ‚Äì h(x)1. Let C(‚àír) be the closed convex set of points z with h(z) ‚â§ ‚àír. Since X is a Hadamard space for every point y in X there is a unique closest point Pr(y) to y in C(-r). It depends continuously on y and if y lies outside C(-r), then Pr(y) lies on the hypersurface h(z) = ‚àí r‚Äîthe boundary ‚àÇC(‚Äìr) of C(‚Äìr)‚Äîand the geodesic from y to Pr(y) is orthogonal to ‚àÇC(‚Äìr). In this case the geodesic is just Œ±t(y). Indeed, the fact that Œ±t is the gradient flow of h and the conditions dh(y) ‚â° 1 imply that the flow lines Œ±t(y) are geodesics parametrised by arclength and cut the level curves of h orthogonally. Taking y with h(y) = h(x) and t > 0, :d(x,y) ge d(alpha_t(x),alpha_t(y)),,,, d(x,alpha_t(y))^2 ge d(x,alpha_t(x))^2+d(alpha_t(x),alpha_t(y))^2,,,,d(y,alpha_t(x))^2 ge d(y,alpha_t(y))^2+d(alpha_t(x),alpha_t(y))^2. On the other hand, for any four points a, b, c, d in a Hadamard space, the following quadrilateral inequality of Reshetnyak holds: : d(a,c)^2 + d(b,d)^2 - d(a,d)^2 - d(b,d)^2le 2 d(a,b)d(c,d). Setting a = x, b = y, c = Œ±t(x), d = Œ±t(y), it follows that :d(y,alpha_t(x))^2 - d(x,alpha_t(x))^2le 2d(x,y)^2, so that :d(y,alpha_t(x)) - d(x,alpha_t(x))le 2 {d(x,y)^2over d(y,alpha_t(x)) + d(x,alpha_t(x))}le {d(x,y)^2over t}. Hence hŒ≥(y) = 0 on the level surface of h containing x. The flow Œ±s can be used to transport this result to all the level surfaces of h. For general y1 take s such that h(Œ±s(x)) = h(y1) and set x1 = Œ±s(x). Then hŒ≥1(y1) = 0, where Œ≥1(t) = Œ±t(x1) = Œ≥(s + t). But then hŒ≥1 = hŒ≥ ‚Äì s, so that hŒ≥(y1) = s. Hence , as required. Note that this argument could be shortened using the fact that two Busemann functions hŒ≥ and hŒ¥ differ by a constant if and only if the corresponding geodesic rays satisfy supt ‚â• 0 d(Œ≥(t),Œ¥(t)) < ‚àû. Indeed, all the geodesics defined by the flow Œ±t satisfy the latter condition, so differ by constants. Since along any of these geodesics h is linear with derivative 1, h must differ from these Busemann functions by constants. Compactification of a proper Hadamard space defined a compactification of a Hadamard manifold X which uses Busemann functions. Their construction, which can be extended more generally to proper (i.e. locally compact) Hadamard spaces, gives an explicit geometric realisation of a compactification defined by Gromov‚Äîby adding an \\"ideal boundary\\"‚Äîfor the more general class of proper metric spaces X, those for which every closed ball is compact. Note that, since any Cauchy sequence is contained in a closed ball, any proper metric space is automatically complete.Note that a metric space X which is complete and locally compact need not be proper, for example R with the metric d(x,y) = x ‚Äì y/(1 + x ‚Äì y). On the other hand, by the Hopf‚ÄìRinow theorem for metric spaces, if X is complete, locally compact and geodesic‚Äîevery two points x and y are joined by a geodesic parametrised by arclength‚Äîthen X is proper (see ). Indeed if not, there is a point x in X and a closed ball K = (x,r) maximal subject to being compact; then, since by hypothesis (x,R) is non-compact for each R > r, a diagonal argument shows that there is a sequence (xn) with d(x,xn) decreasing to r but with no convergent subsequence; on the other hand taking yn on a geodesic joining x and xn, with d(x,yn) = r, compactness of K implies (yn), and hence (xn), has a convergent subsequence, a contradiction. The ideal boundary is a special case of the ideal boundary for a metric space. In the case of Hadamard spaces, this agrees with the space of geodesic rays emanating from any fixed point described using Busemann functions in the bordification of the space. If X is a proper metric space, Gromov's compactification can be defined as follows. Fix a point x0 in X and let XN = (x0,N). Let Y = C(X) be the space of Lipschitz continuous functions on X, .e. those for which f(x) ‚Äì f(y) ‚â§ A d(x,y) for some constant A > 0. The space Y can be topologised by the seminorms fN = supXN f, the topology of uniform convergence on compacta. This is the topology induced by the natural map of C(X) into the direct product of the Banach spaces C(XN). It is give by the metric D(f,g) = ‚àë 2‚àíN f ‚àí gN(1 +f ‚àí gN)‚àí1. The space X is embedded into Y by sending x to the function fx(y) = d(y,x) ‚Äì d(x0,x). Let be the closure of X in Y. Then is compact (metrisable) and contains X as an open subset; moreover compactifications arising from different choices of basepoint are naturally homeomorphic. Compactness follows from the Arzel√†‚ÄìAscoli theorem since the image in C(XN) is equicontinuous and uniformly bounded in norm by N. Let xn be a sequence in X ‚äÇ tending to y in  X. Then all but finitely many terms must lie outside XN since XN is compact, so that any subsequence would converge to a point in XN; so the sequence xn must be unbounded in X. Let h(x) = (d(x,x0) + 1)‚àí1. Then h lies in C0(X). It is non- zero on X and vanishes only at ‚àû. Hence it extends to a continuous function on with zero set  X. It follows that  X is closed in , as required. To check that the compactification = (x0) is independent of the basepoint, it suffices to show that k(x) = d(x,x0) ‚àí d(x,x1) extends to a continuous function on . But k(x) = fx(x1), so, for g in , k(g) = g(x1). Hence the correspondence between the compactifications for x0 and x1 is given by sending g in (x0) to g + g(x1)1 in (x1). When X is a Hadamard manifold (or more generally a proper Hadamard space), Gromov's ideal boundary ‚àÇX =  X can be realised explicitly as \\"asymptotic limits\\" of geodesics by using Busemann functions. Fixing a base point x0, there is a unique geodesic Œ≥(t) parametrised by arclength such that Œ≥(0) = x0 and dot{gamma}(0) is a given unit vector. If BŒ≥ is the corresponding Busemann function, then BŒ≥ lies in ‚àÇX(x0) and induces a homeomorphism of the unit (n ‚àí 1)-sphere onto ‚àÇX(x0), sending dot{gamma}(0) to BŒ≥.  Quasigeodesics in the Poincar√© disk, CAT(-1) and hyperbolic spaces =Morse‚ÄìMostow lemma= In the case of spaces of negative curvature, such as the Poincar√© disk, CAT(-1) and hyperbolic spaces, there is a metric structure on their Gromov boundary. This structure is preserved by the group of quasi- isometries which carry geodesics rays to quasigeodesic rays. Quasigeodesics were first studied for negatively curved surfaces‚Äîin particular the hyperbolic upper halfplane and unit disk‚Äîby Morse and generalised to negatively curved symmetric spaces by Mostow, for his work on the rigidity of discrete groups. The basic result is the Morse‚ÄìMostow lemma on the stability of geodesics. By definition a quasigeodesic Œì defined on an interval [a,b] with ‚àí‚àû ‚â§ a < b ‚â§ ‚àû is a map Œì(t) into a metric space, not necessarily continuous, for which there are constants Œª ‚â• 1 and Œµ > 0 such that for all s and t: :lambda^{-1} s-t - varepsilon le d(Gamma(s),Gamma(t)) le lambda s-t + varepsilon. The following result is essentially due to Marston Morse (1924). Morse's lemma on stability of geodesics. In the hyperbolic disk there is a constant R depending on Œª and Œµ such that any quasigeodesic segment Œì defined on a finite interval [a,b] is within a Hausdorff distance R of the geodesic segment [Œì(a),Œì(b)]. =Classical proof for Poincar√© disk= The classical proof of Morse's lemma for the Poincar√© unit disk or upper halfplane proceeds more directly by using orthogonal projection onto the geodesic segment. *It can be assumed that Œì satisfies the stronger \\"pseudo-geodesic\\" condition: ::lambda^{-1}s-t -varepsilon le d(Gamma(s),Gamma(t)) le lambda s-t. Œì can be replaced by a continuous piecewise geodesic curve Œî with the same endpoints lying at a finite Hausdorff distance from Œì less than c = (2Œª2 + 1)Œµ: break up the interval on which Œì is defined into equal subintervals of length 2ŒªŒµ and take the geodesics between the images under Œì of the endpoints of the subintervals. Since Œî is piecewise geodesic, Œî is Lipschitz continuous with constant Œª1, d(Œî(s),Œî(t)) ‚â§ Œª1s ‚Äì t, where Œª1 ‚â§ Œª + Œµ. The lower bound is automatic at the endpoints of intervals. By construction the other values differ from these by a uniformly bounded depending only on Œª and Œµ; the lower bound inequality holds by increasing Œµ by adding on twice this uniform bound. *If Œ≥ is a piecewise smooth curve segment lying outside an s-neighbourhood of a geodesic line and P is the orthogonal projection onto the geodesic line then:, Lemma 4 ::ell(P circ gamma) le {ell(gamma)over cosh s}. Applying an isometry in the upper half plane, it may be assumed that the geodesic line is the positive imaginary axis in which case the orthogonal projection onto it is given by P(z) = iz and z / Im z = cosh d(z,Pz). Hence the hypothesis implies Œ≥(t) ‚â• cosh(s) Im Œ≥(t), so that :: ell(Pcircgamma) = int_a^b {dgammaover gamma} le int_a^b {dgammaover cosh(s), Im gamma}={ell(gamma)over cosh(s)}. *There is a constant h > 0 depending only on Œª and Œµ such that Œì[a,b] lies within an h-neighbourhood of the geodesic segment [Œì(a),Œì(b)]., Lemmas 5‚Äì6 Let Œ≥(t) be the geodesic line containing the geodesic segment [Œì(a),Œì(b)]. Then there is a constant h > 0 depending only on Œª and Œµ such that h-neighbourhood Œì[a,b] lies within an h-neighbourhood of Œ≥(R). Indeed for any s > 0, the subset of [a,b] for which Œì(t) lies outside the closure of the s-neighbourhood of Œ≥(R) is open, so a countable union of open intervals (c,d). Then ::ell(Gamma_{[c,d]}) le s_1 equiv lambda^2 (2s +varepsilon) left(1 -{lambda^2over cosh(s)}right), :since the left hand side is less than or equal to Œªc ‚Äì d and ::{c-dover lambda} -varepsilon le d(Gamma(c),Gamma(d)) le 2s + d(P circ Gamma_{[c,d]}) le 2s + {lambda c-dovercosh(s)}. :Hence every point lies at a distance less than or equal to s + s1 of Œ≥(R). To deduce the assertion, note that the subset of [a,b] for which Œì(t) lies outside the closure of the s-neighbourhood of [Œì(a),Œì(b)] ‚äÇ Œ≥(R) is open, so a union of intervals (c,d) with Œì(c) and Œì(d) both at a distance s + s1 from either Œì(a) or Œì(b). Then ::ell(Gamma_{[c,d]}) le s_2 equiv lambda^2(2(s + s_1) + varepsilon), :since ::{c-dover lambda} -varepsilon le d(Gamma(c),Gamma(d)) le 2(s+s_1). :Hence the assertion follows taking any h greater than s +s1 + s2. *There is a constant h > 0 depending only on Œª and Œµ such that the geodesic segment [Œì(a),Œì(b)] lies within an h-neighbourhood of Œì[a,b]. Every point of Œì[a,b] lies within a distance h of [Œì(a),Œì(b)]. Thus orthogonal projection P carries each point of Œì[a,b] onto a point in the closed convex set [Œì(a),Œì(b)] at a distance less than h. Since P is continuous and Œì[a,b] connected, the map P must be onto since the image contains the endpoints of [Œì(a),Œì(b)]. But then every point of [Œì(a),Œì(b)] is within a distance h of a point of Œì[a,b]. =Gromov's proof for Poincar√© disk = The generalisation of Morse's lemma to CAT(-1) spaces is often referred to as the Morse‚ÄìMostow lemma and can be proved by a straightforward generalisation of the classical proof. There is also a generalisation for the more general class of hyperbolic metric spaces due to Gromov. Gromov's proof is given below for the Poincar√© unit disk; the properties of hyperbolic metric spaces are developed in the course of the proof, so that it applies mutatis mutandi to CAT(-1) or hyperbolic metric spaces. Since this is a large-scale phenomenon, it is enough to check that any maps Œî from {0, 1, 2, ..., N} for any N > 0 to the disk satisfying the inequalities is within a Hausdorff distance R1 of the geodesic segment [Œî(0),Œî(N)]. For then translating it may be assumed without loss of generality Œì is defined on [0,r] with r > 1 and then, taking N = [r] (the integer part of r), the result can be applied to Œî defined by Œî(i) = Œì(i). The Hausdorff distance between the images of Œì and Œî is evidently bounded by a constant R2 depending only on Œª and Œµ. :Now the incircle of a geodesic triangle has diameter less than Œ¥ where Œ¥ = 2 log 3; indeed it is strictly maximised by that of an ideal triangle where it equals 2 log 3. In particular, since the incircle breaks the triangle breaks the triangle into three isosceles triangles with the third side opposite the vertex of the original triangle having length less than Œ¥, it follows that every side of a geodesic triangle is contained in a Œ¥-neighbourhood of the other two sides. A simple induction argument shows that a geodesic polygon with 2k + 2 vertices for k ‚â• 0 has each side within a neighbourhood of the other sides (such a polygon is made by combining two geodesic polygons with sides along a common side). Hence if , the same estimate holds for a polygon with M sides. :For yi = Œî(i) let f(x) = min d(x,yi), the largest radius for a closed ball centred on x which contains no yi in its interior. This is a continuous function non-zero on [Œî(0),Œî(N)] so attains its maximum h at some point x in this segment. Then [Œî(0),Œî(N)] lies within an h1-neighbourhood of the image of Œî for any h1 > h. It therefore suffices to find an upper bound for h independent of N. :Choose y and z in the segment [Œî(0),Œî(N)] before and after x with d(x,y) = 2h and d(x,z) = 2h (or an endpoint if it within a distance of less than 2h from x). Then there are i, j with d(y,Œî(i)), d(z,Œî(j)) ‚â§ h. Hence d(Œî(i),Œî(j)) ‚â§ 6h, so that i ‚àí j ‚â§ 6Œªh + ŒªŒµ. By the triangle inequality all points on the segments [y,Œî(i)] and [z,Œî(j)] are at a distance ‚â• h from x. Thus there is a finite sequence of points starting at y and ending at z, lying first on the segment [y,Œî(i)], then proceeding through the points Œî(i), Œî(i+1), ..., Œî(j), before taking the segment [Œî(j),z]. The successive points Œî(i), Œî(i+1), ..., Œî(j) are separated by a distance no greater than Œª + Œµ and successive points on the geodesic segments can also be chosen to satisfy this condition. The minimum number K of points in such a sequence satisfies K ‚â§ i - j + 3 + 2(Œª + Œµ)‚Äì1h. These points form a geodesic polygon, with [y,z] as one of the sides. Take L = [h/Œ¥], so that the (L ‚àí 1)Œ¥-neighbourhood of [y,z] does not contain all the other sides of the polygon. Hence, from the result above, it follows that K > 2L ‚àí 1 + 2. Hence :3 + 2(lambda+varepsilon)^{-1}h + 6lambda h + varepsilon> 2^{h/delta} + 2. :This inequality implies that h is uniformly bounded, independently of N, as claimed. :If all points Œî(i) lie within h1 of the [Œî(0),Œî(N)], the result follows. Otherwise the points which do not fall into maximal subsets S = {r, ..., s} with r < s. Thus points in [Œî(0),Œî(N)] have a point Œî(i) with i in the complement of S within a distance of h1. But the complement of S = S1 ‚àê S2, a disjoint union with S1 = {0, ..., r ‚àí 1} and S2 = {s + 1, ..., N}. Connectivity of [Œî(0),Œî(N)] implies there is a point x in the segment which is within a distance h1 of points Œî(i) and Œî(j) with i < r and j > s. But then d(Œî(i),Œî(j)) < 2 h1, so i ‚àí j ‚â§ 2Œªh1 + ŒªŒµ. Hence the points Œî(k) for k in S lie within a distance from [Œî(0),Œî(N)] of less than h1 + Œªi ‚àí j + Œµ ‚â§ h1 + Œª (2Œªh1 + ŒªŒµ) + Œµ ‚â° h2. =Extension to quasigeodesic rays and lines= Recall that in a Hadamard space if [a1,b1] and [a2,b2] are two geodesic segments and the intermediate points c1(t) and c2(t) divide them in the ratio t:(1 ‚Äì t), then d(c1(t),c2(t)) is a convex function of t. In particular if Œì1(t) and Œì2(t) are geodesic segments of unit speed defined on [0,R] starting at the same point then :d(Gamma_1(t),Gamma_2(t)) le {tover R} d(Gamma_1(R),Gamma_2(R)). In particular this implies the following: *In a CAT(‚Äì1) space X, there is a constant h > 0 depending only on Œª and Œµ such that any quasi-geodesic ray is within a bounded Hausdorff distance h of a geodesic ray. A similar result holds for quasigeodesic and geodesic lines. If Œì(t) is a geodesic say with constant Œª and Œµ, let ŒìN(t) be the unit speed geodesic for the segment [Œì(0),Œì(N)]. The estimate above shows that for fixed R > 0 and N sufficiently large, (ŒìN) is a Cauchy sequence in C([0,R],X) with the uniform metric. Thus ŒìN tends to a geodesic ray Œ≥ uniformly on compacta the bound on the Hausdorff distances between Œì and the segments ŒìN applies also to the limiting geodesic Œ≥. The assertion for quasigeodesic lines follows by taking ŒìN corresponding to the geodesic segment [Œì(‚ÄìN),Œì(N)].  Efremovich‚ÄìTikhomirova theorem  Before discussing CAT(-1) spaces, this section will describe the Efremovich‚ÄìTikhomirova theorem for the unit disk D with the Poincar√© metric. It asserts that quasi-isometries of D extend to quasi-M√∂bius homeomorphisms of the unit disk with the Euclidean metric. The theorem forms the prototype for the more general theory of CAT(-1) spaces. Their original theorem was proved in a slightly less general and less precise form in and applied to bi-Lipschitz homeomorphisms of the unit disk for the Poincar√© metric;Bi-Lipschitz homeomorphisms are those for which they and their inverses are Lipschitz continuous earlier, in the posthumous paper , the Japanese mathematician Akira Mori had proved a related result within Teichm√ºller theory assuring that every quasiconformal homeomorphism of the disk is H√∂lder continuous and therefore extends continuously to a homeomorphism of the unit circle (it is known that this extension is quasi- M√∂bius).See: =Extension of quasi-isometries to boundary = If X is the Poincar√© unit disk, or more generally a CAT(-1) space, the Morse lemma on stability of quasigeodesics implies that every quasi-isometry of X extends uniquely to the boundary. By definition two self-mappings f, g of X are quasi- equivalent if supX d(f(x),g(x)) < ‚àû, so that corresponding points are at a uniformly bounded distance of each other. A quasi-isometry f1 of X is a self- mapping of X, not necessarily continuous, which has a quasi-inverse f2 such that f1 ‚àò f2 and f2 ‚àò f1 are quasi-equivalent to the appropriate identity maps and such that there are constants Œª ‚â• 1 and Œµ > 0 such that for all x, y in X and both mappings : lambda^{-1} d(x,y) - varepsilon le d(f_k(x),f_k(y)) le lambda d(x,y) +varepsilon. Note that quasi-inverses are unique up to quasi- equivalence; that equivalent definition could be given using possibly different right and left-quasi inverses, but they would necessarily be quasi- equivalent; that quasi-isometries are closed under composition which up to quasi-equivalence depends only the quasi-equivalence classes; and that, modulo quasi-equivalence, the quasi-isometries form a group.See:  * Fixing a point x in X, given a geodesic ray Œ≥ starting at x, the image f ‚àò Œ≥ under a quasi-isometry f is a quasi-geodesic ray. By the Morse-Mostow lemma it is within a bounded distance of a unique geodesic ray Œ¥ starting at x. This defines a mapping ‚àÇf on the boundary ‚àÇX of X, independent of the quasi- equivalence class of f, such that ‚àÇ(f ‚àò g) = ‚àÇf ‚àò ‚àÇg. Thus there is a homomorphism of the group of quasi-isometries into the group of self-mappings of ‚àÇX. To check that ‚àÇf is continuous, note that if Œ≥1 and Œ≥2 are geodesic rays that are uniformly close on [0,R], within a distance Œ∑, then f ‚àò Œ≥1 and f ‚àò Œ≥2 lie within a distance ŒªŒ∑ + Œµ on [0,R], so that Œ¥1 and Œ¥2 lie within a distance ŒªŒ∑ + Œµ + 2h(Œª,Œµ); hence on a smaller interval [0,r], Œ¥1 and Œ¥2 lie within a distance (r/R)‚ãÖ[ŒªŒ∑ + Œµ + 2h(Œª,Œµ)] by convexity. On CAT(-1) spaces, a finer version of continuity asserts that ‚àÇf is a quasi-M√∂bius mapping with respect to a natural class of metric on ‚àÇX, the \\"visual metrics\\" generalising the Euclidean metric on the unit circle and its transforms under the M√∂bius group. These visual metrics can be defined in terms of Busemann functions.See:  In the case of the unit disk, Teichm√ºller theory implies that the homomorphism carries quasiconformal homeomorphisms of the disk onto the group of quasi-M√∂bius homeomorphisms of the circle (using for example the Ahlfors‚ÄìBeurling or Douady‚ÄìEarle extension): it follows that the homomorphism from the quasi-isometry group into the quasi-M√∂bius group is surjective. In the other direction, it is straightforward to prove that the homomorphism is injective. Suppose that f is a quasi-isometry of the unit disk such that ‚àÇf is the identity. The assumption and the Morse lemma implies that if Œ≥(R) is a geodesic line, then f(Œ≥(R)) lies in an h-neighbourhood of Œ≥(R). Now take a second geodesic line Œ¥ such that Œ¥ and Œ≥ intersect orthogonally at a given point in a. Then f(a) lies in the intersection of h-neighbourhoods of Œ¥ and Œ≥. Applying a M√∂bius transformation, it can be assumed that a is at the origin of the unit disk and the geodesics are the real and imaginary axes. By convexity, the h-neighbourhoods of these axes intersect in a 3h-neighbourhood of the origin: if z lies in both neighbourhoods, let x and y be the orthogonal projections of z onto the x- and y-axes; then so taking projections onto the y-axis, ; hence . Hence , so that f is quasi-equivalent to the identity, as claimed. =Cross ratio and distance between non-intersecting geodesic lines= Given two distinct points z, w on the unit circle or real axis there is a unique hyperbolic geodesic [z,w] joining them. It is given by the circle (or straight line) which cuts the unit circle unit circle or real axis orthogonally at those two points. Given four distinct points a, b, c, d in the extended complex plane their cross ratio is defined by :(a,b;c,d) ={(a-c)(b-d)over (a-d)(b-c)}. If g is a complex M√∂bius transformation then it leaves the cross ratio invariant: . Since the M√∂bius group acts simply transitively on triples of points, the cross ratio can alternatively be described as the complex number z in C{0,1} such that g(a) = 0, g(b) = 1, g(c) = Œª, g(d) = ‚àû for a M√∂bius transformation g. Since a, b, c and d all appear in the numerator defining the cross ratio, to understand the behaviour of the cross ratio under permutations of a, b, c and d, it suffices to consider permutations that fix d, so only permute a, b and c. The cross ratio transforms according to the anharmonic group of order 6 generated by the M√∂bius transformations sending Œª to 1 ‚Äì Œª and Œª‚àí1. The other three transformations send Œª to 1 ‚Äì Œª‚àí1, to Œª(Œª ‚Äì 1)‚àí1 and to (1 ‚Äì Œª)‚àí1. Note that there is a natural homomorphism of S4 onto S3, acting by conjugation on (a,b)(c,d), (a,c)(b,d) and (a,d)(b,c). Indeed these permutations together with the identty form a normal Abelian subgroup equal to its own centraliser: the action of S4 by conjugation on the non-trivial elements yields the homomorphism onto S3. Now let a, b, c, d be points on the unit circle or real axis in that order. Then the geodesics [a,b] and [c,d] do not intersect and the distance between these geodesics is well defined: there is a unique geodesic line cutting these two geodesics orthogonally and the distance is given by the length of the geodesic segment between them. It is evidently invariant under real M√∂bius transformations. To compare the cross ratio and the distance between geodesics, M√∂bius invariance allows the calculation to be reduced to a symmetric configuration. For 0 < r < R, take a = ‚ÄìR, b = ‚àír, c = r, d = R. Then where t = R/r > 1. On the other hand, the geodesics [a,d] and [b,c] are the semicircles in the upper half plane of radius r and R. The geodesic which cuts them orthogonally is the positive imaginary axis, so the distance between them is the hyperbolic distance between ir and iR, d(ir,iR) = log R/r = log t. Let s = log t, then Œª = cosh2(s/2), so that there is a constant C > 0 such that, if (a,b;c,d) > 1, then :d([a,d];[b,c]) - C le log (a,b;c,d) le d([a,d];[b,c]) + C, since log[cosh(x)/expx)] = log (1 + exp(‚Äì2x))/2 is bounded above and below in x ‚â• 0. Note that a, b,c, d are in order around the unit circle if and only if (a,b;c,d) > 1. A more general and precise geometric interpretation of the cross ratio can be given using projections of ideal points on to a geodesic line; it does not depend on the order of the points on the circle and therefore whether or not geodesic lines intersect.See: If p and q are the feet of the perpendiculars from c and d to the geodesic line ab, then d(p,q) = log (a,b;c,d). Since both sides are invariant under M√∂bius transformations, it suffices to check this in the case that a = 0, b = ‚àû, c = x and d = 1. In this case the geodesic line is the positive imaginary axis, right hand side equals log x, p = xi and q = i. So the left hand side equals logx. Note that p and q are also the points where the incircles of the ideal triangles abc and abd touch ab. =Proof of theorem= A homeomorphism F of the circle is quasisymmetric if there are constants a, b > 0 such that :displaystyle{{F(z_1)-F(z_2)over F(z_1)-F(z_3)} le a {z_1-z_2^bover z_1-z_3^b}.} It is ''quasi-M√∂bius'' is there are constants ''c'', ''d'' > 0 such that :displaystyle{(F(z_1),F(z_2);F(z_3),F(z_4)) le c (z_1,z_2;z_3,z_4)^d,} where :displaystyle{ (z_1,z_2;z_3,z_4)={(z_1-z_3)(z_2-z_4)over(z_2-z_3)(z_1-z_4)}} denotes the cross-ratio. It is immediate that quasisymmetric and quasi-M√∂bius homeomorphisms are closed under the operations of inversion and composition. If F is quasisymmetric then it is also quasi-M√∂bius, with c = a2 and d = b: this follows by multiplying the first inequality for (z1,z3,z4) and (z2,z4,z3). Conversely any quasi-M√∂bius homeomorphism F is quasisymmetric. To see this, it can be first be checked that F (and hence F‚àí1) is H√∂lder continuous. Let S be the set of cube roots of unity, so that if a ‚â† b in S, then a ‚àí b = 2 sin /3 = . To prove a H√∂lder estimate, it can be assumed that x ‚Äì y is uniformly small. Then both x and y are greater than a fixed distance away from a, b in S with a ‚â† b, so the estimate follows by applying the quasi- M√∂bius inequality to x, a, y, b. To verify that F is quasisymmetric, it suffices to find a uniform upper bound for F(x) ‚àí F(y) / F(x) ‚àí F(z) in the case of a triple with x ‚àí z = x ‚àí y, uniformly small. In this case there is a point w at a distance greater than 1 from x, y and z. Applying the quasi-M√∂bius inequality to x, w, y and z yields the required upper bound. To summarise: * A homeomorphism of the circle is quasi-M√∂bius if and only if it is quasisymmetric. In this case it and its inverse are H√∂lder continuous. The quasi-M√∂bius homeomorphisms form a group under composition. To prove the theorem it suffices to prove that if F = ‚àÇf then there are constants A, B > 0 such that for a, b, c, d distinct points on the unit circle :displaystyle{(F(a),F(b);F(c),F(d)) le A (a,b;c,d)^B.} It has already been checked that F (and is inverse) are continuous. Composing f, and hence F, with complex conjugation if necessary, it can further be assumed that F preserves the orientation of the circle. In this case, if a,b, c,d are in order on the circle, so too are there images under F; hence both (a,b;c,d) and (F(a),F(b);F(c),F(d)) are real and greater than one. In this case :(F(a),F(b);F(c),F(d)) le A (a,b;c,d)^B. To prove this, it suffices to show that . From the previous section it suffices show . This follows from the fact that the images under f of [a,b] and [c,d] lie within h-neighbourhoods of [F(a),F(b)] and [F(c),F(d)]; the minimal distance can be estimated using the quasi-isometry constants for f applied to the points on [a,b] and [c,d] realising d([a,b],[c,d]). Adjusting A and B if necessary, the inequality above applies also to F‚àí1. Replacing a, b, c and d by their images under F, it follows that :A^{-1} (a,b;c,d)^{-B} le (F(a),F(b);F(c),F(d)) le A (a,b;c,d)^B if a, b, c and d are in order on the unit circle. Hence the same inequalities are valid for the three cyclic of the quadruple a, b, c, d. If a and b are switched then the cross ratios are sent to their inverses, so lie between 0 and 1; similarly if c and d are switched. If both pairs are switched, the cross ratio remains unaltered. Hence the inequalities are also valid in this case. Finally if b and c are interchanged, the cross ratio changes from Œª to , which lies between 0 and 1. Hence again the same inequalities are valid. It is easy to check that using these transformations the inequalities are valid for all possible permutations of a, b, c and d, so that F and its inverse are quasi-M√∂bius homeomorphisms.  Busemann functions and visual metrics for CAT(-1) spaces Busemann functions can be used to determine special visual metrics on the class of CAT(-1) spaces. These are complete geodesic metric spaces in which the distances between points on the boundary of a geodesic triangle are less than or equal to the comparison triangle in the hyperbolic upper half plane or equivalently the unit disk with the Poincar√© metric. In the case of the unit disk the chordal metric can be recovered directly using Busemann functions BŒ≥ and the special theory for the disk generalises completely to any proper CAT(-1) space X. The hyperbolic upper half plane is a CAT(0) space, as lengths in a hyperbolic geodesic triangle are less than lengths in the Euclidean comparison triangle: in particular a CAT(-1) space is a CAT(0) space, so the theory of Busemann functions and the Gromov boundary applies. From the theory of the hyperbolic disk, it follows in particular that every geodesic ray in a CAT(-1) space extends to a geodesic line and given two points of the boundary there is a unique geodesic Œ≥ such that has these points as the limits Œ≥(¬±‚àû). The theory applies equally well to any CAT(‚àíŒ∫) space with Œ∫ > 0 since these arise by scaling the metric on a CAT(-1) space by Œ∫‚àí1/2. On the hyperbolic unit disk D quasi-isometries of D induce quasi-M√∂bius homeomorphisms of the boundary in a functorial way. There is a more general theory of Gromov hyperbolic spaces, a similar statement holds, but with less precise control on the homeomorphisms of the boundary. =Example: Poincar√© disk= Applications in percolation theory More recently Busemann functions have been used by probabilists to study asymptotic properties in models of first-passage percolation and directed last-passage percolation.

It was based in Coventry, West Midlands with offices in other parts of the country. On 24 December 2014, the company entered administration. Ernst & Young (EY) was appointed as the administrator, and immediately ceased accepting parcels from customers. City Link officially ceased trading on 1 January 2015.  History  Mercedes-Benz Sprinter in Plymouth in March 2009 City Link was founded in 1969 as a subsidiary of Orbit Cargo Services Ltd, to provide a cross town transfer service for British Rail's Red Star Parcels. At the time, Red Star only operated on direct passenger trains, so a sender in Brighton could not dispatch a parcel to Norwich, as a transfer had to be undertaken in London between Victoria station and Liverpool Street station. In addition, the Red Star service was limited to station to station only and following increasing demand from its customers, City Link established a nationwide network of franchised agents to collect parcels from the local station and deliver to the consignee. In June 1989, the company was acquired by Securiguard Limited. On 20 November 2005, Initial City Link announced that as a part of its expansion programme, it would to buy back the franchises. This was completed in March 2007, with the purchase of its largest franchisee, Tiger Haulage Ltd, which ran City Link's Welwyn Garden City, Hemel Hempstead, Barking, Birmingham, Worcester, West Bromwich, Reading and High Wycombe operations. = Acquisition by Target Express = Exactly one year after Initial City Link announced its franchise buyback scheme, it finished negotiations with the shareholders of Target Express to purchase the company on 20 November 2006. Target was officially acquired, and taken over by Initial City Link on 1 March 2007. As a part of its merger with Target Express, City Link was planning to close 42 of the 110 combined branches in the first half of 2008, to provide a single integrated network. However, at the end of February 2008, managing director Petar Cvetkovic announced a suspension of further integration of Target Express depots until January 2009. The merger of the two units proved problematic, particularly due to depots running different computer systems, damaging profits at parent company Rentokil Initial. Rentokil turned down several offers for the loss making unit in May 2008, instead intending to turn around City Link's fortunes. By November 2011, City Link was still losing money, annual figures released in July show losses growing to ¬£17.8 million, and revenues down 13.5%, and a November 2011 trading statement stated losses of ¬£25 million in the first nine months. Rentokil Initial sold the business to corporate restructuring firm Better Capital in April 2013. = Administration = Late on 24 December 2014, City Link went into administration, and stopped accepting parcels, whilst its administrators Ernst & Young carried out an assessment of the company. On 25 December 2014, the RMT union was reported to have demanded \\"urgent talks\\" with the government and administrators about the collapse of the company. The government said it was unable to intervene in the administration process, although the business secretary said he would meet the union. RMT demanded government talks over the collapse. On 31 December, the company announced that 2,356 jobs would be lost, leaving only 370 staff employed. The collapse of City Link also left 1,500 self employed drivers out of pocket, with no recourse or protection. A petition was created by the sub contractors to try to get the collapse of City Link debated in the House of Commons. = Rescue offer rejected = BBC News reported on 31 December 2014 that the administrators had rejected an offer from an unnamed consortium, claiming that the possible buyer \\"offered no money up front and significantly undervalued the assets to be acquired\\". After confirmation that the rescue had failed, Mick Cash, general secretary of the RMT union, said: \\"Pulling the plug on any efforts to save City Link is a disgraceful and cynical betrayal that will wreck the lives of our members, many of whom are owed thousands of pounds\\". = Reports = The Telegraph website reported on 21 March 2015 that \\"City Link‚Äôs creditors are likely to see less than 2p in the pound on any money they are owed\\".

Geometry of Manifolds. AMS Chelsea Publishing, 2001, pp.224-225. are, roughly, points that can almost be joined by a 1-parameter family of geodesics. For example, on a sphere, the north-pole and south-pole are connected by any meridian. Another viewpoint is that conjugate points tell when the geodesics fail to be length-minimizing. All geodesics are locally length-minimizing, but, for example, on a sphere, any geodesic passing through the north-pole can be extended to reach the south-pole, and hence any geodesic segment connecting the poles is not (uniquely) globally length minimizing. This tells us that any pair of antipodal points on the standard 2-sphere are conjugate points.Cheeger, Ebin. Comparison Theorems in Riemannian Geometry. North-Holland Publishing Company, 1975, pp. 17-18. Definition Suppose p and q are points on a Riemannian manifold, and gamma is a geodesic that connects p and q. Then p and q are conjugate points along gamma if there exists a non-zero Jacobi field along gamma that vanishes at p and q. Recall that any Jacobi field can be written as the derivative of a geodesic variation (see the article on Jacobi fields). Therefore, if p and q are conjugate along gamma, one can construct a family of geodesics that start at p and almost end at q. In particular, if gamma_s(t) is the family of geodesics whose derivative in s at s=0 generates the Jacobi field J, then the end point of the variation, namely gamma_s(1), is the point q only up to first order in s. Therefore, if two points are conjugate, it is not necessary that there exist two distinct geodesics joining them.

Maher was born near Freeport, Illinois to Irish immigrants, James Thomas Maher (January 1, 1842 - March 10, 1923) and Anna (Farley) Maher (November 11, 1839 - September 3, 1907). In 1873, Maher came with his family from Illinois to Dakota Territory, settling in Union County. On May 31, 1887, he married Barbara A. Cooper (August 6, 1861 - August 29, 1937), the daughter of Prussian immigrants. Two of the couple's five children died in infancy. Maher engaged in business in Beresford, South Dakota and learned that he did not like it. In spite of a lack of college training, Maher obtained a veterinary license; and soon, Maher was recognized as a good practitioner of veterinary medicine. Maher built a hospital near his home and established a widely used line of veterinary medicines. In the fall of 1911, Maher was one of sixty or seventy men from Beresford who attended a meeting in Sioux Falls, South Dakota. The meeting was called by Dr. Hanson of Brookings, South Dakota for the purpose of organizing plans for a new highway, which would pass from Winnipeg, Manitoba, Canada to the Gulf of Mexico. The highway was eventually known as US Highway Number 77, which was completed in the fall of 1939. In 1912, Maher was elected to represent the first district of the state Legislature in the South Dakota House of Representatives. He spent his last three years in failing health and used a wheelchair during that time. Maher's health problems were attributed to a strenuous life. He died peacefully in his sleep. During the hour of John W. Maher's funeral, all businesses in Beresford, South Dakota were closed by proclamation of the Mayor. References *John W. Maher obituary. (1917, May 17).

In fact, any complete metric space where a triangle is hyperbolic is an Hadamard space. In geometry, an Hadamard space, named after Jacques Hadamard, is a non-linear generalization of a Hilbert space. In the literature they are also equivalently defined as complete CAT(0) spaces. A Hadamard space is defined to be a nonemptyThe assumption on \\"nonempty\\" has meaning: a fixed point theorem often states the set of fixed point is an Hadamard space. The main content of such an assertion is that the set is nonempty. complete metric space such that, given any points x, y, there exists a point m such that for every point z, :d(z, m)^2 + {d(x, y)^2 over 4} le {d(z, x)^2 + d(z, y)^2 over 2}. The point m is then the midpoint of x and y: d(x, m) = d(y, m) = d(x, y)/2. In a Hilbert space, the above inequality is equality (with m = (x+y)/2), and in general an Hadamard space is said to be flat if the above inequality is equality. A flat Hadamard space is isomorphic to a closed convex subset of a Hilbert space. In particular, a normed space is an Hadamard space if and only if it is a Hilbert space. The geometry of Hadamard spaces resembles that of Hilbert spaces, making it a natural setting for the study of rigidity theorems. In a Hadamard space, any two points can be joined by a unique geodesic between them; in particular, it is contractible. Quite generally, if B is a bounded subset of a metric space, then the center of the closed ball of the minimum radius containing it is called the circumcenter of B.A Course in Metric Geometry, p. 334. Every bounded subset of a Hadamard space is contained in the smallest closed ball (which is the same as the closure of its convex hull). If Gamma is the group of isometries of a Hadamard space leaving invariant B, then Gamma fixes the circumcenter of B. (Bruhat‚ÄìTits fixed point theorem) The basic result for a non-positively curved manifold is the Cartan‚ÄìHadamard theorem. The analog holds for a Hadamard space: a complete, connected metric space which is locally isometric to a Hadamard space has an Hadamard space as its universal cover. Its variant applies for non-positively curved orbifolds. (cf. Lurie.) Examples of Hadamard spaces are Hilbert spaces, the Poincar√© disc, complete metric trees (e.g., complete Bruhat‚ÄìTits building), (p, q)-space with p, q ‚â• 3 and 2pq ‚â• p + q, and Hadamard manifolds, i.e. complete simply-connected Riemannian manifolds of nonpositive sectional curvature. Important examples of Hadamard manifolds are simply connected nonpositively curved symmetric spaces. Applications of Hadamard spaces are not restricted to geometry.

Ann. of Math. 147 (1998), 695-708 used CAT(0) geometry to solve a problem in Dynamical billiards: in a gas of hard balls, is there a uniform bound on the number of collisions? The solution begins by constructing a configuration space for the dynamical system, obtained by joining together copies of corresponding billiard table, which turns out to be an Hadamard space.

In its original manufactured form, a dowel is called a dowel rod. Dowel rods are often cut into short lengths called dowel pins. Dowels are commonly used as structural reinforcements in cabinet making and in numerous other applications, including: * Furniture shelf supports * Moveable game pieces (i.e. pegs) * Hangers for items such as clothing, key rings, and tools * Wheel axles in toys * Detents in gymnastics grips * Supports for tiered wedding cakes Wood dowel =Manufacturing process= A dowel plate The traditional tool for making dowels is a dowel plate, an iron (or better, hardened tool steel) plate with a hole having the size of the desired dowel. To make a dowel, a piece of wood is split or whittled to a size slightly bigger than desired and then driven through the hole in the dowel plate. The sharp edges of the hole shear off the excess wood.Ivin Sickels, Exercises in Wood-Working, American Book Company, 1889; see Exercise 18.‚Äî Uniting with Dowels, pages 104-105.Dowel Making and Doweling, Scientific American, Vol. XLIX, No. 6 (Aug. 11, 1883); page 88.H. H. Parker, Making Wood Dowels, Popular Mechanics, Vol. 41, No. 6 (June, 1924); page 957. A second approach to cutting dowels is to rotate a piece of oversized stock past a fixed knife, or alternatively, to rotate the knife around the stock. Machines based on this principle emerged in the 19th century.William H. Whitlock, Improvement in Turning Tool, , granted Oct. 27, 1868. Sanford A. Penny, Lathe, , granted Feb. 19, 1889. Frequently, these are small bench-mounted tools.Edward A. Cherry, Tool for Forming Round Dowels and Rods, , granted Feb. 1, 1921; this is the Stanley No. 77 Dowel and Rod Turner.Abdul Aziz, Leonard G. Lee and Lloyd Sevack, Dowel Maker, , granted Aug. 26, 2001; this is the Lee Valley Veritas Dowel Maker. For modest manufacturing volumes, wood dowels are typically manufactured on industrial dowel machines based on the same principles as the rotary cutters described above. Such machines may employ interchangeable cutting heads of varying diameters, thus enabling the machines to be quickly changed to manufacture different dowel diameters. Typically, the mechanism is open-ended, with material guides at the machine's entry and exit to enable fabrication of continuous dowel rod of unlimited length. Since the 19th century, some of these dowel machines have had power feed mechanisms to move the stock past the cutting mechanism.Oscar H. Ordway, Dowel Making Machine, , granted May 10, 1898.George W. Davis, Dowel-Making Machine, , granted Aug. 22, 1922. High-volume dowel manufacturing is done on a wood shaper, which simultaneously forms multiple dowels from a single piece of rectangular stock (i.e., wood). These machines employ two wide, rotating cutting heads, one above the stock and one below it. The heads have nearly identical cutting profiles so that each will form an array of adjoined, side-by-side \\"half dowels\\". The heads are aligned to each other and one head is shaped to make deeper cuts along the dowel edges so as to part the stock into individual dowel rods, resulting in a group of dowel rods emerging in parallel at the machine's output. =Application= Fluted wood dowel pin Joining two pieces of wood with dowel pins The wooden dowel rod used in woodworking applications is commonly cut into dowel pins, which are used to reinforce joints and support shelves and other components in cabinet making. Some woodworkers make their own dowel pins, while others purchase dowel pins precut to the required length and diameter. When dowels are glued into blind holes, a very common case in dowel-based joinery, there must be a path for air and excess glue to escape when the dowel is pressed into place. If no provision is made to relieve the hydraulic pressure of air and glue, hammering the dowel home or clamping the joint can split the wood. An old solution to this problem is to plane a flat on the side of the dowel; some sources suggest planing the flat on the rough stock before the final shaping of the round dowel. Some dowel plates solve the problem by cutting a groove in the side of the dowel as it is forced through; this is done by a groove screw, a pointed screw intruding from the side into the dowel cutting opening. Some dowel pins are Fluted with multiple parallel grooves along their length to serve the same purpose. When two pieces of wood are to be joined by dowels embedded in blind holes, there are numerous methods for aligning the holes. For example, pieces of shot may be placed between the wood pieces to produce indentations when the pieces are clamped together; after the clamp is released, the indentations indicate the center points for drilling. Dowel centers are simple and inexpensive tools for aligning opposing blind holes. Various commercial systems, such as Dowelmax, have been devised to solve this problem. Alternative joinery methods may be used in place of conventional dowel pins, such as Miller dowels, biscuit joiners, spline joints, and proprietary tools such as the Domino jointer. =History= Hand cut 8\\" dowel, c1840 The word dowel was used in Middle English; it appears in Wycliffe's Bible translation (circa 1382-1395) in a list of the parts of a wheel: \\"...and the spokis, and dowlis of tho wheelis...\\"3 Kings 7:33 in Wycliffe's Bible. Cognates with other Germanic languages suggest that the word is much older (deuvel in Dutch, D√ºbel in German). Wooden dowels have been used in manufacturing and woodworking for many centuries. One of the earliest documented uses of wooden dowels was in Japanese shrines in AD 690, which were constructed using only wood, wooden dowels and pegs, and interlocking joints. Around AD 1000, Leif Erikson sailed across the North Atlantic in a ship that was largely constructed of overlapping planks held together by wooden dowels and iron nails. The wooden dowels did not rust and thus were more reliable than iron for long expeditions. Metal dowel =In machinery= Steel dowel pins Dowel pins are often used as precise locating devices in machinery. Steel dowel pins are machined to tight tolerances, as are the corresponding holes, which are typically reamed. A dowel pin may have a smaller diameter than its hole so that it freely slips in, or a larger diameter so that it must be pressed into its hole (an interference fit). When designing mechanical components, mechanical engineers typically use dowel holes as reference points to control positioning variations and attain repeatable assembly quality. If no dowels are used for alignment (e.g., components are mated by bolts only), there can be significant variation, or \\"play\\", in component alignment. Typical drilling and milling operations, as well as manufacturing practices for bolt threads, introduce mechanical play proportional to the size of the fasteners. For example, bolts up to in diameter typically have play on the order of . When dowels are used in addition to bolts, however, the tighter dimensional tolerances of dowels and their mating holes‚Äîtypically ‚Äîresult in significantly less play, on the order of . Manufacturing costs are inversely proportional to mechanical tolerances and, as a result, engineers must balance the need for mechanical precision against cost as well as other factors such as manufacturability and serviceability. There are a variety of specifications, military, ISO, DIN, ASME that pins may be made to. And size can even vary by dowel pin material. Metric dowel pins are often found in two size. In DIN 6325 standard the dowel pins are slightly larger than the nominal value. For example a 3 mm dowel pin will range from . In the ISO 2338 standard the dowel pins are slightly smaller - 3 mm nominal range is . The terminology (e.g. \\"oversized\\", \\"standard\\") is not entirely consistent across suppliers. In inch pins \\"oversized\\" refers to pins that are more significantly oversized for worn out dowel pin holes. The most common inch sized pins are slightly oversized, and \\"undersized\\" versions are also available. In automobiles, dowels are used when precise mating alignment is required, such as in differential gear casings, engines, and transmissions. Bolts in a bolted joint often have an important function as a dowel, resisting shear forces. For this reason, many bolts have a plain unthreaded section to their shank. This gives a closer fit to the hole and also avoids some problems with fretting wear when a screw thread bears against an unthreaded component. =In woodworking= Cross dowel. Note that the slot is usually parallel to the axis of the bolt hole, contrary to this drawing. A cutaway view of a cross dowel in use. For illustrative purposes the dowel's slot is shown perpendicular to the bolt, but in practice the slot is usually parallel to the bolt's axis. A cross dowel is a cylindrically shaped metal nut (i.e., a metal dowel) that is used to join two pieces of wood. Like other metal nuts, it has an inside threaded hole, although the hole is unusual in that it passes through the sides of the dowel. One or both ends of the dowel are slotted, with the slots oriented parallel to the threaded hole through which the bolt will pass. In a cross dowel application, the two pieces of wood are aligned and a bolt hole is drilled through one piece of wood and into the other. A dowel hole is drilled laterally across the bolt hole and the cross dowel is inserted into it. A screwdriver is inserted into the slot at the end of the cross dowel and the dowel is rotated so that its threaded hole aligns with the bolt hole. The bolt is then inserted into the bolt hole and screwed into the cross dowel until the wood pieces are held tightly together.

Swartz declined a plea bargain under which he would have served six months in federal prison. Two days after the prosecution rejected a counter-offer by Swartz, he was found dead in his Brooklyn apartment, where he had hanged himself. In 2013, Swartz was inducted posthumously into the Internet Hall of Fame. Early life Swartz in 2002 with Lawrence Lessig at the launch party for Creative Commons Swartz describes the nature of the shift from centralized one-to-many systems to the decentralized many-to-many topology of network communication. San Francisco, April 2007 (9:29) Swartz was born in Highland Park, Illinois (a suburb of Chicago), the eldest son of Jewish parents Susan and Robert Swartz, and brother of Noah and Benjamin. His father had founded the software firm Mark Williams Company. Swartz immersed himself in the study of computers, programming, the Internet, and Internet culture. He attended North Shore Country Day School, a small private school near Chicago, until 9th grade. Swartz left high school in the 10th grade, and enrolled in courses at Lake Forest College. In 1999, when he was 13 years old he created the website Theinfo.org, a collaborative online library. Theinfo.org made Swartz the winner of the ArsDigita Prize, given to young people who create \\"useful, educational, and collaborative\\" noncommercial websites. At age 14, he became a member of the working group that authored the RSS 1.0 web syndication specification. Swartz attended Stanford University, but dropped out after his first year. =Entrepreneurship= During Swartz's first year at Stanford, he applied to Y Combinator's very first Summer Founders Program, proposing to work on a startup called Infogami, designed as a flexible content management system to allow the creation of rich and visually interesting websites or a form of wiki for structured data. After working on Infogami with co-founder Simon Carstensen over the summer of 2005, Aaron opted not to return to Stanford, choosing instead to continue to develop and seek funding for Infogami. As part of his work on Infogami, Swartz created the web.py web application framework because he was unhappy with other available systems in the Python programming language. In early fall of 2005, Swartz worked with his fellow co-founders of another nascent Y-Combinator firm Reddit, to rewrite Reddit's Lisp codebase using Python and web.py. Although Infogami's platform was abandoned after Not a Bug was acquired, Infogami's software was used to support the Internet Archive's Open Library project and the web.py web framework was used as basis for many other projects by Swartz and many others. When Infogami failed to find further funding, Y-Combinator organizers suggested that Infogami merge with Reddit, which it did in November 2005, resulting in the formation of a new firm, Not a Bug, devoted to promoting both products. As a result of this merger, Swartz was given the title of co-founder of Reddit. Although both projects initially struggled to gain traction, Reddit began to make large gains in popularity in 2005 and 2006. In October 2006, based largely on the success of Reddit, Not a Bug was acquired by Cond√© Nast Publications, the owner of Wired magazine. Swartz moved with his company to San Francisco to work on Wired. Swartz found office life uncongenial, and he ultimately left the company. In September 2007, Swartz joined with Infogami co-founder Simon Carstensen to launch a new firm, Jottit, in another attempt to create another markdown driven content management system in Python. Activism In 2008, Swartz founded Watchdog.net, \\"the good government site with teeth,\\" to aggregate and visualize data about politicians. In the same year, he wrote a widely circulated Guerilla Open Access Manifesto. On December 27, 2010, Swartz filed a Freedom of Information Act (FOIA) request to learn about the treatment of Chelsea Manning, alleged source for WikiLeaks. = PACER = In 2008, Swartz downloaded about 2.7 million federal court documents stored in the PACER (Public Access to Court Electronic Records) database managed by the Administrative Office of the United States Courts.Lee, Timothy B.,The inside story of Aaron Swartz's campaign to liberate court filings, Ars Technica, February 8, 2013. Retrieved March 8, 2013. The Huffington Post characterized his actions this way: \\"Swartz downloaded public court documents from the PACER system in an effort to make them available outside of the expensive service. The move drew the attention of the FBI, which ultimately decided not to press charges as the documents were, in fact, public.\\" PACER was charging 8 cents per page for information that Carl Malamud, who founded the nonprofit group Public.Resource.Org, contended should be free, because federal documents are not covered by copyright. The fees were \\"plowed back to the courts to finance technology, but the system [ran] a budget surplus of some $150 million, according to court reports,\\" reported The New York Times. PACER used technology that was \\"designed in the bygone days of screechy telephone modems ... putting the nation's legal system behind a wall of cash and kludge.\\" Malamud appealed to fellow activists, urging them to visit one of 17 libraries conducting a free trial of the PACER system, download court documents, and send them to him for public distribution. After reading Malamud's call for action, Swartz used a Perl computer script running on Amazon cloud servers to download the documents, using credentials belonging to a Sacramento library. From September 4 to 20, 2008, it accessed documents and uploaded them to a cloud computing service. He released the documents to Malamud's organization. On September 29, 2008, the GPO suspended the free trial, \\"pending an evaluation\\" of the program. Swartz's actions were subsequently investigated by the FBI. The case was closed after two months with no charges filed. Swartz learned the details of the investigation as a result of filing a FOIA request with the FBI and described their response as the \\"usual mess of confusions that shows the FBI's lack of sense of humor.\\" PACER still charges per page, but customers using Firefox have the option of saving the documents for free public access with a plug-in called RECAP. At a 2013 memorial for Swartz, Malamud recalled their work with PACER. They brought millions of U.S. District Court records out from behind PACER's \\"pay wall\\", he said, and found them full of privacy violations, including medical records and the names of minor children and confidential informants. Malamud penned a more detailed account of his collaboration with Swartz on the Pacer project in an essay that appears on his website. Writing in Ars Technica, Timothy Lee, who later made use of the documents obtained by Swartz as a co-creator of RECAP, offered some insight into discrepancies in reporting on just how much data Swartz had downloaded: \\"In a back-of-the-envelope calculation a few days before the offsite crawl was shut down, Swartz guessed he got around 25 percent of the documents in PACER. The New York Times similarly reported Swartz had downloaded \\"an estimated 20 percent of the entire database\\". Based on the facts that Swartz downloaded 2.7 million documents while PACER, at the time, contained 500 million, Lee concluded that Swartz downloaded less than one percent of the database. =Progressive Change Campaign Committee= In 2009, wanting to learn about effective activism, Swartz helped launch the Progressive Change Campaign Committee. He wrote on his blog, \\"I spend my days experimenting with new ways to get progressive policies enacted and progressive politicians elected.\\" Swartz led the first activism event of his career with the Progressive Change Campaign Committee, delivering thousands of \\"Honor Kennedy\\" petition signatures to Massachusetts legislators asking them to fulfill former Senator Ted Kennedy's last wish by appointing a senator to vote for health care reform. = Demand Progress = In 2010, Swartz co- founded Demand Progress, a political advocacy group that organizes people online to \\"take action by contacting Congress and other leaders, funding pressure tactics, and spreading the word\\" about civil liberties, government reform, and other issues. During academic year 2010‚Äì11, Swartz conducted research studies on political corruption as a Lab Fellow in Harvard University's Edmond J. Safra Research Lab on Institutional Corruption. Author Cory Doctorow, in his novel Homeland, \\"drew on advice from Swartz in setting out how his protagonist could use the information now available about voters to create a grass-roots anti-establishment political campaign.\\" In an afterword to the novel, Swartz wrote, \\"these political hacktivist tools can be used by anyone motivated and talented enough.... Now it's up to you to change the system. ... Let me know if I can help.\\" =Stopping the Stop Online Piracy Act (SOPA)= Swartz in 2012 protesting against the Stop Online Piracy Act (SOPA) Swartz was involved in the campaign to prevent passage of the Stop Online Piracy Act (SOPA), which sought to combat Internet copyright violations but was criticized on the basis that it would have made it easier for the U.S. government to shut down web sites accused of violating copyright and would have placed intolerable burdens on Internet providers. Following the defeat of the bill, Swartz was the keynote speaker at the F2C:Freedom to Connect 2012 event in Washington, D.C., on May 21, 2012. His speech was titled \\"How We Stopped SOPA\\" and he informed the audience: He added, \\"We won this fight because everyone made themselves the hero of their own story. Everyone took it as their job to save this crucial freedom.\\" He was referring to a series of protests against the bill by numerous websites that was described by the Electronic Frontier Foundation as the biggest in Internet history, with over 115,000 sites altering their webpages. Swartz also presented on this topic at an event organized by ThoughtWorks. = Wikipedia = Swartz at 2009 Boston Wikipedia Meetup Swartz participated in Wikipedia since August 2003 under the username AaronSw. In 2006, he ran unsuccessfully for the Wikimedia Foundation's Board of Trustees. In 2006, Swartz wrote an analysis of how Wikipedia articles are written, and concluded that the bulk of the actual content comes from tens of thousands of occasional contributors, or \\"outsiders,‚Äù each of whom made few other contributions to the site, while a core group of 500 to 1,000 regular editors tend to correct spelling and other formatting errors. According to Swartz: \\"the formatters aid the contributors, not the other way around.\\" His conclusions, based on the analysis of edit histories of several randomly selected articles, contradicted the opinion of Wikipedia co-founder Jimmy Wales, who believed the core group of regular editors were providing most of the content while thousands of others contributed to formatting issues. Swartz came to his conclusions by counting the total number of characters added by an editor to a particular article, while Wales counted the total number of edits.  United States v. Aaron Swartz case According to state and federal authorities, Swartz used JSTOR, a digital repository, to download a large number of academic journal articles through MIT's computer network over the course of a few weeks in late 2010 and early 2011. At the time, Swartz was a research fellow at Harvard University, which provided him with a JSTOR account. Visitors to MIT's \\"open campus\\" were authorized to access JSTOR through its network. The authorities said Swartz downloaded the documents through a laptop connected to a networking switch in a controlled-access wiring closet at MIT. The door to the closet was kept unlocked, according to press reports. When discovered, a video camera was placed in the room to film Swartz and his computer was left untouched. Once a video of Swartz was recorded, the download was stopped and he was identified. Rather than pursue a civil lawsuit against him, in June 2011 they reached a settlement wherein he surrendered the downloaded data. =Response from JSTOR= On September 25, 2010, the IP address 18.55.6.215, part of the MIT network, began sending hundreds of PDF download requests per minute and was affecting the performance of the entire JSTOR site. This prompted a block of the IP address. In the morning, another IP address, also from within the MIT network, began sending JSTOR more PDF download requests, resulting in a temporary full block on the firewall level of all MIT servers in the entire 18.0.0.0/8 range. An email was then sent to MIT, describing the situation: From an email sent on September 29, 2010, one JSTOR employee wrote to MIT: On July 30, 2013, JSTOR released 300 partially redacted documents, which had been provided as incriminating evidence against Swartz. These documents were originally sent to the United States Attorney's Office in response to subpoenas in the case United States v. Aaron Swartz.

He was arraigned in Cambridge District Court on two state charges of breaking and entering with intent to commit a felony. On July 11, 2011, Swartz was indicted by a federal grand jury on charges of wire fraud, computer fraud, unlawfully obtaining information from a protected computer, and recklessly damaging a protected computer. On November 17, 2011, Swartz was indicted by a Middlesex County Superior Court grand jury on state charges of breaking and entering with intent, grand larceny, and unauthorized access to a computer network. On December 16, 2011, state prosecutors filed a notice that they were dropping the two original charges; the charges listed in the November 17, 2011, indictment were dropped on March 8, 2012.Hawkinson, John State drops charges against Swartz; federal charges remain The Tech, March 16, 2012. Retrieved May 14, 2013. According to a spokesperson for the Middlesex County prosecutor, the state charges were dropped to permit a federal prosecution headed by Stephen P. Heymann and supported by evidence provided by Secret Service agent Michael S. Pickett to proceed unimpeded. On September 12, 2012, federal prosecutors filed a superseding indictment adding nine more felony counts, which increased Swartz's maximum criminal exposure to 50 years of imprisonment and $1 million in fines. During plea negotiations with Swartz's attorneys, the prosecutors offered to recommend a sentence of six months in a low-security prison, if Swartz would plead guilty to 13 federal crimes. Swartz and his lead attorney rejected that deal, opting instead for a trial in which prosecutors would have been forced to justify their pursuit of Swartz. The federal prosecution involved what was characterized by numerous critics (such as former Nixon White House counsel John Dean) as an \\"overcharging\\" 13-count indictment and \\"overzealous,\\" \\"Nixonian\\" prosecution for alleged computer crimes, brought by then U.S. Attorney for Massachusetts Carmen Ortiz.\\"Dealing With Aaron Swartz in the Nixonian Tradition: Overzealous Overcharging Leads to a Tragic Result\\", Justia, John Dean, January 25, 2013. Retrieved September 18, 2020. Swartz died of suicide on January 11, 2013. After his death, federal prosecutors dropped the charges. On December 4, 2013, due to a Freedom of Information Act suit by the investigations editor of Wired magazine, several documents related to the case were released by the Secret Service, including a video of Swartz entering the MIT network closet. Death, funeral, and memorial gatherings =Death= On the evening of January 11, 2013, Swartz's girlfriend, Taren Stinebrickner-Kauffman, found him dead in his Brooklyn apartment. A spokeswoman for New York's Medical Examiner reported that he had hanged himself. No suicide note was found. Swartz's family and his partner created a memorial website on which they issued a statement, saying: \\"He used his prodigious skills as a programmer and technologist not to enrich himself but to make the Internet and the world a fairer, better place.\\" Days before Swartz's funeral, Lawrence Lessig eulogized his friend and sometime- client in an essay, Prosecutor as Bully. He decried the disproportionality of Swartz's prosecution and said, \\"The question this government needs to answer is why it was so necessary that Aaron Swartz be labeled a 'felon'. For in the 18 months of negotiations, that was what he was not willing to accept.\\" Cory Doctorow wrote, \\"Aaron had an unbeatable combination of political insight, technical skill, and intelligence about people and issues. I think he could have revolutionized American (and worldwide) politics. His legacy may still yet do so.\\" =Funeral and memorial gatherings= Aaron Swartz Memorial sign at Internet Archive headquarters, San Francisco, January 24th, 2013 Aaron Swartz Memorial program at Internet Archive headquarters, San Francisco, January 24th, 2013 Swartz's funeral services were held on January 15, 2013, at Central Avenue Synagogue in Highland Park, Illinois. Tim Berners-Lee, creator of the World Wide Web, delivered a eulogy. The same day, The Wall Street Journal published a story based in part on an interview with Stinebrickner- Kauffman. She told the Journal that Swartz lacked the money to pay for a trial and \\"it was too hard for him to ... make that part of his life go public\\" by asking for help. He was also distressed, she said, because two of his friends had just been subpoenaed and because he no longer believed that MIT would try to stop the prosecution. Several memorials followed soon afterward. On January 19, hundreds attended a memorial at the Cooper Union, speakers at which included Stinebrickner-Kauffman, open source advocate Doc Searls, Creative Commons' Glenn Otis Brown, journalist Quinn Norton, Roy Singham of ThoughtWorks, and David Segal of Demand Progress.Hsieh, Steven, Why Did the Justice System Target Aaron Swartz?, Rolling Stone, January 23, 2013.

Swartz's family recommended GiveWell for donations in his memory, an organization that Swartz admired, had collaborated with and was the sole beneficiary of his will. Response =Family response= On January 12, 2013, Swartz's family and partner issued a statement criticizing the prosecutors and MIT. Speaking at his son's funeral on January 15, Robert Swartz said, \\"Aaron was killed by the government, and MIT betrayed all of its basic principles.\\" Tom Dolan, husband of U.S. Attorney for Massachusetts Carmen Ortiz, whose office prosecuted Swartz's case, replied with criticism of the Swartz family: \\"Truly incredible that in their own son's obit they blame others for his death and make no mention of the 6-month offer.\\"Murphey, Shelly, US attorney's husband stirs Twitter storm on Swartz case, Boston Globe, January 16, 2013..

Rafael Reif commissioned professor Hal Abelson to lead an analysis of MIT's options and decisions relating to Swartz's \\"legal struggles.\\" To help guide the fact-finding stage of the review, MIT created a website where community members could suggest questions and issues for the review to address. Swartz's attorneys requested that all pretrial discovery documents be made public, a move which MIT opposed. Swartz allies have criticized MIT for its opposition to releasing the evidence without redactions. On July 26, 2013, the Abelson panel submitted a 182-page report to MIT president, L. Rafael Reif, who authorized its public release on July 30. The panel reported that MIT had not supported charges against Swartz and cleared the institution of wrongdoing. However, its report also noted that despite MIT's advocacy for open access culture at the institutional level and beyond, the university never extended that support to Swartz. The report revealed, for example, that while MIT considered the possibility of issuing a public statement about its position on the case, such a statement never materialized. =Press= Aaron Swartz mural by Brooklyn graffiti artist BAMN The Huffington Post reported that \\"Ortiz has faced significant backlash for pursuing the case against Swartz, including a petition to the White House to have her fired.\\" Other news outlets reported similarly.McCullagh, Declan, \\"Prosecutor in Aaron Swartz 'hacking' case comes under fire\\", CNET, January 15, 2013.

As discussed by editor Hrag Vartanian in Hyperallergic, Brooklyn, New York, muralist BAMN (\\"By Any Means Necessary\\") created a mural of Swartz. \\"Swartz was an amazing human being who fought tirelessly for our right to a free and open Internet,\\" the artist explained. \\"He was much more than just the 'Reddit guy'.\\" Speaking on April 17, 2013, Yuval Noah Harari described Swartz as \\"the first martyr of the Freedom of Information movement.\\" Aaron Swartz's legacy has been reported as strengthening the open access to scholarship movement. In Illinois, his home state, Swartz's influence led state university faculties to adopt policies in favor of open access. = Internet = Hacks On January 13, 2013, members of Anonymous hacked two websites on the MIT domain, replacing them with tributes to Swartz that called on members of the Internet community to use his death as a rallying point for the open access movement. The banner included a list of demands for improvements in the U.S. copyright system, along with Swartz's Guerilla Open Access Manifesto. On the night of January 18, 2013, MIT's e-mail system was taken offline for ten hours. On January 22, e-mail sent to MIT was redirected by hackers Aush0k and TibitXimer to the Korea Advanced Institute of Science & Technology. All other traffic to MIT was redirected to a computer at Harvard University that was publishing a statement headed \\"R.I.P Aaron Swartz,\\" with text from a 2009 posting by Swartz, accompanied by a chiptune version of \\"The Star-Spangled Banner\\". MIT regained full control after about seven hours. In the early hours of January 26, 2013, the U.S. Sentencing Commission website, USSC.gov, was hacked by Anonymous. The home page was replaced with an embedded YouTube video, Anonymous Operation Last Resort. The video statement said Swartz \\"faced an impossible choice\\". A hacker downloaded \\"hundreds of thousands\\" of scientific-journal articles from a Swiss publisher's website and republished them on the open Web in Swartz's honor a week before the first anniversary of his death.. [Author's pseudonym is an anagram of \\"aaron swartz\\".] Petition to the White House After Swartz's death, more than 50,000 people signed an online petition to the White House calling for the removal of Ortiz, \\"for overreach in the case of Aaron Swartz.\\" A similar petition was submitted calling for prosecutor Stephen Heymann's firing. In January 2015, two years after Swartz's death, the White House declined both petitions. =Commemorations= On August 3, 2013, Swartz was posthumously inducted into the Internet Hall of Fame. There was a hackathon held in Swartz' memory around the date of his birthday in 2013. Over the weekend of November 8‚Äì10, 2013, inspired by Swartz's work and life, a second annual hackathon was held in at least 16 cities around the world. Preliminary topics worked on at the 2013 Aaron Swartz Hackathon were privacy and software tools, transparency, activism, access, legal fixes, and a low- cost book scanner. In January 2014, Lawrence Lessig led a walk across New Hampshire in honor of Swartz, rallying for campaign finance reform. In 2017, the Turkish-Dutch artist Ahmet √ñƒü√ºt commemorated Swartz through a work entitled \\"Information Power to The People\\" and depicting his bust.

Scholars posted links to their works. The story of Aaron Swartz has exposed the topic of open access to scientific publications to wider audiences. In the wake of Aaron Swartz, many institutions and personalities have campaigned for open access to scientific knowledge.

Calling the charges against him \\"ridiculous and trumped up,\\" Polis said Swartz was a \\"martyr\\", whose death illustrated the need for Congress to limit the discretion of federal prosecutors. Speaking at a memorial for Swartz on Capitol Hill, Issa said Massachusetts Democratic Senator Elizabeth Warren issued a statement saying \\"[Aaron's] advocacy for Internet freedom, social justice, and Wall Street reform demonstrated ... the power of his ideas ...\\" In a letter to Attorney General Eric Holder, Texas Republican Senator John Cornyn asked, \\"On what basis did the U.S. Attorney for the District of Massachusetts conclude that her office's conduct was 'appropriate'?\\" and \\"Was the prosecution of Mr. Swartz in any way retaliation for his exercise of his rights as a citizen under the Freedom of Information Act?\\" Congressional investigations Issa, who chaired the House Committee on Oversight and Government Reform, announced that he would investigate the Justice Department's actions in prosecuting Swartz. In a statement to The Huffington Post, he praised Swartz's work toward \\"open government and free access to the people.\\" Issa's investigation has garnered some bipartisan support. On January 28, 2013, Issa and ranking committee member Elijah Cummings published a letter to U.S. Attorney General Holder, questioning why federal prosecutors had filed the superseding indictment. On February 20, WBUR reported that Ortiz was expected to testify at an upcoming Oversight Committee hearing about her office's handling of the Swartz case.Boeri, David and David Frank, Ortiz Under Fire: Critics Say Swartz Tragedy Is Evidence Of Troublesome Pattern, WBUR, February 20, 2013.

Excoriating the Department of Justice as the \\"Department of Vengeance\\", Stinebrickner-Kauffman told the Guardian that the DOJ had erred in relying on Swartz's Guerilla Open Access Manifesto as an accurate indication of his beliefs by 2010. \\"He was no longer a single issue activist,\\" she said. \\"He was into lots of things, from healthcare, to climate change to money in politics.\\" On March 6, Holder testified before the Senate Judiciary Committee that the case was \\"a good use of prosecutorial discretion.\\" Stinebrickner-Kauffman issued a statement in reply, repeating and amplifying her claims of prosecutorial misconduct. Public documents, she wrote, reveal that prosecutor Stephen Heymann \\"instructed the Secret Service to seize and hold evidence without a warrant... lied to the judge about that fact in written briefs... [and] withheld exculpatory evidence... for over a year,\\" violating his legal and ethical obligations to turn such evidence over to the defense. On March 22, Senator Al Franken wrote Holder a letter expressing concerns, writing that \\"charging a young man like Mr. Swartz with federal offenses punishable by over 35 years of federal imprisonment seems remarkably aggressive ‚Äì particularly when it appears that one of the principal aggrieved parties ... did not support a criminal prosecution.\\" Amendment to Computer Fraud and Abuse Act In 2013, Rep.

Lawrence Lessig wrote of the bill, \\"this is a critically important change.... The CFAA was the hook for the government's bullying.... This law would remove that hook. In a single line: no longer would it be a felony to breach a contract.\\" Professor Orin Kerr, a specialist in the nexus between computer law and criminal law, wrote that he had been arguing for precisely this sort of reform of the Act for years.Kerr, Oren, Aaron's Law, Drafting the Best Limits of the CFAA, And A Reader Poll on A Few Examples Volokh Conspiracy, January 27, 2013. Retrieved April 23, 2013. The ACLU, too, has called for reform of the CFAA to \\"remove the dangerously broad criminalization of online activity.\\" The EFF has mounted a campaign for these reforms. Lessig's inaugural Chair lecture as Furman Professor of Law and Leadership was entitled Aaron's Laws: Law and Justice in a Digital Age; he dedicated the lecture to Swartz. The Aaron's Law bill stalled in committee. Brian Knappenberger alleges this was due to Oracle Corporation's financial interest in maintaining the status quo. Fair Access to Science and Technology Research Act The Fair Access to Science and Technology Research Act (FASTR) is a bill that would mandate earlier public release of taxpayer-funded research. FASTR has been described as \\"The Other Aaron's Law.\\" Senator Ron Wyden (D-Ore.) and Senator John Cornyn (R-Tex.) introduced the Senate version, in 2013 and again in 2015, while the bill was introduced to the House by Reps. Zoe Lofgren (D-Calif.), Mike Doyle (D-Pa.) and Kevin Yoder (R-Kans.). Senator Wyden wrote of the bill, \\"the FASTR act provides that access to taxpayer funded research should never be hidden behind a paywall.\\" While the legislation had not passed , it helped to prompt some motion toward more open access on the part of the US administration. Shortly after the bill's original introduction, the Office of Science and Technology Policy directed \\"each Federal agency with over $100 million in annual conduct of research and development expenditures to develop a plan to support increased public access to the results of research funded by the Federal Government.\\" Media Swartz has been featured in various works of art and has posthumously received dedications from numerous artists. In 2013, Kenneth Goldsmith dedicated his \\"Printing out the Internet\\" exhibition to Swartz. The fate of Aaron Swartz was also featured in conservative filmmaker Dinesh D'Souza's 2014 documentary America: Imagine the World Without Her, wherein D'Souza compares Swartz's prosecution to his own conviction for violating campaign finance laws, and alleges that both cases exemplify selective, overzealous prosecution. There are also dedicated biographical films for Aaron: = The Internet's Own Boy: The Story of Aaron Swartz = On January 11, 2014, marking the first anniversary of his death, a preview was released of The Internet's Own Boy: The Story of Aaron Swartz, a documentary about Swartz, the NSA and SOPA.\\"Sneak preview of The Internet's Own Boy: The Story of Aaron Swartz\\" ‚Äì PandoDaily The film was officially released at the January 2014 Sundance Film Festival. Democracy Now! covered the release of the documentary, as well as Swartz's life and legal case, in a sprawling interview with director Brian Knappenberger, Swartz's father, brother, and his attorney. The documentary is released under a Creative Commons License; it debuted in theaters and on-demand in June 2014. Mashable called the documentary \\"a powerful homage to Aaron Swartz\\". Its debut at Sundance received a standing ovation. Mashable printed, \\"With the help of experts, The Internet's Own Boy makes a clear argument: Swartz unjustly became a victim of the rights and freedoms for which he stood.\\" The Hollywood Reporter described it as a \\"heartbreaking\\" story of a \\"tech wunderkind persecuted by the US government\\", and a must-see \\"for anyone who knows enough to care about the way laws govern information transfer in the digital age\\". = Killswitch = In October 2014, Killswitch, a film featuring Aaron Swartz, as well as Lawrence Lessig, Tim Wu, and Edward Snowden, received its world premiere at the Woodstock Film Festival, where it won the award for Best Editing. The film focuses on Swartz's role in advocating for internet freedoms. In February 2015, Killswitch was invited to screen at the Capitol Visitor's Center in Washington, D.C. by Congressman Alan Grayson. The event was held on the eve of the Federal Communications Commission's historic decision on Net Neutrality. Congressman Grayson, Lawrence Lessig, and Free Press CEO Craig Aaron spoke about Swartz and his fight on behalf of a free and open Internet at the event. Congressman Grayson states that Killswitch is \\"one of the most honest accounts of the battle to control the Internet ‚Äì and access to information itself.\\" Richard von Busack of the Metro Silicon Valley writes of Killswitch, \\"Some of the most lapidary use of found footage this side of The Atomic Caf√©\\". Fred Swegles of the Orange County Register remarks, \\"Anyone who values unfettered access to online information is apt to be captivated by Killswitch, a gripping and fast-paced documentary.\\" Kathy Gill of GeekWire asserts that \\"Killswitch is much more than a dry recitation of technical history. Director Ali Akbarzadeh, producer Jeff Horn, and writer Chris Dollar created a human- centered story. A large part of that connection comes from Lessig and his relationship with Swartz.\\" = Other films = Patriot of the Web is an independent biographical film about Aaron Swartz, written and directed by Darius Burke. The film was released on September 15, 2019 onto YouTube. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hWdDGpsPyO4 Actor Shawn Mcclintock plays Aaron Swartz. The film had a limited video on demand release in December 2017 on Reelhouse and in January 2018 on Pivotshare. Another biographical film about Swartz, Think Aaron, is being developed by HBO Films.  Works  =Specifications= * Markdown: Swartz was a major contributor to John Gruber's Markdown, a lightweight markup language for generating HTML, and author of its html2text translator. The syntax for Markdown was influenced by Swartz's earlier ' language (2002), which today is primarily remembered for its syntax for specifying headers, known as atx-style headers: Markdown itself remains in widespread use, with websites such as Reddit and GitHub using it. * RDF/XML at W3C: In 2001, Swartz joined the RDFCore working group at the World Wide Web Consortium (W3C), where he authored RFC 3870, Application/RDF+XML Media Type Registration. The document described a new media type, \\"RDF/XML\\", designed to support the Semantic Web. =Software= * DeadDrop: In 2011‚Äì2012, Swartz, Kevin Poulsen, and James Dolan designed and implemented DeadDrop, a system that allows anonymous informants to send electronic documents without fear of disclosure. In May 2013, the first instance of the software was launched by The New Yorker under the name Strongbox. The Freedom of the Press Foundation has since taken over development of the software, which has been renamed SecureDrop. * Tor2web: In 2008, Swartz worked with Virgil Griffith to design and implement Tor2web, an HTTP proxy for Tor-hidden services. The proxy was designed to provide easy access to Tor from a basic web browser. The software is now maintained by Giovanni Pellerano within the GlobaLeaks project. = Publication =   Notes Swartz has been identified as a cofounder of Reddit, but the title is a source of controversy. With the merger of Infogami and Reddit, Swartz became a co-owner and director of parent company Not A Bug, Inc., along with Reddit cofounders Steve Huffman and Alexis Ohanian. Swartz has been referred to as \\"cofounder\\" in the press and by investor Paul Graham (who recommended the merger); Ohanian describes him as \\"co-owner\\".

Mammals of the World. Baltimore: Johns Hopkins University Press.Forsyth A. 1999. Mammals of North America: Temperate and Arctic Regions. Willowdale: Firefly Books. They are distributed from Alaska to Honduras. They are similar in many ways to the Eurasian flying squirrels in the genus Pteromys. Two species of New World flying squirrels can be easily distinguished on the basis of size and ventral pelage. Northern flying squirrels, Glaucomys sabrinus are larger and have belly hair that is dark at the base and white at the tip. Southern flying squirrels, Glaucomys volans, are smaller and have belly hairs that are completely white. Humboldt's flying squirrel is more difficult to distinguish from the northern flying squirrel where their ranges overlap. In fact, they were once considered conspecific. Humboldt's flying squirrel is considered a cryptic species. They are generally smaller and darker than northern flying squirrels. Species *Genus Glaucomys **Glaucomys volans ‚Äì southern flying squirrel **Glaucomys sabrinus ‚Äì northern flying squirrel **Glaucomys oregonensis ‚Äì Humboldt's flying squirrel Gliding Flying squirrels do not actually fly, but rather glide using a membrane called a patagium created by a fold of skin which starts at the wrists of the forearms, extends along the sides of the body, and finishes at the ankles of the hind legs. From atop of trees, flying squirrels can initiate glides from a running start or from a stationary position by bringing their limbs under the body, retracting their heads, and then propelling themselves off the tree.Banfield AWF. 1974. The Mammals of Canada. Toronto: University of Toronto Press. It is believed that they use triangulation to estimate the distance of the landing area as they often lean out and pivot from side to side before jumping. Once in the air, they form an \\"X\\" with their limbs by spreading their long arms forward and out and their long legs backward and out, causing their membrane to stretch into a square-like shape and glide down at angles of 30 to 40 degrees. They manoeuvre with great efficiency in the air, making 90 degree turns around obstacles if needed. Just before reaching a tree, they raise their flattened tails to abruptly change their trajectory upwards and point all of their limbs forward in order to create a parachute effect with the membrane. Upon landing, the limbs break the remainder of the impact and the squirrels usually run to the other side of the trunk in order to avoid any potential predators. They are very clumsy walkers and if they are on the ground in the presence of danger, they will prefer to hide rather than attempt an escape.  Fluorescence  Under ultraviolet light, females and males of all 3 species of Glaucomys fluoresce in varying intensities of pink on both dorsal and ventral surfaces. The fluorescence is hypothesized to help the flying squirrels find each other in low light and mimic the plumage of owls to evade predation.

MLC was not recognized by the United States of America Cricket Association (USACA), and thus had no official status within the recognized international structure of cricket. MLC formed in New Jersey in 2000, with the explicit goals of developing grassroots support for young cricketers in the U.S. and leading up to professional competitiveness at the international level. During its early years, MLC was stifled from achieving much within the organization of cricket by USACA. However, with the increasing disruption to U.S. cricket administration caused by political turmoil within USACA, the overall structure of U.S. cricket began to break down, allowing MLC to step into the fray and begin organizing its own events. With the collapse of the ambitious Pro Cricket league following its maiden, and only, season in 2004, MLC became a major player in the complex political situation in which American cricket found itself. In February 2006, MLC approached the International Cricket Council with a formal request to recognize it as the official governing body of cricket in the USA, in preference to USACA. The request was eventually turned down by the ICC. In 2017, the USACA was expelled by the ICC due to governance issues. Under-15 Tournament On June 7, 2005, MLC announced an under-15 tournament in Chicago, to be played that August, as part of its program of youth cricket development. Italian sporting goods manufacturer L-SPORTO sponsored the competition. However, in July the tournament was first moved to New Jersey, and then cancelled, with MLC citing \\"logistical problems\\" as the reason. The USA Cricket Academy headed by Ashok Patel, and Major League Cricket, both based in New Jersey also formed an alliance to develop a New jersey under 13 tournament. Sir Clive Lloyd Cup MLC announced a new National Interstate Cricket Cup tournament, to be held in November 2005 in Broward County, Florida, under the patronage of former West Indies captain and International Cricket Council match referee Sir Clive Lloyd. Due to Hurricane Wilma, it was postponed to the end of November, eventually being played between 30 November and 4 December. Teams representing the states of Florida, North Carolina, Pennsylvania, Texas, Virginia and Washington played in the inaugural tournament. The tournament will include two divisions, one for senior players, and one for players under the age of 25. Former West Indian opening batsman Desmond Haynes will be involved with coaching national U.S. youth and senior teams selected during the tournament. United States Cricket Development Program In July 2005, MLC announced an ambitious 10-year program for the development of domestic competition and international level cricket skills within the U.S. The program developed by Bernard Cameron and expanded by former 1st class players Robert Smith and Desmond Haynes ,includes plans to establish National Cricket Centres to encourage local development, a National Cricket Academy, and certification of cricket coaches and umpires. MLC has stated the goal of preparing a U.S. team capable of qualifying for the 2011 Cricket World Cup. Another part of the development program is the establishment of world class cricket playing facilities in the U.S. To this end, MLC met with The Walt Disney Company and convinced them to pledge over of land in Florida for the construction of a custom multi-function cricket and soccer stadium. Professional Twenty20 league In September 2005, MLC announced plans to launch a professional eight team Twenty20 league in the U.S., with a first season to have been played in 2007.

Eastsound (not to be confused with East Sound, which is the body of water adjoining Eastsound) is an unincorporated community on Orcas Island in San Juan County, Washington, United States. Eastsound is the largest population center on Orcas Island, the second-most populated (after San Juan Island) and physically largest of the San Juan Islands. Eastsound, Washington is known for its community events, frequent musical performances, recreation and tourism. Eastsound consists of a village green, a few hotels and several restaurants, numerous gift shops, large grocery store, food coop, hardware store, pharmacy, brewery, various music venues, several churches, post office, school, small airport, and public dock. There is a public village green with extensive lawn, picnic tables, shade trees, and outdoor stage that hosts music performances, community events, and the weekly farmers' market. Indian Island is just offshore Eastsound's public beach. Eastsound's scenic location, thriving music and arts community, and quaint friendly village makes it a popular tourist destination. Half a mile north of Eastsound is Orcas Island Airport, with scheduled service to Seattle, Bellingham, Anacortes, Friday Harbor and Lopez Island and unscheduled service to many other locations. Washington State Ferry service to other islands and the mainland is located 8.4 miles south at Orcas Landing. Moran State Park is located nearby. History The first inhabitants of Eastsound were the Lummi tribe, who were often raided by the warlike Haida, who traveled from Southeast Alaska in massive war canoes to attack the Lummis, for the purpose of slaving. The Haida had a distinct advantage, armed with flintlock rifles obtained from Russian traders. The first white people arrived in the 1850s, employees of the Hudson's Bay Company sent from the Fort Victoria post to hunt deer. These trappers brought smallpox, which, combined with the brutal Haida attacks, significantly reduced the native population. One of the first European settlers of Eastsound was Charles Shattuck, who built a log cabin and operated a store in the late 1850s. Other early inhabitants of note included Michael Adams, a prospector and trapper from Pennsylvania and horticulturalist who planted the first apple orchard on Orcas. Belle Langell was the first white child born on Orcas, the daughter of Ephraim and Rosa Langell, who homesteaded near Michael Adams in present-day Eastsound. The Emmanuel Episcopal Church (Eastsound, Washington) was the first church on Orcas Island, was built in 1885, by the Reverend Sidney Robert Spencer Gray, on a plot of land deeded from Charles Shattuck.

With 1,710 seats over three levels, it is one of the largest Broadway theatres. The St. James Theatre, named after the famed St James's Theatre in London, is owned and operated by Jordan Roth, President, and owner of Jujamcyn Theaters. Disney Theatrical Productions's musical Frozen was the theatre's most recent tenant, running from March 2018 to March 2020. History Abraham L. Erlanger, theatrical producer and a founding member of the Theatrical Syndicate, constructed the St. James on the site of the original Sardi's restaurant. Designed by architects Warren and Wetmore (one of two firms that designed Grand Central Terminal), the theatre's simple brick facade is dominated by a large cast iron loggia, masking the fire escapes from the auditorium over the expansive street front. The gilded, landmarked auditorium is ornate, with two balconies. It opened in 1927 as The Erlanger Theatre. Upon Erlanger's death in 1930, the Astor family, who owned the land on which the theatre stood assumed control of the venue and renamed it the St. James Theatre. The theatre was taken over by the Shuberts in 1941. They were forced to sell it to William L. McKnight in 1957 following the loss of an antitrust case. McKnight renovated the St. James and reopened it in 1958. In 1970, McKnight then transferred the theatre to his daughter Virginia and her husband James H. Binger, who had formed Jujamcyn Theaters. After Binger's death in 2004, producer and president of Jujamcyn, Rocco Landesman, announced his plans to buy the company. Landesman purchased the group in 2005, and in 2009 he sold half his stake to up-and-coming theatrical producer, Jordan Roth. Shortly after, Landesman was asked to head the NEA and Roth and assumed control of the group. The theatre has been home to a number of long-running and Tony Award-winning musicals in its ninety-one-year history, including original productions of Oklahoma!, The King and I, Hello, Dolly!, The Who's Tommy and The Producers. Located on 44th Street in the Theater District, the St. James neighbors a handful of large musical houses including the Majestic, Broadhurst, Shubert, and the Hayes Theater. In 2017, the St. James completed a renovation which extended its stage by ten feet into the alley between the Hayes Theater and the St. James. The stage expansion was to accommodate the Broadway run of the Disney musical Frozen. Box office record Frozen achieved the box office record for the St. James Theatre. The production grossed $2,624,495 over eight performances for the week ending December 30, 2018.  Filming location  In April and May 2013, film director Alejandro Gonz√°lez I√±√°rritu spent 30 days shooting his film Birdman almost entirely within the St. James Theatre and its environs. The film depicts the production of a Broadway show during its preview nights and premiere and utilizes the theatre's stage, lobby, and backstage areas. The theatre features in the opening montage of Woody Allen's Manhattan, his \\"love letter\\" to New York City. St. James Theatre is also shown in the season 4 finale of Curb Your Enthusiasm when Larry David and David Schwimmer star in the Broadway version of The Producers. There is also a scene on the street in front of the theatre in which Larry David gets into a confrontation with a tourist played by Stephen Colbert. The theatre has also appeared in several episodes of NBC's Smash and was featured in season 5 of the FOX Television series Glee as Lea Michele's Rachel Berry stars in the revival of Funny Girl staged at the theatre.

He attended the √âcole des Beaux-Arts at the Sorbonne and studied under Bernand Corman and Lucien Simon (1861‚Äì1945). From 1932 to 1935, he traveled to Tahiti and New York and in 1935 he moved to New York City to pursue his art. Style and works Lamotte's travels inspired his works, as demonstrated by his cityscapes of Paris, New York, and Tahiti. Lamotte beautifully captured modern day Parisian city life and street scenes. Lamotte's style is reminiscent of other artists of the School of Paris, modern with a flair for the romantic. His technique gives his oil paintings a look and texture of a watercolor. While in New York between travels to Tahiti and Paris, within one year of his arrival Lamotte received several mural commissions including and exhibitions including a solo show at the Wildenstein Gallery. Other exhibits included the Art Institute of Chicago in 1941, the Carstairs Gallery in New York City annually from 1941‚Äì1950s, and a solo show at the Palm Beach Gallery in 1965. Like Pierre Sicard and Grigory Gluckmann, Lamotte was represented by the Dalzell-Hatfield Gallery in Los Angeles, which had an exhibition in 1975. Lamotte also created a mural of Christiansted Harbor on St. Croix, Virgin Islands for the White House pool for John F. Kennedy, which is now preserved in the John F. Kennedy Library and Museum, Boston. Other commissions include businesses, restaurants corporations, private collectors, and theatre design. Lamotte was also an illustrator for numerous fashion magazines. In 1945 an illustrated book published on Lamotte entitled, Bernard Lamotte, Oil Painting and Brush Drawing, was written by Louis Gauthier and in 1948 his work was reviewed in Time magazine. Museum collections of Lamotte's work include the Tokyo Museum, Luxembourg Museum, Musee d‚ÄôArt Moderne in Paris, and the French Embassy in Finland. Private collections include Joseph P. Kennedy, Alfred Barnes, and Anton Dalhuijsen, among several others. The Vose Gallery of Boston has hosted several exhibitions from his estate. New York City residence Lamotte's atelier was located above what is now La Grenouille restaurantThe Flowers of La Grenouille by Charles Masson where fellow expatriate French artists and famed New York personalities congregated, including Greta Garbo, Charlie Chaplin, and Marlene Dietrich. The studio he and his wife shared became a bohemian haven and was coined, Le Bocal (\\"The Fishbowl\\"). Friendship with Antoine de Saint-Exup√©ry Antoine de Saint-Exup√©ry met Lamotte in art school in France, and in the early 1940s spent a great deal of time in Lamotte's New York City studio at 3 East 52nd Street, called Le Bocal. It was one of the places where Saint-Exup√©ry worked on Le petit prince. Lamotte also created the illustrations for Flight to Arras by Antoine de Saint-Exup√©ry. Personal life Lamotte was born and educated in Paris. He had been bedridden for some time as a child due to an injury and spent his time studying the color and textures of the cityscape below his window, which would greatly influence his artistic style and passion. After years of travel, Bernard became an American citizen in 1951. He married Lilyan White Kent, a painter and sculptor, who was the widow of Twentieth Century Fox president Sidney R. Kent. She introduced him to such stars as Marlene Dietrich, Charlie Chaplin, and Greta Garbo. Bernard died in 1983 at age 80 from complications from surgery at St. Luke's Hospital in Manhattan.

The custom in-ear monitor company was founded by Mindy and Jerry Harvey in 1995 and it created a new market for custom IEMs which are now used by most of the world's top touring musicians. In August 2008, Ultimate Ears was acquired by Logitech, and operates as a subsidiary. History In 1995, Jerry Harvey was Van Halen's touring monitor engineer, mixing their stage sound through stage wedges‚Äîpowerful loudspeakers aiming at each of the musicians. Drummer Alex Van Halen had great difficulty hearing the other band members over all the noise of the stage; louder monitors did not help. Harvey created a custom molded earpiece for the drummer to block some of the stage noise and focus on the desired sound: a prototype earpiece that contained two tiny speaker drivers, one for low frequencies and one for high frequencies, the frequencies split by a passive audio crossover. The high frequency driver was a stock Japanese component but a suitable low frequency driver was difficult to find. The only driver which survived strong kick drum signals was a Knowles-made pacemaker part, a balanced armature transducer intended to warn the pacemaker wearer of internal problems. Other Van Halen band members became interested and Harvey crafted further sets. The musicians touring with Van Halen‚ÄîSkid Row‚Äîwanted some in-ear monitors and Harvey sold them six pairs for $3,000. Pop singer Engelbert Humperdinck wanted a set and at that point Harvey determined to start a company to supply the demand. Harvey and his wife Mindy decided to divorce at the same time as they joined as business partners in Las Vegas, Nevada, where they incorporated Ultimate Ears. Mindy Harvey later said, \\"Ultimate Ears is the child we never had ...and in the big picture, getting divorced was the only way to spread the word about the company.\\" The company was run from Mindy's home, offering not just custom-molded earpieces but the associated radio transmitters and receivers intended for use onstage by performing musicians. Jerry Harvey promoted the systems and also helped Shure produce their E1 and E5 IEMs, \\"the first universal-fit dual-driver monitors.\\" Helping Shure make this product also helped the new company Ultimate Ears gain respectability. Ultimate Ears first became significantly profitable in 1998 with the introduction of the UE-5 model; the fifth of Harvey's designs. Customers included The Rolling Stones, Faith Hill, Enrique Iglesias, and the Red Hot Chili Peppers. =Westone, Innovate Partners, Logitech= From the beginning, Ultimate Ears partnered with Westone to manufacture Harvey's designs, but in 2001 Westone began to operate a separate distribution channel in Europe, selling the IEMs as their own designs, holding all the Ultimate Ears trademarks and patents. Relations between Westone and Ultimate Ears soured. Harvey did not have any patents, so it was difficult for him to separate his design, marketing and sales business from the manufacturer. At the beginning of 2002, Ultimate Ears opened their own lab, hiring Chomphorn \\"Noy\\" Soudaly, an audiologist and hearing aid technician, to run the lab. In April 2002, Ultimate Ears produced an upgraded model without Westone's help. The Harveys were able to retain nine out of ten customers; the remainder became customers of Westone. In 2003, Ultimate Ears had five employees and held about 80% of the professional IEM market. Harvey went out on tour with Linkin Park to get back in contact with touring musicians and while on tour he noticed the popularity of iPods and other mp3 players. He returned with the idea that Ultimate Ears should offer a consumer model for audiophile listeners. The resulting UE-5c appeared in January 2004 sold for $550. High sales of these doubled the company's income. Pursuing this direction further required outside investment, and the Harveys contacted Bob Allison, owner and CEO of Innovate Partners, an investment holding company in Irvine, California. Allison became the CEO of Ultimate Ears as the company moved to Irvine, with Mindy Harvey the president and Jerry Harvey the CTO. Innovate Partners helped Ultimate Ears develop a manufacturing source in China to provide the expected volume of sales. By April 2005, the resulting Super.fi 5 Pro, a double armature product, was offered to consumers at $250 per pair, and sales of these helped Ultimate Ears to gross more than $10 million in 2006. That same year, Ultimate Ears teamed with M-Audio and with Altec Lansing to produce rebranded lines of earpieces, one sold under the management of M-Audio (their IE model line) and the other under the Altec Lansing name. Harvey left Ultimate Ears in 2007 after designing and producing the UE-10 Pro and then the UE-11, the first 3-way and 4-way (respectively) IEM products from Ultimate Ears. Harvey said he was \\"forced out\\" by Allison who wished to strengthen his position as leader. Republished from The Orlando Sentinel. Ultimate Ears was acquired by Logitech in August 2008. The $34 million deal bought out Mindy Harvey's share and gave Logitech its first in-ear earphones product line. Allison continued as division CEO. Logitech's vice president in charge of headsets and earbuds, Philippe Depallens, said that even after the departure of both Jerry and Mindy Harvey, the company has been able to \\"keep carrying the torch of having the best in-ear monitors in the market.\\" =Portable speaker market entry= On May 21, 2013, Ultimate Ears entered the portable, wireless consumer speaker market with the introduction of the UE Boom.

(8 July 1927 ‚Äì 16 December 2015) was an American bishop and Roman Catholic priest of the Dominican order. He was known for his traditionalist Catholic positions and was an advocate of sedeprivationism. He was also known from the Fox TV-movie The Haunted, which is about the Smurl haunting where McKenna conducted two exorcisms. Life He was ordained a Catholic priest for the Dominican Order in 1958 by Cardinal Amleto Giovanni Cicognani. After the Second Vatican Council, while working as a translator and scientific researcher for his religious Order, he became increasingly concerned with the ramifications of the Vatican reforms, and finally removed himself from those in his Order with whom he felt he could no longer associate in good conscience. He continued as a Dominican priest while joining other priests in the Orthodox Roman Catholic Movement (O.R.C.M. or ORCM), a traditionalist Catholic organization founded by Father Francis E. Fenton that represented itself as preserving authentic Catholicism from what its members viewed as radical modernist changes in doctrine and liturgy. The ORCM still exists as a corporation for legal purposes, but has long ceased to be used to represent a religious organization. As early as his October 1985 issue of Catholics Forever, Father McKenna referred to his involvement historically as \\"in ORCM days\\". Fr. McKenna was consecrated a bishop on August 22, 1986 in Raveau, France by Mgr. Michel Guerard des Lauriers, O.P, one of the bishops consecrated by Archbishop Pierre Martin Ng√¥ ƒê√¨nh Th·ª•c without papal mandate.Edward Jarvis (2018). Sede Vacante: the Life and Legacy of Archbishop Th·ª•c. Apocryphile Press. Berkeley CA. pp. 109-111 Bishop McKenna also consecrated Rev. Donald Sanborn as Bishop; Bishop Sanborn, who has his seminary in Florida, also works with Bishop Daniel Dolan and Fr. Anthony Cekada in West Chester, Ohio at St. Gertrude the Great. Bishop McKenna retired from his duties at Our Lady of the Rosary Chapel in Monroe, Connecticut due to health concerns. He resided in Michigan until his death. Exorcist Bishop McKenna participated in a number of alleged exorcisms and worked for many years with demonologist Dave Considine and Fr. Rama Coomeraswamy M.D. Some of his cases were also investigated by psychic researchers such as the Warrens. He attempted exorcisms in the Smurl haunting case, which case was described in various books and in the Fox TV-movie The Haunted. Another exorcism he performed in 1985 in Warren, Massachusetts was featured in the Boston Herald and later recounted by the same reporters in the book Satan's Harvest. A spokesperson for the Archdiocese of Hartford, said that whatever ritual was performed on the boy was not sanctioned by the Roman Catholic Church and therefore could not be called an exorcism.Davis, Eileen. \\"Catholic church Disputes Exorcism\\", Hartford Courant, March 17, 1998 Furthermore, he believes that \\"the official establishment does not believe in the devil ... but the devil believes in them. They do not believe, and when they do, they don't want to get involved.\\" Public stand Since being consecrated a bishop, McKenna had been one of the main promoters of the Cassiciacum Thesis developed by his consecrator, which states that the papal claimants since Paul VI have not been true popes due to their public heresies, but have only been papa materialiter. According to McKenna, by teaching that men have a \\"natural right\\" to worship as they see fit, the successors of John XXIII have attempted to put the heresy of ecumenism in place of Catholicism. Referring to this heresy as \\"a spiritual insanity,\\" he wrote in, On Keeping Catholic: > Now while the Popes of Vatican II, including the present Benedict XVI, can > function on the purely natural level in running the Church as an > organization or legal corporation, they have on the supernatural level - in > view of their spiritual madness - no divine authority to speak for the > Church as the Mystical Body of Christ or to govern the faithful in His name; > no power, that is to say, to function precisely as the Vicar of Christ for > so long as this insanity continues. They and the bishops under them, blindly > following them, are lacking the jurisdiction they would otherwise have under > normal circumstances. We must simply ignore them and carry on as best as we > can without them. Concerning the bishops who are in union with Rome, McKenna published a similar view in 1980: > Practically all bishops who are not definitely heretics are at least gravely > suspect of heresy by reason of the sacrilegious outrages they have tolerated > in their dioceses. As a consequence, they have either lost their > jurisdiction or possess a very doubtful jurisdiction, and Canon Law itself > expressly supplies priests jurisdiction in such cases. Although he is sometimes classified as a sedevacantist or a sedeprivationist, McKenna considered himself to be a Catholic bishop just dealing with the Church crisis of the present day. Death Bp. McKenna died at the age of 88 on December 16, 2015.

An armlock that hyperflexes or hyperrotates the shoulder joint is referred to as a shoulder lock, and an armlock that hyperextends the elbow joint is called an armbar. Depending on the joint flexibility of a person, armlocks that hyperrotate the shoulder joint can also hyperrotate the elbow joint, and vice versa. Obtaining an armlock requires effective use of full-body leverage in order to initiate and secure a lock on the targeted arm, while preventing the opponent from escaping the lock. Therefore, performing an armlock is less problematic on the ground, from positions such as the mount, side control, or guard. Armlocks are more difficult to perform when both combatants are standing up, though the stand-up variants are a focus in certain systems such as Chin Na. Armlocks, considered less dangerous techniques in combat sports allowing joint locks, are the most common joint locks used as submission holds. In training, the method of executing an armlock is generally slow and controlled to give the opponent time to submit prior to any infliction of injury. However, in self- defense applications, or when applied improperly or with excessive force, armlocks can cause muscle, tendon and ligament damage, even dislocation, or bone fractures. Armbar overextension of the captured elbow bend The j≈´ji-gatame (ÂçÅÂ≠óÂõ∫„ÇÅ, rendered as \\"Ude-Hishigi-Juji-Gatame\\"), which translates to \\"cross pin\\" or \\"cross hold down\\" also sometimes used interchangeably with the terms armbar, cross armbar or straight armbar, is a Kodokan Judo technique also widely used in other grappling martial arts such as BJJ. The English word \\"bar\\" is used here to signify the opponent's extended arm, while the Japanese word \\"j≈´ji\\" (ÂçÅÂ≠ó) refers to the armbar's visual resemblance to the number 10 as written in kanji, ÂçÅ. The word j≈´ji is also found in \\"j≈´jika\\" (ÂçÅÂ≠óÊû∂), meaning a cross. In general, the practitioner secures an arm at the wrist of the opponent, trapping it by squeezing the knees together. To initiate the submission one of the legs will be across the chest of the opponent, the second leg's calf will cross face the opponent, with the hips tight into the armpit, with the arm held between the thighs, with the elbow pointing against the thigh or hips. By holding the opponent's wrist to the attacker's chest with the pinky finger on the sternum and the thumb facing up (arm semi- supinated or semi-pronated), the practitioner can easily extend the opponent's arm and hyperextend the opponent's elbow. The attacker can further increase the pressure on the elbow joint by arching his hips against the elbow. This technique is used in various grappling martial arts, including but not limited to Brazilian jiu-jitsu, catch wrestling, judo, jujutsu, Sambo, and shoot wrestling, and is reportedly at least 200 years old.https://jitsmagazine.com/submission-history-the-origins-of-the-armbar/ =Flying armbar= A fighter attempts to escape from an armbar by slamming the opponent to the ground. The flying armbar or tobi-j≈´ji-gatame (È£õ„Å≥ÂçÅÂ≠óÂõ∫„ÇÅ) is a version of the j≈´ji-gatame that is performed from a stand-up position. Without a gi, it is typically applied when the opponent has a collar tie and arm control. By tightly holding the opponent's neck and arm, the practitioner places one of his shins against the opponent's midsection, and leans up on the opponent; at the same time, the attacker swings the leg on the same side as the opponent's collar tie over the opponent's head, into the typical j≈´ji- gatame position. A slight modification of this maneuver can also be made. Instead of initiating the move by placing the shin against the opponent's midsection, the lower leg can be directed through the space between the arm and trunk of the opponent with the knee generally placed close to the opponent's armpit. The advantage of this modification is that the attacking practitioner's hips more closely engage with the defender's shoulders, making the forthcoming armbar submission easier to accomplish. However, the disadvantage of this modification is that the associated risk of injury is increased due to the attacker's increased height above the ground and near- vertical upside-down angle to the ground. (With a gi, it can be performed without needing to hold the neck.) If improperly performed, this technique can allow the opponent to escape, and gain an advantageous position. The flying armbar is considered to be one of the most visually spectacular joint locks, but it is uncommon because of the associated risk of falling into a poor position. =Helicopter armbar= The helicopter armbar is a slightly different version of the armbar, a combination of an armbar and tomoe nage, which is also used by wrestling, Judo and BJJ. When the attacker stands in front of the opponent, he grabs both of his arms and falls backwards, causing the opponent to lean forward. Then the attacker puts his feet on the opponent's stomach or hips and lifts him up with his feet. While securing one of the opponents arms, the attacker will drop one foot (Same side as the secured arm). This will cause the opponent to twist and fall, landing with the secured arm extended by the attacker. =Sankaku-gatame= The sankaku-gatame (‰∏âËßíÂõ∫„ÇÅ) or triangle armlock is a j≈´ji-gatame performed from the sankaku position. Originating from Judo it is normally used when the shime (strangle) is not working. It is an effective competition technique because the opponent's arm became exposed while defending the sankaku-jime and their attention is focused in stopping the strangle. Shoulder locks Standard americana execution Ude-garami (americana) being attempted in Judo kata The \\"shoulder lock\\" is a technique used as a method of upper body restraint. It should not be confused with a choke because the lock does not block or interfere with the flow of air or oxygen to the brain. The application is executed by applying pressure between the radial bone and shoulder. =Top shoulder lock= An illustration of Standing Ude-garami(americana) Ude hishigi hiza gatame) The top shoulder lock, (Also known as the figure-four armlock, bent armlock, americana, keylock, V1 armlock, paintbrush, or ude-garami) is a grappling keylock technique in which both of the practitioner‚Äôs arms isolate and cause flexion to the shoulder, elbow, and to a lesser extent the wrist of the opponent. The technique is generally set in motion by the practitioner, using their opposite side hand, (i.e. to target the opponents' right hand he uses his own left hand) pinning the opponent's arm to the ground at the wrist, so that the elbow falls at a right angle with the palm facing upwards. Subsequently, the practitioner will thread his opposite hand under the opponent‚Äôs biceps, reach through and grasp his own wrist, doing so creates the signature ‚Äúfigure four,‚Äù from which one name for this technique was derived, this also gives the practitioner a mechanical advantage over the opponent. To finish the submission the practitioner slides the wrist of the opponent toward the lower body, while simultaneously elevating the elbow and forearm, in a motion resembling using a paintbrush, creating opposition to the joints and causing the necessary flexion in the shoulder and elbow to cause significant pain, and damage if the opponent fails to submit. While it is feasible to execute this technique from several different positions, the most commonly utilized is the side mount position. This technique also has numerous variations with their own nomenclature, for instance depending on the rotational direction the arm, the addition of the word \\"reverse\\" signifying medial rotation as in reverse keylock or reverse ude-garami, in which case the usage of \\"keylock\\" indicates lateral rotation only. =Double wristlock (Gyaku ude-garami)= Double wristlock (Kimura) from bottom Double wristlock / chicken wing (catch wrestling), kimura (Brazilian Jiu-Jitsu), or reverse keylock are terms used to specify a medial keylock known in judo as gyaku ude- garami (reverse arm entanglement) or simply as ude-garami. The application is similar to the top wristlock, except that it is reversed. It needs some space behind the opponent to be effective, and can be applied from the side control or guard. Contrary to the top wristlock, the opponent's wrist is grabbed with the hand on the same side, and the opposite arm is put behind the opponent's arm, again grabbing the attacker's wrist and forming a figure-four. By controlling the opponent's body and cranking the arm away from the attacker, pressure is put on the shoulder joint, and depending on the angle, also the elbow joint (in some variations the opponent's arm is brought behind their back, resulting in a finishing position resembling that of the hammerlock outlined below). The name \\"kimura\\" started circulating in Brazil after a judoka and a professional wrestler Masahiko Kimura used it to defeat one of the founders of Brazilian Jiu-Jitsu, H√©lio Gracie. This variation of the name gained more prominence in MMA after the introduction of UFC, and the role Gracie had in its early history.

(In German) and in catch wrestling as coil lock) is also a commonly featured shoulder lock in Brazilian jiu-jitsu. The locking mechanism is similar to the kimura lock, but instead of using a figure-four, it is applied using a leg. The omoplata can be applied from the guard, by placing one leg under the opponent's armpit and turning 180 degrees in the direction of that leg, so that the leg moves over the back of the opponent and entangles the opponent's arm. By controlling the opponent's body and pushing the arm perpendicularly away from the opponent's back, pressure can be put on the opponent's shoulder. It is also possible to put pressure on the elbow joint by bending the leg entangling the arm, and twisting it in a specific manner. In order to secure the opponent and prevent him from rolling out of the lock, the inner arm can be thrown over the opponent's waist as a \\"seatbelt\\" securing the opponent. Though an effective lock, it is more difficult than other armlocks to successfully apply. The technique called a monoplata is a similar armlock that resembles j≈´ji-gatame or spiderweb position yet has a mechanism like an omoplata.

As its name implies, it has two parts, one of which (the long head) forms part of the hamstrings muscle group. Structure It has two heads of origin: *the long head arises from the lower and inner impression on the posterior part of the tuberosity of the ischium. This is a common tendon origin with the semitendinosus muscle, and from the lower part of the sacrotuberous ligament. *the short head, arises from the lateral lip of the linea aspera, between the adductor magnus and vastus lateralis extending up almost as high as the insertion of the gluteus maximus, from the lateral prolongation of the linea aspera to within 5 cm. of the lateral condyle; and from the lateral intermuscular septum. The two muscle heads joint together distally and unite in an intricate fashion. The fibers of the long head form a fusiform belly, which passes obliquely downward and lateralward across the sciatic nerve to end in an aponeurosis which covers the posterior surface of the muscle and receives the fibers of the short head. Inferiorly, the aponeurosis condenses to form a tendon which predominantly inserts onto the lateral side of the head of the fibula. There is a second small insertional attachment by a small tendon slip into the lateral condyle of the tibia. At its insertion the tendon divides into two portions, which embrace the fibular collateral ligament of the knee-joint. Together, this joining of tendons is commonly referred to as the conjoined tendon of the knee. From the posterior border of the tendon a thin expansion is given off to the fascia of the leg. The tendon of insertion of this muscle forms the lateral hamstring; the common fibular (peroneal) nerve descends along its medial border. =Variations= The short head may be absent; additional heads may arise from the ischial tuberosity, the linea aspera, the medial supracondylar ridge of the femur, or from various other parts. The tendon of insertion may be attached to the Iliotibial band and to retinacular fibers of the lateral joint capsule.The Adult Knee, vol. 1, ed. Callaghan, p. 70 A slip may pass to the gastrocnemius. =Innervation= It is a composite muscle as the short head of the biceps femoris develops in the flexor compartment of the thigh and is thus innervated by common fibular branch of the sciatic nerve (L5, S1), while the long head is innervated by the tibial branch of the sciatic nerve (L5, S1). =Blood supply= The muscle's vascular supply is derived from the anastomoses of several arteries: the perforating branches of the profunda femoris artery, the inferior gluteal artery, and the popliteal artery. Function Both heads of the biceps femoris perform knee flexion.Origin, insertion and nerve supply of the muscle at Loyola University Chicago Stritch School of Medicine Since the long head originates in the pelvis it is also involved in hip extension. The long head of the biceps femoris is a weaker knee flexor when the hip is extended (because of active insufficiency). For the same reason the long head is a weaker hip extender when the knee is flexed. When the knee is semi- flexed, the biceps femoris in consequence of its oblique direction rotates the leg slightly outward. Clinical significance Avulsion of the biceps femoris tendon is common in sports that require explosive bending of the knee as seen in sprinting.

The prison became a symbol of oppression in the political history of contemporary Morocco. It is located near the city of Er-Rich, between Errachida and Midelt. It was managed by commandant Feddoul and Hamidou Laanigri, both Royal Moroccan Gendarmerie officials. History Tazmamart Prison was built in 1972, after the second failed coup d'etat against the late Hassan II of Morocco in August 1972, 58 army officers were sent to Kenitra prison and later to Tazmamart. According to Ali Bourequat, the prison later held also some Sahrawi nationalists and other \\"disappeared\\" political offenders. During the 1980s, there were allegations about the existence of a prison called Tazmamart. Authorities (or Makhzen) were denying all of those allegations. It was not until the publication of the book Notre ami le Roi (Our friend the King) by French journalist Gilles Perrault in 1990 that the issue was raised at a political level. Thomas Miller, who at the time was Director for North African Affairs at the State Department, said in an oral history that he was contacted by American citizen Nancy Touil, who said her husband M‚ÄôBarek Touil had been languishing in Tazmamart for nearly two decades. Miller inserted a talking point in the background papers for President George H.W. Bush for his 1991 meeting with King Hassan. Bush raised the issue, much to the King's dismay. In 1991, and after pressure from international human rights groups and some foreign governments, Hassan II of Morocco decided to close down the prison and release the last remaining detainees. Some fled abroad, others stayed in Morocco, but were prevented from discussing their experiences in Tazmamart publicly. Human conditions According to some former detainees and human rights groups, conditions at Tazmamart were extremely harsh. While torture and ill treatment occurred, the appalling prison conditions were the biggest threat to the lives of inmates. The prisoners were put in cramped single-person underground cells 24 hours a day. They were allowed no human contact, no light, and very little in the way of food or protection from the summer heat, or winter cold. There was no medical treatment for injuries caused by torture and diseases like tuberculosis. Also, the food rations were minimal. There are also allegations of executions. All in all, 35 prisoners, or more than half of the people incarcerated at Tazmamart during the eighteen years died, before the prison was finally closed in 1991. Post-Years of lead  Rumours about Tazmamart's existence were put about as an instrument of terror by the makhzen, but even though several human rights organizations had reported on existence of Tazmamart, the regime officially denied all knowledge of the prison until 1991 when US pressure forced the release of the surviving prisoners. The camp was closed along with several others of its kind, but Tazmamart remains a particularly powerful symbol of the oppressive \\"years of lead\\" in Morocco. Survivors have staged memorial marches to the prison. Rumours persist about the continued existence of Tazmamart-style camps in Morocco, as it has been documented that secret detention and torture of suspects continues, possibly in collaboration with the American CIA (see Black sites). Publications by former inmates Several of the former inmates have since written books on their sometimes decades-long stay in Tazmamart, for example Ali Bourequat's In the Moroccan King's Secret Gardens and Ahmed Marzouki's Tazmamart: Cell No. 10. Famous Moroccan writer Tahar Ben Jelloun has written This Blinding Absence of Light, based on the experiences of one Tazmamart prisoner.

History The Luftwaffe was organized in a large and diverse structure led by Reich minister () and supreme commander of the Luftwaffe () Hermann G√∂ring. G√∂ring through the Reich Air Ministry ( /RLM/) controlled all aspects of aviation in Germany including civilian and military aviation. The organization of this organization was from the peacetime period dating prior to involvement in Spanish Civil War. In early 1937, G√∂ring announced reorganization of the Reich Air Ministry into military and civilian branches. The military branch was to be led by the Oberkommando der Luftwaffe (Supreme H.Q. of Air Force). A chief would be leading the general staff. However, the separation of military from civil aviation was not complete and it was fragmented. Some parts of the military branch were left under the control of Air Inspector General Field Marshal () Erhard Milch. These were: * Central Branch * General Air Office * All the inspectorates The reasons for this formation was primarily to undermine Milch, who was getting favorable attention from the Party. However, later during the year and early next year, G√∂ring again changed the organization structure by removing three offices from Milch's and General Staff's control. He brought under his own direct control. These were: * Personnel Office - under Generalmajor Robert Ritter von Greim * Air Defense - under General der Flakartillerie G√ºnther R√ºdel * Technical Office - under Generalmajor Ernst Udet This change made these offices to be additional power centers in RLM further fragmenting the top Luftwaffe organization. It also crippled important functional areas. Organization To gear-up for the European war as the air arm of the combined Wehrmacht armed forces of Nazi Germany, the Luftwaffe needed a high command equivalent to the Army (Oberkommando des Heeres OKH) or Navy (Oberkommando der Marine OKM). Thus on 5 February 1935, Air Force Command ( OKL) was created. Then in 1939, the Luftwaffe was again reorganized. The credit for the formation of a true Air Force High Command ( OKL) goes to General der Flieger G√ºnther Korten commander of Air Fleet 1 ( and his Chief of Operations General der Flieger Karl Koller. They both campaigned to carve out a command out of Goring's all-encompassing Reich Air Ministry. The intent was to put Luftwaffe on a true wartime footing, by grouping all the essential military parts of the RLM into a single command. It included following branches. * General Staff * Operational Staff * All the Weapon's Inspectorate * Quartermasters Branch * Signals Service Other areas such as training, administration, civil defense and technical design remained under RLM's control. The new organization proved to be more efficient and lasted until the end of the war. OKL like OKH or OKM reported to Supreme High Command of the Armed Forces ( OKW). The OKW was answerable to Hitler for the operation command of the three branches of the armed forces. OKL was divided into forward Echelon () and rear echelon (). The forward echelon moved with the theater of operations while rear echelon remained almost exclusively in Berlin. OKL was also the operational branch of the Luftwaffe. It was divided operationally into air fleets at a high level. Initially it was divided into four air fleets () that were formed geographically and were numbered consecutively. Three more Luftflotten were added later on as German territorial expansion grew further. Each Luftflotte was a self-contained entity. The leader of each was in charge of overall air operations and Support activities. However a fighter leader () was in charge of all the fighter operations and reported to the Luftflotte Leader. Each Luftflotte was further divided into air districts () and flying Corps (). Each Luftgau had 50 to 150 officers led by a Generalmajor. It was responsible for providing administrative and logistical structure as well as resources to each airfield. The Fliegerkorps on the other hand were in charge of the operation matters related to flying such as unit deployment, air traffic control, ordnance and maintenance. Since this structure was making ground support structure available to flying units, the flying units were freed from moving the support staff from one location to another as the unit relocated. Once the unit arrived at its new location, all the airfield staff would come under the control of the commander of that unit. =Chiefs of OKL and Commander-in-Chief of the Luftwaffe= =Chiefs of the OKL General Staff= Flag for the Chief of the OKL General Staff Notes =Footnotes= =Citations= References  * Military units and formations of Germany in World War II Luftwaffe German High Command during World War II Germany Nazi ","title":"Oberkommando der Luftwaffe"},{"id":"2850786","text":"Sasha Bordeaux is a fictional character appearing in American comic books published by DC Comics. The character was at first primarily associated with superhero Batman, and she has subsequently evolved an association with Checkmate in two of its incarnations. Sasha Bordeaux was created by Greg Rucka and Shawn Martinbrough, and first appeared in Detective Comics #751 (December 2000). Fictional character biography =Bodyguard and superhero= Sasha Bordeaux first appeared as an attractive young martial artist who was hired as Bruce Wayne's bodyguard by WayneCorp's second-in-command, Lucius Fox, albeit against Wayne's wishes. Wayne at first tried to avoid her, but she kept on doing her job. She eventually became suspicious of his constant late-night disappearances and did some searching, and was shocked to find that Bruce Wayne was secretly Batman. Knowing he couldn't legally fire her for knowing of his secret identity, Batman began training her to become his apprentice.Detective Comics #761 (October 2001) After weeks of hard work, she became fit enough to go out with him on patrol in a suit, though he still treated her as a total stranger both as Batman and as Bruce Wayne. During this time, she fell in love with him, even as he insisted on having her around while he dated other women. =Framed= One night while Batman and Bordeaux were out on patrol, the assassin David Cain lured Wayne's ex-girlfriend Vesper Fairchild to Wayne Manor and killed her, framing Wayne in the process.Batman: The 10-Cent Adventure (March 2002) Both Wayne and Bordeaux were charged with murder, and Sasha refused to exonerate herself by giving up Wayne's secret despite the fact that they had been patrolling separate areas at the time of the murder and therefore even she couldn't be sure Bruce hadn't killed Vesper.Detective Comics #766 (March 2002) They were both arraigned and held without bail while awaiting trial. After a while, Batman escaped to leave his alter ego behind, leaving Bordeaux inside Blackgate prison. Although Sasha was briefly offered her freedom if she testified against Bruce Wayne‚Äî even contemplating taking the deal after Bruce abandoned her‚Äî a meeting with Alfred Pennyworth, who had recently returned to Gotham City after spending time away, left her resolved to reject the offer. Alfred helped her realize that Bruce had truly valued her work, rather than using her without any thought for herself, as otherwise he would never have allowed her to accompany him as Batman. Batman eventually confronted those who framed him, and Wayne and Sasha were cleared of all charges. =Checkmate= While in prison custody, Sasha was severely wounded by another prisoner and would have died had the government agency Checkmate not given her medical treatment. They faked her death and offered to give her a new name and identity (complete with plastic surgery) if she would work for them. With no other options, she agreed. Batman tirelessly searched for Sasha, not believing she had died in prison. To facilitate this, he disrupted all of Checkmate's operations in Gotham City. The group eventually organized a meeting between the two, where Wayne confessed that he loved her. Sasha, though feeling the same way, realized that her new life would prevent them from being together and told him to let her go. Over time, Bordeaux rose through the ranks of Checkmate to become right hand to Maxwell Lord, the group's leader. Lord later hijacked the Brother I satellite that Batman had created to monitor all superhuman activity. Brother I itself had recently become sentient due to the actions of Alexander Luthor, Jr. as a part of his plans for the Infinite Crisis. He also created an army of cyborgs known as OMACs (humans transformed by a virus) programmed to hunt and kill all superhumans and/or specific targets. During his rule, Lord killed all who opposed him, assisted by Brother I who monitored for rebellion. Sasha feigned loyalty to stay alive, but broke the pretense when Lord killed his former ally Blue Beetle (Ted Kord) and ordered Sasha to dispose of his corpse. Filled with hatred for herself and Lord, she sent Kord's trademark goggles to Batman as part of a message detailing Lord's madness. When Brother I revealed Sasha's betrayal, he sent out an OMAC squad, who found Sasha and Batman in an abandoned warehouse just after they shared a kiss. The OMACs' goal of killing Batman and taking Sasha only partly succeeded, as Batman escaped. Lord, realizing he could not get any information out of Sasha, imprisoned her and brainwashed Superman in an attempt to kill Batman. To stop this, Wonder Woman snapped Lord's neck, killing him instantly. =Cyborg= With the help of another imprisoned agent, Jessica Midnight (who had attempted to assassinate Lord earlier), Bordeaux escaped and set out to kill Lord, unaware he was already dead. As they were on their way out, an OMAC attacked the two and impaled Bordeaux. This attack somehow activated her latent inner programming, turning her into an OMAC cyborg. However, she retained most of her human features, although her skin now resembled a metallic coating and one of her eye sockets was empty. She also found that she retained her free will; unlike the other OMACs, she was not under Brother I's control. With Lord's death, Brother I rechristened itself \\"Brother Eye\\" and activated all the remaining OMACs to kill Earth's superhumans. Bordeaux contacted the other various factions of Checkmate who had left when Lord took over, apologizing for Lord and asking them to rejoin. She then created a computer virus and hooked herself up to the Brother Eye satellite. The virus, along with a massive electromagnetic pulse blast created by the various superheroes, disabled the majority of the OMACs. Brother I escaped with 200,000 OMACS. She later reunited with Batman, who comforted her when she told him she was now a machine. =Infinite Crisis= Eventually, with the aid of the new Blue Beetle, Batman located Brother Eye. He then gathered a team of heroes, including Bordeaux, to attempt to destroy it (Infinite Crisis #5 and #6). The attack sent Brother Eye crashing to Earth, but the satellite's central memory remained intact. With the various superheroes needed elsewhere, Batman tasked Bordeaux with destroying Brother Eye once and for all. Sasha resisted the machine's brainwashing long enough to blow it up. She survived the blast, albeit at the cost of the majority of her OMAC shell. =One year later= One year after Infinite Crisis, Bordeaux became the \\"Black Queen\\" of the Checkmate organization. In the first issue of the new Checkmate comic series, she led a group of operatives into a Kobra stronghold. Her \\"the ends justify the means\\" attitude towards the success of Checkmate missions put her into conflict with Alan Scott. She was also in conflict with several of her Checkmate colleagues, particularly Fire and Mister Terrific, with whom she was romantically involved. As the series progressed, this aspect of her personality was rarely referred to again. In a 2007 story arc involving The Outsiders, Bordeaux suffered extreme torture at the hands of Chang Tzu who wished to learn more about her cybernetic implants. Although she (barely) survived this encounter, subsequent issues have had her fighting to regain her confidence, especially when the healing process resulted in even more of her body becoming cybernetic. In Manhunter (#27, January 2007), Sasha intervened in the trial of Wonder Woman (for murdering Maxwell Lord) by secretly delivering exonerating evidence to Wonder Woman's lawyer, Kate Spencer. =Final Crisis= During the events of \\"Final Crisis\\", Sasha formed a small resistance team that included Snapper Carr, her current romantic interest Mister Terrific, an artificial intelligence, and later the villain Cheetah. They caused much damage against the conquering forces of Darkseid, mainly utilizing Snapper's teleportation power. When Sasha was infected by the Anti-Life Formula, the OMAC nanites in her body put her in a coma to prevent the spread of the infection. After Snapper's powers were neutralized, Mister Terrific realized they had to re- activate all the OMACS that were left. The only way to do this was to revive Sasha and retrieve the OMAC codes from her nanites. The activation of the OMACs is successful, but the revival caused Sasha's biological processes to shut down.Final Crisis: Resist (December 2008) =JSA vs. Kobra= In the 2009 miniseries \\"JSA Vs. Kobra\\", Mr. Terrific and Dr. Mid-Nite were keeping a comatose Sasha alive via life support in hopes of being able to cure her. By the end of the series, Sasha was restored to life and passionately kissed Mr. Terrific.JSA Vs. Kobra #6 (January 2010) This was her last appearance for six years. =DC Rebirth= A new interpretation of Sasha debuted in Wonder Woman volume 3 as part of the DC Rebirth initiative. In the new continuity, Sasha is a superior to Etta Candy, and is introduced discussing Steve Trevor's mission in the African jungle and a nearby sighting of Wonder Woman. After Etta leaves, she is revealed to be linked to an evil artificial intelligence which is monitoring Sasha and attempting to manipulate Wonder Woman from afar.Wonder Woman v3 (2016) #5 Powers and abilities Even before her transformation, Sasha was a skilled hand-to-hand combatant and marksman. She was skilled enough that Batman allowed her to serve as a sidekick of sorts. When Chang Tzu captured Sasha and studied her,Checkmate vol. 2 #15 (August 2007) he discovered that she had the following abilities: * \\"A rough ten-to-twenty percent enhancement over even an Olympic level athlete across the board--in strength, stamina, endurance, speed, dexterity...\\". During the procedure, she also demonstrated a rapidly increasing tolerance to the sedatives being used to keep her unconscious. * \\"(Via Sasha's) ocular implant, the whole of the visual spectrum and more, revealed to you\\". Earlier in the same storyline, Sasha demonstrated the ability to see in the infrared spectrum. * \\"Optimized targeting optics...you must make a terrifyingly accurate sniper...\\" * \\"Body parts encased in the OMAC composite shell...nanobot scabs covering your weaker flesh\\". Sasha also has the ability to turn her nanorobotic components on and off at will. They also help her to regenerate from damage she sustains, particularly to those non-biological parts of her body.

In the course of the series a variety of bizarre and surreal recurring characters cross their paths, mostly also played by the same cast doubling up. =Howard Moon= Howard Tommy Jerry Moon is portrayed by Julian Barratt. Howard is an aspiring musician, actor, poet, novelist and photographer. In the first series he works at the Zooniverse as a zookeeper, alongside Vince. In the second series, Howard and Vince have left the zoo and formed a band together. He is vain, despite being described as \\"generic- looking\\" and often makes outrageous claims which often turn out to be true (he claims, for instance, to have turned down a lucrative offer extended by Walt Disney himself to sort all of Disney's felt-tip pens). He is unlucky in love, and in series one is in love with reptile keeper, Mrs Gideon. In the series three episode Party, it is revealed that he is a virgin. Later in the episode Vince and Howard share a kiss in order to save Vince's life, leading Howard to announce that he has now discovered his own homosexuality and is in love with Vince. Vince is horrified, but he becomes jealous moments later when Howard begins flirting with a girl. Barratt portraying Howard Moon live Whenever Howard is near to death, he pleads not to die, saying, \\"Don't kill me. I've got so much to give.\\" While Vince is always dressed very flashily and into the current fashion, Howard tends to look unkempt and shabby. In the episode \\"Killeroo\\", Howard possesses an unseen disfigurement on his torso. Howard and Vince tease each other constantly, but there is a deep bond between them and both have demonstrated repeatedly that they will risk death to rescue each other from various dangerous situations. When facing death, the two will often reminisce about very mundane things - \\"like that one time they ate soup\\". This usually leads into a 'crimp': a short, completely random song and dance that quickly strays off-topic and often involves harmony. Howard's exact age is uncertain. In the episode \\"Party\\" when Vince tells him that fifty isn't that old, he corrects Vince by telling him that he is only thirty-two and goes on to state that that is ten years older than Vince is. Yet in \\"Fountain of Youth\\", during a flashback to the pair's school days, he exclaims that he is the same age as Vince, despite looking much older, and it's mentioned several times throughout the series that they went to both primary school and college together. =Vince Noir= Noel Fielding playing Vince Noir Vince Noir was originally created by Noel Fielding for the 1998 stage show The Mighty Boosh. Vince Noir went on to appear in three more stage shows, a radio series and a TV series on BBC Three. During the course of the stage shows, the radio series and the TV series, it is implied that he was born in the mid-1980s, and spent much of his early life as an orphan, being raised in a forest by Bryan Ferry, and then proceeded to spend the latter part of his childhood in civilisation in England, where he befriended Howard Moon at primary school. He left secondary school in his mid-teens, after being convinced by Howard to work at a local zoo called the Zooniverse, despite mentioning at various points that he took a gap year, achieved at least two BTEC National Diplomas, and went to college. At the Zooniverse, he befriended Naboo the Enigma, Bollo the Ape, and Bob Fossil. He and Howard also went on several adventures whilst working at the Zooniverse, including visiting the Arctic tundra, Limbo, and going on a road trip. In the second series, he was living in a flat in Dalston with Howard, Naboo and Bollo, and playing in a band with Howard. In the third series, Vince and Howard were working in the Nabootique, a small second-hand shop owned by Naboo. Vince's main personality trait is his relaxed outlook on life, living with perpetually laid back ease, socialising easily with those around him. Vince is often the voice of reason when Howard is being pretentious, although Vince has also been known to have a particularly na√Øve and somewhat childlike outlook on life. Vince is also shown to be vain and sometimes narcissistic, putting great pride in his appearance and his hair and sometimes neglecting his friend Howard in episodes of self-absorption. Vince usually conforms to specific subcultures which he considers vogue, such as mod, goth, punk, and New Rave, Though he seems much more confident and secure than Howard, Vince is desperate to be admired as an individual and a trendsetter. In one episode he invites party guests to \\"bask in the glory of [his] outfit\\". When a doppelg√§nger calling himself Lance Dior arises, Vince's optimism crumbles and he becomes insecure. It was implied in the third series that Vince had bisexual tendencies. Such tendencies are first noted in the episode \\"Journey to the Centre of the Punk\\" when his singular brain cell remarks to Howard that he \\"does swing both ways\\" but didn't really feel \\"it\\" with him. Several such references are made in the episode \\"Party\\", especially when he kisses Howard passionately to avoid being beheaded by Dennis the head shaman. Vince is a fan of electro music (including Gary Numan and The Human League), The Rolling Stones, punk rock, and glam rock (including Kiss). Mick Jagger is Vince's hero. He is highly disdainful of jazz, going as far as to claim to be allergic to it. Vince has sung for various bands, including a glam-folk band, an electro band, his and Howard's own band, and a punk band. Vince is also a keen artist having gained a BTEC National Diploma in Art, as well as hair design; he also claims to be a novelist, writing novellas and publishing them independently. Vince initially claims to have a cockney boxing instructor as an uncle, but it is later revealed that his uncle is actually a French Duke. Vince also claims he is the \\"King of the Mods\\". In the season two episode entitled \\"Fountain of Youth\\", Howard Moon claimed to be the same age as Vince but in a later episode in season three, Vince is ten years younger. Vince is often sarcastic towards Howard and sometimes acts out similar to a teenager with a parent, but he always sticks by him in the end. =Naboo the Enigma= Naboo Randolph Ropitibopiti the Enigma is portrayed by Michael Fielding. He was created for the 2000 stage show, Autoboosh, and later went on to appear in the pilot and all three series of the TV series, as well as both stage shows. Naboo is a freelance shaman from the alien planet Xooberon, and has the ability and knowledge of many spells; and is also a recreational drug user and a drug dealer. He is a member of the Board of Shaman, and like many members he is a heavy drinker and rides on the magic carpet. In 1978, Naboo was mistakenly sent to Earth by the King of Xooberon to protect the amulet of the planet's Fountain of Youth. He became a drug dealer for Rudi and Spider at one point in the 1970s, and eventually went on to work as a kiosk vendor at the Zooniverse. While at the Zooniverse, he would often help Howard and Vince out of situations they often found themselves in, typically their explanations being followed by his catchphrase, \\"I don't believe this!\\" Naboo left the Zooniverse to become a freelance shaman, moving into a flat in Dalston with Howard, Vince, and Bollo, the latter now being his familiar spirit. In the episode \\"Party\\" of series 3, it is revealed that Naboo has no genitals. By the 2006 stage show, he had opened a second hand shop called the Nabootique (sometimes known as Naboo's Nik-Naks). In the episode \\"Fountain of Youth\\" Bollo reveals that Naboo is 406 years old. =Bollo= Bollo was originally portrayed by Dave Brown, and also portrayed in the first TV series by Peter Elliot. He first appeared in \\"Jazz\\", an episode of the 2001 radio series. He went on to appear in all three series of the TV show and the 2006 stage show. Bollo is an anthropomorphic gorilla who has been portrayed as inept yet immensely strong. He and Vince are very close, a stark contrast to his relationship with Howard. His catchphrase is \\"I've got a bad feeling about this...\\", a reference to Star Wars and said in every show since \\"The Call of the Yeti\\". He also DJs at the London nightclub Fabric on Tuesdays. He first appeared in \\"Jazz\\", an episode of a radio series, portrayed by Dave Brown. He next appeared in \\"Mutants\\", where he is stolen by Bainbridge to mutate. He then appeared in \\"Bollo\\", where he is gravely ill, escaping death when the Grim Reaper takes Howard instead of him. He briefly appears in \\"Electro\\", smashing up a guitar in the style of Jimi Hendrix. By the second series he has become Naboo's familiar spirit, and has appeared in every episode since. =Bob Fossil= Bob Fossil is portrayed by Rich Fulcher. In the radio series Fossil is the ill-tempered owner of Bob Fossil's Funworld, an inept zoo. In the TV series, he is the manager of the Zooniverse and zoo owner Dixon Bainbridge's right-hand man. He is loud and brash and is normally portrayed as Howard and Vince's enemy, often trying to set them up for disaster, although on occasion he has expressed attraction to both of them. On radio, Fossil liked Vince and hated Howard, while on television he generally dislikes both of them, although by season 3 he's friendly to Vince, and his radio persona is somewhat replaced by employer Bainbridge. Fossil has a desperate crush on Bainbridge. In the TV series Fossil is portrayed as incompetent and bizarrely unaware of common terms; for example he does not know how to dial with a phone and calls a portable tape recorder his \\"talk box\\". He is often very childlike and emotional. Though Fossil is chief zoo keeper, he knows nothing about animals, describing the elephant as \\"the grey leg-face man\\" and a bear as \\"the hairy Russian carpet guy\\". According to the radio series, Fossil also had a traumatic childhood. In the series, Fossil has his own theme song for the zoo: \\"Nicey nicey zoo zoo, for him and her and me and you!\\" In the radio series, Bob has a brother called Wilbur who reunites him and his mother, who had believed that Bob died in Vietnam. Though Fossil and the zoo were absent from the second television series, he makes a brief reappearance at the end of The Nightmare of Milky Joe as the presenter of \\"The Pie Face Showcase\\" TV music programme. In this appearance he makes a joke about his wife; she is also mentioned in the radio series ('I got a tiny wife to support'). He returns in the third episode of series 3, \\"The Power of the Crimp\\", as the owner of the Velvet Onion club, where Vince and Howard regularly gig. It is revealed that his mother thinks he is in a Vietnamese prisoner of war camp and that he has sent a bundle of sticks to his brother, Donny. Fossil was last seen on the TV show, in the episodes \\"Party\\" and \\"The Chokes\\". Board of Shaman =Dennis= Dennis is portrayed by Julian Barratt. He was originally created for the 2005 TV episode \\"Nanageddon\\", and later appeared in three episodes of the third TV series in 2007. Dennis is the head of the Board of Shaman.

He was originally created for \\"Nanageddon\\", an episode of the second series of The Mighty Boosh and later appeared in three episodes of the third series, \\"Eels\\", \\"The Strange Tale of the Crack Fox\\" and \\"Party\\". Saboo is a shaman, and a member of the Board of Shaman. He is also a DJ. He is close to Kirk but dislikes Tony Harrison, whom he has attempted to kill, and Naboo, whose propensity for getting in trouble with the Board of Shaman often results in Saboo attempting to make an example of him. During his first appearance, he frequently referred to 'the crunch,' criticising other characters for their lack of familiarity with it. \\"The crunch\\", in this sense, is a high pressure moment, which is a common usage of the term in UK English. He was Maheshwari. =Tony Harrison= Noel Fielding as Tony Harrison, right, with Richard Ayoade as Saboo Tony Harrison is portrayed by Noel Fielding. He was originally created for a 2005 episode of the second series of The Mighty Boosh, \\"Nanageddon\\", and later returned for three episodes of the third series. Tony Harrison is a disembodied pink head,The Mighty Boosh 2 -Commentary - \\"Nanageddon\\" [DVD] BBC DVD with eight or so tentacle-like appendages sprouting from his neck, and a coarse, nasal East London brogue. He is a shaman, and member of the Board of Shaman. Tony is barely mobile within the show, but is frequently outraged at suggestions that this is the case. Tony is married, and makes frequent reference to Mrs Harrison who, as yet, has not been seen on the show. Tony's catchphrase, \\"This is an outrage!\\" has been spoken by him during every appearance in the show. He is an ardent fan of Fleetwood Mac, to the extent of suggesting playing the album Tusk in its entirety while DJing Howard's birthday party with Saboo. Tony first appeared, alongside the rest of the Board of Shaman, in the 2005 TV episode \\"Nanageddon\\", where he and fellow Shaman Saboo are given the task of finding and exorcising the powerful demon Nanatoo, which ends in Saboo ejecting him from his magic carpet out of annoyance. He next appears in the 2007 TV episode, \\"Eels\\", accompanying the other Shaman on Dennis's stag weekend. He then appears briefly in the 2007 TV episode, \\"The Strange Tale of The Crack Fox\\" being Naboo's executioner for the crime of giving a malevolent fox access to shaman juice. His latest appearance was in the 2007 episode \\"Party\\" where he and Saboo DJ'd at Howard's birthday party. =Kirk= Kirk is portrayed by Kirk Gaitskell-Kendrick.

Kirk is renowned by the other members of the Board of Shaman for having the greatest capacity for taking drugs. A deleted scene from \\"Nanageddon\\" reveals that Saboo trained Kirk in the ways of the Shaman. Other recurring characters =Dixon Bainbridge= Dixon Bainbridge was portrayed by Richard Ayoade in the pilot episode, and by Matt Berry throughout the first series. He originally appeared in the pilot and several episodes of the first series of the TV show, and in the 2006 stage show, The Mighty Boosh. Bainbridge is the owner of the Zooniverse, as well as being an admired adventurer. Bob Fossil is deeply in love with Bainbridge, which often results in Bainbridge beating him up. His first appearance is in the pilot episode of the TV series, portrayed by Richard Ayoade. He then appears in \\"Mutants\\", where he steals and mutilates the various animals and keepers of the Zooniverse. He next appears in \\"Tundra\\", a remake of the original pilot episode. He inspires Howard and Vince to travel to the Arctic Tundra and find the Egg of Mantumbi, which Bainbridge later finds himself, escaping the Black Frost by using the heat stored in his own moustache. Bainbridge later tries to sell the Zooniverse to build a road over it in \\"Jungle\\"; a plan which is later averted by Howard and Vince. Bainbridge finally appears in \\"Charlie\\", where he steals credit for Vince's work as a novelist, causing Charlie, the subject of Vince's novels, to appear and attack Bainbridge and his publisher. He was last seen delivering a box to the Nabootique. It was revealed in The Mighty Book of Boosh that Bainbridge had been knighted in a story that involved Bainbridge rescuing his kidnapped wife in Brazil. =Lester Corncrake= Lester Corncrake is portrayed by Rich Fulcher. He appeared in several episodes of the third series of the TV show. Lester Corncrake is a blind vinyl doctor who is close friends with Howard Moon, and also an avid jazz fan. He mistakenly believes he is black. Lester first appeared in the 2007 episode, \\"Journey to the Centre of Punk\\" in which he accompanies Howard on his microscopic journey inside Vince to eliminate the jazz virus he has ingested. He next appears briefly in the 2007 episode \\"The Power of the Crimp\\", disowning Howard after his and Vince's poor performance at a gig at the Velvet Onion where they were sabotaged by their new rivals, the Flighty Zeus.

He was then portrayed by Julian Barratt in the 2004 episode \\"Jungle\\", and the 2005 episode \\"The Priest and the Beast\\" of the TV series. He last appeared in the 2006 stage show, Boosh Live. Rudi is a High Priest of the Order of the Psychedelic Monks. He and Spider Dijon quarrel often, but are very close despite having starkly different personalities. Rudi's behaviour and attitude is extremely puritanical; he thinks of alcohol and women as \\"distractions\\" in stark contrast to the animalistic nature of Spider Dijon, and even went so far as to say that he considered all women \\"strange and evil\\". Whenever he is asked for his name, Rudi's initial response will often be \\"I go by many names...\\" followed by a list of odd names. Some of his many names include \\"Shatoon, Bringer of Corn\\", \\"Mickey Nine, The Dreamweaver\\", \\"Photoshop\\", \\"Trenu, The Boiler\\", \\"Marjorie Keek\\", \\"Mystery Man\\", \\"The Shadow Dweller\\", \\"Diviner of Mysteries\\", \\"Rudi the Prudey\\", \\"Miraculous Mark\\", \\"Domino, the Bounty Hunter\\", \\"Clive\\" and \\"Cillit Bang\\", He is often called \\"Peppercorn\\" by the Dutch.

In Jungle and some other appearances he has a tiny (puppet) body and he appears attached to a mobile backdrop; in most appearances he is of normal size and wears a long purple robe. In all of his appearances on stage or TV, Rudy has large buck teeth, browned skin and a large afro haircut with a door in it, called the door of Kukundu, that can open to take people on bizarre psychedelic trips. He claims to have earned his door by becoming spiritually enlightened as a monk. =Mrs Gideon= Mrs Gideon is portrayed by Victoria Wicks. She was mentioned briefly in The Boosh as Howard's band partner and lover, until the smooth talking Rudy Mancheigo (a precursor to the character of Rudi van DiSarzio) wooed her with empty wisdoms. Mrs Gideon was the Head of Reptiles at the Zooniverse in the first series of the TV show. She was the chief love interest of Howard in Series 1 but as she could not remember his face, his love went unrequited. She was, however, interested in Vince, admiring his paintings, remarking that Vince's portrait of Howard (a featureless face atop a Zooniverse uniform) looked just like him, and going to Vince when her snake was stolen by Bainbridge, much to Howard's disgust and envy. =Old Gregg= Old Gregg is portrayed by Noel Fielding. He was created for \\"The Legend of Old Gregg\\", a 2005 episode of the TV series. He later went on to appear in the 2006 stage show, The Mighty Boosh. Old Gregg is a hermaphroditic merman who occasionally refers to his vagina, which emits a blinding light that \\"makes you feel tingly\\", as his \\"mangina\\". He inhabits a cave below the lake in a village called Black Lake. Old Gregg is in love with Howard Moon; singing a song with him entitled \\"Love Games\\", chronicling his obsession and Howard's reluctance, and later proposing to Howard. A deleted scene from \\"The Legend of Old Gregg\\" documents many rumours about Old Gregg - which number 29, the \\"same number of sailors in Nantucket\\" - including his cannibalistic nature, and his age at over 1,200 years old. It's also noted that he once fainted after reading a pelican's mind, painted his pubic hairs yellow so he could \\"read in the bed\\", and that when he breaks wind people in Africa go \\"Haaaah\\". Before meeting Faye, Old Gregg was obsessed with Slash, the former Guns N' Roses guitarist, to the point of kidnapping him. It was mentioned that it ended badly, involving Gregg being very upset and Slash plummeting from a helicopter down 1000 feet onto some sharp rocks. He also claims that he said, \\"You should build a Velvet Revolver and go and live in it.\\" ‚Äì Velvet Revolver being Slash's new band. Old Gregg is first seen in the 2005 episode, \\"The Legend of Old Gregg\\" in which he meets and falls in love with Howard, who is then rescued by Vince. Old Gregg then joins Howard in the 2006 stage show, after tracking him down and having himself delivered in a box, where they sing a rendition of \\"Love Games\\" and are later seen kissing. Old Gregg last appeared in a deleted scene from the 2007 episode, \\"Party\\", disguised as a woman who has taken a liking to Howard. =The Hitcher= The Hitcher is portrayed by Noel Fielding. He was created for the 1999 stage show Autoboosh, and later appeared in the 2001 radio series, four episodes of the television series, and the 2006 stage show, The Mighty Boosh, in which he is the main antagonist, killing all the main characters at one point. The Hitcher is an old cockney man with long grey hair, green skin, a large Polo mint over his left eye, a top hat and black and red clothing. He is evil, threatening to kill Howard and Vince whenever he meets them, and killing the whole cast in the stage show. His real name is Baboo Yagu, but he is almost always referred to as The Hitcher. He is also a proponent of jazz fusion, especially proficient at playing slap bass. The Hitcher has a confused history; he states in \\"The Hitcher\\" that as a child his parents were ashamed of his small thumb (prompting him to seek out the Hornet Shaman). However, in \\"Eels\\" he reveals that Elsie, proprietor of the Pie and Mash Shop, gave him free eels \\"on account of [him] being an orphan n' that\\" (Eels). In The Mighty Book of Boosh, it is stated The Hitcher trained a man called Ian in the ways of a Cockney. Ian later goes on to become Jack the Ripper, and the Hitcher murders him as punishment for 'slashing Women'. The Hitcher is sometimes accompanied by two short, rotund henchmen called the Piper Twins. The Piper Twins are dressed similarly to the Hitcher, with similar Polo mint eyes, but wear bowler hats and have long red moustaches, made from strawberry bootlaces. They are portrayed by Rich Fulcher and Dave Brown The Hitcher's first appearance was in Autoboosh, where he encounters Howard and Vince, trapping them in a box and then rapping about it. This plot was the template for a 2001 radio episode and a 2004 television episode, both titled \\"Hitcher\\". The Hitcher in series 3. In the television episode, he is proprietor of the \\"Zoo for Animal Offenders\\". He later appears in the 2005 television episode, \\"Fountain of Youth\\", where he plans to use the fountain of youth's magical qualities for himself with the motive to rule the universe. Next he appeared in the episode \\"The Nightmare of Milky Joe\\" as one of the coconut people. He then appeared in the 2006 stage show, The Mighty Boosh, which contained elements of both Autoboosh and the 1999 stage show, Arctic Boosh. His latest appearance was in the 2007 television episode, \\"Eels\\", in which he attempts to run a protection racket on The Nabootique. The Hitcher' appearance changes somewhat between appearances. In the first series episode \\"The Hitcher\\" he has an abnormally large thumb, as well as nose and chin. He explains his huge thumb as stemming from his visiting a Hornet Shaman in the bin of a primary school and asking him to enlarge his thumb by stinging it repeatedly. In the second series his thumb is normally sized. In the third series he has a normal chin and nose. As he melted at the end of prior appearance while washing in the Fountain of Youth, this last change of appearance could stem from being de-aged. In commenting on his eponymous appearance in series one, Fielding said that the Hitcher is based on his grandfather crossed with the character Fagin from the play Oliver Twist. =The Spirit of Jazz/Howlin' Jimmy Jefferson= The Spirit of Jazz as he appears in Electro The Spirit of Jazz/Howlin' Jimmy Jefferson is portrayed by Noel Fielding. He appears in three separate forms over the course of the series. In the series 3 episode, Journey to the Centre of Punk, he is described as having been a famous jazz musician that lived by the swamps of Mississippi. When he was alive he had black and white skin, red eyes and wore a white suit and top hat. When he discovered he was dying of a \\"strange swamp fever\\" he decided to make one final record called Voodoo Scat and mixed it with a drop of his own blood. The series 1 episode \\"Electro\\" is the first appearance of Howlin' Jimmy Jefferson. His ghost is featured in this episode and referred to as the Spirit of Jazz. In this form he looks the same as he did when he was alive but now has a number of supernatural powers and uses them to possess people such as Howard. Howard ignorantly made a deal with him years ago, which the spirit claimed would make Howard one of the greatest jazz musicians of all time (in Yorkshire). Howard later obtains the voodoo scat record that Howlin' Jimmy made and Vince eats a piece of it which causes one of Howlin' Jimmy's blood cells (referred to as the jazz cell) to try and take over Vince's body. Howard along with Lester Corncrake shrink down and enters Vince's body in an attempt to defeat the jazz cell but end up bringing it out of Vince's body with them and making it much larger. It is eventually defeated by an infected safety pin (previously used by Sid Vicious) and walks away complaining, falling over just outside the door of the Nabootique. =The Moon= The Moon is portrayed by Noel Fielding with his face covered in shaving foam. He was originally created for Fielding's 2002 stand-up show Voodoo Hedgehog at the Edinburgh Festival. He later appeared in all episodes of series two and three of The Mighty Boosh, and in the 2006 and 2008 live shows. The Moon always appears to be simple-mindedly cheerful and tells anecdotes which act as bookends between sketches. He has a poor grasp of English, and is described by Tony Harrison as \\"an alabaster retard\\". The Moon made a cameo appearance in the first episode of Noel Fielding's Luxury Comedy, and in June 2013 he made an appearance in a video message at Channel 4's Comedy Gala. =Tommy Nookah= Tommy Nookah was originally portrayed by Richard Ayoade. He appeared in the radio episode \\"Jungle\\" and later in revised form during the first series of the TV show, where he was played by Rich Fulcher rather than Ayoade. In both versions he is the previous owner of the zoo where Howard and Vince work; he is assumed by many to be dead. Howard sees him as an idol and mentor. Howard later enters the jungle room of the zoo to find Tommy. In the TV version Tommy has subsisted for years on nothing but cheese, and as a result his head has turned into cheese. Tommy considers himself King of the Rockers, and flies into a rage when confronted by mods. =The Parka People= The Parka People are a diminutive race of people who wear parkas that completely obscure their features. They appear in the \\"Tundra\\" storyline and the third series episode \\"Party\\". By looking deep into the parka, one can see one's deepest desire. The Parka People guard the Egg of Mantumbi. One of the Parka people appears in the stage show, played by Noel Fielding. =Leroy= Leroy is a recurring character who only appears on screen once in the television series when Vince creates a band which was a glam rock/folk fusion in episode 7 of series 1, \\"Electro\\". He is said to have helped Howard edit the show's script in the series 1 episode \\"Tundra\\", cutting out the scene where Vince has the legs of a ram. Leroy also goes on secret spy skiing missions in the Alps as is mentioned in the series 3 episode \\"Eels\\". He is mentioned in the episode \\"Electro\\" as having tried to form a glam-folk-rock band with Vince. He is played by Olly Ralfe in this short scene. He is also referred to briefly in episode 1 of season 1 Killeroo when Vince states that Leroy had told him earlier he saw Howard dancing for Fossil in the moonlight in \\"little blue pants\\" and is later referenced in \\"The Ape of Death\\" talking to Vince on a cellphone when Howard is \\"haunting\\" him.

He was the brother of Devaki, the mother of the god Krishna ‚Äî who slew Kamsa. Kamsa is described as human in early sources and a rakshasa (demon) in the Puranas. His royal house was called Bhoja and another of his names was Bhojapati. Kamsa was born to King Ugrasena and Queen Padmavati. However, out of ambition and upon the advice of his personal confidantes, Banasura and Narakasura, Kamsa decided to overthrow his father and install himself as the King of Mathura. Therefore, upon the guidance of another advisor, Chanur, Kamsa decided to marry Asti and Prapti, the daughters of Jarasandha, King of Magadha. After a heavenly voice prophesied that Devaki's eighth son will slay him, he imprisoned Devaki and her husband Vasudeva and killed all their children; however Just before birth of the seventh child of Devaki and Vasudeva, Lord Vishnu ordered Goddess Mahamaya to transfer the womb of Devaki to that of Rohini, another wife of Vasudeva. Soon, Rohini gave birth to Devaki's seventh son, named Balarama. The eighth son, Krishna, an avatar of the god Vishnu, was transported to Gokul, where he was raised in the care of Nanda, the head of cowherds. Kamsa sent a host of demons to kill the child Krishna, all of whom Krishna killed. Finally, Krishna arrived in Mathura and slew his uncle Kamsa. Birth In reality, Kamsa was not the biological son of Ugrasena. Once a Gandharva with powers to read the minds was wandering, Ugrasena's wife was having sexual thoughts for her husband. Gandharva, able to read her mind transformed into Ugrasena and participated in the act with her. Ugrasena's wife realized that he was not Ugrasena which led to the gandharva revealing his true form. Gandharva tells about the power of the child who is going to take birth, describing this child being between a human and a Gandharva, however, an angered Ugrasena's wife in rage curses the child to become the ill-named Rakshasa. Gandharva fearing the curse being directed at him, adds to the curse and even he curses the child that he will be troubled by his own and flees the place. In fact, Kamsa in his previous birth was a demon called Kalanemi, who was slain by Lord Vishnu. In childhood, Kamsa was trained by the other Yadavas, who were famous warriors, along with his eight brothers.https://vaniquotes.org/wiki/Kamsa_had_eight_brothers,_headed_by_Kanka,_all_of_them_younger_than_he,_and_when_they_learned_that_their_elder_brother_had_been_killed,_they_combined_together_and_rushed_toward_Krsna_in_great_anger_to_kill_Him Kamsa acquired Jarasandha's attention when the latter tried to invade Mathura. Kamsa single-handedly routed Jarasandha's army. The latter was impressed and made Kamsa his son-in-law. With Jarasandha's support, Kamsa became even more powerful.  Annexation of kingdom  During his wedding in Mathura, Jarasandha brought over his army to escort the Princesses Asti and Prapti. Using the army of Magadha as his political cover, Kamsa overthrew his father after he refused to voluntarily retire from his position. This was done within the confines of the royal palace and the public was not informed. After Ugrasena failed to show up for public events, Kamsa announced his coronation. His warning issued by Yogmaya A frightened Kamsa (left) looks up to the goddess, as she issues the warning. In a prophecy, Kamsa was told that the eighth child of Devaki will kill him. Hearing that, he wanted to kill Devaki, but Vasudeva managed to save her life by promising Kamsa that he (Vasudeva) himself will deliver all their children to Kamsa. Kamsa accepted that promise and spared Devaki because she herself was not a threat to him. In the confines of the prison, Devaki repeatedly conceived and Kamsa cruelly murdered the first six children. Just before the seventh child was born, Lord Vishnu ordered Goddess Mahamaya (beautiful goddess and the controller of Maya) to place the seventh child of Devaki in the womb of Rohini. Thus, facilitating God Sesha's descent or avatar,the seventh child was raised by surrogate mother, Rohini and was named Balarama, Shri Krishna's elder brother. Whereas, Lord Shri Hari-Vishnu Himself, was soon to appear as the eighth son of Devaki, he ordered Yogamaya to take birth from the womb of Yashoda. Facilitating God Vishnu's descent or avatar, Yogmaya (the controller of the darkness and ignorance) had put the guards of Kamsa to sleep or a state of trance. At that time also, Vasudev, obeying Shri Hari's order, took BalKrishna to Nand- Yashoda's house, bringing back the Baby girl, Yogmaya. Presuming this baby as Devaki's eighth child, Kamsa was about to kill her by slamming her down on the ground, but the girl slipped out of his hands. Taking her cosmic form, Yogamaya warned Kamsa, \\"The eighth child, who shall kill you, has been born. He is in Gokul!\\"  Death  Krishna kill Kamsa The seventh child, Balarama, was saved when he was moved to Rohini's womb. The eighth child born to Devaki and Vasudeva was Krishna. Krishna was saved from Kamsa's wrath and raised by Vasudeva's relative Nanda and Yasoda, a cowherd couple. After Krishna grew up and returned to the kingdom, Kamsa was eventually killed by Krishna, as was originally predicted by the divine prophecy. Krishna kicked Kamsa on the chest and put his foot on him, thus killing him. His eight brothers, headed by Kanka, were also killed by Balarama. Following this, Ugrasena was reinstated as the King of Mathura.

The series was created by Louis St. Clair and Jorge Zamacona, and executive produced by Aaron Spelling, E. Duke Vincent and Jorge Zamacona. Synopsis The show follows an elite taskforce, with members pulled from the different branches of law enforcement (DEA, United States Marshals, LAPD, ATF, FBI) as they track down Los Angeles's 100 most wanted fugitives and struggle to balance their work and personal lives. Members of the task force include Conrad Rose (Gary Cole), the Team Leader from L.A. Metro SWAT who is considered the moral center of the unit. Jimmy McGloin (Ryan Hurst), an ATF agent and a bona fide card- carrying conservative, Carla Merced (Rashida Jones), a former Naval Intelligence officer and expert hostage negotiator. Tommy Rodriquez (Benjam√≠n Ben√≠tez), an FBI agent not above using his good looks and charm to stop any criminal, Rodney Gronbeck (Josey Scott), an LAPD officer and a tech genius. Joe Vacco (Brendan Kelly), a DEA agent who is currently living at the team's warehouse headquarters after having getting kicked out of his own place and Eddie Drake (Lee Tergesen), an eight-year veteran of the U.S. Marshals Service and graduate of the L.A. Metro Police Academy. As the team tracks down criminals, often using unconventional (and legally questionable) methods, they discover there is a fine line between justice and the law. The series was canceled after the first season, at the end of a cliffhanger dealing with whether the group would be prosecuted for overstepping their bounds. Cast * Gary Cole as Lt.

Cacapon Mountain is a folded mountain ridge, belonging to the Appalachian Ridge and Valley Province. Cacapon Mountain spans 16 miles (26 km) NNE to the Potomac River near Great Cacapon. From its southern point, Cacapon Mountain rises from the landscape north of Bloomery in northeastern Hampshire County. The mountain's western flank forms a series of steep hollows such as Horsebone Hollow and the hollow that bears Falling Spring Run. Beyond these hollows lies the Cacapon River which parallels the Cacapon Mountain until it joins the Potomac River. Between Bloomery and the Morgan County line, Cacapon Mountain forms the border between Hampshire and Frederick County in Virginia. While in Morgan County, the majority of Cacapon Mountain lies in Cacapon Resort State Park. The mountain forms a series of warm springs that flow from the Devonian Oriskany (Ridgeley) sandstone along the eastern flank of its anticline such as those at Berkeley Springs. Cacapon Mountain's northern end is located at the scenic Panorama Overlook off West Virginia Route 9 that overlooks three states and the confluence of the Cacapon and Potomac Rivers.

Kelly Rounds, or Castle Killibury is an Iron Age hill fort in Cornwall, England, United Kingdom. It is situated beside the A39 trunk road approximately two miles east of Wadebridge.Ordnance Survey: Landranger map sheet 200 Newquay & Bodmin The site is north of the village of St Mabyn, approximately 300 metres east of Three Holes Cross on the border of the parish of Egloshayle. Radiocarbon dating has dated the occupation of Kelly Rounds to between 400 and 100 BC. More carbon dating has dated a pre-hill fort occupation as between 1250 and 950 BC.Cornish Guardian page 8 Wednesday July 142010 Description The fort was described by Craig Weatherhill as \\"a bivallate Iron Age hill fort 230m in diameter. The ramparts, each about 3.0m high externally, are widely spaced and fronted by ditches (often flooded) 1.8m deep. The north side of the fort is well preserved, but to the south of the lane the defences have been ploughed almost flat. The northern half of a rectangular annexe survives on the west side of the fort, the rest was obliterated by the building of Sandylands Farm. On the opposite side of the fort cropmarks and traces of two contiguous annexes have been detected. Excavations found the inner ditch to have been cut 2.8m into the bedrock. It also showed that the earliest occupation of the site was during the 11th or 10th century BC. It is not known if this was before the defences were built. The fort has long been a leading candidate as the location of Arthur's home fort of Celliwig (along with Castle Canyke), but only two post-Roman sherds have been unearthed.\\"\\"Weatherhill, Craig (1985) Cornovia: Ancient Sites of Cornwall & Scilly.

Built at the end of the 19th Century, the Chacabuco had a remarkably long and varied career spanning nearly half a century. History The Chacabuco was built as a private venture by Armstrong Whitworth to a typical Elswick cruiser design, and was launched on 4 July 1898, under the provisional name of Fourth of July; she was acquired by Chile in 1902, just before the end of the Argentine‚ÄìChilean naval arms race. The Imperial Japanese Navy cruiser Takasago was the sister ship of the Chacabuco. During her lengthy career the Chacabuco performed numerous tasks: apart from routine patrol and hydrographic duties, she was notable for her role in maintaining order in the aftermath of the 1906 Valpara√≠so earthquake; her involvement in the Santa Mar√≠a School massacre in 1907; her visit to Britain for the fleet review to mark the coronation of King George V in 1911; and her relief effort to the victims of the 1922 Vallenar earthquake. The Chacabuco was put into reserve in 1928. In 1941, as Chile strove to maintain its neutrality during World War II, the Chacabuco was brought out of reserve despite her age: by then there were no other cruisers available to the Chilean Navy. She underwent modernization, with her armament changed to six 6 inch/50 guns and ten 20 mm anti-aircraft guns. Thereafter she served as the flagship of the Chilean Navy on several occasions, before becoming a midshipmen training cruiser from 1949 to 1950. The Chacabuco went out of service in December 1950; she was struck on 15 December 1959, and was sold to the Compa√±√≠a de Acero del Pac√≠fico for scrapping.

Unlike most law school courses, a trial practice class has very little discussion of substantive law, and is focused on the practical application of public speaking, narrative, and using body language to communicate a particular set of events to the triers of fact. Trial practice also contains elements of strategy, teaching students how to decide the order in which witnesses should testify, when exhibits should be introduced, and how to trap opposing witnesses into giving testimony that damages their side. Evidence is the area of substantive law most reinforced by a trial practice course, with students learning how to apply evidence law in a real-life setting, including learning when they can object to questions asked of witnesses, what objections to raise, and how to effectively present objections. Trial practice courses may have a classroom component. Also, trial practice courses will usually have an ongoing \\"lab\\" component where an attorney will instruct a small group of students on trial skills and assist them in honing their craft. Often, students practice against one another in mock trials throughout the course; for example, students may be divided into groups of 4, with each group containing two teams who practice against one another in mock trials.

Each application domain has its own virtual address space which scopes the resources for the application domain using that address space. Properties A CLI application domain is contained within an operating system process. A process may contain many application domains. Application domains have isolation properties similar to that of operating system processes: * Multiple threads can exist within a single application domain. * An application within a domain can be stopped without affecting the state of another domain in the same process. * A fault or exception in one domain does not affect an application in another domain or crash the entire process that hosts the domains. * Configuration information is part of a domain's scope, not the scope of the process. * Each domain can be assigned different security access levels. * Code in one domain cannot directly access code in another. In this sense, a CLI is like a mini-operating system. It runs a single process that contains a number of sub-processes, or application domains. The advantage of application domains is that running multiple application domains may require fewer resources, such as memory, than running multiple operating system processes. Communication between domains still requires marshalling, so the overheads can be closer to using multiple processes than to communicating within a single domain. Inter-domain communications Direct communication cannot be achieved across application domains. However, application domains can still talk to each other by passing objects via marshalling by value (unbound objects), marshalling by reference through a proxy (application- domain-bound objects). There is a third type of object called a context-bound object which can be marshalled by reference across domains and also within the context of its own application domain. Because of the verifiable type-safety of managed code, a CLI can provide fault isolation between domains at a much lower cost than an operating system process can. The static type verification used for isolation does not require the same process switches or hardware ring transitions that an operating system process requires. Managed code Application domains are a purely managed code concept. Any included native/unmanaged code (e.g., C++) is largely unaware of them. Static variables seem to be shared across domains, callbacks can be problematic, and any memory corruption bugs in one domain is likely to corrupt other domains.

The 2nd Infantry Division Band was inactivated in August 2015. In the summer of 1998, the region of South Korea where CRC lies was subjected to severe rains that caused deadly flooding and damage to CRC. Although no US service members lost their lives during the floods, many Korean nationals and domestic livestock perished in the flood waters. A large portion of the hill behind CRC washed away. A massive mudslide devastated the southern half of CRC. For weeks, Camp Red Cloud went without a main PX as it was destroyed by the floods. Several barracks (officer quarters) were leveled in the destruction along with the golf Pro Shop located adjacent to the helipad. The 2ID museum also suffered severe damage in the torrent of mud and water. Camp Red Cloud has been the site of various protests and demonstrations against the US presence in Korea. The largest such protest was in 2002 when Korean protesters tossed Molotov cocktails and cut holes in the fences around the post.

Richard was born to a M√©tis family in Camperville, Manitoba. She has long been active in promoting language retention, housing, training, cultural awareness and business enterprise among and for Manitoba's aboriginal population. She became the director of the Manitoba Association of Native Languages in the 1980s, and held this position for almost a decade. In 1997, she was appointed by Winnipeg Mayor Susan Thompson to co-chair the North Main Task Force, examining social problems in north Winnipeg's aboriginal community. She was the first Chief Executive Officer (CEO) of Thunderbird House in north Winnipeg, which opened its doors in 2000. Although this was intended as a tourist destination, it soon became primarily a social outreach centre for the many low-income persons living in the area. Under Richard's leadership, Thunderbird House became active in programs to assist aboriginal youth escape solvent abuse, gang life and the sex trade. Richard was also a president of the Aboriginal Council of Winnipeg, and a former executive director of the Indian and M√©tis Friendship Centre of Winnipeg. She also owned the Teepee Restaurant in Winnipeg. In 2000, she was admitted to the Order of Manitoba. She campaigned for the Progressive Conservative Party of Manitoba in the 1999 provincial election, in the constituency of Point Douglas. Richard's campaign was part of an effort by Gary Filmon's government to increase its profile in the aboriginal community. She received 1224 votes (19.56%), an improvement over previous Conservative candidacies in the area. The winner was George Hickes of the New Democratic Party. The following year, Richard crossed to the Liberal Party of Canada and ran as that party's candidate in Winnipeg North Centre for the 2000 federal election. In explaining this move, Richard told a Winnipeg Free Press reporter that she had long supported the Progressive Conservatives at the provincial level and the Liberals at the federal level. She received 6,755 votes, finishing second against New Democrat Judy Wasylycia-Leis. She died on September 9, 2010, while undergoing treatment after a kidney transplant.

Although the term can be used in the context of physical training, it most often occurs in the academic world. Most high schools, colleges, and universities run final exams at the end of a particular academic term, typically a quarter or semester, or more traditionally at the end of a complete degree course. Isolated purpose and common practice The purpose of the test is to make a final review of the topics covered and assessment of each student's knowledge of the subject. A final is technically just a greater form of a \\"unit test\\". They have the same purpose, finals are simply larger. Not all courses or curricula culminate in a final exam; instructors may assign a term paper or final project in some courses. The weighting of the final exam also varies. It may be the largest‚Äîor only‚Äîfactor in the student's course grade; in other cases, it may carry the same weight as a midterm exam, or the student may be exempted. Not all finals need be cumulative, however, as some simply cover the material presented since the last exam. For example, a microbiology course might only cover fungi and parasites on the final exam if this were the policy of the professor, and all other subjects presented in the course would then not be tested on the final exam. Prior to the examination period most students in the Commonwealth have a week or so of intense revision and study known as swotvac. In the UK, most universities hold a single set of \\"Finals\\" at the end of the entire degree course. In Australia, the exam period varies, with high schools commonly assigning one or two weeks for final exams, but the university period‚Äîsometimes called \\"exam week\\" or just \\"exams\\"‚Äîmay stretch to a maximum of three weeks. Practice varies widely in the United States; \\"finals\\" or the \\"finals period\\" at the university level constitutes two or three weeks after the end of the academic term, but sometimes exams are administered in the last week of instruction. Some institutions designate a \\"study week\\" or \\"reading period\\" between the end of instruction and the beginning of finals, during which no examinations may be administered. Students at many institutions know the week before finals as \\"dead week.\\" Most final exams incorporate the reading material that has been assigned throughout the term. Though common in French tertiary institutions, final exams are not often assigned in French high schools. However, French high school students hoping to continue their studies at university level will sit a national exam, known as the Baccalaur√©at. In some countries and locales that hold standardised exams, it is customary for schools to administer mock examinations, with formats modelling the real exam. Students from different schools are often seen exchanging mock papers as a means of test preparation. Take-home finals A take-home final is an examination at the end of an academic term that is usually too long or complex to be completed in a single session as an in-class final. There is usually a deadline for completion, such as within one or two weeks of the end of the semester. A take-home final differs from a final paper, often involving research, extended texts and display of data. Schedule In some cases, schools will run on a modified schedule for final exams to allow students more time to do their exams. However, this is not necessarily the case for every institution.

The term \\"Makhzen\\" is also popularly used in Morocco as a word meaning \\"State\\" or \\"Government\\". Etymology The word makhzen () literally means \\"warehouse\\" in Maghrebi Arabic (from khazana 'to store up'NOAD), where the king's civil servants used to receive their wages; but this usage of the word became in Moroccan Arabic synonymous with the elite. It is likely a metonymy related to taxes, which the makhzen used to collect; the term may also refer to the state or its actors, but this usage is increasingly rare and is primarily used by the older generation. The word has also been adopted into Spanish and Portuguese with a different meaning, as almac√©n and armaz√©m (with addition of the Arabic definite article), and into French and Italian as magasin (meaning 'store') and magazzino. It came into the English language from Middle French as magazine, originally referring to a storehouse for ammunition and later to publications. With the \\"store\\" meaning, it was also adopted from French into Russian as –ú–∞–≥–∞–∑–∏–Ω. In the Berber culture of Morocco, the Berber equivalent of mekhzen ('warehouse') would be agadir. Berber tribes also considered the agadir (warehouse of the tribe's crops and valuables) as a powerhouse guarded and managed through a legal system. Makhzen in Morocco The Makhzen is a very ancient notion in Morocco, it roughly coincides with the notion of the feudal state predating the French protectorate in Morocco. BilƒÅd al-makhzen ('the land of the makhzen') was the term for the areas under central government authority, while those areas still run by tribal authority were known as bilƒÅd as-siba ('the land of dissidence'). Hubert Lyautey, who served as resident-general of Morocco from 1912 until 1925 during the era of the protectorate, was a fervent proponent of indirect colonisation, especially in Berber-speaking areas. Lyautey maintained the role of the Makhzen and even enhanced it by giving important roles to local notables such as Thami El Glaoui. Local notables acted as a relay between the population and the French authorities.

It is a variation of the Multiverse concept that existed in DC Comics before Crisis on Infinite Earths and was devised by Mark Waid and Grant Morrison. The idea, described in The Kingdom #2 as \\"the vast interconnected web of parallel time-lines which comprise all reality\\", was an attempt by Waid to resolve the many tangled continuity issues that were supposed to have been solved by 1985's Crisis on Infinite Earths. Keith Dallas and Jason Sacks write, \\"Through Hypertime, Waid sought to resolve the contradictions in DC's continuity once and for all. Indeed, Hypertime allows for contradictions because anything that didn't make sense can be attributed to overlapping timelines.\\" Concept Hypertime is a network of alternate timelines that branch off from the DC Universe. It has been analogized to a river network that branches out, and then runs 'up stream' to feed itself, like an ouroboros or tesseract. These timelines sometimes overlap with each other, causing alterations in reality. Characters can cross from one timeline to another if needed.The Kingdom #2 (Feb. 1999) Hypertime has been used as a device to explain continuity errors. As such, it is not universally acclaimed. Some fans welcomed the idea as an explanation for earlier continuity errors while others criticized it for being a license to create more narrative problems. The Hypertime concept was first introduced in The Kingdom, Mark Waid's sequel to Kingdom Come. It exists within the larger Multiverse used within DC Comics publications. It is a \\"cosmic construct\\" collecting many of the fictional universes in which the published stories take place. The worlds in this multiverse share a common space and fate, and its structure has changed several times in the history of DC Comics. Writer Mark Waid stated that \\"The possibilities are endless. Hypertime is an unashamed reaction to nearly 15 years of comics being made ‚Äòmore realistic,‚Äô less ‚Äòlarger than life.‚Äô As far as we‚Äôre concerned, DC Comics shouldn't be about rules and regulations and ‚Äòcan‚Äôt happen‚Äôs and ‚Äòshouldn‚Äôt be‚Äôs; they should be about anything and everything that tells a good story and gets fans excited.\\" =52= Mister Mind, disguised as Skeets, refers to Waverider as \\"the seer of Hypertime\\".52 Week Twenty-Seven (Nov. 2006) =Booster Gold= An older Booster Gold, while explaining his duties to his son Rip Hunter, mentions the concept of Hypertime.Booster Gold (vol. 2) #30 (May 2010) =Multiversity= Hypertime is used to explain the formation and alteration of the 52 universes formed at the end of 52.The Multiversity Guidebook (March 2015) =Rebirth= Hypertime has been mentioned several times in the Prime Earth continuity.The Flash (vol. 5) #22 (May 2017)Justice League (vol. 3) #25 (July 2017) See also * Multiple histories * Multiverse (Marvel Comics) References Further reading  External links *Unofficial Hypertime Website Time and Hypertime Continuity (fiction) DC Comics dimensions Physics in fiction ","title":"Hypertime"},{"id":"2851028","text":"The Serengeti is a breed of domestic cat, first developed by crossing a Bengal (domestic and wild hybrid) and an Oriental Shorthair. Recognized and registered by The International Cat Association (TICA), no other first generation crosses can be registered as Serengeti. From the Bengal √ó Oriental cross came the first foundation Serengeti. Breeders then worked with the cat to produce a cat that resembles the breed profile set by TICA. Created by biologisthttps://cattime.com/cat-breeds/serengeti#/slide/1 Karen Sausman of Kingsmark Cattery in California in 1994, the breed is still in the development stages, but the ultimate aim is to produce a cat that looks similar to a serval, without using any recent wild cat blood. (Bengal cats originate from hybridization of leopard cats and domestic cats. Most Bengal cats used in Serengeti breeding programs are many generations removed from these origins and possess few genetic contributions of the wild forebears except alleles affecting coat color.) Serengetis are spotted cats, with long legs and very large, round tipped ears. They have a long neck which blends with the base of the skull without tapering. Males are generally slightly larger and heavier than females and can weigh between 10 and 15 lbs; females generally weigh between 8 and 12 lbs.Cat Breed Junction. (2009). Serengeti Cat... Cat Facts. Retrieved December 11, 2012, from http://www.catbreedsjunction.com/serengeti- cat.html They are recognized by TICA in tabby, ebony silver, ebony smoke and solid black. A group of breeders in the UK are currently working towards getting TICA to also recognise the snow spotted (a.k.a. lynx point) variety. The tabby is known as the brown-spotted in the UK. However spots can be black or dark brown on a tan, light beige or gold background. The silver has black spots on a silver background. Ghost spotting can sometimes be seen on the solid black version.

It was founded in 1986 by a prominent group of jurists and human rights activists in Asia and serves to promote civil and political rights, as well as economic, social and cultural rights. AHRC endeavours to achieve the following objectives stated in the Asian Charter: \\"Many Asian states have guarantees of human rights in their constitutions, and many of them have ratified international human rights instruments. However, there continues to be a wide gap between rights enshrined in these documents and the abject reality that denies people of their rights. Asian states must take urgent action to implement the human rights of their citizens and residents.\\" Its sister organization, the Asian Legal Resource Centre (ALRC), holds General Consultative Status with the United Nations Economic and Social Council (ECOSOC). The AHRC and ALRC are both based in Hong Kong.  AHRC and Human Rights Issues in Asia  On the eve of the International Day of the Disappeared, AHRC ranked the Philippines among the top eight countries in Asia where forced disappearances of activists are not just rampant but are carried out with impunity. Sri Lanka heads the list (statement posted on its website www.ahrchk.net). The activists took part in the recent Human Rights School Session of the AHRC for 2007. The AHRC listed the other countries where forced disappearances take place with impunity: Pakistan, Indonesia, Bangladesh, Nepal, Thailand, Philippines and parts of India. Further, AHRC had evidence to show that Myanmar junta uses broom-wielding gangs or Swan-ar Shin heavies not guns to crush dissent (fuel price protests). On September 28, 2007, the Asian Human Rights Commission (AHRC) criticized the Writ of Amparo and Habeas Data (Philippines) for being insufficient: \\"Though it responds to practical areas it is still necessary that further action must be taken in addition to this. The legislative bodies, House of Representatives and Senate, should also initiate its own actions promptly and without delay. They must enact laws which ensure protection of rights‚Äîlaws against torture and enforced disappearance and laws to afford adequate legal remedies to victims.\\" AHRC objected since the writ failed to protect non-witnesses, even if they too face threats or risk to their lives.

The single, which was remixed by Tom Lord-Alge, reached number 31 in Australia. The single remix of \\"Josie\\" was later featured on the band's Greatest Hits. The music video for \\"Josie\\" stars Alyssa Milano as the object of Hoppus' affection in a high school setting. The original video was to depict the band performing on a sinking cruise liner, but the video was scrapped after filming. It is the band's last single to feature drummer Scott Raynor. Background \\"Josie\\" was named after the dog of Elyse Rogers, vocalist for Dance Hall Crashers, and the girl in the song is fictional. \\"It is about a common feeling that everyone can understand, which is being stoked on a girl,\\" Hoppus told Billboard in 1998. The lyrics describe an ideal girlfriend who tolerates the narrator's flaws and shares his taste in music. The line \\"Yeah my girlfriend, likes UL and DHC\\" is a reference to the bands Unwritten Law and Dance Hall Crashers. The line \\"She brings me Mexican Food from Sombreros just because\\" is a reference to the Sombrero Mexican Food restaurant located in San Diego.Hoppus, 2001. p. 70http://www.sombreromex.com/about-us The song is composed in the key of B major and is set in time signature of common time with a very fast tempo of 200 beats per minute. Hoppus's vocal range spans from G#3 to F#4. In Australia, the song spent eight weeks in the top 50 and 24 weeks in the top 100, where it peaked at number 31 on July 6. Music video For the group's third music video, the band attempted to take a more serious route and turned to director Jason Matzner and his collaborator Brendan Lambe. Hoppus' original idea was that the band would be playing on the deck of an old cruise liner as it sank. The band would play in real time as everything around them exploded in slow motion. Gradually, the ship would reach catastrophe (\\"people running, sparks flying, superstructure collapsing\\") before the ship sinks into the dark waters as the songs ends with the line \\"everything's gonna be fine.\\" As that video would have cost the band's label, MCA, millions of dollars, an alternative was settled on: the band is performing in a basement when one musician hits a pipe with his guitar, causing the room to flood. The video was shot in the backlot of Universal Studios and was director Matzner's first video. \\"Filming the first 'Josie' video was awful,\\" Hoppus remembered in 2000. \\"We had to bring old equipment that we were willing to ruin.\\" The trio were unhappy with the shockingly cold water, and DeLonge cut his head open on shrapnel that was floating around in water. When the band received the first edit, the band members decided to scrap it and start over. The band returned to director Darren Doane, who also shot the videos for \\"M+M's\\" and \\"Dammit\\".Hoppus, 2001. p. 66 Shot at Westlake High School, in Thousand Oaks, California, the video stars Alyssa Milano as the girl of Hoppus' affection.Hoppus, 2001. p. 75 \\"I felt really bad for her because she showed up on the set and it was just her and a bunch of perverted dudes who did nothing but stare at her breasts. They couldn't even help themselves,\\" Hoppus recalled in 2001.Hoppus, 2001. p. 77 The food fight scene was completed in one take by necessity, as the cafeteria was destroyed afterward. \\"All those kids had to sit around all day outside in the summer and, at the end of the day, they were rewarded by letting them nail us with tons of food,\\" said Hoppus. Although \\"Josie\\" did not receive extensive MTV play, it was regardless viewed as an incredible success for the upstart band. A snippet of the original \\"Josie\\" video surfaced online in 2011.

His innovations had a substantial influence on the motorcycle and racing business. History =College and racing years= Crocker graduated from Armour Institute, part of Illinois Institute of Technologyhttps://admissions.iit.edu/graduate/programs/armour-college- engineering, with an engineering degree. His first job out of college was with the Aurora Automatic Machine Company; he worked in the motorcycle division, engineering new products. Although he was an engineer, he loved motorcycles and racing, competing in and winning many endurance contests. During his racing years, Crocker met Oscar Hedstr√∂m and Charles Hendee, the president and chief engineer of Indian Motorcycle of Springfield, Massachusetts. A close friendship developed between Crocker, Hendee and Hedstrom that eventually evolved into a full-time position for Crocker at Indian. =Marriage and move to the West Coast= Crocker's personal life was deeply affected by the 1912 accident in which the famous board track motorcycle racer Eddie Hasha was severely injured in a race and died from his injuries shortly after. Crocker later met Hasha's widow, Gertrude Jefford Hasha, in 1919, while both were working at the Indian branch in Denver, Colorado. They were married in 1924 and had one son also named Albert. In that same year, Crocker took over the Indian motorcycle dealership in Kansas City. The dealership functioned as a distributor for several Midwest states. Eventually, however Crocker moved to Los Angeles. Crocker motorcycles In Los Angeles, Crocker bought Freed Indian, an established Indian Motorcycle dealership. Al Crocker and Paul Bigsby in 1931 introduced a dirt track racing motorcycle. Crocker invented the Crocker single-cylinder speedway bike. It became the bike of choice for many of the best riders on the Pacific coast when speedway racing was at its height. Crocker ultimately built about thirty speedway bikes. He later sold his Indian dealership and moved on to create Crocker Motorcycle Company in a small factory at 1346 Venice Blvd in downtown Los Angeles. The Crocker Twin In the mid-1930s, Crocker and Bigsby began to work on a heavyweight, high-performance, overhead valve, v-twin motorcycle and in 1936 the first Crocker rolled out of the factory. Crocker knew there was a good market for high-speed touring bikes, but even he was surprised when he received more orders than he could possibly fill for his new 1936 Crocker \\"Small Tank\\" 61 cubic inch 1000 cc Hemi-Head model. The Crocker Twin was widely regarded as the fastest production motorcycle in the world. In 1939 Crocker introduced a new and improved model named the Crocker \\"Big Tank\\". However, as Crocker was producing during the height of the Depression, it became increasingly difficult for him to manufacture vehicles in small quantities, and in 1942 he abandoned production of motorcycles altogether. Al Crockers son worked in the Crocker Motorcycle factory machining oil pumps and other parts on weekends and between School. In 1998 Al Crocker Jr. attended the induction of his late father into the Motorcycle Hall of Fame and accepted the medal on his behalf. Al Crocker Jr.now lives in northern California with his wife Mary Jane. They and their entire family attended both the 2006 and 2007 \\"Legend Of The Motorcycle\\" Concours d'Elegance at the Ritz Carlton in Half Moon Bay California where the legendary brand his father created over seventy years ago was one of two featured marques. Today Al enjoys a close relationship with the team at the resurrected Crocker Motorcycle Company. Many Crocker Twin motorcycles are still in existence and are among the most highly prized collectible motorcycles today. Crocker parts are still sought after and coveted. The most recent conservative estimate of the value of an original Crocker in restored condition hovers between $225,000 and $300,000 U.S. The company The Crocker Motorcycle Company of today was resurrected in 1997 by Michael Schacht and Markus Karalash to produce the two original models, the Big Tank and Small Tank models that were manufactured by Al Crocker in his factory at 1346 Venice Blvd in Los Angeles.

Publication history Garokk first appeared in Astonishing Tales vol. 1 #2 (November 1970) and was created by Roy Thomas and Jack Kirby. Fictional character biography Garokk was originally a sailor from Great Britain, whose ship the H.M.S. Drake crashed on the shores of Antarctica during the 15th century. The sailor was swept overboard and taken by a warm stream to the Savage Land. Wandering the Savage Land, the sailor entered the lands of the Sun People, who worshipped the Sun god Garokk. The sailor found a statue of Garokk with a cup beneath it. Thirsty, the sailor drank from the cup, but was chased off by the Sun People. The sailor escaped and managed to return to the Kingdom of England, but found that he had become immortal after drinking the potion. Over time, the sailor's body became a living, organic, stone-like substance until he looked identical to the statue of Garokk. Nearly five centuries after he had left, the sailor returned to the Savage Land and discovered that the Sun People believed that their god would return and their high priestess Zaladane waged war as a form of worship to him. The sailor, now known as the Petrified Man encountered Ka- Zar and related his story to Ka-Zar. The Petrified Man allied himself with Ka- Zar and journeyed with him to the Savage Land to prevent his worshippers from waging war there. The Petrified Man gained energy powers, and transformed into pure energy. The Petrified Man managed to stop Zaladane and her people by dissolving their weapons, and then returned to his physical form. However, the Petrified Man then went mad and believed himself to be Garokk himself. Garokk sought to destroy all life on Earth to bring about peace, and he and Ka-Zar fought each other. On Zaladane's instructions, Ka-Zar lured him inside an underground pool which turned Garokk human and mortal again. His age caught up with him rapidly and he died shortly afterwards. As he died of extreme old age, he recovered his sanity and then his corpse turned to ash.Astonishing Tales vol. 1 #2-5 Zaladane later captured an adventurer called Kirk Marston and magically resurrected Garokk in the body of Kirk Marston using the ashes of the deceased previous Petrified Man. Marston's body quickly transformed into a duplicate of Garokk's own. With Zaladane, Garokk attempted to unite the Savage Land tribes by forcing them to erect a colossal city for them. Garokk and Zaladane fought the X-Men and Ka-Zar; Garokk was defeated by Cyclops and fell down into the city's thermal shaft.Uncanny X-Men #115-116 The X-Men believed Garokk to be dead. The X-Men's enemy Magneto later found Garokk, who had transformed: he was larger and half his body had turned into crystal while the other half became like molten rock, and his intelligence was dulled. Magneto forced Garokk to serve as the guardian of his Antarctic base. In this role, he fought the X-Man Storm, but again fell in a deep pit.Uncanny X-Men #149 Again Garokk survived and he returned to his normal size and appearance. When the Savage Land was destroyed by the alien Terminus, Terminus was defeated by the Avengers, his armor ruptured and Terminus himself left to die, but it turned out that this Terminus was just an impostor. Garokk found a suit of Terminus armor and under mental control (presumably by the real Terminus) entered it and started destroying the remainder of the Savage Land. The X-Men fought this \\"Terminus\\" and destroyed the armor to reveal Garokk. Garokk regained his free will and together with a machine made by the High Evolutionary, he restored the tropical environment to the Savage Land. This process infused Garokk's essence into the land, causing him to cease to exist as an individual entity.Uncanny X-Men Annual #12 Garokk returned years later as an enemy of Ka-Zar, but Ka-Zar defeated him.Ka-Zar Annual '97Ka-Zar vol. 2 #20 Garokk later appeared in the Savage Land, observing as the High Evolutionary took a number of newly mutated Zebra People children.Avengers Vol. 5 #12 He then led the Avengers to the High Evolutionary's hidden base.Avengers Vol. 5 #13 (Aug 2013) Powers and abilities A human is transformed into a manifestation of Garokk by the mutagenic effects of liquid from the fiery underground pool in the Savage Land. Garokk's skin and much, perhaps all, of his body tissue are transformed into organic, stone-like substances, giving him gray skin that seems rock-like and \\"petrified\\" in appearance. He has superhuman stamina and his petrified body also makes him difficult to injure. Garokk has the ability to project tremendous amounts of heat, light, and concussive force from his eyes. He can tap into other energy sources to replenish his own powers. Garokk has the ability to create dimensional warps with the energy projected from his eyes, and is capable of transporting an entire city through one of these dimensional portals. He has the ability to change his size and transform into a being of pure energy, and then back into his stone-like physical form at will. Garokk can also manipulate matter on a sub-atomic scale; he could rearrange the very fabric of the Savage Land. He has a limited telepathic ability which allows him to learn of the activities of his worshippers through his dreams and his mental connection to his followers. Garokk is immortal; he does not age and even when his body is destroyed, he can be returned to life. Immersion in the pool which gave him his powers will cause Garokk to revert to human form. He can be magically forced by Zaladane to respond to her summons or else suffer intense pain.

The Marvel Mangaverse is a series of comic books published by Marvel Comics from 2000 to 2002, with a sequel \\"New Mangaverse\\" released in late 2005 and early 2006. The series depicts an alternate (or possibly two alternates, see below) Marvel universe, where its characters are drawn and portrayed in a manga-like style. Four volumes were published for the series, two of which were connected by a continuing story arc with multiple Marvel characters, while the third and fourth series each started a new story and focused on a single character, which were Spider-Man Mangaverse and Jean Grey of an alternate version (apparently) of X-Men Mangaverse. Official Handbook to the Marvel Universe: Alternate Universes 2005 has given the numerical designation of \\"Marvel Mangaverse\\" as Earth-2301. The majority of the artwork in the first volume was shared between different artists, each of whom delivered one issue, with book- ends by Ben Dunn, whose work is best known on the comic series Ninja High School. Dunn also did the entirety of the artwork for volume 2 of Mangaverse. The artwork for the five issue miniseries New Mangaverse: The Rings of Fate was done by Tommy Ohtsuka. Volume 1 The Avengers transformed their Iron Avengers into the Ultimate Iron Man robot. Plot: Three years prior to the story Dr. Banner discovered the Negative Zone, a dimension which contains vast amounts of energy, and was tricked by the terrorist organization HYDRA into building \\"the Energy Well\\", a means of harvesting this energy, to power their weapon of mass destruction. However, when the weapon was fired it created a massive EMP which caused a global blackout for twenty-four hours, killing thousands. During this time of crisis, Prince Namor of Atlantis led an invasion of the surface but was stopped by Iron Man, who disappeared soon after. Tony Stark rescued the now insane Dr. Banner and suppressed any memory of his involvement from his mind with a Cerebral Driver. Various forces conspire to create a second Energy Well, which leads to the emergence of Dormammu into Earth's dimension, who is defeated by the combined power of Thor and the willpower and strength of the heroes assembled to battle him. Serving Dormammu is a massive, Godzilla-esque incarnation of the Hulk- separate from Banner, who is destroyed by Thor quickly after Thor incarnates using Banner as a focus. Tony Stark reappears during the first volume, reduced to a head, in an advisory role to the Mangaverse incarnation of the Avengers. Iron Man also appears in the form of a number of large robots that resemble famous Super Robot anime mechas. These machines combine into a still larger mecha, which he calls Ultimate Ironman. This Mecha would reappear in Volume 2, destroyed in combat with T'Channa, sister of the Black Panther and the second Mangaverse character to be known as Dr. Doom. Characters Iron Maiden - (Antoinette \\"Toni\\" Stark) A former S.H.I.E.L.D. agent, the sister of Tony Stark, and current owner of Stark Industries. Unlike her brother, Toni has made her identity public and opened defense contracts with the U.S. military. She is referred to as \\"ironbitch\\" by the Wasp in the first issue of the series when she is nearly clipped by Stark as she returns from an unrevealed location/mission (this was changed when the book was printed for children to \\"ironpest\\"). Revealed in the final issue of the first volume to share a loving bond with Bruce Banner. Ascends to another plane of existence at the conclusion with Bruce. She also appears with a large mecha attachment to her suit which design is attributed to the RX-78GP03 Gundam Dendrobium from the anime Mobile Suit Gundam 0083: Stardust Memory. Bruce Banner - Currently reconstructing \\"the Energy Well\\" for Stark Industries. Gained the ability to summon gods after being exposed to gamma radiation when the well malfunctioned. Has a love for Toni Stark, which she returns. Ascends to another plane of existence at the conclusion alongside her. Wasp - Janet Van Dyne is an employee of Stark Industries and the creator of W.A.S.P. (Winged Amplification Surge Plasma) which allows her to fly. Differs from the original Wasp whose powers came from experimentation by Hank Pym, and also could change size via a serum. Hank Pym - A boy genius/rock star, called to Stark Island to help Banner construct \\"the Energy Well\\". Can control ants with his guitar like Ant-Man did with his helmet, but like the Wasp is unable to change size. Black Panther/Falcon - T'Challa came to Stark Island as a representative of the African nation of Wakanda, and uses mystic arts to become the half human/half panther hero. He can also change his totemic power and become this reality's Falcon. The Mangaverse version of Tigra found herself romantically attracted to him. In New Mangaverse: The Rings of Fate Panther is implied to have been killed by the villains in the story. Storm - Ororo Munroe was a member of a witch coven where she learned how to summon the elements of weather and now leads the X-Men. Villainous mutant Amanda Sefton was a friend of Ororo but tried to bring back the evil spirit Magnus. In X-Men: Ronin she is neither the group's leader nor a witch, but is once again a mutant and, as in the mainstream series, forms a very brief relationship with Forge, who dies at the hands of Jean Grey. In New Mangaverse: The Rings of Fate Storm and all other mutants except Wolverine are said to be neutralized, which implies that they, like most of the other Mangaverse heroes, were killed. Doctor Strange - The Mangaverse Doctor Strange is much younger than his mainstream counterpart, appearing to be roughly in his 20s. It is hinted at that he is trained as a medical doctor like the Earth-616 Stephen Strange. He is the Master of the Mystic Arts, has a rivalry with Baron Mordo, continually researches new spells, and watches over the world. His assistant is Tigra. He is vaporized in the first pages of issue one of New Mangaverse: The Rings of Fate. Tigra - Tigra works as Doctor Strange's assistant and \\"sidekick\\". In this incarnation, she was cursed into her were-tiger form, and must accomplish 1000 good deeds for the curse to be broken. She had romantic feelings towards the Mangaverse Black Panther in volumes one and two of Mangaverse. In New Mangaverse: The Rings of Fate she is encased in ice and dismembered. Up until this point, Tigra and Dr. Strange were the only two characters outside of the X-Men, the Scarlet Witch, and Spider-Man to have survived through the entirety of the Mangaverse series. The Incredible Hulk - not, as in other incarnations, an alternate form of Bruce Banner, the Mangaverse Hulk is merely summoned into existence by Banner. More than tall, and drawing heavily from Godzilla, this Hulk serves Dormammu. Daimon Hellstrom and Johnny Blaze‚ÄîThe Ghost Riders, Sons of Satan. Two brothers that become monster-hunters and battle their evil sister Satana. Omar Medina - Omar was a creation by Dr. Doom which primarily purpose was to assassinate and take the body of Doctor Strange back to the Alpha Labs where Dr. Doom could finally claim him. Volume 2 The second Mangaverse graphic novel continued storylines produced in the original series which was later collected as the first graphic novel. This series, at the start, brought back the Mangaverse version of the Fantastic Four, although slightly modified in appearance from the initial look they had in the mid-part of the first volume (though in the final issue they look as they do in volume 2). The story also introduced Mangaverse versions of Galactus (as a parasitic life form created by the Skrulls), The Watcher (who appears to be closest in characterization to his respective counterpart than any other Mangaverse character), a 13-year-old Captain Marvel, gigantic versions of four heralds of Galactus, and the Inhumans. An armored individual resembling Doctor Doom made a cameo in these first few issues, who then became the primary villain for the remainder of the series. Revealed to be the sister of Black Panther, this version of Doom decimates the Avengers, and it is only through the combined efforts of the Fantastic Four, Doctor Strange, Tigra, and the Scarlet Witch (the lone surviving member of the Mangaverse Avengers) that the heroes are able to defeat this version of Doom and restore some resemblance of order after the mayhem caused by Doom. Volume 2 is notable for borrowing plot elements and style from the anime Neon Genesis Evangelion. Spider-Man Mangaverse X-Men Mangaverse The X-Men first appeared in the first series of one-shots which were later compiled into volume one of Marvel Mangaverse. Wolverine, Cyclops, Storm, Mirage and Jean Grey form the core of this group. Rogue doesn't appear to be an actual member of the group, though she does live with them. In this version of the X-Men, it is Wolverine, not Xavier, who has put the team together. He has one set of metal claws, most likely adamantium, on his right hand, and another set on his left composed of energy. He has white hair and a strange tattoo on his face, possibly meant to be the Greek symbol Omega. In this story, Wolverine and Cyclops are brothers. Wolverine cost Cyclops one of his eyes, while it is hinted that Cyclops cost Wolverine one of his hands. (This seems to be why one of Wolverine's sets of claws is energy while the other is metal. Throughout this story with the exception of a pair of panels, Wolverine was depicted with two flesh and blood hands, the flesh and blood appearance of both hands continued in the final issue of the first arc of Mangaverse). He is also hinted to have had a relationship with Jean Grey, who had begun to favor Cyclops. Several other characters (both good and evil in the mainstream universe) appear in this story, most of whom are forces for evil, including The Beast, Amanda Sefton, Mystique and Nightcrawler. X-Men: Ronin This storyline centered around The X-Men and the Hellfire Club, who were battling on-and-off during the entirety of the story arc, due to the Hellfire Club's continued attempts to abduct Jean Grey and bring her into their group. During this storyline, Storm, who is not a witch in this storyline, but simply a mutant with power over the weather like the mainstream Marvel Universe, develops an attraction to Forge. The Phoenix Force, which was briefly glimpsed when Rogue tapped into it in the first volume of Mangaverse, has a much more important role here as Jean begins to either develop the Phoenix powers, or else is possessed by them. The X-Men's physical appearances are the same except Wolverine now has black hair, no tattoo on his face, and a mechanical right hand with energy claws (rather than the energy claws being on his left hand as in the first volume). Although not implicitly stated, it seems that the concept of Logan and Scott as brothers who each cost the other a part of his body connected to his offensive capabilities remains. Charles Xavier is depicted as the leader of the Hellfire Club, putting him into direct opposition to the X-Men. He has two daughters, Sage and Emma Frost. The Sentinels are Mecha, piloted by humans, (one of whom is Forge), who are killed in battle with both the X-Men and Hellfire Club, and are more or less obliterated by Jean Grey's newly developing Phoenix powers. The X-Men are advised by Toad, who is a very wise and Yoda-like person. As a former close friend Xavier, Toad is determined to destroy the Hellfire Club and bring Charles back to the X-Men. The Punisher Mangaverse In this self-contained storyline (written by Peter David and pencilled and inked by Lea Hernandez), The Punisher is a woman named Sosumi Brown who is the principal of an unnamed private school. In the story (set in Tokyo), the Punisher fights against the Korean Skang Kee crime family, led by Skang Kee Ho. The Skang Kee family uses an Oni (Japanese demon) named Oni Yew to try and stop her, but her sister (Hashi Brown) finds out about her secret, and in the process obtains a cursed weapon which she uses to slay the Oni and save her sister. (In the story, it is explained they are orphans due to the death of their parents in \\"a tragic pogo stick accident\\".) Unlike Frank Castle, Mangaverse Punisher does not use firearms, but martial art skills and a whip, which she uses to punish evildoers into submission. She also has a predisposition for bizarre forms of \\"punishment\\", including tickling a crime lord's feet with feathers, or spanking someone on the bottom. Because of this, she is referred to as \\"Tokyo's kinkiest superhero\\". Also, she uses a costume which makes her resemble a geisha, and wears facial makeup which gives the illusion of her face being a skull. Her base of operations is located within the school where she works; the entrance opens by moving a small skull inside her office. The Punisher of Marvel Mangaverse was part of the stories collected into volume 1 of the Marvel Mangaverse graphic novels, and has not been seen since the first run of stories. New Mangaverse: The Rings of Fate MJ as Spider-Woman (with Peter). Cover to New Mangaverse #1. Art by Tommy Ohtsuka. This image also appears on the cover of the novel sized New Mangaverse graphic novel which collects the entire miniseries. New Mangaverse: The Rings of Fate is the third sequel series to volumes one and two of Marvel Mangaverse, and starts some time after the events of Volume Two, Legend of the Spider-Clan and X-Men: Ronin. Direct references are made to both Legend of the Spider-Clan and Mangaverse Volume Two. The Hand make their first appearance in the Mangaverse. They are responsible for the deaths of roughly 99% of the superhuman population in the Mangaverse. They are also armed with the rings of Iron Man's long time nemesis The Mandarin. Elektra and Daredevil also make appearances; Elektra kills Daredevil and is herself cleaved in half by Carol Danvers in combat near the end of the series. Danvers then takes possession of a costume and shield which once belonged to Captain America, nearly identical to his costume from the mainstream universe (altered for a female body, making Danvers look similar to Shannon Carter, the MC2 heroine known as The American Dream). The shield, however, is identical entirely to the 616 version in appearance (though whether or not it is made of the same composition, is completely unknown). Tony Stark returns, and once again becomes Iron Man. Together, the remaining heroes; Spider-Man, Spider-Woman, Black Cat, Wolverine, Iron Man, the Human Torch, and the new Captain America form a new group of Avengers and battle and defeat the Hand, along with a mind controlled Sharon Carter. Several characters introduced in the previous volumes of the series were redesigned in appearance and/or personality for New Mangaverse. The Black Cat, who was introduced in Legend of the Spider-Clan, bears a striking facial resemblance to Rei Ayanami, a character from Evangelion in New Mangaverse. Spider-Man, briefly unmasked near the end of the series, bears a resemblance to Shinji Ikari. Wolverine is redesigned in New Mangaverse as well, becoming taller, wearing gear resembling the armor worn by Vegeta of Dragon Ball, with a more muscular build, a facial structure intended to be based on that of Vegeta, and a redesign of his bionic hand and energy claws. The Human Torch, whose personality, rather than looks, have been based on that of Asuka Soryu of Evangelion since volume one of the series, underwent a radical change. Her hairstyle and facial structure as well as physique are altered. Her hair is now done in pigtails, somewhat more closely resembling the hairstyle of Asuka, rather than a combination of straight hair with ringlets. Her half sister Sioux Storm, originally patterned after Rei Ayanami in physical appearance (despite her hair being blonde rather than blue) as well as personality, changed in personality between volumes 1 and 2 of the Mangaverse collections, and by the time of New Mangaverse was much more emotional and sported longer hair, no longer bearing any resemblance whatsoever to Rei, and was slain shortly after her appearance in the second issue of New Mangaverse. At the end of the series, the Black Cat is revealed to have been working alongside Nick Fury, who is implied to have orchestrated the decimation of the super-powered population. Whether or not she is truly loyal to Fury, if indeed this is actually Fury, who is himself believed to be dead, has yet to be revealed. New Mangaverse, though left open ended, appears to have been intended as the finale for the Marvel Mangaverse, as the near entirety of its superhuman population was decimated. It is therefore likely that the Black Cat's genuine loyalties will remain unknown due to New Mangaverse being the swan song for this particular universe. In the Hulk: Broken Worlds anthology there's a short story, telling one of mangaverse's Hulk adventures in Norse Cosmological Zone, which happens before the first volume. The Scarlet Witch did not appear in the New Mangaverse storyline (perhaps slain as were 99% of the world's other heroes). Tigra and Doctor Strange appeared in the first few pages of the New Mangaverse comic to be brutally murdered by the Hand ninja.

He owned the National Football League's Baltimore/Indianapolis Colts franchise from 1972 until his death in 1997, and the Los Angeles Rams briefly in 1972. Early life and education Irsay was born on March 5, 1923 in Chicago, the son of Charles Irsay (born Charles Israel) and Elaine Nyitrai, Jewish immigrants from Hungary. In 1942 he joined the United States Marine Corps. In 1946 he was hired by his father's heating and ventilation business. In 1951 Irsay founded his own business, the Robert Irsay Co., and sold the business to Zurn Industries about a year before purchasing the Colts in 1972. Career Irsay assumed ownership of the Baltimore Colts on July 13, 1972 after acquiring the Los Angeles Rams from the estate of Dan Reeves and swapping franchises with Carroll Rosenbloom, all made official on the same day.Beard, Gordon. \\"Heating Firm Owner Gets Baltimore Colts While Carroll Rosenbloom Secures Rams In A Big $16,000,000 Transcontinental Deal,\\" The Associated Press, Friday, July 14, 1972. His last- minute US $19 million bid for the Rams was $2 million more than that of future Tampa Bay Buccaneers owner Hugh Culverhouse.Crawford, Denis M. Hugh Culverhouse and the Tampa Bay Buccaneers: How a Skinflint Genius with a Losing Team Made the Modern NFL. Jefferson, NC: McFarland & Company, Inc., 2011. Irsay's majority share in the Colts was initially 51%, with Willard Keland of Racine, Wisconsin owning the rest. He additionally announced the appointment of Joe Thomas as Baltimore's new general manager, succeeding Don Klosterman who accompanied Rosenbloom to Los Angeles. =Move= In January 1984 Irsay appeared before the Baltimore media and exclaimed, \\"This is my team!\\" He reiterated that, despite problems, the rumors that he was moving the team were untrue. With negotiations over improvements to Memorial Stadium at an impasse, one of the chambers of the Maryland state legislature passed a law on March 27, 1984, allowing the city of Baltimore to seize the Colts under eminent domain, which city and county officials had threatened to do. Irsay claimed the city promised him a new football stadium, something they later denied, citing the team's poor attendance. The next day, fearing a dawn raid on the team's Owings Mills headquarters, Irsay accepted a deal offered by the city of Indianapolis. Indianapolis Mayor, William H. Hudnut III, contacted John Burnside Smith, then CEO of the Mayflower Transit Company, who arranged for fifteen trucks to pack the team's property hurriedly and transport it to Indianapolis in the early hours of the morning of March 29. An ecstatic crowd in Indianapolis greeted the arrival of its new NFL team, and the team received 143,000 season ticket requests in just two weeks. Baltimore was without a National Football League team until another controversial move in 1996, when Art Modell brought the personnel of the Cleveland Browns there to become the Baltimore Ravens. After Irsay's death in Indianapolis on January 14, 1997, the Colts were inherited by his son, Jim, who serves as CEO. Bill Polian handled the day-to-day operations of the team as vice-chairman until his dismissal after the 2011 season. Personal life In 1946, Irsay married Harriet Pogorzelski, the daughter of Polish Catholic immigrants. They raised their children Catholic. They had three children ‚Äì Thomas, Roberta and Jim. Roberta was killed in an automobile accident in 1971 on I-294 outside Chicago. Thomas, who lived with a severe mental disability, lived in a Florida facility until his death in 1999 at the age of 45. Jim is now the CEO and principal owner of the Colts. Irsay, who had divorced from Harriet, married Nancy Clifford on June 17, 1989, at Second Presbyterian Church in Indianapolis; Hudnut officiated the ceremony. Nancy Irsay died November 7, 2015 at the age of 65.http://www.wthr.com/story/30511964/nancy-irsay-widow-of-bob-irsay-dies- at-65 Irsay is one of the members of the Indianapolis Colts Ring of Honor, being inducted on September 23, 1996. Health decline Irsay suffered a stroke in November 1995 and was in intensive care at St. Vincent Indianapolis Hospital for several months. After his release he developed pneumonia, heart and kidney problems, for which he was transferred to the Mayo Clinic in Rochester, Minnesota. He died in Indianapolis on January 14, 1997. He is interred at Crown Hill Cemetery.

It forms after breaking down of polypeptides by gastric pepsin. In addition to proteoses, peptones are also formed at this stage. Peptones are different from proteoses in that proteoses are precipitated from solution by half saturation with ammonium sulfate, while peptones are not, even with fully saturated ammonium sulfate. The proenzyme Pepsinogen, with the exposure to hydrochloric acid gets converted into the active enzyme pepsin, the proteolytic enzyme of the stomach. Hydrochloric acid (HCl) provides the acidic pH (pH 1.8) optimal for pepsins. Rennin is a proteolytic enzyme found in gastric juice of infants which helps in the digestion of milk proteins.

Those that bind to 3) antigens from the body's own tissues are destroyed, while the rest mature into 4) inactive lymphocytes. Most of these never encounter a matching 5) foreign antigen, but those that do are activated and produce 6) many clones of themselves. Clonal selection theory is a scientific theory in immunology that explains the functions of cells of the immune system (lymphocytes) in response to specific antigens invading the body. The concept was introduced by Australian doctor Frank Macfarlane Burnet in 1957, in an attempt to explain the great diversity of antibodies formed during initiation of the immune response. The theory has become the widely accepted model for how the human immune system responds to infection and how certain types of B and T lymphocytes are selected for destruction of specific antigens. The theory states that in a pre-existing group of lymphocytes (specifically B cells), a specific antigen activates (i.e. selects) only its counter-specific cell, which then induces that particular cell to multiply, producing identical clones for antibody production. This activation occurs in secondary lymphoid organs such as the spleen and the lymph nodes. In short, the theory is an explanation of the mechanism for the generation of diversity of antibody specificity. The first experimental evidence came in 1958, when Gustav Nossal and Joshua Lederberg showed that one B cell always produces only one antibody. The idea turned out to be the foundation of molecular immunology, especially in adaptive immunity. Postulates The clonal selection theory can be summarised with the following four tenets: * Each lymphocyte bears a single type of receptor with a unique specificity (generated by V(D)J recombination). * Receptor occupation is required for cell activation. * The differentiated effector cells derived from an activated lymphocyte bear receptors of identical specificity as the parent cell. * Those lymphocytes bearing receptors for self molecules (i.e., endogenous antigens produced within the body) are destroyed at an early stage. Early work In 1900, Paul Ehrlich proposed the so-called \\"side chain theory\\" of antibody production. According to it, certain cells exhibit on their surface different \\"side chains\\" (i.e. membrane-bound antibodies) able to react with different antigens. When an antigen is present, it binds to a matching side chain. Then the cell stops producing all other side chains and starts intensive synthesis and secretion of the antigen-binding side chain as a soluble antibody. Though distinct from clonal selection, Ehrlich's idea was a selection theory far more accurate than the instructive theories that dominated immunology in the next decades. In 1955, Danish immunologist Niels Jerne put forward a hypothesis that there is already a vast array of soluble antibodies in the serum prior to any infection. The entrance of an antigen into the body results in the selection of only one type of antibody to match it. This supposedly occurred by certain cells phagocytosing the immune complexes and somehow replicating the antibody structure to produce more of it. In 1957, David W. Talmage hypothesized that antigens bind to antibodies on the surface of antibody-producing cells and \\"only those cells are selected for multiplication whose synthesized product has affinity for the antigen\\". The key difference from Ehrlich's theory was that every cell was presumed to synthesize only one sort of antibody. After antigen binding the cell proliferates, forming clones with identical antibodies. =Burnet's clonal selection theory= Later in 1957, Australian immunologist Frank Macfarlane Burnet published a paper titled \\"A modification of Jerne's theory of antibody production using the concept of clonal selection\\" in the rather obscure Australian Journal of Science. In it Burnet expanded the ideas of Talmage and named the resulting theory the \\"clonal selection theory\\". He further formalised the theory in his 1959 book The Clonal Selection Theory of Acquired Immunity. He explained immunological memory as the cloning of two types of lymphocyte. One clone acts immediately to combat infection whilst the other is longer lasting, remaining in the immune system for a long time and causing immunity to that antigen. According to Burnet's hypothesis, among antibodies are molecules that can probably correspond with varying degrees of precision to all, or virtually all, the antigenic determinants that occur in biological material other than those characteristic of the body itself. Each type of pattern is a specific product of a clone of lymphocytes and it is the essence of the hypothesis that each cell automatically has available on its surface representative reactive sites equivalent to those of the globulin they produce. When an antigen enters the blood or tissue fluids it is assumed that it will attach to the surface of any lymphocyte carrying reactive sites that correspond to one of its antigenic determinants. Then the cell is activated and undergoes proliferation to produce a variety of descendants. In this way, preferential proliferation is initiated of all those clones whose reactive sites correspond to the antigenic determinants on the antigens present in the body. The descendants are capable of active liberation of soluble antibody and lymphocytes, the same functions as the parental forms. In 1958, Gustav Nossal and Joshua Lederberg showed that one B cell always produces only one antibody, which was the first direct evidence supporting the clonal selection theory. Theories supported by clonal selection Burnet and Peter Medawar worked together on understanding immunological tolerance, a phenomenon also explained by clonal selection. This is the organism‚Äôs ability to tolerate the introduction of cells prior to the development of an immune response as long as it occurs early in the organism‚Äôs development. There are a vast number of lymphocytes occurring in the immune system, ranging from cells that tolerate self tissue to cells that do not. However, only cells tolerant of self tissue survive the embryonic stage. If non-self tissue is introduced, lymphocytes that develop are the ones that include the non-self tissues as self tissue. In 1959, Burnet proposed that under certain circumstances, tissues could be successfully transplanted into foreign recipients. This work has led to a much greater understanding of the immune system and also great advances in tissue transplantation. Burnet and Medawar shared the Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine in 1960. In 1974, Niels Kaj Jerne proposed that the immune system functions as a network that is regulated via interactions between the variable parts of lymphocytes and their secreted molecules. Immune network theory is firmly based on the concept of clonal selection. Jerne won the Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine in 1984, largely for his contributions to immune network theory.

The small, 100-foot ship had 102 passengers and a crew of about 30-40 in extremely cramped conditions. By the second month out, the ship was being buffeted by strong westerly gales, causing the ship's timbers to be badly shaken with caulking failing to keep out sea water, and with passengers, even in their berths, lying wet and ill. This, combined with a lack of proper rations and unsanitary conditions for several months, attributed to what would be fatal for many, especially the majority of women and children. On the way there were two deaths, a crew member and a passenger, but the worst was yet to come after arriving at their destination when, in the space of several months, almost half the passengers perished in cold, harsh, unfamiliar New England winter.Eugene Aubrey Stratton, Plymouth Colony: Its History and People, 1620-1691, (Salt Lake City: Ancestry Publishing, 1986), p. 413 On November 9/19, 1620, after about three months at sea, including a month of delays in England, they spotted land, which was the Cape Cod Hook, now called Provincetown Harbor.

It ranges from southwestern Minnesota and southeastern North Dakota to northern Texas east of the Rockies, and from northern Utah and Colorado to northern Chihuahua west of the Rockies. It has soft silky fur and grows to be long, although nearly half of that is the tail. They often live directly underneath Spanish bayonet or prickly pear plants. They are accustomed to sandy soil and eat mostly seeds, large and small grasses and small leaves of plants. Some food found in their cheek pouches are: seeds of needle grass (Stipa), bind weed, sandbur grass, a small bean (probably Astragalus), and sedge (Cyperus). Even those caught in grain fields usually have their pouches filled with weed seeds. Seeds of two species of pigeon grass, a few other grasses, and wild buckwheat have been found in their burrows. Their breeding season is mainly July to August and the females tend to have 4 embryos at a time. Other information about this animal is scarce.

It resulted largely from the Moroccan government's claim to portions of Algeria's Tindouf and B√©char provinces. The Sand War led to heightened tensions between the two countries for several decades. It was also notable for a short-lived Cuban and Egyptian military intervention on behalf of Algeria, and for ushering in the first multinational peacekeeping mission carried out by the Organisation of African Unity. Background The Maghreb in the second half of the 19th century Three factors contributed to the outbreak of this conflict: the absence of a precise delineation of the border between Algeria and Morocco, the discovery of important mineral resources in the disputed area, and the Moroccan irredentism fueled by the Greater Morocco ideology of the Istiqlal Party and Allal al- Fassi.Biography of Allal al-Fassi Before French colonization of the region in the nineteenth century, part of south and west Algeria were under Moroccan influence and no border was defined.Security Problems with Neighboring States ‚Äì Countrystudies.us In the Treaty of Lalla Maghnia (March 18, 1845), which set the border between French Algeria and Morocco, it is stipulated that \\"a territory without water is uninhabitable and its boundaries are superfluous\\"Article 6 du trait√©, cit√© par Zartman, page 163 and the border is delineated over only 165 km. Beyond that there is only one border area, without limit, punctuated by tribal territories attached to Morocco or Algeria. In the 1890s, the French administration and military called for the annexation of the Touat, the Gourara and the Tidikelt,Frank E.

Boston University African Studies Center: ¬´ The Algerian-Moroccan conflict can be said to have begun in 1890s when the administration and military in Algeria called for annexation of the Touat-Gourara-Tidikelt, a sizable expanse of Saharan oases that was nominally a part of the Moroccan Empire (...) The Touat-Gourara-Tidikelt oases had been an appendage of the Moroccan Empire, jutting southeast for about 750 kilometers into the Saharan desert ¬ª a complex that had been part of the Moroccan Empire for many centuries prior to the arrival of the French in Algeria.Frank E.

The discovery of large deposits of oil and minerals (iron, manganese) in the region led France to define more precisely the territories, and in 1952 the French decided to integrate Tindouf and Colomb-Bechar to the French departments of Algeria. In 1956 France relinquished its protectorate in Morocco, which immediately demanded the return of the disputed departments, especially Tindouf. The French government refused. During the Algerian War, Morocco backed the National Liberation Front, Algeria's leading nationalist movement, in its guerrilla campaign against the French. However, one of the FLN's primary objectives was to prevent France from splitting the strategic Sahara regions from a future Algerian state. It was therefore disinclined to support Morocco's historical claims to Tindouf and Bechar or the concept of a Greater Morocco. Upon Algerian independence, the FLN announced it would apply the principle of uti possidetis to pre-existing colonial borders. King Hassan II of Morocco visited Algiers in March 1963 to discuss the undefined borders, but Algeria's President Ahmed Ben Bella believed the matter should be resolved at a later date. Ben Bella's fledgling administration was still attempting to rebuild the country after the enormous damage caused by the Algerian War, and was already preoccupied with a Berber rebellion under Hocine A√Øt Ahmed in the Kabyle mountains. Algerian authorities suspected that Morocco was inciting the revolt, while Hassan was anxious about his own opposition's reverence for Algeria, escalating tensions between the nations. These factors prompted Hassan to begin moving troops towards Tindouf. War 1963 American news footage from the conflict Weeks of skirmishes along the border eventually escalated into a full-blown confrontation on September 25, 1963, with intense fighting around the oasis towns of Tindouf and Figuig. The Royal Moroccan Army soon crossed into Algeria in force and succeeded in taking the two border posts of Hassi-Beida and Tindjoub.Gleijeses, Piero (2002). Conflicting Missions: Havana, Washington, and Africa, 1959-1976. Chapel Hill, NC: University of North Carolina Press. p. 40. . The Algerian military, recently formed from the guerrilla ranks of the FLN's Arm√©e de Lib√©ration Nationale (ALN) was still oriented towards asymmetric warfare, and had little heavy weapons.How Cuba aided revolutionary Algeria in 1963 ‚Äì themilitant.com Its logistics was also complicated by its vast array of largely obsolete weapons from a number of diverse sources, including France, Germany, Czechoslovakia, and the United States. The Algerian army had ordered a large number of AMX-13 light tanks from France in 1962, but at the time of the fighting only twelve were in service. Ironically at least four AMX-13s had been also been donated by Morocco a year earlier. The Soviet Union supplied Algeria with ten T-34 tanks, but these were equipped for clearing minefields and were delivered without turrets or armament. The Algerian army also lacked trucks, aircraft, and jeeps.Gleijeses, Piero (2002). Conflicting Missions: Havana, Washington, and Africa, 1959-1976. Chapel Hill, NC: University of North Carolina Press. p. 41. . Morocco's armed forces were smaller, but comparatively well-equipped and frequently took advantage of their superior firepower on the battlefield.Armed Conflict Events Data ‚Äì Onwar.com They possessed forty T-54 main battle tanks that they had purchased from the Soviet Union, twelve SU-100 tank destroyers, seventeen AMX-13s, and a fleet of gun-armed Panhard EBR armored cars. Morocco also possessed modern strike aircraft, while Algeria did not. Despite internal discontent with the Algerian government, most of the country supported the war effort, which Algerians generally perceived as an act of Moroccan aggression. Even in regions where Ben Bella's regime remained deeply unpopular, such as Kabylie, the population offered to take up arms against the Moroccan invaders. Morocco's invasion proved to be a diplomatic blunder, as the other Arab and African states refused to recognize its border claims. Egypt even began sending troops and defense hardware in late October to bolster the Algerian military.Gleijeses, Piero (2002). Conflicting Missions: Havana, Washington, and Africa, 1959-1976. Chapel Hill, NC: University of North Carolina Press. p. 47. . Morocco's Western allies, namely the United States, did not provide assistance, despite Morocco's formal requests to the Kennedy Administration for military aid. The United States feared the escalation and internationalization of the war, particularly wanting to avoid Soviet intervention, and therefore advocated for the peaceful resolution of the conflict. On October 5, representatives from Morocco and Algeria convened at Oujda to negotiate, but they were unable to deliver a solution. The Moroccans were determined to adjust the border, which the Algerians would not allow, resulting in an impasse. The Algerian forces began to retaliate against the Moroccan advances, taking back the ports of Hassi-Beida and Tindjoub on October 8.Torres-Garc√≠a, Ana (2013). \\"US diplomacy and the North African 'War of the Sands' (1963)\\". The Journal of North African Studies. 18 (2): 328. This prompted further attempts at negotiations, but these proved ineffectual as well. On October 13, 1963, Moroccan ground units launched a major offensive on Tindouf. It stalled due to unexpectedly stubborn resistance from the town's Algerian and Egyptian garrison. The Algerians attacked the town of Ich on October 18, enlarging the war to the North.Torres-Garc√≠a, Ana (2013). \\"US diplomacy and the North African 'War of the Sands' (1963)\\". The Journal of North African Studies. 18 (2): 329. On October 22, hundreds of Cuban troops arrived at Oran.Gleijeses, Piero (2002). Conflicting Missions: Havana, Washington, and Africa, 1959-1976. Chapel Hill, NC: University of North Carolina Press. p. 45. . The troops were sent at the request of Ben Bella, though he would later deny this in 1997.Gleijeses, Piero (2002). Conflicting Missions: Havana, Washington, and Africa, 1959-1976. Chapel Hill, NC: University of North Carolina Press. p. 41; 46. . Just years after the victory of their own revolution, many Cubans identified with the Algerians and were eager to support them. They also suspected that Washington was hoping the war would precipitate Ben Bella's downfall, which Castro was determined to prevent. For these reasons, the Cuban Government formed the Grupo Especial de Instrucci√≥n to be sent to Algeria.Gleijeses, Piero (2002). Conflicting Missions: Havana, Washington, and Africa, 1959-1976. Chapel Hill, NC: University of North Carolina Press. p. 42. . Its forces included twenty-two T-34 tanks, eighteen 120-mm mortars, a battery of 57-mm recoilless rifles, anti-aircraft artillery with eighteen guns, and eighteen 122mm field guns with the crews to operate them.Gleijeses, Piero (2002). Conflicting Missions: Havana, Washington, and Africa, 1959-1976. Chapel Hill, NC: University of North Carolina Press. p. 44. . The unit was made up of 686 men under the command of Efigenio Ameijeiras. Although they were initially described as an advisory contingent to train the Algerian army, Fidel Castro also authorized their deployment in combat actions to safeguard Algeria's territorial integrity. The Cubans offloaded their equipment and transported it to the southwestern front by rail. The troops provided training to the Algerians, and their medical team offered the population free healthcare.Gleijeses, Piero (2002). Conflicting Missions: Havana, Washington, and Africa, 1959-1976. Chapel Hill, NC: University of North Carolina Press. p. 48. . While Castro had hoped to keep Cuba's intervention covert, and a number of the Cuban personnel wore Algerian uniforms, they were observed by French military and diplomatic staff in Oran and word of their presence soon leaked to the Western press. Algeria and Cuba planned a major counteroffensive, Operation Dignidad, aimed at driving the Moroccan forces back across the border and capturing Berguent. However, Ben Bella suspended the attack in order to proceed with negotiations to end the war peacefully. Moroccan forces had planned a second offensive on Tindouf and occupied positions about four kilometres from the settlement. However, Hassan was reluctant to authorise it, fearing that another battle would prompt further military intervention from Algeria's allies. Multiple actors, including the Arab League, Tunisia's Habib Bourguiba, Libya's King Idris, and Ethiopia's Emperor Haile Selassie, sought to moderate negotiations.Torres-Garc√≠a, Ana (2013). \\"US diplomacy and the North African 'War of the Sands' (1963)\\". The Journal of North African Studies. 18 (2): 335. The United Nations received many pleas to issue a ceasefire appeal, but Secretary-General U Thant wanted to allow regional initiatives to pursue a solution. On October 29, Hassan and Ben Bella met to negotiate in Bamako, Mali, joined by Emperor Selassie and Mali's President Modibo Ke√Øta.Torres- Garc√≠a, Ana (2013). \\"US diplomacy and the North African 'War of the Sands' (1963)\\". The Journal of North African Studies. 18 (2): 339. After the four leaders met alone on October 30, a truce was declared. The accord mandated a ceasefire for November 2, and announced that a commission consisting of Moroccan, Algerian, Ethiopian, and Malian officers would decide the boundaries of a demilitarized zone. It was also determined that an Ethiopian and Malian team would observe the neutrality of the demilitarized zone. Finally, the accord suggested an immediate gathering of the Foreign Ministers of the Organisation of African Unity (OAU). The meeting would be held to set up a commission to determine who was responsible for starting the war and to examine the frontier question and suggest methods for bringing about a lasting settlement of the conflict. The ceasefire was almost jeopardized on November 1, when Algerian troops assaulted a village near Figuig and positioned themselves against the town's airport.Torres-Garc√≠a, Ana (2013). \\"US diplomacy and the North African 'War of the Sands' (1963)\\". The Journal of North African Studies. 18 (2): 340. The attack was denounced and dramatized by the Moroccan Government. However, a Malian officer arrived on November 4 and enforced the Bamako Accord, ending the hostilities. The OAU mediated a formal peace treaty on February 20, 1964.The 1963 border war and the 1972 treaty ‚Äì Arabworld.nitle.org The treaty was signed in Mali following a number of preliminary discussions between Hassan and Ben Bella. Terms of this agreement included a reaffirmation of the previously established borders in Algeria's favor and restoration of the status quo. The demilitarized zone was maintained in the meantime, monitored by the OAU's first multinational peacekeeping force.  Casualties  French sources reported Algerian casualties to be 60 dead and 250 wounded, with later works giving a number of 300 Algerian dead. Morocco officially reported to have suffered 39 dead. Moroccan losses were probably lower than the Algerians' but are unconfirmed, with later sources reporting 200 Moroccan dead. About 57 Moroccans and 379 Algerians were taken prisoner. Aftermath The Sand War laid the foundations for a lasting and often intensely hostile rivalry between Morocco and Algeria, exacerbated by the differences in political outlook between the conservative Moroccan monarchy and the revolutionary, Arab nationalist Algerian military government.Algiers and Rabat, still miles apart ‚Äì Le Monde Diplomatique In January 1969, Algerian President Houari Boumediene made a state visit to Morocco and signed a treaty of friendship with Hassan's government at Ifrane. The following year the two leaders set up a commission to demarcate the border and examine prospects for joint efforts to mine iron ore in the disputed region. Morocco finally abandoned all claims to Algerian territory in 1972 with the Accord of Ifrane, though Morocco refused to ratify the agreement until 1989. The governments of both Morocco and Algeria used the war to describe opposition movements as unpatriotic. The Moroccan UNFP and the Algerian-Berber FFS of A√Øt Ahmed both suffered as a result of this. In the case of UNFP, its leader, Mehdi Ben Barka, sided with Algeria, and was sentenced to death in absentia as a result. In Algeria, the armed rebellion of the FFS in Kabylie fizzled out, as commanders defected to join the national forces against Morocco. The rivalry between Morocco and Algeria exemplified in the Sand War also influenced Algeria's policy regarding the conflict in Western Sahara, with Algeria backing an independence-minded Sahrawi guerrilla organization, the Polisario Front, partly to curb Moroccan expansionism in the wake of the attempt to annex Tindouf.

This position is also referred to as webbing. It is commonly associated with especially exuberant types of performance such as musicals, cheerleading, show choir, revue, and especially jazz dance shows. In cheerleading, the position with arms outstretched and fingers wiggling up and down is sometimes referred to as spirit fingers or jazz fingers. Depending on the performance venue, both gestures can be associated with campiness.Zimmerman, Karla and Nate Cavalieri (2008). Chicago. Lonely Planet. p. 35. Probably the biggest proponent of jazz hands was Bob Fosse, who incorporated them in nearly all of his Broadway and film musical choreography. The best example of this is the opening musical number of Pippin, \\"Magic to Do\\", in which still illuminated jazz hands are the first thing the audience sees.

It is located in Alameda, California, United States, and is part of the Alameda Unified School District.  History  The suggestion to open a \\"Preparatory Department of a High School\\" was first presented at an Alameda Board of Education meeting held on March 6, 1874. On April 17, 1874, C. Y. Johns was elected as the first principal. Classes began with 52 students, in July 1874, in a rented room over a drugstore on Park Street known as \\"Boehmer's Hall\\". The building still exists today as the China House restaurant. Boehmer's Hall was only temporary. A new building was already being built on a site on Santa Clara at Chestnut, and was completed and occupied in 1875. The high school shared space with the Grammar Department in what became known as Haight School. The site is still occupied by this school today. The class of 1878, totalling nine students, was the first to graduate from Alameda High School. It wasn't long before the number of students enrolled in the high school outgrew the space available at Haight. Temporary quarters were located at the Porter school, located on Alameda Avenue, by 1900. A campaign was started for a new separate high school building. With the help of the high school student body, a bond was passed in the city for the new school. The cornerstone was laid in 1902 on the new site at Central and Walnut. The building was dedicated in 1903 and occupied in time for the December 1903 term. Continued growth in enrollment required an even larger campus. In 1925 a new bond issue was voted on. The new school, dedicated in 1926, comprised three connected buildings, including the original 1903 structure which was refurbished to blend with the architectural style of the other two. The architecture, designed by local architect Carl Werner, is early twentieth-century Neo-Classical Revival in nature, evoking images of ancient Greek temples with Ionic columns in front of the Kofman Auditorium, a facility known throughout the Bay Area as one of the best of the local playhouses. By 1955, the \\"old building\\" had outlived its usefulness and was replaced with what became known as the \\"new building\\" by subsequent students until 1977. Campaigns to replace old public buildings with newer earthquake-safe structures led to the construction of the newest high school building, across the street from the established campus, on Encinal at Walnut. Original plans involved tearing down the 1926 buildings and replacing them with a sports complex, and only keeping the \\"new building\\" of 1955. A dedicated group of alumni and citizens saved the venerable buildings, and the planned new construction was scaled back to what exists today. The newest building was first occupied in 1978 and included the site of the former Porter school. The west wing now houses Language and Fine Arts, as well as the Frederick L. Chacon Little Theater. The school was made an Alameda Historical Monument in 1976 and was listed in the National Register of Historic Places in 1977.  Enrollment and academics  Alameda High School is an ethnically diverse school and has a composition that is 41% Asian, 30% White, 13% Hispanic, 6% Black, and 4% two or more races. The school has received National Blue Ribbon recognition and California Distinguished School and Digital High School awards. It is accredited by the Western Association of Schools and Colleges, offering more than a dozen Advanced Placement courses. The school also has a very strong journalism course which produces the monthly student newspaper publication The Oak Leaf.

Johnson, The Joseph Smith Papers (accessed January 10, 2012) Early life Born to Ezekiel Johnson and Julia Hills at Pomfret, New York, he moved to Kirtland, Ohio in 1833. He married Melissa Bloomfield LeBaron on Christmas Day, December 25, 1841. Latter Day Saint Movement Benjamin was baptized into the Church of the Latter Day Saints at Kirtland by Lyman E. Johnson in the spring of 1835. Heber C. Kimball ordained him an elder March 10, 1839 at Far West, Missouri and John Smith ordained him a high priest in 1843 at Ramus, Illinois. He served as a missionary for his new faith to the eastern United States and Upper Canada between 1840 and 1842. He was appointed to Joseph Smith's Council of Fifty in 1843. In 1838 he moved to Adam-ondi-Ahman, Missouri where he was arrested and kept under guard for eight days in intensely cold weather before an open campfire. While he was sitting on a log, a \\"brute\\" came up to him with a rifle in his hands and said, \\"You give up Mormonism right now, or I'll shoot you.\\" Benjamin decisively refused, upon which the ruffian took deliberate aim at him and pulled the trigger. The gun failed to discharge. Cursing fearfully, the man declared that he had \\"used the gun 20 years and it had never before missed fire.\\" Examining the lock, he reprimed the weapon and again aimed and pulled the trigger‚Äîwithout effect. Following the same procedure he tried a third time, but the result was the same. A bystander told him to \\"fix up his gun a little\\" and then \\"you can kill the cuss all right.\\" So for a fourth and final time the would-be murderer prepared, even putting in a fresh load.

Some scientists prefer the terms chronometric or calendar dating, as use of the word \\"absolute\\" implies an unwarranted certainty of accuracy. Absolute dating provides a numerical age or range in contrast with relative dating which places events in order without any measure of the age between events. In archaeology, absolute dating is usually based on the physical, chemical, and life properties of the materials of artifacts, buildings, or other items that have been modified by humans and by historical associations with materials with known dates (coins and written history). Techniques include tree rings in timbers, radiocarbon dating of wood or bones, and trapped-charge dating methods such as thermoluminescence dating of glazed ceramics. Coins found in excavations may have their production date written on them, or there may be written records describing the coin and when it was used, allowing the site to be associated with a particular calendar year. In historical geology, the primary methods of absolute dating involve using the radioactive decay of elements trapped in rocks or minerals, including isotope systems from very young (radiocarbon dating with ) to systems such as uranium‚Äìlead dating that allow acquisition of absolute ages for some of the oldest rocks on Earth. Radiometric techniques Radiometric dating is based on the known and constant rate of decay of radioactive isotopes into their radiogenic daughter isotopes. Particular isotopes are suitable for different applications due to the types of atoms present in the mineral or other material and its approximate age. For example, techniques based on isotopes with half lives in the thousands of years, such as carbon-14, cannot be used to date materials that have ages on the order of billions of years, as the detectable amounts of the radioactive atoms and their decayed daughter isotopes will be too small to measure within the uncertainty of the instruments. =Radiocarbon dating= One of the most widely used and well- known absolute dating techniques is carbon-14 (or radiocarbon) dating, which is used to date organic remains. This is a radiometric technique since it is based on radioactive decay. Cosmic radiation entering the earth‚Äôs atmosphere produces carbon-14, and plants take in carbon-14 as they fix carbon dioxide. Carbon-14 moves up the food chain as animals eat plants and as predators eat other animals. With death, the uptake of carbon-14 stops. It takes 5,730 years for half the carbon-14 to change to nitrogen; this is the half-life of carbon-14. After another 5,730 years only one-quarter of the original carbon-14 will remain. After yet another 5,730 years only one-eighth will be left. By measuring the carbon-14 in organic material, scientists can determine the date of death of the organic matter in an artifact or ecofact. Limitations The relatively short half-life of carbon-14, 5,730 years, makes dating reliable only up to about 60,000 years. The technique often cannot pinpoint the date of an archeological site better than historic records, but is highly effective for precise dates when calibrated with other dating techniques such as tree-ring dating. An additional problem with carbon-14 dates from archeological sites is known as the \\"old wood\\" problem. It is possible, particularly in dry, desert climates, for organic materials such as from dead trees to remain in their natural state for hundreds of years before people use them as firewood or building materials, after which they become part of the archaeological record. Thus dating that particular tree does not necessarily indicate when the fire burned or the structure was built. For this reason, many archaeologists prefer to use samples from short-lived plants for radiocarbon dating. The development of accelerator mass spectrometry (AMS) dating, which allows a date to be obtained from a very small sample, has been very useful in this regard. =Potassium-argon dating= Other radiometric dating techniques are available for earlier periods. One of the most widely used is potassium‚Äìargon dating (K‚ÄìAr dating). Potassium-40 is a radioactive isotope of potassium that decays into argon-40. The half-life of potassium-40 is 1.3 billion years, far longer than that of carbon-14, allowing much older samples to be dated. Potassium is common in rocks and minerals, allowing many samples of geochronological or archeological interest to be dated. Argon, a noble gas, is not commonly incorporated into such samples except when produced in situ through radioactive decay. The date measured reveals the last time that the object was heated past the closure temperature at which the trapped argon can escape the lattice. K‚ÄìAr dating was used to calibrate the geomagnetic polarity time scale. Luminescence dating =Thermoluminescence= Thermoluminescence testing also dates items to the last time they were heated. This technique is based on the principle that all objects absorb radiation from the environment. This process frees electrons within minerals that remain caught within the item. Heating an item to 500 degrees Celsius or higher releases the trapped electrons, producing light. This light can be measured to determine the last time the item was heated. Radiation levels do not remain constant over time. Fluctuating levels can skew results ‚Äì for example, if an item went through several high radiation eras, thermoluminescence will return an older date for the item. Many factors can spoil the sample before testing as well, exposing the sample to heat or direct light may cause some of the electrons to dissipate, causing the item to date younger. Because of these and other factors, Thermoluminescence is at the most about 15% accurate. It cannot be used to accurately date a site on its own. However, it can be used to confirm the antiquity of an item. =Optically stimulated luminescence (OSL)= Optically stimulated luminescence (OSL) dating constrains the time at which sediment was last exposed to light. During sediment transport, exposure to sunlight 'zeros' the luminescence signal. Upon burial, the sediment accumulates a luminescence signal as natural ambient radiation gradually ionises the mineral grains. Careful sampling under dark conditions allows the sediment to be exposed to artificial light in the laboratory which releases the OSL signal. The amount of luminescence released is used to calculate the equivalent dose (De) that the sediment has acquired since deposition, which can be used in combination with the dose rate (Dr) to calculate the age. Dendrochronology The growth rings of a tree at Bristol Zoo, England. Each ring represents one year; the outside rings, near the bark, are the youngest. Dendrochronology or tree-ring dating is the scientific method of dating based on the analysis of patterns of tree rings, also known as growth rings. Dendrochronology can date the time at which tree rings were formed, in many types of wood, to the exact calendar year. Dendrochronology has three main areas of application: paleoecology, where it is used to determine certain aspects of past ecologies (most prominently climate); archaeology, where it is used to date old buildings, etc.; and radiocarbon dating, where it is used to calibrate radiocarbon ages (see below). In some areas of the world, it is possible to date wood back a few thousand years, or even many thousands. Currently, the maximum for fully anchored chronologies is a little over 11,000 years from present. Amino acid dating Amino acid dating is a dating technique 2008 quote: The results provide a compelling case for applicability of amino acid racemization methods as a tool for evaluating changes in depositional dynamics, sedimentation rates, time-averaging, temporal resolution of the fossil record, and taphonomic overprints across sequence stratigraphic cycles. used to estimate the age of a specimen in paleobiology, archaeology, forensic science, taphonomy, sedimentary geology and other fields. This technique relates changes in amino acid molecules to the time elapsed since they were formed. All biological tissues contain amino acids. All amino acids except glycine (the simplest one) are optically active, having an asymmetric carbon atom. This means that the amino acid can have two different configurations, \\"D\\" or \\"L\\" which are mirror images of each other. With a few important exceptions, living organisms keep all their amino acids in the \\"L\\" configuration. When an organism dies, control over the configuration of the amino acids ceases, and the ratio of D to L moves from a value near 0 towards an equilibrium value near 1, a process called racemization. Thus, measuring the ratio of D to L in a sample enables one to estimate how long ago the specimen died.

It is a member of the Cree‚ÄìMontagnais‚ÄìNaskapi dialect continuum and is spoken in various dialects depending on the community.  Literature  Natashquan, Quebec. Since the 1980s, Innu-aimun has had considerable exposure in the popular culture of Canada and France due to the success of the rock music band Kashtin and the later solo careers of its founders Claude McKenzie and Florent Vollant. Widely heard hit songs with Innu-language lyrics have included \\"\\" (\\"Girl\\"), \\"\\" (\\"My Childhood\\"), \\"\\" (\\"Story\\") and in particular \\"\\" (\\"Take care of yourself\\"), which appeared on soundtrack compilations for the television series Due South and the documentary Music for The Native Americans. The lyrics of Akua Tuta are featured on over 50 websites, making this one of the most broadly accessible pieces of text written in any native North American language.

Grammar  Innu-aimun is a polysynthetic, head-marking language with relatively free word order. Its three basic parts of speech are nouns, verbs, and particles. Nouns are grouped into two genders, animate and inanimate, and may carry affixes indicating plurality, possession, obviation, and location. Verbs are divided into four classes based on their transitivity: animate intransitive (AI), inanimate intransitive (II), transitive inanimate (TI), and transitive animate (TA). Verbs may carry affixes indicating agreement (with both subject and object arguments), tense, mood, and inversion. Two different sets, or orders, of verbal affixes are used depending on the verb's syntactic context. In simple main clauses, the verb is marked using affixes of the independent order, whereas in subordinate clauses and content-word questions, affixes of the conjunct order are used.  Dialects  Innu-aimun is related to East Cree (ƒ™yiy≈´ Ayim≈´n - Northern/Coastal dialect and ƒ™n≈´ Ayim≈´n - Southern/Inland dialect) spoken by the James Bay Cree of the James Bay region of Quebec and Ontario and the Atikamekw (Nƒìhinawƒìwin and Nehir√¢mowin) of the Atikamekw (‚ÄòNehiraw‚Äô, ‚ÄòNehirowisiw‚Äô) in the upper Saint- Maurice River valley of Quebec. Innu-aimun is divided into four dialects - Southern Montagnais (Mashteuiatsh and Betsiamites), Eastern Montagnais (Mingan, Natashquan, La Romaine, Pakuashipi), Central Montagnais (Sept-√éles and Maliotenam, Matimekosh) and Labrador -Montagnais (Sheshatshit).Sometimes the dialects are also grouped as follows: Nehilawewin (Western Montagnais, Piyekw√¢kam√Æ dialect), Leluwewn (Western Montagnais, Betsiamites dialect), Innu-Aim√ªn (Eastern Montagnais) The speakers of the different dialects can communicate well with each other. The Naskapi language and culture are quite different from those of the Montagnais, in which the dialect changes from y to n as in \\"Iiyuu\\" versus \\"Innu\\". References * Clarke, Sandra. 1982.

Based in part on Spike Lee's experiences as a Morehouse student in the Atlanta University Center during the 1970s, it is a story about undergraduates in a fraternity and sorority clashing with some of their classmates at a historically black college during homecoming weekend. It also touches upon issues of colorism, elitism, classism, political activism, hazing, groupthink, female self-esteem, social mobility, and hair texture bias within the African-American community.https://www.ajc.com/entertainment/movies/spike-lee-appear-30th- anniversary-school-daze-screening-fox/eBmZTzjfJhRbPWxp2hNS2H/ The second feature film by Spike Lee, School Daze was released on February 12, 1988 by Columbia Pictures. Plot Vaughn ‚ÄúDap‚Äù Dunlap is a politically and socially conscious black student at Mission College, a leading historically black college in Atlanta. On homecoming weekend, Dap leads an anti-apartheid demonstration, demanding that the school divest from South Africa, and feuds with Julian ‚ÄúDean Big Brother Almighty‚Äù Eaves, the head of Gamma Phi Gamma fraternity. Dap‚Äôs younger cousin Darrell ‚ÄúHalf-Pint‚Äù, a Gamma pledge, is ordered by Julian to bring a girl to the fraternity that night, and goes to Dap for advice. Cedar Cloud, chairman of Mission‚Äôs board of trustees, warns college president Harold McPherson that the divestment protests may scare off the school‚Äôs wealthy donors. The Gamma Rays, the Gamma women‚Äôs auxiliary led by Julian‚Äôs girlfriend Jane Toussaint ‚Äì mostly light-skinned black women with straightened hair ‚Äì clash with some of their non-Greek classmates, including Dap‚Äôs girlfriend Rachel Meadows ‚Äì mostly dark-skinned black women with natural hair ‚Äì over skin color and hair politics. Unsuccessful in courting any female students, Darrell and the pledges are hazed. Dap and Rachel have a falling out when she plans to rush a sorority, and she accuses him of colorism. The weekend‚Äôs festivities begin, and the Gamma brothers nearly come to blows with Dap and his fellow protestors at the homecoming parade. After the Mission football team suffers an embarrassing loss, Cloud and McPherson threaten Dap with expulsion if he continues his activism. Dap and his friends drive into town to eat at KFC, where they are harassed by locals who resent them as privileged college boys. Returning to campus, Dap confronts Julian about Darrell‚Äôs pledge status. At the Greeks‚Äô step show, a performance by Dap and his friends leads to a brawl with the Gammas. Seeking out Rachel, Dap is humiliated by her dorm neighbors, but he and Rachel reconcile. Darrell and the Gamma pledges endure a grueling initiation and are welcomed as new members. At the school dance, Dap‚Äôs roommate Grady hits it off with a female student and coaxes her to his room, but she refuses to stay when Dap and Rachel are already there. As the Gammas celebrate, Julian forces Jane to have sex with Darrell, but rejects her afterward. Darrell excitedly informs Dap, who is infuriated.

The actors playing the \\"wannabees\\" were given better accommodations than the ones playing the \\"jigaboos.\\" This favoritism contributed to tension on the set, which showed in the on-camera animosity between the two camps. (The producers used a similar tactic in filming Animal House, with similar results.) In School Daze, the method approach yielded strong results ‚Äî the fight that occurs at the step show between Dap's crew and the Gammas was not in the script. On the day the scene was shot, the fight broke out between the two sides. Lee ordered the cameras to keep rolling. Officials of Morehouse, Spelman, and Clark Atlanta University asked Lee to stop filming on the campuses before he completed his work because the colleges' Boards of Directors had concerns on how he was portraying the historically black colleges in the film. Lee had to finish filming at the neighboring Morris Brown College. Ruth E. Carter designed the costumes for the film, inspired by uniforms and styles worn at the HBCUs. At Lee's encouragement, she commissioned American fashion designer Willi Smith to design the gowns for the Homecoming Court in the film. Reception The film received mixed reviews for its exploration of issues within the black community. Roger Ebert of the Chicago Sun-Times noted, \\"There is no doubt in my mind that 'School Daze,' in its own way, is one of the most honest and revealing movies I've ever seen about modern middle-class black life in America.\\" He also noted its frank exploration of issues of discrimination within the black community related to skin tone and nature of hair. He said it was significant as a film with a \\"completely black orientation. All of the characters, good and bad, are black, and all of the character's references are to each other.\\" On review aggregator website Rotten Tomatoes, the film holds an approval rating of 56%, based on 27 reviews, and an average rating of 5.67/10. =Legacy= Kadeem Hardison, Darryl M.

He began as an adherent of Jasper Tudor and King Henry VI of England, and was appointed to several offices by Henry. He was nonetheless a Yorkist by inclination, as were many Welshmen of the time. After the Yorkist victory in 1461 he became a loyal and important servant of King Edward IV. In 1483, he was executed by Richard III as part of his seizure of the throne. Life Vaughan was the son of Robert and Margaret Vaughan of Monmouth. In 1446 he was appointed to the offices of Steward, Receiver, and Master of the Game in Herefordshire and Ewyas, and Steward, Constable, Porter, and Receiver of Abergavenny. In 1450, he became Master of the Ordnance. He entered Parliament in 1455 as MP for Marlborough. Despite his early association with Jasper Tudor, Earl of Pembroke, Vaughan was accused of plotting against King Henry VI of England as early as 1459. Somehow he regained the king's favour, and in 1460 was appointed Keeper of Henry VI's \\"great Wardrobe\\". After Henry's defeat at Saint Albans in 1461, Vaughan, along with Philip Malpas and William Hatclyf, sailed for Ireland with Henry's treasury, but were captured by French pirates. Edward IV, surprisingly, ransomed Vaughan from the pirates, for which Vaughan was forever afterwards loyal. Edward soon came to trust Vaughan and placed him in high offices. Vaughan was appointed Sheriff of Surrey and Sussex for 1464. In 1465 Edward made him Treasurer of the King's Chamber and Master of the King's Jewels. Edward also sent Vaughan as ambassador to the courts of Burgundy and France. He helped negotiate the marriage of Edward's sister, Margaret to the Duke of Burgundy in 1468. In 1475, on the same day that Edward's eldest son, the future Edward V, was invested as Prince of Wales, Vaughan was knighted, having acted for some years as Chamberlain to the young prince. In 1478, he was elected to parliament as knight of the shire for Cornwall. After Edward IV died in 1483, Vaughan was accompanying Edward V from Ludlow to London when the party was intercepted by the future King Richard III, then Duke of Gloucester. Richard had Vaughan arrested and executed along with Anthony Woodville, 2nd Earl Rivers and tutor for Edward V. Also arrested was Edward V's half brother Sir Richard Grey the son of Sir John Grey of Groby and the first husband of Elizabeth Woodville. All three were beheaded at Pontefract Castle on 25 June 1483, in West Yorkshire. Vaughan was the second husband of Eleanor Arundel, widow of Sir Thomas Browne, who had likewise been executed in 1460. In Shakespeare's Richard III, Vaughan's ghost appears to the King on the eve of the Battle of Bosworth.Vaughan, Sir Thomas (d.1483), Welsh Biography Online.

Early life Born in Marion, Indiana, Oatis began his journalism career with his high school newspaper, studied at DePauw University for one year and in 1933 returned to Marion, where he worked for the Leader- Tribune.Rayner Pike, \\"AP Reporter William Oatis Dies,\\" Associated Press obituary, September 16, 1997. In 1937, he started working for the Associated Press in Indianapolis, Indiana. Oatis served in the U.S. Army during World War II, studying Japanese at the University of Minnesota in Minneapolis. In 1950, he married Laurabelle Zack, who worked in the AP's reference library in New York.Laurabelle Oatis. Larry T. Nix, Library History Buff Blog, February 1, 2009. (Accessed July 28, 2011.)

Arrest and detention Oatis was working as the AP bureau chief in Prague, Czechoslovakia, when he was arrested on April 23, 1951. Deprived of sleep and subjected to continuous interrogation for 42 hours, Oatis signed a statement confessing to the charge of espionage.William N. Oatis, \\"Why I Confessed,\\" Life, September 21, 1953, p. 131; p. 141. The case made international headlines, as well as leading to trade and travel embargos against Czechoslovakia.A petition for a \\"United Nations Writ of Habeas Corpus\\" was even filed with the United Nations Commission on Human Rights on behalf of Oatis by attorney Luis Kutner. Luis Kutner, World Habeas Corpus, Dobbs Ferry, NY: Oceana, 1962, p. 244. During his trial, he confessed to espionage on behalf of the United States, and somewhat more implausibly, on behalf of India, saying he collected intelligence on Czechoslovakia for the Indian charge d'affairs in Prague, Ramchundur Goburdhun. Those attending the trial noted when delivering his confession that Oatis spoke in a flat, emotionless voice. On July 4, 1951, a Czechoslovak court sentenced Oatis to ten years in prison.\\"Czechs Give Oatis 10 Years, Half Off for Good Behavior,\\" New York Times, July 5, 1951, page 1. He was released May 16, 1953, shortly after the death of Joseph Stalin and after an angry letter from President Dwight D. Eisenhower to the Czechoslovak government.\\"The Press: A Letter from Ike,\\" Time, June 1, 1953. The Czechoslovak government said it had been moved to pardon Oatis by a poignant plea from Oatis' wife, Laurabelle. Oatis contracted tuberculosis during his imprisonment and sought treatment shortly after his release.\\"Oatis to be Treated in Sanitarium for TB,\\" New York Times, May 27, 1953. After his release, Oatis retracted his confession, and maintained that he merely cross-checked information with foreign diplomats such as his friend Goburdhun before writing a story. A Czechoslovak court cleared him of all charges in 1959, but the decision was reversed in 1968 after the Warsaw Pact invasion of Czechoslovakia. In 1990, after Czechoslovakia's \\"Velvet Revolution\\" the previous year, he was cleared again.Pace, Eric (September 17, 1997). \\"William N.

The hill was built by the order of Oliver Cromwell where soldiers used their helmets to carry dirt to build the hill in celebration of the victory of the battle of Worcester. The context of this ancient monument was devastated by the building of the M5 motorway a very short distance away, further damage being caused by the widening of the A44, which was rebuilt to bypass the village. It was then damaged again by the building on the north side of the Tump of the road going west to the new crossing of the River Severn south of Worcester.

In the 1986 musical The Phantom of the Opera by Andrew Lloyd Webber, the concept is expanded as an opera within a musical and the performance of it plays a major role in the storyline. The fictional piece draws major inspiration from Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart's famous 1787 work Don Giovanni yet the Phantom's opera is depicted as far more bleak and dark. The novel In the novel The Phantom of the Opera by novelist Gaston Leroux, Don Juan Triumphant () is an initially unfinished piece that Erik, the Phantom, has been working on for a period of over twenty years. At one point, he remarks that once he completes it, he will take the score into the coffin he uses for a bed and simply never wake up. Erik plays a section of his opera following his unmasking at the hands of Christine Daa√©, who is stunned by the power of the music. As she describes it, the music takes the listener through every detail of suffering of \\"the ugly man,\\" taking her into the abyss of the wretched torment and misery Erik has experienced in his life. The piece, in Daa√©'s view, makes pain divine. At the end, it takes a rapid ascent out of misery whirling up into a triumphant and victorious flight as 'ugliness', lifted on the wings of love, dared to look 'beauty' in the face. Erik's choice of title and use of \\"Don Juan\\" is never truly explained, so it remains subject to various interpretations. Initially, when Christine sees the score and asks him to play it for her, Erik gets highly defensive and tells her never to ask him that again. The Phantom remarks that she is lucky not to come to that kind of music yet, as his Don Juan \\"burns\\" with fire not from heaven and would consume anyone who came near it. Whereas Mozart's and Lorenzo da Ponte's original Don Giovanni, inspired by vice and love affairs fueled by pettiness, will only make one \\"weep\\". After the Phantom is unmasked and his hideousness is revealed, Erik spitefully, and probably sarcastically, remarks that he is the same kind of man as Don Juan, because once a woman sees him, she loves him forever. He yells to her that he is \\"Don Juan triumphant\\". Eventually he crawls into his room to play his masterpiece to \\"forget the horror of the moment.\\" Christine is so moved by what she hears that for a fleeting moment she believes that his hideous appearance no longer matters, although her opinion soon changes. Erik finishes Don Juan Triumphant before the novel's end, and, instead of just automatically taking it with him into his coffin to die like he had originally said, he then wants instead to live a normal life doing normal things, with a wife, like everyone else. Earlier he is shown exclaiming that it \\"must be finished first!\\" with a sense of urgency. It seems to suggest that in Christine he saw hope of a new life, distinct from the darkness and passionate misery with which Don Juan Triumphant was created, and which had defined his life up until that point. While the Phantom clearly resolves to finish the piece, seeing it still as a major achievement, he passes away before he can reveal it to the world. The novel's narrator comments that the work was never found in the thirty years since Erik's death and speculates that it may still be in his house next to the subterranean lake beneath the Paris Opera. The musical On The Phantom of the Opera by Andrew Lloyd Webber,Theater History.com: Andrew Lloyd Webber's The Phantom of the Opera. Retrieved 2007-10-30. Don Juan Triumphant figures prominently in the second act as an opera within a musical. It is, as stated before, a thinly veiled adaptation of Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart's Don Giovanni which premiered in Prague in 1787, only told from Don Juan's point of view.THE PHANTOM‚ÄôS EVOLUTION - From Novel to Screen to Stage, by Cathleen Myers. Retrieved 2007-10-30. In this version, the Phantom forces the opera company to stage his work and orders Christine, a Swedish soprano and his protege with whom he is in love, to be cast in the lead role. She reluctantly agrees to do so only after her fiance, Raoul, devises a plan to catch the Phantom during the opening night performance. The score of Don Juan Triumphant is noticeably different from the style and staging of the rest of the piece and indeed the operas the company perform on stage. It is dissonant, with darker tones and key changes closer to modern compositions. All of which serve to heighten the idea of the Phantom's genius; as a composer, he is portrayed as musically ahead of his time. Only a small portion of the opera is seen onstage, in which Don Juan (played by leading tenor Ubaldo Piangi) and his servant Passarino make plans for Don Juan's seduction of the maiden Aminta (Christine). The two men have traded identities; Passarino (dressed as Don Juan) has already met Aminta and invited her to dinner. Don Juan (dressed as Passarino) is to meet Aminta and dine with her instead, during which \\"Don Juan\\" will loudly announce his return and \\"Passarino\\" will suggest that he and Aminta hide in a bedroom to avoid being found. As soon as Piangi slips into a hiding place to await the start of the scene, he is quietly strangled by the Phantom, who takes his place and sings \\"The Point of No Return\\" with Christine before declaring his love in front of the whole audience. The opera breaks up into chaos when she exposes his horribly deformed face and Piangi's body is found, leading to the finale of the musical (\\"Down Once More\\"/\\"Track Down This Murderer\\"). In the 2004 film adaptation of the musical, the audience at the opera house is seen recoiling in shock at the jarring discordance and staging of Don Juan Triumphant, which is very different from the traditional opera stagings they are used to. The costumes of the actors are also more sexualized than that in the stage show, being depicted as more form-flattering and tighter. Christine's dress, for example, changes from the low cut pink dress of the show to a sleeveless Spanish-style dress, complete with a flower in her hair. The Phantom's costume as well has varied considerably. In the show, when he reappears playing the part of Don Juan, his entire face and body are covered with a cloak and hood. In the film he performs the number in a red toreador outfit and black eye mask which in turn alerts Christine and the audience to the fact that it is the Phantom singing to her immediately. In the show, where Christine comes to the moment of realization varies depending upon the performer. In some performances the Phantom places his hands in front of Christine's face/eyes a gesture he did in \\"Music of the Night\\", which alarms her. In other versions, Christine feels the Phantom's mask, under his cloak, upon touching his face. She reacts accordingly. In other works For the 1989 film The Phantom of the Opera, an aria of Don Juan Triumphant was composed by Misha Segal. In Susan Kay's 1990 novel Phantom, it is mentioned that it was a piece solely based on passion and anger, as Erik's (the Phantom) childhood gypsy captor sardonically nicknamed him \\"Don Juan\\". When Christine hears Erik playing it, he remarks, \\"I raped her with my music.\\" In Nicholas Meyer's 1993 novel The Canary Trainer, Sherlock Holmes attempts to recover the Phantom's copy of Don Juan Triumphant from beneath the Paris Opera, but is unable to locate it. He states that based on the portions he heard, it was a masterpiece, but admits that he may have got (uncharacteristically) caught up in the emotion of the moment, and that it may not have been so great after all.

Fortune magazine deemed Marlboro Friday \\"the day the Marlboro Man fell off his horse.\\" for Philip Morris Investors interpreted the price slash as an admission of defeat from the Marlboro brand, that Philip Morris could no longer justify its higher price tag and now had to compete with generic brands. Since the Marlboro man was an image that stood since 1954, it was considered one of the biggest marketing icons, investors reasoned that to see the Marlboro icon give in to a price war, the marketing itself must be ineffective. As a result of plummeting stock value in major American brands, 1993 marked a slight decrease in U.S. ad expenditures. It was the only decrease to occur since 1970. At the time, this event was regarded as signifying \\"the death of a brand\\" and the advent of a \\"value-minded\\" consumer generation who pay more attention to the real value of products and not the brand names. This view soon proved to be incorrect, with the rest of the decade's economy being dominated by brands and driven by high-budget marketing campaigns.

After meeting in other parishes' churches for some years, in 1918 the parish purchased a building to the west of downtown and converted it into a church. The congregation of St. John the Baptist Ukrainian Catholic Church erected a memorial scroll which is dedicated to the memory of the members of this Parish who served during the Second World War. In 1966 it moved into a temporary building on Carling Avenue. It was planned to build a permanent church on that site, but the location proved too small. The current church was built in 1987. It is located near the intersection of Baseline Road and Prince of Wales Drive, overlooking the Rideau Canal and Carleton University. The ornate structure in Konstantin Thon's Neo-Byzantine style, was in part built to celebrate the millennium of the Baptism of Kiev .

Commercially, a published adventure comes as a pre-packaged book or box set that is used exclusively by the Dungeon Master. It typically contains background information for the plot or story, maps, vignettes of interesting locations, site inventories, creature descriptions and statistics, player visual aids, and suggested rules for evaluating events and likely player actions. The term adventure is currently used by the game's publisher Wizards of the Coast. In early editions of the game these publications were commonly referred to as modules, which stems from the term dungeon module, used to refer to the earliest adventures published by TSR, with other variations on the module name appearing on latter adventures. The term module continued to be popular among players of the original Dungeons & Dragons and Advanced Dungeons & Dragons even after newer publications were labeled adventure. Adventures that appear as a part of a larger accessory are often referred to as scenarios. The exact differences between the terms adventure, module, scenario, and accessory are hard to precisely define in Dungeons & Dragons terminology, as they all have been used in different ways. History of official modules and adventures The first published Dungeons & Dragons scenario was \\"Temple of the Frog\\", included in 1975's Blackmoor Dungeons & Dragons rules supplement. This scenario was later developed into the stand-alone module DA2 ‚Äì Temple of the Frog for the D&D; Expert set rules (TSR, 1986). The first stand-alone Dungeons & Dragons adventure module, Palace of the Vampire Queen, was published in 1976 by Wee Warriors. Although TSR did not produce this module, the company did distribute the first three printings on behalf of Wee Warriors. The adventure was described as a \\"Dungeon Masters Kit\\" rather than a \\"module\\" or an \\"adventure\\". Also in 1976, the adventure Lost Caverns of Tsojconth was distributed by Metro Detroit Gamers as the tournament module for the gaming convention Wintercon V, but was not published for general distribution at the time. The adventure was later re-written for the first edition Advanced Dungeons & Dragons rules and published as module S4 ‚Äì The Lost Caverns of Tsojcanth (TSR, 1982). Additional unpublished adventures were distributed at gaming conventions during this period, including Steading of the Hill Giant Chief, used as a tournament module for Origins '78. Later in 1978, Steading of the Hill Giant Chief became the first stand-alone Dungeons & Dragons module actually produced and published by TSR. TSR Hobbies produced a series of six adventures in 1978 that had previously only been used in tournaments. The company initiated its practice of assigning a code to each module published at the time, assigning the \\"G1\\" code to Steading of the Hill Giant Chief. TSR's practice of coding modules into various series would continue into the 1990s. Contents of adventures The standard adventure is essentially an adventure kit including a backstory, maps and one or more objectives for the players to fulfill. Some include numerous illustrations. A Dungeon Master could purchase these pre-made adventures and use it or parts of it for a gaming session. The early format was a single booklet inserted, but not fixed, in a cardboard cover. As time went by the format and information included in module increased in variety. Dark Sun modules, for example, contained top-spiralbound notebooks. Eventually, the line blurred somewhat between what was an accessory or supplement and a module. Modules had a suggested character level, often displayed prominently on the cover, and from the late 1980s prominently display the logo of the campaign setting they were set in. Some modules were reprints or revisions of modules used at gaming conventions before being published. All early modules are now out of print, though some have been reprinted in revised form. As such, many early modules are now highly sought-out collector items, particularly the earliest printings. Module codes Except for a few early limited edition modules, all Dungeons & Dragons modules until late 1994 were denoted with an alphanumeric code consisting of a letter and a number. The letter codes were based in some way on the product, with the number following the letter designating what number the product was in the series. Modules within a letter set were usually somehow related, either thematically or as a series of linked adventures. For example, Z1 may be a prologue to Z2. Or Z1, Z2 and Z3 may have the adventurers fighting a similar enemy such as beholders. Though related, most modules were stand-alone and could be played without playing any of the other related modules. TSR also used the module coding system on modules for several of non-Dungeons & Dragons roleplaying games including modules for (Advanced) Marvel Super-Heroes and the Conan Role-Playing Game. The module code was de-emphasised in the late 1980s, which also saw the campaign setting logo become a main feature of the cover. The code was dropped altogether by the end of 1993. In 2008, the adventure code was reintroduced with the release of the 4th edition Dungeons & Dragons adventure: H1 Keep on the Shadowfell.

If interpreted physically, that is one more than the usual three spatial dimensions and the fourth dimension of time used in relativistic physics. It is an abstraction which occurs frequently in mathematics, where it is a legitimate construct. In physics and mathematics, a sequence of N numbers can be understood to represent a location in an N-dimensional space. Whether or not the universe is five-dimensional is a topic of debate. Physics Much of the early work on five-dimensional space was in an attempt to develop a theory that unifies the four fundamental interactions in nature: strong and weak nuclear forces, gravity and electromagnetism. German mathematician Theodor Kaluza and Swedish physicist Oskar Klein independently developed the Kaluza‚ÄìKlein theory in 1921, which used the fifth dimension to unify gravity with electromagnetic force. Although their approaches were later found to be at least partially inaccurate, the concept provided a basis for further research over the past century. To explain why this dimension would not be directly observable, Klein suggested that the fifth dimension would be rolled up into a tiny, compact loop on the order of 10 centimeters. Under his reasoning, he envisioned light as a disturbance caused by rippling in the higher dimension just beyond human perception, similar to how fish in a pond can only see shadows of ripples across the surface of the water caused by raindrops. While not detectable, it would indirectly imply a connection between seemingly unrelated forces. The KaluzaKlein theory experienced a revival in the 1970s due to the emergence of superstring theory and supergravity: the concept that reality is composed of vibrating strands of energy, a postulate only mathematically viable in ten dimensions or more. Superstring theory then evolved into a more generalized approach known as M-theory. M-theory suggested a potentially observable extra dimension in addition to the ten essential dimensions which would allow for the existence of superstrings. The other 10 dimensions are compacted, or \\"rolled up\\", to a size below the subatomic level. The KaluzaKlein theory today is seen as essentially a gauge theory, with the gauge being the circle group. The fifth dimension is difficult to directly observe, though the Large Hadron Collider provides an opportunity to record indirect evidence of its existence. Physicists theorize that collisions of subatomic particles in turn produce new particles as a result of the collision, including a graviton that escapes from the fourth dimension, or brane, leaking off into a five-dimensional bulk. M-theory would explain the weakness of gravity relative to the other fundamental forces of nature, as can be seen, for example, when using a magnet to lift a pin off a table ‚Äî the magnet is able to overcome the gravitational pull of the entire earth with ease. Mathematical approaches were developed in the early 20th century that viewed the fifth dimension as a theoretical construct. These theories make reference to Hilbert space, a concept that postulates an infinite number of mathematical dimensions to allow for a limitless number of quantum states. Einstein, Bergmann and Bargmann later tried to extend the four-dimensional spacetime of general relativity into an extra physical dimension to incorporate electromagnetism, though they were unsuccessful. In their 1938 paper, Einstein and Bergmann were among the first to introduce the modern viewpoint that a four-dimensional theory, which coincides with Einstein-Maxwell theory at long distances, is derived from a five-dimensional theory with complete symmetry in all five dimensions. They suggested that electromagnetism resulted from a gravitational field that is ‚Äúpolarized‚Äù in the fifth dimension. The main novelty of Einstein and Bergmann was to seriously consider the fifth dimension as a physical entity, rather than an excuse to combine the metric tensor and electromagnetic potential. But they then reneged, modifying the theory to break its five-dimensional symmetry. Their reasoning, as suggested by Edward Witten, was that the more symmetric version of the theory predicted the existence of a new long range field, one that was both massless and scalar, which would have required a fundamental modification to Einstein's theory of general relativity. Minkowski space and Maxwell's equations in vacuum can be embedded in a five-dimensional Riemann curvature tensor. In 1993, the physicist Gerard 't Hooft put forward the holographic principle, which explains that the information about an extra dimension is visible as a curvature in a spacetime with one fewer dimension. For example, holograms are three-dimensional pictures placed on a two- dimensional surface, which gives the image a curvature when the observer moves. Similarly, in general relativity, the fourth dimension is manifested in observable three dimensions as the curvature path of a moving infinitesimal (test) particle. 'T Hooft has speculated that the fifth dimension is really the spacetime fabric. Five-dimensional geometry According to Klein‚Äôs definition, \\"a geometry is the study of the invariant properties of a spacetime, under transformations within itself.\\" Therefore, the geometry of the 5th dimension studies the invariant properties of such space-time, as we move within it, expressed in formal equations. =Polytopes= In five or more dimensions, only three regular polytopes exist. In five dimensions, they are: # The 5-simplex of the simplex family, {3,3,3,3}, with 6 vertices, 15 edges, 20 faces (each an equilateral triangle), 15 cells (each a regular tetrahedron), and 6 hypercells (each a 5-cell). # The 5-cube of the hypercube family, {4,3,3,3}, with 32 vertices, 80 edges, 80 faces (each a square), 40 cells (each a cube), and 10 hypercells (each a tesseract). # The 5-orthoplex of the cross polytope family, {3,3,3,4}, with 10 vertices, 40 edges, 80 faces (each a triangle), 80 cells (each a tetrahedron), and 32 hypercells (each a 5-cell). An important uniform 5-polytope is the 5-demicube, h{4,3,3,3} has half the vertices of the 5-cube (16), bounded by alternating 5-cell and 16-cell hypercells. The expanded or stericated 5-simplex is the vertex figure of the A5 lattice, . It and has a doubled symmetry from its symmetric Coxeter diagram. The kissing number of the lattice, 30, is represented in its vertices.http://www.math.rwth-aachen.de/~Gabriele.Nebe/LATTICES/A5.html The rectified 5-orthoplex is the vertex figure of the D5 lattice, .

Root specialized in sexual assault and murder cases, partly because those were the only clients available to a woman attorney at the time and partly because few other lawyers wanted to defend them.Cecilia Rasmussen, \\"‚ÄòLady in Purple‚Äô Took L.A. Legal World by Storm,\\" Los Angeles Times, February 6, 1995. Early life Root was the second daughter of Clara Dexter Towles and Charles Towles of Los Angeles. She was born in 1905 and grew up in comfortable surroundings. There were very few women practicing law when Root graduated from USC School of Law in 1930. Root was unable to obtain employment and decided to open her own practice. Gladys Towles Root opened her office at 212 South Hill Street, Los Angeles California, the former location of the Rainbow Saloon. Root became a defense attorney for rape and murder cases. She became so skilled that by the early 1960s young prosecutors and defense attorneys would gather to watch her cross-examination of prosecuting witnesses. Legal career At age 25, Root defended her first client, Louis Osuna, in a murder trial. Osuna had hired Root to get a quick divorce from his wife but then, frustrated with the legal system, shot and killed her the next day. Root defended him in the murder trial and convinced the jury to convict him of manslaughter rather than first-degree murder. Afterward Osuna introduced her to other inmates interested in her services. In 1931 she successfully argued for a Filipino man and a caucasian woman's right to marry, which was at that time illegal in the state of California. The law was declared unconstitutional. Root served as president of the Southern California Women Lawyers in 1945. At the height of her career, Root was handling 1,600 cases per year and averaging 75 court appearances per month.Chiara Towne, \\"\\"Get Me Gladys!\\" ‚Äì How L.A.‚Äôs Best-Dressed Attorney Defended the Defenseless,\\" KCET, March 30, 2016. In July 1964 an indictment was issued against Gladys by the Federal Grand Jury in connection with her actions during her defense of one of the defendants in the kidnapping case of Frank Sinatra, Jr., the teenage son of Frank Sinatra. Three men had kidnapped Frank Sinatra Jr. from across the California-Nevada state line at Lake Tahoe and transported him to Los Angeles. The kidnappers collected $240,000 ransom. Gladys was hired to defend one of the kidnappers, John William Irwin. Charges were brought against Gladys based on her allegedly fabricating the story that the young singer concocted the kidnapping for publicity reasons. Gladys was indicted in 1964 on charges of conspiracy, suborning perjury, and obstruction of justice. The charges were dropped in 1968. Root fought with the Internal Revenue Service, beginning in the 1970s. The IRS contended that she owed more than $230,000 in back taxes when interest and penalties were included. She fought the judgment and lost in the federal appeals court in 1977. She attempted to appeal to the United States Supreme Court, but the highest court in the land refused to hear the case. She presented a flamboyant figure in the courtroom and was referred to as the \\"Lady in Purple.\\" She was especially known for colorful hair and the large, dramatic hats she wore to court. Personal life In 1929, she married sheriff‚Äôs Deputy Frank Root, with whom she had a son. They divorced in 1941 and in 1943 she married Jay C. Geiger, with whom she had a daughter in 1944. On Tuesday, December 21, 1982, while in Los Angeles Superior Court, Pomona, defending one of two brothers accused of rape, Root suffered a heart attack; collapsed into the arms of her prot√©g√© David Brockway, who was defending the other brother; and died at age 77.

The narrative focuses on a conflict between proletarians and bureaucrats within state capitalism. The proletarians enlist their grasp of dialectics in the fight against their oppressors, while the bureaucrats defend themselves using a combination of co-optation and violence. The film also contains numerous celebratory references to socialists, including Marx, Bakunin, and Wilhelm Reich, as well as scathing criticism directed toward the French Communist Party, trade unionism and Maoism. Subplots dealing with issues of gender equality, alienation, the Paris Commune, May 1968 and situationist politics itself are riddled throughout the film.

The cartoon was released on May 5, 1945, and features Bugs Bunny. The short featured the first appearance of Yosemite Sam, as well as the first short to credit (almost) the whole animation staff who worked on the short (previously, shorts credited the director, one animator, writer, musical director and sometimes the voice actor). The shorts also the first to use the shortened version of Merrily We Roll Along that played from 1945, to 1955. The title is a play on \\"hair trigger\\", referring to any weapon or other device with a sensitive trigger. Plot After opening credits underscored by a lively instrumental of \\"Cheyenne\\", an old-fashioned train is seen rolling along through the desert. It passes another train going around a utility pole, and voices are heard repeating \\"Bread and Butter\\" with the engine blowing its whistle to a tune called \\"Yankee Doodle\\". Bugs is riding in the mail car of a train, singing a nonsense song called \\"Go Get the Axe\\", when a pint-sized bandit attempts to rob the train (with the underscore playing stereotypical \\"villain music\\"), only to have it pass clear over his head. He then calls for his horse, which he needs a rolling step-stair to mount. He catches up and boards the train and begins to rob it while the mail clerk wraps himself in a package marked DON'T OPEN 'TIL XMAS. The bandit accidentally throws Bugs Bunny in his sack. Bugs assumes he's Jesse James. The bandit scoffs and tells him (and the audience), \\"I'm Yosemite Sam, the meanest, toughest, rip-roarin'-est, Edward Everett Horton-est hombre what ever packed a six-shooter!\\" (This pattern of Sam introducing himself to Bugs and the audience continued in other cartoons.) Bugs tells Sam that there is another tough guy in the train packing a \\"seven-shooter\\", and Sam goes looking for him ‚Äì and it's Bugs in disguise. Various fights ensue, as each character temporarily gets the upper hand for a while. In one scene, Bugs dumps red ink on Sam, compelling him to think he's been shot; he collapses but eventually gets the joke. Sam pushes his face furiously into Bugs', then pulls back and with a quiet, offended tone asks, \\"Why did you pour ink on mah haid?\\" After another skirmish, Bugs tricks Sam into dashing into a lounge car in which a horrific fight is occurring. Stock film footage of a stereotypical western saloon fight (taken from the Warner Bros. western film Dodge City, was used here). With the sounds of crashes and bangs in the background, Bugs calmly sings \\"Sweet Georgia Brown\\" to himself. Sam emerges tottering, banged and bruised, to a comical instrumental of \\"Rally 'Round the Flag\\", and a gag occurs where Bugs affects the stereotyped voice of an African-American train porter, and has the dazed Sam convinced he's supposed to disembark the train, piling him up with luggage; Sam even hands Bugs a silver coin as a tip, and Bugs says, \\"Thank you, suh!\\" As Sam steps off the moving train, the mail-drop hook grabs him and temporarily whisks him off the train. Bugs thinks he has vanquished Sam, and yells, \\"So long, screwy, see ya in Saint Louie!\\" a line that will be echoed in Wild and Woolly Hare and A Feather in His Hare. But Sam gets back on board somehow. Bugs and Sam start a fight on top of the passenger carriages. Finally, Sam has Bugs tied up, dangling from a rope, weighted down by an anvil, and fiendishly cutting through the rope, while the train is passing over a gorge. (\\"Now, ya lop-eared polecat, try and get out of this one!\\") The screen fills with the words the narrator (Mel Blanc, in close to his natural voice) is saying, \\"Is this the end of Bugs Bunny? Will our hero be dashed to bits on the jagged rocks below?\\" and so on. Then Bugs walks across the screen, dressed in top hat and tails, carrying a bag full of gold (reward money), and dragging the now tied-up Sam behind him, mocking the on-screen words (\\"Is he to be doomed to utter destruction? Will he be rendered non compos mentis?\\"). Bugs closes by turning to the audience and repeating a popular radio catch-phrase from Red Skelton's \\"Mean Widdle Kid\\": \\"He don't know me vewy well, do he?\\" as a bar of \\"Kingdom Coming\\" plays on the track at iris-out.

She is professor and Director of Graduate Studies in the Program in Literature at Duke University. Background Hayles was born in Saint Louis, Missouri to Edward and Thelma Bruns. She received her B.S. in Chemistry from the Rochester Institute of Technology in 1966, and her M.S. in Chemistry from the California Institute of Technology in 1969. She worked as a research chemist in 1966 at Xerox Corporation and as a chemical research consultant Beckman Instrument Company from 1968-1970. Hayles then switched fields and received her M.A. in English Literature from Michigan State University in 1970, and her Ph.D. in English Literature from the University of Rochester in 1977.Gale 2004. She is a social and literary critic. Career Her scholarship primarily focuses on the \\"relations between science, literature, and technology.\\" Hayles has taught at UCLA, University of Iowa, University of Missouri‚ÄìRolla, the California Institute of Technology, and Dartmouth College. She was the faculty director of the Electronic Literature Organization from 2001-2006. Key concepts =Human and posthuman= Hayles understands \\"human\\" and \\"posthuman\\" as constructions that emerge from historically specific understandings of technology, culture and embodiment; \\"human and \\"posthuman\\" views each produce unique models of subjectivity.N. Katherine Hayles, How We Became Posthuman:Virtual Bodies in Cybernetics, Literature and Informatics, (Chicago: University of Chicago Press, 1999)', 33. Within this framework \\"human\\" is aligned with Enlightenment notions of liberal humanism, including its emphasis on the \\"natural self\\" and the freedom of the individual.Hayles, Posthuman, 3. Conversely, posthuman does away with the notion of a \\"natural\\" self and emerges when human intelligence is conceptualized as being co-produced with intelligent machines. According to Hayles the posthuman view privileges information over materiality, considers consciousness as an epiphenomenon and imagines the body as a prosthesis for the mind .Hayles, Posthuman,2. Specifically Hayles suggests that in the posthuman view \\"there are no essential differences or absolute demarcations between bodily existence and computer simulation...\\" The posthuman thus emerges as a deconstruction of the liberal humanist notion of \\"human.\\" Hayles disregards the idea of a form of immortality created through the preservation of human knowledge with computers, instead opting for a specification within the definition of posthuman that one embraces the possibilities of information technology without the imagined concepts of infinite power and immortality, tropes often associated with technology and dissociated with traditional humanity. This idea of the posthuman also ties in with cybernetics in the creation of the feedback loop that allows humans to interact with technology through a blackbox, linking the human and the machine as one. Thus, Hayles links this to an overall cultural perception of virtuality and a priority on information rather than materiality. =Embodiment and materiality= Despite drawing out the differences between \\"human\\" and \\"posthuman\\", Hayles is careful to note that both perspectives engage in the erasure of embodiment from subjectivity.Hayles, Posthuman, 4. In the liberal humanist view, cognition takes precedence over the body, which is narrated as an object to possess and master. Meanwhile, popular conceptions of the cybernetic posthuman imagine the body as merely a container for information and code. Noting the alignment between these two perspectives, Hayles uses How We Became Posthuman to investigate the social and cultural processes and practices that led to the conceptualization of information as separate from the material that instantiates it.Hayles,Posthuman', 2. Drawing on diverse examples, such as Turing's imitation game, Gibson's Neuromancer and cybernetic theory, Hayles traces the history of what she calls \\"the cultural perception that information and materiality are conceptually distinct and that information is in some sense more essential, more important and more fundamental than materiality.\\"Hayles, Posthuman,18. By tracing the emergence of such thinking, and by looking at the manner in which literary and scientific texts came to imagine, for example, the possibility of downloading human consciousness into a computer, Hayles attempts to trouble the information/material separation and in her words, \\"...put back into the picture the flesh that continues to be erased in contemporary discussions about cybernetic subjects.‚ÄùHayles, Posthuman, 5. In this regard, the posthuman subject under the condition of virtuality is an \\"amalgam, a collection of heterogeneous components, a material-informational entity whose boundaries undergo continuous construction and reconstruction.\\" Hayles differentiates \\"embodiment\\" from the concept of \\"the body\\" because \\"in contrast to the body, embodiment is contextual, enmeshed within the specifics of place, time, physiology, and culture, which together compose enactment.\\" Hayles specifically examines how various science fiction novels portray a shift in the conception of information, particularly in the dialectics of presence/absence toward pattern/randomness. She diagrams these shifts to show how ideas about abstraction and information actually have a \\"local habitation\\" and are \\"embodied\\" within the narratives. Although ideas about \\"information\\" taken out of context creates abstractions about the human \\"body\\", reading science fiction situates these same ideas in \\"embodied\\" narrative.\\" =Nonconscious cognition= According to Hayles, most human cognition happens outside of consciousness/unconsciousness; cognition extends through the entire biological spectrum, including animals and plants; technical devices cognize, and in doing so profoundly influence human complex systems. Hayles makes a distinction between thinking and cognition. In Unthought: the power of the cognitive nonconscious, she describes thinking: > \\"Thinking, as I use the term, refers to high-level mental operations such as > reasoning abstractly, creating and using verbal languages, constructing > mathematical theorems, composing music, and the like, operations associated > with higher consciousness.\\"N. Katherine Hayles, Unthought: the power of the > cognitive nonconscious, (The University of Chicago Press, 2017) She describes cognition: > \\"Cognition is a much broader capacity that extends far beyond consciousness > into other neurological brain processes; it is also pervasive in other life > forms and complex technical systems. Although the cognitive capacity that > exists beyond consciousness goes by various names, I call it nonconscious > cognition.\\"Hayles, Unthought, p.9 Scholarly Reception Within the field of Posthuman Studies, Hayles' How We Became Posthuman is considered \\"the key text which brought posthumanism to broad international attention\\". In the years since this book was published, it has been both praised and critiqued by scholars who have viewed her work through a variety of lenses; including those of cybernetic history, feminism, postmodernism, cultural and literary criticism, and conversations in the popular press about humans' changing relationships to technology. =Writing Style, Organization, and Scope= Reactions to Hayles' writing style, general organization, and scope of the book have been mixed. The book is generally praised for displaying depth and scope in its combining of scientific ideas and literary criticism. Linda Brigham of Kansas State University claims that Hayles manages to lead the text \\"across diverse, historically contentious terrain by means of a carefully crafted and deliberate organizational structure.\\" Some scholars found her prose difficult to read or over- complicated. Andrew Pickering describes the book as \\"hard going\\" and lacking of \\"straightforward presentation.\\" Dennis Weiss of York College of Pennsylvania accuses Hayles of \\"unnecessarily complicat[ing] her framework for thinking about the body\\", for example by using terms such as \\"body\\" and \\"embodiment\\" ambiguously. Weiss however acknowledges as convincing her use of science fiction in order to reveal how \\"the narrowly focused, abstract constellation of ideas\\" of cybernetics circulate through a broader cultural context. Craig Keating of Langara College on the contrary argues that the obscurity of some texts questions their ability to function as the conduit for scientific ideas. =Reception of Feminist Ideas= Several scholars reviewing How We Became Posthuman highlighted the strengths and shortcomings of her book vis a vis its relationship to feminism. Amelia Jones of University of Southern California describes Hayles' work as reacting to the misogynistic discourse of the field of cybernetics. As Pickering wrote, Hayles' promotion of an \\"embodied posthumanism\\" challenges cybernetics' \\"equation of human-ness with disembodied information\\" for being \\"another male trick to feminists tired of the devaluation of women's bodily labor.\\" Stephanie Turner of Purdue University also described Hayles' work as an opportunity to challenge prevailing concepts of the human subject which assumed the body was white, male, and European, but suggested Hayles' dialectic method may have taken too many interpretive risks, leaving some questions open about \\"which interventions promise the best directions to take.\\" =Reception of Hayles' Construction of the Posthuman Subject= Reviewers were mixed about Hayles' construction of the posthuman subject. Weiss describes Hayles' work as challenging the simplistic dichotomy of human and post-human subjects in order to \\"rethink the relationship between human beings and intelligent machines,\\" however suggests that in her attempt to set her vision of the posthuman apart from the \\"realist, objectivist epistemology characteristic of first-wave cybernetics\\", she too, falls back on universalist discourse, premised this time on how cognitive science is able to reveal the \\"true nature of the self.\\" Jones similarly described Hayles' work as reacting to cybernetics' disembodiment of the human subject by swinging too far towards an insistence on a \\"physical reality\\" of the body apart from discourse. Jones argued that reality is rather \\"determined in and through the way we view, articulate, and understand the world\\". =Materiality of Information= In terms of the strength of Hayles' arguments regarding the return of materiality to information, several scholars expressed doubt on the validity of the provided grounds, notably evolutionary psychology. Keating claims that while Hayles is following evolutionary psychological arguments in order to argue for the overcoming of the disembodiment of knowledge, she provides \\"no good reason to support this proposition.\\" Brigham describes Hayles' attempt to connect autopoietic circularity to \\"an inadequacy in Maturana's attempt to account for evolutionary change\\" as unjustified. Weiss suggests that she makes the mistake of \\"adhering too closely to the realist, objectivist discourse of the sciences,\\" the same mistake she criticizes Weiner and Maturana for committing.

It was founded by Jacob Warren Bowman in 1927. Bowman was mostly notable for its baseball cards, which were highly popular in the 1940s, until the brand was acquired by Topps in 1956. Bowman also produced American footballThe history of football card on Footballcardshop.com and basketball cards. Nowadays, Topps commercialises a line of baseball cards under the \\"Bowman\\" name after resurrecting the brand in 1989.  History  Jacob Warren Bowman, an American chewing gum salesman, started his own company, Gum, Inc. in Philadelphia in 1927. Gum, Inc. started producing Blony bubble gum which immediately became the top selling penny bubble gum in the United States in 1929. The Blony trademark was registered by Bowman on January 13, 1931 (filed June 30, 1930). In 1937, Blony had 60 percent of the sales of bubble gum sold in the U.S., largely due to the fact that, weighing 210 grains, it was the largest piece of bubble gum sold for a penny. With the advertisement \\"Three Big BITES for a penny\\", Blony made Gum, Inc. \\"the biggest firm in the U. S. catering exclusively to the penny gum trade\\" according to a 1937 Time magazine article. By then, Gum, Inc. occupied five floors and the basement of a building on Woodland Avenue in Philadelphia. Bowman chewing gum wrapper of 1950, with baseball cards inside Blony gum came with color trading cards on various topics. A non-sports example, the 1938 series, Horrors of War featured 288 cards detailing various contemporary conflicts. The motto \\"To know the HORRORS OF WAR is to want PEACE\\" appeared on each card, but children nicknamed the series \\"War Gum\\". Franklin V. Canning became a partner with Bowman in 1930. Canning, a New York druggist who supplied the pink bubble gum base material to Gum, Inc., also provided working capital in return for 250 shares, half of the company stock. A subsidiary of the Wrigley Company developed a better gum base in 1932, which sold for less than Canning's base. President Bowman demanded that Canning reduce the price of the gum base, which resulted in altercations between the two, and ended in Bowman being ousted from the company in 1936. 1953 Bowman Color baseball card of Ralph Kiner In July 1937, Bowman returned to the company after a long, bitter legal battle which ended in the Pennsylvania State Supreme Court upholding his reinstatement as president of the company. Gum, Inc. had earnings of $49,000 on sales estimated at about $800,000 in the first six months of 1937. In September 1937, Bowman's estranged second wife, Ruth, filed a suit against Bowman for part ownership of Gum, Inc., claiming a verbal agreement to a half-interest in his holdings. Bowman expanded its business when the company started to produce trading cards in the 1930s. The first releases by Bowman were non-sports topics, but the company soon entered to the sports market with its baseball cards of 1939. The company produced a series of cards known as the \\"Play Ball\\" sets each year from 1939 to 1941. Production halted after the United States as wartime paper rations were enacted and the company did not return to making trading cards until 1948, then under the Bowman name. After the World War II Bowman emerged with its 1948 baseball card set, which became highly popular. That same year, Bowman also released its first American football card set of 108 cards,History of Football Cards and its first basketball cards set.1948 Bowman on PSA Card.com By then, Bowman was competing against Leaf Candy Company, which left the marketplace in 1950, that year Bowman sales of baseball cards alone was $1 million. For a few years, Bowman was the leading producer of baseball cards, but was soon overtaken by rival company Topps Chewing Gum. Bowman produced baseball cards until 1955. After a period in which the two fought to sign players to exclusive contracts for their cards, Topps bought out Bowman in 1956 for $200,000.History of Bowman baseball cards In 1989, the Bowman brand name was resurrected by Topps to use on some of its subsidiary sports card sets. In recent years, the Bowman company has become known as the top brand for rookie cards.  Modern sports trading cards  = Bowman Chrome = Another popular trading card set produced by Bowman is the Chrome set. After the success of the Chrome set by Topps, Topps created a Bowman Chrome set in 1997. This was initially fueled by rookie cards of Jos√© Cruz, Jr. and Travis Lee, but top rookie cards from the set now are of Roy Halladay, Miguel Tejada, Eric Chavez, Kerry Wood, and Lance Berkman. The set continued to be a mainstay, and got a major jump in 2001 following the inclusion of autographed cards. One of the rookies that autographed cards for Bowman Chrome in 2001 was St. Louis Cardinals star Albert Pujols. This card continues to skyrocket in value, worth about $2,500 not graded. In 2002, autographed cards of Major League Baseball (MLB) rising stars such as David Wright of the New York Mets, Joe Mauer of the Minnesota Twins and Bobby Jenks of the Chicago White Sox were inserted into the set. = Bowman Draft Picks and Prospects = Bowman also creates a set called Bowman Draft Picks and Prospects. This set is like regular Bowman, but shows cards of MLB Draft Picks, participating players from the MLB All-Star Futures Game and MLB rookies that have had previous issues (veteran cards). Usually relic cards featuring swatches from jerseys of All-Star Futures Game players, other memorabilia cards and non-rookie autographs called Signs Of The Future. Bowman \\"Draft\\" also has two chrome cards per pack, and the chrome subset has autographed rookie cards and all the parallels from regular bowman chrome. Many stars have had rookie cards in Bowman Draft Picks. 2002 Bowman Draft has rookie cards of Florida Marlins prospect Jeremy Hermida, Oakland Athletics outfielder Nick Swisher, Atlanta Braves outfielder Jeff Francoeur, Tampa Bay Devil Rays shortstop B.J. Upton, San Diego Padres shortstop Khalil Greene and Florida Marlins pitcher Dontrelle Willis. 2003 Bowman Draft Picks has rookie cards of Boston Red Sox pitcher Jonathan Papelbon, New York Yankees second baseman Robinson Can√≥, Philadelphia Phillies first baseman Ryan Howard, Milwaukee Brewers second baseman Rickie Weeks, Tampa Bay Devil Rays outfielder Delmon Young and Los Angeles Angels shortstop prospect Brandon Wood. This set also includes Grady Sizemore, Mark Buehrle, Ichiro, Chase Utley, J J Hardy, Huston Street, Dontrelle Willis, Josh Johnson, Jay Bruce, Jorge Cantu, Albert Pujols, and Jose Reyes. = AFLAC Redemption Set = Making its debut in 2004, was Bowman's idea of redemption cards for a set of cards from the AFLAC High School All American game. Players included were Cameron Maybin, Andrew McCutchen, Chris Volstad, C. J. Henry, and Justin Upton. The sets were delayed and not shipped until 2006, and the Gold Refractor cards - originally intended to be 50 redemption sets - \\"accidentally\\" had over 50 redemption cards slip into packs, which caused them to be delayed even more. Topps sent out a letter asking customers if they wanted a three-card auto set consisting of C. J. Henry, Andrew McCutchen, and Cameron Maybin. (Justin Upton was later added as a fourth person in the set) or the Gold Refractor set. The Gold Refractor set was shipped before the Auto Set.

Next years Bowman's Best would be one of the best Bowman sets ever. It had rookie cards of Vladimir Guerrero, Bobby Abreu, Andruw Jones, Hideo Nomo and Scott Rolen. The 1997 Bowman's Best set gave something new to the Bowman's Best brand that would stay with the Bowman's Best brand for a while. This set had rookie cards of Miguel Tejada, Kerry Wood and Roy Halladay, and the refractor parallels, but this time they had inserted autographed cards. Tony Gwynn and Derek Jeter were among the signers in this set, and there were refractor and atomic refractor parallels of the autographed cards. In 1999, Bowman's Best had autographed cards with two autographs on one card.

After the Baltimore Orioles purchased him from the Braves in , he adopted a contact hitter's batting stance (feet wide apart, bat held almost parallel to the ground). That season he had a .294 batting average with six home runs and 37 runs batted in.

Contrary to popular belief, Lau did not emphasize releasing the top hand after making contact with the pitch and following through with only the lower hand on the bat. He did, however, suggest this measure to hitters who‚Äîfor whatever reason‚Äîcould not fully extend their arms during their swings. Lau developed a list of \\"Absolutes\\" about hitting, which included: * A balanced, workable stance * Rhythm and movement in the stance (as opposed to standing still) * A good weight shift from a firm rigid backside to a firm rigid frontside * Striding with the front toe closed * Having the bat in the launching position as soon as the front foot touches down * Making the stride a positive, aggressive motion toward the pitcher * A tension-free swing * Hitting through the ball * Hitting the ball where it is pitched, rather than trying to direct it Lau served as batting coach for the Royals from 1971 to 1978, with the exception of the early part of the 1975 season when he was the team's minor league hitting coach after his temporary ouster from the Royals' staff by then-skipper Jack McKeon.\\"Royals Fire McKeon, Hire Herzog,\\" The Associated Press (AP), Friday, July 25, 1975.

Used solely as an enforcer, Burnett was largely a journeyman. In Burnett's minor league career, he amassed 2,562 penalty minutes for 13 different teams. In the 1999‚Äì2000 season, in only 58 games with the Kentucky Thoroughblades of the American Hockey League (AHL), he had 506 penalty minutes. After signing with the Mighty Ducks of Anaheim on July 25, 2003, Garrett made his NHL debut in the 2003‚Äì04 season. Burnett's first career NHL goal came against Brent Johnson of the Phoenix Coyotes on March 17, 2004. The enforcer played 39 games and registered 184 penalty minutes while scoring one goal and adding two assists. Burnett participated in 22 fights in his sole NHL season with the Mighty Ducks of Anaheim. His reputation for having a \\"face of stone\\" was solidified in his March 19, 2004 fight against San Jose's Scott Parker, who sustained a broken hand from fighting Burnett. Burnett signed an NHL one-way contract for the 2004‚Äì05 season plus a one-year option, but due to the 2004 NHL Lockout only played briefly as the player-assistant coach for the Danbury Trashers of the United Hockey League (UHL) in 2004. Burnett became a free agent and was signed by the Dallas Stars for the 2005‚Äì06 season, in which he played for Dallas's minor league affiliates the Iowa Stars and Phoenix RoadRunners. His last game played was in the Quebec-based Ligue nord-am√©ricaine de hockey (LNAH) on December 17, 2006 playing for the Summum Chiefs. The league suspended him for throwing a net at an opposing player.  Two-sport athlete  Burnett also tried his hand at lacrosse, signing with the Arizona Sting of the National Lacrosse League (NLL) in 2006, landing on their practice roster. He had not played an NLL game as of the 2006 season. During the 2006 season he played lacrosse for the New Westminster Salmonbellies of the Western Lacrosse Association Vancouver.

The first coup attempt took place on 4 February 1992, and was led by Ch√°vez. A second coup attempt on 27 November 1992, took place while Ch√°vez was in prison but was directed by a group of young military officers who were loyal to the Revolutionary Bolivarian Movement-200. The coups were directed against President Carlos Andr√©s P√©rez and occurred in a period marked by neo-liberal economic reforms, which were attempted in order to decrease the country's level of indebtedness and had caused major protests and labour unrest. Despite their failure to depose the government of Carlos Andr√©s, the February coup attempts brought Ch√°vez into the national spotlight.BBC, Thursday, 5 December 2002, 21:30 GMT, Profile: Hugo Chavez, http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/1925236.stm Fighting during the coups resulted in the deaths of at least 143 people and perhaps as many as several hundred. While officially unconfirmed, Cuban involvement in and facilitation of the coup attempts was alleged by multiple sources. CIA analyst Brian Latell suggested that the Cuban intelligence agency, the Direcci√≥n General de Inteligencia (DGI), may have utilized Ch√°vez to fulfill Cuban strategic dominance of Venezuela and its oil reserves. In Latell's view, the DGI may have either hired Ch√°vez as an agent or provided critical aid to his coup plots. Latell claims Cuba had previously engaged in efforts to destabilize Venezuela by aiding guerrillas in the 1960s. According to General Carlos Julio Pe√±aloza in his book El Delf√≠n de Fidel, both Fidel Castro and the succeeding President of Venezuela, Rafael Caldera, knew of Ch√°vez's coup plot. Castro allegedly provided agents to convince President P√©rez that there was no threat of a coup. After the coup, Caldera, manipulated by Castro and Ch√°vez, was then supposed to take power after P√©rez was removed from the presidency. Background Venezuela had enjoyed democratic stability since 1958, and also a degree of prosperity. This prosperity was greatly enhanced in the 1970s, when oil prices increased substantially, and Venezuela, a large petroleum exporter, received large revenues, which increased per capita income by about 40%.Statistical Abstract of the United States, 1971. 1982, and 1994 editions, \\"Comparative International Statistics\\" Venezuela experienced modernization and had one of the highest GDP per capita in its history, while also having an exchange rate of 4 bolivares per 1 US dollar. However, in the 1980s, other oil producers (especially Saudi Arabia) raised their production, and oil prices dropped. Venezuela's oil revenues dropped substantially, and per capita income declined by about 25%. This imperiled economic and social stability in general. The government's overspending on programs caused massive levels of debt with poverty, inflation and unemployment rising while income declined. Corruption was also widespread with crime increasing yearly, making the Venezuelan public, primarily the poor who especially felt neglected, become outraged. The IMF offered assistance to Venezuela with these debts, but on condition of Venezuela enacting budgetary and fiscal reforms to curtail the deficits. In 1989, President P√©rez put these neoliberal policies into effect, reducing social spending and many commodity subsidies, and removing longstanding price controls on many goods. These policies bore heavily on Venezuela's working class and lower class majority. The resultant discontent erupted in the \\"Caracazo\\" beginning on 27 February 1989.BBC, 28 February 2011 Last updated at 00:03 GMT, Victims of Venezuela's Caracazo clashes reburied, By Sarah Grainger, https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-latin-america-12593085 =Origin= Many of the participants in the coups had been members of the Partido de la Revoluci√≥n Venezolana (PRV) in the 1970s. The PRV was created by ex-Communist and guerrilla fighter Douglas Bravo, who after failing in an armed insurrection, sought to infiltrate the Venezuelan armed forces to reach power.La revoluci√≥n de la guerrilla Thus, preparation for the coup began more than ten years before P√©rez was re-elected in 1988. The coup organizers rejected the dominant political consensus of Venezuela, known as puntofijismo, which had been established in 1958. Under puntofijismo, political power was held by two political parties, Democratic Action and COPEI, which they saw as the two arms of a corrupt, clientelist establishment. The Movimiento Bolivariano Revolucionario 200 (MBR-200) was founded in 1982 by Lieutenant Colonel Hugo Ch√°vez Fr√≠as, who was later joined by Francisco Arias C√°rdenas. They used the Venezuelan revolutionary hero Sim√≥n Bol√≠var as their group's symbol. Their main complaint was the corruption of Carlos Andr√©s P√©rez as well as Venezuela's ongoing economic difficulties and social turmoil. In the view of these two men, the entire political system had to be changed in order for social change to occur. In February 1989 shortly before the Caracazo, Cuban president Fidel Castro placed sleeper agents in Venezuela to create unrest. With Cuba recently entering its Special Period and experiencing economic difficulties as a result of the Soviet Union's Perestroika, Castro allegedly sought to establish an ally in Venezuela so Cuba could also enjoy funds from oil profits. As the Revolutions of 1989 occurred in Soviet states, Castro had allegedly began to organize a coup in late 1989 that would indirectly use sleeper agents who participated in the Caracazo. Castro, who was allegedly one of the main organizers according to Venezuelan Major Orlando Madriz Ben√≠tez, would instead use Ch√°vez as the face of a civil-military action in order to avoid retaliatory actions from the United States. Coup attempts =February 1992 coup attempt= After an extended period of popular dissatisfaction and economic decline under the neoliberal administration of Carlos Andr√©s P√©rez, Ch√°vez made extensive preparations for a military- civilian coup d'√©tat. Initially planned for December 1991, Ch√°vez delayed the MBR-200 coup until the early twilight hours of 4 February 1992. Ch√°vez at the time held the loyalty of some 10% of Venezuela's military forces. On that date, five army units under Ch√°vez's command moved into urban Caracas to seize key military and communications installations throughout the city, including the presidential residence (Miraflores Palace), the defense ministry, La Carlota military airport, and the Military Museum. Ch√°vez's ultimate goal was to intercept P√©rez, take custody of him and allegedly execute him before he returned to Miraflores from an overseas trip, planning to capture the president at Maiquet√≠a airport. Troops in the street to help defend President P√©rez. The coup attempt was originally supposed to be performed by Admiral Hernan Gruber Odreman, the highest-ranking officer among conspirators who was supposed to capture President P√©rez when he returned to Venezuela from Davos, Switzerland. However, he refused after discovering that Rafael Caldera was to become head of the governing board following the coup. A second attempt to capture P√©rez was then committed hours later by then Army captain, Miguel Rodr√≠guez Torres. Since P√©rez had knowledge of the coup, the president was then driven without the car lights on and his vehicle sped onto the highway. Torres, surprised, then ordered those under his command to fire at President P√©rez's fleeing vehicle. MBR-200 troops running outside of the walls of Miraflores Palace. The final attempt in the coup attempt occurred 30 minutes later at Miraflores Palace where insurgents attempted to siege the palace and kill President P√©rez. Those attempting to attack Miraflores were told that the doors would be opened by the palace guards that were supposedly part of the coup. However, when the attackers approached Miraflores in an armored vehicle, they were attacked by the palace guards who knew about the coup. The firefight then ended Ch√°vez's attack and left 3 of P√©rez's bodyguards dead while P√©rez hid under an overcoat eluding capture. The president was then able to escape from the palace and then called General Ochoa saying, \\"No negotiations. Give them bullets. I want to be back in soon\\". P√©rez then used a local TV station to rally the rest of the military against his aggressors. Ch√°vez's allies were also unable to broadcast Ch√°vez's pre-recorded call for a planned mass civilian uprising against P√©rez. Ch√°vez speaking to media outlets following his arrest The betrayals, defections, errors, and other unforeseen circumstances left Ch√°vez and only a small group of rebels completely cut off in the Military Museum, without any means of conveying orders to their collaborators. Nevertheless, rebel forces in other parts of Venezuela made swift advances and took control of such large cities as Valencia, Maracaibo, and Maracay with the help of spontaneous civilian aid. Ch√°vez's forces, however, had failed to take Caracas since he remained inside the Military Museum. Ch√°vez soon gave himself up to the government. He was then allowed to appear on national television to call for all remaining rebel detachments in Venezuela to cease hostilities. When he did so, Ch√°vez famously quipped on national television that he had only failed \\"por ahora\\" (\\"for now\\"): In the ensuing violence, 18 soldiers were killed while 51 soldiers were injured, while the majority of those killed during the coup were civilians, with 49 killed and about 80 injured in the crossfire. Despite Ch√°vez's military failure, he was immediately catapulted into the national spotlight due to his action, with many poor Venezuelans seeing him as a figure who had stood up against government corruption and kleptocracy.O'Keefe, Derrick.

Government response The San Carlos military stockade, where Hugo Ch√°vez was held after attempting a coup-d'√©tat in 1992. In the process of resisting the coup attempts, government agents were reported to have killed 40 people, both civilians and surrendered rebels, either as extrajudicial executions or with disproportionate force.Clifford C. Rohde, Jamie Fellner, Cynthia G. Brown (1993), Human rights in Venezuela, Human Rights Watch, pp. 61‚Äì5 Arbitrary detentions numbered in the hundreds, continued for some time after the events, and included student leaders and other civic leaders not connected with the coup attempts. In addition, freedom of expression was suspended for two months in the February case and three weeks in the November case, with censorship of the media. A series of demonstrations in March/April calling for the resignation of President P√©rez and the restoration of constitutional guarantees were met with state violence, including indiscriminate police firing into crowds, with a total of thirteen deaths. A number of members of the press covering the protests were severely injured by police. Participants in the February coup attempt were tried under the regular military justice system. But in response to the November coup attempt, the government created ad hoc courts based on the 1938 legal code of Eleazar L√≥pez Contreras, drawn up twenty years before the transition to democracy. The Supreme Court ultimately ruled the courts unconstitutional but not on the due process grounds for which they were criticised. The Court instead found that the President had neglected to suspend the relevant constitutional rights (right to a defense, right to be tried by one's natural judge).Clifford C. Rohde, Jamie Fellner, Cynthia G. Brown (1993), Human rights in Venezuela, Human Rights Watch, pp. 71‚Äì2 Aftermath With P√©rez's public image discredited by the unsuccessful neoliberal reforms and shattered by the coup attempts, other politicians began to challenge his authority, endangering the decades-old two-party puntofijismo system. The turmoil and failed coups were utilized by former president Rafael Caldera who was supposed to take power following the coup. Caldera commented on the gradual deterioration of Venezuelan democracy and the explosive conflation of poverty and corruption in the nation. Subsequent actions by intellectuals associated with Caldera resulted in P√©rez's ousting from the presidency on 20 May 1993, on charges of corruption. Swift political maneuvering allowed Caldera to win the 1993 presidential election with a heterogeneous and non-traditional group of small independent political parties, named \\"National Convergence\\". As part of his campaign Caldera promised to pardon the coup plotters and later did so, which allowed Hugo Ch√°vez to participate in (and win) the 1998 presidential election. =Reactions= Media In December 1992, the Los Angeles Times focused on the possible causes of the attempted coups in Venezuela, noting the recession in Latin America and corruption in the government. The Los Angeles Times stated that the coup attempts could also be the efforts of corrupt Venezuelan officers seeking take over the government and make money from drugs.

Greif is on the board of trustees of the International Society of New Institutional Economics. In Institutions and the Path to the Modern Economy: Lessons from Medieval Trade (2006), Greif argues that institutions play a central role in economic development: > Studying institutions sheds light on why some countries are rich and others > poor, why some enjoy a welfare-enhancing political order and others do not. > Socially beneficial institutions promote welfare-enhancing cooperation and > action.

For colon cancer it is used either alone or with fluorouracil. For small cell lung cancer it is used with cisplatin. It is given by slow injection into a vein. Common side effects include diarrhea, vomiting, bone marrow suppression, hair loss, shortness of breath, and fever. Other severe side effects include blood clots, colon inflammation, and allergic reactions. Those with two copies of the UGT1A1*28 gene variant are at higher risk for side effects. Use during pregnancy can result in harm to the baby. Irinotecan is in topoisomerase inhibitor family of medication. It works by blocking topoisomerase 1 which results in DNA damage and cell death. Irinotecan was approved for medical use in the United States in 1996. It is on the World Health Organization's List of Essential Medicines. It is made from the natural compound camptothecin which is found in the Chinese ornamental tree Camptotheca acuminata. Medical uses Its main use is in colon cancer, in particular, in combination with other chemotherapy agents. This includes the regimen FOLFIRI, which consists of infusional 5-fluorouracil, leucovorin, and irinotecan. The regimen XELIRI consists of capecitabine and irinotecan. It may also be used together with fluorouracil and folinic acid for pancreatic cancer following failure of initial treatment. Side effects The most significant adverse effects of irinotecan include diarrhea, nausea and vomiting, neutropenia and fever, infections of blood or lungs (sepsis, pneumonia), shock, dehydration, kidney failure and thrombocytopenia (low levels of blood platelets). Text was copied from this source which is ¬© European Medicines Agency. Reproduction is authorized provided the source is acknowledged. =Diarrhea= Irinotecan-associated diarrhea is severe and clinically significant, sometimes leading to severe dehydration requiring hospitalization or intensive care unit admission. This side-effect is managed with the aggressive use of antidiarrheals such as loperamide or co-phenotrope with the first loose bowel movement. =Immunosuppression= The immune system is adversely impacted by irinotecan. This is reflected in dramatically lowered white blood cell counts in the blood, in particular the neutrophils. The patient may experience a period of neutropenia (a clinically significant decrease of neutrophils in the blood) while the bone marrow increases white cell production to compensate. Mechanism of action Camptothecin, one of the four major structural classifications of plant-derived anti-cancerous compounds, is a cytotoxic alkaloid which consists of a pentacyclic ring structure containing a pyrrole (3, 4 Œ≤) quinoline moiety, an S-configured lactone form, and a carboxylate form. Irinotecan is activated by hydrolysis to SN-38, an inhibitor of topoisomerase I. This is then inactivated by glucuronidation by uridine diphosphate glucuronosyltransferase 1A1 (UGT1A1). The inhibition of topoisomerase I by the active metabolite SN-38 eventually leads to inhibition of both DNA replication and transcription. The molecular action of irinotecan occurs by trapping a subset of topoisomerase-1-DNA cleavage complexes, those with a guanine +1 in the DNA sequence. One irinotecan molecule stacks against the base pairs flanking the topoisomerase-induced cleavage site and poisons (inactivates) the topoisomerase 1 enzyme. = Interactive pathway = Pharmacogenomics Irinotecan is converted by an enzyme into its active metabolite SN-38, which is in turn inactivated by the enzyme UGT1A1 by glucuronidation. =*28 variant patients= People with variants of the UGT1A1 called TA7, also known as the \\"*28 variant\\", express fewer UGT1A1 enzymes in their liver and often have Gilbert's syndrome. During chemotherapy, they effectively receive a larger than expected dose because their bodies are not able to clear irinotecan as fast as others. In studies this corresponds to higher incidences of severe neutropenia and diarrhea. In 2004, a clinical study was performed that both validated prospectively the association of the *28 variant with greater toxicity and the ability of genetic testing in predicting that toxicity before chemotherapy administration. In 2005, the FDA made changes to the labeling of irinotecan to add pharmacogenomics recommendations, such that irinotecan recipients with a homozygous (both of the two gene copies) polymorphism in UGT1A1 gene, to be specific, the *28 variant, should be considered for reduced drug doses. Irinotecan is one of the first widely used chemotherapy agents that is dosed according to the recipient's genotype. Society and culture =Approval= Irinotecan received accelerated approval from the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) in 1996, and full approval in 1998.FDA Review Letter =Names= During development, it was known as CPT-11. Formulations  A liposome encapsulated version of irinotecan sold as Onivyde by Merrimack Pharmaceuticals, was approved by FDA in October 2015, to treat metastatic pancreatic cancer. It was approved for medical use in the European Union in October 2016.

Biography =Education and emigration to America= Born on the estate of Arbigland in the parish of Kirkbean, County of Kirkcudbright, Scotland, Craik was the illegitimate son of William Craik, 1703 -1798, an agricultural pioneer and landowner. His half-sister, Helen, writes that he was about six years old at the time of his father's marriage in 1733. He studied medicine at the University of Edinburgh, then joined the British Army after graduation and served as an army surgeon in the West Indies until 1751. Craik then opened up a private medical practice in Norfolk, Virginia, and shortly thereafter relocated to Winchester, Virginia. =French and Indian War career= On 7 March 1754, Craik resumed his military career, accepting a commission as a surgeon in Colonel Joshua Fry's Virginia Provincial Regiment. While with this force, he became good friends with George Washington, at that time a lieutenant colonel in the regiment. Craik saw a great deal of action in various battles of the French and Indian War. He fought at the Battle of the Great Meadows and participated in the surrender of Fort Necessity, then accompanied General Edward Braddock on Braddock's unsuccessful attempt to recapture the region in 1755, treating Braddock's ultimately fatal wounds. Craik then served under Washington in actions in Virginia and Maryland, during various engagements with Indians. =Between the wars= After the war's end, Craik opened another medical practice at Port Tobacco, Maryland, and on 13 November 1760, he married Mariamne Ewell at her family's estate, Bel Air, located in Prince William County, Virginia. Marriamne would later become the great-aunt of Richard S. Ewell.Hayden, Horace (1891)[1979], Virginia Genealogies. A Genealogy of the Glassell Family of Scotland and Virginia. Genealogical Publishing Co., Inc., pp. 333‚Äì354 They had six sons and three daughters. In 1760, he moved to Charles County, Maryland, where in 1765, he built La Grange near La Plata, Maryland. In both 1770 and 1784 he went on surveying expeditions with Washington, examining military claims in Pennsylvania and what is now West Virginia. =Revolutionary War career= With the outbreak of hostilities during the American Revolution, Craik once more rejoined the army. He served as an army surgeon, ultimately advancing to the second-highest post in army medicine. Craik warned Washington about the plots of the Conway Cabal, and treated the wounds of General Hugh Mercer at the Battle of Princeton and Gilbert du Motier, Marquis de La Fayette at the Battle of Brandywine. Mercer died of his wounds, but La Fayette was more fortunate. Washington persuaded him to move his practice to Alexandria, Virginia, where he built his house Vaucluse, where he died. Stetson, Charles (1956) Washington and his Neighbors, Garrett and Massie, Richmond, Virginia, LOC 55-11155 He also had a town house at 117 South Fairfax Street, 209 Prince Street, and then 210 Duke Street.Towntalk, 117 South Fairfax Street Washington summoned Craik out of private practice in 1798 in connection with the Quasi- War against France, installing him as Physician General of the Army on 19 June of that year. After the conclusion of hostilities, Craik mustered out on 15 June 1800. His grandson, who was named after him, would build his house Elm Grove, later renamed to the Craik-Patton House, on a tract of land awarded to Dr. Craik as payment for his service in the Revolutionary War. =At Washington's death= Dr. Craik's grave marker, in the Old Presbyterian Meeting House cemetery As Washington's personal physician, Craik was one of three doctors to attend on him during his final illness on 14 December 1799. Washington complained of respiratory distress, described by Craik as \\"cynanche trachealis\\". When Washington proved unable to swallow medicines orally, Craik and the other two physicians (Dr. Elisha C. Dick and Dr. Gustavus Richard Brown) treated his condition with bloodletting, the application of various poultices, and a rectal solution of calomel and tartar. Washington's condition continued to deteriorate, but Craik and Brown decided against Dick's suggestion of a tracheotomy (which might have been lifesaving, but likely would have spread the infection and caused sepsis), and Washington died at 10:10 p.m. Brown and Craik co-published an account of their treatment in December 1800. Craik died in Alexandria in 1814; he is buried in the graveyard of the Old Presbyterian Meeting House in that city.

Cowan was a left winger and played 434 games in the National Hockey League (NHL). In 2019, he was named the interim head coach of the Saint John Sea Dogs, a Quebec Major Junior Hockey League team. Playing career After coming out of junior hockey in the Ontario Hockey League, Cowan was not drafted in the NHL Entry Draft; he was signed by the Calgary Flames on 2 October 1995. He would play for the Flames' minor league affiliates (the Roanoke Express of the ECHL and the Saint John Flames of the AHL) for the next few years, before making Calgary's roster in the 1999‚Äì2000 NHL season. He would play for the Flames for two seasons before being traded with Kurtis Foster to the Atlanta Thrashers for Petr Buzek on 18 December 2001. In 2003‚Äì04, his third season with the Thrashers, Cowan was enjoying a career year, scoring 9 goals and 24 points through 58 games. However, he was once again traded on 9 March 2004, to the Los Angeles Kings in exchange for Kip Brennan. He finished the season with a career-high 11 goals, 16 assists and 27 points. On 30 December 2006, the Kings placed Cowan on waivers and was subsequently claimed by the Vancouver Canucks. Towards the end of his first season with Vancouver, Cowan rose to brief prominence, scoring an unexpected 6 goals in 4 games. During that span, a bra was thrown on the ice after his second goal of the game against the Tampa Bay Lightning, coining the moniker \\"Cowan the Bra-barian\\". The unique celebration was popularized among fans and in response, the entire Canucks team signed a bra that was auctioned to raise money for breast cancer research. As the Canucks entered the playoffs as the third seed, Cowan scored the first playoff goal of his NHL career in game one of the second round against the Anaheim Ducks. The following game, he scored the game-winning overtime goal to tie the series 1-1. Vancouver was, however, defeated in five games by Anaheim. Before the start of the 2007‚Äì08 season, Cowan was re-signed by the Canucks to a two-year, $1.45-million contract extension. However, Cowan failed to build on the momentum he had drawn the previous campaign. He was injured early in the season, suffering a strained hip flexor on October 13, 2007, following a fight with the Oilers' Zack Stortini. Shortly after he returned, he was re-injured in a December 9 game against the Pittsburgh Penguins, separating his shoulder on a hit from enforcer Georges Laraque. Cowan finished the season with just 1 assist in 46 games. Shortly before the 2008‚Äì09 season, he was put on waivers and cleared. Instead of being assigned to the Canucks' AHL affiliate, the Manitoba Moose, he was sent to the Peoria Rivermen as the Moose had already met their five NHL veteran maximum. On April 30, 2009 Cowan was recalled from Peoria for the Canucks' 2009 playoff run. On August 20, 2009, Cowan signed a one-year contract with the Buffalo Sabres. While not featuring with the Sabres, Cowan was assigned and played the 2009‚Äì10 season, with the Portland Pirates of the AHL. He appeared in 62 games, recording a professional high of 18 goals. As an unsigned free agent over the summer, on December 17, 2010, Cowan belatedly signed a professional try-out contract with the Toronto Marlies of the AHL, later agreeing to a standard contract for the remainder of the 2010‚Äì11 season. On August 12, 2011, Cowan concluded his NHL career by signing his first contract abroad in Europe on a one-year contract to play with the Iserlohn Roosters of the DEL.

Stanley and William D. Danko. This book is a compilation of research done by the two authors in the profiles of 'millionaires' (note the term 'millionaire' denotes U.S. households with net- worths exceeding one million dollars (USD)). The authors compare the behaviour of those they call UAWs (Under Accumulators of Wealth) and those who are PAWs (Prodigious Accumulator of Wealth). Their findings, that millionaires are disproportionately clustered in middle-class and blue collar neighborhoods and not in more affluent or white-collar communities, came as a surprise to the authors who anticipated the contrary. Stanley and Danko's book explains why, noting that high-income white-collar professionals are more likely to devote their income to luxury goods or status items, thus neglecting savings and investments. UAWs versus PAWs Under Accumulator of Wealth (UAW) is a name coined by the authors used to represent individuals who have a low net wealth compared to their income. A doctor earning $250,000 per year could be considered an \\"Under Accumulator of Wealth\\" if their net worth is low relative to lifetime earnings.Stanley, Thomas, and William Danko. The Millionaire Next Door. New York: Pocket Books, 1996. Take for example a 50-year-old doctor earning $250,000. According to the authors' formula he should be saving 10% yearly and should have about $1.25 million in net worth (50*250,000*10%). If their net worth is lower, they are an \\"Under Accumulator\\". The UAW style is based more on consumption of income rather than on the method of saving income. A Prodigious Accumulator of Wealth (PAW) is the reciprocal of the more common UAW, accumulating usually well over one tenth of the product of the individual‚Äôs age and their realized pretax income. The authors define an Average Accumulator of Wealth (AAW) as having a net worth equal to one-tenth their age multiplied by their current annual income from all sources. E.g., a 50-year-old person who over the past twelve months earned employment income of $45,000 and investment income of $5,000 should have an expected net worth of $250,000. An \\"Under Accumulator of Wealth (UAW)\\" would have half that amount, and a \\"Prodigious Accumulator of Wealth (PAW)\\" would have two times. This metric has been criticized since, for example, a 20-year-old making $50k a year should have a net worth of $100k to be considered an \\"average accumulator of wealth\\". That makes little sense since it would take a new graduate years of strong savings and investments to accumulate that amount. Critics further argue that formula fails to take into account compounding interest; younger people up to age 45 or so will generally have much less as a percentage of income than older wealth accumulators due to compounded growth. Most of the millionaire households that they profiled did not have the extravagant lifestyles that most people would assume. This finding is backed up by surveys indicating how little these millionaire households have spent on such things as cars, watches, clothing, and other luxury products/services. Most importantly, the book gives a list of reasons for why these people managed to accumulate so much wealth (the top one being that \\"They live below their means\\"). The authors make a distinction between the 'Balance Sheet Affluent' (those with actual wealth, or high-net-worth) and the 'Income Affluent' (those with a high income, but little actual wealth, or low net-worth). Main points =Spend less than you earn= Anyone who spends more than they earn will fail to increase their net worth. =Avoid buying status objects or leading a status lifestyle= Buying or leasing brand-new, expensive imported vehicles is poor value. Buying status objects such as branded consumer goods is a never-ending cycle of depreciating assets. Even when you get a good deal on premium items, if you choose to replace them frequently, the older items hold no value and have become a sunk cost. Living in a status neighbourhood is not only poor value, but you will feel the need to keep buying status objects to keep up with your neighbours, who are mostly UAWs. The authors make the point that Hyperconsumers must realize more income to afford luxury items and become more vulnerable to inflation and income tax. =PAWs are willing to take financial risk if it is worth the reward= PAWs are not misers who put every penny under their mattress. They invest their money for good returns, and will consider riskier investments if they're worth the reward. Many put money not only in the stock market, but invest in private businesses and venture capital. =Family and Generational Wealth= The authors also make the observation that UAWs tend to have children who require an influx of their parents' money in order to afford the lifestyle that they expect for themselves, and that they are less likely to have been taught about money, budgeting and investing by their parents. The authors talked about the seven most common traits that showed up among those that have accumulated wealth. Those common traits are the following; high income, low expenses, frugal, wealthy, breaking even (Spartan), spender, broke, and breaking even (Lavish). Spending tomorrow's cash today The most prominent idea shared by UAWs and American society in general is \\"spending tomorrow's cash today\\". This is the leading cause of debt and a lack of net worth in the UAW category. This contradicts the common belief of a PAW: \\"save today's cash for tomorrow\\". Many UAWs do plan, under certain conditions (such as a rise in income), to use investment strategies to accumulate wealth; however, most don't actually use investment strategies to accumulate wealth once the initial conditions are met. For example, Under Accumulators of Wealth will promise to start investing once they have earned ten percent more in annual income. Unfortunately when most receive that extra ten percent of income, there isn't an investment made. These claims and ideas usually branch off an initial belief that a lack of wealth can simply be solved by an increase in income. Even among those that do invest money, most invest only because they have an excess of income. Between 2001 and 2004, the median family income dropped 2.3% and in response, the percentage of families who owned investment stocks fell by 3.3% showing that investments are only made in times of excess. =\\"Better Than\\" theory= The \\"Better Than\\" theory is one of the main reasons many UAWs don't hold true to their promise to invest after a rise in income. The theory is that the UAW's \\"necessity\\" for that income will also rise in response to the risen income level. Most UAWs are possessed by possessions. According to a study conducted by Yale and stated in The Millionaire Next Door, individuals measure the level of their success through comparison to nearest neighbors and/or closest relatives. Therefore, as the level of income rises, so will their desire to outperform those that they compare themselves to. =\\"Better Off\\" theory= In addition to the \\"Better Than\\" theory, there is a \\"Better Off\\" theory. This theory suggests that those UAWs who grow up in a poor family and land a high- income career have a tendency to feel the need to be \\"better off\\" than their parents. To a UAW, \\"better off\\" implies a larger house, a respectable degree, a foreign luxury car, a boat, and a club membership. A hypothetical example is provided in The Millionaire Next Door to explain this concept. Teddy Friend is a typical UAW that grew up in a poor family but was still exposed to a rich lifestyle at school. He saw \\"rich kids\\" and decided that one day he would be \\"better off\\" than his poor parents. Sure enough, when Mr. Friend reached a high income level, he indulged himself in possessions. He bought a large home along with a foreign luxury car. According to most UAWs, he lives a very comfortable lifestyle. He lives a very comfortable lifestyle in terms of possessions, but in terms of financial security, Mr. Friend's lifestyle is uncomfortable. =Money: a renewable resource= Another belief that UAWs have is that \\"money is the most easily renewable resource\\". This belief usually is another leading cause for UAW's consumption and investment habits. Money is more easily spent now than it is saved. In America it is easier to generate a high income than it is to accumulate wealth. Spending habits When it comes to spending habits, UAWs are everything but frugal. A typical UAW tends to live in luxury, style, and above all, comfort. Not all UAWs fit these characteristics. A $50,000-a-year janitor can be more of a PAW than a $700,000-a-year doctor. The spending habits that UAWs have are a direct effect of the ‚ÄúBetter Than‚Äù theory. =Million dollar choices= Some of the financial choices that UAWs make are considered to be ‚Äúmillion dollar choices‚Äù because if the choice hadn‚Äôt been made, the UAW would have in excess of a million dollars. One example of a million dollar choice is to smoke. Smokers and drinkers tend to be UAWs because instead of building net worth, they spend their income to purchase alcohol or cigarettes. Another hypothetical example given in The Millionaire Next Door explains how a small purchase of cigarettes over a long period of time can accumulate a large sum of money. Mr. Friend‚Äôs poor parents were smokers and drinkers. They smoked at least three packs of cigarettes a day during the week. Three packs a day over 46 years translated into a sum of money that exceeded the value of their home by $33,000. Even more extraordinary, if the Friends had invested and reinvested that money over a 46-year period, the portfolio would have exceeded $2 million. The value of a small amount of money over a long period of time is amazing. A UAW makes choices that, although financially insignificant at the present value, have a very significant future value. Choices such as drinking two cases of beer a week, smoking several packs of cigarettes a day, and buying large amounts of unnecessary food and objects are some examples of typical UAW choices. These choices are not necessarily large financial purchases right now, but over a long period of time, the opportunity cost of that money is very expensive. =Car shopping habits= According to the authors, a common UAW drives a current model car, purchased new, and may have financed it on credit. PAWs rarely purchase new model cars and are less likely to own foreign or luxury vehicles. An example from the book details a UAW that spent roughly 60 hours researching, negotiating and purchasing a new car. In the end, while the car was purchased \\"near dealer cost,\\" in the long run the UAW's time and money could have been more efficiently spent creating wealth rather than collecting possessions notorious for depreciating in value. The authors contrast the story with a PAW who decided that the pride of owning a brand new car wasn't worth the $20,000 price difference. =Investing strategies= The difference between UAWs and PAWs is wealth. Wealth is usually obtained through investment strategies that maximize unrealized (nontaxable) income and minimizes realized (taxable) income. UAWs tend to spend more time on purchasing a car than on looking at appreciating investments. Appreciating investments such as a 401k or an Individual Retirement Account (IRA) constitute tax-deferred growth and produce an unrealized income for the individual holder. Some UAWs do hold a 401k or an IRA but with a low portfolio value. UAWs usually have the belief that in order to comply with the ‚ÄúBetter Than‚Äù or ‚ÄúBetter Off‚Äù theories, they need to maximize realized income. Maximized realized income minimizes unrealized income, increases taxes paid, and produces low portfolio values. Certainly there are some UAWs that invest in the stock market and are very active traders, but most don‚Äôt. Active traders move from stock to stock to try to maximize capital gains on investments based on daily fluctuations of the stock market. This investment strategy is very risky, but has potential for some enormous capital gains. UAWs also are more prone to being swindled out of money from cold callers. Cold callers, usually brokers who in fact know very little about the stock market, target high income earning families and persuade them into purchasing investments with them. Doctors and lawyers are especially susceptible. A vulnerability to cold callers can subject individuals to lose trust in the stock market and eventually become a UAW. Then there are UAWs that have relatively low risk tolerance for investments. Twenty percent of UAWs keep most of their cash in cash/near cash accounts (investment accounts such as a bank accounts that have low interest rates, high liquidity, and are federally insured) so that they can have quick access to cash when consumption habits rise. Then there are some UAWs who have considerable knowledge of the specific market of a company or type of investment, but do not utilize that knowledge to their advantage. The Millionaire Next Door uses Mr. Willis as an example. He is a six-figure, very successful executive for Walmart. He has been employed there for 10 years, during which the company has been explosively growing. Stock prices have shot up in this 10-year period of time. During this enormous growth period, Mr. Willis bought zero shares of the company he worked for, although he had firsthand knowledge of its success. A characteristic that determines if the individual is a UAW is their belief about investing. A UAW will usually state the following about investing: ‚Äúit‚Äôs hopeless,‚Äù or ‚ÄúI never have the time needed to make it pay off,‚Äù or ‚Äúwe have never made so much‚Ä¶ but the more we earn, the less we seem to accumulate.‚Äù Other remarks might include, ‚ÄúOur careers take up all of our time,‚Äù or ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt have 20 hours a week to fool around with my money‚Äù. A UAW does not spend a considerable amount of time evaluating their investment strategies. On average, they‚Äôll invest only 4.6 hours a month evaluating their investment portfolios. This is about 83% less than the amount of time a PAW allocates to financial planning. Minimal time dedicated to financial planning is a leading indicator of a UAW. Educational and career choices Although UAWs exist in all career fields and have obtained different levels of education, some professions are more likely to lead to a UAW lifestyle. Doctors, physicians, lawyers, and dentists are among the top professions with a high UAW concentration of individuals. The individuals in these professions are twice as likely to be a UAW than a PAW. There are two reasons for these findings. First, because these professions require advanced degrees, individuals get a delayed start in the accumulation race. Most of the income during these educational pursuits is used to fund tuition, housing, and student loans rather than investment. The second reason is that American society has prescribed a lifestyle to these professions. Doctors are expected to live in an upscale neighborhood with multiple cars, a boat, and other luxury items. Their lives become a high consumption lifestyle to fulfill the ‚ÄúBetter Than‚Äù theory. =Correlation between income and wealth= With doctors having a high propensity to be a UAW as evidence, there is an indirect relationship between the level of income an individual earns and the net wealth that one accumulates.Reynolds, Alan. Income And Wealth. Westport, CT: Greenwood Press, 2006 Doctors have a reasonably high level of income; therefore, it is more likely that doctors have relatively low amounts of net worth. The same holds true for those that have lower levels of income. They are more likely to accumulate more in relation to their level of income.Keister, Lisa. Wealth in America. Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, 2000 Of course, there are those who are an exception to the rule on both sides of the spectrum. Mr. Friend‚Äôs parents were poor, but they lived a high consumption lifestyle leading them to be UAWs. Children of UAWs When children are brought up in a high consumption, UAW lifestyle, they are more likely to become UAWs themselves. More often than not, the children of high income UAWs become more devout believers in the UAW system than their parents. The children grow accustomed to extreme luxury and believe that they too must possess the same luxury as their parents, even if their income is much less. It is an extreme manifestation of the ‚ÄúBetter Off‚Äù theory. On the other hand, PAWs may also produce UAW offspring. If the Friends had invested the money they had been consuming, they would have been considered PAWs; however, the standard of living that their son, Mr. Friend, grew up in would have been diminished. Mr. Friend would have felt an even higher desire to be ‚Äúbetter off‚Äù than his parents were. He may still have been a UAW regardless of whether his parents were UAWs or PAWs. =Economic Outpatient Care= Economic Outpatient Care (EOC) is a term used to express when an affluent parent provides money to an adult child. Besides offspring observations resulting in UAW children, EOC is a contributing factor to the passing on of the UAW belief. Offspring who receive EOC have 98% of the annual income compared to their counterparts who are not recipients of EOC. In comparison, they also have 57% of the net worth. EOC gives recipients a false sense of financial security. For this reason they purchase homes in upscale neighborhoods that exceed the recommended value according to their incomes. Thirty percent of American families live in homes valued at $300,000, yet only earn an annual income of $60,000. These homes then demand nice cars for the driveway, nice furniture for the living room, and a nice plasma TV to complement the furniture. These offspring also purchase and consume the EOC rather than invest it. If a dose of EOC is given on a regular basis, the EOC can actually be absorbed into the individual‚Äôs perceived annual income. Expenditures are then calculated with the anticipation of a regularly scheduled dose of EOC. America: the ultimate UAW The average American is a UAW, with an annual income of $32,000, a total net worth of $36,000, and a realized income value that is about 90% of their total net worth. The government draws the poverty line based on income, and society determines a family‚Äôs well-being based on their level of earned income. Income is a poor indicator of well-being. On the other hand, wealth is a good indicator of the financial independency or financial dependency of individuals. Unfortunately society has an almost unlimited number of ways to consume income and limited ways to save income; therefore, individuals are more prone to spend than save. That eventually results in an adoption of a UAW lifestyle. Criticism Nassim Nicholas Taleb criticised the premise of the book on the basis of two instances of survivorship bias: that there is no mention of the accumulators who have accumulated underperforming assets, and that the United States had just gone through the greatest bull market in its history at the time of the book's publication. He suggested that the authors should lower the net worth of the observed millionaires to compensate for the effect of the unobserved losers, and to consider the fate of accumulators following prolonged periods of recession such as in 1982 or 1935.Taleb, Nassim Nicholas.

History The second Henley (DD-391) was launched 12 January 1937 by the Mare Island Navy Yard, Vallejo, California; sponsored by Miss Beryl Henley Joslin, a collateral descendant of Captain Robert Henley; and commissioned 14 August 1937, Lieutenant Commander H. Y. McCown in command. After shakedown in the Pacific and Hawaiian waters, Henley joined the Pacific Battle Force, Destroyer Division 11, at San Diego 12 September 1938. She departed San Diego 14 April 1941 to join the Fleet at Pearl Harbor. When the Japanese attacked Pearl Harbor 7 December 1941, Henley was moored in East Loch with battle stations manned, a green sailor having sounded General Quarters instead of Quarters for Muster. This fortunate mistake gave Henley under the command of Lieutenant Francis Edward Fleck, Jr., the opportunity to fire the first destroyer shots as the initial wave of enemy planes swooped in. A bomb exploded 150 yards off her port bow as she slipped her chain from the buoy, and, as she cleared, she received a signal that a submarine was in the harbor. Henley maneuvered through the smoke, fire, and confusion and sped out of the channel. Her gunners shot down one dive bomber with her .50 cal. guns and shared credit for another. Conned by Fleck‚Äîboth her commanding officer and executive officer were ashore when the attack began‚ÄîHenley dropped depth charges on a sonar contact, possibly a midget submarine, outside the harbor, and continued to blaze away at the enemy with her guns. In the following weeks Henley operated with the task forces to reinforce Wake Island and conducted patrol for the protection of Midway and convoy lanes. Henley carried out convoy and antisubmarine duty, primarily in Australian waters. On 11 May 1942 she rescued the survivors of the and , sunk during the Battle of the Coral Sea. She departed for Wellington 22 July 1942 to escort transports to Guadalcanal. As American forces stormed ashore in the Solomons 7 August, Henley patrolled on an ASW station, coming under fire from enemy planes but suffering no casualties and assisting in shooting down two in the process. As the fierce struggle for Guadalcanal raged, the destroyer remained in the area to screen ships bringing up supplies and reinforcements until 29 August. Henley then set course south, and remained in Australian and New Guinea waters until September 1943 on plane guard, convoy duty, and antisubmarine patrol. Fate When Australian troops established a beachhead at Finschafen, New Guinea, 21 September 1943, Henley formed a part of their protective screen. Attacked by 10 Japanese torpedo bombers, she claimed to have shot down 3 and assisted in downing 3 others in a fierce half-hour engagement. However, the valiant ship's wartime career, begun in the chaos at Pearl Harbor, was drawing to a close. On 3 October 1943 Henley was steaming with Reid and Smith on an offensive sweep off Finschafen when her skipper sighted two torpedoes fired by the submarine Ro-108 heading for her. Split-second maneuvering permitted Henley to evade those two torpedoes; but a third was immediately sighted, closing too fast and too near to be avoided. Henley was struck on the port side, with the torpedo exploding in the number 1 fire-room, destroying her boilers, breaking her keel, and displacing her bow about 30 degrees from the longitudinal axis of the ship. At 18:29, with all her crew having abandoned ship, Henley went down, stern first. Her companion DD's searched for the sub, then returned to rescue Henley's survivors, who had lashed their life-rafts together and were using flashlights as signals. Eighteen officers and 225 men were rescued, with 1 officer and 14 men missing. Honors Henley earned four battle stars for her participation in World War II.

Strom is credited as one of the greatest referees in the history of the NBA and was known for his flamboyant style and ability to control the game. Nicknamed \\"The Pied Piper\\", the assertive Strom made foul calls with his whistle by using a \\"tweet-pause-tweet-tweet\\" tune and pointing at the offending player. In addition to calling fouls with flair, he was known for ejecting players from games with style and he sometimes supported his rulings with physical force. Over the course of his career, he officiated 2,400 professional basketball regular season games, 295 playoff games, 7 All-Star games, and 29 NBA and ABA Finals. For his extensive contributions to the game, Strom was posthumously elected to the Naismith Memorial Basketball Hall of Fame in 1995. Early life Strom was born December 15, 1927 in Pottstown, Pennsylvania to Max and Bessie Strom. Earl's father, Max, was a foreman at a bakery, and Earl grew up in the household as the youngest of seven children comprising five boys and two girls. As a child, he became interested in athletics and competing in sports, and this interest lasted throughout his childhood and into high school. At Pottstown High School, Strom played football, baseball, and basketball. After finishing high school in 1945, he joined the United States Coast Guard towards the end of World War II.Strom et al., 89 Returning from service, Strom attended Pierce Junior College in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania where he graduated in 1951. Following school, the young Strom continued participating in sports and played for a local semi- professional basketball team in his early 20s. During a basketball game, he had an argument with a referee and the referee said \\"Look, you're not much of a player, and you've got a pretty good mouth on you, so why don't you think about taking up refereeing?\\" Following the advice of the referee, Strom decided to get into officiating. He officiated high school games for nine years as well as college games in the East Coast Athletic Conference for three years.Strom et al., 95 In 1952, he married Yvonne Trollinger, and the couple went on to have five children. Outside of officiating, Strom worked at General Electric in customer relations starting in 1956 and continued in this role through his first stint in the NBA.Strom et al., 43 He felt this \\"day job\\" provided security to his family since officiating in the NBA did not at the time. Professional basketball officiating career =National Basketball Association (1957‚Äì1969)= Early years Strom became an NBA referee with the start of the 1957‚Äì58 NBA season after accepting an invitation to join the league from Jocko Collins, supervisor of officials.Strom et al., 96‚Äì97 He further developed his skills in the league by learning from other officials such as Mendy Rudolph, Norm Drucker, and Sid Borgia. Strom ascended to the top of the officiating ladder by the end of his third season in the league as he was assigned playoff games, which was uncommon for lesser experienced referees at the time.Strom et al., 114 The following year, Strom and Rudolph made NBA history when they officiated the 1961 NBA Finals between the Boston Celtics and St. Louis Hawks. This was the only time in NBA history that the same two officials worked an entire series, which was the result of the two teams not agreeing on any other officials to use in the series.Strom et al., 115 Six years into his NBA career, Strom had worked every playoff game in the semi- finals and finals along with Rudolph.Strom et al., 127 In fact, the former was assigned to any seventh and deciding game in a series during this time. He was also involved in one of the most memorable moments in NBA history during the 1965 Eastern Conference finals between the Boston Celtics and Philadelphia 76ers. In the seventh and final game, the 76ers trailed the Celtics 110‚Äì109 with five seconds left. The 76ers had possession of the ball and attempted to inbound the pass as the Celtics' John Havlicek tipped the pass thrown by Hal Greer and preserved the Celtics victory. Celtics' radio announcer Johnny Most made his most fabled call: \\"Havlicek stole the ball! Havlicek stole the ball!\\"Strom et al., 82‚Äì83 And all this while, Strom had officiated the game in a cast as he had broken his hand while punching a fan during an altercation at a game the previous night.Strom et al., 81‚Äì82 Memorable encounter with Wilt Chamberlain In another significant moment in his officiating career, Strom was saved from an angry mob by legendary center Wilt Chamberlain during a game played in Memphis, Tennessee in the mid-1960s. Strom had made a call that went against the St. Louis Hawks and at halftime was called a \\"gutless bastard\\" by Hawks general manager Irv Gack at the scorer's table. The fiery official asked Gack to repeat the comment as he reached across the table and grabbed Gack by the shirt. Fans started coming down from the seats while Chamberlain, playing for the Philadelphia 76ers at the time, saw what was going on. He stepped across the table, picked Strom up and said, \\"C'mon Earl. Let's get the hell out of here.\\" Controversies More controversies surrounded Strom when he was again involved in a historical NBA moment during the 1967 NBA All-Star Game. As one of the referees in the game, Strom was responsible for the ejection of Red Auerbach, head coach of the East All- Stars. Auerbach remains the only coach to be ejected in an All-Star Game. Nevertheless, Strom was subsequently designated crew chief in 1967 and 1968 when the league hired Dolph Schayes as supervisor of officials for the NBA.Strom et al., 125 He was put in charge of scouting crews, rating referees, and developing the skills of lesser experienced referees as well as working a schedule of games. Departure to the American Basketball Association After more than a decade's experience in the game, Strom was offered a salary contract over 82 games for $16,000 for the first time by Commissioner Walter Kennedy in August 1969.Strom et al., 133 It was at this time that Strom became interested in listening to what the ABA, which started in 1967, had to offer in the bidding war that ensued between the two leagues over talent.Strom et al., 134‚Äì135 The NBA did not offer benefit plans such as pension, family hospitalization, and long-term disability, which were of importance to Strom and his family. Lured by Borgia, who jumped from the NBA to the ABA to become supervisor of officials, Strom and three other officials‚ÄîJohn Vanak, Norm Drucker, and Joe Gushue met with acting ABA Commissioner Jim Gardner during the summer of 1969. The ABA accepted Strom's demands of a $25,000 per year salary, a $25,000 signing bonus, and a health insurance and pension plan. As the four officials left for the ABA in 1969, it brought reform to NBA referees in terms of compensation and benefits. Regular officials in the NBA were offered contracts and salaries increased significantly.Strom et al., 140‚Äì141 Additionally, medical and pension plans were provided for the officials. =American Basketball Association (1969‚Äì1972)= Differences between the leagues While Strom earned more than twice as much in the ABA than the NBA, he soon became disenchanted with the ABA for the lack of big name superstars and arenas that the NBA provided. Strom had anticipated that the ABA product would be inferior to the NBA, but assumed that the increase in pay would compensate for the level of play.Strom et al., 143‚Äì144 However, he fed off the energy of the fans when officiating games and the small attendance sizes in the ABA made him feel depressed.Strom et al., 143 Controversies Controversy again did not elude Strom in the ABA. In a 1970 game between the Texas Chaparrals and Denver Rockets in Denver, Colorado, he was attacked by a fan who came onto the court after Strom confronted the fan who was using profanity.Strom et al., 154‚Äì155 Strom threw two punches before police officers took the fan away. For his involvement in the incident, Strom was fined $250 by the league. Not long after, he was fined by the league again. Following an exhibition game that Strom officiated between the Virginia Squires and Kentucky Colonels, he told a Philadelphia reporter that he had just seen the greatest player alive, referring to Julius Erving.Strom et al., 148 While Erving was a very influential player in his era, the president of the Colonels, Mike Storen, complained that Strom was promoting players. The league fined Strom $50, but he sent $100 to Commissioner Jack Dolph saying, \\"The first fifty dollars is for the fine and the second fifty dollars is because I'm tellin' ya' he is the greatest.\\" Departure from the American Basketball Association After the conclusion of his third season in the ABA, the dissatisfied Strom contacted NBA Commissioner Walter Kennedy to discuss returning to the NBA.Strom et al., 144 Encouraged with the support of Wayne Embry and Pat Williams, general managers of the Milwaukee Bucks and Chicago Bulls respectively, Strom met with Kennedy during the 1972 ABA Playoffs.Strom et al., 158‚Äì159 Kennedy informed Strom that John Nucatola, supervisor of officials, manages the staffing of officials, but Strom received a vote of confidence to come back to the NBA in the form of a handshake from the commissioner.Strom et al., 159‚Äì160 Strom met with Nucatola and discussed salary and benefits.Strom et al., 160 Strom was told by Nucatola that he would be getting a $25,000 salary and was guaranteed a job in the NBA for the start of the 1972‚Äì73 NBA season through a handshake agreement although no contract was signed. Strom was told a contract would be available to sign upon the completion of his twelve-game ABA playoff officiating schedule. Strom called the league to ask why he was not scheduled to officiate after his guaranteed schedule of games and was told by Norm Drucker, then supervisor of officials for the ABA, \\"You know the reason. They know you're going back [to the NBA] and they told me not to assign you any more playoff games.\\"Strom et al., 161 =Return to the National Basketball Association= With his ABA career over following the playoffs in 1972, Strom contacted Nucatola to get an NBA contract signed for the 1972‚Äì73 NBA season. Nucatola told Strom to call back after the conclusion of the 1972 NBA Playoffs. Strom called Nucatola following the NBA playoffs, but was told to \\"wait a little longer.\\" Strom continued to have difficulties with Nucatola over the next several months and finally sought the assistance of Richie Phillips, a Philadelphia attorney and NBA player representative.Strom et al., 162‚Äì163 Strom filed a $275,000 suit against the NBA in December 1972Strom et al., 163 for breach of an oral contract when John Nucatola told Strom that he could return to the league. The league filed preliminary objections to have the suit dismissed, but were overruled by the court. The NBA then moved for summary judgment which was denied. Concerned that there could be legitimate action taken, the NBA decided to give Strom his job back if he dropped the suit.Strom et al., p.166 Strom agreed to the terms and signed a contract before the start of the 1973‚Äì74 NBA season. =National Basketball Association (1973‚Äì1990)= Changes in the National Basketball Association Strom returned to the NBA and was among a regular staff of twenty officials.Strom et al., 172 Since Strom had left the NBA in 1969, referees now made twice the salary and received pension, health, and insurance plans. Memorable games Strom ejected Chicago Bulls mascot, Benny the Bull, in the third game of the 1974 NBA Playoffs series between the Bulls and Milwaukee Bucks.Strom et al., 174 Strom had ejected head coach Dick Motta after receiving a second technical foul for storming onto the court to argue with referee Don Murphy. As Motta left the court, Benny charged onto the court after Murphy and made obscene gestures to both officials, prompting the ejection. It is believed to be the first time a mascot was thrown out of an NBA game in history. During a game in 1982, Frank Layden, then head coach of the Utah Jazz, had seen enough of his team's poor performance and wanted an early exit. Layden verbally abused Strom so he could get ejected from the game. Strom knew what he was trying to do, and when Layden asked why he didn't eject him, Strom replied, \\"I know what you're trying to do, Frank, but if I've got to stay out here and watch this shit, so do you\\". After Game 4 of the 1987 NBA Finals between the Los Angeles Lakers and Boston Celtics, Red Auerbach confronted Strom in the hallway near the locker rooms and told Strom, \\"That was the worst officiated game I ever saw!\\", referring to the fact that the Lakers shot 14 free throws in the fourth quarter to the Celtics' 1. Strom stared back at Auerbach and said, \\"Arnold, you're showing all the class I knew you always had.\\" The Atlanta Hawks and Chicago Bulls played a game in the late-1980s that Strom officiated. Chicago's Michael Jordan attempted a slam dunk on a fast break and was undercut by an Atlanta player.Strom et al., 203 Strom called a flagrant foul and a player on the Atlanta bench yelled at Strom, \\"Ah, you're just protecting the superstars\\" to which Strom replied, \\"Damn right I am, you eliminate these guys from the game and we're all out of work.\\" Strom officiated Kareem Abdul-Jabbar's final game during the 1989 NBA Finals. Strom congratulated Jabbar and gave him the game ball in the locker room.Strom et al., 187 Referee strike During the 1977 NBA Playoffs, twenty-four of the regular referees in the NBA went on strike.Strom et al., 180 Strom and Richie Powers were the only two referees not to strike. Strom honored his contract since he felt that it was valid through the season and a strike would be a violation of the contract. Referees were seeking the right to collective bargaining, an arbitration clause that would lessen the power that team owners have on officials, life insurance paid to age sixty-five, severance pay, increase in salary and playoff pay, and an increase expense compensation.Strom et al., 181 After fifteen days and two rounds of the playoffs, the referees union, the National Association of Basketball Referees, was recognized as a bargaining agent for officials and playoff salaries increased from $150 a game to $750, $850, and $950 for the final three rounds of the playoffs.Strom et al., 184 During the strike, Strom was officiating a playoff game between the Portland Trail Blazers and Denver Nuggets in Denver, Colorado and was notified at the conclusion of the game of a death threat against him phoned in to McNichols Arena at halftime.Strom et al., 182 Controversies Strom's first notable incident since returning to the league that received attention by the NBA front office was during the 1974‚Äì75 NBA season. Strom officiated a game in Seattle and inadvertently pushed a woman who approached him at the scorer's table at the conclusion of the game.Strom et al., 174‚Äì175 Seattle SuperSonics guard Fred Brown pushed Strom into the crowd as retaliation for what he had done to the woman. Bill Russell, who was coaching the SuperSonics at the time and referee Hugh Evans separated Strom and Brown from a further altercation. Strom originally was going to be suspended six games by commissioner J. Walter Kennedy, but was changed to a $600 fine.Strom et al., 176 Strom went to the referees union to appeal the fine based on the notion that he was trying to defend himself.Strom et al., 176‚Äì177 The union did not follow through with the appeal, but the fine was rescinded a year later by new commissioner Larry O'Brien and Strom was reimbursed his fine payment.Strom et al., 177 Strom was officiating an NBA game during the mid-1970s between the Philadelphia 76ers and New Jersey Nets with Dick Bavetta as his partner for that game. The game was close at the end and Earl made a last-second call against the Nets, ending the game with a win for Sixers. Suddenly Dick Bavetta ran across floor to the scorer's table, saying, \\"No! No! I got a push off against McGinnis!\\" Strom then challenged Bavetta, \\"Are you overruling my call? I got pushing off right here!\\" Bavetta insisted, which reversed Strom's call and the Nets wound up with the victory. With the game over, players were walking to their respective locker rooms when the door to the referees' locker room flew open and Dick Bavetta came staggering out. His uniform was ripped and he was wearing a big welt over his eye, running to get away from Strom. Strom stepped out into the hallway and hollered after Bavetta, \\"You'll take another one of my fucking calls again, right, you motherfucker?\\" Strom was later fined for the incident. Strom was suspended from working any further games in the 1976 NBA Finals between the Boston Celtics and Phoenix Suns after Game 2 because the Suns had complained about the foul disparity of the first two games in the series. In the first two games, the Celtics attempted 58 free throws while the Suns had 44. Strom wrote a weekly column for newspapers near Pottstown which provided a perspective of the life of an NBA referee.Strom et al., 206 In the spring of 1979, Strom criticized Chicago Bulls team management, in particular president Jonathan Kovler, over the firing of head coach Larry CostelloStrom et al., 207‚Äì208 after 56 games. While this incident was occurring, shortly after, Strom was involved in a shoving match with a fan and security officer following a game played in Phoenix, Arizona.Strom et al., 208 These incidents led to Strom being suspended the remainder of the 1979 NBA Playoffs and was required to apologize to Kovler.Strom et al., 209 In order to keep his job, Strom assured the league that there would be no animosity directed towards the Bulls and decided to discontinue writing his weekly column. During the early 1980s, The Philadelphia Inquirer spoke with Strom to get a perspective on the life of an NBA referee for an article.Strom et al., 210‚Äì211 The sports reporter met Strom in a hotel lobby and was later joined by Milwaukee Bucks assistant coach, John Killelea. The three of them discussed referees and life in the NBA. When the article was published, the reporter wrote that he and Strom were joined by an assistant coach, whom Strom had bought a drink, and the tendencies for Strom to go into pressboxes to drink a cup of coffee and to talk with spectators that he knew in the stands. While the league had approved the article, Strom was fined $2,000 and suspended a portion of the playoffs. During the mid-1980s, Strom had a couple incidents with team personnel being in the referees' locker room, which was against league rules. In 1985, Dallas Mavericks owner Don Carter entered the locker room and accused Strom of having a vendetta against Dick Motta, coach of the Mavericks.Strom et al., 214‚Äì215 The next year during the 1986 NBA Playoffs game between the Atlanta Hawks and Boston Celtics at Boston Garden in Boston, Massachusetts, Hawks coach Mike Fratello was attacked by a fan. Fratello walked into the officials locker room and reported the incident to Strom. Strom eventually was fined and worked a couple more playoff games that year. Nearly halfway through the 1987‚Äì88 NBA season, Strom was fined $150 for reversing a field goal that San Antonio Spurs' Mike Mitchell made at the end of the half against the Indiana Pacers.Strom et al., 219‚Äì220 Strom was concerned about making the correct call after being told by Pacers coach Jack Ramsay and referee Tommy Nu√±ez that Mitchell's shot attempt came after the period expired. Final years During the 1989‚Äì90 NBA season, USA Today took a poll on the best players, coaches, and referees in the league as voted by coaches and players.Strom et al., 235‚Äì236 Strom was considered the league's top official in the NBA, receiving 83 out of a possible 193 votes. At the same time, the Detroit Free Press conducted a survey of 500 players, coaches, general managers, broadcasters, writers, and fans to determine the best official in each professional sport.Strom et al., 236 Strom was chosen as the best official in the NBA and the top official overall among Bruce Froemming (Major League Baseball), Jim Tunney (National Football League), and Andy Van Hellemond (National Hockey League). Strom's final game was Game 4 of the 1990 NBA Finals between the Detroit Pistons and Portland Trail Blazers played June 12, 1990 in a game that saw Strom correctly wave off Trail Blazers Danny Young's half- court heave that would have sent the game into OT, had it come before the buzzer. Post officiating career After his retirement from the NBA, Strom worked as a television color commentator for the Los Angeles Clippers from 1990‚Äì91 and wrote a book detailing his officiating career entitled, Calling the Shots: My Five Decades in the NBA in 1990. Strom also participated in charitable events, such as being involved in a celebrity golf tournament hosted by Penn State University, and coaching at a basketball tournament run by Celtics great Larry Bird in Indianapolis, Indiana. Not long before his death, Strom wrote a column for the Reading Eagle and Chicago Sun-Times. It was through this column that Strom discovered he had a malignant brain tumor, a form of cancer, by doctors after his wife, Yvonne, found grammatical errors as she prepared to type the column on a computer. Strom began surgery on the tumor in January 1994, which was successful, but he could not overcome the effects of the cancer and died on July 10, 1994. Legacy Strom retired having officiated 2,067 NBA games over 29 years. Currently, only referees Dick Bavetta and Jake O'Donnell have officiated more games. Strom was selected to officiate five of the nine NBA Finals that went seven games (the maximum number of games possible in a series) in 1966, 1969, 1978, 1984, and 1988, and is considered the last of an era for the \\"charismatic referee\\" type to officiate in the NBA. This is in contrast to today's officials who are said to blend into the background during a game and all bear a similar appearance and use of hand signals. During his career in the NBA, Strom was given the nickname of the \\"Road Ref\\" by Harvey Pollack, a statistician for the Philadelphia 76ers.Strom et al., 56‚Äì57 Throughout the year, Pollack noted how many times the home or visiting team was victorious and who were the officials working the game. Strom had the highest percentage of road team victories among NBA referees at 42.9 percent. This was the result of Strom refusing to favor the home team and letting the fans sway his decisions. When Strom started his career in the NBA, he felt the most important aspect was to get the play right.Strom et al., 220 Instead of selling a bad call, he felt that officials should admit their mistake, and get the call right. To get plays called correctly, he brought up the idea of limited use of instant replay for shots made at the end of a period (\\"buzzer beaters\\") and three-point attempts.Strom et al., 240 The NBA eventually adopted the use of instant replay for end of the period field goal attempts and fouls at the start of the 2002‚Äì03 NBA season. Strom believed that referee's job was to ensure the game is played correctly, which will allow players to play their particular style.Strom et al., 202‚Äì203 As the NBA began to evolve, Strom opposed the addition of the third official in NBA game for one season, the 1978‚Äì79 NBA season, and later in its present form since the 1988‚Äì89 NBA season.Strom et al., 198‚Äì199 Strom felt that well-conditioned officials who are able to stay on top of the play would be able to make calls that a third official would be responsible for.Strom et al., 199 Pottstown High School created the \\"Earl Strom Financial Aid Scholarship\\", which is awarded to a member of the senior class who has been accepted by an accredited college.

Life =Early life= K·πõish·πáabha·π≠·π≠a‚Äôs Ratnam√°l√° () says that in 696 CE (Samvat 752) Jaya≈õekhara, the Chavda king of Pa√±ch√°sar, a village (in modern-day Patan district, Gujarat), was attacked by the Chaulukya king Bhuva·∏ça of Kaly√°naka·π≠aka in Kany√°kubja (probably Kanauj) and slain by Bhuva·∏ça in battle. Before his death Jaya≈õekhara, he sent his pregnant wife Rupasundar√≠ to the forest in charge of her brother Surap√°la, one of his chief warriors. After Jaya≈õekhara‚Äôs death, Rupasundar√≠ gave birth to a son named Vanar√°ja. Merutu·πága, the author of the Prabandhachint√°ma·πái, tells a story that Rupasundar√≠ was living in the forest swinging her son in a hammock, when a Jain monk named ≈ö√≠lagu·πáas√∫ri noticing as he passed royal marks on the boy bought him from his mother. The story adds that a nun named V√≠ramat√≠ brought up the boy whom the monks called Vanar√°ja, literally \\"the forest king\\". When eight years old, the monk told Vanar√°ja to protect his place of worship from rats. The boy‚Äôs skill in shooting rats convinced the monk he was not fit to be a monk but was worthy of a kingdom. He therefore returned the boy to his mother. These details seem invented by the Jain writers themselves. No mention of any such story occurs in the Ratnam√°l√°. In the forests where Vanar√°ja passed his youth lived his maternal uncle Surap√°la, one of Jaya≈õekhara‚Äôs generals, who, after his sovereign‚Äôs defeat and death, had become an outlaw. Vanar√°ja grew up under Surap√°la‚Äôs charge. The Prabandhachint√°ma·πái records the following story of the origin of Vanar√°ja‚Äôs wealth. A Kany√°kubja king married Mah√°·πáak√°, the daughter of a Gujar√°t king. To receive the proceeds of the marriage cess which the Gujar√°t king had levied from his subjects, a deputation or panchk√∫la came from Kany√°kubja to Gujar√°t. The deputation made Vanar√°ja their leader or sellabhrit to realize the proceeds of the cess. In six months Vanar√°ja collected 24 l√°khs of P√°ruttha drammas and 4000 horse, which the deputation took and started for Kany√°kubja. Vanar√°ja waylaid and killed them, secured the money and horses, and remained in hiding for a year. With the wealth thus acquired Vanar√°ja enrolled an army and established his power assuming the title of king. =Accession to A·πáahilav√°·∏ça= A·πáahilav√°·∏ça (or A·πáahilapura, now Patan, Gujarat) was founded in 746 or 765 CE. The story of the choice of the site is the usual story of a hunted hare turning on the hounds showing the place to be the special nurse of strength and courage. Vanar√°ja is said to have asked a Bharv√°·∏ç or Shepherd named A·πáahila son of ≈ö√°khad√° to show him the best site. A·πáahila agreed on condition that the city should be called by his name. A·πáahila accordingly showed Vanar√°ja the place where a hare had attacked and chased a dog. The city may have been called after some local chief since it was popularly known as A·πáahilav√°·∏ça (Sanskrit:A·πáahilav√°ta) that is \\"the place of A·πáahila\\". In the Prabandhachint√°ma·πái, Merutu·πága gives 746 CE (S. 802) as the date of the accession of Vanar√°ja, while in his Vich√°ra≈õre·πái the same author gives 765 CE (S. 821 Vaisakha ≈öukla 2) as the date of the foundation of the city. The discrepancy may be explained by taking 746 CE (S. 802) to refer to the date of Vanar√°ja‚Äôs getting money enough to fix the site of his capital, and 765 CE (S. 821) to refer to the date of his accession in the completed A·πáahilav√°·∏ça. According to local tradition, an image of Ganpati in the city also have an inscription dated S. 802 but it seems late installation. Vich√°ra≈õre·πái gives 765 (S. 821) seems the more probable date for the accession to the throne as the Prabandhachint√°ma·πái says that Vanar√°ja accessed to throne at A·πáahilapura when he was about fifty. This accords with the date fixed on other grounds. Placing Vanar√°ja‚Äôs birth at about 720 CE would make him 44 in 765 CE (S. 821) corresponding to date mentioned in the Vich√°ra≈õre·πái. Merutu·πága in both his works gives the length of Vanar√°ja‚Äôs life at 109 and of his reign at sixty years. The figure 60 seems to mark the length of his life and not of his reign. So long a reign as sixty years is barely possible for a sovereign who succeeded late in life, and the 109 years of his life can hardly be correct. Taking Vanar√°ja‚Äôs age at 45 when he was installed in 765 CE (S. 821) and allowing fifteen years more to complete the sixty years, he probably died circa 780 (S. 836), the closing year of his reign. Vanraja was succeeded by his son, Yogaraja. The Prabandhachint√°ma·πái narrates how generously Vanar√°ja rewarded those who had helped him in his adversity. His installation was performed by a woman named ≈ör√≠ Dev√≠ of K√°kara village (probably Kankrej) whom in fulfillment of an early promise Vanar√°ja had taken to be his sister. The story regarding the promise is that once when Vanar√°ja had gone with his uncle on a thieving expedition to K√°kara village and had broken into the house of a merchant he by mistake dipped his hand into a pot of curds. As to touch curds is the same as to dine at a house as a guest, Vanar√°ja left the house without taking anything from it. Hearing what had happened the merchant‚Äôs sister invited Vanar√°ja as a brother to dinner and gave him clothes. In return Vanar√°ja promised if he ever regained his father‚Äôs kingdom he should receive his installation as king at her hands. Vanar√°ja chose as minister a Baniya named J√°mba. The story is that while Vanar√°ja was looting with two others he came across a merchant J√°mba who had five arrows. Seeing only three enemies, J√°mba broke and threw away two of the arrows, shouting ‚ÄòOne for each of you.‚Äô Vanar√°ja admiring his coolness persuaded J√°mba to join his band and found him so useful that he promised to make him minister. From the absence of any reference to him in these and similar tales it is probable that his uncle Surap√°la died before the installing of Vanar√°ja. The KuvalayamƒÅlƒÅ mentions a legend about Vanaraja that he was assisted by a Jain monk in acquiring his kingdom. He also credited with the foundation of Champaner, in honour one of his generals, Champa. Image Vanar√°ja is said to have built at A·πáahilv√°·∏ça a Jain temple of Pa√±ch√°sar√° Parshwanath so called because the image was brought from the old settlement of Pa√±ch√°sar. Mention of this temple continues during the Chaulukya and V√°ghel√° times. Vanar√°ja is said to have placed a bowing image of himself facing the image of Parshwanatha. The figure of Vanar√°ja is still shown at Sidhpur and a woodcut of it is given by Alexander Kinloch Forbes in his R√°s M√°l√° (1856). It is clearly the figure of a king with the umbrella of state and a nimbus round the head and in the ears the long ornaments called kundalas noticed by Arab travellers as characteristic of the Balhara or R√°sh·π≠rak√∫·π≠a kings who were contemporary with Vanar√°ja. The king wears a long beard, a short waist-cloth or dhoti, a waistband or kammarband, and a shoulder garment or uparna whose ends hang down the back. Besides the earrings he is adorned with bracelets armlets and anklets and a large ornament hangs across the chest from the left shoulder to the right hip. The right hand is held near the chest in the act of granting protection; and the left hand holds something which cannot be made out. By his side is the umbrella-bearer and five other attendants. The statue closely resembles the lifesize figure of a king of the Chaulukya period lying in the yard of a temple at Maliya about twenty-four miles north of Somnath. At Somnath are similar but less rich contemporary figures of local officers of the Chaulukyas. Another similar figure of which only the torso remains is the statue of Anr√°ja the father of Vastupala in a niche in Vastup√°la‚Äôs temple at Girn√°r. The details of this figure belong to the Chaulukya period. Religion Ruins of Shiva temple at Puaranogadh at Manjal in Kutch Vanaraja Chavda is not portrayed as a Jain by birth, yet he is shown participating in distinctly Jain rituals of kingship by Jain authors. =Temples= The Merutunga's prabandhachintamani states about Vanrajavihara temple at Anahilapathaka (now Patan, Gujarat) as well as the construction of Kanteshwari-prasada by Vanraja. Kanteshwari was the petron goddess of later Chaulukya kings too. Kumarapala has prohibited the animal sacrifice at this temple. According to Haribhadra Suri (middle of 12th century), Minister Nihhaya's son Lahara had built the temple of Vindhyavasini (Laharadhanuhavi) at Sander in Patan district. He had also founded Narangpura town and built a Parshwanatha temple for merit of his mother. The extant temples this period (Early Nagara Phase) include the Roda Group of Temples, Lakodra in Vijapur Taluka, old temple at Thangadh, Ranakdevi Temple at Wadhwan, the Sun Temple at Kanthkot, Shiva temple at Puaranogadh at Manjal in Kutch. In popular culture Vanraj Chavdo (1881), a Gujarati novel written by Mahipatram Rupram Nilkanth, is based on the life of Vanraja Chavda.

He played principally for Slavia Prague in the Czech First League between its inception in 1993 and 2005, when he moved to England. ƒåern√Ω spent eight years in England with Tottenham Hotspur and Queens Park Rangers before returning to his former club Slavia in 2013, where he played one season before his retirement. ƒåern√Ω enjoyed a brief international career, making three appearances for the Czech Republic between 2000 and 2002. Club career =Slavia Prague= Born in Prague, Czechoslovakia, ƒåern√Ω turned professional in 1993 as a 17-year-old with Slavia Prague, his home team. His father was a goalkeeper, who started out as a youth at Slavia before playing in the Czech third and fourth divisions, while ƒåern√Ω's older brother Petr was another goalkeeper playing for the club. ƒåern√Ω did not get a chance to play for Slavia in the early years of his career, having been loaned out to three different Czech clubs and not returning until 1997, when he finally made his debut. Petr ƒåern√Ω was later signed as a deputy to his younger brother. ƒåern√Ω played for SK ƒåesk√© Budƒõjovice JƒåE in the first two seasons of the Gambrinus Liga and Union Cheb in the third before playing for Slavia's first team. He went on to make more than 150 appearances for Slavia, many of them in European competition. He was twice a domestic cup winner and scored one goal, the last goal in a 4-0 league victory against FK Jablonec 97 in the 1999-2000 season. =Tottenham Hotspur= ƒåern√Ω joined Spurs on an 18-month loan in January 2005, which was extended until the end of 2008 to replace Kasey Keller who, finding himself unable to win back the Spurs number one jersey from Paul Robinson, had signed for Borussia M√∂nchengladbach. Spurs had also signed M√°rton F√ºl√∂p, a young Hungarian goalkeeper, in the previous summer, but it was ƒåern√Ω who was called to deputise for Robinson for the last three games of the 2004/05 season. He made his debut at White Hart Lane against Aston Villa. Spurs won 5‚Äì1 but were unable to win a UEFA Cup spot that season. ƒåern√Ω played in the Peace Cup pre-season tournament in South Korea, which Spurs won, but once Robinson returned, ƒåern√Ω was back on the bench again. ƒåern√Ω did not make an appearance in the 2005/06 season as Spurs finished fifth. The 2006/07 season was more of the same for ƒåern√Ω, as Robinson, now the established number one for club and country, was initially playing in all of Spurs' matches, despite them playing in four competitions. F√ºl√∂p had left to join Sunderland and Robert Burch, a former youth team player, was being loaned out without starting for any of the clubs who employed him. Robinson was injured in March 2007 for the FA Cup quarter-final at Chelsea where ƒåern√Ω made his first competitive appearance for nearly two years in a memorable match that ended 3‚Äì3. Robinson returned for the replay, which Spurs lost 2‚Äì1. ƒåern√Ω was on the bench for the rest of the season as Spurs finished fifth again. The 2007/08 season began badly for Spurs, with Martin Jol leaving in November 2007 and Robinson under pressure after making a number of goalkeeping errors. New manager Juande Ramos eventually lost patience with Robinson's loss of form and for the first time in his Tottenham Hotspur career, ƒåern√Ω displaced Robinson, being preferred for the League Cup semi-final first-leg at Arsenal. However, Robinson again replaced ƒåern√Ω after a ƒåern√Ω goalkeeping error in the UEFA Cup against his former team threatened Tottenham's chances of winning in the round. =Queens Park Rangers= On 4 May 2008, ƒåern√Ω told Sky Sports News that he would be joining QPR of the Championship at the end of the season because of the lack of first team action at Spurs. The transfer was confirmed on 13 May. He made his debut in the QPR 2‚Äì1 victory over Barnsley at Loftus Road. After some uncertain displays at the start of the year, a string of fine performances enabled ƒåern√Ω to establish himself as the R's first-choice goalkeeper. He was left out of the 2012‚Äì13 QPR Premier League squad, losing out to fellow goalkeepers, J√∫lio C√©sar, Robert Green and Brian Murphy. =Return to Slavia Prague= Radek ƒåern√Ω spent the 2013‚Äì14 season at Slavia Prague before ending his professional career in 2014.

The primary focus is to study, replicate and compete with styles of rapier sword-fighting found in Europe during the Renaissance period, using blunted steel swords and a variety of off-hand defensive items. Participants wear period clothing while competing, along with or incorporating protective equipment (such as modern fencing masks) for safety. In the April 2020 update of the rules, the sport was renamed 'Fencing Combat'. History Since the founding day of the Society for Creative Anachronism (SCA), there was an interest in simulated combat sport with a \\"medieval style\\". The first \\"tournaments\\" were highly informal and used a mishmash of fencing equipment and wooden weapons. The first combat style among the SCA that evolved into a formal rule set from this was Armored Combat, which uses wooden, padded and rubber weapons along with specially made body armor unique to that style. As early as 1969, there were informal discussions about introducing \\"rapier and dagger\\" style combat as a society activity. Several early rule sets using sport fencing-like systems were experimented with in the 1970s, with rules and activities being adopted in several kingdoms. In 1979 the Society Board of Directors formally approved the activity and approved the first set of rules. Overall, the goal is distinct style within the organization focused more on the civilian dueling styles of the 14th, 15th and 16th century. Unlike the aforementioned armored combat, fencing in the SCA is closer to the modern sport fencing, using light body protection and flexible metal swords, though the rules are much less rigid. Since the time of its introduction, fencing has gained a significant following in the SCA, and having over one hundred competitors is not uncommon at larger event tournaments. The ultimate goal of SCA fencing as stated by the rules is to safely simulate fencing \\"with a real blade, extremely sharp on point and edge.\\" Equipment =Weapons= A wide variety of blades and sword styles are permitted, but all fall into one of two classes: \\"Light rapier\\" and \\"heavy rapier.\\" It is not permitted for the two classes of rapier to be used against each other; participants must all be using light or heavy. Light rapiers consist of commercially manufactured foil and √©p√©e, though the hilt and guard are sometimes replaced or altered to make them more closely resemble a historical sword. Heavy rapier are full-sized replicas of historical swords, with certain differences for safety reasons: The edges and tip must be blunt, with tips covered with a cap made of rubber, leather or plastic. Heavy rapier blades must pass a minimum flexibility test to be used. In addition to strictly \\"rapier\\" hilt types, other period swords are permitted so long as the blade meets the aforementioned safety criteria. These include side-swords, two-handed swords such as longswords, and single-edged swords including Gro√ües Messer, szablas, scimitars, and katanas. Besides a primary sword, combatants are permitted to use an additional item in their off-hand. These include a parrying dagger (or main gauche), a shield or buckler, a cloak or other flexible item, a cane, stick, or baton, or even a second sword (known as wielding \\"a case of rapiers\\"). Nearly any item is permitted so long as it is durable, has no sharp edges and is not likely or designed to trap an opponent's sword in an unsafe manner. An empty off-hand may be employed to parry as well, but is vulnerable to normal thrusts and cuts from the opponent's weapon. =Protective Gear= Since the entire body is a potential target, a participant's entire body must be covered. No bare skin may show, and all clothing must be at least durable enough to not snag open or tear from light abrasions. Certain areas of the body must have stronger protection. For example, the front of the head, the neck and the top of the spine must be protected by rigid items. A modern, regulation fencing mask is the most common type due to their low cost and reliability, though some fencers wear steel helmets of a more historical design. The neck and top vertebrae are protected by a gorget made of heavy leather and/or steel. The torso and armpits must be covered with a heavy fabric of some sort or leather, that is sufficiently strong to resist puncturing if a blade were to break during a bout. Men are required to wear a protective cup, and women are encouraged to wear chest protection. Fencers must also make an attempt to approximate medieval or Renaissance dress. Popular outfits tend to be based on 14th to 16th century European clothing, but participants are free to design their outfit after any pre-1600 culture normally acceptable with the SCA, including styles of the Middle East, China and Japan. It is a popular tradition in the SCA for female fencers to dress in male attire (similar to La Maupin), though this is by no means a requirement. Competitions and rules As fencing in the SCA is intended to be first and foremost fun, safety is the primary concern. All fencing practices and tournaments in the SCA are run by fencing \\"marshals\\" who are warranted to watch for unsafe behavior, inspect equipment, and \\"authorize\\" others to fence in tournaments (much like a referee). The \\"authorization\\" process includes a test of knowledge of fencing rules and bouts fought with previously authorized fencers under the marshal's supervision; the goal is not to prove the fencer's ability to win bouts, but his or her ability to participate safely and courteously in both tournaments and casual sparring. No fencers may compete in an SCA tournament until they have passed authorization, though they can participate in practice bouts until that time. Unlike modern fencing, SCA fencing has no restrictions or divisions based on gender. =List field= SCA fencing is conducted in an open space permitting sideways movement, rather than back and forth on a linear strip as in conventional sport fencing. The fencers may move freely within a designated fighting space called the \\"list field\\". These fields may be any size and are often outdoors. Bouts are observed by one or more marshals, who monitor the fencers for safety as well advising when a fencer is too close to the boundaries of the field. There is no penalty for accidentally bumping into or backing over a boundary; it most often results in the match being halted temporarily for the combatants to re-position. =Valid attacks= The entire body is considered a valid target, and there is no \\"priority\\" (right-of-way) rule, which is similar to sport √âp√©e. A valid blow is scored with either a thrust in line with the blade or a cut with the edge of the blade. In normal rapier rules, the edge may only be used for draw-cuts (placing the blade and pulling or pushing it on the opponent's body), while under \\"cut and thrust rapier\\" rules, percussive blows with the edge are also permitted. Only a sword or dagger may be used to strike an opponent. Participants cannot punch, kick, grab, body check or otherwise make physical contact with their opponent's body (beyond unintended fleeting contact), and may not strike an opponent with a shield, cloak, stick or any other parrying device. The scoring of a blow is based on an honor system; it is the responsibility of the fencer being hit to acknowledge a valid attack from the opponent. The fencer who is struck verbally acknowledges the blow by calling out in a loud voice, or in certain types of combat, dramatically acting out the hit for showmanship. No fencing directors, judges or electronic scoring systems are used. The fighting is overseen by a marshal who monitors the bout for safety and fair play from both participants, but is not permitted to judge the validity of an attack. However, the marshal has the ability to warn a fighter in cases where an obvious blow went unacknowledged, usually by politely asking if they are certain they were not struck. In extremely rare cases, the fighter's authorization to fence can be revoked. Bouts usually continue until one fighter is struck by an \\"incapacitating\\" blow or otherwise becomes disinclined to continue. A fighter may also yield (concede victory to the opponent) at any time during the bout. An \\"incapacitating\\" blow is defined as a valid attack to the head, neck, torso, armpit or inner groin area. Attacks to the legs or arms are considered \\"disabling\\". A hit to the arm disables that arm, which is held behind the fencer's back or hanging limply at their side. Fencers whose sword arm is disabled can switch hands. Some kingdoms use rules with additional details for strikes to the hand, which may simply disable the hand (represented by making a fist) or apply to the whole arm. For a strike to the leg or foot, the fencer can continue fighting but must kneel, sit on the ground, or balance on one leg. Under Cut and Thrust rules, hits to the leg or foot are considered incapacitating. Many kingdoms contain additional clarifications of these rules, such as only permitting sitting on the ground when the leg is hit, and/or limiting the permitted angle of approach for the opponent while seated (to avoid unsafe strikes to the back). Bouts can be one-on-one, or a \\"m√™l√©e\\" where more than two fencers are involved. Melees can involve teams of fencers that must work as a group, or an every-man-for-himself \\"grand m√™l√©e\\". One important matter of safety in a m√™l√©e is attacking an unaware fencer from behind. Normally this is not permitted unless it is announced before that particular match. When allowed, the attacking fencer must not slash or stab an opponent who doesn't know they are there, but rather must lay their blade on his or her shoulder so the tip is visible to the opponent and verbally tell them they have been \\"killed\\" in a loud voice. =Tournaments= SCA tournaments are usually conducted in rounds with winners of each round advancing towards the finals. Some common tournament formats are: * Single or double elimination * Swiss five * Passe de Armes * Scenarios (including group combat, terrain, obstacles, and more) =M√™l√©es= M√™l√©es between groups of fencers often take place at SCA events; these can be merely mock-brawls between disorganized \\"factions,\\" but sophisticated small unit tactics are often seen. At Pennsic or the Gulf War it is not unknown for more than two hundred fencers to take the field for a \\"battle\\". The SCA also allows simulations of period firearms to be used under certain conditions in fencing m√™l√©es. These simulations fire large \\"rubber bands\\" made of surgical tubing looped around and securely joined. \\"Wheel lock\\" pistols are most common, but muskets are not unknown. This ammunition has enough mass to allow the target to feel its impact through fencing armor, but is light enough to prevent injury. Some SCA fencers have even built light cannon firing as many as fourteen rubber bands at a single shot, thus simulating the effects of grape shot. Fencing titles and awards There are many different awards for fencing within the Society. =Interkingdom awards= * The Order of the Laurel - Some fencers have been elevated to the Order of the Laurel for research and historical fencing technique. * The Order of Defense - Created in 2015, the Order of Defense is a full Peerage-level award, equivalent to knighthood in the SCA, and is the highest honor a fencer can receive for rapier combat. Individuals receiving this award are allowed to wear a white livery collar and a heraldic badge consisting of three rapiers with crossed blades. * The Order of the White Scarf - The various Orders of the White Scarf are kingdom orders recognizing excellence in SCA fencing. These orders are almost all signatory to a treaty giving permission to any other kingdom to use the name \\"White Scarf\\", which is registered with the SCA College of Arms. The treaty also includes an agreement by the signatory kingdoms to treat visiting members of other White Scarf orders as they treat their own White Scarves. Many people mistakenly think of the collection of these orders as an interkingdom order. There are kingdom Orders of the White Scarf in 13 out of the 20 different kingdoms. More information is at: http://cunnan.sca.org.au/wiki/White_Scarf and at Moondragon Manor Online. =Kingdom awards= * The Order of the Golden Rapier is the East Kingdom order for excellence in rapier combat. * The Company of the Bronze Ring is the Midrealm order for fencing skill. * The Meridian Order of the Blade is the Meridies order for fencing skill. * The Order of the Queen's Blade is the Gleann Abhann order for fencing skill. * The Order of The Dragon's Steel is given in the Kingdom of Drachenwald to those who display superior abilities in light weaponry. It carries with it a grant of arms. Before creating a new member of the Order, the Crown must consult with the Order. * The Stile Fryd and Stile Huscarl are Calontir's awards for skill in cut and thrust. They carry an award or grant of arms, respectively. * Ordo Circini Vitruvii. After the creation of the Order of Defence, the Northshield Order of the White Scarf was closed and the grant-level Ordo Circini Vitruvii created. Historical fencing and the SCA Along with their practice of fencing, many SCA fencers also study period fencing manuals such as those by Ridolfo Capo Ferro, Giacomo di Grassi, Camillo Agrippa, and Carranza. While study and use of period technique is far from universal, with the increased popularity of accurate rapier simulators (as opposed to foils and √©p√©es) as well as Cut and Thrust rules, participants are able to apply a large variety of period techniques in competition as well as being able to study it in a collaborative, non- competitive setting. Criticism Some fencers argue that draw cuts are not martially sound techniques and make cutting a due tempi (\\"double time\\") action, whereas a percussive cutting action would be in stesso tempo (\\"single time\\"). A counter-argument to this is that the slender, light blade of the rapier is a poor \\"chopping\\" blade and in period was often not particularly sharp. A drawing cut was far more effective for inflicting a serious wound. With the addition of the Cut & Thrust style and rules, this criticism no longer applies.

Also known as the bristle-spined porcupine or thin-spined porcupine, it is the only member of the genus Chaetomys and the subfamily Chaetomyinae. It was officially described in 1818, but rarely sighted since, until December 1986, when two specimens - one a pregnant female - were found in the vicinity of Valencia in Bahia. Since then it has been recorded at several localities in eastern Brazil, from Sergipe to Esp√≠rito Santo (there are no recent records from Rio de Janeiro), but it remains rare and threatened due to habitat loss, poaching and roadkills.  Characteristics  Bristle-spined rats are named because the spines on the back are more bristle-like in texture than the spines on the rest of the body. They have long, naked tails which are not prehensile. Adult animals weigh around . Their skulls are unusual in several ways. The eye socket is almost completely surrounded by a ring of bone. Incisors are distinctly narrow. Overall, the animal displays a mix of New World porcupine cranial characters, spiny rat cranial characters, and characters that set it apart from all other rodents. The bristle-spined rat is restricted to remnant forests and forest edges in the Atlantic coastal forests on the east coast of Brazil. Its habitat is dwindling rapidly and the species may be vulnerable to extinction. It is classified as vulnerable by IUCN and endangered by USDI.Nowak, 1999  Taxonomic controversy  No consensus has been reached as to the taxonomic position of Chaetomys. It is commonly placed with the New World porcupines in the family Erethizontidae or with the spiny rats the family Echimyidae. Both are South American hystricognaths with hairs modified as spines or quills. Chaetomys has more highly developed spines than the spiny rats, but less developed than the porcupines. Characteristics of the premolar suggest that it belongs with the Echimyidae, but characteristics of the incisor enamel suggest that it belongs in the Erethizontidae. Patterson and Pascual (1968), Patterson and Wood (1982), Woods (1982, 1984, 1993) Patton and Reig (1989), Nowak (1999), and Carvalho (2000) support the inclusion of this animal in Echimyidae whereas Martin (1994), McKenna and Bell (1997), Carvalho and Salles (2004), and Woods and Kilpatrick (2005) argue that it belongs in Erethizontidae. Emmons (2005) mentions the family Chaetomyidae without much further comment except to exclude it from Echimyidae. A molecular phylogeny based on the mitochondrial gene coding for cytochrome b combined to karyological evidence actually suggests that Chaetomys is more closely related to the Erethizontidae than to the Echimyidae, although it branches as the sister group to the rest of the Erethizontidae.

Today Murano is known for its art glass, but it has a long history of innovations in glassmaking in addition to its artistic fame‚Äîand was Europe's major glassmaking center from the Middle Ages through the Renaissance. During the 15th century, Murano glassmakers created cristallo‚Äîwhich was almost transparent and considered the finest glass in the world. Murano glassmakers also developed a white-colored glass (milk glass called lattimo) that looked like porcelain. They later became Europe's finest makers of mirrors. Originally, Venice was controlled by the Byzantine Empire, but it eventually became an independent city state. It flourished as a trading center and seaport. Its connections with the Middle East helped its glassmakers gain additional skills, as glassmaking was more advanced in areas such as Syria and Egypt. Although Venetian glassmaking in factories existed as far back as the 8th Century, it became concentrated in Murano by law, beginning in 1291. Since glass factories often caught fire, this removed much of the possibility of a major fire disaster for the city. Venetian glassmakers developed secret recipes and methods for making glass, and the concentration of Venice's glassmaking on the island of Murano enabled better control of those secrets. Murano became Europe's elite glassmaking center, peaking in popularity in the 15th and 16th centuries. Venice's dominance in trade along the Mediterranean Sea created a wealthy merchant class that was a strong connoisseur of the arts. This helped establish demand for art glass and more innovations. The spread of glassmaking talent in Europe eventually diminished the importance of Venice and its Murano glassmakers. The occupation and dissolution of the Venetian state by Napoleon Bonaparte in 1797 caused more hardship for Murano's glassmaking industry. Murano glassmaking began a revival in the 1920s. Today, Murano and Venice are tourist attractions, and Murano is home to numerous glass factories and a few individual artists' studios. Its Museo del Vetro (Glass Museum) in the Palazzo Giustinian contains displays on the history of glassmaking as well as glass samples ranging from Egyptian times through the present day. Background alt= map of Venice, Murano, and Italy The Venetian city state grew during the decline of the Roman Empire as people fled barbarian invasions to the safety of islands in the Venetian Lagoon. Small communities grew in the lagoon, and Venice became the most prominent. The city of Venice became a highly successful trading port, and by the 11th century dominated trade between Europe, North Africa, and the Middle East. It also had a strong navy. Many European Crusaders passed through Venice on their way to and from the Holy Land. Treasures of many kinds were bought and sold in Venice: spices, precious metals, gemstones, ivory, silks‚Äîand glass. Successful trade bred a wealthy merchant class in addition to the nobles, and the wealthy became patrons of Venice's famous art and architecture. It is thought that glass production in Venice began around 450, as glassmakers from Aquileia fled to the islands to escape barbarian invaders. The earliest archaeological evidence of a glass factory in the area comes from the Venetian lagoon island of Torcello and dates from the 7th to 8th century. The original Venetian glassmakers were joined by glassmakers from Byzantium and from the Middle East‚Äîwhich enriched their glassmaking knowledge. Glass was made in the Middle East long before it was made in Europe, though Ancient Roman glass made in Italy, Germany and elsewhere could be extremely sophisticated. Early products included beads, glass for mosaics, jewelry, small mirrors, and window glass. Venetian glassmaking grew in importance to the city's economy. Around 1271 the local glassmakers' guild made rules to help preserve glassmaking secrets. It was forbidden to divulge trade secrets outside of Venice. If a glassworker left the city without permission, he would be ordered to return. If he failed to return, his family would be imprisoned. If he still did not return, an assassin would be sent to kill him. Additional rules specified ingredients used for making glass and the type of wood used as fuel for the furnaces. =Island of Murano= Doge visits Muranoalt= Dignitary visiting a glass factory in Murano A law dated November 8, 1291 confined most of Venice's glassmaking industry to the \\"island of Murano\\". Murano is actually a cluster of islands linked by short bridges, located less than north of the Venetian mainland in the Venetian lagoon. The furnaces used to make molten glass were a fire hazard, especially in cities with wooden structures nearby. Moving the glassmaking industry to Murano removed the threat of a disastrous fire in Venice. The move also kept the technology of glassmaking, and the glassmakers, confined to Murano. This prevented the spread of Venetian glassmaking expertise to potential competitors. Glassmakers were not allowed to leave the island without permission from the government. Leaving without permission, or revealing trade secrets, was punishable by death. Locating the industry on a single island also made it easier for the government to monitor imports and exports. Murano in the 1200s was a summer resort where the aristocrats of Venice built villas with orchards and gardens. It took about an hour to row a boat from Venice to Murano. Although the glassmakers could not leave the island, the nobles had no such constraints. Despite their travel restrictions, the glassmakers lived on a beautiful island, were under the direct rule of Venice's Council of Ten (the Venetian state-security committee), and had extra privileges. They did not work during the hot summer, during which furnace repair and maintenance was performed. During the 1300s, the annual summer vacation lasted five months. In the 1400s, the Venetian government shortened the summer vacation to three and a half months. Murano glassmakers sometimes complained they were not working enough. Glassmakers also enjoyed heightened social status. On December 22, 1376, it was announced that if a glassmaker's daughter married a nobleman, there was no forfeiture of social class, so their children were nobles. Major products and innovations Carafes containing aventurine glass thread Millefiori beadsCristallo stem glass Filigree style jar Enameled lattimo glass Bowl circa 1870s The Venetian glassmakers of Murano are known for many innovations and refinements to glassmaking. Among them are Murano beads, cristallo, lattimo, chandeliers, and mirrors. Additional refinements or creations are goldstone, multicolored glass (millefiori), and imitation gemstones made of glass. In addition to guarding their secret processes and glass recipes, Venetian/Murano glassmakers strived for beauty with their glass. =Aventurine= Aventurine glass, also known as goldstone glass, is translucent brownish with metallic (copper) specks. It was developed by Venetian glassmakers in the early 15th century. It is first cited in historical documents in 1626. The name aventurine is used because it was discovered accidentally. =Beads= Glass beads (a.k.a. Murano beads) were made by the Venetians beginning in the 1200s. The beads were used as rosary beads and jewelry. They were also popular in Africa. Christopher Columbus noted that the people of the New World (Native Americans) were \\"delighted\\" with the beads as gifts, and beads became popular with American Indians. =Calcedonio= Calcedonio is a marbled glass that looked like the semiprecious stone chalcedony. This type of glass was created during the 1400s by Angelo Barovier, who is considered Murano's greatest glassmaker. Barovier was an expert glassblower, revived enameling, and also worked with colored glass. His family had been involved with glassmaking since at least 1331, and the family continued in the business after his death. He died in 1460. =Chandeliers= During the 1700s, Giuseppe Briati was famous for his work with ornamented mirrors and chandeliers. Briati's chandelier style was called ciocche‚Äîliterally bouquet of flowers. Briati's typical chandelier was large with multiple arms decorated with garlands, flowers and leaves. One of the common uses of the huge Murano chandeliers was interior lighting for theatres and important rooms in palaces. Briati was born in Murano in 1686, and his family's business was glassmaking. He was allowed to work in a Bohemian glass factory, where he learned the secrets of working with Bohemian crystal‚Äîwhich was becoming more popular than Murano cristallo. In 1739, the Council of Ten allowed him to move his furnace from Murano to Venice because his work had caused such jealousy that he and his workers feared for their lives. (His father had been stabbed to death in 1701.) Briati retired in 1762, and his nephew became manager of the glass works. Briati died in Venice in 1772, and is buried in Murano. =Cristallo= Cristallo is a soda glass, created during the 15th century by Murano's Angelo Barovier. The oldest reference to cristallo is dated May 24, 1453. At the time, cristallo was considered Europe's clearest glass, and is one of the main reasons Murano became \\"the most important glass center\\". It looked like quartz, which was said to have magical qualities and often used in religious objects. Cristallo became very popular. This type of glass was fragile and difficult to cut, but it could be enameled and engraved. Manganese was a key ingredient in the secret formula used to make cristallo. An easy modification to cristallo made in Murano was to produce a frosted or crackle version. =Filigrana= The filigrana (a.k.a. filigree) style was developed in Murano in the 1500s. By embedding glass canes (usually white but not always) in colorless glass, the glassware has a striped appearance. Vetro a fili has straight white stripes, vetro a retortoli has twisted or spiral patterns, and vetro a reticello has two sets of lines twisted in opposite directions. Francesco Zeno has been mentioned as the inventor of vetro a retortoli. =Lattimo= Lattimo, or milk glass, began being made in Murano during the 15th century, and Angelo Barovier is credited with its re-discovery and development. This glass is opaque white, and was meant to resemble enameled porcelain. It was often decorated with enamel showing sacred scenes or views of Venice. =Millefiori= Millefiori glass is a variation of the murrine technique made from colored canes in clear glass, and is often arranged in flower-like patterns. The Italian word millefiori means thousand flowers. This technique was perfected in Alexandria, Egypt, and began being used in Murano in the 15th century. =Mirrors= Small mirrors were made in Murano beginning in the 1500s, and mirror makers had their own guild beginning in 1569. Murano mirrors were known for the artwork on the frame that held the mirror in addition to their quality. By the 1600s, Murano mirrors were in great demand. However, by the end of the century, English-made mirrors had the best quality. Only one glass house in Murano was still making mirrors by 1772. =Murrine= Murrine technique begins with the layering of colored liquid glass, heated to , which is then stretched into long rods called canes. When cooled, these canes are then sliced in cross-sections, which reveals the layered pattern. Ercole Barovier, a descendant of Murano's greatest glassmaker Angelo Barovier, won numerous awards during the 1940s and 1950s for his innovations using the murrine technique. =Sommerso= Sommerso (\\"submerged\\" in Italian), is a form of artistic Murano glass that has layers of contrasting colors (typically two), which are formed by dipping colored glass into another molten glass and then blowing the combination into a desired shape. The outermost layer, or casing, is often clear. Sommerso was developed in Murano during the late 1930s. Flavio Poli was known for using this technique, and it was made popular by Seguso Vetri d'Arte and the Mandruzzato family in the 1950s. This process is a popular technique for vases, and is sometimes used for sculptures. Golden age, decline, and revival Barovier enameled glass The 16th century was the golden age for Venetian glassmaking in Murano. Major trading partners included the Spanish Indies, Italy, Spain, Ottoman Turkey, and the German-speaking states. At least 28 glassmaking furnaces were in Murano in 1581. Numerous leaders and dignitaries visited Murano during this century, including the queen of France, dukes, princes, generals, cardinals, archbishops, and ambassadors. Collectors of Murano glass included Henry VIII of England, Pope Clement VII, King Ferdinand of Hungary, Francis I of France, and Phillip II of Spain. Eventually, the dominance of cristallo came to an end. In 1673, English glass merchant George Ravenscroft created a clear glass he called crystalline‚Äîbut it was not stable. Three years later, he improved this glass by adding lead oxide, and lead glass (a.k.a. crystal) was created. Ravenscroft, who had lived for many years in Venice, made lead crystal that was less breakable than cristallo. In 1674, Bohemian glassmaker Louis Le Vasseur made crystal that was similar to Ravenscroft's. In 1678, Johan Friedrich Kunkel von Lowenstein produced a cristallo-like glass in Potsdam. The Bohemian and Prussian-style glass was later modified by the addition of lime and chalk. This new glass is attributed to Bohemian glassmaker Michael M√ºller in 1683. The Bohemian glass was not suitable to the Murano-style artwork on the glass. However, this harder glass was produced as a thicker glass suitable for engraving and grinding. The Bohemian and English glass eventually became more popular than cristallo made in Murano. By the 1700s, Murano glass was traded mostly with Italian states and the Turkish empire. Small quantities were traded with England, Flanders, the Netherlands and Spain. Napoleon conquered Venice during May 1797, and the Venetian Republic came to an end. The fall of the Venetian Republic caused hard times for glassmaking in Murano, and some of the Murano methods became lost. Controlled by France and Austria, Venetian glassmaking became unprofitable because of tariffs and taxes‚Äîand glassmakers that survived were reduced to making mostly beads. Napoleon closed the Venetian glass factories in 1807, although simple glassware and beadmaking continued. In the 1830s, outsiders tried to revive the industry. However, it was not until Venice became part of Italy in 1866 that Murano glassmaking could experience a revival. Around that time, local leaders such as Abbot Vincenzo Zanetti (founder of the Murano Glass Museum), along with the Murano factory owners, began reinventing the earlier Murano techniques for making glass. Antonio Salviati, a Venetian lawyer who gave up his profession in 1859 in order to devote his time to glassmaking, also had an important role in the revival of glassmaking in Murano. Making glass From its beginning until the fall of the Venetian Republic, Murano glass was mostly a very high quality soda lime glass (using today's terminology) that had extra attention focused on its appearance. Glass from that time typically contained 65 to 70 percent silica. A flux, usually soda (sodium oxide as 10 to 20 percent of the glass composition) was added to enable the silica to melt at a lower temperature. A stabilizer, usually lime (calcium oxide as about 10 percent of the glass) was also added for durability and to prevent solubility in water. Small quantities of other ingredients were added to the glass, mostly to affect appearance. Sand is a common source for silica. For certain types of glass, the Murano glassmakers used quartz as their source for silica. Quartz pebbles were crushed into a fine powder. Two sources for sand were Creta and Sicily. Quartz pebbles were selected from the Ticino and Adige rivers in Northern Italy. Their source for soda was what they called allume catina‚Äîplant ash found in the eastern Mediterranean countries of the Middle East. Beginning in the 16th century, allume catina was also imported from Mediterranean coastal regions of Spain and France. The mixing and melting of the batch of ingredients was a two-stage process. First, nearly equal amounts of silica and flux were continuously stirred in a special furnace. The furnace was called a calchera furnace, and the mix was called fritta. In the second stage, the fritta was mixed with selected recycled waste glass (cullet) and melted in another furnace. Depending on the type and color of glass, other additives were used. Lead and tin were added for white opaque glass (latimo). Cobalt was used for blue glass. Copper and iron were used for green and for various shades of green, blue, and yellow. Manganese was used to remove colors. Although natural gas is the furnace fuel of choice for glassmaking today, the fuel mandated in Murano during the 13th century was alder and willow wood. During this second stage, the surface of the molten glass was skimmed to remove undesirable chemicals that affected the appearance of the glass. Additional techniques were used as glassmaking evolved. To improve clarity, molten glass was put in water and then re-melted. Another technique was to purify the flux by boiling and filtering. =Tools= The Venetian glassmakers had a set of tools that changed little for hundreds of years. A ferro sbuso, also called a canna da soffio, is the blowpipe essential for extracting molten glass and beginning the shaping process. A borselle is a tong-like tool of various sizes used to shape glass that has not hardened. A borselle puntata is a similar tool, only it has a pattern that can be imprinted on the glass. A pontello is an iron rod that holds the glass while work is done on the edge of the glass. A tagianti is a large scissors used to cut glass before it has hardened. A scagno is the workbench used by the glassmaker. \\"Good tools are nice, but good hands are better,\\" is an old Murano saying that reinforces the idea that the glassmakers of Murano rely on their skills instead of any advantage caused by special tools. Today Some of Venice's historical glass factories in Murano remain well known brands today, including De Biasi, Gabbiani, Venini, Salviati, Barovier & Toso, Pauly, Berengo Studio, Seguso, Formia International, Simone Cenedese, Alessandro Mandruzzato, Vetreria Ducale, Estevan Rossetto 1950 and others. The oldest glass factory is Antica Vetreria Fratelli Toso, founded in 1854. Overall, the industry has been shrinking as demand has waned. Imitation works (recognizable by experts but not by the typical tourist) from Asia and Eastern Europe take an estimated 40 to 45 percent of the market for Murano glass, and public tastes have changed while the designs in Murano have largely stayed the same. To fight the imitation problem, a group of companies and concerned individuals created a trademark in 1994 that certifies that the product was made on Murano. By 2012, about 50 companies were using the Artistic Glass Murano¬Æ trademark of origin. Glassmaking is a difficult and uncomfortable profession, as glassmakers must work with a product heated to extremely high temperatures. Unlike 500 years ago, children of glassmakers do not enjoy any special privileges, extra wealth, or marriage into nobility. Today, it is difficult to recruit young glassmakers. Foreign imitations, and difficulty attracting young workers, caused the number of professional glassmakers in Murano to decrease from about 6,000 in 1990 to fewer than 1,000 by 2012.

As a result of this, another 'signal' photon is produced, with the surplus energy resonantly passed to the vibrational states of the medium. This process, as with other stimulated emission processes, allows all- optical amplification. Optical fiber is today mostly used as the nonlinear medium for SRS, for telecom purposes; in this case it is characterized by a resonance frequency downshift of ~11 THz (corresponding to a wavelength shift at ~1550 nm of ~90 nm). The SRS amplification process can be readily cascaded, thus accessing essentially any wavelength in the fiber low-loss guiding windows (both 1310 and 1550). In addition to applications in nonlinear and ultrafast optics, Raman amplification is used in optical telecommunications, allowing all-band wavelength coverage and in-line distributed signal amplification.

The organisation was part of the \\"no\\" campaign in the 1999 republic referendum, which asked whether Australia should become a republic and whether Australia should alter the constitution to insert a preamble. Neither of the amendments passed. Structure The Australian Monarchist League is incorporated as an association in New South Wales, and was founded as a branch of the London-based International Monarchist League (IML). However, in 1993, the League severed affiliation with the IML, and established itself as an independent Australian body. (A separate organisation, the Monarchist League in Australia, was formed in 2006 as an affiliate of the IML). The organisation is not formally associated with any political party or other organisation, and it has no paid staff, relying on volunteers to keep the group functioning. Philip Benwell has served on a volunteer basis as the national chairman and spokesman for the league for over ten years. In 1978, Benwell was charged with fraudulent misappropriation and obtaining money under false pretences. He fled to Sri Lanka, where his family owned tea plantations. He was eventually extradited back to Australia in 1987, after a period of imprisonment at Welikada Prison, but was never prosecuted for the earlier charges. The League has established a Trust with a number of prominent Australian businessmen as Trustees. The most important role of the Trust is to raise and administer funds for the organisation's activities. Activities = 1999 republic referendum = During the 1999 republic referendum on the future of Australia's constitutional monarchy, the league along with the four other constitutional monarchist groups formed a united front led by Lloyd Waddy emphasising the weaknesses of the republican models on offer. Positions on the official Vote No Committee were filled according to votes received at the Convention election. Accordingly, all eight monarchist seats went to an alternative organization which had won 73.39% of the monarchist vote, Australians for Constitutional Monarchy (along with two supporting an elected head of state). Nevertheless, the Australian Monarchist League played a role in the proceedings, including Benwell privately taking the Australian Electoral Commission to the Federal Court in an unsuccessful attempt to gain a firmer definition of what would count as a \\"yes\\" vote in the referendum, arguing that the planned approach (accepting any vote in which the voter's intention was clear) was such that the counting would be weighted towards \\"yes\\" and \\"opened the door for electoral fraud\\". = Recent activities = Both prior and subsequent to the referendum, the Australian Monarchist League has acted to protect the image of the constitutional monarchy. In 2005 the organisation lodged formal complaints about an image depicting Princess Diana by photographer Erwin Olaf at the Australian Centre for Photography. Similarly, they wrote to the Japanese ambassador in 1998 after Toyota ran an advertisement showing a Range Rover with the words \\"Don't worry, Your Majesty, you're not the only British export that's had its day\\", resulting in Toyota withdrawing the advertisement; and in 2008 complained to both the Coopers Brewery and the Advertising Standards Bureau after Coopers ran an advertisement stating \\"Forget the monarchy, support the publicans\\", forcing its withdrawal.Monarchists upset by beer ad, ABC, 28 July 2008 Along with their actions during the referendum, the League have been active in protecting the symbols of Australia's constitutional monarchy; they acted to ensure that the pledge of loyalty to the monarch remained a part of Scouts Australia, and spoke against the removal of references to the Queen from the Victorian legal system. Aside from campaigning, the AML distributed copies of William Dargie's portrait of Queen Elizabeth II after the Commonwealth Government Bookshops ceased selling photographs of the monarch. Other activities include disseminating literature and maintaining a library on Australian history and the Australian Constitution, and conducting public seminars. Membership The League has approximately 3000 members as of 2008, with branches in each State and in the Australian Capital Territory. All office bearers are elected by the membership and serve on a voluntary basis.

It was also home to Headquarters, V Corps and Headquarters, Allied Force Command Heidelberg. History As part of the Nazi military buildup, the German 110th Infantry Regiment was activated in May 1936 and stationed in Heidelberg. The existing Grenadier-Kaserne (now Patton Barracks) was not large enough for the regiment. Accordingly, a new installation was built in 1937 on what was then farmland on the southern outskirts of Heidelberg near the suburb of Rohrbach. At first unnamed, the new installation was designated Gro√üdeutschland-Kaserne after Austria became part of the German Empire in March 1938. Stories linking Gro√üdeutschland-Kaserne to the Gro√üdeutschland Division of World War II have no foundation. The casern predates the division, which was not formed until May 1942. Neither the division nor any of its subordinate units were ever stationed in Heidelberg, nor was the 110th Infantry Regiment ever attached to the Gro√üdeutschland-Division. When completed, the new Heidelberg barracks became the home of the 110th Infantry's headquarters, its 1st Battalion and its two regimental support companies. The regiment's 2d Battalion was stationed at Loretto-Kaserne (now called Hammonds Barracks) in Seckenheim and the 3d Battalion at Grenadier-Kaserne. The Keyes Building on Campbell originally served as the regimental officers mess. The first Allied troops entered Heidelberg on the morning of Good Friday, March 30, 1945, and the city surrendered without a fight. The Wehrmacht had left Heidelberg a day earlier but not before blowing up the bridges crossing the River Neckar, which in Heidelberg meant blowing up the old bridge. The U.S. units that initially occupied Gro√üdeutschland-Kaserne are not known, but by V-E Day, 8 May 1945, the headquarters of the U.S. 6th Army Group occupied the Kaserne. The Army Group headquarters was inactivated in June 1945, whereupon the headquarters of the U.S. Seventh Army moved from Augsburg to Heidelberg, officially opening at Gro√üdeutschland-Kaserne on July 22, 1945. The Seventh Army headquarters remained in Heidelberg until its inactivation on 31 March 1946. The headquarters of the U.S. Third Army then moved from Bad T√∂lz to Gro√üdeutschland-Kaserne on 2 April 1946. In the meantime the Third Army had activated a new organization on 15 February 1946 called the U.S. Constabulary. The Constabulary was basically a police force with the mission of maintaining law and order in the U.S. Zone of occupied Germany. On February 15, 1947, the Constabulary headquarters moved from Bamberg to Gro√üdeutschland-Kaserne and the Third Army headquarters was inactivated on March 15, 1947. During this time the headquarters of the U.S. Army in Europe, then known as the U.S. Forces, European Theater (USFET), was stationed in Frankfurt in the IG Farben Building (the Abrams Building). The same day Third Army headquarters was inactivated, USFET was redesignated as the European Command (EUCOM), not to be confused with the joint United States European Command (USEUCOM) of today. In the series of phased moves between February and June 1948, the Constabulary headquarters moved from Heidelberg to Stuttgart and the EUCOM headquarters moved into the vacated facilities at Gro√üdeutschland-Kaserne. The Kaserne was formally renamed Campbell Barracks on August 23, 1948 in memory of Staff Sergeant Charles L. Campbell, 14th Infantry Regiment, 71st Infantry Division, who was awarded the Distinguished Service Cross posthumously for extraordinary heroism. On March 28, 1945, two days before the surrender of Heidelberg, Staff Sergeant Campbell led a patrol across the Rhine River near Mannheim and was killed while covering the withdrawal of his patrol as it returned to the west bank with valuable information. Until July 1949, the Commander in Chief, EUCOM, was also the U.S. Military Governor of occupied Germany. His office and staff were in Berlin. The ranking officer in Heidelberg was the EUCOM Chief of Staff. While Lieutenant General Clarence R. Huebner was the EUCOM Chief of Staff, the riding hall in building 31 was converted to a (unknown name), which opened on March 4, 1949. =Joint Headquarters= The next significant organizational change came on August 1, 1952 when a new joint headquarters, the United States European Command (USEUCOM), was activated in Frankfurt. At the same time, the EUCOM headquarters in Heidelberg was redesignated the United States Army, Europe (USAREUR). A small NATO planning cell called the CENTAG Plans Staff was also established at this time within the USAREUR headquarters staff, with the Commander in Chief, USAREUR, given the additional title of Commander, CENTAG (COMCENTAG). In April 1959, the CENTAG Plans Staff was designated Headquarters, CENTAG, and separated from the USAREUR headquarters staff. The USAREUR G3 (as the Deputy Chief of Staff, Operations, was then known) nevertheless continued to serve as the CENTAG Chief of Staff while serving as the USAREUR G3. The Supreme Allied Commander, Europe (SACEUR), formally activated a separated CENTAG headquarters on 1 October 1960. Between June and August 1961 the CENTAG headquarters staff moved from Campbell Barracks to Hammond Barracks in Seckenheim. On December 1, 1966, the Seventh Army headquarters (which had been reactivated in Stuttgart in November 1950) merged with the USAREUR headquarters. This new headquarters was designated Headquarters, United States Army, Europe, and Seventh Army (HQ USAREUR/7A). In the late 1970s, a series of studies concluded that interallied coordination would be improved by stationing three international NATO headquarters on the same installation with HQ USAREUR/7A. This resulted in the headquarters of the Fourth Allied Tactical Air Force (4ATAF) moving into building 8 of Campbell Barracks in September 1980. The CENTAG headquarters returned to Campbell Barracks in December 1980, occupying offices in buildings 3,5, and 7 (with an office for the CENTAG Chief of Staff in building 1). Finally, the headquarters of the Allied Command Europe Mobile Force (Land) moved to Campbell Barracks in December 1980, occupying part of building 7. =Post Cold War= In the late 1980s and early 1990s, the collapse of the Berlin Wall, the demise of the Soviet Union, and the dissolution of the East European Communist Bloc radically changed the politico-military situation in Europe. In addition to significant reductions and realignments of U.S. Forces in Germany, a number of changes occurred in the NATO military organizational structure, all of which affected stationing at Campbell Barracks. On 30 June 1993 CENTAG and 4ATAF discontinued operations. On July 1, 1993, the headquarters of NATO's Allied Land Forces Central Europe (LANDCENT) became operational on Campbell Barracks with a staff from seven nations (Belgium, Canada, Denmark, Germany, The Netherlands, the United Kingdom, and the United States). LANDCENT moved into offices in buildings 3,7, and 8, formerly used by CENTAG and 4ATAF. The CENTAG Chief of Staff office suite in building 1 was returned to USAREUR. In the summer of 1994, V Corps headquarters moved from Frankfurt to Campbell Barracks. The departure from the Cold War era brought the implementation of a new NATO Integrated Military Structure and LandCENT was formally designated Joint Headquarters Centre (JHQ CENT) in a ceremony held on March 9, 2000. The new structure, which accompanied this designation, included personnel from five additional nations: the Czech Republic, Hungary, Italy, Norway, and Poland - making a total of 12 NATO Nations contributing to the Headquarters. The devastation caused in the September 11, 2001 attacks sent shock waves through the military and on April 30, 2002 the Lieutenant General Timothy J. Maude Center for Human Resources was dedicated to Timothy Maude (November 18, 1947 - September 11, 2001) in his honor. He was the highest-ranking military officer killed in the attacks at the Pentagon. He worked on Campbell Barracks from 1995 to 1998 as Deputy Chief of Staff for Personnel and Installation Management. It was his last assignment before being stationed in Washington D.C. On July 1, 2004, the Headquarters once again transitioned in a ceremony marking its designation to Component Command-Land Headquarters, Heidelberg. New structure is currently represented by 15 NATO nations, including its newest members Lithuania and Slovakia. This transformation to CC-Land HQ HD was part of a major NATO restructuring, and realized a fundamental change in headquarters mission and operations, as this headquarters turns its focus from one of six joint sub-regional command headquarters, to assume roles as one of only two land centric headquarters in the NATO command structure designed to provide expeditionary command and control at the operational level of conflict. With this increased operational focus, there remains the critical element of promoting enhanced interoperability and standardization through provisions of land advice and guidance within Allied Command for Operations. Headquarters will also work closely with Allied Command for Transformation on aspects such as land concept development, exercises and training. Within JFC Brunssum, headquarters serves as the principal focus for all land matters. CC-Land HQ HD has conducted work in the fields of land-based operational planning, intelligence, logistics, command and control, training and exercises. Closure In 2010, the US Army announced that Campbell Barracks would close, with the troop drawdown process completed by no later than 2015. NATO central army operations were relocated to Izmir, Turkey in March 2013. Flags were lowered for the last time at Campbell Barracks on 6 September 2013, with all personnel already re-located to Wiesbaden Army Airfield. According to the New York Times closure will save the Pentagon $112 million a year, mostly in costly security expenses for several scattered facilities. As the headquarters of the United States Army in Europe, the Barracks issued the orders for the millions of American soldiers ‚Äì 15 million in Germany alone ‚Äì who have served in Europe since 1945. The US Army is now concentrated in just five key locations in Germany, with its new European headquarters in Wiesbaden. The base will be turned over to the German government.

By 2002 the line-up was Cesium 137 (aka Mark Bevan) on lead vocals, Diazanon (Dave Haley) on drums, Ethion (Erik Miehs) on guitar, Endrin (Nathan Jenkins) on bass guitar and Chlordane (Timothy Pope) on keyboards. In 2009 the line-up had Miehs and Pope joined by Cain Cressall on vocals, Dan Quinlan on bass guitar and Robin Stone on drums. The group has issued three studio albums, Occasus (2004), n0n (2008), and Flesh Is Heir (2013). History The Amenta originally formed in Baulkam Hills, a Sydney suburb, in 1997 as Crucible of Agony. They initially played black metal and released two demos in 1999 under that name. They were renamed as The Amenta in 2001 and, the following year, self-released their first extended play, Mictlan. The line-up was Cessium 137 (aka Mark Bevan, lead vocals), Scott Howard (drums), Ethion (Erik Miehs, guitar), Ben Symons (guitar) Endrin (Nathan Jenkins, bass guitar) and Chlordane (Timothy Pope, keyboards). Howard was soon replaced by Diazanon (Dave Haley) on drums. In 2003 they signed with Listenable Records and followed with their debut studio album, Occasus. It was acclaimed by rock magazine, Kerrang!, where they were awarded Best Metal Newcomers for 2004. Occasus had Allmusic's Eduardo Rivadavia describe their sound as \\"a barrage of speed-riffs, crushed throat shouting, and what may or may not be programmed drums ... that recall the similarly claustrophobic crush\\" of bands such as Zyklon and Cryptopsy. In May 2006 the band replaced Bevan with Jarrod Krafczyk on vocals. They played several tours, including an appearance at the 2007 Festival of the Dead followed by a national tour of the United Kingdom with Akercocke and The Berzerker. Also that year, they supported Polish blackened death metal band Behemoth on their tour of Australia, and released the Virus DVD as a bonus disc with the limited re-release of Occasus/Mictlan. In October 2008 The Amenta issued their second album, n0n. It features guest appearances from Jason Mendonca of Akercocke, Nergal of Behemoth, Alice Daquet of Sir Alice, and Alex Pope of Ruins. The album was described by Alex Boniwell in the magazine, Terrorizer, as \\"industrial metal for people who 'actually' like both industrial and metal\\". Cosmo Lee of Allmusic, found the album was \\"futuristic yet anachronistic. Its fizzy synths, brooding soundscapes, and micro-level editing employ state-of-the-art computing. But the approach is nothing new. Whenever machines and metal intertwine this tightly, the ghost of '90s industrial metal looms large\\". The Amenta toured Europe in January 2009 with Deicide. They returned to Australia and commenced a national tour with The Berzerker, which ran from late January 2009 to late March with a tour of New Zealand. The Amenta were scheduled to perform at the Rockout Festival 2009 featuring acts such as Twisted Sister, Girlschool, and Rose Tattoo, however it was postponed and ultimately cancelled. The group embarked on their first North American tour in November‚ÄìDecember 2009 with Vader, Decrepit Birth, Warbringer, Augury and Success Will Write Apocalypse Across the Sky. They supported Behemoth and Job for a Cowboy for the 2010 Australian tour. In 2011, The band released an online EP, V01D which was the band's first recordings with new vocalist Cain Cressall. It featured re-recordings of old tracks, remixes, a cover version, and a brand new song. The group embarked on an Australian tour with Ruins in March and April.

Construction and commissioning Patterson was laid down 23 July 1935 by the Puget Sound Navy Yard, Bremerton, Washington; launched 6 May 1937; sponsored by Miss Elizabeth P. Patterson; and commissioned 22 September 1937, Commander Francis T. Spellman in command. Service history =Pre-war= Patterson departed Puget Sound Navy Yard 26 November 1937, calling at San Francisco en route to Pearl Harbor, arriving 7 December. She returned to Puget Sound 22 December, trained in coastal waters until 31 March 1938, then cruised to Hawaii. She arrived at San Pedro from Hawaii 28 April for operations along the western seaboard and combined fleet maneuvers that once took her through the Panama Canal and into the Caribbean Sea. On 3 June 1940 she set course to patrol in the Hawaiian Sea Frontier area from Pearl Harbor to Midway and Palmyra. This duty continued for the next 18 months except for periods on the west coast for overhaul and training. =World War II= Pearl Harbor Patterson was moored at Pearl Harbor when the Japanese carrier-based planes attacked on 7 December 1941. Her gunners sped to battle stations, opened fire, and blasted one Japanese plane out of the sky. Within an hour, the destroyermen were searching for possible Japanese submarines off the harbor entrance. Patterson patrolled the Hawaiian Sea Frontier in the screen of aircraft carrier Saratoga without finding trace of the Japanese. On 28 December, returning from patrol, she rescued 19 survivors of merchant ship Marimi adrift for several days after having been torpedoed by a Japanese submarine. 1942 In the following weeks, her duties included convoy of reinforcements for the garrison on Canton Island, Phoenix Group, and hasty voyage repairs at Pearl Harbor. She departed 5 February 1942 bound in the screen of cruiser Pensacola for rendezvous with the Lexington carrier task group in the southwest Pacific. She rescued a Lexington pilot as air strikes were launched on the Japanese stronghold at Rabaul, New Britain, 20 February. The carriers rained devastation on the Japanese bases at Lae and Salamaua, New Guinea, 10 March, then proceeded to Pearl Harbor. Patterson sailed from Pearl Harbor 7 April for overhaul in the Mare Island Naval Shipyard. She returned to Pearl Harbor 17 May and was underway five days later, en route by way of Noumea, New Caledonia, to join Admiral Richmond K. Turner‚Äôs Expeditionary Task Force preparing in Australia for the invasion of the Solomons. On 22 June she got underway from Brisbane for final staging and amphibious warfare rehearsals in the Fiji Islands, then set course in the screen of attack transports carrying Marines to the Solomon Islands. =Guadalcanal= Patterson helped guard attack transports 7 August as they landed Marines on Guadalcanal, later opening fire to help repel more than twenty attacking horizontal bombers. Several enemy planes fell in flames. Then Japanese torpedo planes came in and hit destroyer . On 8 August Patterson gunners shot down four enemy torpedo planes while protecting the transports, but destroyer was damaged and transport was lost. As Patterson fought off aerial raiders, seven enemy cruisers and a destroyer raced down the slot of water formed by the Solomon Islands Chain and stretching southward from the Japanese base at Rabaul. By midnight of 8 August, the Japanese task force was only from Savo Island, having been undetected since early morning. =Battle of Savo Island= Patterson at sea Patterson was south of Savo Island and Florida Island, with a US-Australian group of three heavy cruisers and two destroyers. To their north were the heavy cruisers , USS Vincennes, USS Quincy and two destroyers. Driving rain slashed the waters between the northern force and ships of the southern force. The Japanese task force slipped past two picket destroyers, entered Savo Sound, and ran head-on into Patterson, whose patrol task group included the Allied southern group, composed of the heavy cruiser HMAS Canberra and USS Chicago, and the destroyer Bagley. At 0143, 9 August, Patterson radioed the alarm: \\"Warning! Warning! Strange ships entering the harbor!\\" But Japanese cruisers had already launched torpedoes and opened gunfire, disabling Canberra. Patterson repeated her warning by blinker and opened up her guns. She received a 5-inch return salvo from the enemy that knocked out her Number 4 gun, killed 10 men, injured eight others, and damaged the deck and the Number 3 gun. Patterson‚Äôs gunners continued shooting until the enemy, flinging torpedoes, split formation, and raced northeast in a pincer movement on the northern force of three cruisers. Cruisers Vincennes, Astoria and Quincy were lost. The Japanese now sped northward for return to Rabaul, New Britain, catching destroyer Ralph Talbot in her path. Ralph Talbot fought off the attack until she took cover in a rain-squall. The Japanese suffered only minor damage to four warships in the Battle of Savo Island that cost the Allies four cruisers, and severely damaged cruiser Chicago and destroyer Ralph Talbot. Patterson assisted HMAS Canberra and took part in rescue work before proceeding to Noum√©a, New Caledonia, arriving 14 August. Patterson immediately put to sea with the Saratoga carrier task group to help guard the approaches to Guadalcanal, until a Japanese submarine damaged Saratoga, and she returned to Pearl Harbor. Patterson helped guard HMAS Australia to Brisbane, arriving 3 September. She performed patrol and escort duty off the Great Barrier Reef with an Australian-American force of cruisers and destroyers. 1943 She rescued 19 survivors of the torpedoed SS Fingal 5 May 1943, then escorted merchantman SS Pennant to Noum√©a, New Caledonia, She arrived 13 May to patrol approaches to Guadalcanal in the screen of carriers Saratoga and . This duty was followed by innumerable convoy escort and patrol missions ranging from Guadalcanal south to Australian ports, and to the South Pacific island bases in the New Hebrides Islands and Noum√©a, New Caledonia. The morning of 25 July, she joined four other destroyers in bombarding Lambeti Plantation, near the Munda air strip on New Georgia Island. The evening of 25 August Patterson was helping guard a convoy bound from the New Hebrides Islands toward the lower Solomons. A warning pip on her radar screen brought her into action against a diving Japanese submarine. Her sonar picked up the underwater enemy, and depth charge patterns exploded in the sea. Patterson sent her last depth charge barrage on its way, and five minutes later she was rewarded by a deep underseas boom, presumably silencing the enemy. This differs from other sources which state that the I-25 was sunk less than a year later by one or more of the destroyers , USS Patterson, which were involved in the naval engagement on 3 September 1943 off the New Hebrides islands approximately northeast of Espiritu Santo. Which American ship sank the I-25 remains unknown. Patterson next escorted troop transports from Noum√©a, New Caledonia, to the New Hebrides, patrolled off Guadalcanal out of Purvis Bay, Florida, Solomon Islands. The night of 24 September she helped guard an amphibious landing convoy to Vella Lavella Island, then departed to escort high-speed transports to Rendova Island. She soon turned back to Vella Lavella Island at full speed, having received word that unloading tank landing craft there were under enemy air attack. The attack had ceased by the time she reached the scene, but she launched motor whaleboats with medical and rescue parties to aid the wounded. The night of 29/30 September Patterson proceeded up the slot to destroy enemy barge traffic. Destroyer McCalla, after ripping into radar contacts with gunfire, attempted to rejoin the destroyer task unit formation, but suffered a steering casualty and unavoidably collided into the port bow of Patterson. Three men in Patterson were killed and ten injured by the force of the collision that almost severed Patterson‚Äôs bow. The broken section parted as she slowly proceeded towards base, breaking off just forward of gun mount No. 1. Both ships entered Purvis Bay for emergency repairs, thence to Espiritu Santo, New Hebrides Islands, where Patterson received a false bow. On 3 December she put to sea, touching the Samoan and Hawaiian Islands en route to the Mare Island Naval Shipyard, arriving 22 December. Coincidentally, the commander of the USS McCalla was LCDR Halford A. Knoertzer (Annapolis ‚Äô32), who was the first lieutenant on the USS Patterson when she was commissioned in 1937. 1944 Patterson stood out of San Francisco Bay 8 March 1944 with a convoy that entered Pearl Harbor 15 March. Training with fast attack carriers in Hawaiian waters was followed by similar battle rehearsals out of Marshall Island ports in preparation for the Marianas Campaign. On 6 June Patterson departed Majuro Atoll en route to Saipan with the Bunker Hill Carrier Task Group. She joined in the preinvasion bombardment of Saipan, then guarded troop transports sending in assault troops for the initial invasion of Saipan 15 June. On approach of the Japanese Mobile Fleet, she became a unit of the anti-aircraft screen around the Fast Carrier Task Force whose pilots shot down hundreds of Japanese carrier-based planes, in a series of actions known as the ‚ÄúGreat Marianas Turkey Shoot,‚Äù before they could reach the American Fleet. The few enemy planes that managed to get past the American carrier pilots met curtains of anti-aircraft fire from Patterson and her sister ships. The destroyer helped guard American attack carriers through 21 June as they pursued the fleeing Japanese fleet, decisively defeated in the Battle of the Philippine Sea, then turned back to help protect the approaches to Saipan. She provided night illumination fire for advancing troops on Saipan, then bombarded enemy targets on nearby Tinian Island. Bombardment support and anti-submarine patrol continued off Saipan and Tinian until 9 August. Patterson then called briefly at Apra Harbor, Guam, en route to Eniwetok Atoll in the Marshalls. There, she joined the screen of fast carriers that struck hard at enemy bases on Iwo Jima and in the Western Caroline Islands. She participated in the bombardment of Yap Island 8 September. From there she proceeded to the Palau Islands to guard fast carriers giving direct support to the landing troops there until 9 October. After replenishment at Manus, Admiralty Islands, Patterson made a high-speed run with attack carriers to blast enemy defenses on Okinawa and the entire Kerama Retto chain. From there the fast carrier task forces approached the Philippines to rain destruction on enemy air installations in Northern Luzon, thence proceeded to the coast of Formosa for air strikes launched 12 October. That evening and through the following day, Patterson helped fight off and destroy enemy aerial raiders that approached her carrier task group. From Formosa, the carriers sped back to Luzon where Patterson helped drive off attacking enemy dive bombers that made a near miss on carrier Franklin. On 20 October her carrier task group gave direct air support to troops landing at Leyte to begin the liberation of the Philippine Islands. As the Japanese Fleet approached the Philippines in a three-pronged attack, 24‚Äì25 October, her carrier task force hit hard at the Japanese Southern Force of battleships, cruisers, and destroyers, struck at the even more powerful Japanese Central Force aiming at the Central Philippines, then raced north to destroy the Japanese decoy carrier task force in the Battle off Cape Enganno, 25 October. She joined in the pursuit of enemy fleet units fleeing the Battle for Leyte Gulf, then helped fight off the suicide attacks of Japanese kamikaze aircraft 30 October. She rescued men blown into the water from the damaged carriers Franklin and Belleau Wood, escorting the damaged carriers safely to Ulithi in the Caroline Islands, arriving 3 November. Patterson helped protect attack carriers providing air cover to convoys approaching the Philippines until 9 December. She then proceeded independently to Kossol Roads, Palau Islands. There, she joined the screen of an escort carrier-bombardment task group that sailed 10 December to provide heavy gunfire support and air cover for the initial landings on Mindoro Island. For seven days the destroyer remained in the Sulu Sea, fighting off frequent suicide attacks of enemy aerial raiders that closed her carrier task group formation. There was a brief replenishment at Palau before Patterson again sailed with escort aircraft carriers, this time to support the invasion landings at Lingayen Gulf, Luzon, Philippines. 1945 She rescued survivors of the kamikaze-damaged escort carrier Ommaney Bay 4 January 1945, and survivors of destroyer Stafford and escort carrier Manila Bay the following day. She shot down a suicide plane diving on carrier Salamaua 13 January, remaining on guard for carriers in support of the Lingayen Gulf invasion landings until the 17th. She then proceeded to Ulithi in the Carolines to prepare for the impending invasion of Iwo Jima. Patterson departed Ulithi 10 February for final battle rehearsals and staging in the Marianas, thence in the screen of escort carriers covering the amphibious expeditionary troops for the landings on Iwo Jima, 19 February. She rescued 106 survivors of the escort carrier Bismarck Sea, sunk by enemy torpedo plane attacks off Iwo Jima 21 February. The fighting destroyer remained off Iwo Jima with escort carriers until 10 March, then set course for Ulithi to prepare for the capture and occupation of Okinawa, the ‚Äúlast stepping stone‚Äù to Japan. Patterson sailed from Ulithi the morning of 21 March, en route with a support unit of seven escort aircraft carriers that gave direct cover to troops storming ashore at Okinawa 1 April. She shot down an enemy suicide plane that attacked escort carrier Lunga Point 2 April and continued to guard the escort carriers as they pounded enemy troop concentrations and installations through 29 April. When her sonar gear became inoperative 29 April, she set course for repairs at Apra Harbor, Guam. She put to sea from Apra Harbor 4 June, escorting battleship New Mexico as far as Leyte in the Philippines, There she joined a troop and supply reinforcement convoy bound to Kerama Retto. By 12 June she had rejoined the escort carriers giving direct support to troops until the bitter contest for Okinawa was won. Patterson returned to Leyte for repairs then headed for Saipan, Mariana Islands. This was her base for escort- patrol missions reaching to Okinawa, Guam, and towards the Marshalls until the close of hostilities with Japan. =Post-war= On 16 August she departed Saipan as escort for battleship New Jersey bound to Manila, thence to Buckner Bay, Okinawa. She departed Buckner Bay 8 September, touching Saipan, Eniwetok, and Pearl Harbor, en route to San Diego, California, arriving 26 September. The following day she got underway to transit the Panama Canal for the eastern seaboard. She arrived in the New York Naval Shipyard 11 October 1945. Decommissioning and disposal Patterson decommissioned at the New York Naval Shipyard on 8 November 1945. She remained in reserve until her name was struck from the Naval Vessel Register 25 February 1947. She was sold for scrapping 18 August 1947 to the Northern Metals Company of Philadelphia, Pennsylvania. Honors and awards Patterson received 13 battle stars for World War II service.

Belarusian skomorokhs as they appear in a 1555 German etching A skomorokh (—Å–∫–æ–º–æ—Ä–æ—Ö in Russian, —Å–∫–æ–º–æ—Ä–æ—Ö—ä in Old East Slavic, —Å–∫–æ–º–æ—Ä–∞—Ö—ä in Church Slavonic) was a medieval East Slavic harlequin, or actor, who could also sing, dance, play musical instruments and compose for oral/musical and dramatic performances. The etymology of the word is not completely clear.Vasmer's Etymological Dictionary entry for skomorokh There are hypotheses that the word is derived from the Greek œÉŒ∫œéŒºŒºŒ±œÅœáŒøœÇ (cf. œÉŒ∫·ø∂ŒºŒºŒ±, \\"joke\\"); from the Italian scaramuccia (\\"joker\\", cf. English scaramouch); from the Arabic mas·∫ãara; and many others. The skomorokhs appeared in Kievan Rus no later than the mid-11th century, but fresco depictions of skomorokh musicians in the Saint Sophia Cathedral in Kiev date to the 11th century. The Primary Chronicle on skomorokhs concurs with the period. The monk chronicler denounced them as devil servants. Furthermore, the Orthodox Church often railed against them and other elements of popular culture as being irreverent, detracting from the worship of God or being downright diabolical. For example Theodosius of Kiev, one of the co-founders of the Caves Monastery in the 11th century, called the skomorokhs \\"evils to be shunned by good Christians\\".Feodosii Pecherskii, Sochinenia, I. I. (Izmail Ivanovich) Sreznevskii, ed., in Ucheniia zapiski vtorogo otdelenie Imperatorskoi Akademii Nauk, Vol. 2, no. 2, (St. Petersburg: Tipografii Imperatorskoi Akademii Nauk, 1856), 195; See Russell Zguta, \\"Skomorokhi: The Russian Minstrel-Entertainers\\", Slavic Review 31 No. 2 (June 1972), 297-298; Idem, Russian Minstrels: A History of the Skomorokhi (Philadelphia: University of Pennsylvania Press, 1978). Their art was related and addressed to the common people and usually opposed the ruling groups, who considered them not just useless but even ideologically detrimental and dangerous by both the feudalists and the clergy. They were persecuted in the years of the Mongol yoke, when the church strenuously propagated ascetic living. Its art reached its peak in the 15th to the 17th centuries. Their repertoire included mock songs, dramatic and satirical sketches, called glumy (–≥–ª—É–º—ã), performed in masks and skomorokh dresses to the sounds of domra, balalaika, gudok, bagpipes or buben (a kind of tambourine). The appearance of Russian puppet theatre was directly associated with skomorokh performances. Skomorokhs performed in the streets and city squares, engaging with the spectators to draw them into their play. Usually, the main character of the skomorokh performance was a fun- loving saucy muzhik (–º—É–∂–∏–∫) of comic simplicity. In the 16 and 17th centuries, skomorokhs would sometimes combine their efforts and perform in a vataga (–≤–∞—Ç–∞–≥–∞, big crowd) numbering 70 to 100 people. The skomorokhs were often persecuted by the Russian Orthodox Church and civilian authorities. In 1648 and 1657, Tsar Alexei Mikhailovich issued ukases banning skomorokh art as blasphemous, but actors would still occasionally perform during popular celebrations. In the 18th century, skomorokh art gradually died away; passing on some of its traditions to the ' (–±–∞–ª–∞–≥–∞–Ω) and rayoks (—Ä–∞—ë–∫).

Jarvis, a U.S. Navy midshipman who was killed at the age of 13 during the Quasi-War with France. She saw service in the Pacific in the early months of World War II, and participated in the invasion of Guadalcanal. The destroyer was sunk to the south of Guadalcanal on 9 August 1942, with all hands - one of only two American major surface warships to be lost in World War II with no survivors. Construction and service history The second Jarvis (DD-393) was laid down by Puget Sound Navy Yard, Bremerton, Washington on 21 August 1935. The vessel was launched on 6 May 1937; sponsored by Mrs Thomas T. Craven, wife of Vice Admiral Craven. Jarvis was commissioned on 27 October 1937, Lieutenant Commander R. R. Ferguson in command. Clearing Puget Sound on 4 January 1938, Jarvis operated along the California coast and in the Caribbean Sea until 1 April 1940 when she departed San Diego for fleet exercises off the Hawaiian Islands. She arrived at Pearl Harbor on 26 April, cruised in the Pacific to Midway and Johnston Islands, and steamed to San Francisco, arriving on 8 February 1941 for overhaul. Returning to Pearl Harbor on 17 April to commence more than seven months of intensive maneuvers as part of Destroyer Division Eight (DesDiv 8) of Destroyer Squadron Four, she put into Pearl Harbor on 4 December following exercises off Maui Island. =Attack on Pearl Harbor= Three days later the Japanese executed the carefully planned, devastating attack on Pearl Harbor. Moored next to in berth B6 of the Navy yard for minor repairs, Jarvis opened fire with 5-inch guns and machine guns and made preparations to get underway. Within minutes of the initial attack, her 5-inch guns were among the first to challenge the enemy raiders, and her gunners claimed four planes. As the first wave of enemy bombers raked Battleship Row with torpedoes and bombs, Ensign W. F. Greene appraised the situation with the following entry in Jarvis Deck Log: \\"0758 Hostilities with Japan commenced with air raid on Pearl Harbor. Went to General Quarters.\\" Emerging from the attack with no loss of crew and only superficial damage, Jarvis sortied that morning with several cruisers and destroyers to conduct surveillance and anti-submarine warfare (ASW) patrols. =First war cruises= On 16 December she cleared Pearl Harbor with the aircraft carrier and joined Task Force 14, steaming to relieve the beleaguered defenders on Wake Atoll. The task forces was recalled to Pearl Harbor on 23 December after the rescue mission was aborted. Jarvis returned to Pearl Harbor on 29 December to resume ASW patrols. While operating with the carrier and her screening cruisers, Jarvis rescued 182 survivors of the stricken fleet oiler six hours after she was torpedoed during mid-watch on 23 January 1942. Jarvis departed Pearl Harbor on 5 February to escort a convoy to Brisbane, Australia. Following her return on 27 March, the destroyer sailed on 8 April for San Francisco to undergo alterations with the other ships of DesRon Four. She returned to Pearl Harbor on 18 May escorting 13 ships and proceeded five days later via Fiji to Sydney, Australia. Arriving on 18 June, Jarvis commenced convoy escort and ASW patrols from Australia to New Caledonia, continuing this duty until called to participate in the invasion of Guadalcanal. =Guadalcanal campaign= Steaming from Sydney on 14 July, Jarvis arrived in Wellington, New Zealand, on 19 July to join Task Force 62. The task force sailed on 22 July for the Solomons. After conducting rehearsal landings in the Fiji Islands from 28 to 30 July, the invasion force of 84 ships and 20,000 Marines steamed for Guadalcanal on 31 July. Protected from Japanese search planes by rain and heavy mists, the force arrived off the landing beaches at dawn on 7 August. Following naval and air bombardment of enemy defenses, the first amphibious operation of the war commenced at 0650. Jarvis patrolled as part of the protective screen while Marines established a beachhead. As landing operations progressed, the Americans expected the Japanese to strike vigorously at the transports with land-based planes. However, during two attacks which occurred that afternoon the Americans sustained only minor damage on Mugford while destroying 14 enemy planes. Following a night patrol off the southern end of Savo Island, Jarvis returned to Lunga Point to screen the unloading transports. The warning of an impending air attack suspended these operations and the transports and their protective screen of destroyers and cruisers deployed in the body of water between Guadalcanal and Florida Island, soon to be called \\"Ironbottom Sound\\". When enemy torpedo bombers appeared around noon on 8 August, they met a stream of antiaircraft fire. Only 9 of the 26 planes penetrated the defensive fire, but they set the attack transport ablaze and torpedoed Jarvis. =Torpedoed= With 5-inch shells and machine gun fire engaging the attackers, Jarvis maneuvered between the heavy cruiser and one of the planes during the thick of the fight. As anti-aircraft fire consumed the plane, its torpedo exploded against Jarvis starboard side near the forward fireroom, stopping her dead in the water and killing 14 crewmen. Her crew jettisoned the port torpedoes and quickly brought under control the fires that followed the explosion. The destroyer towed her to shallow anchorage off Lunga Point; and, after the attack, she crossed \\"Ironbottom Sound\\" to Tulagi, where she transferred her seven wounded and commenced emergency repairs. Despite a gash in her side, she was considered seaworthy and ordered to proceed under cover of darkness to Efate, New Hebrides, escorted by the minesweeper Hovey. Apparently unaware of the order because her radios had been disabled, her commanding officer, Lt. Comdr. William W. Graham Jr., decided to steam to Sydney, Australia, for immediate repairs from the destroyer tender . Unnoticed by her own ships, Jarvis departed Tulagi at midnight on 9 August and moved slowly westward through \\"Ironbottom Sound\\" and between Savo Island and Cape Esperance. At 0134 she passed northward of Rear Admiral Mikawa's cruisers, steaming to meet the Americans at the Battle of Savo Island. Mistaking her for a cruiser of the New Zealand Achilles class, they fired torpedoes, and the destroyer later engaged her briefly, all without effect. The destroyer, continuing to retire westward, had little speed, no radio communications, and few operative guns; but she refused aid from the destroyer upon being sighted at 0325. After daybreak a Saratoga-based scout plane sighted her 40 miles off Guadalcanal, trailing fuel oil and down by the bow. That was the last time Americans saw her. =Loss of Jarvis= However, the Japanese, still mistaking Jarvis for an escaping cruiser, dispatched 31 planes from Rabaul to search out and destroy her. Once discovered the badly damaged destroyer was no match for bombers raking the ship with bullets and torpedoes. According to Japanese records, Jarvis \\"split and sank\\" at 1300 on 9 August. None of her 233 remaining crew survived the onslaught. Jarvis received three battle stars for World War II service.

CIS doesn't provide any details about its funding, though the Colcom Foundation is one of its main sources. CIS has been described as conservative, a label rejected by the organization. After an NPR story described CIS as \\"decidedly right-wing,\\" Edward Schumacher-Matos, the then ombudsman of NPR, argued that this mislabelled CIS, noting the organization's \\"political diversity.\\" = Trump administration = CIS influenced the Trump 2016 campaign and Trump administration's rhetoric on immigration. Trump's first national general election ad cited CIS. In 2017, CIS analyst Jon Feere joined the Immigration and Customs Enforcement of the Trump administration. In his writings for CIS, Feere had claimed that giving birth on U.S. soil gives immigrants access to welfare and other social benefits, and that this gives rise to \\"birth tourism\\" (the practice of foreigners traveling to the United States to give birth to U.S. citizens). CNN wrote that \\"Politifact has mostly debunked those claims, concluding that US-born children do little in the long term to help their immigrant parents. Citizen children cannot sponsor their parents for citizenship until the young person turns 21 and any social benefits would be given to the child and not their undocumented parents, who do not qualify. The Pew Research Center also has found that the number of babies born to unauthorized immigrants in the United States has been declining steadily in recent years.\\" In September 2017, the Trump administration defended its claim that Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals (DACA) \\"denied jobs to hundreds of thousands of Americans by allowing those same illegal aliens to take those jobs\\" by citing editorials written by members of the Center for Immigration Studies. However, economists consulted by PolitiFact rejected the claim, noting that the job market is not fixed or zero-sum. In May 2018, President Trump nominated Ronald Mortensen, a CIS fellow, as Assistant Secretary of State for the Bureau of Population, Refugees, and Migration, a top state department position overseeing refugee resettlement. Mortensen had been a vocal critic of illegal immigration. In March 2019, CIS fellow Todd Bensman claimed that female migrants were given free elective laser eye surgery in detention centers, and that their children were given free braces. The Associated Press found the claim to be false.  Policy stances and Activities  The Center for Immigration Studies supports lower levels of legal immigration and stricter enforcement measures against illegal immigration. = Support for Trump administration's family separation policy = In 2018, CIS defended the Trump administration's decision to separate undocumented immigrant children from their parents. CIS argued that the policy deterred immigrant families from crossing the US border and said that the policy \\"actually protects foreign nationals.\\" At a June 2018 event hosted at CIS, outgoing Acting Director of Immigration and Customs Enforcement, Thomas Homan, defended the policy.Immigration and Customs Enforcement Director Defends Separating Families at the Border, Time Magazine, Maya Rhodan, June 5, 2018. Retrieved June 6, 2018. = Opposition to sanctuary cities = CIS opposes sanctuary cities, which are jurisdictions which limit cooperation with federal immigrant enforcement agencies or prioritize law enforcement resources for other things than immigration enforcement. = Opposition to work permits for foreign university students = CIS seeks an end to \\"Optional Practical Training\\" work permits, which foreign students who attend American universities can use to obtain internships. = Publications = CIS publishes books and posts on its website a variety of announcements, research reports, memoranda, op-eds and articles, panel discussion transcripts, Congressional testimony, and videos. It also maintains a blog. The organization's publications address topics relating to both illegal and legal immigration.  Criticism  The Southern Poverty Law Center (SPLC) published reports in 2002 and 2009Beirich, Heidi. The Nativist Lobby . Southern Poverty Law Center. on John Tanton, who founded CIS. Tanton is a retired Michigan ophthalmologist who opposed immigration on racial grounds, desired a white ethnic majority in the United States and advocated for eugenics. The SPLC's 2009 report charged that \\"FAIR, CIS and NumbersUSA are all part of a network of restrictionist organizations conceived and created by John Tanton\\" who they said had \\"deeply racist\\" views, and said that the group had \\"frequently manipulated data\\" in order to promote anti-immigration goals. In a response in the National Review, Krikorian called the SPLC's report \\"hackwork\\", and pointed to members of the CIS board who were involved with civil rights organizations as evidence that the group was not a hate group. Tanton also denied the SPLC's accusations. As to his alleged influence at CIS, he wrote, \\"I also helped raise a grant in 1985 for the Center for Immigration Studies, but I have played no role in the Center's growth or development.\\"Tanton, John. \\"SPLC‚Äôs MO: Audacter calumniare semper aliquid haeret (slander boldly, something always sticks).\\" The Social Contract. Spring 2010. According to CNN, Tanton openly embraced eugenics. The New York Times noted that Tanton made his case against immigration in racial terms. CIS has consequently been criticized for its reluctance to criticize Tanton and his views. In March 2010, CIS published a report written by Jerry Kammer, a senior research fellow at CIS, that was sharply critical of the SPLC, its tactics and methodologies, and its attacks against groups such as CIS, NumbersUSA, and FAIR.Kammer, Jerry. \\"Immigration and the SPLC: How the Southern Poverty Law Center Invented a Smear, Served La Raza, Manipulated the Press, and Duped its Donors.\\" Center for Immigration Studies. March 2010. Retrieved April 13, 2010. In 2004, a Wall Street Journal editorial repeated the SPLC's allegation that CIS is part of a network of organizations founded by Tanton and also charged that these organizations are \\"trying to stop immigration to the U.S.\\" It quoted Chris Cannon, at the time a Republican U.S. Representative from Utah, as saying, \\"Tanton set up groups like CIS and FAIR to take an analytical approach to immigration from a Republican point of view so that they can give cover to Republicans who oppose immigration for other reasons.\\" Several months earlier, Krikorian denied allegations made in a similarly critical The Wall Street Journal editorial and by Rep. Cannon, writing \\"This kind of venomous lying and guilt by association are par for the course in the fever swamps of the web, but are startling in the halls of the U.S. Congress and the pages of the nation's largest-circulation newspaper.\\"Krikorian, Mark. \\"Strange Bedfellows.\\" National Review Online. March 31, 2004. Although former Rep. Cannon expressed a negative view of CIS, the CIS website quotes other elected officials, including U.S. Representative Lamar S. Smith (R-TX), former Governor Richard D. Lamm (D-CO), U.S. Senator Jeff Sessions (R-AL), and former U.S. Senator Alan Simpson (R-WY), in support of the organization. In 2016, the SPLC began describing CIS as an anti- immigrant hate group. It cited CIS's repeated publication of white nationalist and anti-Semitic writers, its employment of an analyst known to promote racist pseudoscience, its association with John Tanton, and its record of publishing reports that it said hyped the criminality of immigrants. In 2019, CIS sued the SPLC over the hate group designation in a RICO lawsuit, alleging that the designation was false and part of a \\"smear campaign.\\" Notre Dame Law School professor G. Robert Blakey, the author of the 1970 RICO statute, described CIS's filing as \\"not too thoughtful\\" and said its legal claims lacked merit. The SPLC described the suit as an attempt to suppress their right to free speech. The lawsuit was dismissed in September 2019 by Judge Amy Berman Jackson for failure to state a claim. = Controversial reports = The Center for Immigration Studies has been criticized for publishing a number of reports deemed to be false or misleading and using poor methodology by scholars on immigration, such as the authors of the National Academies of Sciences 2016 report on immigration; by think tanks such as the Center on Budget and Policy Priorities, the Cato Institute, Urban Institute and Center for American Progress; fact-checkers such as FactCheck.Org, PolitiFact, Washington Post, Snopes and NBC News; and by immigration-research organizations (such as Migration Policy Institute and the Immigration Policy Center. A March 2003 CIS report said that between 1996 and 2001 welfare use by immigrant headed households had increased and that \\"welfare use rates for immigrants and natives are essentially back to where they were in 1996 when welfare reform was passed.\\" The Center on Budget and Policy Priorities said this was misleading because the U.S. children of noncitizens \\"account[ed] for all of the increase in Medicaid or SCHIP participation among U.S. citizens living in low-income households headed by noncitizens.\\" In March 2007, CIS issued a report saying that the \\"proportion of immigrant-headed households using at least one major welfare program is 33 percent, compared to 19 percent for native households.\\" Wayne A. Cornelius of the Center for Comparative Immigration Studies at UCSD, wrote that this was misleading because \\"once 'welfare usage' is disaggregated, as Camarota does in a table near the end of his report, we see that food assistance is the only category in which there is a significant difference between immigrant- and native-headed households. Immigrants are significantly less likely than natives to use Medicaid, and they use subsidized housing and cash assistance programs at about the same (low) rate as natives.\\" In September 2011, CIS published a report Who Benefited from Job Growth In Texas? saying that, in the period 2007‚Äì2011, immigrants (legal and illegal) had taken 81% of newly created jobs in the state. According to Jeffrey S. Passel, senior demographer for the Pew Hispanic Center, \\"there are lots of methodological problems with the CIS study, mainly having to do with the limitations of small sample sizes and the fact that the estimates are determined by taking differences of differences based on small sample sizes.\\" Chuck DeVore, a conservative at the Texas Public Policy Foundation, criticized the report, saying that it \\"relied on flawed methodology.\\" CIS subsequently replied to DeVore's criticism. The report was subsequently cited by Mitt Romney and David Frum. Politifact, when evaluating Frum and Romney's statements, noted that CIS's report \\"does acknowledge that 'no estimate of illegal immigration is exact'. But the methodological shortcomings also weaken the certainty of Romney‚Äôs statistic. On balance, we think that both the report‚Äôs authors and its critics have reasonable points. In the big picture, we agree with Chuck DeVore ‚Äì a conservative critic of the study ‚Äì that 'trying to draw conclusions about immigration and employment in Texas in isolation from other factors is problematic at best.' But we also agree with Mark Krikorian, the Center for Immigration Studies‚Äô executive director, that 'even if DeVore prefers a net-to-net comparison, immigrants still got a disproportionate share of new jobs'.\\" Norman Matloff, a UC Davis professor of computer science, wrote a report featured at CIS arguing that most H-1B visa workers, rather than being \\"the best and the brightest,\\" are mostly of average talent. James Shrek of the Heritage Foundation argued that Matloff's methodology was a \\"highly misleading measure of ability,\\" as Matloff simply looked at the wages of the H-1B visa workers and how they compared to other workers in the sector. Shrek notes that the existing data shows that H-1B workers are more skilled than the average American: \\"H-1B workers are highly educated. Almost half have an advanced degree. The median H-1B worker earns 90 percent more than the median U.S. worker. They are in no way average workers.\\" Matloff, in his reply, said that H-1B workers were not supposed to be compared to median workers and that Sherk's argument is \\"completely at odds with the claims the industry has made concerning the \\"best and brightest\\" issue\\" and that comparison to O-1 visa wage data showed that H-1B visas were being used by employers to undercut wages. In May 2014, a CIS report said that in 2013 Immigration and Customs Enforcement had \\"freed 36,007 convicted criminal aliens from detention who were awaiting the outcome of deportation proceedings... [and t]he vast majority of these releases from ICE custody were discretionary, not required by law (in fact, in some instances, apparently contrary to law), nor the result of local sanctuary policies.\\" An ICE spokesman said that many such releases were required by law, for instance when a detainee's home country refuses to accept them or required by a judge's order. Caitlin Dickson, writing in the Daily Beast said that ICE had \\"highlighted key points that CIS failed to address.\\" Associated Press, however, when reporting on CIS's figures, said that \\"the releases that weren't mandated by law, including [the] 28 percent of the immigrants with homicide convictions, undermines the government's argument that it uses its declining resources for immigration enforcement to find and jail serious criminal immigrants who may pose a threat to public safety or national security.\\" CIS's report was criticized by the Immigration Policy Center of the American Immigration Council who said that \\"looking at this group of people as an undifferentiated whole doesn‚Äôt tell you much about who poses a risk to public safety and who does not.\\" Muzaffar Chishti, the New York director of the nonpartisan Migration Policy Institute, said that the CIS report was \\"a select presentation of a set of facts without any comparative analysis that can lead to misleading conclusions.\\" According to CBS, Gregory Chen of the American Immigration Lawyers Association said the report had ‚Äúa lot of misleading information‚Äù and \\"that the report's definition of criminals who have been 'released' includes those who are still subject to supervision including electronic ankle monitoring and regular check ins with ICE.\\" A May 2015 report by CIS stated that \\"immigrant households receive 41 percent more federal welfare than households headed by native-born citizens.\\" The report was criticized on the basis of poor methodology by Alex Nowrasteh of the Cato Institute. Nowrasteh said that the report opted not to examine how much welfare immigrants use, but to examine households led by an immigrant so that the report could count the welfare usage of the immigrant's US-born children, which leads to a misleading estimate of immigrant welfare use. In September 2016, CIS misrepresented the findings of a comprehensive state-of-the-art report on the academic immigration literature by the National Academies of Sciences. CIS headlined its own summary of the report, \\"National Academy of Sciences Study of Immigration: Workers and Taxpayers Lose, Businesses Benefit.\\" A 2018 Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences (PNAS) study cited CIS's misrepresentation, which was repeated by President Trump, as an example of unscrupulous actors with ulterior motives who make it difficult for researchers to communicate scientific findings to the public. In 2017, Stephen Miller, a senior White House policy adviser, sought to get the State Department to use figures from CIS that were considered flawed by the State Department. They claimed that refugees cost 12 times more to resettle in the United States than to resettle them in the region of the world where they were from. State Department officials refused to use the CIS report because the report failed to take into account the contributions that the refugees would make through paying taxes. A February 2017 CIS report said that \\"72 individuals from the seven countries covered in President Trump's vetting executive order have been convicted in terror cases since the 9/11 attacks,\\" an assertion that several fact-checking agencies debunked. Stephen Miller, a senior White House policy adviser, used the data provided by CIS to justify President Trump's 90-day travel ban, earning him \\"Three Pinocchois\\" from the Washington Post Fact-Checker (its second-worst rating). FactCheck.org found that most (44 of the 72) had not been convicted on terrorism charges, and that none of the 72 people were responsible for a terrorism-related death in the US, and Snopes mirrored the assessment. In March 2018, the Trump administration stated that construction on a Mexico border wall would pay for itself by keeping undocumented immigrants out of the United States, citing a CIS report. The CIS report was based on data from the 2016 National Academies of Science (NAS) report. However, several of the authors of the NAS report said that CIS misused the data from the report, made unjustifiable methodological decisions, and that it was likelier that keeping undocumented immigrants out would reduce government revenue. The 18-member panel of economists, sociologists, demographers and public policy experts, and chosen by the National Academies of Science, concluded that undocumented immigrants had a net positive fiscal impact.

It makes up the Assistance Platform on Windows Vista. MAML is also used to provide help information for PowerShell V2 Cmdlets, modules and advanced functions.  Concept  MAML is a departure from all previous types of user assistance for Windows operating systems. Some of its features have been available in .NET Framework 2, but more options shipped with the release of .NET Framework 3. Previously, user assistance for Windows operating systems used Microsoft Compiled HTML Help files, which contains little machine-readable semantic information. The most significant aspect of MAML is that it shifts the production of user assistance to the concept of structured authoring (somewhat similar to DITA or DocBook). Documents and their constituent elements are defined by their context. With MAML, the emphasis is on content and the tasks a user performs with a computer, not the features of the software. Presentation is managed as part of the rendering engine when a user requests a topic. The structured feature of MAML means that it can express a wide range of active concepts as well. One notable feature is guided help (active content wizard), which allows the help file to either run a task automatically or highlight the parts of the screen a user should interact with step-by-step. This feature was considered a highlight of Project Longhorn, but Microsoft decided against including it in the final Vista release. The MAML authoring structure is divided into segments related to a type of content: conceptual, FAQ, glossary, procedure, reference, reusable content, task, troubleshooting, and tutorial.  Presentation  Three levels of transformation occur when a topic is displayed: structure, presentation, and rendering: * The structural transformation contains reusable content and applies conditional logic to determine the structure that content should take when it is displayed, and the content of the text itself. * The presentation transformation enables content authored in MAML to use many different formats, including DHTML, XAML, RTF, and printed material. * The rendering transformation applies style sheets and displays the final content to users.  Authoring  At present, there are no Microsoft released automated tools to assist in the creation of MAML - you need to create the XML files by hand. Unfortunately, there is no decent tool available for IT Pros to author MAML. You can use Notepad (which is pretty tedious). James O'Neil (former MSFT employee) shows you how you can use InfoPath to author this information, but this is far from perfect as his article suggests.  Format  The h1s help file format, along with the HelpPane viewer, is found in Windows Vista and Windows 7. The format is similar to Microsoft Help 2 hxs.

Biography Portrait of Antonio Mancini by John Singer Sargent, c.1898 Mancini was born in Rome and showed precocious ability as an artist. At the age of twelve, he was admitted to the Institute of Fine Arts in Naples, where he studied under Domenico Morelli (1823‚Äì1901), a painter of historical scenes who favored dramatic chiaroscuro and vigorous brushwork, and Filippo Palizzi. Mancini developed quickly under their guidance, and in 1872, he exhibited two paintings at the Paris Salon. Mancini worked at the forefront of the Verismo movement, an indigenous Italian response to 19th-century Realist aesthetics. His usual subjects included children of the poor, juvenile circus performers, and musicians he observed in the streets of Naples. His portrait of a young acrobat in Il Saltimbanco (1877‚Äì78) captures the fragility of the boy whose impoverished childhood is spent entertaining pedestrian crowds. While in Paris in the 1870s, Mancini met the Impressionist painters Edgar Degas and √âdouard Manet. He became friends with John Singer Sargent, who famously pronounced him to be the greatest living painter. His mature works show a brightened palette with a striking impasto technique on canvas and a bold command of pastels on paper. In 1881, Mancini suffered a disabling mental illness. He settled in Rome in 1883 for twenty years, then moved to Frascati where he lived until 1918. During this period of Mancini's life, he was often destitute and relied on the help of friends and art buyers to survive. After the First World War, his living situation stabilized and he achieved a new level of serenity in his work. Mancini died in Rome in 1930 and was buried in the Basilica Santi Bonifacio e Alessio on the Aventine Hill. His painting, The Poor Schoolboy, exhibited in the Salon of 1876, is in the Mus√©e d'Orsay of Paris. Its realist subject matter and dark palette are typical of his early work. Paintings by Mancini also may be seen in Galleria Nazionale d'Arte Moderna e Contemporanea in Rome, the Museo Civico-Galleria d'Arte Moderna in Turin, and other galleries in Italy. The first exhibition in the U.S. devoted exclusively to Mancini's work was at the Philadelphia Museum of Art, October 20, 2007 ‚Äì January 20, 2008. The Philadelphia Art Museum holds fifteen oil paintings and three pastels by Mancini that were a gift of New York City art dealer Vance N. Jordan.

Anticipating modern political philosophy, democracy according to de Paepe would inevitably spread to the economic segments of society and economic organizations: workplace democracy was inevitable. He graduated in medicine at the Universite Libre de Bruxelles. De Paepe was a leading member of the First International and was the principal leader of the Collectivist victory over the supporters of Proudhonian mutualism, like Henri Tolain, at the 1868 Brussels conference. Initially siding with the anti- Marxist side of the 1872 split, his subsequent debates with the anarchists of the Jura Federation such as Paul Brousse and Adh√©mar Schwitzgu√©bel over the \\"Public Service Question\\" led him to defend the necessity of a workers' state to provide social services like a public health service.David Stafford, \\"From Anarchism to Reformism: A Study of the Political Activities of Paul Brousse, 1870-90\\", London 1971.\\"No Gods, No Masters\\", ed. Daniel Gu√©rin, AK Press, 2005 At the end of 1877 De Paepe, Joseph Favre, Beno√Æt Malon and Ippolito Perderzolli co-founded the review Le Socialisme progressif in Switzerland. Twenty three issues appeared between 7 January and 30 November 1878. Favre, Malon, Lodovico Nabruzzi and Tito Zanardelli had earlier founded the internationalist section of Lake Lugano. They rejected insurrection in favor of evolutionary solutions, and supported trade unions. Because he flourished after The Communist Manifesto but before World War I, de Paepe's views are inevitably compared to those of Karl Marx. De Paepe was notably neutral on the question of a violent worker revolution by the proletariat. He thought it was possible, and maybe desirable in some countries, but that a slow gradual advancement of democratic values and norms in workplaces would have a pacifying effect and eventually make the methods by which the ruling class ruled obsolete: once everyone was a manager, management would lose mystique, just as once everyone could vote, political leadership had also.

Development When SSI began work on the Dark Sun game engine in 1989 after the completion of Secret of the Silver Blades, they passed responsibility for continuing the Forgotten Realms Gold Box games to Beyond Software. Designers Don Daglow, Mark Buchignani, David Bunnett, Arturo Sinclair and Mark Manyen set the action for the game in an area of the Forgotten Realms that TSR had labeled The Savage Frontier, north of Waterdeep and south of Luskan along the Sword Coast. The area was far to the west of the region that hosted the action for Pool of Radiance and its sequels. One of the major locations in the Savage Frontier, Neverwinter, spun off a new chapter. Beyond Software gained the support of AOL executive Steve Case to create the first-ever graphical MMORPG, and to base it on the Gold Box engine. To leverage the existing game and cross-promote the titles, Daglow based the new MMORPG in Neverwinter and named it Neverwinter Nights. The game's principal technical enhancement to the aging Gold Box engine was the addition of wilderness play, where the party traveled long distances on the map while following the basic D&D; rules for combat with wandering monsters. The game also featured character-specific side-quests, with two NPCs who can open these optional missions. The side quests in turn open different endings for the game. The game spawned one sequel, Treasures of the Savage Frontier (1992). Plot Overview The game revolves around a standard (for Gold Box adventures) party of six adventurers who inadvertently get caught up in a plot by the Zhentarim to conquer the entire Frontier area. The storyline, in rough terms, follows: * The party starts off in Yartar, having just escorted a caravan from the dwarven stronghold Citadel Adbar (ruled by the dwarf king Harbromm). At the tavern, while the party is enjoying the feast and spirits, something is slipped into their food that causes them to pass out, and they are robbed of all gold and gear, especially the magic longsword that one member used to slay a griffon at Longsaddle. However, each character has a purse of coins under their pillow so they can buy armor and weapons. * Through rescuing the NPC Krevish, the party being hired by the Kraken in Yartar to assassinate a cleric of Bane at Nesme, only to discover that this evil priest was the only individual standing in the way of the conquest. * Rescuing the magic user Amelior Amanitas from Everlund, an eccentric and somewhat absent- minded wizard who explains how to stop the Zhentarim. Returning to Yartar, the party is captured and imprisoned in a Kraken base below the city.

Those who use these techniques are called \\"hypermilers\\". Hypermiling can be practiced in any vehicle regardless of fuel consumption. It gained popularity due to the rise in gasoline prices in the 2000s. Some hypermiling techniques are illegal in some countries because they are dangerous. In 2008, the New Oxford American Dictionary voted \\"hypermiling\\" the best new word of the year. Safety and awareness program Hypermiling has come under fire from several sides because some hypermilers show dangerous or illegal behaviour, such as tailgating larger vehicles on motorways to save fuel, cycling between accelerating and coasting in neutral, and even turning the engine off when its power is not needed. For this reason, the Hypermiling Safety Foundation was established in August 2008 to promote a safety and education program that promotes legal fuel-saving techniques. Hypermiling with electric cars The range of some electric cars are limited. To get maximum out of the battery, drivers sometimes use hypermiling.What's Electric Vehicle Hypermiling? Some try to get a new record with one charging of battery. For example, a Tesla Model 3 ran more than 1000 km with one battery charge.

Location Norge is located on the old Richmond-Williamsburg Stage Road, which is U.S. Route 60 in modern times. Interstate 64 was built through the area in the 1970s, and passes nearby. Exit 231 is labeled \\"Croaker-Norge\\" for the two small communities nearby. History The new community of Norge was formally established beginning in 1904 in western James City County by Norwegian-Americans and other Scandinavians, with persons resettling from other places in North America joined by new immigrants. The word \\"Norge\\" is the Norwegian (Bokm√•l) spelling of \\"Norway\\". Land at Norge was reasonably priced and offered rich farm land in a gentler climate than that of the northern and Midwestern states, where some of the immigrants had originally settled upon coming to America. For some years, prospective new residents were introduced to the area through promotional material sent out by Carl Martin Bergh, a fellow Norwegian-American with farming experience who had become a land agent for the Chesapeake and Ohio Railway (C&O;). The Peninsula Extension of the railroad had been built through the area in 1881 to reach from the mountains of West Virginia to the coal piers on Hampton Roads at the new city of Newport News in adjacent Warwick County. Originally known as \\"Vaiden's Siding\\", the C&O; built a railroad station at Norge in 1908. The Norge Depot offered a convenient point for shipping farm produce to places such as Richmond. Although the railroad station was closed in 1969, and C&O; passenger service ended in 1971, Amtrak continues to serve the area with a stop at the Williamsburg, Virginia station. By 1909, Norge contained 25 buildings, including homes, churches, stores and other businesses. Some of the original buildings still stand today. Landmarks Viking Hall, early 20th century Viking Hall, now Norge Community Hall, early 21st century The Norge Historic District was considered for the National Register of Historic Places in 1992 (reference number 92001269), but there were owner objections. The landmarks include the following: Viking Hall: In 1908, a group of young men, who called themselves the \\"Vikings\\", purchased two lots on the corner of Richmond Rd. and Peninsula St. for $5.00 in order to construct a Town Hall. They wanted a centrally located place to be used for dances, meetings and parties as their parents had known in Norway. Viking Hall provided a space for a variety of venues until the 1920s, when it went into disrepair. The Norge Home Demonstration Club purchased the building, renovated it, and renamed it the Norge Community Hall. To this day, the community and many local organizations continue to make extensive use of this hall. Bergh Hotel: This hotel was built at the turn of the 20th century. It was owned and operated by Alfred Bergh to accommodate the new arrivals at the new community. The building today is thriving as a furniture store: since the 1980s it has been the \\"Williamsburg Wicker and Rattan\\". Kinde and Nesseth Store: Hans Kinde and John Nesseth opened Norge's first store in 1903. It was a general store that sold everything from clothing to fertilizer to groceries. In 1904, the first Norge post office operated from this facility. The building was rebuilt in 1908 after a fire, and still operates today as an antique store under the name \\"The Old Store in the Village\\". The farm home of Carl Bergh, built around 1904, is located at the end of Farmville Lane in Norge. The house was built on the remaining foundation of Farmville Plantation Manor House dating to the early 1800s, which had burned in the 1890s. Other landmarks in Norge include the former Doll Factory, the former Williamsburg Soap and Candle Factory, Our Saviour's Evangelical Lutheran Church and the Norge Train Depot, which was listed in the National Register of Historic Places in 2009.

The slogan of the organization is ‚ÄúFrom Small Acorns Large Oaks Grow.‚Äù The club began early in the 20th century as a noontime gathering of west side businessmen who lunched at West Franklin Street to discuss the topics of the day. The original name of the informal association was \\"West Side Epicures.\\" In March 1914, feeling that the name \\"did not express anything to the layman,\\" the men changed the name to \\"The Nut Club.\\" In the same month, they proposed to the West Side Business Association that a fall festival be held in October.

The song is the second track in Dylan's 1976 album Desire. The song, which features allusions to ancient Egypt, including sharing its title with an Egyptian goddess, has been characterized by Dylan as a song \\"about marriage\\".  Description  This song is in a moderately fast 3/4 time, in the key of B-flat major. The arrangement is based on rhythm chords played on acoustic piano, accompanied by bass guitar, drums, and violin. The harmonic progression consists of an ostinato using the following chords throughout: I‚ÄìVII‚ô≠‚ÄìIV‚ÄìI B‚ô≠‚ÄìA‚ô≠‚ÄìE‚ô≠‚ÄìB‚ô≠ The lyrics are all verses; there is no chorus. The melody is in the style of a modal folk song, emphasizing the tonic and dominant notes in the scale, with leaps of a fifth in between them. The mode is Mixolydian with a major third in the harmony, but Dylan's delivery of the melody and Rivera's violin accompaniment use a flatted third as in the blues. Dylan ends the performance with a brief upward glissando on the piano.  Song narrative  \\"Isis\\" tells the tale of a man (the narrator) who married an enigmatic woman (\\"a mystical child\\") named Isis. The story covers his separation from her, his subsequent adventure and, ultimately, his return. The marriage took place \\"on the fifth day of May,\\" (an allusion to Cinco de Mayo, one of several Mexican themes found in Dylan's songs during the 1970s). After the wedding, he \\"could not hold on to her very long\\", so he \\"cut off his hair and rode straight away for the wild unknown country...\\" He reaches a \\"high place\\" divided by a line \\"through the center of town\\" into \\"darkness and light.\\" He hitches his pony and enters a laundry, as though to wash himself of his past. He meets and falls in with a shady character who promises \\"something easy to catch.\\" They ride \\"to the pyramids all embedded in ice\\". They carry on in freezing conditions until the bounty-hunting companion dies. The narrator breaks into the empty tomb (\\"the casket was empty\\"), finds no treasure, and realizes the adventure had been a fool's errand. He leaves his dead companion in the tomb, says a quick prayer, and rides back to Isis, whom he still loves. He sees Isis in a meadow and when she asks him if he is going to stay this time, he replies, \\"If you want me to, yes!\\"  Writing  The song was written and recorded during a time of separation and reunion in Dylan's own marriage; consequently, for fans and critics the temptation to interpret it as an allegory of Dylan's own marital difficulties is irresistible, especially since the Desire album contains the song \\"Sara\\" which is openly about their marriage and separation. Dylan was known to include autobiographical hints in his previous songs. \\"Isis\\" draws upon mythological themes of a male hero separating from his wife, going on adventures, and returning to the marriage, going back to the Odyssey.  Personnel  *Bob Dylan ‚Äì vocals, piano and harmonica *Scarlet Rivera ‚Äì violin *Rob Stoner ‚Äì bass guitar *Howie Wyeth ‚Äì drums  Live performances  Dylan did an up-tempo live version of the song with the Rolling Thunder Revue in 1975. A performance taped on this tour on December 4, 1975 was included in the 1978 film Renaldo and Clara, and released in video form in 2002 on a bonus DVD accompanying the initial release of The Bootleg Series Vol. 5: Bob Dylan Live 1975, The Rolling Thunder Revue. The audio recording of this performance had been released on the 1978 promotional EP 4 Songs from \\"Renaldo and Clara\\" and the 1985 compilation album Biograph. Dylan is heard introducing the piece as \\"a song about marriage,\\" and adds \\"This one's for Leonard, if you're still here!\\" referring to Leonard Cohen (the performance was recorded in Montreal, Cohen's birthplace). Another live version of the song, recorded on a tour date the previous month, appeared in audio format only on The Bootleg Series Vol. 5. In 2019, these two performances and four other live renditions of the song from the 1975 tour were released on the box set The Rolling Thunder Revue: The 1975 Live Recordings, along with two full-length rehearsals. According to Dylan's official website, Dylan has played \\"Isis\\" live 46 times, as of August 2020, with all performances in 1975 and 1976.

Lynch. It first aired on November 4, 2005 on Noggin as part of its teen programming block, The N. The show was produced by Noggin LLC in association with the creator's studio, Tom Lynch Company. It ran for three seasons and 40 episodes in total, the last of which aired on December 12, 2008. Live webisodes were also created to accompany each episode in the season 2 storyline, and were seen exclusively through The N's website on the Click. The show follows the lives of the members of the Carlin family (Paula, Arthur, Glen, Clay, and Spencer) as they adjust to moving from Ohio to Los Angeles, California. One of the main focuses include the relationship between Spencer Carlin (Gabrielle Christian) and her bisexual friend, Ashley Davies (Mandy Musgrave). The close friendship between Ashley and Spencer led Spencer to question her own sexuality, a subject which created controversy before the show first aired. It was the first series on The N to deal with such a subject relating to the primary characters. South of Nowhere was positively reviewed by publications such as Variety, The Boston Globe, and The New York Times. The series was nominated for a GLAAD Media Award for Outstanding Drama Series in 2006,https://www.tmz.com/2006/01/24/glaad-media-awards-nominations-announced/ 2007http://blogs.dailynews.com/outinhollywood/2007/01/21/glaad-media-awards- television/ and 2009.http://blogs.dailynews.com/outinhollywood/2009/01/27/the- glaad-media-awards-nominat/ Rare for a teen series, but fitting with Noggin/The N's goals as a \\"thinking channel,\\" the show was created with loose educational goals in mind. Parent discussion guides were available for each episode on The N's website. The guides offered tips and questions about the topics raised in South of Nowhere, especially those centered around sexual identity, to use as discussion starters with teenagers. Plot The series begins with the Carlins moving to Los Angeles. The Carlin children transfer to a Los Angeles school called King High. The father, Arthur, works as a social worker and school counselor. The mother, Paula, initiated the move to accept a lucrative job in the emergency room of a Los Angeles hospital. Throughout the series, Arthur and Paula struggle to keep their family happy and together in their new environment. The youngest Carlin child, Spencer, befriends a bisexual girl named Ashley Davies. Ashley is the jaded, neglected daughter of a famous rock star. As her friendship with Ashley develops into a romance, Spencer begins to question her sexuality. When she figures out that she is gay, Clay and Arthur support her, while Glen and Paula struggle to understand it at first and take time to realize the error of their ways. Spencer's relationship with Ashley introduces her to Aiden Dennison, who was once Ashley's boyfriend, as well as to Kyla Woods, Ashley's estranged half-sister who debuts in season two. Spencer and Ashley's storylines involve topics of homosexuality, homophobia, peer pressure, religion, romance, and high school. The middle child, Clay, was adopted by the Carlins and is African-American. He is a straight-A student and cares deeply about his future and his family. He becomes best friends with a movie buff named Sean Miller, and he dates an aspiring artist named Chelsea Lewis. Clay constantly wonders about his birth mother, which drives him to find out her identity and meet with her. When Clay discovers that his birth mother chose to give him up for adoption because she was a teen parent, he is hurt by her treatment of him, but they eventually make partial amends. At the end of the second season, Clay is murdered in a drive-by shooting at prom, deeply affecting his family and friends for the remainder of the series. Clay's storylines, as well as Sean's and Chelsea's, deal with topics of racism, abortion, adoption, teen pregnancy, hate crimes, and stepfamilies. The eldest child, Glen, is the athlete of the family. He joins the basketball team and quickly upstages the former star player, Aiden. Glen begins to date the captain of the cheerleading squad, Madison Duarte, and is sought after by colleges for his basketball skills. However, during an impromptu basketball match, Glen injures his leg and is unable to play. He becomes addicted to the painkillers he is prescribed, which leads to him losing his basketball dreams by the time he graduates. As a graduate, Glen plans to join the army but later decides against it, eventually choosing to work at a sporting goods store. Glen's storylines involve topics of drugs, drug dealing, arrests, college, stress, and the military.

Tom Ascheim, the general manager of Noggin and The N, said that South of Nowhere represented how he wanted The N block to present itself. In an interview with The New York Times, Ascheim said that the show \\"doesn't preach...it doesn't pretend it's doing something particularly heroic...it just kind of says, 'Hi, here we are, being who we are.'\\" Likewise, Friedman called the show \\"definitional\\" to the block. Each episode of South of Nowhere is half an hour in length with commercials (23‚Äì25 minutes of actual program). The pilot episode was produced as two episode segments and runs for one hour (about 46 minutes of actual program). Noggin LLC initially ordered 11 episodes of the series for its The N block, which aired on Fridays at 8:30 p.m. On February 27, 2008, it was officially announced on The N's podcast, The N'Sider Podcast, that South of Nowhere was to be canceled after the end of season 3.

Club career Morris came through the youth ranks at Chelsea, alongside his close friend John Terry.

While at Chelsea, he made 124 league appearances and was a late substitute in the 2000 FA Cup Final, receiving a winner's medal. He was also briefly made captain of the club by manager Gianluca Vialli. However, when Claudio Ranieri took over from Vialli as Chelsea boss, Morris' first team opportunities diminished, and he was linked with a host of clubs including being reunited with his former England under-21 manager Peter Taylor at Leicester. Morris never regained his position as a first team regular at Chelsea, finding himself behind players, such as Roberto di Matteo, Dennis Wise, Didier Deschamps and Emmanuel Petit. He was offered a new five-year contract with Chelsea in 2003, but chose to turn it down. Graeme Souness offered him the chance of regular first team football at Blackburn Rovers and they shook hands on a deal, but it fell through. He joined Leeds United instead, but made only 12 appearances for the club. After a short spell at Rotherham United, where he scored once against Stoke City, he joined Millwall in 2004. Morris made 70 first-team appearances for Millwall, before fracturing his cheekbone, and then suffered cruciate knee ligament damage at Derby County on his comeback game, towards the end of the 2005‚Äì06 season. He signed a new one-year deal in June 2006, with the club having an additional one-year option. In June 2007, Morris was released by Millwall. Morris then had a brief trial period at Charlton Athletic, and trained with League Two side Brentford, in a bid to earn himself a contract at the West London club. Morris signed for Scottish side St Johnstone, then in the First Division, on a short-term deal at the end of February 2008, playing under Derek McInnes, his former teammate at Millwall during the 2006‚Äì07 season. He scored a goal on his debut against Dundee. He played in the club's Scottish Cup semi-final defeat to Rangers in April 2008 but was one of two Saints players to miss in the penalty shoot-out. After a successful five months at McDiarmid Park, Morris signed a two-year deal with the Perth side at the end of the season. He was part of the title-winning team that in May 2009 gained promotion to the Scottish Premier League after a seven-year absence. Morris signed a new contract with Saints in October 2009, while Derek McInnes praised his influence on the squad. After McInnes left St Johnstone to manage Bristol City in October 2011, Morris assisted caretaker manager Alec Cleland with the coaching of the squad. Morris signed a one-year contract with Bristol City in June 2012, reuniting him with Derek McInnes. Morris had his contract terminated with Bristol City on 31 January 2013 having only made four league appearances for the club. Coaching career =Chelsea= In the 2013‚Äì14 season Morris returned to Chelsea, initially to help coach the Under-21 squad. He was then an assistant coach of the Under-18 team, and moved to head coach of the team for the 2016‚Äì17 season. The team won the FA Youth Cup for the fifth successive time in 2018. Morris returned to the club in July 2019 as part of the first-team coaching staff following the appointment of Frank Lampard as head coach. =Derby County= In May 2018, Morris became assistant to former Chelsea teammate Frank Lampard at Derby County. Their first game in charge was a 2‚Äì1 win over Reading, thanks to a last-minute winner from Tom Lawrence. On 25 September, Derby knocked Premier League team Manchester United out of the EFL Cup at Old Trafford on penalties, following a 2‚Äì2 draw. At the end of the season, Derby qualified for the Championship play-offs after coming sixth in the league. In the semi-finals, they overturned a 1‚Äì0 loss at home to Leeds United in the first leg with a 4‚Äì2 win at Elland Road in the second that gave them a 4‚Äì3 aggregate win. This took them to the final against Aston Villa, which Derby lost 2‚Äì1. Legal issues In November 2002, Morris, along with fellow footballers John Terry and Des Byrne, were cleared of a charge of affray in relation to an incident at a night club. In 2006, Morris drove down a one-way street the wrong way while three times over the drink-drive limit. This resulted in a driving ban for four years, 80 hours of community service and a two-year suspended jail sentence.

They are noted for predominantly using synthesizers and are often branded as electropop or synthpop. They have played live regularly since 2002 and over the years their shows have included science lectures, illuminated labcoats, giant perspex bottom-plugs and slide projections. They were signed to Truck Records in 2004 and released their second album, Raise The Stakes, in April 2007. History Trademark was formed around the time of 1995 by two teenage cousins Oliver Horton and Stuart Meads. They had previously played music together as children, under the names The Sheep and Technobeat. By their mid teens they wanted to formulate themselves as a group. In 1999 the pair were joined by Paul Soulsby. A successful gig at the 2002 Truck Festival (where Trademark were noted as being the only band without guitars) led to a series of performances in Oxford. The band also played regularly in London, with a few appearances at The Fan Club at The Verge in Kentish Town. As the band's reputation grew, Trademark supported Chicks on Speed at Oxford Zodiac, and The Human League at Ocean in London. \\"Fear : Disconnnection\\" was finished in January 2003, and was sold by the band at gigs and over the website. In January 2004, the band followed this up by self releasing \\"This is Our Trademark\\", an EP with a set of five tracks. This led to them being signed by Truck Records, and the putting together of Want More which featured tracks from \\"Fear:Disconnnection\\" and \\"This is Our Trademark\\" plus a few new tracks. Want More was released in June 2004 to the critical acclaim of The Sunday Times among others. In December 2004 Trademark went on tour with the Human League around the UK. At the start of 2005 they started recording the follow- up to Want More. The recording took eighteen months to complete as the band wanted to explore new production techniques and instrumentations. During this time the band continued to gig in the UK, and recording was finally completed in May 2006. Due to complications with arranging distribution and PR, the album, Raise the Stakes, was eventually released in April 2007. Founder member Stuart Meads died in an accident in 2013. The original Audiologue album was remastered and reissued on 30 August 2019 as a '20th Anniversary Remaster', available as a download and limited edition (100 copies) CD. Trademark have produced remixes for other artists in addition to their usual work. Artists include Matinee Club (formerly the Modern), Boy Kill Boy, Cas Fox, Goldrush and Kish Mauve.

Peukert taught modern history at the University of Essen and served as director of the Research Institute for the History of the Nazi Period. Peukert was a member of the German Communist Party until 1978, when he joined the Social Democratic Party of Germany. A politically engaged historian, Peukert was known for his unconventional take on modern German history, and in an obituary, the British historian Richard Bessel wrote that it was a major loss that Peukert had died at the age of 39 as a result of AIDS. Working class history Peukert was born in a working-class family in the Ruhr, his father a coal miner and his mother a housewife, and he was the first member of his family to attend university. Many of his father's fellow coal miners had been members of either the SPD or KPD, and were sent to concentration camps during the Nazi era. Growing up in the coal miners' milieu, where many so had been sent to concentration camps for anti-Nazi views, left Peukert very interested in the subject of outsiders in the Third Reich, as he wanted to know why so many coal miners chose to oppose the Nazi regime when so many other ordinary people were passive, indifferent or supportive of the Nazi regime. The coal miners of the Ruhr formed a distinctive sub-culture in Germany, known for their defiant, rebellious attitude to authority, left-wing views, and their often confrontational relations with the firm of Krupp AG, Germany's biggest corporation, which in turn was owned by the Krupp family, Germany's richest family. As a student, Peukert studied under Hans Mommsen at Bochum university, and began teaching at the University of Essen starting in 1978. As a \\"68er\\" whose politics were defined by the student protests of 1968, Peukert was active in left-wing politics and joined the German Communist Party. The historian Michael Zimmermann who knew Peukert as an undergraduate in the early 1970s described Peukert as active in the student federation MSP Spartakus and the KDP, but described him as a committed Communist who grew disillusioned following the expulsions of Rudolf Bahro and Wolf Biermann together with the \\"freeze\\" on discussing Euro-communism within the party following orders from East Germany. Peukert's writings on German Communist resistance in Nazi Germany differed greatly from the party line laid down in East Germany that the entire German working class under the KPD had opposed the Nazi regime, and ultimately led to him leaving the Communist Party in 1978 to join the Social Democratic party. The KDP was secretly subsidized by East Germany and as a result, the party was slavishly loyal to its East German paymasters. Peukert during his time in the Communist party had come to find the party line on history was too dogmatic and rigid as he kept finding the facts of history were more complex and nuanced than the version of history laid by the party line. Peukert's work was criticized within Communist circles for his willingness to be critical of the decisions of the underground KPD in Nazi Germany, and his sensitivity to \\"human frailty\\" as he examined working class life in the Third Reich, writing that not everybody wanted to be a hero and die for their beliefs. Peukert's first book was his 1976 book Ruhrarbeiter gegen den Faschismus (Ruhr Workers Against Fascism), a study of anti-Nazi activities among the working class of the Ruhr during the Third Reich. Reflecting his left-wing views, Peukert praised \\"our red grandfathers\\" who chose to oppose National Socialism, despite their downtrodden status, arguing that their willingness to take action when so many were passive or supportive of National Socialism, made them heroes. Peukert's PhD thesis, published in 1980, was Die KPD im Widerstand Verfolgung und Untergrundarbeit am Rhein und Ruhr, 1933-1945 (The KPD in the Resistance Persecution and Underground work in the Rhine and the Ruhr 1933-1945). Peukert's work went beyond what the title of his PhD dissertation would suggest, as he examined the ideological motivation, organizational structure of the underground Communist Party, and the motivation and social background of a single individual Communist in the Ruhr and Rhineland convicted by German courts of belonging to the KPD. Peukert's work on the Communist resistance led him to engage in many bitter, polemical disputes with his former associates in the Communist Party who did not like his conclusions. From the right, criticism of Die KPD im Widerstand Verfolgung und Untergrundarbeit am Rhein und Ruhr, 1933-1945 came from the American historian Albert Lindemann who complained that Peukert's focus on Communist resistance in the Rhineland and Ruhr regions did not merit a 460-page long book, though Lindemann wrote that wrote the book was not \\"an exercise in hagiography\\" and praised Peukert for his \\"critical remarks\\" about East German historiography. On the broader subject of Communism, Lindemann wrote that Peukert's book was flawed by what the reviewer considered his moral blind spot, writing that for Peukert fascism was \\"a convenient absolute evil; anti-fascism, however flawed in its particulars is thus in some ultimate sense heroic\\". Lindemann wrote that \\"the author [Peukert] appears to consider it absurd to suggest the KPD and the NSDAP morally resembled each other. Yet Stalinism in the 1930s was at least as brutish in form as Hitlerism and was responsible, at least until 1939, for many more deaths, indeed for organized murder on an unparalleled scale. The KPD enthusiastically associated itself with the nightmarish inhumanities of Stalin's rule\\". Lindemann ended his review that Peukert's approach in considering Communist resistance in Nazi Germany to be \\"heroic\\" was wrong as the subject of \\"Communist heroism\\" in Nazi Germany was more morally nuanced than what Peukert would consider. Historian of Alltagsgeschichte in the Third Reich Peukert was a leading expert in Alltagsgeschichte (\\"history of everyday life\\") and his work often examined the effect of Nazi social policies on ordinary Germans and on persecuted groups such as Jews and Roma. The subject of Alltagsgeschichte had first been established as a subject in the 1970s, and had first attracted attention when Martin Broszat and his prot√©g√©s launched the \\"Bavaria project\\" in 1973, intended to document everyday life in Bavaria in the Third Reich. Broszat had begun the study of Alltagsgeschichte in the early 1970s with two goals. The first was to counter what Broszat considered to be the excessively \\"from above\\" high politics approach to writing about Nazi Germany which largely saw the story of the Third Reich by looking at the actions of Hitler and the rest of the Nazi elite and treating almost everybody else in Germany as merely passive objects controlled and manipulated by the state. Broszat wanted to treat the German people as subjects in their own lives during the Nazi era, making choices in their everyday lives, both for good and ill, albeit within a reduced range. The second goal of Broszat with Alltagsgeschichte was to end the \\"monumentalization\\" of the men involved in the July 20 putsch in 1944, with Broszat complaining treated the story of resistance in Nazi Germany as one of few conservatives from the traditional elites in the aristocracy, the military, the bureaucracy, and the diplomatic corps struggling to overthrow the Nazi regime. Broszat wished to examine resistance by ordinary people at least in part to show there was resistance other than those involved in the 20 July putsch attempt. Peukert admitted to being influenced by Broszat's work with the \\"Bavaria Project\\", but he gave another reason for becoming interested in alltagsgeschichte in 1979. In January 1979, the 1978 American TV mini- series Holocaust was shown in West Germany and caused a sensation, being watched by 50% of West Germans. The airing of Holocaust marked the first time that many Germans born after 1945 had learned about the Holocaust, which was something of a taboo subject for the first decades after 1945. Writing in 1981, Peukert wrote: > \\"Looking back, people's own everyday experience seemed to have been so > different that they could not find themselves in the picture which > historians painted, because in their remembrance the everyday life situation > was often viewed positively. Even for those who strove for a critical coming > to terms [Bew√§ltigung] with their experience of repression, of yielding to > the temptations of the regime and of involvement with criminal inhumanity, > even they often remained at loss about how to build a bridge from their own > experience to the contemporary historical critical state of knowledge\\". In the early 1980s, Peukert began teaching Alltagsgeschichte, until then a subject mostly ignored by German historians before the 1970s, as he argued that the subject was important. Peukert wanted to explore why so many ordinary Germans who lived through the Nazi era remembered it as a time of \\"normality\\" and often in a very positive way while at the same time genocide was taking place. Peukert argued there was a disconnect between the popular image today of the Nazi era as a time of unparalleled horror vs. the way in which most ordinary Germans remembered it as a time of benign \\"normality\\", and that studying Alltagsgeschichte would explore what the Third Reich was actually like in \\"everyday life\\". In the early 1980s, Alltagsgeschichte exploded in popularity in West Germany with numerous work groups being set, usually by left-wing groups, to explore the history of their home towns in the Nazi era. The study of Alltagsgeschichte was greatly influenced by the History Workshop movement in Britain set up by the Marxist historian E.P. Thompson and like the British Workshop groups, many involved in the Alltagsgeschichte study groups were not historians with a disproportional number of the volunteers being high-school students. The American historian Mary Nolan wrote with some envy about the way in which thousands of German high school students became involved in the Alltagsgeschichte study groups, observing that it was simply inconceivable that thousands of American high school students would join study groups to research the histories of their home towns in the 1930s-1940s as most Americans have no interest in history. In 1984, Peukert was awarded the annual culture prize given by the city of Essen for his work with a history workshop group in Essen. A historian with a very strong work ethic, Peukert believed that history \\"belonged to everybody\\", not just the historians, and was very energetic in attempting to break down barriers to interest the public in history by settling up exhibitions about Alltagsgeschichte in the Third Reich. In 1980, Peukert planned the historical exhibition at the Old Synagogue of Essen on the subject \\"Resistance and Persecution in Essen 1933-1945\\". In 1984, Peukert won the Maeier-Leibnitz prize for his habilitation on youth policy in Germany in late 19th and early 20th centuries. Moving beyond the subject of resistance (Widerstand), Peukert became interested in \\"oppositionality\\" (Widerst√§ndigkeit) in everyday life in Nazi Germany. Peukert was especially interested in the Edelweiss Pirates, a group of working class teenagers in Cologne and the other cities of the Rhineland who formed a distinctive anti-Nazi subculture, and who often fought the Hitler Youth. Another related area of interest for Peukert was resistance, opposition and dissent in the Third Reich. Peukert developed a pyramid model starting with \\"nonconformity\\" (behavior in private that featured partial rejection of the Nazi regime) running to \\"refusal of co-operation\\" (Verweigerung) to \\"protest\\", and finally to Widerstand (resistance), which involved total rejection of the Nazi regime. In particular, Peukert looked at how in \\"everyday life\\" in Nazi Germany, aspects of both \\"normality\\" and \\"criminality\\" co-existed with another. For Peukert, to examine resistance and opposition in Alltagsgeschichte with no reference to the broader society led the historian no-where, and to resolve this problem he wrote his 1982 book Volksgenossen und Gemeinschaftsfremde (National Comrades and Community Aliens), which was translated into English as Inside Nazi Germany in 1987. The book's title was taken from the two legal categories which the entire population of Germany was divided into during the Nazi era; the Volksgenossen (National Comrades) who were the people who belonged to the Volksgemeinschaft and the gemeinschaftsfremde (Community Aliens) who did not. In Volksgenossen und Gemeinschaftsfremde, Peukert looked at the experience of \\"everyday life\\" in Nazi Germany in its totality, examining both conformity and resistance equally to examine how all Germans, not just those in sub-cultures like the Edelweiss Pirates or the Ruhr miners had behaved. Peukert also sought to critically explore why so many ordinary Germans remembered the Third Reich as a time of blissful normality, arguing that there was a certain selectivity to what many people sought to remember, arguing that memories of genocide were not ones to cherish. Peukert further argued that: \\"the memory of an unpolitical \\"normality\\" in the 1930s could have taken hold of the collective memory also because of a certain structural parallelism existed because of the \\"normality\\" of the first German economic miracle in the 1930s and the economic miracle of the 1950s\\". Peukert argued that the central feature of the policies of the National Socialist regime in shaping the Volksgemeinschaft was racism with the emphasis on \\"selection\\" of those considered to have \\"healthy\\" Aryan genes and the \\"eradication\\" of those who were considered not. In the final chapter of Volksgenossen und Gemeinschaftsfremde, Peukert wrote: \\"In the use of terror against gemeinschaftsfremde (\\"community aliens\\") and in the fostering of an atomized, compulsorily normalized society, National Socialism demonstrated all too clearly and with lethal consistency the pathological, warped features of the modern civilization process\\". As Inside Nazi Germany as the book was titled in English, Volksgenossen und Gemeinschaftsfremde is regarded as the most \\"standard\\" text about alltagsgeschichte in the Third Reich. A 1990 review by the German historian Rolf Sch√∂rken called Volksgenossen und Gemeinschaftsfremde a brilliant book explaining how Nazi Herrschaft (domination) of Germany rested upon the \\"multi-layered, contradictory and complex realities\\" of \\"everyday life\\" in Germany. Peukert wrote that the popular claim, made after the war, that the Nazi regime stayed in power only because of terror was incorrect. Peukert wrote though terror played a role in sustaining the Nazi regime, the majority of victims of the violence of that the German state inflicted in the Nazi era tended to be people considered to be \\"outsiders\\" in Germany like Jews, the Romany, \\"Marxists\\", the mentally ill, the disabled, homosexuals, Jehovah's Witnesses, and the \\"asocial\\", and that for the most part, the state in the Nazi era left ordinary Germans alone to live their lives as they pleased. Peukert wrote with the \\"popular experience\\" of most Germans in the Nazi era, there were no clear-cut \\"villains and victims\\" with the American historian David Crew writing that Peukert had presented \\"a complex, morally disturbing picture\\" of ordinary people adjusting to what Peukert called \\"the multiple ambiguities of ordinary people\\". Peukert wrote that most ordinary Germans lived in a \\"grey zone\\" choosing support, accommodation and nonconformity at various times, never totally supporting the Nazi regime, but willing to accommodate themselves to the regime provided it served their own self-interests. As part of his studies into \\"everyday life\\" in Nazi Germany, Peukert very strongly argued that it was not a black-and- white picture with many of those taking part in youthful sub-cultures like the Edelweiss Pirates and the Swing Kids, grumbling at work, and attending illegal jazz dance sessions at very least partially endorsed the regime and accepted the \\"Hitler myth\\" of a brilliant, benevolent F√ºhrer. Peukert noted those who took part in such manifestations of \\"oppositionality\\" like the Swing Kids and the Edelweiss Pirates were challenging the regime, but not in such a way as to threaten its hold on power, which is why Peukert called these activities \\"oppositionality\\" rather than resistance. In particular, Peukert wrote the Edelweiss Pirates by settling themselves apart from adults and those not from the Rhineland were in fact weakening the traditional German working class sub- culture. Peukert wrote: > \\"The Third Reich cannot have failed to leave its mark on all members of > society...Even resistance fighters who did not conform were weighted by the > experience of persecution, by the sense of their own impotence, and of the > petty compromises that were necessary for survival. The system did its work > on the anti-fascists too, and often enough it worked despite the > shortcomings of the fascists themselves\\". Peukert wrote that even those Germans who went into \\"inner emigration\\", withdrawing from society as much as possible to avoid dealing with the Nazis as much as they could, helped the system worked. Peukert wrote that \\"inner emigration\\" led to \\"...self-absorption and self-sufficiency, to the mixture of \\"apathy and pleasure-seeking\\" described by one wartime diarist...Paradoxically, then, even the population's counter-reaction to the National Socialist pressure of mobilization served to stabilize the system\\". Using a phrase coined by the British historian Sir Ian Kershaw, Peukert argued that the \\"Hitler myth\\" of a brilliant, infallible, and larger-than-life F√ºhrer-a charismatic statesman who was also a talented general and artist-was the main psychological mechanism that held together popular support and acquiescence in the regime as even many Germans who did not like the Nazis accepted the \\"Hitler myth\\". Peukert noted that Hitler's role in standing in many ways above his system, with the standard explanation being that der F√ºhrer was so busy with questions of war, art and statecraft that he had to delegate policy in the domestic sphere to his subordinates meant that most Germans did not blame the failures of the Nazi system on Hitler. Peukert noted that instead of blaming Hitler, most Germans held to the hope that if only der F√ºhrer would pay attention to domestic policy, then matters would be set right. Peukert argued that many Germans disliked the NSDAP functionaries who assumed such power in their neighborhoods and believed if only their \\"abuses\\" were brought to Hitler's attention, he would dismiss them. In common with many historians, Peukert noted that the \\"Hitler myth\\" of a superhuman F√ºhrer who was steadily making Germany into the world's greatest power first began to fall apart with the German defeat at the Battle of Stalingrad as Hitler had staked his personal prestige on a victory on the Volga, repeatedly stating in his radio speeches in the fall of 1942 that he was executing his master-plan for victory at Stalingrad. The fact that Hitler's \\"master-plan\\" for victory at Stalingrad instead ended with the destruction of the entire German 6th Army, made worse by the fact that it was the hands of the \\"Asiatic hordes\\" as Nazi propaganda always called the Red Army, was a terrible blow to Hitler's prestige, but even then the \\"Hitler myth\\" continued to exert it power, albeit in a diluted form . Against the traditional view that the \\"Hitler myth\\" came \\"from above\\", being the work of Joseph Goebbels's Propaganda Ministry, Peukert argued that the \\"Hitler myth\\" came just as much \\"from below\\" as ordinary people chose to invest their hopes in the \\"Hitler myth\\" as a way of rationalizing their passivity in the Third Reich. Another interest for Peukert were the experiences of youth in the Imperial, Weimar and Nazi era. In two books, Grenzen der Sozialdiziplinierung Austieg und Krise der deutschen Jugendf√ºrsorge von 1878 bis 1932 (The Frontiers of Social Discipline The Rise and Crisis of German Youth 1878 to 1932) and its sequel, Jugend zwischen Krieg und Krise Lebenswetlen von Arbeiterjungen in der Weimarer Republik (Youth Between War and Crisis The World of Working Class Boys in the Weimar Republic), Peukert examined how the concept of jugendlicher (\\"youth\\") changed from the 19th into the 20th centuries and how the state sought to dominate the lives of youth people via education and mandatory activities. Both books were part of Peukert' habilitation, and reflected his lifelong interest in the experiences of young people in the Imperial, Weimar and Nazi eras. Peukert was one of the first historians to make a detailed examination of the persecution of the Romani. Peukert often compared Nazi policies towards Roma with Nazi policies towards Jews. On the basis of his research into popular attitudes towards \\"outsiders\\" in the Third Reich, Peukert came up with the concept of \\"everyday racism\\" to explain the contrast between the \\"normality\\" of life for most Germans while genocide was being committed. By \\"everyday racism\\", Peukert meant a certain causal racism that allowed people to accept violence being committed against those considered to be different. Peukert wrote about: \\"a fatal continuum of discrimination, selection, and rejection/elimination, whose monstrous consequences perhaps remained hidden from most contemporaries in their totality but whose inhumane daily racism was not only constantly and everywhere present but until today has not been critically worked through\\". As part of his research into \\"everyday racism\\", Peukert explored how ordinary people use of disparaging language to describe the homeless allowed them to see as justified the mass incarceration of the homeless into the concentration camps under the grounds that the homeless were part of the \\"asocial\\" threatening the volksgemeinschaft. In his research into opinion during the war years, Peukert noted that thousands of Polish and Frenchmen were brought to work in Germany as slave laborers to replace German men who been called up into the Wehrmacht. Those Poles and sometimes Frenchmen found to be enjoying sexual relationships with German women were harshly punished, being publicity hanged and on some occasions castrated as \\"race-defilers\\" threatening the Volksgemeinschaft. Peukert noted even through the Volksgemeinschaft as depicted in Nazi propaganda never really existed, many ordinary Germans if not sharing the exactly the same racial ideology as their regime seemed to approve of these executions as necessary to protect German racial purity. As a homosexual, Peukert was especially interested in the Nazi persecution of homosexuals. As a gay man, Peukert was especially troubled by those who used the homosexuality of Nazi leaders like Ernst R√∂hm as an excuse for homophobia, writing: > \\"The National Socialists' fundamental hostility to homosexuals should not be > trivialized by references to individual Nazi leaders' homosexuality. The > disgraceful denunciation of SA leader Ernst R√∂hm, precisely by the Social > Democratic press, to gain votes in 1930, thus sullying its own liberal > tradition, was taken up again after the so-called R√∂hm putsch of 1934 and > used by the National Socialists to justify their murderous actions\\". Another interest of Peukert were the youth movements like the Swing Kids and the Edelweiss Pirates that clashed with the Nazi regime. The American historian Peter Baldwin criticized Peukert for treating the Swing Kids and Edelweiss Pirates sent to concentration camps as morally just as much as victims of the National Socialist regime as the Jews exterminated in the death camps. Baldwin took Peukert to task for his 1987 statement: \\"As long as the Nazis needed armament workers and future soldiers, they could not exterminate German youth as they exterminated the Poles and Jews\\". Baldwin called this statement \\"a wholly fanciful suggestion\\" that the Nazi leaders were planning to exterminate the young people of Germany, going on to comment that the reader should \\"note also the order of priority among the actual victims\\". Baldwin wrote that \\"This is Reagan's Bitburg fallacy of the SS as victims, this time committed from the Left\\". In 1985, the U.S. president Ronald Reagan had taken part in a memorial ceremony at a cemetery in Bitburg whose graves were those of soldiers killed in the Wehrmacht and Waffen-SS. When criticized for honoring the sacrifice of SS men, Reagan had stated those Germans killed fighting in the SS were just as much victims of Hitler as the Jews exterminated in the death camps, and that therefore placing a memorial wreath honoring the memory of the SS men buried at the Bitburg cemetery was no different from placing a memorial wreath at Auschwitz. Reagan's statement that the SS and the Jews exterminated by the SS were all equally victims of Hitler is known to historians as the Bitburg fallacy. In his 1987 book Spuren des Widerstands Die Bergarbeiterbewegung im Dritten Reich und im Exil (Traces of Resistance The Miners' Movement in the Third Reich and In Exile), Peukert began with the question \\"How does one write a history of continual failure?\\", which he answered with \\"To write a history of the resistance from the \\"loser's\\" viewpoint means trying to understand why, in spite of everything, they did not give up\\". Peukert argued even through the Social Democratic and Communist miners failed utterly in their attempts to overthrow the Nazi dictatorship, their willingness to take a stand, no matter how hopeless, and to suffer for their beliefs in the concentration camps meant that they should not be dismissed by historians as \\"losers\\". In the late 1980s, Peukert had been working on a project for a comprehensive alltagsgeschichte in Nazi Germany in northern Germany that was intended to be the counterpart to the \\"Bavaria project\\" led by Martin Broszat that sought to produce a comprehensive alltagsgeschichte in Nazi Germany in Bavaria. Problems of modernity In his 1982 book Volksgenossen und Gemeinschaftsfremde (National Comrades and Community Aliens), Peukert argued that the Nazi regime's: > \\"racism offered a model for a new order in society...It rested on the > racially legitimated removal of all elements that deviated from the norm, > refractory youth, idlers, the asocial, prostitutes, homosexuals, people who > were incompetent or failures at work, the disabled. National Socialist > eugenics...laid down criteria of assessment that were applicable to the > population at whole\\". Peukert described the aim of National Socialism as: > ‚ÄúThe goal was an utopian Volksgemeinschaft, totally under police > surveillance, in which any attempt at nonconformist behaviour, or even any > hint or intention of such behaviour, would be visited with terror‚Äù. At the same time, Peukert argued that the v√∂lkisch ideology was not \\"an inexplicable, sudden appearance of 'medieval barbarism' in a progressive society\\" but rather \\"demonstrated with heightened clarity and murderous consistency, the pathologies and seismic fractures of the modern civilizing progress\\". Peukert's thesis that all aspects of the National Socialist regime reflected the v√∂lkisch ideology and that far from being a break with modernity, that the National Socialism regime represented at very least an aspect of modernity was very novel at the time and proved to be influential on the historiography of Nazi Germany. Fascinated by the theories of Max Weber, Peukert began his last book with a quote from Weber who warned that the modern age would bring about \\"experts without spirit\\" and the \\"hedonist without a heart\\". Peukert went on to write about this modern age: > \\"At its beginning there is immense loneliness and religious distress, which > however help to bring about an unsuspected enhancement of the individual's > attachment to this life, his rational control of the world and intellectual > autonomy; at its end we may find routine \\"enslavement to the future\\", > emptied of all meaning and causing the dynamic, expansive force of > rationalization to ossify. In both cases, however, the growing pressure of > suffering is the price paid for the gain in rationality\\". For Peukert, inspired by the theories of Weber, saw the purpose of his work to help foster experts who have spirit and hedonists with a heart.Through Peukert worked primarily as a historian (an occupation that has far greater prestige in Germany than it does in the English-speaking world), he also wrote about at times about literacy theory, philosophy, and anthropology. Peukert was also politically engaged, and his last essay written shortly before his death, Rechtsradikalismus in historisher Perspektive (Right-wing Radicalism in the Historical Perspective) warned against the rise of the Republican Party led by the former SS-Unterscharf√ºhrer Franz Sch√∂nhuber, which had some popular support in Germany with its call for a ban on Turkish \\"guest workers\\". In 1988, Peukert was appointed director of the Research Center for the History of National Socialism at Hamburg University and in 1989 was appointed Chair of Modern History at the University of Essen. The attempt to appoint Peukert to Hamburg University caused much opposition from the more conservative historians, who made it clear they did not want an openly gay man teaching at their university. Until 1994, Paragraph 175 was still in effect in Germany as homophobia was rampant in Germany long after the end of the Third Reich, and many historians did not want to work with a \\"criminal\\" like Peukert. One of the central issues of German historiography has been the debate over the Sonderweg question, namely whatever German history in the 19th and 20th centuries developed along such lines as to make the Third Reich inevitable. The \\"Bielefeld School\\" associated with Hans-Ulrich Wehler, Jurgen Kocka and others have argued for a failed modernization of Germany with the Junkers holding inordinate political and social power in the 19th century that led to Nazi Germany in the 20th century. The most famous riposte to the Sonderweg thesis was the 1984 book The Peculiarities of German history by two British Marxist historians, David Blackbourn and Geoff Eley. In The Peculiarities of German History, Eley and Blackourn argued for the \\"normality\\" of modern German history. Peukert rejected both viewpoints, instead arguing for seeing Nazi Germany as the product of the \\"crisis of classical modernity\\". One of the central objections to the \\"normality\\" thesis promoted by Eley and Blackbourn has been if Germany was such a \\"normal\\" and \\"modern\\" nation, how does one explain the Holocaust? Though Peukert rejected the Sonderweg thesis, he criticized Eley and Blackbourn for associating modernity with \\"progress\\", and argued for a \\"skeptical de-coupling of modernity and progress\\". Peukert argued that historians must: > \\"raise questions about the pathological and seismic fractures within > modernity itself, and about the implicit destructive tendencies of modern > industrial class society, which National Socialism made explicit and which > elevated it into mass destruction...This approach is supported by a wide > variety of debates that have gone within the social sciences, using such > notions as 'social disciplining' (Foucault), the pathological consequences > of the civilizing progress (Elias), or the colonisation of the Lebenswelten > (Habermas). Peukert often wrote on the social and cultural history of the Weimar Republic whose problems he saw as more severe examples of the problems of modernity. Peukert argued that societies that have reached \\"classical modernity\\" are characterized by advanced capitalist economic organization and mass production, by the \\"rationalization\\" of culture and society, massive bureaucratization of society, the \\"spirit of science\\" assuming a dominant role in popular discourses, and the \\"social disciplining\\" and \\"normalization\\" of the majority of ordinary people. Peukert was greatly influenced by the theories of Max Weber, but unlike many other scholars, who saw Weber attempting to rebut Karl Marx, he viewed Weber's principal intellectual opponent as Friedrich Nietzsche. Peukert wrote that for Weber, the principal problems of modern Germany were: *The increasing \\"rationalization\\" of everyday life via bureaucratization and secularism had led to a \\"complete demystification of the world\\". *The popularity of the \\"spirit of science\\" had led to a misguided belief that science could solve all problems within the near-future. Contrary to the \\"Bielefield school\\", Peukert argued by the time of the Weimar Republic, Germany had broken decisively with the past, and had become a thoroughly \\"modern\\" society in all its aspects. Peukert argued that the very success of German modernization inspired by the \\"dream of reason\\" meant the contradictions and problems of \\"classical modernity\\" were felt more acutely in Germany than elsewhere. For Peukert, the problems of \\"classical modernity\\" were: *The very success of modernization encourages \\"utopian\\" hopes that all problems can be solved via the \\"spirit of science\\" that are inevitably dashed. *Modern society causes unavoidable \\"irritations\\" which led to people looking backwards to \\"traditions\\" and/or a \\"clean\\" modernity where the state would attempt to solve social problems via radical means. *The \\"demystification of the world\\" leads people to seek faith and self-validation either via irrational theories such as \\"race\\" and/or a charismatic leader who would revitalize society. *Modernity creates a mass society that can be more easily manipulated and mobilized to ends that can be either moral or amoral. Peukert argued that starting in 1929 that the disjoint between Weimar democracy vs. the problems of \\"classical modernity\\" started to fell apart when faced with the Great Depression. Peukert maintained that the Weimar Republic was a muddled system built out of the compromises between so many different interests with for instance Weimar Coalition consisting of the left-wing SPD, the liberal DDP, and the centre-right Zentrum being the only political parties wholeheartedly committed to the Weimar republic. Other competing interests in Germany included the struggle between men vs. women, farmers vs. towns, Catholics vs. Protestants, and unions vs. business. Peukert argued that the creation of the Weimar welfare state in the 1920s had \\"politicized\\" economic and social relationships, and in the context of the Great Depression where economic resources were shrinking set off a Darwinian struggle for scare economic resources between various societal groups. Peukert wrote by 1930 German society had with the notable exceptions of the working class and the Catholic milieus had turned into a mass of competing social interests engaged in a Darwinian verteilungskampf (distribution struggle). In this context, Peukert argued that for much of German society, some sort of authoritarian government was welcome out of the belief that an authoritarian regime would favor one's own special interest group at the expense of the others. Given the verteilungskampf, Peukert argued that this explain why the \\"presidential governments\\"-which from March 1930 onward by-passed the Reichstag and that answered only to President Paul von Hindenburg-governing Germany in a highly authoritarian manner were so approved of by German elites. Peukert further maintained that the Hitler government of 1933, which was the last of the \\"presidential governments\\" was merely the final attempt by traditional elites in Germany to safeguard their status. Peukert insisted that National Socialism was not some retrogression to the past, but instead reflected the \\"dark side\\" of modernity, writing: \\"The NSDAP was at once a symptom and a solution to the crisis\\". Peukert saw his work as a \\"warning against the fallacious notion that the normality of industrial society is harmless\\" and urged historians to consider the \\"dark side of modernity\\", instead of seeing modernity as a benign development that was always for the best. Peukert wrote: > \\"The view that National Socialism was...one of the pathological development > forms of modernity does not imply that barbarism is the inevitable logical > outcome of modernization. The point, rather, is that we should not analyse > away the tensions between progressive and aberrant features by making a glib > opposition between modernity and tradition: we should call attention to the > rifts and danger-zones which result from the civilizing process itself, so > that the opportunities for human emancipation which it simultaneously > creates can be more thoroughly charted. The challenges of Nazism shows that > the evolution to modernity is not a one-way trip to freedom. The struggle > for freedom must always be resumed afresh, both in inquiry and in action\\". Peukert argued that though v√∂lkisch racism was extreme, it was by no means exceptional, and instead reflected the logic promoted by the social sciences throughout the West which had argued that the state can and should foster \\"normality\\" while identifying \\"the non-conformity that is to be segregated and eliminated\\". Seen in this perspective, for Peukert the genocide against the Jews and Romany were only part of a wider project to eliminate all unhealthy genes from the volksgemeinschaft. Peukert argued for an integrated view of Nazi Germany with the social policies to encourage \\"healthy Aryan\\" families to have more children, the \\"social racism\\" that saw the bodies of \\"healthy Aryan\\" women as belonging to the volksgemeinschaft, the effort to sterilize \\"anti- social families\\" and the extermination of Jews and Romany as part and parcel of the same project. Likewise, Peukert argued that Nazi Germany was not some freakish \\"aberration\\" from the norms of Western civilization, as he noted that the ideas about eugenics and racial superiority that the National Socialists drew upon were widely embraced throughout the Western world. In the same way, Peukert noted in Inside Nazi Germany as part of his argument against the \\"freakish aberration\\" view of the Nazi era that homosexual sex had been made illegal in Germany with Paragraph 175 in 1871 and all the Nazis did with the 1935 version of Paragraph 175 was to make it tougher, as the 1935 version of Paragraph 175 made being homosexual in and of itself a criminal offense, whereas the 1871 version of Paragraph 175 had only made homosexual sex a criminal offense. Peukert also noted against the \\"freakish aberration\\" view of Nazi Germany that the 1935 version of Paragraph 175 stayed on the statue books in West Germany until 1969 as it was considered to be a \\"healthy law\\", leading to German homosexuals who survived the concentration camps continuing to be convicted all through the 1950s and 1960s under exactly the same law that sent them to the concentration camps under the Third Reich. Peukert further commented that the Federal Republic of Germany never paid reparations to those homosexuals who survived the concentration camps as Paragraph 175 was considered a \\"healthy law\\" that was worth keeping, and those homosexual survivors who suffered so much in the concentration camps remained outcasts in post-war Germany. Writing in the 1970s and 1980s at a time when Paragraph 175 was still in effect, Peukert argued that the sort of homophobia which made the Nazi persecution of homosexuals possible, was still very much present in modern West Germany. In the same way, Peukert wrote the \\"everyday racism\\" that allowed ordinary people to accept violence directed against \\"others\\" in the Third Reich had not disappeared, noting that many ordinary Germans were willing to accept neo-Nazi skinheads beating up Turkish guest workers because they were \\"foreigners\\". Crew writing in 1992 wrote that the \\"recent epidemic of violence against 'foreigners' in both the 'old' and 'new' L√§nder suggests he may have been right\\". Peukert wrote that though the Nazis did use an \\"anti- modernist\\" disclosure inspired by the theories of Houston Stewart Chamberlain, their solution to the problems of \\"classical modernity\\" were not \\"merely backward-looking\\". Peukert wrote the attempt to create the volksgemeinschaft was not an effort to return to the pre‚Äîindustrial age, but rather a purged and cleansed \\"classical modernity\\". Peukert wrote: \\"Eclectic as regards to ideas, but up to date in its attitude to technology, National Socialism laid claims to offer a \\"conclusive\\" new answer to the challenges and discomforts of the modern age\\". Peukert wrote that: \\"The much heralded Volksgemeinschaft of the National Socialists in no way abolished the real contradictions of a modern industrial society; rather these were inadvertently aggravated by the use of highly modern industrial and propaganda techniques for achieving war readiness. In fact, the long-term characteristics of a modern industrial society, which had been interrupted by the world economic crisis, continued to run their course\\". Reflecting the influence of functionalist historians like Martin Broszat and Hans Mommsen, Peukert wrote the inability to achieve the idealized volksgemeinschaft of their dreams left the National Socialists increasingly frustrated and led them to lash out against groups considered to be enemies of the volksgemeinschaft as a way of compensation. Peukert argued that for the National Socialists' \\"it was more important to travel hopefully than to arrive\\", as for the Nazis had no solutions to the problems of classical modernity other than a creating a sense of movement towards the vague goal of the utopian society that was to be the volksgemeinschaft. Peukert wrote the \\"violent answers\\" of the Nazis to the \\"contradictions of modernity\\" were not the basis of a successful social order, and as such the dynamism of the Nazi movement was primarily negative and the \\"movement\\" had a strong self-destructive streak. Peukert noted that having promised \\"paradise\\" in the form of the volksgemeinschaft under the Weimar republic, there was much frustration within the Nazi movement when in 1933 the volksgemeinschaft in reality did not meet the idealized version of the volksgemeinschaft that had promised before 1933. Peukert wrote that because of this frustration that the Nazis gave the volksgemeinschaft an increasing negative definition, lashing out in increasing vicious ways against any perceived \\"threats\\" to the volksgemeinschaft. As part of this trend, there was a tendency as the Third Reich went along for the Nazis to seek to erase all nonconformity, deviance and differences from German society with anyone who was not a perfect Volksgenossen (\\"National Comrade\\") considered to be in someway an \\"enemy\\". In this way, the violence that the Nazis had directed against \\"outsiders\\" in Germany had gradually started to be applied against at least some of the previous \\"insiders\\" as those Volksgenossen who for whatever reason did not quite measure up to the ideal found there was no place for them in the volksgemeinschaft. Peukert concluded that the National Socialists failed to create the idealized volksgemeinschaft, but they unwittingly laid the foundations for the stability of the Adenauer era in 1950s West Germany by promoting a mass consumerist society combined with extreme violence against their \\"enemies\\", which made politically engagement dangerous. Peukert argued that what many considered to be the most notable aspect of the Adenauer era, namely an atomized, materialistic society made up of people devoted to consumerism and generally indifferent to politics was the Nazi legacy in West Germany. In the last chapter of his 1987 book Die Weimarer Republik : Krisenjahre der Klassischen Moderne, Peukert quoted Walter Benjamin's remark: \\"The concept of progress must be rooted in catastrophe. The fact that things just \\"carry on\\" is the catastrophe\\". Dominican studies Peukert was fluent in Spanish, and was very interested in the history of Latin America, especially the Dominican Republic, which he spent much of the late 1980s visiting. As the name Detlev is hard for Spanish speakers to pronounce, Peukert took to calling himself \\"Julio\\" Peukert. Peukert was interested in youth policy in the Dominican Republic and spent much time in the barrios (slums) of Santo Domingo working as a volunteer helping poor teenagers. In 1986, Peuket published a book in Spanish Anhelo de Dependencia Las Ofertas de Anexion de la Republica Dominicana a los Estados Unidos en siglo XIX about the debate concerning American plans to annex the Dominican Republic in the 19th century. Always a politically engaged historian, Peukert engaged in city planning for Santo Domingo and criticized the Dominican government for not doing more to help with the problems of poverty. At the time of his death, Peukert had begun writing a biography of the Dominican dictator General Rafael Trujillo. \\"The Genesis of the 'Final Solution‚Äô from the Spirit of Science\\" Peukert is perhaps best known for his 1989 essay ‚ÄúThe Genesis of the 'Final Solution‚Äô from the Spirit of Science‚Äù from his book Max Webers Diagnose der Moderne. Peukert began his essay with an attack on the conservative side in the Historikerstreit, stating that the obsession of Ernst Nolte with proving that Hitler had been somehow forced into committing genocide by the fear of the Soviet Union was an apologistic argument meant to diminish the horror of Auschwitz. Peukert further noted that on the origins of the Holocaust question that the internationalist argument that the \\"Final Solution to the Jewish Question\\" was all part of a master-plan carried out by Hitler and a few of his followers is not longer accepted by most historians with the \\"Final Solution\\" being seen instead as the product of several processes coming together at the same time. Peukert wrote that the Shoah was not the result solely of anti- Semitism, but was instead the a product of the ‚Äúcumulative radicalization‚Äù in which ‚Äúnumerous smaller currents‚Äù fed into the ‚Äúbroad current‚Äù that led to genocide. Peukert wrote the Holocaust was a product of: *the attempt to put into practice the radical theories of v√∂lkisch antisemitism from 1933 onward together with the policy following the beginning of the Second World War of forcibly moving around millions of people. *the Nazi policies of dividing the population into those of genetic \\"value\\" and \\"non-value\\" in terms of education, social policy, health policy and demographics with the theme of \\"selecting\\" those with \\"value\\" over those of \\"non-value\\". *the policies of \\"racial hygiene\\" of sterilizing the \\"genetically unhealthy\\" which was followed up by the Action T4 program launched in January 1939 of killing all mentally and physically disabled Germans, which provided the prototype for the extermination of the Jews. The Action T4 program of killing the disabled marked the first time that an entire group had been selected for extermination based solely for their perceived genetic flaws. *starting with the conquest of Poland, the \\"forced employment of millions of foreign workers meant that the v√∂lkisch hierarchy of Herrenmensch and Untermensch became a structural feature of daily life\\" which provided a context for genocide as it desensitized much of the German public to the sufferings of others. *the \\"escalation of terror\\" following the conquest of Poland in September 1939 and then by the \\"war of extermination\\" launched against the Soviet Union with Operation Barbarossa in June 1941 with Hitler giving the Commissar Order, unleashing the Einszatgruppen to exterminate Soviet Jews, and the orders to allow millions of Soviet POWs to stave to death. *rivalries between Nazi leaders for Hitler's favor that led to the \\"cumulative radicalization\\" of racial policy was Hitler always favored those with the most radical ideas. *the tendency of the Nazis to define the volksgemeinschaft in a negative sense in terms of who was to be excluded together with an xenophobic and paranoid tendency to see Germany as besieged by external and internal enemies. Peukert wrote all \\"monocausal explanations of the 'Final Solution' are inadequate\\", but then asked if out of this \\"tangle of causes\\" one might find a \\"central thread\\" linking them all. Peukert suggested that this \\"thread\\" was not antisemitism-through he admitted that Jews were the largest single group of victims of the Nazi regime-but rather the \\"fatal racist dynamism present within the human and social sciences\\", which divided all people into terms of \\"value\\" and \\"non-value\\", and made the volksk√∂rper (the collective \\"body\\" of the \\"German race\\") its main concern with the \\"selection\\" of those with healthy genes and the \\"eradication\\" of those with unhealthy genes. In this regard, Peukert noted the genocide against the Jews grew out of the Action T4 program which starting in January 1939 sought to liquidate all physically and mentally disabled Germans as a threat to the health of the volksk√∂rper. Peukert wrote that it was not antisemitism per se that led to genocide, but rather the project to purge the volksgemeinschaft of those seen as carrying unhealthy genes that was the beginning of genocide, which started with the Action T4 program. Peukert argued that the Holocaust was not inevitable, but in the story of the \\"cumulative radicalization\\" of Nazi racial policy, \\"the most deadly option for action was selected at every stage\\". Within the context of an ideology that divided the entire population of the world into people of \\"value\\" and people of \\"non-value\\" , decision-makers in the Nazi state had choices about what policy to pursue, and always chose the most extreme option. Peukert made it clear in \\"The Genesis of the 'Final Solution' from the Spirit of Science\\" that he was describing a necessary, but not a sufficient cause for the \\"Final Solution\\", arguing that without the \\"spirit of science\\" there would have been no genocide, but the \\"spirit of science\\" was not sufficient in itself for the decisions that were taken between 1939-1941. Peukert argued in his essay that the late 19th and early 20th centuries had seen tremendous scientific and technological change together with, in Germany, the growth of the welfare state, which had created widespread hopes both within the government and in society that ‚Äúutopia‚Äù was at hand and soon all social problems would be solved. Peukert wrote: > \\"From the 1890s...the conviction that social reform was necessary was > increasingly outflanked and overtaken by the belief that all social problems > could find their rational solution through state intervention and scientific > endeavor...The dream of a final solution to the social problem resonated in > the plans of the 'social engineers', regardless of whatever they were active > as youth welfare workers, social hygienists or city planners. Just as > medicine had put paid to bacteria, so too, the union of science and social > technology in public interventions would make all social problems > disappear\\". Peukert wrote that by the beginning of the 20th century, the pattern of death had changed from being common amongst young people to being only common amongst the old, and this \\"banishment of death from everyday life\\" dramatically increased the prestige of science so that it was believed would soon solve all social problems. At the same time, owing to the great prestige of science, a scientific racist, Social Darwinist and eugenicist worldview which declared some people to be more biologically ‚Äúvaluable‚Äù than others was common amongst German elites. Peukert argued that because the modern welfare state began in Germany in the 1870s, that this had encouraged an \\"utopian\\" view of social policy within Germany. Peukert wrote that the great success by medical practitioners in reducing morality in the 19th century had encouraged hopes that practitioners of the new emerging social sciences like sociology, criminology and psychology would soon solve all problems and personal unhappiness would be banished forever. At the same time, Peukert argued that the \\"spirit of science\\" had aided the rise of racism. Peukert argued that scientific advances had reduced morality, but could not end death, and unlike religion, science could offer no spiritual consolation. Peukert wrote that for precisely these reasons, scientific racism was embraced since though the body of the individual would inevitably end, the volksk√∂rper (the \\"eternal\\" body of the race) would live on. Peukert wrote that \\"actual target of scientific effort\\" switched from \\"the individual, whose cause in the long run was always hopeless, to the \\"body\\" of the nation, the volksk√∂rper\\". In this sense, ensuring the survival of the \\"healthy genes\\" was a bid for a type of immortality. Conversely, this required the elimination of \\"deficient genes\\" carried by the \\"unfit\\". Peukert wrote that as death is inevitable, scientists and those influenced by the scientists came to become obsessed with improving the health of the volk via \\"racial hygiene\\" as a bid for a sort of immorality. Peukert stated \\"the conquest of the world by a secularized, scientific rationality was so overwhelming, that the switch from religion to science as the main source of a meaning-creating mythology for everyday life took place almost without resistance. The result, however, was that science took upon itself a burden of responsibility that it would soon find a heavy one\\". Peukert wrote science could not offer spiritual consolation as in a world dominated by science the question of \\"how can the rationalist, secular ideal of the greatest happiness of the greatest number be vindicated, given that it is rebutted in the case of each individual by illness, suffering and death?\\", which was impossible to answer. As such, scientists came to be concerned with the body of the individual as a way of determining if that individual should be allowed to pass on his/her genes to the next generation with the criterion being whatever the individual was of \\"value\\" or not. In this way, there was a shift from the individual as the center of medical concern to the collective of the volksk√∂rper (the \\"body\\" of the entire race). Peukert argued that the very growth of the welfare state under the Weimar Republic ensured the backlash when social problems were not solved was especially severe. Peukert wrote: > \\"Weimar installed the new principle of the social state, in which, on the > one hand, the citizen could now claim public assistance in (his/her) social > and personal life, while on the other, the state set up the institutional > and normative framework, (defining how) a 'normal' life of the citizen of > the state could progress...This process, which had already began before the > turn of the century, reached its apex in the Weimar Republic and was also > thrown into crisis, as the limits of social technology could achieve were > reached in every direction\\". Peukert wrote that after the First World War, the pre-war mood of optimism gave way to disillusionment as German bureaucrats found social problems to be more insolvable than at first thought, which in turn, guided by the prevailing Social Darwinist and eugenicist values led them to place increasing emphasis on saving the biologically ‚Äúfit‚Äù while the biologically ‚Äúunfit‚Äù were to be written off. Peukert used as an example that fact that social workers had before the First World War had believed it was possible to ensure that every child in Germany was brought up in a happy home and by 1922 were instead declaring that certain young people were \\"biologically\\" prone to being \\"unfit\\", requiring a law on detention that was to remove them from society forever. Peukert maintained that after 1929, when the Great Depression began, the economic limits of the welfare state to end poverty were cruelly exposed, which led German social scientists and doctors to argue that the \\"solution\\" was now to protect the \\"valuable\\" in society from the \\"incurable\\". Peukert wrote that rather than accept that the \\"spirit of science\\" could not solve all social problems, those who believed in the \\"spirit of science\\" started to blame the victims of poverty themselves for their plight, depicting their poverty as due to biological instead of economic factors, and began to devise measures to exclude the biologically \\"incurable\\" from society. Peukert described the appeal of National Socialism to scientists and social engineers as offering a simplistic \\"racial\\" explanations for social failures in modern Germany, which allowed those making social policy to disregard economic and psychological factors as a reason for why some families were \\"losers\\". Peukert wrote that when faced with the same financial contains that their predecessors in the Imperial and Weimar periods had faced, social workers, teachers, professors and doctors in the Third Reich began to advocate plans to ensure that the genes of the \\"racially unfit\\" would not be passed on to the next generation, first via sterilization and then by killing them. Furthermore, Peukert argued that v√∂lkisch racism was part of a male backlash against women's emancipation, and was a way of asserting control over women's bodies, which were viewed in a certain sense as public property since women had the duty of bearing the next generation that would pass on the \\"healthy genes\\". Peukert maintained that as the bearers of the next generation of Germans that Nazi social policies fell especially heavily upon German women. Peukert argued that for volksgenossenlinnen (female \\"national comrades\\"), any hint of non- conformity and the \\"pleasures of refusal\\" in not playing their designated role within the volksgemeinschaft as the bearers of the next generation of soldiers could expect harsh punishments such as sterilization, incarceration in a concentration camp or for extreme case vernichtung (\\"extermination\\"). Peukert wrote that \\"after 1933 any critical public discussion and any critique of racism in the human sciences from amongst the ranks of the experts was eliminated: from then on, the protective...instances of the Rechstaat (legal state) no longer stood between the racist perpetrators and their victims; from then on, the dictatorial state put itself solely on the side of racism\\". Peukert argued that all of the National Socialist social policies such as natalist policies that relentlessly pressured Aryan women to have more and children were all part of the same effort to strengthen the volksgemeinschaft. Peukert argued that despite a turn towards Social Darwinism when confronted with the failure of the welfare state to solve all social problems in the 1920s, that it was the democratic Weimar constitution that had provided a thin legal wedge that prevented the full implications of this from being worked out. Peukert argued that in 1939 that the entire system that had been built up for scientifically identifying those of racial \\"non-value\\" served as the apparatus for genocide. Peukert wrote that the all of the criterion for identifying Jews and Romany as peoples of racial \\"non-value\\" was based on the pseudo-scientific theories that had been promoted by generations of \\"race scientists\\" and that those serving in the \\"human sciences and social professions\\" worked to provide the theories for an \\"all-embracing racist restructuring of social policy, educational policy and health and welfare policy\\". The culmination of these efforts was the proposed 1944 \\"Law for the Treatment of Community Aliens\\" which called for sending to the concentration camps anyone who failed to live be up to be a proper 'volksgenossen as a gemeinschaftsfremde (community alien). Only the fact that Germany was fully engaged in World War II prevented Hitler from signing \\"Law for the Treatment of Community Aliens\\", which was put off until the Reich won the \\"final victory\\". Peukert wrote: \\"Nazi racism, the professed goal which had been to secure the immorality of the racially pure volksk√∂rper in practice inevitably became converted into a crusade against life\\". Peukert wrote that the Holocaust would never had happened without the shift from the thinking of scientists from concern with the body of the individual to concern with the body of the collective volksk√∂rper, the tendency to break society into those of \\"value\\" and those of \\"lesser value\\" and with seeing the solution to social problems as eliminating the genes of those of \\"lesser value\\". Peukert wrote that the fascination with pseudo-scientific racial theories and eugenics were common to all of the West, but it was the specific conditions in Germany which allowed the National Socialists to come to power 1933 that led to the \\"Final Solution to the Jewish Question\\". Peukert wrote: \\"The 'death of God' in the nineteenth century gave science dominion over life. For each individual human being, however, the borderline experience of death rebuts this claim to dominion. Science therefore sought its salvation in the specious immorality of the racial volksk√∂rper, for the sake of which real-and hence more imperfect- life could be sacrificed. Thus the instigators of the \\"Final Solution\\" finally achieved dominion over death\\". Through Peukert was on the left, the conservative American intellectual M.D. Aeschliman praised Peukert's essay in The National Review as \\"important\\" and \\"haunting\\". He wrote that after the war that scientists who had provided the intellectual justification for the \\"Final Solution\\" were not prosecuted and a massive effort to block the memory of their actions started which largely prevented any discussion of the subject in the 1950s-1960s. Peukert ended his essay stating that there were debates about \\"our dealings with others, notably those different from ourselves. Recent debates about foreign migrants and AIDs present a conflicting picture. On one hand, we can see the continuing survival of a discourse on segregation, untouched by any historical self-consciousness. On the other hand, however, there is a considerable body of opinion pledging for tolerance and responsibility that spring from an awareness of German history and of the genesis of the \\"Final Solution\\" from the spirit of science\\". Death and legacy Peukert died of AIDS in 1990, aged 39. The British historian Richard Bessel described Peukert's last months as a \\"nightmare of suffering\\". At the time, there were no drugs to treat HIV, and Peukert died in much agony, but was described by as having kept his spirits up the end. In a 2017 review of the 2015 book Detlev Peukert und die NS-Forschung (Detlev Peukert and the National Socialist Research) the American historian Helmut Walser Smith called Peukert one of \\"the most prolific German historians of the post-war era\\" who wrote important books in social history, \\"extremely influential articles, like ‚ÄòThe Final Solution from the Spirit of Science‚Äô, still often cited\\" and \\"stunning, provocative works of synthesis\\" such as his book on the Weimar Republic. Smith wrote that in general most historians have issues with his thesis about the Weimar Republic as a paradigm of \\"classical modernity\\", writing that the concept of \\"classical modernity\\" was too vague and that Peukert's point that modernity does not automatically equal freedom now seems self-evident. The editors of Detlev Peukert und die NS-Forschung, R√ºdiger Hachtmann and Sven Reichardt, argued that Peukert was one of the most important historians on the Nazi era as he shifted research from the subject of Verf√ºhrung und Gewalt (Seduction and Violence) to Volksgenossen und Gemeinschaftsfremde (National Comrades and Community Aliens) focusing on \\"the role of ordinary people, as insiders (believers, conformers, bystanders) in their relation to perceived outsiders.\\" One of the contributors to Detlev Peukert und die NS-Forschung, Nikolaus Wachsmann, argued that Peukert's focus on looking at all groups victimized by the Nazi regime as Gemeinschaftsfremde (Community Aliens) such as the Romany, homosexuals, and the disabled missed the centrality of v√∂lkisch anti-Semitic ideology to the \\"Final Solution of the Jewish Question\\". Wachsmann further noted that a central problem with Peukert's work was it was entirely concerned with Germany and he missed that the majority of the people killed by the Nazi regime were in Eastern Europe. Waschsman criticized Peukert for failing to go beyond his own point that the violence of the Nazi regime tended to be directed against people considered to be \\"outsiders\\" in Germany which meant the vast majority of the victims of Nazi violence were people in Eastern Europe, observing that Peukert had little to say about the extermination of Eastern European Jews, the sheer brutality of German policies in Poland or the mass murder of three million Red Army POWs in 1941-42 as all this happened outside of Germany. Smith in his review largely agreed with Waschman's point about that Peukert's focus on developments entirely within Germany was limited one. However, Smith argued that Peukert's \\"subtle understanding of consent, accommodation and non-conformity\\" by ordinary people in Nazi Germany still made him relevant today as Peukert helped show how the absence of \\"public protest and genuine outrage at the treatment of others\\" made genocide possible. In 2017, the British historian Jane Caplan approvingly quoted Peukert's remarks about how best to confront fascism as still relevant today, citing his statement from Inside Nazi Germany: \\"The values we should assert [in response to fascism] are easily stated but hard to practise: reverence for life, pleasure in diversity and contrariety, respect for what is alien, tolerance for what is unpalatable, scepticism about the feasibility and desirability of chiliastic schemes for a global new order, openness towards others and a willingness to learn even from those who call into question one‚Äôs own principles of social virtue.\\" Work *Ruhrarbeiter gegen den Faschismus Dokumentation √ºber den Widerstand im Ruhrgebeit 1933-1945, Frankfurt am Main, 1976. *Die Reihen fast geschlossen : Beitr√§ge zur Geschichte des Alltags unterm Nationalsozialismus co-edited with J√ºrgen Reulecke & Adelheid Gr√§fin zu Castell Rudenhausen, Wuppertal : Hammer, 1981. *Volksgenossen und Gemeinschaftsfremde: Anpassung, Ausmerze und Aufbegehren unter dem Nationalsozialismus Cologne: Bund Verlag, 1982, translated into English by Richard Deveson as Inside Nazi Germany : Conformity, Opposition and Racism in Everyday Life London : Batsford, 1987 . *Die Weimarer Republik : Krisenjahre der Klassischen Moderne, Frankfurt am Main : Suhrkamp Verlag, 1987 translated into English as The Weimar Republic : the Crisis of Classical Modernity, New York : Hill and Wang, 1992 . * ‚ÄúThe Genesis of the \`Final Solution‚Äô from the Spirit of Science‚Äù pages 234-252 from Reevaluating the Third Reich edited by Thomas Childers and Jane Caplan, New York: Holmes & Meier, 1994 .

It was notable for publishing the first stand-alone adventure for the Dungeons & Dragons role-playing game, and for publishing the first character sheets for an RPG. The company thrived for several years while TSR distributed their unlicensed products. When TSR stopped distributing unlicensed materials, Wee Warriors tried diversifying, but ultimately ceased publication in 1978. History When TSR's Dungeons & Dragons began its quick rise to popularity, Pete and Judy Kerestan of El Segundo, California formed Wee Warriors in 1975 to publish accessories for the new game. For two years, Wee Warriors produced a variety of innovative products related to the D&D; RPG market, notably the first stand-alone adventure, and the first set of character sheets. Although they did not have a license to produce D&D; accessories, their early products were both promoted and distributed by TSR. Then in late 1977, with the release of the new Advanced Dungeons & Dragons rules, the rapidly expanding TSR stopped distributing third-party materials. Wee Warriors tried diversifying, creating a line of 54 mm metal fantasy figures, designing a Star Trek board game, and promoting a new science fiction play-by-mail game. But the company was unable to regain traction in the marketplace, and ceased publication in 1978. In 2019, the intellectual property rights of Wee Warriors were acquired by Precis Intermedia. http://www.pigames.net/store/blog.php?entry=2785 Published material =D&D; adventures= * Dungeon Master's Kit #1: Palace of the Vampire Queen (1976) - The first stand-alone RPG adventure module, set on the dwarven Isle of Baylor in the Misty Isles archipelago.)

History Big Red in 1919 Schoellkopf Memorial Hall During the 1800s, Cornell athletic teams played on Percy Field, located where Ithaca High School now stands. As the university and town grew, the need for a larger, dedicated stadium on campus became apparent. Following the death of former Cornell football player and head football coach Henry Schoellkopf in 1912, his close friend, Willard Straight, donated $100,000 () to construct the Schoellkopf Memorial Hall in honor of Henry Schoellkopf. The building was completed in 1913. In response to Straight's generous gift, members of the Schoellkopf family and the Zeta Psi Fraternity donated $70,000 () for the construction of Schoellkopf Field in honor of the Schoellkopf family patriarch, Jacob Schoellkopf, Schoellkopf Field was completed in 1915.The Schoellkopfs, A Family History, 1994 Copy Held by Cornell University Archives.Guide to the Campus: Cornell University 1920 P 80-82.CORNELL'S NEW STADIUM.; Schoellkopf Field Will Be Ready for Use in the Spring of 1915., The New York Times, August 23, 1914.Schoellkopf Field, Cornell University, retrieved June 18, 2010. The opening ceremony for Schoellkopf field took place on Saturday, October 9, 1915, in which an estimated 6,000 people marched in a procession led by university president Jacob Gould Schurman from Goldwin Smith Hall to the new stadium. It was said to be the largest gathering in Ithaca at the time. In 1920, a flood searchlight system was installed by General Electric. The system was intended to allow for play in the fall and winter months, without causing glare in the players' eyes. A 1922 souvenir postcard shows Schoellkopf Field's unique crescent-shaped stands =Increased capacity= Schoellkopf's original capacity when it was completed was about 9,000, but it has been expanded and changed many times over the years.

The field has had its turf replaced by a newer type of turf in 1979, 1988, 1999, and, most recently, in 2008. =Later renovations= 1986 saw a $3.6 million renovation, including the construction of a press box on the west side. The press box won an award in 1990 from the Sports Writer's Association of America. New light fixtures were installed in 1986 to allow for televised games at night. During the summer of 2005, renovations on deteriorating concrete forced the university to close the Crescent, but it reopened in time for the fall football season. The renovated Memorial Hall at the north end of the field opened in 2006, containing improved locker rooms and training facilities.

He undertook mechanical engineering studies, and obtained his engineering degree from Hannover Technical University in 1913. He was wounded during World War I. In 1919 he became one of the partners of Bremer Reifenindustrie. The company was restructured and in 1920 became Bremer K√ºhlerfabrik Borgward & Co. In 1924 and 1925 the company started to produce the small three-wheel trucks Blitzkarren and Goliath. With his partner Wilhelm Tecklenborg, in 1928 he created the company Goliath-Werke Borgward & Co. When the two associates took over Hansa- Lloyd-Werke in 1931, this became the Borgward Group. On September 23, 1938, the Carl F. W. Borgward Automobil- und Motorenwerke factory was opened in Sebaldsbr√ºck near Bremen. At that time the company had 22,000 employees. Until the end of the war the production of Borgward was primarily military vehicles. When the factory was destroyed by bombing in 1944, half of the workers were prisoners of war and forced laborers. Carl Borgward was interned until 1948.:de:Carl Friedrich Wilhelm Borgward#Leben One year after being freed, he was again a member of the Chamber of Commerce and Industry of Bremen. In 1949, the first Lloyd LP 300 had been designed and produced. In Germany this car was nicknamed the Leukoplastbomber (Band-aid Bomber). The small car with a plywood body on a wooden chassis had a two-stroke engine and was in the market segment under the Volkswagen Beetle, and kept this position over a decade. In 1949 Borgward had presented the large Hansa sedan, which was the first European car with a pontoon body. He had taken ideas from American magazines, which he read when under detention. The largest success came in 1954 with the Borgward Isabella. The Borgwards met the spirit of the time: the German customers wished for American-type styling and chrome decoration with European compact dimensions. Borgward participated in detail in the design of all the car models. Increased competition on the segment of mid-sized cars, and the broad and uneconomical range of models, as well as poor financial and tactical choices by management, led the company into crisis at the end of the 1950s. The new model Borgward-Lloyd Arabella:de:Lloyd Arabella should have eased the difficulties, but was handicapped by quality problems. In 1961, Borgward underwent one of the most spectacular bankruptcies in the history of Germany. The company went to the Land of Bremen, which had it liquidated, and part of the factory went to Hanomag. Years after the bankruptcy was closed, it came out that it had not been reasonable: All debts had been paid to the last cent.:de:Borgward#Konkurs Carl Borgward died of a heart attack at the age 72 on July 28, 1963.

Hoy also served many years as the university's registrar and was involved in the baseball program.

Hoy Field is located just west of Schoellkopf Field and east of the Engineering Quad on the southern end of Cornell's campus. The dimensions of the field from home plate to the outfield fence are 315 feet in left field, 405 feet in center field and 325 feet in right field. The seating capacity of Hoy Field is about 500. For many years the Bacon Cage, an indoor batting practice facility that was also used as an indoor golf driving range, was located between Schoellkopf Field and Hoy Field. However, Bacon Cage was demolished to build a parking garage and new press box on the west side of Schoellkopf Field. In 1947 it was proposed that the School of Industrial and Labor Relations be housed in a new building that would be built partly over the field, but protests from students and alumni blocked the project. In 2006, the grass turf was removed and replaced with FieldTurf, which has many grass- like properties.

History At the World Computer Chess Championship in Reykjav√≠k in 2005, Fruit 2.2 scored 8.5 out of 11, finishing in second place behind Zappa. Until Version 2.1 (Peach), Fruit was free and open-source software subject to the requirements of the GNU General Public License and as such contributed much to the development in computer chess in recent years. Some people still work on the v2.1 source code and have created variations from the original Fruit. As of July 23, 2007, Fruit became freeware. Fruit 2.3.1 was one of the top 3 free UCI chess engines. Technical details of Fruit 2.1 Fruit uses the classical Negascout (principal variation search) algorithm with iterative deepening to traverse the game tree. It also uses the null-move heuristic. The original version used a simplistic evaluation function with a robust search. Later versions have improved evaluation functions. The board representation is distinct ‚Äî Fruit uses a 16x16 board. Derivatives Although in 2007 Fabien Letouzey stopped the development of Fruit with version 2.3.1, the earlier open source 2.1 version provided the basis for many other programs. = Toga II = Toga II is a derivative created by Thomas Gaksch, currently continued by Jerry Donald Watson.

Experimental versions of Toga II running on computer clusters have competed in the World Computer Chess Championship (WCCC). At about 80 ELO above Fruit 2.3.1, Toga II is the strongest Fruit derivative . In 2008, forks of Toga II started to appear, like Grapefruit and Cyclone. = GambitFruit = GambitFruit is another free derivative of Fruit 2.1, created by Ryan Benitez. It plays a more aggressive style and has more chess knowledge. GambitFruit also incorporates improvements from Toga II.

Rybka controversy In June 2011, a lengthy investigation by the International Computer Games Association (ICGA) determined Rybka was plagiarized from Fruit and Crafty. The author of Rybka, Vasik Rajlich, refused to address the allegations against Rybka with the ICGA, instead preferring an ex post facto public interview conducted by Nelson Hernandez on July 4, 2011. Rajlich had previously said: I went through the Fruit 2.1 source code forwards and backwards and took many things.

Founded in 1786, it is situated on the east bank of the East River of Pictou. The community gained its name in 1882 at the suggestion of a prominent citizen, Harvey Graham, after he visited Trenton, New Jersey. It was incorporated as a town on 11 March 1911.  Economy  Since the 1870s, the town's economy was tied to the TrentonWorks factory and its predecessors which occupies a large property along the East River of Pictou. This factory closed permanently in 2016 after various incarnations as a steel fabrication, railcar fabrication, and wind turbine tower fabrication facility. Since the late 1960s, the town has also been host to the Trenton Generating Station. Other large employers in the past have included a paint manufacturer (Tibbett's Paints) as well as a glass works (Trenton Glass). The town's economy is undergoing a transition to a post-industrial tertiary/service economy. Major employers in the region are located outside the town, namely a Michelin Tire factory in Granton and an Asia Pulp & Paper (Paper Excellence Canada) pulp mill in Abercrombie. The TrentonWorks facility dominates the town's waterfront, having opened in the 1870s as Canada's first steel mill before being converted to focus exclusively on manufactured steel products by the late 19th century. The TrentonWorks site was used to produce railway cars throughout the entire 20th century before production ceased in 2007. Part of the facility was used as a shipyard to produce small cargo ships during both World Wars; the railcar plant was temporarily retooled during these conflicts to produce munitions. As of 2010, the facility is undergoing a $60 million conversion to produce components for wind turbines in a partnership between South Korean industrial conglomerate Daewoo Shipbuilding & Marine Engineering (DSME) and the governments of Nova Scotia and Canada. The end of railcar manufacturing on the TrentonWorks site saw the loss of 1300 jobs (at peak employment); it is currently hoped that the conversion to produce wind turbine components by DSME will return employment to pre-2007 levels.Nova Scotia News - TheChronicleHerald.ca Trenton Forge is a separate company located adjacent to the TrentonWorks property dates to the 1870s and operates one of the largest forges in the world. At one time, Trenton also hosted a glass works and paint factory. The town has been facing significant economic turmoil in recent decades as the local economy transitions from industrial to post- industrial. Rural depopulation in Canada has affected Pictou County and Trenton has witnessed the loss of numerous institutions and businesses over the years. These include: 5 schools, a movie theatre, doctors' offices, many businesses, and several industries. The town has very few local services, relying on the growing commercial district in neighbouring New Glasgow; it has recently seen its last bank branch and gas station close. With the town's residential and commercial tax base in decline, finances are strained for maintaining existing services and it is believed that amalgamation with New Glasgow is inevitable.

Biography  Sobel was born in the Bronx, in New York City, New York. He completed his B.S.S. (1951) and M.A. (1952) at City College of New York, and after serving in the U.S. Army, obtained a Ph.D. from New York University in 1957. He started teaching at Hofstra in 1956. Sobel eventually became Lawrence Stessin Distinguished Professor of Business History at Hofstra. After his death, the university established the Robert Sobel Endowed Scholarship for Excellence in Business History & Finance. Books Sobel's first business history, published in 1965, was The Big Board: A History of the New York Stock Market. It was the first history of the stock market written in over a generation. The book was met with favorable reviews and solid sales, and Sobel's writing career was launched. Several of his subsequent books were bestsellers. Besides writing more than 30 books, Sobel authored many articles, book reviews, and scripts for television documentaries and mini-series. From 1972 to 1988, Sobel's weekly investment column, \\"Knowing the Street,\\" was nationally syndicated through New York Newsday. He was also regularly published in national periodicals, including The New York Times and The Wall Street Journal. At the time of his death, Sobel was also a contributing editor to Barron's Magazine. He was a regular guest on financial and other news shows, such as Wall Street Week and Crossfire. Sobel was nearly as famous for his only work of fiction, the 1973 book, For Want of a Nail. This book is an alternate history in which Burgoyne won the Battle of Saratoga during the American Revolutionary War. This work detailed the history of an alternate timeline, complete with footnotes. Sobel had authored or co-authored several actual textbooks. For Want of a Nail was republished in 1997 and won a special achievement Sidewise Award for Alternate History that year. Wall Street Sobel's dominant passion was Wall Street, a fascination that he held since his childhood. \\"It is as though you are walking through a historical theme park, with this engaging man at your side pointing out the sights,\\" said Andrew Tobias, the author and investment guide, in a review in The New York Times of The Last Bull Market: Wall Street in the 1960s (W. W. Norton, 1978). Most of Sobel's books were written for a general audience, but he never bristled when some scholarly writers dismissed him as a \\"popularizer,\\" said his colleague and friend George David Smith, a professor of economic history at New York University. \\"Quite the contrary‚Äîhe saw that as his mission in life.\\" Selected quotations From Panic on Wall Street by Robert Sobel: From a February 22, 1999 Barron's Magazine article by Robert Sobel: From The Great Bull Market: Wall Street in the 1920s, by Robert Sobel: Selected bibliography =Fiction= * =Non-fiction=           ** A paperback reprint of IBM: Colossus in Transition.

Etymology The word Ilokano originates from Iloko (archaic form, Yloco), the conjugation of i- (meaning \\"of\\") and look (meaning \\"bay\\"), which means \\"from the bay\\" in Ilocano. History =Classical period= Two theories are prominent among historians regarding the Spread of what historians call the Austronesian peoples. * A theory posted by the anthropologist Henry Otley Beyer, known as the Wave of Migration Theory, posits that from 300 to 200 BC a migration of Austronesian speaking people from the island of Borneo arrived on the shores of northwest Luzon. They were supposedly the most recent of the three waves of migration to the Philippines known as the Malays. Before the arrival of these people, the inhabitants of northwest Luzon were a different Austronesian speaking people called the proto-Malay group whom consist of the modern Tinguian, Isneg, Kalinga, Kankanaey, Bontoc and other tribes collectively known today as the Igorot. Prior to the arrival of the Igorot were the people known today as the Aeta or Negritos. Different study shows that the Ilocanos came to the Northwestern Luzon along with the Kalingas, Apayaos and Tingguians Over time, the Malay people intermarried with the proto-Malay and or Aeta people, and it is their descendants who lived along the coasts of Northwestern Luzon that the Spanish first came in contact with and called Ilocanos. * Nowadays, the most commonly accepted theory is the \\"Out of Taiwan\\" model. In this model, it is suggested that the ancestors of today's Austronesian peoples originated from migrations from the island of Taiwan during the Neolithic period. Social structure While Spain applied the term barangay to the settlements in the Ilocos region upon contact, the Ilocano people called their towns, √≠li, and a smaller group of houses, pur√≥k. These residents of the √≠li were organized in a class society. At the top of the class system was a chief or agt√∫ray or √°ri and his family. The √°ri earned his position due to strength, wealth and or wisdom. This position could also be inherited and usually reserved for a male, however, in the event that no male heir was available a strong female heir was accepted. If the heir was found to be weak by the √≠li, then another √°ri family would be put in place and the former √°ri family could fall down in class. Together with a community of elders called am√°en or panglak√°yen √≠li, the √°ri administered justice and governed the daily lives of the √≠li and led his/her people to war if necessary. Below the √°ri were the wealthy babakn√°ng, or Maharlika in Tagalog, of who could easily move into the position of √°ri. Their wealth was maintained by their control of trade with primarily the Chinese, Japanese, Igorots, and the Tagalogs. Goods often traded were rice, cotton, gold, wax, iron, glass beads, honey, and stoneware jars called burn√°y. Below the babakn√°ng were the kailianes, a class that helped the √°ri in sailing, working his/her fields, and preparing for celebrations. In exchange, the kailianes were given gifts directly from the √°ri. The katalonan were below the babakn√°ng and the kailianes and they were tenant farmers who consisted of the majority of the population in an √≠li. They largely practised wet-rice agriculture which included rice and taro as well as dry agriculture that included cotton. At the bottom of the pre-colonial Ilocano society were the ub√≠ng and below them the tag√°bu, also called \\"ad√≠pen\\". The ub√≠ng were servants while the tag√°bu were slaves. The tag√°bu acquired their status through unresolved debt, insulting a member of the babakn√°ng or √°ri, by being prisoners of war, or even inheriting the debt of their ancestor. Appearances An Ilocano woman and man wearing kattukong and annang√°, circa 1820s. Both Ilocano men and women grew their hair long, but tied it up in different ways. Some women twisted their hair to create a bun, while some men twisted their hair and hid it under a turban like wrapping called a bangal or potong. The patterns and colors of the bangal had many meanings. For example, red potong indicated that the wearer had killed, while a striped pattern indicated that the wearer killed at least seven people. In addition to the bangal, farmers and fishermen also wore a gourd hat called a kattukong on sunny or rainy days. The kattukong was made from a hollowed and dried calabash gourd or tab√∫ngaw in Ilocano with a woven interior made of anahaw, nipa, bamboo, and/or rattan. Also often worn during rainy days was a cape called a annang√°, also called \\"l√°big\\" or \\"kalapi√°w\\", which was often made of nipa palm leaves. =Spanish Era to the Philippine Republic= Juan de Salcedo The Spanish conquistador Juan de Salcedo explored the northern regions of the Philippines in 1571, where he traveled to the Ilocos region (among other places), colonizing the North, and establishing several Spanish municipalities, including Villa Fernandina known as Vigan City in the present time and Tagudin. War with Zambales and Pangasinan In 1660, Andres Malong, a chief of San Carlos, Pangasinan or Binalatongan as it was called than, allied with the people of Zambales in an effort to remove the Spanish colonizers and subdue those supported Spain. Malong, was formerly employed by the Spanish to help colonize non-Christian towns and villages in Pangasinan, however, as Malong subjugated others, he realized he could also overcome the outnumbered Spanish. With his Zambales allies, Malong crowned himself the king of Pangasinan and sent out letters to all the chiefs of the Ilocos Region, Pampanga and Cagayan Valley and demanded that they too align and recognize Malong as their king and kill any Spaniards among them. If they did not, Malong warned that he would invade and punish them for not joining his cause. Unlike Pangasinan and the Zambales, The Ilocos at the time was a region that the Spanish invested its soldiers and missionaries in and routinely secured. Towns such as Vigan, Ilocos Sur and Tagudin, Ilocos Sur were quickly conquered by the Spanish encomiendas, fortifications and Catholic churches quickly established to subjugate the Ilocano people into the Spanish Empire. The Spanish were swift in this process to stake their claim on the region's gold trade with the Igorots. They sought to prevent Chinese and Japanese pirates and different European powers such as the Dutch or English from taking these trade routes. Considering this relatively recent history with the Spanish and primarily under the influence of Catholic missionaries, many of the Ilocano chiefs rejected Andres Malong's offer. Ilocano merchants in the mid-19th century. In response to their rejection, Malong sent a Zambales chief named Don Pedro Gumapos, who had recently conquered the Pampanga region with 6,000 men, to invade the Ilocos as well as Cagayan regions. Gumapos and his men were met with only 1,500 Spanish loyalist Ilocanos under the command of the alcalde mayor of the region and even missionaries. As such, the Zambales and Pangasinese army quickly defeated them and marched as far north as Vigan, Ilocos Sur where they sacked and burned the Spanish stronghold and nearby villages. With many of the Spanish missionaries and colonial authorities in Ilocos evacuated and/or in retreat, Malong than asked Gumapos to assist him in Pangasinan, where the Spanish were beginning to advance on him. As Gumapos and his troops traveled back down through Narvacan, Ilocos Sur, they continued to raid Ilocano towns and villages for supplies. Ultimately, the people of Narvacan responded with guerrilla tactics aided by their Tinguian allies. This retaliation by the Ilocano people was devastating and caused more fatalities on Gumapos' army than with the Spanish lead Ilocano forces. As the invading army headed south they sacked and/or burned the coastal towns of Santa Maria, Ilocos Sur, San Esteban, Ilocos Sur, Santiago, Ilocos Sur and Candon, Ilocos Sur. When they finally approached Santa Cruz, Ilocos Sur, Gumapos encountered a Spanish led army who had just finished reconquering Pangasinan and captured Andres Malong. Despite learning of Malong's defeat, Gumapos led his army to battle. Gumapos and his army were defeated after two large battles. After being captured, Gumapos was sent back to Vigan, Ilocos Sur where he was executed by hanging. The Ilocos Region would not see another revolt against the Spanish until 1762.  Demographics  Ilocano people emigrating to the Cagayan Valley, c. 1920. Ilocanos number 8,074,536 in the Philippines in 2010. A few Ilocanos living in the Cordilleras have some Cordillerano blood. =Ethnic homeland= Ilocandia is the term given to the traditional homeland of the Ilocano people, which constitutes present-day Ilocos Norte and the northern portions of Ilocos Sur. = Diaspora= The mounting population pressure due to the substantial population density during the mid-19th century caused the migration of the Ilocanos out of their traditional homeland. By 1903, more than 290,000 Ilocanos migrated to Central Luzon, Cagayan Valley, and Metro Manila. More than 180,000 moved to Pangasinan, Tarlac, and Nueva Ecija. Almost 50,000 moved to Cagayan Valley; half of them resided in Isabela. Around 47,000 lived in Zambales and more than 11,000 in Sultan Kudarat . Later migrations brought Ilocanos to the Cordilleras, Mindoro, Palawan, and Mindanao provinces of Sultan Kudarat, North Cotabato, and South Cotabato. The Ilocano diaspora continued in 1906 when Ilocanos started to migrate to Hawaii and California. Ilocanos composed the largest number of expatriates in the United States, though most are bilingual with Tagalog. There is a significant Ilocano community in Hawai'i, in which they make up more than 85% of the Filipino population there. Languages Most Ilocanos speak Ilocano, which is part of the Northern Philippine subgroup of the Austronesian family of languages. They also speak Tagalog, and English as second languages. Religion Most Ilocanos are Roman Catholics, and Aglipayans, which originated in Ilocos Norte.\\"Ilokanos.\\" Junior Worldmark Encyclopedia of World Cultures. The Gale Group, Inc. 1999. Retrieved December 10, 2009. =Pre-Hispanic beliefs and traditions= Prior to the arrival of the Spanish, Ilocanos were animists who believed in spirits called anito who were either bad or good, male or female. These anito ruled over all aspects of the universe. For example, Litao were anitos of water, Kaib√°an, also called Kanib√°an, were anitos of the undergrowth in a forest, and Mangmangkik were anitos of trees. The Mangmangkik were often feared for causing sickness when a fellow tree was cut down. To appease the Mangmangkik before cutting down a tree, the following chant was made: :Bari Bari. :Dikat agunget pari. :Ta pumukan kami. :Iti pabakirda kadakami. This chant calls on the Mangmangkik and beseeches them not to curse the people cutting the tree down. Similar chants and phrases are uttered to appease the Kaib√°an when hot cooking water is thrown out into the yard for disposal. The Kaib√°an can be befriended, giving luck and blessing to the person. Likewise, if a Kaib√°an is angered, illness and in some cases death would plague the person's health and family. Other ways anitos were respected and appeased were through offerings and sacrifices to idols on platforms called a simbaan or designated caves where the anito frequents. These offerings, called 'atang', consisted of various foodstuffs and sweets, as well as cigars and paan. Atang is also offered to the deceased during prayers for the dead or on All Soul's Day. Another practice which survived well into the 19th century was 'sibr√≥ng'. Associated with human sacrifice and headhunting, sibr√≥ng was a prevalent practice in the Ilocos region. The person who carried out the executions was called the 'mannibr√≥ng'; this term now means 'thief' in modern Ilocano. Before the death of a community leader or a member of the Principal√≠a, the dying person would lift his hand raised with a certain number of fingers. The number of fingers raised would be the indicator of how many people would have to be killed in order to accompany the dying to the afterlife. In other cases, the people chosen by the mannibr√≥ng would have their fingers cut off instead of being executed. S√≠brong can also refer to the practice of placing a human head in the foundations of the building to protect the structure from damage. = Mythological figures = In Ilocano mythology, Angalo was a mythical creation giant who was also the first man. Through his actions, he shaped the Cordillera Central, Luzon mountain range, formed the oceans and its saltiness, and put up the sky, moon, sun and stars. The Banaoang Gap, in Santa, Ilocos Sur was said to be created by Angalo when he kicked the mountain range while sleeping. = Immortals = *Unnamed Supreme God: the supreme god who tasked the primordial giants to initiate the creation of many thingsYabes, L.

Ilocanos boast of a somewhat healthy diet heavy in boiled or steamed vegetables and freshwater fish, but are particularly fond of dishes flavored with bugguong, fermented fish that is often used instead of salt. Ilocanos often season boiled vegetables with bugguong monamon (fermented anchovy paste) to produce pinakbet. Local specialties include the abuos, soft white larvae of ants, and \\"jumping salad\\" or tiny, live shrimp with kalamansi juice. Another food that is popular for many Ilocanos is marunggay. It is a good condiment for meat soup called la'uya (e.g. tinola) or it can be mixed with the famous dinengdeng, a soup made of mainly vegetables with prawn aramang. Most households grow this tree in their backyards and usually offered free for all the neighbors who may want them. Many Ilocanos from Hawai'i are fond of eating them. The Ilocano people are also known to be the first ethnic group in the Philippines to eat the larvae and eggs of abuos (weaver ants). The practice has since been infused as well with other ethnic groups in northern Luzon. =Literature= One of the most well-known Ilocano literary works written in Iloco is the Biag ni Lam-ang (The Life of Lam-Ang), an epic poem about the fantastic life and escapades of an Ilocano hero named Lam-ang. \\"Biag ni Lam-ang\\" is a testament in the Ilocano literature. The Ilocano writer Elizabeth Medina is probably the most remarkable living Ilocano writer in the Spanish language. =Craftsmanship= Even before the coming of the Spaniards, the Ilocano people of Northern Luzon were already crafting tools and objects that describes their culture and civilization. Prior to the Spanish colonization that westernized the Ilocano people, the Ilocanos already invented the Dadapilan (a tool use for crushing sugarcane). Other cultural items includes tilar (native loom), dulang (low table), abel (textile), burnay (native jar), almiris, (mortar), maguey products, panday blacksmith, sag-ut (cotton yarn).

It is a water-soluble white solid and a weak reducing agent. Sodium tellurite is an intermediate in the extraction of the element, tellurium; it is a product obtained from anode slimes and is a precursor to tellurium. Preparation The main source of tellurium is from copper anode slimes, which contain precious metals as well as various tellurides. These slimes are roasted with sodium carbonate and oxygen to produce sodium tellurite. :Ag2Te + Na2CO3 + O2 ‚Üí 2Ag + Na2TeO3 + CO2 (400‚Äì500 ¬∞C) This is a reaction with silver telluride. The telluride is oxidized to tellurite and the silver(I) is reduced to silver. Purification The electrolysis of a tellurite solution yields purified tellurium. :Anode: 4OH‚àí ‚Üí 2H2O + O2 + 4e‚àí :Cathode: TeO32‚àí + 3H2O + 4e‚àí ‚Üí Te + 6OH‚àí Structure and properties Tellurium has properties similar to sulfur and selenium. In the anhydrous form Na2TeO3 the tellurium atoms are 6 coordinate, three Te-O at 1.87 √Ö and three at 2.9 √Ö, with distorted octahedra sharing edges. In the pentahydrate, Na2TeO3.5H2O there are discrete tellurite anions, TeO32‚àí which are pyramidal. The Te-O distance is 1.85 - 1.86 √Ö and the O-Te-O angle is close to 99.5¬∞. The tellurite anion is a weak base. Sodium tellurite would be similar to sodium selenite and sodium sulfite. Sodium tellurite is both a weak oxidizing agent and a weak reducing agent. Tellurite-related reactions :H2TeO3 ‚Üí H+ + HTeO3‚àí pK 2.48 Telluric acid loses a proton at this pKa. :HTeO3‚àí ‚Üí H+ + TeO32‚àí pK 7.7 Hydrogen tellurite loses a proton at this pKa to become the tellurite ion. This would happen in the reaction of tellurous acid with sodium hydroxide to make sodium tellurite. :TeO2 + 2OH‚àí ‚Üí TeO32‚àí + H2O This is the reaction of tellurium dioxide with a base to make a tellurite salt. Applications Sodium tellurite improves the corrosion resistance of electroplated nickel layers. Solutions of sodium tellurite are used for black or blue-black coatings on iron, steel, aluminum, and copper. In microbiology, sodium tellurite can be added to the growth medium to isolate bacteria with an inherent physiological resistance to its toxicity.Borsetti, Francesca; Toninello, Antonio; Zannoni, Davide (2003). \\"Tellurite uptake by cells of the facultative phototroph Rhodobacter capsulatus is a pH-dependent process.\\" Federation of European Biochemical Societies.

A wider-view context of the above cropped image, from a Fujifilm FinePix S5200 camera In photography (particularly digital photography), purple fringing (sometimes called PF) is the term for an unfocused purple or magenta \\"ghost\\" image on a photograph. This optical aberration is generally most visible as a coloring and lightening of dark edges adjacent to bright areas of broad-spectrum illumination, such as daylight or various types of gas- discharge lamps. Lenses in general exhibit axial chromatic aberration, in which different colors of light do not focus in the same plane. Normally, lens designs are optimized so that two or more (at least three for apochromatic lenses) wavelengths of light in the visible spectrum focus at the same plane. Wavelengths very different from those optimized in the design process may be severely out of focus while the reference colors are in focus; this axial chromatic aberration is usually severe at short wavelengths (violet). Lens performance may be poor for such wavelengths in other ways too, including an increase in flare due to anti-reflective coatings also being optimized for the expected wavelengths. Most film has relatively low sensitivity to colors outside the visible range, so light spread in the near ultraviolet (UV) or near infrared (IR) rarely has a significant impact on the image recorded. However, image sensors used in digital cameras commonly are sensitive to a wider range of wavelengths . Although the lens glass itself filters out much of the UV light, and all digital cameras designed for color photography incorporate filters to reduce red and IR sensitivity , the chromatic aberration can be sufficient for unfocused violet light to tint nearby dark regions of the image . Bright cloudy or hazy skies are strong sources of scattered violet and UV light , so they tend to cause the problem. The term purple fringe used to describe one aspect of chromatic aberration dates back to at least 1833. However, Brewster's description with a purple fringe on one edge and a green fringe on the other is a lateral chromatic aberration. A general defocus of the shortest wavelengths resulting in a purple fringe on all sides of a bright object is the result of an axial or longitudinal chromatic aberration. Quite often, these effects are mixed in an image. Axial chromatic aberration is more subject to reduction by stopping down the lens than lateral chromatic aberration is, so the purple fringing can be very dependent on f-number: a larger f-number (smaller aperture) reduces axial aberration. Other explanations Purple fringing is usually attributed to chromatic aberration as described above. Other attributed causes of purple fringing in digital photography include many hypothesized sensor effects: *Digital noise in dark areas *Image processing and interpolation artifacts (almost all CCDs and CMOS require considerable processing) *Stray ultraviolet and/or infrared light *Image bloom from overexposure of CCD sensor (not applied to CMOS) Mitigations Commonly advocated methods of avoiding purple fringing include: * Avoid shooting with a wide-open lens in high contrast scenes * Avoid overexposing highlights (e.g. specular reflections and bright sky behind dark objects) * Shoot with a strong UV-cut filter Post-processing to remove purple fringing (or chromatic aberration in general) usually involves scaling the fringed colour channel, or subtracting some of a scaled version of the blue channel, or other blue-channel tricks.

Founded by Lloyd Jacquet, it supplied the contents of early comics, including that of Marvel Comics #1 (cover-dated Oct. 1939), the first publication of what would become the multimedia corporation Marvel Comics. Company history =Founding= American comic books originated as oversized magazines that reprinted newspaper comic strips in color. These strips, coming from \\"the funny pages\\", were colloquially called \\"the funnies\\". Gradually, new material began to be created for the emerging medium of comic books. In the late 1930s, with the huge sales success of Superman, many magazine publishers and entrepreneurs jumped on the trend. One of the many comics companies founded during this time was Centaur Publications, where Lloyd Jacquet was art director and where comic creators included writer and artist Bill Everett. Jacquet then broke off to form Funnies, Inc., initially called First Funnies, Inc. Located at 45 West 45th Street in Manhattan, New York City, it was one of that era's \\"comic-book packagers\\" that would create comics on demand for publishers. Its competitors included two other comics packagers formed around this time: Eisner & Iger, founded by Will Eisner and Jerry Iger, and the quirkily named Harry \\"A\\" Chesler's studio. Everett recalled in the late 1960s that, Torpey was Centaur's sales director, and Mahon a publisher for one of Centaur's early iterations. Other Centaur staffers who followed Jacquet, on at least a freelance basis, included artists Carl Burgos, Paul Gustavson, and Ben Thompson; writer Ray Gill; and business manager Jim Fitzsimmons. Others who worked for Funnies, Inc. included future novelist Mickey Spillane; Leonard Starr, future creator of the comic strip On Stage; and artist Bob Davis, who for Funnies, Inc. created the boy hero Dick Cole in Novelty Press' Blue Bolt Comics. Robert \\"Bob\\" Davis at the Lambiek Comiclopedia. As Everett described, \\"Lloyd ... had an idea that he wanted to start his own art service ‚Äî to start a small organization to supply artwork and editorial material to publishers. ... He asked me to join him. He also asked Carl Burgos. So we were the nucleus ...\\" Reprinted from Alter Ego (11), 1978. I don't know how to explain it, but I was still on a freelance basis. That was the agreement we had. The artists, including myself, at Funnies, worked on a freelance basis.\\"Everett, Alter Ego, p. 9 Comics historian Hames Ware added that, Planned premiere issue of Motion Picture Funnies Weekly. Cover art, possibly colorized in this scan, generally attributed to Fred Schwab. Funnies, Inc.'s first known project was Motion Picture Funnies Weekly, a promotional comic planned for giveaway in movie theaters.Motion Picture Funnies Weekly at Grand Comics Database The idea proved unsuccessful, and seven of the only eight known samples created to send to theater owners were discovered in an estate sale in 1974. Additionally, proof sheets were found there for the covers of issues #2-4. The \\"Comic Books on Microfiche\\" collection of the University of Tulsa's McFarlin Library lists Centaur Publications' Amazing Man Comics #5 (Sept. 1939), the premiere issue, as continuing the numbering of Motion Picture Funnies Weekly, but this is unconfirmed.Overstreet, listing for Motion Picture Funnies Weekly asks: \\"Amazing Man No. 5 on?\\" =The first Marvel comic= Funnies, Inc.'s first actual sale was to pulp magazine publisher Martin Goodman. As Everett recalled, Funnies, Inc., sales manager Frank Torpey \\"had a friend, Martin Goodman, who was in the publishing business, and Frank talked Martin into going into publishing comics ...\\" For what would be called Marvel Comics #1 (Oct. 1939), Funnies, Inc. created a set of features that included two nascent star characters: Burgos' original Human Torch and Everett's Sub-Mariner, expanding an origin story Everett had created for the never-released Motion Picture Funnies Weekly #1. Reprinted at Among the other characters introduced was Gustavson's the Angel, a modest hit who would appear in more than 100 Golden Age stories. Goodman, whose business strategy involved having a multitude of corporate entities, eventually used Timely Comics as the umbrella name for his comic-book division. Other early companies that bought material from Funnies, Inc. include Centaur, Fox Feature Syndicate, and Hillman Periodicals. For the Novelty Press division of the Premium Service Company, writer-artist Joe Simon created Blue Bolt and Basil Wolverton devised Spacehawk. Simon said that his Funnies, Inc. rate for a completed comic-book page ‚Äî written, drawn and lettered ‚Äî was $7. For comparison, he recalled that at Eisner-Iger ‚Äî where Eisner wrote the features and created characters, hiring novice artists ‚Äî the page rate was approximately $3.50 to $5.50; publishers were charged $5 to $7 per finished page.Simon, Joe, with Jim Simon. The Comic Book Makers Funnies, Inc. was eventually made obsolete by the growing medium's success, allowing publishers to hire their own staffs. As Simon recalled, he stopped freelancing for the company when he became Timely Comics' editor: \\"Soon, we were buying only 'The Human Torch' and 'Sub-Mariner' from Jacquet and irritating the hell out of him with demands for script and art changes in the hopes that he would resign the features he had helped to build\\". Toward the end of 1940, Jacquet sold Goodman the rights to the characters. Business relations evidently remained cordial; in an Aug. 14, 1942, photo given to attendees and widely published by the comics press in the 2000s, Jacquet was seated next to Goodman at a Hotel Astor luncheon Goodman hosted for the Timely and Funnies staffs, followed by a showing of the new Disney movie Bambi. Others at the table included Torpey, Gill, Timely editor Stan Lee, and such artists/writers as Vince Alascia, Ernie Hart, Jack Keller, George Klein, Jim Mooney, Don Rico, Mike Sekowsky, and Syd Shores. =Demise= After Funnies, Inc. ended, Lloyd Jacquet Studios continued to package comics through at least 1949.

It is also, to date, one of only two arcade compilations with both a coin-op and consumer release (the other being Space Invaders Anniversary). Development The collection was developed for the System 573 arcade system - hardware based on the Sony PlayStation architecture.

A look into the software's readme files reveals notes that the original ROM data was used to obtain assets for the reprogrammed games.https://tcrf.net/Konami_80's_AC_Special While the arcade version had an attract mode for certain games, it was replaced with a movie that was created specifically for the home version. In addition, the North American localization got a small history feature, which gave brief blurbs of facts about each of the included games.

All of the swampy land shown in the ward between the Craigie Bridge and West Boston Bridge (now Longfellow Bridge) has since been landfilled and developed. Miller's River (here labeled Miller's Creek) was also filled and is now mainly a railroad yard. The Broad Canal follows Broadway and Portland Street. East Cambridge is a neighborhood of Cambridge, Massachusetts. Referred to in modern times as Area 1, East Cambridge is bounded by the Charles River and the Charlestown neighborhood of Boston on the east, the Somerville border on the north, Broadway and Main Street on the south, and the railroad tracks on the west. Most of the streets form a grid aligned with Cambridge Street, which was laid out to directly connect what is now the Charles River Dam Bridge with what in 1809 was the heart of Cambridge, Harvard Square. The northern part of the grid is a roughly six by eight block residential area. Cambridge Street itself is retail commercial, along with Monsignor O'Brien Highway, the Twin Cities Plaza strip mall, and the enclosed Cambridgeside Galleria. Lechmere Square is the transportation hub for the northern side. The southern half of the grid is largely office and laboratory space for hundreds of dot-com companies, research labs and startups associated with MIT, biotechnology firms including Genzyme and Biogen, the Athenaeum Press Building, light industry, an NRG Energy power station (formerly Mirant Kendall), and various small businesses. This half of the neighborhood is generally identified with Kendall Square. Along the waterfront are several hotels and taller apartment buildings. History and development East Cambridge was originally an island at high tide, surrounded by marshland. The Miller's River, called Willis Creek in colonial times, passed just to the north. The shoreline is shown as Lechmere's Point on Revolutionary War maps, and was the landing point for British troops en route to the Battles of Lexington and Concord.American Experience  Patriots Day  Maps  PBS The investors who constructed Craigie's Bridge encouraged the creation of the grid (which originally only extended to Charles and Sixth). By 1844, the island was connected to destinations on the mainland via a small number of roads: Harvard via Cambridge Street, what is now Kendall Square via Third Street (then Court Street), and two roads to Charlestown/Medford (Gore and Monsignor O'Brien Highway ‚Äì formerly Bridge Street; this was before Somerville split from Charlestown). The area became host to the Middlesex County courthouse designed by Charles Bulfinch; industries like soap, furniture, and the Boston Porcelain and Glass Company; merchants; lawyers; and residences from factory worker cottages to the upscale \\"Quality Row\\" and \\"Millionaire's Row\\". Freight service between neighboring Charlestown and Lowell opened on the Middlesex Canal around 1802, while the Middlesex Turnpike connected Broadway with points north around 1810. The Boston and Lowell Railroad began parallel freight service in 1835. The Fitchburg Railroad opened on the north side of the neighborhood in 1843, while the Grand Junction Railroad (later Boston and Albany Railroad) was constructed on the west side in 1847. A B&A; rail yard north of Binney and Portland fed freight tracks which ran down neighborhood streets (some of which can still be seen) to industrial customers from Rogers and Potter Streets. (The curve of the yard can still be seen on an industrial building on Fulkerson Street, formerly Ninth.) The quirky Meigs Elevated Railway, a steam-powered monorail, ran as a demonstration project in the late 1800s. \\"East Cambridge Begins at The Tracks\\", a controversial slogan in the early 20th century, challenged neighborhood honor between the residents of East Cambridge (Area 1) and Wellington-Harrington (Area 3). Considerable landfill expanded the street grid to nearly its modern configuration by the 1920s, connecting with the surrounding neighborhoods but leaving the Lechmere Canal and part of the Broad Canal. The Miller's River has since been completely filled, except for a small remnant under the I-93 Charlestown interchange. From 1895 to 1940, there was a wide public park between Commercial Street and the Charles River. Designed by Charles Eliot, it was called The Front; part of it was sold for private development in 1950. Another riverside park was eliminated by the Museum of Science, which opened on the Charles River Dam Bridge in 1951. Around 1956‚Äì57, additional ramps, referred to as the Cambridge Viaduct, were installed to double the capacity of Memorial Drive under the Longfellow Bridge. The ramps split the road into two carriageways, westbound using the original First Street underpass, and eastbound using the new viaduct. The new configuration prevents safe pedestrian access to a stairway to the Longfellow Bridge, requiring a longer path of travel than by following the original seawall. The high-rise Middlesex Jail was constructed in 1971 on top of the former Cambridge Superior Courthouse. The 1978 East Cambridge Riverfront Plan resulted in the redirection of traffic to Commercial Street, improving a narrower strip of parkland along Cambridge Parkway for recreational use. A widened Binney Street, the riverside apartment buildings, the CambridgeSide Galleria, and the re-landscaping of the remaining Lechmere Canal with access to The Front were also enabled by this plan. The plan envisioned relocating Lechmere Station to the north side of Monsignor O'Brien Highway with a pedestrian overpass. Since the late 1990s, East Cambridge and its neighbor Lechmere Square have undergone a gentrification process, as old factories have been converted into condominiums and office space. The neighborhood is currently the site of most of large scale developments in Cambridge, including North Point, which plans over a dozen residential towers. In 2011, several new restaurants opened in the Kendall Square area. The relocation of Lechmere Station was made part of a land swap arrangement to be paid for by the NorthPoint developers, but will now be paid for and implemented as part of the Massachusetts Department of Transportation extension of the MBTA Green Line in the 2010s. Demographics There are predominantly Irish and Portuguese natives, with a mix of Polish and Italians along with professionals who work in Boston and Kendall Square. It is predominantly a middle-class neighborhood. Per city data, in 2005 East Cambridge had a population of 7,294 residents living in 2,726 households. The average household income was $47,979. Since 2005 the average household income has risen and real estate values have increased significantly. The boom in Kendall Square area has brought a lot of development and modernization to the area. Notable residents Dorothea Lynde Dix became an advocate for the humane treatment of the insane during the Antebellum era, during which time she volunteered as a Sunday school teacher in East Cambridge.

A worldwide membership of over 250 members, the group believes the \\"deadly cosmic rays\\" are getting in through the hole in the ozone layer. History Organized in May 1984,http://escondidograpevine.com/2015/11/10/meet-the-cosmic-ray- deflection-society-of-north-america/ as a response to reports on the impending destruction of the ozone layer. From the official website: :\\"Knowing, that in some future time, when the ozone layer has been further destroyed by man-made chemicals such as Chlorofluorocarbon and exhaust fumes, the earth and its inhabitants will be mercilessly bombarded by deadly cosmic rays, the Cosmic Ray Deflection Society of North America, Inc. has been organized to discover ways of surviving the coming onslaught...Krudzna Ink is a loosely knit organization of crazed, forward thinking environmentalists dedicated to the survival of the human race in general, and life on the planet in particular...\\" In order to save themselves, members believe: :\\"An Anti-Cosmic Ray Suit (ACRaS) would be constructed! Man-made items that are really unnecessary and have no real value for our lives were attached to a hat and a shirt... By believing the collection of trinkets, tickets, plastics, toys, auto parts, jewelries, beads, buttons, and other trivial items would repel the cosmic rays, the CRs were actually repelled!!!\\" Members of the group call the point at which the cosmic rays actually start being repelled Critical Mass: : \\"As you attach each piece to your cosmic ray deflection item be it hat, shirt, car, house, shield or footgear, you think that this will be the item that gives you critical mass...At some point it actually starts happening!!! We hope...\\" Members also practice unexpected behaviors, according to the Dysonberg Confusion Principle. The society's motto is The Hat Comes First. The triangle formed with thumbtips and the tips of two first fingers is the secret sign to remember ozone, O3 protects all. Since the early days of cosmic ray deflection, several art cars, or Cosmic Ray Deflection Motor Vehicles, have joined the growing collection of CR items. Members are now working on a Cosmic Ray House and Garden with patio in New Orleans, as well as shields for urbanwear. The organization played an important role in the 1996 Black World Wide Web protest and the follow-up Blue Ribbon Online Free Speech Campaign. As a result, free speech issues were added to the organization's activities. Membership The only requirements for membership into the CRDSNA is to build an anti-cosmic ray headpiece, (ACRaH.) and to attempt to read Dhalgren by Samuel R. Delany and The Electric Kool-Aid Acid Test test by Tom Wolfe. A local chapter is approved by getting three members to make ACRaHs. Local chapters hold monthly covered dish meetings to help build a Cosmic Ray Cookbook for future publication. Chapters are urged to adopt a local outsider artist and help see to their daily needs on an ongoing basis. Chapter activities include promoting local environmental and free speech issues. Robert's Rules of Order govern all meetings. Dysonberg confusion principle The Dysonberg confusion principle is the second theory developed by the Cosmic ray Deflection Society, which contends that cosmic rays have a low level of intelligence which allows them to be easily confused by actions contrary to what is considered normal. Once confused, cosmic rays tend to retreat on their own to whence they came. The Cosmic Ray Deflection Society believes that abnormal actions such as wearing Foster Grant brand sunglasses when not famous, lighting fireworks on Christmas, giving gifts on Independence Day, and celebrating the holiday of \\"Valloween\\" on Valentine's Day and Halloween each year confuses the cosmic rays. Then, if the rays are in a sufficient state of confusion, and one is also protected by a cosmic ray suit, one will not be affected by the rays.

The median home price was $2,965,097.https://www.forbes.com/2009/08/26/most-expensive-zip-codes- lifestyle-real-estate-zips_slide_88.html  History  In 1644, England gave Edward Howell of land near the new settlement of Southampton to build a mill for settlers to grind their grain into meal. It became a landmark, and people began referring to other settlements that popped up as \\"east or west of the watermill.\\" By the 1800s, the area was known as Water Mills and was later changed to Water Mill. Howell's Water Mill was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1983. Today, the hamlet boasts its status as the only settlement on the South Fork of Long Island with both a functioning watermill and windmill. Both the Watermill (ref#83004175) and the James Corwith gristmill (ref#78001919) are landmarked in the NRHP. Today Water Mill is a resort community of beautiful beaches, farms and mega mansions. Celebrities and public figures such as Richard Gere, Jennifer Lopez, Matt Lauer, Senator Frank Lautenberg, Steven Schwartzman and Bruce Blakeman have homes or vacationed there.

Biography Olive Dame Campbell was born Olive Arnold Dame in 1882 in Medford, Massachusetts. From a young age, education played an important role in her life, as her father was the head of a private high school. She graduated from Tufts College in 1900 during a time when most women did not pursue higher education. In 1903 she met her future husband John Charles Campbell (1867‚Äì1919), 15 years her senior, who was a missionary school teacher, marrying him in 1907, after which he went on to become a noted educator and social reformer.From ‚ÄúMrs. John Campbell,‚Äù Southern Mountain Life and Work (April 1925):6 Olive was Campbell's second wife, and together they traveled to Appalachia, where John had received a grant in 1909 to study the area's social and cultural conditions in hopes of improving their school systems. While there, Olive noted that ballads sung by the residents had strong ties to both English and Scots-Irish folk songs. The ballads that she collected would eventually be published as English Folk Songs from the Southern Appalachians by Cecil Sharp and Olive D. Campbell in 1917.John Charles Campbell and Olive D. Campbell Papers, 1865‚Äì1962, Southern Historical Collection, The Wilson Library, University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill. http://www.lib.unc.edu/mss/inv/c/Campbell,John_Charles_and_Olive_D.html#d1e195 This collection would later influence several productions, particularly the 2000 drama film Songcatcher. After only 12 years of marriage, Olive's husband John died in 1919. After his death, Olive worked on collecting and organizing his notes from their work together so that a report of his survey could be published. Attempting to follow the writing style of her husband as much as possible, Olive Campbell successfully published ‚ÄúThe Southern Highlander and His Homeland‚Äù in 1921 under John's name. In 1922 Olive was back to work and ready to embark on a trip to Copenhagen via a fellowship provided by the American-Scandinavian Foundation in order to study the Danish Folk School style of education, in hopes of finding a way to revitalize the local Appalachian school system.Henry Leach, 1922, The American-Scandinavian Review, Vol.10, No.1, American Scandinavian, NY, 437. Accompanied by her sister Daisy Dame and colleague Marguerite Butler, the women spent 18 months traveling between Denmark, Norway, Sweden, and Finland, visiting local schools along the way.Marguerite Butler Bidstrip, ‚ÄúTo Denmark,‚Äù Mountain Life and Work 4 (1954): 14. In 1925 upon her return, Olive founded the John C. Campbell Folk School in Brasstown, North Carolina. This folkehjskoler, or folk school dedicated to her late husband was based on noncompetitive Scandinavian schools for common people, where no grades were given and no one ever failed. Instead, students and teachers formed a community that worked together in the process of improving their quality of life through education. Keith House, the heart of the school was built on land donated by the parents of Fred O. Scruggs, with materials and labor pledged and donated by local people who were delighted to have a school dedicated to their well being. At first the curriculum centered around improving agricultural practices to relieve poverty. For decades regional folk dancing was also encouraged. With Olive's encouragement, idle men sitting outside of Fred O. Scruggs' General Store found a way to bring much-needed income to their families by carving realistic animals. The Brasstown Carvers began with Olive's designs then branched into original work. Olive continued to work in collecting ballads and handicrafts until her death in 1954. She was known for her meticulous preservation of ballads, her sense of humor, and her attentive listening. While she had no surviving children, the legacy of her work in collecting crafts and ballads, along with the founding of the John C. Campbell Folk School, lives on today. Legacy Today the Folk School attracts students from all over the country (and some from abroad) while still offering people from the surrounding Appalachian area ways to improve their quality of life. Traditions such as Morning Song give students the opportunity to begin their day with stories and songs from the region. Staff, work-studies, and visiting students dine together family-style on freshly prepared foods in the dining hall bearing Olive Dame Campbell's name. Some of the vegetables, fruit, and honey come from the Folk School's own organic garden. On Tuesday nights live music and a caller are provided so that students and neighbors can get a taste of the Folk School's decades old tradition of contra dancing. On Saturday nights free concerts attract community members to the school. At the end of a week of course work students come together in Keith House to share examples of the work they have created. After renovations and enhancements, based on student, faculty, and staff feedback, the Folk School's blacksmithing program has become the best in the world. The original blacksmith's shop was built with help from the AFSC, American Friends Service Committee. A wide variety of classes last from a single weekend to an entire week. In addition to blacksmithing, offerings include ceramics, spinning, weaving, dying, wood carving, woodworking on a lathe, furniture construction, book arts, painting, mixed media, garden art, gardening, landscaping, nature studies, cooking, masonry, storytelling, writing, singing, and the construction of musical instruments. The classes allow people to come together and enjoy learning in a relaxed, nonjudgmental atmosphere. The Folk School's motto \\"Sing Behind the Plow\\" is a reminder of Olive Dame Campbell's original vision of finding a joyous way for people to improve their quality of life through the experience of community.A Unique History, The John C. Campbell Folk School in Brasstown, North Carolina, https://www.folkschool.org/index.php?section=articles&article;_cat_id=5&article;_id=5 In 2008 Revels Repertory Company created a tribute to Olive and the music she collected titled Voices from the Mountain, which was performed throughout eastern Massachusetts during the 2008/2009 and 2009/2010 seasons.Revels Repertory company . IN 2012, Revels Repertory Company was disbanded, and In Good Company, Inc. was formed by the former members of Revels Repertory Company.

It was invented in Great Britain during the Industrial Revolution. The molten pig iron was stirred in a reverberatory furnace, in a oxidizing environment, resulting in wrought iron. It was one of the most important processes of making the first appreciable volumes of valuable and useful bar iron (malleable wrought iron) without the use of charcoal. Eventually, the furnace would be used to make small quantities of specialty steels. Though it was not the first process to produce bar iron without charcoal, puddling was by far the most successful, and replaced the earlier potting and stamping processes, as well as the much older charcoal finery and bloomery processes. This enabled a great expansion of iron production to take place in Great Britain, and shortly afterwards, in North America. That expansion constitutes the beginnings of the Industrial Revolution so far as the iron industry is concerned. Most 19th century applications of wrought iron, including the Eiffel Tower, bridges, and the original framework of the Statue of Liberty, used puddled iron. Later the furnaces were also used to produce a good-quality carbon steel. This was a highly skilled art, and both high-carbon and low-carbon steels were successfully produced on a small scale, particularly for the gateway technology of tool steel as well as high quality swords, knives and other weapons. History The wuchaoni refining process described in Tiangong Kaiwu encyclopedia published in 1637, written by Song Yingxing, shows some similarities with an early puddling process. Refining steel by puddling metal was already known in ancient China during the Han Dynasty by the 1st century AD. The advance in steel making processes improved the overall quality of steel by repeated forging, folding, and stacking of wrought iron from pig iron to make swords. Modern puddling was one of several processes developed in the second half of the 18th century in Great Britain for producing bar iron from pig iron without the use of charcoal. It gradually replaced the earlier charcoal-fueled process, conducted in a finery forge. = The need for puddling = Pig iron contains much free carbon and is brittle. Before it can be used, and before it can be worked by a blacksmith, it must be converted to a more malleable form as bar iron, the early stage of wrought iron. Abraham Darby's successful use of coke for his blast furnace at Coalbrookdale in 1709 reduced the price of iron, but this coke-fuelled pig iron was not initially accepted as it could not be converted to bar iron by the existing methods. Sulphur impurities from the coke made it 'hot short', or brittle when heated, and so the finery process was unworkable for it. It was not until around 1750, when steam powered blowing increased furnace temperatures enough to allow sufficient lime to be added to remove the sulfur, that coke pig iron began to be adopted. Also, better processes were developed to refine it. = Invention = Abraham Darby II, son of the blast furnace innovator, managed to convert pig iron to bar iron in 1749, but no details are known of his process. The Cranage brothers, also working alongside the River Severn, achieved this experimentally by using a coal-fired reverbatory furnace, in which the iron and the sulphurous coal could be kept separate. They were the first to hypothesise that iron could be converted from pig iron to bar iron by the action of heat alone. Although they were unaware of the necessary effects of the oxygen supplied by the air, they had at least abandoned the previous misapprehension that mixture with materials from the fuel were needed. Their experiments were successful and they were granted patent N¬∫851 in 1766, but no commercial adoption seems to have been made of their process. In 1783, Peter Onions at Dowlais constructed a larger reverbatory furnace. He began successful commercial puddling with this and was granted patent N¬∫1370. The puddling furnace was improved by Henry Cort at Fontley in Hampshire in 1783‚Äì84 and patented in 1784. Cort added dampers to the chimney, avoiding some of the risk of overheating and 'burning' the iron. Cort's process consisted of stirring molten pig iron in a reverberatory furnace in an oxidising atmosphere, thus decarburising it. When the iron \\"came to nature\\", that is, to a pasty consistency, it was gathered into a puddled ball, shingled, and rolled (as described below). This application of grooved rollers to the rolling mill, to roll narrow bars, was also Cort's invention. Cort was successful in licensing this process and receiving revenue from it, even from ironworks like Cyfarthfa, where the earlier process had been invented previously by their neighbours at Dowlais. Cort is now generally regarded as the 'inventor' of puddling. Ninety years after Cort's invention, an American labor newspaper recalled the advantages of his system: > \\"When iron is simply melted and run into any mold, its texture is granular, > and it is so brittle as to be quite unreliable for any use requiring much > tensile strength. The process of puddling consisted in stirring the molten > iron run out in a puddle, and had the effect of so changing its anotomic > arrangement as to render the process of rolling more efficacious.\\"\\"The > Puddling of Iron,\\" The Workingman's Advocate [Chicago], vol. 9, no. 9 > (January 25, 1873), pg. 1. Cort's process (as patented) only worked for white cast iron, not grey cast iron, which was the usual feedstock for forges of the period. This problem was resolved probably at Merthyr Tydfil by combining puddling with one element of a slightly earlier process. This involved another kind of hearth known as a 'refinery' or 'running out fire'.Referred to as a \\"finery\\" and \\"run-out fire\\" by Overman, but not to be confused with the finery in the finery forge. The pig iron was melted in this and run out into a trough. The slag separated, and floated on the molten iron, and was removed by lowering a dam at the end of the trough. The effect of this process was to desiliconise the metal, leaving a white brittle metal, known as 'finers metal'. This was the ideal material to charge to the puddling furnace. This version of the process was known as 'dry puddling' and continued in use in some places as late as 1890. The alternative to refining gray iron was known as 'wet puddling', also known as 'boiling' or 'pig boiling'. This was invented by a puddler named Joseph Hall at Tipton. He began adding scrap iron to the charge. Later he tried adding iron scale (in effect, rust). The result was spectacular in that the furnace boiled violently. This was a chemical reaction between the oxidised iron in the scale and the carbon dissolved in the pig iron. To his surprise, the resultant puddle ball produced good iron. One big problem with puddling was that almost 50% of the iron was drawn off with the slag because sand was used for the bed. Hall substituted roasted tap cinder for the bed, which cut this waste to 8%, declining to 5% by the end of the century. Hall subsequently became a partner in establishing the Bloomfield Iron Works at Tipton in 1830, the firm becoming Bradley, Barrows and Hall from 1834. This is the version of the process most commonly used in the mid to late 19th century. Wet puddling had the advantage that it was much more efficient than dry puddling (or any earlier process). The best yield of iron achievable from dry puddling is a ton of iron from 1.3 tons of pig iron (a yield of 77%), but the yield from wet puddling was nearly 100%. The production of mild steel in the puddling furnace was achieved circa 1850 in Westphalia, Germany and was patented in Great Britain on behalf of Lohage, Bremme and Lehrkind. It worked only with pig iron made from certain kinds of ore. The cast iron had to be melted quickly and the slag to be rich in manganese. When the metal came to nature, it had to be removed quickly and shingled before further carburisation occurred. The process was taken up at the Low Moor Ironworks at Bradford in Yorkshire (England) in 1851 and in the Loire valley in France in 1855. It was widely used. The puddling process began to be displaced with the introduction of the Bessemer process, which produced steel. This could be converted into wrought iron using the Aston process for a fraction of the cost and time. For comparison, an average size charge for a puddling furnace was while a Bessemer converter charge was (13,600 kg). The puddling process could not be scaled up, being limited by the amount that the puddler could handle. It could only be expanded by building more furnaces. Process Exterior view of a single puddling furnace. A. Damper; B. Work door The process begins by preparing the puddling furnace. This involves bringing the furnace to a low temperature and then fettling it. Fettling is the process of painting the grate and walls around it with iron oxides, typically hematite; this acts as a protective coating keeping the melted metal from burning through the furnace. Sometimes finely pounded cinder was used instead of hematite. In this case the furnace must be heated for 4‚Äì5 hours to melt the cinder and then cooled before charging. Either white cast iron or refined iron is then placed in hearth of the furnace, a process known as charging. For wet puddling, scrap iron and/or iron oxide is also charged. This mixture is then heated until the top melts, allowing for the oxides to begin mixing; this usually takes 30 minutes. This mixture is subjected to a strong current of air and stirred by long bars with hooks on one end, called puddling bars or rabbles,W. K. V. Gale, The Iron and Steel Industry: a Dictionary of Terms (David and Charles, Newton Abbot 1971), 165. through doors in the furnace.R. F. Tylecote, 'Iron in the Industrial Revolution' in R. F. Tylecote, The Industrial Revolution in Metals (Institute of Metals, London 1991), 236-40. This helps the oxygen from the oxides to react with impurities in the pig iron, notably silicon, manganese (to form slag) and to some degree sulfur and phosphorus, which form gases that escape with the exhaust of the furnace. More fuel is then added and the temperature raised. The iron completely melts and the carbon starts to burn off. When wet puddling, the formation of carbon dioxide due to reactions with the added iron oxide will cause bubbles to form that cause the mass to appear to boil. This process causes the slag to puff up on top, giving the rabbler a visual indication of the progress of the combustion. As the carbon burns off, the melting temperature of the mixture rises from ,W. K. V. Gale, The British Iron and Steel Industry (David and Charles, Newton Abbot, 1967), 70‚Äì79. so the furnace has to be continually fed during this process. The melting point increases since the carbon atoms within the mixture act as a solute in solution which lowers the melting point of the iron mixture (like road salt on ice). Working as a two-man crew, a puddler and helper could produce about 1500 kg of iron in a 12-hour shift. The strenuous labor, heat and fumes caused puddlers to have a very short life expectancy, with most dying in their 30s. Puddling was never able to be automated because the puddler had to sense when the balls had \\"come to nature\\".

Cast iron retaining plates; H. Bridge wall The puddling furnace is a metalmaking technology used to create wrought iron or steel from the pig iron produced in a blast furnace. The furnace is constructed to pull the hot air over the iron without the fuel coming into direct contact with the iron, a system generally known as a reverberatory furnace or open hearth furnace. The major advantage of this system is keeping the impurities of the fuel separated from the charge. Double puddling furnace layout The hearth is where the iron is charged, melted and puddled. The hearth's shape is usually elliptical; in length and wide. If the furnace is designed to puddle white iron then the hearth depth is never more than . If the furnace is designed to boil gray iron then the average hearth depth is . Due to the great heat required to melt the charge the grate had to be cooled, lest it melt with the charge. This was done by running a constant flow of cool air on it, or by throwing water on the bottom of the grate. The fireplace, where the fuel is burned, used a cast iron grate which varied in size depending on the fuel used. If bituminous coal is used then an average grate size is and is loaded with of coal. If anthracite coal is used then the grate is and is loaded with of coal. A double puddling furnace is similar to a single puddling furnace, with the major difference being there are two work doors allowing two puddlers to work the furnace at the same time. The biggest advantage of this setup is that it produces twice as much wrought iron. It is also more economical and fuel efficient compared to a single furnace.

It is native to the northern hemisphere, and considered an invasive species in Australia, Argentina, New Zealand, and Chile. Even within its native range, it has taken on invasive characteristics since the 1980s. It is not considered a significant human health risk, but it can affect stream habitats and sources of food for fish and make recreational activities unpleasant. This microscopic alga can be spread in a single drop of water. Description Scanning electron micrograph of the silica cell wall of D. geminata. Scale bar is 50 Œºm. Image by Sarah Spaulding, USGS. Didymosphenia geminata is a diatom, which is a type of single-celled organism unique for their silica (SiO2) cell walls. The life history of diatoms includes both vegetative and sexual reproduction, though the sexual stage is not yet documented in this species. Although it is symmetric only along the apical axis, typical of gomphonemoid diatoms, it is a cymbelloid, which are typically symmetric along both primary axes. Cells contain a raphe, which allows them to move on surfaces, and an apical porefield, through which a mucopolysaccharide stalk is secreted. The stalk can attach to rocks, plants, or other submerged surfaces. When the diatom cell divides, through vegetative reproduction, the stalk divides too, eventually forming a mass of branching stalks. The nuisance build-up is not the cell itself, but their massive production of extracellular stalks. Extracellular polymeric substances (EPS) that form the stalks are made primarily of polysaccharides and protein, forming complex, multi-layered structures that are resistant to degradation. Native range The native distribution of D. geminata is the cool temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere, including the rivers of northern forests and alpine regions of Europe, Asia and parts of North America. Until its recent discovery in New Zealand, where it was introduced, it was never previously found in the Southern Hemisphere. The distribution of didymo in the last two decades appears to be gradually expanding outside its native range. Even within its native range, there have been reports of excessive growths in areas where it previously existed only in low concentrations.

Leave them at the site. If you find clumps later don't wash them down the drain, treat them with the approved methods below, dry them and soak them in bleach for at least 4 hours. Clean: Soak and scrub all items for at least one minute in either hot (60 ¬∞C) water, a 2% solution of household bleach, antiseptic hand cleaner, or dishwashing detergent. Dry: If cleaning is not practical (e.g. livestock, pets), after the item is completely dry wait an additional 48 hours before contact or use in any other waterway. New Zealand and the U.S. states of Alaska, Maryland, South Dakota and Vermont have banned anglers from wearing felt-soled boots.

If approved at referendum, the model would have established Australia as a republic with a Head of State appointed by the Australian Federal Parliament. The model was put to the people at the November 1999 republican referendum and was defeated by 54.4% of voters. Model details Under the model, nominations for the Head of State or President could have been made by any Australian citizen or group of citizens. These would have been received by a nominations committee established by Parliament. The committee would provide a report to the Prime Minister on the most suitable candidates for the position. The Prime Minister would select a candidate after securing support from the Leader of the Opposition. This bi- partisan part of the procedure gives the model its name. The formal appointment of the Head of State would have been made in a joint sitting of Parliament, attended by members of both the Senate and House of Representatives. A special two-thirds majority would have been required to ratify the candidate's appointment as Head of State. The powers of the proposed Head of State would not have been substantially different from those of the Queen and Governor General. The Head of State would have been vested with the powers of executive government, but those powers would have been normally exercised on the advice of ministers. Under the model, the term of the Head of State would have been five years. The Head of State could have been removed by the Prime Minister but this decision would have been subject to confirmation by the House of Representatives within thirty days. Any vacancy in the post would have been temporarily filled by the longest-serving state governor. Rationale If implemented, the model would have established an Australian Republic by removing constitutional links to the monarchy. References to either Queen or Governor-General in the Australian constitution would have been replaced by a reference to the President of Australia. Supporters of the model argued that the appointed President would carry out his or her duties in a very similar fashion to the current Governor-General, as the method of appointment requires the combined support of the major political parties. The President would continue to act on the advice of the Prime Minister, as to do otherwise would invite dismissal. Consequently, the change to a republic is argued to have minimal impact on the rest of Australia's parliament and government. Although the 1999 referendum was limited to the federal jurisdiction, the model is able to be adopted with little modification by each of the six Australian states to formally break ties with the monarchy. Critique of the model The model was criticised for its lack of democratic qualities. The Head of State is not elected by the people and the Prime Minister may legally ignore all nominations made by ordinary citizens. The model was specifically criticised for allowing the Prime Minister to dismiss the Head of State. The model was also criticised for its bi-partisan mechanism. According to some, the deliberate seeking of support by the Prime Minister to the Opposition Leader, who are by definition political adversaries, may influence the outcome of other policy contests. The mandate implicitly conferred by two-thirds of the parliament may encourage the President to make use of reserve powers. History The model was originally developed by legal academic George Winterton, and influenced by systems used in Europe. The central concept was for a President, appointed by a two-thirds majority of parliament. Subsequent to a judicial process, the President could be dismissed by an absolute majority in both houses of parliament. After consulting with other experts, the proposal with drafted amendments was published in the Independent Monthly, March 1992 and was supported by the Australian Republican Movement (ARM). In 1993 the model was reviewed as one of four options by the Republic Advisory Committee, chaired by Malcolm Turnbull who shortly after became ARM chairman. Prime Minister Paul Keating presented a slightly altered version, providing both appointment and dismissal by a two- thirds majority of parliament. He declared that this version, often called the Keating-Turnbull Model, should be put to the people. Under Prime Minister John Howard, the model was closely examined and criticised at the 1998 constitutional convention. The model evolved to incorporate a nominations committee and authority to dismiss the Head of State was taken from the parliament and given to the Prime Minister. With these changes, the model was supported by a simple majority of 73 out of 152 delegates, 22 abstaining. An absolute majority of 89 then agreed it should be put to the people. At the 1999 Australian republic referendum, the model was supported by opposition parties, progressives and some conservatives who feared a future directly elected president, while monarchists and those favouring other republican models rejected it. The referendum failed, with especially large majorities against in rural and outer suburban electorates. After the defeat, the Australian Republican Movement downgraded the model's status from preferred to one of six possible options. Its long-term future is likely to depend on the result of a proposed models plebiscite, which would allow electors to directly show their support for this version of republicanism.

Aman Verma, Samir Soni, Saahil Chadha and Nasir Khan portray Bachchan and Malini's four sons. Mahima Chaudhry, Paresh Rawal, Rimi Sen and Lilette Dubey are featured in important supporting roles. This film was an unofficial adaptation of the highly acclaimed 1937 Hollywood film Make Way for Tomorrow which had been adapted on screen multiple times - in Japanese in 1953 as Tokyo Story , in Marathi in 1954 as Oon Paus , in Kannada in 1958 as School Master (which was remade in four languages including in Hindi in 1959 as School Master), in Urdu in 1972 as Samaj, in Hindi in 1976 as Zindagi , in Tamil in 1990 as Varavu Nalla Uravu ( which was remade in two languages). Baghban was remade in Kannada as Ee Bandhana in 2007, starring Vishnuvardhan and Jaya Pradha in the lead roles. The film was critically acclaimed, especially for the on-screen chemistry between Bachchan and Malini who came together 20 years after Nastik (1983). Their performances in the film were highly lauded.  Plot  The movie tells the story of Pooja Malhotra (Hema Malini), her husband Raj (Amitabh Bachchan), and their four sons Ajay (Aman Verma), Sanjay (Samir Soni), Rohit (Saahil Chadda), and Karan (Nasirr Khan). The couple has provided their children with everything, often at the cost of Pooja's and Raj's own requirements. The Malhotras have an adopted son Alok (Salman Khan), who is in love with Arpita (Mahima Chaudhry). Alok was an orphan and Raj provided him with money and education, bringing him up as his own son. Now a successful man, Alok worships Raj because of all his help and thinks of him as his father. An elderly couple wish their children to care for them in their old age. But their children see and treat them as a burden, and they must struggle to regain their worth and dignity to themselves and others. Raj has a flourishing job. But, once he retires, he is unable to support himself and has to vacate the house he and Pooja have shared for years. They decide to live with their kids to enjoy their love and affection. However, their kids do not want them. The children decide to split the parents up, each parent going to live with one of the sons for the next six months. The children think their parents will refuse the offer and therefore, they will remain in their home. However, the parents reluctantly accept the offer. The parents endure this separation as well as horrible treatment from their children, after all they have sacrificed for them. Their grandson, Rahul, is the only one who gives Raj love and affection. Saddened by the treatment he has received from his children and their families, Raj writes down his feelings about how he fulfilled his children's dreams and, in return, how they treat him, as well as his love for his wife, and how much pain their separation has caused. His writing eventually becomes a novel. Pooja, meanwhile, endures abuse from her son and daughter-in-law (Suman Ranganathan), as well as her granddaughter, Payal (Rimi Sen). Payal, though, realizes her mistake when Pooja saves her from her boyfriend's (Harsh Vashisth) sexual advances and nurtures Pooja with love. While changing their trains after six months, Pooja and Raj spend some time together in Vijaynagar. By chance they meet Alok there, he takes them to his home and gives them the importance and care which their real sons did not. Raj finds out that his writing has become a published book named Baghban. This book becomes a big hit, selling the first copies immediately. Raj, as a result, gains the money he needs to support himself and Pooja in their old age. Their sons ask their parents for forgiveness to achieve this end. Payal and Rahul (Sanjay's son), though, realize their true motives and refuse to come with their parents. Raj is honored for his work, and the four sons attend with their wives. But when they ask Pooja and Raj to forgive them, they instead refuse and disown them for the pain their sons have put them through.

R. Chopra had planned to make this movie in the mid- eighties, with Dilip Kumar and Raakhee in the lead roles. Mohnish Behl was offered Aman Verma's role; he did not accept it because he did not want to be portrayed as the father of a 15-year-old girl. Juhi Chawla was selected for the role of Salman Khan's wife but could not accept because of her pregnancy. Shah Rukh Khan was offered the role played by Salman Khan. Amitabh Bachchan and Hema Malini were paired opposite each other 20 years after Nastik in 1983. Aamir Khan and Saif Ali Khan were also offered Salman Khan's role in the film. Amitabh Bachchan sang three songs himself. Baghban was the last unofficial partnership between the legendary Salim‚ÄìJaved screenwriter duo, Salim Khan and Javed Akhtar. Amitabh Bachchan requested that Javed Akhtar write his final speech in the movie. Salman Khan, requested his father Salim Khan to write his speech in the movie. Neither Salim Khan nor Javed Akhtar were credited. Ravi Chopra, the director of the film, denied that this was a remake of the Rajesh Khanna-Shabana Azmi starrer Avtaar. He said that the plot of that film was about a father seeking revenge on his children while this film just focused on the bond between an old couple. He also commented that just because this film is based on family relations they are comparing it to Avtaar. He said that just because a story revolves around the same relationship it doesn't make it alike as films can explore different aspects of that same relationship.  Reception  Baghban was premiered at the Leeds International Film Festival, England. It was critically acclaimed and went on to become one of Chopra's biggest hits. The film received an award at the EMVIE 2004 for best media innovation, cinema for the in-film placement of the ICICI group done by Group M. As per Filmfare, Baghban was made at a budget of and made a domestic collections of while it fetched from overseas market.

He married Octavia Major, the elder half-sister of Augustus, by whom he had at least one son, also named Sextus Appuleius (II). It is postulated that he had a second son, Marcus Appuleius, the consul of 20 BC.Syme, Ronald, Augustan Aristocracy (1989), p. 37 It is possible that this Sextus Appuleius was Flamen Iulialis.ILS 8963; CarthagePollini, J., 'Ahenobarbi, Appuleii and Some Others on the Ara Pacis', pp. 456-8Syme, R., Augustan Aristocracy (1989), p. 152  Sextus Appuleius II (consul 29 BC)  Sextus Appuleius II was son of the above and Octavia Major, the elder half-sister of Augustus. The year of his birth is uncertain, but, based the date of his consulship, was probably very close to 60 BC. This Sextus Appuleius achieved a number of notable offices during the regime of his half-uncle. He was ordinary consul with Augustus in 29 BC. He then served as proconsul of Hispania in 28 BC, then as proconsul of Asia 23-22 BC. As a result of some unspecified event during this proconsulship he was granted a Roman Triumph in January 26 BC.Syme, R., Augustan Aristocracy (1989), p. 317 He seems also to have served as governor of Illyricum in 8 BC, succeeding Tiberius in that post. He was a member of the college of augurs.Braund, D., Augustus to Nero: A Source Book on Roman History 31 BC - AD 68 (1985), p. 129 It is likely that this Sextus Appuleius, and not his father, was Flamen Iulialis.Pollini, J., 'Ahenobarbi, Appuleii and Some Others on the Ara Pacis', pp. 457f It is also just possible that the son succeeded the father to the post (as did the father and son Lentulus Maluginensis to the post of Flamen Dialis). It has been proposed that the middle-aged flamen on the Ara Pacis is this Sextus Appuleius in his role as Flamen Iulialis.Pollini, J., 'Ahenobarbi, Appuleii and Some Others on the Ara Pacis', p. 458 According to an inscription in the province of Asia, he had married a woman named Quinctilia, who was a sister to the Roman politician and general Publius Quinctilius Varus.Syme, R., Augustan Aristocracy (1989), p. 316 By her, he had a son, also named Sextus Appuleius, and a daughter, Appuleia Varilla. The date of his death is unknown.  Sextus Appuleius III (consul AD 14)  Sextus Appuleius III was the son of the previous and Quinctilia. This Sextus Appuleius was also a half-great- nephew of Augustus via his father. His career is largely unknown, except that he became ordinary consul in the year 14.Syme, R., Augustan Aristocracy (1989), p. 318 It was during his consulship that Augustus died and was succeeded by Tiberius. As a magistrate, Appuleius was the first to swear allegiance to Tiberius.Tacitus, Annals I.8 He was married to Fabia Numantina, a daughter of either Africanus Fabius Maximus, or Paullus Fabius Maximus and Marcia, a maternal cousin of Augustus (daughter of Atia, his aunt, and his step-brother Philippus).Syme, R., Augustan Aristocracy (1989), pp. 417f Appuleius and Fabia had one son, also named Sextus Appuleius (IV). It is assumed Appuleius died not long after 14 because he is not mentioned subsequent to his consulship. His death is not recorded by Tacitus in the surviving part of The Annals, suggesting that it occurred during the period covered in the missing portion of book 5 (i.e. AD 30-31) or after book 6 (i.e. after AD 37). He was survived by his wife Fabia Numantina.  Sextus Appuleius IV (great-grandson of Octavia Major) The son of the previous and Fabia Numantina. He was born sometime in the early 1st century, but died young; his tombstone at Luna,ILS 935 set up by his mother, refers to him as \\"the last of his family\\" (the Appuleii).

As an epidemiologist and physician, he focused on reducing tobacco smoking. He served on Vancouver City Council from 1999 to 2005. Background Bass was born in New York City, attended Antioch College, Case-Western Reserve Medical School, Harvard School of Public Health, and Johns Hopkins School of Hygiene and Public Health. He served as a preventive medicine officer in the US Army's 7th Infantry Division in Korea and Fort Monmouth, New Jersey. After his military service, he was a tuberculosis control officer for the New Jersey Department of Health and unit medical health officer. He earned a master's degree in epidemiology at the Harvard School of Public Health and a Doctor of Science at Johns Hopkins, writing a thesis on medical care use attributable to cigarette smoking. He taught at the University of Pennsylvania. Anti-tobacco work In 1975, Bass began working with the Vancouver health department as a preventive medicine and epidemiology specialist. Soon after, he founded the Tobacco and Illness Committee of the BC Medical Association, and chaired the committee for two decades. With the Vancouver health department, he became Canada's first director of health promotion. In 1989, Bass founded the B.C. Doctors' Stop-Smoking Program, which educated doctors about ways to help addicted patients quit. This program evolved into the Society for Clinical Preventive Care in 1997. Lee Bacchus of the Vancouver Sun called him \\"perhaps the most passionate and dauntless anti-smoking advocate in the province.\\" Known for having a quirky side, his initiatives included hiring a plane to fly an anti-tobacco banner at a fireworks event that was sponsored by Benson & Hedges, and organizing a race with live turkeys in Robson Square to publicize a cold-turkey campaign. In the late 1980s to mid 1990s, after years of pressure from the BC Medical Association, the provincial government introduced a series of laws against tobacco advertising and sales of tobacco products to minors, and banned indoor smoking in all public places. In 2001 he was given a Canadian Medical Association Honorary Membership for his work in tobacco control. Bass himself had started smoking at age 16, and was a pack-a-day smoker when he quit at age 28. \\"Because I smoked,\\" he said in 1998, \\"I know the many positive aspects of smoking and I can understand what's going on inside the head of the smoker. Early involvement with Vancouver politics In 1989‚Äì90, Bass served on Vancouver's Clouds of Change Task Force which addressed the issues of global climate change. Bass, concerned about global warming, entered electoral politics in 1996 as a candidate for Vancouver's civic Green Party under the leadership of Stuart Parker but was defeated by a wide margin. With the support of the Greens' executive and provincial leadership, he sought and won the nomination of the Coalition of Progressive Electors (COPE), the party with which the Greens had just inked a coalition agreement. Elected city councillor Bass was first elected to city council in 1999 as a member of COPE, and topped the polls when re-elected in 2002 with 70,525 votes. His political priorities were action on the environment and transit. Bass was outspoken in his opposition to the expansion of gambling and to excessive expenditures for rapid transit by a faction of his party under the leadership of Mayor Larry Campbell. In order to encourage cycling and walking, Bass introduced a controversial motion in 2005 to explore devoting two lanes of the six-lane Burrard Bridge for cycling (cyclists had been sharing the sidewalk with pedestrians). His first step was a minimal-cost trial of using one lane in each direction for bicycles, reserving the existing sidewalk for pedestrians. A plan to widen the bridge sidewalks was slated to cost $13 million if Bass's $2 million trial failed. Some cyclists applauded the move, though other users of the current bridge sidewalks questioned whether any changes were necessary. Concerns about motorist rage did not deter Bass, who stated \\"Motorists called for my head long ago and my head is still on my neck.\\" Heritage advocates strongly supported the bicycle trial, since the sidewalk-widening would impair the heritage value of this landmark, art- deco bridge. In 2005, three COPE councillors and the mayor split from the party to form Vision Vancouver. Bass and councillors Tim Louis, David Cadman, Anne Roberts and Ellen Woodsworth remained in COPE. Bass was not re-elected in the 2005 election, finishing 12th overall with 48,248 votes. In late 2006 he announced his aspiration to run for mayor in the next Vancouver civic election because of his concerns for respect, global warming, homelessness and lack of affordable housing. In August 2007, he announced that he no longer intended to participate in the mayoral race. Environmental activism Bass described his anti-smoking work as \\"practice\\" for campaigning against global warming. In May 2012, Bass was one of several protesters arrested in White Rock, BC for blocking a train that was carrying American coal destined for shipment to Asia. In 2019, Bass began to facilitate public workshops on \\"eco-resilience\\", which he describes as the capacity for individuals, households, communities, and ecosystems to respond to the stresses of environmental collapse. Personal life Bass's family comes from an Orthodox Jewish tradition. While he was studying for his undergraduate degree, he became involved in a work- study project in Alaska that was led by Quakers. He remained connected with Quaker communities thereafter, and in later life became a Quaker. He also practices Soto Zen Buddhism. Bass has four adult children, two with his long- term partner Roma Dehr, and two from a previous marriage.

It is a fourth order river of France and a left-bank tributary of the Aisne. It is long, and rises in the d√©partement of Marne through which it flows most of its course. Geography The Vesle flows through the following d√©partements and towns: *Marne: Courtisols, Reims, Fismes *Aisne: Braine It rises at an elevation of about , on the dip slope of the Upper Cretaceous chalk, near the village of Somme-Vesle, east of Ch√¢lons-en-Champagne. Though still passing through the chalk country, it soon begins to flow on its own Holocene deposits. It passes through Reims (latitude 49¬∞ 15‚Äô 57‚Äô‚Äô N, longitude 4¬∞ 1‚Äô 46‚Äô‚Äô E). On leaving the city's western outskirts, it enters the much more wooded landscape of the Eocene geology.Anon, Carte g√©ologique de la France √† l'√©chelle du millioni√®me (2003) The info box photograph shows the Vesle as it passes through fen carr, a little downstream from Reims. Halfway From Reims to Soissons, at Fismes (Latitude 49¬∞ 18' 28\\" N Longitude 03¬∞ 40' 53\\" E) the river receives the river Ardre from its left bank. At Cond√©-sur-Aisne, having descended to an elevation of about , the Vesle joins the Aisne. =Communications= From Sept Saulx, some 20 km. above Reims, and into the city, the river is paralleled by the Aisne to Marne Canal. Below Reims, its valley accommodates the road, now the N31/E46, between the two former Gaulish tribal centres of Reims and Soissons.Anon Michelin France 2002 Tourist and Motoring Atlas (2001) = Tributaries = * The Noblette joins from the right bank near Vadenay; * the Cheneu joins from the right bank at Mourmelon-le-Petit; * the Fosse joins from the left bank at Muizon. * The Ardre is its principal tributary. It joins from the left bank, at Fismes. = Flow rates of the Vesle at Braine = The Vesle is a river of medium flow, like most which come from the chalkland of the Champagne-Ardenne r√©gion. Its flow was recorded over a period of 34 years (1967-2000), at Braine, in the department of Aisne. That is to say a little short of its confluence with the Aisne.fr. Banque Hydro - station H6432010 - La Vesle √† Braine. (Do not tick (check) the box \\"Station en service\\".) The catchment area down to this point is , very nearly the whole basin. The yearly mean flow or discharge of the river at Braine is . Seasonal fluctuations in the flow are very small. The high waters of the winter/spring period take the monthly mean to a level of between and , from January to May inclusive (with a maximum in March) and the low waters of late Summer/ early Autumn, August to October inclusive, with a minimum of in September. The difference is nonetheless noticeable. History The N31 road has seen the passage of many kings, emperors and armies over the centuries. The French kings were crowned at Reims and usually returned to Paris this way. The river's upper reaches pass over the chalk plain of Champaigne Once rather disparagingly called Champaigne Pouilleuse, because of its poverty. This region has long been used for military training, its geology and use being similar to those of Salisbury Plain. The training ground nearest to it is at the Camp de Mourmelon. During the Great War of 1914-18, the river's valley was just behind the French-held front but at times, particularly in the spring and summer of 1918, it was heavily fought over. See Second Battle of the Marne. Ecology Two important natural zones of ecological, zoological and botanical interest, (ZNIEFF) have been decreed on the length of the Vesle. The first is upstream from Reims and designated as 'The great fens of the Vesle Valley from Prunay to Courmelois' (Les grands Marais du Val de Vesle de Prunay √† Courmelois). It extends to 400 hectares. The second, which is much more extensive carries the name Vall√©e de la Vesle de Livry-Louvercy √† Courlandon and covers 2,682 ha. extending both above and below Reims. It includes some land in the city itself and covers about 46 km. of the river's length.

In 1957 the group broke up, but Don and Dewey remained together. Later that year they were signed by Art Rupe's Specialty Records label and for the next two years produced rock and roll. Both Don and Dewey played guitar, with Dewey often doubling on keyboards. When not playing guitar or bass, Don occasionally played the electric violin, a skill for which he subsequently became well known under the name of \\"Sugarcane\\" Harris.
