Following the Aufkl√§rung, German Conservatives rejected the newly-emergent habit of constantly questioning the status quo and never finding satisfaction in the present moment. Instead, these conservatives ardently insisted that this new, ‚Äúenlightened‚Äù mode of thought was dominated by perverse skepticism, immorality, and the undermining of authority. By the late nineteenth century, the conservative ideology had fragmented as thinkers began to postulate their own understandings of the world. Some conservatives adopted Romantic views of the world and began to compose their dictums with strong, underlying senses of nostalgia. Nowhere was this sentiment stronger than in the words of German Agrarian Conservatives, who expressed both their bitterness for the present condition of the German state and their yearning for a return to a more organic, pastoral sense of life. With romanticism as its steadying hand, agrarian conservatism evolved from the earlier ‚ÄúReactionary‚Äù line of conservatives. These thinkers made a transition from a rejection of progressivism to a rejection of modernism in its entirety, acknowledging the growth of a proletarian class under Bismarck and the Empire, much to their disdain. Struggling to explain the miseries of capitalism and mechanization, these thinkers engaged their present through a historicist lens, correlating modernization with unhappiness and pastoralism with blissful simplicity. Their views are not conservative in the strict sense, as they seek to actively return the status quo to one of its prior states, rather than simply preserve certain traditional aspects of society. Agrarian elites united under this mantra of changing the status quo and formed the Bund der Landwirte (BdL), seeking to organize and represent what they felt was Germany's heritage and most important economic sector ‚Äì farming. Influential figures in German agrarian conservatism ranged from revolutionary conservatives such as Oswald Spengler to even Junkers like Ewald von Kleist-Schmenzin. In this sense, its connections to farming as an ideology did not necessitate farmers as its constituency. Rather, romantic thinkers and ordinary landowners alike united, lusting for the destruction of the German Republic and wistfully hoping for the establishment of a pre-Enlightenment agrarian society. Hitler and the Third Reich outlawed of all non-Nazi political entities, but ideologues like Friedrich Reck took up the mantle of agrarian conservatism. His Diary of a Man in Despair catalogues the worldview of a ‚Äúlost‚Äùgeneration of thinkers living under the Nazi ideology. Others, like the aforementioned von Kleit-Schmenzin, radicalized even more, going so far as to join the July 20 Plot to kill Adolf Hitler.  Roots of Conservative Thought  Arthur Moeller van den Bruck states in his controversial Germanys Third Empire, ‚ÄúThe Left has reason. The Right has understanding.‚Äù This over-simplification of conservatism underscores the key tenant of thinkers on the Right: understanding. Rather than view the world with an enlightened sense of wonder, conservatives perceived such curiosity as fleeting. They prefer order and hegemony to the uncertainty and skepticism of Enlightenment liberalism. Such thought is best explained by the conservative reaction to the French Revolution of 1789. German conservatives observed the degradation of Libert√©, √âgaliti√©, Fraternit√© into the tyrannical rule of the majority, and the perceived ‚Äúchaos‚Äù of liberalism and Enlightenment morality led them to argue that rationalism led to the erosion of civilization. Unlike their liberal counterparts, conservatives resorted to the status quo ante as justification for their beliefs. In unquestioning idolization of the existing state of affairs, conservatives stress the preservation of order over all else. They fear the unknown ‚Äì violent upheaval, tyranny, and death are often correlated with Enlightenment calls for liberty; the French Revolution of 1789 only further justified this claim. Conservatives find their roots, as a generality, having emerged from Anti-Enlightenment thinkers such as Rousseau and Burke. In recalling Rousseau's ‚Äústand against rationalism on the basis of the ‚Äòreason of feeling‚Äô,‚Äù conservatives rejected the Enlightenments attempts to explain with the explicit intention of perceiving. They suggested that reason and perception ought to exist as one. Simply put, what one sees is what one ought to believe. Again, this sentiment of the ‚Äútangible world‚Äù recalls the aforementioned rejection of Enlightenment thought. Romanticizing the past, conservatives recall Burke's suggestions of organic society and intergenerational responsibility. This nostalgia allows the conservative to justify the past status quo as superior ‚Äì as harbingers of Burke's organicism and intergenerationalism, these thinkers dutifully reject the destabilizing, anti-historicist views of the Enlightenment liberal. Subsequently, the curbing of individual desire and the absence of conflicting interests formed key tenants in its anti-Enlightenment rationale. However, the degree to which these tenants are upheld designates splits among the ideology itself. Three types of conservatives have been identified: the defenders of the status quo, reform conservatives, and reactionary conservatives. The prior two will be simply defined and explained, while reactionary conservatives will be highly discussed, given the close linkage of reactionary conservatism and agrarian conservatism. = Defenders of the Status Quo = Defenders of the status quo are precisely such ‚Äì they are conservative members of society who perceive the present status quo as amicable to their place in society. Generally upper-class, these thinkers are situated in a scenario of little hope. Their ahistorical view of the world distances themselves from the reactionaries and reformers who seek some variation of the past. Rather, these thinkers are trapped in an ever-changing society, whereby they witness the natural progression of society. Their ideal society ‚Äì the present status quo ‚Äì is seemingly displaying the throes of death, progressing aimlessly and with rapidity towards ‚Äúcivilizations end.‚Äù Their fascination with the present predicates a hatred of the future; the future is the coming death-knell to their way of life. As such, progressive sentiment of disenfranchisement oft leads this type of Conservative to convert to a Reactionary. = Reform Conservatism = The reform conservative prefers gradual change ‚Äì a conversion of modernism predicated on the conservation of continuity. Reform conservatism accepts the inevitable progressivism of society, seeking only to preserve and project visions of order and hegemony as espoused by all conservatives. Hence, reformers lay claim to what Burke calls, ‚Äúa tendency to preserve with an inclination to improve.‚Äù They exist as perennial moderates, seeking to adapt their visions of the past status quo to modern needs, so as to espouse their aforementioned edicts ‚Äì hegemony and order.Auerbach stresses the psychology of the Conservative mind ‚Äì preference for the known, fear of the uncertain. Perhaps the clearest exemplars of reform conservatism in Germany are the ‚ÄúBismarckians.‚Äù Upon taking power as a conservative, Bismarck sought to uphold the sanctity of the past status quo. The monarchy was to reign supreme, but the past conception of a monarchical ruler as ‚Äúarbiter above all classes‚Äù was unfavorable to Bismarck. Such a system proved historically inept at handling the working poor, leaving them to fend for themselves. As much of the general populace struggled, so did the legitimacy of the monarch in their eyes. Rather, a welfarist system was established in the German Empire to meet the needs of the populace, whilst to maintain the favorability of the monarchy in the eyes of the populace, as well as its absolute power. = Reactionary Conservatism = Most German to agrarian conservatism is the reactionary conservative ideology. Reactionary conservatives are ‚Äì in a strict sense ‚Äì not conservatives at all; they seek not to modify or preserve the current status quo, but to replace it with an earlier time that history has abandoned. Reactionaries actively intervene in their society to re-establish a prior status quo. Oswald Spengler, Friedrich Reck-Malleczewen, and Ewald von Kleit- Schmenzin are exemplars of this idealism. All three men actively sought the destruction of Hitler's Third Reich, which they saw as a heretical status quo. For Spengler, the revolution was theory. His Decline of the West details a skeptical history of the downfall of man. Reck-Malleczewen met Hitler on various occasions, and his Diary of a Man in Despair constantly recalls the grief Reck felt over having not killed Hitler when he had the opportunity. Von Kleit-Schmenzin was perhaps the most active of these three, involving himself in the July 20 plot, and following through with the plan to assassinate the F√ºhrer and restore order to a Third Reich. All three of these men preached the core conservative tenants, ‚Äì order and harmony through hegemony and tradition ‚Äì and each attempted to subvert their status quo and replace it with the idealized agrarian one, albeit through differing methods. Ironically, revolutionary conservatives stray far from the traditional roots of conservatism, as they, above all others, advocate discord and violence to create a new status quo.  The Agrarian Conservative  Agrarianism is thus a revolutionary conservative dictum. Three of its most notable proponents ‚Äì Spengler, Reck, and von Kleit-Schmenzin ‚Äì were all agrarian thinkers. Their vision for the new status quo is best described as a return to a pastoralist society, whereby men lead simple lives as utopian farmers, sustaining themselves and their culture through simple, ‚ÄúEarthly‚Äù lives. Unlike their Reactionary and Reformist brethren, agrarian revolutionaries seek not only the violent upheaval of the status quo to return to this pastoralism, but they reject nearly all sense of modernism. They seek to dispose of the modern, with the intent of recreating ‚Äì and living solely in ‚Äì the past. Reck himself exemplifies this mindset in Diary of a Man in Despair. Throughout the novel, Reck explains his great distaste for ‚ÄúBismarckian modernization‚Äù of the state, as well as ‚ÄúNazist industrialization‚Äù of the state. Reck's constant referral to ‚Äúsuperfluous bureaucrats‚Äù and the inefficiencies of the state reflect this pastoral vision, after all, a pastoral society lacks a state. Just as Marx describes utopian Communism, Reck and Spengler picture a utopian Agrarianism, whereby the main emphasis of society is not, as Marx would have, the means of production, but the men of the land. All culture, high society, and civilization branch from these thinkers‚Äô idealized pastoral state ‚Äì the ancien regime perhaps best represents this idea. A strong monarchy with a limited bureaucracy would represent the government and manage the state, whilst the people would exist in romanticized farming villages ‚Äì their culture, livelihood, and civilization emerge from their profession and organic connection with the land itself.  Agrarianism Under Bismarck and Before the Weimar Republic  Under the rule of Otto von Bismarck ‚Äì both as Chancellor of Germany and Foreign Minister of Prussia ‚Äì German conservatives were not necessarily at the apex of their power. They therefore gradually assumed governmental control of Prussia, the then dominant German state and, by 1863, they had collectively transformed the newspaper into a political tool. By 1864, Bismarck had effectively installed a wholly conservative government ‚Äì Realpolitik, monarchical solidarity, and the support for a modernized yet traditional status quo weakened the liberal parties and strengthened a Bismarckian foothold on Prussia. Such a grasp on the political climate of Prussia translated proportionately to the political climate of a unified Germany, especially when it is considered that Bismarck was installed as the German Chancellor. The conservatives became the de facto and de jure representatives of the Junker class in government. = Agrarians as anti- Bismarck = Agrarian conservatives under Bismarck took issue with the Prussian ‚Äì and later, German ‚Äì status quo. In the 1830s, Prussia was an industrious state, seeking to emulate the developmental patterns of England and avoid the vast problems they perceived within British society. Their problem was, in their words, ‚Äúmodern feudalism,‚Äù ‚Äì the Berliner Politisches Wochenblatt, a weekly publication, denounced the supposed resurrection of the old aristocracy under false pretenses. Agrarianists proposed that the only acceptable status quo was the ancien regime, where gold still retained its power over iron. Industrialized Prussia and, later, a modernized Germany were key issues of these dissenters. Yet, there were members of the conservatives, such as Viktor Aim√© Huber, who saw such luddism as an oddity. Huber was a member of the Junkers out of birth, but not due to ancient heritage. His parents were massive literary successes, leading him to be born of the nouveau riche. The Bund der Landwirte emerged in 1893, but had pundits espousing its views since the 1870s, when the commercial crisis had occurred. An 1879 grain tariff ‚Äì imbued in protectionism and emanating from agrarian conservative politics, especially protectionism ‚Äì marks a tangible production via the organization of agrarianists. The Great Crash of 1873, a massive economic downturn, led to a large shift in votes toward the conservatives. Conservatives gained 37 seats in the Reichstag by 1879, and in the 1884 election, while Germany was still dealing with economic instability, conservatives won another 19 seats in the Reichstag. Agrarian workers ‚Äì farmers and landowning Junkers ‚Äì who felt disenfranchised by this decline turned to the doctrine of agrarian conservatism. Recalling the prosperous past, they sought to turn Germany inward. As pastoral societies are by definition relatively self-centered, the agrarian conservatives rallied around protectionism and a sense of ‚Äúbiologically oriented v√∂lkisch nationalism.‚Äù Notably, the BdL's influence on German politics continued throughout the Second World War. However, the organization ceased to exist as a formality, having been reorganized as the Reichsn√§hrstand by the Nazis in 1933.  Agrarian Conservatism Under the Third Reich  Early associations between Nazism and conservatism were amicable ‚Äì agricultural and military opposition to the German Revolution of 1918-1919 suggest sympathy for National Socialism. Furthermore, the assistance of Franz von Papen and Alfred Hugenberg irrefutably connects the legacies of conservatism and National Socialism. However, the alienating ‚ÄúNew Order‚Äù of Hitler's Third Reich suggests that relations between conservatives and National Socialists were not perfect. Though similarly ‚Äútraditionalist‚Äù in their yearn to recapture a past German status quo, the Nazi Party and conservatives sought different futures. The Nazi future, led by high technology and scientific development, conflicted directly with the conservative future, led by some rendition of the ancien regime, and varying degrees of tradition (depending on the type of conservative concerned). The imperative obtainment of rural votes established Nazi predominance in German politics, yet reasons for the abandoning of traditional conservatism in favor of National Socialism are, at best, speculations. Regardless, Nazi efforts to modernize agriculture resulted in the increase of farmers‚Äô income, as well as crop production. Holmes identifies a key difference in the Nazi and conservative ideologies that rendered them inevitably incompatible: > Unlike the Junker who strove to remake the world over only once, to restore > some mythological vision of the past with modern methods of political > persuasion, Hitler wanted to remake the world over and over again, that is, > to make revolution. Indeed, Hitler betrayed conservatism, fermenting a policy of Gleichschaltung ‚Äì the Nazification of Germany, without exception. This understanding prohibited the existence of non-Nazi political parties, as proclaimed formally in the Law Against the Founding of New Parties, legalized 14 July 1933, monopolized the rule of the Nazi regime. = Agrarians after the Prohibition = Friederich Reck-Malleczewen's classification of himself as a ‚ÄúMan in Despair,‚Äù describes the general sentiment of agrarian conservatives following the institution of Gleichschaltung. No longer were the Junkers, agrarian leaders, or farmworkers themselves the domineering class of a ruling political party. Shunned to the sidelines, these men persisted in spite of their views. Reck-Malleczewen's characterizations of grief and general disgust at the ‚ÄúNew Germany‚Äù proclaimed by the Nazis represents the sentiment of but one man of many. However, his view is not unique ‚Äì Oswald Spengler noted that he and his brethren were the ‚Äúlast men‚Äù in a declining Western civilization. This notion of being the last vanguard between the destruction of the West and the rise of uncivilized, uncultured man permeates not only Reck's compositions and Spengler's writings, but also the life of Junker Ewald von Kleist-Schmenzin. Von Kleist-Schmenzin, as a member of the aristocracy, took issue with the rule of Hitler. Detesting the industrious, modern Germany which had abandoned rural influence and culture, von Kleist-Schmenzin participated in the July 20 Plot. This plan was a failed putsch, whereby Hitler was to be assassinated and replaced. Revolutionary by design, this plan confirms the association of agrarian conservatism with revolutionary conservatism. Undoubtedly, these ‚ÄúMen in Despair‚Äù lived in anguish. Reck-Malleczewen's account of life under Nazism confirms this, as do the actions of von Kleist-Schmenzin and the other agrarian conservatives of the July 20 Plot. Nazism existed as a form of totalitarianism, whereby the citizenry is fashioned by the doctrine of absolutist rulers. In this specific instance, Hitler and the Nazi Party created the dictums of the state.Bruck's composition predates the Nazi Party rule, but nonetheless emanates what would then become the core tenants and understandings of the Nazis‚Äô weltanschauung. As strict believers in the old status quo, and as revolutionaries who seek to re-establish a society from the past, the new, unproven, and alien Nazi Third Reich contradicted with their pastoralist views. Its rejection of an agricultural, ‚ÄúEarthly‚Äù society in favor of an industrious, modernized Germany defied their very visions. Nazi Germany was devoid of their organic and intergenerational life ‚Äì it professed its love for a radically modern, mechanically ‚Äúcold‚Äù Germany. Detested by the society they inhabited and rejected by their moderate peers, German agrarian conservatives were alienated by their own country. Germany chose the path of National Socialism with Hitler's rise to Chancellor in 1933, preventing an organic society from ever emerging. Hitler's illegalization of conservatism as a whole further estranged these thinkers. The roots of the German agrarian conservative ideology ‚Äì dissatisfaction with the status quo of an industrializing 1830s Prussia ‚Äì established their sentiment of disenfranchisement. When the Nazis eliminated conservatism as a whole, this notion of marginalization only grew stronger and deeper. By the end of World War II and the fall of the Third Reich, agrarian conservatism would fade just as it began ‚Äì a clinging reminder of a long-forgotten past.

Anglesea was ordered to join other warships in the English Channel and patrol for French shipping. On the afternoon of 29 March a large sail was spotted windward (upwind) of Anglesea, with the unknown vessel heading in the direction of the British warship. Captain Elton believed the ship to be the 60 gun HMS Augusta, and took no action in response to the sail. The vessel was in fact the French 50 gun ship of the line Apollon, which had detected Anglesea and made ready for an engagement. When it was discovered that the approaching ship flew French colors, Captain Elton ordered Angleseas mainsail raised in preparation for a flight. The effect of this action was to blow the ship to one side and flood the lower gun decks of the vessel. Apollon laid down a withering fire onto Anglesea, with the first broadside killing both Captain Elton and the ship's master, leaving Second Lieutenant Baker Phillips in command. Apollon's position granted it the advantage in maneuverability, and soon the British warship was crippled by repeated broadsides. Several more minutes saw Anglesea lose 60 men killed or wounded by French fire. Seeing no other option, Phillips surrendered the vessel, an action for which he would later be executed. Following her capture, the vessel was commissioned into the French Navy as LAnglesea. She remained in French service for eight years, and was decommissioned in 1753.

Six thousand Mogilev Jews were murdered by SS forces and Police Regiment Centre's Police Battalions 316 and 322 in October 1941. The Police Regiment Centre (Polizei-Regiment Mitte) was a formation of the Order Police (uniformed police) during the Nazi era. During Operation Barbarossa, it was subordinated to the Schutzstaffel (SS) and deployed in German-occupied areas, specifically the Army Group Centre Rear Area, of the Soviet Union. In mid-1942, its three constituent battalions were reassigned and the unit was re-designated as the 13th Police Regiment. Alongside detachments from the Einsatzgruppen and the SS Cavalry Brigade, it perpetrated mass murders and was responsible for large- scale crimes against humanity targeting civilian populations in the course of the Nazi security warfare. The scope of the regiment's operations was known to British intelligence since July 1941 but, for reasons of national security, information pertaining to their activities was not released until 1993. Background and formation The German Order Police (uniformed police) was a key instrument of the security apparatus of Nazi Germany. In the prewar period, Heinrich Himmler, the head of the SS, and Kurt Daluege, chief of the Order Police, cooperated in transforming the police force of the Weimar Republic into militarised formations ready to serve the regime's aims of conquest and racial annihilation. The police units participated in the annexation of Austria and the occupation of Czechoslovakia. Police troops were first formed into battalion-sized formations for the invasion of Poland, where they were deployed for security and policing purposes, also taking part in executions and mass deportations. Twenty-three Order Police battalions were slated to take part in the 1941 invasion of the Soviet Union, Operation Barbarossa. Nine were attached to security divisions of the Wehrmacht, three for each Army Group Rear Areas. Two battalions were assigned to support the Einsatzgruppen, the mobile death squads of the SS, and the Organisation Todt, the military construction group. Twelve were formed into regiments, three battalions each, and designated as Police Regiments Centre, North, South, and Special Purpose. Police units assigned to the Wehrmacht security divisions and the Einsatzgruppen were motorised, while those formed into regiments were not. The goals of the Order Police battalions were to secure the rear by eliminating the remnants of the enemy forces, guarding the prisoners of war, and protecting the lines of communications and captured industrial facilities. Their instructions also included, as Daluege stated, the \\"combat of criminal elements, above all political elements\\". Police Regiment Centre was formed in June 1941 by combining Police Battalions 307, 316, and 322, each comprising about 550 men. These battalions were raised from recruits mobilised from the 1905‚Äì1915 year groups. They were led by career police professionals, steeped in the ideology of Nazism, driven anti-semitism and anti-Bolshevism. The unit was placed under the command of , a career policeman. When it crossed the German-Soviet border, the regiment came under the control of Erich von dem Bach-Zelewski, the Higher SS and Police Leader (HSS-PF) for Army Group Centre. Operational history =Early killing operations= Himmler made a personal visit to the headquarters of the unit in Belostok on 8 July where he met with Max von Schenckendorff, commander of Army Group Centre Rear Area, Daluege, Montua, Bach-Zalewski, and the regiment's officers. He expressed concern that too few Jews had been rounded up and called on the officers to increase their efforts. It was likely that Himmler had ordered increased killings since several massacres followed immediately after. The same evening, a company of Police Battalion 322 participated in the shooting of about 1,000 Jews under the direction of Einsatzgruppe B. The next day, on July 9, Police Battalion 307 participated in the massacre of 4‚Äì6,000 Jewish men, Russians and Belarussians in the vicinity of Brest-Litovsk (now Brest, Belarus). The killing operation, with assistance by personnel of the Wehrmacht's 162nd Infantry Division, lasted several days. On 10 July, Daluege addressed the members of the regiment arrayed in a parade formation, extolling them to \\"exterminate\\" Bolshevism as a \\"blessing for Germany\\". On 11 July, Montua passed a confidential order from Bach-Zalewski to the battalion commanders that Jews, who had been \\"convicted of looting\\", were to be shot; an execution took place the same day. Around this time, Police Battalions 316 and 322 rounded up approximately 3,000 Jewish men from Belostok and shot them in a nearby forest. On 17 July, the regiment murdered over 1,100 Jews in Slonim, with Bach-Zalewski reporting to Himmler on 18 July: \\"Yesterday's cleansing action in Slonim by Police Regiment Centre. 1,153 Jewish plunderers were shot\\". By 20 July, the unit's reports referred to executions of Jewish women and children. By late August, Police Battalion 322 moved to Minsk, where, on September 1, it conducted a killing operation together with the units of Einsatzgruppe B. The victims included 290 Jewish men and 40 Jewish women. =Escalation of violence= Victims hanged by the police troops in the Soviet Union, August/September 1941 In September 1941, the regiment participated in the Mogilev conference, organised by General Max von Schenckendorff, commander of the Army Group Centre Rear Area. Montua had been in charge of the event's planning and logistics. The conference included three field exercises. On the second day, participants travelled to a nearby settlement where a company of Police Battalion 322, assisted by the troops of the SD, conducted a demonstration of how to surround and screen a village. According to the after- action report, \\"suspicious strangers\\" (Ortsfremde) or \\"partisans\\" could not be found. The screening of the population revealed fifty-one Jewish civilians, of whom thirty-two were shot. On 2 October 1941, Police Battalions 322 and 316, along with Bach-Zalewski's staff company and Ukrainian auxiliaries, rounded up 2,200 Jews in the Mogilev Ghetto. Sixty-five were killed during the roundups, and another 550 executed the next day. Throughout the rest of the month, the battalion continued to execute Jews, communists, and alleged partisans in the vicinity of Mogilev. The commander of the unit received the Iron Cross, 2nd class, following these operations. Another killing operation later that month, by Einsatzkommando 8 and Police Battalions 316 and 322, brought the total number of victims in Mogilev to about 6,000. On November 7‚Äì8, Police Battalion 316 participated in the murder of Jews in Bobruisk. The inmates of the Bobruisk ghetto were rounded up and loaded into trucks. They were taken to the village of Kamenka where they were shot into pits dug for this purpose. About 5,281 people were killed by the personnel of the battalion and the Einsatzkommando 8. =Later history= In December, after the German defeat in the Battle of Moscow, the regiment was sent to the front lines to reinforce the German defenses, thus depriving Bach-Zalewski of manpower. Police Battalion 307, for example, was deployed near Kaluga on 20 December and had been reduced to a combat strength of 60 men by March. The other two battalions were assigned to guard and security duties to the immediate rear of the front- line troops and were not heavily involved in combat. The regimental commander, Montua, was recalled to Germany to assume an SS and police training position and was replaced by Colonel of Police (Oberst der Polizei) Walter Schimana on 1 December. Bach-Zalewski himself was temporarily relieved of command and sent to Germany for recuperation. Around May‚ÄìJune 1942, the battalions were replaced by Police Battalions 6, 85 and 301, which were redesignated as the regiment's first through third battalions, respectively. The regiment was redesignated in July as the 13th Police Regiment. Decrypts by British intelligence Progress reports on the murderous activities of the Police Regiment Center, the Einsatzgruppen detachment and the SS Cavalry Brigade were regularly forwarded by Bach-Zalewski. However, unbeknownst to him, the reports were being intercepted by MI6, the British intelligence service, whose code breakers at Bletchley Park had broken the German ciphers as part of Ultra, the British signals intelligence program. The head of MI6, Stewart Menzies, communicated the decrypts directly to British Prime Minister Winston Churchill. The first decrypted message was the 18 July report on the mass murders by the regiment at Slonim. In late July and early August, similar reports were intercepted on a regular basis. Angered by the scope of the atrocities, Churchill delivered a speech over the radio on 24 August stating: > Whole districts are being exterminated (...) Scores of thousands of > executions are perpetrated by the German police troops upon the Soviet > patriots defending their native soil. Since the Mongol invasion of Europe, > there have never been methodical, merciless butchery on such a scale or > approaching such a scale. We are in the presence of a crime without a name. From 27 August, Bletchley Park delivered specially prepared daily intelligence reports on the activities of the police troops. By this point, the British intelligence had detailed information on the activities of both Bach- Zalewski's and Friedrich Jeckeln's formations (with Jeckeln operating in Army Group South Rear Area). On 12 September, the German Police changed their cipher; the following day, the SS officials were instructed to stop transmitting the reports over the radio. Subsequently, the code breakers produced monthly reports detailing the crimes perpetrated by Nazi Germany. Aftermath Police Battalions 307, 316, and 322 were reassigned to other regiments and continued to engage in security warfare (Bandenbek√§mpfung, or \\"bandit-fighting\\") and genocide. Battalion 307 was assigned to the 23rd Police Regiment and took part in the punitive in Belarus. Battalions 316 and 322 were sent to Slovenia, with Battalion 316 then assigned to the 4th Police Regiment in France and Battalion 322 joining the 5th Police Regiment, still in Slovenia. The regiment's former commander, Montua, committed suicide in April 1945. The Order Police as a whole had not been declared a criminal organisation by the Allies, unlike the SS, and its members were able to reintegrate into the German society largely unmolested, with many returning to police careers in Austria and West Germany. Personnel of Police Battalion 322 were investigated by the West German authorities in the 1960s. One of the battalion's members stated: > The expression 'combat of the partisans' is strictly speaking a complete > misnomer. We did not have a single battle with partisans after we left > Mogilev. ... The fact of the matter [was] that those found without identity > cards sufficed for their arrest and executions\\". For reasons of national security, the Ultra program remained classified after the war and the decrypts pertaining to the activities of security and police troops during the war were not shared with Britain's allies. Consequently, they were not used during the Nuremberg trials or subsequent investigations of German war crimes and crimes against humanity. The decrypts were finally released in 1993.

He was the Consul General of the Ottoman Empire in Bordeaux, Brussels, Paris and Buenos Aires. He authored books and articles in Arabic, Spanish and French. He initially supported the ideas of the Young Turks, who favoured a reform so as to restore the Ottoman constitution of 1876 and the parliament and grant rights to all the individuals and nations of the Empire. In 1914, while at office as Ottoman Consul General in Buenos Aires, he broke with the Young Turks government due to its alliance with the German Empire and its entrance in World War I, which Arslan harshly criticized. He denounced the extermination of Armenians from the review he founded and edited, La Nota, in August 1915. During his stay in Europe he had also condemned the Hamidian massacres from the French press. After the war Arslan initially supported a provisional Mandate for Syria and the Lebanon. As the Mandate prolonged he denounced it as a corrupt and despotic colonization and adhered to the idea of the independence of former Ottoman Syria as a single sovereign state. Early years and family Signature of Emin Arslan in Arabic script. Emin Arslan was born in Choueifat, Mount Lebanon Mutasarrifate, Ottoman Empire. He belonged to a distinguished Druze family whose members hold traditionally the title of Emirs until today. Emin was son of Zahiyya ShihƒÅb and Maƒüƒ´d ArslƒÅn, son of Mil·∏•am, son of ·∏§aidar, son of 'AbbƒÅs, son of Fakhreddƒ´n. He had three brothers: Nouhad, Fouad, Sa'ƒ´d and Tawfƒ´q (also transliterated as Toufic). The latter helped found Greater Lebanon in 1920 and fathered Maƒüƒ´d ArslƒÅn II (1908‚Äì1983), a Lebanon's independence hero, member of the Lebanese Parliament and government minister. Current traditional chief of the ArslƒÅn family, Talal Arslan, is therefore a great niece of Emin Arslan. Emin did not marry and had no children; he was succeeded by his nieces Rafƒ´q Sa'ƒ´d ArslƒÅn, Malik Sa'ƒ´d ArslƒÅn, Zahiyya Tawfƒ´q ArslƒÅn, Majƒ´d Tawfƒ´q ArslƒÅn (i.e. Maƒüƒ´d ArslƒÅn II) and NuhƒÅd Tawfƒ´q ArslƒÅn. Political career in Mount Lebanon Tripoli, Beirut and Arslan's birthplace, Choueifat. In 1892 he was designated mudƒ´r ('director') of the Far West Directorate (NƒÅ·∏•yat al-ƒ†arb al- Aq·π£ƒÅ), in the Mount Lebanon Mutasarrifate. He resigned in 1893 after a conflict with the muta·π£arrif Na'≈´m PƒÅ≈°ƒÅ (Naum Pasha). Arslan joined the Freemasonry on 24 August 1889. Exile in France In 1893, he resigned as mudƒ´r and joined his friend Salim Sarkis in exile. They stopped briefly in Egypt and then went to Paris where, along with other Arab expatriates founded the \\"Turkish Syrian Committee.\\" They contacted Ahmed Rƒ±za, a major supporter of the Young Turks movement and editor of Me≈üveret, a Turkish written political newspaper. The main activity of the exiles was to spread criticism against the Ottoman regime through the general European press and from some party organs. They demanded restoration of the 1876 Ottoman constitution, reestablishment of the parliament and equal rights for individuals and communities. = \\"Kashf an-NiqƒÅb\\" newspaper = Kashf an-NiqƒÅb (ŸÉÿ¥ŸÅ ÿßŸÑŸÜŸÇÿßÿ®), i.e. \\"unveiling\\", was an Arabic written newspaper edited in Paris by Emin Arslan and his friend, writer and journalist Salim Sarkis, from 9 August 1894 until 25 July 1895. According to Sarkis, the Ottoman embassy pressured the French authorities into censoring the magazine and order the concierge to disclose names of visitors. =\\"TurkiyƒÅ al-FatƒÅt\\" newspaper= \\"TurkiyƒÅ al- FatƒÅt (ÿ™ÿ±ŸÉŸäÿß ÿßŸÑŸÅÿ™ÿßÿ©) ‚Äì La Jeune Turquie\\", i.e. \\"Young Turkey\\", was a bilingual biweekly edited in Paris in Arabic and French from December 1895 through middle 1897 by Emin Arslan and ·∏™alƒ´l ƒ†ƒÅnim (ÿÆŸÑŸäŸÑ ÿ∫ÿßŸÜŸÖ) on behalf of the \\"Turkish Syrian Committee,\\" self described as \\"journal of political propaganda.\\" It criticized sultan Abdul Hamid II's government. Co-editor Khalil Ghanem (Beirut 1847 ‚Äì Paris 1903) had taken part in the previous reformist movement known as the Young Ottomans. Member of the first Ottoman parliament in 1877, the French Embassy in Constantinople (now Istanbul) granted him political asylum after his mentor Midhat Pasha was deposed. Before meeting Arslan he had founded and edited al-Bassir (al-Ba»ôƒ´r ÿßŸÑÿ®ÿµŸäÿ±) weekly (Paris, 1881‚Äì1882). Ghanem wrote also for the Journal des d√©bats and was named chevalier of the French Legion of Honour in 1879. =In Paris press= In 1896 Arslan wrote four articles that were published on La Revue Blanche, titled \\"Les Affaires de Cr√®te\\", \\"Les Affaires d'Orient\\", \\"Les Troubles de Syrie\\" and \\"Les Arm√©nians √† Constantinople\\". The latter was about the Occupation of the Ottoman Bank by Armenian militants and denounced the subsequent brutal retaliation. At those times Arslan frequented French writer Jules Claretie and they assisted together at the fourth International Press Congress in Stockholm in 1897. =\\"Truce\\" with the Sultan's envoy= The Ottoman leadership tried to neutralize the exiles' propaganda in Europe. Despite not being too numerous, the exiles managed to get attention in the press. As one of them wrote: \\"(...) [the sultan] knows that if we are allowed a free hand in Paris our members and papers can do him more harm than ten French men-of-war.\\" On 29 January 1897, one of their communiques was published by the Official Bulletin of the Kingdom of Italy. It was addressed to \\"the six powers signatories of the Treatises of Paris and Berlin\\" and it was signed by \\"MurƒÅd Bey, general deputy of the Young Turkey; ·∏™alƒ´l ƒ†ƒÅnim, former representative of Syria before the Turkish parliament; Ahmed Rƒ±za Bey; the Emir Emin Arslan; H. Anthony Salmon√©\\", et al., on behalf of the \\"party of the general reformation in Turkey.\\" The Ottoman government sent to Paris Ahmed Cem√¢ludd√Æn with the mission of contacting the opposition and offer a general pardon for political prisoners, restoring the exiles in their former positions and reestablishing the constitution, in exchange for ending their propaganda campaign. Arslan states in his memories that initially he rejected the agreement despite having direct relatives who would be released with the amnesty. Then he proposed suspending the agreement until the Ottoman government showed progress in abiding by it, which was rejected by Cem√¢ludd√Æn. He finally agreed and was designated Consul General in Bordeaux. The sultan fulfilled his promises except for restoring the constitution and reopening the parliament, which would only happen in 1908 with the Young Turks Revolution.  Consul General in Brussels  Since the 1897 \\"truce\\" Emin Arslan was designated Consul General of the Ottoman Empire in Bordeaux and almost immediately transferred to Brussels, where he stayed at office until 1908. In Belgium Arslan befriended Roland de Mar√®s (1874‚Äì1955), director of L'ind√©pendance belge newspaper, and jurist Ernest Nys. Despite joining the Ottoman consular service Arslan kept publishing articles, sometime with heavy criticism against the government. As a 1900 article in The Nation quoted: > A new advocate for reform in Turkey has risen in Emin Arslan Effendi, the > Consul General in Brussels. Last year he sent to Abdul Hamid a detailed > report of the sufferings of the peasants in certain of the richest provinces > in the empire. He pointed out that, unable to bear the heavy burden of > taxation and the arbitrary methods of the farmers of revenue, they were > cutting down their trees, tearing up their vines, leaving their lands > uncultivated, and even emigrating in vast numbers beyond the seas. America > alone, be said, contained more than 100,000 Syrian emigrants, a third of > whom were Mohammedans. \\"Never in the history of Islam has such a thing > occurred.\\" In this year‚Äôs report he dwells upon the great numbers of high > officials and their enormous salaries. There are in the army, for instance, > forty-four marshals, and forty-six viziers with the rank of marshal, and > there are eighty members of the Council of State‚Äîas many as in France and > Germany put together. Mukhtar Pasha's salary is four times as large as Lord > Cromer's, and the Grand Vizier receives twice as much as Lord Salisbury. But > \\"as the majority of these high officials receive from the Treasury double > and sometimes treble their salaries, the financial embarrassment of the > empire is but natural.\\" A novel that Arslan wrote in Spanish years after, \\"End of a romance\\" (\\"Final de un idilio\\") is staged in Brussels short before WWI. Its main characters are Van Doren, an army officer and aristocrat, and Riette, a French Alsacian girl. It was first edited in Buenos Aires in 1917. Travel to Constantinople and the Young Turks Revolution Postal card praising the restoration of the constitution, 24 July 1908, written in Greek and Ottoman Turkish, depicting \\"Enver Bey\\" (then known as Enver Pasha). Arslan resigned as Ottoman Consul General in Brussels in 1908 and travelled to Constantinople. A month before, the Young Turks Revolution had taken over the power although without deposing Sultan Abdul Hamid II. During the Ottoman countercoup of 1909, a first cousin of Arslan's, Latakia's representative to the Congress Mu·∏•ammad Mu·π£·π≠afƒÅ ArslƒÅn, was shot and killed close to the Parliament. Emin Arslan had to take care of his remnants and arrange their transport to Beyrouth. The French newspaper Gil Blas published on 15 April 1909, that \\"the Emir Arslan, representative for Latakia\\" had been killed. Some European friends of Emin Arslan thought he was the victim. Consul General in Paris Emin Arslan was designated Consul General in Paris in 1909. Paris' Le Temps informed in September 1909, that \\"the Turkish government resolved to upgrade its Paris consulate to a general consulate\\" and that Emir Emin Arslan, former Consul General in Brussels, had been designated as Consul General in Paris. In his biographic writings Arslan states that he looked for an alternative destination, without elaborating on the reasons. By then, ambassador to France was Na'≈´m PƒÅ≈°ƒÅ, former muta·π£arrif of Mount Lebanon during Arslan's tenure as mudƒ´r in 1893. Apparently Arslan did not have good relations with Na'≈´m; 17 years before, a conflict with him had caused his resignation as mudƒ´r and his exile. Once Arslan found out about the newly established consular relations between the Ottoman Empire and the Argentine Republic, he asked to be transferred to Buenos Aires. In Buenos Aires Sample of the three languages Arslan wrote and published in. Top: French (La Revue Blanche, 1896). Left bottom: Arabic (introduction to his treatise on International Law). Right bottom: Spanish (an article in La Nota, Buenos Aires, 1916). He left no writings in Turkish. =Consul General of the Ottoman Empire= On 11 June 1910, the Ottoman Empire and the Argentine Republic signed an agreement on consular relations and exchanged consuls before the treatise was approved by both the parliaments (the Argentine congress sanctioned law 8184 approving the treatise only on 2 September 1911). Emir Emin Arslan was to be the first and only consul of the Ottoman Empire in Argentina, because in 1914 the Porte removed Arslan and the German Consulate assumed the representation of Ottoman interests in Argentina. Arslan arrived in Buenos Aires on 29 October 1910, on board of the steamboat Chili, belonging to French firm Messageries Maritimes, \\"to an exuberant welcome by a crowd of 4000 Ottoman subjects.\\" Before arriving in Buenos Aires, the 'Chili' made a stop at Rio de Janeiro, where Argentine newspapers of the last weeks were available. Other passengers informed Arslan that during a debate in the Argentine Senate, Senator Manuel L√°inez had criticized the Syro-Ottoman immigration deeming it \\"not useful\\" because it was purportedly composed of peddlers rather than agricultural workers. Ottoman immigration had been defended by La Rioja Senator Joaqu√≠n V. Gonz√°lez. The Senate session was on 12 September 1910, few days before Arslan's arrival to Buenos Aires, on 29 October 1910. Since Arslan was aware of that kind of criticism, right from his first press interviews he announced that he was going to favor the dedication of his fellows to agriculture. Short after his arrival he visited Senator Gonz√°lez to thank him for his defense of the Syro-Ottoman community. Since they were both fluent in French they could communicate without a translator. They became close friends until Gonz√°lez's demise in December 1923. Although Arslan had arrived in Argentina without any knowledge of Spanish, short after his arrival he published his first articles in Spanish at Caras y Caretas magazine and started writing a novel: \\"End of a romance\\" (\\"Final de un idilio\\"). In the long \\"dedication to general Roca\\" that opens the novel, Arslan states that he wrote part of the book in \\"La Larga\\" Roca's ranch, (Estancia La Larga). The former president died in 1914 before a scheduled second visit of Arslan's to La Larga. The novel's first edition was published in 1917. While at office as Consul General in Buenos Aires, Arslan wrote for the Revista Argentina de Ciencias Pol√≠ticas (Argentine Review of Political Science), directed by Rodolfo Rivarola, the following articles: \\"La joven Turqu√≠a y Europa\\" (Young Turkey and Europe, t. II, pp. 200‚Äì215, 1911), \\"La Tripolitania\\" (The Tripolitania, t. III, pp. 177‚Äì87, 379‚Äì90, 1911) and \\"Historia diplom√°tica de la Europa Balc√°nica\\" (Diplomatic History of Balcanic Europe, t. VI, pp. 635‚Äì66, 1913). Arslan by Zavattaro (Mario Zavattaro, 1876‚Äì1932), at Caras y Caretas, 12 November 1910, p. 68 =Resignation as Consul General in Buenos Aires and death sentence in absentia= Arslan opposed the entry of the Ottoman Empire in World War I and his relation with the Ottoman Foreign Ministry was damaged. He resigned in late 1914. The Ottoman Empire then entrusted its consular relations with Argentina to the German Consul General in Buenos Aires, Rodolfo Bobrik, who demanded Arslan to surrender the consulate and its documentation. Arslan replied that he had not received an official communication from Constantinople ordering him to hand down consular documentation to a foreign official. The German Consul General filed a case before Argentine's Supreme Court. The Court upheld the claim.El asunto del consulado otomano ante la Suprema Corte. La demanda del c√≥nsul alem√°n.

In an article published in June 1916 on La Nota magazine, Arslan wrote about the death sentence in absentia passed against him after he was declared \\"firƒÅrƒ´\\", i.e. fugitive. The review's staff organized a banquet in his honor at a restaurant called \\"Ferrari\\" after his owner's surname, and published the news under the title \\"A death sentence celebrated with a banquet.\\" La Nota, Buenos Aires, 10 June 1916, \\"Reflexiones de un condenado a muerte\\", n¬∫ 44, pp. 862‚Äì863 y \\"Una condena festejada con un banquete\\". =Creation and direction of La Nota magazine= Le Monnier designed La Chaumi√®re, Arslan's chalet in Punta del Este, in 1920 Arslan founded and directed weekly La Nota, whose first issue was published on 14 August 1915. During 1916 Carlos Alberto Leumann was its editor-in-chief. A total of 312 issues were edited until discontinuation in 1921. La Nota was one of the main Argentine literary magazines of its time and among its contributors were Emilio Becher, Arturo Cancela, Juan Pablo Echag√ºe, Mart√≠n Gil, Jos√© Ingenieros, Leopoldo Lugones, Ricardo Rojas, Jos√© Enrique Rod√≥, Eduardo Talero, Manuel Ugarte, Joaqu√≠n de Vedia, Joaqu√≠n V. Gonz√°lez, Alfredo L. Palacios, Franciso Grandmontagne, V√≠ctor P√©rez Petit, Charles de Soussens, Arturo Marasso, Carlos Ibarguren, Baldomero Fern√°ndez Moreno, Carlos Alberto Leumann, Ataliva Herrera, Julio V.

Barroetave√±a, Juan Zorrilla de San Mart√≠n, Amado Nervo and Rub√©n Dar√≠o. La Nota had a strongly anti-German posture during World War I. For instance, poem \\"Ap√≥strofe\\", by Almafuerte, a diatribe against German emperor William II, appeared twice: 15 January and 5 February 1916. Alfonsina Storni published some of her first works on La Nota during 1916. She was a permanent contributor from 28 March until 21 November 1919. Her poems ‚ÄúConvalecer‚Äù and ‚ÄúGolondrinas‚Äù were published in the magazine. Miguel de Unamuno wrote in a letter to Pedro Jim√©nez Ilundain on 20 February 1916: \\"I read quite a lot and write a bit, almost always about the war, especially for Argentina, for La Naci√≥n and La Nota (do you know this weekly?).\\" He considered La Nota \\"quite an interesting and frankly germanophobe magazine.\\" During 1916 Pablo Rojas Paz headed the literary criticism section of the magazine. = Argentine citizenship = The Syrian Revolution against the French Mandate (Buenos Aires, 1926). In 1921, during the disintegration of the Ottoman Empire, Arslan acquired the Argentine citizenship and made public his reasons: : (...) I had already taken the resolution of quitting politics and establishing in Argentina seven years ago. The reason is quite simple and I expressed it to the Grand Visir in my aforementioned memorandum: either if Germany triumphed or was defeated we would be defeated. Because our victory would turn us into their subalterns and their defeat would allow the dismantlement of our unity and turn our country into a group of colonies. And I, rather than being the subject of a colony, preferred to be a citizen in a respected State, particularly if it had such an illustrious status as the Argentine State. =Creation and direction of El L√°piz Azul magazine= Emir Emin Arslan's tumb at La Chacarita cemetery. In 1925 Arslan founded the \\"humoristic, political and literary weekly \\"El L√°piz Azul\\" (i.e. \\"The Blue Pencil\\"). Editor-in-chief was Celso T√≠ndaro (born Pedro B. Franco, 1894‚Äì1947). 47 issues were published from May 1925 to May 1926, including texts from Leopoldo Lugones, Alberto Williams, Eugenio d'Ors and Eduardo Acevedo D√≠az. =Creation and direction of Al-Istiklal= In June 1926, Arslan founded Al- Istiklal (ÿßŸÑÿ•ÿ≥ÿ™ŸÇŸÑÿßŸÑ), The Independence. The magazine was in Arabic but part of its commercial ads were in Spanish. It came into being as a political and intellectual response to the upheaval caused by the Great Syrian Revolt, and was one of the main Arabic anti-French organs from Argentina/Brazil. Moreover, it represented a particular strand within local pan-Arab/nationalist anti- colonial thought and activism. Arslan kept editing this newspaper until his demise in January 1943. = Creation of the Druze Benefit Society = In 1926 Arslan founded the Druze Benefit Society, currently known as Druze Benefit Association (Asociaci√≥n de Beneficencia Drusa) and located in Buenos Aires.

It consists of an Introduction, three Nights, and a Conclusion, totalling over five thousand lines, and there are also authorial notes. The poem presents the contributions, in various metres, of a series of Scottish bards to a competition organised by Mary, Queen of Scots on her arrival in Scotland from France in 1561. Background In his 'Memoir of the Author's Life', revised in 1832, Hogg maintained that he was encouraged by his friend John Grieve to build on his earlier poetic achievements as he sought to begin a literary career in Edinburgh. He recalled that, recognising that what he had produced recently, including pieces for his periodical The Spy, consisted of ballads or metrical tales, he decided that if he was to produce a long poem it would best consist of a collection of such shorter pieces:Altrive Tales, ed. Gillian Hughes (Edinburgh, 2003), 28. from this came the idea of the framework afforded by a bardic competition staged by Mary, Queen of Scots. 'Macgregor', sung by the eleventh bard, and 'King Edward's Dream', sung by the fifteenth, appeared in The Spy.James Hogg, The Spy, ed. Gillian Hughes (Edinburgh, 2000), 402‚Äì05 (No. 40), 209‚Äì12 (No. 20).

Summary Introduction On her arrival in Scotland, Mary, Queen of Scots summons the nation's bards to a competition at Christmas [1813: at Easter]. Night the First In 'Malcolm of Lorn', the first bard, Rizzio, sings elaborately of a youth who is grief-stricken when his beloved sails for foreign parts with her father and expires just as she returns. In 'Young Kennedy', the second bard, Gardyn, sings of Kennedy's seduction of Matilda and murder of her father, whose spirit haunts their marriage bed, driving Matilda to madness and death. In 'The Witch of Fife', the eighth bard, from Leven, sings of an old man who follows his wife and other witches to Carlisle to drink the bishop's wine. [In 1813 he is burnt alive, in 1819 rescued by his wife.] Night the Second In 'Glen-Avin', the ninth bard, Farquhar of Spey, sings of a sage who dies defying the Spirit of the Storm in the Cairngorms. In 'Old David', the tenth bard, from Hogg's Ettrick, sings of the rescue by David and his seven sons of the beloved of one of them from a cave where she is imprisoned by marauders taken to be fairies. The eleventh bard, from Lomond, sings 'The Spectre's Cradle-Song' and 'Macgregor', the latter telling of the eponymous warrior's abduction by a mysterious fatal woman. In 'Earl Walter', the twelfth bard, from Clyde, sings of young Walter Hamilton's defeating Lord Darcie in single combat before the king and being rewarded with his daughter's hand. In 'Kilmeny', the thirteenth bard, Drummond of Ern, sings of a young woman who is taken to 'the land of thochte' and returns for a period to impart 'wordis of wonder, and wordis of truthe'. Night the Third In 'Mary Scott', the fourteenth bard, from the Borders, sings of how Lord Pringle of Torwoodlee disguises himself as an abbot to visit his beloved Mary, daughter of his rival Tushilaw. When their liaison is discovered, her mother poisons her, but after his forces have triumphed Lord Pringle restores her to life with a kiss, they marry, and peace prevails. In 'King Edward's Dream', the fifteenth bard, from Lammermoor, sings of the dying Edward I's vision of a future free Scotland entering into a voluntary union with England. In 'Drumlanrig', the sixteenth bard, from Nithsdale, sings of the defeat of the Earl of Lennox's invading force by James Douglas of Drumlanrig. Douglas is spurred on by May Morison, who has been abducted by the English and whose brother falls in the conflict: at the end she accepts him as her husband. In 'The Abbot M'Kinnon', the seventeenth bard, from the Hebrides, sings of the sinking of the Abbot of Iona's ship in retribution for his liaison with Matilda of Skye in male disguise. Conclusion After a passionate debate between the factions at Court, Queen Mary's harp is awarded to Gardyn. The Ettrick bard is happy to receive a less elaborate instrument, which will eventually be inherited by Hogg. Reception The first edition of The Queen's Wake was enthusiastically received by almost all of the reviewers as a triumph by a self-taught genius. The only dissenting voice was The Eclectic Review, which objected to the modern obsession with supernatural beings.The Eclectic Review, 9 (June 1813), 647‚Äí53 (647). The third edition was boosted by a favourable review by Francis Jeffrey in The Edinburgh Review, recognising poetry of a high order,The Edinburgh Review, 24 (November 1814), 157‚Äí74. though elsewhere there were less sympathetic verdicts.Mack, op. cit., lxiv‚Äílxv.

Academics  Punchbowl Boys High school is a public (state-run) secondary school educating students throughout years 7 to 12. The school has departments for teaching English, Mathematics, Science, Languages, Music, HSIE (Human Society and Its Environment), PDHPE (Physical Development, Health, and Physical Education), TAS (Technologies), and Visual Arts, as well as other departments which facilitate student learning, such as 'Careers' and 'Teaching and Learning'. Each of these departments teach several subjects. Apart from the above Higher School Certificate courses, Punchbowl High also offers some VET (Vocational Education and Training) courses. History Punchbowl Boys was founded in 1955. In the late 1990s, particularly between 1995‚Äì1999, the school suffered from intrusions by gang members and violence conducted by students, with Clifford Preece, the Principal during the period, testifying to the NSW District Court of numerous incidents of student-perpetrated violence. However, as reported by Doherty & Burke (2003), Preece's successor Michael Glenday declared in 2003 that he had never experienced gang problems since becoming Principal in 2000, and by 2003, the school had received \\"an additional deputy principal, Arabic and Pacific Islander liaison officers, a homework centre and security cameras\\", and was in the process of receiving $800,000 in extra funding and six extra teachers. In 2007, Punchbowl Boys was rife with violence and disrespect among students, according to the new Principal established that year, Jihad Dib. However, Dib initiated a broad program to improve this situation, which involved greeting every student arriving at school and the train station on the way, and involving the wider local community in many school events. As a result, from 2007 to 2013 enrolments almost doubled, the school's growth rate for numeracy was \\"among the highest in the country\\" (Rolfe 2013), and not a single expulsion occurred, with Dib professing that hostility had disappeared from among the students. Chris Griffiths became the Principal of Punchbowl Boys in 2015.\\"New Principal Punchbowl Boys' HS - Director's Message .\\" Punchbowl Boys High School. 5 October 2015. Retrieved on 18 March 2017. In 2017 Griffiths, a convert to Islam, lost his job when he declined to implement an anti religious-radicalisation programme mandated by New South Wales authorities. He had also not included female staff in certain events. Griffiths' deputy was also removed. His replacement, Robert Patruno, stated that he would teach Australian values to the students. Patruno formerly taught at a juvenile detention centre. The relationship between the school and the Bankstown police had deteriorated; Patruno sought to repair this relationship. In 2017 it was reported that there had been an improvement in drug-, alcohol- and weapon- related violence at the school. In May 2019, a former student of Canterbury Boys, along with a former student of Punchbowl Boys, were charged by the police for allegedly aiding ISIS back in 2014.https://7news.com.au/news/islamic-state/isis-terror-allegations-former- sydney-schoolboy-accused-of-helping-relative-create-propaganda-c-127009  Notable alumni  * Steve Folkesformer rugby player * Len Pascoeformer cricket player * Jeff Thomsonformer cricket player * Angelo Gavrielatos advocate for teachers References Further reading * External links * Punchbowl Boys High School Boys' schools in New South Wales Public high schools in Sydney Educational institutions established in 1955 1955 establishments in Australia ","title":"Punchbowl Boys High School"},{"id":"53517042","text":"Yvan Neyou Noupa is a Cameroonian professional footballer who plays as a midfielder for Ligue 1 club AS Saint-√âtienne, on loan from Braga B.

It was found southwest of peribolos of the sanctuary of Athena Chalkioikos on the Acropolis of Sparta. The sculpture is housed in the Archaeological Museum of Sparta which acquired it from the British School at Athens in 1926. The sculpture features a Corinthian helmet with ram-shaped cheek pieces.

According to several scholars, it formed part of the memorial on the Spartan acropolis to honor Leonidas on his reburial. Paul Cartledge, however, argued it would have represented a mythical hero or a god rather than the historical person of Leonidas.

Episodes Production =Development= On March 9, 2016, it was announced that FX had given the production a series order for a first season consisting of ten episodes. The series had been developed at FX due to a \\"first look\\" deal between Danny Boyle and the network. Boyle is expected to executive produce the series alongside Simon Beaufoy and Christian Colson. Beaufoy is also expected to write the series and Boyle is expected to direct. Production companies involved with the series include FX Productions, Cloud Eight Films, Decibel Films, and Snicket Films Limited. On January 5, 2018, it was announced that the series would premiere on March 25, 2018. =Casting= In April 2017, it was announced that Donald Sutherland and Hilary Swank had joined the main cast in the roles of J. Paul Getty and Gail Getty, respectively. On May 15, 2017, it was reported that Harris Dickinson had been cast in the starring role of J. Paul Getty III.

Release Promotional poster. =Marketing= On January 9, 2018, FX released the first official trailer for the series. =Controversy= On March 16, 2018, it was reported that Ariadne Getty, John Paul Getty III's sister, was considering legal action against FX and the producers of the series. Her attorney Martin Singer released a statement calling the series a \\"wildly sensationalized false portrayal\\" of the Getty family and that \\"It is ironic that you have titled your television series Trust. More fitting titles would be Lies or Mistrust, since the defamatory story it tells about the Gettys colluding in the kidnapping is false and misleading.\\" In the statement, Singer went on to explain how his client objects to the alleged portrayal of the family as having played a role in the kidnapping themselves and that he considers it to be defamatory to falsely accuse someone of a crime. Simon Beaufoy has stated that his decision to depict Getty as complicit in his own kidnapping was justified by his research into the matter, though none of the written biographies explicitly reach that conclusion. He stated that while reading Charles Fox's 2013 biography of Paul III, Uncommon Youth, \\"It became clear, reading in between the lines... that he actually kidnapped himself...\\" According to his theory, the plot then spiraled out of Paul's control when his grandfather refused to pay, causing several of his captors to sell their interest to a syndicate of more ruthless Mafiosi. =Renewal plans= On January 5, 2018, the series' producers appeared at the annual Television Critics Association's winter press tour during a panel discussion of the show. Simon Beaufoy spoke about the tentative plans for a potential second season, saying, \\"The idea is to go back to the 1930s to discover how John Paul Getty I became this extraordinary person with this huge hole in his soul.\\" He went on to add that FX was pleased with how the first season had turned out and that he would be interested in returning for subsequent seasons. Reception The first season of Trust has been met with a positive reception from critics. On the review aggregation website Rotten Tomatoes, the first season holds an 80% approval rating with an average rating of 6.51 out of 10, based on 59 reviews.

Matt Zoller Seitz, reviewing for the pop-culture website Vulture, called the show a \\"decadent true-crime with an acidic sense of humor\\" that \\"alternates satire, drama, kookiness, and shocking violence.\\" USA Today complimented the quality of the casting, noting that \\"Sutherland is predictably solid, but Fraser is the surprise, in what's perhaps his big comeback vehicle.\\" It was also described as \\"zippy and fast-paced,\\" with a \\"heightened and stylish feeling.\\" Brendan Fraser's performance as James Fletcher Chace has also received praise from critics; considering his long hiatus from film acting and retreat from celebrity, his role was welcomed as a successful comeback, with TV Guide humorously declaring it the start of a \\"Brenaissance\\".

She has played in it each season since.  Media coverage  The Utah Girls Football League gained national acclaim when it started in 2015. It has seen nationwide news coverage. The league has received both praise and criticism. While most news organizations have simply reported on it being the first of its kind (like CNN, The Huffington Post, USA Today, Fox 13, NBC News, Yahoo Sports and Good Housekeeping), others, such as Bleacher Report and espnW, have reported on Sam Gordon's role in the league. Some media companies have even taken a specific stance on the league. ESPN, for example, aired a segment in which the safety of the league was called into question. In the segment, they brought on a medical doctor who said that there is heightened risk of concussions for children and perhaps even further risk for girls. Others, however, have pushed praise onto the league, encouraging their audience to sign up. In June 2017 Sam Gordon and her father, alongside five other Utah Girls Football League players (and their parents), filed a class action lawsuit against three local school districts to force high schools to offer girls‚Äô football in the Salt Lake Valley. It uses Title IX as justification. The lawsuit is ongoing and has received national coverage.

The episode was written by Aaron Helbing and Todd Helbing from a story by Greg Berlanti and Andrew Kreisberg, and was directed by Dermott Daniel Downs. The episode features a musical crossover with Supergirl and reunites Grant Gustin and Melissa Benoist with their former Glee co-star Darren Criss, who portrays the Music Meister. Jesse L. Martin also reunites with Jeremy Jordan, with whom he previously worked in the 2012 musical film Joyful Noise. The story begins at the end of the Supergirl episode \\"Star-Crossed\\", which aired on March 20, 2017, which saw Kara Danvers / Supergirl (Benoist) hypnotized into a coma by Music Meister, with Mon-El (Chris Wood) and J'onn J'onzz / Martian Manhunter (David Harewood) bringing her to Earth-1 in hope that Team Flash can save her.  Plot  J'onn J'onzz and Mon-El of Earth-38 arrive on Earth-1 with a comatose Kara Danvers, in hope that Barry Allen and his team can revive her. They warn Barry that the escaped prisoner, Music Meister, claimed he would be coming for him too. Meister attacks and places Barry in a similar coma. Barry wakes up to find himself without his powers in a musical dreamworld where he discovers Kara singing in a nightclub (\\"Moon River\\") and where everyone resembles people they know in the real world. Meister tells Kara and Barry that if they follow the script, they will return to the real world. He warns them, however, that if they die in this world, they die in real life (\\"Put a Little Love in Your Heart\\"). Barry and Kara are forced to work as singers in a nightclub run by gangster Cutter Moran. Cutter's rivals Digsy Foss and his husband have their men kidnap Barry and Kara and tell them to find their daughter, Millie Foss, whom they believe is being held hostage by Cutter. Barry and Kara find Millie in a forbidden relationship with Cutter's son, Tommy Moran. They convince the pair to reveal their love, which helps Barry and Kara to realize their own mistakes. Digsy, his husband and Cutter seemingly give their approval (\\"More I Cannot Wish You\\"), but subsequently decide to go to war. Meanwhile in the real world, Meister is revealed to have been stealing Barry and Kara's powers, using them to rob a bank. Cisco Ramon, Wally West and J'onn arrive to fight Meister. They defeat him and lock him up in a S.T.A.R. Labs cell. Back in the musical reality, Barry and Kara prepare to sing an original song to appease Cutter (\\"Super Friend\\"), but the gang war begins outside. Barry and Kara are shot in the crossfire and are dying, but Cisco, Mon-El and Iris vibe into their world to save them, allowing Barry and Kara to admit their love for Iris and Mon-El respectively. They wake up in S.T.A.R. Labs. Meister escapes his cell, revealing to Barry and Kara that he just wanted them to realize their love before leaving. Kara, J'onn and Mon-El return to Earth-38 and Barry and Iris move back in together. Barry serenades and re-proposes to Iris, who accepts (\\"Runnin' Home to You\\").  Production  = Casting = Main cast members Grant Gustin, Candice Patton, Danielle Panabaker, Carlos Valdes, Keiynan Lonsdale, Tom Cavanagh, and Jesse L. Martin star as Barry Allen / Flash, Iris West, Caitlin Snow, Cisco Ramon / Vibe, Wally West / Kid Flash, Harrison \\"H.R.\\" Wells, and Joe West, respectively. In January 2017, Darren Criss was cast as Music Meister. Additionally, the episode's guest cast includes Melissa Benoist as Kara Danvers / Supergirl, David Harewood as J'onn J'onzz / Martian Manhunter and Chris Wood as Mon-El, reprising their roles from Supergirl, along with Legends of Tomorrow actor Victor Garber, Supergirl actor Jeremy Jordan and John Barrowman from Arrow and Legends of Tomorrow playing different roles. = Filming = Filming of the episode occurred from February 1 until February 15, 2017, and was directed by series veteran Dermott Daniel Downs. = Music = In January 2017, Rachel Bloom revealed that she had penned an original song for the episode, which was titled \\"Superfriends\\", and was set to be sung by Gustin and Benoist. Bloom explained that, \\"as soon as I heard that they were doing a musical crossover, I e-mailed [CW president] Mark Pedowitz who connected me to Greg [Berlanti] and Andrew [Kreisberg]. I immediately offered them my services. As soon as they picked one of my song ideas, I hopped on the phone with my old Robot Chicken boss Tom Root and ... based on that brainstorm, I wrote up the song 'Superfriends'. I am so excited to contribute more to the upward trend that is musicals in television and film. Music can be one of the most amazing and efficient forms of storytelling and character development. Also, it was really fun to write a comedy song for two superheroes.\\" The song was later retitled \\"Super Friend\\". Additionally, Benj Pasek and Justin Paul, winners of the Academy Award for Best Original Song for writing the lyrics for \\"City of Stars\\" in La La Land, were the authors of another song written for the episode, \\"Runnin' Home to You\\", which was performed by Gustin. Kreisberg commented, \\"Benj and Justin are the premiere songwriting duo of our time... To have them be a part of our musical episode is beyond our wildest expectations. We hope everyone falls in love with the song they wrote for us as much as we did.\\" A soundtrack, titled, The Flash ‚Äì Music from the Special Episode: Duet, was released on March 22, 2017 from WaterTower Music containing the songs featured the episode.

It was simulcast with the US broadcast in Canada on CTV Two. = Marketing = In early March 2017, a promotional poster for the episode was released, with it being marketed as \\"Dynamic Duet\\", a play on words of the phrase \\"dynamic duo\\". In Australia, where The Flash and Supergirl both air on Fox8, the crossover was marketed as a two-night event called \\"DC Musical Crossover\\".  Critical response  Jesse Schedeen of IGN gave the episode an \\"amazing\\" 9.6 out of 10. He felt the premise was \\"goofy\\" but did a good job incorporating the existing continuity from both series, such as building \\"directly on recent romantic tribulations in Barry and Kara's lives.\\" He enjoyed the team-up with Kid Flash, Martian Manhunter and Vibe, and was glad the writers did not \\"attempt to force in a romantic subplot involving Barry and Kara. As their \\"Super Friends\\" number showed, they're better as friends than lovers.\\" The A.V. Clubs Scott Von Doviak awarded the episode a \\"A‚àí\\", saying there was good chemistry between Gustin and Benoist and that Gustin was able to \\"reconnect with the character's endearing side.\\" Von Doviak concluded, \\"It's probably logistically untenable for them to ever be more than 'super friends,' but if this show ever needed the positive energy they generate together, now was certainly the time.\\"  References   External links  2017 American television episodes Arrowverse crossover episodes The Flash (2014 TV series) episodes Musical television episodes Television episodes about dreams Television episodes about parallel universes ","title":"Duet (The Flash)"},{"id":"53517547","title":"Africa Magic Viewers Choice Award for Best Overall Movie"},{"id":"53517581","text":"JP Sears is an American life coach and internet comedian.

He is trained by Jessica Harrington and owned by Ann and Alan Potts, and is best known for winning the Cheltenham Gold Cup in 2017. He has been ridden in most of his races by Jonathon Burke, but has more recently been ridden Robbie Power, including all four of his Grade 1 wins over fences (the Cheltenham Gold Cup, the Irish Gold Cup, the Punchestown Gold Cup and the John Durkan Memorial Punchestown Chase, all in 2017). He also won a Grade 1 over Hurdles, the Future Champions Novice Hurdle at Leopardstown in 2014, and spent much of his early chasing career finishing second or third in races won by Douvan, widely regarded as one of the best chasers of recent times. Background Sizing John is a dark bay gelding with tiny white socks on his hind legs, bred in North Yorkshire, England by Bryan & Sandra Mayoh of Eskdale Stud. As a foal he was sent to Ireland and put up for sale in November 2010 at Tattersalls where he was bought for ‚Ç¨16,000 by John Bleahan. He eventually entered the ownership of Alan Potts and was sent into training with Henry de Bromhead at Knockeen, County Waterford. The colt was gelded as a yearling. Sizing John was sired by Midnight Legend, a horse who raced successfully both on the flat and over hurdles winning the March Stakes, Glorious Stakes, Top Novices' Hurdle and Champion Novice Hurdle. As a breeding stallion he has sired several other good jumpers including Midnight Chase (Cotswold Chase) and Seeyouatmidnight (Rendlesham Hurdle, Dipper Novices' Chase). Sizing John's dam La Perrotine was a French-bred mare who showed some ability on the track, winning one National Hunt Flat race and three times over hurdles. Her dam Haratiyna was half-sister to the Italian Derby winner Houmayoun and a descendant of the Poule d'Essai des Pouliches winner Altissima. Sizing John reportedly enjoys listening to music after exercise, displaying a particular fondness for Roar by Katy Perry. Racing career =2013/2014 National Hunt season= Sizing John began his racing career in National Hunt Flat in the spring of 2014. Ridden by an amateur jockey he finished sixth at Limerick Racecourse in March and fourth to Forgotten Rules at Punchestown in April. =2014/2015 National Hunt season= In the 2014/2015 National Hunt season Sizing John was campaigned in novice hurdle races and was ridden in all of his races by Jonathan \\"Johnny\\" Burke. On his first appearance over obstacles at Naas Racecourse on 2 November she started 5/2 favourite and won by two lengths from Phil's Magic. Three weeks later at Gowran Park he proved no match for the Willie Mullins-trained Douvan and was beaten twelve lengths into second place. In December he was stepped up in class for the Future Champions Novice Hurdle at Leopardstown Racecourse and started the 11/1 outsider in a five-runner field headed by Nichols Canyon. He led from the start and stayed on well over the last two hurdles to win by six and a half lengths from Sub Lieutenant. On 10 March Sizing John made his first appearance at the Cheltenham Festival when he started a 25/1 outsider for the Supreme Novices' Hurdle. He took the lead at the second last but was overtaken approaching the finalobstacle and finished third behind Douvan and Shaneshill. On his final appearance of the season he faced Douvan again in the Herald Champion Novice Hurdle at Punchestown in April and was beaten seven and a half lengths into second by his rival. =2015/2016 National Hunt season= Sizing John began the 2015/2016 National Hunt season by competing in novice chases and made a successful debut over fences by winning at Punchestown in October at odds of 2/11. In the following month he stepped up to Group 2 class and started favourite for the Craddockstown Novice Chase at the same track. He disputed the lead from the start, drew clear of his opponents approaching the final fence and won \\"comfortably\\" by eight lengths from the Gordon Elliott- trained Lord Scoundrel. Henry de Bromhead commented \\"\\"I'm delighted with that. It was a super ride by Johnny and he jumped great... I'd be in no rush to step him up in trip, but he does look like a horse that will go further\\". For the rest of the season, Sizing John's path to major success was repeatedly blocked by Douvan. He finished second to the Mullins champion in the Racing Post Novice Chase at Leopardstown in December and the Arkle Challenge Trophy at the Cheltenham Festival in March before ending his season by running third behind Douvan and The Game Changer in the Ryanair Novice Chase at Punchestown on 28 April. In between the last two races he was moved up in distance and started favourite for the Manifesto Novices' Chase over two and a half miles at Aintree but appeared to tire in the closing stages and finished third behind Arzal and L'Ami Serge. =2016/2017 National Hunt season= Before the start of the next season, Sizing John was transferred to the stable of Jessica Harrington at Moone, County Kildare. Robbie Power took over from Burke as his regular jockey. On his first appearance for his new trainer Sizing John was beaten by Douvan for the seventh time when he finished second behind his old rival in the Grade 1 Paddy Power Cashcard Chase at Leopardstown in December. The gelding was then moved up in distance for the Kinloch Brae Chase over two and a half miles at Thurles Racecourse on 19 January and started third favourite behind Sub Lieutenant and Black Hercules (Golden Miller Novices' Chase). After being restrained by Power in third place he produced a strong finish, staying on well to take the lead on the run-in and winning by two and a half lengths from Sub Lieutenant. Sizing John was stepped up again in distance for the Irish Gold Cup over three miles at Leopardstown on 12 February. He was made the 100/30 second favourite behind Don Poli in a seven- runner field which also included Carlingford Lough (winner of the race for the last two years), Empire of Dirt (Mildmay of Flete Challenge Cup), More Of That, Road To Riches (Galway Plate, Lexus Chase) and Minella Rocco (National Hunt Chase Challenge Cup). Road To Riches set the early pace before giving way to Don Poli with Sizing John racing close behind before making progress approaching the second last. Sizing John overtook Don Poli at the last fence and held off a sustained challenge from Empire of Dirt to win by three quarters of a length. After the race Harrington said \\"He was just brilliant. He was still cantering turning in, as far as I could see, and when he asked him he quickened up. I know he didn't win very far, but he still won and he wasn't stopping... He looks like a three-mile chaser rather than a two-miler\\". On 17 March Sizing John, racing over three and a quarter miles, attempted to become the first horse since Imperial Call in 1996 to win both the Irish Gold Cup and the Cheltenham Gold Cup in the same season. Djakadam headed the betting from Native River (Hennessy Gold Cup, Welsh Grand National) and Cue Card with Sizing John fourth choice on 7/1. More Of That and Minella Rocco were again in opposition along with Outlander (Lexus Chase), Champagne West (Thyestes Chase), Bristol de Mai (Scilly Isles Novices' Chase, Peter Marsh Chase), Saphir du Rheu (Mildmay Novices' Chase), Smad Place (Hennessy Gold Cup, Cotswold Chase), Irish Cavalier (Charlie Hall Chase) and Tea For Two (Kauto Star Novices' Chase). Sizing John raced in mid-division before beginning to make progress at the fourth last and moved up to join the leaders Djakadam and Native River at the second last. He took the lead, established a clear avantage approaching the final fence and stayed on up the run-in to win by two and three-quarter lengths from the fast-finishing Minella Rocco. Native River and Djakadam were just behind in third and fourth. For his final race of the 2016-17 season Sizing John was sent off the 9/10 favourite for the Punchestown Gold Cup over three miles at Punchestown on 26 April. He was opposed again by Djakadam, Outlander and Champagne West as well as the 2016 Cheltenham Gold Cup winner Coneygree and Flemenstar, winner of the Racing Post Novice Chase, Arkle Novice Chase and John Durkan Memorial Punchestown Chase in 2012. Sizing John was held up in the rear of the field early on and moved up to close on the leaders, Djakadam and Coneygree, at the final fence. Djakadam made a slight mistake at the last and Sizing John stayed on strongly to win by a short head from Djakadam at the finish with Coneygree third. Harrington commented after the race \\"He was never travelling the way he did at Cheltenham, but pure guts got him there\\". =2017/2018 National Hunt season= On 10th December 2017, Sizing John made a winning start to the season in the John Durkan Memorial Punchestown Chase with Djakadam once again in second place. His second and what proved to be his last appearance of the season was on the 28th December in the Leopardstown Christmas Chase in which he came home in 7th place with Road to Respect the victor. Injury curtailed his season and he was unable to defend his crown at Cheltenham for the Gold Cup of 2018. =2018/2019 National Hunt season= More injury setbacks for Sizing John as he was ruled out for the whole season. =2019/2020 National Hunt season= After an absence of 733 days, Sizing John finally returned to a racetrack on 31st December, 2019 for the Bet With Tote At Punchestown Hurdle. Seemingly going well, he came to grief with two hurdles remaining which was the first time he had ever fallen.

I didn't want to grow old that way.\\" Rather early she dreamed of going to Morocco like August Macke, in order to \\"meet my self in the faraway lands, to dive into the opium of unfettered suns.\\" She always wanted to be a traveller and visit the great museums of the world, these power stations of concentrated energy, to meet the Giottos, Masaccios, van Eycks, Vermeers, Manets and Turners there, and \\"maybe only to stand only once in front of a small watercolour by William Blake.\\" In a 1996 interview, Schleime reflects on her life in East Berlin's effect on her work \\"I believe in general, and here I refer to the time in the East, that the oppression or limitations which I experienced did not influence painting. The painting was or is not for me a processing machine for political or personal emergency. In any case, I suffered more from the provinciality of the GDR than from their politics, so our conversations in the East were so often centered around the \\"universal.\\" No, I can handle nothing with my painting. My work should be purpose-free, only in this way can I open up new spaces. In the east I had one of the cops, who was standing at the Friedrichstrasse junction, with the umbrella - that was the way to get my frustration, not the brush!\\" Both Schleime's parents were of catholic origin, her father is from the Rhineland and her mother from Gdansk (Danzig). They moved to Berlin (East) after the war. Her father, who had been married before, could not marry her mother in church, according to catholic rules. So the grandparents only consented to the partnership under the condition that Schleime be raised strictly catholic. Her experience with Catholicism is a consistent influence to her works. Between 1970 and 1975 Schleime completed a hairdresser's apprenticeship and a studied as a camouflage and make-up artist. She later worked as a stable-girl at the Dresden Thoroughbred Races and as a nursing assistant for a short time. = Studies at Dresden Academy of Fine Arts = Schleime began her studies of painting and graphic arts at the Dresden Academy of Fine Arts in 1975. In 1980 she received her diploma in painting and graphic arts at the Academy of Arts at the Br√ºhlsche Terrasse. = Association with feminism = A number of artists, including Schleime, were contributing to a strong feminist voice within East German underground art, working with a clear feminist idiom and feminist content, without realizing they were or actively participating in a larger international feminist debate. In a 2016 interview Schleime confronted the comparison of her works to 1970s feminist avant-garde artists Annegret Soltau and Hannah Wilke: \\"Of course I had heard of these artists. But I wasn‚Äôt interested in feminism at all. When I went to the West, the feminists thought they had found a comrade-in-arms. But they were wrong. My actions aren‚Äôt directed against men. They‚Äôre directed against the fact that they stripped me of the freedom to show my art, and so I got naked and tied myself up. I didn‚Äôt do it for sexual reasons. I got naked because I was forced to be naked. The GDR took everything I had. I also did those things where I enveloped myself in barbed wire. It was more about vulnerability, about being at someone‚Äôs mercy, about Christ with the crown of thorns. I am closer to Arnulf Rainer than to the feminists. He speaks of the negation of all extravagance. Everything that is excessive is negated. He tried to reduce everything and overpainted his works until only a bleating mouth peeped out.\\" = T√ºrenausstellung = In her undergraduate days, Schleime belonged to a group of young artists who formed a counter-movement to official GDR art policy. The artists pursued new experimental paths and devised alternative presentation formats in studios and private homes. Schleime began her exploration of performance art with works such as a \\"Raum des Dichters\\" (Room of the Poet) in the autumn of 1979 as part of this. The group refused to exhibit conventional art as defined by the authorities in the GDR and developed a project of working on a topical issue relevant to their generation. They agreed on a proposal by Michael Freudenberg to choose the theme of doors, an associative response to being in a country enclosed by a wall. In the autumn of 1979, the Leonhardi Museum in Dresden (the former studio-house of the Dresden late Romantic Eduard Leonhardi ) hosted the group's collaborative work ‚ÄúT√ºrenausstellung‚Äù (‚ÄúExhibition of Doors‚Äù). Michael Freudenberg, Monika Hanske, Volker Henze, Ralf Kerbach, Helge Leiberg, Reinhard Sandner, Cornelia Schleime and Karla Woisnitza each created an installation, while Thomas Wetzel organised four outdoor actions relating to the theme. The exhibition attracted attention from the general public, with A. R. Penck claiming that it represented ‚Äúthe beginning of victory over false consciousness (falsches Bewu√ütsein)!‚Äù. Her participation in this exhibition, her broad definition of art and her unconventional works and shows resulted in an exhibition ban for her in 1981. In an interview in 2017 she explains that she planning an exhibition that was prevented. \\"The exhibition manager told me that the culture ministry had imposed a ban on my work. I started working with the pseudonym CMP [Cornelia Monica Petra, Schleime‚Äôs full name] so that they wouldn‚Äôt know it was me... I was never an enemy of the state or anything like that, I just had a different visual concept. I was told, for instance, that a woman I‚Äôd painted, with her head hanging down in a melancholy, surreal expression, didn‚Äôt look as she should according to socialism.\\" = Zwitschermaschine = Zwitschermaschine Cornelia Schleime and Ralf Kerbach met at the Dresden University of Fine Arts and created the art-punk band Zwitschermaschine, or \\"Twittering\\". After a failed art exhibition in the Radeburg Heimatmuseum, organized by Michael Rom, they decided to make music together. The band lasted from 1979 to 1983. Ralf Kerbach, inspired by the Sex Pistols and the Stranglers, was guitarist. Schleime was the vocalist and was accompanied by Matthias Zeidler on bass and Wolfgang Grossmann on drums. The band name resulted either from Ralf Kerbach's predilection for Paul Klee's homonymous picture, or from a performance of Luis Bu√±uel's film An Andalusian dog. They performed in studios, In the drama school Ernst Busch and in the Erfurt \\"gallery in the hall\\". Some concerts were canceled by the state power. Musically, they were characterised as New Music, the dilettantism of the opening days led to a sort of Dadaist concept, which was located somewhere in the intersection of sophisticated music and three-chord punk. Schleime later learned that one of their friends had been recruited to spy on them. She said in a 2017 interview that \\"the punk band actually wasn‚Äôt an act of rebellion, it was just a way of expressing myself since I wasn‚Äôt allowed to exhibit art.\\" = Transition to West Berlin = After graduating, she moved from University in Dresden back to East Berlin's Prenzlauer Berg, where she came into contact with the civil rights movement and Sascha Anderson, a close friend of hers who was later revealed to be part of the Stasi that was spying on her. In 1984, five years before the fall of the Berlin Wall, Schleime was permitted to leave for the West. This move meant, however, that she had to leave all her work behind in East Germany. Almost her entire body of works up to that date remained in the GDR and has disappeared. Schleime recalls \\"I went to the West with four or five pictures under my arm, a duvet, and my son. After I had found an apartment, the transport of my works was supposed to be organized. In the 24 hours, a girlfriend came and made a list of everything: 95 oil paintings, sculptures, and the photographic documentation of my actions. When she arrived, the apartment had been broken into and there was only garbage lying around.\\" In 1989 she moved to New York City on a one-year stipend for a working fellowship for the Senate for Cultural Affairs Berlin. Schleime was then part of the MOMA PS1's National and International Studio Program Exhibition from 1990 to 1991 (March 3‚ÄìMarch 24, 1991) on a DAAD scholarship. She states in her 2016 interview that \\"Through the USA I had finally acclimated myself to the West, had finally arrived. It took me a long time, as a woman without work. I had to start from scratch again in the West.\\" Schleime currently lives and works in Berlin and Brandenburg = Various Travels = Cornelia Schleime, self-portrait as a pilot, 2001 In 1992 she was the Project and Work Fellowships Kunstfonds Bonn - Prize Winner of the project \\"Mauer im Kopf\\", Foundation for New Cultural Studies in Kenya. In 1993 she participated in ONLY - a Reisestipendium (travel scholarship) to Indonesia until 1994. In 1997 she participated in a workshop of the German-Brazilian Cultural Association in Salvador, Brazil. In 1998-99 she embarked on a study tour in Hawaii. = Awards = She was awarded The Gabriele-M√ºnter-Prize in 2003. Awarded the Fred Thieler Prize in 2004. Received an award for excellent painting in 2005 from the National Art Museum of China. Received an honorary scholarship at the K√ºnstlerhaus Lukas in Ahrenshoop in 2010. In 2016 Schleime was awarded the Hannah H√∂ch Preis from the State of Berlin for her life's work.  Work  While in school she often visited the S√§chsische Landesbibliothek (Saxonian County Library) where she discovered Arnulf Rainer, Cy Twombly, Francis Bacon. After graduating from the Dresden School, her work shifted from the classical traditions. She experimented with coffee-grounds and sand bound by glue, a technique she still uses today to break up the even surface, painting by means of scratching and scarring and making marks. In the early 1980s, Schleime drew, painted and wrote poetry, explored performance art and eventually began making films, particularly with the use of Super 8 film. After leaving for the West it was found that in the years preceding she had been closely monitored by the Stasi. From the Stasi records that she was allowed to look at after the fall of the Wall, she created the series ‚ÄúUntil Further Good Collaboration, No. 7284/85‚Äù In which she performs her file to meet and then exceed the judgments and speculations of her observers. Also around this time she began her ongoing series with the conceptual theme of braids, the most recent being in 2015. On the inception of this she says \\"There was a text in my Stasi file that read as follows: ‚ÄúBeyond these investigations, the ABV had no other information because Schleime behaved very inconspicuously.‚Äù So I thought: I'll satirize that. I bought a wig, wove hemp into it and lengthened it to four meters or so, attached a pram to the back and found out where Sascha Anderson's commanding officer's house was. Then I walked back and forth in front of the house with the baby carriage. A ZDF television team was there. I saw that the curtains moved and he was of course scared stiff.\\" She identifies this series as her only truly conceptual work. Schleime's painting style is inspired by artists that were a strong influence in her classical studies such as Bacon and Balthus, Monet, Rembrandt, and Van Gogh. After coming to the West, she first experienced a compulsion to paint classically, works such as ‚ÄúThe East is Gray.‚Äù She also recreated pieces left behind in the GDR in poetic works resembling landscapes. She countered this with her experimental performance pieces. Schleime has focused since the 1990s on figures and large-format portraits. Sources of inspiration are glossy magazines, reproductions of all kinds, but also personal photographs or snapshots found at flea markets. Through the intuitive act of drawing or painting, she turns those she depicts into something creative of her own, projecting them in new roles, symbolically emphasising the poses encountered or highlighting aspects with a touch of fantasy and irony.

In genetics, transcriptional amplification is the process in which the total amounts of messenger RNA (mRNA) molecules from expressed genes are increased during disease, development, or in response to stimuli. At the subset of genes expressed in a given cell, the transcribing activity of RNA Polymerase II results in mRNA production. Transcriptional amplification is specifically defined as the increase in per-cell abundance of this set of expressed mRNAs. Transcriptional amplification is caused by changes in the amount or activity of transcription- regulating proteins. Mechanisms of transcriptional amplification Gene expression is regulated by numerous types of proteins that directly or indirectly influence transcription by RNA Polymerase II. As opposed to transcriptional activators or repressors that selectively activate or repress specific genes, amplifiers of transcription act globally on the set of initially expressed genes. Several known regulators of transcriptional amplification have been characterized including the oncogene Myc., the Rett syndrome protein MECP2, and the BET bromodomain protein BRD4. In particular, the Myc protein amplifies transcription by binding to promoters and enhancers of active genes where it directly recruits the transcription elongation factor P-TEFb. Furthermore, the BRD4 protein is a regulator of Myc activity. Identifying and measuring transcriptional amplification Commonly used gene expression experiments interrogate the expression of one (qPCR) or many (microarray, RNA-Seq) genes. These techniques generally measure relative mRNA levels and employ normalization methods that assume only a small number of genes show altered expression. Instead, single cell or cell count normalized absolute measurements of mRNA abundance are required to reveal transcriptional amplification. Additionally, global measurements of mRNA or total mRNA per cell can also uncover evidence for transcriptional amplification. Cells in which transcription has been amplified have additional suggestive hallmarks that amplification has occurred. Cells with increased mRNA levels may be larger, consistent with an increased abundance of gene products. This increase in the amount of gene product may result in a decreased doubling time. Role in disease Transcriptional amplification has been implicated in cancer, Rett syndrome, heart disease, Down syndrome, and cellular aging. In cancer, Myc driven transcriptional amplification is posited to help tumor cells overcome rate-limiting constraints in growth and proliferation. Drugs that target the transcription or mRNA processing machinery are known to be particularly effective against Myc-driven tumor models, suggesting that dampening of transcriptional amplification can have anti-tumor effects. Similarly, small molecules targeting the BET bromodomain protein BRD4, which is up-regulated during heart failure, can block cardiac hypertrophy in mouse models. In Rett syndrome, which is caused by loss of function of the transcriptional regulator MeCP2, MeCP2 was shown to specifically amplify transcription in neurons and not neuronal precursors. Restoration of MeCP2 reverses disease symptoms associated with Rett syndrome  References  Genetics ","title":"Transcriptional amplification"},{"id":"53517690","text":"Vattica, (stylized VATTICA) is an American alternative rock band from Los Angeles, California formed in 2013. The band currently consists of Alexander Millar (lead vocals, guitar, keyboards), Isaac Waters (bass, backing vocals), Jonny Ros√© (lead guitar, backing vocals) and Ryan Linderman (drums). The band performed at venues such as The Viper Room, The Roxy Theater and The Troubadour. They were signed to a recording contract in 2015 by Another Century / Sony Music. History VATTICA formed in 2013 in Los Angeles, California as a collaboration between Alexander Millar, Prentice and Joey Jane. The name VATTICA is a fusion of Old English and Latin root words and syllables: Vat (faet), meaning vessel, and Vatic/Vatical (of or characteristic of a prophet or oracle), and Ah (exclamation expressing surprise/irony). By 2014 the group had performed at various notable venues and clubs around Los Angeles, including The Roxy Theater, Whisky a Go Go, The Viper Room and The Troubadour. =Early Years (2014-2017)= In August 2014, VATTICA entered the studio to record a self-produced demo album in Los Angeles. In January 2015, the band announced their signing to Another Century Records. =Debut album recording (2017)= In 2016 VATTICA entered the studio to begin recording their debut album at The Mix Room in Burbank, California, with record producer Ben Grosse. In 2017 VATTICA finished their debut album. At the same time, Another Century was absorbed by RED Music. Alexander elaborated on the separation further in an interview with Pure Grain Media. In an interview with Bi Pride UK in 2020 Alexander spoke further about getting out of the band's recording contract. VATTICA then joined forces with new management and released their first single, ‚ÄúREMEMBER TO BREATHE‚Äù, on their own label VILLIS with distribution through The Orchard in April 2018. = Independent success: 2018-Present = VATTICA released their second single and music video, \\"Criminal\\", in October 2018. In 2019 VATTICA changed their lineup, adding guitarist Jonny Rose and bassist Isaac Waters, prior to the announcement that the band would be appearing on the High School Nation tour. = 2020: New lineup and EP release = In 2020 VATTICA solidified their lineup with the addition of drummer Ryan Linderman and released their debut EP entitled \\"Believe\\". Musical style VATTICA performing live at The Echo in Los Angeles. VATTICA‚Äôs music is alternative pop rock characterized by soaring vocal melodies, driving guitars, vast orchestration and commanding rhythm sections of wide dynamic variety. Their lyrical content often reflects on the universal themes of the human experience, while also commenting on sociopolitical issues.

She is a published academic researcher, has been published on XOJane and her Cracked article inspired an off Broadway play, Taught. She has written a fictional account of weight loss reality television, that she self- published in December 2017, and speaks at conferences on the topics of body acceptance, mental health, and weight loss reality television. Personal life Kai Hibbard was born in 1978, the middle daughter of three girls in a military family. She was born in Kodiak, Alaska to Audrey Aflague, a nurse of Chamorro heritage and Lawrence Hibbard, a member of the United States Coast Guard. She went to college for her undergraduate education in Hawaii and Alaska. After completing her undergraduate work, she worked as an aerobics instructor, child protective services worker for the State of Alaska, and as a law office assistant. In 2006 she was awarded a full scholarship to University of Maine Law School. She is married, has a boyfriend and a young autistic son. Professional life In August 2011, Hibbard joined the Alaska Army National Guard and was subsequently discharged in 2014 after breaking her pelvis, and her right foot while on active duty at Fort Benning. In November 2015, continuing with body acceptance activism both online and in person, Hibbard was a featured speaker at the Binge Eating Disorder Association (BEDA) national conference addressing the positive effects body acceptance has on physical and mental health along with her personal journey into activism and social work in the aftermath of reality television. In 2016, she was the keynote speaker for the East Coast Body Positive Fitness Alliance conference in Boston and executive produced the off Broadway play Taught. In addition, she appeared throughout 2016 as an expert voice and body acceptance activist for CNN HLN. Given an opportunity to recount her experiences in her own words in writing in addition to speaking engagements, she penned a piece for XoJane in January 2015 with academic citations detailing her reflections and education on her experiences on weight loss reality TV. In December 2018, Hibbard published her first \\"Losing It: A Fictional Reimagining of my Time on Weight Loss Reality TV\\", a fictionalized version of her time on weight loss reality TV. Academic career Hibbard graduated with honors from University of Alaska Anchorage with a BA in Justice, a BA in Psychology and a minor in English. She declined acceptance to the University of Maine Law School to pursue an MSW at University of Alaska Anchorage taking a leave of absence in 2008 from school to start a family and join the Alaska Army National Guard. In 2016 Hibbard was contacted by a professor, Darren D. Moore, Ph.D., LMFT from Mercer University School of Medicine, department of Psychiatry and Behavioral Sciences, Marriage and Family Therapy Program, now with Alliant International University, Couple and Family Therapy Program about research regarding the experience of significant weight loss and the psychological effects of participating in weight loss reality television. She became a member of the research team, and completed qualitative research published March 2017 and again in April 2018 in The Qualitative Report under her married name Zwierstra. She recently graduated with her MSW from the University of New England and is now a licensed LMSW in the state of MD. Activism In April 2006 Hibbard was selected as one of 14 cast members for Season 3 of the US version of The Biggest Loser. She went on to take second place at the finale losing 118 pounds. During the filming of the show Hibbard was featured as the cover model for the December 2006 issue of Prevention magazine. Following the finale and airing of The Biggest Loser Hibbard was featured as the cover model on the April 2007 issue of Woman's World magazine. In May 2007, Hibbard gave a Time magazine interview where she denounced the methods used on The Biggest Loser and brought light to the unhealthy techniques used to cut weight for the show; starting her career in activism for body acceptance and critical analysis of weight loss reality television. She was quoted in The New York Times in October 2007 discussing the dehydration and unhealthy techniques used to achieve weight loss on The Biggest Loser. In March 2009 she followed up with a spotlight interview in the Anchorage Daily News detailing the health struggles of life since appearing on reality television. She appeared as the spokesperson for Body Renew Gyms in Alaska from 2008 through 2009, then in 2010 partnered with David McLane to appear in their marketing materials for a line of vitamins and supplements, parting ways when the company went in a different direction that Hibbard felt was against her message of activism. In April 2010, Eric Deggans then with the Tampa Bay Times published an interview with Hibbard detailing the \\"unhealthy misleading\\" attributes of the show. In June that same year Hibbard appeared on The Early Show detailing the harsh unhealthy reality of weight loss reality television. ABC News picked up the story in that same month of 2010 with a piece detailing Hibbard‚Äôs renunciation of the show's methods. The Huffington Post also picked up the interview. The story gained more traction when Hibbard did an interview with Golda Poretsky of BodyLoveWellness that was taken by Perez Hilton. In 2013 when Season 15 The Biggest Loser winner Rachel Frederickson won with a BMI in the unhealthy range, Hibbard was once again thrust into the spotlight because she had previously warned that results like this were inevitable with the methods used on the show. In February 2014 The New York Times interviewed Hibbard about the show, and how reality television affects viewers and participants negatively. That same month Hibbard recounted to the Huffington Post the lack of aftercare contestants receive in the aftermath of the show. In May 2014, Hibbard completed an interview/collaborated on a piece for Cracked, \\"Five Details They Cut From My Season of The Biggest Loser\\", which was viewed over two million times. It was one of that year's most popular articles, and was picked up by The Huffington Post and led to the 2016 Off-Broadway play, Taught, loosely based on Hibbard‚Äôs experiences written by Mercedes Lake. In June 2014, the show's arguably most famous trainer Jillian Michaels left the show stating she was \\"deeply concerned\\" about the show‚Äôs \\"poor care of the contestants\\" lending credence to Hibbard's claims of unhealthy physical and psychological methods used by the show. In January 2015, the New York Post published an article detailing some of the experiences Hibbard had on The Biggest Loser along with the support of unnamed anonymous fellow contestants. Hibbard referred to The Biggest Loser as an \\"unhealthy fat shaming sh*t show\\" in a January 2015 Redbook interview and producers of the show fired back in January 2015 in People magazine and on E! News Daily. In that same month of 2015 Us Weekly featured a profile detailing the health ramifications participation in The Biggest Loser had on Hibbard's physical health (though they got details like weight loss totals wrong) along with a piece in the Boston Herald on the topic. Also in January 2015, fellow former Biggest Loser contestants Rulon Gardner, Suzanne Mendonca, Lezlye Donahue and Joelle Gwynn came forward in a New York Post piece supporting Hibbard‚Äôs previous claims about the show's practices and alleging that contestants health is adversely affected. That piece was followed in May 2015 with a piece also in the New York Post alleging drug use on set as directed by the show, and a lawsuit against one of the contestants, Joelle Gwynn, was initiated by Richard Huizenga, the doctor associated with the show. In 2016, the results of a long-term study by the National Institute of Health (NIH) were released that documented the weight gain and loss of contestants in Season 8. The study found that most of the 16 contestants regained their weight, and in some cases weighed more than before they entered the contest. The New York Times reported: \\"When the show began, the contestants, though hugely overweight, had normal metabolisms for their size, meaning they were burning a normal number of calories for people of their weight. When it ended, their metabolisms had slowed radically and their bodies were not burning enough calories to maintain their thinner sizes. ... What shocked the researchers was what happened next: As the years went by and the numbers on the scale climbed, the contestants‚Äô metabolisms did not recover. They became even slower, and the pounds kept piling on. It was as if their bodies were intensifying their effort to pull the contestants back to their original weight.\\" The article quoted Dr. Michael Rosenbaum who said, \\"The difficulty in keeping weight off reflects biology, not a pathological lack of willpower.\\" Hibbard spearheaded the wave of former contestants, demanding NBC cancel the show in light of years of contestant statements and this study's results.

Roosevelt in Grosvenor Square The Eagle Squadrons Memorial is a Second World War memorial in Grosvenor Square, London. It commemorates the service of the three Royal Air Force Eagle Squadrons from 1940 to 1942, during the Battle of Britain, and in particular their 244 Americans and 16 British fighter pilots, of whom 71 were killed. The bronze sculpture of an eagle which tops the memorial is by Elisabeth Frink. Background The Eagle Squadrons were RAF fighter squadrons, mostly manned by US citizens who volunteered to serve before Nazi Germany declared war on the US in December 1941. At that time, US citizens were prohibited from serving in the armed forces of a foreign power, on pain of losing their citizenship (although those affected were pardoned by Congress in 1944). US pilots were recruited to serve in Europe by Charles F. Sweeny from 1939. A unit staffed by US citizens was accepted by the RAF in July 1940, and No. 71 Squadron RAF was formed in September 1940, becoming operational in February 1941. It was followed by No. 121 Squadron RAF in May 1941 and No. 133 Squadron RAF in July 1941, flying initially Hawker Hurricanes and later Supermarine Spitfires. Efforts to recruit US citizens to serve in the RAF continued on a more organised basis under the aegis of the Clayton Knight Committee, which recruited around 7,000 US citizens to serve in the RAF or Royal Canadian Air Force by the time the US joined the war in December 1941, after the Japanese attack on Pearl Harbor. The three Eagle Squadrons transferred to the United States Army Air Forces in September 1942, becoming 334th, 335th and 336th Fighter Squadrons in the 4th Fighter Group in VIII Fighter Command. Memorial The memorial comprises a tapering high obelisk of pale sandstone, topped by a high bronze sculpture of an eagle holding its wings aloft. The head of the eagle is painted white, so it resembles an American bald eagle. It was commissioned by American newspaper owner William Randolph Hearst, and designed by Tim Kempster, who was also involved in the design of the Fleet Air Arm Memorial. The bronze sculpture is by Elisabeth Frink. The four sides of the stone column each bear inscriptions. The main side, to the north, has a spread eagle from the Great Seal of the United States, holding arrows in one claw and an olive branch in the other, and an inscription EAGLE SQUADRONS / THIS MEMORIAL IS TO THE / MEMORY OF THE 244 AMERICAN / AND 16 BRITISH FIGHTER PILOTS / AND OTHER PERSONNEL WHO / SERVED IN THE THREE ROYAL / AIR FORCE EAGLE SQUADRONS / PRIOR TO THE PARTICIPATION OF / THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA IN THE SECOND WORLD WAR / THEY SERVED WITH VALOR / FOUNDED BY CHARLES F SWEENY, JUNE 1940 / ERECTED THROUGH THE GENEROSITY / OF THE / HEARST CORPORATION OF AMERICA / IN THE NAME OF / WILLIAM RANDOLPH HEARST / PUBLISHER. Each of the three other sides is dedicated to one of the Eagle Squadrons ‚Äì 133 Squadron, 121 Squadron, or 71 Squadron ‚Äì with a depiction of each squadron's crest and motto, and a list of those who served: 289 individuals, including 71 war dead. The memorial was erected in 1985, near the US Embassy in London, and close to a statue of US President Franklin D. Roosevelt. It was officially unveiled in May 1986 by the British Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher, and became a Grade II listed building in January 2016. The US Embassy is scheduled to move to a new building in Nine Elms in 2017, but the memorial will remain in Grosvenor Square.

It is a ground orchid with a single hairy leaf and a single scented pink flower. Although it may have had a wider distribution in the past, the total number of plants in 2000 was estimated to be 120 in four populations in Victoria. There is a single record from New South Wales but the orchid is classified as \\"extinct\\" in that state. Description Caladenia rosella is a terrestrial, perennial, deciduous, herb with an underground tuber and a single erect, hairy leaf, long and wide. A single pale or bright pink flower wide is borne on a stalk tall. The sepals and petals have long, dark, thread-like tips covered with glandular hairs. The dorsal sepal is erect, long and wide. The lateral sepals are long, wide and spread widely, turning slightly downwards. The petals are long, wide and arranged like the lateral sepals. The labellum is long, wide and pale pink near its base but darker pink near its edges and tip. The sides of the labellum have linear teeth up to long and the tip of the labellum is curled under. There are four or six rows of pink calli along the centre of the labellum. In warm weather the flowers have a musky scent. Flowering occurs from August to September. Taxonomy Caladenia rosella was first formally described in 1988 by Geoffrey Carr from a specimen collected near Hurstbridge and the description was published in Muelleria. The specific epithet (rosella) is the diminutive form of the Latin word rosa meaning \\"of roses\\", hence \\"rose-pink\\" referring to the colour of the flowers of this orchid. Distribution and habitat The rosella spider orchid occurs in areas to the near-north of Melbourne where it grows in woodlands and low forests. It was formerly more widespread in central and western Victoria and in nearby parts of New South Wales. Ecology The most likely pollinator of C. rosella is a male thynnid wasp but a small bee in the genus Neoproctus has been shown to also be a pollinator of this species. Conservation The numbers of the rosella orchid have declined because of habitat loss and fragmentation so that by 2000, only 120 plants in four populations near Melbourne were known. The species is classified as \\"extinct\\" in New South Wales, as \\"endangered\\" under the Australian Government Environment Protection and Biodiversity Conservation Act 1999 and as \\"endangered\\" under the Victorian Flora and Fauna Guarantee Act 1988. The main threats to the species are weed invasion, trampling during recreational activities and grazing by rabbits.

Photo by Gabriel Chmielewski. Stephen Andrew Maren (born November 7, 1967) is an American behavioral neuroscientist investigating the brain mechanisms of emotional memory, particularly the role context plays in the behavioral expression of fear. He has discovered brain circuits regulating context-dependent memory, including mapping functional connections between the hippocampus, prefrontal cortex, and amygdala that are involved in the expression and extinction of learned fear responses. Maren obtained his undergraduate education at the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign, graduating in Psychology (BS) in 1989. His undergraduate research resulted in an honors thesis that described, for the first time, the activity of basolateral amygdala neurons during this form of learning. He obtained his PhD in Biological Sciences (Neurobiology) in 1993 at the University of Southern California. Maren explored the role for glutamate receptors in hippocampal long-term potentiation and the relationship of long-term potentiation to learning and memory. He was the first to demonstrate that expression of long- term potentiation is associated with an increase in postsynaptic glutamate receptors. Maren received his post-doctoral training with Michael S. Fanselow at the University of California, Los Angeles from 1993 to 1996. He established a role for amygdaloid long-term potentiaion in Pavlovian fear conditioning, as well as defining the role for the hippocampus in contextual learning and memory.

Around the end of the First World War Francesco came to England and in 1920 he married Maria Stierli, with whom he had a daughter, Maeve, and a son, Niso. ‚ÄúOn 21 September 1920 he played Mendelssohn's First Concerto, and on 9 October of the same year the Busoni transcription of Liszt's Rhapsodie espagnole, a week later making his recital debut at the Wigmore Hall; that programme contained favourite pieces he was still playing 20 years later - Bach's Italian Concerto, Beethoven's 'Waldstein' Sonata, Chopin's Cjt minor Scherzo, Berceuse, Fantasy- Impromptu and Al> Polonaise, and the three of Liszt's Paganini Etudes - Capriccio, La chasse, ‚Ä¶[and] La campanella.‚Äù At the first night of the 1921 Prom season Francesco contributed with the Weber Konzertst√ºck. He performed again on the 25 August and premiered his Poema grego√±ano, \\"a three-movement concerto composed in London at the end of the previous year to show how the Gregorian tones, which look back to the ancient Greeks, could still be used.\\" He continued to play at the Proms for many years to come, performing Beethoven‚Äôs ‚ÄòEmperor‚Äô Concerto, Busoni‚Äôs Liszt transcription, and his own much admired Poema grego√±ano amongst others. For a time he was music director at Teatro dei Piccolo (the famous Marionette company founded by Vittorio Podrecca in 1923). During this period he also made many powerful performances in England, including both as pianist and composer at Robert Newman‚Äôs Promenade Concerts at the Queen‚Äôs Hall, with Sir Henry Wood conducting. In 1927 he formed a trio including the flautist Albert Fransella (1865‚Äì1935) and Leon Goossens (1897‚Äì1988), for whom he composed a concerto that was later conducted by Sir Thomas Beecham in 1929.

It has long been considered a subspecies of the red squirrel (Sciurus vulgaris), but studies published in 2009‚Äì2017 revealed that it is unique in both genetics and appearance, leading to its recognition as a distinct species. The Calabrian black squirrel is an arboreal animal that generally resembles the red squirrel in its behavior. Unlike the highly variable red squirrel, the Calabrian black squirrel is monomorphic (not variable in appearance), being very dark brown to blackish with contrasting white underparts. Compared to red squirrels of northern Italy, the Calabrian black squirrel is also significantly larger, weighing or on average about 35% more. The Calabrian black squirrel lives in mixed forests in highlands, and its nests are often placed in pine or oak trees. It mostly occurs near black pine, as the seeds are an important food source. The northern limit of its range has been northern Pollino, but it is slowly spreading north to the Lucan Apennines (Basilicata region). Its northernmost range limit and the southernmost Italian red squirrel are separated by a gap of more than . The Calabrian black squirrel has a stable population, but its small range means that it likely qualifies for near threatened or perhaps vulnerable. The most serious threat is possibly the Finlayson's squirrel, which has been introduced near its range.

Named by Rigal et al. in 2017 with the description of a second specimen, it contains a single species, S. sagittirostris, which was formerly considered a species of Lonchodectes, L. sagittirostris. In 2020, Averianov suggested it did not belong in Lonchodectidae. The second specimen, BEXHM 2015.18, consists of a small fragment of jaw with three teeth; six complete caudal vertebrae fused together and two fragmentary caudal vertebrae in articulation; a distal left ulna; a right proximal syncarpal; portions of a minimum of three phalanges and two indeterminate elements. Discovery and naming Lithograph of the holotype In 1874, Richard Owen named a pair of lower jaws from the collection of Samuel Husband Beckles, found at St Leonards-on-Sea in Sussex, as a new species of Pterodactylus: Pterodactylus sagittirostris.

Pterosauria.\\" The Palaeontographical Society Monograph 27: 1‚Äì14 In 1888, Edwin Tulley Newton, conforming to the soon to be published pterosaur systematics by Richard Lydekker, renamed the species into Ornithocheirus sagittirostris.Newton, E.

She wrote a number of books about art and spirituality. Family and education Helen Bigelow was the only child of Erastus Brigham Bigelow, an inventor of weaving machinery and founder of the Bigelow Carpet Company. She grew up on a large estate and working farm in North Conway, New Hampshire. Later in life, she used Stonehurst Manor, the family house on this property, as a summer residence; it is now a hotel. She also helped found The Memorial Hospital in North Conway by providing the land and funds necessary to establish the facility. In 1874, she married the Rev. Daniel Merriman, and they had a son, Roger Bigelow Merriman, who became a historian. Worcester Museum Merriman and her husband settled in Worcester, Massachusetts, in 1878, where he served as minister at the Central Congregational Church. She was active in the newly formed Worcester Art Society, giving lectures and contributing works for exhibition from her personal collection of European and American art. She was also involved with the Worcester Art Students Club, which exhibited some of her own paintings. Merriman and her husband were among the founders of the Worcester Art Museum, giving a large donation and serving as trustees and members of the board. Merriman also served on several committees related to the museum's educational mission and helped bring the Boston Impressionist painter Philip Leslie Hale out to the museum to oversee its studio art courses. She led the museum's early efforts to build its collection and lent or donated a number of works including pieces by Pierre Subleyras, Paulus Moreelse, Edmund Tarbell, and Arthur B. Davies. Merriman was a champion of women artists, and it was through her that the museum acquired or exhibited works by Sarah Wyman Whitman and Cecilia Beaux. Merriman stepped down from her positions at the museum in 1922‚Äì23. By the time of her death a decade later, the Worcester Art Museum had evolved into a respected regional museum, in no small part due to Merriman's early efforts on its behalf. Publications Merriman wrote several books about art and spirituality, including What Shall Make Us Whole?: Or, Thoughts in the Direction of Man's Spiritual and Physical Integrity (1888), The Perfect Lord (1891), Concerning Portraits and Portraiture (1891), and Religio Pictoris (1899). Religio Pictoris explores the relationship between art and religion and attempts to demonstrate a fundamental unity between the material and spiritual dimensions of life. Among the subjects discussed in Concerning Portraits and Portraiture is the working process of artist Abbott Thayer, who had painted a portrait of Merriman the year before. Paintings Merriman's portrait of her friend Sarah Wyman Whitman is now in the Schlesinger Library at the Radcliffe Institute for Advanced Study. Other philanthropy Merriman donated land and money to found Memorial Hospital in North Conway, New Hampshire, in 1911. She also served as president of the North Conway Public Library.

As a result most register records include dates and details from the three different processes. In some cases authorities other than councils had governance over localities such as Redevelopment authorities, and they also provided Heritage Inventories in that stage of the process.

The Mitchells Building on Wellington Street was State heritage listed in 2004 but demolished in 2005, with only the facade preserved at another location.

Life Anna Christina Cronquist married in 1830 to Johan Cronquist (d. 1852), editor and publisher of the newspaper Malm√∂ Nya Allehanda in Malm√∂. As the income from the paper was not sufficient to support a family, she gave lessons in weaving: skilled in the art, she published the possibly first instruction book in weaving in Swedish in 1845. Between 1849 and 1865, Cronquist managed a very successful textile shop, which became the biggest in Malm√∂ and reputed in all Scania. She was likely the first married woman in Sweden to have started her own firm rather than to have inherited it, and she was also the first married woman to have started a firm in her own name: A.C. Cronquist & Son, referred to herself and her son. In an age when a married woman was legally a minor under the guardianship of her spouse, this was not an uncomplicated issue; another difficulty was the fact that shops were formally the privilege of the guilds, despite the law of Handelsordningen, which normally only allowed women members if they were widows. Because of these issues, Cronquist were often forced to use a male Strawperson in order to handle her business until she became a widow (and thereby no longer a minor) in 1852. Anna Christina Cronquist made her son Georg Cronquist her business partner in 1862 and retired in 1865, leaving part of the firm to her daughter-in-law and former employee Aqvilina Cronquist.

The schoolhouse on the property was built around 1930, and was the only school for black children of Whigham and the area until segregation was ended in the 1970s. Regular worship at the church ceased in the 1980s; in 2008 the church was being rehabilitated.

The Letterheads meet at least annually for a weekend event to practise and exchange accumulated techniques and skills of the craft.  History  The Letterheads movement originated in the USA in the 1970s and has since spread to a number of countries including Australia, New Zealand, Canada, The UK, The Netherlands and Norway. From original article Letterheads: \\"Originated in Denver, Colorado in 1975 by a group of sign shop apprentices and sign artists; Rick Flores, John Frazier, Bob Mitchell, Mark Oatis, Mike Rielly, Earl Vehill, Mike Author, Joe Tedesco, Jim Schultz. and Noel Weber. The term \\"Letterheads\\" was coined by Earl Vehill. All were unified by an interest in sign design principles and techniques which were no longer taught or valued by most of the contemporary classes, or by the shops in which they worked. Many were understudies of the talented and generous Jerry Albright, and all were acquainted with sign artist Larry Albaugh, in whose studio many early meetings were held. The early gatherings were informal, and consisted of a fair amount of partying, centered around discussions of the sign trade. Sharing, exemplified by Jerry Albright, became the strength of the group. Together with this dedication to sharing and participation was an especial focus upon books and resources, particularly sign instruction and lettering manuals dating to the early 1900s. Throughout the 1970s, meetings were confined to Colorado but membership began to grow. Keith Knecht, out of Ohio, joined early on. Knecht, a well-known signmaker and pinstriper who began his career in 1956, died August 30, 2011, at the age of 71. Hundreds of new members joined during the early 1980s, and the movement took off from there. There was a meeting at Noel's in the summer of 1982 and then Mike Jackson's Oklahoma meet in October of the same year. Raymond Chapman had a Texas gathering in November, 1983. The composition of the seminal group, as well as the timeline of early meetings, is a matter of record within the sign industry, and can be verified by a review of letters and articles published in Signs of the Times and SignCraft magazines. The group now has grown worldwide and numbers in the thousands. The Letterheads traditionally gather for one annual \\"International\\" meet in the US or Canada, as well as 10 or more smaller regional meets throughout, but not limited to, the US, Canada, Australia and the UK. 2005 marked the first meet held in Greece. Meets typically last for several days, and consist of attendees participating in lettering, striping, carving, gold leafing (gilding) and often glass art. Besides the incredible amount of talent and skill demonstrated during these events, it is the free exchange of knowledge and camaraderie amongst people of the same trade that makes these weekends remarkable. The Letterhead mission is to pass on trade \\"secrets\\" and skills through the ages, \\"keeping their craft alive\\" for future generations. With the onset of computers and vinyl films for signmaking, the Letterhead mission of passing down the traditional skills is more important today than ever before.\\"  Annual Meetings  = 1994 Wagga Wagga NSW = John Rigby hosted the event = 1995 Jindabyne NSW = = 1996 Canberra ACT = = 1997 Maitland NSW = = Jondaryan, Qld. = = Clare Valley, SA = = 2013 Eugowra NSW = The 2013 Letterheads meeting in Eugowra was held on the same weekend as the Eugowra Most Wanted Mural Meet which is also an annual event.

Vegetable bouquets are often considered as an alternative to flower bouquets. Vegetable bouquets can be handheld or can be used for the interior decoration. They are often given as a gift for special occasions such as birthdays, anniversaries, or romantic dates. They are also occasionally used in weddings. Vegetable bouquets that contain fruit, flowers and other vegetation in addition to vegetables are commonly referred to as vegebouquets. A contemporary vegetable bouquet made of chili pepper and broccoli  History  The idea of creating beautiful arrangements of vegetables before consuming them is not new. Consider, for example, how George Sala describes a sophisticated housekeeper in the 19th century London: \\"She would be just the person for the upper end of Sloane Street. She has a neat hand for cutting vegetable bouquets out of carrots, turnips and parsnips for garnishing.\\" Since the 20th century, numerous attempts have been made to use vegetable bouquets to promote a healthy lifestyle and raise the nutrition consciousness of the population. Nowadays, the art of creating vegetable bouquets is much more accessible with numerous online courses available for vegetable bouquet designers.  Wedding vegetable bouquets  In recent years, vegetable bouquets have gained some popularity as an alternative to traditional flower bouquets in weddings. Kale, broccoli, and artichokes are becoming increasingly popular in wedding vegetable bouquets.  Comparison to flower bouquets  Most of the ingredients of a vegetable bouquet can be consumed after dismantling the bouquet as opposed to flower bouquets which ingredients can be either thrown away, dried, or used as a compost. Some companies offer completely zero-waste versions of vegetable bouquets so that all of the ingredients can be consumed or re-used. Similar to flowers, vegetable bouquets can be arranged to form a wreath. Vegetable bouquets are usually heavier than flower bouquets, which makes it difficult to handhold them for longer periods of time.

It has a single erect, hairy leaf and one or two white flowers with very pale reddish lines and black tips. Description Caladenia saggicola is a terrestrial, perennial, deciduous, herb with an underground tuber and a single erect, hairy leaf, long and wide. One or two flowers wide are borne on a stalk tall. The flowers are white with very pale reddish lines and the sepals and petals have long, grey to blackish, thread- like tips. The dorsal sepal is long and wide with a long, drooping tip. The lateral sepals are long and wide and spreading widely but with drooping tips. The petals are long and wide and arranged like the lateral sepals. The labellum is long, wide and white to cream-coloured. The sides of the labellum have teeth up to long, the tip of the labellum is curled under and there are four or six rows of calli up to long, along the mid-line of the labellum. Flowering occurs from September to October. Taxonomy and naming Caladenia saggicola was first described in 1998 by David Jones from a specimen collected near Cambridge and the description was published in Australian Orchid Research. The specific epithet (saggicola) is a reference to the common name \\"\\" sometimes given to Lomatia longifolia which often forms a dense understorey with this orchid. Distribution and habitat The sagg spider orchid is only found near Cambridge and Dodges Ferry where it grows in open woodland with a dense understory of Lomandra longifolia tussocks. Conservation Caladenia saggicola is classified as \\"critically endangered\\" under the Commonwealth Government Environment Protection and Biodiversity Conservation Act 1999 (EPBC) Act. Only about 450 individual plants are known to survive near Cambridge and three near Dodges Ferry. The main threat to the species is nearby development. Both populations occur on private land; the main habitat is carefully preserved however. Unfavourable fire regimes/uncontrolled bushfire, drought and grazing by rabbits are also threats to the species, although the main habitat is very carefully managed and monitored, and part is in a rabbit-proof fenced area.

He is regarded as one of the most important representatives of classicism in Mecklenburg.  Life  Severin was born the first child of the government and consistory council Theodor Severin (born 1733) and his wife Christina Eleonore Henrietta Becker (born 1744). Nothing is known about his education as an architect. From 1789 onward, he was based in Mecklenburg. In 1795, he was hired as the to the construction manager of Doberan, who was at that time . Severin was to assist him until his retirement in 1796. Since Seydewitz stayed in the office for a longer period than expected, Severin first became a chamber engineer in 1795 without a salary at the Schweriner Kammerkollegium, and in November 1795 he was given the position of \\"bauconducteur to the local court and town buildings\\". In 1799, he rebuilt the , which had been owned by the von Schack family for only a few years.Herrenh√§user in Westmecklenburg: Rittergut Nustrow bei kulturrreise- ideen.de. In 1801, Severin planned out for the first time during the construction work for the summer residency of the ducal [from 1815: Gro√üherzoglichen] Sommeritzitz at Heiligendamm. Together with Seydewitz, the salon building at the Kamp was built. Through this work, Friedrich Franz I drew attention to him and entrusted Severin with extensive work to expand the seaside resort of Heiligendamm and to redesign the village of Doberan. In 1803, Severin built a sanctuary in Heiligendamm and a cultivation of the bathhouse, the conversation round in 1804 and the view tower in 1807. Nearly all of these buildings are no longer preserved. His first buildings in Doberan included the theater, which he built in 1805. From 1806 to 1809, his repertoire was followed the ducal palace and 1808 a pavilion at the Kamp. In April 1809, Severin was appointed as land architect. He was thus responsible for the offices of Buckow, Doberan, Ribnitz, R√ºhn, and Schwaan. The focus of his work continued to be the expansion of Heiligendamm and Doberan, which is why he moved to Doberan in 1810 and built a house. In the same year he married Marie Eleanore Magdalena Bollow (born 1783). The couple had three daughters and two sons. Kurhaus Heiligendamm, 2007 Albeit with some difficulties, from 1810 to 1813 at the Kamp, several pavilions were built there, particularly the Gro√üe Pavillon as a music pavilion. In 1814, Severin was commissioned to build a representative building as a social, dance and dining house in Heiligendamm. Today, this building, completed in 1817, is the Kurhaus Heilingendamm and currently a part of a hotel complex. Carl Theodor Severin was appointed Oberland builder in March 1819. His last works in Doberan included cultivation at the salon building at Kamp from 1819 to 1821 and the steel bath, which was completed in 1825. The house of Severin, which was situated south of the Kamp, was exchanged for the Duke of Mecklenburg-Schwerin, Friedrich Franz Is wish to erect a palace for the heir prince, against a piece of land directly opposite the same road, and erected a palatial, representative building there in 1823-1824. This house is now called Gottesfrieden. A major element of Severin's design and architecture was the exotic motifs of Chinese architecture. It is thanks to him that Bad Doberan today is one of the few places in Germany today with a uniform neoclassicism style to its architecture. In 1822, he built the new building of the mansion in K√∂rchow. He also built the house of Italian-born restaurateur Gaetano Medini. In 1835, he retired, and in 1836, died in Doberan.

The song has been adapted into two music videos. The official video was released by BBNG in November 2016. The American rapper Snoop Dogg added lyrics to the song and released the \\"Nightfall Remix\\" version in 2017. The music video to this version caused some controversy because of a scene depicting a mock assassination of U.S. President Donald Trump. Background and release BBNG made the original version of the track with Kaytranada in their home studio in Toronto. In an email to The Fader, BBNG described the process of making the song. \\"Kay started the idea as a beat with our drum breaks and some synth melodies. Then we recut the drums and synth to formulate a song with more sections.\\" In an interview with PopMatters in August 2016, Chester Hansen of BBNG said the band liked Kay's drum breaks and synth ideas and that the band \\"thought it would sound cool in context with the Ghost stuff we were working on so we took that and reworked it and then next time Kay was in town we worked on it again. It took about three or four different stages, and it was really this winter [when we completed it].\\" The song was initially released on the album IV July 8, 2016. BBNG performed a rendition of \\"Lavender\\" on the Australian radio station Triple J during a Like a Version segment December 9, 2016. Reception Michelle Geslani, writing in Consequence of Sound, described the song as \\"a true hybrid of both BadBadNotGood and Kaytranada, highlighted by woozy, jazzy bits and synths that tend to growl and glow.\\" Jamieson Cox of The Verge praised Kaytranada's performance in the song writing. \\"It's tough to discern Kay's presence on this one, and that's a compliment ‚Äî he seamlessly slots into the band's spacey, roiling jazz-funk.\\" Official music video BBNG released their official music video for \\"Lavender\\" via YouTube November 16, 2016. The video was directed by Fantavious Fritz and features BBNG band members playing a realistic game of Dungeons & Dragons. The video begins with the BBNG band members looking at an advertisement on a telephone pole for a game of Dungeons & Dragons. When they get to the address on the flyer, the owner of the house locks them in his garage and forces them to play a game of D&D.; While playing the game, Kaytranada appears as a holographic game piece to help the band members in their quest. During the game, the Dungeon Master who locked the band members in his garage walks outside to answer a phone call. While he is outside, one of the band members slips poison into the Dungeon Master's drink. When the DM returns, he takes a drink from his cup and hands the band members a gun, trying to force them to play a game of Russian roulette. Before the game of Russian Roulette can start, the DM dies from the poison. The music video ends with an advertisement for a Dungeon Master named John Dempsey located in the Greater Toronto Area. The video was one of the top ten finalists for the 2017 Prism Prize. Snoop Dogg remix Snoop Dogg released a remix of \\"Lavender\\" titled \\"Lavender (Nightfall Remix)\\" with a music video on March 12, 2017. The beginning of the video shows a clown family and follows the father (played by Michael Rapaport), who smokes weed while stressed. After the father encounters a clown policeman, he is shot dead with a glitter gun while a bystander films the incident. The video cuts to \\"The Clown House\\", where Ronald Klump, a clown parody version of Donald Trump, holds a press conference concerning the deportation of all \\"doggs\\". In the video, Snoop Dogg sees Klump and his henchmen outside, and then grabs a gun and aims it at Klump. He pulls the trigger and a flag with the word \\"bang\\" pops out. Klump is later seen in chains. The song was included in Snoop's album Neva Left, released on May 19, 2017. Conservative politicians and commentators criticized the video's mock assassination of Ronald Klump, a parody of Donald Trump.

Career Barlow graduated with a BSc in Zoology from the University of Southampton in 1974, continuing on to study a PhD in Physiology and Biochemistry at the School of Biomedical Sciences on the Boldrewood Campus. His doctoral studies were focused on cilia flagella, and research on brine and fairy shrimps. Barlow's first film work was on David Attenborough's landmark 1978 nature series Life on Earth, filming microscoping single-cell pond organisms. However, he was also working on projects for the National Health Service and others, and in 1983 he was commissioned to provide specialist microscopic biomedical photography for a Channel 4 series, The Living Body. Barlow subsequently provided similar photographic work for shows including Horizon and Equinox, as well as working on the BBC's 1998 series The Human Body, for which Barlow received a BAFTA nomination for Best Photography (Factual). Barlow later helped convert this show to IMAX for the Discovery Channel. Other TV work included the BBC's Fight for Life (2007), and Channel 4's Extraordinary Animals in the Womb, about animals with unusual birth procedures, which Barlow recreated using silicon models and computer-aided graphics, and edited together with images captured on 35mm film via a microscope. In September 2008 Barlow was awarded an Emmy Award for Outstanding Individual Achievement in a Craft by the National Academy of Television Arts and Sciences for his photographic sequences featured in National Geographic's Inside the Living Body. Due to other work commitments, Barlow was unable to collect the award in person, so his co-nominee Steve Gomez, responsible for computer animation on the project, collected the award on his behalf.

Modena Weston (also referred to by her maiden name, Modena McColl; August 3, 1816 in Albany, New York - November 25, 1898 in Bay St. Louis, Mississippi) was a nurse for the Union during the American Civil War. Nursing career  She enlisted in military service as a nurse in Iowa on September 1, 1861. Her service began with the 3rd Iowa Infantry Hospital. She quickly became a mother to the regiment, working to quell the numerous outbreaks of measles and smallpox. Weston moved to the Benton Barracks, where she was the only woman serving but the station had an adequate supply of sanitary goods. Conditions would not be as good as she moved with the regiment to Mexico, Missouri. Here she established a field hospital where the staff would remain as the regiment moved about. At this location, the water supply was poor and often contributed to further illness. In a letter to Mary Holland, the most noteworthy moment of Weston's service was during the Battle of Shiloh. Here, in addition to the regiment, Weston cared for the wounded crew of a steamship after the battle. From this location, Weston once again moved to River Landing. Here she cared for hundreds of wounded individuals. Once again, at this location, Weston was the only woman serving. Much like her prior experience, supplies were short and Weston had to request food, and only received supplies after a few days of duty. Weston describes in her letter four women joining her in service, but she was soon once again the only woman as the others were wounded and left. Weston remained at this location until September when the hospital was broken up; after, she served at Jackson until March 1863 only to travel again to Memphis then to Washington, D.C. On April 20, 1863, Weston received a commission from Dorothea Dix, and in January 1864 reported to J.D. Erwin to be sent to serve as a matron at a small pox hospital. Weston finished her military service at this location in October 1866. She was never paid for her service.

First projects  Mariotti was born in Bern in 1943 and moved to Peru in 1952. He then studied at the Art University of Hamburg between 1965 and 1968. After graduation, he was chosen by the \\"Project Geldmacher ‚Äì Mariotti\\" to participate in an interactive art installation for the Fourth Documenta in Kassel.http://www.mariotti.ch/en/expositions/1968/p/ He exhibited \\"The Circular Movement of Light\\" for the 1969 X S√£o Paulo Biennial.https://www.researchgate.net/publication/317640141_Mariotti's_ritual_artefacts_and_the_origins_of_media_art_In_search_of_the_lost_multisensorial_characteristics_of_new_media  Period in Peru  In 1971 Mariotti moved back to Peru. During that period he was approached by Alfonso Castrillon, who at that time was the Director of the Institute of Contemporary Art (located at the Italian Art Museum), who invited him for a solo show. Mariotti proposed Castrillon a different idea: to develop open the game by calling artists and cross-cutting creative agents in a sort of festival, which challenged all categories and hierarchies. Mariotti organised Contacta 71, total art festival whose results were so successful that it was organised for a second year with the support of the military junta. Then Mariotti is hired by the Government to work for the National System of Social Mobilization (SINAMOS). Mariotti and Mar√≠a Luy, his partner, were absorbed by the promises of a revolution Andean, and moved in September 1972 to Cusco and Puno, where they develop art and communication projects in popular sectors, which includes the socialization of serigraphic techniques among the peasant population. The first event he organised was the Homage to the 3rd of October (the day of the revolution), a massive popular parade in the main plaza of Cuzco. He then developed the Hatariy (November 1972, organised in collaboration with the House of Culture - INC) and Inkarri (1973 and 1974) Festivals in Cuzco. SINAMOS decided to establish Inkarri as a nationwide popular festival and a final competition that took place at the Campo de Marte. In 1976 he created a course \\"Conception and development of projects of art and communication\\" (\\"Concepci√≥n y desarrollo de proyectos de arte y comunicaci√≥n\\") at the National School of Fine Arts in Lima, being the first time such a course is given in the country. The success was limited, only three students were registered, which evinced the conservative environment at that time. During the late seventies, when the military junta was over, he returns to Lima and starts Huayco E.P.S (the acronym for \\"Aesthetics of Social Projection\\"), created as a creative cooperative studio.Buntinx, G. (2005). E.P.S. Huayco : documentos. Lima: Centro Cultural de Espa√±a en Lima.  Return to Europe  The eighties provided a very complex and uncertain panorama in Peru and Mariotti along with his family decided to move back Switzerland. From 1981 to 1986 he collaborated with Rinaldo Bianda at the Fabiana Gallery and in the VideoArt Festival of Locarno, becoming the General Secretary of the festival (1982 - 1987). In 1987 he moved to Zurich, where he lives today, undertaking systematic work linked to the creation of lighting and kinetic sculptures, which consisted of metallic structures (usually of industrial materials) to which were added circuits, sensors and computers, creating hybrid sculptures that create the perception of being alive (some recite poetry, others speak, etc.). He was one of the first artists to work intensively with LED before it became mainstream.Mari√°tegui, J.-C. (2017). Mariotti‚Äôs Ritual Artefacts and the Origins of Media Art.

Proceedings of the 23rd International Symposium on Electronic Arts., Manizales. His work was part of an exploration to analyze nature through oral traditions and Andean and Amazonian myths, to confrontation, in the late 90s, natural and ecological contexts, producing its first hybrid gardens and quantum gardens and developing renaturalization projects in collaboration with scientists and activists.Buntinx, G.

In the former competition, she played for Queensland Fire from 2011 to 2020, when she was signed to play for New South Wales Breakers in 2020‚Äì21. In the latter competition, she has played for Brisbane Heat since the first season of the competition in 2015‚Äì16. Early life and career From Lismore in New South Wales, Johnson attended Blue Hills College, Goonellabah. She started playing cricket at the age of 12, after having watched it since she \\"was a little kid\\". As a young cricketer, she was inspired by Brett Lee, and sometimes, after taking a wicket, she would emulate him by jumping in the air or doing \\"the chainsaw\\". By the 2007‚Äì08 season, Johnson was regularly playing as the opening bowler for Clunes boys Under-16s team on Saturday mornings, and then for the Easts third grade men's team on Saturday afternoons. In February 2008, she was selected in the all-girls NSW Combined Independent Schools team, which, under the captaincy of Ellyse Perry, competed in the NSW Schoolgirls Championship the following month. Subsequently, Johnson was named in the NSW Under-16 girls All Schools team and the NSW Under-17 and Under-19 girls squads, and attended training with the Australian Under-18 girls talent squad. Adam Gilchrist scholarship In 2010, Johnson became the second female player to receive the Adam Gilchrist scholarship, through which she travelled to the UK to play for five months for the Cumbria Women cricket team in the north of England. She was selected to play in the County Firsts and Northern Leagues Firsts teams, helped coach Under-10 and Under-13 county teams, and also attended school-based programs and holiday camps. Soon after arriving in England, playing for Cumbria in a match against a leading junior boys representative side, Johnson took 3-22 from eight overs, and then recorded her first ever century, by scoring 110 in her team‚Äôs total of 173. Over the five months of her scholarship, she had much success, taking took more than 60 wickets, and compiling just under 1,000 runs. At about that time, however, she was told that there was no place for her in the star-studded NSW Breakers senior team. Senior domestic career In the spring of 2011, Johnson was encouraged by Queensland Fire coach Andy Richards to become involved in Brisbane Grade cricket, with a view to winning Fire selection. Just three weeks after joining the Western Suburbs grade team, and at the age of 19 years, Johnson was selected to debut for the Fire in a Twenty20 match against the ACT Meteors. The match ended in a tie, with Johnson taking 1-18 off three overs; when the scores were still level after a super over, Queensland eventually won on a countback. In Johnson's next T20 match, also against the Meteors, she bagged 3-9 off four overs. Later that season, in a match against the NSW Breakers that proved to be Johnson's season's highlight, she dismissed internationals Alyssa Healy, Alex Blackwell and Lisa Sthalekar in the space of two overs, and recorded the figures of 3-14 over four overs, as the Breakers made a record-low 9-82. Johnson finished the 2011‚Äì12 T20 season with 10 wickets from eight matches at 12.50 and an economy rate of 5.43. In the Fire's one day campaign, she bowled 18 overs in four matches and took a combined 2-76, with a best performance of 2-28 off eight overs against the South Australian Scorpions. Johnson has been a member of the Brisbane Heat squad since its inaugural WBBL01 season (2015‚Äì16). In November 2018, she was named in Brisbane Heat's squad for the 2018‚Äì19 Women's Big Bash League season.

Although the band had played a few shows together previously, they made their first performance under the Shining moniker on August 13, 2014 on The Tonight Show Starring Jimmy Fallon. The Shining also performed as one of the final musical acts on Late Show with David Letterman. History Adams started the band after he and guitarist Mike Viola co- produced his self-titled record Ryan Adams record together. Adams had known bassist Charlie Stavish since 2006 as an engineer who had worked on many of his records. He first met Viola and keyboardist Daniel Clarke when touring with his ex-wife Mandy Moore. Drummer Freddie Bokkenheuser completed the band after an audition. Compared to his previous band, The Cardinals, Adams expressed a preference for going into the \\"exploration zone\\" with the Shining on his older songs and that rehearsals with the new band were a \\"very beautiful process\\". In a 2014 concert review, the Village Voice noted that \\"the Shining bring a slightly garage-ier take on early '80s classic rock, like Springsteen or Tom Petty, with that reliable Adams reference of a bit of Paul Westerberg raggedness\\". In a 2016 review of the Shining, Ben Kaye from Consequence of Sound marvelled at \\"...how in sync they all are. Not only do they provide glorious harmonies and ripping solos of their own, but they give Adams every bit of the platform a true bandleader needs.\\" In reflecting further on the chemistry of the band, Fred Schruers from Billboard Magazine wrote in another review: \\"When the band took off on disciplined-if-deeply committed jams, Adams was just as likely to start trading phrases with keyboardist Daniel Clarke as with guitarist Viola, and the rhythm section of bassist Charlie Stavish and drummer Freddy Bokkenheuser (the latter with a woodchopper's hammering energy) seemed to enjoy the musical interplay, and their bandleader's japes, as much as anyone on the entire hillside.\\" In addition to extensive touring to support Adams' self-titled album, Adams and Stavish also continued to collaborate on recording projects, including 7\\" releases for Adams and solo EP's for Shining band members Viola and Clarke. And, by fall of 2016, the band began to work on and debut live new material for Adams' next record. The group ultimately headed into Adams' PAX AM recording studio to attempt recording as a band. They made progress on the track \\"Do You Still Love Me\\", which would eventually appear on Adams' next Album Prisoner. However, Adams otherwise felt that the band had lost \\"some of the magic\\" that they had experienced together on tour. He subsequently focused on recording the rest of the new album himself and put together a new band, only including Stavish on bass, to support the new record.

During Operation Barbarossa, it was subordinated to the Schutzstaffel (SS) and deployed in German-occupied territories, specifically the Army Group South Rear Area. In July 1942, its three constituent battalions were redesignated as the 10th Police Regiment. Alongside the Einsatzgruppen detachments and the 1st SS Infantry Brigade, it perpetrated mass murder in the Holocaust and was responsible for large-scale crimes against humanity targeting the civilian population. The scope of the regiment's operations was known to British intelligence from August 1941, but for reasons of national security these materials were not released until 1993. Background and formation The German Order Police (Ordnungspolizei) was a key instrument of the security apparatus of Nazi Germany. In the prewar period, Heinrich Himmler, the head of the SS, and Kurt Daluege, chief of the Order Police, cooperated in transforming the police force of the Weimar Republic into militarised formations ready to serve the regime's aims of conquest and racial annihilation. Order police units participated in the annexation of Austria and the occupation of Czechoslovakia. Police troops were first formed into battalion-sized formations for the invasion of Poland, where they were deployed for security and policing purposes, also taking part in executions and mass deportations. Twenty three Order Police battalions were slated to take part in the 1941 invasion of the Soviet Union, known as Operation Barbarossa. Nine were attached to security divisions of the Wehrmacht, three for each Army Group Rear Area. Two battalions were assigned to support the Einsatzgruppen, the mobile death squads of the SS, and the Organisation Todt, the military construction group. Twelve were formed into regiments, of three battalions each, and designated as Police Regiments South, North, Centre, and Special Purpose. Police units assigned to the Wehrmacht security divisions and the Einsatzgruppen were motorised, while those formed into regiments were not. The goals of the police battalions were to secure the German army's rear-area by eliminating the remnants of enemy forces, guarding prisoners of war, and protecting lines of communications and captured industrial facilities. Their instructions also included, as Daluege stated, the \\"combat of criminal elements, above all political elements\\". Police Regiment South was formed in June 1941 by combining Police Battalions45, 303, and 314 under the command of Hermann Franz, a career policeman who had previously served in the Order Police in occupied Poland. The battalions were led by career police professionals, steeped in the ideology of Nazism, driven by anti-semitism and anti-Bolshevism. When it crossed the German-Soviet border the regiment came under the control of Friedrich Jeckeln, the Higher SS and Police Leader (HSS- PF) for Army Group South in Ukraine. Operational history =Early killing operations= Upon formation, while still in occupied Poland, Police Battalion314 participated in round-ups of Polish civilians for deportation to slave labour in Germany. The regiment's actions quickly escalated to genocide when in the occupied Soviet Union. It began executing Jewish women and children in July 1941. On 22July, Police Battalion 314 killed 214 Jews in a settlement near Kovel, including entire families. Police Regiment45 murdered the entire Jewish population of Shepetovka while stationed there between 26July and 1August. The orders came down from the regimental commander, who was acting on orders from Heinrich Himmler. During the summer months, the battalion took part in joint actions with the 1st SS Infantry Brigade of the Waffen-SS, both providing support and undertaking independent killings. The brigade's report of 19August to the Command Staff Reichsf√ºhrer-SS (SS operational staff set up for the invasion) noted that Police Battalion314 had executed 25 Jews and 16 Ukrainians. The same report noted that Police Battalions 45 and 303 and the SS brigade jointly participated in \\"combat of gangs\\". The 22August report stated that Police Battalion 314 shot 3 \\"partisan women\\", 19 \\"bandits\\", and 537 Jews.. The 21August report detailed the battalion's killing of 367 Jews in a \\"cleansing action\\" while securing German supply lines, while the 22August report noted that the unit executed 28 Ukrainians on charges of \\"arson\\". In the last week of August the battalion killed a further 294 Jews. =Escalation of violence= During August, the regiment murdered Jews in Slavuta, Kovel and other areas, often killing hundreds of victims per battalion per day. On 25August, it murdered 1,153 Jews, while on 27August, it killed 914 more. In September, Police Battalion45 participated in the murder of Jews in Berdichev, cordoning off the execution site and leading the victims to pits where they were shot by Jeckeln's staff company. About 16,000 Jews were killed. In late September, Police Battalions45 and 314 assisted Einsatzkommando 6 in murdering 10,000 Jews in Vinnitsa. During the massacre at Babi Yar on 29‚Äì30September 1941, the personnel of Police Battalion45 cordoned off the area, while Sondercommando4a and a platoon of Waffen-SS men did the shooting. Police Battalion 303 participated in the massacre as well. =Later history= The killing activities of both the Einsatzgruppen detachments and the Police Regiment South slowed down the farther the Wehrmacht advanced, as more Jews were able to escape east and the density of the pre-war Jewish population was lower in Eastern Ukraine. Nonetheless, the murder operations continued, targeting Jews, communists and \\"suspicious elements\\". In July 1942 the regiment was redesignated as the 10th Police Regiment. Decrypts by British intelligence While the activities of the Police Regiment South, the Einsatzgruppen detachment, and the 1st SS Brigade progressed, the reports by the murder squads were being intercepted and decoded by MI6, the British intelligence service. As part of Ultra, a British signals intelligence program, the codebreaking facilities at Bletchley Park decoded and analysed the messages. The head of MI6, Stewart Menzies, communicated the decrypts directly to the British Prime Minister Winston Churchill. The first message decrypted was the 18July report on the mass murders by Police Regiment Centre of over 1,100 Jews at Slonim, in the Army Group Centre Rear Area. In late July and early August, similar reports were intercepted on a regular basis. The first messages mentioning the murders by Police Regiment South were intercepted on August23, with Police Battalion314 reporting executions of 367 Jews south-east of Kiev. Apparently angered by the scope of the atrocities, Churchill delivered a speech over the radio on August24, where he stated: > Whole districts are being exterminated... Scores of thousands of executions > are perpetrated by the German police troops upon the Soviet patriots > defending their native soil. Since the Mongol invasion of Europe, there have > never been methodical, merciless butchery on such a scale or approaching > such a scale. We are in the presence of a crime without a name. Starting on 27August, Bletchley Park delivered specially prepared intelligence reports on the activities of the police troops. By this point, the British intelligence had detailed information on the activities of police troops in both Army Group South and Army Group Centre rear areas. On 12September, the Order Police changed their cipher; the following day, SS officials were instructed to stop transmitting their reports over the radio. Aftermath The Order Police as a whole had not been declared a criminal organisation by the Allies, unlike the SS. Its members were able to reintegrate into German society largely unmolested, with many returning to police careers in Austria and West Germany. Members of Police Battalion 314 were investigated by the Austrian authorities, with at least two former members providing testimony on the mass killings of Jews. One former member testified that the killing method changed from using sidearms and carbines to machine guns since the former was deemed \\"too tedious\\". For reasons of national security, the Ultra program remained classified after the war and the decrypts pertaining to the activities of security and police troops during the war were not shared with Britain's allies. Consequently, they were not used during the Nuremberg trials or subsequent investigations of German war crimes and crimes against humanity. The decrypts were finally released in 1993.

Data extracted from the There is interest in using M. neglectum for the production of biofuels because it can accumulate large quantities (up to 33 % of cell dry weight) of triacylglycerides (TAGs). In 2013, a draft nuclear, mitochondrial, and chloroplast genome was published with an estimated nuclear size of 68 Mb and approximately 16,761 genes. The nuclear genome is likely diploid. The mitochondrial genome of M. neglectum is 96 kb, which is twice as large as Nannochloropsis gaditana and nearly six times larger than the green alga Chlamydomonas reinhardtii, but contains fewer genes. A nuclear transformation technique has been established for M. neglectum using electrotransformation as the method of DNA delivery. The strategy described in this study, including a pretreatment step to weaken the cell wall, might inspire future studies with other microalgae also aiming at stable nuclear genetic transformation using electrotransformation. The transcriptome of M. neglectum has been sequenced using Illumina HiSeq technology. Using a poly-A fishing and genome-guided approach, the transcriptome was assembled into 20,751 genes (i. e., loci). The dataset encompasses a time-course experiment under conditions of both, high TAG accumulation and subsequent TAG degradation. TAG accumulation and degradation were induced by nitrogen removal (-N conditions) and nitrogen resupply (NR conditions). In total, the transcriptome was sequenced at 12 time points (t0, 7x -N, 4x NR), yielding a comprehensive and high-quality dataset. The raw data (100 nt paired-end reads) has been deposited at SRA under the SRA Study accession number SRP112537. The processed data is available at http://tdbmn.cebitec.uni-bielefeld.de, at which direct gene and BLAST search enable for data mining and to investigate the expression patterns of target genes under autotrophic -N and NR conditions. It is furthermore possible to compare the expression patterns of target genes of M. neglectum with those of other microalgae which were also subjected to -N conditions to induce TAG accumulation.

Disappearance Stacie Madison worked as a receptionist and had plans of studying business at the University of North Texas. On the evening of March 19, 1988, her good friend, Susan Smalley, was staying overnight at her house. The pair left the house together for a short while in Madison's 1967 Ford Mustang convertible, a car that was painted in the emblematic colors of their high school and that Madison had recently bought with the earnings from her two jobs. Later, the girls were seen attempting to purchase alcohol at a 7-Eleven, but the clerk did not sell it to them since they were minors. Madison and Smalley returned to the house, where Madison phoned a friend at around midnight. The girls left the house again shortly after the call, with Madison's car no longer to be seen parked in front of the house where the girls were staying. The last time anyone saw the girls, they were at The Steak and Ale, the same restaurant where Smalley worked as a waitress. An employee at the establishment told investigators that Smalley had been talking to another co-worker while Madison waited for her in the parked car. Smalley and Madison were reported missing the next morning. The Mustang that they had been driving the previous night was found abandoned in the parking lot of a Dallas shopping center, together with personal belongings of both girls inside. When last seen, Madison was wearing white cotton pants and a white long-sleeved sweatshirt with a logo of pink and orange and white tennis shoes; Smalley was wearing a white sweater and blue jeans and was carrying a shoulder bag of navy blue with camel trim as well. Investigation and aftermath Several months after the two friends went missing, Smalley's last boyfriend confessed to a girl whom he was dating that he had killed Smalley and Madison by his own hand and then dumped their bodies in a local cemetery. After the girl shared this with police, Smalley's boyfriend underwent and passed a polygraph. He later relocated to Florida, moving from town to town in that state for over a decade and with attempts to contact him proving unsuccessful. For lack of better avenues to pursue in the case, detectives once consulted a psychic, only to be told that the girls were murdered by a blond-haired white male with glasses who was between 28 and 34 years old and who had dumped them near Grapevine Lake. However, a search of that area failed to turn up anything of value. The Susan Smalley and Stacie Madison case is still active. In 2009, a book entitled This Night Wounds Time: The Mysterious Disappearances of Stacie Madison and Susan Smalley was self-published by Shawn Sutherland who grew up in Carrollton and was twenty-four when the girls mysteriously vanished. According to Sergeant Joel Payne, who is the lead detective with Carrollton police, the book caused the investigation to be renewed \\"start[ing] from scratch\\" not only in Carrollton but in neighboring Denton County as well.

In August 1968, the Red Leaves swept 7-0 to beat an all-star youth team from Japan. This win is commonly cited as the starting point of baseball fever in Taiwan, resulting in the win of the Taichung Golden Dragons the following year at the 1969 Little League World Series in South Williamsport, Pennsylvania and culminating in Taiwan's continued successes at the Little League World Series. There is a museum in Taitung dedicated to the Red Leaves. Overview In 1963, the principal of the school found that there were high rates of truancy, attributable to the fact that students were spending time outside. These students had a particular passion for baseball. As a result, the idea was put forth to have a baseball team. The team is most noted for its 1968 win. Demographically, the 1968 team was composed entirely of people of Taiwanese aborigine descent, and the village, in rural Taitung, was similarly composed. The team's story is usually regarded as an underdog success story, with \\"colonized\\" Taiwan winning over the \\"colonizer\\" Japan. Adding to this was the fact that the team's championship run almost ended when they announced they were too poor to attend a match in Taipei. They had defeated a team from Chiayi, but announced they would not be moving to the next stage. Donations allowed them to travel. After winning the championship of the league, they played the fateful friendly exhibition series against the team from Japan and won decisively. Myths and controversies One controversy was the use of substitute, over-age players. The Little League carried out its own investigations and could find no evidence of this. Though there were regulations that were not followed, these regulations were not evenly applied for the international partners of the Little League, which meant that though Taiwan reorganized its domestic baseball rules to better meet these regulations, no real penalty was applied. No serious fallout occurred for the players and serious accusations were generally considered groundless. In 1969, a coach and team leader were indicted by the Taitung District Court for using counterfeit documents. Though this had no bearing on prior wins and on the team itself, it did mar the reputation of the team and the reputation of Taiwanese baseball. An enduring myth is that the team that played the Red Leaves was the championship team from Wakayama. This is not true. Though the team the Red Leaves played was in fact from Wakayama, the team they defeated were not the players that were the champions, but another team from Wakayama. Another unverified part of the story was that the team was so impoverished they could barely afford shoes, played with sticks and peach pits, and that the catcher could not even afford to buy a mask. These stories were widely reported at the time in the United Daily News and other domestic (and sometimes, international) media, though they were likely exaggerated. These narratives, however, have become an enduring part of the story of the Red Leaves. Outcomes The win sparked an island-wide baseball craze, and cemented baseball as a part of Taiwan's national consciousness. In fact, future winners of the Little League World Series would be treated like heroes upon their return, with grand parades in celebration. The Taichung Golden Dragons in 1969 were even asked to meet with Chiang Kai-shek. At this time, there was no professional baseball league in Taiwan, so players generally found employ through Japanese baseball teams or through other avenues.

She is known for her work with stable isotope geochemistry, studying ancient climate, animal behavior, ecology, and astrobiology. Fogel has also served in many leadership roles, including Program Director at the National Science Foundation in geobiology and low-temperature geochemistry. She was the second female member of the Geophysical Laboratory and the first woman recipient of the Alfred Treibs Medal from the Geochemical Society for her work in organic geochemistry.  Early life  Fogel was born on September 19, 1952 in Moorestown, New Jersey. Penn State In 1970 she enrolled at Penn State, where she majored in biology. Fogel graduated from Penn State in 1973 with a BS in biology with honors. Her research mentor, Given, helped her apply to UT-Austin for graduate school. She decided to take a gap year before starting grad school to travel Europe and start a jewelry business making pins.  Academic career  At UT-Austin, Fogel worked with Drs. Chase Van Baalen, Patrick Parker, and F. Robert Tabita on her dissertation, titled ‚ÄúCarbon isotope fractionation by ribulose 1,5-biphosphate carboxylase from various organisms‚Äù. While in graduate school, she owned an ice cream truck to help cover expenses. She graduated in 1977 with a PhD in Botany and Marine Sciences, before continuing on to a postdoc at the Geophysical Lab at the Carnegie Institution of Washington from 1977-1979 under Dr. Thomas C. Hoering. Following her postdoc position, Fogel became a staff member at the Geophysical Lab in 1979 working in biogeochemistry, where she remained until 2012. She was only the second female staff member at the Geophysical Lab. While there, Fogel became a visiting scientist at Carnegie's Department of Plant Biology (1985-1986), a visiting professor at the Department of Earth Sciences at Dartmouth College (1995), a visiting professor at the Department of Geology at the University of Maryland (2003-2005), and a Smithsonian Environmental Research Center Fellow (2003-2009). In 2012, she made the move from Carnegie in Washington DC to UC Merced in Merced, California to become a Professor in the School of Natural Sciences as well as the Chair of the Life and Environmental Sciences Unit. There, she taught courses on the fundamentals of ecology, biogeochemistry, stable isotope ecology, field ecology, and the anthropocene. In 2016, she moved to UC Riverside in Riverside, California, where she now resides as a Professor of Geo-ecology in the Earth and Environmental Sciences Department, and the Director of the EDGE (Environmental Dynamics & Geo-Ecology) Institute. Her research focuses on geo-ecology. = Research = Stable isotope ratios vary as a result of many biological and abiotic processes in the environment, changing over time, location, organism, and environment. The field of isotope geochemistry largely relies upon these natural variations, and can be incorporated into biological, ecological, chemical, and geological studies. Using isotope ratios, often 2H/1H, ùõø13C, the 15N/14N ratio, and 18O/16O, Fogel has studied modern and ancient ecosystems, and has begun to apply the same techniques to study extraterrestrial material in martian meteorites, helping to advance the field of astrobiology.  Paleo-ecology and climate change  Fogel uses isotope ratios in ancient sediments and fossils to trace climate, diet, and species presence over time. Genyornis newtoni In one study, she and collaborators used Genyornis newtoni eggshells in Australia ranging from 100,000 to 50,000 years of age to show that their extinction 50,000 years ago was likely due to human impact rather than climate changes. 40,000 years ago, Australia went through a dry period, as recorded in emu eggshells, but the extinction of Genyornis 50,000 years ago rather than 40,000 suggests that their extinction was likely unrelated to the drying. Using stable carbon isotopes, her group determined that Genyornis consumed nearly exclusively C3 plants, and that their cranial morphology indicated a browser reliant upon shrubland. Because it seems that the Genyornis diet is fairly restrictive, it is likely that the arrival of humans around 55,000 years ago and their burning of land may have caused some megafauna extinction as it changed the flora population. She has used similar techniques to study amino acids in the elephant birds of Madagascar and measure the isotope ratios in modern ostrich eggshells as a calibration tool for paleoenvironmental studies of Africa. Fossilized portion of a Prototaxites loganii from the middle Devonian Isotope ratios can also indicate species and diet characteristics in fossilized specimens. A Paleozoic fossil of Prototaxites has attracted attention dating back to 1859 due to its odd tree- like trunk measuring up to 8m long. Because the Paleozoic Era was one of drastic organismal shift, and the origin of vascular plants, it was previously unclear if Prototaxites were vascular plants or fungal species. However, a team of researchers, including Fogel, found the ùõø13C of the species to be as much as 13‚Ä∞ different from contemporaneous vascular plants, suggesting that Prototaxites are in fact heterotrophs, and more likely a fungus. Using carbon isotope ratios in prehistoric human bone collagen, Fogel was able to study the diet of ancient humans. North American humans were either primarily maize eaters, which is a C4 plant, or primarily hunter-gatherers, which contains more C3 plants. Using this knowledge, Fogel measured the ùõø13C values of essential amino acids to indicate whether the ancient human populations consumed primarily maize or were hunter-gatherers. Similarly, she was able to measure the marine nitrogen presence in human skeletons on Easter Island to establish that they consumed large amounts of marine food, and used the 15N enrichment in infants to determine the length of nursing in prehistoric populations.  Modern ecosystems  Isotopic ratios are often used to trace the flow of certain elements through environmental systems. \\"Tagging\\" a molecule with an unusual isotope can allow a researcher to study a specific molecule and follow it in ecosystems, a technique known as using environmental tracers. Beyond human tagged compounds, natural isotope abnormalities occur as a result of various biotic and abiotic processes, and can often be found to vary across regions and species. Fogel has used these variations as natural ways to track animal movements, diets, and environmental shifts, and has also investigated the specific mechanisms that lead to environmental isotope fractionation. As an example of a biotic fractionation event, respiration has led to an enrichment of 18O in the atmosphere relative to 16O. The isotopic ratio of 18O/16O is +23.5‚Ä∞ relative to V-SMOW, and this ratio should also be observed in oxygen's consumption ratios. In one of the first major studies of plant oxygen consumption and fractionation, Guy, Fogel, and Berry defined the oxygen fractionation effects of various plant functions. They found that plants do not fraction oxygen isotopes in the photolysis of water in spinach thylakoids, but that they did discriminate against 18O during oxygen uptake by 21.3‚Ä∞ during for the oxygenation of Rubisco in spinach and by 22.7‚Ä∞ during the photorespiration of phosphoglycate by glycate oxidase. The fractionation during oxygen uptake in these two processes contribute strongly to the 18O/16O of the atmosphere, which is about 1.0235 times that of seawater. Saltwater cordgrass, or Spartina alterniflora When it comes to tracing isotopes through the ecosystems, carbon-13 is often used. However, because plants contain such a large portion of the biomass, this tracer relies upon the assumption that the various components of plant tissues all contain the same isotopic ratios. Benner, Fogel, and Hodson proved that this isn't the case. Lignin, the main structural polymer in plants, was found to be depleted in 13C by 2-6‚Ä∞ relative to the whole plant, and by 4-7‚Ä∞ relative to the cellulose in saltwater cordgrass. This discovery suggests that, when using isotope tracers in the environment, it's important to compare similar types of molecules. African elephants at Amboseli National Park in Kenya Animal migration patterns can be traced as the isotope ratios fluctuate depending on their location to match their intake. Fogel has used carbon, nitrogen, and strontium isotope ratios to study African elephant diet and habitat use in the Amboseli Park in Kenya. Carbon isotope ratios vary by plant type, and so a change in carbon ratio of an elephant can indicate a shift in diet from trees to grasses. Strontium isotope ratios are reflected in the geologic age of bedrock, and so can be used as a tracer of the concentration of elephants within the park. In Great Gray Owls, migration is thought to cause a large amount of nutritional stress. Tracing the 15N/14N and ùõø13C ratios in the birds' muscle tissues along with the contents of the birds' stomachs showed that nutritionally stressed owls were too weak to hunt, and at the brink of irreversible starvation as a result of their migration. Stable isotope ratios can also reveal diet specialization and shifts as specific carbon and nitrogen ratios are often indicative of groups of organisms. Using these ratios, Fogel has worked on diet studies on California sea otters, butterflies, blue crabs, killer whales, San Joaquin kit foxes, and bald eagles. These same techniques of isotope fractionation investigations have also been used to study human environmental impacts. Because organic sewage outflow is enriched in 15N, she and her collaborators have been able to study the impacts of human sewage on coral reef systems by drawing a correlation between the 15N/14N ratio and the percentage of diseased coral species, as well as the impacts of chicken houses on nearby ecosystems.  Astrobiology  As a Team Member of the NASA Astrobiology Institute from 1998‚Äì2010, Fogel worked on the Arctic Mars Analog Svalbard Expedition team in addition to her own collaborative research. One such project focused upon organic matter in carbonaceous chondrite meteorites where they measured the amino acid presence in three meteorites. First, to make sure that the amino acids were extraterrestrial in origin, they measured the ùõø13C values of the amino acids in the meteorites, which turned out to be significantly higher than the ùõø13C value of amino acids on Earth, confirming that they were not contamination from Earth (+31.6‚Ä∞ to +50.5‚Ä∞ in the meteorites relative to -70‚Ä∞ to 11.25‚Ä∞ present on Earth). The team of researchers also found that two of the meteorites had the highest ever detected amino acid abundances, which may be because carbonaceous chondrites are the most primitive and least altered meteorites. Two of the meteorites also had a similar carbon isotope value to a meteorite measured previously, which may indicate a reservoir of the amino acids in the interstellar medium. In 2012, Steele et al. announced that ten out of the eleven measured martian meteorites contained abiotic macromolecular organic carbon in high-temperature forming minerals (igneous rocks). Organic carbon presence inside of high-temperature forming minerals indicates that the martian magmas precipitated reduced carbon species during crystallization. These results supported an idea initially postulated by Hirshmann and Withers that the martian atmosphere was formed from a reduced mantle. The reducing conditions indicated by the meterotic carbon content tentatively supports abiotic production of methane on Mars. = Academic service and honors = In 2012, Marilyn Fogel was elected as a Fellow to the American Association for the Advancement of Science and given the Sigma Xi Distinguished Scientist Award from the UC Merced Chapter.

It has a single erect, hairy leaf and up to three pale yellow flowers with drooping lateral sepals and petals. Description Caladenia petrensis is a terrestrial, perennial, deciduous, herb with an underground tuber. It is sometimes found as a solitary plant or otherwise in small clumps. It has a single erect, hairy leaf long, wide and blotched with reddish-purple near its base. Up to three flowers long and wide are borne on a spike tall. The flowers are cream-coloured to pale yellow with dark red lines and blotches. The dorsal sepal is erect, long, wide and curves slightly forwards. The sepals and petals are linear to lance-shaped near their base, then suddenly narrow to a dark brown, thread-like tip covered with glandular hairs. The lateral sepals are long, wide and spread widely but with drooping tips. The petals are long, wide and arranged like the lateral sepals. The labellum is pale yellowish-white with red stripes, long, wide with forward-facing serrations on the sides. The tip of the labellum curves downwards and there are two rows of anvil-shaped calli along its centre. Flowering occurs from late July to September. Taxonomy and naming Caladenia petrensis was first formally described by Andrew Brown and Garry Brockman in 2007 from a specimen collected near Rothsay. The description was published in Nuytsia. The specific epithet (petrensis) is a Latin word meaning \\"among rocks\\" referring to the rocky habitat where this species grows. Distribution and habitat The rock spider orchid is found between Canna and Paynes Find in the Avon Wheatbelt, Geraldton Sandplains and Yalgoo biogeographic regions where it grows in seasonally moist soils on rocky hills.

He was the director of the Paris Opera from 1879 until his death at the age of 62. Vaucorbeil was born in Rouen and studied at the Paris Conservatoire. As a composer, he was best known for his art songs, but he also composed chamber music and two operas. Life and career Vaucorbeil was born in Rouen, the son of a popular actor at the Th√©√¢tre du Gymnase who performed under the under the stage name \\"Ferville\\". With financial assistance from Queen Marie Amelie, he entered the Paris Conservatoire in 1835 and studied there for seven years. After leaving the conservatory, he initially earned a living by giving singing lessons and composing art songs. During this period hee also composed chamber music, piano suites, a three-act op√©ra comique, La Bataille d' amour, and an ambitious cantata, La Mort de Diane. Finding it difficult to earn a living solely as a composer, in 1872 Vaucorbeil took a post in the French government department dealing with state-subsidised theatres. In 1878 he was given the title Inspecteur des Beaux-Arts (Inspector of Fine Arts), and the following year was appointed Director of the Op√©ra de Paris.Fuller-Maitland, J. A. (ed.) (1910). \\"Vaucorbeil, Auguste Emmanuel\\". Grove's Dictionary of Music and Musicians, Vol. V, pp. 233‚Äì234. MacMillan Caricature of Vaucorbeil by Andr√© Gill, 1879 According to Michael Georg Conrad, Vaucorbeil's appointment to the Op√©ra was initially viewed with optimism. It was the first time the company would be run by a trained musician since the days of Fran√ßois Habeneck who had left the Director's post in 1824. Long a champion of French baroque opera and ballet, in an 1877 memo to the French Assembl√©e nationale Vaucorbeil had lamented the failure of French opera houses to stage these works in the 19th century. In 1880 he instituted a concert series of these works at the Op√©ra, although financial constraints meant that fully staged productions proved impossible. Vaucorbeil's tenure was at times a stormy one. The Op√©ra's principal conductor Charles Lamoureux resigned six months into Vaucorbeil's directorship after a quarrel over the company's repertoire. When Massenet presented him with his newly composed opera H√©rodiade in 1881, Vaucorbeil rejected its production at the Op√©ra because he found the libretto incoherent. H√©rodiade premiered to great success at La Monnaie in Brussels instead. Further friction was caused by Vaucorbeil's policy of reducing expenses by casting young prize-winners from the Paris Conservatoire instead of established stars, a practice which was not viewed favourably by the composers of the operas he produced there.Ellis, Katharine (2005). Interpreting the Musical Past: Early Music in Nineteenth-Century France, p. 121. Oxford University Press. Durand, Michel (2004). Michael Georg Conrad √† Paris (1878-1882), pp. 218‚Äì219. Peter Lang. Vaucorbeil was constantly under pressure to produce new works each season and at the same time keep the state-subsidised company's expenditure down. Writing in 1881, Conrad defended what he called Vaucorbeil's occasionally brusque and authoritarian manner, attributing it to the anxiety caused by the heavy responsibilities he faced. They would eventually wear him down and ruin his health. Vaucorbeil died in 1884 at the age of 62 after suffering for two weeks from what was described in Le Figaro as a serious and agonizing intestinal illness. His funeral was held at the √âglise Saint-Philippe-du-Roule in Paris. The Op√©ra de Paris chorus and orchestra conducted by Ernest Alt√®s performed the Mozart Requiem, the Funeral March from Beethoven's Eroica, and the \\"Qui tollis\\" from Rossini's Petite messe solennelle sung by Gabrielle Krauss and Ren√©e Richard. The funeral cort√®ge then made its way to Montmartre Cemetery where Vaucorbeil was buried in the family tomb. His widow, Anna Sternberg Vaucorbeil (1845‚Äì1898), had been a prominent singer at La Monnaie and briefly appeared at the Paris Opera. She retired from the stage after her marriage to Vaucorbeil in 1874.Pougin, Arthur Pougin (ed.) (1880). \\"Vaucorbeil, Auguste- Emmanuel\\". Biographie universelle des musiciens, Vol. 2, pp. 610-611.

Le Gaulois. p. 2 The day after his death, Auguste Vitu wrote a lengthy account in Le Figaro of Vaucorbeil's life and the successes and failures he encountered in his management of the Op√©ra. He began the piece by writing that the Op√©ra would kill others too, equally intelligent and as confident as Vaucorbeil had been when he first took over its management. At the end, he wrote: > Vaucorbeil, the honest man in all senses of the word. That is to say, a > loyal, affable, and kind man, who did not know how to fight back and who > when forced to refuse the impossible, grieved at the refusal as if he had > suffered it himself. This sensitivity made him share the sorrows of others > in his most intimate being as if they were his own. It consumed him, slowly > at first, and then like an explosion. Voice and piano score for Vaucorbeil's opera Bataille d'amour Compositions As a composer, Vaucorbeil was best known for his art songs, many of them set to texts by prominent poets of the day and initially appearing individually in the periodical Le M√©nestrel. A complete collection of his songs was published by Heugel in 1860.Le M√©nestrel (15 April 1860). \\"M√©lodies de A.E. Vaucorbeil\\", p. 156 Heugel also published some of Vaucorbeil's chamber music‚Äîthree sonatas for piano and violin and String Quartet No. 1 dedicated to Joseph d'Ortigue who was a great admirer of Vaucorbeil's work. His Intimit√©s (6 pieces for solo piano) was published by Durand and his string quintet based on Norwegian melodies was published by Richault. He also composed several pieces of vocal religious music which were published by La Ma√Ætrise in 1860, including Cantique des Trois Enfants to a text by Corneille and a Kyrie for three voices. Vaucorbeil composed three dramatic works: *Bataille d'amour, an op√©ra comique in three acts set to a libretto by Victorien Sardou and Karl Daclin.

In 1949 the school had 185 students; that year the school added a $165,000 wing with two classrooms, a 500-seat gymnasium, a heating plant, and an administration office. The yellow-brick structure, which included one story and a basement and had the capability to be expanded, was designed by Arthur E. Swanson & Associates architects and built by Powers Construction. The total number of classrooms in the school structure was six. By 1950 it already had 230 students, so another school bond for an addition of four classrooms was proposed that year.

In 1971 439 voters rejected a $1,635,000 bond for school equipment as well as additions and renovations of the Hillside School, while 323 voted in favor. In 1968 the school district proposed a bond for a $975,000 grade 6-8 junior high school campus to relieve the Hillside School. For this purpose, the school district bought a parcel of land in Westchester. \\"Concord purchased the land in an auction in 1998.

The Chicago Tribune stated there was a decline in students in the area surrounding the school site. In 1998 the district instead sold the land to Concord Homes for $2.6 million. By 1999 the school district instead built another addition to the Hillside School, funded by the sale of the Westchester land. In 2012 the district had 485 students.

It has a single erect, hairy leaf and one or two dull creamy-white to pale yellow flowers with spreading lateral sepals and petals. Description Caladenia saxicola is a terrestrial, perennial, deciduous, herb with an underground tuber. It is sometimes found as a solitary plant or otherwise in small clumps. It has a single pale green, erect, hairy leaf long, wide. One or two flowers long and wide are borne on a spike tall. The flowers are dull creamy-white to pale yellow with dark red lines and blotches. The dorsal sepal is erect, long, wide and curves slightly forwards. The sepals and petals are linear to lance-shaped near their base, then suddenly narrow to a purplish-black, thread-like tip covered with glandular hairs. The lateral sepals are long, wide and spread widely but curving downwards. The petals are long, wide and spread widely, usually curving gently upwards. The labellum is creamy yellow with red stripes, long, wide with serrations on the sides. The tip of the labellum curves downwards and there are two rows of anvil-shaped calli up to long along its centre. Flowering occurs from late July to early September. Taxonomy and naming Caladenia saxicola was first formally described by Andrew Brown and Garry Brockman in 2007 from a specimen collected near Coolgardie. The description was published in Nuytsia. The specific epithet (saxicola) is derived from the Latin word saxum meaning \\"rock\\" and the suffix -cola meaning \\"dweller in\\" referring to the rocky habitat where this species grows. Distribution and habitat The banded ironstone spider orchid is found between Canna and Diemals in the Coolgardie and Yalgoo biogeographic regions where it mostly grows in seasonally moist soils on banded ironstone hills.

Biography  Barbini was born in Venice on June 25, 1901. After graduating as a sea captain at the Nautical Institute of Venice in 1921, in 1922 he enlisted in the Italian Royal Navy to carry out his military service; in November 1922, after attending the reserve officer course, he became a midshipman. He was promoted to ensign in June 1923; having decided to pursue a naval career, he remained in the Navy beyond his compulsory service time. In the following years he served on both surface vessels and submarines, as well as in shore assignments at the Northern Adriatic Naval Command, the San Bartolomeo Specialist School in La Spezia, the San Marco Regiment and the Pula Naval Command. He was promoted to sub- lieutenant in March 1927 and to Lieutenant in November 1936. On November 19, 1939 he assumed command of the torpedo boat Angelo Bassini, which he still commanded when Italy entered World War II on June 10, 1940.Giovanni Barbini on the Website of the Italian Navy Having been given command of the torpedo boat Nicola Fabrizi, on the night between November 11 and 12, 1940 Barbini was escorting a convoy in the Southern Adriatic, when the latter came under attack by four light cruisers and two destroyers under Vice Admiral Henry Pridham- Wippell. In the ensuing battle, while the escort leader in the auxiliary cruiser RAMB III withdrew after firing a few shots, Barbini counterattacked twice with guns and torpedoes (that could not be fired due to the damage suffered), in an attempt to draw enemy fire on his ship and distract the British force from the merchant ships. Fabrizi was heavily damaged, and was ultimately unable to prevent the convoy's destruction; on fire and slowly sinking, the torpedo boat limped into Vlor√´ (). Barbini had been seriously wounded at the beginning of the battle, but despite serious blood loss from a wounded leg, he refused medical aid until the fighting was over, and maintained command of his ship until it was safely moored in harbour.Giorgio Giorgerini, La guerra italiana sul mare.

D. nigrospiracula share the Sonoran Desert with three other species of Drosophila: D. pachea, D. mettleri, and D. mojavensis. D. nigrospiracula do not exhibit sexual isolation between the other species. This fly breeds on the decomposing tissues of two species of cacti that are also endemic to the region: card√≥n (Pachycereus pringlei) and saguaro (Carnegiea gigantea).  Taxonomy  D. nigrospiracula is part of the D. anceps species complex. This species is categorized as part of the D. mulleri subgroup, one of the five subgroups within the Drosophila repleta group of the Drosophila genus. The four Drosophila fly species inhabiting the Sonoran Desert are not particularly closely related to each other but are all, however, under the repleta group. Each species came to inhabit this region independently, and they experience different resource availability. As such, they adapted independently to the environment of the Sonoran Desert and came to use different cactus species as hosts.  Habitat  A card√≥n cactus (Pachycereus pringlei) found in the Baja Peninsula, Sonoran Desert. A saguaro cactus (Carnegiea gigantea) found in the Sonoran Desert. D. nigrospiracula are only found in the Sonoran Desert and specifically on card√≥n (Pachycereus pringlei) and saguaro (Carnegiea gigantean) cacti. Card√≥n and saguaro are tall, columnar cacti with similar morphology, chemical composition, and low alkaloid composition (their main allelochemical). Saguaro grow on the main part of the desert, while the card√≥n species grows only on the Baja peninsula. D. nigrospiracula is restricted to these two forms of cacti because they emit the alkaloids gigantine and carnegine, which D. nigrospiracula can metabolize. These allelochemicals are usually harmful to an insect without the proper allelochemical detoxification enzymes ‚Äì namely the cytochrome p450 system. In general, formation of plant decay can come from injury or freezing of the cactus. Then, exudate flows down the plant, creating a place for D. nigrospiracula to congregate. = Mechanism of metabolism of host plant = The cytochrome p450 system is found in nearly all life forms and is responsible for processing pheromones and steroids and also metabolizing insecticides, drugs, mutagens, and carcinogens. The p450 system allows Drosophila to metabolize and detoxify the secondary compounds that the cacti use as a function of herbivore defense in order to viably use the plant as a host.  Home range  Typical population sizes range from 361 to 3,999 flies. These flies commute to other saguaro cacti at rates three times higher than any other Drosophila species; they live in short-lived yet widespread habitats, requiring constant relocation to look for resources. D. nigrospiracula travel up to 2 km per day to gain resources between the low density cacti.  Life history  D. nigrospiracula eggs form in follicles that consist of 15 nurse cells, and a given female's paired ovaries consist of hundreds of follicles. The chromosomes of these flies are polyploid and are actively transcribed to RNA, which is then passed to oocytes to help with embryogenesis. In the final stages of oogenesis, nurse cells dispose of their nuclear components into growing oocytes, providing them resources for embryonic development. = Role of phosphorus in egg formation = D. nigrospiracula exhibit sexual dimorphism through differing ratios of phosphorus concentration in adult males and females. Females have about 3 times as much phosphorus in their gonads as males. This inequality is due to the importance of phosphorus in the synthesis of nucleic acids during oogenesis. The cacti on which D. nigrospiracula breed and feed have low concentrations of phosphorus, but research has shown that the higher concentration in females comes from the phosphorus transferred from the male to the female during copulation. The phosphorus from the male ejaculate is incorporated into the female ovaries and traceable in RNA and DNA. Inside the female, phosphorus is then used to synthesize nucleic acids necessary in egg production. Reduced phosphorus levels in mature female diets slowed oogenesis.  Mating  Larger males tended to be more successful in mating than smaller males, as they win the male-male competition for females. Females approach males to mate at non-resource-based territories controlled by a male. D. nigrospiracula has a sex ratio that favors females, as females can mate multiple times in one morning. Additionally, females also are ready to mate 3 days after birth, but males do not reach sexual maturation until they are 9 to 10 days old. These two factors greatly increase the operational sex ratio in favor of females. = Courtship = D. nigrospiracula exhibit varied mating behavior. Males initiate courtship first by physical contact with females. They then perform wing displays while they encroached the female from behind, often circling the female multiple times. The wing display consisted of quickly opening and then closing of one or both wings, which creates bursts of sound. Males also licked the female genitalia if the female stopped moving. Females showed willingness to mate by spreading their wings, while uninterested females relocated away from the male. Male D. nigrospiracula are persistent in courtship but do not mount an unwilling female.  Enemies  = Macrocheles subbadius = Macrocheles subbadius is an ectoparasite also indigenous to the North American region of the Sonoran Desert that inhabits both saguaro and card√≥n cacti. It reproduces on moist soil, animal feces, and rotting plant tissue. They obtain nutrients by biting into the integument of flies and intaking the hemolymph found in the body cavity of the fly, using it for nutrients. This parasite reduces the life span of D. nigrospiracula in a manner proportional to the amount of parasites found on the body. Reduction in overall health is due to physical trauma caused by Macrocheles subbadius and also due to the loss of nutrients. This parasite was also found to hinder female fertility and development of offspring. = Effects of parasitism on sexual reproduction = Despite energetic costs to courting and mating, D. nigrospiracula increased reproductive efforts when perturbed by parasites. Younger males devoted even more time to courtship when affected by more parasites. The same phenomenon was also observed in a study with older males when lightly affected by parasites, but courtship levels dropped to below control levels when heavily parasitized. Researchers attribute this behavioral characteristic of D. nigrospiracula as an evolutionarily adaptive advantage, as the flies attempt to pass on their genes when lower life expectancy is detected. However, while parasite-infested Drosophila look to mate at higher frequencies, another study shows that males and females are less likely to find mates. Males have an even harder time finding mates than females even if infected by the same amount of M. subbadius. Furthermore, the intensity of female choice is directly proportional to the depth of parasitic infection. Researchers attribute these observations to reduced male-male competitive ability, decreased courtship vigor, and even physical prevention of copulation.  Microbiome  As mentioned, D. nigrospiracula use the necrotic tissues of the saguaro cactus for mating and also as their food source. However, the microbiota of D. nigrospiracula is significantly different from the microbiota found on card√≥n and saguaro cacti and actually is more similar to flies from different cacti from other regions. The most abundant of the bacteria does not come from the food on the cacti. These bacterial colonies were colonized through host-to-host transmission by other species and settings.  Competition with Drosophila mettleri This species shares certain behavioral commonalities with Drosophila mettleri. A major difference between these two fly species, however, that serves to limit the amount of competition between them in nesting site selection is more genetically than behaviorally explained. D. mettleri contains an upregulation in the CYP28A1 gene in the P450 gene family. Upregulation in this gene enables D. mettleri to breed in both the toxic soil surrounding rotting cacti and on the tissues of rotting cacti patches. D. nigrospiracula, however, lacks this upregulated gene and can only nest on the tissues of rotting cacti patches. This particular genetic difference enables both species of desert Drosopholids to use the same host cacti in the same geographic region without competitive pressures.

It is a ground orchid with a single erect, sparsely hairy leaf and usually only one greenish-cream flower with red stripes along the sepals and petals. Description Caladenia septuosa is a terrestrial, perennial, deciduous, herb with an underground tuber and a single erect, sparsely hairy leaf. The leaf is long, wide and dull green. Usually only a single greenish-cream flower across is borne on a spike tall. The sepals, but not the petals, have brown, club-like glandular tips long. The dorsal sepal is long, wide and curves forward. The lateral sepals are long and wide, spread apart and curve downwards. The petals are long, about wide and arranged like the lateral sepals. The labellum is long and wide, green and white with a dark red tip. The sides of the labellum turn upwards and have three or four pairs of thin green teeth up to long, and the tip curves downwards. There are four or six rows of dark red calli up to long, along the labellum mid-line. Flowering occurs from September to October. Taxonomy and naming Caladenia septuosa was first formally described in 1991 by David Jones and the description was published in Australian Orchid Research. The specific epithet (septuosa) is a Latin word meaning \\"obscure\\" referring to the small lateral lobes on the labellum.

Background The two movements are instrumental arrangements Grieg made of two of his 12 Melodies, Op. 33, published in 1880: these were settings for voice and piano of words by the Norwegian poet and journalist Aasmund Olavsson Vinje.Grieg ‚Äì Two Elegiac Melodies for string orchestra, Op. 34 Utah Symphony, accessed 7 April 2017.Edvard Grieg ‚Äì Elegiac Melodies (2) for orchestra (or piano), Op. 34 Allmusic, accessed 7 April 2017. Two Elegiac Melodies was dedicated to Heinrich von Herzogenberg.The dedication is shown on the cover of the score. Grieg also made an arrangement for solo piano. Description It is scored for 1st violins (sometimes in two parts), 2nd violins (in two parts), violas (in two parts), cellos and double basses. The many parts allow for a thick texture when required. =\\"The Wounded Heart\\"= Norwegian: Hjertes√•r. German: Herzwunden. Vinje's words, from Grieg's Op. 33 No. 3, relate that wounds have been suffered by the heart in the struggles of life, but it has survived; faith is not destroyed. The music is in C minor. There are three verses: in verse 1 the melody is played by the first violins; in verse 2 by the cellos, with an insistent quaver accompaniment from all other parts, contrasting with the other verses; and in verse 3 by the first violins, the orchestration being similar to the first verse, but heavier. {key c minor tempo \\"Allegretto espressivo\\" partial 4 g'4 fis'4.( fis'8--) g'4( bes'8 g'8) fis'4 fis'8 fis'8 g'4.( g'8--) a'4 a'8 a'8 bes'4( a'8 g'8--) bes'4 a'2 } The beginning of the melody of \\"The Wounded Heart\\", played by the 1st violins =\\"The Last Spring\\"= Norwegian: V√•ren.

The sign was originally installed in 1966 behind the left field fence but was moved to the parking lot in 1979, one year before American football's Los Angeles Rams started sharing the stadium with MLB's Los Angeles Angels. The sign is also responsible for the nickname of Angel Stadium as \\"The Big A\\". The halo lights up after every Angels win (regardless of whether it happens at home or on the road), which gives rise to the catchphrase \\"Light That Baby Up!\\" amongst Angels fans. (When Dick Enberg was an Angels broadcaster in the 1970s, he would punctuate the team's victories with the phrase \\"And the halo shines tonight!\\")  History  The sign was erected in 1966 outside then-Anaheim Stadium specifically to hold the scoreboard. The $1 million construction cost was covered by Standard Oil of California in exchange for a 10-year advertising rights deal on the sign. The sign was initially colored white. Measuring in height, at the time of its construction it was the tallest structure in Orange County, at 23 stories tall. In 1979, one year before the Los Angeles Rams moved in, Anaheim Stadium was retrofitted to make it suitable to host American football games, including all decks of seating wrapping around the entire stadium. As a result, the Big A Sign was moved from its position overlooking the stadium into the parking lot, despite protests from Angels fans and owners. Approximately 1,000 people came to watch the sign be moved. However, after it had been moved approximately , one of the dollies started to tilt the sign, requiring the seven-hour move to be postponed until the next day. In 1995, when the Rams moved out of Angel Stadium to become the St. Louis Rams, a number of the 1979 retrofits were removed. As a result, there were proposals to move the sign back to its original location. However, this did not occur owing to the cost of moving it and because it had become a good meeting place for fans and afforded the Angels the opportunity to advertise to passing motorists.  Use  Since its move to the parking lot, the Big A Sign has been used to advertise for the Angels' sponsors, and the old scoreboard has been used as an electronic marquee to promote upcoming Major League Baseball games to passing motorists on the nearby freeway. The halo on the top of the sign lights up to signify to passersby and nearby motorists that the Angels have won a game. In 2017, the electrical system of the Big A Sign was tampered with, possibly in an attempt to charge a cell phone, as part of an outbreak of vandalism around Angel Stadium. A county supervisor said \\"the voltage on the ‚ÄòBig A‚Äô is so high that you have to have a special certification just to get inside the fence.

He is best known for his collection of paintings by Pieter Bruegel the Elder and Frans Floris. His brother was the sculptor Jacques Jonghelinck. Iongelinck. Fortification listed on map of Antwerp dated 1582 In the archives of Antwerp, a writ of guarantee by Jonghelinck, dated 15 February 1566 and declaring to be worth 16.000 guilders, for his friend Daniel de Bruyne lists \\"sixteen paintings by Bruegel, among them the Tower of Babel, a painting with the title Christ carrying the Cross, the twelve Months of the Year, and all the others whichever they might be\\". Jonghelinck probably commissioned these paintings though that has not been recorded, for his fortified country house outside of Antwerp that was designed by his brother Jacques in 1547 and sold in 1554 to Nicolaes. It can still be seen on a map dated 1582 though it was destroyed during the Fall of Antwerp.Christian V√∂hringer ‚Äì Pieter Bruegel. 1525/30-1569, Tandem Verlag 2007 (h.f.ullmann imprint) S. 116f Months of the Year Though it is known that Jonghelinck owned 16 paintings by Bruegel at the time of his death, the specific list is unknown and for many years art historians assumed that this cycle of paintings included either four panels for the four seasons or twelve panels for all twelve months. Now it is assumed they represent six bi-monthly pairs, with one missing.See for example record 261005 for Hunters in the Snow in the RKD They are assumed to be a continuation of an older tradition to make cyclical images of the Labours of the Months, but they were hung by Jonghelinck in his chateau and therefore may simply have been ordered as wall decorations.Plus semper quam pingitur: The Catholic Bruegel by German art historian Nils B√ºttner The surviving Months of the Year cycle are: File:Pieter Bruegel de Oude - De sombere dag (vroege voorjaar).jpgThe Gloomy Day (February/March) File:Die Heuernte.jpgThe Hay Harvest (June/July) File:Pieter Bruegel the Elder- The Harvesters - Google Art Project.jpgThe Harvesters (August/September) File:Pieter Bruegel (I) - The Return of the Herd (1565).jpgThe Return of the Herd (October/November) File:Pieter Bruegel the Elder - Hunters in the Snow (Winter) - Google Art Project.jpgThe Hunters in the Snow (December/January) The Tower of Babel Tower of Babel Bruegel's Tower of Babel is one of several paintings in the possession of Jonghelinck that came into the collection of the City of Antwerp and later found their way into the Austrian Imperial collection of Vienna through Archduke Leopold Wilhelm of Austria.Turmbau zu Babel on museum website A smaller version by Breugel's hand is in Rotterdam, dated to the same period, which indicates the popularity of the subject in Jonghelinck's day. The Procession to Calvary The Procession to Calvary Michael Francis Gibson wrote an art-historical book entitled The Mill and the Cross, which served as the basis for the 2011 film The Mill and the Cross, directed by Lech Majewski. The film sets into their historical context in sixteenth-century Flanders the characters in the painting and the circumstances of the painting's creation. The films stars Rutger Hauer as Bruegel and Michael York as his patron Jonghelinck. Labours of Hercules Hercules Killing the Lernean Hydra Another artist in the collection of Jonghelinck was Frans Floris, who made ten panels of the Labours of Hercules (which are now lost and only known through later engravings).The Labours of Hercules on the British Museum website Floris also made seven compositions on the liberal arts for Jonghelinck, which were later exported to Genua.Seven Liberal Arts / Grammatica on the British Museum website Provenance Nicolaas Jonghelinck is listed as the first owner in 1566 (referring to the writ of guarantee above) for several of the paintings that have survived in the Austrian Imperial collection and are still in the Kunsthistorisches Museum today.

Description Diodora ruppellii has a shell with a whitish exterior marked with a radial pattern of dark blotches and a white interior surface marked with a faint pattern similar to the exterior. The shell is asteeply conical, elongated oval with a hole at the apex, which is roughly a third of the length of the shell from its anterior end. There are 20 to 25 radiating ribs on the exterior surface of the shell with some smaller ribs between them; the growth ridges are not as developed as the ribs and form knobs at where they intersect. The edges of the apical hole have conspicuous crenulations where they meet the ribs, the notches between the crenulations continue a short distance towards the inside of the shell. The shell can be up to 20 mm long, although 15mm is the most common length, and 10 mm high, in Red Sea specimens. Distribution Diodora ruppellii has an Indo-Pacific distribution occurring in the Red Sea and along the east African coasts as far south as KwaZulu-Natal and east through the Indian Ocean and Pacific Ocean to Hawaii. It was recorded in the Suez Canal in 1905 and reaching the Mediterraean in 1948 when it was recorded off the coast of Israel and had spread to south-eastern Turkey by 1995. Ecology Species in the genus Diodora feed on sponges from the undersides of rocks and boulders. Diodora ruppellii is normally found in the intertidal zone on rocky shores but has been dredged up from gravel substrates. External links * Odhner, N.H.J. (1919).

Campaign and Alvear withdrawal Michelle Bachelet and Soledad Alvear on a debate in Hualp√©n. After defining the two presidential candidates (a unique event in the history of the country, since the Concertaci√≥n would present a woman who has real chances of getting elected), began a series of meetings between both commands to define the system of election of the candidate only. Finally, on March 22, an open national election was agreed for all registered voters (except those registered in parties of another coalition), on July 31, 2005. In addition, a series of debates were scheduled in each of the regions, of which only two would be televised nationally; The first, in Hualp√©n (Concepci√≥n), scheduled for April 28, 2005, 7 and the last, scheduled for July 27 of the same year in the city of Santiago.

Henke; reclassified as MSC-203, on 7 February 1955; and commissioned on 14 June 1955, Lieutenant (jg) Frank Mabbett McCraw, Jr. in command.  East Coast operations  Two weeks later, Thrasher steamed for Charleston, South Carolina, her home port, to join Mine Force, Atlantic Fleet. But for a visit to Havana, Cuba, the wooden-hulled nonmagnetic coastal minesweeper spent the remainder of 1955, operating in South Carolina and Florida waters. She assumed duties as an active element of Mine Force, Atlantic, on the last day of the year; and, on New Year's Day 1956, her home port was changed to Yorktown, Virginia. The minesweeper's duties there included search and rescue missions for aircraft downed off the Virginia coast. West Coast operations Assigned to the Experimental Mine Warfare School at Key West in 1957, the coastal minesweeper operated off the east coast and in the Caribbean until 7 February 1958, when she departed Key West and steamed via the Panama Canal and Manzanillo, Mexico, to the California coast, arriving at San Diego on 28 February. Assigned for a time to Scripps Institute of Oceanography, Thrasher surveyed ocean currents off Monterey in March. That summer, she cooperated with Warner Brothers during the shooting of the film \\"Up Periscope\\", and then returned to her primary duty plying California's coastal waters as a minesweeper with the San Diego Harbor Defense Command. In the fall, she trained sailors of the Turkish Navy and later, when the Turkish Navy received a minesweeper from the United States under the Mutual Aid for Defense Program, continued to lend assistance during shakedown. Early in 1959, Thrasher joined Fleet Training Group, San Diego, for underway exercises. In April, she moved north to Seattle to conduct tests on the new \\"MM-1\\" automatic degaussing system; then returned to southern California for annual minesweeping exercises conducted out of Long Beach. On 8 May 1959, Thrasher departed San Diego and steamed independently to Hawaii for additional tests of the new degaussing system which had been designed to compensate for changes in latitude and longitude. After successfully completing the tests, she returned to San Diego on 6 June, and, later in the summer, provided assistance in channel conditioning to the harbor defense unit at San Francisco. In the fall, she acted as an observation ship for aerial minelaying operations conducted by Fleet Air Wing 14 off San Diego and conducted additional tests of the new degaussing system. In December 1959, Thrasher was transferred to the 12th Naval District and assigned a new home port of San Francisco for duty with that port's harbor defense unit. She took up her new duties in January, and, in February, acted as target ship for despite heavy seas which rolled the minesweeper up to 50 degrees. After work on her degaussing system and installation of \\"Shoran\\" at the Hunter's Point Naval Shipyard, Thrasher participated in minesweeping exercises out of Long Beach, earning a letter of commendation from Commander Mine Force, Pacific Fleet, for her performance. Late in the fall, she helped to salvage and refloat which had run aground at Santa Rosa Island. In this operation, Thrasher earned another letter of commendation. Decommissioning ‚Äì Reserve ship The minesweeper continued assignments off the west coast until she was decommissioned on 1 August 1961. Placed in service as a reserve training ship for the 12th Naval District, she operated in that capacity for the next 14 years, conducting weekend training cruises and occasional fortnight refresher training cruises for her selected reserve crew. During that time, she visited various California and Mexican ports. In the summers of 1966 and 1967, she joined and to form naval reserve Mine Division 13 for exercises, including a month of operations in 1967, off the coasts of Washington and Canada. That same year, Thrasher increased her number of reserve crews from one to two and stepped up her training activities correspondingly. In 1973, she made another summer cruise to northern ports, calling at ports in Oregon, Washington, and British Columbia. Inactivation In March 1975, she made her last reserve training cruise, conducting minesweeping exercises in Monterey Bay before returning to San Francisco. Towed to the inactive ship facility at Mare Island on 1 May 1975, she was inactivated and her name struck from the Navy list on 1 July. Transfer to Singapore On 1 December 1975, she was sold to the Republic of Singapore, rename Mercury (M-102).

The region in which Sighnaq was situated was called Farab, it was located between Isfijab and Jand. The name means 'place of refuge', a name that is found also in other regions, especially in Transcaucasia. According to Hathon, Sighnaq was located in the Karatau Mountains, from where the river Kara Ichuk, a tributary of Syr Darya, emanates. Klaproth says that the city was located on the banks of Mutkan, a right hand side tributary of Syr Darya, that emanates from the Karatau mountains, but he does not mention his source. Sherif al-Din speaks of Sabran and Sighnaq as two border cities of Turkestan and says that Sighnaq was located 40 km from Otrar; the biographical book called Tabakatol hanefiyet, by Ketevi, placed it near the town of Yassy (i.e. the modern city of Turkistan). The 19th century Hungarian turkologist and traveller V√°mb√©ry says, without mentioning the source, that Jand was connected to a channel. It seems to have been one of the main Turkish settlements of the region east of the Caspian Sea together with Yengikent, Sawran or Sabran and others. Mahmud Kashghari expressly stated it was a town of the Oghuz, al-Muqaddasi also associates it with Otrar and says that it was \\"24 farsakhs further up the Syr Darya\\". On the basis of all of this information, the most reasonable localization appears to be the area around Babai Kurgan, and finally, Sunak Kurgan, a few kilometers northeast of Tyumen Arik along the Orenburg-Tashkent railway, was identified as the ruins of Sighnaq. It is believed that in the tenth century there was a semi-sedentary city of the Oghuz Turks near the border, where they exchanged their products with those of Muslim states to the South. The Hudud al-'Alam indicates that bows were manufactured for export. The region was known as Dar al-Kufr. In the twelfth century it was the capital of the khanate of Kipchak (still pagan), and was exposed to raids of the 'ghazis'. At least two incursions (ghazawat) are known, one in 1152 and one in 1195, from Khwarezm, the second one occurred while Kayir Toku Khan ruled Sighnaq. However, at the beginning of the thirteenth century Ala al-Din Muhammad conquered the land and annexed it to his empire; a few years later, his rule was replaced with that of Genghis Khan, who conquered the region after a siege in 1220. The population was massacred. Annexed by Tamerlane (of the Timurid dynasty) in the late fourteenth century, in 1427, Baraq Khan, khan of the Blue Horde and also of the Golden Horde, claimed Sighnaq from Shah Rukh, the son of Tamerlane, who refused; Baraq defeated the Timurids and occupied the city; the Timurids recovered it after his death (circa 1428), but Abu'l-Khayr, founder of the Uzbek Khanate, conquered it in turn in 1446. In 1457 the battle of Kuk Kashanah, or K√∂k Ka≈°ane, took place 7 km to the South, in which the Kalmyks defeated the Uzbeks and Abu'l-Khayr had to accept whatever peace Uz Timur the Kalmyk would offer. Muhammad Shaybani, refounder of the Uzbek khanate, was born in the region of Sighnaq. In the sixteenth century it belonged to the Kazakhs, but it lost importance and eventually disappeared.

In the wild, the species is restricted to the highlands of central Kenya and northern Tanzania, including on Kilimanjaro, Mount Kenya and the Aberdare Range. It is sometimes called Mackinder's gladiolus.  Description  detail of a flowerhabitGladiolus watsonioides is a medium to high, roughly ¬Ω1 m, herbaceous geophyte with sword-shaped leaves, flattened in the plain of the stem, with spikes of red, curved, funnel-shaped, slightly bilaterally symmetrical flowers. Although G. watsonioides has underground storage, green plants can be seen all year round, due to the very even climate, with warm days and cold or frosty nights all year round. = Stems and leaves = At the base of the stem is a flattened fleshy corm of 1¬Ω2 cm in diameter, which is surrounded by a reddish brown, firm to soft fibrous and membranous tunic, that eventually disintegrates into irregular fragments. Each stem typically carries five to seven leaves. The three or four leaves at the foot of the stem are linear to linear-lanceolate, mostly ¬Ω1¬Ω cm wide, commonly reaching to lowest flower or slightly beyond. The two or three leaves higher on the stem are shorter. The stem is mostly unbranched (seldom with one or two side-branches) and is 24 mm in diameter at the base of the lowest flower. = Inflorescence and flowers = The mostly six to fourteen flowers are set in a spike, each subtended by two green to dark purple flushed bracts, which are usually 47¬Ω cm long at the low end and 1¬Ω5 cm at the tip of the spike. The flowers are scarlet red, with some yellow on the inside, and green on the outside, near the base in a fresh flower. The tube, where the tepals are still merged, is erect, slender and cylindrical at the base where it is enclosed in the bracts, and this part is mostly 1¬Ω2 cm long. It expands rather abruptly into a funnel- shaped upper part at a right angle with the stem of usually 1¬Ω‚Äì3 cm long and ¬Ω¬æ cm wide. The free parts of the tepals are not equal, the one furthest from the stem being slightly longer, ovate in shape, and usually 2¬Ω4¬º cm long and 1¬º2‚Öì cm wide. The tepals spread at approximately 45¬∞ from the flower axis. The filaments of the stamens are usually 1¬æ2¬Ω cm long, the free ends usually 11¬º cm, carrying the yellow usually 11¬º cm long anthers. The style divides into three whitish branches, each 3¬Ω‚Äì5 mm long, usually beyond the tip of the anthers. The fruit capsules are spheres to inverted egg-shaped, usually 2¬Ω3 cm long. In its home range, most flowers can be seen from August to November, but flowering occurs throughout the year.  Taxonomy  = Taxonomic history = Gladiolus watsonioides was first described by John Gilbert Baker in 1885, based on a specimen collected by Joseph Thomson from Mount Kilimanjaro in Tanzania, and now housed at Kew. A specimen, differing in having smaller flowers, was described in 1892 by Baker himself as G. watsonioides var. minor. Also in 1892, Ferdinand Albin Pax described Antholyza gracilis, which is different from Gladiolus gracilis, as described by Nikolaus Joseph von Jacquin already in 1792. Baker agreed with the assignment of his species to the genus Antholyza, but had to create the new combination A. watsonioides in 1898, to satisfy the International Code of Nomenclature for algae, fungi, and plants. In 1902, Joseph Dalton Hooker described Gladiolus mackinderi based on a specimen cultivated at Kew Gardens in 1901, which had been collected on Mount Kenya by Halford Mackinder. Charles Henry Wright described a plant from the Aberdare range as Antholyza speciosa in 1935, which is not the same as Gladiolus speciosus that was described by Carl Peter Thunberg back in 1811. Nicholas Edward Brown renamed the same plant to Gladiolus aberdaricus in 1932, and also suggested to call Baker‚Äôs species Homoglossum watsonioides, and the species of Pax Homoglossum gracile. cited on = Modern classification = Species that were assigned to Antholyza and Homoglossum are currently regarded to not diverge sufficiently to justify their separation from Gladiolus. The difference between the typical G. watsonioides and its var. minor is now regarded a result of less favorable growing conditions within the same genotype. All of these names are now considered synonymous. = Etymology = The species epithet watsonioides refers to a resemblance to another plant in the iris family, Watsonia.  Distribution  Mackinder's gladiolus is restricted to the highlands of central Kenya and northern Tanzania. In Kenya, it is known from Nakuru County, Fort Hall and Nyeri Districts, including Mount Kenya, while in Tanzania it can only be found in the Arusha and Mbulu Districts, including the Kilimanjaro and Meru, and on Mount Hanang.  Habitat  Mackinder's gladiolus can be found on mountain slopes above the forest zone, among the shrubs of the Erica arborea-zone, in lava rubble, and in glades in juniper forest. It can be found at altitudes between 2000‚Äì4200 m.  Cultivation  Gladiolus watsonioides grows well in gritty and humus-rich compost in deep pots if kept in a frost-free greenhouse.

Her first formal art lessons began in Stockholm in 1871. She continued her studies at the Finnish Art Association's drawing school (now part of the Academy of Fine Arts). Later, she studied privately with in Copenhagen and Luigi Premazzi in St. Petersburg. In 1884, she accompanied her father to Italy and painted watercolor landscapes. She spent a few summers painting on √Öland where she participated in the √ñnningebykolonin, a Finnish- Swedish art colony. She made many friends there, including J.A.G. Acke and Anna Wengberg, who both paid visits to her father's home. Johan and Anna had discussed marriage, but he eventually decided to marry Eva. They were wed in 1891 and moved to Uppsala, where he was restoring artworks at the Uppsala Cathedral. They continued to visit the art colony for a time, but their visits slowly became less frequent.

The attacker, a 39-year-old man identified as Ziyed Ben Belgacem, was shot dead after attempting to seize a weapon from a soldier patrolling the airport under Op√©ration Sentinelle. At Orly Airport, the attacker shouted that he wanted to kill and die in the name of Allah. the attack is officially regarded as an act of terrorism. Timeline of attacks =Initial attacks= The first attack took place at 06:55 local time in the suburb of Garges-l√®s-Gonesse when the attacker was stopped by police during a routine traffic stop. He used a pellet gun to shoot and lightly injure a female police officer before driving away. He abandoned his vehicle in Vitry-sur-Seine shortly afterwards, where he threatened the patrons of a bar and, saying \\"in the name of Allah,\\" stole another car at gunpoint from a mother driving her daughter. =Airport attack= At about 08:30, he went to the departures level of the south terminal of Orly Airport and assaulted a member of a three-person patrol of air force soldiers. According to a description by Fran√ßois Molins of the Prosecutor's Office in Paris, \\"With a pistol in his right hand and a bag over his shoulder, he grabbed (the soldier) with his left arm, made her move backward by three to four meters (yards), positioning her as a shield, and pointed his revolver at her forehead,\\" shouting \\"Put down your weapons! Put your hands on your head! I am here to die for Allah. Whatever happens, there will be deaths.\\" As he struggled with the soldier, he knocked her to the ground and seized her FAMAS assault rifle. He was killed by the other two soldiers when the first soldier dropped to her knees and they opened fire. The attacker was found to have been carrying a gasoline can, a lighter, a Koran, a pack of cigarettes, and ‚Ç¨750. The seizure of the assault rifle was filmed by an eyewitness. Suspect and aftermath Belgacem is said to have been a radicalised French-born Muslim of North African origin who was a resident of Garges-l√®s-Gonesse. He was known to the authorities and on a police watchlist, though not on the Fiche \\"S\\" list of national security threats. Some reports say that he was born on 14 February 1978 in Paris. He had a lengthy criminal record that included convictions for armed robbery and had been in prison between March and November 2016. Due to his connection with radicalised Islamists, his home was searched in November 2015 following the Paris attacks a few days earlier. The attack at the airport led to its temporary closure and the evacuation of about 3,000 people. All flights to and from Orly were suspended and some were diverted to the larger Charles de Gaulle Airport east of Paris. The airport's west terminal was fully reopened by early afternoon, but air movements at the south terminal remained partly suspended with only incoming flights being permitted. Impact and context This was the sixth attack on police and military personnel guarding French cities during the state of emergency. Several terrorist attacks on police and soldiers had occurred in the Paris region by August 2017. In the February Louvre machete attack , a man attacked soldiers patrolling the entrance to the Louvre museum. In the 2017 Notre Dame attack, on 6 June, a man assaulted a police officer with a hammer at the cathedral of Notre Dame. In the 6 June 2017 Champs-√âlys√©es car ramming attack an extremist attempted to ram a car filled with explosives into a police patrol on the Champs-√âlys√©es.

He is Professor of Writing at the University of Canberra where he heads the university's International Poetry Studies Institute (IPSI) which he co- founded. He is an editor of the international journal Axon: Creative Explorations and co-founder of the International Prose Poetry Project.  Biography Paul Hetherington's parents are Robert Hetherington (1923‚Äì2015) and Penelope Hetherington (n√©e Loveday) (1928‚Äì). He grew up in Adelaide with his twin brother Mark and his younger sister Naomi (1961‚Äì) until his family moved to Perth in 1966 when his father accepted a job in the fledgling Politics Department of the University of Western Australia. His father later became a Western Australian member of parliament. His mother was an academic historian with particular interests in African History and Women's History, who worked at the University of Western Australia. Hetherington undertook his undergraduate studies at the University of Western Australia, achieving a double major in English and History and at the end of his honours year in 1984 was awarded three undergraduate prizes. He completed a doctoral thesis at the same university in 1989 on the topic '\\"The Representative of the Verse\\": Death, Crisis and Versions of the Self in the Poetry of Emily Dickinson'. In his twenties he performed, wrote and directed for different amateur theatre groups. He lived as Michelle Frances Combs' partner from 1980 and they married in 1985. Their daughters are Suzannah and Rebecca. Hetherington worked as a sessional tutor while undertaking postgraduate studies and then accepted the job of Publications and Events Coordinator at Fremantle Arts Centre in 1989. In 1990 he moved to the National Library as Education Manager and editor of National Library News (1990 to 2009). In 1994 he became director of the Library's Publications Branch and from 1999 to 2009 directed the Publications and Events Branch, where his responsibilities included book publishing, website development and a program of conferences. After leaving the National Library of Australia he became Assistant Professor of Writing in the Faculty of Arts and Design at the University of Canberra in 2010 and is now Professor of Writing there. He is head of the International Poetry Studies Institute (IPSI) which was co-founded with Jen Webb and post-doctoral fellow Paul Munden. He is a co-founder of the International Prose Poetry Project, which he says, 'I started that, really by accident, by sending a prose poem to a couple of colleagues of mine at the University of Canberra'. He has played a significant role in the ACT cultural community, serving on numerous boards and helping to found the ACT Writers Centre in the mid-1990s and chairing its inaugural committee of management. He also chaired the ACT Cultural Council (2005‚Äì13) and the ACT Public Art Panel (2006‚Äì11). He is a former Deputy Chair of the ACT's Word Festival. He was a board member for the arts magazine Muse. Nationally he was a member of the Board of Australian Book Review (2004‚Äì12).  Poetry career Hetherington's career as a writer spans more than 30 years, and he has published 12 full-length poetry collections and six poetry chapbooks, along with numerous academic articles. He has spoken of deciding to write poetry at the age of 11 and has commented that 'One of the ways I recognise the poetic is when I find works in which language is condensed, ramifying, polysemous and unparaphraseable.' After achieving journal and magazine publication of his poems throughout the 1980s, the National Library of Australia published Hetherington's poetry chapbook, Mapping Wildwood Road in 1990 and Fremantle Arts Centre Press published Acts Themselves Trivial, his first full-length poetry collection in 1991. Molonglo Press in the ACT published his next four poetry books, including Shadow Swimmer, which won the 1996 ACT Book of the Year Award. Pandanus Books at the ANU then released his verse novel Blood and Old Belief in 2003. It Feels Like Disbelief was published in 2007 by Salt Publishing (Cambridge, UK). Three recent volumes, Six Different Windows (2013) ‚Äì which won the 2014 Western Australian Premier's Book Awards (poetry) ‚Äì and Burnt Umber (2016) - shortlisted for the Kenneth Slessor Prize for Poetry - and Moonlight on Oleander: Prose Poems (2018) have been released by UWA Publishing. Hetherington has said that Burnt Umber marked something of a new departure for him 'in a couple of ways ‚Ä¶ One of them is the presence of prose poetry in the collection ‚Ä¶ The other thing that's different is the ekphrastic poetry in the book.' Moonlight on Oleander extends Hetherington's interest in the prose poem form and is one of relatively few books consisting solely of prose poetry to have been published in Australia in the last decade. In 2002 Hetherington was awarded a Chief Minister's ACT Creative Arts Fellowship and in 2012 was awarded one of two places on the Australian Poetry Tour to Ireland, accompanied by Melbourne poet Petra White. In 2014 he was awarded an Australia Council for the Arts Literature Section Residency in the BR Whiting Studio in Rome for a practice-led research project entitled 'Roman Paintings' and while in Rome read at the Keats-Shelley House. In 2017 he won the Individual Research Excellence Award, Humanities and Creative Arts at the University of Canberra.  Critical response to Hetherington's poetry In reviewing Hetherington's Acts Themselves Trivial (1991), Simon Patton writes that 'the insight is certainly compelling. The desire to remember is established in these poems as a vital aspect of our humanity'. Shirley Walker writes of Shadow Swimmer (1995) that 'This is poetry of glowing sensuality, of urgent narrative pace, of tact in its exploration of intimate experience.' Glenda Guest remarks of the verse novel, Blood and Old Belief (2003) that 'Hetherington's writing is immaculate; he finds the hidden nuances at the core of each person', while Paul Kane characterises Hetherington's style in It Feels Like Disbelief (2007) as 'similarly lucid in voice, diction and image. This felicitous combination gives his poems the feel of poise, intelligence, grace and finish.' Peter Pierce comments that Six Different Windows (2013) is 'one the finest collections of poetry this year' and Mags Webster writes that Burnt Umber (2016) 'is a fine example of language ‚Äì and poetry ‚Äì \\"doing itself right\\"': 'If paintings can be \\"read\\" like text, then Hetherington's fusion of word and image bring to mind Howard Nemerov's suggestion that \\"both poet and painter want to reach the silence behind the language, the silence within the language\\". Hetherington's poems are tender, sometimes playful, sometimes self-deprecating, and in the case of 'Painting 22: Portrait of a Count', which appears in tribute to the poet's father, achingly poignant'.  As editor Paul Hetherington was co-editor in 1983 with Victor Bivoltsis and Andrew Masterson of a short-lived literary journal Perverse Pleasures. He became Associate Editor of Fremantle Arts Reviewin 1989 and editor of the magazine later that year. He was founding editor of Voices: the Quarterly Journal of the National Library of Australia from 1991 to 1997 and Editor of National Library of Australia News from 1990 to 2009. He was Poetry Editor of the Canberra Times from 1998 to 2000. From 2003 to 2006 Hetherington edited the final three volumes of the National Library of Australia's four-volume edition of the diaries of the Australian artist Donald Friend. Volume four of the published diaries covers Friend‚Äôs time in Bali and contains explicit accounts of sexual relations with children, several of whom are named. Hetherington has been reported as saying: \\"I don‚Äôt think Friend behaved in a way that would attract much criticism from people today, which at the time didn‚Äôt attract particular criticism either.\\" Hetherington says his comment was taken out of context: \\"I was referring to a range of his books but not the diaries [that] were edited and published ‚Ä¶ they are a rare documentary resource about the mid-20th century here and overseas, this does not mean that those involved in editing and publishing the diaries endorse all of Friend‚Äôs activities.\\"Quoted in Michaela Boland, \\"Art of Darkness\\", The Australian, October 2017. Republished as \\"Aussie spotlight on Donald Friend‚Äôs paedophelia: He lived here in sixties\\", The Island, 29 October 2017. and, to the ABC: \\"I don't know that we can today go into the complexity of the relationships between Friend and the young men and women who worked as houseboys ‚Äî essentially that's how he saw them ‚Äî in the 1960s and 1970s in Bali. Friend's activities and attitudes ‚Ä¶ throughout his life, and still to this day, [have] met with a wide range of responses ‚Ä¶ people are entitled and should make up their own minds about what they think of Friend and these activities and his artistic work.\\"Hetherington quoted in Antony Funnell, \\"Our favourite paedophile: Why is Donald Friend still celebrated?\\", ABC News, 2 February 2017. In a review in The Australian, of the diaries Frank Campbell wrote, \\"Hetherington politely observes, ‚ÄòFriend was entirely unsuited to a life of heterosexual monogamy.‚Äô Well, it‚Äôs all right Paul, he‚Äôs dead, so it‚Äôs safe to call Friend a paedophile.\\" Hetherington is recorded as saying on radio, > There are some things in the diaries obviously that some people will find > less attractive than others, but in publishing them, we wanted to publish > the diaries as they are, more or less, with the sensitivity that I talked > about earlier, because we think that it's important that people can read the > material for themselves and make their own mind up about them. In 2010 Hetherington was for a time the consultant Managing Editor to establish the National Library of Australia's project to publish in association with Australian Capital Equity, Pierre Bernard Milius: Last commander of the Baudin expedition: the journal 1800‚Äì1804. He is co-founding editor of the international online journal Axon: Creative Explorations (2011-) and a founding editorial committee member of the Meniscus journal (2013‚Äì). In 2014 he was co-editor with Shane Strange and Jen Webb of the scholarly book Creative Manoeuvres: Writing, Making, Being. In 2016 he was co-editor with Jen Webb of the bilingual Open Windows: Contemporary Australian Poetry ‚Äì An English-Chinese Anthology (transl Tao Naikan) and in that year he was co- poetry editor with Cassandra Atherton for the poems in a prose poem issue of Rabbit: A Journal for Nonfiction Poetry and a special issue of Cordite Poetry Review on ekphrastic poetry, published in March 2017.

It currently runs between the Antwerpen-Berchem railway station and the Melkmarkt in the city centre.  History  Originally, the route was operated as a horse-drawn omnibus route running between the Grote Markt and the Zurenborg neighborhood. At the start of the 20th century, the line was electrified and extended to the Eksterlaar neighborhood. Until the end of 1964, route 11 operated between Antwerp-Central station and Eksterlaar. Beginning January 1, 1965, the route was extended to the Melkmarkt, after tram route 16 (Melkmarkt-Luchtbal) was canceled. During a part of the 1990s, trams on route 11 used the premetro network via the entrance at the Mercatorstraat, due to construction works at the Ommeganckstraat. The TTB organization, representing commuters in Flanders, proposed in it plans to shorten route 11 to the Melkmarkt-Antwerpen-Berchem trajectory, and introduce a new tram route 18, running between the Melkmarkt and the Luchtbal neighborhood using the premetro network. This part of the plan was not executed at the time, however a new tram route 6 was introduced in 2006, connecting the Luchtbal and Olympiade neighborhoods.http://www.mobielvlaanderen.be/persberichten/artikel.php?id=224 Retrieved 10/06/2016 Following a redrawing of the Antwerp tram network on September 1, 2012, the route was eventually shortened to the Melkmarkt- Antwerpen-Berchem itinerary. A new route 9 since then connects the Eksterlaar terminus with Linkeroever via the southern and central premetro axes. At the same time, the frequency of service on the line was also reduced.  Future  There exist plans to extend ether route 9 or 11 in the future to a new terminus at Borsbeek, or at Antwerp Airport in Deurne.

As a Virtual Reality rhythm game, Holodance can be classified as fitness game due to the requirement to move your arms and often the full body to interact with the gameplay mechanics, giving players a \\"workout\\". The game has been available as Early access title on Steam since April 5, 2016. Gameplay Players interact with the rhythm of a song using their hands, which are tracked using motion controllers. There are currently three ways in which rhythm events are converted into gameplay: Catching orbs, following splines and spinning spinners. =Catching Orbs= This mechanic is used for percussive instruments and puts attention to the timing when an orb is caught. For each note from the instrument track currently played, one orb flies towards the player from a greater distance and arrives in hands' reach in front of the player the exact moment that the note starts playing in the song. This location is marked by the outline of a sphere that glows up and down so that players know when they have to catch the note with their hand, and where. If players catch the note, they receive score depending on how precisely they matched the rhythm, plus a bonus based on how fast they moved their hand before catching the note, and another bonus based on the rotation speed of their hand before catching the note. The locations where the orbs arrive can be used to create a dancing choreography for the player. However, this mechanic only defines where the players have to have their hands at certain times. How the player actually gets there is up to the player, so it can be dancing but it can also just be hitting orbs, allowing the players to find their own way of expressing themselves in the game. When the player misses a note, that specific instrument is muted until he catches the next. This mechanic that has since used by many other Virtual Reality rhythm games was inspired by a gamejam project called E-Motion and first made public by Holodance in July 2015. =Following Splines= Key screenshot of Holodance V0.8, in the environment \\"Virtual Clubbing\\", with gameplay (anime girl catching orbs). This mechanic is introduced in Level 4 of the story mode of Holodance. It is used for sustained instruments. The way this mechanic works is similar to catching orbs in the initial phase until a note starts: The floating spline flies towards the player from a distance and arrives near the player when the note starts. Once the note has started and is sustained, the player now has to keep following an orb that keeps moving along the spline path which is synchronized with the duration of the given note. That path starts when the note starts, and it ends when the note ends. The full spline path is visualized from the beginning, so the player knows where to move and by an orb following that path with the correct speed, the player also knows at what pace to move. This way, any hand movement could be choreographed. The score that players receive is calculated using how much of the time of the note their hand was actually inside the sphere while it moved along the path. This mechanic was first revealed in August 2015. =Spinning Spinners= This mechanic was inspired by osu! Spinners and implemented so that all mechanics of osu! beatmaps are also supported in Holodance. The main difference is that instead of moving their mouse, players need to spin the controller. =Combo Multipliers= Official Holodance V0.8 screenshot of the beach level (Level 01 in story mode). When players catch multiple notes without missing one, they get combo multipliers. After eight notes, the score of each successive note is multiplied with two. After sixteen notes, the multiplier is increased to three. Finally, after 48 notes without missing a single one, players receive the 4x multiplier. The game also has events after not missing a single note and catching 30% and 80% of the notes. How these effects are visualized is depending on the selected environment and not all environments support these events. Finally, a full combo, which means not missing a single note of the complete song triggers both an event and an achievement called No Note Missed.  Story and Environments  Official Holodance V0.8 screenshot of the first water level (Level 03 in story mode). In the story mode of Holodance, players experience environments on the land, in the air and underwater in various stages of environmental pollution. In the first three levels, the environment has not been touched by human influence, levels four, five and six illustrate mild pollution and the next three levels show severe impact of the influence of an industrialized human civilization. Other Virtual Reality projects use a similar approach (see).  Reception  Official Holodance V0.8 screenshot of the last water level (Level 07 in story mode).

By 1975, Diange's group was complete, and included members of Kadd Orchestra along with other Senegalese groups and musicians such as Omar Pene and Ismael L√¥. That new group, which was principally an amalgamation of various bands‚Äîcame to be known as \\"Super Diamono\\" (meaning \\"generation\\" in Wolof). Bob Sene (El Hadj \\"Bob\\" Sene), a bassist, is credited as the creator of Super Diamono, which in turn showcased the charismatic singers Omar Pene, Ismael L√¥ and Baaba Maal, then Mamadou Ma√Øga and Moussa Ngom.Arnaud, G√©rald; Lecomte, Henri; Musiques de toutes les Afriques, Fayard (2006), p.140 Diange's new group mostly consisted of musicians from Tropical Jazz and the Kadd Orchestra consisting mainly of Diagne's own family members. It was so family oriented that the group came to be referred to as the \\"Diange Ochestra\\" in its early years. In 1979 under a new name Super Diamono de Dakar, the group released their first album with Disques Griot (Griot Records) titled G√©√©dy Dayaan. Critics such as Mazzoleni describe the album as \\"a rather tasteless mixture of rock, reggae, synthetic strings and ‚ÄúAfrican percussion‚Äù influences\\" In the 1970s and 80s, the band was the biggest band in Senegal‚Äìtouring throughout West Africa. After years of working together, members left the group to create their own solo careers or set-up break-off groups such as Lemzo Diamono. Officially, the band broke up in 1991 but reassembled later by Pene. Since its founding, the band and Pene in particular have addressed issues of great interest to the youth, such as unemployment, corruption and inequality.

Diop refused to make any comment that would tarnish the image of the group, only saying that ethics does not allow him to say anything that could be detrimental to the Super Diamono group. He went on to say that having served the group for 22 years, he saw both good and bad, but has no desire to dwell on that separation. On the subject of his relationship with Omar Pene, Diop said: ‚ÄúWe had differences, but we did not fight. I know him better than anyone. He knows me, but I know him too. I call him my big brother.

Location and geology The hill rises above mean sea level and is just over southeast of the village of East Worldham, and approximately east of the town of Alton.Ordnance Survey 2004, 2006. The hill falls within the boundaries of the South Downs National Park. It is a greensand tor, with a flat top and steep sides; it is heavily wooded, with dense undergrowth. Description King John's Hill from the west The hillfort is unusually small, and its defences were weak; the site falls in a borderline category between larger hillforts and smaller defended settlements. It is oval in shape and encloses an area of approximately . Although it has suffered some damage by malm quarrying, it is still well preserved. Limited archaeological excavation revealed plentiful evidence of the hill's Iron Age occupation, later medieval remains, and post-medieval activity. The quarrying has destroyed the fort's defences on the north side of the hill, but they are elsewhere evidenced by two concentric scarps separated by a wide shelf. On the northeast side, a ridge line meets the fort, and was cut by a shallow ditch, which meets with a later boundary that runs around the base of the hill on the east side, and encloses a number of terraces on the lower slopes of the hill. Investigation The hill was partially excavated in 1939 and 1947. Ceramic fragments dating to the Iron Age were recovered, and two infilled storage pits were discovered. Evidence of the medieval occupation of the site was also revealed, including stonework and ceramics. Further remains date from the Tudor period, and include short lengths of wall, packed floors, bricks, tiles, and ovens. A ring-headed pin, fashioned from wire, was recovered from one of the Iron Age storage pits.De'athe 2013, pp. 12‚Äì13. Historic England 2015. The traditional association of the hill as a site of a medieval hunting lodge attributed to King John is supported by documentary evidence that a deer park existed at East Worldham at least as far back as 1372.

Refurbished in the 15th century, the church was restored in 1909-10. The interior has a notable collection of medieval wall paintings, in particular a Christ of the Trades, dating from c.1460. The church, although an active parish church, is currently closed for a significant repair programme. It is a Grade II* listed building and the architectural writer John Newman, recording the church in the Buildings of Wales series, described it as \\"one of the most interesting in the Usk Valley.\\" History The church is dedicated to St Cybi, a 6th-century Cornish saint who is reputed to have founded the church. The present church dates from either the 13th or the 14th century. The church was refurbished in the early 18th century and then restored in the early 20th century by W H Dashwood Caple. The wall paintings are medieval and include The Creed and a depiction of Christ of the Trades. Whitewashed over for centuries, they are currently (2017) being restored, as part of an extensive restoration of the church. Adam of Usk, the 15th-century priest and chronicler, was the incumbent of the parish in 1423. The churchyard is the site of the grave of the victims of a Spanish sailor, Josef Garcia, who was convicted and hanged for the murder of five members of the Watkins family, resident in the village, in a notorious 19th century murder case. Just outside the churchyard, are the remains of a Holy well, also dedicated to St Cybi. Recent scholarship suggests that the well, and the White Hart Inn in the village, were referenced by T.S. Eliot in his poem Usk. The relevant lines read: ::\\"Do not suddenly break the branch, or ::Hope to find ::The white hart behind the white well.\\" Architecture and description The style of the building is Perpendicular. The West Tower is two-storeyed and without buttresses. The medieval roof of the nave has been exposed during current renovations. Simon Jenkins described the early 20th century restoration of the interior as \\"masterly\\" and attributes it to W. D. Car√∂e. In addition to the medieval wall painting, the interior has a number of 17th century painted inscriptions. It also has some funerary monuments, including one dedicated to John Morgan, and dated 1805, by Tyley of Bristol. The monument depicts a woman crying over an urn under a spreading weeping willow. Opinions differ as to its quality; the record in British Listed Buildings describes it as \\"good\\", while Newman considers it \\"hackneyed.\\" The pulpit is a reconstructed example from the 18th century, with an associated sounding board to amplify the preacher's voice. The pews are of the 19th century, and the organ dates from 1933.

She founded and ran a home in Leytonstone for fallen girls called The Pastures.  Early life  Cotton was born in Leytonstone to the banker William and Sarah Cotton. Her siblings included the judge Henry Cotton, the philanthropist Sarah Acland, and the missionary William Cotton. Cotton was educated by her mother until she was 14, when she was sent to boarding school. Cotton fell ill at age 14, and after her recovery devoted herself to God. Letters written by her during the 1840s show that she followed the Oxford Movement. Life Cotton was considered to be a philanthropist by the time she was 18. She helped her sister Sarah Acland in her philanthropy projects and started to create her own projects to care for children in Leytonstone. Cotton often dressed in black and wore a veil, so the residents of Leytonstone thought her to be a nun. She was known to the locals as 'Sister Agnes.'  The Pastures  alt= The site of The Pastures today. In 1865 Cotton opened a children's home with an attached laundry for girls. This was expanded when she moved to The Cedars, a home once operated as an orphanage/school by the Methodist preacher Mary Bosanquet. She renamed the house 'The Pastures.' In about 1880 Cotton paid for an expansion of the existing building. The site in Leytonstone now included a chapel, industrial laundry, school and was known as the 'Home of the Good Shepherd' to differentiate it from 'The Pastures,' which was the former base. Previously Cotton's good works had been funded by herself, her family, and well wishers; in the 1880s the home attracted funding from the state. It was registered under the Criminal Law Amendment Act, although it was not a home for delinquent girls but a place of training in laundry work for girls who had been involved in prostitution. Rumors about harsh treatment inside of The Pastures began to spread in 1894. Rumors varied from stories about the girls being unsupervised, to abused, to stories about Cotton being too old for the job. The Home Office was called into investigate after Reverend A. Drew, a chairman of the London School Board, demanded an inquiry. Inspector William Inglis concluded that the rumors were false, and exonerated Cotton. Despise her exoneration, the London School Board cut ties with Cotton in 1895. Death and legacy Cotton died in Leytonstone on 20 May 1899 at The Pastures, and was buried with her family in St. John's Churchyard on 24 May. Cotton left monies for women who had assisted her, including Elizabeth Amelia Bragg, and her ward, Mary Agnes Hope. Cotton's home continued to operate until the Second World War under the management of the Community of St. John Baptist, Clewer. In 1940 the home was evacuated to Northampton, and after the war it was never reopened.

Early life and education Buckley Jr. was born in Bisbee, Arizona Territory, on May 17, 1902, to Michael and Barbara Lally Buckley and grew up in Coalinga, California, where he attended and graduated from, in 1919, Coalinga High School. Early military career In 1919, Buckley Jr. attended the United States Military Academy at West Point (New York) graduating with the class of 1923 and receiving his commission in the Field Artillery Branch of the United States Army. Prisoner of war In the fall of 1941, and while holding the rank of Major, Buckley Jr. was sent to Egypt as an observer of the British forces fighting against the combined Italian and German armies under the command of Field Marshal Erwin Rommel. On November 23, 1941, Buckley Jr. was with the 5th South African Brigade who were advancing on Tobruk when Rommel's panzer forces overran their position and he was captured. As an unarmed non-combatant, Buckley Jr. should have been released, but after Pearl Harbor (that occurred two weeks after his capture) he was interned in Italy until freed by a prisoner exchange in May 1942, thus making him the first American soldier to be held as a prisoner of war during World War II. World War II and later military service After being freed from German captivity, in May 1942, Buckley Jr. spent the remainder of World War II on the U.S. Army planning staff of General Lesley McNair in Washington, D.C., after which he then served in the Occupation of Japan. In 1953, while holding the rank of colonel, Buckley Jr. became Professor of Military Science and Tactics for the ROTC program at Santa Clara University, California, and where he retired from his military service in 1954. Educational career, family, and death After his retirement from the U.S. Army 1954, Buckley Jr. taught mathematics at Santa Clara University until 1968, and where he lived with his wife, the former Eleanor Fletcher, until her death in 1999 after 73 years of marriage.

Later guns removed from these ships were converted to coastal artillery and were used during World War I and World War II. The actual bore diameter was , but the classification system for artillery rounded up to the next highest centimeter. History The 24 cm SK L/40 was designed in 1894 and produced in 1898 by Krupp for the Imperial German Navy. Krupp also produced a variant of the 24 cm SK L/40 for the Austro-Hungarian Navy called the 24 cm L/40 K94 which armed coastal defense ships, pre-dreadnought battleships and armored cruisers. Skoda later produced the ≈†koda 24 cm L/40 K97 and the ≈†koda 24 cm L/40 K/01 under license. Krupp 24 cm guns also armed coastal defense ships of the Royal Netherlands Navy. Construction This was the first large caliber German naval gun to use a Krupp horizontal sliding- wedge breech block and separate loading metallic cased propellant charges and projectiles. Unlike other large naval guns of the time which used separate loading bagged charges and projectiles, this gun used charges inside of a brass cartridge case to provide obturation. The first twelve guns were constructed of an inner tube, two reinforcing layers of hoops and a jacket. Later guns had a third hoop added near the breech, which added of weight.

History The Woolston Memorial Hospital was formed from the expansion of a small Fuzhounese clinic run by a Methodist missionary within the walled city. It was located near Crow Pagoda Park in Gulou (). Originally, the hospital only accepted members of Christian churches to study on the medical course, however this rule was lifted in 1906 and a standard exam was put in place. Of the four girls to pass the exam in 1906, three were not Christian. In 1907, the head physician was forced to rest due to serious illness and it was suggested that the hospital should be closed. However, the physicians sister insisted that the hospital remain open for the public and its reputation slowly recovered under her management. As a Christian hospital, the Woolston held regular services and sought to convert its patients and visitors. A report made to the Foochow Woman's Conference of the Methodist Episcopal Church in 1915 records 30 new baptisms, 20 new full church members, and a total of 1,252 women who had been taken to the nearby church. The staff also campaigned against foot-binding and made an annual report of the number of women who had been persuaded to unbind their feet. In January 1927, thieves broke into the hospital and set fire to it. The entire building was burnt down. A Woolston Memorial Dispensary opened in 1930 in Longtian village () and at the Lucie F.

They presently house the local historical society museum, and were listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1987. Description and history The former town hall and district school stand in the village center of Morris, on the west side of South Street (Connecticut Route 61) opposite the village fire station. The town hall is a single-story wood frame structure with a gabled roof, clapboarded exterior, and stone foundation. A square belfry with pilastered corners, louvered openings, and pyramidal roof graces the roof ridge. The main facade has a pair of symmetrically placed entrances, each topped by a simple cornice. The school building is smaller, with a similarly clapboarded and gable-roofed exterior. It has original windows and plaster walls, but other interior features are replacements. The school building is the older of the two, built about 1772 and originally located some away, near King's Gristmill. It was moved a short distance in 1910 to make way for a reservoir, and continued use as a school until 1915. It was moved several times before landing here in 1981 for restoration. The town hall was built in 1861, and served the town until 1932, when the Morris Community Building, the present town hall, was built.

Lindsay Almond Jr. split with the Byrd Organization and agreed to reopen schools after decisions by the Virginia Supreme Court and a 3-judge federal district court panel on January 19, 1959, the Perrow Commission was formed to transition. In the next Democratic primary election, however Perrow faced opposition, and lost his bid for re-election to fellow Democrat Bert F. Dodson. However, Republican Burruss narrowly defeated Dodson in the general election (6904 votes to 6694), and so succeeded Perrow to what was then the 12th senatorial district seat in 1964.Virginia election database 1963 His father (R.S.

After the 1970 census, redistricting added Bedford County and the city of Bedford, and renumbered the district as the 23rd. Burruss again won re-election until 1975 (rising to minority leader).

His brother-in-law, Carl Carlsson M√∂rner (1755‚Äì1821) served as Governor-general of Norway. He was raised to take over the successful trading company Tottie & Arfwedson of his father and grandfather, and made several study trips abroad. One of them was made to the French firm Clary in Marseilles, where he spent some time employed in the company of Clary, whose daughter D√©sir√©e Clary was eventually to be the queen consort of Sweden. He returned to Sweden permanently in 1808 and took over the company as director upon the death of his father in 1826. He was elected to serve as director of the Swedish East India Company for a period. During the 1810s, he owned the villa Listonhill in Stockholm, which was for a period a center of the burgher upper class society life in the capital. Carl Abraham Arfwedson is also known for his etchings. In 1787, he became a student of Jacob Gillberg (1724-1793) at the Royal Swedish Academy of Fine Arts.

It used an innovative coiled spring suspension system that allowed the cars to lean into curves, thus increasing passenger comfort during high speed travel. PERC built three cars which were tested on American railroads throughout the 1940s, but the advent of World War II, and their high cost relative to conventional equipment, prevented their wider adoption.  Design  Illustration from showing the coiled-spring suspension system. The design of the pendulum car was strongly influenced by the 1930s aviation engineering. Its chief designer, William E. Van Dorn, was an aeronautical engineer from California Institute of Technology. Two other engineers on the project, Eliot F. Stoner and Herbert J. Wieden, had worked for Northrop Aircraft. The primary innovation in the pendulum car was in the design of the truck. The body of the car rested on coiled springs, which were in turn attached to the truck. This placed the car body, and the passengers, above the center of gravity. As the car entered curves, it could \\"tilt\\" or swing. As the designers described in a paper presented at the annual conference of the American Society of Mechanical Engineers in 1940: The prototype, completed in 1937, differed in many respects from the production model. It was constructed from plywood instead of steel, used stressed skin construction, and lacked \\"most of the usual auxiliary equipment of passenger cars.\\" This contributed to the comparatively low weight of . The two-unit articulated coach measured long. The production model was a standard long and weighed . The increased weight came from the stressed skin steel construction (instead of plywood), and the standard auxiliary equipment. Interior seating capacity ranged from 56‚Äì68. The distinctive oval or oblong windows were designed to reduce stress concentrations.  History  The articulated prototype in 1937. The pendulum car was the brainchild of William E. Van Dorn. Financial backing came from Cortlandt T. Hill, grandson of railway magnate James J. Hill. They, along with F. C. Lindvall, an electrical engineering professor at Caltech, formed the Pacific Railway Equipment Company in 1935 to explore Van Dorn's concept. PERC acquired a factory near Los Angeles Municipal Airport (now Los Angeles International Airport) and constructed a two-car articulated prototype. The prototype was unveiled on December 22, 1937, and began tests on the Atchison, Topeka and Santa Fe Railway (Santa Fe). The prototype spent several years running over the Santa Fe's lines in Southern California. The suspension system worked: the car rode far better than conventional designs. Life reported that it was \\"virtually vibrationless\\" at , and \\"quite comfortable\\" at . Three railroads ordered production versions of the pendulum car: the Santa Fe, the Chicago, Burlington and Quincy Railroad (CB&Q;), and the Great Northern Railway (GN). The Santa Fe's, 1100, was delivered in November 1941. It seated 56, with the additional space going to men's and women's bathrooms at opposite ends of the car. The CB&Q; and GN cars arrived in early 1942. The CB&Q; car, numbered 6000 and named Silver Pendulum, seated 60. GN numbered its car 999; it could seat 68. The introduction of the cars coincided with the entrance of the United States into World War II. As the cars arrived they entered service with their respective railroads. The Santa Fe employed No. 1100 on the El Capitan. The three cars came together for a special run on April 13, 1942, between Chicago and Galesburg, Illinois, on April 13, 1942. The cars operated together with a lightweight and a heavyweight coach, and attained a maximum speed of . The railroads did not pursue the pendulum design after the war, for reasons which remain unclear. Most authors point to the expense of the design, with the interruption of the war as a complicating factor. The Pacific Railway Equipment Company, rebranded as Preco, found success building fans for refrigerator cars. The cars remained in service until their natural retirement. The Santa Fe assigned No. 1100 to the San Diegan. By 1958 CB&Q; No. 6000, pulled by a motorcar, served on an unnamed connection of the Kansas City Zephyr. Neither the prototype nor any of the production cars were preserved.

In his autobiography Lobzang Gyatso, using his keen eye for detail and character, keeps his readers informed of Norbu's antics and failures in his various roles over the years.Karmay 2014, pp. 68-435 While only a few histories covering this period even mention Depa Norbu in passing, his iniquitous activities are best described in Lobzang Gyatso‚Äôs autobiography. Fifth Dalai Lama's observations Lobzang Gyatso first mentions Norbu as attending a tea party in 1626, invited by the young Tulku Dragpa Gyaltsen (1619-1656) next door at Drepung Monastery ('). The host offered Norbu a ceremonial scarf with a sacred knot but Norbu later undid the knot and exchanged the scarf for some baubles from Kongpo. A monk attendant observed: 'Norbu has no faith in the Tulku'.Karmay 2014, p. 68 Norbu is alleged by some, including Trijang Rinpoche, to have suffocated the same Tulku thirty years later with a similar scarf. A little later Lobzang Gyatso caught the measles and ‚Äòmany cats were brought to keep him awake‚Äô, apparently as an antidote; Norbu would beat these cats and even stabbed one with a knife. Lobzang Gyatso commented on this cruelty: 'it was the first crowing of a man who would eat man [sic] if he had power'. Early in 1638, acting as Drepung's Treasurer in a project for each Gelugpa monastery to construct new sets of the Eight Classical Stupas ('), Norbu insisted on changing the proportions of the Drepung set, which had been designed by master Zurchen Choying Rangdrol. This resulted in their shape being the worst of all, including those of Sera (') and Ganden (') monasteries.Karmay 2014, p. 135 Shortly afterwards Sonam Rapten was displeased with his chief assistant Jaisang Depa (') who eventually became the Fifth Dalai Lama's third Regent in 1660; he wanted to appoint Norbu in his place, but Lobzang Gyatso was not happy about it. He objected and vetoed Norbu's promotion. In the summer of 1638, Norbu married Tulku Dragpa Gyaltsen's sister at Gekhasa (') village in Tolung ('), probably modern-day 'Gyekhar' between Yangpachen (') and Tsurphu (').Schweiger 2015, p. 39Karmay 2014, p. 135 The heirs to the Gekhasa family had been killed by Mongols so they needed a male groom but Lobzang Gyatso felt Norbu was a poor choice, commenting that the family accepted him \\"as if it wished to be punished\\". After this, Norbu was also called 'Gekhasapa Norbu', 'Gekhasapa', 'Gekhasa' and 'Gekha'.Karmay 2014, pp. 66, 403, 409 etc. According to another history, the Tulku's sister, his only surviving sibling, felt obliged to marry the ambitious Norbu, who was proud of being Desi Sonam Rapten's brother. Norbu was not well-off but he was an opportunist and the marriage increased his wealth and status, enabling him to enter politics; he then became notorious for the violent and unscrupulous ways in which he later dealt with certain practical issues on the regent‚Äôs behalf that were embarrassing for a high-ranking religious dignitary like Sonam Rapten.Bultrini 2013, Part 4 In 1652 Lobzang Gyatso, invited by the Chinese emperor, left for Beijing and amongst others Norbu accompanied his party a far as the foot of the Nyuglai Lanying pass. Everyone going to China was apprehensive about the diseases and other dangers of the perilous journey, wrote Lobzang Gyatso, but Norbu, who was to remain in Lhasa, and seemingly convinced that nobody would be returning, was delighted that he did not have to go and he did not hide his pleasure.Karmay 2014, p. 270 In 1654 Lobzang Gyatsho proposed to offer a public long-life wang ('), a major personal blessing, to all his followers, aware that it would be very popular. The Desi agreed but Norbu started drawing up a tariff of fees to charge everyone for attending the event, according to their status. Lobzang Gyatsho felt embarrassed but rather than rebuking Norbu for his cupidity he simply gave up the idea, not wishing to appear greedy by charging people to attend his teachings.Karmay 2014, pp. 335-336 In 1656 Lobzang Gyatsho was busy organising various religious projects, creating murals, statues, multiple copies of the Buddha‚Äôs teachings and so forth. A sculptor called Dol Nesarwa (') had neatly carved a complete set of ritual phurba (') daggers from teakwood for him and was working on other themes when Norbu suddenly had him transferred to the south of Tibet to help construct military catapults. Lobzang Gyatsho lamented that Norbu made this artist, incapable of doing anything harmful, suddenly disappear from his project staff.Karmay 2014, p. 362 A little later in 1656 Norbu gets a positive mention, the only one he earns in Lobzang Gyatso's autobiography. Diplomatic tensions with Nepal necessitated the rescue of a special statue of 'the exalted Vati', a form of Chenrezig, from Kyirong temple near the Nepal border. Norbu and Dronnyer Drungpa (') were deputed to go there and retrieve it and they actually succeeded in doing so. Lobzang Gyatso noted this success as an auspicious occasion. However, he refers to a prophecy warning that the relocation of the statue to central Tibet could portend the death of an important personage. Next mentioned in the autobiography is the illness and death of Tulku Dragpa Gyaltsen aged 36.Karmay 2014, p. 363-365 His spirit is then said to have manifested as the spirit Shugden ('), and some, including Trijang Rinpoche, allege that he was murdered by suffocation at the hands of Depa Norbu. Military commander, 1641-1643 In 1641, during the Tibetan civil war, Norbu was deputed to lead a body of troops west from Shun, six miles east of Lhasa, via upper Tolung to reinforce Gushri Khan's Mongol army besieging the fort at Shigatse. Avoiding Kagyu resistance en route he progressed at a snail's pace, finally reaching Chushur (') on the north bank of the Tsangpo (') after dawdling along and losing time. His men eventually engaged in battle in Tsang (') under Gopa Tashi of Drungme ('). Some were assigned to operate cannons, others to take positions on hilltops. However, Norbu refused to do anything and when the cannon station was lost to the enemy he was the first man to leave his post and run away.Karmay 2014, pp. 158-159 In the summer of 1642 during the first uprising in Tsang after the war he was charged with holding Gyantse fort (') but when a small group of rebels attacked he abandoned it and fled.Karmay 2014, p. 175Shakabpa 2010, p. 348 In 1643, to quell another rebellion in Kongpo ('), east of Lhasa, Sonam Rapten despatched an army under the joint leadership of Norbu and Tardong Donnyer ('). The latter complained it was more like a boss and his servant, rather than co-commanders.Karmay 2014, p. 185 Governor of Shigatse, 1644-1659 Regent Sonam Rapten appointed Norbu as Governor of Shigatse in 1644. Lobzang Gyatso wrote that most people began to call him 'Desi' or 'Depa' and he put on airs of being the Regent's brother.Karmay 2014, p. 187 'Depa' ('Governor' or 'Commissioner') was in current use but 'Desi' (Regent, Administrative Ruler or Prime Minister) was hardly used during Lobzang Gyatso's lifetime; it was only retrospectively applied to his Regents from the early 18th century.Richardson 1998, pp. 448-449. Norbu retained this post until 1659.Karmay 2014, p. 401 Military investigator, 1646 In 1644 Sonam Rapten, angered by Bhutan‚Äôs support for the rebellions of 1642/43, and imagining that his victorious, combined Tibetan/Mongolian forces were invincible, despatched an army to punish and if possible capture Bhutan but to his surprise it was easily routed by the Bhutanese defense forces.Aris 1980, p. 224Shakabpa 1984, p. 112 Bhutan was founded by 'Zhabdrung' Ngawang Namgyel (zhabs drung ngag dbang rnam rgyal, 1594-1651) of the Drukpa Kagyu tradition, who had fled Tibet in 1616 over a dispute concerning his claimed status as the incarnation of the Fourth Drukchen, Padma Karpo ('brug chen pad+ma dkar po, 1527-1592). Once welcomed into exile by the Bhutanese the Zhabdrung assumed national leadership by popular acclaim and consolidated the Himalayan country into its modern form. He was renowned as a tantric magician having allegedly attained spiritual powers which he used inter alia to protect Bhutan against such invasions from Tibet, of which this was the fourth attempt he had successfully faced but the first from the new Geluk government; the first three had been from the king of Tsang.Phuntsho 2013, pp. 207-238Aris 1979, pp. 201-226 This surprise defeat became a popular topic for mockery of Tibet's new Geluk regime in Lhasa.Phuntsho 2013, p. 240 In 1646 Norbu was sent south to the Bhutan border to investigate the humiliating rout. Norbu returned to report inter alia that the Bhutanese had indeed captured twenty five Tibetan army officers including the three most senior commanders and all the army's weapons, armour and equipment.Aris 1980, pp. 224-226 A satirical song then became popular using word-play to mock Norbu, the new Governor of Shigatse, for acting as a common spy (Tibetan: ‚Äò'‚Äô), playing on his earlier title, ‚ÄòNangso‚Äô ('border protector'), on his name Norbu ('jewel'), on the Zhabdrung's renown as a magician as the lama in the south and finally on the precious vertebrae relic of the First Drukchen Tsangpa Gyare Yeshe Dorje (gtsang pa rgya ras ye shes rdo rje, 1161-1211, founder of Ralung monastery and the Drkpa Kagyu tradition), which was brought from Tibet by the Zhabdrung:Shakabpa 2010, pp. 350-351 > \\"The lama must be residing in the south, For all offerings [armour, weapons > etc.] were made to the south. The Drukpas have captured Nidup [Ngodrup, one > of the Tibetan officers: also spiritual powers]; Norbu [jewel, i.e. the > vertebrae relic] has worked as a spy [protector, as in protective deity or > spirit]\\".Phuntsho 2013, pp. 241-242Aris 1980, p. 226 Army commander, 1648-1649 Sonam Rapten negotiated a post-1644 invasion peace treaty with Bhutan, obtaining release of the hostages, but then broke it in 1648 by sending in a much bigger, three-pronged invasion force. He appointed Norbu as commander of the main army, marching east from Shigatse via Phagri (') to Paro (') in western Bhutan where he tried to attack the fort. Each time the Bhutanese counter-attacked, Norbu is variously described as having fled, escaped in terror, deserted, lost his saddle and took flight to Phagri followed by his troops. He retreated to Tibet with his men following, once again abandoning all their arms, weapons and equipment. Hearing of this, the other two columns retreated from Punakha and headed home, making a fiasco of the attempted invasion. Norbu was left with a common tent, his elaborate and costly one having been captured. There were various uncomplimentary stories about him. Due to his mistakes, the army even had great difficulty retreating and the other commanders made endless complaints about his behaviour. This shameful defeat went down as disgraceful in the history of Tibet. Tibetans rebuked Norbu for his cowardice and made a mockery of his flight, as Lobzang Gyatsho later noted. Despite all this, under his brother's protection he retained his position as Governor of Shigatse.Phuntsho 2013, pp. 244-247Shakabpa 1984, p. 113Shakabpa 2010, p. 352Karmay 2014, p. 215Aris 1979, p. 227 Norbu was even accused of betrayal, indulging in secret dealings with the Bhutanese enemy, but despite his incompetence, cowardice and duplicity Lobzang Gyatsho tried to come to terms with him, hoping that he might yet turn out to be a good leader.Karmay 2014, pp. 5, 6 Commander-in-Chief, 1656-57 After Gushri Khan's death in 1655 Sonam Rapten organised one last attempt at capturing Bhutan to obliterate the memory of his earlier defeats and suppress Kagyu resistance against the Geluk, a constant threat to internal stability.Tucci 1949, p. 71Richardson 1998, p. 450Phuntsho 2013, pp. 261-262 He appointed Norbu as overall commander of four large invading armies but Norbu, involved in a plot with the Bhutanese, asked Lobzang Gyatso to have the invasion postponed. Seeing no purpose in this and knowing Sonam Rapten and other leaders would not agree, he refused; there was also no indication from divinations or oracles to delay.Karmay 2014, pp. 368-369Phuntsho 2013, p. 262 Norbu advanced in the summer of 1656, but too slowly and cautiously and his tactics were inept. Nechung Oracle had predicted success but later blamed the failure on his incompetence; Lobzang Gyatso also criticised him for not sticking to the agreed plan. As he continued to employ cowardly delaying tactics his army gradually wasted away through illness.Karmay 2014, p. 374 The Bhutanese used guerrilla tactics to sap morale and after an entire year of ineffective campaigning in the inhospitable climate and the dense jungles Norbu retreated to Tibet and camped near the border at Phagri, unable to make a decision. Internal divisions also arose, due to Norbu‚Äôs poor leadership. The two Mongol princes with their own troops, Dalai Batur (') and Machik Taiji ('), quarrelled with Norbu about his cowardly tactics and Norbu is said to have poisoned the latter after he severely criticised Norbu's policy. One of Norbu‚Äôs men, Taglung Mentrongpa ('), wrote to Sonam Rapten to defend Norbu and blame the Mongols, claiming they would not care if everyone in Tibet died. Lobzang Gyatso, however, disagreed and defended the Mongols and their good character; they were simply too ashamed to have to retreat from battle under Norbu's orders.Karmay 2014, p. 375 The Samye oracle had been consulted beforehand and advised against the invasion. When asked again, whether the army should retreat or advance, it replied that since they had not taken its advice before they should not ask again. It advised to ask 'the Geshe' since he, the oracle, had no idea.Shakabpa 2010, p. 361 Norbu's behaviour was dubious; he let himself be defeated and his army retreated from Phagri in disgrace after the disastrous campaign.Tucci 1949, p. 70 Eventually, a peace treaty was negotiated by the Panchen Lama and others, allowing for the release of prisoners by the Bhutanese. Thus ended the third Geluk-Bhutan war involving Norbu.Phuntsho 2013, p. 263 There had been many instances of Norbu's botched leadership but he was never held to account and his brother Sonam Rapten pretended not to hear about it. In the end, however, the proliferation of negative reports from his stint in Shigatse and his dishonest activities became so notorious that he was publicly censured. Appointed as Regent, 1659 Sonam Rapten died in the spring of 1658Karmay 2014, pp. 383-384 but Lobsang Gyatso kept it a secret to hold off political instabilityDhondup 1984, p. 32 while he arranged the succession by Norbu, heir apparent, in such a way that Norbu would be unable to dominate him.Karmay 2014, p. 384 et seq. For 13 months this pretence was maintained while prayers and rituals were carried out, ostensibly dedicated to Sonam Rapten's return to health,Karmay 2014, pp. 384-395 until the spring of 1659 when the death was announced and funeral rites were carried out in Sonam Rapten's honour.Karmay 2014, pp. 395-399 Soon Lobzang Gyatso nominated Depa Sepo ('), a friend and associate of Norbu to replace Norbu as Governor of Shigatse; he then spent eight days negotiating discretely with 'the Two Royal Brothers', the Mongol successors of Gushri Khan, Tendzin Dayan Gyalpo (bstan ‚Äòdzin da yan rgyal po) and Tendzin Dalai Han (bstan ‚Äòdzin da la‚Äôi tan rgyal po), to ensure and arrange their support in case of need, probably making contingency plans in case Norbu got too out of control after his promotion. The Mongols left Lhasa to stand by at their pastures in Dam (')to the north, just before Norbu arrived from Shigatse. Lobzang Gyatso observed that Norbu appeared to be 'an impressively natural leader' but whether this was noted mockingly or not is unclear.Karmay 2014, p. 402 Two weeks later, on the 16th of the 6th month of the Earth-pig year (i.e. around late July, 1659), Lobzang Gyatso told his chamberlain to go and inform Norbu that he was to be appointed as Regent to succeed the late Sonam Rapten. The surprised chamberlain hesitated, saying that if this was simply a tactful gesture he risked it being accepted by Norbu which would not have been appropriate. But Lobzang Gyatso insisted that he was serious, the message was delivered and Norbu accepted. Next day, Lobzang Gyatso sent a second message to Norbu, scolding him for having failed in the past to do his duty well. Then, he restricted Norbu's powers regarding the Regent's official residence, preventing him from using it for personal ends. All this would have been hard to bear for Norbu who was used to doing as he liked with impunity under his now deceased brother's protection.Karmay 2014, p. 403 There was no inauguration ceremony apart from a gathering of important teachers and monks at the Potala to pay respects to Norbu. Lobzang Gyatso mocked this elite as being learned in religion but ignorant of worldly affairs, suggesting perhaps that there was more to Norbu's appointment than met the eye. It was apparently expected there would be exchanges of gifts, but Norbu, he wrote, was as selfish as the Taglung treasurer: they merely exchanged vases of water. Reign as Regent, 1659 There is no account of Norbu's activities in office but Lobzang Gyatso describes how later that summer he received imperial messengers himself and negotiated with them regarding gifts and diplomas they wanted to offer to the old king of Yarlung.Karmay 2014, pp. 403-404 Then in the 8th month Lobzang Gyatso had a project workshop set up to create a new crown for the special statue of Chenrezig (') called Rangjon Ngaden ('). Earlier, Sonam Rapten had prevented him from doing so and he had been obliged to postpone the project but now he did so without reference to Norbu.Karmay 2014, p. 406 In the same month Lobzang Gyatso notes a delay in the agreed departure of the previous occupiers of the official Gekhasa residence, preventing Norbu from moving in. He also notes that this was the time when Ngodrup ('), Tregang Tsering (') and other close associates of Norbu's were all about to hatch a plot against him.Karmay 2014, p. 405 Rebellion of 1659-60 On the eve of the Earth-pig New Year (1659) there had been severe disruption to the end-of-year rites by spirits and Lobzang Gyatso wrote that it presaged the coming conflict with Norbu and his associate Ngodrup.Karmay 2014, p. 391 In the 9th month of 1659-1660, he consulted Nojin Chenpo ('), the wrathful spirit which had been oath-bound and installed at Samye Monastery by Padmasambhava (') 800 years before. The spirit warned him: ‚ÄúIf you do not care about Norbu, it will be as if you fail to act when the goat is in its enclosure; you will not catch it, [he will be] like a musk deer running away on the rocks.‚Äù In the 10th month, the plot began to thicken. Norbu's relatives and close associates, his nephew Ngodrup and family asked permission to visit hot springs in Tsang. Lobzang Gyatso allowed it, while suspicious of their motives. Then, with the connivance of new Shigatse governor Depa Sepo, they and other accomplices such as Tregangpa (') seized and occupied Shigatse fort in an open act of rebellion against the Gaden Phodrang government. Lesser officials unwilling to join the revolt were dismissed and expelled from the fort. In Lhasa, Lobzang Gyatso had many visitors expressing sympathy and support and the protector spirit Nechung (') warned that Norbu himself was escaping, in accordance with the spirit Nojin Chenpo's prediction. Revenue collectors in the south then reported seeing Norbu heading west. Evidently, he had deserted his post and gone to join his co-conspirators in Tsang.Karmay 2014, pp. 410-411 Norbu's rebellion was supported by the Tsang nobility, the Sakya hierarch and the Fourth Drukchen, Padma Karpo. Shigatse‚Äôs close affiliation with the Tsangpa regime, the previous rulers of central Tibet, and with the Karma Kagyu tradition, made it the ideal location from which to instigate a rebellion against the Geluk government. Any disturbance in Tsang was bound to cause alarm. In an additional act of treachery, Norbu's co- conspirator Tregangpa was sent south to persuade the Bhutanese enemy to send their army to enter Tibetan territory and join the rebel army against the Lhasa government.Karmay 2009, p. 514 Lobzang Gyatso sent investigators to check on the situation in Shigatse. They reported that Depa Sepo had improperly dismissed all officials unwilling to join the revolt, Tregangpa had intimidated Tashilhunpo and the revenue collectors and Norbu and Ngodrup had seized control of the fort.Karmay 2014, p. 411 Hearing this, Lobzang Gyatso summoned his loyal ministers and generals, including Jaisang Depa and Dronnyer Drungpa, for a council of war. They decided to send an expeditionary force to Shigatse forthwith. Taiji of Ukhere, a Mongolian prince who had, conveniently, just arrived from the north with a hundred soldiers and gifts of gold, silver, silk and porcelain, agreed to march his men to Shigatse right away and Dronnyer Drungpa was detailed to guide him. Two army commanders were appointed and orders for the rapid mobilisation and despatch of additional forces were issued.Karmay 2014, p. 412Tucci 1949, p. 72 Rituals of suppression and liberation based on the violent rite of Jampel Layshin Marmo (') were carried out, led by the chief officiating prelate Ngagrampa Lobzang Dondrub ('), and signs of success occurred Meanwhile the Shigatse fort officials and Lobzang Geleg ('), Treasurer of Tashilhunpo, who had all been expelled by Depa Sepo, were keeping Lhasa informed about the goings-on at the fort, and advised that Trashi Tsepa of Shang ('), near Shigatse, was proving very helpful, providing the army with useful advice and information.Karmay 2014, pp. 412-413 Others, however, had defected to the rebels. The 89-year old Panchen Lama, still in Shigatse and trying to negotiate a compromise, corresponded with Lobzang Gyatsho who concluded, after discussion, that the impending conflict with Norbu's rebels could not be postponed. Meanwhile, more rituals were being carried out to bring Norbu down, with signs of success: when the torma was hurled to the west a windstorm arose and the torma flamed and splintered.Karmay 2014, pp. 413 When the Panchen Lama sent negotiators to lobby for buying off Norbu and his rebels with forts and estates, thereby avoiding the use of force, Lobzang Gyatso was not impressed. Recounting Norbu‚Äôs history of misdeeds to the negotiators derisively, he roundly mocked and scornfully dismissed their proposals. They tried to intimidate him but it was 'like displaying a mask to a child'; he was unimpressed and dealt with the negotiators 'as if treating an illness' before sending them away. Lobzang Gyatso had decided to 'combine the two traditions': a show of military force to scare the rebels and a series of magic rituals perhaps designed to terrify the more superstitious amongst them.Karmay 2014, pp. 413-414 In the 11th month Ganden Monastery's Abbot, Damcho Namgyal ('), accompanied by a distinguished delegation including a former Ganden Tripa obtained an audience with Lobzang Gyatsho, claiming to be Norbu‚Äôs brother and lobbying on his behalf. He even claimed the award of some property, landed estates, for Norbu and his henchmen, if not for himself. This annoyed Lobzang Gyatso severely and, knowing very well that Norbu had no such brother, after deriding the abbot‚Äôs petition on various counts he dismissed it with contempt.Karmay 2014, p. 414 Meanwhile Taiji of Ukhere had reached Shigatse fort to find Tregangpa had returned from his mission to Bhutan and fortified the areas around the castle. In the clashes that followed as the Taiji's men tried to extract the defenders, Tregangpa was captured and brought out 'like a lamb to the slaughter'. The plan to recapture the fort was put into operation.Karmay 2014, p. 415 First, the Two Royal Mongol Brothers, Tendzin Dayan Gyalpo and Tendzin Dalai Han, now arrived on the scene in Shigatse with their forces. It would appear that this was not a coincidence. Shortly before Norbu had arrived in Lhasa from Shigatse a few months earlier they had met Lobzang Gyatsho for eight days of detailed conversations concerning leadership, history and 'matters of concern to the Mongols'. Considering the incompatibility and animosity between Norbu and the Mongols following the three military debacles in Bhutan it is likely that they were preparing contingency plans in case things went awry with Norbu after his expected promotion to Desi. They left for their pastures in Dam, Norbu arrived and was appointed, he later deserted and made Shigatse the base of his rebellion and now the Mongols turned up there with their armies as if they had been ready and waiting for it. While backed up by their armed forces they assumed the role of impartial mediators. Norbu and Ngodrup assured them that they, the brothers, had been deceived by Lobzang Gyatsho‚Äôs aides, and to maintain their posture as mediators the brothers pretended to believe it. The second part of the strategy, magic ritual, was also unfolding. Lobzang Gyatsho detailed the government‚Äôs chief ritual officiator, the Nyingmapa Trulku Dorjedrag Rigdzin (') the 4th and his team of 30 assistants to go to Gongkar (') and perform the rite of the wind wheel for accomplishing strategic policy, the defeat of Norbu‚Äôs rebellion, through suppression and destruction. There was a sign of success: the wind wheel rapidly produced flames. Similar success was signified by the Trulku after he had the same rites carried out by the men of Palri (') at Chonggye (‚Äò'). The physician Lobzang Norbu Palden of Pusang (') then violently cursed Norbu and Ngodrup whilst performing the atonement rite of Palden Dungkyongma ('). Lobzang Gyatso then consulted ‚ÄòKing spirit' Tshangpa Dungthochen ('), through its oracle, to see what it suggested. To defeat Norbu's rebellion and promote loyalty to the government it specified the Du-dog (') rite to be performed by all members of Geluk establishments that were philosophical in nature and the Tor-dog (') by the rest. In the context of this rebellion the purpose of publicly propitiating, in this way, loyalty to the Tibetan government, including in Mongolia, seems clear: any superstitious members of the Tibetan public who sympathised with Norbu and his rebels might have second thoughts if the threat of supernatural retribution was brought into the equation. The lamas and stewards of two hundred and fifty monasteries were ordered to carry out these services nonstop and the government funded all the participants' tea offerings three times a day.Karmay 2014, p. 416 Lhatsun Kunzang Namgyal of Dzogchen (') revealed the ritual cycle of Yizhin Norbu Sai Nyingpo (') in Demojong ('), Sikkim, and sent the relevant texts to Lobzang Gyatso. The latter empowered the Namgyal Monastery monks to perform the rite of Nojin Begtse ('), the originally pre-Buddhist female wrathful deity and lord of war of the Mongols that wears a coat of mail, and began to perform its destructive rite himself. This involved hurling the wind wheel and the torma, which moved like a malevolent torma, repeatedly flashed, spontaneously burst into flames and produced various other remarkable signs of success. Lobzang Gyatso now invoked Nojin Chenpo again and the spirit responded through its oracle to declare that they, the eight categories of arrogant deity-demons, wanted to go to Nyangme (') [the lower valley of the Nyang Chu, i.e. Shigatse area] for the battle and that an auspicious sign, ritual armour, weapons and musical instruments were needed. These were amply provided and Lobzang Gyatso urged them to take action through transforming the rebels, Norbu and Ngodrup and Tregangpa, into their 'red meals'. To this effect, he also wrote a letter to the spirit. The names of the rebels were placed in the skull-cup of Dorje Phagmo ('). The deity Tsen-go Tawara (') was also invoked, and demanded and got offerings of ritual armour and weapons, and a scarf. Lobzang Gyatso was about to perform a destructive rite based on Namchag Urmo (') when a messenger came from the Dragna Choje ('), Dharma master or rituals Master of Changchub Ling ('), a Nyingma monastery in Chushur which had been founded by Lobzang Gyatsho in 1651 to maintain the ritual practices in his absence. He expected the message would be about how to perform a destructive rite but it was instead a long message stating how Norbu and Ngodrup were in the right. Lobzang Gyatso, clearly exasperated, declined to even reply and, contrary to custom, the messenger was sent back without being given any food.Karmay 2014, p. 417 More rituals were undertaken, with frequent signs of success: sudden windstorms arising, ritual wheels bursting into flames, tormas flashing and the like. In Kyisho, the Lhasa valley, the performance of rituals intensified. Renowned tantric sorcerers such as Chingpa Ngagrampa (') were commissioned by Lobzang Gyatsho to increase pressure on the rebels. Nyingma artists Agur (') of Zhikashar (') and his brother Ngagwang Trinle (') drew the wind wheels of Lungmar (') (the ‚ÄòRed Wind‚Äô deity) and Begtse and the rite was performed immaculately; also at Luphug ('). Others were sent to shoot the torma of Lungmar towards Tsang where Norbu was installed and to place the wheel of Begtse at the corner of the Potala‚Äôs temple hall. As soon as they began the wheel rite, a powerful windstorm broke out each day. Even where negotiations were being held at Shigatse the felt tent was nearly overturned by a storm. Others reported having to have their food well before noon since from midday until sunset, due to the gale the only thing they could do was to pull down the lower parts of the tent and hold them down with heavy objects. Similar effects continued to occur, windstorms and so forth being attributed to the presence or wrathful deities and spirits manifesting their power and intent. In support of the tantric rites, the thousands of monks of the three great monasteries and others, provided with tea and rations by the government, recited the sutras. Other rites, both tantric and sutric, are described by Lobzang Gyatsho as taking place elsewhere, all aimed at propitiating a peaceful resolution to the conflict. All this must have created a tremendous amount of gossip and speculation amongst the superstitious populace as they wondered about what would happen to the rebels under this tremendous onslaught of destructive rituals.Karmay 2014, pp. 417-418 Indeed Lobzang Gyatso noted laconically that since the rebels and officials in the fort were deeply superstitious, they 'accordingly perceived disturbances'.Karmay 2014, p. 430 Superstitious attitudes and spirit-fear may have not only dampened support for the rebels from the people of Tsang and Bhutan but also caused the rebels themselves to lose heart, negotiate and abandon Shigatse fort. In the second twelfth month monks led by the Dragna Choje ('), rituals master of Drepung, performed the rites of protection, aversion, liberating and suppression based on the deity Jampal Mei Putri ('). The idea of the rebels being bought off with landed property recurred again. Rumours circulated that Norbu would probably be given Khartse (') fort in Phenyul (') and that of Maldro Gungkar (') would go to Ngodrup. A negotiated settlement seemed to be on the cards, when all of a sudden it is simply stated that Norbu and Ngodrup, after handing over the fort to the commanders of the government forces, left for Samdrup Dechen (') in Dam. Dam is an area of pastureland that was favoured by the Mongols about two hundred kilometres north of Lhasa, southeast of Namtso Lake. It was about March 1660 and the rebellion was over, less than three months after it began. The Tibetan soldiers dispersed.Karmay 2014, pp. 418-419 Norbu's sudden departure and the government‚Äôs reoccupation of the fort are linked by Lobzang Gyatsho to a rite carried out by the Dragna Choje. The rebels‚Äô surrender took place, when Lobzang Ngawang ('), the Dragna Choje, with a some monks, practised the rite of the wheel of expulsion and sent the ritual item representing the rebels away to the northern plain as a ritual gesture of expulsion. Norbu and Ngodrup promptly accepted the offer that was on the table, quit the fort and headed north themselves.Karmay 2014, p. 419 The Two Royal Brothers then returned to Lhasa to report that Norbu and Ngodrup had connived with Bhutan to send its army in support of their revolt, and that this army had crossed the border into Tibet and reached Phagri. This danger had been foreseen, however, and a force had been sent to Phagri to repel the invasion, although no actual fighting is reported. This happened on the same day that a ritual torma of the deity Jampal Dudra (') was taken out of the Potala to be hurled. It was after hearing the news of the Bhutanese army‚Äôs withdrawal from Phagri that Norbu and Ngodrup gave up hope and surrendered the fort.Karmay 2014, p. 420 In any case the whole rebellion ended without significant violence; it seems from Lobzang Gyatso's account that it was mainly fought by gods and demons on the spiritual plane.Karmay 2014, chapter 32 Fugitive, 1660, and exile Norbu and Ngodrup, the rebel ringleaders, had been promised forts and land by the Two Royal Brothers. Lobzang Gyatso was not at all happy to reward their treachery in this way but out of respect for the Mongols he was grudgingly making arrangements to cede some suitable territories to them. Meanwhile Norbu and Ngodrup were being escorted to Lhasa from Dam when halfway there they panicked, escaped and sought sanctuary as fugitives in Taklung Monastery (').Karmay 2014, p. 424 The Mongols saw this act as a betrayal of trust and withdrew their support from them; their offer of forts and land was now off the table. Norbu and Ngodrup were then held at Taglung Monastery under guarantee and that is the last that is related about Norbu by Lobzang Gyatso. However, Norbu is further mentioned by the Tibetan historian Dungkar (') as, ultimately, turning his back on Lobzang Gyatso and fleeing to exile in Bhutan.

More recent research suggests that Fydell House had been built before 1704, in which case Bell may have been the architect. The argument that Fydell House was by Sands is based on the similarity of certain design features with the Moulton Chapel, designed by Sands in 1722. Both buildings have similar giant Doric order pilasters and appear to be influenced by the early 18th Dutch brick architectural tradition. Pevsner, however, views it as the work of a provincial hand.‚ÄúAntram‚Äù Baroque datestone 1722, St James' church, Moulton Chapel Chapel of St James, Woodgate Road, Moulton Chapel * Moulton Chapel, St James Moulton.

In the short, Donald cooks a turkey dinner for his nephews Huey, Dewey and Louie, but when they come to the table with dirty hands, he punishes them by sending them to bed. The nephews escalate the battle, and when Donald is knocked unconscious, they trick him into thinking that he's died and become an angel. While Donald's relationship with his nephews Huey, Dewey and Louie had deepened significantly by 1948 in Carl Barks' Duck comics, the nephews of the cartoons are still the identical mischievous troublemakers that they were when first introduced ten years earlier. The Encyclopedia of Walt Disney's Animated Characters spotlights this short as a particularly potent example of the nephews' malicious behavior: Synopsis Donald is preparing a turkey dinner, while his nephews play Apaches. When he calls his nephews in for dinner, they start fighting over the turkey. Donald orders the dirty ducks to take a bath, and they try to trick him by running the water. But Donald spots that Louie's hand is still dirty, and he sends them to their room. The ducks pretend to cry themselves to sleep, making Donald feel guilty. When he comes upstairs to tell them they're forgiven, they trick him into snapping his fingers on a mousetrap, and they grab the food and run. Donald chases his nephews out the door, but as he rounds a curve, he falls off a cliff and narrowly misses being hit by a boulder. When he regains consciousness, the nephews have dressed Donald up as an angel, and are pretending to be crying over his squashed body. He gives them a tearful goodbye, and they rush home to eat. When Donald tries to fly, he hits the ground and realizes that it was a joke. When he gets home and finds his nephews feasting on the turkey, the \\"angel\\" Donald turns into a devil in a fit of rage, and chases them out of the house and across the countryside. Production As the cartoon begins, Donald sings a chorus of \\"Zip-a-Dee-Doo- Dah\\", a hit song from Disney's 1946 film Song of the South. Voice actor Clarence Nash performed the voices of Donald as well as his three nephews.

The American Equatorial Islands Colonization Project was a plan initiated in 1935 by the U.S. Department of Commerce to place citizens of the United States on uninhabited Howland, Baker and Jarvis islands in the central Pacific Ocean so that weather stations and landing fields could be built for military and commercial use on air routes between Australia and California. Additionally, the U.S. government wanted to claim these remote islands to provide a check on eastern territorial expansion by the Empire of Japan. The colonists, who became known as Hui Panala'au, were primarily young native Hawaiian men and other male students recruited from schools in Hawaii. In 1937, the project was expanded to include Canton and Enderbury in the Phoenix Islands. The project ended in early 1942 when the colonists were rescued from the islands at the start of the War in the Pacific. History Colonists waving before they begin their stint as settlers on Jarvis Island. The United States first began establishing its presence in the Equatorial Pacific during the mid-19th century through guano mining conducted by private American companies under the Guano Islands Act. After several decades, guano resources became depleted, leading to the diminishing presence of American companies on the islands; they were thus vulnerable to development and claim by other nations, especially the regional rival, Imperial Japan. The United States maintained a desire for military and commercial air routes between Australia and California, routes that would be facilitated by the use of the islands of Howland, Baker and Jarvis. In 1935, the Department of Commerce developed a clandestine colonization plan with the objective of placing U.S. citizens on the remote islands in order for the United States to lay claim to them. The colonization program called for non- active military personnel in order to avoid conflicting with international law regarding colonization by military. William T. Miller, Superintendent of Airways at the Department of Commerce, was appointed to lead the project. He traveled to Hawaii in February 1935, met with Albert F. Judd, Trustee of Kamehameha Schools and the Bishop Museum, and agreed that recent graduates and students of the Kamehameha School for Boys would make ideal colonists for the project. Multiple federal agencies vied for the right to administer the colonization project, including the Department of Commerce, the Department of the Interior, and the Navy Department, but jurisdiction was ultimately granted to the Department of the Interior. During the seven years of colonization, more than 130 young men participated in the project, the majority of whom were Hawaiian. In 1940, when the issue of discontinuing the colonization project was raised, the Navy acknowledged that the islands were \\"probably worthless to commercial aviation\\" but advocated for \\"continued occupation\\" because the islands could serve as \\"bases from a military standpoint.\\" Although the interests that \\"justified\\" continued occupation of the islands were military, the colonists were never informed of the true nature of the project, nor were the colonists provided with weapons or any other means of self-defense. End of the program Camp on Baker Island during Colonization Project In June 1941, the Commandant of the 14th Naval District recognized the \\"tension in the Western Pacific\\" and recommended the evacuation of the colonists, but his request was denied. On December 8, 1941, Howland Island was attacked by a fleet of Japanese twin-engine bombers, which killed Hawaiian colonists Joseph Keliihananui and Richard Whaley. In the ensuing weeks, Japanese submarine and military aircraft continued to target the islands of Howland, Baker, and Jarvis. The four colonists from Baker and the two remaining colonists from Howland were rescued on January 31, 1942, and the eight colonists from Jarvis and Enderbury were rescued on February 9, 1942, two months after the initial attacks on Howland Island. In July 1943, a military base was established on Baker Island and played a substantial role in the Tarawa-Makin operation, a significant U.S. offensive against the Japanese fleet in the Pacific theatre. Post World War II (1956), the participants of the colonization project established an organization to preserve the fellowship of their group, naming it ‚ÄúHui Panala‚Äôau.‚Äù In 1974, the islands of Howland, Baker and Jarvis were designated as National Wildlife Refuges and are now part of the Pacific Remote Islands Marine National Monument. The islands of Canton and Enderbury became part of the Republic of Kiribati.

She was a founding member of A.I.R. gallery, the first all-female artists cooperative gallery in the United States.  Early life  Mayer was born and raised in Ridgewood, New York, and lived in New York City for most of her life. She attended Saint Matthias grammar school in Ridgewood, NY, and Saint Saviour High School in Brooklyn. She studied classics at St. Joseph's College and the University of Iowa and fine art at the School of Visual Arts and the Brooklyn Museum Art School. She was fluent in Greek and Latin, and before studying fine art at SVA, according to Adrian Piper, she had refused Harvard University's offer of a graduate fellowship to do a doctorate in the classics department.  Career  Mayer worked in a variety of media including drawing, sculpture and installation. Her early text-based work appeared frequently in 0 TO 9, a publication edited by her sister Bernadette Mayer and Vito Acconci between 1967-1969 which is considered \\"a groundbreaking mimeographed magazine...which brought together the era‚Äôs leading figures of experimental poetry and conceptual art,\\" including artists Sol LeWitt, Adrian Piper, and Dan Graham. In 1972, Mayer was one of the women artists who co- founded A.I.R. gallery, at 97 Wooster Street in New York City. She exhibited her large-scale fabric sculptures for the first time there in 1973 in a two- person solo presentation alongside artist Judith Bernstein, in a show which was reviewed by Roberta Smith in Artforum; in the review, Smith commented on the interplay between drawing and sculpture in Mayer's work. Artforum in Summer 1976 would publish a two-page feature on Mayer by Lawrence Alloway which included a reproduction of Galla Placidia, a work from that show. The work Galla Placidia was also the cover of Alan Sondheim's book Individuals: Post-Movement Art in America (1976); Mayer also contributed the essay \\"Two Years, March 1973 to January 1975\\" which discusses her fabric sculptures, to that book which included writing and poetry by various contemporary artists. Mayer showed at Monique Knowlton gallery in 1976. In the later 1970s her work grew more focused on installation and ephemeral projects, including installations incorporating weather balloons and snow in out-door projects. She was part of the show \\"Words as Images\\" at the Renaissance Society at the University of Chicago in 1981, where she also gave a reading. As a writer, she published Pontormo's Diary (1983), a translation of the diary of the Florentine artist Jacopo da Pontormo. She said in a 2013 interview, ‚ÄúI was living in Post-Minimalism, a time after a time of clarity, and Pontormo was in a time after the clarity of the Renaissance.‚Äù She also published criticism in Arts Magazine, Art in America, published writing on her work in Art-Rite, and kept a journal for most of her life. Mayer received grants from The National Endowment for the Arts, the New York Council on the Arts, and the Pollock- Krasner Foundation. She was also a professor of art at LaGuardia Community College, where she taught for twenty years.  Personal life  Mayer was the sister of Bernadette Mayer, a poet, and writer associated with both the Language poets and the New York School. Rosemary Mayer was married to the artist Vito Acconci. They separated in the late 1960s, and she lived for forty years in a Tribeca loft, where she hosted many elaborate dinner parties and cultivated an impressive indoor garden, primarily from avocado pits. She had no children.  Legacy  Beware All Definitions installation view 2017. Mayer was the subject of a solo show at Southfirst Gallery in Brooklyn, New York ‚Äî the first major presentation of her work in thirty years ‚Äî which was reviewed in Artforum, The New Yorker, and The New York Times. The show was curated by art historian Maika Pollack, the gallery's founder, with Marie Warsh and Max Warsh‚ÄîMayer's niece and nephew. The exhibition included a presentation by art historian Gillian Sneed. The show travelled to the University of Georgia's Lamar Dodd School of Art in fall of 2017. An accompanying exhibition catalog titled, \\"Rosemary Mayer Beware All Definitions Selected Works 1966-1973\\" was published by the Lamar Dodd School of Art. A publication of her writing which documents a pivotal year in Mayer's life and career, Excerpts from the 1971 Journal of Rosemary Mayer, edited by Marie Warsh, was published by Object Relations (Brooklyn, New York) in 2016. In 2017, Sobercove Press published Temporary Monuments: Work by Rosemary Mayer, 1977-1982. Edited by Marie and Max Warsh, this book is the first comprehensive presentation of her ‚Äútemporary monuments,‚Äù large-scale public installations she intended to celebrate and memorialize individuals and communities through their connections to place, time, and nature. It includes writings by Mayer from the period, and an introductory essay by Gillian Sneed that situates Mayer within the New York art world of the 1970s and ‚Äò80s and argues that Mayer‚Äôs public art anticipated more recent practices of site-specific and socially engaged art.

History  At the time of the Battle of Plassey, local people migrated to a different place to avoid social and political turmoil and form a new human settlement. According to the etymology 'para' (locality) of the inhabitants of Palashi (Palashi) set up here. Palashipara is a very old village situated in the bank of Jalangi River. An indigo kuthi was established by the indigo planters at Nishchintapur village near Palashipara. Before the Partition of Bengal (1947) this place was under Meherpur subdivision in British India.

The Jalangi River forms the district/ subdivision border in the north-western part and then flows through the subdivision. The other important rivers are Mathabhanga and Bhairab. The eastern portion forms the boundary with Bangladesh.The subdivision is overwhelmingly rural. 97.15% of the population lives in the rural areas and 2.85% lives in the urban areas.

Some other reviews were less positive, for example Dr. James C. Harris of Johns Hopkins University criticized Neurotribes as a book that pushes an agenda, saying that Silberman misrepresented Leo Kanner as somebody that had a negative view towards autistics and their parents, rather than, as Harris argued, an advocate for individualized treatment for every child. Dr. Manuel Casanova has also written against Silberman's perspective that Hans Asperger, one of the first autism researchers, should be forgiven for his involvement in the Nazi regime. \\"Contrary to Mr. Silberman,\\" Casanova wrote in response, \\"I do not defend or condone [Asperger‚Äôs] murderous actions.\\" In 2017, Paramount Pictures acquired the rights to Neurotribes and announced interest in making the book into a movie with Broadway Video.

Charles R√∂thlisberger was the club's chairman for the fourth consecutive year. FC Basel played their home games in the St. Jakob Stadium. Following their relegation in the 1987‚Äì88 season this was their fourth season in the second tier of Swiss football.  Overview  Ernst August K√ºnnecke was first-team coach for the second consecutive season. After missing promotion in the previous season, the club's repeated priority aim was to return to the top flight of Swiss football. Basel were assigned to the South East group. Also in this group were local rivals Old Boys. Although Basel lost the away game against the Old Boys, 0‚Äì4, and could only manage a goalless draw against them in their home stadium, they ended the Qualifying Phase in top position in the league table. In the 22 matches Basel totaled 31 points with 13 victories, five draws and four defeats. The team scored 42 goals and conceded 30. Basel qualified for the promotion stage and were assigned to group A. Also assigned to this group from the Nationalliga B were Yverdon-Sports, Baden, Locarno, ES Malley and AC Bellinzona and fighting against relegation from the Nationalliga A were Lugano and Aarau. However, the promotion-relegation phase started badly; Basel could only draw four games and lost two from the first six games. Trainer Ernst August K√ºnnecke was released from his position. The two former players Karl Odermatt and Bruno Rahmen took over ad interim until the end of the season. The team ended their 14 matches in this stage with just four victories, six draws, suffering four defeats with 14 points in a very disappointing fourth position in the league table, scoring 20, conceding 22 goals. Therefore, they missed promotion once again. In the second round of the Swiss Cup Basel were drawn away from home against lower- tier FC Einsiedeln and in the round of 64 away against lower tier FC Willisau. Both games were won easily (6‚Äì2 and 2‚Äì0). In the round of 32 Basel were drawn at home against Bulle and the game ended with a 1‚Äì1 draw after extra time. Basel secured the victory in the penalty shoot-out. In the next round they were drawn at home against FC Bern (5‚Äì1 victory). But in the quarterfinals Basel were drawn at home against Lugano. Because this match ended in a 2‚Äì3 defeat they were eliminated.

Early life and education  Sarafinchan was born in Vegreville, Alberta, in 1935, the eldest of three brothers and eventually, a sister. Sarafinchan's interest in art began early. Confined at home with measles at age 12, she began passing the time on the family farm painting with whatever materials she could find at hand. She took some of her paintings with her when she returned to school. Her teacher, Mrs. Miller, hung them in the classroom, which also happened to be used once a week by an adult art class sponsored by the University of Alberta in Edmonton Extension Program, led by a local artist, Laura Evans Reid, who noticed Sarafinchan‚Äôs work and encouraged her to join her art class. When Sarafinchan was 15, Laura Reid secretly entered some of Sarafinchan‚Äôs work in a province- wide competition. As a result, Sarafinchan won first prize and the first of her 8 scholarships to summer classes at the Banff School of Fine Arts. After completing High School, Sarafinchan moved on the Ontario College of Art (OCA) in Toronto. Because of a health problem, she did not complete her first year. but, in spite of this, was awarded a scholarship to continue into her second year. Laura. Reid had also given Sarafinchan introductions to members of the Group of Seven in Toronto. Jock McDonald, one her instructors at OCA, became one of her mentors. She graduated from OCA with the Medal for Proficiency in Drawing and Painting.  Career  After graduation, Sarafinchan was asked by Harley Parker, another painting instructor at OCA, to join him and Marshall McLuhan in their redesign and new approach to exhibitions at the Royal Ontario Museum (ROM) in Toronto. Sarafinchan‚Äôs main responsibility was to work with the trades in executing the ideas generated by the three of them in fulfilling their mandate to bring a more exciting, new, contemporary draw to the museum. Some of their exhibitions included a fashion show, masks and posters from around the world. And she continued to paint. In 1966, she was asked if she would like to hang a few of her works in the Alpha Gamma Delta sorority house (where she had become a member and had lived while at Art College). A three- day show was mounted, drawing a crowd of people and leading to the offer of a one-woman show at Toronto‚Äôs Pennell Gallery and an invitation to hang one of her paintings in Habitat at Expo ‚Äò67 in Montreal (in the end, three were chosen).  Exhibitions  Solo exhibitions followed including at Adam and Yves Gallery, two at the Dunkleman Gallery, Stong College (York University), of which she became a teaching fellow, one in Edmonton, near her home town of Vegreville (1974, and a special thrill for her) and two solo exhibitions at Toronto‚Äôs prestigious Roberts Gallery. Sarafinchan also loved to teach and, under the auspices of the Art Gallery of Ontario and the Ontario Arts Council, was sought after to give workshops by schools, art associations and galleries in Ontario as well as in Quebec and Alberta. Sarafinchan married and subsequently raised two sons on her own. She continued painting until she developed an allergic reaction to the media and had to put it all aside. She had by then entered the film business... first in continuity and eventually as an production designer (picking up a Genie along the way, for \\"Dancing in the Dark\\"). Eventually she became a sought after location manager and scout. Her works are owned and appreciated in Canada, the US, England, Australia and the Ukraine, in both private and corporate collections.  Awards  In 1987 Sarafinchan won a Genie Award for 'Dancing in the Dark' production design and art direction.

On the shortlist of candidates considered by President Donald Trump for Solicitor General of the United States prior to the nomination in March 2017 of Noel Francisco, he was subsequently considered for a post as an assistant attorney general heading the Civil Division at the United States Department of Justice, but withdrew himself from consideration. In 2018, Conway emerged as a vocal Trump critic, even though his wife, Kellyanne Conway, worked for Trump from 2016 to 2020. Conway argued the 2010 case Morrison v. National Australia Bank before the Supreme Court of the United States. The Court unanimously ruled in favor of Conway's client and the opinion was authored by Justice Antonin Scalia. Early life and education George Conway's father, an electrical engineer, worked for defense contractor Raytheon. His mother was an organic chemist from the Philippines. He is half-Filipino. Conway grew up outside of Boston and graduated from Marlborough High School in Marlborough, Massachusetts. In 1984, Conway graduated from Harvard College magna cum laude with a Bachelor of Arts in biochemistry, where William A. Haseltine served as his faculty advisor. Three years later, he obtained his Juris Doctor from Yale Law School, where he was an editor of the Yale Law Journal and president of the school's chapter of the Federalist Society. Career =Legal career= In 1987 and 1988, Conway served as a law clerk to Judge Ralph K. Winter Jr. of the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit. In September 1988, Conway joined the law firm of Wachtell, Lipton, Rosen & Katz. He was named a partner of the firm in the Litigation Department in January 1994. His practice focused on litigation involving securities, mergers and acquisitions, contracts, and antitrust. Conway was one of the attorneys who represented Paula Jones in her lawsuit against U.S. president Bill Clinton. During the representation of Jones, he worked closely with Ann Coulter and Matt Drudge. On March 29, 2010, Conway argued the securities case of Morrison v. National Australia Bank before the U.S. Supreme Court. Conway won the case, which was decided by an 8‚Äì0 vote; the opinion was written by Justice Antonin Scalia.Morrison v. National Australia Bank (2010). SCOTUSblog. Retrieved March 18, 2017. Conway has been considered for some United States Department of Justice posts. In January 2017, he was considered for the post of Solicitor General. The job eventually went to Noel Francisco. On March 17, 2017, it was reported that he would be nominated to run the United States Department of Justice Civil Division. However, on June 2, 2017, Conway announced that he declined to pursue the post. On November 16, 2018, Conway stated that a reason he did not join the Trump administration was because it is \\"like a shitshow in a dumpster fire\\". =Anti-Trump activism= On November 9, 2018, Conway and Neal Katyal wrote an op-ed in the New York Times challenging the constitutionality of Trump's appointment of Matthew Whitaker as acting attorney general following the termination of Jeff Sessions. Trump relied on the Federal Vacancies Reform Act of 1998 (FVRA), which allows the president to make interim appointments, to appoint Whitaker. Conway and Katyal argued that it was a mistake to try to use the FVRA to override the explicit wording of the Constitution, which requires Senate approval of all appointees who answer directly to the president. In November 2018, Conway organized a group called Checks and Balances. The group was composed of more than a dozen members of the conservative-libertarian Federalist Society, which had been instrumental in selecting candidates for the Trump administration to appoint to federal courts. The New York Times reported that the group was \\"urging their fellow conservatives to speak up about what they say are the Trump administration's betrayals of bedrock legal norms\\". Conway is a founding member and advisor of the Lincoln Project, a conservative Super PAC formed in December 2019 and dedicated to \\"Defeat President Trump and Trumpism at the ballot box\\". Its detailed aim is \\"persuading enough disaffected conservatives, Republicans and Republican-leaning independents in swing states and districts to help ensure a victory in the Electoral College, and congressional majorities that don't enable or abet Mr. Trump's violations of the Constitution\\". The group released its first video on January 9, 2020; called \\"The MAGA Church\\"; it warns evangelicals to beware of false prophets. On August 23, 2020, he announced that he would be taking a leave from the Lincoln Project in order to devote more time to his family. Kellyanne Conway, his wife, announced her departure from the White House the same day as well. Following the Impeachment of Donald Trump, Conway opined in The Washington Post that if the relevant witnesses are not allowed to testify during the Senate Trump impeachment trial, Trump's defenders will be negatively affected by \\"the very evidence they sought to suppress\\". Upon Senator Mitch McConnell's refusal to subpoena John Bolton in a Senate impeachment trial, Conway and Neal K. Katyal opined in the New York Times, \\"There is only one possible explanation for this behavior: [McConnell] is afraid of the truth. Otherwise, what argument can there be for refusing to hear from a central witness like Mr. Bolton, who other witnesses have indicated was exceptionally concerned about the suspension of military aid to Ukraine?\\" Personal life In the late 1990s Conway dated conservative pundit Laura Ingraham. In the late 1990s, Conway saw Kellyanne Fitzpatrick on the cover of a society magazine. He had known of her from her television appearances, and called Ann Coulter for an introduction. George and Kellyanne married in 2001, and she took his last name. They have four children and live in Washington, D.C. Prior to Trump's presidency, the family lived in Closter, New Jersey. Conway's daughter Claudia Conway came to fame in 2020 for her anti-Trump comments on TikTok. On July 2, Claudia expressed that her father approved of utilizing her right to free speech and voicing her own opinions. On July 3, Conway tweeted a request that all media cease communicating with his daughter. Despite her father being against Trump, in response to her father's attempted censorship, Claudia tweeted \\"You're just mad that I'm finally getting my voice heard. Sorry your marriage failed\\". Claudia's social media accounts were then briefly made private. Since 2018, Conway's stated political positions have often been contrary to those taken by his wife on behalf of the Trump administration. His published legal interpretations of Trump's actions differ from his wife's positions,Wagner, John, Trump's installation of acting AG was unconstitutional, argues husband of Kellyanne Conway, The Washington Post, November 8, 2018 and on Twitter he has been critical of Trump on a personal level. In March 2019, Trump responded to Conway's attacks by calling him a \\"stone cold LOSER & husband from hell\\" on Twitter. Kellyanne defended Trump's comments in an interview, saying that Trump was \\"a counterpuncher\\" and was free to respond when he is attacked.

It has a crystal clear colour and can be used to help relieve coughing, reduce sputum, and stimulate appetite. Its main components are pear juice, honey and various kinds of herbs. With the development of modern medical science, it is now rarely used to treat coughing; pear-syrup candy has become a souvenir and a snack, and is a part of Jiangnan culture. History =Ancient= The history of pear- syrup candy can be traced back to 634 (the Tang Zhenguan Eighth Year). According to legend, the mother of Wei Zheng (a renowned official of the Tang Dynasty) suffered from a cough, so the imperial court sent imperial physicians to treat her. However, Wei's mother felt that the medicines were too bitter to take, and so she failed to take them on time, and thus curing her took a long time. For this reason, Wei Zheng decided to make his own medicine, combining almond, chuanbei (bulbus fritillariae cirrhosae), tuckahoe, and juhong (red tangerine peel), and adding the combination to pear syrup, and finally decocting the whole thing into paste. Wei's mother took the medicine and was soon cured. After that, Wei shared this prescription to the public, and not only the upper classes but ordinary people produced it, so the method of making the candy became widespread. During the Northern Song Dynasty (960-1127), the production and sales of pear-syrup candy normalised, becoming a huge industry. In Luoyang, the western capital, there were countless shops selling it, and the production technology was quite mature. After the Jingkang Incident in 1127, many of the craftspeople involved in its production moved to the Southern Song Dynasty (1127-1279), in the south of China. They passed through Yangzhou and settled down in Hangzhou, the Southern Song capital. Thus, pear-syrup candy appeared in Suzhou, Wuxi, Changzhou, and nearby areas. The candy has remained popular throughout Jiangnan since that time. =Modern= Chenghuang Miao (City God Temple of Shanghai), Shanghai, one of the most important sites for the modern ligaotang industry. In modern times, pear-syrup candy has developed into Shanghai style, Suzhou style, Hangzhou style, Yangzhou style, and Ningbo style; these styles have mingled and were popular in Shanghai. The prosperity of the Shanghai pear-syrup candy industry started in the mid nineteenth century. In 1855, Zhupinzhai, the first pear- candy shop in Chenghuang Miao in Shanghai opened. In 1882, Yongsheng Tang, the second pear-syrup candy shop in the Old Chenglong Miao opened. In 1904, Deshengtang, the third pear-syrup candy shop opened in the north of the Old Chenglong Miao. These shops were the three most important in fierce competition which stimulated the rapid development of the ligaotang industry, helping it reach the peak of its manufacture. In production, the shops insisted on producing hand-made products based on the shop's secret recipe, with homology of medicine and food. In addition to the medical ligaotang, there were other kinds with mint, pine nut, dried meat floss, or rose. All were popular among tea drinkers and the audiences of story-telling houses. In 1956, the Communist Party of China initiated a public-private partnership. Zhupinzhai, Yongshengtang, and Deshengtang were merged and transferred to the Shanghai Pear-Syrup Candy Food Factory (‰∏äÊµ∑Ê¢®ËÜèÁ≥ñÈ£üÂìÅÂéÇ), which became the leading corporation in pear-syrup candy production in China. It is now a holding subsidiary corporation of Yuyuan Tourist Mart, a local listed enterprise in Shanghai. Modern factories divide ligaotang into two types: food-oriented and medicine-oriented. The food-oriented type consists of Chinese herbs and natural ingredients, with dozens of flavors such as mint, Chinese cymbidium, shrimp, walnut, kumquat, dried meat floss, almond, ginkgo, ham, peanut, pine nut, rose, sweet-scented osmanthus, sweet bean paste, etc. The medicine- oriented pear-syrup candy gains the production validation approved by theMinistry of Health of the People's Republic of China (MOH). Pear-syrup candies with colloidal medicine, grain-like electuaries, cough reduction, various herbs, and Sichuan fritillary bulbs all contribute to treating cough, tracheitis, asthma, and other illnesses to some extent. Medicinal value thumb The candy contains calcium, potassium, iron and other micronutrients that the human body needs. It also contains nutrients including carotene, thiamine, riboflavin, folic acid, ascorbic acid, etc. Traditional pear-syrup candy is made from loquat or fresh pear, added with almond, platycodon grandiflorum, tuckahoe, banxia (pinellia ternata), donghua (flos farfarae), qianhu (common hogfennel root), juhong, beimu (fritillaria thun-bergli) and other medicines and sugar. In some recipes, it also contains pangdahai (scaphium scaphigerum) and honeysuckle, functioning to clear and nourish the throat, relieve coughing and reduce sputum. The medical value of modern pear- syrup candy has been reduced. Except those factories with a long history which were permitted by the MOH to manufacture medicinal ligaotang, ordinary factories can only produce food-oriented pear-syrup candy. The MOH and China Food and Drug Administration have stipulated that food and medicines must be sold separately. They also pointed out that manufacturers should try to avoid using medical ingredients in food or materials of medicine food homology. In the Law of Food Safety of People's Republic of China („Ää‰∏≠Âçé‰∫∫Ê∞ëÂÖ±ÂíåÂõΩÈ£üÂìÅÂÆâÂÖ®Ê≥ï„Äã) and Measures of Banning Medicine Adding in Food and Health Management („ÄäÁ¶ÅÊ≠¢È£üÂìÅÂä†ËçØÂç´ÁîüÁÆ°ÁêÜÂäûÊ≥ï„Äã), it has been stated that food manufacturers cannot add medicines to food although some traditional food have edible medicinal ingredients. In labelling pear-syrup candy, it is banned to claim that it can relieve cough or reduce sputum, and neither terms like 'dietetic food' nor 'health food' can be used. Cultural influences =Production process performance= In the past, pear-syrup candy production could be a kind of performance, with two main types: Wenmai, which was artistic, and Wumai, which was similar to martial arts. The former one is also called Cuomu (ÈîâÊú®), sometimes involving the singing of local music. Thus, it attracted crowds and provided people with understanding of the process. Wenmai became a special selling method among Shanghai retailers. =The \\"Xiaorehun\\" Rap= Wumai is also called \\"Luobang\\", which is a selling method in the form of rap. Rapping and peddling in various dialects, it won popular favour. Vendors' raps included when they had something new to sell, as they moved from street to street. Among these vendors, Chen Changsheng (stage name: Xiao Deli) was the most famous, considered representative of ligaotang sellers in Suzhou. After him, Du Baolin created something new based on Chen's creation. He added criticisms of politics and satire of officials. To avoid trouble from the government, he called himself \\"Xiaorehun\\", asserting that all he said was nonsense, and it was needless for officials to worry about it. Du Baolin's \\"Xiaorehun\\" rap became popular in Hangzhou. Later, he came to Shanghai seeking new opportunities, and became a famous comedian in Shanghai in 1920s. \\"Xiaorehun\\" then became an alternative name for pear-syrup candy. In 1958, Wu Jingshou (Stage name: Xiao Mingli), current Vice Director of Changzhou Folk Arts Sodality, and Bao Yunfei (stage name: Xiao Delin), established a Rap and Candy-selling Cooperation of Street Artists in the East Avenue in Changzhou, which helped spread the \\"Xiaorehun\\" culture in Suzhou. Wumai in Yangzhou was also interesting. Typically two people worked together at a time, and pairs of men and women pushed wheelbarrows and walked along the streets. They sold candies in crowded places and sang Xiaodiao (Yangzhou folk songs) to attract customers. Xiaodiao was clear and easy to understand, a bit like a roundelay, which often won laughter from the audience. Some folklore experts consider that \\"Xiaorehun\\" has greatly contributed to the forming and development of Shanghai Dujiaoxi (\\"funny drama\\"). Furthermore, the fact that \\"Xiaorehun\\" artists were brave enough to express their ideas on politics openly can be regarded as an awakening of public awareness of fighting for the right of speech. = Nonmaterial Cultural Heritage = Shanghai City, Jiangsu Province, and Zhejiang Province all listed the performance of \\"Xiaorehun\\" or the production process of pear-syrup candy in their provincial level directory of nonmaterial cultural heritage. Shanghai government listed the making process of ligaotang into the Second Nonmaterial Cultural Heritage list of Shanghai. Jiangsu Province listed both Changzhou \\"Xiaorehun\\" and Changzhou style making process of ligaotang into the Nonmaterial Cultural Heritage list of Jiangsu Province. Zhejiang Province listed \\"Xiaorehun\\" into the First Nonmaterial Cultural Heritage of Zhejiang Province. Brands Famous Chinese brands of pear-syrup candy currently produced include Caizhi Zhai and City God Temple of Shanghai by the Shanghai Pear-Syrup Candy Food Factory.
