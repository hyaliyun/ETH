It was designed by Francis Drummond Greville Stanley and built from 1888 to 1905. It was also known as Magdalen Asylum. It was added to the Queensland Heritage Register on 21 October 1992.  History  Holy Cross Church, circa 1895 Magdalene Asylum, 1937 The Holy Cross Laundry was constructed as an auxiliary wing to the Holy Cross Retreat at Wooloowin in 1888-89. The retreat was built for the Sisters of Mercy as a tribute to the work of James Quinn, Roman Catholic Bishop of Brisbane from 1859 until his death in 1881. It was erected adjacent to the Church of the Holy Cross (1886) in Chalk Street, to a design prepared by former Queensland Colonial Architect Francis Drummond Grenville Stanley. The institution, known more familiarly as the Magdalen Asylum, provided protection for unmarried mothers and women who were either destitute or deemed to be in need of institutional restraint, and for intellectually handicapped persons, regardless of creed. The adjacent laundry functioned as both a source of revenue to support the home and as a means of teaching skills and discipline. The original laundry consisted of a single-storeyed section at the eastern end of the dormitory building containing ironing and mangling rooms, and a southern wing which housed the sorting room and washhouse. In 1899 a northern wing in brick with a timber verandah was added. It was designed as a model ironing room equipped with a purpose-built recess which housed tiered stoves capable of heating sixty-eight irons. Large roller presses were in use by 1902 and electric irons were installed in 1917. From the outset the laundry employed steam-driven facilities, initially powered by a gas-operated boiler. An oil burner was installed in the 1980s, and the old boiler-room chimney was demolished. In the 1890s the laundry secured a number of shipping contracts and by the 1920s had grown to become one of the largest commercial laundries in Brisbane. In 1977 the dormitory building and kitchen wing were demolished, but the steam laundry has been maintained as a sheltered workshop for intellectually handicapped women and men. In 2014, it offers both supported employment for people with disabilities and general employment, with most employees being covered under an enterprise agreement and the remainder under contract. Following a five-year negotiated sale with the Sisters of Mercy, in 2020 Cedar Wood Properties redeveloped the site as the Greville masterpanned community. The site has been developed to have 84 new terrace homes, 189 new apartments and 7 heritage apartments within the heritage-listed laundry. The laundry area is used for the living areas of the heritage apartments with a modern two-storey addition to the rear of the laundry building to provide bedroom and garages. The community is named Greville in honour of Francis Drummond Greville Stanley as the original architect.  Description  Roof detail, 2015 The laundry is a single-storeyed brick and timber structure with a corrugated iron roof. The older sections rest on brick piers and probably originally were unpainted externally. The 1889 brick wing retains its basic form, although sections of walls have been removed, the ceiling is lined, the exterior has been plastered and painted, and the whole has been re-roofed. It still houses the washing room, part of the ironing room and the boiler-room. A recent brick wing has been added to the east of this section to serve as the sorting room. The wall separating the old wing from the 1899 brick addition has been removed to create one large ironing room. The extension was designed for maximum ventilation, and has a high ceiling lined with tongue and groove boards, tall sash windows and verandahs the length of each side, and large ventilators in the roof. The verandah detailing originally echoed that of the dormitory building, but the existing posts, arches and diagonal battening of the western verandah are mostly replacements suggestive of the original. The eastern verandah has been enclosed and remodelled. In 1905 a section of the eastern wall of this second wing was removed and a timber extension was constructed to house the packing room; this has been extended since to include office facilities. The loading dock between this timber wing and the boiler room has been enclosed recently. None of the original equipment remains, although two large steam rollers, one manufactured by Mackenzie Bros Ltd of Sydney and dated 22 April 1936, and another (1940s), are still in operation.  Heritage listing  Holy Cross Laundry was listed on the Queensland Heritage Register on 21 October 1992 having satisfied the following criteria. The place is important in demonstrating the evolution or pattern of Queensland's history. The Holy Cross Laundry, Wooloowin is significant historically because it is the oldest charitable institutional laundry continuing in operation in Brisbane, and provides rare surviving evidence of the workhouse tradition, associated with a refuge for destitute women in the 19th century. The place demonstrates rare, uncommon or endangered aspects of Queensland's cultural heritage.

Etymology Naja mandalayensis was first described by herpetologists Wolfgang W√ºster and Joseph Bruno Slowinski in 2000. The generic name naja is a Latinisation of the Sanskrit word ' () meaning \\"cobra\\". The specific epithet mandalayensis is Latin and refers to the city of Mandalay, which is a major city within the range of Naja mandalayensis. Description This species of cobra is medium in length, and heavy bodied. The average length of an adult ranges from ; they can grow to . The head is elliptical, depressed, slightly distinct from the neck with a short, rounded snout and large nostrils. The body is compressed dorsoventrally and subcylindrical posteriorly. Its scales are smooth and strongly oblique. The eyes are moderate in size with round pupils. The body of this species is yellowish-brown to dull brown, with darker brownish mottling. The belly is pale with some dark speckling. Specimens are often dark under the chin and throat, followed by a more pale clear area, then by 2 or 3 dark bands across the venter of the hood. This species has no obvious markings on dorsum of the hood, although a spectacle-shaped hood mark may be present, especially in some juveniles. Like other spitting cobra species, they possess a pair of fixed front upper fangs that are highly modified for \\"spitting\\" venom. Geographic distribution This species is endemic to the central dry zone of Myanmar, spanning the Mandalay, Magway, and Sagaing Divisions. The central dry zone is a well defined area with a characteristic climate, and an extent of less than 20,000 km2. The few known records of this snake have been taken from areas throughout this general region, and it has an estimated range of approximately 18,500 km2 based on recorded data. Habitat This species occurs in the central dry zone of Myanmar, an area that receives less than of rain annually. The area is made up of acacia and stunted dipterocarpaceae savannas, although the area is being intensively utilized for agricultural purposes. Mandalay spitting cobra specimens have been collected in dry forests and dry acacia habitat. Behaviour and diet This species of cobra is predominantly nocturnal, hunting at dusk or night. They spend the daylight hours being mostly stationary or basking in the sun. The spitting behaviour of this species is said to be similar to that of the Indochinese spitting cobra (N. siamensis) based on anecdotal observations made by herpetologists. Mandalay spitting cobras are alert and defensive snakes, quickly raising their forebodies and spreading a broad hood when faced with a threat. Very little provocation is required to cause them to spit. The venom can be efficiently expelled at least in distance. In addition to spitting, this species will often also charge forward towards the threat while hissing loudly. It preys mainly on toads and frogs but will also take other snakes, small mammals and occasionally even fish. Venom Nothing is known about the venom of this particular species. However, as a species of spitting cobra the venom likely has a cytotoxic and post-synaptic neurotoxic properties.

It was developed by Sonic Team as its first Sonic game exclusive to smartphones and published by Sega. In Sonic Runners, the player-character constantly ran forward, and players controlled their jumping using the touchscreen. The game featured a wide variety of playable characters from the Sonic series, and was free-to-play and received periodic updates. Development began in late 2013 and lasted a year and a half. Sonic Team sought to take advantage of the uses of smartphones and built the game using the Unity game engine. They designed Sonic Runners to have more replay value than other endless running games. The game was soft launched in select regions on February 25, 2015, and officially released worldwide on June 25. It failed commercially and received mixed reviews; although critics praised its gameplay, they criticized the number of pop-up ads and pay-to-play elements, as well as technical problems. Sega discontinued the game in July 2016. A sequel, Sonic Runners Adventure, was released by Gameloft in 2017. Gameplay Sonic, the player-character, runs forward as Doctor Eggman tries to stop him Sonic Runners was a free-to-play side-scrolling video game in which the player-character was constantly running forward. To avoid obstacles and defeat enemies, the character jumped when the player tapped the touchscreen. The game featured a wide variety of playable characters from the cast of the Sonic franchise with unique abilities, such as Sonic the Hedgehog, Miles \\"Tails\\" Prower, and Knuckles the Echidna. The player started as Sonic and would unlock more characters as they progressed. Sonic Runners received periodic updates, which often included new characters. For example, Classic Sonic from Sonic Generations was added on June 26, 2015 to celebrate the 24th anniversary of the original Sonic the Hedgehog. The goal was to obtain high scores by running for as long as possible. While running, the player ran through vertical loops and jumped in cannons and on springboards and platforms. They collected power-ups like invincibility, Wisps, rings, and crystals. Wisps granted the player temporary powers, rings protected them from getting hit by enemies or obstacles, and crystals increased their score. When the player passed a checkpoint, the rings were banked and added to their overall score. The player would occasionally engage in boss fights with Doctor Eggman, who would drop objects to stop them. After Eggman was defeated, the difficulty would increase. The game ended when the player was hit without any rings or fell in a bottomless pit. By leveling up, the player could improve their performance during a run. They could also equip a companion who would assist them by increasing their statistics, such as Chao. The story followed an episodic format and primarily served as a tutorial that provided information on how to play the game. Players progressed through the game's main story mode by collecting enough points to progress along the world map. Each section either gave a reward, such as bonus rings, or unlocked special missions, such as boss fights. The story was told through text-based cutscenes, although players could skip them. Sonic Runners featured two types of in-game currency: Red Rings and regular rings. Red Rings were used to resume play after dying and could either be earned or obtained through in-app purchases. Rings could be used to either buy single use items or power ups for a run, or increase the effectiveness of certain items. Every day players logged in, they would get to spin a roulette wheel to earn prizes like companions. Landing on spaces marked \\"big\\" or \\"super\\" would upgrade the wheel to include better prizes. Players could also buy spins. Development Longtime Sonic series developer Sonic Team created Sonic Runners for Android and iOS. The game was Sonic Team's first Sonic game exclusive to smartphones. It was developed over the course of a year and a half using the Unity game engine. Series veteran Takashi Iizuka‚Äîwho designed Sonic the Hedgehog 3, Sonic & Knuckles, and Nights into Dreams, and directed Sonic Adventure and Sonic Adventure 2‚Äîserved as producer. The game's existence came to light in July 2014 after publisher Sega registered the domain name sonicrunners.com. Iizuka confirmed the game was real at the Tokyo Joypolis convention on December 28, 2014 and announced that it would launch in 2015. A teaser trailer and more details were revealed in early February 2015. Sega soft launched Sonic Runners in Canada and Japan on February 26, 2015 for testing purposes and released the final version worldwide on June 25, 2015. The game was conceived after the release of Sonic the Hedgehog 4. While Sonic 4 was released for smartphones, it had been designed for home consoles. Sonic Team wanted to take advantage of the unique experiences and uses smartphones provided, and were particularly interested in adding content regularly to keep users interested. Development began in late 2013 with a ten-person team, which expanded as the game progressed. Sonic Runners was designed to be easy to pick up and to resemble the Sega Genesis Sonic games, with a focus on action and jumping. It was also designed to have replay value‚Äîwith its story mode, various missions, alternate paths in levels, and power-ups‚Äîwhich Sonic Team felt was something most endless running games lacked. Originally, Chao was the only character who assisted the player, but Sonic Team decided to add characters like Chip from Sonic Unleashed because they wanted to surprise players. One of the biggest challenges Sonic Team faced during development was making sure the visual quality was consistent across all platforms. Veteran Sonic sound director Tomoya Ohtani composed the Sonic Runners soundtrack, which consists of themes from past games alongside new material. Ohtani made the music using the same methods he used for scoring previous Sonic games. The instruments he used were drums, bass, guitar, and piano, and he made the music \\"by focusing on creating a catchy band sound.\\" Ohtani said composing the soundtrack was fun because it reminded him of his first work in bands. A two-volume soundtrack, Sonic Runners Original Soundtrack, was released digitally via iTunes. The first volume was released on June 24, 2015 and the second volume was released on December 25, 2015. The game's tracks can also be purchased individually. Reception When Sonic Runners was announced, Nintendo Life uttered disapproval that it would not be released on Wii U. Destructoid opined that while \\"it's tough to imagine Sonic fans getting too excited about Runners\\", its future augured well after the critical panning of Sonic Boom: Rise of Lyric and Sonic Boom: Shattered Crystal. Reviewing the soft launched version, Hardcore Gamer believed it was the best Sonic game in years. Although critical of the game's excessive amount of pop-up ads, they felt it was focused, exhilarating, and corrected many problems present in prior games, and described it as \\"everything Sonic should be\\". TouchArcade praised its gameplay and presentation, but criticized its online functions and wrote they \\"could easily see it going off the rails\\". The final version received \\"mixed or average reviews\\", according to the review aggregator Metacritic. Generally, reviewers believed the core gameplay was enjoyable. TouchArcade considered it better than Sonic Dash and praised its fan service and content. Destructoid and Jim Sterling felt the game was well-designed; Destructoid said it had depth and succeeded as both a platformer and a Sonic game, and Sterling wrote that in terms of gameplay it was better than most endless runners. However, the game's amount of ads and pay to play elements were extensively criticized. Sterling believed they were intrusive and made the game over-complex, and Destructoid said they were \\"unreasonable\\" and \\"exhausting\\". TouchArcade wrote that \\"any free-to-play monetization gimmick you can think of it, Sonic Runners has it.\\" Technical problems, such as crashes and lengthy load times, were also criticized. Although it was downloaded over five million times, Sonic Runners was a commercial failure. A presentation highlighting Sega's strongest performing games designated Sonic Runners a \\"stalling title\\" because it only made between ¬•30‚Äî50 million a month. Nintendo Life wrote its failure was proof that the recognizability of a brand does not guarantee success. They also wrote the failure could be a cautionary tale for companies like Nintendo to not mask a game's problems by using a recognizable brand. Discontinuation and legacy In May 2016, Sega announced it would discontinue Sonic Runners. The sale of Red Rings ended on May 27, 2016, and the servers were shut down on July 27, 2016. Because it required a constant online connection, the game is unplayable. In April 2017, Gameloft released an FAQ webpage that indicated a sequel to Sonic Runners was in development. Gameloft released the sequel, Sonic Runners Adventure, for Android in Russia and the United Kingdom in June 2017, and worldwide for Android and iOS in December 2017. Unlike the original, Sonic Runners Adventure is sold at a fixed price.

It was built in 1863. It was added to the Queensland Heritage Register on 21 October 1992.  History  This low-set masonry and timber residence was constructed in a number of stages, with the brick and stone core dating to 1863. Originally the site was part of a subdivision acquired by Robert Cribb, Brisbane politician and property dealer, in 1861. In 1863 Cribb sold this to fellow Scottish immigrant Kenneth McLennan, a stonemason from the town of Conon in Scotland, who had arrived in Brisbane in 1855. On the transfer document McLennan listed his occupation as builder, and his descendants believe that McLennan built the house himself in 1863. In 1878 McLennan raised a mortgage on the property from Brisbane land speculator James Gibbon, which may have financed the addition of a northern brick and stone wing to the house about this time. By the early 1890s the property included an orchard and vineyard, bowling green, tennis court, stables and various outbuildings. Bunya pines lined the front drive, which is now Conon Street, down to McLennan Street. Around 1900 a timber extension was added to the southern side of the kitchen, and two internal walls were removed in 1917 to create a larger bedroom. At Conon, McLennan and his wife Ann Grant, whom he had married at Ipswich in 1855, raised a family of ten children. McLennan appears to have derived his Queensland income from property dealing rather than building. He took a keen interest in church and community affairs, and served as a Windsor Shire councillor and as the first mayor of the Town of Windsor in 1904. Following the death of his wife in 1912, McLennan moved from Conon and died at New Farm, aged eighty-seven years, on 1 November 1916. While a small allotment was excised from the original allotment in 1895 it was only after McLennan's death that his sons subdivided the original estate retaining for the family two allotments totaling containing the house and its garden, the tennis court and bowling green. The house block remained in the McLennan family until 1934, when it was sold to Sir Neil O'Sullivan, a Brisbane solicitor and federal cabinet minister. The northern allotment remained in the family until 1947. The O'Sullivans added a brick bedroom off the southern verandah in 1935. Lady O'Sullivan sold the property in 1972, but it remains a family residence. In 1980 a larger brick bedroom wing was added at the rear.  Description  Conon occupies a hilltop position in Lutwyche overlooking Breakfast Creek. It is a low-set masonry and timber residence which, because of its evolutionary nature, employs a variety of materials and styles. The earliest section of the house comprises a three-roomed (formerly four) brick core with a timber verandah which formerly encircled the whole. It rests on a rubble foundation of Brisbane tuff which was collected from the property, and is capped by a galvanised iron roof which was shingled originally. Portions of the verandah survive at the front, southern side and at the rear, and were either conserved or reconstructed in 1987. Dowel balustrading, square timber posts and fretwork brackets of an unusual thistle pattern supply the exterior decoration to this section. A small cellar is located under the side verandah and a separate basement cellar lies beneath the two early bedrooms. No visible evidence remains of any early kitchen house, probably timber, associated with the 1863 building. The rendered brick northern wing with coursed stone foundations and a corrugated iron roof was added in the late 1870s. It comprises an entrance hall, two large sitting rooms (probably formerly drawing and dining rooms) which are divided by an unadorned archway, and a large former kitchen, maid's room and pantry at the rear. Each sitting room has a bay window which also is separated from the body of the room by an arch. The grounds have been reduced following subdivisions however sufficient has been retained to preserve its garden and sense of space reflecting a 19th-century ambience. Despite the subdivision of the original holding the garden setting of the house is important in the understanding and appreciation of the significance of the place and its long history. Within the grounds there is a sense of isolation from more recent development. Some early plantings and garden features from the mid 19th century remain and indeed the general arrangement of the early garden is reflected in more recent plantings of the 1970s and 1980s. The association with the McLennan family for almost seventy years is perpetuated in the names of the neighbouring streets: McLennan, Kenneth and Conon.  Heritage listing  Conon was listed on the Queensland Heritage Register on 21 October 1992 having satisfied the following criteria. The place is important in demonstrating the evolution or pattern of Queensland's history. Conon is significant historically as one of the earliest houses in the Lutwyche area demonstrating the housing type of that time and of first wave of residential construction in the area. Evidence of later changes and additions to the house are clearly apparent in the surviving fabric. The place demonstrates rare, uncommon or endangered aspects of Queensland's cultural heritage. Conon has significance as a rare survivor of an 1860s house with an early garden in Brisbane. The scale of the garden and the setting of the house within the more recent suburban fabric of Lutwyche adds to that significance. The place is important in demonstrating the principal characteristics of a particular class of cultural places. The early core provides important evidence of mid-19th century masonry construction. In its present form it exemplifies the evolving house, extending from a modest mid-19th century core into a substantial late-19th century residence, with a cohesive and intact front facade. The changes reflect the changing fortunes and expectations of its original and later owners. The place is important because of its aesthetic significance. Conon sits within a substantial garden which makes a major contribution to the aesthetic significance of the place. The site is surrounded by later suburban houses but the house and its garden retain a nineteenth century ambiance. More recent development is not apparent from within the site and outward views are protected. The place has a special association with the life or work of a particular person, group or organisation of importance in Queensland's history. Conon is significant for its association for almost 70 years with the McLennan family, who played an important role in the development of Brisbane in the second half of the 19th century and for its later association with Neil O'Sullivan, at one time Federal Attorney General.

It reinforces the English case of Spencer v Harding (1870) LR 5 CP 561. However the Court also ruled that there was a breach of the Fair Trading Act (1986). Background The RDC advertised some surplus land or sale by tender, with the important caveat of \\"highest or any tender not necessarily accepted\\". During the tender process, the RDC discovered that they had previously agreed to sell the property to a neighbouring property owner Roberts. Ultimately, Gregory was the highest tenderer, although his offer did not meet the council's reserve, and the council declined all tenders. The RDC then proceeded to exclusively negotiate a sale to Roberts, without giving Gregory a chance to purchase the property. Held The court held that calling a tender is merely an invitation to treat, and so gave none of the tenderers any legal rights. However, it was a breach of section 9 of the Fair Trading Act, and Gregory was awarded damages.

It was built . It is also known as Killila Cottage. It was added to the Queensland Heritage Register on 1 October 2003.  History  Killila is a timber house, erected as a working class cottage , with extensive early 20th century alterations to convert it into a substantial middle-class home. The allotment on which this residence is situated was first alienated in 1858 as Portion 155, parish of Enoggera, county of Stanley (), by James Baker, a compositor of Brisbane, at a cost of . Five years later, the title was transferred to Robert Cribb, a Brisbane broker. Cribb immediately set about subdividing the land and in November 1880 title to subdivisions 11-22 and 51-56 of portion 155, comprising just over , was registered in the name of John Lloyd Bale. Bale was an accountant, agent and broker, and at the time of purchasing these Albion subdivisions was serving as Chairman of the Ithaca Divisional Board. He was elected a Member of the Queensland Legislative Assembly in 1883 and remained in that position until his death in 1885. He resided in an 1860s house at the corner of Albion and Bowen Bridge (Lutwyche) Roads named Stoneleigh, which gave its name to Stoneleigh Street. Most of Bale's land in the Albion/Windsor area remained unimproved, and between 1882 and 1884 he re-subdivided the property as the Stoneleigh Estate. In May 1883, title to re-subdivisions 56 and 57 of subdivision 56, comprising an area of (the site of Killila Cottage) was transferred to Elizabeth Parsons, the wife of George Alfred Parsons, brickmaker. Parsons was based at Lutwyche at this period, and it is unlikely that he lived in Stoneleigh Street, Albion. However, the Post Office Directories record Robert Parsons, brickmaker, as resident in Albion in the period 1885 to 1887, and it is possible that a cottage had been erected at 100 Stoneleigh Street by 1885, perhaps occupied by Robert Parsons. Certainly the cottage was constructed before the property was sold early in 1888 to the next owner, Mrs Margaret Duhig, widow and mother of James Duhig (1871-1965), the prominent Roman Catholic Archbishop of Brisbane between 1917 and 1965. Margaret Duhig emigrated from Ireland to Brisbane, following a sojourn in England, with James and two of her other children on 8 April 1885, aboard the Mackara. Two other children followed later. For 3 years the Duhigs were unable to afford to purchase their own house in Brisbane and resided in rental properties in Paddington, Spring Hill and Petrie Terrace before purchasing the cottage at 100 Stoneleigh Street. When James Duhig joined the work force in 1885, aged nearly 14, his weekly wage was one of the solid bases of the family economy and his support contributed to the deposit paid on the Stoneleigh Street cottage. Although title to the Stoneleigh Street property was not registered in the name of Margaret Duhig until February 1889, and the Post Office Directories first record her as resident in Albion in that year, personal letters in the Brisbane Catholic Archdiocesan Archives indicate that the Duhigs were residing at Albion by early 1888. On 26 April of that year, James Duhig wrote to his brother, Martin, announcing the family's purchase of the property for and expressing a hope that it \\"could double our money at any time\\". Three months later, Margaret Duhig wrote to Martin explaining that she was paying 8% interest and that extensions were carried out to the house for a sum of . For the Duhigs, it was a modest family house, affectionately named Killila Cottage after their home in County Limerick, Ireland. By the mid-1880s Windsor shire was an ideal suburban location, being within a stone's throw of the city yet enjoying all the attributes of the country. The Duhigs' neighbours in Stoneleigh Street, who in 1892 included a prominent draper, 2 accountants, an auctioneer, an engineer, several clerical workers, and numerous tradesmen and semi-skilled workers, reflected the growing eclectic social milieu of the Albion/Windsor area in the late 19th century, with more affluent residents building substantial homes on the higher ground and the working class in the valleys in between. It was during his residence at Killara Cottage that James Duhig began thinking seriously about a theological career. In 1890, after nearly five years of clerical work for the Co-operative Butchery Company, he returned to the Christian Brothers' Gregory Terrace School as a day student to study Latin and French with a view to furthering his theological interests. He also became an active member of the Catholic community, joining the Catholic Young Men's Society and serving as a parish catechist in Wooloowin. After 5 years of religious study in Rome, Duhig was ordained a priest in 1896 and returned to Brisbane the following year. Rising through the ranks of the Catholic Church, he succeeded Robert Dunne as Archbishop of Brisbane in 1917. Duhig's commitment helped raise the profile and status of Catholicism in Queensland, but he was also an influential figure in the State's social, political and economic activities. Duhig used his public profile to advance issues such as education, urban development, artistic development, justice and land settlement. As the driving force behind some 400 major buildings, including religious, educational, medical and charitable institutions, \\"James the Builder\\" also left his mark on the physical structure of Brisbane. When James Duhig embarked for Rome in 1891 to study for the priesthood, the family faced precarious financial circumstances. In the early 1890s, the mortgage repayments on Killara Cottage had stretched the family's budget and when Margaret Duhig contemplated selling she was reputedly unable to find a buyer, ironically having passed up an offer in 1889 from the Windsor Shire Council to purchase and resume the property to open up Salt Street. Despite the financial difficulties, Margaret Duhig retained ownership of the property until her death in 1902. It was then transferred to her daughters, Mary and Ellen Duhig, before it was registered in 1908 solely in the name of Mary Duhig, who retained title to the property for the next 29 years. Ellen joined the Order of the Good Samaritans, and Mary never married. By 1904 their sister Elizabeth and her husband Francis Joseph Cullen, had moved into Killila Cottage, where they raised their family. The Cullens resided here until 1937, and reputedly it was during their occupancy that substantial additions and renovations were made to the house. Mortgages on the property taken out in 1903 for and in 1913 for may be an indication of the date/s of the alterations, but this has yet to be confirmed. The Cullen and Duhig families appear to have been very close. One of James Duhig's nephews, Frank Lee Cullen, became a well-known Brisbane architect in the late 1930s, and undertook a number of commissions for the Catholic Church. In 1937, title to the property was transferred to Edgar Luke Samuel Pilkington, and it has remained in the Pilkington family since. Brisbane City Council records indicate that the house has not been substantially altered since at least 1946, with additions limited to construction of a single detached garage in 1961 and a tennis court on what is now a separate property at 98 Stoneleigh Street. Killila was sold in 2011 for $845,000.  Description  Entrance, 2015 Killila is located on two allotments at 100 Stoneleigh Street, Windsor, north of the Brisbane city centre. They are each with the rear of the allotments also accessed from Salt Street. The property is located amidst a number of late 20th century brick unit blocks in this part of Stoneleigh Street. The single-storey, high-set timber residence is sited close to the Stoneleigh Street boundary and the entire property perimeter is enclosed with a wire fence. There is vehicular access to the site from both Stoneleigh and Salt streets; however, only the Stoneleigh Street entrance gives access to a driveway leading to the garage situated on the eastern side of the property. The timber-framed house appears to have been constructed or reconstructed in at least three stages. A hipped-roof attached kitchen wing at the rear appears to be the oldest section of the house, likely part of the cottage. The core of the residence, which appears to be of mostly early 20th century fabric, has a short-ridged hipped roof of corrugated iron, and possibly replaces the earlier cottage core. It has early 20th century additions, comprising a gabled, east- facing projection at the front, and enlarged eastern side verandah, and rear additions. There are stepped verandahs with a skillion roof on three sides. All roofs are clad in corrugated iron and a corbelled brick chimneystack protrudes from above the kitchen. The front verandah has been enclosed with timber louvres and the original dowel balustrading is covered by fibrous cement panels. The original square verandah posts with tapered chamfers, have simple capital and astragal embellishments, and are visible in the front facade. Entry to the front verandah is gained via a short flight of later concrete stairs and through a single lattice door. A flying gable above the entry has decorative fretwork fronted by a simple slat infill and bargeboard. The side verandahs have also been enclosed with hinged windows. The formerly exposed face of the eastern gable, now hidden by the side verandah in-fill, has deep chamferboards, which may have been recycled from elsewhere in the house. The exposed faces of the rear extension are clad in chamferboards with some sections in vertically-jointed tongue and groove boarding. A flight of timber stairs to the rear wing of the house is sheltered by a corrugated iron roof. All windows in the rear extension are hinged and those facing south from the dining room feature coloured glass inserts. The majority of rooms with windows to the rear of the house are protected by hoods. Two distinct styles of hood are present, with some featuring galvanised skillion roofs and timber batten sides and other hoods featuring a convex profile with star motif on the sides typical of inter-war sunhood design. The original timber stumps of the house have been replaced with concrete and the sub-floor has been enclosed with timber battens. The area directly beneath the kitchen wing currently functions as a storage area and has an early brick fireplace which shares a chimney with the kitchen fireplace above. The early front door is centrally positioned in the front facade of what appears to be the first stage of the core. It has a cast iron knocker, central door knob, fielded panels and bolection moulds, and opens to a wide hallway which extends the length of the core. It is divided about mid-way along by a slatted timber arch. Six rooms open off this hallway, three to the left and two to the right. Above each doorway is a pivoted fanlight with waxed paper inserts. The first room to the left is the main bedroom, formerly a parlour, with a large double-hung sash window opening to the front verandah. It has a very fine pressed metal ceiling in Art Nouveau pattern. The second and third rooms on the left are currently used as bedrooms with French doors opening to the eastern side verandah. The front room on the right hand side has a bay window with double-hung windows to the front facade and French doors opening to the side verandah. The partition between the second and third rooms on the right has been removed to create one large living room, divided by a timber screen. This area has a fireplace with a fine timber surround in the southern wall, which backs onto the fireplace the adjoining kitchen. What was formerly the third room on this side of the hallway has also been extended onto what was formerly part of the western side verandah. The door opening into this room has early glass paneling. The far end of the hallway opens into an enclosed and extended former verandah area at the rear of the house, which is now used as a dining room and which appears to be an early 1900s extension. To the left is a bathroom and to the right is the kitchen and pantry. The kitchen retains the original wood oven and the former external walls of the kitchen wing are clad in a wider timber profile than the other walls in the house. Beside the pantry is a toilet, and adjacent to this a flight of timber stairs leading to the backyard. The walls in the core are mainly single-skin, constructed of narrow, vertically-jointed tongue and groove boarding. The ceilings, with the exclusion of the pressed metal ceiling in the front northeastern room, are lined with the same boarding. All rooms off the hallway have high picture rails and lambs tongue skirting boards. Joinery in the hallway, including the doors, is decorated with an early timber graining effect.  Heritage listing  Killila was listed on the Queensland Heritage Register on 1 October 2003 having satisfied the following criteria. The place is important in demonstrating the evolution or pattern of Queensland's history. Killila was constructed as a much smaller cottage, which was substantially refurbished and extended early in the 20th century. It is important in demonstrating the evolution or pattern of Queensland's history, illustrating in its fabric the pattern of upward social mobility from worker's cottage to middle-class residence, which characterized the struggle of Irish immigrants in Queensland to succeed in their new country and to raise the status of Catholics in an Anglican-dominated society. The place is important in demonstrating the principal characteristics of a particular class of cultural places. The house is important in illustrating the principal characteristics of a generously-sized middle-class residence of the early 20th century. The interior in particular is remarkably intact, including the internal layout, fabric, and finishes - such as early graining to the joinery and wall and floor finishes, patterned wax papers on the transom lights over the internal doors, and s electric light shades. The place is important because of its aesthetic significance. The place makes an important aesthetic contribution to the historical townscape of Windsor, which abounds in 19th and early 20th century residences, and contributes significantly to the historical character of the local area. The place has a special association with the life or work of a particular person, group or organisation of importance in Queensland's history. The house is also significant for its association with James Duhig (1871-1965), the prominent Queensland Catholic Archbishop from 1917 to 1965. During his religious career, Duhig helped raise the status of Catholicism in Queensland and played an influential role in the social, economic and political issues facing the State from the 1920s to the 1950s. As a youth, Duhig resided at Killila Cottage at Stoneleigh Street for several years before embarking for Rome to study for the priesthood. It was during his time at the Windsor residence that he first became actively involved in the Brisbane Catholic community. The house remained in the Duhig family for close to 50 years, during which time it was transformed into a middle-class residence.

It was designed by Frank Gibson Costello and built by Brisbane City Council. It was added to the Queensland Heritage Register on 6 April 2005.  History  The Brisbane City Council built the concrete shelter at Windsor as an air raid shelter in 1942. On 7 December 1941, the United States of America entered World War Two following the bombing of the American fleet at Pearl Harbour in Hawaii by Japanese carrier-borne aircraft. England and its Commonwealth had been at war with Germany since September 1939, but now the war was truly global. The Japanese first bombed Darwin on 19 February 1942 and 14,000 Australians were taken prisoner following the fall of Singapore. Plans to defend Australia from an anticipated Japanese invasion and to use Queensland as a support base for the conduct of the Pacific war were implemented quickly. Australian and American personnel poured into Queensland and urgently required a wide range of new buildings and facilities. The population of Brisbane swelled dramatically. As it was the major city in Queensland, and the most northerly major population centre in Australia, military planning headquarters were set up in Brisbane, as were a number of important maintenance, communication, and supply facilities. General Douglas MacArthur, Commander in Chief of the Allied Forces, Southwest Pacific, was based in the AMP building at the corner of Queen Street and Edward Street in Brisbane, and General Sir Thomas Blamey, Commander in Chief of the Australian Forces, used the recently constructed University of Queensland buildings at St Lucia. Brisbane was obviously a strategic target for bombing, and rapid action had to be taken to protect the population in the event of air raids. The demand on materials, services and labour was enormous and military projects took precedence in their allocation. Heavy Anti-Aircraft batteries were built at Victoria Park, Hendra, Pinkenba, Fort Lytton, Hemmant and Balmoral, and coastal artillery batteries were established on Bribie and Moreton Islands. Before the war, Queensland had a small population and no heavy manufacturing industries. To help overcome these problems, some buildings were prefabricated and standard designs for many structures were used. Designs took into account the scarcity of skilled labour and of some materials. The Brisbane City Council took responsibility for Air Raid Precautions activities, including establishing an Air Raid Warden system, firefighting systems and constructing air raid shelters. Aboveground salt water pipes were laid along city streets to aid in firefighting. On Christmas Eve, 1941, each Australian State's Emergency Committee issued instructions for government, private employers and private households to immediately start building shelters. Slit trenches were built in parks and schoolyards, windows were taped, and brownouts were applied to buildings. In the Protection of Persons and Property Order No.1, gazetted 23 December 1941, Premier William Forgan Smith, with powers conferred by Regulation 35a, National Security (General) Regulations, ordered the Brisbane City Council to construct 200 public surface shelters in the city area. Work had already started on 15 December, and later another 75 shelters were ordered. However, only 235 air raid shelters were constructed, the building programme being 90% complete by June 1942. In addition, around three kilometres of covered trenches were constructed in public parks, in 13 projects, including of concrete-pipe covered trench in the Botanic Gardens, and of the same in Victoria Park. It was believed that one person could be accommodated by each foot of trench. In addition to the public shelters, the Brisbane City Council also constructed shelters for leased wharves and council properties, including at the Stanley Wharf, Circular Quay Wharves 2,3 and 4, Norman Wharf, and Musgrave Wharf. Shelters were built under the Story Bridge, for Kangaroo Point shipbuilding workers, and five shelters were constructed on behalf of the Bureau of Industry at the Howard Smith Wharves. The Protection of Persons and Property Order No.1 was applied statewide, and outside Brisbane another 24 Local Authorities in Queensland's coastal areas were ordered to produce surface or trench shelters for the public, to be built according to the Air Raid Shelter Code laid down in the Second Schedule of Order No.1. Initially, 20 of the Local Authorities were expected to construct a minimum total of 133 surface shelters, which were supposed to be able to withstand the blast of a 500-pound bomb bursting away. Four other Local Authorities would only build trenches. However, after plans were amended, 23 Local Authorities outside Brisbane, excluding Thursday Island, ended up possessing a total of 129 public shelters: 123 surface and six underground. This effort had cost ¬£56,596. Where Local Authorities were unwilling or unable to build the required number of code-compliant shelters, in some cases because they had already begun erecting other shelters, the Department of Public Works became responsible for the shelters' construction. However, this led to problems when the Department tried to recoup half of the cost from the Local Authorities in question. Townsville, Toowoomba, Gladstone, and Ayr denied any liability for costs, and a Bill had to be passed in December 1942 to force their compliance. The Ayr Shire Council had claimed that the shelters would be death traps during an air raid. Of the 235 surface shelters built in Brisbane for the public, 21 survive and are still owned by the Brisbane City Council. One of the shelters, on Queens Wharf Road, is a site-specific \\"special\\" variation of the standard pillbox design. It is listed in the Queensland Heritage Register as part of the entry for the porphyry retaining wall on William Street. The other 20 public shelters owned by the Brisbane City Council can be divided into three types of pillbox intended for conversion after the war: \\"park\\", \\"bus\\", and \\"bus (stone)\\". They were designed to serve as structures such as bus waiting shelters or shade structures for parks, with some or all of the perimeter blast walls to be removed, leaving the concrete slab roof, floor slab and piers. The reusable pillboxes were designed to hold 70 people, as were the non-reusable standard pillboxes. F.G. Costello, Brisbane City Council City Architect between 1941 and 1952, was responsible for the design of the surface air raid shelters, and his variants of the standard pillbox were designed to provide a post-war utility for at least part of the Council's shelter building programme. In an address delivered to the Constitutional Club in Brisbane on February 1942, Costello noted that \\"if the emergency for their use does not arise ...(unused shelters)... remain in brick and concrete, in many cases having no further value and being a possible source of nuisance. He added that I can assure you that wherever it is possible, without sacrificing the primary requirements of shelter from air attack, I have endeavoured in our Council buildings to so plan the shelters that they will fit into schemes of improvement which we hope will proceed immediately after the war.\\" Costello's work was characterised by the use of an architectural language inspired by the modern movement in architecture. This movement pursued the rational use of modern materials and principles of functionalist planning and established a visual aesthetic largely inspired by the machine. It was part of an architecture employing the language of vertical and horizontal volumes and planes, floating flat roofs, masses set against voids and monumentality. Though modest in scale and form, the design of the shelters is characteristic of work in this idiom. The reusable shelters were often sited under fig trees, to aid in camouflage. The first of Costello's reusable designs is the pillbox with double-cantilevered roof slab, or \\"park\\" type shelter. In an original list of all the shelters constructed by the Brisbane City Council, these were simply labelled as \\"cantilever\\". They had four central piers supporting the roof slab, which allowed for the removal of the four blast walls after the war. There was an entrance at each end of the front wall, where an internal wall extended into the shelter. If the walls were made of brick, the shelter's dimension was by by high, and if concrete was used the dimensions were by by high. The difference was due to the fact that the brick walls finished in line with the top of the roof slab, covering the fascia, whereas the concrete walls finished at the soffit of the roof slab, flush with the fascia. The minimum wall thickness for brick was set at 13.5\\", and 12\\" for concrete. The roof slab was intended to have at least four inches of concrete. Of the 37 reusable shelters listed as being of the park type only 17 survive: one at Hefferan Park in Annerley; two at Albert Park; two at Wickham Park; one in Buranda Playground in Woolloongabba; two in Raymond Park in Kangaroo Point; and one each at Kelvin Grove, Morningside, Nundah, Stones Corner, and Windsor. Four other shelters stand on East Street and Wickham Street in Fortitude Valley. Most are used as simple park shelters, as intended, but the shelter at Nundah has been modified as a toilet block, and the shelter at Kelvin Grove is used as a bus shelter (as distinct from those shelters in the next category, which were specifically designed as bus\\" type shelters). About half of the surviving park shelters had concrete blast walls, while half used brick. The second design was the pillbox with single-cantilevered roof slab, or \\"bus\\" type shelter, as it was called in the original Brisbane City Council list. These were designed so that the three brick blast walls could be removed after the war, leaving a concrete back wall and five brick piers at the front. Again, entrances were at each end of the front wall. Of the 19 \\"bus\\" types listed only two survive, at Newmarket and Newstead. The third design was also a \\"bus\\" type shelter, but it was built with a stone rear wall, instead of concrete, and six stone piers were later added, instead of five brick piers. The three brick blast walls could be removed as normal. Two of these \\"colonnade\\" types were built-referred to in the Brisbane City Council list as \\"bus (stone)\\" and only one survives, at King Edward Park. Most of the Brisbane structures built for the war were removed at the end of World War Two. The saltwater mains, slit trenches, and sirens disappeared, as did the many standard pillboxes that had stood in the middle of the streets of the Central Business District. 156 standard pillboxes were built, but none of the surviving public shelters in Brisbane City Council ownership are of that design. Of the 21 special shelters, only the one on Queens Wharf Road survives. However, of Costello's 58 reusable public surface shelters, 20 have survived; the removal of their blast walls, as planned, had given them a renewed purpose. The worker's shelters at the Story Bridge Hotel and Howard Smith Wharves also still exist. The blast walls of the air raid shelter at Windsor were removed according to plan after World War Two, although evidence of the location of the walls is still visible. An electricity box and conduits have been introduced, and parts of the roof and floor slabs have been truncated.  Description  Roof, 2015 The Windsor air raid shelter is a rectangular concrete structure comprising a heavy floor slab and a flat roof supported by concrete piers. It is unpainted, and the floor slab and roof slab have been truncated at the northeast corner, where the road reserve narrows to a point. An unused electricity box and wiring remains visible on the south side of the second pier from the south, and there is evidence of two earth closet partitions inside the shelter. An electrical trench has been cut and re-cemented along the centre of the floor slab. A mature fig tree stands nearby.  Heritage listing  Windsor Air Raid Shelter was listed on the Queensland Heritage Register on 6 April 2005 having satisfied the following criteria. The place is important in demonstrating the evolution or pattern of Queensland's history. The Windsor air raid shelter is important as a part of the Air Raid Precaution activities that were implemented for the defence of Brisbane during World War Two. Designed to afford protection to the civilian population of Brisbane in the event of air raid attacks or other emergencies, the air raid shelter located at the corner of Lutwyche Road and Stoneleigh Street is important in demonstrating the impact of World War Two on the civilian population of Brisbane The place demonstrates rare, uncommon or endangered aspects of Queensland's cultural heritage. Although many air raid shelters were constructed during World War Two in Queensland, comparatively few survive. Also, there are not many types of structures built by the Brisbane City Council during World War Two, for wartime purposes, which survive. The place is important in demonstrating the principal characteristics of a particular class of cultural places. The shelter's solid construction, rectangular shape, and its siting near a population concentration, demonstrate the principal characteristics of a World War Two Brisbane public air raid shelter. The place is important in demonstrating a high degree of creative or technical achievement at a particular period. The Windsor air raid shelter, now used as a shelter on a road reserve, demonstrates the secondary uses that were part of the original design intention. The shelter is a durable example of innovative design and use of concrete technology during World War Two. The place has a special association with the life or work of a particular person, group or organisation of importance in Queensland's history. The air raid shelter is important as an example of the wartime work of the City Architect's Office and particularly the work of City Architect F.G. Costello.

It has been practiced for centuries, with supporters of culling generally arising from the angling community. Culling techniques may involve the killing of birds, the destruction of eggs or both. Historically, culls have occurred to protect the interests of recreational and commercial fishermen who perceive the animals to be competing with them for their intended catch or for the prey of their intended catch. Since the 1960s, the growing aquaculture industry has undertaken cormorant culls to protect its farmed fish and crustacean stocks. Opponents of cormorant culling include conservation groups such as the National Audubon Society, Cormorant Defenders International and Sea Shepherd.  Target species  The target species are primarily the double-crested cormorant in North America and the great cormorant in Europe, Japan and Australia. The little black cormorant has also been targeted in Australia. In Africa, the reed cormorant is targeted and shot.  Double-crested cormorant  Double-crested cormorant Before Europeans became a major presence, double- crested cormorants lived throughout much of their current North American range, usually in populations far greater than 21st century observations. After birdwatching near Natchez, Mississippi in December 1820, John James Audubon reported: > ‚ÄúWe saw to day probably Millions of those . . . Cormorants, flying > Southwest‚Äîthey flew in Single Lines for several Hours extremely high.‚Äù No comparable numbers of the birds can be seen today. After a protracted period of cormorant population reduction due to expanding human settlement, breeding habitat loss and persecution in the forms of shooting and egging, a turning point for the species was reached in 1972. The National Audubon Society listed the double-crested cormorant as a species of special concern. The state of Wisconsin declared cormorants endangered and began building nesting structures to help them return. The use of DDT was banned, a chemical agent which was proven to thin cormorant eggs and had impacted recruitment since its introduction following World War II. Congress also signed a revised Migratory Bird Treaty Act granted cormorants federal protection. Since that time, the species has been recovering. Catfish and baitfish aquaculture have grown rapidly since the 1960s, particularly in the south-eastern United States. Open aquaculture ponds provide winter or year-round homes and food for cormorants on the species' long-established migration route. This has also led to conflict and prompted culling at aquaculture facilities. Cormorants‚Äô effect on the aquaculture industry is significant, with a dense flock capable of consuming a harvest. Cormorants are estimated to cost the catfish industry in Mississippi alone between $10 million and $25 million annually. The double- crested cormorant is the only species appreciably found inland in the United States.  Methods   Shooting  Shooting is the most commonly employed and immediately effective method of cormorant culling. Sharpshooters are sometimes hired to undertake the work (Shiga prefecture, Japan) and in some jurisdictions, hunters are issued permits to allow them to kill these otherwise protected birds (South Carolina, United States). Birds can be shot on the water, on the wing, or at their breeding sites.  Egg smothering  The smothering of eggs with food-grade corn oil is another method employed by authorized persons. Once applied, the eggs' porous surface, which allows the transport of oxygen, becomes clogged with oil. The parent birds continue to incubate the oiled eggs, which ultimately fail to hatch.  Culling by region  Cormorant culling has occurred in many countries including Australia, the United Kingdom, Germany, Estonia, Japan, the United States and Canada.  Australia  The culling of cormorants occurred in Australia from the 1900s to the 1960s for the purposes of reducing competition with recreational and commercial fisheries. In some cases, bounties were offered as incentives to encourage people to hunt the birds. Primary target species included the little black cormorant and great cormorant.  New South Wales  In New South Wales, a bounty was in place for a number of years prior to 1919. It was discontinued as inland cormorant populations continued to be replenished via migration and it was proven to be ineffective in preventing fish losses. During the bounty period approximately 44,000 cormorants were killed.  Queensland  Since the development of the aquaculture industry, cormorants have been responsible for some stock losses including at commercial prawn farms. In Bowen, Queensland, the use of non-lethal methods to deter the animals from settling on farm ponds and feeding on farmed prawns has been adopted in favor of culling.  South Australia  In April 1905, the South Australian government inaugurated a bounty of 1d per head of cormorant or freshwater turtle. Prior May 1908, 25,537 cormorant heads were paid for, and 89,333 turtles. Most of the cormorants came from Kangaroo Island and Franklin Harbor rookeries and the turtles were caught in the Murray River and its lakes. In the year 1909‚Äì1910, 3183 cormorants were destroyed in South Australia, with bounties paid for their heads. During the same period, 18,706 turtles were also culled as both animals were considered 'enemies' of fish. The total combined bounty paid was ¬£91 4/. Opponents of the cull argued that cormorants were responsible for keeping toadfish and leatherjacket numbers in check on Kangaroo Island, and that these fish, feeding on the larvae of other fish, likely had a greater impact on reducing quantities of preferred target species than the cormorants' own fishing practices. They argued that the animals should be protected, not hunted.  Tasmania  In Tasmania in 1954 a bounty on the heads of cormorants was proposed at 5/ per head. The proposal was supported by anglers, who expressed their concern at the animal's impact on trout populations inland. The bounty was raised from 3/6 to 5/- to encourage people to hunt the birds. Tasmania's Northern Fisheries Association responded by planning a special 'black cormorant day' of hunting.  Canada  In New Brunswick, cormorants are classified as a varmints. As such, holders of a varmint hunting license can kill them in unlimited numbers between early March and late September each year. On Middle Island in Lake Erie, the double-crested cormorant population is managed by the Canadian government. The first three breeding pairs were seen on the island in 1987, and over the following twenty years their population increased to over 5,000 pairs. Pressure on the island and lake's other species via competition, habitat alteration and predation created the case for culling as a management strategy. In 1998, a group of fishing guides undertook an unauthorized cull, shooting cormorants on Little Galloo Island in Lake Ontario. Estimates of the scale of the cull range from 800 to 2000 birds. It is a federal offence to kill a protected bird, and eventually the perpetrators were brought to justice.  Japan  Great cormorant In 2013, the Japanese population of great cormorants, Phalacrocorax carbo, was estimated to be over 100,000 birds. Conflict between increasing great cormorant populations and the ayu (or ayu sweetfish Plecoglossus altivelis) has led the Japanese government to implement cormorant culling. The ayu is one of the most popular species for commercial and recreational fisheries in Japan. In the Shiga prefecture, great cormorants have been responsible for impacts to forests (through alteration of habitat and guano deposition) and fisheries (through predation). At the Lake Biwa rookeries, between 10,000 and 25,000 cormorants were shot annually between the years 2004 and 2012 (with the exception of 2008, during which no birds were shot). Since 2009, sharpshooters have been employed by the government to undertake the culling, replacing hunters.  United Kingdom  In 2010, 2000 cormorants were culled in the United Kingdom under special licences according to the Royal Society for the Protection of Birds. The animals have been protected from arbitrary killing in the UK since 1981. A cull for environmental protection purposes is underway at Haweswater, United Kingdom where cormorants are killed for the protection of schelly, an endangered whitefish species.  USA  In thirteen states of the United States, aquaculture producers may shoot cormorants which feed on their stock in private ponds. They may also call upon government wildlife managers to shoot birds found roosting nearby. Local managers in twenty-four states are allowed to suffocate cormorant eggs with oil, destroy their nests, or kill cormorants that threaten public resources, such as wild fish, plants, and other birds‚Äô nesting areas. Individuals and states are permitted to kill a total of 160,000 cormorants each year. An average of about 40,000 cormorants are reported killed each year‚Äîperhaps amounting to 2 percent of North America's population. The kill statistics do not include the tens of thousands of eggs oiled annually. In 2000, an unauthorized cull was undertaken on Little Charity Island in Saginaw Bay, Michigan that killed more than 500 cormorants. Despite lacking the required permits to kill the protected species, the perpetrators were not brought to justice. In the span of one month, commencing in February 2014, hunters culled 11,653 double-crested cormorants during a licensed action in South Carolina. 1,225 permits were issued to hunters to kill cormorants during this period. One hunter alone reported killing 278 birds. Similar hunts occurred in Indiana, Michigan, Minnesota, New York, Ohio, Vermont, and Wisconsin in 2013, resulting in a combined total cull of 21,312 cormorants. The culling was unsuccessfully opposed by the Audubon Society. A cull of 16,000 double-crested cormorants along the Columbia River in Oregon has been proposed to commence in 2015 and is intended to reduce pressure on salmon stocks.  Environmental impacts  The long-term ecological effects of cormorant culling are uncertain and disputed. Cormorant numbers are effectively reduced during culls, but the targeted species remain in recovery after centuries of arbitrary killing and habitat loss. A paucity of dietary studies also means that the impact cormorants have on commercially important species (with the exception of pond-based aquaculture) are difficult to estimate. One unintended consequence of cormorant culling is that managers who enter nesting grounds to cull or oil eggs may cause more harm to other bird species in the process than the nesting cormorants do themselves.  Alternatives to culling  The primary justification for the culling of cormorants is to reduce pressure on wild or farmed fish populations. It has been suggested that humans have caused the damage to fisheries and aquatic ecosystems through overfishing, introduction of exotic species and pollution. It has been further suggested that money spent trying to manage cormorants could be better used in reducing coastal pollution, securing conservation land and marine preserves, and assisting aquaculture producers and fishermen to develop new bird conservation practices.

It was built by USAAF 81st Air Depot Group and the Allied Works Council. It was added to the Queensland Heritage Register on 5 August 2003.  History  The former Allison Testing Stands was an aero engine testing facility constructed in three stages during 1942-43 for the purpose of static testing of engines from the General Motors-Holden's Ltd overhaul plant at Breakfast Creek, Brisbane. Simple and functional in design, the site encompasses six open stands constructed by servicemen of the 44th Depot Repair Squadron of the USAAF 81st Air Depot Group; two enclosed engine stands constructed by the Allied Works Council; two open stands of unknown construction; and a concrete pavement area which is the site of former associated buildings. The first Allison Testing Stands were constructed on the eastern side of Schneider Road and the Eagle Farm Aerodrome in November‚ÄìDecember 1942 as a consequence of arrangements made for Australia to serve as a stronghold for United States (US) operations in the Pacific during World War II (WWII). The area, however, had previous links with aviation. The original Eagle Farm Aerodrome The original Eagle Farm Aerodrome, west of Schneider Road, was established by the Civil Aviation Branch of the Department of Defence in 1922 as the civilian landing ground for the city of Brisbane. Prior to this the site had been used for dairying by previous owners, David Wilson and William Lynn. Other dairy farms continued to operate nearby, most significantly that on the eastern side of Schneider Road on sub A allotment 4 portion 3, Parish of Toombul, County of Stanley which from 1922 was owned by George Franklin. To foster the development of civil aviation at Eagle Farm the Civil Aviation Branch constructed a government hangar (1924) and a caretaker's cottage (1925). In 1927, in its first expansive step away from Longreach, Queensland, Qantas erected a hangar and commenced operations there of the Brisbane Flying School. By late 1930 Queensland Air Navigation Ltd operated scheduled services north to Townsville from Eagle Farm Aerodrome, while Australian National Airways Ltd flew passengers south to Sydney. Archerfield Aerodrome The effects of years of above-average rainfall on the low-lying estuarine land forced the Civil Aviation Branch in 1928 to establish an alternate site where future expansion would not be restricted. In 1931 Archerfield Aerodrome, to the south of the city, was designated Brisbane's aerodrome. Both the government and QANTAS hangars were reconstructed there that year. The Eagle Farm site reverted to grazing land leased by Margaret Wilson and David Campbell. By arrangement, on weekends members of the Brisbane Gliding Club conducted flights using a winch launch. Interior view of GMH Allison Overhaul Assembly Plant during World War Two Not until the first half of 1940 was the Eagle Farm site reconsidered as a landing ground for powered aircraft. It served as a relief landing ground for pilots from the Royal Australian Air Force's (RAAF) No. 2 Empire Flying Training School based at Archerfield Aerodrome until late 1941. Eagle Farm as an Air Force aerodrome The attack on Pearl Harbor on 7 December 1941 hastened the strategic role Australia played in providing the bases and armaments needed to fight the war in the Pacific. Well placed to the south of battle lines and with resources of labour that could be allocated to the purpose, Brisbane played a primary role. At Archerfield companies such as Aircraft Pty Ltd, Australian National Airways Pty Ltd, and QANTAS commenced the repair and maintenance of aircraft, including engine overhaul, for the United States Army Air Forces (USAAF). From mid-January 1942 an Aircraft Erection Depot was established for the USAAF on the Eagle Farm aerodrome site. Constructed at an eventual cost of over , it served initially as an aerodrome where aircraft shipped to Australia could be reassembled. Later, captured enemy aircraft were test-flown and assessed by the Allied Technical Air Intelligence Unit based in Second World War Hangar No. 7. The Queensland Main Roads Commission and its contractors extended the original Eagle Farm aerodrome to accommodate three runways and eight hangars. Such was the pressing need for these facilities that, where necessary, American service personnel participated in the construction. Repair and maintenance of aircraft The repair and maintenance of aircraft was another matter. From 1939, companies in other Australian states had been involved in manufacturing aircraft engines for the RAAF, notably the Gipsy Major engines for DH82 Tiger Moths and single-row Wasp radial engines for the Wirraway fighter. From the beginning of 1942, as part of the general gearing up of industry in Queensland, aviation companies commenced the overhaul of aircraft engine for the USAAF. Australian National Airways Pty Ltd at Archerfield Aerodrome produced its first two reconditioned radial engines in May 1942. Initially their mobile engine testing facility, consisting of an engine mount framework and control cabin on the chassis of a truck, was sufficient. The Allison Engine The Allison engine was, however, an in-line, liquid-cooled, V12 engine. The Allison company operated in the United States from the 1920s. In 1935 it was taken over by General Motors. To overhaul the numbers of Allison in-line engines needed for aircraft such as the Kittyhawk fighter, the Australian subsidiary of this company, General Motors-Holden's Ltd, was contracted in the latter half of 1942 to establish an overhaul and assembly plant in an igloo warehouse at Breakfast Creek. At its peak, this dedicated facility was capable of overhauling ten engines per day. Initially 180 men and women were employed. The site later doubled in size and approximately 530 workers were employed there. As in the other aircraft repair workshop, many were women who had had no previous experience with aircraft components. From a monthly output of three engines in December 1942, the Breakfast Creek plant increased to a peak of 116 engines per month in April 1943. Subsidiary contractors such as the Toowoomba Foundry were involved in the re-boring of engine block components. All reconditioned engines had to be tested. Supplied by the USAAF for this purpose were field units believed to be of the \\"Jacobsen\\" brand. Each comprised one fully equipped control cabin and two barrel type engine stands on four circular legs. Above the control cabin were the reservoirs of fuel and oil needed to \\"run-in\\" and test the new engines. Inside the control cabin an operative monitored a series of instruments, keeping a log of temperatures and pressures as each unit was brought gradually up to maximum rpm and run at this \\"red-line\\" speed for five minutes. The test schedule for each engine involved up to an hour to set up, then several hours to test-run and de-rig. Extension of Eagle Farm Aerodrome From June 1942 Commonwealth representatives processed the compulsory acquisition of land encompassed by the first extension to Eagle Farm Aerodrome. Included was the dairy on sub A allotment 4 portion 3 on the eastern side of Schneider Road operated in 1942 by Clara M. Franklin and her son. Here the fixed testing stands for the planned output of Allison engines were constructed. All buildings, other than the original farmhouse, were demolished. Enclosed stands, 2015 Members of the USAAF 81st Air Depot Group, a unit formed in May 1942 and based at Eagle Farm, erected the first six stands in October‚ÄìNovember 1942. Around this time a system of connecting roadways were constructed around the stands and adjacent to the north, a hut. Only men were employed here in the round-the-clock shifts of Australian civilians and American servicemen. On 13 August 1943 a reporter for the Courier-Mail described the work as the \\"noisiest war job\\" (p4). Complaints about the noise by Brisbane residents possibly influenced the design of the next two enclosed testing stands, plans for which were drawn up in March 1943. Including contingencies, their estimated cost was . As these two brick sound-proofed stands, a slab for a warehouse to the immediate north of the earlier hut, and the additional two open stands also erected in 1943 were to the north of the original row of six, more land was required. For the purpose of this 1943 extension to the testing stands, resubdivisions 1-30 of sub C of allotment 4 of portion 3 of Parish of Toombul County of Stanley initially were hired through the RAAF. Not all the land was needed though. Resubdivisions 1-6, upon which most of the extension's buildings were constructed, belonged to Christopher Gills. New testing facility at Rocklea Also influencing the construction of this extension was a May 1943 request by General Douglas MacArthur for an engine overhaul capacity within Australia of 1,950 engines per month, 600 per month of which would be Allison engines. To cope with these projected numbers, several buildings within the former Rocklea Munitions Works were converted for aircraft engine overhaul. Such a large output required a new testing facility, planned for construction in a Rocklea quarry. Originally 42 test cells with 21 control cabins were envisaged. It was hoped these especially designed brick structures would reduce the noise level of continuous testing to the point where it did not affect the health of operators, or be a nuisance to nearby residents. Following progressive downgrading of overhaul operations in Brisbane from July 1944, only eight of the Rocklea engine test cells were completed. Downgrade of Air Force requirements Priorities changed as the Pacific war moved further away from Australia. Fewer aircraft engines were overhauled in Brisbane. The departure for New Guinea in April 1944 of the 81st Air Depot Group added impetus to the discontinuation of operations. The field units of control cabins and engines stands were removed. The permanent testing stands at Eagle Farm were described as not having been in use for some months by late December 1944. Return of Eagle Farm to civilian use When the Eagle Farm airfield was returned to civilian use after the war, the Allison Testing Stands were simply left standing. Aerials and historic photos indicate that sometime between 1944 and 1946 the hut to the north of the stands was removed. Part of the northernmost enclosed testing stands was converted for storage with the installation of two concrete block walls. Aerial photographs from the period indicate that between 1974 and 1978 the warehouse was removed or demolished. Change of use of Eagle Farm Aerodrome land Eagle Farm airport was closed in 1988 when a new airport was constructed to the north. In 2002 the Brisbane City Council acquired the airport site from the Commonwealth. The land was transferred to TradeCoast Land Pty Ltd in 2005 and a master plan was prepared to guide its development as an office park and for warehousing. The testing stands along with Hangar No. 7 are now the only structures remaining from the use of the site as a major airfield during WWII.  Description  Concrete remains at the south end, 2015 Enclosed stand's internal roof, 2015 The site comprises four sections, six open engine testing stands constructed in 1942, two enclosed testing stands constructed in 1943, two open stands constructed in 1943 and the concrete flooring and footings of a hut and warehouse. The chief characteristic of the site is the functional nature of the design of each section. The most prominent features of the six open engine testing stands constructed in 1942 are the six reinforced concrete walls which separated the testing stands and provided a degree of protection against excessive noise or a propeller malfunction. Stands 1 to 4, numbered from the north, have been constructed on a raised concrete platform above ground level. Parts of its flooring have been raised higher above the general level of the platform. They indicate the positions where each engine stand and its respective control cabin would have stood. Most of the remaining evidence of the purpose and working life of the site is on the platform. Of the monorail above each engine, only the vertical I-beams, cut off at their base, indicate where they were situated. Engines and propellers were manoeuvred into position using a block and tackle which ran along this monorail. Four steel circles set in the concrete, the legs of the barrel-type engine stands cut off at their base, show the engine stand position. What remains of the timber sleeper and bitumen floor along the frontal width of stands 1 to 4 delineates the position of the propeller arc. Drum caps, steel plates and pieces of cloth are embedded in the bitumen. The two enclosed stands from 1943 have been constructed using brick walls set on a concrete foundation. The pattern of the thick walls is a variation of English bond. The roof of each is reinforced concrete and features eight vertical fins. The southern enclosed stand is open at both its eastern and western ends and has a concrete floor. Two doors and two windows open towards the central area in which a brick control cabin with a reinforced concrete roof is located. The design and construction of the northern enclosed stand mirrors that of the southern one. The horizontal I-beam section of a monorail, rated for a maximum loading of , is positioned close to the ceiling at the eastern end of this stand. Of the two walls built to protect workers in the two open testing stands constructed in 1943, only one remains standing. The control cabin that served both stands is built of concrete, while two distinct, raised platforms on each side of the control cabin, both with the circular footprints of the barrel-type stands, attest to the position of the test engines. Oil residue indicates the position of the propeller arc. To the north-west of the enclosed test stands are the concrete footings of a hut constructed in 1942. Immediately north of this are the footings and concrete floor of a warehouse constructed in 1943. Both are surrounded by concrete pavement. Most sections of the stands site have altered little since the fixtures used for engine testing were removed, however modern concrete block walls constructed to ceiling height in the northern enclosed testing stand have created a secure room occupying approximately one third of the structure.  Heritage listing  Allison Testing Stands (former) was listed on the Queensland Heritage Register on 5 August 2003 having satisfied the following criteria. The place is important in demonstrating the evolution or pattern of Queensland's history. The Allison Testing Stands site is important in demonstrating the evolution or pattern of Queensland's history, in particular the period of rapid mobilization of available resources in Queensland in 1942-43 for the Pacific theatre of war during World War II. The place demonstrates rare, uncommon or endangered aspects of Queensland's cultural heritage. The site demonstrates rare aspects of Queensland's history. Until the mass overhaul of engines during World War II necessitated fixed testing sites, the task of engine testing was a mobile activity. Of the two fixed testing facilities constructed in Brisbane during the war, only this site, which incorporates three different designs of testing stand, has survived. The place has a special association with the life or work of a particular person, group or organisation of importance in Queensland's history. Because of its position in the aero engine overhaul process, the Allison Testing Stands site has a special association with the group of Queensland civilians whose labour for the Aircraft Production Commission contributed to the war effort. Most had no previous experience with the engineering aspects of aircraft engine overhaul.

Even the mind (conditioned consciousness), along with intellect and ego, merges in this space of unconditioned Pure Consciousness through the paths of devotion, knowledge and action. It is also associated with the ajna chakra, the guru chakra, positioned in the stomata behind the centre of the forehead. Yoga Vasistha speaks about the bhutƒÅkƒÅsha ‚Äì dealing with gross matter, chittƒÅkƒÅsha ‚Äì dealing with mental concepts and chidƒÅkƒÅsha with the ƒÅtman . These are spaces projected by the mind but all spaces are reduced to one, that is, to the ultimate space which is one‚Äôs own true self. ChittƒÅkƒÅsha is the field of the mind which provokes a deeper enquiry because there is in it still the duality of the 'seer' (drg) and the 'seen' (drshya); this duality ceases to exist in chidƒÅkƒÅsha which is the field of Pure Consciousness viewed by the mind non-casually. Different mental spaces are seen when the mind ventures outwards to see all that which exists externally, but what already exists externally exists within contained in the inner mental space whose nature is different in different planes, and because consciousness functions variously in varying dimensions depending upon fineness of matter, the number of dimensions and the varying subtlety of the mind. ChidƒÅkƒÅsha is the result of Divine Ideation which makes the world a mental projection that functions within time and space to give itself a semblance of reality. ChidƒÅkƒÅsha also means the space of consciousness and the space behind the forehead which is the seat of visualization that links man with the conscious, subconscious and super-conscious and also the object of meditation or ishta deva; it helps gain insight into the connection between the two confronting worlds ‚Äì the higher that is beyond all objects and thought and the lower which is the material world of senses. Subtle vision is developed through practice of ChidƒÅkƒÅsha dhƒÅranƒÅ. BhutƒÅkƒÅsha is the space outside, the outside world of objects that the senses meet and a mere reflection of the infinite within; ChidƒÅkƒÅsha is the space within which having turned the mind inwardly the sublime objectless infinite is to be realized through AdhyƒÅtma VidyƒÅ. In his Vivekachudamani, Shankara reminds that the first means to yoga is control of speech, then cessation of sense organ activity, control of mind and control of intellect. He states:- :‡§∏‡§Æ‡§æ‡§π‡§ø‡§§‡§æ‡§Ø‡§æ‡§Ç ‡§∏‡§§‡§ø ‡§ö‡§ø‡§§‡•ç‡§§‡§µ‡•É‡§§‡•ç‡§§‡•å ‡§™‡§∞‡§æ‡§§‡•ç‡§Æ‡§®‡§ø ‡§¨‡•ç‡§∞‡§π‡•ç‡§Æ‡§£‡§ø ‡§®‡§ø‡§∞‡•ç‡§µ‡§ø‡§ï‡§≤‡•ç‡§™‡•á :‡§® ‡§¶‡•É‡§∂‡•ç‡§Ø‡§§‡•á ‡§ï‡§∂‡•ç‡§ö‡§ø‡§¶‡§Ø‡§Ç ‡§µ‡§ø‡§ï‡§≤‡•ç‡§™‡§É ‡§™‡•ç‡§∞‡§ú‡§≤‡•ç‡§™‡§Æ‡§æ‡§§‡•ç‡§∞‡§É ‡§™‡§∞‡§ø‡§∂‡§ø‡§∑‡•ç‡§Ø‡§§‡•á ‡§§‡§§‡§É |: \\"If the mental functions are established in the true, unchanging, Higher Self, Brahman, this awareness of the phenomenal world is not experienced.

He is told about Brahman shining brightly in the sky ( akasha ) in subtle ether, in the sky of the ChidƒÅkƒÅsha the infinite all ‚Äìpervading subtle space of Consciousness ; the Self which produces all movement in the universe, shines in the ChidƒÅkƒÅsha lighting up all worlds gross and subtle because of the emanation of Om.

The towns of Chopaka and Nighthawk effectively died off when the search for local gold proved fruitless and the Burlington Northern Railroad ceased operations in the middle of the 20th century. Canada has had a Customs office at this crossing since 1907; another crossing at Chopaka Road on the west side of the Similkameen River was equally popular until the US barricaded the road in 1964. The crossing is the least-used in Washington, with only a few cars a day. The area west of the station is the most remote part of the contiguous US on the border, through the Cascade Mountains. The next border crossing to the west is the Sumas-Huntingdon Border Crossing, which is 125 miles from Nighthawk-Chopaka. However, many hikers on the Pacific Coast Trail cross between North Cascades National Park and Manning Park without reporting at the nearest official Port of Entry as they are supposed to. History Canadian border station at Chopaka Canada first provided customs services at Chopaka in 1861, but didn't establish a permanent presence until 1907, when the Vancouver, Victoria and Eastern Railway was constructed.Legg, Herbert (1962). Customs Services in Western Canada, 1867-1925; a History, The Creston Review Ltd., Creston, BC, Page 54 Prior to 1950, most of the cross-border traffic in this area occurred about 2 miles to the west, on the western side of the Similkameen River. Canada built its current border station on Nighthawk Road in 1950. For many years, the US operated its border inspection services out of a trailer that was situated directly against the Canada‚ÄìUS border, as Similkameen Road parallels the border before turning northward at the Canada border station. In 1952, the Nighthawk border station was closed for over a year due to lack of funds. In 1962, the US built a small brick border station at this crossing. A new $6 million facility was completed in 2012. Nighthawk is a station of the Oroville Port of Entry.

Three years later, he made his official debut in the senior division and eventually claimed a silver in the 70-kg class at the 1997 World Taekwondo Championships in Hong Kong, losing the final to Egypt's Tamer Hussein. In 2003, Negrel reached the pinnacle of his sporting career, as he secured a gold medal victory over Iran's Yousef Karami and a spot on the French Olympic squad in the 80-kg class at the World Olympic Qualifying Tournament in Paris. At the 2004 Summer Olympics in Athens, Negrel qualified for the French squad in the men's welterweight class (80 kg), by topping the field of fighters and granting a berth from the World Olympic Qualifying Tournament in Paris. As the top seeder of the prelim draw, Negrel opened his match with a powerful 13‚Äì10 victory over Dutch taekwondo jin Patrick Stevens before he fell in a stunning 17‚Äì24 defeat to Azerbaijan's Rashad Ahmadov in the quarterfinals.

Background PNU was subdividing a property in Wanaka. In October 2001, whilst the subdivision consent was tied up in the Environment Court, they entered into a conditional sale with the Ansleys for $1.05 million, on the proviso that PNU obtained the necessary consents by 28 February 2002. Due to PNU not following up the consent in a timely manner, the consents did not eventuate until after this date, and as a result PNU claimed the Ansleys contract was at an end, leaving PNU to sell the property to a 3rd party for a higher price. The Ansleys unsuccessfully sought specific performance for the transaction, and sued PNU for account of the profit they made on the resale of the property. PNU argued that the contract was at an end. The Ansleys argued that the contract only ended due to PNU not pursuing the consent in a proper manner. Held The court held that PNU had not pursued the consent in a proper manner, and awarded the Ansleys PNU's profit on the resale.

It is the largest grid-connected, \\"privately-funded solar power plant in Sub-Saharan Africa, outside of South Africa\\". Location The power station is located in Soroti District east of the town of Soroti in the Eastern Region of Uganda, approximately by road north-east of Kampala, the country's capital and largest city. Overview The power station has a 10 megawatt capacity. Its output is sold directly to the Uganda Electricity Transmission Company Limited for integration into the national grid. The power is evacuated via a substation near the station. It has been estimated that the energy generated could power approximately 40,000 homes located near the station, thereby minimizing transmission losses. The power station, which consists of 32,680 photovoltaic panels, is Uganda's first grid-connected solar plant. The power station sits on of land. Developers The power station was developed by a consortium of Access Power MEA (through its subsidiary Access Uganda Solar), a company based in the United Arab Emirates,\\"ACCESS POWER TO DEVELOP SOLAR ENERGY PLANT IN UGANDA\\", Access Power MEA, 27 November 2015, accessed 3 October 2016 and TSK Electr√≥nica y Electricidad, a company based in Spain. They won the competitive bidding and were awarded the development contract at the same time as the developers of the Tororo Solar Power Station. Construction costs, funding, and commissioning The construction costs were US$19 million. The project received partial funding from the European Union Infrastructure Trust Fund through KfW. On 12 December 2016, the solar plant was switched on.

Course The creek begins high in the northwestern ramparts of the plateau- like Clear Range, and its upper course is between eroded mountainsides that are actually only the flanks of the flat summits of the range. In the midst of its course, as with most other tributaries of the Fraser in this region, it cuts through benchlands formed by old lake beds via a steep canyon. The benchlands are ranchland and have been at times irrigated for alfalfa and other crops. History On one of those benchlands is the Keatley Creek Archaeological Site, which was once a large riverside housepit (quiggly hole or kekuli) village. Of great antiquity like Xa:ytem in the Fraser Valley, the site is among the most important in Canada and has been exhaustively studied and documented by archaeologists. Investigations have been led by Brian Hayden of Simon Fraser University, who dubbed the largest pithouse in the site as \\"Coyote's Big House\\" in the title of one of his works, as the trickster-being Coyote is important in local legends and name-stories. What caused the demise of the village's society is as yet unknown, though a landslide blocking the Fraser near Texas Creek, south of Lillooet, may have critically destroyed the local indigenous fishery. Alternative theories put emphasis on relative over- population and resource over-exploitation in the context of climate change. The large village is one of the biggest of its kind found to date in the Mid- Fraser.

She spent many years detained in labour camps in the Soviet Union, but she remained a committed Communist throughout her life. She received the name by which she is known, Trude Richter, neither by birth or marriage. The name Trude Richter was conferred on her, originally as a cover name, in January 1931 when she joined the Association of Proletarian-Revolutionary Authors (\\"Bund Proletarisch- Revolution√§rer Schriftsteller\\"), an organisation with close connections to the German Communist Party, of which Richter was also a member. Life Erna Barnick was born at the tail end of the nineteenth century in Magdeburg, then in northern central Germany. Her father was a senior official locally with the postal service. She attended an academically focused school in Danzig and then trained to become a teacher, taking a teaching job in 1919 on the island of Poel, a short distance along the coast to the east of Hamburg. Between 1920 and 1924 she undertook a university course at Berlin and, from 1923, Frankfurt am Main, studying philosophy, history, theologyUrsula K√∂hler-Lutterbeck, Monika Siedentopf, Lexikon der 1000 Frauen, Verlag J.H.W. Dietz Nachfolger GmbH, Bonn 2000, , Page 299 and a wide ranging German studies course that included history of art. She received her doctorate in 1924, and in the same year took a post as a school teacher. She undertook further teacher training during 1924‚Äì1926 emerging with a full qualification for teaching German Studies and History at academic secondary level. She also became involved in a Communist student group in connection with which she undertook several trips abroad. From 1926/27 Barnick lived in partnership with the writer and Marxist economist/sociologist academic Hans G√ºnther (1899‚Äì1938). In 1930 or 1931 she joined the Communist Party, and in 1931 she relocated from the north to Berlin. In January 1931 she joined the Association of Proletarian- Revolutionary Authors, becoming the association's First Secretary in 1932 on the recommendation of Johannes R. Becher who had been a co-founder of it. At the same time, Trude Richter, as she later became known, continued with her teaching career, now in Berlin-Wilmersdorf. She began to use the name \\"Trude Richter\\" for her contributions to the Frankfurt \\"Workers' Newspaper\\" (\\"Arbeiterzeitung\\") in order to be able to continue with her teaching work, in respect of which she was a state employee. In January 1933 the NSDAP (Nazi party) took power and lost little time in establishing a one-party state in Germany. Membership of political parties (other than of the Nazi party) was banned which meant that political activities undertaken on behalf of the Communist Party became illegal. Richter nevertheless continued her political resistance work under the new regime. She helped to hide people whom state agencies wished to persecute, undertook courier work between Berlin and Prague and contributed material for illegal publications until April 1934, when she emigrated, initially to Prague and from there to the Soviet Union. Her partner, Hans G√ºnther, was by now already there and was working at the Communist Academy and as a writer. In Moscow Trude Richter was able to complete her post-doctoral dissertation and taught at the Moscow Pedagogical for modern languages. During the next couple of years she pursued her teaching career and produced at least one text-book for language teaching. On 3 November 1936 she took Soviet citizenship; the next day, on 4 November 1936, Richter and her partner Hans G√ºnther were both arrested and placed in pretrial detention. No trial took place but at the end of 1937 she was nevertheless sentenced to five years of detention in one of the Gulag Labor camps and a lifetime ban. In fact, she had been expelled from the Communist Party in January 1937, a couple of months after her initial detention. Grounds for her sentencing were recorded as [alleged] Counter-revolutionary and Trotskyite activities. On 17 August 1938, she was transferred to the Kolyma concentration camp region in the eastern interior of the Soviet Union, first in the North East \\"Ispravitel'no-trudovoj\\" Rehabilitation Camp and then in the \\"Teka\\" \\"Ispravitel'no-trudovoj\\" Dalstroy Rehabilitation Camp. Richter's partner, Hans G√ºnther, also found himself taken to the Kolyma region, but died from Typhus on 10 November 1938 in a transit camp at Vladivostok.

Between 1946 and 1949 she was employed as a cloakroom attendant at the Gorki Theatre in Magadan where she was also able to help out with the stage sets and in the orchestra. On 23 August 1949 she was rearrested, her party membership ban was again invoked, and she was deported to Ust-Omchug which was the Gulag administrative centre for the Tenka rehabilitation camps. Here she was assigned to the mining administration division. It was around this time that Trude Richter attempted to hang herself but the suicide attempt failed because the rope snapped. Between 1950 and 1953 she was given work playing the piano in the culture club and taught foreign languages as part of an adult education programme. In 1953 she was released from Ust-Omchug. She was able to move back to Magadan where she returned to work at the theatre. Her formal political rehabilitation by the Soviet Supreme Court was completed in 1956/57 after the well-regarded German writers Anna Seghers and Johannes Becher had intervened on her behalf. It was also with the help of Ann Seghers that she was permitted to leave Magadan and, after an absence of more than twenty years, return to what had been central Germany and had by now become the German Democratic Republic where she started a new life in the south of the new country, in Leipzig. Between 1957 and 1966 she taught at the city's Johannes R. Becher Institute for Literature (as it was known at that time). Here she would later be remembered as a mentor for a younger generation of writers including Hans Weber (1937‚Äì1987) and Horst Salomon (1929‚Äì1972). She published contributions to the socialist literary canon on her own and had already begun, in the 1960s, to write down her experiences in the Soviet prison camps. In 1972 she published the first volume of her memoirs under the title \\"The Badge\\" (\\"Die Plakette\\"). However, publication of her complete memoirs, including her periods in detention, was not initially permitted in East Germany. Her full autobiography appeared posthumously under the title \\"Said to be dead\\" (\\"Totgesagt\\") in 1990. In 1987 Trude Richter became a member of the East German Writers' Association.

All Saints Church is a member of the Anglican Communion and the Church of England and the style of worship is Modern Catholic. There are three regular Sunday services at 8:00am, 10:00am and at midday. The building Built to serve the growing suburb of East Sheen, the building's foundation stone was laid on 28 October 1928 by Elizabeth Bowes-Lyon (who was then the Duchess of York and later became Queen Elizabeth The Queen Mother). The church was built on land bequeathed under the will of Major Shepherd-Cross, MP for Bolton, who lived at nearby Palewell Lodge from 1896 until his death in 1913. It was consecrated on All Saints' Day 1929. The architects were J E Newberry & C W Fowler. Fire destroyed much of the nave in 1963, and the roof was later rebuilt. The building includes a stained glass window commemorating Suzy Lamplugh, the estate agent who went missing in 1986, and who was, with her family, a member of All Saints congregation. The window was installed in her memory in 1996. The terracotta Stations of the Cross were sculpted by Nathan David. The church has a lady chapel which is used for the early morning service on Sundays and for other services during the week. There is also a church hall.

Alcorn had posted a suicide note to her Tumblr blog, writing about societal standards affecting transgender people and expressing the hope that her death would create a dialogue about discrimination, abuse and lack of support for transgender people. Assigned male at birth, she was raised in Ohio by a family affiliated with the Churches of Christ movement. At age 14, she came out as transgender to her parents, Carla and Doug Alcorn, who refused to accept her female gender identity. When she was 16, they denied her request to undergo transition treatment, instead sending her to Christian-based conversion therapy with the intention of convincing her to reject her gender identity and accept her gender as assigned at birth. After she revealed her attraction toward males to her classmates, her parents removed her from school and revoked her access to social media. In her suicide note, Alcorn cited loneliness and alienation as key reasons for her decision to end her life and blamed her parents for causing these feelings. She killed herself by walking into traffic on the Interstate 71 highway. Alcorn arranged for her suicide note to be posted online several hours after her death, and it soon attracted international attention across mainstream and social media. LGBT rights activists called attention to the incident as evidence of the problems faced by transgender youth, while vigils were held in her memory in the United States and United Kingdom. Petitions were formed calling for the establishment of \\"Leelah's Law\\", a ban on conversion therapy in the U.S., which received a supportive response from U.S. President Barack Obama. Within a year, the city of Cincinnati criminalized conversion therapy. Alcorn's parents were severely criticized for misgendering Leelah in comments that they made to the media, while LGBT rights activist Dan Savage blamed them for their child's death, and social media users subjected them to online harassment. Alcorn's parents defended their refusal to accept their child's identity and their use of conversion therapy by reference to their Christian values.  Life  Alcorn was one of several children. She described herself as being raised in a conservative Christian environment; she and her family attended the Northeast Church of Christ in Cincinnati, and she had been featured in a profile of that church published in a 2011 article in The Christian Chronicle. As of 2014, the family lived in Kings Mills, Ohio. According to her suicide note, Alcorn had felt \\"like a girl trapped in a boy's body\\" since she was four, and came to identify as a transgender girl from the age of fourteen, when she became aware of the term. She rejected the name she was given by her parents, and in her suicide note signed herself \\"(Leelah) ~~Josh~~ Alcorn\\". According to her note, she immediately informed her mother, who reacted \\"extremely negatively\\" by claiming that it was only a phase and that God had made her a male, so she could never be a woman. She stated that this made her hate herself, and that she developed a form of depression. Her mother sent her to Christian conversion therapists, but Alcorn later related that there she only encountered \\"more Christians\\" telling her that she was \\"selfish and wrong\\" and \\"should look to God for help\\". Aged sixteen, she requested that she be allowed to undergo transition treatment, but was denied permission: in her words, \\"I felt hopeless, that I was just going to look like a man in drag for the rest of my life. On my 16th birthday, when I didn't receive consent from my parents to start transitioning, I cried myself to sleep.\\" Alcorn publicly revealed her attraction to males when she was sixteen, as she believed that identifying as a gay male at that point would be a stepping stone to coming out as a transgender female at a later date. According to a childhood friend, Alcorn received a positive reception from many at Kings High School, although her parents were appalled. In Alcorn's words, \\"They felt like I was attacking their image, and that I was an embarrassment to them. They wanted me to be their perfect little straight Christian boy, and that's obviously not what I wanted.\\" They removed her from the school, and enrolled her as an eleventh grader at an online school, Ohio Virtual Academy. According to Alcorn, her parents cut her off from the outside world for five months as they denied her access to social media and many forms of communication. She described this as a significant contributing factor towards her suicide. At the end of the school year, they returned her mobile phone to her and allowed her to regain contact with her friends, although by this time, according to Alcorn, her relationship with many of them had become strained, and she continued to feel isolated. Two months before her death, Alcorn sought out help on the social media website Reddit, asking users whether the treatment perpetrated by her parents constituted child abuse. There, she revealed that while her parents had never physically assaulted her, \\"they always talked to me in a very derogatory tone\\" and \\"would say things like 'You'll never be a real girl' or 'What're you going to do, fuck boys?' or 'God's going to send you straight to hell'. These all made me feel awful about myself, I was Christian at the time so I thought that God hated me and that I didn't deserve to be alive.\\" Further, she explained, \\"I tried my absolute hardest to live up to their standards and be a straight male, but eventually I realized that I hated religion and my parents.\\" On Reddit, Alcorn also disclosed that she was prescribed increasing dosages of the anti-depressant Prozac. In concluding her post, she wrote, \\"Please help me, I don't know what I should do and I can't take much more of this.\\" Alcorn's computer was recovered near the site of her suicide. It contained conversations showing that she had planned to jump off the bridge that crosses Interstate 71 days before the incident, but then contacted a crisis hotline and, as told to a friend, \\"basically cried my eyes out for a couple of hours talking to a lady there\\".  Death  Prior to her death on December 28, 2014, Alcorn scheduled for her suicide note to be automatically posted on her Tumblr account at 5:30 pm. In the note, she stated her intention to end her life, commenting: She expressed her wish that all of her possessions and money be donated to a transgender advocacy charity, and called for issues surrounding gender identity to be taught in schools. The note ended with the statement: \\"My death needs to mean something. My death needs to be counted in the number of transgender people who commit suicide this year. I want someone to look at that number and say 'that's fucked up' and fix it. Fix society. Please.\\" A second post appeared shortly after; titled \\"Sorry\\", it featured an apology to her close friends and siblings for the trauma that her suicide would put them through, but also contained a message to her parents: \\"Fuck you. You can't just control other people like that. That's messed up.\\" An additional, handwritten suicide note reading \\"I've had enough\\" was found on her bed, but then thrown away by Alcorn's mother after police made a copy. In the early morning of December 28, police informed news sources that she had been walking southbound on Interstate 71 near Union Township when she was struck by a semi-trailer just before 2:30 am near the South Lebanon exit. She died at the scene. It is believed that Alcorn walked three to four miles from her parents' Kings Mill house, before being struck. The highway was closed for more than an hour after the incident. An investigation was launched by the Ohio State Highway Patrol, while Alcorn's body was transported to the Montgomery County coroner, where an autopsy was scheduled. The truck driver was uninjured in the incident. Within 48 hours of the posting of her suicide note, it had attracted 82,272 views, and by the morning of December 31, it had been reposted on Tumblr 200,000 times. Writing for the Boston Globe, the reporter Maura Johnston described it as a \\"passionate post\\". The suicide note was later deleted after Alcorn's parents asked for it to be removed, and the blog was made inaccessible to the public. According to the family minister, the Alcorn family decided to hold the funeral privately after receiving threats. Alcorn's body was reportedly cremated. The Ohio State Patrol completed their investigation into Alcorn's death on April 30, 2015, officially ruling it a suicide.  Reaction   Alcorn's parents  On December 28 at 2:56 p.m., Alcorn's mother, Carla Wood Alcorn, posted a public message on the social media website Facebook, stating: \\"My sweet 16-year-old son, Joshua Ryan Alcorn, went home to Heaven this morning. He was out for an early morning walk and was hit by a truck. Thank you for the messages and kindness and concern you have sent our way. Please continue to keep us in your prayers.\\" Carla Alcorn's post was subsequently deleted, and her Facebook account was made private. The Alcorn family publicly requested that they be given privacy to grieve in a statement issued by the Kings Local School District. In that statement, staff from Alcorn's former school, Kings High School, declared that \\"Joshua Alcorn was a sweet, talented, tender-hearted 17-year-old\\", adding that counselors would be made available to students affected by the incident. A moment of silence was held in Alcorn's memory before a Kings High basketball game on December 30. alt=A middle-aged white man with dark hair, wearing a dark top, talking in front of a microphone Some of Alcorn's sympathizers publicly criticized the teen's mother, Carla Alcorn, for misgendering her daughter in the Facebook post announcing the teenager's death. Some individuals‚Äîtermed \\"the Internet's self-appointed vigilantes\\" in The Washington Post‚Äîsubsequently doxed and harassed Carla via her Facebook account \\"in revenge\\" for Leelah's death. On Twitter, American gay rights activist Dan Savage argued that Alcorn's parents should be prosecuted for their role in bringing about their daughter's death, commenting that through their actions they \\"threw her in front of that truck\\". He cited the successful prosecution of Dharun Ravi following the suicide of Tyler Clementi as a legal precedent for such an action. He added that legal action should also be brought against the conversion therapists who had counseled Leelah, and suggested that the Alcorns should lose custody of their other children. Carla Alcorn responded to such criticism in an interview with CNN, stating \\"we loved him unconditionally. We loved him no matter what. I loved my son. People need to know that I loved him. He was a good kid, a good boy.\\" Although acknowledging that Leelah had requested transition surgery, Carla stated that she had never heard her child use the name \\"Leelah\\", before reiterating her refusal to accept her child's transgender status, adding \\"We don't support that, religiously.\\" She expressed concern that users of social media thought her to be a \\"horrible person\\", but defended her actions in dealing with her child, stating for example that she had banned internet access to prevent access to \\"inappropriate\\" things. In an email to Cincinnati-based channel WCPO-TV, Leelah's father Doug Alcorn wrote, \\"We love our son, Joshua, very much and are devastated by his death. We have no desire to enter into a political storm or debate with people who did not know him. We wish to grieve in private. We harbor no ill will towards anyone. ... I simply do not wish our words to be used against us.\\" Writing for Salon, Mary Elizabeth Williams commented that \\"it would be cruel and inaccurate to suggest that Carla Alcorn did not love her child\\", but added that Carla's statement that she \\"loved him unconditionally\\" revealed \\"a tragic lack of understanding of the word 'unconditionally', even in death\\". People magazine quoted Johanna Olson, Medical Director for the Center of Trans Youth Health and Development at Children's Hospital Los Angeles, as stating that \\"Did Leelah's parents love her? Yes, I'm sure they did. Did they support her? No, they didn't. And that's a tragedy.\\" Mara Keisling, the Executive Director of the National Center for Transgender Equality, was quoted as stating that the blaming of Alcorn's parents was unhelpful, adding, \\"Despite the great cultural and policy advances transgender people have made, there is still a lot of disrespect, discrimination and violence aimed at us. And being a child or a teenager of any kind today is very difficult.\\"  Tributes, vigils, and activism  alt=A selection of lit candles arranged along a grey stone wall The day after Alcorn's suicide note was published online, Chris Seelbach, the first openly gay councilman on Cincinnati City Council, shared it as part of a Facebook message in which he stated that her death showed how hard it was to be transgender in the U.S. His post was shared over 4,700 times and increased public awareness of the incident. By December 30, Alcorn's death had attracted worldwide attention. News outlets across the world had picked up the story, and the hashtag #LeelahAlcorn had topped Twitter. According to British newspaper The Independent, the incident \\"triggered widespread anguish and raised a debate about the rights of transgender people\\". The U.S.-based Boston Globe stated that it \\"served as a flashpoint for transgender progress in 2014\\", while The New Republic referred to it as having \\"sparked a national conversation about the plight of transgender kids and the scanty rights and respect our society affords them.\\" On January 1, 2015, the Cincinnati-based LGBT rights group Support Marriage Equality Ohio hosted a vigil for Alcorn outside Kings High School. A candlelight vigil in Goodale Park, Columbus, was held on January 2 by a group called Stand Up 4 Leelah. A further vigil was organized by both The Diverse City Youth Chorus in partnership with the Cincinnati chapter of the Gay, Lesbian and Straight Education Network at the Clifton Cultural Arts Center for January 10. The vigil location at the Clifton Cultural Arts Center was moved to the Woodward Theater, to make way for a larger setting. The event was attended by over 500 people. A January 3 vigil was scheduled for Trafalgar Square in London; an organizer was quoted as saying that \\"[Alcorn's] death was a political death. When a member of our community is brutalised at the hands of oppression we must all fight back\\". Those who spoke at the event included politician Sarah Brown and novelist and poet Roz Kaveney. Marches were carried out in honor of Alcorn in both Northwest, Washington, D.C., and Queen Street, Auckland, on January 10. The same day, a candlelight vigil was held in New York City's Columbus Circle. A memorial protest against conversion therapy and in memory of Alcorn took place in Lynchburg, Virginia, on January 24, 2015. Among the transgender celebrities who publicly responded to the incident were Janet Mock, Andreja Pejiƒá, and Laverne Cox, while the musician Ray Toro released a song, \\"For the Lost and Brave\\", in dedication to Alcorn. Jill Soloway, the writer of the television show Transparent, dedicated their Golden Globe Award for Best Television Series to Alcorn. During Diane Sawyer's interview with Caitlyn Jenner (then Bruce), which confirmed Jenner's transgender identity, Alcorn was mentioned by name and the message \\"Fix society. Please\\" was broadcast. In June 2015, the singer Miley Cyrus founded the Happy Hippie Foundation, an organization to raise awareness of homelessness and LGBT issues among young people, partly in response to Alcorn's death.() To promote the organization, she released a new series of Backyard Sessions videos, the second of which, Dido's \\"No Freedom\\" was dedicated to Alcorn. After reading about Alcorn's death, British musician Declan McKenna was inspired to write a song, \\"Paracetamol\\", which was included on his debut album What Do You Think About the Car? and discusses the media's representation of LGBT communities.https://www.theguardian.com/music/musicblog/2016/may/11/declan- mckenna-the-story-behind-paracetamol Carolyn Washburn, editor of the Ohio newspaper The Cincinnati Enquirer, stated that the incident \\"raises important issues we hope will prompt conversations in families throughout our region\\". Washburn had also received letters that derided the newspaper's use of Alcorn's chosen name in covering her death. When contacted by The Cincinnati Enquirer, Shane Morgan, the founder and chair of transgender advocate group TransOhio, stated that while 2014 witnessed gains for the trans rights movement, Alcorn's death illustrated how \\"trans people are still being victimized and still being disrespected\\", highlighting the high rate of transgender people who had been murdered that year. Since the incident, TransOhio received letters from parents of transgender children describing how Alcorn's death had affected them. Morgan stated that while he understood the anger directed toward Alcorn's parents, \\"there's no excuse for threats to the family.\\" Allison Woolbert, executive director of the Transgender Human Rights Institute, informed The Independent that Alcorn's case was \\"not unique\\"; the newspaper highlighted research from the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention indicating that LGBT youth are about twice as likely to attempt suicide than heterosexual, cisgender teenagers. Newsweek similarly placed Alcorn's suicide within its wider context of transphobic discrimination, highlighting that the Youth Suicide Prevention Program reports that over 50 percent of transgender youths attempt suicide before the age of 20, and that the National Coalition of Anti-Violence Programs recently published a report indicating that 72 percent of LGBT homicide victims in 2013 were transgender women. Kevin Jennings of the Arcus Foundation also situated Alcorn's death within wider problems facing young LGBT people. In his view, she became \\"an international symbol of the ongoing challenges faced by LGBT youth\\", adding that her death \\"reminds us of a basic lesson still being taught to young people across America: When it comes to gender identity, it's best to be cisgender; and when it comes to sexual orientation, it's best to be straight.\\" Under the Twitter hashtag #RealLiveTransAdult, many transgender people posted encouraging tweets for their younger counterparts, while other hashtags, such as #ProtectTransKids, and the term \\"Rest in Power\\", also circulated on Twitter. A change.org petition was set up calling for Leelah's chosen name to be included on her gravestone, which gained over 80,000 signatures. On January 6, Adam Hoover of Marriage Equality Ohio remarked that, since the request of having Alcorn's chosen name on her gravestone seemed \\"like a slim possibility\\", they would be raising money for a permanent memorial arranged as a bench, tree and commemorative plaque. Under Ohio's Adopt-a-Highway program, a group adopted the interchange of Interstate 71 South and Ohio State Route 48‚Äîwhich was where Alcorn died‚Äîand dedicated it to her memory. As a result, the Ohio Department of Transportation erected signs stating \\"In Memory of Leelah Alcorn\\" along the road. Members of the group affixed a wreath to one of these signs; group member Lisa Oravec informed press that \\"We don't want Leelah to be forgotten... We want people in Cincinnati, or anybody driving down 71 to see the wreath. See the highway. If they don't know who Leelah is they'll google it, educate it, and learn from what happened.\\" As of December 2018, the \\"Leelah Alcorn Highway Memorial\\" group continued to meet four times a year to clean that stretch of road. The highway memorial formed the basis of a short documentary, Leelah's Highway, which was screened at the 2018 Cindependent Film Festival in Cincinnati's Woodward Theater. Its creator, Elizabeth Littlejohn of Toronto, stated that \\"as a human rights activist who believes [in] the right for gender self-determination, I believe this story needed to be told.\\"  Leelah's Law  alt=A middle-aged, mixed race man with brown skin and closely cropped, greying hair smiling at the viewer. He is wearing a suit with a blue tie, with a small lapel badge containing the flag of the United States. A Facebook group called \\"Justice for Leelah Alcorn\\" was established, while a petition calling for \\"Leelah's Law\\", a ban on conversion therapy in the United States, was created by the Transgender Human Rights Institute to raise awareness of the psychologically harmful effects of such practices; by January 24 it had 330,009 signatures, and was named the fastest growing change.org petition of 2014. A second appeal demanding the enactment of \\"Leelah's Law\\" was posted to the We the People section of WhiteHouse.gov on January 3, 2015, which garnered more than 100,000 signatures as of January 30. In response to the petition, in April 2015 President Barack Obama called for the banning of conversion therapy for minors. In December 2015, Cincinnati became the second U.S. city after Washington, D.C., to ban the practice of conversion therapy outright; council member Chris Seelbach cited Alcorn's suicide as an influence in the decision and stated that \\"she challenged us to make her death matter, and we're doing just that\\". By October 2018, four cities across Ohio had banned conversion therapy, leading journalist Nico Lang to comment that \\"the Buckeye State has become an unlikely leader in banning conversion therapy at the local level.\\"  See also  * List of LGBT-related suicides * List of people from Ohio * List of transgender people * Suicide of Blake Brockington  References   External links  * Archive of Alcorn's Tumblr blog * PDF of the Ohio State Highway Patrol investigatory form * \\"A Girl Who Looked Like A Boy\\", poet Athol Williams reading the poem he wrote in memory of Leelah Alcorn Category:2014 in LGBT history Category:2014 in Ohio Category:Suicide in 2014 Category:Deaths by person in the United States Category:LGBT people from Ohio Category:Suicides in Ohio Category:Transgender law in the United States Category:Female suicides Category:December 2014 events in the United States Category:LGBT-related suicides Category:Transgender and transsexual women Category:Pedestrian road incident deaths Category:Warren County, Ohio ","title":"Suicide of Leelah Alcorn"},{"id":"44889647","text":"Salebriaria fasciata is a species of snout moth.

Texas Creek is also the name of the rural neighbourhood in the area of the creek, and also that of the Texas Creek Ranch which is one of the larger holdings.BC Names/GeoBC entry \\"Texas Creek\\" Course The creek's course is very mountainous, rising in the higher basins of the northeastern Lillooet Ranges and plunging through a steep canyon for most of its course, broken only by flanking benchlands at the bottom of the mountains, which is the location of the rural community in this area. The upper canyon is wide enough to allow road construction, and logging roads lead to the highest basins with mining roads and hunting trails leading over the range into the Stein River basin wilderness and along ridges to other high summits of the Lillooet Ranges north and south. The community is a satellite community of Lillooet, and its residents are represented in local governance as part of Electoral Area 'B' of the Squamish-Lillooet Regional District. History The creek is in St'at'imc territory, and some Indian reserves are in the immediate area, generally those of the T'it'q'et First Nation or, southwards, of Nlaka'pamux bands. Though no legends recounting the events remain, the site is important in St'at'imc pre-history as being the location of a massive landslide, which backed the Fraser up for a hundred miles and more. The lake created by that event sustained a large quiggly hole village near Keatley Creek, about 30 miles upstream in the Glen Fraser area and significantly higher in elevation than the town of Lillooet (the site of which would have been underwater in those times), and is believed to have expired when the natural dam causing the lake finally gave way, with the last known occupancy of that village around 1000 A.D.

He was a member of Liberal Democratic Party. Arafune resigned the Minister of Transport by the alleged abuse of power in 1966. Among these was requiring a National Railway express train to make regular stops at a station located in his own parliamentary constituency. Among his most controversial actions was making a now discredited claim about the death toll of comfort women. This statement has been widely spread, with many books writing that \\"142,000 (or 145,000) Korean comfort women were killed by the Japanese army\\" or \\"Only about 25 per cent of Comfort women have survived\\". Political career He was born in Katashino village, Chichibu District, Saitama currently Chichibu, Saitama in 1907. * April 11, 1946 - November 24, 1980 Member of the House of Representatives * August 1, 1966 - October 14, 1966 Minister of Transport * January 14, 1970 - January 29, 1972 Vice-Speaker of the House of Representatives Comfort women He made a public speech at his home constituency regarding the death toll of Comfort women in 1965: > They (Korean) say Koreans were drafted by Japan during the war and taken > from Korea to work, and those who worked well were used as soldiers, and > 576,000 of those soldiers are now dead. There are claims that 142,000 Korean > comfort women are dead, killed by the Japanese military's sexual abuses. None of the figures given by Arafune have any basis whatsoever. During the 1965 Korea-Japan Treaty negotiations, Korea's position was that 1,032,684 Koreans had been recruited to serve as laborers, soldiers, and personnel, and that 102,603 of these had been injured or had died. This figure differs with the one he gave by 576,000. Moreover, at that time, no mention was made of comfort women. However, many reports and books cited this figure directly or indirectly without fact-checking it. Some examples are as follows: *Karen Parker and Jennifer Chew wrote \\"Only about 25 per cent of these women are said to have survived these daily abuses.\\" citing Arafune's statement. *UN Special Rapporteur Gay J. McDougall wrote in her report to the Commission on Human Rights \\"Only about 25 per cent of these women are said to have survived these daily abuses.\\" citing a book written by Karen Parker and Jennifer Chew. *Stephanie Wolfe wrote \\"Karen Parker and Jennifer F.

He is known for commercial, residential and mixed-use projects and for his philanthropy to aspiring entrepreneurs.  Early life  Arthur Falcone was born and raised in Queens, New York, to first-generation Italian immigrants. His father was a police officer. Falcone attended Nassau Community College, leaving to join McDonald‚Äôs as a management trainee. Early career Arthur Falcone invested in fast food restaurants, hotels and health clubs in New York, along with his brother, Edward Falcone.

The company built single family homes in the cities of Coral Springs, Florida, Parkland, Florida and Weston, Florida. By 2005, it had become the largest private homebuilder in Florida and one of the top 50 homebuilders in the United States. In 2005, the homebuilding assets and operations of Transeastern were sold to Technical Olympic USA (TOUSA) for approximately $857 million.

Real Estate Developments   Plantation Walk  The company purchased the bankrupt Plantation Fashion Mall in Plantation for $37.7 million in 2015. It re-branded the 32-acre project as Plantation Walk in 2017, which will be a mixed-use development comprising office space, luxury apartment rentals, retail, restaurants and hotels. The first phase officially opened in June 2019 with a 172,959-square-foot Class-A office building partially leased by Aetna. That month, the company secured a $121.3 million loan to build 134,326 square feet of retail and 404 apartments. In November 2019, the developers proposed a new site plan for the second phase that included an office building, senior living facility, supermarket and hotel.  Margaritaville Resort Orlando  Falcone Group opened a 184-room hotel on the 320-acre multi-use property in January 2019. A water park named Island H2O Live! followed in June with eight slides, a lazy river and adults- only area. The development includes Sunset Walk at Margaritaville Resort Orlando, a retail development of over 200,000 square feet, and Margaritaville Cottages Orlando, which consists of timeshare-vacation homes whose sales opened in December 2018.

Miami Worldcenter  Miami Worldcenter Associates, led by principals Art Falcone and Nitin Motwani, serves as the master developer for the mixed-use Miami Worldcenter project, a 15 million square foot, mixed-use, master-planned urban development comprising 27 acres in Miami, Florida. The project is the second largest development in the U.S., just behind the 28-acre Hudson Yards, Manhattan project in New York in the United States. The project has attracted over $1 billion in investments to Miami. Miami Worldcenter Associates obtained the Miami City Commission‚Äôs approval of the zoning package and master development agreement for the project in 2014. Construction of the $2 billion- plus project began in late 2014. As of January 2020, all but 2 acres had site plans and development partners. The Caoba apartments with 444 units, opened in March 2019 with 84% of the units leased. A second phase is planned. The 60-story Paramount Miami Worldcenter with 569 condominiums was completed in July 2019 with 90% of units sold at that time. A total of 150,000 square feet of retail was completed in 2019 with another 50,000 square feet under construction. Miami Worldcenter Associates, Forbes Co. and Taubman Centers collaborated on leasing with plans to open stores in 2021. A Marriott Marquis hotel with 1,700 rooms and a 600,000-square-foot convention space is planned. The project was envisioned in 2014 as part of a convention center.

History The base was located at the intersection of Highway 1 and Route 535, approximately 28 km northwest of Chu Lai. Baldy was originally established by the U.S. Army 196th Light Infantry Brigade and was then taken over as the headquarters for the 7th Marines. On the morning of 3 January 1968 the People's Army of Vietnam (PAVN) 2nd Division mortared Baldy as part of a series of attacks on four Marines bases. In August 1969 a logistics support unit of Force Logistic Support Group Bravo was established at Baldy. In late 1969 the 3rd Battalion 11th Marines moved to Baldy. In September 1970 the 7th Marines began to withdraw from the Qu·∫ø S∆°n Valley and the Baldy tactical area of operations as part of Operation Keystone Robin Alpha handing over control to the 5th Marine Regiment. ‚ÄúK‚Äù Battery, 3rd Battalion, 11th Marines at Baldy, March 1970 From 2-15 October 1970 the U.S. Army's Task Force Saint comprising the 2nd Battalion, 1st Infantry, 1st Squadron, 1st Cavalry and a battery from the 3rd Battalion, 82nd Artillery was based at Baldy for Operation Tulare Falls I and returned again as Task Force Burnett from 27-31 October. From 14 October 1970 the 1st Marine Aircraft Wing deployed a force of six CH-46Ds, 4 AH-1Gs and one UH-1E command ship to Baldy on a daily basis from Marble Mountain Air Facility to support 5th Marine quick reaction force (QRF) operations. In late November the Korean 2nd Marine Brigade also stationed a QRF platoon at Baldy. Baldy was a base for Marine combined action and pacification programmes throughout 1969-70. In January 1971 as part of the general drawdown of U.S. forces the 23rd Infantry Division took over the Marines' tactical area of responsibility, but made it clear they would not take over the Marine bases at Baldy, Firebase Ross or Firebase Ryder. On 4 March 1971, Logistics Support Unit 3 at Baldy ceased operations. On 20 March 1971 the Marines turned over Baldy to the ARVN. Current use The base appears to remain in use by the PAVN.

Now in the Gothic architectural style, the church was originally a Romanesque building. Location The church is located in the south of the town of Stege near the peninsula between Stege Bugt (Stege Bay) and Stege Nor (Stege Inlet). It was close to the now demolished Stege Castle which used to stand on the most southerly point of the peninsula on the channel between the sea and the inlet. History It is not clear whether the church, now known as Sankt Hans, was originally consecrated to St John the Evangelist or St John the Baptist. There are several references to Stege in the 13th century including a mention of the parish priest of Stegeborg (Stege Castle) in 1246 at a time when there was a close relationship between the castle (now demolished) and the church. Today the church is an example of a brick Gothic building but in the walls of the nave and tower there are traces of a Late Romanesque structure which was probably built by Jakob Sunes√∏n, a cousin of Bishop Absalon, who ruled M√∏n until his death in 1246. In the second half of the 15th century, the church was rebuilt. Possibly after a fire at the east end of the church, the chancel was replaced c. 1460 by the narrow eastern section of the nave with lateral aisles, followed by a rather wider western nave with aisles and a tower which was completed by 1494. Architecture InteriorThe brick building now has the overall appearance of a Gothic church. It consists of a nave divided into two sections of different breadths, a short polygonal chancel and a west tower. If the chancel was indeed rebuilt in the 1460s, it was no doubt inspired by that of Maribo Cathedral. The original Romanesque nave was divided by centrally located columns but the Gothic reconstruction was higher, had three vaulted bays and lateral aisles. On the north side of the chancel, there is a modern sacristy. The chancel, which also has lateral aisles, terminates with a polygonal eastern end which was completed in the early 16th century before the Reformation. Comprehensive restoration of the building was completed under the leadership of the architect H.B. Storck in 1909. Frescos Frescos from the late 15th century In 1892‚Äî93, Jacob Kornerup discovered and restored frescos from three different periods. Around the Romanesque windows in the nave, there are traces of black and yellow decorations. On the north wall of the main nave there is an unrestored section of little red and white roses framed with black lines, probably from the 14th century. The heightened vaults were decorated with simple, quite primitive decorations. In the western part of the nave, there is a row of grotesque heads in the vaults and on the walls. They include primitive figures of a man and a woman holding each other's hands. Another pair have swords in their hands and are tied together with a rope. There are also lively scenes of dancing and hunting. In addition to the date of 1494 (Anno dni m cd xc iiii) in a rosette, there are paintings of the Tree of Life together with John the Baptist and Mary. Another rosette contains images of apparently unfinished horses. The frescos are said to be related to carnival celebrations. Pulpit The Cartilage Baroque carved pulpit from c. 1632 presents reliefs of the Evangelists on four flat panels framed by herms representing the seven virtues: faith, hope, charity, prudence, justice, temperance and fortitude. Additional reliefs depict the Annunciation, the Nativity, the Adoration of the Magi, the Entry into Jerusalem, the Baptism of Jesus and the Flight into Egypt. The artist is known as M√∏nbo H, the woodcarver who created the altarpiece in Fanefjord Church.

John Struthers (at left, in top hat) with the Tay Whale at John Woods' yard, Dundee, 1884, photographed by George Washington Wilson. Graving dock, North Harbour at Peterhead. The fine, granite-built, graving dock (dry dock) was built in 1855 to meet the needs of the large Greenland whaling ships. Today it is used for the repair of fishing vessels. The first evidence for whaling in Scotland is from Bronze Age settlements where whalebones were used for constructing and decorating dwelling places. Commercial whaling started in the Middle Ages, and by the 1750s most Scottish ports were whaling, with the Edinburgh Whale-Fishing Company being founded in 1749. The last company still engaged in whaling was Christian Salvesen, which exited the industry in 1963. History In the 19th century Arctic bowhead whaling, conducted from ports right along the east coast of the country, was vital for the Scottish jute industry, especially for processing jute fibre in Dundee. Whale oil was also used for street lighting. The two main Scottish ports were Dundee and Peterhead. Greenock was the only significant whaling port on the west coast. Whaling was also conducted on the west coast. A station at Bun Abhainn Eadarra near Tarbert in the Outer Hebrides was founded by the Norwegian Karl Herlofsen in 1904. Later acquired by Lever Brothers it was abandoned by them in 1929. Operations continued under new owners but it finally closed in 1951. Little remains to be seen of the site except the incongruous red brick chimney.\\"Harris, Bunaveneadar, Whaling Station\\". RCAHMS. Retrieved 4 January 2015. The Scottish whaling industry rapidly declined at the beginning of the 20th century, and ended completely in 1963 when Edinburgh-based Christian Salvesen, once the largest whaling company in the world, withdrew from the industry and sold its last two whaling vessels. Although whaling in now considered to be a controversial trade, for many centuries it was a vital element of the Scottish economy. Pioneering role of Scottish whalers in Antarctic exploration The first known photographs of Antarctica were taken during the Scottish whaling expedition of 1892-93. A Dundee whaling fleet, with scientific officers on board, visited the Falkland Islands, the Joinville Island group and the northern Trinity Peninsula. Captain Robertson discovered and charted Active Sound and the Firth of Tay. The fleet encountered Carl Anton Larsen of the Jason, near Joinville Island, on 24 December 1892. Four ships took part: *Thomas Robertson, Active, with Charles W. Donald *Alexander Fairweather, Balaena, with William Speirs Bruce and William Gordon Burn Murdoch *Robert Davidson, Diana *James Davidson, Polar Star The success of the 1892-93 expedition led directly to the Scottish National Antarctic Expedition of 1902‚Äì04, and to Dundee being chosen for building the Discovery for the Discovery Expedition of 1901‚Äì04.

Biography  Born in Amsterdam, Geyer began studies in geology at the University of Amsterdam in 1951 and received his BA in 1953. He continued with studies in sociology and received his MA at the University of Amsterdam in 1961. Later in 1980 he received his PhD under Hiddo M. Jolles with a thesis, entitled \\"Alienation theories : a general systems approach\\". In the 1960s Geyer started working in industry, where he worked in the fields of marketing and labor market research. In 1968 he joined the Interuniversity Institute for Social Science Research (SISWO) at the University of Amsterdam, where he became head of the methodology section. He held this position until his retirement in 1998.

This business communication system is an extension of computer telephony integration (CTI). Overview The interactions between callers and customer service representatives are supported by the collective system of computers, telephones and the Internet. The shift from CTI to contact center telephony is marked by the sheer change in the customer‚Äôs behavior when it comes to communication. Means customers are no longer confined only to voice-based communication i.e. phone to connect with their customer service departments. In addition, they are making use of email, SMS, chat, social media, and other virtual contact channels. This is also the reason for the shift in nomenclature from \\"call centers\\" to \\"contact centers\\", \\"contact\\" being a wider term than \\"call\\". Respecting the trend, contact center owners need to adopt unified communication or multi-channel approach to let customers get in touch with them via their preferred communication mediums, either voice or non-voice (data). Cloud-based phone system is a further advancement in the direction as it allows operators to access all the features and benefits of call center telephony over the Web against an affordable & flexible pay-as-you-go subscription model. Thus, in- house infrastructure deployment to manage public switched telephone networks, storage, communication applications, and collaboration servers is no more an obligation. Neither is the need to invest resources for their upgrade, repair, maintenance and security as cloud vendor would be responsible for the same.  India India, a popular call center business process outsourcing destination, often uses a cloud-based phone system in order to cut operational expenses and downtime, and increase connectivity. Promotion Businesses can rely on contact center telephony services to respond to their customers‚Äô queries over phone, email, chat, fax, etc. Integrating it with their customer relationship management tools, entire contact details of customers and their interaction sessions with different customer service representatives can be found at one place. The combination can manage not just sales and marketing but also deliver excellent post-sales customer service or technical support to allow customers derive the most from their products or services. Hence, it‚Äôs becoming instrumental in increasing customer satisfaction and loyalty and most of the call center services in India are taking refuge from it. The entire contact center telephony service can be availed by professionals over a browser. Hence, businesses can leverage the concept of BYOD (bring your own device) and mobility and serve their customers well using mobile applications. According to market analysts, BYOD increases satisfaction among workforce, and hence their individual and collective productivity as well. BYOD programme significantly reduces the TCO (total cost of ownership) as professionals prefer to work with their own devices rather than using company-provisioned devices. Next, they tend to be more caring towards such devices and can even shell out money to update and upgrade those when required. Integration of IM, along with audio and video conferencing services helps call center or contact center representatives to get real time assistance from their peers or seniors to resolve any complex issues. They can internally exchange information and knowledge articles as and when required. Real-time call monitoring/barging system can be used by quality assessment team to provide important guidelines to agents to maintain the standard of the service as per industry norms. Integrated recording feature is helpful for internal training and quality purposes to improve productivity and customer satisfaction in equal measures. It also helps in getting business insights and improving products or services to gain deeper penetration into the market.

He was the son of Sidney Oswald Spark and writer Muriel Spark.Lodge, David (19 August 2010). \\"The Prime of Muriel Spark\\". [Review of the book Muriel Spark: The Biography, by Martin Stannard]. New York Review of Books 57(13), 60. Prolific in his work, he created more than 1,000 paintings, photographs, and short texts and articles about art, Jewish culture, and his own family. Early life Spark was born in Southern Rhodesia, then a British colony, to Sydney and Muriel Spark. His parents had met in Edinburgh at a dance, and his father had later travelled to Southern Rhodesia, where he worked as a teacher. Muriel had joined Sydney in 1937, and Robin was born the following July in Bulawayo. The marriage soon deteriorated, however, as Sydney, who was 13 years Muriel's senior, suffered from manic depression and had violent tendencies. Sydney refused to divorce Muriel, so Muriel left him, taking Robin with her. They moved first to Cape Town, living in a flat below Princess Frederica of Greece and the young Constantine. Towards the end of the Second World War, Muriel managed to travel back to the United Kingdom by means of a troop ship, but was unable to secure passage for the four-year-old Robin, who was left in a convent school. In September 1945 Muriel brought Robin to Edinburgh. She then went to London to seek work, leaving Robin to be raised by Muriel's parents, the Cambergs, in their flat in Morningside/Bruntsfield. Muriel Spark converted to Catholicism in 1954, but Robin chose to remain loyal to Judaism, much to his grandparents' satisfaction. Muriel did not attend his Bar Mitzvah in 1952, but sent 50 pounds for the party afterwards. Education and careers Robin was educated at the private Daniel Stewart's College in Edinburgh. He left at the age of 16 to pursue a career in the retail jewellery trade. He served his National Service in the Royal Army Medical Corps from 1957 to 1959, after which he studied at night school in order to obtain his Highers. In the late 1960s he entered the Civil Service, in which he worked for 20 years in a variety of departments, ending up as Chief Clerk to the Scottish Law Commission. Despite having never studied art, Spark had always had an interest in the subject and became convinced that he had to pursue a career in it. Udi Merioz, an international artist who was a friend of Robin's, encouraged him to try to get into a college, so he started to attend evening classes at the art college and prepared a portfolio for entrance as a full-time student. He was offered a place at the Edinburgh College of Art and started the four-year course in 1983, graduating with a BA (Hons). He was then awarded an Andrew Grant Scholarship and became an art tutor while continuing his own painting. In 1989, Spark was awarded an Israel Zangwill scholarship. Abstract and figurative work Spark expressed emotion through his predominantly figurative work. He intuitively took liberties with perspective and proportions where doing so helped the composition. There is a strong Jewish feeling in some of his pictures because of his education and family background, and he always signed his paintings in Hebrew. His work also shows the influence of the Scottish colorists, and an interest in the underlying bone and muscle structure of the human body. In his later years his work moved into pure abstract symbolism. Spark used pastels on paper and impasto.

Personal life Robin and his mother, Muriel (Camberg) Spark, had a strained relationship. They fell out when Robin's Orthodox Judaism prompted him to petition for his late grandmother to be recognised as Jewish. Muriel Spark's maternal grandmother, Adelaide Hyams, had married her maternal grandfather, Tom Uezzell, in a church; so it was not clear whether both of Adelaide's parents were Jewish. His mother reacted by accusing him of seeking publicity to further his career as an artist.. During one of her last book signings, in Edinburgh, she responded to an enquiry from a reporter as to whether she would see her son by saying: \\"I think I know how best to avoid him by now.\\".http://www.sandiegoreader.com/news/1998/jul/02/bard-mitzvah/\\"Spark's Son: I Won't Cash In on Mum\\", The Scotsman, 14 May 2006 References  External links  * Web www.samuelrobinspark.com * Obituary: Samuel Robin Spark, Artist.

His clinical practice in Thoracic Surgery and Transplant Surgery is based at the Toronto General Hospital, where he also leads a research team in lung transplantation studies. Dr. Keshavjee gained international recognition for the development of his lung preservation solution for donor lungs en route to transplantation; this solution is now the standard technique utilized by transplantation programs around the world. Further, he broke new ground with his research to the recondition and repair of injured human donor lungs, making them suitable for patient transplantation, using the Toronto XVIVO Lung Perfusion System. His work has allowed for an increase in the number of available donor lungs.  Education and training  In 1985, Dr Keshavjee completed his medical degree at the University of Toronto. He did a comprehensive surgical internship at the Mount Sinai Hospital in 1986. His Research Fellowship and Surgical Scientist Program in the Division of Thoracic Surgery were done at the University of Toronto and Toronto General Hospital in 1989. That same year he received his MSc in the Institute of Medical Science at the University of Toronto. A few years later in 1993, Dr. Keshavjee became a Fellow in Thoracic Surgery at the Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Centre in New York. In 2012 he went to Harvard University, JFK School of Government and Cambridge to obtain a degree in continuing education for Leadership for the 21st Century: Chaos, Conflict and Courage.

Awards Over the course of his career, he has received many awards for his medical contributions. These have included: * The George Armstrong Peters Young Investigator Award * Canada's Top 40 Under 40 Award * The Colin Woolf Award for Excellence in Continuing Medical Education * The Lister Prize in Surgery The Lister Prize in Surgery is the highest award for research achievement that one can obtain within the University of Toronto's Department of Surgery. On February 6, 2013, Dr. Keshavjee was inducted into the Order of Ontario. He has also received two Queen's Jubilee medals in recognition for his work. On December 26, 2014, Dr. Keshavjee was made an officer of the Order of Canada. TED MED At TED MED 2010, Dr. Keshavjee gave a talk entitled ‚ÄòCan a human lung breathe outside the body in which he addressed the process of repairing organs outside the human body. Achievements At his Thoracic Surgery Research Laboratory, Dr. Kehavjee's research interests include lung transplantation, lung injury, and lung preservation. His current studies examine molecular diagnostics and gene therapy strategies for engineering organs for lung transplantation. The Lab's work explores the underlying mechanisms of ischemia-reperfusion injury and bronchiolitis obliterans ‚Äì two areas that limit successful lung transplantation ‚Äì and develops gene therapy strategies for either preventing or reversing them. Several areas within ischemia-reperfusion injury are examined, including the role of complement and cytokine-related lung injury and its relation to reperfusion. The work is done on cell culture models, rat single lung transplant models, and pig single lung transplant models. Lung Preservation Dr. Keshavjee and his research team have developed a technique of lung preservation that can improve lung function after its transplantation. The solution is made from low-potassium dextran and is used in the Ex Vivo. The LPD solution is applied in both the Toronto lung transplant program and in clinical programs around the world. Gene Therapy in Lung Transplantation Dr. Keshavjee's research team focuses its main efforts on the role of gene therapy in lung transplantation. They are currently developing techniques for genetically modifying the donor lung so it can withstand stress during the transplant process. Ultimately, these techniques would be used to address both ischemia-reperfusion injury and obliterative bronchiolitis. Dr. Keshavjee's work has demonstrated that immunosuppression related to transplantation leads to an altered expression of the transgene, and immunosuppression will lead to the prolonged-expression of the transgene. To this effect, he and his team have proved that gene therapy will help recipients recover from lung transplantation surgery without a significant immune system response. When addressing obliterative bronchiolitis in a rat tracheal transplant model of fibrous airway obliteration related to transplantation, Dr. Keshavjee's research showed that the adenoviral IL-10 gene transfection was able to prevent the development of bronchiolitis obliterans. This was the first time that a gene therapy strategy was able to treat this condition; a significant breakthrough as this condition affects over 50% of lung transplant recipients. The team is currently studying the effect of the IL-10 transfection on ischemia-reperfusion therapy, as well as mechanisms of cell death and the genes controlling the process. Toronto Lung Transplant Program Dr. Keshavjee currently serves as the Director of the Toronto Lung Transplant Program, a University of Toronto program that spans across UHN and the Hospital for Sick Children. It began in 1983, and expanded to pediatric lung transplantation surgeries in 1995. Located in the Toronto General Hospital, it has gained international recognition for performing several remarkable firsts, including: First successful single-lung transplant, first successful double lung transplant, first pediatric lung transplant, first pediatric lung transplant with mismatched blood types, first to use an EXVIVO outside of the body, and the first to use the Novalung ventilator to provide more time for those awaiting transplantation. The TLTP uses 40% of the donated lungs it receives, compared to 15% of donated lungs used elsewhere in the world. As a result of Dr. Keshavjee's breakthroughs, there have been steady increases in the number of transplants and the survival rate. While the one-year survival rate for lung transplant recipients is 85% and almost 30% for over 10 years, the TLTP has 22 patients who have survived 20 or more years after receiving their donor lungs. A gene-therapy trial will begin next year. Toronto Ex Vivo Lung Perfusion System (EVLP) Dr. Keshavjee was internationally recognized for his leadership in the development of the Toronto Ex Vivo Lung Perfusion System, which treats and improves high-risk donor lungs outside of a human body so that they can be safely used for transplantation. Donor lungs are placed in ice, with one tube attached to the pulmonary artery and another sewn to a vein used for training blood out of the lung. The lung is then moved onto a steel platform atop the device and hooked to a circuit with a ventilator and heart-lung mimicking machine that pumps the preservation solution into them. As they are brought up to body temperature, they are healed with an anti-inflammatory solution (developed by Dr. Keshavjee). Eventually, the lungs begin to inflate and deflate as they breathe on their own. For several hours, the lungs are monitored for functionality with blood gases, x-rays, bronchoscopies, resistance to the flow of fluid, and whether they are becoming less stiff. If the tests are deemed successful for function, they may go ahead and perform the transplantation.

History  The North Midlands RFU was founded at a meeting in Birmingham on 14 January 1920. The area had previously been part of the Midland Counties Rugby Union, from which Warwickshire split in 1914, with further changes in 1919 leading to Leicestershire Rugby Union becoming a county on its own and North Midlands being created for the Birmingham, Derbyshire, Staffordshire and Worcestershire areas. The majority of the clubs in the union's initial membership came from the Birmingham area. Staffordshire separated from North Midlands in 1964 to become a county on its own.  County team  The North Midlands men's county team play in the County Championship, competing in Division 3.

Background At the time of the coup attempt President Yahya Jammeh had ran away and was out of the country, with sources differing on whether he was in France or Dubai. Jammeh, who himself came to power in the 1994 Gambian coup d'√©tat, had experienced several attempted coups against his regime, and sometimes accused the United Kingdom and United States of being behind said attempts. Previously in November 2014, Jammeh condemned the European Union for its response to increasingly harsh anti-LGBT discrimination under his government. The following month those same measures caused the United States to drop the Gambia from one of its trade programmes.  Planning  In 2013, President Jammeh removed the commander of his Presidential Guard, Lieutenant Colonel Lamin Sanneh. Sanneh then fled to Washington, D.C., he met Njaga Jagne, a fellow refugee from the Gambia and former officer of the Kentucky National Guard. Sanneh, Jagne, and a few others soon conceived a plot to overthrow President Jammeh. Jagne convinced Cherno Nije, a Texan entrepreneur also from the Gambia, to help fund the project. Jagne also recruited Papa Faal and Alhagie Boye, other Gambians and a veterans of the American army, as well as several Gambians living in Europe. Banka Manneh, another Gambian refugee and Sanneh's friend, claimed he would be able to gather a force of 160 soldiers from inside Gambia to assist in the coup. Events On December 30, 2014, the gunmen recruited by the plotters attacked the State House of the Gambia, the official presidential residence. Local media quickly identified them as having entered the country from neighbouring Senegal under the command of Lt Col. Lamin Sanneh. The gunmen engaged in heavy fire with government forces. Soldiers blocked several points of entry to the city, and a full blackout of the state radio and television was placed into effect. The fighting died off later during the day. Banks and other businesses remained closed, with state radio playing traditional music and mentioning nothing of the night's events. Four people, including Sanneh and Njaga Jagne, were killed, and several more injured. With the gunmen failing to consolidate control, the coup failed. Jammeh returned the following day. Jammeh reshuffled his cabinet on January 10.Gambia reshuffles cabinet after coup attempt Aftermath After the coup failed, Papa Faal, one of the co-conspirators, entered the U.S. embassy in Dakar, Senegal seeking protection. However, he was instead interrogated. On January 1, 2015, the U.S. Federal Bureau of Investigation raided homes in Georgia, Kentucky, Minnesota, and Texas as part of an investigation into the coup. That same weekend, the FBI also raided the offices of a Texas development firm. The owner of the Texas firm, Cherno Nije, was arrested at Washington Dulles International Airport and charged with violating the Neutrality Act of 1794. During the raid on Nije's home in Texas, the FBI found a manifesto entitled ‚ÄúGambia Reborn: A Charter for Transition from Dictatorship to Democracy and Development,‚Äù as well as a spreadsheet detailing the coup attempt's $221,000 budget funded by Nije, who was a millionaire. Faal was also charged and later pleaded guilty. Two others, Alagie Barrow of Tennessee and Banka Manneh of Georgia, were also charged. Both later pleaded guilty as well. The Washington Post later revealed that the FBI had interviewed Sanneh at his home in Maryland and thereafter tipped off Senegalese officials about the plot through the State Department. It was reported on 2 April 2017 that corpses of three alleged conspirators, Lamin Sanneh, Alagie Nyass and Njaga Jagne were discovered by the Gambian police, after the fall of the Jammeh regime.

The convent was later completed by Father Juan Gutierrez while the church by Father Pedro Villanova in 1870. A second church was constructed under the term of Father Felix Casas in 1883. The construction was suspended by the presiding bishop in 1891. The second church was completed by Father Eugenio Minguez in 1891 and was consecrated on June 8, 1893. Architectural features The church resembles post-Baroque or the Spanish Colonial Revival architectural style apart from some of the components of the facade. The low entablature does not fit the classical proportions of the Renaissance style. The columns of the first and second levels provide an element of irregular rhythm, as well as the bell tower on the left side.

Early life W. T. Bailey was born in Baylysboro, Ontario on September 22, 1842 to James Joseph and Catherine C. Bailey of England (James) and Canada (Catherine). After gold was discovered in California, James Joseph set out in search of gold and was never heard from again. It is believed he met a violent end. By the age of 10, William Thomas was an orphan. Bailey took a job in the rail road industry to support himself, which he became the purchasing agent for Northwestern Railroad which was headquartered in Chicago, Illinois. Business career In the 1880s, Bailey migrated to Duluth, Minnesota in which his skills as an organizer and businessmen enabled him to start up in a new enterprise, lumber. While corporate offices remained in Duluth, Bailey's company logged extensively in northeastern Minnesota. His mill was found in Virginia, Minnesota, where his son Richard Robert Bailey had local headquarters since 1896. He started his lumber mill in 1897 on Virginia Lake (also known as Bailey's Lake) in Virginia, MN. The lake adjacent to Bailey's Lake is Silver Lake, upon whose shore was the largest white pine mill in the world at its time. This mill was the Virginia and Rainy Lake Lumber Company and was a totally different enterprise and had no relationship to the Baileys. Production of this mill was approximately one million board feet of white pine lumber per day. There is a statue dedicated to the logging, lumbering, and mining industries on the shore of Silver Lake. Bailey's old residence still stands today at 816 5th Avenue South, across the street from the old Coates residence (Coates who owned the Coates Hotel in Virginia). Between William T. Bailey company and Dan H. Moon's company (Moon & Kerr Lumber Co.), it caused the first major economic and population boom of white settlers, businessmen, and pioneers. Before Leonidas Merritt discovered iron deposits in Mt. Iron, the Iron Range main economic force was lumber. After iron was discovered, the lumber industry received ample amount of business from the mines, thus solidifying Bailey's sawmill as one of the major catalysts of industry to happen in Virginia, Minnesota. Bailey's son R. R. Bailey owned 97% of the stock in Bailey's company until it was divided amongst W. T. Bailey & his wife, his other son, and his other daughter (R. R. Bailey's brother, sister, and mother). Bailey's lumber company would remain as a business until 1951 where it was reorganized as Bailey's Town Pump. The main sawmill closed down in 1923. A small resaw mill operated on the same property until the early 1950s (still by the Bailey Corporation) when others bought the retail store and the mill. This then became Pohaki Lumber, which still operates today. Personal life On June 25, 1873, William Bailey married Rebecca Roberts of Michigan (daughter of Richard and Rebecca Roberts of Ottawa, Michigan). Richard Roberts was a prominent lumberman himself. Together, William T. Bailey and Rebecca Bailey had three children: William Thomas Jr., Richard Robert, and Rebecca Bailey. All the family members were involved with the lumber mill and they all held stock within the company. In 1955, Rebecca (Bailey) Raley (daughter of W. T. Bailey) sued for liquidation of the company claiming that Richard Robert and other officials had fraudulently failed to inform her that the company was being reorganized. She stated the corporation failed, therefore the corporation should have been dissolved and the assets distributed. Bailey considered himself a Republican that belonged to the Presbyterian Church. He was affiliated with the Masonic Order & local lodge and was a member of the Independent Order of the Odd Fellows. He was a man deeply devoted to home and family. Death William T. Bailey died on Tuesday, March 31, 1914 at 10 a.m. CST in Rochester, Minnesota the age of 72. The Virginia Enterprise (now known as The Mesabi Daily News) reported on that day that W.T. had died due to surgical complication after undergoing kidney surgery for acute kidney problems. W. T. had gone to meet with Dr. William James Mayo and Dr. Charles Horace Mayo of the Mayo Clinic in Rochester, Minnesota a few weeks prior to the operation. After the operation, William's health declined quickly and was declared dead the following morning. The funeral was set to be held at the family home at 1317 East 1st Street, Duluth, Minnesota on Thursday, April 2, 1914 at 2:00 p.m. CST. Dr. Yost, pastor of the First Presbyterian Church of Duluth presided the event. Honorary pallbearers were Charles d'Autremont, B.F. Smith, A.B. Wolvin, and John Williams. Active pallbearers were Robert Whitesides, Daniel Healy, Frank Smith, Richard M. Sellwood, William Orr, and W. I. Prince. The interment was set for Forest Hill Cemetery in Duluth.

The First Economic Adjustment Programme for Greece, initially called the Economic Adjustment Programme for Greece and usually referred to as the first bailout package or the first memorandum, is a memorandum of understanding on financial assistance to the Hellenic Republic in order to cope with the Greek government-debt crisis. It was signed on 3 May 2010 by the Greek Government under then-prime minister George Papandreou on one hand, and on the other hand by the European Commission on behalf of the Eurogroup, the European Central Bank (ECB) and the International Monetary Fund (IMF). Of the totaling ‚Ç¨107.3 billion of financial assistance, ‚Ç¨72.8 billion were disbursed by 1 March 2012, when the programme was superseded by the Second Economic Adjustment Programme for Greece comprising the undisbursed amounts of the first programme and additional ‚Ç¨130 billion for the years 2012‚Äì14. Background Having had the credit rating agencies further downgrade their assessment of Greece's ability to honour its debts, the risk premiums on long-term Greek government bonds reached record (and unsustainable) levels. On 23 April 2010 the Greek government requested official financial assistance from the rest of the European Union and the IMF. Memorandum of Understanding Former Prime Minister George Papandreou and former European Commission President Jos√© Manuel Barroso after their meeting in Brussels on 20 June 2011. Financial aid On 1‚Äì2 May 2010, European Commission, European Central Bank (ECB) and the International Monetary Fund (IMF), colloquially called the European troika, agreed with the Greek government in a three-year financial aid programme that was outlined in a Memorandum of Understanding. The total amount of ‚Ç¨110 billion would consist of ‚Ç¨80 billion bilateral loan commitments provided by the Eurogroup and pooled by the European Commission in the Greek Loan Facility (GLF), and additional ‚Ç¨30 billion to be provided under a Stand-By Arrangement (SBA) by the IMF, which was headed at the time by Dominique Strauss-Kahn. Instrumental in determining the rates of the individual euro area countries in the ‚Ç¨80bn of the Eurozone was the respective equity interest in the capital of the ECB, which in turn is determined every five years after the prorated share of a country in the total population and economic output in the EU. The German share of the ‚Ç¨80bn was 28%, or about ‚Ç¨22.4bn in three years while France paid ‚Ç¨16.8bn. The amount of ‚Ç¨80 billion to be provided by the Eurogroup was later reduced by ‚Ç¨2.7bn, as Slovakia decided not to participate in the Greek Loan Facility Agreement and as Ireland and Portugal had to step down from the facility themselves requesting financial assistance. Commitments of the Greek government Interim prime minister Lucas Papademos defends the austerity measures in parliament (November 2011). The Greek debt in exchange for household should be consolidated within three years, so that the budget deficit should be reduced by 2014 to below 3 percent. The minutes of the IMF Executive Board were revealed nearly four years later, and highlight amongst other items, the fear that Greek social cohesion could be at risk. The Greek private sector, it was learned in 2014, was amenable to the deal because it curtailed the practice of paying civil servants a 13th and a 14th \\"month\\" each year. This curtailment was impossible for the Greek government to achieve on its own because of the political pressure inherent to the system. Disbursement In May 2010 Greece received the first tranche of the bailout loans totaling ‚Ç¨20bn.Griechenland rechnet mit zweiter Tranche der IWF/EU-Hilfen tagesanzeiger.ch, 30. Juli 2010.

Juli 2011: Zum Abschluss ein L√§cheln The second bailout package would take the form of an ‚Ç¨100bn aid package provided by the newly created European Financial Stability Facility.

Juli 2011: Das zweite Griechenland-Hilfspaket im Detail It was also announced at the EU summit, a reconstruction plan for Greece in order to promote economic growth. The European Commission established a \\"Task Force for Greece\\". ;EU summit (26 October 2011) Polish presidency of the Council of the European Union, 2011 On the night of 26 to 27 October at the EU summit, the politicians made two important decisions to reduce the risk of a possible contagion to other institutions, notably Cyprus, in the case of a Greek default. The first decision was to require all European banks to achieve 9% capitalization, to make them strong enough to withstand those financial losses that potentially could erupt from a Greek default. The second decision was to leverage the EFSF from ‚Ç¨500bn to ‚Ç¨1 trillion, as a firewall to protect financial stability in other Eurozone countries with a looming debt crisis. The leverage had previously been criticized from many sides, because it is something taxpayers ultimately risk to pay for, because of the significantly increased risks assumed by the EFSF. Furthermore, the Euro countries agreed on a plan to cut the debt of Greece from today's 160% to 120% of GDP by 2020. As part of that plan, it was proposed that all owners of Greek governmental bonds should \\"voluntarily\\" accept a 50% haircut of their bonds (resulting in a debt reduction worth ‚Ç¨100bn), and moreover accept interest rates being reduced to only 3.5%. At the time of the summit, this was at first formally accepted by the government banks in Europe. The task to negotiate a final deal, also including the private creditors, was handed over to the Greek politicians. In view of the uncertainty of the domestic political development in Greece, the first disbursement was suspended after Prime Minister George Papandreou announced on 1 November 2011 that he wanted to hold a referendum on the decisions of the Euro summit. After two days of intense pressure, particularly from Germany and France, he finally gave up on the idea. On 11 November 2011 he was succeeded as prime minister by Loukas Papademos, who was to lead a new transitional government. The most important task of this interim government was to finalize the \\"haircut deal\\" for Greek governmental bonds and pass a new austerity package, to comply with the Troika requirements for receiving the second bailout loan worth ‚Ç¨130bn (enhanced from the previously offered amount at ‚Ç¨109bn). One of the German EFSF-leverage critics, Fabian Lindner, then likened the austerity pressure Greece was feeling to the attitude the US exercised over Germany in 1931. In that earlier circumstance, the collapse of an Austrian and then a German bank followed, leading to a worsening of the Great Depression, political change and ultimately war. The analysis was revisited in July 2012, when another commentator saw the situation as yet worse and Germany's pro-austerity stance as hardened, yet more damaging and bringing the risk of a bank-default-trigger, for example, yet closer. The Lindner November 2011 op-ed also ran in Der Zeit. Final agreement (February 2012) The Troika behind the second bailout package defined three requirements for Greece to comply with in order to receive the money. The first requirement was to finalize an agreement whereby all private holders of governmental bonds would accept a 50% haircut with yields reduced to 3.5%, thus facilitating a ‚Ç¨100bn debt reduction for Greece. The second requirement was that Greece needed to implement another demanding austerity package in order to bring its budget deficit into sustainable territory. The third and final requirement was that a majority of the Greek politicians should sign an agreement guaranteeing their continued support for the new austerity package, even after the elections in April 2012. On 21 February 2012, the Eurogroup finalized the second bailout package. In a thirteen-hour marathon meeting in Brussels, EU Member States agreed to a new ‚Ç¨100 billion loan and a retroactive lowering of the bailout interest rates to a level of just 150 basis points above the Euribor. The IMF was to provide \\"a significant contribution\\" to that loan but was only to decide in the second week of March how much that will be. EU Member States would also pass on to Greece all profits which their central banks made by buying Greek bonds at a debased rate until 2020. Private investors accepted a slightly bigger haircut of 53.5% of the face value of Greek governmental bonds, the equivalent to an overall loss of around 75%. The deal implied that previous Greek bond holders are being given, for ‚Ç¨1000 of previous notional, ‚Ç¨150 in \\"PSI payment notes\\" issued by the EFSF and ‚Ç¨315 in \\"New Greek Bonds\\" issued by the Hellenic Republic, including a \\"GDP-linked security\\". The latter represents a marginal coupon enhancement in case the Greek growth meets certain conditions. While the market price of the portfolio proposed in the exchange is of the order of 21% of the original face value (15% for the two EFSF PSI notes ‚Äì 1 and 2 years ‚Äì and 6% for the New Greek Bonds ‚Äì 11 to 30 years), the duration of the set of New Greek Bonds is slightly below 10 years. On 9 March 2012 the International Swaps and Derivatives Association (ISDA) issued a communiqu√© calling the debt restructuring deal with its private sector involvement (PSI) a \\"Restructuring Credit Event\\" which will trigger payment of credit default swaps. According to Forbes magazine Greece's restructuring represents a default. It is the world's biggest debt restructuring deal, affecting some ‚Ç¨206bn of bonds. The creditors are invited to swap their current Greek bonds into new bonds with a maturity of between 11 and 30 years and lower average yields of 3.65% (2% for the first three years, 3% for the next five years, and 4.2% thereafter), thus facilitating a ‚Ç¨100bn debt reduction for Greece. Euro-area Member States have pledged to contribute ‚Ç¨30bn for private sector participation. In case not enough bondholders agree to a voluntary bond swap, the Greek government threatened to and did introduce a retroactive collective action clause to enforce participation. The cash will be handed over after it is clear that private-sector bondholders do indeed join in the haircut, and after Greece gives evidence of the legal framework that it will put in place to implement dozens of \\"prior actions\\" - from sacking underproductive tax collectors to passing legislation to liberalise the country's closed professions, tightening rules against bribery and readying at least two large state-controlled companies for sale by June. In return for the bailout money Greece accepts \\"an enhanced and permanent presence on the ground\\" of European monitors. It will also have to service its debts from a special, separate escrow account, depositing sums in advance to meet payments that fall due in the following three months. This operation will be supervised by the Troika. On 3 March 2012, The Institute of International Finance said twelve of its steering committee would swap their bonds and accept a loss of up to 75%. When all acceptances had been counted at March 9, and after the Greek parliament subsequently had decided to activate a collective action clause for the bonds covered by Greek law, the overall share of Greek government bonds to face a debt swap had reached 95.7% (equal to ). The remaining 4.3% of bond holders covered by foreign law and refusing the debt swap (equal to ), were given two weeks of extra time to reconsider and voluntarily join the swap. When the swap is executed, the bond holders will receive a cash payment on 15% of their original holding, and become issued with new Greek bonds worth 31.5% of their old bonds (covered by 24 new securities). Combined this will result in a 53.5% haircut of the face value, so that the Greek debt pile overall will decrease from its current level at , to a more sustainable level around . On 20 March 2012, the Master Financial Assistance Facility Agreement (MFFA) between the EFSF, the Hellenic Republic, the Hellenic Financial Stability Fund (HSFS) and the Bank of Greece was ratified by the Hellenic Parliament.

Kathimerini.Greece emerges from eurozone bailout programme - BBC History 2012 A Financial Times editorial on 22 February 2012 argued leaders had \\"proved themselves unable to settle on a solution that will not need to be revisited yet again\\", that at best the deal could only hope to remedy one part of the Greek disaster, namely the country's debilitated public finances, though it would not likely even do that. The Eurozone's latest plan did, at least, evince consistency with the currency block's previous behaviour: bank deposits (including repos) in Greece over time. German minister of finance Wolfgang Sch√§uble and Eurogroup president Jean-Claude Juncker shared the scepticism and did not rule out a third bailout. According to a leaked official report from the European Commission, the ECB and the IMF, Greece may need another ‚Ç¨50 billion ($66bn) from 2015 to 2020. In mid-May 2012 the crisis and impossibility to form a new coalition government after elections led to strong speculation Greece would have to leave the Eurozone. The potential exit became known as \\"Grexit\\" and started to affect international market behaviour, as well as causing an accelerated decrease of bank deposits in Greek banks (commonly referred to as a bank-run). In Greece, after all attempts to form a government failed following the parliamentary election in May 2012, a new second election in mid-June had to be announced. The new election led to the formation of a government of national salvation of conservative New Democracy with the social democrat PASOK and democratic socialist DIMAR, supporting continued adherence to the main principles outlined by the signed bailout plan. The new government however immediately asked its creditors to be granted two extra years, extending the deadline from 2015 to 2017 before being required to be self- financed, with minor budget deficits fully covered by extraordinary income from the privatisation program. 2013‚Äì2014 In August 2013, Sch√§uble expressed his expectations that \\"there will have to be another (bailout) program in Greece\\", a remark drawing heavy criticisms by other members of the German governing coalition. However, soon thereafter the head of the European Stability Mechanism (ESM), Klaus Regling added to Sch√§uble's remarks, telling the German business daily Handelsblatt that Greece might need a third bailout package as soon as in 2014. In February 2014, the Troika was reported again to consider offering Greece a third bailout at ‚Ç¨15‚Äì17bn, but now in conjunction with an additional debt relief for old Troika held debt, through expanding the maturity of the EFSF bonds from 30 to 50 years and lowering the interest rate 0.5% for the initial ‚Ç¨80bn debt pile being owed to all other EU member states through the Greek Loan Facility. A decision about this potential third bailout loan, however awaits finalization of the third review of the second bailout programme, and will be conditional Greece comply with all terms specified in that programme - which include final fiscal data should verify that a primary surplus indeed was achieved in 2013. The potential third bailout loan was expected to be finally considered by European Union policy makers in May or June 2014. 2015‚Äì2018 After several months of negotiation, on 12 July 2015, the Greek Prime Minister, Alexis Tsipras came to a bailout agreement with lenders for a new ESM program. Greece will get a loan of up to ‚Ç¨86 billion, which shall be handed to Greece gradually from 2015 until June 2018. This includes a buffer of up to ‚Ç¨25 billion for the banking sector in order to address potential bank recapitalisation and resolution costs. In return, Greece will have to streamline the VAT system and broaden the tax base to increase revenue, reform the pension system, safeguard the full legal independence of ELSTAT, automatically cut public spending to get primary surpluses, reform justice with a view to accelerate the judicial process and reduce costs, implement all OECD toolkit I recommendations, modernise labour market legislation, modernise and strengthen the Greek administration, revoke the laws passed by the Tsipras government counter to the February 20 agreement‚Äîexcept for the one concerning the \\"humanitarian crisis\\"‚Äî or identify clear compensatory equivalents for the vested rights that were subsequently created (e.g. for the rehiring of fired public servants), recapitalize the banks, and privatize 50 billion of state assets. To help support growth and job creation in Greece up to 2020, the European Commission will help mobilise up to ‚Ç¨35 billion to fund investment and economic activity, including in SMEs. The Investment Plan for Europe will also provide funding opportunities for Greece. * On 14 August, after a rancorous all-night debate, the Hellenic Parliament backed the country's new bailout deal, although more than 40 MPs from Syriza voted against the deal and Tsipras had to rely on the support of the opposition: New Democracy, To Potami and PASOK. Following the Parliament's decision, the Eurogroup welcomed the agreement between Greece and its lenders, and initiated the launching of the national procedures required for the approval of the new ESM program. These national procedured were concluded by 19 August, and Greece received the first disbursement of the initial tranche of up to ‚Ç¨26bn. A first sub-tranche of ‚Ç¨10bn will was made available immediately, but in a segregated account at the ESM, destined for bank recapitalisation and resolution purposes. * See also *Greek government-debt crisis *First bailout package (Greece) *Second bailout package (Greece) References Category:Greek government-debt crisis Category:Eurozone crisis ","title":"Third Economic Adjustment Programme for Greece"},{"id":"44890896","text":"Angela ƒêelmi≈° (Serbian Cyrillic: –ê–Ω–≥–µ–ª–∞ –Ç–µ–ª–º–∏—à; born November 5, 1975) is a Serbian-Hungarian female professional basketball player.

It is one of four surviving coastal watchtowers in Gozo, with the others being Xlendi Tower, Mƒ°arr ix-Xini Tower and Isopu Tower. History The Dwejra Tower was built in 1652 during the magistracy of Grand Master Giovanni Paolo Lascaris, and was funded by the Universit√† of Gozo. It is one of the Lascaris towers, and the intention behind its construction was for it to act as a watchtower and guard the surrounding areas from oncoming enemies, most especially pirate landings. This tower, just like the other towers, could communicate to nearby defence fortifications through fire and smoke, at night and during the day respectively. The expenses for running the tower were covered by producing salt from the salt pans near it. It was equipped with three 6-pounder guns in the eighteenth century. In 1744, Grand Master Pinto made going to the Fungus Rock illegal because a fungus which grew there was believed to have medicinal powers, and Dwejra Tower was used as a lookout to prevent anyone climbing on the islet. The tower was manned by the Royal Malta Fencible Artillery between 1839 and 1873. It was then abandoned until 1914, during the time of the First World War, when the King's Own Malta Regiment and the Royal Malta Artillery were dispatched and it was manned by No 3 Company with two, and later four, 12-pounder guns. It was again used in World War II as an observation post, and in 1942 Captain Frank Debono and Carmelo Zahra, who were stationed there, rescued an RAF pilot who had crashed in the bay. The tower was leased to Gerald de Trafford in 1956. It was passed on loan to Din l-Art ƒ¶elwa in a state of complete decay.

It is a hilltop castle located on a cone-shaped hill with a limestone bedrock, in an altitude of approximately 480 m (1574.80 ft) above sea level. The eponymous village at the foot of the castle hill was founded as an adjoined castle settlement, similarly to several other villages in the region. Brekov and Brekov Castle lie in the traditional region of Zempl√≠n. The castle is listed in the National Cultural Heritage list of the Monuments Board of the Slovak Republic. History The castle hill saw human settlement and fortification efforts even before the construction of the medieval castle. Recovered evidence from earlier archaeological research on the hill top and its perimeter revealed the existence of a smaller hill fort of local Slavic tribes during the early Middle Ages. The beginnings of the stone castle date back to the second half of the 13th century. Conservation works Though there were occasional small-scale efforts at conserving certain parts of the castle's masonry during the 20th century, Brekov had mostly been untouched by conservation efforts since it became a ruin in the 17th century (much like other ruined or smaller castles in Slovakia). A concerted and systematic effort at new archaeological research and ruin conservation works on the castle was launched only recently, in the second half of the 2000s. The castle is currently administered by the local historical association Zdru≈æenie na z√°chranu Brekovsk√©ho hradu (ZNZBH, \\"Association for the Salvaging of Brekov Castle\\"), crewed with professional archaeologists, historians, architects and masonry experts, as well as local and regional volunteers. The administration, research and conservation works of the association are conducted in official cooperation with the Brekov municipality and the regional branch of the Monuments Board of the Slovak Republic. Research and conservation efforts have been ongoing since 2007 and have focused on clearing the castle hill of excess vegetation, archaeological research, masonry conservation of the northern walls and former courtyard gate of the Upper Castle and masonry conservation on the 16th century entrance gate of the Lower Castle.

The distal edge of this line curves down toward the apex just before reaching the costa. The forewing colour and pattern is repeated on the hindwings. Adults are on wing from April to October.Bug Guide References Category:Moths described in 1899 Category:Lygropia ","title":"Lygropia rivulalis"},{"id":"44891004","text":"Saint Julian's Tower (), originally known as Torre di San Giuliano and also known as Sliema Tower (), is a small watchtower in Sliema, Malta. It was completed in 1658 as the fifth of the De Redin towers. An artillery battery was built around the tower in 1715. Today, the tower and the remains of the battery are a restaurant. History Saint Julian's Tower was built in 1658 to protect St. Julian's Bay. It follows the standard design of the De Redin towers, having a square plan with two floors and a turret on the roof. It has Saint George's Tower in its line of sight to the west, and the capital Valletta to its east. In 1715, a semi-circular artillery battery was built around the seaward side of the tower. Part of the battery had a parapet with four embrasures, with the rest of the parapet being en barbette. A free standing wall and a redan pierced with musketry loopholes enclosed the tower's land front, which was also protected by a shallow rock hewn ditch. In 1798, during the Maltese uprising against the French, insurgents led by Vincenzo Borg captured Saint Julian's Tower and Battery. Later on during the blockade, the battery's guns were transferred to other insurgent fortifications such as the Corradino Batteries, in order to bombard the French in Valletta. The tower gave its name to Tower Road, today one of Malta's most popular seaside promenades. In 1951, the Government of Malta affixed a marble plaque on the tower with the coat-of-arms of the GrandMaster who built it.https://www.um.edu.mt/library/oar/bitstream/123456789/48420/1/Lehen%20is- Sewwa_1975_04_19_Bonnici_Arturo_It-Torrijiet%20taghna.pdf Present day Plaque at St. Julian's Tower Today, the tower is intact and in good condition. The battery is missing its land front and redan, which have been replaced by a promenade. In addition, the parapet with embrasures has been demolished and replaced by a low boundary wall. The tower and battery are now used as a restaurant, known as It-Torri Restaurant.

Biography Li was born into the prominent banking, political and judicial Li family in Hong Kong in 1929. He was the youngest son of Li Koon-chun. His brother Simon Li Fook-sean was a senior judge and acting Chief Justice of the Supreme Court of Hong Kong. His nephews include former Legislative Councillor David Li Kwok-po, the Bank of East Asia chairman and Arthur Li Kwok-cheung, deputy chairman at the bank, former Secretary for Education and former Dean of the Faculty of Medicine at the Chinese University of Hong Kong, latterly, Chairman of the Council of the University of Hong Kong. Li was enrolled to the University of Hong Kong in 1946 and soon was sent to the Wittenberg University in the United States. He graduated from the University of Pennsylvania with a Master of Business Administration degree and became a chartered accountant in 1951. He founded the with his brother Li Fook-hing in 1969 to break the Hong Kong Stock Exchange's monopoly in the buying and selling of stocks. He was hence called the \\"Godfather of the Stock Market.\\" In 1986, Li helped merge the Far East Stock Exchange with three other exchanges into the Stock Exchange of Hong Kong, precursor of today's Hong Kong Exchanges and Clearing, and became its first chairman. During the Black Monday market crash, he closed the stock market for four days. The Hang Seng Index fell by 33% after the market reopened which drew criticism against Li's decision. He was only elected Vice- Chairman of the Stock Exchange in the end of the year. Li was later arrested by the Independent Commission Against Corruption (ICAC) in December 1987 and in 1991 convicted of taking bribes in return for approving listings during his office as the Chairman of the Stock Exchange of Hong Kong in 1987. He was sent to Stanley Prison, and served 30 months of a four-year sentence. He was reported to be worth HK$10 billion before he was jailed, and even during his prison term his vast stock portfolio was said to be earning almost HK$5 million per day, while Li toiled for HK$9 in the prison library. After his release in 1993, he said he would devote himself into a life of \\"golf, films and travel.\\" He spent most of his time in Thailand after prison until he found out he had cancer in 2012 and moved back to Hong Kong.

It is part of the Southern Black Forest Nature Park.  Geology and earth history  The Feldsee is a tarn, around 97,500 m2 in area and up to 32 metres deep. It was formed by glaciers of the last Ice Age.Der Feldberg im Schwarzwald, Karl M√ºller L. Bielefeld, 1948 The largest tarn in the Black Forest, it is hemmed in on three sides by steep mountainsides up to 300 metres high. It is almost circular and has a diameter of between 350 and 370 metres. This area of highland at a height of , which is open to the northeast, enabled it to amass and retain the huge quantities of snow that were the cause of this armchair-shaped terrain with its steep back face, level floor and embankment of moraine at the front. The lake formed after the melting of the ice sheet behind the lines of heaped-up glacial debris.Dr. Wolfgang Fleck, Landesamt f√ºr Geologie, Rohstoffe und Bergbau The Seebach stream, which rises between the Feldberg and Seebuck in the Gr√ºble, flows through the Feldsee, tumbling over the Feldsee Waterfall on the wall of the cirque, eventually becoming the Gutach at the far side of the Titisee. For several hundred thousand years this was the upper course of the ancient Danube (Urdonau), which flowed into the present-day Danube near Immendingen and, for the last several ten thousand years has formed a headstream of the Wutach, which flows into the Rhine. Below the Feldsee, between the heaps of moraine, used to be another, smaller lake that, through the formation of peat has silted up to become the present-day, botanically valuable bog of Feldseemoor.  Nature conservation  Currently there is a general ban on bathing in the Feldsee. This is in order to protect a rare underwater fern, the spiny quillwort (Isoetes echinospora), that thrives in water 1‚Äì2 metres deep and only occurs in Germany in the Feldsee and Lake Titisee.Information board by the Feldsee.

It watches over the entrance to the bay of Mƒ°arr ix-Xini, limits of Gƒßajnsielem, which lies on Gozo's south-west coast. It was completed in 1661, and its design is similar to the De Redin towers that were commissioned by Grand Master Martin de Redin. Recently, Wirt Gƒßawdex, a heritage NGO, restored the tower. It is now open to the public. It is one of four surviving coastal watchtowers on Gozo, with the others being Xlendi Tower, Dwejra Tower, and Isopu Tower. History Mƒ°arr ix-Xini Tower was completed by June 1661, to a plan by Mederico Blondel. It cost an estimated 857 scudi, which were financed by the Universit√† of Gozo. The design is similar to the De Redin towers on mainland Malta, having a square plan with two floors. However, the design differed since its entrance was approached by a flight of steps and a drawbridge, unlike the other towers which had a retractable ladder. The tower has Santa Cecilia Tower (built 1613) and Saint Mary's Tower (built 1618) in its line of sight. It was originally manned by a castellan and a bombardier, but was no longer permanently manned by 1785 since the Ottoman threat had receded. It was rearmed with two 6-pounder iron guns in 1792. Present day View of Mƒ°arr ix-Xini with the tower visible to the left The tower was restored in 2000 by the Ministry for Gozo and Wirt Gƒßawdex.

He is considered the greatest Sakya scholar of the 14th century and served as ruler for a short term in 1344-1347. S√∂nam Gyaltsen is particularly notable for his scholarly works Clear Mirror on Royal Genealogy, his commentary on the BodhisattvacaryƒÅvatƒÅra, his work on lamdre practice, as well as his work with D√∂lpopa Sh√©rap Gyeltsen on the zhentong theory of the two truths doctrine. Political career S√∂nam Gyaltsen, usually just known by his title, \\"Lama Dampa\\", was one of the thirteen sons of the abbot-ruler (dansa chenpo) Zangpo Pal who governed the see from 1306 to 1323 and therefore had a key position in the politics of Tibet under the overlordship of the Mongol Khagan. His mother was Machig Shonnu Bum.Shoju Inaba, 'The lineage of the Sa skya pa: A chapter of the Red Annals', Memoirs of the Research Department of the Toyo Bunko 22 1963, p. 110. His original name was Nyima Dewa'i Lotro; he received the name S√∂nam Gyaltsen when he was ordained as a novitiate monk in 1328. In 1331, at 19 years of age, he became a fully-ordained monk.Per Sorensen, Tibetan Buddhist historiography: The mirror illuminating the royal genealogies. Wiesbaden 1994, p. 30. By this time, the power of the Sakya Monastery was in decline. Around the time of Zangpo Pal's demise in 1323, his numerous sons were divided into four branches residing in different palaces. Lama Dampa belonged to the Rinchengang branch which took power as upper rulers of Sakya after a clash in 1341. He succeeded his elder brother Jamyang Donyo Gyaltsen on his demise in 1344.Luciano Petech, Central Tibet and the Mongols: The Y√ºan-Sa-skya period of Tibetan history. Rome 1990, p. 100-1. Temporal administration of Tibet was handled by the dpon-chen Gyalwa Zangpo (1344-1347). Civil war in Central Tibet However, his tenure saw the eruption of civil war in Central Tibet. This was a period when the Yuan Dynasty was in rapid decline and had few resources to monitor Tibetan affairs efficiently. One of the 13 myriarchies (trikor) of Central Tibet, Phagmodru, was led by the able and ambitious Changchub Gyaltsen who clashed with the rival Yazang myriarchy. The Sakya administration was unable to cope with the trouble efficiently. In 1346 open warfare flared up as Phagmodru was attacked by troops of Nyal and E, directed by Yazang. The Phagmodrupa were victorious, but the ponchen Gyalwa Zangpo and the Sakya cleric Kunpangpa conspired to kill the troublemaker and seize Phagmodru. Changchub Gyaltsen was treacherously arrested but refused to yield his prerogatives in spite of severe torture. A visit by Lama Dampa somewhat mitigated his lot as a prisoner. In early 1347 Gyalwa Zangpo was unexpectedly replaced by a new administrator, Wangtson, on the orders of the imperial court. The dismayed Gyalwa Zangpo now made a deal with his prisoner and released Changchub Gyaltsen.Luciano Petech 1990, pp. 103-5. In the meanwhile Lama Dampa stepped down from his position after having kept the position of abbot-ruler for three years. We do not know the exact reasons for this. He was succeeded by a nephew, Lotro Gyaltsen. During the Sakya-Phagmodru fighting of the 1340s and 1350s he had an important role as negotiator. In 1373 the Phagmodrupa ruler Jamyang Shakya Gyaltsen asked him to head a politico-religious meeting in N√™dong, confirming his status as a highly respected lama.Olaf Czaja, Medieval rule in Tibet. Wien 2013, p. 198. Religious and literary career While Lama Dampa's involvement with Tibetan politics was of little consequence, his cultural efforts are the more impressive.Giuseppe Tucci, Tibetan painted scrolls. Rome 1949, Vol. II, p. 627. He had been the religious teacher of Changchub Gyaltsen who eventually united Central Tibet under a new independent regime, the Phagmodrupa dynasty. Although the two men found themselves in opposing camps, they shared an interest in reviving the ideals of the old Tibetan Empire (c. 600-842). Some years after his abdication, Lama Dampa spent time and effort restoring Samye, the monastery associated with the old kings, which had been reduced to ruins during the fighting that preceded the Phagmodrupa victory.Kurtis Schaeffer et al. (eds), Sources of Tibetan tradition. New York 2013, p. 304. He subsequently authored a pseudo-historical work, Clear Mirror on Royal Genealogy (1368), where the historical details about the ancient kings were overlaid with Buddhist embellishments. The style of the narrative tended to retrospectively tone down the Chinese influences on Tibet which had accompanied the period of Mongol overlordship. The clear mirror made a great impact on the Tibetan view of their ancient history and thus supported Tai Situ Changchub Gyaltsen's project of national renewal.Kurtis Schaeffer et al. (eds) 2013, p. 305. Lama Dampa also wrote extensive commentaries on the PramƒÅ·πáavƒÅrttika, Abhisamayalankara, BodhisattvacaryƒÅvatƒÅra, and Nagarjuna's treatises. Towards the end of his life, in 1373, he was reportedly the teacher of the future Buddhist reformer Je Tsongkhapa.Per Sorensen 1994, p. 31. Lama Dampa died as a highly respected scholar in 1375.

Reception Critical response Review aggregators Rotten Tomatoes gives the film an 83% approval rating, with an average score of 6.4/10, based on reviews from 72 critics. The consensus states: \\"Results moves stubbornly at its own deliberate pace, but the well- chosen cast ‚Äî and writer-director Andrew Bujalski's insightful observations ‚Äî offer rich rewards for patient viewers.\\" Metacritic gives the film a score of 73 out of 100 based on reviews from 29 critics, indicating \\"generally favorable reviews\\". Kyle Smith of the New York Post criticized the casting: \\"Cobie Smulders, comes across as a walking iceberg only with less of a sense of humor\\" whilst Pearce's \\"bland character is even duller than she is\\". Smith said Corrigan \\"is pretty much the last guy on Earth you‚Äôd want to cast in a romcom (well, maybe second to last: Kevin Smith). And yet he‚Äôs the best thing about the movie\\" However, Richard Lawson of Vanity Fair believed that \\"Pearce, Smulders, and Corrigan give fluid, easygoing performances, never condescending to their characters no matter how pitiful they might be. Smulders is especially engaging‚Äîshe makes Kat prickly and short-tempered but never entirely unlikable\\". Scott Foundas of Variety said, \\"Bujalski wrote Results with specific actors in mind, and the roles fit them as snugly as spandex leotards\\". Sarah Salovaara of the Filmmaker Magazine said that ‚ÄúBeyond modesty, Bujalski and his longtime d.p. Matthias Grunsky demonstrate a great handle on the comic potential of framing.‚Äù Alexander Lowe gave Results 3 out of 5 stars and said, \\"[W]hile not a perfect film by any means, the plot is light and enjoyable, the performances are tight and the conclusion is satisfying.

He was treated with human interferon and convalescent serum. The course of his disease was mild and he fully recovered. Medically evacuated cases The high-level isolation unit at the Royal Free Hospital, in the Hampstead area of London, received its first case on 24 August 2014. William Pooley, a British nurse who contracted the disease while working in Sierra Leone as part of the relief effort for the Ebola virus epidemic in West Africa, was medically evacuated by the Royal Air Force on a specially-equipped C-17 aircraft. He was released from hospital on 3 September 2014. Pooley delivered the UK's Channel 4 television program Alternative Christmas message in 2014. He was reported to be planning to return to Sierra Leone on 19 October 2014. He also donated blood to support developing a cure for the disease. On 11 March 2015, a UK military worker tested positive for Ebola and was flown home for treatment at Royal Free Hospital in London. On 17 March, it was reported that another UK worker had been sent back to the United Kingdom from Sierra Leone due to fear of having contracted the virus. Corporal Anna Cross, the UK military worker tested positive for Ebola, was the first person in the world to be treated with the experimental Ebola drug MIL 77 and was released from hospital after making a full recovery. Cross contracted the disease in Sierra Leone while volunteering as a nurse. The doctors treating her at London's Royal Free Hospital confirmed it is too soon to speculate if the drug helped in her recovery. Pauline Cafferkey  2014 initial illness  On 29 December 2014, Pauline Cafferkey, a Scottish aid worker who had just returned to Glasgow from Sierra Leone via Casablanca Airport and London Heathrow Airport, was diagnosed with Ebola virus disease at Glasgow's Gartnavel General Hospital. She had been working at an Ebola treatment centre in Kerry Town in Sierra Leone, and it is thought she contracted the virus as a result of wearing a visor instead of goggles. After initial treatment in Glasgow, she was transferred to the specialist high-level isolation unit at the Royal Free Hospital in London for longer-term treatment. Contact tracing was carried out on the other passengers who had traveled on the flight from London to Glasgow with her. In January 2015, she experienced a period of critical illness, and underwent intensive medical treatment. She was eventually declared to be free of infection, and released from hospital. Relapses In October 2015, Cafferkey was diagnosed with late complications caused by the Ebola virus hitherto considered unusual, and readmitted to the Royal Free Hospital. The virus had remained in her cerebrospinal fluid and was feared to be in her central nervous system.The Guardian newspaper:How Pauline Cafferkey's Ebola relapse tears up everything doctors thought they knew, 16 October 2015 Her doctors stated that she had been critically ill due to neurological complications from meningitis, and that she had been treated using a highly experimental anti-viral agent. On 12 November the Royal Free Hospital said that Cafferkey had made a full recovery and was no longer infectious. In February 2016, Cafferkey was again readmitted to the Royal Free Hospital due to further complication from her previous infection. Later that month she was declared not to be infectious and discharged. In October 2016, she was again admitted to hospital, and was being monitored by the infectious diseases unit at Glasgow's Queen Elizabeth University Hospital. Tests for the Ebola virus were negative.  Subsequent investigations  In 2014, due to the fact that Cafferkey had passed through border controls and travelled on a domestic flight from Heathrow to Glasgow, criticism was levelled at screening protocols at UK points of entry, which mainly consisted of taking a person's temperature and asking a series of questions. In 2016, proceedings were initiated against Cafferkey by the Nursing and Midwifery Council alleging that she had allowed an incorrect temperature to be recorded during the screening process upon returning to the UK from Sierra Leone in 2014. Following a hearing in September 2016, the charges against her were dismissed after the disciplinary panel was told that she had been impaired by illness at the time. Needlestick incidents Healthcare workers who sustained needlestick injuries in January 2015 while caring for Ebola patients were put under medical observation, but not found to have contracted the Ebola virus.

Service under Liu Zhang Cheng Ji was from Langzhong County (Èñ¨‰∏≠Á∏£), Baxi Commandery (Â∑¥Ë•øÈÉ°), which is in present-day Langzhong, Sichuan. He served as the Chief of Hanchang County (Êº¢ÊòåÁ∏£; in present-day Bazhong, Sichuan) under the warlord Liu Zhang, who controlled Yi Province (covering present-day Sichuan and Chongqing) during the late Eastern Han dynasty. An ethnic minority group, the Cong (Ë≥®), lived in Hanchang County.

Cheng Ji's immediate superior was Pang Xi, the Administrator of Baxi Commandery, because Hanchang County was under Baxi Commandery's jurisdiction, and Baxi Commandery was administered by Yi Province. As chaos broke out throughout China towards the end of the Eastern Han dynasty, Pang Xi wanted to improve security within Baxi Commandery, so he recruited more men to serve as soldiers. Around the time, Liu Zhang heard rumours that Pang Xi was planning to rebel against him and became more suspicious of Pang Xi. When Pang Xi heard about it, he became fearful and started making preparations to increase the strength of his military forces. He also sent Cheng Yu (Á®ãÈÉÅ), Cheng Ji's son, who was serving in the commandery office, to persuade Cheng Ji to support him in rebelling against Liu Zhang. Cheng Ji wrote to Pang Xi: \\"Your original intention in recruiting more soldiers was not to start a rebellion. There might have been some misunderstanding, but what is more important is you are performing your duties. If you are fearful and start thinking of rebelling, I will not listen to you.\\" He also wrote to Cheng Yu: \\"I received grace from the provincial government, so I am obliged to do my best to serve the Governor. You are serving in the commandery office, so you should do your best to serve the Administrator. You should not be thinking of rebelling.\\" Pang Xi sent a message to Cheng Ji: \\"Your son is serving in the commandery office. Your family will be in trouble if you do not obey the Administrator!\\" Cheng Ji replied: \\"Yue Yang (Ê®ÇÁæä) ate his son's flesh not because he did not love his son, but because he was doing so for the sake of upholding righteousness. If you were to make me do the same thing, I will do it.\\" Pang Xi realised that Cheng Ji would never support him, so he abandoned the idea of rebelling against Liu Zhang; instead, he apologised to Liu Zhang and was pardoned. When Liu Zhang heard about Cheng Ji's loyalty towards him, he promoted Cheng Ji to serve as the Administrator of Jiangyang Commandery (Ê±üÈôΩÈÉ°; around present-day Luzhou, Sichuan).(Â∑¥Ë•øÂ§™ÂÆàÈæêÁæ≤‰ª•Â§©‰∏ãÊìæ‰∫ÇÔºåÈÉ°ÂÆúÊúâÊ≠¶Ë°ûÔºåÈ†óÊãõÂêàÈÉ®Êõ≤„ÄÇÊúâËÆíÊñºÁíãÔºåË™™Áæ≤Ê¨≤ÂèõËÄÖÔºåÁíãÈô∞Áñë‰πã„ÄÇÁæ≤ËÅûÔºåÁîöÊáºÔºåÂ∞áË¨ÄËá™ÂÆàÔºåÈÅ£ÁïøÂ≠êÈÉÅÂÆ£Êó®ÔºåÁ¥¢ÂÖµËá™Âä©„ÄÇÁïøÂ†±Êõ∞Ôºö„ÄåÈÉ°ÂêàÈÉ®Êõ≤ÔºåÊú¨‰∏çÁÇ∫ÂèõÔºåÈõñÊúâ‰∫§ÊêÜÔºåË¶ÅÂú®Áõ°Ë™†ÔºõËã•ÂøÖ‰ª•ÊáºÔºåÈÅÇÊá∑Áï∞ÂøóÔºåÈùûÁïø‰πãÊâÄËÅû„ÄÇ„ÄçÂπ∂ÊïïÈÉÅÊõ∞Ôºö„ÄåÊàëÂèóÂ∑ûÊÅ©ÔºåÁï∂ÁÇ∫Â∑ûÁâßÁõ°ÁØÄ„ÄÇÊ±ùÁÇ∫ÈÉ°ÂêèÔºåÁï∂ÁÇ∫Â§™ÂÆàÂäπÂäõÔºå‰∏çÂæó‰ª•ÂêæÊïÖÊúâÁï∞Âøó‰πü„ÄÇ„ÄçÁæ≤‰Ωø‰∫∫ÂëäÁïøÊõ∞Ôºö„ÄåÁàæÂ≠êÂú®ÈÉ°Ôºå‰∏çÂæûÂ§™ÂÆàÔºåÂÆ∂Â∞áÂèäÁ¶çÔºÅ„ÄçÁïøÊõ∞Ôºö„ÄåÊòîÊ®ÇÁæäÁÇ∫Â∞áÔºåÈ£≤Â≠ê‰πãÁæπÔºåÈùûÁà∂Â≠êÁÑ°ÊÅ©ÔºåÂ§ßÁæ©ÁÑ∂‰πü„ÄÇ‰ªäÈõñÂæ©ÁæπÂ≠êÔºåÂêæÂøÖÈ£≤‰πã„ÄÇ„ÄçÁæ≤Áü•ÁïøÂøÖ‰∏çÁÇ∫Â∑±ÔºåÂéöÈô≥Ë¨ùÊñºÁíã‰ª•Ëá¥ÁÑ°Âíé„ÄÇÁíãËÅû‰πãÔºåÈÅ∑ÁïøÊ±üÈôΩÂ§™ÂÆà„ÄÇ) Pei Songzhi's annotation in Sanguozhi vol. 45.

After about six months of stalemate since the beginning of 222, Sun Quan's forces, led by Lu Xun, suddenly launched a counterattack, burnt down several Shu camps in a fire attack, and forced the remaining Shu forces to retreat. Cheng Ji remained behind to cover the retreat. As the enemy approached, someone urged him to abandon his boat and escape, but he replied: \\"I have never fled from battle throughout my career.

After being purchased at the age of five or six by Captain Andrew Douglas of Mains, he served as a slave under his daughter, Jean, wife of Sir John Kennedy, 2nd Baronet of Culzean in Ayrshire. He was granted a manumission (freedom from slavery) in 1725, but continued to work for the Kennedy family and was given land on the estate. He married in 1728 and had at least eight children. At least one living descendant is known from the West of Scotland and has published the story of his ancestor in a Scottish national newspaper. African slaves in Scotland The commercial success of the slave-worked plantations of the late seventeenth century led to a fashion for Scottish families of the gentry class to keep black African servants. Merchants importing goods from the Caribbean and Americas made regular contact with slave ships and some were \\"redeemed\\" (purchased) for domestic service. Men and boys were more likely than women and girls to be taken into service, often in highly visible roles such as page boys or footmen. They might be given pet names, or names that sarcastically poked fun at their powerlessness, such as \\"Caesar\\". Their lives were often much easier than that of their counterparts in the New World plantations, and they were often given an education so that they could read and write. They were also expected to become Christians and to receive baptism. By the end of the eighteenth century, they were seen as equal human beings under the law. Scipio's journey to Ayrshire In about the year 1700, when Scipio was aged five or six, he was captured in West Africa and taken onto a slave ship in the area known as the Gulf of Guinea. Given the normal route that these ships took, it is likely that he was transported to an island in the Caribbean before being redeemed by Andrew Douglas of Mains (which is near Milngavie in Dunbartonshire) and transported to Scotland in 1702. Douglas would probably have chosen the name Scipio, whose namesake Scipio Africanus served the Roman Empire, defeating the numerically superior forces of Hannibal in the Punic Wars. Douglas had a daughter, Jean, who married John Kennedy in 1705, and Scipio moved to Culzean with them. During this time Scipio learned to read, write and also some textile manufacture. In March 1711, on the death of his father John Kennedy succeeded as the 2nd baronet. Life after freedom Scipio's manumission document is held at the National Archives of Scotland. It is dated 1725 and grants Scipio the freedom to take employment elsewhere. The document records the \\"clothing, maintenance and education with more than ordinary kindness\\" already given to Scipio by the Kennedy family. It also details the terms of his further employment by them in a nineteen-year breakable contract, to be rewarded with \\"the sum of twelve pounds Scots money yearly besides my share of the drink money\\". The document is signed by John Kennedy and Scipio. In 1728, Scipio was recorded as having fathered a daughter, Elizabeth, by fornication with Margaret Gray. This would have been considered a scandalous event within the parish. Scipio married Margaret later that year and the couple had sevenKirkoswald Parish Register, Minutes of Kirkoswald Sessions further children. Scipio's house An estate map was drawn up in the 1750s by John Foulis of Redburn, a copy of which is kept in Culzean Castle. The map shows a building on a piece of land about 800 metres from the castle, near to the current walled garden, and it is overwritten with the word \\"Sipios\\". The house cost ¬£90 to build when new, and was probably an impressive building made of stone. The area of the grounds where the house once stood was excavated in 2007; some artifacts were found during the excavation which may have been Scipio's personal property. Lady Kennedy's will Jean Kennedy's will dated 1751, records the gift from her estate \\"to Scipio Kennedy my old servant, the sum of ten pounds sterling\\". As this figure is of a similar order to the amount given to each of her grandchildren (a third each of ¬£40), this seems to show that Scipio was considered to be part of the Kennedy family. Memorial stone In Kirkoswald Old Church graveyard, there is a stone commemorating the life of Scipio, erected by one of his sons. The stone does not explicitly say that Scipio is buried in that place, but that his son is \\"also\\" buried there. The stone reads: :This stone is erected by Douglas Kennedy in Memory of his father Scipio Kennedy who died June 24, 1774 Aged 80 years. :Also here lieth the body of said Douglas Kennedy who died July 21, 1781 aged 49 years. The text at the bottom reads \\"1 length and 1 breadth\\" and is not part of the inscription, but is to define the burial plot. Descendants Some authors have raised the question of Scipio's descendants. In May 2012, The Scotsman published an article written by Jonathan Sharp, which details his personal research into his family history. He traced his lineage back through to one of Scipio's daughters, Elizabeth Kennedy in Kirkoswald, and thence to Scipio himself.

Ulbo, the sociologist, was the grandson of astronomer Willem de Sitter (1872-1934). He studied sociology at the University of Amsterdam, and obtained his PhD in 1970 at the University of Leiden with the thesis, entitled \\"Leiderschapsvorming en leiderschapsgedrag in een organisatie\\" (Leadership formation and leadership behavior in an organization). De Sitter had started working as engineer in the merchant navy for four years before he started his studies in Amsterdam. After graduation in Amsterdam he worked as sociologist at the head office of the Koninklijke PTT Nederland, nowadays KPN. Sequentially he was research assistant at the Sociografische Werkgemeenschap (Socio Graphic Work Association) of the University of Amsterdam. In 1971 he was appointed professor at Eindhoven University of Technology. From 1986 to 1988 he was also director of the Koers consulting group in 's-Hertogenbosch. In 1990 he was appointed Professor of Sociotechnical System at the University of Nijmegen, where he retired March 31, 1995.Frans van Eijnatten (1995) (red.) Als het maar stroomt! : Ulbo de Sitter, laveren tussen simpel en complex. Bundel aangeboden aan Prof.dr. L.U. de Sitter ter gelegenheid van zijn afscheid als hoogleraar in de moderne sociotechniek aan de Katholieke Universiteit Nijmegen op 31 maart 1995. Assen : Van Gorcum, 1995.  Work  De Sitter is best known for introducing the sociotechnical system approach in the Netherlands. This approach involves redesign of organization and change management theory, which was initially developed at the British Tavistock Institute in the late 1950s. De Sitter combined in his work the systems theory fundamentals of the Delft Systems Approach, developed by Jan in 't Veld and Pierre Malotaux. With scientists as Bj√∂rn Gustavsen, Fred Emery, Eric Trist, De Sitter is considered among the foremost social systems scientists in their field.  Modern socio-technology (MST)  Benders et al. (2010) recalled the development of socio-technical systems design since its initiation at the British coal mines in the late 1940s, and the development of Modern Socio-technology (MST) by De Sitter and others: :In 1951, Trist and Bamforth published a founding article on STSD while the London-based Tavistock Institute played a key role in further developing socio-technical design into practical applications. During the 1950s and 1960s these notions were picked up in many countries, with Norwegian and Swedish researchers playing key roles. In the Netherlands a strand of socio-technical scholars and practitioners developed a widely accepted research based organizational design methodology (De Sitter, Den Hertog, & Dankbaar, 1997; De Sitter, 1998). This Dutch variant, called Modern Socio- technology (MST), builds on the classic STSD. In the 1970s Ulbo de Sitter played a key role in developing this socio-technical systems theory (with some roots in German sociology). During the 1980s this design theory was enriched with a proper design methodology based on action research...Benders, J. G. J.

It is found in the Amazon basin in Bolivia, Brazil, Colombia, Peru and Venezuela, where it inhabits edges of rivers and lakes, and streams. It is generally a low-density species that lives in slow-moving or essentially stagnant waters in areas with plant debris. Amazon leaffish are sometimes kept in aquariums, but they require acidic water, low light and live prey. Appearance The Amazon leaffish reaches a maximum standard length of , and a total length of . As suggested by its common name, it closely resembles a dead leaf. The flattened body and filament at the tip of the lower jaw (resembling a stalk) further enhances its similarity to a leaf. It is gray-brown, but can change its color to some extent. There is no lateral line and its large mouth can be protracted to as much as 60% of the head length. Behavior The Amazon leaffish is highly predatory, feeding on small invertebrates (aquatic insects like mayfly nymphs and crustaceans like shrimp) and fish (especially Characids and Lebiasinids). Small Amazon leaffish mostly feed on invertebrates, while larger individuals mainly feed on fish. The prey fish are swallowed whole and they are often quite large compared to the size of the leaffish. The prey fish length is typically about of the length of the leaffish, but can be up to around the length. The camouflage allows the Amazon leaffish to both escape the attention of larger predators and ambush smaller prey. It swims very slowly in a head-down position, resembling a dead leaf floating in the current, to approach its prey. When near, it protracts its mouth to form a tube. The prey is rapidly sucked in, usually head-first. Prey in its stomach is often folded, allowing the leaffish to fit relatively large items. Before breeding, the pair swims next to each other. The female lays up to 300 eggs on the underside of a rock or plant leaf, which are then fertilized by the male. The male takes care of the eggs, which hatch after 3‚Äì4 days. They are predators from the start of their lives, first feeding on tiny animals like brine shrimp and water fleas.

The Phillips catalyst, or the Phillips supported chromium catalyst, is the catalyst used to produce approximately half of the world's polyethylene. A heterogeneous catalyst, it consists of a chromium oxide supported on silica gel.Max P. McDaniel \\"A Review of the Phillips Supported Chromium Catalyst and Its Commercial Use for Ethylene Polymerization\\" Advances in Catalysis, 2010, Volume 53, p. 123. Polyethylene, the most abundant synthetic polymer, is produced industrially by the polymerization of ethylene: :n C2H4 ‚Üí (C2H4)n Although exergonic (i.e., thermodynamically favorable), the reaction requires catalysts. Three main catalysts are employed commercially: the Phillips catalyst, Ziegler‚ÄìNatta catalysts (based on titanium trichloride), and, for specialty polymers, metallocene-based catalysts. Preparation and mechanism of action The Phillips catalyst is prepared by impregnating high surface area silica gel with chromium trioxide or related chromium compounds. The solid precatalyst is then calcined in air to give the active catalyst. Only a fraction of the chromium is catalytically active, a fact that interferes with elucidation of the catalytic mechanism. The active catalyst is often depicted as a chromate ester bound to the silica surface. The mechanism for the polymerization process is the subject of much research, the central question being the structure of the active species, which is assumed to be an organochromium compound.Klaus H.

Built by William R. H. Martin in a French Renaissance style. The hotel belongs to the Historic Hotels of America. It was the setting for Jonathan Kozol's study, Rachel and Her Children: Homeless Families in America (1988). Site The hotel was built on lots at West 33rd and 32nd Streets, and also the northeast corner of Broadway and 32nd Street. The 12-story 165-room Hotel Alcazar at one time adjoined the Hotel Martinique on the north side of 34th Street, east of Broadway. To the east is the Empire State Building and Fifth Avenue shops, while to the west is New York Penn Station. History The hotel was built in 1897-98 by William R. H. Martin, who headed the Rogers Peet business. The French Renaissance style was by a design of Henry Janeway Hardenbergh. Martin had purchased the plot in 1892, and in 1893 and 1895, he bought additional land to build the hotel that he desired. The uptown store of Rogers Peet was in the same building. After the Martinique opened, Martin began running a series of short ads to introduce his house, the ads appearing several times a week in the Sun and Times. The Hotel Martinique was designed originally as an apartment house. Later, it was found that the needs of the location would be better suited for a hotel. This was done and still there was not room enough for the growing demand of the neighborhood. A first small expansion occurred 1901-03, followed by a larger one in 1907-11, which, with the exception of the small piece of property on the corner of 33rd Street and Broadway, gave the hotel a frontage of two streets and the Avenue with a concourse running through the hotel the entire length of Broadway between the two blocks. The 1910 addition included a continuation of the original hotel, situated on 33rd Street, which ran around a small plot of ground on which were low buildings and thence across to Broadway halfway down to 32nd Street. The new addition began where the old one left off and continued to 32nd Street, running for some distance down Thirty-second Street with the main entrance on that side. Room prices in 1910 ranged from US$3.50-$6.00 and up per day. The Omar Khayyam room served as the venue for the Gus Edwards Revue's \\"1918 Version of a Night with Omar Khayyam\\", a twice- nightly performance. During World War II, Richard Quirin and Heinrich Harm Heinck, notorious for their involvement in Operation Pastorius, were registered guests at the Hotel Martinique, contrary to George John Dasch's recommendation. From 1973 until the end of 1988, the Martinique was a welfare hotel. It housed over 1,400 children in December 1985 within 389 families; eighteen months later, there were 438 families. In 1986, the average length of stay at the Martinque by a resident was sixteen months. The Koch administration sought to empty the hotel by the end of 1988. Kozol's 1980's study of the homeless, Rachel and Her Children, was set at the Martinique. Developer Harold Thurman purchased the building in 1989, but it sat vacant for a number of years before he renovated it completely. The hotel was designated a New York City landmark on May 5, 1998.http://famoushotels.org/article/1161 The hotel reopened in October 1998 under a Holiday Inn franchise as the Holiday Inn Martinique on Broadway. The hotel switched to the Radisson chain in 2005, becoming the New York Radisson Martinique Hotel, then later the Radisson Martinique on Broadway. The hotel belongs to the Historic Hotels of America. The hotel joined Hilton's Curio Collection division on February 1, 2019 and was renamed the Martinique New York on Broadway, Curio Collection by Hilton. Golf association The hotel's history has a long and important association with the history of golf in the United States. The Professional Golfers' Association of America (PGA) was established at the hotel on April 10, 1916, where 35 charter members and 78 golf professionals formed to create what was then the world's largest working sports organization. The Radisson Martinique is regularly the venue for announcing the American Ryder Cup team, and in 2008, Paul Azinger announced at the hotel the four players who would compete. On August 31, 2011, the PGA Gallery at the Radisson Martinique was officially inaugurated to mark the PGA's 95th anniversary year. Architecture Construction work at the Hotel Martinique, circa 1910. Diagram of the Hotel Martinique, upper part, 32nd Street elevation Diagram of the lower part, 32nd Street elevation. A 1918 publication stated: \\"New York is noted for its beautiful buildings, and the Martinique is no exception\\". The hotel is 19 stories high, and \\"capitalized on the openness of Greeley Square\\" (now Herald Square). It was built from glazed brick, terracotta and limestone, and featured bespoke \\"rusticated stonework balconies and prominent cartouches on all three of its facades\\". It is crowned by a large mansard roof and has decorated dormers. The south facade serves as the building's front. A 1910 brochure states, \\"The Gentlemen‚Äôs Broadway Cafe is a veritable architectural gem. The walls and columns of Italian marble give to this room a richness which is completed by Pompeiian panels of unquestioned merit.\\" The Louis XVI dining room was described in the same brochure: ‚ÄúThe wainscotting and pillars are of Circassian walnut, enclosing panels of gold silk tapestry.\\" At the time of opening in 1910, the addition was of French Renaissance design, carried out in a general way in the interior though there was a slight leaning toward the Spanish in the exterior details. The addition and the older structure were connected with a large courtyard between the two buildings, forming an angle at this point. The ground floor contained a large lobby. To its right was the main dining room and to the left, the Broadway Cafe. Just underneath the Broadway Cafe, down a flight of marble stairs, was the Grill. The Broadway Cafe contained walls of light, artificial stone and its ceiling was treated in the Italian Renaissance style, ornamented in low relief. The corridor walls were of Greek Skyros marble in gray and yellow with a slight veining of purple. The coffered ceiling carried out this color scheme. The large dining room was modelled after the Galerie d'Apollon in the Louvre. The first floor contained a foyer in Louis XIV style, with carved, dark oak woodwork and walls completely covered in tapestries of the period. From this foyer opened out the Tea Room whose walls of artificial stone were covered with wooden grillage, painted green while the skylight over the entire room was concealed by rafters and grillage with entwined vines. Adjoining this was a Flemish-style Banquet Room in dark oak. Carved wooden doors were set with panelled mirrors in the foyer hall. Elevator doors were of bronze. The Hotel Martinique has 532 rooms. It is served by two restaurants; the Petit Poulet serves French bistro cuisine, while the Martinique Cafe caters in international and American cuisine.

It is in the commune of Mahina, approximately 8 km east of the capital Pape'ete. Early European voyages The bay was visited by European voyages of discovery in the second half of the 18th century for wood, water and supplies. As late as 1802, Governor King of New South Wales considered Tahiti \\"the only island that needs little or no precaution for the safety of those who visit it\\"\\"Governor King to the Duke of Portland, 1 March 1802\\", Historical Records of Australia, Series I, Volume 3, Page 432 Samuel Wallis The first European known to have visited Tahiti was Lieutenant Samuel Wallis, in ,Oliver, p 3Hawkesworth, Chapter 9 who landed on 17 June 1767 in Matavai Bay. The first contacts with the native Tahitians were difficult, since on the 24 and the 26 June 1767, canoes tried to take the ship and beach it. In retaliation, the English sailors opened fire on the canoes and on the crowds on the hills. In reaction to this powerful counter- attack, the inhabitants of the bay laid down offerings for the English, showing their wish for peace or to submit.Salvat et al, p.44-45 Following this episode, Samuel Wallis was able to establish cordial relations with the female chieftain Oberea (Purea) and remained on the island until 27 July 1767. Wallis named the bay Port Royal. Bougainville On 2 April 1768Bougainville, ch VIII Louis-Antoine de Bougainville, completing the first French circumnavigation in La Boudeuse and √âtoile, landed in Matavai Bay. He stayed about ten days on the island, which he called ‚ÄúNouvelle-Cyth√®re‚Äú, or \\"New Cythera\\", because of the warm welcome he had received and the sweetness of the Tahitian customs. James Cook Resolution and Adventure in Matavai Bay by William Hodges. Point Venus is visible at left. National Maritime Museum, Greenwich. A primary objective of James Cook's first voyage, in , was to observe the 1769 Transit of Venus from the South Pacific. Tahiti was chosen for the observations based on Wallis's recent discoveries. Endeavour's third lieutenant was John Gore, who had served as master's mate on Dolphin. Cook anchored in the bay on 13 April 1769. A sandy spit on the northeast end of Matavai Bay ‚Äì named Point Venus by Cook ‚Äì was chosen for the observatory. The location of the observatory would be known as \\"Fort Venus.\\" Cook departed on 13 July 1769. Cook also visited Matavai Bay on 26 August-1 September 1773 and 22 April-14 May 1774 during his second voyage, and 23 August-29 September 1777 during his third voyage. Lady Penrhyn Lady Penrhyn was a convict transport in the First Fleet.

Fidlon and Ryan p. 86 She departed Sydney Cove on 5 May 1788 and sailed north with the intention of purchasing furs in Kamchatka for resale in China. The poor condition of the ship and sickness among her crew compelled Lady Penrhyn to stop in Matavai Bay in July 1788, where the crew recovered and the ship was repaired. John Watts, who was acting as supercargo, had visited previously as a midshipman in on James Cook's third voyage. The voyage is documented in the published journals of WattsPhillip, Chapter XX and surgeon Arthur Bowes SmythSmyth Bligh's first breadfruit voyage In 1787, William Bligh took command of Bounty on a mission to convey breadfruit from the South Pacific to the Caribbean.

They established a nursery at Point Venus, collecting and preparing 1015 breadfruit plants to be transported. Bligh allowed the crew to live ashore and care for the potted breadfruit plants, and they became socialized to the customs and culture of the Tahitians. Bounty departed with her breadfruit cargo on 4 April 1789. Part of the crew mutinied on 28 April 1789. HMS Pandora , under Captain Edward Edwards, was sent from England to search for the Bounty and the mutineers. Pandora reached Tahiti on 23 March 1791 and recovered 14 crew members from Bounty. On 8 May 1791 Pandora left Tahiti and subsequently spent three months in the South-West Pacific in search of the Bounty and the remaining mutineers, without finding any traces of her or them.

Biography  Mirza Taleb was the son of Hatem Beg Ordubadi, and thus belonged to the Ordubadi family, an Iranian family which was descended from the medieval philosopher and polymath Nasir al-Din al-Tusi. Furthermore, Mirza Taleb was also the brother-in-law of the governor of Qandahar, Ali Mardan Khan. In 1610/1, Mirza Taleb was appointed as the grand vizier of Abbas I, thus succeeding his father. He was later replaced by Salman Khan Ustajlu in 1621. In 1632, Mirza Taleb was reappointed as grand vizier by Abbas I's grandson and successor Safi, succeeding the former grand vizier Khalifeh Sultan. A year later, Mirza Taleb was dishonored by Saru Taqi, who then secretly had him assassinated. The reason behind these actions was due to a personal hatred Saru Taqi had towards the family of Mirza Taleb Khan, whose father had denied to give Saru Taqi's father a post which he had asked for. Furthermore, Saru Taqi also took over the house of Mirza Taleb, which was in Isfahan, the capital of the Safavid Empire.

Shen's documentary, entitled \\"A Hundred Years of Constitutionalism\\", was posted online and downloaded for free, and hundreds of DVDs were provided for free to people who contribute money to the film's production. Shen was detained in April 2014 and jailed in Chaoyang District, Beijing, and was formally arrested on June 4. The Beijing Bureau of Press, Publication, Radio, Film and Television discovered 4,000 copies of Shen's documentary in his apartment, which officials said were illegal publications. In his indictment, prosecutors argued Shen had a \\"weak understanding of the rule of law\\" when he released the film, and that he \\"disrupted the market order in a particularly serious manner\\". After a Beijing district court hearing that began on December 12, 2014, Shen was sentenced to one year in prison for illegal business activities. His attorney has disputed the allegation, saying Shen did not make the film for profit, and claims he will appeal the decision. Shen's supporters suggest his arrest was a thinly veiled punishment for his film's criticism of the Communist Party of China's failure to uphold the country's constitution. Shen's arrest and conviction is one of a series of examples of CPC General Secretary Xi Jinping taking a hard line against protestors, dissenters and artists critical of the Communist party. Shen was counted by the Committee to Protect Journalists as one of 44 journalists arrested in China in 2014, the most from any country that year.

In 1793 Eli Longley built a log cabin near the mouth of Kedar Brook at Keoka Lake, and four years later built what is now called the Lake House, as a tavern to serve travelers. The town center grew on Langley's land over the following years, based on his layout. The historic district extends along Maine State Routes 35 and 37 southward from the town green, and northward beyond Kedar Brook to the junction of Rice and Waterford Streets, and also extends a short way along Plummer Hill Road and Valley Road. There are 27 historically significant properties in the district, most of which were built before 1850, and are residential. Notable among these is the 1805 Levi Browne House, which was the birthplace of humorist Charles Farrar Browne (1834‚Äì67), who wrote under the pen name Artemus Ward. One of the architecturally finer Federal period houses is that of Ambrose Knight, who was a local shop owner. The village's oldest municipal building is the 1843 Greek Revival town house. Between 1850 and 1900 a small number of buildings were added to the district, which are either Italianate of transitional Greek Revival-Italianate in style. Prominent amongst them is the Leander Stone House, built c. 1870 by a local builder for his family, and the 1879 Masonic Hall, also built by Stone. Most of the civic buildings in the district were built before 1930, and are Colonial Revival in style. Three of them were designed by the noted Portland architect John Calvin Stevens, including the First Congregational Church and adjacent Wilkins Community Hall, both dating to 1928. The Knight Library was first built in 1911-12, but was destroyed by fire, and rebuilt in 1938 to a plan by Stevens.

These austerity measures were a result of the Greek government-debt crisis and other economic factors. All of the legislation listed remains in force. 2010  February  The first austerity package was the first in a row of countermeasures to counter the Greek government-debt crisis. It was approved by the Hellenic Parliament in early 2010. The purpose was to reduce the budget deficit. These measures preceded the First Economic Adjustment Programme for Greece known as \\"memorandum\\". It emerged after a promise by the Greek prime minister in the World Economic Forum of Davos, Switzerland to take measures to reduce the country's deficit. The package was implemented on 9 February 2010 and was expected to save ‚Ç¨0.8 billion. It included a freeze in the salaries of all government employees, a 10% cut in bonuses, as well as cuts in overtime workers, public employees and work-related travel. March The second austerity package was approved by the Hellenic Parliament in March 2010. On 5 March 2010, amid new fears of bankruptcy, the Greek parliament passed the \\"Economy Protection Bill\\", which was expected to save another ‚Ç¨4.8 billion. The measures include: 30% cuts in Christmas, Easter and leave of absence bonuses, a further 12% cut in public bonuses, a 7% cut in the salaries of public and private employees, a rise of VAT from 4.5% to 5%, from 9% to 10% and from 19% to 21%, a rise of the petrol tax to 15%, a rise in the taxes on imported cars of up to 10%‚Äì30%, among others. On 23 April 2010, after realising the second austerity package failed to improve the country's economic position, the government requested that the EU/IMF bailout package be activated. Greece needed money before 19 May, or it would face a debt rollover of $11.3bn. The IMF had said it was \\"prepared to move expeditiously on this request\\". Shortly after the European Commission, the IMF and ECB set up a tripartite committee (the Troika) to prepare an appropriate programme of economic policies underlying a massive loan. The Troika was led by Servaas Deroose, from the European Commission, and included also Poul Thomsen (IMF) and Klaus Masuch (ECB) as junior partners. In return the government agreed to implement further measures. June The third austerity package came with the signing of the First Economic Adjustment Programme for Greece known as First Memorandum with the European Union, the International Monetary Fund (IMF) and the European Central Bank (ECB). It was announced in May 2010 and approved by the Hellenic Parliament in June 2010. On 1 May 2010, Prime Minister George Papandreou announced a new round of austerity measures, which were described as \\"unprecedented\\". The proposed changes, which aimed to save through 2012, represented the biggest government overhaul in a generation. The bill was met with a nationwide general strike and massive protests, leaving three dead, dozens injured and 107 arrested. Vote The bill was submitted to Parliament on 4 May and approved on 6 May. Out of 160 MPs consisting the PASOK government majority, 157 MPs supported the bill, while 3 MPs abstained. ND, SYRIZA and KKE voted against the bill; however, Dora Bakoyianni of ND voted for the bill in principle and was subsequently expelled from ND. LAOS voted for the bill. Further separate votes on 29 and 30 June were held to implement portions of the package. Specific measures The measures include: = Public Sector Reform = * The number of public- owned companies shall be reduced from 6,000 to 2,000. * Limit of ‚Ç¨500 per month to 13th and 14th month salaries of public employees; abolished for employees receiving over ‚Ç¨3,000 a month. * 8% cut on public sector allowances * 3% pay cut for DEKO (public sector utilities) employees. * Public sector limit of ‚Ç¨1,000 introduced to bi-annual bonus, abolished entirely for those earning over ‚Ç¨3,000 a month. * The number of municipalities shall shrink from 1,000 to 400. = Pension Reform = Public pension reforms included: * Limit of ‚Ç¨800 per month to 13th and 14th month pension instalments; abolished for pensioners receiving over ‚Ç¨2,500 a month. * Return of a special tax on high pensions. * Women's retirement age increased from 60 to 65 to match men's retirement age. * Mechanism introduced to scale general pension age to life expectancy changes. * Average retirement age for public sector workers increased from 61 to 65. = Tax Reform = * VAT rises to 23% (from 19%), 11% (from 9%) and 5.5% (from 4%). * Extraordinary taxes imposed on company profits. * Rise in the value of property (and thus higher taxes). * 10% rise in luxury taxes and sin taxes on alcohol, cigarettes and fuel. * 10% additional rise for all imported cars. = Labor Market Reforms = * Changes were planned to the laws governing lay-offs and overtime pay. *A financial stability fund has been created. Implementation On 2 May 2010, a loan agreement was reached between Greece, the other eurozone countries, and the International Monetary Fund. The deal consisted of an immediate in loans to be provided in 2010, with more funds available later. The first instalment covered of Greek bonds that became due for repayment. In total, was agreed on. The interest for the eurozone loans is 5%, considered to be high for a bailout loan. The European Monetary Union loans would be pari passu and not senior like those of the IMF. The seniority of the IMF loans has no legal basis but is respected nonetheless. The loans should cover Greece's funding needs for the next three years (estimated at ‚Ç¨30 billion for the rest of 2010 and ‚Ç¨40 billion each for 2011 and 2012).Global Economics Flash, Greek Sovereign Debt Restructuring Delayed but Not Avoided for Long, 5 May 2010, \\"The amount of fiscal tightening announced over the next three years is even larger than we expected: ‚Ç¨30 bn worth of spending cuts and tax increases, around 12.5% of the 2009 Greek GDP, and an even higher percentage of the average annual GDP over the next three years (2010‚Äì2012). With 5 percentage points of GDP tightening in 2010 and 4 percentage points of GDP tightening in 2011, the economy should contract quite sharply ‚Äì between 3 and 4 percent this year and probably another 1 or 2 percent contraction in 2011.\\" According to EU officials, France and Germany demanded that their military dealings with Greece be a condition of their participation in the financial rescue. , the deficit was down 40% from the previous year. 2011 June The fourth austerity package, commonly called 'The Medium-term Programme' or 'The June 2011 measures', was approved by the Hellenic Parliament in June 2011. In the midst of public discontent, massive protests and a 24-hour-strike throughout Greece, the parliament debated a new austerity bill, known in Greece as the \\"mesoprothesmo\\" (the mid-term [plan]). The government's intent to pass further austerity measures was met with discontent from within the government and parliament, but eventually passed with 155 votes in favour (a marginal 5-seat majority). Horst Reichenbach headed up the task force overseeing Greek implementation of austerity and structural adjustment. Measures The new measures included: * Raising ‚Ç¨50 billion from privatisations and sales of government property. * Tax Reform ** Increasing taxes for those with a yearly income of over ‚Ç¨8,000 ** An extra tax for those with a yearly income of over ‚Ç¨12,000 ** Increasing VAT in the housing industry ** An extra tax of 2% for combating unemployment * Pension Reform ** Lower pension payments ranging from 6% to 14% from the previous 4% to 10%. * Creation of a special agency responsible with exploiting government property, and others. On 11 August 2011 the government introduced more taxes, this time targeted at people owning immovable property. The new tax, which was paid through the owner's electricity bill, affected 7.5 million Public Power Corporation accounts and ranged from 3 to 20 euros per square meter. The tax applied for 2011‚Äì2012 and was expected to raise ‚Ç¨4 billion in revenue. On 19 August 2011 the Greek Minister of Finance, Evangelos Venizelos, said that new austerity measures \\"should not be necessary\\". On 20 August 2011 it was revealed that the government's economic measures were still off track; government revenue went down by ‚Ç¨1.9 billion while spending went up by ‚Ç¨2.7 billion. On a meeting with representatives of the country's economic sectors on 30 August 2011, the Prime Minister and the Minister of Finance acknowledged that some of the austerity measures were irrational, such as the high VAT, and that they were forced to apply them by the EU. October The fifth austerity package was aimed to ensure the 6th bailout instalment for Greece. The representatives of creditors required Greece to take new measures to limit state expenditures. That was one of the conditions so that the financing of Greek economy to continue normally. The new bill (called multi-bill) hit mostly civil servants and retirees. It was voted by the Greek parliament on 20 October 2011 amid protests. A man was killed during a demonstration at Syntagma Square. The major European countries then agreed on a reduction of Greek debt. Measures The package included: *A uniform pay scale for civil servants. Wages cut by 30% and wages and bonuses were capped. *Labor reserve offers civil servants who are dismissed 60% of their pay for one year. *The tax-free threshold for income tax would be lowered from ‚Ç¨12,000 to ‚Ç¨5,000. *Monthly pensions above ‚Ç¨1,200 cut by 20%. Retirees under 55 years old, the pension over ‚Ç¨1,000 is cut by 40% *Lump sum for retirees is cut by 20% to 30% *Education spending cut by closing or merging schools 2012 February The sixth austerity package was approved by the Hellenic Parliament in February 2012. Negotiations In October 2011, Papandreou got parliamentary backing for further austerity measures. These new measures would allow Greece to get an extra instalment of international loans, forming a second bailout package that would prevent a sovereign default and would allow the partial write-off of Greek debt, the so- called private sector involvement (PSI). As a result of this backing, the EU granted a quid pro quo of further austerity for a ‚Ç¨100bn loan and a 50% debt reduction through PSI. Within a week, Papandreou, backed unanimously by his cabinet, announced a referendum on the deal, sending shockwaves through financial markets. German chancellor Angela Merkel and French prime minister Nicolas Sarkozy then issued an ultimatum declaring that, unless the referendum approved the measures, they would withhold an overdue ‚Ç¨6bn loan payment to Athens, money that Greece needed by mid-December. Papandreou cancelled the referendum the next day after the opposition New Democracy Party, agreed to back the agreement. On 10 November Papandreou resigned following an agreement with the New Democracy party and the Popular Orthodox Rally to appoint a new prime minister to promulgate laws implementing the new measures that were agreed with the EU. The person chosen for this task was non-MP technocrat Lucas Papademos, former Governor of the Bank of Greece and former Vice- President of the European Central Bank; his appointment was criticised by left-wing parties and branded \\"unconstitutional\\". By contrast, three separate polls taken when Papademos assumed office revealed that around 75% of Greeks thought that temporary, emergency technocratic rule was \\"positive\\". The EU insisted that whichever government was elected in 2012, it must honour the agreed upon EU-IMF austerity strategy. It thus demanded that Greek party- political leaders sign legally binding letters to this effect, as well as to any additional measures that might be required in future as part of the second rescue-package. Papademos argued in favour of signing, despite opposition from major pro-austerity factions in his government. Such letters would bind governments to austerity and structural adjustment through 2020. It was announced that the general election to replace Papademos' administration was to be delayed until April, or even May 2012 because more time was needed to finalise plans, as well as to complete negotiations over debt reduction. Finalising the deal on the 50% PSI debt write-off, required by the Troika as a condition for extending more aid, proved difficult in early 2012, given objections primarily from hedge funds. In an interview with The New York Times, Papademos said that if his country did not receive unanimous agreement from its bondholders to voluntarily write down ‚Ç¨100bn of Greek's ‚Ç¨340bn debt, he would consider legislating to force bondholder losses, and that if things went well, Greeks could expect \\"an end to austerity\\" in 2013. Others believed that even the proposed 50% would not be enough to prevent a sovereign default. Approval In February, facing sovereign default, Greece needed more funds from the IMF and EU by 20 March, and was negotiating over a ‚Ç¨130 billion lending package. On 10 February, the Greek cabinet approved the draft bill of a new austerity plan, which was calculated to improve the 2012 budget deficit with ‚Ç¨3.3 billion (and a further ‚Ç¨10 billion improvement scheduled for 2013 and 2014). The austerity plan includes: * 22% cut in minimum wage from ‚Ç¨750 to ‚Ç¨585 per month * Permanently cancel holiday wage bonuses (one extra month's pay each year) * 150,000 jobs cut from state sector by 2015, including 15,000 by the end of 2012 * Pension cuts worth ‚Ç¨300 million in 2012 * Changes to laws to make it easier to lay off workers * Health and defence spending cuts * Industry sectors are given the right to negotiate lower wages depending on economic development * Opening up closed professions to allow for more competition, particularly in the health, tourism, and real estate sectors * Privatisations worth ‚Ç¨15 billion by 2015, including Greek gas companies DEPA and DESFA. In the medium term, the goal remains at ‚Ç¨50 billion The latest round of austerity measures meant that Greece would face at least another year of recession before the economy started to grow again. Foreign observers were shocked by both the cold-heartedness of German negotiators and a perceived lack of integrity from Greece not honoring its commitments. Showing disagreement, transport minister Makis Voridis from the Popular Orthodox Rally party, along with five deputy ministers from various ministries, resigned. On 11 February, Papademos warned of \\"social explosion and chaos\\" if the parliament did not approve the deal the next day. Speaking to members of Parliament before their vote, Papademos stated that if the majority voted against the austerity measures, the government would not be able to pay employee salaries. On 13 February, the Greek Parliament subsequently the measures 199 to 74. During the parliamentary debate, massive protests were witnessed in Athens that left stores looted and burned and more than 120 injured. The riot was one of the worst since 2010. Despite its position as one of the ruling parties, the Popular Orthodox Rally voted against the plan and withdrew from the government. Forty-three MPs from the other two ruling parties (social democratic PASOK and conservative New Democracy) also voted against the plan and were immediately expelled from their parties. This reduced the combined power of these two parties from 236 to 193 seats, still enough for a majority of the 300-seat parliament. The vote was a major precondition for the EU and IMF to jointly release the funds, which are supposed to cover all financial needs in 2012 and 2013, with the hope that Greece can start lending again at the private capital markets in 2014. The determination of the Greek leaders to implement the new austerity package was however doubted. For example, Antonis Samaras (leader of New Democracy) talked about renegotiating the deal, despite voting for the package. Because of this uncertainty, Eurozone finance ministers demanded that Greek main politicians sign a written assurance for their continued support to implement the austerity package, both before and after any elections. After passing the package on 13 February, four other hurdles remained for Greece to receive the new ‚Ç¨130 billion bailout loan: * ‚Ç¨325 million out of the total ‚Ç¨3.3 billion austerity package for 2012 needed to be specified in the form of some exact \\"structural expenditure reductions\\", to be outlined and passed by a separate bill. * Written commitments from the main party leaders had to be filed to guarantee their continued support for the program, both before and after elections in April. * The debt restructure agreement, with a debt write-off worth ‚Ç¨107 billion, needed to be implemented by a bond swap in early March, involving at least 95% of the private creditors. Under the terms, all the holders (banks, pension funds, insurers and others) of ‚Ç¨206 billion in government bonds, would have to write down the face value of their holdings by 53.5%, by swapping bonds they held for longer-dated securities that pay a lower coupon. When calculated for the bonds with the longest maturity, the 53.5% reduction of face value would be equal to a 74% loss on the net present value of the debt. The agreement included a collective action clause to force recalcitrant holders to participate. * A debt sustainability report by the Troika, based upon full implementation of the package and the debt agreement, needed to show a sustainable outlook for the Greek economy, reducing the debt relative to GDP to 120% in 2020. October The seventh austerity package was approved by the Hellenic Parliament in October 2012. Specific measures Some of the main elements are: * Bank recapitalisation * Tax reform * Labor market reform * Pension reform * The \\"Midterm fiscal plan 2013‚Äì16\\". The fiscal plan is an extension of the initial bailout package, as it contain the framework for ‚Ç¨5.3bn of additional measures (primarily tax hikes) to be implemented in 2015‚Äì16 along with the ‚Ç¨13.5bn of measures for 2013‚Äì14. The extension (and accompanying agreement) were to be covered in more details by a new bailout program in November 2012  History The package and reforms were outlined in the second bailout agreement (March 2012). Initially, the package only dealt with those ‚Ç¨13.5bn of measures (comprising ‚Ç¨10bn spending cuts and ‚Ç¨3.5bn tax hikes) for implementation in fiscal year 2013 and 2014. According to the implementation plan of the second bailout agreement, the measures were expected to have been passed by the Greek parliament in June 2012. The passage of the austerity package was delayed due to political turmoil. Two parliamentary elections were held, on 6 May and 17 June. Subsequent political calls prompted by a worsened recession asked for a 2-year extension of the bailout programme, and for the politicians to settle the exact content of the measures. This was finalised on 29 October. Negotiations As of 1 October, the Troika and the government were negotiating a ‚Ç¨13.5bn austerity package for 2013‚Äì14, of which ‚Ç¨10bn was to be implemented as spending cuts and ‚Ç¨3.5bn as tax hikes. The government's proposal was that the financial budget for 2013 should implement the first ‚Ç¨7.3bn of spending cuts and ‚Ç¨0.5bn of tax hikes; with the remaining cuts scheduled for 2014. According to earlier Troika statements, the report would depend on the level of ambition and seriousness of the government's measures and on the progress on structural reforms and privatisation. The Troika on 2 October explained to the government that the points agreed to in the March 2012 bailout agreement had to be effected before the ‚Ç¨31.5bn capital payment: * ‚Ç¨13.5 billion austerity package for 2013 and 2014, of which the Troika needed the government to deliver a specification of how they would achieve ‚Ç¨1.5 billion spending cuts for 2013 (mostly related to cuts for the health sector, defence, reform of local authorities and public sector) and ‚Ç¨2 billion measures scheduled for 2014 (mostly related to tax hikes). * Four structural reforms: ** Liberalization of professions previously legally protected against competition ** Deregulation of goods, services and energy markets ** Creation of a new body to manage state procurements ** Merging health insurance providers with the National Organization for Healthcare Provision (EOPYY) The Troika reportedly pushed for lower minimum wages and a 30% reduction of the compensation paid to dismissed employees. This proposal was rejected by the government. Another point of disagreement was whether 20,000 civil servants should be simply laid off (recommended by the Troika) or placed in a so-called \\"labor reserve scheme\\" at a reduced wage for two years before having their status re-evaluated (preferred by the government). On 3 October sources from the Greek Ministry of Finance revealed that the Troika had asked the government to frontload the austerity package with measures of ‚Ç¨9.3bn in 2013 with the remaining ‚Ç¨4.2bn to be implemented in 2014. The Troika expected a slightly worse GDP decline in 2013 compared to the government forecast and that the economy subsequently would recover faster if the austerity package frontloaded its savings for 2013. According to Kathimerini, the extra ‚Ç¨0.6bn of increased savings in 2013 would most likely be found by removing all Christmas, Easter and summer bonus payments for civil servants, equal to ‚Ç¨1000 per year for each civil servant. According to Kathemerini's source, the Troika had also indicated they were willing to accept the large tranche of unspecified savings from structural reforms, if the government were ready to accept the frontload of the austerity package. IMF at the same time also called for a decision to liberalise the fuel sector, as their review report of the sector had concluded that Greeks on a yearly basis currently pay about $1bn more for fuel than they should. The government attempted to sign a final deal with the Troika about the content and size of the austerity package and 2013 fiscal budget before the scheduled Eurogroup meeting on 8 October. If the Eurogroup approved the content of the negotiated deal, it would be submitted for a final approval by the European heads of state at the EU summit on 18 October. As the exact content of the package needed to be revealed before the Troika can reach its conclusion about the sustainbility of the Greek economy, it was expected this important report appear in the first half of November. On 17 October the Troika released the following statement: :\\"The [Greek] authorities and [Troika] staff teams agreed on most of the core measures needed to restore the momentum of reform and pave the way for the completion of the review. Discussions on remaining issues would continue from respective headquarters and through technical representatives in the field with a view to reaching full staff level agreement over the coming days. Furthermore, financing issues would be discussed between the official lenders and Greece.\\" Responding statements from the government indicated that an agreement about core elements had been agreed. Disagreement remained about labor market reforms, with the government still resisting direct layoffs or wage/pension cuts for public workers. Another outstanding point was that the government requested that the Troika finance a 2-year delay of the fiscal targets in the bailout plan, to avoid the need for the government to pass an additional austerity package (in addition to the ‚Ç¨13.5bn) to reach the initial fiscal targets. It was likewise hoped that these additional disagreements could be settled during additional talks with headquarters. At the EU summit on 19 October, it was announced the Eurogroup would arrange a conference call on 29 October to approve the final version of the austerity package, and provided this package subsequently was passed by the Greek parliament before 11 November, the Eurogroup was ready to make the decision at their ordinary meeting at 12 November to accept the release of the bailout funds. 16 October to 12 November * 16 Oct: Details for the bank recapitalisation were presented. The size of the recapitalisation was a potential ‚Ç¨48bn, of which the first ‚Ç¨18bn had already injected into the four biggest banks in the first half of 2012. The remaining recapitalisation was to be performed in three stages. At first the Hellenic Financial Stability Fund (HFSF) would immediately inject capital to the banks to reach the required 9% capital ratio. At the second stage HFSF would provide financial tools until the end of January, and at the third stage the permanent capital increases should be covered by the private sector by the end of April 2013. Banks with remaining capital inadequacies would find a solution before mid-June 2013. The 3 biggest systemic banks would get the remaining capital amounts covered by HFSF through the issue of common shares (where HFSF in return would pay the banks with EFSF bonds), while smaller banks would have to be either liquidated by HFSF or bought by other banks. The plan is for private shareholders to retain administrative control of the systemic banks, so during the next five years they would have the right at any time to buy back the shares from HFSF. Apparently the Troika have dropped their previous requirement for the capital ratios to be further increased to 10% by the end of June 2013. * 19 Oct: A new reform of the tax system was presented, with a flat rate 28% income tax for self-employed and enterprises, and a general 50% reduction in tax exemptions on property transactions, inheritances and parental donations. Starting from January 2013, all property owners would on a yearly basis have to pay the same single rate for property tax. The tax-free bonus for families with children would be abolished, and a ceiling would be introduced on exempted expenditures related to healthcare. Another major change is that all social benefits (previously exempted) would be taxed as salary revenues. For corporations the biggest change was that the tax-free threshold of ‚Ç¨5,000 per year would be abolished. All in all, the tax reform is expected to increase the government revenues by ‚Ç¨3bn per year. * 29 Oct: The Eurogroup working group held an extraordinary meeting to discuss the current debt sustainability in Greece, and potential solutions to improve it. It was decided to reject the call from the Democratic Left to attempt a further revision of the already negotiated labor market reform. * 29 Oct: The government signed a new act that would assign Greek Finance Ministry inspectors to monitor public expenditures for all those ministries and state bodies that do not comply with fiscal targets. The act also introduced an automatic mechanism giving the Finance Ministry power to immediately stop excessive expenditures. * 30 Oct: Prime minister Antonis Samaras announced the Troika negotiations about the fiscal plan 2013‚Äì16 and labor market reform had been successfully concluded, and was a subject for parliamentary approval the following week. The PASOK/New Democracy majority agreed to support the entire package. Democratic Left stated \\"We are not in agreement with the conclusion of the negotiations\\", and as a last resort would now attempt to \\"force the situation\\" by asking the eurozone leaders to overrule the Troika negotiators resistance to change essential parts of the labor market reform. * 30 Oct: The country's privatisation agency revised the previous revenue target from ‚Ç¨19bn by the end of 2015, to only ‚Ç¨11bn by the end of 2016. The revenues collected from the privatisation program was in March 2012 forecasted not only to reduce the debt by ‚Ç¨50bn, but also to generate an extra ‚Ç¨60bn investments from the buyers, resulting in ‚Ç¨3bn extra annual tax revenues for the government and 50,000 jobs; raising annual GDP growth by 1%. During the first 2.5 years after the May 2010 bailout, Greece had managed to sell public assets only worth ‚Ç¨1.6bn. * 31 Oct: A reform package to enable privatisations was narrowly passed. 30 MPs from PASOK and Democratic Left abstained. * 31 Oct: A reform proposal to merge the social security funds of journalists, civil engineers, lawyers and others with the National Organization for Healthcare Provision (EOPYY), did not pass. * 31 Oct: The Eurogroup noted significant progress had been made paving the way for a full staff level agreement between the Troika and the government. If certain actions were conducted by the Greek authorities, the Eurogroup would seek to finalize the Greek programme on 12 November. * 31 Oct: The government presented a worsened forecast for 2012 and 2013, with real GDP expected to decline by 6.5% and 4.5% respectively, while the debt-to-GDP ratio expected to reach 175.6% in 2012 and 189.1% in 2013. * 31 Oct: The government submitted the Midterm fiscal plan for 2013‚Äì16 to the parliament, with ‚Ç¨18.8bn of austerity measures scheduled ov erfour years. The package is frontloaded, meaning the measures would be implemented with: ‚Ç¨9.3bn (2013), ‚Ç¨4.1bn (2014), ‚Ç¨1.9bn (2015), ‚Ç¨2.7bn (2016). The measures include an increase in retirement age from 65 to 67 years, salary and pension cuts, and another round of tax increases. A vote for the plan is scheduled on 7 November, while the parliament would vote on the related 2013 Fiscal budget on 11 November. * 01 Nov: Export sector reform with a bucket of 19 measures, was presented by the government. It seeks to reduce administration costs for the export sector with 20% by 2015 (where a reduction of export fees is one of the direct saving measures), and halving the time to process exports through simplified approval procedures (i.e. by introducing the \\"Single Window\\" to operate as a one-stop- shop service). The reform was expected to boost the value of exported goods 10%, while also creating 80,000 jobs and resulting in an extra GDP growth of 1.7%. * 06 Nov: The two biggest labour unions started a 48-hour-long general strike in protest of the austerity measures and the labor market reform. * 07 Nov: The Greek parliament voted for the labor market reform, the proposal for merging various social security funds with the National Organization for Healthcare Provision (EOPYY) and the Midterm fiscal plan 2013‚Äì16. New Democracy and PASOK had to dismiss respectively 1 MP and 6 MPs (of which 4 had abstained, 1 opted to be absent, and 2 voted against), reducing the combined majority of the two parties to 153. As 14 out of 16 MPs from Democratic Left abstained, they would continue to be part of the coalition and they pledged to support and vote for the austerity-packed 2013 Fiscal budget on 11 November. * 08 Nov: The Eurogroup held an extraordinary meeting. Final decisions were postponed to 12 November. * 11 Nov: The Greek parliament was scheduled to vote for the 2013 Fiscal budget. Ahead of the vote, PASOK lost another MP who abandoned the party line, thus lowering the tally of PASOK MPs to 26. Two of the previously excluded MPs from New Democracy and PASOK unexpectedly decided to back the bill, while 1 MP from Democratic Left was absent, the bill by the end of the day passed. One New Democracy MP voted against the amendment concerning the extra labour market measures and was excelled from the party, lowering its number of MPs to 125, and reducing the combined majority with PASOK to 151 MPs. * 11 Nov: A draft version of the almost completed and long- awaited Troika surveillance report appeared that outlined the results for the Greek economy, reforms, privatisation programme and debt sustainability. Among other things it claimed that the 2-year extension of the bailout programme would cost ‚Ç¨32.6bn of extra loans from the Troika (‚Ç¨15bn in 2013‚Äì14 and ‚Ç¨17.6bn in 2015‚Äì16). * 12 Nov: Eurogroup and IMF agreed to consider a revised bailout plan. The Eurogroup proposed prolonged maturities and lower interest rates on existing loans and/or a debt-buy-back of the remaining privately held government bonds, then listed with a face value of ‚Ç¨63bn. The debt-buy-back would in practical terms mean that the Troika would buy all the remaining privately held bonds at a price close to the market price; an operation that would need the acceptance of private investors to sell at the offered price. If all private investors accepted a debt-buy-back at 30% of face value, it would require the Troika to issue ‚Ç¨18.9bn of new debt to finance the transaction, resulting in a net debt reduction for Greece at ‚Ç¨44.1bn (equal to a debt-to-GDP ratio decline of 23%). The crucial passage of the Labor market reform, Midterm fiscal plan 2013‚Äì16 and Fiscal budget 2013 resulted in the exclusion of several MPs from the three coalition parties. New Democracy lost 4 of 125, PASOK lost 7 of 26 and Democratic Left lost 3 of 14. The combined majority was reduced to 165/300 and that the majority for the two most reform- friendly parties was only 151 MPs. Parliament approval On 7 November amidst protests of tens of thousands of people, the Greek parliament narrowly approved another austerity package worth ‚Ç¨13.5 billion. Without the vote, the Troika warned, the next instalment of ‚Ç¨31.5 billion in financial aid would not be granted. Samaras told MPs that this package was \\"definitely the last\\", though some commentators immediately disagreed. The latest measures cut pension on average between 5% and 15% and increased the retirement age from 65 to 67. Wages of civil servants were cut again by up to 20%. Some workers from the public sector would lose as much as 30% of their salaries. 2013 The eighth austerity package included two multi-bills. April The first multi-bill was approved by Greek parliament on 28 April, receiving 168 votes. The law provided mass layoff in the public sector, extended working hours for teachers and other provisions. It also provided a new tax for immovable property that would be defined later. The teachers reacted to the bill by declaring strikes. However, the government prohibited the strikes, proceeding to implement Civil mobilization. July On 17 July, the Greek Parliament approved an eighth austerity package to secure payment of its next ‚Ç¨2.5 billion credit tranche. The laid off another 15,000 public employees, among them high school teachers, school guards and municipal policemen. Democratic Left (DIMAR) had withdrawn from the governing coalition in June. The package received 153 votes. The next day, a general ban on demonstrations was enacted and 4,000 police officers mobilized to avoid larger protests in the Greek capital during Sch√§uble's visit. 2014 The ninth austerity package was approved by Parliament on 9 May with 150 votes. It included provisions about Greek economic policy during the following four years. The bill's title was Medium-term Fiscal Strategy plan 2015-2018 and the relevant law is 4263/2014. The bill froze wages and pensions until 2018. It cut public sector expenses, such as the Ministry of Health. It provided that the primary surplus in 2014 would be 2.3% of GDP (‚Ç¨4.19 billion) 5.3% (‚Ç¨11.585 billion) in 2018. 2015 The parliament failed to elect a president and the Samaras Cabinet collapsed. The election took place on 25 January and the left-wing party Syriza won the election. The new government tried to adopt anti-austerity politics. In the first quarter of 2015 the Greek economy returned to recession. The deterioration of economy forced the government to accept another bailout, known as the Third Economic Adjustment Programme for Greece known as Third Memorandum. This bailout required a new austerity package. The first round of measures was approved by the Greek parliament on 16 July 2015. The measures include: *Transfer of many products to the high rate VAT (23%). The lower 13% rate covers fresh food, energy, water and hotel stays. 6% rate covers medicines and press. *Abolition of the VAT discount of 30% for the most tourism-popular Greek islands, after 1 October 2015 *Rise of tax for incomes over ‚Ç¨50,000 *Corporation tax rise from 26% to 29% for small companies *Luxury tax rise *Rise of health contributions paid by pensioners (6% from 4% ) *End to early retirement by 2022 and a retirement age increase to 67 The second set of measures passed on 23 July changed the Code of Civil Procedure. August The eleventh austerity package was voted by the Greek Parliament as part of the agreement between the Tsipras Government and the 'quartet' of creditors (the IMF, ECB, ESM and EU) for a third loan. The law contains two parts. The first was the loan agreement while the second contained the measures agreed to secure the first tranche of the new loan. It was tabled by the government on 13 August 2015 and was approved by parliament on 14 August 2015 with 222 votes for and 64 against. It included provisions about Greek economic policy during the three next years. The bill's title was Ratification of the Financial Assistance Draft Contract by the ESM and provisions for the implementation of the Financing Agreement. Vote in Parliament The Government tabled the Bill containing the measures and the loan agreement in the afternoon of August 13 and requested that it be discussed under the extremely urgent Parliamentary procedure. The bill passed the committees on August 13 and was discussed in the plenary session between 2 am and 10 am of August 14. At 6 am, the MPs decided by vote to shorten the discussion, thus the vote was held earlier than envisioned by the Standing Orders regarding extremely urgent procedures, at 10 am. Measures The measures passed by this bill were the following: *Diesel fuel tax for farmers going from ‚Ç¨66 per 1,000 liters to ‚Ç¨200/1,000 liters from October 1, 2015, and to ‚Ç¨330 by October 1, 2016. *Farmers‚Äô income tax to be paid in advance would rise from 27.5 percent to 55 percent. *Income tax for farmers is set to rise from 13 to 20 percent for 2016 and to 26 percent for 2017. *Freelancers would be subject to a gradual increase from 55 to 75 percent in advanced tax payments for income earned in 2015, increasin to 100 percent in 2016.

Among other measures, tonnage tax is to increase by 4 percent annually between 2016 and 2020. A special contribution by foreign cargo carriers would remain in place until 2019.

They are noted for making Celtic rock in Portuguese language (initially English), with often humorous lyrics.Sobre a banda. Official website. Accessed on 25 January 2013. The group performs live with traditional Celtic/Irish clothing. Besides performing Irish music, the members also research the subject, by attending Celtic music festivals in Europe. History All members live in Londrina, but not all of them were born there: Alexandre is from Astorga, Edgar is from Limeira, Bruno is from Jundia√≠ and Elcio is from Sorocaba. In 2005, vocalist Elcio Oliveira (who is also a general practitioner at a health center in Londrina) was in S√£o Paulo and met Ricardo (Rik) Dias, who was already working with Celtic music at the time. There, they went to a show by Irish band The Murphy's Law and Elcio decided to form a similar band. Back to Londrina, he joined his acquaintance, accordionist Alexandre Garcia, and together they formed the band, though still without bassist Bruno Guimar√£es and guitarist Eduardo Brancalion. Their first shows were in Londrina itself, often sold out. When Guimar√£es and Brancalion arrived, they started working with lyrics in Portuguese and their first song was \\"O Porco\\"(Rik Dias). In the beginning, the band had to buy their instruments abroad or ask for friends to bring them from other countries, but this is no longer necessary since the band can buy them via the internet. The band's debut album, No Sintoma (2007), was a cover album with traditional instrumentals or songs in English language. Its 2010 follow-up had original compositions in Portuguese language. It was titled Folkatrua, a word play and portmanteau of \\"Folk\\" and \\"Falcatrua\\" (scam), based on the fact that the band doest not limit itself to folk music, in spite of many labeling them as such. All tracks from both albums can be freely downloaded from the band's official website. In 2014, the band performed at the sixth edition of Rock in Rio Lisboa and was informally invited to perform at Rock in Rio Las Vegas. Later, the invitation was made official and they are expected to play on 8, 9, 15 and 16 May.

It is a rhizomatous perennial plant, from Taiwan, it has large white or lilac flowers. It is commonly known as the 'Taiwan iris'. It is cultivated as an ornamental plant in temperate regions. Description It has thick rhizomes, with slender branching stolons. It has the habit of creating large clumps of plants. It has herbaceous, erect, sword shaped, rigid, leaves that are greyish-green on one side and bright green on the other side. They can grow up to between long and 2‚Äì2.5 cm wide. The leaves have between 3 ‚Äì 5 veins or ribs. They are similar to Iris japonicas leaves. It has a thick, flowering stem that can vary, between long.} It is normally between long. The stems are smaller than Iris confusa stems. It has between 4 and 5 branches.British Iris Society (1997) The stems have 4‚Äì6 spathes (leaves of the flower bud), which have membranous margins. The stems (and branches) hold between 3 and 5 flowers, in Spring, between April to May (in the UK), or between March and April (in Europe). The flowers are similar to Iris japonica but with shorter basal leaves and larger white flowers. The flowers are in diameter, and come in shades of white, or lilac, light purple, or lavender, or pale blue. It has 2 pairs of petals, 3 large sepals (outer petals), known as the 'falls' and 3 inner, smaller petals (or tepals), known as the 'standards'. The falls are obovate, 4‚Äì5 cm long and 2.5 cm wide. They blue lines and yellow-brown (or purple, or mauve,) spots around a large yellow or orange crest. The falls have wavy and serrated or denticulated (toothed edge or margins). The standards reflexed obliquely, oblanceolate to oblong, and 2.5‚Äì3 cm long and 1.5 cm wide. It has a furrowed apex. It has a white 1 cm long perianth tube, 8‚Äì9 mm long anthers, that are oblong to linear in shape, 1.5 cm long white filaments and a 1 cm long ovary. It has pale blue or white style branches, that are 2 cm long and 6‚Äì7 mm wide, that has a fimbriate (fringed) lobe. It is self-sterile. After the iris has flowered, it produces an oblong-ovate seed capsule, measuring 3‚Äì4 cm long. It has the remains of the perianth tube on the apex of the capsule. Biochemistry As most irises are diploid, having two sets of chromosomes, this can be used to identify hybrids and classification of groupings. It has been count several times. Including 2n=28, Yasui 1939, ex Randolph & Mitra, AIS 140, 57. 1956, 2n=35, Chimphamba, 1973. and 2n=35 (JR Ellis and Y Lim). The chromosome count is normally published as,2n = 28, or as 2n=28, 35.  Taxonomy It has the common name of 'Taiwan Iris'. It is written as Âè∞ÊπæÈ∏¢Â∞æ or Ëá∫ÁÅ£È≥∂Â∞æ in Chinese script and also known as tai wan yuan wei in Pinyin in China. The pinyin common name is derived from the 'Milvus' tail flower, because the shape of the irises flower is similar in form to that of the tail of the Milvus (or kite). It is known in Japanese as I wa ta shi san ga ya meaning 'Taiwan butterfly flower'. The Latin specific epithet formosana refers to the island of Formosa (former name of Taiwan). It was first published and described by Jisaburo Ohwi in Acta Phytotaxonomica et Geobotanica. (Acta Phytotax. Geobot.) Vol.3 page115 in 1934. It was verified by United States Department of Agriculture and the Agricultural Research Service on 4 April 2003, and then updated on 2 December 2004. Iris formosana is a tentatively accepted name by the RHS. Distribution and habitat Iris formosana is native to temperate regions of Asia. Range It is found in north eastern Taiwan. Habitat It grows at forest margins, on hillsides or steep cliffs and beside roadsides. It grows at mid-elevation and low-elevation mountain, altitudes of between above sea level. Conservation It is increasingly becoming scarce in the wild. The habitat of Iris formosana, is threaten by various factors including, climate change, and human influences. Examples of loss of habitat includes a roadside being mowed regularly and sprayed with herbicide, and mudslides caused by torrential rains collapsing mountainous crags. Cultivation It is not hardy to in northern climates, and will not tolerate frosts. It is hardy to USDA Zone 8 or 9 (‚àí6 ¬∞C to ‚àí1 ¬∞C) Due to its non-hardiness in the UK, it is uncommon in cultivation. It prefers to grow in humus rich soils, with good drainage. It can tolerate various soil types, including calcareous or siliceous. It can tolerate neutral or acidic soils (PH levels between 6.5 ‚Äì 7.5). It prefers positions in the shade or partial shade. It also prefers to be moist during the growing season, or have medium to high humidity level. Over watering or excess water at winter can kill the plant. It can be grown in a mixed flower border, or as a ground cover plant. It can be also grown in containers, in sheltered positions. It can be affected by slugs and snails. Propagation It can also be propagated by division, or by seed growing. It is thought to be able to root in water. If the water contains lumps of charcoal, to reduce bad smells.

After Dmitroviƒá's death, the printing house was taken over by Trojan Gunduliƒá, who organized publishing of the first and only book of this printing house, the Gospel, printed and edited in 1552 by Hieromonk Mardarije.  Under Dmitroviƒá  Count Radi≈°a Dmitroviƒá, a Serb nobleman and native of Herzegovina, bought the printing press and types and employed Hieromonk Mardarije as editor and printer. Some earlier sources speculated that the Belgrade in question was actually Berat in Albania or some other Belgrade on the Balkans. Dmitroviƒá died before the first book was printed in his printing house. According to some sources, he died before the printing press he bought was even delivered to him, while some other sources say he died during the printing of the first book.  Under Gunduliƒá  After Dmitroviƒás death, the printing press was received by Trojan Gunduliƒá, a member of the noble Gondola family, who lived in the large colony of Ragusans in Belgrade as an illegitimate son of a Ragusan nobleman. Gunduliƒá moved the press to his house, which was located in the part of the Belgrade called Zerek, near the Bayrakli mosque, which is today Gospodar Jevremova Street. Gunduliƒá personally sold books in Belgrade. Gunduliƒá did not find the printing business profitable, however, and did not continue with it.  Aftermath  Hieromonk Mardarije moved the printing press from Belgrade to the Mrk≈°ina crkva monastery and established the Mrk≈°ina crkva printing house there. According to some sources, it was Mardarije who inspired first Dmitroviƒá and then Gunduliƒá to invest in the printing business and who organized all activities during the set-up of the printing house in Belgrade.

The painting depicts fairies dancing above the water, in a moonlit landscape. Painting The fairies dancing in the meadow in the twilight flow over the romantic landscape; one of them bends over the water to catch a glimpse of her own image. This visionary painting depicts the morning mist turning into fairies, like the spirits of untamed nature. Fairies were seen as delicate, tender, sensitive but also capricious and inclined to have their feelings hurt easily and take offence if not treated well. In the Swedish folk tradition, people were warned to watch out for elves, as they could be dangerous for those who were not careful with them. The fairies in Norse mythology's hidden people have survived in local folklore often as beautiful young women, living in the wild on hills, woods and mounds of stones. In Romantic art and literature, elves are typically pictured as fair- haired, white-clad, and nasty when offended. In order to protect themselves and their livestock against malevolent elves, Scandinavians could use an √Ñlvkors (Elf cross), which was carved into buildings or other objects.The article Alfkors in Nordisk familjebok (1904). Painter August Malmstr√∂m's Dancing Fairies is a widely recognised work in its home country. Malmstr√∂m, who was a professor at the Royal Swedish Academy of Arts, was one of the Swedish artists who aspired to create a national Swedish art. He used themes both from Norse mythology and folklore, and his images often depicted fairies and other spirits of nature.

He has been a member of the pop group The Twilights (1964 - 1969) as well as being a solo performer and composer. The Twilights had eight consecutive national hit singles including \\"Needle in a Haystack\\" and \\"What's Wrong with the Way I Live\\". After The Twilights, Peter Brideoake formally studied music and established himself as a multi-talented musician, composer and university lecturer. Brideoake (as a member of The Twilights) was inducted into the South Australian Music Hall of Fame on 10 April 2015.  Career  Peter Brideoake was born and educated in Adelaide, South Australia on 23 April 1945. His musical career began as a rhythm guitarist and vocalist in a popular Australian pop group (The Twilights, 1964 - 1969). At times, Peter Brideoake co-wrote with Terry Britten and Glenn Shorrock. The Twilights officially broke up in 1969. However, they played at reunion or special concerts in 2000, 2002, 2011 and 2015. In 1969, Brideoake commenced studies in music composition at the University of Adelaide. Following his graduation with a Bachelor of Music ( Hons ) he began teaching harmony and modern composition techniques. From 1975, Peter Brideoake was a career lecturer at the Elder Conservatorium of Music in Adelaide. After several periods of study in China, Brideoake became a proficient performer on the ancient Chinese zither (Ch'in or guqin) instrument. In 1978, Brideoake was awarded the John Bishop Memorial Commission; other commissioned works have been composed for the Sydney String Quartet, the Australian Chamber Orchestra, the Seymour Group, the Victorian String Quartet and, more recently, by percussionist Ryszard Pusz.  The Twilights  The musical career of Peter Brideoake began in Adelaide, South Australia as a rhythm guitarist and vocalist in a popular Australian pop group (The Twilights, 1964 - 1969) which reached the peak of its success in 1966. The Twilights consisted of Frank Barnard (drums 1964-65), Peter Brideoake (rhythm guitar, vocals), Terry Britten (lead guitar, vocals), John Bywaters (bass, vocals), Clem \\"Paddy\\" McCartney (lead vocals), Laurie Pryor (drums 1965-69) and Glenn Shorrock (lead vocals). The Twilights have earned acclaim and respect for their formidable body of recorded work, coupled with their legendary status as arguably the most polished and accomplished Australian live act of the era. Glenn Shorrock himself remembers \\"Twilight Time\\" as the happiest and most fulfilling experience in his long and distinguished musical career.

Pastoral Symphony comprised the full Twilights lineup, augmented by Terry Walker (The Strangers) on lead vocals, Ronnie Charles (The Groop) doing backup vocals; and The Johnny Hawker Orchestra. After The Twilights peak period (1964-1969), which included many recordings and performances (stage and television) around Australia, in New Zealand and the United Kingdom, the group disbanded and Peter Brideoake returned to Adelaide in 1969.

In 1969, he began studies in composition with Richard Meale at the Elder Conservatorium of Music at the University of Adelaide. Following his graduation with a Bachelor of Music ( Hons ) he began teaching harmony and modern composition techniques at the Elder Conservatorium. Academia From 1975, Brideoake was a career lecturer at the Elder Conservatorium of Music in Adelaide for the next 27 years. As well as teaching in composition studies, he introduced a course in Chinese music as the result of an interest in the music, theatre and language of China. A special interest in an ancient Chinese zither (Ch'in or guqin) meant that after several periods of study in China, he became a proficient performer on this instrument. In 1978 he was awarded the John Bishop Memorial Commission; other commissioned works have been composed for the Sydney String Quartet, the Australian Chamber Orchestra, the Seymour Group, the Victorian String Quartet and, more recently, by percussionist Ryszard Pusz.

Live Design is geared towards aspiring and established designers in the disciplines of lighting, audio, projection, and scenery. The magazine also manages its own website. Live Design is affiliated with the LDI trade show, and hosts the Live Design Master Classes and Envision Symposium. History In March 1967, the first issue of Theatre Crafts was published by Emmaus, PA-based Rodale Press, which was owned by J. I. Rodale. Marshall Ackerman was Theatre Crafts‚Äô first publisher. The magazine focused on news of theatre design and its technology. Theatre Crafts began with a free circulation to high school and college drama instructors. Geared towards the offstage performers, the magazine featured ‚Äúhow-to‚Äù articles from theatre designers of costumes, lighting, sets, and more. In 1969, C. Ray Smith became the editor for Theatre Crafts and shaped it into a more professional magazine for the theatre industry. In January 1970, Patricia MacKay joined the editors. Theatre Crafts grew from strictly theatre, to covering film, concerts, theme parks, retail shops, television, opera, and architecture. In June 1977, Theatre Crafts‚Äô sister publication, Lighting Dimensions released its first issue. The magazine focused on lighting and design in concerts, theatre, film, and architecture. Patricia MacKay bought Theatre Crafts from Rodale Publishing in 1982. Theatre Crafts then acquired Lighting Dimensions in February 1986. MacKay organized a trade show for the entertainment industry called LDI. It made its debut in Dallas, Texas in 1988 with over a hundred exhibitors and 3,000 attendees. It has run each year ever since. On its 25th anniversary in 1992, Theatre Crafts became TCI (Theatre Crafts International) to include international coverage, and also redesigned to tablet size. In January 1996, Intertec Publishing of Overland Park, KS, which eventually became Penton after numerous transitions, acquired TCI, Lighting Dimensions, and LDI. Eventually, TCI became Entertainment Design. Entertainment Design and Lighting Dimensions were merged into Live Design in December 2005. Live Design closed its print publication and converted to a digital, interactive app and magazine for Apple products in December 2013, and implemented an Android version in October 2014. \\"Remembering Print\\" Davi Napoleon recalls the transitions at Live Design.

Over 350 companies exhibit and provide live demos and gear showcases. The trade show is concerned with lighting, sound, projection, staging and truss, and special effects. Live Design Master Classes Live Design‚Äôs master classes feature top designers from their respective disciplines. The Broadway Master Classes (BMC) originated as Broadway Lighting Master Classes (BLMC), run by Sonny Sonnenfeld, who started it with nine-time Tony Award-winning lighting designer, Jules Fisher.

Hosted in New York, BMC is geared towards both students and professionals. Fisher and sound designer, Abe Jacob have been the creative consultants for the BLMC and BSMC, respectively, since their inception.

Punta de Anaga is the most northerly point on the island, and is where the Anaga mountain range meets the sea. It was originally proposed to construct a second order lighthouse on the Savage Islands, which lie 165 km north of Tenerife. But the sovereignty of the islands was an issue, so a first order light was commissioned at Punta de Anaga instead.  History  Completed in 1864, it is one of the oldest lighthouses in the Canaries; Punta de Jand√≠a on Gran Canaria was also opened in the same year. Built in a similar style to other Canarian 19th century lights, it consists of a white washed single storey house, with dark volcanic rock used for the masonry detailing. A twelve metre high tower, with a twin gallery is attached to the seaward side of the house, facing the Atlantic Ocean. The lighthouse still retains its original Fresnel lens, which was supplied by Barbier and Fenestre of Paris. With a focal height of above the sea, its light can be seen for 21 nautical miles.

The cultivar definitely dates back to earlier than the 17th century, and was probably cultivated by the Romans. It is known for its intense flavor which mellows with storage. Names The apple's name is derived from corps pendu in French, which refers to the short stalk of the fruit.Trees of Antiquity *You tube This also matches with its German name \\"Kurzstiel\\" or how it is named in Deutsche Pomologie \\"Koeniglicher Kurzstiel\\", meaning the royal short stalk. It is also called the \\"Wise Apple\\" because of its late flowering, which avoids the risk of blossom damage due to frost.National Fruit Collection *Medieval Cookery Description 'Court Pendu Plat' has a unique texture which is dense but not crisp, similar to cheddar cheese, so it is recommended to cut it with a knife and not bite in while whole. The skin is greenish yellow and flushed with red, and is often russeted. The fruit's shape is extremely flattened. It is mainly eaten fresh, but can also be used in cooking. The apple is rather dry and not very juicy. The Court Pendu Plat tree is a spur-bearer with attractive flowers. It has a good resistance to general apple diseases, especially to scab and to mildew, as well as a resistance to frost. The apple is harvested late, usually in October. Descendants 'Court Pendu Plat' is a direct progenitor of the 'Suntan' apple and a more distant ancestor for the 'Flamenco' apple.

The centre is staffed by Cuban and Sierra Leonean medics and international aid workers from Save the Children while the healthcare section are manned by British Army medics. On 29 December 2014, Pauline Cafferkey, a British aid worker who had just returned to Glasgow from working at the treatment centre in Kerry Town, was diagnosed with Ebola at Glasgow's Gartnavel General Hospital.

His tenure ended in 1992, and he was succeeded by the Moderate Republican Jay Dardenne, the current Louisiana commissioner of administration and the former lieutenant governor. His legislative service corresponded with the first three administrations of Governor Edwin Edwards and the intervening years of Governors David C. Treen and Buddy Roemer.

Childhood and education Jacobs was born in the Williamsburg section of Brooklyn, the second of four children of Max Jacobs (1883‚Äì1978), an immigrant from Austro-Hungary, and his American-born wife, Kate (Kayla) Fried Jacobs (1890‚Äì1982). Max and his siblings were the founders and proprietors of Detecto Scales, which supplied scales and knives to local butchers. Max and Kate became active in Jewish community affairs, helping to found a synagogue, Young Israel of Eastern Parkway, and the first mikveh (ritualarium) in Crown Heights, the Brooklyn neighborhood to which the Jacobs family relocated in the early 1930s. For elementary school, Jacobs attended Torah Vodaas, the first all-day Orthodox Jewish school in the neighborhood. For his high school education, Harold, like most of his peers, attended Boys High School, supplemented by private tutoring in Judaic subjects. In the autumn of 1929, Jacobs enrolled in the business program at St. John's College, attending classes at night while working during the day at a butcher supplies store that his father opened in Crown Heights. Jacobs's education was interrupted by complications from a sports-related injury to his leg, which resulted in hospitalization for nearly a year and multiple surgeries. After finishing his B.A., he went to graduate school at Columbia University, earning a master's degree in economics. Marriage and early career In 1932, Jacobs met Pearl Schraub (1912‚Äì1993), a secretary in his father's company who likewise was the daughter of an Austrian immigrant and his American-born wife. They were married in 1935, settled in Crown Heights, and had three children, Vivian (1939 - ), Joseph (1943- ), and Paul (1945 - ). With a loan from his father, Jacobs transformed the butcher supplies store into Precision Metal Products, a manufacturer first of frying pans and then airplane parts. Entering the field just as the United States Postal Service was beginning to use airplanes and commercial airplane companies were expanding, Precision proved to be a huge success. During World War II ‚Äî Jacobs was exempt from service because of his leg injury ‚Äî Precision supplied airplane parts to the U.S. military. After the war, he sold the company and launched Precisionware, a manufacturer of wooden kitchen cabinets, which were in great demand during the postwar surge of suburban home construction. With factories in Pennsylvania and Florida, Precisionware blossomed into the second-largest cabinet manufacturer in the United States. By 1961, it was listed on the American Stock Exchange. Brooklyn Jewish communal life Jacobs was deeply devoted to the importance preserving Orthodox Jewish life in the face of pressures to assimilate. He was committed to the principle that it was possible to simultaneously maintain a religious observant lifestyle and participate in American society. This was no easy task in an era when Blue Laws discouraged Saturday Sabbath observance, few kosher products were available in supermarkets, and kosher restaurants were a rarity, especially outside New York City. Jacobs served in leadership roles in an array of Orthodox institutions. He was president of Young Israel of Eastern Parkway from 1949 to 1953, president of the Crown Heights Yeshiva from 1953 to 1968, and even helped lead a local Sabbath-observant boy scout troop. He became an officer, and eventually president, of the Brooklyn Jewish Community Council. He also served on the board of directors of the Torah Vodaas and Chaim Berlin day schools, chaired the annual dinners of the local Lubavitcher and Bobover yeshivas and the Brooklyn Joint Passover Committee, and served as vice- president of the Yeshiva of Eastern Parkway. The Jewish Press, a Brooklyn- based Jewish weekly newspaper, remarked in 1966 that Jacobs was \\"active in every major and minor Jewish organization in Brooklyn.\\" Jacobs's involvement in Brooklyn Jewish communal life was so extensive that he was widely known as \\"the mayor of Crown Heights.\\" Jewish Press, May 6, 1966. Beginning in 1952, Jacobs assumed a leading role in the Orthodox community's campaign for the abolition of New York State's Blue Law, which mandated the closing of businesses on Sundays. As chairman of the Joint Committee for a Fair Sabbath Law, Jacobs led delegations of Jewish leaders to Albany to lobby legislators on the issue, and worked hard to mobilize Christian support for abolition of the law. Jacobs utilized his contacts in the Madison Club, the key local Democratic Party branch in Brooklyn, to advance the Sabbath Law effort. The campaign represented one of the earliest organized forays by Orthodox Jews into the world of American political lobbying. They achieved a partial victory in 1963, when the state legislature agreed to permit businesses in New York City to open on Sundays. Two years later, the rule was extended to the rest of the state. New leadership roles In 1964, with Precisionware at the peak of its success, Jacobs sold the company to a large conglomerate, Triangle-Pacific Forest Products. Stepping away from the daily grind of managing company affairs, Jacobs turned his attention to a series of a new projects. He assumed a leadership role in ‚ÄúCommerce, Labor, Industry Corporation of Kings County,‚Äù or CLICK, a group of local businessmen working to revitalize the Brooklyn Navy Yard; he was appointed, by New York Governor Nelson Rockefeller, to the Advisory Committee of the New York State Small Business Administration (1965); and he was named, by Mayor John Lindsay, to the New York City Youth Board (1970). At the same time, Jacobs became increasingly active in a national Jewish organization, the Union of Orthodox Jewish Congregations of America (OU), which is the umbrella group for modern Orthodox synagogues and also functions as the largest supervisor of kosher food products in the United States. As the voice of Orthodox Judaism in such national Jewish forums as the Conference of Presidents of Major American Jewish Organizations, the National Jewish Community Relations Advisory Council, and the Synagogue Council of America, the OU took the Orthodox viewpoint out of the narrow confines of Brooklyn and brought it into the halls of political power, both within and beyond the Jewish community. Jacobs was invited to join the OU board of directors in 1958, soon afterwards was elevated to the post of vice president, and would, in 1967, become chairman of its board, the second most powerful position in the organization.  Black-Jewish tensions Tensions between Jews and African-Americans in New York City spiraled in the mid-1960s, with a series of violent assaults on Jews and Jewish institutions, particularly in Brooklyn. These incidents spurred the establishment of Jewish civilian patrols, known as the Maccabees, of which Jacobs was a supporter. An attempt by black militants to take over the administration of the Oceanhill- Brownsville school district and fire Jewish teachers led to a citywide teachers' strike in 1968. Jacobs headed a committee of Brooklyn Jewish leaders that sought to influence Mayor John Lindsay to reinstate the teachers. There was also a major clash over the attempted appointment of an outspoken anti- Semite to head a new black studies program at New York University. At the same time, African-American militants initiated a series of protests, some of them violent, to demand the guaranteed admission of black and Latino students to city colleges regardless of their grades. Jacobs spoke out strongly against these demands, arguing that racial quotas were unfair to other students and would undermine the integrity of the educational system. At the same time, Jacobs initiated an OU program to help Jewish residents relocate from deteriorating inner city neighborhoods where they were threatened by rising crime and antisemitism. National Jewish leadership Meanwhile, Jacobs assumed an increasingly prominent role in the work of the Orthodox Union. His first major success was in compelling Jewish funeral homes to agree to a set of uniform standards that helped ensure less expensive burials and stricter adherence to Jewish religious laws pertaining to the deceased. In 1972, Jacobs was elected president of the OU. Jacobs inherited an organization in difficult financial straits, and devoted much of his early presidential tenure to fundraising. As the OU returned to financial health, he was able to focus on his educational and programming agenda, at the top of which was the goal of expanding outreach to young American Jews with little or no background in Judaism. This was at a time when outreach efforts by groups such as Chabad and Aish HaTorah were still in their infancy. The OU's National Conference of Synagogue Youth (NCSY) set up chapters around the country, run primarily by the teenagers themselves, which offered educational activities and, in particular, Shabbatons. These weekend experiences, with their strong combination of religious and social appeal, proved extremely successful and helped groom numerous future Jewish community activists, educators, and leaders. Many senior officials of the OU itself started out as NCSY participants. Jacobs regarded NCSY as a critical component in the process of both preserving and expanding Orthodox Judaism in America. During the years of his precedence, he presided over what one of his colleagues characterized as ‚Äúthe largest growth and expansion of NCSY in its history.‚Äù \\"Jewish Action,\\" Fall 1995, p.82. He also participated in many NCSY gatherings around the country, in order to establish a personal rapport with attendees. During the Jacobs presidency, the OU Center was opened in Israel, and the Zula project was begun to open a drop-in center in Jerusalem for troubled or socially disadvantaged teens. Struggle over the Synagogue Council of America Jacobs's rise in the OU leadership coincided with a growing conflict over the organization's membership in the Synagogue Council of America. The council had been established in 1925 as a means for the Reform, Conservative, and Orthodox movements to present a united Jewish position to the outside world. In the 1950s the make-up of the American Orthodox community began to change, due to an influx of postwar European immigrants who identified with the more insular, or haredi, sector of the community. As a result, a growing number of Orthodox Jews began urging the OU to withdraw from the council, lest its participation be seen as granting de facto religious legitimacy to the non-Orthodox movements. Manhattanites and out-of-towners tended to favor continuing cooperation with the non-Orthodox groups, while Brooklynites, who were more deferential to haredi rabbinical leaders, tended to favor withdrawing from the council. Jacobs sympathized with the advocates of withdrawal but in his role as president of an organization with a large anti-withdrawal faction, refrained from openly campaigning to pull out of the council. A resolution at the 1966 OU national convention asking for withdrawal from the council was defeated, 74 to 16. By early 1974, however, opposition to the council reached the point that the OU's board of directors voted to suspend the organization's participation in the council until a full debate and vote were held at the next convention. Jacobs' personal papers state that the withdrawal, albeit short term, was \\"over the debate surrounding 'Who is a Jew?'\\". At the November 1974 assembly, following what the New York Times called \\"a stormy debate,\\" Jacobs brokered a compromise whereby the delegates voted to create a 40-man commission to study the issue further. They ultimately recommended staying in the council, and in March 1975, an expanded meeting of the OU board of directors voted 68 to 56 to resume the organization's participation in the Synagogue Council.\\"New York Times,\\" December 1, 1974. Jews and the Democratic Party Jacobs became involved in American politics through the Madison Club, a Democratic Party machine in Brooklyn that addressed local needs while grooming future city and state political leaders. He became close to future New York City mayor Abraham Beame serving as his campaign finance chairman and future New York State Assembly leader Stanley Steingut, among others. Jacobs himself briefly was a candidate for the New York State Senate in 1958. The relationship between New York City's Jewish community and the Democratic Party became strained in the 1960s and early 1970s as many Jews began to perceive the Democratic leadership as weak in response to black militants, campus unrest, and crime. When the staunchly liberal George McGovern won the Democratic presidential nomination in 1972, many Jews, apparently including Jacobs, voted for a Republican for president for the first time in their lives. U.S.-Israel relations soon became another flashpoint for tensions between the Jewish community and the Democrats. In early 1976, the New York division of the Women's International League for Peace and Freedom, an overwhelmingly Democratic advocacy group, contacted a number of U.S. senators to protest their pro-Israel stance. Jacobs led a counter-protest effort, personally persuading Senator McGovern's wife, Eleanor, to resign from the group. These pressures persuaded the national League leadership to disavow the New York branch's actions. Jacobs also repeatedly protested President Jimmy Carter's unfriendly policies toward Israel. In 1978, the OU attempted, unsuccessfully, to mobilize enough members of Congress to block Carter's sale of advanced jet fighters to Arab states. Jacobs strongly defended the positions of Israeli Prime Minister Menachem Begin and challenged American Jewish critics of Begin for undermining the Israeli government. He was also outspoken in support of the right of Jews to reside in the disputed Judea-Samaria territories. ‚ÄúHow in the name of human rights can we entertain the idea of prohibiting the people of the Bible from living in peaceably anywhere in the Land of the Bible?,\\" he asked in one address.Harold M. Jacobs speech, May 1, 1978, Folder 3: Speeches by Harold Jacobs, 1976-1978, Box 17, Harold M. Jacobs Papers, Yeshiva University Archives, New York City. Leader of Young Israel After his final term as president of the OU in late 1978, Jacobs became active in another national Orthodox Jewish organization, the National Council of Young Israel, and was elected President in June 1981. Although smaller than the OU, the NCYI enabled Jacobs to maintain a position of influence in the American Orthodox leadership and made it possible for him to continue serving as a delegate to meetings of the Jerusalem-based Agency Executive, where funding and policy decisions often impacted issues of concern to Orthodox Jewry. As president of Young Israel, Jacobs initiated broader outreach efforts to Jews on college campuses and continued to speak out against U.S. pressure on Israel.  Board of Higher Education  In 1970, Jacobs was one of the founders of Medgar Evers College, a new branch of the City University of New York that would primarily serve African-American students in Brooklyn. In 1974, he was appointed by his friend, the newly elected Mayor Abraham Beame, to serve on the Board of Higher Education of the City of New York, also known as the Board of Trustees of the City University of New York; two years later, he became chairman of the Board. Jacobs advocated charging tuition for City University, \\"which began in 1975.\\" In August 1991, Prof. Leonard Jeffries, chairman of the African-American Studies department of the City College of New York publicly accused Jews of conspiring to bring about \\"the destruction of black people,\\" When the 1991-1992 academic year ended the following June, the Board voted unanimously to replace Jeffries as chairman of the department, although that did not affect his position as a faculty members. Jeffries then sued the board, demanding reinstatement and $25-million in damages. The board members argued in court that they acted against Jeffries not because of his opinions but because of evidence of his incompetence as department chair. In May 1993, a jury found that Jacobs and five other board members guilty of depriving Jeffries of his right to free speech; they were singled out because in board meetings, they were the strongest advocates for taking action against Jeffries. The jury also awarded Jeffries $400,000 in punitive damages. In 1994-1995, however, appeals courts nullified the monetary award and overturned the conviction, vindicating the Board of Higher Education members. The final ruling was handed down just weeks before Jacobs died at age 83. Book A book about Jacobs' life was co-authored by his son Paul and American historian Rafael Medoff.

It is on a spur in the floodplain of the river Severn, in the Trewern community area of what is now Powys, to the north of the A458 road from Shrewsbury to Welshpool. It is a fine example of a Severn Valley Half-timbered house. The Grade II* listed hall was occupied by the Lloyd, Francis and Whittaker families. In 1985-6 (SW end) and 1993-4 (NE end) it was extensively restored with some remodelling by the architect M.J.Garner for Murray.Ll. Chapman. Architecture Trewern Hall or Trewern Farmhouse, Montgomeryshire 1884 The earliest depiction of Trewern Hall is a print of the house by Thomas Edward Pryce, who visited the house in December 1883. In his description of the house he notes that the porch was ‚Äò‚Äòbadly mutilated‚Äô‚Äô and that inside and all decorative features had been removed.‚Äô‚ÄòPryce‚Äô‚Äô, 159‚Äì161. The date 1610 and the initials R F also occur on a tie beam in the plainer kitchen wing to the east. The front of the house is nearly symmetrical with two outer gables with a hall between, the latter flanked by two-storeyed gabled wings. To the right is a porch with a lobby entrance to the hall and access to the kitchen wing. The main hall of the house had small square windows divided by moulded mullions at a high level in the room to an oriel window. In the exterior, the 17th century timber framing consists of two upper courses of decorative quadrants, and a herringbone pattern. The house is also jettied on three sides on corbels, carved with figures and heads on the front.Scourfield R. and Haslam R.

Name Houtong was originally called Kau-tong () due to the existence of a cave inhabited by monkeys in the early days. History Houtong was once a rich small mining town in Ruifang, renowned for a well-preserved culture surrounding its railway, which was built during the Japanese rule of Taiwan. During its prosperous years, the area produced around 220,000 tons of coal per year, the largest coal output of a single area in Taiwan. This attracted many immigrants to the area, which further spurred the town's growth to as many as 900 households with a population of more than 6,000 people. The last facility built in the area was a coal purification factory, built in 1920. As the coal mining industry began to decline in the 1990s, the area also declined. Young residents started to emigrate to look for other opportunities, and eventually only few hundred residents remained once the mining industry had died out. However, things started taking a turn for the better from 2008, when a local cat lover organized volunteers to start offering abandoned cats a better life. They posted the cats' pictures online, resulting in an overwhelming response from other cat lovers around the nation. Soon, Houtong became a center for cat lovers as word spread, and the number of cats living there increased ‚Äì thus reviving a declining village, and transforming it into a tourist destination. Some cats are sterilized, and will have one of their ears trimmed as confirmation ‚Äì this helps to keep check on the local population of cats, and also helps identify new cats which enter into the village. Features The village features shops, cafes and relaxing places for tourists. It is also located near the origin of the Keelung River. The pristine, green waters of the river are accessible via steps. Drivers entering the town are greeted with a sign that reads 'A lot of stray cats here. Drive slowly.' A special bridge has been constructed above the busy railway, to allow safe passage for the cats. Access to the Keelung River is available via stairway. Transportation The village is accessible from Houtong Station of Taiwan Railways Administration. From Jiufen, it is approximately 10 minutes and NT 350 by taxi, which makes it a good secondary destination after Jiufen if planning a day trip. Houtong is also the origin of two trails which can be hiked to reach Jiufen.

She survived the illness.  Initial admission to hospital  On 29 December 2014, Cafferkey, who had just returned to Glasgow from Sierra Leone via Casablanca Airport and London Heathrow Airport, was diagnosed with Ebola virus disease at Glasgow's Gartnavel General Hospital. She had been working at an Ebola treatment centre in Kerry Town in Sierra Leone, and it is thought she contracted the virus as a result of wearing a visor, as recommended by the World Health Organization and the UK Ministry of Defence, instead of goggles. After initial treatment in Glasgow, she was transferred by air to RAF Northolt, then to the specialist high-level isolation unit at the Royal Free Hospital in London for longer-term treatment. A Scottish government spokesman described the risk to the general public as \\"extremely low to the point of negligible\\" due to the very early stage of the infection at the time of detection. Contact tracing was carried out on the other passengers who traveled on the flight from London to Glasgow with her. Medical staff described her condition at the time as \\"as well as we can hope for at this stage.\\" On 4 January 2015, the Royal Free Hospital announced that her condition had deteriorated to critical, with her health later stabilising before she was declared no longer critically ill on 12 January. Cafferkey received blood plasma from William Pooley and has been treated with experimental drugs as part of her treatment. On 24 January, she was declared to be free of infection, and released from hospital. 2015 readmission to hospital  The prognosis after recovery from Ebola virus disease can include joint pains, muscular pain, skin peeling, or hair loss. In a media interview in September 2015, Cafferkey said \\"I‚Äôve had trouble with my thyroid, lost some of my hair and get really sore joints but I guess side effects are to be expected.\\" It was found in 2015 that, after an apparent complete cure, with the bloodstream, saliva and organs such as the liver free of the Ebola virus, it can linger on in parts of the body not protected by the immune system, including fluid in the eye, the central nervous system and, in men, the testes and semen. Cafferkey went to a 24-hour GP clinic in New Victoria Hospital in Glasgow on the night of 5 October 2015 and was diagnosed with \\"a virus\\" (unspecified) and sent home. 24 hours later she was admitted to Queen Elizabeth University Hospital where she was diagnosed with late complications caused by the Ebola virus hitherto considered unusual, and was flown by military jet to London, to the Royal Free Hospital. Her condition was initially described as serious and she was being treated in the high-level isolation unit. Doctors discovered that, after she had been deemed cured, the virus had remained in her cerebrospinal fluid and feared that it might be in her central nervous system. Personnel in Scotland monitored those whom she had come into contact with, since the virus can be spread through exposure to the infected person's body fluids, though they said the risk was likely to be small. Cafferkey's condition declined rapidly, and on 14 October 2015 she was reported to be critically ill. Five days later, on 19 October 2015, the Royal Free Hospital announced that: \\"Pauline Cafferkey's condition has improved to serious but stable\\". On 21 October 2015 Dr Michael Jacobs, Cafferkey's doctor at the Royal Free Hospital, said at a televised press conference that Cafferkey was suffering from neurological complications from meningitis caused by Ebola virus, and had not been re-infected with Ebola, was being treated using a highly experimental anti-viral agent called GS5734, and had significantly improved, although she remained in an isolation tent and was not well enough to get out of bed. On 12 November the Royal Free Hospital said that Cafferkey had made a full recovery and was no longer infectious. She was transferred to Glasgow's Queen Elizabeth University Hospital. 2016 readmissions  In February 2016, Cafferkey was admitted to Glasgow's Queen Elizabeth University Hospital after \\"routine monitoring by the Infectious Diseases Unit\\". On the same day she was transferred by a RAF plane to London where she was readmitted to the Royal Free Hospital. In a statement the Royal Free said she had been transferred to the hospital \\"due to a late complication from her previous infection by the Ebola virus\\" and that she was being treated by the hospital's infectious diseases team. On 24 February the hospital described her condition as \\"stable\\". On 28 February Cafferkey was discharged by the Royal Free Hospital. A spokesman said, \\"We can confirm that Pauline is not infectious. The Ebola virus can only be transmitted by direct contact with the blood or bodily fluids of an infected person while they are symptomatic.\\" On 6 October 2016 she was readmitted to the Queen Elizabeth University Hospital to be monitored by the infectious diseases team. A NHS Greater Glasgow and Clyde spokeswoman said that she was in a stable condition and undergoing investigations. In the evening of the same day a statement was issued stating that tests for the Ebola virus were negative.  Investigations  In 2014, due to the fact that Cafferkey had passed through border controls and travelled on a domestic flight from Heathrow to Glasgow, criticism was levelled at current screening protocols at UK points of entry, which mainly consisted of taking a person's temperature and asking a series of questions. Public Health England stated that they were planning a review of the screening procedures. In 2016, the Nursing and Midwifery Council initiated proceedings against Cafferkey, alleging that she had allowed an incorrect temperature to be recorded during the screening process upon returning to the UK from Sierra Leone in 2014. Following a two-day hearing in Edinburgh during September 2016, the charges against Cafferkey were dismissed and she was cleared of any wrongdoing. The disciplinary panel was told that she had been impaired by illness at the time and heard evidence about how the Public Health England screening centre at Heathrow Airport had been unprepared for a large influx of passengers and that it was \\"busy, disorganised and even chaotic\\". BBC Scotland reporter Philip Sim wrote: \\"It now seems as if the case against Pauline Cafferkey had fallen apart before the hearing even began - raising questions as to why she had to go through it in the first place\\". In November 2016, a second panel criticised fellow volunteer senior nurse Donna Wood for suggesting \\"let's put it down as 37.2 and get out of here and sort it out later\\". Wood was suspended for two months for failing to alert the authorities about Cafferkey's condition. Hannah Ryan, the doctor that agreed to record the incorrect temperature, was suspended for one month by the Medical Practitioners Tribunal in March 2017. Subsequent events In April 2017, Cafferkey announced she would return to Sierra Leone in May to raise funds for Ebola survivors and children orphaned by the disease. In June 2019, Cafferkey gave birth to twin sons in a hospital in Glasgow, at the age of 43. In a statement, she said \\"this shows that there is life after Ebola and there is a future for those who have encountered this disease\\".

History The drink bishop is of German origins and the name refers to the violet colour of a bishop's garments. The popularity of the punch led to the manufacturing of special punch bowls shaped in the form of a bishop's hat or later as a bishop. The first bishop-bowls in Denmark were produced at Store Kongensgade Faience Manufactury, Denmark's first faience manufacturer, that was founded in Copenhagen in 1722. The drink Christian VI (ruled until 1746) The basic ingredients of bishop are red wine, bitter orange and/or common orange (zest and juise)) and suga.

W. 1996. Niebla and Vermilacinia (Ramalinaceae) from California and Baja California. Sida Bot. Misc. 14 The epithet, laminaria is in reference to the thallus divided into blade-like branches similar to a genus of brown algae, Laminaria. Distinguishing Features Niebla laminaria is distinguished by the thallus divided into relatively few (10 or less) subterete branches with a common attachment base (or holdfast) and with various short marginal lobes or spine-like branchlets, to 7 cm high and 4 cm across. The species (N. laminaria) is also recognized by containing divaricatic acid, with triterpenes, and by a relatively thick cortex, 80‚Äì200 ¬µm thick covering a solid medulla, the cortex pale olive green to dark green, turning brown in the herbarium. Niebla laminaria appears to intergrade with Niebla testudinaria in the northern geographical range of the species, Niebla eburnea in the mid range, and Niebla juncosa var. spinulifera in the southern range. This variation might also be seen as variants of the other species, except that specimens from Punta Banda and San Nicolas Island are remarkably similar in their morphology and in their secondary metabolites.World Botanical Associates, Niebla laminaria, retrieved 26 Dec 2014, http://www.worldbotanical.com/niebla_laminaria.htm#laminaria This close morphological and chemical similarity between widely geographically separated individuals reinforces the recognition of N. laminaria as a distinct species as further exemplified in a genetic study of another fog lichen, Dendrographa leucophaea where thalli of D. leucophaea at Punta Banda and on San Nicolas Island, separated by water for a distance of 190 miles (Google Earth ruler), were found to be more genetically similar than to sterile and fertile forms of the same species growing next to each other.Lohtander, K., L. Myllys, R. Sundin, M. Kllersj, and A. Tehler. 1998. The species pair concept in the lichen Dendrographa leucophaea (Arthoniales): Analyses based on ITS Sequences. Bryologist 101: 404‚Äì411. which they may be regarded cryptic species of a species pair. The morphological differences between N. laminaria and other related species in the genus Niebla, are evident; however, instead of sterile and fertile species as reported for D. leucophaea, sibling species may be recognized by the secondary lichen substances.Culberson, W. L. 1986. Chemistry and sibling speciation in the lichen-forming fungi: Ecological and biological considerations. The Bryologist 89:123-131Niebla and Vermilacinia of Baja California, World Botanical Associates, retrieved 26 Dec 2014, http://www.worldbotanical.com/lichens.htm For example, Niebla cornea in southern California may be viewed by some as a sekikaic acid race of N. laminaria, or as a separate undescribed species, or under a very broad interpretation of a species (Niebla homalea) in which the variation in morphology is viewed as being environmentally induced and in chemistry as chemosyndrome variation.Bowler, P. and J. Marsh. 2004. Niebla. ‚ÄòLichen Flora of the Greater Sonoran Desert 2‚Äô: 368‚Äì380. Niebla laminaria as described above is defined by its morphology and by its secondary metabolites with emphasis placed on secondary metabolites, not an uncommon practice in taxonomic treatments of other lichen genera;Kalb, K. and J. A. Elix. 1995. The lichen genus Physcidio. In: Studies in lichenology with emphasis on chemotaxonomy, geography and phytochemistry Festschrift Ch. Leuckert Eds: Knoph, J.-G., Schriifer, K. & Sipman, H. J. M. - Bibliotheca Lichenologica 57:265 -296. J. Cramer in der Gebriider Borntraeger Verlagsbuchhandlung, Berlin-Stuttgd Niebla cornea (sekikaic acid) and N. laminaria (divaricatic acid) are best distinguished by their lichen substances when they cannot be easily differentiated morphologically. Taxonomic History Niebla laminaria was first recognized as part of a sample of Niebla homalea collected 29 April 1985 by Richard Spjut and Richard Marin on Punta Banda in Baja California for anti- HIV screening by the National Cancer Institute.Samples of lichens were collected during 1985 from the eastern and western regions of the United States and from Baja California, Mexico for the anti-HIV screening by the National Cancer Institute, Natural Products Branch. Prior to 1982, samples for the NCI plant screening program were supplied in 1 kilogram (kg) quantity (dried) by the USDA Agricultural Research Service. In October 1982, the funding for this cooperative agreement was terminated. World Botanical Associates (WBA) was formed by Richard Spjut in May 1983 to continue to supply samples for antitumor screening to university chemists and to the NCI. Lichens were considered a potential novel source for new anti-HIV drugs since they had rarely been collected for the NCI antitumor screening program. Richard Spjut, the Senior Partner of WBA, proposed that the NCI reduce their 1 kg quantity to 25 grams in order to obtain a broad diversity of lichen samples. The NCI group maintains an inventory of natural product extracts with details on the collection data. A 58 gram sample of Niebla homalea was submitted under the accession number WBA-277 Before submitting the sample on 2 Feb 1986, a thallus of Niebla laminaria (not yet described) was removed along with voucher specimens for N. homalea; the remaining material, 58 grams of N. homalea, was submitted to the NCI. The voucher specimen for N. homalea was deposited at the United States National Herbarium (Smithsonian Institution),United States National Herbarium, http://botany.si.edu/colls/collections_overview.htm Spjut & Marin 9032C. A thallus removed from the sample, Spjut & Marin 9032C3, is the holotype for N. laminaria. In collecting multiple thalli of a lichen species‚Äîfor biochemical screening‚Äîsuch as in the genus Niebla, it can be a challenge to obtain uniform morphological and chemical thalli as a taxonomic sample. Under a very broad species concept (Niebla homalea); one that essentially recognizes only two species in the genus Niebla, this would be less of a problem, in contrast to a narrow species concept where Niebla is defined by the two-layered cortex, the isolated chondroid strands in the medulla, and by the lichen substances lacking the terpenes found in Vermilacinia.Spjut R.

The Augustinian Order were granted custody of the image for sometime,http://www.retrato.com.ph/photodtl.asp?id=SC02524 until the 1945 Battle of Manila, when it was considered lost and surfaced under private ownership. Records of ownership also trace that the image was once venerated in the Minor Basilica of Saint Lorenzo Ru√≠z de Manila, while another theory holds that the Tuason clan once purchased the image, most notably Don Antonio Tuason, who had a particular preference for colonial fine art. Present ownership The image formerly participated in the annual Grand Marian Procession at Manila Cathedral in Intramuros as late as December 1981. In later years, the image was returned to its original custodian, and was last seen in the private living room of Imelda Marcos during a television interview by ABS-CBN. It is now under another private ownership. As of 2015, the image no longer participates in public processions due to its extreme fragility and value.

It borders Bori to the north, Opobo to the east, Ngo to the south, and Bonny and the Kalabari Kingdom to the west.  City  Asarama is a city located in Rivers State, southern Nigeria. It is one of the largest and most populated cities in the Andoni Local Government Area. Asarama was formed from an amalgamation of many villages, including Egwebe (the largest and most populated), Egwe-Aja, Egwe- Ewaye (Royal Village) Egwe-Idake, Egwe-Esu, Asuk, and Ikpak. Other villages include Iyong-Orong, Asarama-Ija, Iwoma-Asarama, Asalakiri, Agbaokwan-Asarama 1 to 15, Uja-Ama, and Asarama-Toru. The Egwebe village square is in the heart of Asalakiri. However, since these villages have over a thousand years of ongoing mutual relationships, they cannot be differentiated. Egwe-Ewaya (Ewaye, for short) is the only village that produces the King [citation needed]. Others do contribute when it comes to religious, socio-cultural, and war activities.  History  The Andoni resides in present-day Rivers and Awka-Ibom States. Based on the evidence from traditional history, the Andoni are descended from Ayama, the Son of Tara (Tarakiri), who was left with Kala- Okun at Igbedi creek. The migrating ancestors are mentioned as Asara or Asa founder of Asarama, Ifop, Edeh or Edabiri, Alama, and Abah, to name a few. They left Igbedi creek area at an early stage, taking with them the title \\\\\\"Indo Oru\\\\\\" which they remembered and gave to their priest rulers. The title \\\\\\"Indo Oru\\\\\\" was subsequently corrupted to \\\\\\"Ando Oru\\\\,\\" and then during their sojourn, this term was altered to \\\\\\"Andoni Oru\\\\\\\\.\\" Leaving the central delta, the early ancestors made their way through creeks and swamps, cutting down trees to cross the water waves. They first encamped for some time in the southeastern region before moving into the delta. Their first settlement was called Ayama, after their ancestor. The site of Ayama was the site of Peterside in Ibani or Bonny town. They stayed here for centuries manufacturing salt for the interior markets before moving. It was from Ayama that Asarama (i.e., Asara\\\\'s town) was founded. A second group moved on to the southern Cameroons and Calabar region. It was here that they intermarried with Bantu- speaking people. In approximately the 12th century AD, these Andoni made a return journey into the Niger Delta and settled at Egwede, where they sited their national emblem, called Oyobolo (Obolo). Further migration patterns were caused by the repeating conflicts with the Ibani (Beni or Bonny to Europeans), as a result of the slave-raiding confusion of those times. From the site of Peterside, they moved eastwards to the Rio Real, then to Asarama-Toru, then further east to Okoma, the site opposite the present town. The old settlement was the site of Peterside in Bonny, which was called Ayama (or old Asarama), Asarama being the oldest of the Andoni towns. Other Andoni towns include Ayangala, while Alabie was the other name for Egwede. In the 1940s, the chief title of the Andoni native court judge was still Andoni Oru, acknowledging the ancestral connection to Indo-Oru (the original title of father Ujo the ancestor of Ijo people). The Andoni no longer speak the original Ijo language. The foundation of Andoni was between the 10th and 12th century AD.  Social life  The majority of Asarama people are highly social and religious. They are predominantly traditional [more info here] worshipers as well as Christians. Approximately 40 years ago [from what date?], many fetish and cultural play/events were introduced to Asarama society,though currently, the only fetish-related, dangerous and frightening play is the Efie-okpo, which is played at night between the hours of 9pm and 4am in September every year. Two others in this tradition are called Nwantam and Okekpe. Though the Okekpe is a little more terrifying, strangers can join in the performance with indigenous players; and the Nwantam is open to general participation. Most Christians believe that these activities are for the indigenous deities and should not be performed at all. The Ofio-okpo [check spelling - 3 versions] is never and can never be seen with eyes unless you are a member of this social group; thus it is seen as an occult and devilish organization. According to the members, those who set eyes on it will die if they are not members, but people find pleasure in listening to the songs and instrumental beats coming from the masquerade. The youths felt that these plays were too traditional for them, and therefore introduced aspects of western culture to the town. The arrangement of the events now include: Nwantam (1st of January), Beach Party (2nd of January), Okekpe (3rd of January) and Ofiokpo (three days in September). Aside from these, there are other events which happen within the year at least every three months, as the Asarama people return home with friends from all walks of life bringing new ideas for partying, clubbing, marriages and wedding ceremonies, chieftaincy installations, burial ceremonies and other cultural activities. These activities sometimes blend with the quarterly events which the Asarama people called Otayan (ending of moon or months). The first Otayan is from the last week of March to the first week of April; the second quarter is the last week of June to the first week of July; the third quarter is the last week of September to the first week of October; and the final quarter goes from the last week of December to as long as anyone can survive the revelry in January, which then coincides with the New Year celebrations. The Asarama people rarely celebrate Christmas at home, though they will observe the season with friends who visit them or if they visit friends outside Asarama.  Geography  Asarama lies at a latitude of 4.5323100 and longitude of 7.4408400. It has an elevation of 9 meters above sea level. It borders Egendem to the west and Opobo to the east, Ogoni to its north, and Ebuguma to its south. It is a few miles away from the Atlantic Ocean.

The term was first used to denote a method that combined a tuneable free electron laser with an atomic force microscope (a type of SPM) equipped with a sharp probe that measured the local absorption of infrared light by a sample; it required that the sample be coupled to an infrared-transparent prism and be less than 1Œºm thick. It improved the spatial resolution of photothermal AFM-based techniques from microns to circa 100 nm. Recording the amount of infrared absorption as a function of wavelength or wavenumber creates an infrared absorption spectra that can be used to chemically characterize and even identify unknown materials. Recording the infrared absorption as a function of position can be used to create chemical composition maps that show the spatial distribution of different chemical components. Novel extensions of the original AFM-IR technique and earlier techniques have enabled the development of bench-top devices capable of nanometer spatial resolution, that do not require a prism and can work with thicker samples, and thereby greatly improving ease of use and expanding the range of samples that can be analysed. One of these techniques has achieved spatial resolutions down to around 20 nm, with a sensitivity down to the scale of molecular monolayer AFM-IR is related to techniques such as tip-enhanced Raman spectroscopy (TERS), scanning near-field optical microscopy (SNOM), nano-FTIR and other methods of vibrational analysis with scanning probe microscopy. History Atomic force microscope inside a FTIR spectrometer with the optical interface Fourier transform infrared spectrometer Left: The original AFM-IR configuration with bottom side illumination and the sample mounted on an infrared-transparent prism. Right: Topside illumination, enabling sample measurements on arbitrary substratesThe earliest measurements combining AFM with infrared spectroscopy were performed in 1999 by Hammiche et al. at the University of Lancaster in the United Kingdom, in an EPSRC-funded project led by M Reading and H M Pollock. Separately, Anderson at the Jet Propulsion Laboratory in the United States made a related measurement in 2000. Both groups used a conventional Fourier transform infrared spectrometer (FTIR) equipped with a broadband thermal source, the radiation was focused near the tip of a probe that was in contact with a sample. The Lancaster group obtained spectra by detecting the absorption of infrared radiation using a temperature sensitive thermal probe. Anderson took the different approach of using a conventional AFM probe to detect the thermal expansion. He reported an interferogram but not a spectrum; the first infrared spectrum obtained in this way was reported by Hammiche et al. in 2004: this represented the first proof that spectral information about a sample could be obtained using this approach. Both of these early experiments used a broadband source in conjunction with an interferometer; these techniques could, therefore, be referred to as AFM-FTIR although Hammiche et al. coined the more general term photothermal microspectroscopy or PTMS in their first paper. PTMS has various subgroups; including techniques that measure temperature measure thermal expansion use broadband sources. use lasers excite the sample using evanescent waves, illuminate the sample directly from above etc. and different combinations of these. Fundamentally, they all exploit the photothermal effect. Different combinations of sources, methods, methods of detection and methods of illumination have benefits for different applications. Care should be taken to ensure that it is clear which form of PTMS is being used in each case. Currently there is no universally accepted nomenclature. The original technique dubbed AFM-IR that induced resonant motion in the probe using a Free Electron Laser has developed by exploiting the foregoing permutations so that it has evolved into various forms. The pioneering experiments of Hammiche et al and Anderson had limited spatial resolution due to thermal diffusion - the spreading of heat away from the region where the infrared light was absorbed. The thermal diffusion length (the distance the heat spreads) is inversely proportional to the root of the modulation frequency. Consequently, the spatial resolution achieved by the early AFM-IR approaches was around one micron or more, due to the low modulation frequencies of the incident radiation created by the movement of the mirror in the interferometer. Also, the first thermal probes were Wollaston wire devices that were developed originally for Microthermal analysis (in fact PTMS was originally considered to be one of a family of microthermal techniques). The comparatively large size of these probes also limited spatial resolution. Bozec et al. and Reading et al. used thermal probes with nanoscale dimensions and demonstrated higher spatial resolution. Ye et al described a MEM-type thermal probe giving sub-100 nm spatial resolution, which they used for nanothermal analysis. The process of exploring laser sources began in 2001 by Hammiche et al when they acquired the first spectrum using a tuneable laser (see Resolution improvement with pulsed laser source). A significant development was the creation by Reading et al. in 2001 of a custom interface that allowed measurements to be made while illuminating the sample from above; this interface focused the infrared beam to a spot of circa 500Œºm diameter, close to the theoretical maximum. The use of top-down or top-side illumination has the important benefit that samples of arbitrary thickness can be studied on arbitrary substrates. In many cases this can be done without any sample preparation. All subsequent experiments by Hammiche, Pollock, Reading and their co-workers were made using this type of interface including the instrument constructed by Hill et al. for nanoscale imaging using a pulsed laser. The work of the University of Lancaster group in collaboration with workers from the University of East Anglia led to the formation of a company, Anasys Instruments, to exploit this and related technologies (see Commercialization). Resolution improvement with pulsed laser sources An infrared optical parametric oscillator (OPO), 1997 OPO light source constructed at the University of East Anglia by Hill et al in 2007 In the first paper on AFM-based infrared by Hammiche et al., the relevant well-established theoretical considerations were outlined that predict that high spatial resolution can be achieved using rapid modulation frequencies because of the consequent reduction in the thermal diffusion length. They estimated that spatial resolutions in the range of 20 nm-30 nm should be achievable. The most readily available sources that can achieve high modulation frequencies are pulsed lasers: even when the rapidity of the pulses is not high, the square wave form of a pulse contains very high modulation frequencies in Fourier space. In 2001, Hammiche et al. used a type of bench- top tuneable, pulsed infrared laser known as an optical parametric oscillator or OPO and obtained the first probe-based infrared spectrum with a pulsed laser, however, they did not report any images Nanoscale spatial resolution AFM-IR imaging using a pulsed laser was first demonstrated by Dazzi et al at the University of Paris-Sud, France. Dazzi and his colleagues used a wavelength-tuneable, free electron laser at the CLIO facilityCentre Laser Infrarouge d'Orsay, Orsay Infrared Laser Centre in Orsay, France to provide an infrared source with short pulses. Like earlier workers, they used a conventional AFM probe to measure thermal expansion but introduced a novel optical configuration: the sample was mounted on an IR-transparent prism so that it could be excited by an evanescent wave. Absorption of short infrared laser pulses by the sample caused rapid thermal expansion that created a force impulse at the tip of the AFM cantilever. The thermal expansion pulse induced transient resonant oscillations of the AFM cantilever probe. This has led to the technique being dubbed Photo-Thermal Induced Resonance (PTIR), by some workers in the field. Some prefer the terms PTIR or PTMS to AFM-IR as the technique is not necessarily restricted to infrared wavelengths. The amplitude of the cantilever oscillation is directly related to the amount of infrared radiation absorbed by the sample. By measuring the cantilever oscillation amplitude as a function of wavenumber, Dazzi's group was able to obtain absorption spectra from nanoscale regions of the sample. Compared to earlier work, this approach improved spatial resolution because the use of short laser pulses reduced the duration of the thermal expansion pulse to the point that the thermal diffusion lengths can be on the scale of nanometres rather than microns. A key advantage of the use of a tuneable laser source, with a narrow wavelength range, is the ability to rapidly map the locations of specific chemical components on the sample surface. To achieve this, Dazzi's group tuned their free electron laser source to a wavelength corresponding to the molecular vibration of the chemical of interest, then mapped the cantilever oscillation amplitude as function of position across the sample. They demonstrated the ability to map chemical composition in E. coli bacteria. They could also visualize polyhydroxybutyrate (PHB) vesicles inside Rhodobacter capsulatus cells and monitor the efficiency of PHB production by the cells. At the University of East Anglia in the UK, as part of an EPSRC-funded project led by M. Reading and S. Meech, Hill and his co-workers followed the earlier work of Reading et al. and Hammiche et al. and measured thermal expansion using an optical configuration that illuminated the sample from above in contrast to Dazzi et al. who excited the sample with an evanescent wave from below. Hill also made use of an optical parametric oscillator as the infrared source in the manner of Hammiche et al. This novel combination of topside illumination, OPO source and measuring thermal expansion proved capable of nanoscale spatial resolution for infrared imaging and spectroscopy (the figures show a schematic of the UEA apparatus and results obtained with it). The use by Hill and co-workers of illumination from above allowed a substantially wider range of samples to be studied than was possible using Dazzi's technique. By introducing the use of a bench top IR source and topdown illumination, the work of Hammiche, Hill and their coworkers made possible the first commercially viable SPM-based infrared instrument (see Commercialization). Commercialization The free-electron laser FELIX at the FOM Institute for Plasma Physics Rijnhuizen Nieuwegein, The Netherlands (2010); a large and uncommon piece of equipment The AFM-IR technique based on a pulsed infrared laser source was commercialized by Anasys Instruments, a company founded by Reading, Hammiche and Pollock in the United Kingdom in 2004; a sister, United States corporation was founded a year later. Anasys Instruments developed its product with support from the National Institute of Standards and Technology and the National Science Foundation. Since free electron lasers are rare and available only at select institutions, a key to enabling a commercial AFM-IR was to replace them with a more compact type of infrared source. Following the lead given by Hammiche et al in 2001 and Hill et al in 2008, Anasys Instruments introduced an AFM-IR product in early 2010, using a tabletop laser source based on a nanosecond optical parametric oscillator. The OPO source enabled nanoscale infrared spectroscopy over a tuning range of roughly 1000‚Äì4000 cm‚àí1 or 2.5-10 Œºm. The initial product required samples to be mounted on infrared-transparent prisms, with the infrared light being directed from below in the manner of Dazzi et al.An arrangement is similar to attenuated total reflectance (ATR) schemes used in conventional infrared spectroscopy For best operation, this illumination scheme required thin samples, with optimal thickness of less than 1 Œºm, prepared on the surface of the prism. In 2013, Anasys released an AFM-IR instrument based on the work of Hill et al. that supported top-side illumination. \\"By eliminating the need to prepare samples on infrared-transparent prisms and relaxing the restriction on sample thickness, the range of samples that could be studied was greatly expanded. The CEO of Anasys Instruments recognised this achievement by calling it \\" an exciting major advance\\" in a letter written to the university and included in the final report of EPSRC project EP/C007751/1. The UEA technique went on to become Anasys Instruments' flagship product. Comparison of AFM-IR with related photo-thermal techniques It is worth noting that the first infrared spectrum obtained by measuring thermal expansion using an AFM was obtained by Hammiche and co-workers without inducing resonant motions in the probe cantilever. In this early example the modulation frequency was too low to achieve high spatial resolution but there is nothing, in principle, preventing the measurement of thermal expansion at higher frequencies without analysing or inducing resonant behaviour. Possible options for measuring the displacement of the tip rather than the subsequent propagation of waves along the cantilever include; interferometry focused at the end of the cantilever where the tip is located, a torsional motion resulting from an offset probe (it would only be influenced by the motions of the cantilever as a second order effect) and exploiting the fact that the signal from a heated thermal probe is strongly influenced by the position of the tip relative to the surface thus this could provide a measurement of thermal expansion that wasn‚Äôt strongly influenced by or dependent upon resonance. The advantages of a non-resonant method of detection is that any frequency of light modulation could be used thus depth information could be obtained in a controlled way (see below) whereas methods that rely on resonance are limited to harmonics. The thermal-probe based method of Hammiche et al. has found a significant number of applications. A unique application made possible by the top-down illumination combined with a thermal probe is localized depth profiling, this is not possible using either using the Dazzi et al. configuration of AFM-IR or that of Hill et al. despite the fact the latter uses top-down illumination. Obtaining linescans and images with thermal probes has been shown to be possible, sub-diffraction limit spatial resolution can be achieved and the resolution for delineating boundaries can be enhanced using chemometric techniques. In all of these examples a spectrum is acquired that spans the entire mid-IR range for each pixel, this is considerably more powerful than measuring the absorption of a single wavelength as is the case for AFM-IR when using either the method of Dazzi et al. or Hill et al. Reading and his group demonstrated how, because thermal probes can be heated, localized thermal analysis can be combined with photothermal infrared spectroscopy using a single probe. In this way local chemical information could be complemented with local physical properties such melting and glass transition temperatures. This in turn led to the concept of thermally assisted nanosampling, where the heated tip performs a local thermal analysis experiment then the probe is retracted taking with it down to femtogramsOne femtogram is 10‚àí15 grammes of softened material that adhere to the tip. This material can then be manipulated and/or analysed by photothermal infrared spectroscopy or other techniques.; 354(1-2)149-5. This considerably increases the analytical power of this type of SPM-based infrared instrument beyond anything that can be achieved with conventional AFM probes such as those used in AFM-IR when using either the Dazzi et al. or the Hill et al. version. Thermal probe techniques have still not achieved the nanoscale spatial resolution that thermal expansion methods have attained though this is theoretically possible. For this, a robust thermal probe and a high intensity source is needed. Recently, the first images using a QCL and a thermal probe have been obtained by Reading et al.30 March-1 April 2015 A good signal to noise ratio enabled rapid imaging but sub-micron spatial resolution was not clearly demonstrated. Theory predicts improvements in spatial resolution could be achieved by confining data analysis to the early part of the thermal response to a step change increase in the intensity of the incident radiation. In this way pollution of the measurement from adjacent regions would be avoided, i.e. the measurement window could be confined to a suitable fraction of the time of flight of the thermal wave (using a Fourier analysis of the response could provide a similar outcome by using the high frequency components). This could be achieved by tapping the probe in synchrony with the laser. Similarly, lasers that provide very rapid modulations could further reduce thermal diffusion lengths. Although most effort to date has been focused on thermal expansion measurements, this might change. Truly robust thermal probes have recently become available, as have affordable compact QCL‚Äôs that are tuneable over a broad frequency range. Consequently, it may soon be the case that thermal probe techniques will become as widely used as those based on thermal expansion. Ultimately, instruments that can easily switch between modes and even combine them using a single probe will certainly become available, for example, a single probe will eventually be able to measure both temperature and thermal expansion. Recent improvements in AFM- IR The original commercial AFM-IR instruments required most samples to be thicker than 50 nm to achieve sufficient sensitivity. Sensitivity improvements were achieved using specialized cantilever probes with an internal resonator[ 185705 and by wavelet based signal processing techniques.444007 Sensitivity was further improved by Lu et al. by using quantum cascade laser (QCL) sources. The high repetition rate of the QCL allows absorbed infrared light to continuously excite the AFM tip at a \\"contact resonance\\"A contact resonance is a vibrational resonance frequency of an AFM cantilever that occurs when the tip of the AFM is in contact with a sample surface. When the QCL is pulsed synchronously with a contact resonance, the detection of the thermal expansion of the sample from infrared absorption is amplified by the quality factor Q of the contact resonance. of the AFM cantilever. This resonance-enhanced AFM-IR, in combination with electric field enhancement from metallic tips and substrates led to the demonstration of AFM-IR spectroscopy and compositional imaging of films as thin as single self-assembled monolayers. The AFM-IR has also been integrated with other sources including a picosecond OPO offering a tuning range 1.55 Œºm to 16 Œºm (from 6450 cm‚àí1 to 625 cm‚àí1). Nanospectroscopy AFM-IR enables nanoscale infrared spectroscopy, i.e. the ability to obtain infrared absorption spectra from nanoscale regions of a sample. Chemical compositional mapping AFM-IR can also be used to perform chemical imaging or compositional mapping with spatial resolution down to ~20 nm, limited only by the radius of the AFM tip. In this case, the tuneable infrared source emits a single wavelength, corresponding to a specific molecular resonance, i.e. a specific infrared absorption band. By mapping the AFM cantilever oscillation amplitude as a function of position, it is possible to map out the distribution of specific chemical components. Compositional maps can be made at different absorption bands to reveal the distribution of difference chemical species. Complementary mechanical mapping Complementary elasticity mapping via simultaneous contact resonance measurements. The AFM-IR technique can simultaneously provide complementary measurements of the mechanical stiffness and dissipation of a sample surface. When infrared light is absorbed by the sample the resulting rapid thermal expansion excites a \\"contact resonance\\" of the AFM cantilever, i.e. a coupled resonance resulting from the properties of both the cantilever and the stiffness and damping of the sample surface. Specifically, the resonance frequency shifts to higher frequencies for stiffer materials and to lower frequencies for softer material. Additionally, the resonance becomes broader for materials with larger dissipation. These contact resonances have been studied extensively by the AFM community (see, for example, atomic force acoustic microscopy). Traditional contact resonance AFM requires an external actuator to excite the cantilever contact resonances. In AFM-IR these contact resonances are automatically excited every time an infrared pulse is absorbed by the sample. So the AFM-IR technique can measure the infrared absorption by the amplitude of the cantilever oscillation response and the mechanical properties of the sample via the contact resonance frequency and quality factor. Broadband pulsed laser sources Reading et al. have explored the use of a broadband QCL combined with thermal expansion measurements. Above, the inability of thermal broadband sources to achieve high spatial resolution is discussed (see history). In this case the frequency of modulation is limited by the mirror speed of the interferometer which, in turn, limits the lateral spatial resolution that can be achieved. When using a broadband QCL the resolution is limited not by the mirror speed but by the modulation frequency of the laser pulses (or other waveforms). The benefit of using a broadband source is that an image can be acquired that comprises an entire spectrum or part of a spectrum for each pixel. This is much more powerful than acquiring images bases on a single wavelength. The preliminary results of Reading et al. show that directing a broadband QCL though an interferometer can give an easily detectable response from a conventional AFM probe measuring thermal expansion. Applications Applications of AFM-IR have included polymers, composites, bacteria, cells, biominerals, pharmaceutical sciences, photonics/nanoantennas,217404 fuel cells, fibers, skin hair, metal organic frameworks, microdroplets self-assembled monolayers, nanocrystals, and semiconductors. Polymers blends, composites, multilayer films and fibers AFM- IR has been used to identify and map polymer components in blends, characterize interfaces in composites, and even reverse engineer multilayer films Additionally AFM-IR has been used to study chemical composition in Poly(3][4-ethylenedioxythiophene) (PEDOT) conducting polymers. and vapor infiltration into polyethylene terephthalate PET fibers. Life sciences AFM-IR has been used to spectroscopically characterize infection of bacteria by viruses (Bacteriophages), and also the production of polyhydroxybutyrate (PHB) vesicles inside Rhodobacter capsulatus cells and triglycerides in Streptomyces bacteria (for biofuel applications). AFM-IR has also been used to evaluate and map mineral content, crystallinity, collagen maturity and acid phosphate content via ratiometric analysis of various absorption bands in bone AFM-IR has also been used to perform spectroscopy and chemical mapping of structural lipids in human skin and hair Fuel cells AFM-IR has been used to study hydrated Nafion membranes used as separators in fuel cells.

Photonic nanoantennas AFM-IR has been used to study the surface plasmon resonance in heavily silicon-doped indium arsenide microparticles. Gold split ring resonators have been studied for use with Surface-Enhanced Infrared Absorption Spectroscopy. In this case AFM-IR was used to measure the local field enhancement of the plasmonics structures (~30X) at 100 nm spatial resolution.\\"Nanoscale Infrared Spectroscopy of Polymer Composites\\", americanlaboratory.com Pharmaceutical sciences AFM- IR has been used to study miscibility and phase separation in drug polymer blends, as well as the chemical analysis of nanocrystalline drug particles as small 90 nm across.

His academic achievements were noted by members of the \\"Diputaci√≥n Provincial de C√≥rdoba\\" (the regional government) who granted him a scholarship so he could continue his studies at the Real Academia de Bellas Artes de San Fernando until 1890, when he had his first showing at the National Exhibition of Fine Arts with \\"The Castaway\\", which was done so realistically that some jurors suspected it of having been cast from life. Reverie Between 1891 and 1901, he lived in the countryside, oblivious to critics and the public, becoming established as a teacher and art restorer. His many projects included the Mosque‚ÄìCathedral of C√≥rdoba and the Medina Azahara. During these years, his work took on greater simplicity and he always spoke of himself as having been self-taught. He produced mostly religious and commemorative sculptures, in C√≥rdoba and Madrid, receiving many commissions to create monuments for local and national celebrities, many of which were not erected. Eventually, he became a Professor of modelling and figure drawing at the \\"Escuela Municipal de Artes y Oficios\\" (Arts & Crafts) in C√≥rdoba and, in 1901, was appointed Director. From 1905, he was occasionally a member of the jury at the National Exhibition. Monument to the Gran Capit√°n In 1911, he was named Professor of modelling and casting at the \\"Escuela de Artes y Oficios\\" in Madrid. Now that he was in the capital, he was able to make more connections to promote his work and he concentrated on his preferred theme; idealizing the nude female form. He obtained the Gold Medal at the National Exhibition in 1920 and, two years later, became an Academician at the Real Academia de Bellas Artes de San Fernando. He died suddenly in 1924. An art school and a major street in C√≥rdoba have been named after him.

He reigned from 1347 to 1365; however, Sakya lost its influence in Central Tibet in 1354. In that way he was the last Sakya lord before the ascension of the new Phagmodrupa Dynasty. Sakya loss of influence Since the 13th century the elite of the Sakya Monastery had been the instruments of the Mongol Yuan emperors based in northern China. However, with the decline of Mongol rule the Yuan court had less resources to monitor Tibetan affairs. This coincided with the split of the ruling Khon family of Sakya into four branches which were sometimes at odds. After the abdication of the learned Lama Dampa Sonam Gyaltsen in 1347, his 15-year-old nephew Lotro Gyaltsen was enthroned as the new dansa chenpo (abbot-ruler).Luciano Petech, Central Tibet and the Mongols: The Y√ºan-Sa-skya period of Tibetan history. Rome 1990, p. 81, 101. Lotro Gyaltsen was the son of the tishri (imperial preceptor) Kunga Gyaltsen (1310-1358) and the sister of the lama Kunpangpa.Shoju Inaba, 'The lineage of the Sa skya pa: A chapter of the Red Annals', Memoirs of the Research Department of the Toyo Bunko 22 1963, pp. 110-1. The daily affairs of Tibet were handled by an administrator, dpon-chen or ponchen, who was also stationed in Sakya. During the era of Lotro Gyaltsen the holders of the office were Wangtson (1347-c. 1350), Gyalwa Zangpo (c. 1350-1356/58), Namkha Tenpai Gyaltsen (c. 1357 and c. 1364) and Palbum (?-1360).Luciano Petech 1990, p. 145. Phagmodrupa victory Meanwhile, Phagmodru, one of the 13 myriarchies (trikor) of Central Tibet, had become an increasingly assertive force under its energetic leader Changchub Gyaltsen.Olaf Czaja, Medieval rule in Tibet. Wien 2013, Vol. 1, pp. 114-29. Changchub Gyaltsen was imprisoned by the dpon- chen Gyalwa Zangpo in 1346, but was released in the next year since Gyalwa Zangpo felt discontented with being replaced by Wangtson and wanted a strong ally. During the next years Changchub Gyaltsen fought Wangtson and various local regimes in Central Tibet with relative success. The young Lotro Gyaltsen had little influence on these events, and negotiations with Phagmodru were partly managed by his uncle and predecessor Lama Dampa Sonam Gyaltsen.Luciano Petech 1990, pp. 102-14. In about 1350 Changchub Gyaltsen had become the dominating power in √ú (East Central Tibet).Olaf Czaja 2013, pp. 132-41. In 1354 the current dpon-chen Gyalwa Zangpo called on Changchub Gyaltsen to save Sakya from the Nangpa clan. The Phagmodru forces intervened successfully, and from this time the power of Sakya was restricted to its own estate.Luciano Petech 1990, pp. 117-9. Moreover, there was internal strife in Sakya which eventually led to the murder of the influential lama Kunpangpa, uncle of Lotro Gyaltsen, in 1357. This was followed by the sudden demise of the dpon-chen Gyalwa Zangpo, possibly through foul play. Changchub Gyaltsen, who meanwhile received the title Tai Situ from the Mongol ruler Toghon Tem√ºr, now settled the affairs of the incapacitated Sakya and installed a garrison there. A scion of the Khon family called Kunga Rinchen was reportedly appointed abbot of the main Sakya palace Zhitog. Other information implies that Lotro Gyaltsen remained abbot until his death in 1365. Whatever the case, Changchub Gyaltsen ruthlessly crushed the last resistance by the ex-dpon-chen Wangtson in 1358 and was established as regent of entire Central Tibet (√ú-Tsang).Luciano Petech 1990, pp. 125-7.

The fortifications were built over thousands of years, from around 1450 BC to the mid-20th century, and they are a result of the Maltese islands' strategic position and natural harbours, which have made them very desirable for various powers. The earliest known fortifications in Malta are defensive walls built around Bronze Age settlements. The Phoenicians, Romans and Byzantines built a number of defensive walls around important settlements, but very little remains of these survive today. By the late medieval period, the main fortifications on Malta were the capital Mdina, the Cittadella on Gozo, the Castrum Maris and a few coastal towers or lookout posts. The fortifications of Malta were greatly improved while the islands were ruled by the Order of St. John between 1530 and 1798. The Hospitallers built new bastioned fortifications, such as the fortifications of Birgu and Valletta, and upgraded the medieval defences. By the end of the 18th century, Malta had extensive fortifications around the Grand Harbour and Marsamxett, as well as a coastal defence system consisting of towers, batteries, redoubts and entrenchments. Following a brief French occupation, the islands fell under British rule in 1800. Between the 1870s and the 1900s a number of polygonal forts and batteries were built around Malta's coastline and along the Great Fault. In the 1930s and 1940s, Fort Campbell, a series of pillboxes and a number of anti-aircraft batteries were constructed, and these were the last fortifications to be built in Malta. Malta's fortifications are considered to be among the best examples of military architecture anywhere in the world. Major General Whitworth Porter of the Royal Engineers, called Malta \\"the most powerful artificial fortress in the world\\" in his 1858 book A History of the Fortress of Malta. In his 1893 book The Story of Malta, Maturin Murray Ballou wrote that \\"there is not a more complete system of fortifications extant, in any part of the world, than the cordon of defensive structures at Malta.\\" The British architect Quentin Hughes referred to Malta's fortifications as \\"for sheer concentration and majesty quite unmatched\\", while judge and historian Giovanni Bonello said that \\"nowhere in the world are fortifications more extensive, more impressive, more outstanding than they are in Malta.\\" Ancient and Medieval fortifications (pre-1530) Bronze Age defensive wall at Borƒ° in-Nadur The first fortifications in Malta were built during the Bronze Age. At least six sites have been identified as possible fortified settlements. The best preserved of these is the village of Borƒ° in-Nadur, close to the modern town of Bir≈ºebbuƒ°a. Around 1450 BC, the inhabitants of the village built a 4.5m high D-shaped bastion to bar access to their village. The wall was built facing inland, showing that the people living in the village were more afraid of attacks from the land than from the sea. In around 700 BC, the Phoenicians founded and fortified the city of Maleth on one of the highest points of the island, far away from the sea. Eventually the city was taken over by the Roman Empire and it was renamed Melite. The city was again renamed Medina by the Arabs which led to its present name Mdina. Its fortifications were modified a number of times over time, and although most were dismantled and rebuilt between the 16th and 18th centuries, some foundations of the ancient Punic-Roman ramparts, as well as various medieval remains, were recently discovered during excavations. The remains of several round towers have been found in Malta, and they are believed to date back to the late Punic or Roman periods. It is possible that these were used as watchtowers, but some historians dispute this since their locations do not really make sense in defensive systems. According to Al-Himyarƒ´, when the Arabs captured Malta in 870 AD, they besieged, captured, sacked and dismantled a fortress. The northern walls of the Cittadella were built in the 15th century By 1241, the Gran Castello or Cittadella on Gozo was definitely fortified, although a settlement on the hill had existed since the Bronze Age. The city's fortifications were improved over the years, and the northern walls of the city that still stand today were built around the 15th century by the Crown of Aragon. The Castrum Maris was built sometime in the Middle Ages. The castle definitely existed by the 13th century, and it was involved in the Battle of Malta of 1283. By the early 16th century, it belonged to the de Nava family. In 1417, the local militia had at least 24 watch posts around the Maltese islands, and in some cases there might have been fortified coastal watchtowers at these posts.https://www.um.edu.mt/library/oar/bitstream/123456789/41351/1/Fortifications%20in%20the%20Middle%20Ages.pdf One of these towers is known to have been built at St Elmo Point on the Sciberras Peninsula by the Aragonese in 1488. Hospitaller fortifications (1530‚Äì1798) Harbour area Seaward fortifications of Senglea In 1530, the Maltese islands along with the North African port city of Tripoli were given to the Order of Saint John by Emperor Charles V. The knights settled in the town of Birgu and made it their capital. Soon after their arrival, the Order rebuilt the Castrum Maris, calling it Fort Saint Angelo. Later on, the entire town of Birgu began to be surrounded by new fortifications, in a similar style to the Order's earlier defences in Rhodes. Birgu's land front was built by 1540. Following the attack of 1551, the Order realised the need to build more defences. Two forts were built in 1552: Fort Saint Elmo at the tip of the Sciberras Peninsula, on the site of an Aragonese watchtower, and Fort Saint Michael on Isola. In 1553, a new fortified city began to be built around Fort Saint Michael, and it was named Senglea after the Grand Master who built it. Saint Andrew's Bastion in Valletta In 1565, the Ottomans attacked again in the Great Siege of Malta. Fort Saint Elmo fell after fierce fighting (in which the Ottoman general Dragut Reis was killed), but the knights held out in Birgu and Senglea until a relief force arrived. By the end of the siege, most of the fortifications had been destroyed in the attacks, so they were rebuilt. The Grand Master, Jean Parisot de Valette, decided to build a new fortified capital on the Sciberras Peninsula. The first stone of the new city was laid down in 1566, and it was called Valletta. The city walls, which were constructed mainly in the 1560s and 1570s, remain largely intact to this day, and they include bastions, cavaliers, counterguards and a ditch. The ruined Fort Saint Elmo was rebuilt and integrated into the city walls. The area around St Elmo was strengthened a number of times later on in the 17th century, especially by the building of the Carafa Enceinte in 1687. San Salvatore Bastion and Counterguard, part of the Floriana Lines With the development of new technologies, by the 17th century it was realised that while Valletta's fortifications were well designed, they were not strong enough to withstand a heavy attack. Because of this, the Floriana Lines, encircling Valletta's original land front, were built from 1635 to the 1640s. In the 18th century, a suburb developed between the Floriana Lines and Valletta's land front, and it became known as Floriana, today a town in its own right. In 1638, the Santa Margherita Lines began to be built encircling the land fronts of Birgu and Sengela. Works were suspended in 1645 due to a lack of funds, and they remained unfinished for many years. Following the fall of Candia to the Ottomans in 1669, a second line of fortifications, the Cottonera Lines, began to be built encircling both Birgu and Senglea, as well as the unfinished Santa Margherita Lines. They were begun in 1670, but works stopped in 1680 again due to a lack of funds. By this time, the bastioned enceinte had been built, although other crucial parts had not yet been constructed. Eventually, some effort was done to complete both the Santa Margherita and Cottonera Lines in the early 18th century, although some of the planned ravelins, cavaliers, ditch and other fortifications were never constructed. Fort San Salvatore was built on one of the Cottonera Lines bastions in 1724. Fort Ricasoli was built between 1670 and 1698 commanding the eastern arm of the Grand Harbour. It has an irregular plan following the coastline, with bastions, curtains and ravelins. The fort was improved later on in the 18th century. Fort Saint Angelo was also extensively modified in the 1690s, when it was upgraded with the building of various batteries and other defences. Fort Manoel as seen from the bastions of Valletta From 1723 to 1733, Fort Manoel was built on Manoel Island in Marsamxett Harbour, so as to protect Valletta's western flank. The Baroque fort is square in shape, with four corner bastions. It was the last major fort to be built with the bastioned trace in Malta. The Order's last major fortification in the harbour area was Fort Tign√©, built at Tign√© Point between 1793 and 1795. It was built to protect the entrance of Marsamxett, along with Fort Saint Elmo. The fort's architecture is very different from the Order's earlier forts, and although very small by 18th century standards, it has been described as among the most revolutionary and influential of Malta's fortifications as it is a very early example of a polygonal fort. Many other polygonal forts were built by the British later on in the 19th century. Mdina and the Cittadella De Redin Bastion in Mdina Although Mdina was no longer the capital city, the Order still strengthened the city's defences, and gradually upgraded its medieval walls into a gunpowder fortress. In the 1540s, during the magistracy of Juan de Homedes y Coscon, two bastions were built on the corners of the city's land front. The central De Redin Bastion was built by Grand Master Martin de Redin in the mid-17th century. The city was damaged during the 1693 Sicily earthquake, and repairs were made over the course of the 18th century. During the rebuilding, the city's entrance was replaced by a larger gate by the architect Charles Fran√ßois de Mondion in 1724, and the last modifications were made in 1746, when Despuig Bastion was completed. There were other plans to strengthen the city but these were not implemented as the Order focused on the fortifications at the harbour area. The defences of Gozo's Cittadella were also improved by the Order. In 1551, the city was devastated by an Ottoman raid which took almost Gozo's entire population as slaves. The city's entrance and southern walls were later completely rebuilt between 1599 and 1622, although the city's northern walls were retained in their original medieval form. The early 17th century modifications included the construction of bastions, cavaliers, magazines and a battery. Coastal fortifications Wignacourt Tower in St. Paul's Bay Despite the significant fortifications in the harbour area, the rest of the islands remained mostly undefended until the 17th century, and they were prone to attacks (such as the raid of 1551). This changed in 1605, when Garzes Tower was built in Mƒ°arr on the island of Gozo. This watchtower no longer exists as it was demolished by the British administration in 1848. In the following years, more towers were built around the islands. The first group, the Wignacourt towers, were built between 1610 and 1620. Six of these were built, and they were more than just watchtowers as they formed significant strongpoints intended to protect vulnerable sections of the coast from attack. Of the six towers, one collapsed in around 1715 and another was demolished in 1888. The other four towers survive to this day. Gƒßajn Tuffieƒßa Tower in Mƒ°arr Seven more towers were built between 1637 and 1638. These were much smaller than the Wignacourt towers, as they were built as watchtowers and a communication link to warn the Order's base in the Grand Harbour of an attack. In 1647, Saint Agatha's Tower was built in Mellieƒßa. This was a large tower intended as a strongpoint, and was built in the style of the Wignacourt towers. Two more towers were built at Dwejra and Xlendi on Gozo in 1650 and 1652. The ten towers built between 1637 and 1652 are collectively known as the Lascaris towers after the Grand Master who built them, and nine of them survive to this day. Gƒßallis Tower in Naxxar Another series of towers were built between 1658 and 1659. Fourteen towers were built in all, which are together known as the De Redin towers. These were based on the Lascaris towers and had the same function as a communication link. 13 towers were built on mainland Malta having an identical design, and 8 of these survive intact while 2 are in ruins. The fourteenth tower, Mƒ°arr ix-Xini Tower, was built on Gozo in 1661 with a slightly different design. The last coastal watchtower to be built was Sopu Tower, which was constructed in Gozo in 1667. The tower had almost collapsed but was rebuilt in the early 2000s and it is now in good condition. Saint Anthony's Battery in Qala From 1714 onwards, about 52 batteries and redoubts were built around the coasts of Malta and Gozo. A few of the batteries were built around existing coastal watchtowers, such as Qawra and Aƒßrax Towers. Most of the batteries were destroyed over the years or are in ruins, but a few are still more or less intact, including Mistra, Vend√¥me, Ferretti, St. Anthony's, Qolla l-Bajda and St. Mary's Batteries. Very few redoubts survive, including Briconet, Ximenes and St. George Redoubts. Various entrenchments were also built between the 1720s and 1760s, both around the coastline and along some inland positions. The remains of a few still survive today, including the Naxxar Entrenchment and the Louvier Entrenchment. From 1749 to the 1760s, Fort Chambray was built on the island of Gozo. It was intended to be a new fortified city like Valletta, and eventually to replace the Cittadella as the island's capital. This was unsuccessful, and eventually only the fort was built. It saw some action during the French occupation of 1798, but its importance eventually diminished. It was converted into a hospital in the 19th century. In the 1990s, the interior of the fort began to be redeveloped, but the outer bastions and some barracks remain intact. Between 1793 and 1795, Saint Lucian Tower and its battery were strengthened with a ditch and an entrenchment-like enclosure, and the complex was renamed Fort Rohan after the reigning Grand Master, Emmanuel de Rohan-Polduc. Most of the fortifications, with the exception of the tower itself, were dismantled and rebuilt by the British later on in the 19th century and the name Fort Rohan fell into disuse. Apart from the knights' fortifications, over the years various individuals or families built their own fortifications. These were mainly fortified residences or private watchtowers. A notable surviving example is Mamo Tower, built in 1657 in Marsaskala. French occupation (1798‚Äì1800) Map of Tal-Borg Battery, one of the batteries built by Maltese insurgents The French evicted the Order from Malta during the Mediterranean campaign of 1798, and the Order surrendered after a couple of days. The Maltese, although initially welcoming the French occupiers, rebelled after a couple of months due to a number of reforms and the looting of churches. The insurgents took control of Gozo which became briefly independent, as well as Mdina and the towns and villages of the main island, leaving the French blockaded in the well-defended harbour area. The Maltese insurgents, helped by the British, hastily built various fortifications mainly intended to repel a possible French counter-attack, and at the same time also bombard French positions in the harbour area. The insurgents had various camps, and men in these camps were responsible for a number of batteries, redoubts and entrenchments in the vicinity. The most important batteries were the Corradino Batteries, Gƒßargƒßar Battery, Tal-Borg Battery and Tas-Samra Battery. The fortifications surrounded the entire harbour area, stretching all the way from Sliema to Kalkara. The design of the batteries was based on the coastal batteries and entrenchments built by the Order in the 18th century, while most of the entrenchments consisted of long stretches of rubble walls. They were armed by guns taken from coastal fortifications such as Saint Mary's Tower. The usefulness of the fortifications was tested in 1799 when a French counter-attack from Fort Manoel was repelled by the insurgent batteries. None of these fortifications survive intact, although some pre-existing buildings that were used as blockhouses may still be seen. San Rocco Battery, one of the insurgents' fortifications, was the location where Fort Saint Rocco was built later on in the late 19th century. British fortifications (1800‚Äì1979) Nineteenth and early twentieth centuries Lascaris Battery in Valletta The British took over the Maltese islands as a protectorate in 1800, and later as a colony in 1813. They initially used the Hospitaller fortifications without any alterations. Under the military theory of the time, the Royal Navy's Mediterranean Fleet was regarded as the most reliable protection against invasion, and in fact the British Civil Commissioner, Henry Pigot, wanted to demolish the majority of Valletta's fortifications in 1801, although this was never done. During the British period, the various forts of the Order were rearmed, refitted and altered a number of times to keep up with the latest military technology. In the 1850s, the British built Fort Verdala and St. Clement's Retrenchment in the Cottonera area, while Lascaris Battery was built in Valletta. Later on in the 19th century, parts of the Cottonera Lines, Santa Margherita Lines and the fortifications of Senglea were demolished to make way for extensions of the Malta Dockyard. Throughout the 19th and 20th centuries, the British built barracks in various parts of the island, such as Tign√© Point and Pembroke. In 1866, Colonel William Jervois produced a report entitled \\"Memorandum with reference to the improvements to the defences of Malta and Gibraltar, rendered necessary by the introduction of Iron Plated Ships and powerful rifled guns\\", in which he gave Malta (along with Gibraltar, Halifax and Bermuda) the status of an \\"imperial fortress\\". A programme to improve Malta's fortifications began soon after, and a number of new polygonal forts and batteries were built, including Sliema Point Battery (1872), Fort St. Rocco (1872‚Äì73) and Fort Leonardo (1875‚Äì78). From 1871 to 1880, the Corradino Lines were built on the Corradino Heights. The V-shaped trace and ditch were meant to protect the dockyard and harbour from landward attacks. They were abandoned in the early 1900s due to advancements in technology, although they saw some use once again in World War II. Victoria Lines on the border between Mƒ°arr and Rabat Starting from 1875, the Victoria Lines, originally known as the North West Front, were built along the northern part of Malta, dividing it from the more heavily populated south. The system of defences consisted of a line of fortifications flanked by defensive towers, along with entrenchments and gun emplacements. Several artillery batteries were planned, but only San Giovanni Battery and Tarƒ°a Battery were actually built. Three forts were also built along the lines: Fort Binƒ°emma, Fort Madalena and Fort Mosta. The lines were completed in 1899, but exercises in 1900 proved that they were of dubious defensive value, and the entire system was decommissioned in 1907, with the exception of the coastal towers. Today, parts of the lines have collapsed but other parts in the countryside, including the three forts, still survive. Another fort, Fort Pembroke, was built between 1875 and 1878 to cover the gap between the Victoria Lines and the harbour area. The British also built a number of forts to protect Marsaxlokk Harbour. These included Fort San Lucian (1874‚Äì78), Fort Delimara (1876‚Äì88), Fort Tas-Silƒ° (1879‚Äì83). In 1881 and 1882, Saint Paul's Battery and ≈ªonqor Battery were built in Marsaxlokk and Marsaskala respectively. 100-ton gun at Rinella Battery Following the arming of the Italian ironclads Duilio and Dandolo with 100-ton guns, the British feared an Italian attack on Malta, as the ships could fire on Malta's batteries, destroying them one after the other, while keeping outside their guns' range. To prevent this, the British requested that four 100-ton guns be built. Two of these were installed in Malta, and Cambridge Battery and Rinella Battery were built specifically to house these guns. Construction of the batteries began in 1878 and they were complete by 1886. The gun at Rinella still exists. From 1888 to 1910, a new series of fortifications were built to house breech-loading guns. These were Della Grazie Battery, Spinola Battery, Garden Battery, Wolseley Battery, Pembroke Battery and Fort Benghisa. The latter was the last polygonal fort to be built in Malta. World Wars and aftermath Reserve Post R15, a World War II-era pillbox in Naxxar After the early 20th century, few fortifications were built in Malta. However, new military installations such as airfields began to be built in World War I, when the seaplane base of RAF Kalafrana and the airfield at Marsa were built. More airfields were built in the interwar period and the Second World War, including RAF Hal Far, RAF Ta Kali, RAF Luqa, RAF Safi, RAF Krendi and Ta' Lambert Airfield. From the Abyssinian Crisis of 1935 onwards, the British built many pillboxes in Malta for defence in case of an Italian invasion. Many others were built during World War II. Many pillboxes still exist, especially on the north eastern part of the island. A few of them have been restored and are cared for, but many others were demolished. Some pillboxes are still being destroyed as they are not considered to have any architectural or historic value. Ruins of Fort Campbell in Mellieƒßa The last fort to be built in Malta was Fort Campbell, which was built near Mellieƒßa between late 1937 and 1938. The design of the fort is completely different from the earlier fortifications in Malta as it was designed to counter the new threat of aerial bombardment. It had an irregular plan and its perimeter was guarded by machine gun posts and a few rifle loopholes. The buildings inside were scattered so as not to create a concentration of buildings. The fort still exists, although it is largely in ruins. During the Second World War, the Lascaris War Rooms were built in Valletta to serve as the war headquarters for the defence of Malta. They were later used in the headquarters of the Allied invasion of Sicily. Throughout the war, many air-raid shelters also were dug in the limestone rock of the islands, either by the government or by individuals or families, to protect the civilian population of Malta from Italian or German aerial bombardment. Many of the shelters still exist, and a few are open to the public. Many anti-aircraft batteries, gun positions and radar stations were also built throughout the course of the war. Many of the fortifications were decommissioned between the 1950s and 1970s. Some were left abandoned while others were used for a variety of purposes, such as private residences, restaurants, police stations or farms. Some barracks, such as those at Mtarfa and Pembroke, were converted to housing estates. Several forts and historic military buildings are still in use by the Armed Forces of Malta, such as Luqa Barracks, Fort Madalena and Fort Mosta. Present day Conservation and restoration The restored Sopu Tower in 2006. Prior to restoration it had almost completely collapsed. Today, the architectural and historical value of Malta's fortifications is widely acknowledged, and many also serve as tourist attractions. All fortifications were included on the Antiquities List of 1925, and virtually all surviving Hospitaller fortifications are now listed on the National Inventory of the Cultural Property of the Maltese Islands, Malta's national heritage register. The fortified city of Valletta has been listed as a World Heritage Site by UNESCO since 1980. The other fortifications around Malta's harbour area, the fortified cities of Mdina and the Cittadella, as well as the Victoria Lines have been on the tentative list of World Heritage Sites since 1998. From the 1970s onwards, some of the fortifications, especially those which were abandoned, became dilapidated and often vandalized. However, since the beginning of the 21st century, a number of fortifications have been restored or are undergoing restoration. The National Trust of Malta, Din l-Art ƒ¶elwa, was responsible for the restoration of a number of Hospitaller coastal fortifications from the 1970s onwards. Towers and batteries restored by Din l-Art ƒ¶elwa include Wignacourt Tower (1975‚Äì76 and 2003), Mamo Tower (1994‚Äì95), Gƒßallis Tower (1995), St. Mary's Battery (1996‚Äì97 and 2003‚Äì04), Dwejra Tower (1997), St. Mark's Tower (1997‚Äì98), St. Agatha's Tower (1999‚Äì2001), St. Mary's Tower (2002 and 2005) and Sopu Tower (2004). Din l-Art ƒ¶elwa is currently restoring St. Anthony's Battery and Xlendi Tower. Fondazzjoni Wirt Artna also restored a number of Maltese fortifications, including the Saluting Battery and Rinella Battery. It is currently restoring Mistra Battery. From 2001 onwards, MIDI plc began restoration of Fort Manoel as part of its Manoel Island project. The restoration included rebuilding the Chapel of St Anthony of Padua, which had been bombed in World War II. In 2008, MIDI also restored Fort Tign√© as part of its development of Tign√© Point. The 19th century Garden Battery, which was believed to have been destroyed in the World War II, was rediscovered during the Tign√© Point project, and MIDI decided to restore it as well. The first plans to restore the fortifications of Valletta, Birgu, Mdina and the Cittadella were made in 2006. In 2008, restoration began in Mdina, Birgu and the Cittadella. In Mdina, some of the bastions had started to slip down the clay slopes, and steel rods were inserted in the walls to reinforce them. Throughout the course of restoration, a number of archaeological remains have been found, including remains of Mdina's Punic-Roman and medieval walls, a bastion and a caponier in Birgu, the Cittadella's original entrance, and a number of other features. In Valletta, restoration started in 2010, with the project being described as \\"the biggest in a century\\". Squatters were evicted from public lands around the fortifications. Restoration of the upper part of Fort Saint Elmo was completed in 2015. The Chapel of St Roche on St Michael's Counterguard, which was bombed in World War II, was rebuilt in 2014 as part of the restoration. Parts of the fortifications of Senglea began to be restored in 2015. Fortifications Interpretation Centre The Fortifications Interpretation Centre The Fortifications Interpretation Centre (FIC) is a public institution dedicated to communicating and exhibiting Malta's military architecture. It is located in a building adjoining Saint Andrew's Bastion, part of the city walls of Valletta. The building was originally a bombproof magazine and artillery school that was built sometime during the reign of Hugues Loubenx de Verdalle in the late 16th century. The uppermost floor had been destroyed in World War II and the rest of the building was subsequently used as an examination hall. The building was restored and the upper floor rebuilt in a project co-financed by the European Regional Development Fund, and the FIC was opened on 16 February 2013. The FIC includes information guides on the fortifications of Malta, going back to the first fortifications at Borƒ° in-Nadur and focusing especially on those built by the Order and the British. It contains models of Maltese forts, as well as informative panels describing fortifications around the world, thus putting Malta's fortifications in context. Heraldry A De Redin tower on the coat of arms of the Armed Forces of Malta Malta's fortifications are featured a number of times on the islands' heraldry. The coat of arms of Malta contains a mural crown in gold with a sally port and eight turrets (five of which are visible), which represents the fortifications as well as Malta's status as a city-state. The coats of arms of the five regions of Malta have a similar crown but with five turrets, all of which are visible. A mural crown with four visible turrets can be seen on the coats of arms of Valletta, Mdina and Birgu, indicating their status as capital city or former capitals. Another version with four turrets (three visible) can be seen on the coats of arms of Cospicua, Senglea, Qormi, Siƒ°ƒ°iewi, ≈ªabbar, ≈ªebbuƒ°, ≈ªejtun and Victoria, indicating the status of a city. The coat of arms of Xgƒßajra features a heraldic representation of Santa Maria delle Grazie Tower, a now-demolished Wignacourt tower. In addition, De Redin towers are featured on the coats of arms of the Armed Forces of Malta (as well as its Air Wing), the Malta Stock Exchange, and the town of Pembroke. The coat of arms of Mtarfa feature a representation of Mtarfa Barracks, reflecting the role of the British military in the founding of the town.

The objective of the game is to guide a magnetic metal ball, known as Joe, to a designated exit in each level using various magnetic forces. Gameplay The game features a one-button control scheme where the player presses a single button, or touches the screen, to activate Joe's magnetism. When Joe passes near a magnetic cell, his magnetism activates. The player can see a lightning effect between Joe and the magnet, and Joe moves towards the magnet. As he moves closer to the magnet, his movement and rotation changes. The player can control the ball's movement by timing when the magnetism is activated. Different magnets push or pull the ball in different directions and are marked accordingly. Joe can move around by rolling and bouncing. However, frequent hazards on the map, such as spiked floors and walls, add a challenge to this form of movement. Versions Magnetic Joe (mobile / J2ME) The original game was released in 2006 for mobile phones. It featured 50 levels to complete 3 different \\"worlds\\". It was possible to play randomly generated 'secret' levels by entering a code. Levels were generated based on the code entered. The original game was well received by the gaming press, praising its simple and great game mechanics. It won a 'best casual game' award in 2006. \\"Magnetic Joe is incredibly simple and incredibly addictive, the game can be frustrating and extremely rewarding.

On 13 June 2018 he was named Minister of Internally Displaced Persons from the Occupied Territories, Accommodation and Refugees in the cabinet of Mamuka Bakhtadze.  Early life and medical career  Sergeenko was born in Tbilisi, the capital of then-Soviet Georgia in 1963. He graduated from the Tbilisi State Medical Institute as a pediatrician in 1987 and the Moscow Institute for Continued Medical Education as an intensive care specialist in 1991. Returning to Georgia, he practiced neonatology in Sukhumi and Rustavi from 1987 to 1992. He then served in the Georgian Armed Forces as a physician for an air force regiment from 1992 to 1993 and as a chief of medical service at the State Department of Sports from 1995 to 1997. He worked as an ICU physician at the Jo Ann Medical Center in Tbilisi from 1997 to 2006 and a medical services manager at the MediClub-Georgia clinic from 2002 to 2006. In 2006, he became Director General of a medical center in the provincial town of Sachkhere, funded by the billionaire tycoon Bidzina Ivanishvili, a Sachkhere native who had amassed his wealth in Russia in the 1990s.  Government career  After Ivanishvili's Georgian Dream coalition won the October 2012 parliamentary election and subsequently formed the new government, Sergeenko was made Minister of Health, Labor, and Social Affairs in the cabinets of Ivanishvili and of his prot√©g√© and successor, Irakli Garibashvili. Sergeenko presided over the establishment of the government- funded Universal Health Care system in February 2013. As the Georgian government's support to post-revolutionary Ukraine amid a brewing confrontation with Russia was reserved, Sergeenko was the only Georgian minister to have visited Kiev in August 2014; he then oversaw Georgia's humanitarian aid, worth of about GEL 1 million (US$570,000), to Ukraine in September 2014. Sergeenko was also behind the controversial law adopted in August 2014, tightening the regulation of prescription drugs. He also suggested, in May 2013, that Georgia might consider decriminalization of marijuana as part of the strategy to tackle on illicit drug-trafficking channels.

Other kinds of pollution, including mercury contamination and cities discharging untreated sewage, have also caused problems in the river. In response to this contamination, activists protested in various ways; for instance, musician Pete Seeger founded the Hudson River Sloop Clearwater and the Clearwater Festival to draw attention to the problem. Environmental activism led to passage of the federal Clean Water Act in 1972, as well as federal government designation of the river as a Superfund site in 1984. Extensive remediation actions on the river began in the 1970s with the implementation of wastewater discharge permits and consequent reduction of wastewater discharges, and sediment removal operations, which have continued into the 21st century. Types of pollution and other environmental impacts The New York State Department of Environmental Conservation (NYSDEC) has listed various portions of the Hudson as having impaired water quality due to PCBs, cadmium, and other toxic compounds. Hudson River tributaries with impaired water quality (not necessarily the same pollutants as the Hudson main stem) are Mohawk River, Dwaas Kill, Schuyler Creek, Saw Mill River, Esopus Creek, Hoosic River, Quaker Creek, and Batten Kill. Many lakes in the Hudson drainage basin are also listed.New York State Department of Environmental Conservation (NYSDEC), Albany, NY. \\"Final New York State 2008 Section 303(d) List of Impaired Waters Requiring a TMDL/Other Strategy.\\" May 26, 2008. Other ongoing pollution problems affecting the river include: accidental sewage discharges, urban runoff, heavy metals, furans, dioxin, pesticides, and polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs). Numerous factories that once lined the Hudson River poured garbage and industrial waste directly into the river. These factories produced transformers, capacitors, and electric motors, which used PCBs as dielectric and coolant fluid. This pollution was not comprehensively assessed until the 1970s. By that time, the largest remaining factories in the area were owned by General Electric, which became primarily responsible for cleaning the Hudson River. Between approximately 1947 and 1977, GE released between of PCBs into the river. The PCBs came from the company's two capacitor manufacturing plants at Hudson Falls and Fort Edward, New York. The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) banned the manufacture of PCBs in 1979. The bulk of the PCBs in the river were manufactured by Monsanto Co. under the brand names Aroclor 1242 and Aroclor 1016. The highest concentration of PCBs is found in the Thompson Island Pool. Another noted polluter was General Motors, which operated the North Tarrytown Assembly in North Tarrytown, New York (now known as Sleepy Hollow). The plant was in operation from 1896 to 1996. The plant used about 1 million gallons of water per day, which was returned to the river as waste. The plant's industrial waste (primarily lead chromate and other painting, cleaning, and soldering chemicals) would be emptied directly into the river. Domestic waste would be processed through the village's sewage treatment plant. Around 1971, the village's Sewer and Water Superintendent assured that the pollution reports were exaggerated, and that he and other residents would swim by a beach nearby, however Dominick Pirone, an ecologist and former director of the Hudson River Fishermen's Association (now Riverkeeper) was quoted as saying: \\"You can tell what color cars they are painting on a given day by what color the river is.\\" A 2008 study suggested that mercury in common Hudson River fish, including striped bass, yellow perch, largemouth bass, smallmouth bass and carp, declined strongly over the preceding three decades. The conclusions were extracted from a large database of mercury analyses of fish fillets accumulated by NYSDEC and collected over much of the length of the Hudson, from New York City waters to the Adirondack watershed. The research indicated that the trends were in line with the recovery that the Hudson River experienced over the preceding few decades, in response to the efforts of activist groups, government officials and industry by cooperating to help clean up the river system. In 1991, zebra mussels, an invasive species, first appeared in the Hudson River, causing the near-disappearance of native pearly mussels. In 2010, the NYSDEC determined that the Indian Point Energy Center, a nuclear power plant in Buchanan, was violating the Clean Water Act because of its large withdrawals of water from the Hudson, which kills millions of fish and other aquatic organisms each year. The state requested that Entergy, the plant operator, replace its fish screens with cooling towers to mitigate the environmental impacts. In 2017 the State of New York and Entergy reached agreement that the Indian Point plant would close in 2021. Effects The PCBs caused extensive contamination of fish in the river and apparently triggered a rapid evolutionary change in the Atlantic tomcod, which after about 50 years of exposure evolved a two amino acid change in its AHR2 receptor gene, causing the receptor to bind more weakly with PCBs than normal. The mutation does not prevent the tomcods from accumulating PCBs in their bodies and passing them on to striped bass and whatever else eats them. This system of passing contamination on to larger organisms is also known as biomagnification. The toxic chemicals also accumulated in sediments that settled to the river bottom. In 1976 NYSDEC banned all fishing in the Upper Hudson because of health concerns with PCBs. It also issued advisories restricting the consumption of fish caught within a long segment of the Hudson River from Hudson Falls to Troy. The New York State Department of Health recommends eating no fish caught from the South Glens Falls Dam to the Federal Dam at Troy. Women under 50 and children under 15 are not advised to eat any fish caught south of the Palmer Falls Dam in Corinth, while others are advised to eat anywhere from one to four meals per month of Hudson River fish, depending on species and location caught. The Department of Health cites mercury, PCBs, dioxin, and cadmium as the chemicals impacting fish in these areas. PCBs are thought to be responsible for health concerns that include neurological disorders, lower IQ and poor short-term memory (active memory), hormonal disruption, suppressed immune system, cancer, skin irritations, Parkinson‚Äôs disease, ADHD, heart disease, and diabetes. PCB contamination in humans may come from drinking the contaminated water, absorption through the skin, eating contaminated aquatic life, and/or inhaling volatilized PCBs. PCB contamination is especially dangerous for pregnant and nursing women. The contamination can reach the fetus and potentially cause birth defects. Contamination through breast milk can also have harmful effects on the child indirectly. Cleanup In 1966, Pete Seeger and Toshi Seeger founded Hudson River Sloop Clearwater, an environmental education organization and an actual boat (a sloop), that promotes awareness of the river and its history. Clearwater gained national recognition for its activism starting in the 1970s to force a clean-up of PCB contamination of the Hudson caused by GE and other companies.Hudson River Sloop Clearwater, Beacon, NY. \\"History.\\" Accessed 2010-10-05. Other specific Hudson watershed problems with which Clearwater is concerned are development pressures in the southern half of the Hudson Valley, pesticide runoff, the Manhattan west side waterfront, Indian Point nuclear reactors, and New York/New Jersey Harbor dredge spoil disposal.\\"Where Have All The Flowers Gone\\" , Roll Magazine, p. 14, accessed November 4, 2010 In 1972 Congress passed the Clean Water Act and established a nationwide discharge permit system for all surface waters. All Hudson River point source dischargers were required to obtain permits issued by NYSDEC. The restrictions in these permits led to an overall reduction in pollutant loadings to the river, as factories, power plants and municipalities installed or improved their wastewater treatment systems or made other plant modifications to reduce pollution. Among the prominent sewage plant upgrades was the completion of the North River Wastewater Treatment Plant in Manhattan, where 150 million gallons per day of untreated sewage was discharged to the river until the plant opened in 1986. However, persistent pollutants such as PCBs and heavy metals, that had been discharged prior to implementation of the new permit requirements, remained in the sediments of the river. In 1980, Consolidated Edison (Con Ed) agreed to drop its 17-year fight to build a pumped-storage hydroelectricity facility on Storm King Mountain, after a legal challenge by the non-profit environmental organization Scenic Hudson.Marist College, Poughkeepsie, NY. \\"The Scenic Hudson Decision.\\" Marist Environmental History Project. Accessed 2010-10-05. The actions of local citizen organizations that led to the Con Ed decision spurred the creation of Riverkeeper, a non-profit environmental organization that grew into a global umbrella organization, the Waterkeeper Alliance. Among the initial attempts to clean up the upper Hudson River was the removal in 1977‚Äì78 of of contaminated river sediments near Fort Edward. In 1984, EPA declared a stretch of the river, from Hudson Falls to New York City, to be a Superfund site requiring cleanup. This hazardous waste site is considered to be one of the largest in the nation. There have been many programs of remediation work to reduce the PCB pollution. In 1991, further PCB pollution was found at Bakers Falls, near the former GE Hudson Falls factory, and a program of remediation was started. In August 1995, a reach of the upper Hudson was reopened to fishing, but only on a catch-and-release basis. Removal of contaminated soil from Rogers Island was completed in December 1999. GE dredging operation in 2012 In 2001, after a ten-year study of PCB contamination in the Hudson River, EPA proposed a plan to clean up the river by dredging more than of PCBs. The worst PCB hotspots are targeted for remediation by removing and disposing of more than 2.6 million cubic yards of contaminated sediment. The dredging project is the most aggressive environmental effort ever proposed to clean up a river, and will cost GE about $460,000,000. In 2002, EPA announced a further of contaminated sediments in the upper Hudson River would be removed. GE began sediment dredging operations to clean up the PCBs on May 15, 2009. This stage (Phase One) of the cleanup was completed in October 2009, and was responsible for the removal of approximately of contaminated sediment, which was more than the targeted amount. Over 620 barges filled with sediment were transported to the processing facility on the Champlain Canal, and over 80 rail cars transported the dredged sediment to a waste facility in Andrews, Texas. The true scope of Phase One was about more than planned, and Phase Two was to be expanded as a consequence. Phase Two of the cleanup project, led by GE and monitored by EPA, began in June 2011, targeting approximately of PCB-contaminated sediment from a forty-mile section of the Upper Hudson River. Phase Two of the cleanup will take approximately 5 to 7 years to complete. In 2010, General Electric agreed to finance and conduct a second dredging campaign at the Upper Hudson River between Fort Edward and Troy. These works have been supervised by EPA. Though the cleanup has been slow, environmental advocacy groups have reached out to the general public on the condition of the river's pollution. Scenic Hudson, Hudson River Sloop Clearwater, Hudson Riverkeeper, and the Natural Resources Defense Council have continued to push for more action from General Electric. After Seeger's death in 2014, EPA Regional Administrator Judith A. Enck stated that \\"the incredible work\\" of Seeger and the Clearwater organization helped make the Hudson River cleaner. Water quality improvement In 2016, a humpback whale was spotted swimming in the Hudson River west of 63rd Street in Manhattan. Whales have become a more common sight in the river recently. This is because of a combination of cleanup of waste in the river as well as conservation of wildlife that creates a hospitable habitat for the whales. Whales have been spotted all the way up to the George Washington Bridge. The whales are especially prominent during feeding season in the fall. State and federal officials are warning kayakers and boaters to slow down and stay at least from any whales in the area in order to not distress or hurt the whales. Opposition GE fought a media and political battle to avoid cleaning up the river and countered that dredging the river would actually stir up PCBs. In 2002, EPA ordered GE to clean up a stretch of the Hudson River it had contaminated.

A member of a prominent Sayyid family with origins in the royal Marashi family of Mazandaran, Khalifeh Soltan was a well-educated man of letters, who played an important role in the Iranian clergy affairs, and also later in the Safavid administration, when he was appointed as grand vizier in 1623/4. He was, however, in 1632, disgraced and exiled by the ruthless newly- crowned shah Safi. Later, in 1645, Khalifeh Soltan was re-appointed as grand vizier by the latter's son and successor, Abbas II, whom he became a close companion of, and gained considerable influence. Khalifeh Soltan later died in 5 March 1654 in his ancestral homeland of Mazandaran due to illness, and was succeeded by Mohammad Beg.  Origins  Khalifeh Soltan was born in ca. 1592/3 in Isfahan, where he grew up; his father Mirza Rafi al-Din Muhammad was a prominent aristocrat who occupied high offices in the Safavid Empire, and belonged to a family known as the \\"Shahristani sayyids\\", which was descended from Shah Nimatullah, the founder of the Nimatullahi order. Khalifeh Soltan's mother belonged to a family known as the \\"Khalifeh sayyids\\", a family of Marashi descent, whose ancestor, Amir Nezam al-Din, was forced to settle in the Golbar quarter of Isfahan in the 15th-century. Khalifeh Soltan was thus related to Shah Abbas I, whose mother was Khayr al-Nisa Begum, a Marashi princess who had fled to the Safavid court and married the previous Safavid shah Mohammad Khodabanda (r. 1578‚Äì1587). Even though the Khalifeh sayyid family was renowned of being descendants of the celebrated Marashi ruler Mir-i Buzurg (r. 1359‚Äì1362), they still weren't one of the leading families of Isfahan yet. But they were still affluent and distinguished enough to intermarry with local well-known families. According to the Safavid court historian Iskandar Munshi, \\"The Khalifeh family had held estates in the Isfahan area for generations.\\" Khalifeh Soltan had a brother named Mirza Qavam al-Din Mohammad, who later, like himself and their father, would occupy high offices.  Biography  First term as grand vizier (1623/4-1632) Safavid Empire at the appointment of Khalifeh Soltan. On November 28, 1607, Khalifeh Soltan married shah Abbas I's third daughter, Khan-Agha Begum. After the marriage, Khalifeh Soltan asked for the governorship of Tabriz as an outcome of the cheerful circumstance, which was, however, declined. This demonstrates Khalifeh Soltan's early passion in getting a role in the state bureaucracy. Khalifeh Soltan was later in 1623/4 appointed by the shah as his grand vizier. When Khalifeh Soltan became grand vizier, Baghdad had recently been captured, while a Safavid army was marching towards Basra to capture it. Furthermore, during this period, the Armenians suffered from persecutions by Abbas I. In late 1624, after celebrating Nowruz, Abbas I left for Georgia to suppress a rebellion, thus leaving the young Khalifeh Soltan in Isfahan, to take care of the Safavid affairs. On 24 March 1626, an event occurred that \\"portended tragedy and turned to comedy\\". On that day, Khalifeh Soltan, who was still new to the grand vizier post, sent 200 soldiers to the convent of the Carmelites, a Catholic religious order. The soldiers inspected the convent, and then beat the monks and took them to Khalifeh Soltan. The monks thought they were going to be killed, and supposedly were excited that they were going to be martyred. However, this was not the case; Khalifeh Soltan, enraged by his soldiers treatment of the monks, threatened to kill the officer who led the soldiers. The monks, however, urged Khalifeh Soltan to spare him, which he did. Khalifeh Soltan and his officials then began asking the monks several questions about Christianity. He then discovered that the monks were not Augustinian monks, whom he had been advised to move to Shiraz, \\"because of Portuguese at Basra, which were considered contrary to Persian interests.\\" He then let the Carmelites go. Dismissal and exile Abbas I died in 1629 and was succeeded by his grandson Safi, who in 1632 executed and exiled most of the officers who had served his grandfather, which included Khalifeh Soltan, who was dismissed on February 14 and thereafter exiled to Qom, while his four sons, who belonged to the Safavid royal house through their mother, were blinded. During his exile in Qom, he focused in expertise and making observations on several valuable texts. According to the person who edited the Dastur al-wuzarƒÅ, Khalifeh Soltan was the composer of that work, which was written between 1645‚Äì1654. In 1638/9, Khalifeh Soltan may have returned to Isfahan. However, it is known that by 1645 he was living in the city, after having performed a pilgrimage to Mecca. During his pilgrimage, he had met Ottaqi Efendi, the shaykh of Mecca, who described him as a \\"man of great scholarship and perspicacity\\", and someone with whom he had had \\"many enjoyable sessions of learned discussions\\". Second term as grand vizier (1645‚Äì1654) On 11 October 1645, the grand vizier Saru Taqi was murdered under the orders of Abbas II, who appointed Khalifeh Soltan as his grand vizier on October 14. Khalifeh Soltan had at first declined the offer, but quickly alter accepted. His established bureaucratic proficiency and past knowledge were definitely the deciding factors in this reappointment, albeit it may be possible that Abbas II recalled him into duty in part with the goal of compressing the discontent about the scarcity of the positions given to men of religion under his predecessor. The Dutch trader Winninx, who was in Isfahan for transactions with the royal court at that time, commented the following about the situation; \\"He first refused to accept the post claiming to be too old and not competent enough to carry out the task. However, everybody expected him to accept the function. Khalifeh Soltan was universally liked and considered to be an upright person.\\" Shah Abbas II (r. 1642‚Äì1666). Khalifeh Soltan's actions during his second term as grand vizier are much better described and unveils a complex identity. Committing up to his notoriety as a dedicated man and a cleric, he started his second term with an operation countering \\"sinful behaviour\\", which targeted betting, prostitution, and wine drinking-activities that were normal in coffee houses and taverns. The operation was mainly aimed against well-known forms of Sufism, but did not stop Khalifeh Soltan from showing (more virtuous) mystical tendencies, or from becoming one of Abbas II's close companions after the shah started drinking in 1649/50. The contemporary Persian historian Nasrabadi implies that Khalifeh Soltan was forced to drink against his will by the shah, which is probable. A year earlier (1648), Khalifeh Soltan had accompanied Abbas II during his expedition against the Mughals, which ended in a victory for the Safavids, who managed to capture Bost and Qandahar. Khalifeh Soltan is also said to have assembled constant public gatherings for people with appeals and gripes, a routine that was cancelled under his successors. He additionally demonstrated to be an insightful diplomat with the deputies of the foreign naval companies. Khalifeh Soltan was chosen as a representative for the wealthy and pure- blooded Iranian clerical elite. He possessed the village of Golnabad on the road linking Isfahan and Yazd, and he had an important madrasa constructed in Qazvin. After having been ill for 40 days, Khalifeh Soltan died on 5 March 1654 in Mazandaran, the homeland of his ancestors. His body was then taken to Najaf in Iraq, where he was buried. He was succeeded by Mohammad Beg, a Muslim of Armenian origin.  Offspring  Khalifeh Soltan's four sons, whom were all blinded in 1632 by Safi, were due to this not able to hold any post. They did, however, become renowned ulama. One of these sons, Mirza Sayyed Hasan, was one of the most dominant ulama of his time. He had married the Safavid princess Zobeydeh Khanum, who was the daughter of the later Shah Suleiman I (r. 1666‚Äì1694), and the sister of Shah Soltan Hossein (r. 1694‚Äì1722). She bore him Mirza Mohammad Baqer and Mir Sayyed Morteza, who both served as the sadr-i khasseh and sadr-i mamalik under their cousin Soltan Hossein. Khalifeh Soltan also had several daughters‚Äîin 1651/2, one of his daughters married the son of the minister of religion (sadr-i mamalik) Mirza Mohammad Karaki. Another daughter was married to Mirza Mohsen Razavi, whilst a third one was married to the qurchi-bashi Morteza Qoli Khan Shamlu.

He was a former concertmaster of the Vienna State Opera and Vienna Philharmonic. He was dismissed on September 1, 1938 because he was unable to produce an Ariernachweis (Aryan certificate). He eventually became a citizen of the United States.  Early Life and Studies  Ricardo was one of three children born in Buenos Aires to Mauricio (alternate spelling: Mois√©s) Odnoposoff and Juana (n√©e Veinstein; alternate spelling Weinstein). Mauricio Odnoposoff had emigrated from Russia to Argentina with his father. Ricardo first learned to play the violin in Buenos Aires. Mauricio and Juana Odnoposoff moved to Germany where their children, Ricardo, Adolfo, and N√©lida, continued studying music. Ricardo studied at the Academy of Music in Berlin from 1928 and in 1931 studied violin under Carl Flesch and composition under Paul Hindemith. At the end of his studies, at the age of just 17, he first appeared as a soloist with the Berlin Philharmonic Orchestra under Erich Kleiber. In 1932 he won the second prize at the prestigious Violin Competition in Vienna and in 1937 the second prize in the Eug√®ne Ysa√øe Competition in Brussels. David Oistrakh, who took first prize, reported in a letter to his wife from the Brussels competition: \\"... when I arrived, Odnoposoff played Tchaikovsky. He played wonderfully.\\" Odnoposoff was already a follower of Arnold Ros√©, concertmaster of the Vienna Philharmonic Orchestra, and taught at the State Academy, where Norbert Brainin, the future leader of the Amadeus Quartet was one of his students. In 1933, without an audition, Clemens Krauss, director of the Vienna State Opera, offered the 19-year-old Odnoposoff a position as concertmaster.  Exile  After the Anschluss (annexation of Austria into Nazi Germany), Odnoposoff was unable to produce an Ariernachweis (Aryan certificate). He was therefore dismissed on September 1, 1938 from the Orchestra of the Vienna State Opera and the Vienna Philharmonic and had to return to Argentina. In the early 1940s Odnoposoff moved to the United States, where he gave his Carnegie Hall debut in 1944. According to the New York Times, Odnoposoff \\"took his audience by storm by the virtuosity, power and fire of his performances.\\" During this time he worked with conductors such as Leonard Bernstein, Arturo Toscanini, Fritz Busch and Andr√© Cluytens and worked as a teacher. In 1953 he became an American citizen.  Return to Austria  In 1956 he returned to Vienna and taught until 1993 at the Academy of Music, where Joseph Sivo was one of his students. He produced some recordings with the WDR Symphony Orchestra Cologne under Franz Marszalek, including the Violin Concerto no. 22 of Viotti. From 1964 Odnoposoff also taught at the University of Music and Performing Arts Stuttgart, where, among others, Michael Jelden, Alfred Csammer, Michael Eichinger, Helmut Mebert and Rainer Kussmaul were among his pupils. From 1975 to 1984 he taught at the Academy of Music in Zurich. Odnoposoff played on the \\"ex Ladenburg\\" Guarneri del Ges√π of 1735. His violin playing was outstanding with a great sonorous, yet mellow sound, with masterly mastery of technique. Many of his photographs reflect the great joy that lay behind his playing. His grave is located in Vienna on the Grinzinger Cemetery (Group 19, no. 36A).

History The first section of the Merthyr, Tredegar and Abergavenny Railway from Abergavenny to was opened on 29 September 1862. The line was leased and operated by the London and North Western Railway which acquired the smaller railway company on 30 June 1866. On 1 March 1864, the line was extended from Brynmawr to Nantybwch where a station was opened. Initially named Tredegar, it was renamed Nantybwch on 1 November 1868, the day before the public opening of the northward extension from of the Sirhowy Railway which had its own Tredegar station. The station was reached by the nine-arch Blaen-y-Cwm viaduct. It was situated to the north of the small settlement from which it took its name and to the north-west of the local school. Road access was via an unmade up lane reached by passing staff cottages adjacent to the line. Situated at above sea level, the station was situated in a desolate and bleak landscape. To the west the three miles to were at a gradient of 1 in 35, whilst to Sirhowy the gradients varied between 1 in 42 and 1 in 37. Single-engine loads between Rhymney and Nantybwch were restricted to 12 loaded wagons only. Four platform faces were provided: two platforms either side of a curving island platform, a bay platform for Sirhowy services and a platform for Merthyr services. The Merthyr platform was adjacent to the road entrance and the platform building incorporated a ticket office and porters' room. A weather-boarded footbridge linked the platforms which were lit by Sugg's Rochester pattern gaslights. On the island platform was No. 1 signal box which was completed in 1891 and remained in use until 1959. On the Down island platform until 1929 was the Area Traffic Control Office near No. 1 box until it was relocated to . On the Up side was a water column fed from a brick-lined reservoir. Beyond the station to the west was No. 2 box which was stone-built and of Rhymney Railway design; it controlled the goods sidings adjacent to the double track which were used for stabling and running around stock after closure of the line to the west. Colliers' coaches were also stored here for the Sirhowy trains. As a result of decline in the local industry and the costs of working the line between Abergavenny and Merthyr, passenger and goods services ceased on 4 January 1958. The last passenger service over the line was an SLS railtour on 5 January 1958 hauled by GWR 6959 No. 7912 Little Linford Hall. Final closure of Nantybwch came on 13 June 1960 with the withdrawal of the Sirhowy services,; the last timetable showing three trains on weekdays from Tredegar. The final day of operations was in fact the previous Saturday 11 June when GWR 5700 No. 3634 worked the last Up train from Tredegar at 4.32pm and the last Down at 4.50pm with No. 8711. The last train was the 6.33pm from to Tredegar which had been extended to Nantybwch and departed from there at 7.52pm. Earlier in the day there had been a rare Saturday excursion special from Brynmawr to which called at Nantybwch. Present The site of the station has been lost under the A465 road.

Mechanisms of blood clotting Edward Rubenstein was an Internal Medicine physician, with areas of expertise which included clotting disorders that predispose to pulmonary embolism. Stanford Synchrotron Radiation Project In the early 1970s Stanford University marked a landmark period in particle physics research with the creation of the colliding beam storage ring, called the Stanford Positron Electron Accelerating Ring (SPEAR) in 1972. Among the famous discoveries were the J/psi and tau particles. A byproduct of the ring's operation was an intense beam of synchrotron radiation. Rubenstein and his colleagues E. Barrie Hughes and Robert Hofstadter posited that there may be numerous applications of this intensely powerful, tuneable, and linearly polarized radiation to biomedical imaging, including intravenous coronary arteriography. They devised a synchrotron radiation based imaging system which has been used worldwide. Rubenstein proposed that the polarized synchrotron light which is emitted by relativistic electrons orbiting neutron stars (linear in the plane of rotation, with opposite helicity above and below the plane) would selectively photolyze chiral molecules floating on grains in nearby space. This mechanism would produce an enantiomeric excess of either right- or left-handed molecules which can be delivered to Earth by passing comets. Nonprotein amino acids In addition, Rubenstein pioneered research on the consequences of the misincorporation of nonprotein amino acids, especially the lower homologue of proline, azetidine-2-carboxylic acid (Aze). This compound eludes the gate-keeping function of the prolyl tRNAs, and enters a wide range of proteins. For instance, the central region in a consensus epitope of myelin basic protein consists of the sequence: proline, arginine, threonine, proline, proline, proline. Dairy milk from cattle fed sugar beet byproducts is high in Aze, therefore infants fed such milk are exposed to Aze in their diets.

W. 1996. Niebla and Vermilacinia (Ramalinaceae) from California and Baja California. Sida Bot. Misc. 14 The epithet, limicola is in reference to the thallus growing on barren (alkali) soil. Distinguishing Features Niebla limicola is distinguished by a hemispherical thallus lying loose on soil without a central holdfast (terricolous), divided into variously shaped branches, partly narrow in length and prismatic in cross section, and partly flattened and dilated from which short acicular bifurcating branchlets arise, the thallus up to 10 cm high and 15 cm across. The species (N. limicola) also recognized by containing salazinic acid (without triterpenes), and by a relatively thin cortex, (0-)45‚Äì75 ¬µm thick, appearing to erode on dilated parts of branches; the thinner cortex evidently related to the contorted appearance of the branches in addition to the medulla being partly hollow (fistulose). The species (N. limicola) is most similar to Niebla flabellata, which differs by its thallus growing on rocks attached to a holdfast at base, and by the irregular lacerations of the thallus branches, instead of the regular bifurcations of acicular branches that develop in N. limicola. Niebla arenaria, which is also similar in the terricolous habit and by the bifurcate branchlets, differs by the mostly linearLinear: having parallel sides for a length of at least 10 times that of the width shape of the branches. Taxonomic History Niebla limicola was recognized as a distinct species by three individuals on separate occasions before the species was described by Richard Spjut in 1996. Gerhard Follman, a specialist in the taxonomy of the genus Ramalina, which included Niebla, the family Roccellaceae, and other lichen groups, who was at Guerrero Negro on 3 January 1989 during a winter 1989-90 lichen expedition headed by Thomas Nash III for the project‚ÄîGreater Sonoran Desert Lichen FloraGreater Sonoran Desert Lichen Flora: Field Trip Locations: Field Trip Locations, Lichen Herbarium, http://nhc.asu.edu/lherbarium/flora/locations.php collected and photographed specimens he sent in 1993 to Richard Spjut who had been conducting a taxonomic revision of the genus.Spjut, R. W. 1990. Lichens of Baja California (Mexico) I. The Niebla complex. Am. J. Bot. 77: 155‚Äì156.Spjut, R. W. 1994. What is a species of Niebla? Am. J. Bot. 81:11. Spjut had also collected it (N. limicola) earlier at Guerrero Negro on 20 April 1990 (type). Additionally, his field partner, Richard Marin, while acting as a tour guide in Baja California to Scammon‚Äôs Lagoon on 15 Feb 1991, recognized it as possibly distinct from what he had recalled seeing during lichen expeditions he had accompanied Richard Spjut to Baja California (1985‚Äì1987, 1989‚Äì1990), collected a specimen (Marin & Spjut 11916) and gave it to Spjut in March 1991 as they traveled again to Baja California. This specimen was cited, along with Follmann‚Äôs specimen, in the taxonomic revision of the genus Niebla with Follmann included as coauthority for the species name. Although the species (N. limicola) was independently recognized as possibly new by three individuals, and subsequently described as new in 1996, it was later included in synonymy with the earlier name Niebla josecuervoi in the Lichen Flora of the Greater Sonoran Desert, without a revised description for Niebla josecuervoi, except for reference made to description of Niebla homalea.Bowler, P. and J. Marsh. 2004. Niebla. ‚ÄòLichen Flora of the Greater Sonoran Desert 2‚Äô: 368‚Äì380. Essentially, only two or three species in the genus Niebla were described. Niebla, as defined by Spjut, has a two-layered cortex, isolated chondroid strands in the medulla, and lichen substances predominantly depsides with triterpenes differing from those in Vermilacinia or depsidones lacking the terpenes.Spjut R.

It was designed by Ernest Gunderson and built in 1919. It was added to the Queensland Heritage Register on 3 October 2005.  History  Pinkenba War Memorial is located on a small triangular portion of land at the intersection of McBride Road and Eagle Farm Road at Pinkenba. It was unveiled on 16 August 1919, by His Excellency Governor Sir Hamilton Goold-Adams. It was erected to commemorate the men from the district who had served during World War I. A small community existed at Pinkenba as early as the 1860s when the residents began discussing the need for a school in the district. A formal application for a school, lodged in 1874, listed 22 families with children living in the area. The early residents largely comprised small farmers, many of them of German origin. From the late nineteenth century, the abattoir of the Queensland Meat Export Company was located at Pinkenba and it remained a major employer in the district until after WWI. The wharves, servicing passenger and freight ships, were also a hub of commercial activity. In 1897, a rail link was provided to service the wharves, industries and residents of Pinkenba. Australian troops on board the Omrah (ship) at Pinkenba Wharf, circa 1915 During WWI, the Pinkenba wharves were the point of embarkation for many Australian troops, including members of the Australian Light Horse. Pupils from the local school visited the wharves to farewell soldiers from the district. The Pinkenba War Memorial records the names of 42 men who enlisted, eight of whom are listed as fallen. The memorial was designed and constructed by the Queensland firm of Ernest Gunderson. Gunderson was a skilled tradesman of Norwegian extraction whose firm specialized in the manufacture of bronze honour boards. The firm operated until the mid 1930s and supplied memorials all over Queensland. His best-known and largest memorial is in the main street of Gayndah. At the time of its unveiling, it was described as one of the finest in the State. Commemorating the servicemen from the district Gunderson individually moulded decorative devices for his honour boards and these make them quite distinctive as a Queensland type. The Pinkenba monument features similar devices including an artillery shell encircled by a wreath. There were also a series of statuettes fixed to the monument that were removed, probably before World War II. These included mounted light horsemen located on each corner above the columns and a statuette of a soldier that stood to the north of the dome. In 1983, Brisbane City Council plumbers and sheet metal workers repaired some of the damage sustained by the monument. However, important elements including the statuettes and some lettering remain lost. In the 1960s, the character of Pinkenba changed. Many residents moved out of the area as homes were resumed to make way for proposed Eagle Farm Airport expansion. More heavy industry moved into the suburb. The War Memorial remains a vestige of the earlier more residential character of the area.  Description  The monument stands on a small, grassed triangular portion of road reserve at the corner of Eagle Farm and McBride Roads, Pinkenba. Approximately high, it stands within a grassed area defined by a white painted concrete curb supporting a fence of hollow metal poles linked by metal chain. A flagstaff stands to the north within the fenced area. The bronze memorial is supported on a plinth of cast rusticated- finish concrete blocks. A pedestal, similar in form to the base of a truncated obelisk comprising beaten panels with a Doric column at each corner sits on top of the plinth. It supports a square platform surmounted by a small dome. An upright artillery shell, hung with a frail bronze wreath, projects from the dome. South Panel with the names of the fallen The sides of the pedestal bear the memorial inscription and the names of the enlisted and fallen. The panel to the north bears the inscription in relief lettering; the south panel contains the names of the fallen, each an individual name plate within a decorative honour scroll; the east and west panels contain the individual name plates for the enlisted. A landscaped area incorporating trees, garden bed and park furniture is situated near the fence of the neighbouring property to the north of the monument area. A seat, picnic table, tap and large, green metal utility box in this area are not of cultural heritage significance.  Heritage listing  Pinkenba War Memorial was listed on the Queensland Heritage Register on 3 October 2005 having satisfied the following criteria. The place is important in demonstrating the evolution or pattern of Queensland's history. The Pinkenba War Memorial is important in demonstrating part of the pattern of Queensland's history, being associated with the national outpouring of grief at the deaths of about 60,000 Australians during WWI. During an era of strong and widespread Australian patriotism and nationalism most Queensland communities erected a public memorial to honour local participation in the war. Each monument is a unique historical documentary record. The place is important in demonstrating the principal characteristics of a particular class of cultural places. The memorial is important in exemplifying many of the elements common to WWI memorials in a form that is unusual for its type. Designed as a tangible place of memory to act as a focus for public mourning in the absence of graves, the memorial displays the names of the enlisted and the dead, it is designed to endure and it is set in an area large enough to accommodate ceremonial occasions. However, the memorial demonstrates a form that is unusual for WWI memorials in that it is composed of an unusual combination of classical and non-traditional elements. The place is important because of its aesthetic significance. Together with its setting, the memorial makes a significant aesthetic contribution to the townscape of Pinkenba. It is visually striking and it is located prominently in a verdant setting. The place has a strong or special association with a particular community or cultural group for social, cultural or spiritual reasons. The memorial is of social and spiritual significance for the local community, having a strong and continuing association with the community as evidence of the impact of a major historical event and as the focus for annual remembrance of that event in local Anzac Day commemorative ceremonies. The place has a special association with the life or work of a particular person, group or organisation of importance in Queensland's history. It is also significant as an example of the work of Ernest Gunderson, the well-known Queensland manufacturer and supplier of honour boards and memorials.

He joined the French Royal Army and fought in the American Revolutionary War as a foot soldier. In 1792 he was appointed officer of a volunteer battalion. He fought the Spanish in the War of the Pyrenees and was promoted to general officer. Later he was transferred to fight French royalists in the War in the Vend√©e. In 1800 he was assigned to the Army of the Rhine and led a brigade at Stockach, Messkirch and Biberach. Shortly after, he was transferred to Italy. In 1805 he fought under Andr√© Mass√©na at Caldiero. He participated in the 1806 Invasion of Naples and led his troops against the British at Maida where his brigade put up a sturdy resistance. After briefly serving in the 1809 war, he took command of Modena and died there of illness in 1811. He never married. Early career On 23 January 1763 Digonet was born at Crest, a town in what later became the Dr√¥me department in southeastern France. Son of surgeon Joseph Digonet, he was sent to study medicine at Montpellier. He soon quit school, enlisted in the √éle-de- France Regiment when he was 16 years old and was shipped off to America in the army of Jean-Baptiste Donatien de Vimeur, comte de Rochambeau. He was wounded in the leg during the Siege of Yorktown in 1781. Continuing in the service, he advanced in rank to corporal in January 1787, sergeant in October 1789 and finally to sergeant major in 1792. French Revolution In October 1792 he was appointed adjutant major in the 2nd Battalion of the Landes Volunteers. On 1 May 1793 he was named to command the 4th Battalion of Landes Volunteers. He took part in several actions against the Spanish during the War of the Pyrenees. On 5 February 1794 he was wounded in the right arm at the Battle of Sans Culotte Camp. In this action, a Spanish army of 13,000 infantry and 700 cavalry and gunners was repulsed by Louis Dubouquet and the Army of the Western Pyrenees after a seven-hour struggle. On 14 April 1794 Digonet received promotion to general of brigade and was assigned to the division led by Jean-Antoine Marbot. Bon-Adrien de Moncey sent Digonet to attack Mt. Arquinzu. On 10 July 1794, Digonet led 4,000 troops in action at Monte Arquinzu.Smith (1998), p. 87 Bon-Adrien Jeannot de Moncey planned to surround the position, which was apparently his favorite tactic. Digonet was supposed to mount a frontal attack while a second column led by Th√©ophile Corret de la Tour d'Auvergne cut off the enemy's retreat. In the event, Digonet attacked too soon but his adversaries were nevertheless beaten and forced to flee.Phipps (2011), p. 190 The defenders included one battalion each of the Spanish Zamora Infantry Regiment and the French √âmigr√© Royal Legion. The enemy suffered 314 casualties while their commander Claude-Anne de Rouvroy de Saint Simon was shot in the chest but survived and escaped. Not as lucky were 49 captured French Royalists who were executed according to the policy of the French Revolutionary government. The next major operation was the Battle of the Baztan Valley on 23 July followed by the seizure of Fuenterrabia on 1 August with 2,000 prisoners and 200 cannons. Moncey continued west to capture San Sebasti√°n on 2 August, capturing another 1,700 Spanish troops and 90 artillery pieces.Smith (1998), p. 88 Digonet participated in all three combats.Mullie (1852). The source calls the three operations Bidassoa, Fontarabie and Saint-S√©bastien. The Army of the Western Pyrenees only contributed one Marshal to Napoleon's First French Empire and that was Moncey.Phipps (2011), p. 133 For the most part, the army did not have very distinguished soldiers. Of the army's division commanders, only Henri Fran√ßois Delaborde had long service under Napoleon.Phipps (2011), p. 212 The better- known officers were Digonet, Sextius Alexandre Fran√ßois de Miollis, Pierre Hugues Victoire Merle, Jean Maximilien Lamarque and Jean Isidore Harispe. Jean Castelbert de Castelverd fell into disgrace in 1796.Phipps (2011), pp. 210‚Äì211 After the Peace of Basel in 1795, the army was broken up and a column of 10,955 set out to join the Army of the West to fight the War in the Vend√©e.Phipps (2011), p. 209 Digonet was among those transferred to the Vend√©e. In the 1795‚Äì96 campaign, his troops defeated Fran√ßois de Charette's insurgents near Saint-Fulgent and forced them to flee. Later Charette was captured by Jean-Pierre Travot's troops. Digonet also beat Jean-Nicolas Stofflet's band. After Lazare Hoche pacified the rebellious regions he gave Digonet high praise in his report to the French government. In 1796‚Äì98, Digonet commanded the departments of Charente-Inf√©rieure and Deux-S√®vres. In the subsequent Chouan revolt, he forced Louis-Auguste-Victor, Count de Ghaisnes de Bourmont's insurrectionists to abandon Le Mans and recaptured a large number of cannons after beating a second rebel group in the Sarthe department. In 1800 Digonet was assigned to the Army of the Rhine under Jean Victor Marie Moreau and fought at the Battle of Stockach-Engen. Digonet and Pierre Fran√ßois Joseph Durutte were the two brigadiers in the division of Antoine Richepanse in the Army Reserve. The division was made up of the 4th, 50th and 100th Line Infantry Demi Brigades, the 13th Cavalry, 17th Dragoon and 5th Hussar Regiments and a combined grenadier battalion for a total of 6,848 foot and 1,187 horse.Smith (1998), p. 178 At the Battle of Messkirch on 5 May 1800, Moreau brought the Reserve into action late in the day. Austrian commander Paul Kray launched an attack that threatened to cut the Stockach road. Richepanse arrived on the battlefield and took Ignaz Gyulai's division in flank, driving it back. Kray gave up his effort to break down the French flank and retreated to the Danube at Sigmaringen. Digonet was present at the Battle of Biberach on 9 May. While Moreau took charge of the left wing, Laurent Gouvion Saint-Cyr took his own corps plus the Reserve and attacked the Austrians at Biberach an der Riss. The move was successful and the French captured the Austrian supply base in the city.Dodge (2011), p. 224 Digonet was reassigned to lead a brigade in Jean Fran√ßois Cornu de La Poype's division and sent to Italy via the Gotthard Pass. The divisions of La Poype and Jean Thomas Guillaume Lorge were part of Moncey's corps as of 24 May 1800. In December, Digonet led a brigade consisting of the 67th Line Infantry Demi Brigade and a unit of converged grenadiers in a division commanded by Donatien-Marie-Joseph de Vimeur, vicomte de Rochambeau. This was in Guillaume Brune's Army of Italy. During these operations, Digonet drove the Austrians from the town of Bormio in the Valtellina. In support of Brune's campaign, he and his brigade cleared 800 Tyrolese by surprise from two mountain passes on 23 December 1800 and entered Riva del Garda. Brune won the Battle of Pozzolo on 25 December 1800.Smith (1998), p. 192 Empire Digonet fought under Andr√© Mass√©na in 1805‚Äì06. After Napoleon became emperor, Digonet was made a member of the L√©gion d'Honneur on 16 October 1803. He was made a commander of the L√©gion d'Honneur on 14 June 1804. In the War of the Third Coalition he was assigned to lead troops in Andr√© Mass√©na's Army of Italy. He commanded the 1st Brigade in Jean-Antoine Verdier's division, consisting of three battalions each of the 23rd Light and the 10th Line Infantry Regiments. In late October 1805, Mass√©na massed 23,400 foot, 700 horse and 72 guns on the east bank of the Adige River near Verona with Verdier's 6,600 foot and 1,000 horse on the west bank. The French were outnumbered by Archduke Charles, Duke of Teschen who had 44,000 infantry and 6,500 cavalry. Under orders from Napoleon to keep Charles occupied, Mass√©na determined to attack. While making a frontal assault with his east bank troops, the French general planned to have Verdier cross the Adige and attack the Austrian left flank. Complicating the situation, Paul Davidovich was downstream with 10,000 more Austrians.Schneid (2002), pp. 31‚Äì32 In the Battle of Caldiero on 30 October, Verdier put one infantry regiment across the river, but when Davidovich made a threatening move, he was compelled to hold the bulk of his men on the west bank while the two armies fought a drawn battle. On the 31st, Verdier managed to get his entire division across the Adige and launched his attack around noon. Digonet's brigade on the right drove back a screen of Grenz infantry but was then counterattacked by Joseph Armand von Nordmann's division. Nordmann was wounded but his soldiers pushed Digonet's men back after a musketry duel. Verdier tried to send help from his left brigade, but that unit was beaten and compelled to retreat toward the river crossing site. Disaster loomed until a regiment of Chasseurs √† Cheval charged the Austrians, keeping them from crushing Verdier's division. The combat ended at 5:00 PM that afternoon.Schneid (2002), pp. 39‚Äì40 Digonet participated in the 1806 invasion of Naples. At the Battle of Maida on 4 July 1806, Digonet led a brigade in Jean Reynier's division. His command included two battalions of the 1,266-strong 23rd Light Infantry Regiment, 328 sabers of the 9th Chasseurs √† Cheval Regiment and several artillery pieces manned by 112 gunners.Schneid (2002), pp. 175‚Äì177 Reynier's division attacked the British with brigades under Louis Fursy Henri Comp√®re and Luigi Gaspare Peyri echeloned forward by the left. Comp√®re's charge was met by devastating British musketry and dispersed with heavy losses. Many of Peyri's troops became involved in the rout though a Swiss battalion kept its order and rallied on Digonet's brigade. Enemy brigades under Lowry Cole, Wroth Palmer Acland and John Oswald converged on Digonet's troops but were stopped when the 9th Chasseurs made a series of partial charges, forcing the British to deploy into squares. Finally, a newly arrived British regiment broke the stalemate by attacking from a new direction and Digonet conducted a retreat.Schneid (2002), pp. 53‚Äì54 Digonet held a command in Italy in August 1809 during the War of the Fifth Coalition. Assigned to command at Modena, he was stricken with disease and died there on 17 March 1811, unmarried and childless.
