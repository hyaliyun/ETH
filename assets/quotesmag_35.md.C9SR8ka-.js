She won four Grammy Awards, and received nine Grammy nominations over the course of her career, including two wins and five nominations for Classical Producer of the Year.  Early life  Nickrenz was born in Seattle to Herbert C. and Mary Volz and had four older siblings (two brothers and two sisters). A year after her birth, her family moved to Bremerton, Washington, where they had lived previously. Her father worked at the naval shipyard. Nickrenz learned piano on an upright piano given to the family. She graduated from Bremerton High School in 1953 and went on to study piano at University of Washington. According to her daughter, Erika, Nickrenz moved to New York City \\"\\"to seek her fame and fortune on the piano.\\" As a performer, Nickrenz was a member of the Pittsburgh Symphony Orchestra and performed with the New Chamber Quintet and the Claremont String Quartet. The Claremont String Quartet hired her to record an Arnold Schoenberg piece, \\"Ode to Napoleon,\\" which led to her interest in recording.  Elite Recordings  Nickrenz was hired as an assistant at Elite Recordings, owned by Marc Aubort. Elite was started in 1965. She worked as an engineer, producer, and editor, and went on to become a full partner in the company. Aubort said of Nickrenz, \\"Her ears were legendary; she was nicknamed 'Ms. Razorears.'\\" Aubort and Nickrenz worked together for 32 years, doing about 20 projects a year. They did a series of recordings with American orchestras in the 1960s and 1970s for Vox Records. Another notable series of recordings was for Nonesuch Records with Joan Morris and William Bolcom. They worked with 45 composers, including Leonard Slatkin. While their counterparts in the 1960s and 1970s were doing multi-microphone/multi-tracked recordings, the pair decided to continue with a more simple and natural approach using fewer microphones. Their approach was sometimes more difficult and time consuming but the results were recognized for their natural sound quality. Her final recording session was in October 2001 with clarinetist Giora Feidman.  Personal life  Joanna Nickrenz died of lung cancer in 2002. She was a lifelong smoker. Nickrenz was married to Scott Nickrenz, a violist who she played with in the New Chamber Quintet. He was a founding member of the Lenox, Claremont and Vermeer String Quartets. He also was a founding member of the Orpheus Trio and directed chamber music for the New World Symphony. Their daughter, Erika Nickrenz, is a pianist who started playing at age six. She made her debut at New York's Town Hall at age 11. Erika Nickrenz received a Bachelor and Master of Music from the Juilliard School and is a member of the Eroica Trio. Joanna Nickrenz produced five of the Eroica Trio's albums.

Biography takahƒì by Lily Attey Daff Kea, The Avicultural magazine 1932 Daff was born in Upton, London, on 16 March 1885. She took courses in drawing and painting at the London Polytechnic but was also known to have completed at least one course at King Edward Technical College in Dunedin. After her polytechnic training, Daff worked as an illustrator for Christmas card producer Raphael Tuck and Sons. Daff arrived in Otago in 1926 and obtained work with the Government Publicity Department. Daff was the Officer in Charge of Exhibitions at Otago Museum, painting dioramas, reorganising and decorating the galleries, designing displays, posters, and producing guide-books. Daff was on staff at the museum for 12 years in total. Her obituary claims her chief contribution to scientific education was in the travelling cases which circulated throughout the museums of New Zealand, however now she is mostly known for her illustrations of New Zealand birds. Daff's line illustrations were considered by the Otago Daily Times to turn the newly published guide Introducing the Otago Museum into a \\"minor collector's item\\". In June 1932 Daff left Dunedin for Wellington, to fulfill a commission for the New Zealand Bird Protection Society to paint a series of pictures of New Zealand native birds. Daff illustrated Walter Oliver's book on New Zealand birds and P√©rrine Moncrieff's New Zealand Birds and How to Identify Them. Her copies of drawings by J W Barnicoat are in the Hocken Collections, as are a painting of a takahe and other unfinished natural history studies. Daff also supplied hundreds of line drawings to illustrate research publications on ethnography, many of which can be seen online in the Journal of the Polynesian Society. The paintings Daff completed for the New Zealand Bird Protection Society have been published in books and as journal covers many times, and the original paintings are now in the Alexander Turnbull Library. Lily Attey Daff died on 3 May 1945. Her middle name, commonly spelled Atty, shows as Attey on her birth certificate.

During her artistic career she worked with the West Baffin Eskimo Co-operative in Cape Dorset, Nunavut.  Artistic career  Pudlat began drawing in the late 1950s alongside her husband Pudlo Pudlat, after an arm injury made it difficult for him to practice his then-preferred artistic medium of carving. The pair were encouraged to do so by Inuit art pioneer James Archibald Houston and Terry Ryan, who later became manager of the West Baffin Eskimo Co-Operative. Pudlat's works were often made using stonecut printmaking methods, and sometimes seal skin stencil on paper. Her prints focus on playful renderings of animals living in the Cape Dorset area, such as owls, Canada geese, rabbits, and walruses. Her works also depict activities of daily life in Cape Dorset, including hunting, fishing, and singing.  Personal life  Pudlat was widowed from her first marriage. In 1950, she formally married Pudlo Pudlat, a well-known and prolific Inuk graphic artist. Together, the pair had six children, of whom three daughters survived. In 1957, Innukjuakju and Pudlo moved to Cape Dorset to access healthcare for Pudlo, who had sustained an arm injury from a hunting accident. Pudlat's artistic career continued until she became ill in 1970. She died in Cape Dorset on March 30, 1972.

Biography Most icons of the old churches in Kragujevac are the work of zograf (painter) Jovan Stergeviƒá (sometimes also spelled Sterijeviƒá), best known by his nickname Janja Moler, who left Old Serbia in the early 1820s and settled with his family at Kragujevac. There he earned the trust of Milos Obrenovic who employed him as his court artist and commissioned him to paint his foundation, the Church of the Holy See. He painted many iconostasis and icons in various churches throughout Serbia, such as the Topƒçider Church, Soko Banja, Smederevska Palanka, Osipaonica, Jagodina, Savinca, Pozarevac, and others. The iconostases in the Wooden church of Brzan (built in 1822) and the Church of Archangel Gabriel in Bagrdan (built in 1833) were painted Jovan Stergevic. It is supposed that some icons of the same churches belong to Janja's sons Mihailo, Nikola, and Jovan (Jr.). Nikola died before his father (before 1841), but his brothers Mihailo and Jovan continued to occupy themselves with their father's business, signing their icons as the Moleroviƒá brothers. Probably the brothers lived in Kragujevac until 1842, after which they moved to Belgrade.

History South Korea's previous attempts at hosting motorsport events include the Korean Grand Prix situated at Yeongam, which ran from 2010 to 2013. Low attendance figures, five hours of traveling time from Seoul and unfulfilled resort facilities around the track were the main reasons for the event's short existence. On 30 November 2018, Formula E CEO, Alejandro Agag signed an agreement with Moon Jae-sik, chairman of JSM Holdings. South Korea was given the right to hold the ABB Formula E Championship from 2020 to 2025. The aim is to expand the Asian market and provide a platform for cooperation between Formula E and South Korean automobile industrial technology and eco- friendly innovations. The Formula E race will be served as an annual attraction for motor sport fans from nearby countries such as China and Japan. Three other candidates in the Asia-Pacific region considered for hosting included Australia, Russia, and New Zealand. The inaugural Seoul ePrix was cancelled in response to the COVID-19 pandemic.

It was designed by Peter Kerr of the colonial Public Works Department and built in 1870-71. It was added to the Australian Commonwealth Heritage List on 8 November 2011.  History  The Kyneton Post Office was constructed in 1870-71. The need for a new building was brought to the attention of the authorities by the agitation of local residents in May 1869, however, the Postmaster General responded in November of that year that there was no possibility that a new building would be constructed. This decision was altered in 1870, with the Shire Council being advised of the intention to build a new post office. Further local agitation, led by prominent residents the Hon. William Henry Fancourt Mitchell and Martin McKenna MLA, pressed for the inclusion of a clock tower in the building's design. After a number of deputations to the Postmaster General a decision was made to include the clock tower, providing that all additional costs above ¬£1,700 were met by local residents and the Shire Council. The new post office was finished in December 1871, complete with a four-dial clock, made by Charles Prebble, a Kyneton watch and clock maker and jeweller. The building underwent unidentified improvement works in 1878 and 1881, and a new telegraph room in the building opened in 1885. An additional single-storey bay was constructed 1893 to south side of original building and building lit with kerosene lamps. (It is possible this stage of works was actually completed in 1885 as part of the new telegraph room facility). Kerosene lamps were replaced by gas fittings in 1895. In 1910s-20s, the 1890s single-storey bay was further added to, extending the building alignment to southern boundary and losing the original southern garden setting. The skillion roof form of the loggia was altered to a parapet form. Between the 1940s and 1960s, it underwent phases of general refurbishment of the building including lighting, strapped plaster ceilings at ground floor level, acoustic ceilings at first floor level; construction of first floor amenities area north of main stair; alterations to door opening from first floor stair hall to front room; construction of timber-framed partition to create passage to clock tower access at first floor level; fire escape stair constructed in rear yard. The northern bay of the loggia was infilled and incorporated into the internal space at some stage prior to 1957. An automatic telephone exchange was constructed in the rear yard 1968. In 1975, the postal and telephone functions area was subdivided and private letter boxes were installed in the front loggia. A disabled access ramp at the northern end of the loggia was constructed 1980s, with removal of the loggia infill. Construction of na ew free-standing private letter box building to north of main building took place in 1990, including covered link to original north side entrance. In 1997, the post shop was refurbished, including new display units, angled counters, lighting, carpet.  Description  Kyneton Post Office is at 113 Mollison Street, Kyneton, comprising the whole of Lot 1 LP218661. The large rectangular site is located in Kyneton's main civic and commercial precinct at the prominent intersection of Mollison and Jennings streets. The surrounding streetscape reflects the town's mid- nineteenth century origins and the influence of gold on the subsequent development of the place. Limited redevelopment of the area since the turn of the twentieth century has maintained a strong heritage character. The adjoining sections of Mollison Street contain the Shire Hall, National Bank and Bank of Victoria (all 1870s) and the Bank of New South Wales (1880s and 1900s). The original site has been subdivided with the post office located on the eastern half, fronting Mollison Street and the 1960s telephone exchange occupying the western portion, fronting Jennings Street. The rear yard, located between the post office and the exchange to the west, is concrete paved with vehicular access from Jennings Street. The yard is screened by a non-original concrete brick wall and steel gates and contains a small free- standing store and bicycle shed at the northwest corner. Originally landscaped as the post master's private yard, the area to the north of the original building was developed in 1990 with the construction of a single-storey brick building providing private letter boxes. The original post office and residence component is constructed to the eastern Mollison Street boundary alignment which was extended southwards in two phases (c.1893 and 1910s-20s) to the Jennings Street boundary with a parapeted single-storey form. The square clock tower element marks the original southeast corner of the building. The principal double storey wing extends parallel to Mollison Street with the original single-storey service wing forming a T-shaped plan towards the centre of the site. The asymmetrical double-storey postal wing is the principal element in the composition, and is screened at street level by a (now parapeted) four-bay loggia. The main roof is hipped slate and is complemented by a mansard clock tower roof which retains original cast iron widow's walk and flagpole. The main entrance to the building is from the loggia via the ground level of the clock tower which contains wrought iron gates with narrow slot openings on all visible faces at the ground and first levels. Above this level are paired arched lancet openings in each elevation of the third level and clock faces at the fourth level. Each face of the mansard roof is punctuated by a small louvered gablet. Simple struck and moulded string courses define the walls throughout the building and the lines of the 1890s and 1920s additions to the south are reflected in the later loggia parapet. Fenestration throughout is regular and repetitive with single window openings with arched heads and moulded archivolts. In plan form, the post office has three main sections which relate to the original design for a combined post office and residence, augmented by a fourth section which comprises the two additions to the southern side. The entrance provides access to the main post shop area (1880s addition, former telegraph room?). To the north of this, within the original building, are the mail room and various sorting areas and staff offices located in what appears to have been the original post and telegraph offices which would have been served by windows opening to the public loggia. To the west of this wing is the main stair hall, which is accessed via the original private side entrance, and further west is the original service wing which now contains a lunch room, contractors' room and store. It would appear that some alterations have occurred around the side entrance at both levels in order to accommodate the later first floor amenities. The main stair provides access to the first floor residence which appears to have contained a large sitting room and two or three bedrooms, one of which has been subdivided to provide a separate passage to the clock tower. To the north of the main stair is a non-original toilet block. The building's frame is made of load-bearing masonry construction with timber-framed floor and roof structure. The external walls are of solid brick construction with rendered finish on rock-faced bluestone plinth with tooled margins; various tooled and moulded course lines which extend continuously at impost level into simply moulded archivolts. The internal walls are hard plastered and painted brickwork to external and partition walls; some areas have moulded dado lines. The floors are timber boards on timber-framed structure; Victorian profile moulded timber skirting boards, and the ceilings are lathe and plaster with square set cornice [and possibly various moulded cornices and ceiling roses. The roof is hipped with slate finish to principal building and kitchen wing, minimal eaves overhang, rendered brick chimneys with moulded caps; mansard roof form to clock tower with bracketed cornice, cast iron widows' walk and flagpole. Other building features include the four-arched arcade loggia with skillion roof form finished with corrugated galvanised iron roofing; cast iron Corinthian order pilasters to loggia on sawn bluestone plinths; Four clock faces and mechanism manufactured by Charles Prebble; timber post and picket fences; round-arched timber-framed double-hung sash windows and four-panelled timber doors throughout; moulded timber architraves; dressed bluestone thresholds; polished timber stair and balustrade.  Condition  Externally, Kyneton Post Office's ability to demonstrate its original design is generally very good with regard to the external form and fabric, despite a number of stages of alteration (dating from very early in the building's history). Internally, the building's intactness has been somewhat reduced owing to changes in program and building use. These are manifested in alterations to the plan form and general refurbishment in fabric such as renewal of finishes, replacement or concealment of original ceilings, removal of fireplaces and fittings. Externally and internally, the condition of the building is generally sound with no major structural defects visible, however original fabric is being impacted on by mechanical damage throughout the mail sorting and delivery areas and falling damp and pigeon damage in the southern parts of the first floor areas. The provision of mechanical services from the plant through the mail sorting area is intrusive. The roof space and clock tower were not inspected.  Heritage listing  Kyneton Post Office was listed on the Australian Commonwealth Heritage List on 8 November 2011 with the following rationale: The form, scale and quality of the Kyneton Post Office, constructed on a prominent corner site in the central commercial precinct in 1870-1, emphasises its status as an essential element in the communications of the broader district at a time when Kyneton was an important regional centre in Victoria's central goldfields. Despite alterations, Kyneton Post Office is a fine example of a mid-Victorian second generation combined post and telegraph office and residence. The broadly intact original form, fabric and planning including elements such as the colonnaded facade, private side porch and stair hall, kitchen wing and first floor rooms demonstrate the combined functionality of the building, although this has been diminished by later alterations. Stylistically, Kyneton Post Office is a handsome composition which is heightened by its imposing and well-embellished four level clock tower. Its bold massing and corner siting at the centre of Kyneton's civic precinct also contribute to its monumental expression. Architecturally, with the exception of the more elaborate clock tower, the form is a typical Commonwealth Department of Works response, one of the last under the aegis of William Wardell, to a substantial regional post office of the 1870s. Centrally located on a prominent intersection in Mollison Street, the impressive post office building with its clock tower is a recognised local landmark within the main civic and commercial precinct of Kyneton, partnering with the nearby Shire Hall and four nineteenth century banks. The building also makes an important and harmonious contribution to the historic streetscape. Kyneton Post Office has additionally been an enduring and prominent component of the historic townscape for over 135 years, since the local community first agitated for its construction, and is a widely known and appreciated symbol identified with the town's origin and period of booming prosperity. The curtilage includes the title block/allotment of the property. The significant components of Kyneton Post Office include the main 1870-71 postal building and clock tower. The single-storey section of the building to the south, extended in c.1893 and again in 1910s-20s, is of contributory significance.

From 1985 to mid‚Äì1992, The Metz Gang distributed approximately 1,000 kilograms of cocaine in the New Orleans metropolitan area and, in furtherance of the conspiracy, committed murders, attempted murders, and other violent crimes. In 1993, Metz, his wife, and several of his henchmen were convicted and charged in a 22 count indictment with various charges arising from a narcotics conspiracy. In 2016, President Barack Obama commuted the life sentence of Danielle Metz, wife of Glenn Metz. Overview When crack cocaine took root in New Orleans in 1987, it seemed to spawn a pattern of crime as hyperkinetic and unpredictable as the drug itself. Dealers moved on to street corners as fast as others were arrested or killed. Alliances formed and dissipated from one big sale to the next. Profits evaporated in the thin smoke of an overnight addiction. Glen Metz's crew was the first organized drug gang the city has had besides Sam Clay's crew. After Sam \\"Sculley\\" Clay was gunned down in the Calliope Projects in 1987, the drug market in New Orleans exploded with violence and mayhem. Metz's crew had dominated narcotics sales in several public housing complexes since 1985, maintaining power by killing anyone who dared to compete. In the early 1990s, NOPD began to crack down on gangs, arresting over 150 members and enforcers. In 1992, enforcer Derrick Mahone broke out of the Louisiana Training Institute in Monroe. During the time he was free, he was arrested and released six times, four times on weapons charges. In 1993, he was gunned down in Algiers and barely survived. According to the Times-Picayune, Mahone was shot 17 times by three men who opened fire on him with submachine guns in a parking lot. Following a trail of tips through rural Mississippi, in January 1993 federal authorities tracked down and arrested the last fugitive, Danielle Metz, at an apartment complex in Jackson, Mississippi. Metz was tracked down after information led U.S. marshals to Yazoo City, Mississippi, where several residents recognized photographs of the suspect, a deputy marshal said. Metz apparently had contacts in Yazoo County, said the marshal. on December 15, 1993, Danielle Metz was convicted of conspiracy to possess with intent to distribute and distribute cocaine, continuing criminal enterprise, possession with intent to distribute cocaine, and laundering of monetary instruments. U.S. District Judge A.J. McNamara sentenced her to mandatory life in prison. 1992 Indictment In 1992, enforcers Gennero \\"Meatball\\" Arthur and Elwood were arrested and indicted with 10 other members for murder and cocaine distribution. Arthur, who was suspected of killing 70 people, was arrested in a Seattle restaurant where he was hiding out as a dishwasher. A spokesman for the U.S. Marshals Service said Arthur is believed to have been hiding out in Seattle for two or three years. In his role as an enforcer, marshals say Arthur is believed to have machine-gunned to death three people and wounded two others in the so- called \\"Earhart Expressway Ambush\\" in 1990. On another occasion, marshals claim Arthur confronted a government witness in a housing project and machine-gunned the man in the legs, leaving him as an example to others who might consider testifying against the Metz group.

While vicar of Hooton Pagnell, he founded and was first principal of St Chad's Hostel, which survives as St Chad's College, Durham. After accusations were made against him by parishioners at a later parish, he resigned his holy orders in the Church of England in 1914, and was accepted into the Old Roman Catholic Church in Great Britain, where he was consecrated as a bishop. Though he was expelled from that church the following year, he consecrated a number of others as bishops, including J. I. Wedgwood who went on to found the Liberal Catholic Church.  Church of England   Education and early ministry  He entered St Catherine's College, Cambridge in 1880, graduating BA in 1883, then trained for the ministry at Lichfield Theological College. He was ordained deacon in 1887 and priest in 1888, and served his first curacy at Worfield, in rural Shropshire. During his time at Worfield, he joined the Society of the Holy Cross, a strongly Anglo-Catholic organisation. He remained there until 1894, when he began a second curacy at St Paul's Church, Worcester. In Worcester he met Louisa Telfer, daughter of a prison chaplain, and the two were married. They then moved to Parkgate, South Yorkshire, where Willoughby began a third curacy.  Hooton Pagnell and St Chad's Hostel  St Chad's Hostel, Hooton Pagnell In 1899, he became vicar of Hooton Pagnell near Doncaster, where in 1902 he founded St Chad's Hostel to prepare men of limited means for entry to theological college. Initially he housed the students in his own vicarage, then in nearby houses and farms; then in 1903 the Lady of the Manor, Julia Warde-Aldam, funded a new building for the hostel, capable of accommodating 20 men. However, in 1904, he fell out with the hostel, at about the time it expanded its operations with the opening of St Chad's Hall at the University of Durham. Willoughby's vice-principal, Stephen Moulsdale, became principal of both the Durham hall and the Hooton Pagnell hostel, and relations between Willoughby and the hostel were poor - the Hooton Pagnell vice- principal, Sydney Richards, was forbidden to celebrate mass in the church, and the hostel used St Wilfrid's Church, Hickleton for its major services while Willoughby remained vicar.  Stockton-on-Tees, accusations and relinquishment of orders  In 1906, Willoughby was appointed vicar of St John the Baptist, Stockton-on-Tees, where his Anglo-Catholic practices brought opposition from some parishioners. In 1914, accusations were brought by parishioners to Handley Moule, Bishop of Durham, that Willoughby had been involved in homosexual activity; he was asked to resign or face a full enquiry. He opted to resign, and on 3 July 1914 submitted a writ of relinquishment of holy orders, with the writ recorded as being related to 'allegations of immorality (sexual assault of children) and embezzlement'.  Old Catholic Church  Arnold Mathew  Admission and consecration  Willoughby approached Arnold Mathew, who had been consecrated in 1908 by the Old Catholic Church as a missionary bishop to Britain, though had by that point fallen out with the church for consecrating further bishops without their authorisation and had established himself as head of the Old Roman Catholic Church in Great Britain. Willoughby was conditionally re-ordained into Mathew's church. Shortly afterwards an election for a new bishop was held among the clergy of the church, with Willoughby coming first and James Ingall Wedgwood second, and on 28 October 1914 Willoughby was consecrated by Mathew, Bernard Mary Williams and John Briggs Seaton at the Royal Bell Hotel, Bromley, and given the title Auxiliary Bishop of St Pancras. Following his consecration, Willoughby published pamphlets entitled \\"The Conversion of Great Britain: What can the Ancient Catholic Church of England do?\\" with Mathew, and \\"The Ancient Catholic Church of England: Her Authority, Her Mission, Her Work, Her Appeal\\" alone.  Split from Mathew  However, in May 1915, John Bull magazine printed an article repeating allegations it had printed the previous June regarding Willoughby and the scandal which had led to his departure from Church of England ministry. When this was brought to Mathew's attention, he summoned a synod (which Willoughby declined to attend), after which Mathew expelled Willoughby from the ORCCGB. In September 1915, Willoughby consecrated Bernard Gauntlett and Robert King, both theosophists who were at the time part of the ORCCGB; then in 1916, Willoughby, Gauntlett and King consecrated J. I. Wedgwood, who shortly afterwards founded the Liberal Catholic Church. Willoughby did not join the LCC, but in a 1927 letter to the \\"Occult Review\\" defending their orders called himself 'the \\"Father' of their episcopate'. In November 1916 Willoughby consecrated Frederick James at the Theosophical Temple, Maida Vale. Later in his life Willoughby reconciled with the Roman Catholic Church; though in July 1922 he consecrated James Bartholomew Banks who went on to found the Independent Catholic Church, later renamed The Old Catholic Orthodox Church (Apostolic Service Church).

Lvovich was one of the main leaders of the Zionist Socialist Workers Party (SS). He was born in southern Russia. Lvovich's involvement in radical politics began in 1903, as after a visit to Minsk where he acquinted the Poalei Zion movement. He visited Palestine in 1905, and following this visit he embraced territorialism. He became a member of the SS Odessa Party Committee and led the SS Self-Defense Unit during the October 1905 pogrom. In 1907 Lvovich represented SS at the congress of the Second International in Stuttgart. In 1908 he and other SS leaders settled in Vienna, where they formed a commune of sorts (nick-named 'the hunger commune' due to their limited resources). Lvovich stayed in the United States during the First World War, but returned to Russia to contest the 1917 Russian Constituent Assembly election. Lvovich, now a leader of the United Jewish Socialist Workers Party (Fareynikte), was elected as a deputy from the Kherson constituency as a candidate on the Socialist-Revolutionary list. Moving away from partisan politics, Lvovich opted for concentrating his energies to build the ORT movement in Russia. In 1919 he left Russia and together with Leon Bramson he sought to build the ORT movement internationally. Lvovich moved to Berlin in 1921. In 1921 he co-founded the World ORT.

In the history of folkloristics, this legend is the earliest known example of the \\"Grateful Animals\\" motif. The Marquis of Sui's pearl, which is frequently paired with another famous regalia, the Heshibi, became a literary Chinese metaphor for underestimating a valuable person or thing. Terminology Uncut jade Bi jade-disk with dragon designs, 4th-2nd century BCE Many Chinese classics refer to the Marquis of Sui's pearl in context with other legendary gems, jades, and swords associated with the ceremonial regalia of ancient Chinese states. Su√≠h√≥uzh≈´ (Èö®‰æØÁè†, \\"the Marquis of Sui's pearl\\") has a literary synonym Su√≠h√≥uzhƒ´zh≈´ (Èö®‰æØ‰πãÁè†) with the Classical Chinese grammatical possessive affix zhƒ´ (‰πã). Su√≠ (Èö®, lit. \\"follow; pursue; comply with; adapt to\\") is the name of a small ancient state during the Shang and Western Zhou dynasties, located in present-day Suizhou, Hubei‚Äînot to be confused with the Sui dynasty (Èöã, 581‚Äì618 CE). Sui was originally one of the Ji states (11th-7th centuries BCE) and became a vassal state of Chu (Hawkes 1985: 336) . The rulers of Sui held the Chinese feudal title H√≥u (‰æØ), the second of five Zhou dynasty peerage ranks. This is usually translated as English \\"Marquis\\" or \\"Marquess\\", but more generally means an \\"honorific term applied in pre-imperial times to all rulers of states, regardless of actual rank\\" (Kroll 2017: 162). Alternate translations of Suihou include \\"Duke Sui\\" (Mei 1929: 215; DeWoskin and Crump 1996: 239) and \\"Lord Sui\\" (Knechtges 1987: 312). Zh≈´ (Áè†, \\"pearl; gem; bead; orb\\") is used in many Chinese names for shining pearls/gems, such as y√®m√≠ngzh≈´ (Â§úÊòéÁè†, \\"night-luminous pearl\\"), y√®guƒÅngzh≈´ (Â§úÂÖâÁè†, \\"night-shining pearl\\"), and m√≠ngyu√®zh≈´ (ÊòéÊúàÁè†, \\"luminous-moon pearl\\"), which is exemplified by Marquis of Sui's pearl. Suihouzhu (\\"Marquis of Sui's pearl\\") frequently occurs in context with one of the most famous jades of Chinese antiquity, H√©sh√¨b√¨ (ÂíåÊ∞èÁíß) or H√©sh√¨zhƒ´b√¨ (ÂíåÊ∞è‰πãÁíß, both meaning \\"Clan He's jade-disk\\"). > Bian He ÂçûÂíå was a man from the late Warring States Period [8th century BCE] > who came upon a stone containing a rare piece of jade. However, when he > presented it to King Li of Chu, it was judged to be a fake, and he was > punished by having his left foot cut off.

When cut and polished it was shown to be a rare treasure. > (Ivanhoe 2009: 164) When Bian He is read as a typical Chinese name, Bi√†n (Âçû, lit. \\"law; rule; impetuous; impatient\\") is the surname and H√© (Âíå, \\"harmonious; agreeable; comfortable\\") is the given name. However, He is also an uncommon surname and early texts refer to Bian He as both Bianshi (ÂçûÊ∞è, \\"(of) Bian clan\\") and Heshi (ÂíåÊ∞è, \\"(of) He clan\\"), with the word sh√¨ (Ê∞è, \\"clan; family; [a suffix after surnames]\\"). B√¨ (Áíß, \\"carved jade-disk with a round hole in center\\") is an ancient Chinese artifact, which first became important grave goods in the Liangzhu culture (3400‚Äì2250 BCE). Bi were \\"often used ceremonially as symbolic of a covenant or guarantee, as between persons, states, heaven and a dynastic house, etc.\\" (Kroll 2017: 17). T√†i'ƒì or T√†i'ƒÅ (Â§™Èòø) is the name of a legendary 5th century BCE sword. The master bladesmith Ou Yezi made three iron swords for King Goujian (r. 496‚Äì465 BCE) of Yue, named L√≥ngyuƒÅn (ÈæçÊ∏ä, Dragon Gulf), T√†i'ƒì (Ê≥∞Èòø, Great Riverbank), and G≈çngb√π (Â∑•Â∏É, Artisanal Display). Master Ou described the patterning on Tai'e to the king, \\"it is majestic and vigorous, like the waves of a flowing river.\\" (tr. Milburn 2010: 285). Mythology Qing dynasty plate with two dragons and a flaming pearl Bi jade-disk with a dual dragon motif, Warring States period Chinese mythology and folkore associate snakes with dragons. Marquis of Sui's snake with a glowing pearl in its mouth is echoed in later Chinese depictions of dragons with a flaming pearl or gem under their chin or in their claws. According to the German anthropologist Wolfram Eberhard, the long dragon symbolizes clouds and rainstorms, and when it plays with a ball or pearl, this signifies the swallowing of the moon by the clouds or thunder in the clouds. The moon frequently appears as a pearl, and thus the dragon with the pearl is equal to the clouds with the moon. The pearl-moon relationship is expressed in the ancient belief that at full moon pearls are solid balls and at new moon they are hollow (1968: 239, 382). Li Shizhen's 1578 Bencao Gangmu pharmacopeia describes a shenlong Divine Dragon holding in its mouth leizhu (Èõ∑Áè†, \\"thunder pearls/beads\\") that would \\"light the entire house at night\\" (tr. Laufer 1912: 64). The grateful snake kills its benefactor in some later iterations of the Marquis of Sui's theme (Eberhard 1968: 381). For instance, the Chinese folktale of \\"The Greedy Minister and the Serpent\\" concerns a schoolboy who found a snake egg and lovingly cared for his pet serpent until he was a young man preparing to take the imperial examination in the capital. He asked the snake for a present in exchange for his kindness and it spat up a huge pearl that brightly shone in the dark. After receiving the highest jinshi degree in the exam, the man was appointed to a prestigious position, but he was dissatisfied and cunningly presented his marvelous pearl to the emperor, who was so delighted that he appointed him grand chancellor. Yet the covetous minister still wanted more wealth, so he went into the mountains where the snake lived, and demanded more pearls, whereupon the snake opened its mouth wide and swallowed him (McNamee 2000: 26-28; cf. Bashe). Legends about animals that carry a marvelous jewel either in their forehead or in their mouth are found almost worldwide. In only a relative few of these legends is the stone luminous, this variant being known in ancient Greece, India, Ceylon, and Armenia (Ball 1938: 502), see luminous gemstones for details. In Western mythology and folklore, there is a theme of injured animals presenting magical gems out of gratitude to people who helped them. This is a subcategory of Grateful Animals folktale motif (Aarne‚ÄìThompson classification systems 554), for example, The White Snake or The Queen Bee. The Chinese Warring States period legend of the Marquis of Sui's pearl is the earliest known example of a Grateful Animal story about repaying a debt in gratitude to a human being (Zhang 2014: 101). Early textual references Numerous Warring States period (c. 475-221 BCE) and Han dynasty (206 BCE-220 CE) texts mention Marquis of Sui's pearl as a metaphor for something important or valuable, but without reference to the grateful snake tale, which implies that it was common knowledge among contemporary readers. The following textual examples are in roughly chronological order, and limited to texts with reliable English translations. Chunqiu The c. 5th-century BCE Chunqiu (Spring and Autumn Annals) official history of Lu state and its c. 4th century BCE Zuo zhuan commentary mentions two unnamed marquises of Sui in 706 to 690 and 537 BCE, but do not mention pearls. The Chunqiu records that when the Zhou ruler Duke Ai of Qin (r. 536-501 BCE) was enthroned in 537, \\"The viscount of Chu, the marquises of Chen and Sui, and the baron of Xu, laid siege to [the capital of] Cai.\\" (Legge 1872: 793). The Zuo zhuan commentary suggests that the viscount had rewarded the marquis of Sui \\"as a peer of the kingdom\\" for his previous military assistance to Chu and called him \\"now to take the field as one of the other princes.\\" (Legge 1872: 794). The Zuo zhuan also mentions an earlier marquis of Sui during the reign of Duke Huan of Lu (r. 711-694 BCE). It records that in 706 BCE King Wu of Chu ordered the sudden invasion of Sui in a scheme to prevent an alliance with the other vassal states of Chu. After peace negotiations, Chu prime minister Dou Bobi (È¨¨‰ºØÊØî) concluded that Sui might conspire against Chu, and warned the marquis \\"to cultivate good government, and be friendly with the States of your brother princes; then perhaps you will escape calamity.\\" The marquis was afraid, and \\"attended properly to his duties of government; and Chu did not dare to attack him.\\" (tr. Legge 1872: 48-49). In the summer of 704 BCE, after Sui failed to attend a meeting of Chu's vassal states, King Wu personally led his army in an attack on Sui and defeated them in the Battle of Suqi (ÈÄüÊùû). After the marquis escaped, Chu captured his war- chariot and the entire chariot division, and the states came to a peace agreement (tr. Legge 1872: 52). The final Zuo zhuan reference to the marquis of Sui is in 690 BCE when King Wu died during another invasion of Sui and his Chu officials \\"made a covenant\\" with the marquis (Legge 1872: 77). Mozi Shang dynasty (c. 1300-1046 BCE) bronze ding The c. 4th-3rd centuries BCE Mozi ([Sayings of] Master Mo) mentions Marquis of Sui's pearl and Mr. He's jade- disk with the legendary Nine Tripod Cauldrons, namely, a set of Chinese ritual bronze ding \\"tripod cauldrons\\", said to have been cast by mythical Yu the Great after controlling the Great Flood. In response to criticism from his disciple Wu Mazi (Â∑´È¶¨Â≠ê) that \\"To leave contemporaries alone and to praise the early kings is to praise rotten bones\\", Mozi (c. 470-391 BCE) explains how a state's yi (\\"righteousness; justice\\") is more important its ritual treasures. > Motse said: The jade of Ho, the pearl of Duke Sui, and the nine tings‚Äîthese > are what the feudal lords value as excellent treasures. Can they enrich the > country, multiply the people, put the government in order, and place the > state in safety? Of course they cannot. Excellent treasures are to be valued > for their efficacy. Now since the jade of Ho, the pearl of Duke Sui, and the > nine tings cannot benefit men, then they are not the excellent treasures in > the world. On the other hand, if righteousness is employed in the government > of the state the population will be increased, the government will be in > order, and the state will be secure. The excellent treasures are to be > valued for their efficacy. Now righteousness can benefit men. So then > righteousness is the excellent treasure of the world. (11, tr. Mei 1929: > 215-216) Zhanguo ce The 3rd-century BCE Zhanguo ce (Strategies of the Warring States), which is a compendium of political and military anecdotes dating from 490 to 221 BCE, mentions Marquis of Sui's pearl along with an otherwise unknown treasure, the Chiqiu zhi huan (ÊåÅ‰∏ò‰πãÁí∞, \\"Chiqiu jade bracelet/armband\\"). King Wuling of Zhao (r. 325‚Äì299 BCE) summoned Zheng Tong (ÈÑ≠Âêå) for an audience and asked how to avoid warfare with neighboring feudal states. Zheng replied, > Well, let us suppose there is a man who carries with him the pearl of Sui- > hou [Èö®‰æØ‰πãÁè†] and the Ch'ih-ch'iu armband [ÊåÅ‰∏ò‰πãÁí∞] as well as goods valued at ten > thousand in gold. Now he stops the night in an uninhabited place. [Since he > has neither weapons nor protectors,] It is clear he will not spend more than > a night abroad before someone harms him. At the moment there are powerful > and greedy states on your majesty's borders and they covet your land. ‚Ä¶ If > you lack weapons your neighbours, of course, will be quite satisfied. (tr. > Crump 1970: 327). L√ºshi Chunqiu The c. 239 BCE L√ºshi Chunqiu (Master L√º's Spring and Autumn Annals) is an encyclopedic text compiled under the patronage of the Qin dynasty Chancellor L√º Buwei. This book and the Zhuangzi have almost identical descriptions of using the marquis of Sui's pearl as a crossbow pellet in order illustrate foolishly losing much and gaining little. > As a general principle, whenever a sage is about to initiate anything, he is > certain to consider carefully how his means relate to what he hopes to > achieve. Now if a man were to use the pearl of the Marquis of Sui [Èö®‰æØ‰πãÁè†] as > a pellet to shoot at a sparrow a thousand yards up in the air, the world > would surely ridicule him. Why is that? Because what he used as shot was so > valuable, while what he wanted was so trifling. And, surely, life is much > more valuable than the pearl of the Marquis of Sui! (tr. Knoblock and Riegel > 2000: 82) Zhuangzi The c. 3rd-1st centuries BCE Daoist Zhuangzi ([Writings of] Master Zhuang) reiterates the story of shooting at a distant sparrow with the marquis's pearl. > Whenever the sage makes a movement, he is certain to examine what his > purpose is and what he is doing. If now, however, we suppose that there was > a man who shot at a sparrow a thousand yards away with the pearl of the > Marquis of Sui [Èö®‰æØ‰πãÁè†], the world would certainly laugh at him. Why is this? > It is because what he uses is important and what he wants is insignificant. > And is not life much more important than the pearl of the Marquis of Sui? > (tr. Mair 1994: 288). Comparing these four matching sentences in the L√ºshi Chunqiu and Zhuangzi, the first sentence is identical in both versions. The Zhuangzi adds one more character in the second and five more in the third, while the L√ºshi Chunqiu has one more character in the fourth sentence. Chuci The c. 3rd-1st century BCE Chuci (Songs of Chu) poetry anthology collectively refers to Marquis Sui's pearl and Bian He's jade-disk (Suihe Èö®Âíå), and to the Tai'e sword. The \\"Quenching the Light\\" poem begins, Woe and alas! my heart within is torn. The winter heliotrope is dead, its leaves and stems blighted. Shards and stones are prized as jewels, Sui and He rejected [ÊçêÊ£ÑÈö®Âíå]. The leaden knife is praised for sharpness, Tai E discarded as blunt. The thoroughbred droops his ears; for a long time now no one has used him. A lame ass draws the chariot and stumbles half-way up the hill. The pure are in hiding; the favoured are fools. The phoenix may not soar; but quails vaunt their flight. (tr. Hawkes 1985: 277) Four other Chuci poems mention Bian He's jade-disk. For example, \\"Disgust with the World\\" includes him in a list of rulers who rejected loyal people, \\"And I grieve, too, for Bian He, the man of Chu [ÊÇ≤Ê•ö‰∫∫‰πãÂíåÊ∞èÂÖÆ]: / The jade he presented was judged worthless stone. / Both King Li and King Wu refused to examine it, / And he ended with both his feet cut off for his pains.\\" (tr. Hawkes 1985: 251). Huainanzi King Liu An's c. 139 BCE Huainanzi ([Writings of the] Masters of Huainan) philosophical compendium has four contexts referring to the Marquis of Sui's pearl, three of which also refer to Mr. He's jade-disk using the names Heshi (ÂíåÊ∞è, \\"Mr. He\\") or Heshi (ÂíºÊ∞è, \\"Mr. He\\", using an uncommon variant character), and Bianshi (ÂçûÊ∞è, \\"Mr. Bian\\"). \\"A Mountain of Persuasions\\" chapter mentions marquis Sui's legendary pearl twice with Mr. He's jade-disk. The former explains the essence of Chinese jade. > When a piece of jade is moistened, it looks bright. [When struck], its sound > is slow and harmonious. How expansive are its aspects! With no interior or > exterior, it does not conceal its flaws or imperfections. Close up, it looks > glossy; from a distance, it shines brightly. It reflects like a mirror > revealing the pupil of your eye. Subtly it picks up the tip of an autumn > hair. It brightly illuminates the dark and obscure. Thus the jade disk of > Mr. He [ÂíåÊ∞è‰πãÁíß] and the pearl of the marquis of Sui [Èö®‰æØ‰πãÁè†] emerged from the > essence of a mountain and a spring. When the Superior Man wears them, he > complies with their purity and secures his repose. When lords and kings > treasure them, they rectify the world. (16, tr. Major et al. 2010: 631) The latter says understanding is more important than wealth, \\"Acquiring an army of ten thousand men does not compare to hearing one word that is apposite; / Acquiring the pearl of the marquis of Sui [Èö®‰æØ‰πãÁè†] does not compare to understanding from whence events arise. / Acquiring the jade disk of Mr. Gua [ÂíºÊ∞è‰πãÁíß] does not compare to understanding where events will lead.\\" (16, tr. Major et al. 2010: 652). Two other chapters figuratively use the legendary gems. One as a simile for someone who has attained the Tiandao (Â§©ÈÅì, Way of Heaven), \\"It is like the pearl of Marquis Sui [Èö®‰æØ‰πãÁè†] / or the jade disk of Mr. He [ÂíåÊ∞è‰πãÁíß] / Those who achieved it became rich / those who lost it became poor.\\" (6, tr. Major et al. 2010: 218). The other advises, \\"With a rhinoceros and a tiger behind you and the pearl of the marquis of Sui [Èö®‰æØ‰πãÁè†] in front of you, do not try to grab [the pearl]. First avoid the calamity, and then go for the profit.\\" (17, tr. Major et al. 2010: 706) Shiji The Han dynasty historiographer Sima Qian's c. 94 BCE Shiji (Records of the Grand Historian) records the Marquis of Sui in the House of Chu genealogy, an episode which is not mentioned in the Zuo zhuan above. \\"In the fifty-first year (690 B.C.), Chou summoned the Marquis of Sui, reproving him for causing Ch'u to be established as a kingdom. The King of Ch'u was angry and, thinking that Sui has turned its back on him, launched a punitive expedition against Sui. King Wu expired in the midst of his army and the troops were dismissed.\\" (40, tr. Neinhauser 2006: 388). The biography of Qin dynasty Grand chancellor Li Si (c. 280-208 BCE) collectively mentions Sui He zhi bao (Èö®Âíå‰πãÂØ∂, \\"treasures of [Marquis] Sui and [Mr.] He\\") in a letter advising Emperor Qin Shi Huang not to follow Zheng Guo's advice to expel foreigners from Qin. > Now Your Majesty imports jade from the Kun Mountains and possesses the > treasures of Sui and He. Dangling moon-bright pearls [ÊòéÊúà‰πãÁè†], you buckle on > the sword Taia, are drawn by fine steeds like Xianli, set up phoenix banners > blazoned with kingfisher feathers, and employ drums of sacred lizard skin. > Not one of these various precious things is a product native to Qin, and yet > Your Majesty takes joy in them. Why? If something must be a product of Qin > before it can be acceptable, then no night-shining jewels [Â§úÂÖâ‰πãÁíß] would adorn > the court chambers, no vessels of rhinoceros horn or elephant tusk would > amuse and delight you, no women of Zheng and Wey would throng the harem, and > no fine horses and spirited thoroughbreds would fill your stables. The gold > and tin from south of the Yangtze could not be utilized, the vermilion and > blue of Shu could not be used for pigment. (87, tr. Watson 1961 3: 182) The Shiji biography of the Han political advisor Zou Yang (ÈÑíÈôΩ; c. 206-129 BCE) refers to the Suihouzhizhu and Yeguangzhibi (Â§úÂÖâ‰πãÁíß, \\"night-glowing jade ring\\") as valuable gems that could be overlooked unless they were examined. > A twisted tree with gnarled roots, bent and bulging with not one straight > twig may become the vessel of a ten-thousand chariot state. Why is this? > Because it was first polished by [the ruler's] attendants. Thus when > something arrives without notice, even though one might be giving away the > Marquis of Sui's pearl [Èö®‰æØ‰πãÁè†] or a glowing jade ring [Â§úÂÖâ‰πãÁíß], one will > acquire resentment and be accorded no gratitude. When men speak of one > beforehand, one can establish such a merit with a wilted tree and a shrived > stump that none will forget it. (83, tr. Neinhauser 2008: 291). Shuo yuan The Shuo Yuan (Garden of Stories), which the historian and bibliographer Liu Xiang (77‚Äì6 BCE) compiled from early sources, quotes Mozi (cf. above) using Marquis of Sui's pearl in a conversation against ostentation with his disciple Qin Guxi (Á¶ΩÊªëÈáê), called Qinzi (Master Qin), who asked about using embroidered silks and fine linens. Mozi said, \\"Suppose that in a year of bad times, someone wished to give you the pearl of the Marquis of Sui [Èö®‰æØ‰πãÁè†], yet would not allow you to sell it, but only to keep it as a valuable decoration. Or that he wished to give you a chung [zh≈çng (Èçæ, \\"cup\\")] of grain. If you would get the pearl you would not get the grain, and vice versa. Then which would you choose?\\" Qinzi answered that he would choose the grain that could rescue him from extremity. Mozi replied, \\"Truly so. So then why strive after lavishness? The Sage does not hasten to exalt what is without use and to delight in frivolity and licence.\\" (tr. Fung 1952: 104). Lunheng The skeptical philosopher Wang Chong's c. 80 CE Lunheng (Balanced Discourses) has a passage contrasting genuine gemstones found in nature with artificial ones made by Daoist waidan alchemists, and it uses the ambiguous phrase suihou yi yao zuo zhu (Èö®‰æØ‰ª•Ëó•‰ΩúÁè†), which can be literally translated \\"the Marquis of Sui made pearls from chemicals\\" (Forke 1907: 378), or contextually translated \\"by following proper timing (i.e. when to begin heating and how long to go on) pearls can be made from chemicals\\" (Needham and Wang 1962: 112). Chinese scholars traditionally interpreted this suihou as \\"Marquis of Sui\\", who was famous for the grateful snake's luminous pearl, yet the Lunheng is the only early text that claims that he made imitation pearls. Some modern sinologists familiar with early Chinese alchemy and glass production, such as Joseph Needham and Wang Ling, interpret suihou as an \\"old alchemical pun\\" meaning \\"following the [fire-]times\\", reading sui in its basic meaning \\"follow; comply with\\" and h√≥u (‰æØ, \\"marquis\\") as a phonetic loan character for h√≤u (ÂÄô, \\"time; wait; situation\\"), denoting the term hu«íhou (ÁÅ´ÂÄô, \\"fire-times; times when heating should begin and end\\"), which were \\"both ancient and important in Chinese alchemy.\\" The Cantong qi uses Yijing hexagrams to express alchemical \\"fire-times\\" (Needham and Wang 1956: 330). This Lunheng context contrasts two genuine/artificial pairs: first jades and pearls as gemstones, then yangsui (\\"burning lenses\\") and brightly polished swords as fire starters. Compare the following English translations. > The laws of Heaven can be applied in a right and in a wrong way. The right > way is in harmony with Heaven, the wrong one owes its results to human > astuteness, but cannot in its effects be distinguished from the right one. > This will be shown by the following. Among the Tribute of Y√º are mentioned > jade and white corals. These were the produce of earth and genuine precious > stones and pearls. But the Taoists melt five kinds of stones, and make five- > coloured gems out of them. Their lustre, if compared with real gems, does > not differ. Pearls in fishes and shells are as genuine as the jade-stones in > the Tribute of Yu. Yet the Marquis of Sui made pearls from chemicals > [Èö®‰æØ‰ª•Ëó•‰ΩúÁè†], which were as brilliant as genuine ones. This is the climax of > Taoist learning and a triumph of their skill. By means of a burning-glass > one catches fire from heaven. Of five stones liquefied on the Ping-wu day of > the 5th moon an instrument is cast, which, when polished bright, held up > against the sun, brings down fire too, in precisely the same manner as, when > fire is caught in the proper way. Now, one goes even so far as to furbish > the crooked blades of swords, till they shine, when, held up against the > sun, they attract fire also. Crooked blades are not burning-glasses; that > they can catch fire is the effect of rubbing. Now, provided the bad-natured > men are of the same kind as good-natured ones, then they can be influenced, > and induced to do good. Should they be of a different kind, they can also be > coerced in the same manner as the Taoists cast gems, Sui Hou made pearls > [Èö®‰æØ‰πãÊâÄ‰ΩúÁè†], and people furbish the crooked blades of swords. Enlightened with > learning and familiarized with virtue, they too begin by and by to practise > benevolence and equity. (8, tr. Forke 1907: 378-379). > In the Tao of Heaven there are genuine [zhen Áúü] things and counterfeit [wei > ÂÅΩ] things; the true things are firm in their correspondence with Heaven's > naturalness; the artificial things are due to human knowledge and art‚Äîand > the latter are often indistinguishable from the former. The Tribute of Yu > (chapter of the Shu Ching) speaks of bluish jade [qiulin ÁíÜÁê≥] and [langgan > ÁêÖÁéï] (possibly agate, ruby, or coral). These were the products of the earth, > and genuine like jade and pearls. But now the Taoists melt and fuse > [xiaoshuo Ê∂àÁàç] five kinds of minerals and make 'jade' of five colours out of > them. The lustre of these is not at all different from that of true jade. > Similarly, pearls from fishy oysters are like the bluish jade of the Tribute > of Yu; all true and genuine (natural products). But by following proper > timing (i.e. when to begin heating and how long to go on) pearls can be made > from chemicals [yao Ëó•], just as brilliant as genuine ones. This is the > climax of Taoist learning and a triumph of their skill. Now by means of the > burning-mirror [yangsui] one catches fire from heaven. Yet of five mineral > substances liquefied and transmuted on a [bingwu] day in the fifth month, an > instrument [qi Âô®] is cast, which, when brightly polished and held up against > the sun, brings down fire too, in precisely the same manner as when fire is > caught in the proper way. Indeed, people go so far now as to furbish up the > curved blades of swords, so that when held against the sun they attract fire > also. Though curved blades are not (strictly speaking) burning mirrors, they > can catch fire because of the rubbing to which they have been subjected. > (tr. Needham and Wang 1962: 112) Soushen ji Although a post-Han text, the imperial historian Gan Bao's c. 350 CE Soushen Ji (In Search of the Supernatural) has two interesting stories about grateful animals presenting luminous pearls/gems. The first involves a black crane; according to legend, when a crane has lived a thousand years it turns blue after another thousand it turns black and is called a xuanhe (ÁéÑÈ∂¥, \\"dark crane\\"). > Kuai Shen [Âô≤ÂèÉ] was the most filial son to his mother. Once a black crane was > injured by a bow hunter and in its extremity, went to Kuai. The latter took > it in, doctored its wound, and when it was cured set it free. Soon > afterwards the crane showed up again outside Kuai's door. The latter shone a > torch to see out and discovered its mate there too. Each of them held a > single night-glowing pearl [ÊòéÁè†] in its beak to repay Kuai. (tr. DeWoskin and > Crump 1996: 238). The second story is a detailed version of the Marquis of Sui's pearl. > Once upon a time, when the ruler of the old Sui kingdom was journeying, he > came upon a great wounded serpent whose back was broken. The ruler believed > the creature to be a spirit manifestation and ordered his physician to treat > it with drugs to close up its wound. Thereafter the serpent was able to move > again, and the place was called Mound of the Wounded Serpent. One year later > the serpent brought a bright pearl [ÊòéÁè†] in its mouth to give the ruler of > Sui to show its gratitude. The pearl was greater than an inch in diameter, > of the purest white and emitted light like moonglow. In the dark it could > illuminate an entire room. For these reasons it was known as \\"Duke Sui's > Pearl\\" [Èö®‰æØÁè†] or the \\"Spirit Snake's Pearl\\" [ÈùàËõáÁè†], or, again, the \\"Moonlight > Pearl\\" [ÊòéÊúàÁè†]. (tr. DeWoskin and Crump 1996: 239). The French sinologist Berthold Laufer notes the remarkable Soushen ji parallels with a 3rd-century Roman legend. The c. 222 CE De Natura Animalium (On the Characteristics of Animals), compiled by Claudius Aelianus, told the story of Heraclea or Herakleis, a virtuous widow of Tarentum, who after seeing a fledgling stork fall and break its leg, nursed it back to health, and set it free. One year later, as Heraclea sat at the door of her cottage, the young stork returned and dropped a precious stone into her lap, and she put it indoors. Awakening that night, she saw that the gem \\"diffused a brightness and a gleam, and the house was lit up as though a torch had been brought in, so strong a radiance came from, and was engendered by, the lump of stone.\\" (tr. Scholfield 1959: 209-210). Based upon the similarities within these Greek and Chinese versions of the story, even in details such as the grateful animal returning after one year, are so striking, that a \\"historical connection between the two is obvious.\\" (1915: 60).

Staffed by African American enlisted men who were placed under the command of white officers, the regiment was formed and trained at Camp William Penn near Philadelphia, Pennsylvania between August 23 and September 10, 1864. Following training, the regiment joined the 10th Corps, within the Army of the James, and later took part in some of the final battles of the war including the Battle of Chaffin's Farm, the Battle of Fair Oaks and Darbytown Road and the fighting around the Appomattox Court House. After the war, the regiment undertook occupation duties as part of the 25th Corps in Texas along the Mexican frontier and the Rio Grande River before its personnel were mustered out in September and October 1865. This regiment's battle flag was one of eleven designed by African American ornamental artist and portraitist David Bustill Bowser. History The 127th U.S. Colored Infantry was formed on August 23, 1864, at Camp William Penn, near Philadelphia, Pennsylvania.

After completing training on September 10, the regiment was ordered to City Point, Virginia. The regiment was attached to the 1st Brigade, 3rd Division of the U.S. Army's 10th Corps (Army of the James) until November 1864 when it was transferred to the 10th Corps' 2nd Brigade, 3rd Division. According to historian Samuel P. Bates, during this period of service, this regiment sustained only a single casualty, and that occurred during Union Army actions associated with the Second Battle of Deep Bottom, Virginia and the Siege of Petersburg. Other historians have noted, however, that these actions occurred later in the siege, and were related to the Battle of Chaffin's Farm (September 29‚Äì30), Battle of Fair Oaks and Darbytown Road (October 13 and October 27‚Äì28), trench duties outside of Richmond (until March 1865), operations near Hatcher's Run (March 29‚Äì31), and the Appomattox Campaign and Confederate States Army's surrender by Robert E.

During the Shang Dynasty, it was common for shamans to hold positions as low ranking state officials, often serving as spirit mediums, fortune-tellers, healers, and exorcists. Shamanism continued to proliferate throughout China until the Sui Dynasty, when Confucianism and Daoism began to take over religious thought and tradition. Daoists saw shamans as a threat since they were often employed to perform similar rituals and exorcisms. Eventually Shamanism declined drastically in the Song dynasty once Daoism became more influential in the Song China's courts. Daoist traditions and rituals gained influence and shamans were seen as false healers who exploited their clients for financial gain. Over time shaman healers, who were mainly illiterate, were replaced by doctors and medical experts who were trusted for their education and literacy. Eventually, Shamanism was mostly isolated to cults in south- eastern and south-western parts of Ming China. During the Ming Dynasty, Confucianism was at the center of China's philosophy and religion. Unlike their Daoist counterparts, the elite Confucian literati sought to end shamanistic practices through assimilation and suppression. This was important to Confucians because they saw shamans as a lower class and wanted to create a distinct separation from them. This proved difficult because shamanism, unlike Daoism and Buddhism, had no central tradition, ideology, or location. Instead, isolated shaman cults were often established in small, local communities. In these isolated communities, shamans were accepted and continued practicing as exorcists, spirit mediums, and healers. Those who did hire shamans were often either ill-informed or could not afford a medical expert.  Persecution of shamans   Shaman healers and Ming doctors  Under the rule of the Xuande emperor and the influence of the Ministry of Rites, Ming China began to crack down on shamanism and its practices. This was mainly due to the rise in the number of elite doctors and medical experts in Ming who saw the acceptance of Shaman healers as a threat to their jobs and society. During one epidemic in 1329, several neighboring communities that relied on shamanic rituals fell victim with most of their inhabitants dying while those who relied on doctors survived. Unlike Ming doctors, shaman healers whose practices ended up killing their patients would often be executed for their actions.  Shamans and Confucianism  Many officials saw the rituals performed by shamans as barbaric and undermining of Confucian thought and Chinese society. In western Hunan, a Shaman named Jiang Cong gained considerable power and influence throughout the region. His influence was strong enough that he could threaten local communities to pay tributes of food and wine or be cursed with bad luck. One ritual that he would perform involved the delayed burial of the deceased, a practice that was seen as sacrilegious in Confucian ideology. Eventually, Jiang Cong's influence caught the attention of state officials, who immediately ordered his execution. In an attempt to co-opt shamanism into Ming culture, Ming military officials decided to rebuild a temple and rewrite scripture for a Canton cult dedicated to the Lady of the Golden Flower. This cult was dedicated to a deceased, unmarried female shaman who drowned. By praying to the spirit, pregnant women could be blessed with giving birth to a boy. However, when civil officials from the state discovered the shaman cult, they ordered the temple and scripture to be burned down. In contrast, Shamans located in Hui'an in eastern Guangdong were assimilated into Ming society similar to Buddhists and Daoists. They were given roles as shefu, or temple managers, and only allowed to perform exorcisms and rain rituals. During seasons of poor harvest, officials would facilitate and attend rituals to pray to the gods.  Common shaman practices   Spirit mediums  Shamans would often act as a spirit mediums by offering their bodies to be taken over by gods and spirits. This was accomplished by enticing them to enter their bodies through dancing, singing, and music. Spirits were invited into the shamans bodies as a form of communication to the deceased. The extent of each ritual was highly dependent on the shaman, some of whom would die in the process of the ritual.  Rain rituals  Rain rituals were one of the most common rituals performed by female shamans during times of drought or famine. If a female shaman was unavailable, then she would be replaced by a Buddhist or Daoist nun. Some of these rituals would often repeat the past rituals of the Shang Dynasty of burning shamans alive as a sacrifice to the gods. Another form of the rain ritual involved exposing one's body to the sun by lying on the ground wearing all white until it rained. In one instance emperor Zhu Yuanzhang exposed himself for three days until it rained. Shamans also performed rain rituals when traveling on the ocean to quell storms. During the war against the Song Dynasty, Zhu Yuanzhang's grandfather was a known as powerful shaman who used his powers to convince the rain deities to quell their storm at sea.  Confucian criticism of rain rituals  Ming officials often retold and celebrated Ximen Bao's attack on shamans during the Warring States period of China. As an official in the State of Wei, Bao convinced the citizens to stop the annual tradition of ritual sacrifice of drowning a young girl for rain by throwing the chief shaman and her followers into the river to drown.

Early life Todd was born on February 25, 1791 in Lexington, a year before Kentucky became a state. He was the third of six sons born to Gen. Levi Todd (1756‚Äì1807) and Jane (n√©e Briggs) Todd (1761‚Äì1800). A year after his mother's death in 1800, his father remarried to Jane Holmes. Among the eleven children his father had between his two wives, was sister Jane Todd, who married congressman Daniel Breck. A source of much family pride, his father fought in the American Revolutionary War under the command of Brigadier General George Rogers Clark. After the War, his father and his uncles, John and Robert Todd, helped found present-day Lexington and became leading landowners and prominent statesmen in the state of Kentucky prior to its admission into the United States in 1792. Through his brother, Dr. John Todd, he was the uncle of U.S. Representative and Union General John Blair Smith Todd. When only fourteen years old, Todd began attending Transylvania College in Lexington, graduating four years later when he was eighteen. Career Todd studied law, first by apprenticing in the office of Thomas Bodley, the clerk of Fayette County (and a cousin by marriage of his first wife, Eliza), and second with prominent jurist George Bibb, the chief justice of the Kentucky Court of Appeals (later a U.S. Senator and U.S. Secretary of the Treasury in the 1840s). He was admitted to the bar on September 28, 1811, however, Todd never practiced, instead, choosing to go into business. Military service Even before what became known as the War of 1812 started, Todd was active in a militia company that eventually merged into the Lexington light artillery of the 5th Kentucky Regiment. In the winter of 1811 to 1812, he asked to be recommended for a commission from Senator Henry Clay through Parker family members. In July 1812, when the 5th Kentucky Regiment left Lexington, it contained Robert, three of his brothers, and eight Todd cousins. Initially, Todd himself did not receive his officer commission, although his two older brothers did, so along with his younger brother Samuel, he enlisted as a private. Before he could leave Ohio though, he caught pneumonia and had to stay there to recover. After recovering (and during which time he returned home to marry Eliza Parker), he went to the Front and fought in the Battle of Frenchtown in Michigan in January 1813 and later, the Battle of the Thames (where Tecumseh died) in the fall of 1813. Before the War ended, he was promoted to Captain. Business and politics After the War ended, Todd began running a dry goods store with his partner, Bird Smith, and frequently traveled to New Orleans to buy French brandies, Dutch gin, and green coffee, which they sold in Lexington and Todd used to entertain many prominent friends with at his home. He later became a partner in a cotton manufacturing company near the Ohio River and by 1835, he served as president of the Lexington branch of the Bank of Kentucky. In 1827, he was appointed a trustee to his alma mater, Transylvania University, alongside Henry Clay and Charles A. Wickliffe. A close friend of John J. Crittenden, he was also involved in local politics as a justice of the peace and sheriff. Todd spent over twenty years working as the clerk of the Kentucky House of Representatives in Frankfort, Kentucky before he was later elected as a Whig to the state assembly (for three terms) then to a single term in the Kentucky Senate in 1848. Personal life On November 13, 1812, Todd was married to his second cousin, Elizabeth \\"Eliza\\" Parker (1794‚Äì1825).

It was located along the Skagit River at its confluence with the Sauk River, west of the modern settlement of Rockport. The community was founded in the 1880s as a transfer point between steamboats and a wagon road leading to the Monte Cristo mines during a gold rush. The town initially grew along the south bank of the Skagit River until a major flood in 1897 destroyed the settlement. A second town was built on the north side of the river near the site of the Great Northern Railway, which was completed in 1901 after another fire. The new Sauk City was destroyed by a second fire and it was abandoned as the area's mining and lumber fortunes dwindled in the early 20th century. During the early growth of the town, Sauk City was proposed as the county seat of the new Skagit County in 1891, but lost out to Mount Vernon.

It has rough, fibrous bark on all its stems, linear adult leaves, oval buds in groups of five or seven, white flowers and conical to more or less barrel-shaped fruit. It is similar to E. prominens which has less rough bark, larger, wider leaves and fruit with the valves more protruding.  Description  Eucalyptus baiophylla is a mallee that often has sprawling lower branches, that grows to a height of and has a lignotuber. It has rough, loose, fibrous bark on all its stems. The leaves on young plants and on coppice regrowth are dull bluish green, linear and up to long and wide. Adult leaves are linear, long and wide and the same colour on both surfaces. The flowers are arranged in groups of five or seven in leaf axils on a peduncle long, individual flowers on a pedicel long. The mature buds are oval, long and wide. The operculum is hemispherical to conical, about the same length as the flower cup. The flowers are white and the fruit is a cone-shaped to slightly barrel-shaped capsule, long and wide with the valves not protruding above the rim. Taxonomy and naming Eucalyptus baiophylla was first formally described in 2012 by Dean Nicolle and Ian Brooker from a specimen collected on the road to Exmouth, 48km from the North West Coastal Highway. The specific epithet (baiophylla) is derived from the Ancient Greek words baios meaning \\"little\\" and phyllon meaning \\"leaf\\", referring to the small leaves of this species compared to those of E. zopherophloia and E. prominens. Distribution and habitat This eucalypt grows in sand over limestone, often on low rises and occurs on the Giralia Range between the Exmouth Gulf and Lake MacLeod in the Carnarvon biogeographic region.

Biography Isaac ben Abraham Kaminer was born in May 1834 in Levkiev in right-bank Ukraine, near Zhitomir. Drawn into the Haskalah movement in his youth, he left the Ukraine for Vilna, where he associated with maskilim, in particular with Samuel Joseph Fuenn. He rejoined his wife and newborn child in Zhitomir in 1854, where he taught at the government school for Jews until 1859. He studied mathematics and medicine at the University of Kiev, graduating as a physician in 1865. While in Kiev, Kaminer inclined toward socialism and joined the circles of Aaron Liebermann and Judah Leib Levin. His two daughters married revolutionaries and his home served as a meeting place and hideout. Russian revolutionary leader Pavel Axelrod, who married Kaminer's daughter, claimed he first came across Das Kapital in Kaminer's home. After the pogroms of the 1880s he joined the ·∏§ibbat Zion movement and became an ardent Zionist. Kaminer served as a physician in Kiev until the end of the 1870s. Informants, searches, and investigations, as well as the deaths of his sons and his own financial decline, forced him to leave Kiev. He moved to Monasterishche in the Chernigov Governorate in 1880, where he worked as physician for the governate's administrative council. He was later made a member of a commission for the investigation of the conditions of the Russian Jews, and he so displeased the officials by his impassioned defence of his coreligionists that he was ordered back to the government of Kiev. In 1901 Kaminer's health broke down, and he went for medical treatment to Bern, where he died as the result of an operation. Work Kaminer wrote verse satires for the Hebrew socialist papers Ha-Emet and Asefat ·∏§akhamim, criticizing supporters of the Haskalah, the ·∏§asidim, and rich communal leaders. Among the most noteworthy of his contributions to Hebrew periodicals were \\"Baraitot de Rabbi Yits·∏•a·∏≥,\\" a series of satirical articles, published in Ha-Kol; \\"Mi- Sidduro Shel Rabbi Yits·∏•ak,\\" in Ha-Sha·∏•ar; and a series of elegies bewailing the sufferings of the Russian Jews, in Ha-Asif. In 1878, he published Kinot mi-Sidduram shel Benei Dan (), a satirical poem on the social condition of the Russian Jews, and Seder Kapparot le-Va'al Takse (), a satirical poem against the farmers of the meat-tax in Russia. A poem written by him on his death-bed entitled \\"Viddui\\" was published in Ha-Shiloa·∏• in January 1902.

She served as president of the Woman's Central Committee on Missions since 1882, and was the first president of the Woman's Mission Union, of Arkansas. As a member of the Board of Lady Managers of the World's Columbian Exposition, and as chairman of the Committee on Congresses, she was selected as editor of the papers read. Eagle served as First Lady of Arkansas during her husband's two terms as the state's 16th Governor. Early years and education Mary Kavanaugh Oldham was born in Madison County, Kentucky February 4, 1854. Both of her parents, William K. Oldham and J Kate Brown, were of Revolutionary ancestry. Her father, a leading stock-farmer in the Blue Grass region, was the son of Kie Oldham and Polly Kavanaugh and a native and resident of Madison county. He is of English descent on his paternal and Irish on his maternal side. Both his father's and mother's families were early settlers of central Kentucky and were among the most successful farmers and stock-dealers in that section. That vocation he also followed with marked success for many years. Her mother, who died 11 July 1880, was the daughter of Ira Brown and Frances Mullens, of Albemarle County, Virginia, and of Scotch- English heritage. She was a member of that family of Browns known as Brown's cove. Her uncle, Dr. Charles Brown, was a prominent physician of Albermarle County. Eagle's siblings included, sisters Mrs. W. H. Miller and Mrs. John Doty; and brothers, Dr. Ira B. Oldham, William Kavanaugh Oldham, Acting Governor of Arkansas in 1913, and Kie Oldham, Arkansas state senator.Kie Oldham papers listing, with bio Eagle was reared on her father's farm. Her early education was conducted mainly at home, her mother having selected the tutors and governesses for her three daughters. Eagle attended Mrs Julia A. Tivis's school, Science Hill, Shelbyville, Kentucky, where she distinguished herself in all her classes. She graduated from that institution in June, 1872. In August 1874, she united with the Viny Fork Missionary Baptist Church at Viny Fork, in Madison county. Kentucky, and became a zealous church worker. Career She married James Philip Eagle January 3, 1882, and moved to his large cotton plantation in the upper Arkansas river bottom in Lonoke County, Arkansas, where he was engaged in farming. He was a devoted church man and as a member of the same denomination, they soon united their efforts in developing the interests of their church for home and foreign missions and for Christian and charitable work of various kinds. They were generous in their financial support of church work for many years. She was the leader of the woman's work of her denomination in Arkansas for more than eight years, serving as president of the Woman's Central Committee on Missions since its organization in November, 1882, and as president of the Woman's Mission Union of Arkansas. For many years, her husband was the president of the Southern Baptist Convention. She spent the winter of 1885 in the city of Little Rock, Arkansas, her husband being a member of the General Assembly and Speaker of the House at that session. This caused Mrs. Eagle to take an interest in parliamentary practice and to take up that study, and she became one of the parliamentarians in the State. She accompanied him while he canvassed for the nomination for the office of governor in 1888, and during his canvasss for re- election in 1890. Eagle was prominent in club work, at the national and state levels. She was one of the founders of the Woman's Co-operative Association, a prominent member of the Aesthetic Club, was frequently a delegate at the Arkansas Federation of Women's Clubs, and was twice a delegate to the biennial conventions of the General Federation of Women's Clubs. She served as president of the missionary central committee of the church from 1882, and president of the state missionary union for a number of years. During her husband's two terms as governor, the executive mansion was known for the Southern hospitality she provided there. Mary Eagle, 1896 On the recommendation of Col. John D. Adams, democratic commissioner, Eagle was appointed as a member of the Board of Lady Managers of the World's Columbian Exposition. She came into national notice in this role, in 1893, as a member of the Board of Lady Managers and a chairwoman of the committee on congresses, in which capacity she presided over all the congresses held in the Woman's Building at the Chicago exposition. As the presiding office and parliamentarian, her decisions were seldom appealed. At the conclusion of the exposition, she was chosen to edit the many papers presented at the congresses, and the result of her work was the publication of two volumes of 824 pages, with the caption: \\"The Congress of Women, held in the Women's Building, World's Columbian Exposition, Chicago, United States of America, 1893, in two volumes, with portraits, biographies and addresses, published by authority of the board of lady managers, Mrs. Bertha Honore Palmer, president, edited b Mary Kavanaugh Oldham Eagle, Chairman of the committee on Congress of the Board of Lady Managers.

It was published by Hachette Books in the United States on April 3, 2018. A paperback edition was released on April 2, 2019. Yang narrated an audiobook version released on YouTube in September 2018. Focusing on domestic issues, the book discusses technological change, automation, job displacement, the U.S. economy, and what Yang describes as the need for a universal basic income (UBI). Yang argues that \\"as technology continues to make many jobs obsolete, the government must take concrete steps to ensure economic stability for residents of the United States,\\" including the provision of a UBI, which is one of three central policies of Yang's 2020 presidential campaign.  Publishing history  The book was published by Hachette Books in the United States on April 3, 2018. A paperback edition was released on April 2, 2019. Synopsis In the book, Yang discusses job displacement and the shrinking of local economies, terming it the \\"Great Displacement\\", which has been \\"the product of financialization, globalization, and technologization\\". He predicts that automation will eliminate millions of jobs, including white-collar jobs, such as attorneys specializing in document review and medical positions, as \\"computers have proven to be quite adept at reading and diagnosing radiology scans\\". Yang draws a distinction between \\"normal people\\" and technologically inclined people, noting that \\"the average starting salary in Silicon Valley for engineers is nearing $200,000, a draw that has led to a decline in humanities enrollments and boost in technical degrees\\". He predicts that automation will make \\"normal people\\" redundant, and that increasing unemployment can lead to violent protests. Yang provides a \\"rebuttal to more optimistic thinkers, such as Thomas Friedman, who believe that Americans can be transformed into lifelong learners\\". According to Yang, 49% of American workers fall into one of the five most common jobs in the U.S. economy: administrative and clerical work, including call center workers; retail and cashiers; food service and food prep; truck drivers and transportation; and manufacturing workers. Yang supports a universal basic income (UBI) of $1000 a month for every U.S. citizen, \\"paid for by a 10% value-added tax on all goods and services\\". He calls it the \\"Freedom Dividend\\" and claims that it \\"would replace the vast majority of existing welfare programs.\\" Yang states that it would \\"eliminate poverty for the 41 million Americans now living below the poverty line\\" and \\"would also improve the bargaining power of millions of low- wage workers‚Äîforcing employers to increase wages, add benefits and improve conditions in order to retain them\\". He cites civil rights leader Martin Luther King Jr., former U.S. president Richard Nixon, and economist Milton Friedman as early supporters of a UBI. He argues that UBI will \\"enable people to more effectively transition from shrinking industries and environments to new ones\\" and be \\"perhaps the greatest catalyst to human creativity we have ever seen\\". In addition to UBI, Yang calls for a new stage of capitalism called \\"human-centric capitalism\\", which incorporates \\"goals and measurements like childhood success rate, mental health, levels of engagement with work, [and] freedom from substance abuse.\\" He argues that \\"GDP will be an increasingly misleading and flawed measurement over time, as more and more work is done by software, AI, and machines.\\" He suggests that a UBI would spur a \\"social credit\\" system of bartering goods and services, as well as reform the higher education system to \\"teach and demonstrate some values\\".  Significance  The topics discussed in the book, including technological change, automation, job displacement, the U.S. economy, and what Yang describes as the need for a UBI, are central to Yang's 2020 presidential campaign. Yang argues that \\"as technology continues to make many jobs obsolete, the government must take concrete steps to ensure economic stability for residents of the United States,\\" including the provision of a UBI, which is one of three central policies of his 2020 campaign.  Reception  Yang has discussed the book and its contents in numerous interviews, including Merion West, Recode Decode with Kara Swisher, and The Ben Shapiro Show. The book, as well as Yang's views and solutions, have received generally positive reviews. Author and businesswoman Arianna Huffington gave the book a positive review, calling it \\"both a clear-eyed look at the depths of our social and economic problems and an innovative roadmap toward a better future.\\" Major Garrett of CBS News found the book \\"fascinating and troubling\\". Entrepreneur Daymond John called the book \\"a must read\\", writing that Yang \\"sees the big picture\\" and that \\"every entrepreneur should read this book to understand the challenges of the next decade\\". Author Alec Ross wrote: \\"In this powerful book, Andrew Yang highlights the urgent need to rewrite America's social contract. In a call to arms that comes from both head and heart, Yang has made an important contribution to the debate about where America is headed and what we need to do about it.\\" In 2019, CNBC editor-at-large John Harwood ranked the book among his top five political books, calling it \\"another take on the forces fraying America's middle class. [Yang] draws our attention to eye- popping data points about where our economy is heading.\\" Kirkus Reviews called the book \\"a sobering portrait of a crumbling polity\\" and \\"a provocative work of social criticism\\". Writing for The New York Times, American economist Robert Reich reviewed both Yang's book and Annie Lowrey's Give People Money, calling them \\"useful primers on the case for a [UBI]\\". Reich felt that \\"some form of [UBI] seems inevitable\\". Emily Witt of The New Yorker saw \\"Yang's arguments for his policies [as] empirical rather than sentimental.\\" Felix Haas of World Literature Today commented that \\"following the challenges Yang discusses [might feel like] getting punched in the face repeatedly\\", but \\"Yang equally manages to convey an incredible sense of community.\\" Writing for The Wall Street Journal, Harvard economics professor Edward Glaeser said that while he shares \\"Yang's worries about the future of work\\", he disagrees with Yang's UBI proposal, stating that a \\"future in which two-thirds of America lives off UBI is a true horror\\". Andy Kroll of Rolling Stone wrote that Yang's book \\"lays out his views in greater detail but raises as many questions as it answers\\", and that it \\"places him firmly in the camp of those who believe economic anxiety played a decisive role in Trump's election and the rise of white nationalism\\".  In other media  The book has been narrated by Yang in an audiobook, which was released on YouTube in September 2018.

He was a member of the Institution of Automobile Engineers.  Early life  Blake was born in Putney in 1867.  Blake Motors  In 1896, Blake started an engineering company in Dalling Road, Hammersmith called Blake Motors. The company produced a design of an ‚Äúoil motor carriage‚Ä¶ being given with a view to the construction of such a carriage by amateurs‚Äù. In 1901, the company had outgrown its original site and moved to a site next to Kew Station. The company was by now supplying components, including complete engines, to London car manufacturers such as Pritchett and Gold and A. E. Farrow.  Locomotives  In 1902, Blake undertook the construction of a locomotive for the nearby Richmond Main Sewerage Board. His design was based on cars of the time, but adapted for the gauge railway at the sewage works. It used a 7hp Blake engine. This was second successful petrol locomotive built, preceded by an 80hp petrol-mechanical built by the Maudslay Motor Company earlier in 1902 for the Deptford Cattle Market in London. Blake built at least one more locomotive, supplied to the Port Elizabeth Municipality for use on construction of a dam and associated pumping station on the Van Stadens River. These may be the only locomotives that Blake produced.  Marine engines and boats  Blake was particularly interested in marine engines and in 1905, he received a patent for a reversing gear for boats. The company focused on creating motors for use in boats. By 1906, it was advertising a line of engines for \\"Auxiliary Yacht and Launch Work\\". The company closed in 1906 and the Kew works was sold to Cowey Cars. Blake built and raced his own launch after the First World War and he continued to build engines and spare parts into the 1920s.

In 2015, she competed at a high level when she won a fan exemption to compete at the American Rodeo. Snyder is now a motivational speaker. Early life Amberley Snyder was born January 29, 1991, in California to Tina and Cory Snyder. She is the second-oldest of her five siblings, Ashley, JC, Taylor, Aubrey, and Autumn. Rodeo career Snyder first rode a horse at 3 and began competing in rodeo barrel racing when she was 7 years old. After that, she spent summer weekends barrel racing, pole bending, and breakaway roping. She won the 2009 All-Around Cowgirl World Championship in the National Little Britches Rodeo Association. She was the 2009‚Äì2010 Utah State FFA President. Car crash and recovery January 10, 2010, she was driving from Utah to the National Western Stock Show in Denver, Colorado, and didn't fasten her seat belt after a gas station stop in Rawlins, Wyoming.

Biography He was raised by his grandfather, who was a bookseller. He originally intended to become an architect, but studied painting instead; primarily with Michel Martin Drolling in Paris. While there, he also copied paintings in the Louvre and acquired a knowledge of Renaissance art.Biography @ the National Gallery of Art. He returned to England in 1847 and became a teacher at the School of Design at Hanley, Staffordshire. He was later appointed Headmaster.Biography from Mapping the Practice and Profession of Sculpture in Britain and Ireland 1851‚Äì1951 @ the University of Glasgow. In 1852, he went to London to become a teacher's training master and marry Elizabeth Newton, daughter of Edmond Newton, an Alderman of Norwich. That position lasted for only a short time, however, as he received an appointment as curator of the Museum of Ornamental Art at Marlborough House. In 1857, the collection was moved to the new South Kensington Museum (now the Victoria and Albert Museum). He served as curator there until 1863, when his position was changed to that of \\"Art Referee\\". He is particularly known for increasing the museum's collection of Italian Renaissance sculpture; including pieces acquired from the Campana collection. He also arranged travelling exhibitions for provincial institutions. Sir John Charles Robinson. Etching by G. Robinson, 1880s-1890s In 1856, he had created a collector's club which became the unofficial \\"Fine Arts Club\\" after the museum's opening. In 1866, it merged with the newly formed Burlington Fine Arts Club and Robinson served as its first President. Working with Sir Francis Seymour Haden, he helped to create the Royal Society of Painter-Etchers, now known as the Royal Society of Painter-Printmakers. He resigned from the museum in 1869; becoming an advisor to private collectors, such as Sir Francis Cook. His own collection included the usual paintings, drawings, and sketches, but also contained Greek gems, Renaissance jewellery, Oriental porcelain, French furniture, Spanish and Italian embroideries, and ancient Coptic fabrics. In terms of his own work, he was most admired for his etchings and drypoints, which may be seen at the Ashmolean Museum, Oxford. From 1880 to 1901 he held the position of Surveyor of the Queen's Pictures. He was knighted in 1887 and named a CB in 1901. Although he wrote no books, he was a fierce and passionate critic and contributed many articles to The Times, The Nineteenth Century, and other noted journals. He also produced a catalogue raisonn√© of the drawings of Michelangelo and Raphael. After his wife died in 1908, he left London to live at his home in Swanage, where he died five years later.

Early life Torkel Korling was born into a 400-year line of Lutheran Church choir directors and organists in Kristdala, Sweden. His father, Felix K√∂rling, was first to find success beyond the church as a composer and conductor in Sweden. Korling set out to be a botanist. Torkel's surname in its usage in the USA is normally spelled without the umlaut. Migration to America Korling migrated to Chicago at age nineteen to study North American flora and fauna and photograph it on his folding Kodak Brownie camera. He worked in the wheat fields and then in a Chicago foundry before becoming interested in camera mechanisms.LIFE, 8 May 1939, page 12, Vol. 6, No. 19, ISSN 0024-3019, Published by Time Inc From his interests arose three strands in Korling‚Äôs subsequent career; as an inventor, commercial photographer, and as a naturalist. Inventor Having devised an apple-picking device in his youth, in 1933 Korling invented and patented for Graflex camera corporation an automatic aperture control that enabled full-aperture viewing for accurate focus, closing to the pre-selected aperture opening when the shutter was fired and simultaneously synchronising the firing of a flash unit.US patent 2,029,238 Camera Mechanism, Application June 4, 1933 It was the forerunner of a feature adopted on 35mm single-lens reflex cameras from the late fifties. He also patented portable, collapsible tripods with extendable leg braces for stabilityUS patent 2,323,473 All-Metal Folding Camera Stand, filed May 6, 1941 which he updated in 1943. Even at seventy-nine years old, Korling developed, as an improvement on the conventional pan head tripod camera mount, a gimbal triaxial universal camera mount permitting the pivoting of the camera about three axes: a vertical axis, a horizontal axis, and a central lens axis;US patent 4,341,452 (45) Jul. 27, 1982 his 'Optipivot' allows the photographer to focus on a scene and then move the camera in any direction and still stay in focus with relation to the subject. Photographer A logging company in Wisconsin hired Korling to take pictures of landholdings it planned to sell. A Chicago magazine editor hired him in 1926 to take pictures of the city and Korling moved there. A friend encouraged Korling to show his pictures to a Chicago ad agency art director, and his career as a commercial photographer was launched. From the 1920s through the 1950s Korling was extensively published in Fortune and Life magazines and did annual reports for major companies; Container Corporation of America, Dow Chemical, and Standard Oil of California. His shot of business executives meeting in a boardroom of modern design was chosen by Edward Steichen for the world-touring Museum of Modern Art exhibition The Family of Man which was seen by 9 million visitors. From the late 1940s to 1962 he was granted access to RR Donnelley's Chicago and Crawfordsville facilities, producing more than 300 images for them at a time when the company carefully guarded its innovations. He was favoured for his ability in staging and capturing the essential steps in manufacturing processes, often in the one image, since he rarely made more than one shot at each location.Abigail Foerstner ‚ÄòTorkel Korling's \`Art Of Commerce' Shows Classic Work‚Äô Chicago Tribune February 4, 1994 At the same time as being documentary, Korling's Donnelly images are modernist in their composition, treatment of surface, and lighting.Imaging the Craft: Photography in the R.R.

Naturalist After becoming an important commercial and industrial photographer Korling went back to the subject of plant life for his third career his in old age. He lived long enough to reconcile his two passions, photographing indigenous plant life across the Midwest and around the country while on corporate assignments. He published several books of his nature work that sold more than 100,000 copies over the last four decades.Anthony Burke Boylan 'Torkel Korling; Photos Won Lasting Recognition', Chicago Tribune, October 27, 1998 In his book The boreal forest and borders, from nature he remembers as a boy bicycling to the edges of his town on the West coast of Sweden and rediscovering same forest's edge in North America where, he writes, ‚ÄúNatural vegetation everywhere has done considerable retreating in our lifetimes. This book, as will each one in the series, Wild Plants In Flower, aims to provoke an appreciation for what remains, whether you can recollect what once was or not.‚Äù In Chicago on 20 acres near Dundee, he designed an arboretum frequently used for his nature studies. He became well known in Evanston during his last two decades. Korling died at Lakeshore Health Care and Rehabilitation Center in Chicago after a severe stroke in the prior July, and was survived by his former wife, Diane Fawcett Korling; a son, Peter Felix Korling; and two daughters, Jenny Korling Nowlen and Annika Korling. He was remembered at a gathering at Bookman's Alley in Evanston which stocked his books.

He was sent by Ariobarzanes in 368 BCE as an Achaemenid emissary to Delphi, where the Greek cities at war between themselves had assembled for peace negotiations. Philiscus had probably been sent at the request of either Athens or Sparta, to help solve the conflicts between the Greek city-states. Mediation in the Theban conflict (368 BCE) Philiscus of Abydos provided important Achaemenid funds to Sparta and Athens. Daric of Artaxerxes II Since the Peace of Antalcidas in 386 BCE, conflict in the Greek peninsula had been continuous, and Thebes had become the new dominant power following the victory of Epaminondas over Sparta in the Battle of Leuctra (371 BCE), starting the period of Theban hegemony. Thebes was being feared by both Sparta and Athens, and these two cities tried to use Achaemenid influence as a mediator to resolve the conflicts in Greece, as had been the case with the Peace of Antalcidas. The objective of Philiscus of Abydos was such to help broker a Common Peace between the Greek belligerents reunited at Delphi. The negotiation collapsed when Thebes refused to return Messenia to the Spartans. Before returning to Abydos, Philiscus used Achaemenid funds to finance an army for the Spartans, suggesting that he was acting in support of the Spartans from the beginning. With the Achaemenid financing of a new army, Sparta was able to continue the war. Among the mercenaries whom he had recruited, Philiscus gave 2,000 to the Spartans. He also probably provided funds to the Athenians and promised them, on behalf of the King, to help them recover the Thracian Chersonese militarily. Both Philiscus and Ariobarzanes were made citizens of Athens, a remarkable honour suggesting important services rendered to the city-state. During 367 BCE, the Spartans, Athenians, and other Greek city states sent envoys to Susa in attempts to obtain the support of Achaemenid king Artaxerxes II in the Greek conflict. The Achaemenid king proposed a new peace treaty, this time highly tilted in favour of Thebes, which required Messenia to remain independent and the Athenian fleet to be dismantled. This peace proposal was rejected by most Greek parties except Thebes. Military actions against the Achaemenid king In the meantime Ariobarzanes revolted against Artaxerxes II in 367/366 BCE. Sparta and Athens, dissatisfied with the Persian king's support of Thebes, decided to provide careful military support to his opponents. Athens and Sparta provided support for the revolted satraps, in particular Ariobarzanes: Sparta sent a force to Ariobarzanes under an ageing Agesilaus II, while Athens sent a force under Timotheus, which was however diverted when it became obvious that Ariobarzanes had entered frontal conflict with the Achaemenid king. An Athenian mercenary force under Chabrias was also sent to the Egyptian Pharaoh Tachos, who was also fighting against the Achaemenid king. Military commander Coinage of Abydos around the time of the tyrant Philiscus. Legend ABVŒî-[H]NON, eagle standing left / Facing gorgoneion with protruding tongue, within incuse square. Circa 480-450 BC Philiscus later played an important role as a general (hyparch) leading an army of mercenaries in Asia Minor. He led the armies of Ariobarzanes initially, and probably later on his own account after breaking ties with both Ariobarzanes and Athens and siding with the Achaemenid king, into conquering various Greek cities in the Hellespontine area. At one point, he is said to have held the whole Hellespontine area, and to have been \\"the greatest of hyparchs\\". In particular he captured the city of Perinthus. He was assassinated by Thersagoras and Execestus of Lampsacus, who were attempting to liberate their city. A previous tyrant of Abydos, who ruled under Darius I, is known under the name of Daphnis of Abydos.

Green bands denote values of n proven not to have a solution. In the mathematics of sums of powers, it is an open problem to characterize the numbers that can be expressed as a sum of three cubes of integers, allowing both positive and negative cubes in the sum. A necessary condition for n to equal such a sum is that n cannot equal 4 or 5 modulo 9, because the cubes modulo 9 are 0, 1, and ‚àí1, and no three of these numbers can sum to 4 or 5 modulo 9. It is unknown whether this necessary condition is sufficient. Variations of the problem include sums of non-negative cubes and sums of rational cubes. All integers have a representation as a sum of rational cubes, but it is unknown whether the sums of non-negative cubes form a set with non- zero natural density. Small cases A nontrivial representation of 0 as a sum of three cubes would give a counterexample to Fermat's last theorem for the exponent three, as one of the three cubes would have the opposite sign as the other two and its negation would equal the sum of the other two. Therefore, by Leonhard Euler's proof of that case of Fermat's last theorem, there are only the trivial solutions :a^3 + (-a)^3 + 0^3 = 0. For representations of 1 and 2, there are infinite families of solutions :(9b^4)^3+(3b-9b^4)^3+(1-9b^3)^3=1 (discovered by K. Mahler in 1936) and :(1+6c^3)^3+(1-6c^3)^3+(-6c^2)^3=2. (discovered by A.S. Verebrusov in 1908, quoted by L.J. Mordell) These can be scaled to obtain representations for any cube or any number that is twice a cube. There exist other representations, and other parameterized families of representations, for 1. For 2, the other known representations are :1\\\\ 214\\\\ 928^3 + 3\\\\ 480\\\\ 205^3 + (-3\\\\ 528\\\\ 875)^3 = 2, :37\\\\ 404\\\\ 275\\\\ 617^3 + (-25\\\\ 282\\\\ 289\\\\ 375)^3 + (-33\\\\ 071\\\\ 554\\\\ 596)^3 = 2, :3\\\\ 737\\\\ 830\\\\ 626\\\\ 090^3 + 1\\\\ 490\\\\ 220\\\\ 318\\\\ 001^3 + (-3\\\\ 815\\\\ 176\\\\ 160\\\\ 999)^3 = 2. However, 1 and 2 are the only numbers with representations that can be parameterized by quartic polynomials in this way. Even in the case of representations of 3, Louis J. Mordell wrote in 1953 \\"I do not know anything\\" more than its small solutions :1^3+1^3+1^3=4^3+4^3+(-5)^3=3, and more than the fact that in this case each of the three cubed numbers must be equal modulo 9. Computational results Since 1955, and starting with the instigation of Mordell, many authors have implemented computational searches for these representations. used a method of involving lattice reduction to search for all solutions to the Diophantine equation :x^3+y^3+z^3=n for positive n at most 1000 and for \\\\max(|x|,|y|,|z|)<10^{14},, leaving only 33, 42, 74, 114, 165, 390, 579, 627, 633, 732, 795, 906, 921, and 975 as open problems for n\\\\le 1000. After Timothy Browning covered the problem on Numberphile, extended these searches to \\\\max(|x|,|y|,|z|)<10^{15} solving the case of 74, with solution :74=(-284\\\\ 650\\\\ 292\\\\ 555\\\\ 885)^3+66\\\\ 229\\\\ 832\\\\ 190\\\\ 556^3+283\\\\ 450\\\\ 105\\\\ 697\\\\ 727^3. Through these searches, it was discovered that all n < 100 that are unequal to 4 or 5 modulo 9 have a solution, with at most two exceptions, 33 and 42. In 2019, Andrew Booker settled the case n=33 by discovering that :33=8\\\\ 866\\\\ 128\\\\ 975\\\\ 287\\\\ 528^3+(-8\\\\ 778\\\\ 405\\\\ 442\\\\ 862\\\\ 239)^3+(-2\\\\ 736\\\\ 111\\\\ 468\\\\ 807\\\\ 040)^3. In order to achieve this, Booker exploited an alternative search strategy with running time proportional to \\\\min(|x|,|y|,|z|) rather than to their maximum, an approach originally suggested by Heath-Brown et al. He also found that :795=(-14\\\\ 219\\\\ 049\\\\ 725\\\\ 358\\\\ 227)^3 + 14\\\\ 197\\\\ 965\\\\ 759\\\\ 741\\\\ 571^3 + 2\\\\ 337\\\\ 348\\\\ 783\\\\ 323\\\\ 923^3, and established that there are no solutions for n=42 or any of the other unresolved n \\\\le 1000 with |z|\\\\le 10^{16}. In September 2019, Andrew Booker and Andrew Sutherland settled the n=42 case, using 1.3 million hours of computing on the Charity Engine global grid to discover that :42=(-80\\\\ 538\\\\ 738\\\\ 812\\\\ 075\\\\ 974)^3 + 80\\\\ 435\\\\ 758\\\\ 145\\\\ 817\\\\ 515^3 + 12\\\\ 602\\\\ 123\\\\ 297\\\\ 335\\\\ 631^3, and :906=(-74\\\\ 924\\\\ 259\\\\ 395\\\\ 610\\\\ 397)^3 + 72\\\\ 054\\\\ 089\\\\ 679\\\\ 353\\\\ 378^3 + 35\\\\ 961\\\\ 979\\\\ 615\\\\ 356\\\\ 503^3, and :165=(-385\\\\ 495\\\\ 523\\\\ 231\\\\ 271\\\\ 884)^3 + 383\\\\ 344\\\\ 975\\\\ 542\\\\ 639\\\\ 445^3 + 98\\\\ 422\\\\ 560\\\\ 467\\\\ 622\\\\ 814^3. Booker and Sutherland also found a third representation of 3 using a further 4 million compute-hours on Charity Engine: :3 = 569\\\\ 936\\\\ 821\\\\ 221\\\\ 962\\\\ 380\\\\ 720^3 + (-569\\\\ 936\\\\ 821\\\\ 113\\\\ 563\\\\ 493\\\\ 509)^3 + (-472\\\\ 715\\\\ 493\\\\ 453\\\\ 327\\\\ 032)^3. This discovery settled a 65-year old question of Louis J. Mordell that has stimulated much of the research on this problem. The only remaining unsolved cases up to 1,000 are 114, 390, 579, 627, 633, 732, 921 and 975. Popular interest The sums of three cubes problem has been popularized in recent years by Brady Haran, creator of the YouTube channel Numberphile, beginning with the 2015 video \\"The Uncracked Problem with 33\\" featuring an interview with Timothy Browning. This was followed six months later by the video \\"74 is Cracked\\" with Browning, discussing Huisman's 2016 discovery of a solution for 74. In 2019, Numberphile published three related videos, \\"42 is the new 33\\", \\"The mystery of 42 is solved\\", and \\"3 as the sum of 3 cubes\\", to commemorate the discovery of solutions for 33, 42, and the new solution for 3. Booker's solution for 33 was featured in articles appearing in Quanta Magazine and New Scientist, as well as an article in Newsweek in which Booker's collaboration with Sutherland was announced: \\"...the mathematician is now working with Andrew Sutherland of MIT in an attempt to find the solution for the final unsolved number below a hundred: 42\\". The number 42 has additional popular interest due to its appearance in the Douglas Adams science fiction novel The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy as the answer to The Ultimate Question of Life, the Universe, and Everything. Booker and Sutherland's announcements of a solution for 42 received international press coverage, including articles in New Scientist, Scientific American, Popular Mechanics, The Register, Die Zeit, Der Tagesspiegel, Helsingin Sanomat, Der Spiegel, New Zealand Herald, Indian Express, Der Standard, Las Provincias, Nettavisen, Digi24, and BBC World Service. Popular Mechanics named the solution for 42 as one of the \\"10 Biggest Math Breakthroughs of 2019\\". The resolution of Mordell's question by Booker and Sutherland a few weeks later sparked another round of news coverage. In Booker's invited talk at the fourteenth Algorithmic Number Theory Symposium he discusses some of the popular interest in this problem and the public reaction to the announcement of solutions for 33 and 42. Solvability and decidability In 1992, Roger Heath-Brown conjectured that every n unequal to 4 or 5 modulo 9 has infinitely many representations as sums of three cubes. The case n=33 of this problem was used by Bjorn Poonen as the opening example in a survey on undecidable problems in number theory, of which Hilbert's tenth problem is the most famous example. Although this particular case has since been resolved, it is unknown whether representing numbers as sums of cubes is decidable. That is, it is not known whether an algorithm can, for every input, test in finite time whether a given number has such a representation. If Heath-Brown's conjecture is true, the problem is decidable. In this case, an algorithm could correctly solve the problem by computing n modulo 9, returning false when this is 4 or 5, and otherwise returning true. Heath-Brown's research also includes more precise conjectures on how far an algorithm would have to search to find an explicit representation rather than merely determining whether one exists. Variations A variant of this problem related to Waring's problem asks for representations as sums of three cubes of non-negative integers. In the 19th century, Carl Gustav Jacob Jacobi and collaborators compiled tables of solutions to this problem. It is conjectured that the representable numbers have positive natural density. This remains unknown, but Trevor Wooley has shown that \\\\Omega(n^{0.917}) of the numbers from 1 to n have such representations. The density is at most \\\\Gamma(4/3)^3/6\\\\approx 0.119. Every integer can be represented as a sum of three cubes of rational numbers (rather than as a sum of cubes of integers).

The film stars an ensemble cast of Anil Kapoor, John Abraham, Ileana D'Cruz, Arshad Warsi, Urvashi Rautela, Pulkit Samrat, Kriti Kharbanda and Saurabh Shukla in the lead roles. Principal photography of the film commenced on 17 February 2019 in London. It was theatrically released in India on 22 November 2019. It received generally unfavorable reviews from critics who mainly criticized the writing.  Plot  Raj Kishore is plagued by bad luck which also follows his longtime friends Junky and Chandu. Any venture the trio engage in results in losses or setbacks; even their fire- cracker shop burns down on its inaugural day. The trio fool Sanjana by making her fall in love with Raj and into getting them a bank loan to start a new package delivery business but her uncle, having similarly been fooled by them before, catches wind of them and demands their money back. The trio escape and inadvertently end up making their first delivery: a highly expensive sports car for Jhanvi, daughter of Raja Saahab and niece of WiFi Bhai. They deliver the car in a destroyed condition for which they are tortured by Raja Saahab and his goons. They offer their services as servants, a suggestion which WiFi accepts; he convinces Raja Saahab to hire them against their astrologer's wishes who is aware of Raj Kishore's bad luck. They get employed as disposable servants; Junky and Chandu are used for testing food that Raja Saahab's and WiFi's enemies may have poisoned while Raj Kishore is used as their decoy while traveling. In the process, Chandu and Jhanvi fall for each other. During one of their traveling assignments, old enemies Bulli and Tulli Seth attack their convoy where it is revealed that WiFi is actually a coward. Fed up of their constant rivalry, businessman-turned-don Niraj Modi who absconded India after taking huge loans proposes to end their conflict by offering each party ‚Çπ700 crores to invest. By their continued stroke of bad luck, Raj Kishore, Junky and Chandu end up causing a fire that burns the whole stack of money. In a bid to save what's left of their money, Raja Saahab and WiFi send the trio to bet on their lucky horse. They instead overhear a conversation about another horse and bet on it which instead loses the race. Unable to pay Raja and WiFi, the trio escape with Jhanvi and Sanjana and her uncle following them. The group ends up on a glue truck where Jhanvi's lips get stuck to Chandu's cheeks and Sanjana and her uncle get stuck on their backs. They arrive in an abandoned house where they meet Kavya who has been staying there posing as a ghost after facing rejection in her acting career. There, Raj accidentally discovers a basement where Niraj Modi keeps his stockpiles of cash. The trio steal the money and arrive at Raja Saahab's and WiFi's house just when they are about to be executed by Modi for not paying them. They settle the money and buy out Niraj Modi's properties. Eventually, Modi discovers that the trio pulled a fast one on him by stealing his own money to buy his properties. He arrives at Raja Saahab's house and threatens to kill them all. Raj Kishore reminds him that his money is not really his own but stolen from India and Raj Kishore himself is an ex-employee of one of the banks Modi took loans from and thus was one of many people who lost jobs because of Modi. Raj also goads Modi's henchmen into keeping the money for themselves. A skirmish ensues involving two escaped lions and concludes with detectives arriving to take Modi into custody. Raj, Junky and Chandu reconcile their differences with Raja Saahab and WiFi.

In April 2019, Bazmee shared his experience of shooting in London. In a statement he said, \\"Shooting in London was not less then a roller-coaster ride. We had a few difficulties considering the weather conditions there.\\"  Filming  Principal photography began in February 2019 in London. The London schedule lasted two months and ended in the final week of April 2019, wrapping up principal photography. John Abraham was injured while filming an action scene for the film in Mumbai. The production filmed scenes in Faversham, where Market Street doubled as a busy London market and Guild Hall was converted into a fireworks shop. The Historic Dockyard Chatham was used for a car chase scene along Slip 5, Museum Square, Ropery Street and Anchor Wharf. Marketing and release Ahead of the release of the film a sequel has been planned. Kumar Mangat, the producer said \\"It is going to be a big franchise, and our team has started work on the script for part two....\\" The first teaser poster was released on 18 October 2019. On the same day the character posters of the ensemble cast were released. The release date of the film was advanced and was released on 22 November 2019.

It accommodates the earliest yet-discovered Islamic-era settlement on the Qatar Peninsula. It is about to the north of Umm Al Maa and to the southwest of Murwab, two other historic Islamic-period sites. Etymology In Arabic, \\"yaghbi\\" is a term that roughly translates to \\"inconspicuous\\". This was name was derived from its low elevation and partial concealment by stands of trees. Geography Yoghbi is in the hinterland of Zubarah and is near to Al Haddayah and Umm Al Maa. The site is situated in a rawda (depression). Large clusters of still-active wells are found here, as well as small dam structures built to encourage the formation of reservoirs. Archaeology In March 2019, the joint archaeological mission of Qatar Museums and the University College London Qatar (UCL-Q) discovered the oldest known settlement in Qatar dating to the Islamic period, which began in c. 628 CE. The settlement discovered here is thought to have been founded during the Sasanian period, between 538 and 670 CE. However, habitation continued well into the Umayyad period, with some ruins bearing features that indicate they were built sometime between 661 and 750 CE. Jose Carvajal Lopez, the lead archaeologist for UCL-Q, stated that this finding is of some significance because it suggests that habitation of Qatar's north coast was not dependent on trade generated by the formation of Baghdad in 762 or the emergence of Siraf around 800.

Originally, it was founded as a Weinsberg- based car coachbuilder, that was known for their recreational vehicles. The city name Weinsberg was used as brand name from 1969 to 1992. Areals of the company Weinsberg in 2006 History  Early years  In 1912, the company was founded in Weinsberg by plaster master Gustav Alt, and master bricklayer Wilhelm Schuhmacher with funds of 80,000 German gold mark. In the south of the Weinsberg old town, nowadays known as Stadtseebach, a factory building was erected. First products of the new company were horse-drawn carriages manufactured by 35 hired saddlers, carpenters, and wheelwrighters using traditional design methods. Within the same year, the production of automotive coachwork started. Each body was manufactured as a custom product made of wood and leather in a way that was similar to the way the horse carriages were made. In 1913, the company generated a total revenue of 119,300 Mark. In 1914, the former copartner Franz Eisenlohr from a Reutlingen hotel operator family acquired the company.soweit nicht anders ausgewiesen: Schmoll/Bartenbach (s. The same year, World War I interrupted normal production. By order of the Ministry of War of W√ºrttemberg, KW produced horse-carts for military purposes. After the war, the production of these field wagons was continued; a few hundred were taken by the French Armed Forces as war reparations. Until the beginning of the World War II, military carts were delivered to the Wehrmacht.  Between the world wars  In 1920, production of automobile bodies was resumed, still being made of wood and leather. In 1922, a first office building was erected. In 1924, KW generated a profit of 340,300 Goldmark. Starting in 1925, car manufacturers urged to replace the outer wood planking on the wooden frame gradually, and change to sheet metal. Tinsmiths, carpenters, and wheelwrighters joined the saddlers. KW was one of the first coachbuilding companies that introduced this new technology. In 1925, KW got the first coachbuilding serial order from NSU Motorenwerke near Neckarsulm. In the following years, KW manufactured bodies for all leading, and many smaller car manufacturers, including Auto Union, BMW, Citro√´n, Daimler-Benz, Ford, Magirus, Opel, and Wanderer. From 1930, Fiat issued large orders. In 1931, bodies for 1500 Berlin taxicab were the only products made by KW. Further major contracts enabled KW to expand; in 1937, sales increased to 3,545,600 Reichsmark.  Fiat subsidiary  1940 NSU-Fiat Weinsberg Roadster In 1938, owner Eisenlohr, who disagreed with the Nazi regime, sold the company to Fiat. Fiat had already acquired the Heilbronn NSU facility in 1929. KW remained as an independent company owned by Fiat. In the following years, Fiat cars like the Fiat 500 \\"Topolino\\" were manufactured in Heilbronn and Weinsberg. In World War II, KW was forced to produce military goods. In addition to a small series of K√ºbelwagen, aluminium airplane parts for the Messerschmitt Me 410 and Me 262 aircraft were made. The number of employees, declined from 729 in 1944 to 114 in 1945, correspondingly, sales decreased from 4,233,500 to 1,093,200 Reichsmark. In the years after the end of the war, goods like spoons, furniture fittings, and signs were made from the remaining aluminum; the carpenters at KW made furniture and radio casings, and farm vehicles. KW also repaired vehicles for Fiat, and the United States Army, KW also built special bodies for US Army vehicles. In 1946, the mass production of sheet metal cabins for B√ºssing trucks commenced. From 1950, the body for the Gutbrod Superior station wagon has been built. In the same year, the last wooden frame body of KW for a Fiat 500 C was produced. In the late 1950s and 1960s, KW built the Fiat 500 variants Fiat Neckar, Fiat Jagst, and Fiat Weinsberg (Fiat Coupe Weinsberg 500). Also, the cooperation with Porsche was continued in the 1950s; for example, thousands of sports cars were painted in Weinsberg. In 1955, the production of sunroofs, automotive accessories, fenders, interior slots, and taxi cab dividers, was started. In 1958, KW invested in tool and fixture construction; tools had already been made for personal use at KW. In 1969, KW introduced its first self-produced well-selling vehicle, based on the Fiat 238. The brand name Weinsberg was used for KW models based on Fiat, Mercedes-Benz, and Volkswagen cars. In 1974, construction of special vehicles such as ambulances, as well as rescue and emergency vehicles followed; single samples had already been built before. In 1970, Fiat decided to cease production in Germany and limit KW to a sales and service organization. The KW was sold to Deutsche Treuhandgesellschaft, which later joined KPMG.  Decline and restart  By the late 1980s, business went well. From 1961 to 1965, the press shop, tool and fixture construction were moved into two newly built workshops on a site next the Crailsheim‚ÄìHeilbronn railway.Jahrbuch f√ºr die Stadt Weinsberg 1961, Eintrag 11. In 1983, the remaining workshops were moved into three newly erected buildings at this site. As a result, the Weinsberg urban areal of 2.1 hectares (5.1 acres) was freed up for new use, and until 1994, residential, and commercial buildings were built after the old KW buildings had been subsequently relocated and demolished.Jahrbuch f√ºr die Stadt Weinsberg 1983, S. 89; 1985, S. 34, 204, 207 und 238; 1986, S. 135 In October 1987, the company had a sales total of DM 85 million and 550 employees (two smaller subsidiaries in Heilbronn included).Jahrbuch f√ºr die Stadt Weinsberg 1987, S. 186 In 1988, due to a bad economic situation of the customers in the automotive industry, KW filed short-time working for several employees.Jahrbuch f√ºr die Stadt Weinsberg 1988, S. 93 In March 1988, German- American entrepreneur Heinz Prechter (American Sunroof Corporation) acquired 50% of KW; in 1989, he acquired 100% of it. However, this could not stop the company's decline. Weinsberg Logo In August 1992, the recreation vehicles and rescue vehicles brand Weinsberg was sold to Tabbert Industrie AG (later named Knaus Tabbert).Jahrbuch f√ºr die Stadt Weinsberg 1992, S. 127 The company specialized in manufacturing parts, as well as fixture and toolmaking. Due to a bad economic situation, after steady staff reduction, in April 2002, insolvency was filed. After more than three years, a new investor Surikate GmbH from Bad Rothenfelde had acquired the company by 1 August 2005. The number of employees declined from 454 in 1988 to 75 in 2005. The number of KW's employees rose to 85 after the entry of Surikate GmbH in 2009. On 11 March 2009, after huge losses in 2007 and 2008, and sales decline of over 60% in January 2009, KW filed insolvency again. The Bretzfeld located Wolpert Group Karosseriewerke Weinsberg acquired KW in December 2009. In 2011, KW was moved to Schwabbach, a suburb of Bretzfeld.  Literature  * (German) H.

He was sentenced to death for his crimes in South Carolina, and is currently awaiting execution. Crimes Allen was inspired to begin his crime spree during his time in federal prison for stealing a vehicle. While incarcerated, a fellow inmate told him that he could get him a job as a Mafia hitman. When he was released, Allen decided to buy a shotgun and begin practising for his promised career: Timeline of events * July 7, 2002: Allen, in order to practice using his shotgun, decided to attack 51-year-old homeless man James White at a bench in Finlay Park in Columbia, South Carolina. The sleeping White was shot twice, but survived the attack. * July 10, 2002: Allen killed 45-year-old Dale Evonne Hall (or Hale) near a Columbia I-77 stop using his sawn-off shotgun. Hall was shot in the head, face, leg, and stomach area. He then drove to a nearby truck stop, bought a can of gasoline and returned to the body, dousing it and then subsequently burning it. * August 8, 2002: After a confrontation with Texas Roadhouse employee Brian Marquis, Allen fatally shot 22-year-old Jedediah \\"Jed\\" Harr, a friend of Marquis who tried to intervene. Soon after the scuffle, he chased after Marquis to his house, setting the porch on fire. * August 9, 2002: Allen set fire to the car of another Texas Roadhouse employee, before randomly selecting and subsequently burning another a few minutes later. * August 12, 2002: While robbing a Citgo gasoline station in Dobson, North Carolina, Allen fatally shot 53-year-old Richard Calvin Hawks from Lowgap, North Carolina and 29-year-old Robert Shane Roush from Lancaster, Ohio. * August 14, 2002: Allen was arrested while sleeping in an abandoned car in Mitchell County, Texas. Death Row stabbing On the morning of December 2, 2009, Allen, along with fellow death row inmate Mikal Deen Mahdi, planned to attack and kill a security guard while in the Lieber Correctional Institution. After making shanks using metal they stripped from air ducts, the duo asked the security guard Nathan Sasser if they could go visit the basketball court. After escorting them there, they attacked Sasser, stabbing him multiple times. He managed to resist and fought them off despite his heavy injuries. Allen and Mahdi then attempted to jump the fence, but after they were unable to escape, they began tearing up the common area. Even after the guards used tear gas on them, they still refused to back down, eventually, rubber bullets were used to subdue the pair. Following this incident, both were stripped of their privileges (outside recreation, visitation, phone use, and canteen items) and in 2017, both were transferred along with all other South Carolina death row inmates to the Kirkland Correctional Institution in Columbia. Sasser was later let go from his post, as he had developed PTSD and had begun suffering from anxiety attacks. All assault charges from him were later dropped by the prosecutors, who said that there's no point, as both prisoners were already sentenced to death. Trials After pleading guilty to the killings, Allen was sentenced to death and scheduled to be executed on January 8, 2010. However, a stay of execution was filed by his attorneys hours after the verdict was announced, with the South Carolina Supreme Court accepting the motion. A new date hasn't been announced, and Allen is still awaiting execution.  See also  * List of serial killers in the United States References External links * State v.

He created Australia's first colonial art work, the Charlotte Medal, which depicts the arrival at Botany Bay. He was also the first person to be executed in the new colony. Life England Barrett was born around 1758 in London. He was accused and tried on 3 July 1782 for the theft in May of silverware from a house, but acquitted. Transportation to Australia On 11 September 1782 Barrett faced trial in the Old Bailey again, for the theft in July of several items from a house. He was found guilty, and sentenced to death, but that sentence was commuted to transportation. He spent the next 18 months in a prison ship moored on the River Thames, before being transferred to the convict ship Mercury, which sailed for Georgia in March 1784. A few days into the voyage a group of convicts, including Barrett, mutinied and took control of the ship. Bad weather forced them to return to England, where they abandoned the ship and fled, before being recaptured. Barrett was again sentenced to death, and again he was reprieved; during the mutiny he had intervened to save the life of Mercurys steward, and to prevent the captain's ear being cut off, and so his death sentence was commuted to transportation. Once again he was sent to a prison ship, this time in Plymouth, until 1787 when he was included in the first group of convicts to be sent to Britain's new penal colony in New South Wales. The First Fleet left England in May 1787, with Barrett aboard the convict transport ship Charlotte. En route, the fleet stopped at Rio de Janeiro, where Barrett was caught buying food from local boatmen with forged coins, which he had made from belt buckles, buttons and spoons. According to the ship's surgeon John White, the workmanship was of high quality and the forgery was only detected because of the poor quality of the metal. Charlotte arrived at Botany Bay on 20 January 1788, but the convicts remained onboard until the fleet sailed to Port Jackson six days later. It was during this time that Barrett created the Charlotte Medal as a memento of their arrival, at the request of White, from a silver kidney dish and using tools provided by White. The medal is considered to be the first work of Australian colonial art. He also create a smaller and less elaborate copper version of the medal for White's servant, William Broughton. Within a month of disembarking at Port Jackson, Barrett was in trouble with the law again. He and three other convicts were tried and found guilty of the organised theft of rations from the stores. Conditions in the new colony were harsh, food was scarce, and Governor Arthur Phillip had previously warned the convicts that stealing would be punished by death. Barrett and two of his co-conspirators were sentenced to execution; the other two were subsequently reprieved, but Barrett was hanged on 27 February 1788, becoming the first person executed in the new colony. The body was left to hang for an hour, then buried nearby. The area became known as Hangman's Hill; it is in the locality of what is now known as The Rocks. A Royal Australian Historical Society plaque on the corner of Essex and Harrington Streets marks the approximate location.

The church was founded by Chancellor Jerzy Ossoli≈Ñski (1595-1650). Built between 1626-1634, the build was consecrated upon completion in 1634. The church's construction was influenced by different architectural movements which entered the Lublin Land (Lubelszczyzna) in the seventeenth century. Structure It is difficult to categorise the architectural style of the church. The church's construction was influenced by Italian and Netherlandish architectural movements. Furthermore, the church's construction was strongly influenced by church construction in Kazimierz Dolny (most importantly, the Church of St. John the Baptist and St. Bartholomew, and the townhouses). It is likely that Kazimierz Dolny brick-layers worked on the church. From one side, the church building exhibits Italian architectural movements, whilst from the other, it has a Netherlandish Mannerist architectural style. The church is orientated, has one nave with four spans. From the east, it is closed-off by a narrowing corpus-nave presbytery in the shape of a half-rounded apse with two scarps. From the west, the fa√ßade is crowned with two towers. Between the two towers, the main nave has an attic gable. The church was built using Gothic brick in Polish brickwork. The church's architectural style is characterised by the linkage of red-bricked walls with a bright, smooth architectural design. The brick elevation contrast ideally with the light-coloured plaster and sandstone architectural feature. The architectural feature has been richly detailed with sculpture, including the: lintel, window and portal frames, pilaster bases and capitals, cornices, and friezes. Furthermore, some of the blind windows, window niches, sacristy, and scarps are plastered.

In addition to various qualification measures, those interested in founding companies and established young entrepreneurs are supported with consulting and coaching as well as the provision of infrastructure and offices.  Student body  The student body is a component entity with the right of self-governance. Its central body is the StuRa (Student Council), which acts as a central point of contact for all student matters. The Student Council is a member of the FZS, where it participates through a representative in the so-called Student Committee, the highest decision-making body between general meetings.  International matters   Partner universities  The HTW Dresden cooperates with roughly 145 universities worldwide within the framework of university agreements, or within the framework of the ‚ÄòErasmus +‚Äô EU programme. These contacts form the basis for scientific collaboration in teaching and research, as well as for the exchange of students and university lecturers.  Dual degree programme  Dual degree programmes enable students to obtain a degree from the HTW Dresden and the corresponding partner university at the same time, without extending the specified study period. This means that the study programme can be enhanced by way of integrated courses, and other linguistic, cultural and university environments can be discovered. The degrees awarded by the HTW Dresden are Diploma, Bachelor or Master, as well as the equivalent degree of a student's corresponding home university.  Faranto e.V.  Faranto e.V. is a student initiative for intercultural understanding at the HTW Dresden. It promotes, among other things, an international exchange, it supervises guest students at the HTW, and provides information on stays abroad.  Regular events  Traditionally, the HTW Dresden holds an information day on the second Thursday in January and on a Saturday in April, during which students can obtain key information for their time at the university. One of the highlights of the year is the so- called ‚ÄòDresden Researchers‚Äô Night‚Äô, which provides all those interested with an insight into the scientific landscape. As at many other universities, a Dies Academicus is held annually at the HTW Dresden. There is also a research day once a year, which was first held in 2010. In addition, the Student Council at the HTW Dresden holds an introductory event for all new students at the beginning of the academic year. The event is intended to make it easier for students to start their studies, but also to enable them to get to know other first-semester students or those already studying. The individual faculties also regularly host their own specific events: *The Faculty of Civil Engineering has hosted the annual ‚ÄòSaxon Radon Day‚Äô since 2007, where topics of radon-proof construction and renovation are discussed. *The Faculty of Electrical Engineering regularly offers scientific seminars to stimulate communication between students, scientists and industry experts. *Together with the DVW Saxony, the Faculty of Spatial Information organises a winter lecture series in which the latest topics are discussed. *At the Faculty of Design, a public presentation of semester papers takes place at the end of the winter semester. *Once a month, the Faculty of Informatics / Mathematics offers a so-called ‚ÄòDatabase Regulars‚Äô Table‚Äô. *The Faculty of Agriculture / Environment / Chemistry hosts the Green Forum Pillnitz together with the Saxon State Office for the Environment, Agriculture and Geology, the Julius-K√ºhn- Institute and the Saxon State Enterprise ‚ÄòPalaces, Castles and Gardens of Saxony‚Äô. Shared presentations are held during which research results, education, teaching and joint events are in the spotlight. *The Faculty of Mechanical Engineering has been organising the annual Dresden Commercial Vehicle Day since 2011, in order to stimulate interest among students and other interested parties for commercial vehicle technology, which is offered as part of the vehicle technology study programme. *The Faculty of Business Administration holds \\"SME Day\\" annually in April; it deals with current business management issues in the context of a practice-oriented specialist conference. Company representatives, the managers and employees of associations as well as University professors present and discuss current information on SME topics.

V. Iyer posing with a discus Kolar Venkatesh Iyer, known as K. V. Iyer (1897-1980) was a gymnast, bodybuilder, proponent of Indian physical culture, and author of books including the 1930 Muscle Cult: A Pro-Em for My System. He contributed to the development of modern yoga as a system of exercise. He was \\"possibly the most high-profile Indian advocate of physical culture in the first half of the twentieth century.\\" Life Kolar Venkatesh Iyer was born in the village of Devarayasmudra in Kolar District, Karnataka. His mother died when he was ten, and he went to school in Mysore, reaching the Intermediate level. Soon after that he began developing his own system of bodybuilding. He was a gymnast, bodybuilder, energetic and well-known proponent of Indian physical culture, and a contributor, like other gymnastics teachers such as Krishnamacharya, to the development of modern yoga. He consciously combined hatha yoga with bodybuilding in his Bangalore gymnasium, around 1930. He helped, too, to present the sequence of yoga asanas called Surya Namaskar, the Salute to the Sun, as a practical, modern, stretching exercise rather than as something spiritual. He toured India doing lecture-demonstrations, accompanied by the yoga guru Seetharaman Sundaram. This helped to change the perception of yoga from a magical technique intended for the medieval and magical transformation of the body into something immortal, by conquering the five elements, to a view of the body from the point of view of looking good and being physically fit. His first gymnasium was established in the Sultan's palace in Bangalore in 1922. He moved several times, finally in 1940 setting up the \\"famous\\" Vyayamsala on J. C. Road, Bangalore. He became \\"the most important Indian physical culture instructor of the time\\", attempting \\"to blend Yoga, Hindu mysticism, and occidental physical culture into something uniquely his own\\". Iyer served also as physician to the Maharajah of Mysore. As well as promoting gymnastics, he vigorously promoted himself, appearing in magazines such as Health and Strength and The Superman, and describing himself as \\"India's most perfectly developed man\\" with \\"a body which Gods covet\\". K. V. Iyer's close friends included T. P. Kailasam and V. Seetharamaiah. The humorous playwright T. P. Kailasam, hearing from Iyer that he had not read anything by Oscar Wilde, replied \\"Oh my! You are only into body-building, what about your brain? You should prove to the world that a well-built body can harbour a creative mind too.\\" The effect was to encourage Iyer to become a novelist, publishing Roopadarshi, Shantala, Leena, Mrischakitika, Samudyata, Ekalavya, and Sayyada Mane in the Kannada language.

After the closure of the local label caused by widespread piracy problem in the Philippines on 2012, it resumed its operations on 2018. History In 1995, after OctoArts International (now PolyEast Records) signed a distribution deal with EMI, Sony Music Philippines was established with its first office at the Shaw Boulevard in Mandaluyong City. In 2005, as an after-effect of the Sony BMG merger (which happened a year earlier), it merged with Bertelsmann's local label BMG Records (Pilipinas) Inc. (itself founded in the 1980s) to become Sony BMG Music Entertainment Philippines.https://www.discogs.com/label/179825-BMG-Records- Pilipinas-Inc In 2009, the label was renamed Sony Music Entertainment Philippines. After the label closed its Manila office in 2012, Sony Music signed with Ivory Music and Video (formerly Ivory Records) as the exclusive licensee of its international releases in the Philippines. This was the first time since the early 1990s (under OctoArts) that international Sony Music releases were licensed by an independent Philippine label. Upon the Sony Music Philippines reopening in 2018, the label held a press event one year later, announcing the new roster of artists signed to them which includes Ben&Ben;, The Vowels They Orbit, Alex Bruce, Syd Hartha, and the band Nathan & Mercury. In the same year, Filipino boy band SB19 signed a recording contract with the label.

Codex Balduini Trevirensis (also known as the Balduineum, or as Codex Balduineus), is an illustrated chronicle made c. 1340 for Baldwin of Luxemburg, archbishop of Trier and brother of the late emperor Henry VII. It covers Henry's Italian campaign of 1310 ‚Äì 1313, in which Baldwin himself had been a participant. In this campaign, Henry sought papal coronation as emperor. He successfully brought Northern Italy under imperial control and was crowned King of Italy in Milan, he entered Rome by force, but as St Peters Basilica remained in the hands of his enemies he was crowned emperor at the Lateran on 29 June 1312 by three cardinals of Pope Clement V (who was himself in exile at Avignon), but he died from Malaria a year later, still on campaign.

It is located north northeast of the Fra Cristobal Range.  History   Paraje de Fray Crist√≥bal  The site of Paraje was originally an area known to the first Spanish colonists of New Mexico as Paraje de Fray Crist√≥bal. It was a paraje, an unpopulated stopping place along the old Camino Real de Tierra Adentro from the sixteenth to the nineteenth centuries. It was the first watering and grazing place along the Rio Grande available, after the crossing of the Jornada del Muerto from the south or the last such stop before entering it from the north. Travelers passed through the north northwest/south southeast trending Lava Gate between the difficult terrain of the Jornada del Muerto Volcano malpa√≠s (lava field) to the northeast of it and the foothills of the mountain range to the southwest which funneled travelers to the paraje on the Rio Grande. The paraje and the mountains to the south were named after a priest, Fray Crist√≥bal de Salazar, a cousin of Juan de O√±ate, with the first colonizing expedition in 1598.George D. Torok, From the Pass to the Pueblos, Sunstone Press, Santa Fe, Dec 1, 2011  Paraje  Until after the establishment of Fort Conrad (1851) and later Fort Craig (1854), Paraje de Fray Cristobal, remained an unpopulated stopping place along the old Camino Real. The settlement of Paraje began about 1857 as an agricultural settlement and stopping place, that was ultimately populated by 200 people. They traded with the nearby forts and with passing travelers on the Camino Real de Tierra Adentro at the northern entrance to the Jornada del Muerto. It was the first water and grazing available along the Rio Grande after the crossing of the Jornada del Muerto from the south and the last before entering it from the north. During the American Civil War in 1861 - 1862 Paraje was briefly garrisoned by 140 New Mexican Militia men, including a detachment of Captain Hubbell's New Mexican Volunteer Cavalry Company, guarding against the Confederate forces to the south in Confederate Arizona. Captain Hubbell's detachment participated in the Skirmish near Fort Thorn on September 26, 1861. Robert Nicholson Scott, Henry Martyn Lazelle, George Breckenridge Davis, Leslie J.

War Dept, U.S. Government Printing Office, 1882 Jerry D. Thompson, A Civil War History of the New Mexico Volunteers and Militia, UNM Press, Albuquerque, 2015 Between 1867 and 1910 Paraje had its own post office. The population began to decline after the 1910s after the development of the plan to build a dam down river. By the end of the 1920s it was a ghost town. In 1942, the site was first submerged by the Elephant Butte Reservoir. Later exposed by the retreat of the waters of the reservoir, some ruins and artifacts can be seen in the area.

Among other achievements, he completed a 4,500-mile charity walk around the coast of Britain in order to raise funds for research into Parkinson's disease Isaacs, the son of a solicitor, trained as a surveyor, but was diagnosed with Parkinson's Disease in his mid-twenties, while working in London. He went on to found The Cure Parkinson's Trust, with others he had met in the course of his sponsored walk, and raised around ¬£350,000 in total for medical research. He was named Charity Personality of the Year in 2004 and was one of the bearers of the Olympic torch in 2012. Isaacs was one of the participants in a revolutionary trial of the drug GDNF which took place between 2012 and 2017, in which 41 Parkinson's sufferers had surgery to introduce implants that enabled the drug to be delivered direct to their brain cells, in the hope that the cells contributing to Parkinson's could be repaired. Isaacs died suddenly, of heart failure, shortly after the trial was completed. Tributes to him included one from The Michael J. Fox Foundation; Fox himself said \\"Tom's passion, determination and hard work on behalf of everyone living with Parkinson's were the hallmark of his life and will be his continuing legacy in our community.\\" Following his death, the Tom Isaacs Memorial Award was established to honour a researcher into Parkinson's Disease. The first winner was Professor Tom Foltynie of University College, London. In 2019, the BBC screened a two-part documentary about the GDNF trial, in which Isaacs played a leading role.

First recorded in the 11th century, branches of the family held the lordships of Gundelfingen, Steusslingen and Justingen. Their ancestral seat was Burg Hohengundelfingen near M√ºnsingen. One Swigger von Gundelfingen is recorded in 1105. The division into three branches is a consequence of the turmoils of the interregnum after 1250. Hohengundelfingen castle was sold to the Habsburgs in 1293, with whom the Gundelfinger were in a feudal relationship until 1377. The Gundelfingen family rose to prominence in Swabia and W√ºrttemberg in the 15th century. The last representative of the family was Schweikhart von Gundelfingen (d. 1546).

He was also anti-abbot of the Princely Abbey of Saint Gall from 1288 until 1291, appointed by King Rudolf I.  Life  Rudolf was a member of the House of Gundelfingen, whose ancestral seat Hohen-Gundelfingen is located in modern-day M√ºnsingen in Baden-W√ºrttemberg. Konrad is attested as abbot of Kempten from 1284 onward. Between 10 and 15 October 1288 Konrad was appointed anti-abbot of Saint Gall by King Rudolf of Habsburg when Wilhelm von Montfort was given an Imperial Ban for his policies. A bitter fight for power in and around the territories of the Abbey was fought between the parties. Konrad waged war against Wilhelm, aided by Ulrich von Ramschwag. He gained control over several of the Abbey's important castles, e.g. Clanx Castle in Appenzell, Wildberg Castle, Iberg Castle, as well as Alt-Toggenburg Castle. He was rarely in Saint Gall himself as he frequently travelled in the retinue of the king. Konrad nearly ruined the Abbey financially, partly by warring against Wilhelm, partly by bringing the financial troubles of Kempten Abbey to Saint Gall. The monastery's properties were sold to keep the war going. When King Rudolf died on 15 July 1291, the situation turned abruptly. Konrad and Ulrich were expelled by the citizenry. Wilhelm von Montfort was able to return, for which he thanked the city in a document on 31 July 1291. Konrad joined the Habsburg league under the knight Jakob von Frauenfeld and tried to capture Schwarzenbach Castle from Wil. The attempt failed, however, and he went back to Kempten. Wilhelm von Montfort and Konrad must have found an agreement, as a settlement of 100 silver mark is recorded for 26 October 1298.

The church was established in 1929 on the eastern slope of Bukit Purmei in Kampong Bahru, making it Singapore's first rural church. It was gazetted by the National Heritage Board as a National monument on 11 November 2009.  History   Origins  At the end of the nineteenth century, the only church that served the Chinese Catholic community in Singapore was the Church of Saints Peter and Paul. Even so, the church was continuously packed on Sundays, feast days and other special occasions, and it was largely a Teochew-speaking congregation. In 1910, Bishop Emile Barillon wrote back to the Paris Foreign Missions Society (MEP), mentioning that the Church in Singapore \\"foresees that a third Chinese parish would become necessary for the Catholics originating from Fukien who have multiplied more and more.‚Äù During that time, there were a few hundred Hokkien-speaking Christians. Conversions within this dialect group were few as they had no church of their own, and as such there was a need to build a church catered to the Hokkien community. In 1923, Father Emile Joseph Mariette, who was then the parish priest of the Church of Saints Peter and Paul, suggested to the MEP to build this new church, and thus they began the search for a suitable site. On 21 November 1925, the Church acquired 2.1 acres of land at Bukit Purmei, which at that time was a large tract of undeveloped and dismal marshland occupied by Malay Squatters and Catholic families. During that period, this plot of land was near Outram General Hospital as well as Tanjong Pagar Railway Station, which was still undergoing construction then. The cost of the land amounted to $26,000, and the building fund took about a quarter of a million dollars, all of which was contributed by the MEP and prominent Chinese Catholics. The building was based on the sketches of Father Jean Marie Ouillon, and his design was heavily inspired by the Basilica of the Sacred Heart in Montmarte, which was also built on a hill. The foundation stone was laid on Easter Monday, 18 April 1927, by Pierre Louis Perrichon, Bishop of Corona and Coadjutor to the Bishop of Malacca. During the construction, Father Mariette was inspecting the construction prorgress on site when a plank fell from the top of the steeple and hit him on his head. He was rushed to Outram General Hospital, but passed away soon after. Up till this day, a marble plaque stands dedicated to him near where the accident took place. Father Stephen Lee was then tasked to supervise the rest of the building project, and subsequently became the parish priest in 1930.  Early Church  The church was completed and officially opened on 7 April 1929 to much fanfare, with a crowd of approximately 6,000 people. As church members believed that the land was acquired through the intercession of St Teresa of the Child Jesus, it was decided that the church should be named after her, and that she be made its patron saint. However soon after the opening, the Church struggled to remain open due to its low attendance rates. Due to the lack of developed infrastructure surrounding the Church, people found it inaccessible and hence continued to attend services at the more conveniently located Church of Saint Peter and Paul. Thus, the services at the Church of St Teresa were highly irregular, and at one point had only 4 services in a year. It ultimately failed to cater to the Hokkien Catholic community, but its parish population slowly grew due to the patronage of workers from the dockyards, as well as staff and patients from the Singapore General Hospital.  Developments  In June 1930, the government acquired a portion of land in front of the church to make way for the deviation of Kampong Bahru Road and the Federated Malay States Railway, resulting in the loss of more than 8,000 square feet of its frontage. Soon after in 1934, the Catholic Church acquired the surrounding land and a Catholic settlement quickly developed around the Church, helping the parish population grow. In 1935, Father Lee founded St Teresa‚Äôs Sino-English Primary School to provide education for the children living in the vicinity. The school was renamed St Teresa's Sino English School when secondary students enrolled in 1965. The school later became St Teresa's High School, which closed in 1998. During the Japanese Occupation (1942‚Äì1945), Bukit Teresa became the British military‚Äôs anti-aircraft post. Due to the church‚Äôs proximity to Bukit Teresa and the port, it was attacked frequently by the Japanese. Both the church and the buildings in the Catholic settlement sustained heavy damage during the bombings. When the war ended, Father Lee oversaw the task of rebuilding the church from the ravages of war. During the post-war period, the Church was a place of refuge for many groups in society who had fallen through the cracks. The church opened its doors to women who sought protection from Japanese soldiers, Caucasians during the Maria Hertogh riots, and the homeless from the Bukit Ho Swee Fire. The Church of St Teresa was gazetted as a national monument on 11 November 2009.  Architecture  The Church of St Teresa is the only building in Singapore that features Romano-Byzantine architecture. The building was based on the sketches of Father Jean Marie Ouillon, and his design was heavily inspired by the Basilica of the Sacred Heart in Montmarte, Paris, France. Emile Brizay, who also designed the Former Ford Factory, prepared the final architectural plans under Brossard Mopin Malaya Co Pte Ltd. The windows on the sides of the church are set within arches and are adorned with decorative designs comprising a cross within a circle. These windows, together with the clerestory windows, provided ventilation for the church interior before air-conditioners were installed. The baldachin over the high altar was designed by Swan & Maclaren Architects. Supported by tall columns, each of the pediments at the top of the structure has a circular wreath design in the centre.  Bells  In November 1927, 5 bronze bells were donated by devout parishioner Joseph Chan Teck Hee and named after his children. Each bell is of a different size and tuned in five different tones, and when struck form a harmonized music chord. They were cast by the Cornille-Harvard Bell Foundry at Villedieu-les-Poeles, Normandy, France in the papacy of Pope Pius XI.  Stained glass  The French-made stained glass windows were installed at the back of the sanctuary in 1931. The three windows, with six panels each, chronicle the life of the Patron Saint, St Therese of Lisieux, France.

Much of the material put forth by the organization involves misinformation on vaccines and anti-vaccine propaganda. It was founded and is chaired by Robert F. Kennedy Jr. Established under the name World Mercury Project in 2016, it has been campaigning against various public health programs, such as vaccination and fluoridation of drinking water. The group has been contributing to vaccine hesitancy in the United States, encouraging citizens and legislators to support anti-vaccine regulations and legislation. Background Children's Health Defense alleges that a large proportion of American children are suffering from conditions as diverse as autism, attention deficit hyperactivity disorder, food allergies, cancer, and autoimmune diseases due to exposure to a variety of chemicals and radiation. The chemicals and radiation that Children's Health Defense has blamed and campaigned against include vaccines, pesticides, fluoridation of drinking water, paracetamol (acetaminophen), aluminum, wireless communications, and others. It has brought lawsuits targeting pesticides in food and agriculture. Named the World Mercury Project until 2018, the Children's Health Defense is an influential anti-vaccine organization due to the prominence of its founder and chairman, Robert Kennedy Jr. On February 15, 2017, with other anti-vaccination activists and actor Robert De Niro at his side, Kennedy challenged anybody to prove the use of thimerosal is safe \\"in the amounts contained in vaccines currently being administered to American children and pregnant women\\", ignoring a 1999 Food and Drug Administration study doing just that. Although the use of thimerosal in vaccines was phased out by 2001 (with one exception), this mercury compound is still often referred to by anti-vaccination groups. Overwhelming evidence indicates that vaccines are safe and effective. The 2018 tax return for Children's Health Defense indicates that Kennedy was paid $184,375 for his services as Chairman and chief counsel for the organization. Kennedy met with Donald Trump in January 2017. While Kennedy claimed the President agreed to establish a commission to study the risks allegedly associated with vaccines, government officials denied any decision was taken and nothing subsequently came of it. Alleging widespread corruption within health care research and collusion by multiple governments, the group endorsed a recent edition of the book Judy Mikovits wrote about her discredited theories, with Kennedy writing the foreword. During the COVID-19 pandemic, the group accused the United States government of supporting research on a vaccine as part of a plan to increase revenues for the pharmaceutical industry. Anti-vaccination online campaigns A study found Children's Health Defense was one of major buyers of anti-vaccine Facebook advertising in December 2018 and February 2019, the other being Stop Mandatory Vaccination. Heavily targeting women and young couples, the advertising highlighted the alleged risks of vaccines and asked for donations. According to an analysis by NBC News, the group is one of three major sources of false claims on vaccination shared on the internet, the other two being the fake news site Natural News and the website Stop Mandatory Vaccination. Facebook subsequently refused to carry anti-vaccination advertising from the group. Children's Health Defense said that the efficacy of its non-advertising Facebook campaigns has been greatly affected by the platform taking additional measures against misinformation in 2019. In a lawsuit filed with the United States District Court for the Northern District of California in August 2020, against Facebook and four fact-checking services, the group said the viewership of some of its posts on vaccination and 5G wireless was reduced by 95% after they were labelled as misinformation. Even though those messages were allowed to be posted by the group and shared by users, Children Health Defense argues that labelling them as misinformation amounts to censorship; they allege their messages are presented merely as opinions rather than information and as such, cannot be characterized as misinformation. Criticism Despite Kennedy's claims that he is in fact not against vaccines, several critics point out he and his organization spread common anti-vaccine arguments as part of their core messages. According to David Gorski, the World Mercury project was \\"a group dedicated to fear mongering over mercury in vaccines as a cause of autism and health problems\\". Kennedy has stated the media and governments are engaged in a conspiracy to deny that vaccines cause autism. On May 8, 2019, while some areas in the United States were struggling with a resurgence of measles due to low vaccination rates, Kathleen Kennedy Townsend, Joseph P. Kennedy and Maeve Kennedy McKean publicly stated that while their relative Robert has championed many admirable causes, he \\"has helped to spread dangerous misinformation over social media and is complicit in sowing distrust of the science behind vaccines.\\" New York City measles lawsuit On April 19, 2019, the Kings County Supreme Court dismissed a lawsuit in which Robert Krakow, Robert F. Kennedy Jr. and Patricia Finn of Children‚Äôs Health Defense represented five parents of unvaccinated children protesting the decision by New York City authorities to impose mandatory measles-mumps-rubella vaccinations for residents in parts of Williamsburg, as a response to the epidemic of measles in that area. The lawsuit was filed four days earlier against the New York City Department of Health and Human Hygiene and its commissioner. In his ruling, Judge Lawrence Knipel indicated that the arguments presented by the plaintiffs amounted to little more than \\"unsupported, bald faced opinion\\". Responding to Children's Health Defense's claims that the city's reaction to a \\"garden-variety annual measles outbreak\\" was excessive, the judge pointed out that the documents filed as evidence in fact demonstrated otherwise. He concluded that \\"the unvarnished truth is that these diagnoses represent the most significant spike in incidences of measles in the United States in many years and that the Williamsburg section of Brooklyn is at its epicenter. It has already begun to spread to remote locations.\\" See also *Polio eradication *Science Moms *Freedom Angels Foundation References  External links  *The Science Moms documentary (covering topics of concern to parents such as vaccine safety) *Children's Hospital of Philadelphia - Vaccine Education Center Category:Anti-vaccination organizations Category:Autism pseudoscience Category:Non-profit organizations based in Georgia (U.S. state) Category:Organizations established in 2016 Category:Anti-vaccination in the United States Category:Conspiracy theorists ","title":"Children's Health Defense"},{"id":"60189229","text":"Galloping Gallagher is a 1924 American silent western film directed by Albert S.

She has developed the microorganisms that live on cheese into a model system for complex interacting microbial communities. She has worked with chefs including Dan Felder, head of research and development at Momofuku to develop new fermentation procedures to be used in food and has been called the \\"go-to microbiologist\\" for chefs and gastronomists. She is an assistant professor in the Division of Biological Sciences at the University of California, San Diego.  Early life and education  Dutton grew up in South San Francisco, California. She earned her B.Sc. in molecular biology at the University of California, San Diego in 2002. She performed her Ph.D. work in the laboratory of Jon Beckwith at Harvard Medical School, graduating in 2010.  Career  In 2010, Dutton became an independent Bauer Fellow at Harvard University, where she initiated a study of the microbial communities that live on cheese and give cheeses their particular flavors. She reasoned that cheese microbes would be less complex and more consistent than other microbial communities such as the gut microbiome or soil microorganisms, and therefore act as a model system in which principles of microbial interactions in more complex communities and ecosystems could be investigated. To begin her studies, she learned to make cheese herself, and collaborated with local artisan cheesemakers. By sequencing the microorganisms found on 137 cheese rinds from 10 different countries, she identified 24 genera of bacteria and fungi that are dominant in cheese microbial communities. She developed a microbiological culture system that mimics the normal conditions of community formation to reconstruct and manipulate the interactions between species in these communities, identifying widespread bacterial-fungal interactions. She uses these cultures to investigate the genetic requirements for community interactions and how horizontal gene transfer affects the genetic makeup of species in these communities. Dutton collaborates widely with chefs and cheesemakers, and has appeared in the Netflix documentary Cooked, (episode 4) the PBS documentary series The Mind of a Chef, (season 1, episode 2), and on the podcasts Science Friday and Meet the Microbiologist. In 2015 Dutton moved to the University of California, San Diego, where she is an assistant professor in the Division of Biological Sciences, Section on Molecular Biology.

Born into a family of schoolteachers keen on preserving the language and culture of Brittany, she graduated as a teacher of philosophy from the √âcole normale sup√©rieure de jeunes filles. After teaching philosophy, she joined the CNRS as a historian. Her research and writings are centred on the French Revolution and on the French secular education system. Notable publications include L'√âcole, l'√âglise et la R√©publique, 1871‚Äì1914 (1963) and La f√™te r√©volutionnaire, 1789‚Äì1799 (1976), published in English as Festivals and the French Revolution (1988). Biography Born on 24 February 1931 at Lannilis, Finist√®re, Mona Annig Sohier is the daughter of the schoolteachers Yann Sohier (1901‚Äì1935) and Anne Le Den. In 1955, she married the historian :fr:Jacques Ozouf (1928‚Äì2006). After, her father died when she was only four years old, she was brought up by her mother and grandmother. She was rarely allowed outside the school where her mother was headmistress, except for regular visits to the village church with her grandmother. As a result, she became fascinated by literature, reading all the books she could lay her hands on. After attending high school in Saint-Brieuc, she studied philosophy at the √âcole Normale Sup√©rieure from 1952. Like many of her fellow students, she joined the Communist party but left four years later after the repression of the Hungarian Revolution of 1956, deciding not to become involved in politics. She taught philosophy for a period but then turned to history after meeting a group of historians, Denis Richet, Emmanuel Le Roy Ladurie and Fran√ßois Furet at the National Library. She worked with them to produce the Dictionnaire critique de la R√©volution fran√ßaise, published in English in 1988 as A Critical Dictionary of the French Revolution. With her husband who died in 1977, she developed La R√©publique des instituteurs, published in 1989. Becoming a recognized scholar of the French Revolution, in 1976 she published her seminal work, La f√™te r√©volutionnaire, 1789‚Äì1799. The English translation, Festivals and the French Revolution was published in 1988. Her analysis of the symbols and images of the many different festivals she reviewed contributed significantly to the understanding of the Revolution and of French culture in general. Ozouf has also undertaken an analysis of ten outstanding women in French history, publishing Les Mots des femmes or Women's Words in 1995. Awards and honours Ozouf has received many prestigious awards and honours, including the Grand prix Gobert in 2004 for her historical work, the literary prize Prix mondial Cino Del Duca in 2007, the Ordre des Arts et des Lettres also in 2007, and the Breton awards Order of the Ermine and Prix Breizh in 2009. More recently, she has been honoured as a Commander of National Order of Merit (2011), Commander of the Legion of Honour (2014), the Prix de la langue fran√ßaise (2015) and Grand Officer of the National Order of Merit (2017).

In a 2013 visit to Lithuania she met with the director of the Genocide and Resistance Research Centre of Lithuania and queried him on Noreika, in his capacity as district chief, signing orders for the rounding up of Jews to ghettos. According to Foti, the director responded that \\"It is psychologically difficult to comprehend what he was thinking and feeling when he signed those papers.\\" She consulted with Saulius Suziedelis, who \\"obliquely warned her about what she might find\\". With Holocaust guide Simon Dovidavicius, Foti retraced Noreika's path and discovered that wartime Nazi collaboration, by Noreika and many others, was an open secret. In Lithuania, Foti met with one of her aunts who said that Noreika lived in a Plungƒó house that had \\"suddenly become free\\". Queried the aunt said that \\"The Jews were gone, so the house was free\\", and when asked on Noreika's responsibility she said \\"Maybe he had no choice\\". However, to Foti the horrific truth was self evident. Despondent she stopped work on her manuscript and even considered burning it. However while studying creative nonfiction her instructors urged her to finish the book, focusing on Noreika's responsibility. In 2018 she published in Salon an essay on her discoveries, which was named as one of the best pieces of the year.Best of 2018: My grandfather wasn't a Nazi-fighting war hero ‚Äî he was a brutal collaborator, Salon, Silvia Foti, republished 30 December 2018 Based on her research, Foti wrote an affidavit in support of Grant Gochin's lawsuit against the Genocide and Resistance Research Centre. The lawsuit demands the revocation of the certificate of good conduct during the war, issued by the centre. Gochin praised Foti, saying \\"Her integrity restores my faith in humanity.

It stars Sunny Kaushal and Rukshar Dhillon. Initially planned to release on 13 September 2019 and then 1 November, it was theatrically released in India on 3 January 2020.  Cast  * Sunny Kaushal as Jaggi/\\"Kaptaan\\" Singh * Rukshar Dhillon as Simi Kohli * Shriya Pilgaonkar as Nimmo * Parmeet Sethi as Jaggi's father * Jayati Bhatia as Jaggi's mother * Samir Soni as Simi's father * Sheeba Chaddha as Simi's mother * Mahavir Bhullar as Kaptaan's father * Seema Kaushal as Kaptaan's mother * Kamlesh Gill as Nimmo's grandmother * Varun Narang as Bhangra competition judge * Mark Bennington as Henderson * Sarthak Kakar as Pappi  Plot  Set in Amritsar, the movie narrates the story of two generations. Kaptaan, the grandfather of the protagonist Jaggi Singh, is a former army soldier whose passion is Bhangra. He continues to perform Bhangra after being recruited in the army. On the battlefield as well, he motivates his comrades to get up by beating a drum and performing Bhangra. Unfortunately, Kaptaan loses a leg in the war, and feels dejected and refuses to go home. Back home, Nimmo, the girl he loves, is about to get married. Kaptaan had met Nimmo at a neighbouring wedding and wooed her family by performing Bhangra in the duel. Her brothers order Kaptaan to come ask for Nimmo's hand after the war, but as he fails to come, they arrange her alliance elsewhere. In the camp, Kaptaan's comrades cheer him up by beating the drum, and motivate him to return home. He goes to Nimmo's house in the middle of her wedding preparations, and dances on one leg to woo her family again. Nimmo enters with the drum and provides him with support, and the family agrees to their wedding. In the present, Jaggi Singh is a Bhangra aspirant from Khalsa college who wants Bhangra to make it big in the world. Kaptaan is Jaggi's idol, and he believes that in order to perform the main move in Bhangra, the \\"jhoomar\\", one has to be in love. He meets Simi Kohli in a wedding and they immediately hit it off. Later, they find out they are from rival colleges Khalsa and GNDU, in the international Bhangra competition, and part ways. Both teams get through the semi finals, and Jaggi and Simi come closer. Simi falls in love, and dances her heart out in the qualifier round, which leads to GNDU winning the ticket to the finals in London. The qualifier round results lead to a crowd clash between the two teams, and Jaggi gets injured in the leg while trying to break off the fights. Upset, Jaggi then ignores Simi, breaks it off with his team, and returns to his village, where he eventually reunites with the village Bhangra group, Pendu Club, run by his father. Pendu Club starts making dance videos and enters the competition in London through crowdfunding. Both GNDU and Pendu Club are able to clear the semi final rounds. Jaggi and Simi meet again, and spend time together near the London Eye. He tells her about Kaptaan and Nimmo, and she tells him about her father who had abandoned her, who she recently met in London. They grow closer. Later, in the final round, Jaggi finds his leg collapsing. Simi enters in the wings with a drum, motivating Jaggi to keep dancing. He also performs \\"jhoomar\\" with the same energy now, and Pendu Club wins the competition. Simi and Jaggi finally unite as lovers.  Production  Ronnie Screwvala, launching debutante Sneha Taurani as director, planned this music and dance film. Bhangra Paa Le is set to be a bridge between the traditional forms of Bhangra from Punjab and western dance forms from all across the world.

He started his career around 1912 in Paris, where he specialized in cubism. Later, in the US, he became a respected member of the New York School of abstract- expressionism. Albert Kostin was directly influenced by Pablo Picasso and worked with Jackson Pollock.  Early life  Albert Kostin was born in 1892 in Odessa (Russia) where he attended the School of Arts. When he was in his twenties, he did what so many other young Russian artists had done before him: move to Paris, the city where modern art was exploding.The unknown Albert Kostin (De Telegraaf/The Netherlands, 6-1-1995) Paris In Paris, Kostin settled near art-centre La Ruche and came into contact with the artistic circle of Montparnasse. This group of artists focussed on modern art movements such as luminism, expressionism, fauvism, futurism and -especially- cubism. It is said he worked in Paris in the studio of Georges Braque and was directly influenced by Pablo Picasso. He worked in the centre of the School of Paris for about six years and made a series of cubistic compositions. In 1918, shortly after World War I ended, Kostin emigrated to the USA.Albert Kostin (1892‚Äì1984): \\"Paintings\\" (Joosten Gallery, Amsterdam The Netherlands, 1995).

He married Pauline (1896-?) and became the father of two sons: Abraham (1921-?) and Jesse (1925-2008). Gradually his fame as an artist grew, as he participated in international group expositions with Friez, Kisling, Derain, Jacobi, Picasso, Braque, De Vlaminck, Utrillo and Dufy. His art developed to a new form of abstraction, noted and appreciated both by art critics as well as galleries. At the end of the 1940s, he was offered several solo-exhibitions. In the second half of the 20th century, although he was still active as a painter, he was no longer interested in exhibiting his paintings. He gave away most of his work. He moved to Los Angeles, where he died in 1984.Albert Kostin in the 1940 U.S. Census, https://www.ancestry.com/1940-census/usa/New-York/Albert- Kostin_6m1mThe New York Times, September 17, 1941, \\"Modern Gallery shows varied art\\" (Edward Allen Jewell)The New York Times, September 21, 1941, \\"Melange of new shows\\" (Edward Allen Jewell)The New York Times, May 9, 1949, \\"Top events in Art\\"Arts Magazine, volume 24, 1949, \\"The great calendar of American exhibitions\\"The New Yorker, volume 25, page 12, 1949The unknown Albert Kostin (De Telegraaf/The Netherlands, 6-1-1995) Work During his stay in Paris between 1912 and 1918, Kostin made a series of table- compositions, influenced by Pablo Picasso, George Braque and the group of Montparnasse painters (Le Fauconnier, Leger and Metzinger). These table compositions are characterized by a new geometry, vivid and transparent colors and spatial effects. In the 1930s, he worked in the US with Georgia O'Keeffe, Milton Avery and Stuart Davis, painting a series of luminist landscapes. In the 1940s, when his paintings were shown in major New York Galleries, his work developed to abstract color compositions (‚ÄúMore or less influenced by Graham Vivian Sutherland‚Äù The New Yorker, May 1949) and later to a subtile form of action-painting.

Neurotubules are stained in green and mitochondria are stained in red. Structure of a neurotubule.Neurotubules are microtubules found in neurons in nervous tissues. Along with neurofilaments and microfilaments, they form the cytoskeleton of neurons. Neurotubules are undivided hollow cylinders that are made up of tubulin protein polymers and arrays parallel to the plasma membrane in neurons. Neurotubules have an outer diameter of about 23 nm and an inner diameter, also known as the central core, of about 12 nm. The wall of the neurotubules is about 5 nm in width. There is a non-opaque clear zone surrounding the neurotubule and it is about 40 nm in diameter. Like microtubules, neurotubules are greatly dynamic and the length of them can be adjusted by polymerization and depolymerization of tubulin. Despite having similar mechanical properties, neurotubules are distinct from microtubules found in other cell types with regards to their function and intracellular arrangement. Most neurotubules are not anchored in the microtubule organizing center (MTOC) like conventional microtubules do. Instead, they are released for transport into dendrites and axons after their nucleation in the centrosome. Therefore, both ends of the neurotubules terminates in the cytoplasm instead. Neurotubules are crucial in various cellular processes in neurons. Together with neurofilaments, they help to maintain the shape of a neuron and provide mechanical support. Neurotubules also aid the transportation of organelles, vesicles containing neurotransmitters, messager RNA and other intracellular molecules inside a neuron.Bear MF, Connors BW, Paradso MA. Neuroscience : exploring the brain (3rd ed.). Lippincott Williams & Wilkins. p. 41.  Structure and dynamics  Formation of neurotubuleAn animation showing a 'catastrophe' event, which can rapidly reduce the length of a growing neurotubule.  Composition  Like microtubules, neurotubules are made up of protein polymers of Œ±-tubulin and Œ≤-tubulin. Œ±-tubulin and Œ≤-tubulin are globular proteins that are closely related. They join together to form a dimer, called tubulin. Neurotubules are generally assembled by 13 protofilaments which are polymerized from tubulin dimers. As a tubulin dimer consists of one Œ±-tubulin and one Œ≤-tubulin, one end of the neurotubule is exposed with the Œ±-tubulin and the other end with Œ≤-tubulin, these two ends contribute to the polarity of the neurotubule ‚Äì the plus (+) end and the minus (-) end. The Œ≤-tubulin subunit is exposed on the plus (+) end. The two ends differ in their growth rate: plus (+) end is the fast-growing end while minus (-) end is the slow-growing end. Both ends have their own rate of polymerization and depolymerization of tubulin dimers, net polymerization causes the assembly of tubulin, hence the length of the neurotubules.  Dynamic instability  The growth of neurotubules is regulated by dynamic instability. It is characterized by distinct phases of growth and rapid shrinkage. The transition from growth to rapid shrinkage is called a 'catastrophe'. The reverse is called a 'rescue'.  Polarized neurotubule arrays  Neurons have a polarized neurotubule network. Axons of most neurons contain neurotubules with plus (+) end uniformly pointing towards the axon terminal and minus (-) end orienting towards the cell body, similar to the general orientation of microtubules in other cell types. On the other hand, dendrites contain neurotubules with mixed polarities. Half of them point their plus (+) end towards the dendritic top and the other half points it towards the cell body, reminiscent of the anti-parallel microtubule array of the mitotic spindle. The polarized neurotubule network forms the basis for selective cargo trafficking into axons and dendrites. For example, when mutations occur in dynein, a motor protein that is crucial in maintaining the uniform orientation of axonal neurotubules, the neurotubule polarity in axon becomes mixed. Dendritic proteins are mis-trafficked into axons as a result. For unpolarized neurons, the neurites contain 80% neurotubules with plus (+) end facing the terminal.  Axonal Transport  Neurotubules are responsible for the trafficking of intracellular materials. The cargoes are transported by motor proteins that uses neurotubules as a 'track'. The axonal transport can be classified according to speed - fast or slow, and according to direction - anterograde or retrograde.  Fast and slow axonal transportation  The cargoes are transported at a fast rate or a slow rate. The fast axonal transport has a rate of 50‚Äì500 mm per day, while the slow axonal transport was found to be 0.4 mm per day in goldfish, 1‚Äì10 mm per day in mammalian nerve. Transport of insoluble protein contributes to the fast movement while the slow transport is transporting up to 40% - 50% soluble protein. The speed of transport depends on the types of cargo to be transported. Neurotrophins, a family of proteins important for the survival of neuron, as well as organelles, such as mitochondria and endosomes, are transported at a fast rate. In contrast, structural proteins such as tubulin and neurofilament subunits are transported at lower rates. Proteins that are transported from the spinal cord to the foot can take up to a year to complete the journey.  Anterograde transport and retrograde transport  A kinesin \\"walking\\" on a neurotubule to transport cargoes. Anterograde transport refers to the transportation of cargoes from the minus (-) end to the plus (+) end, whereas retrograde transport is the transportation of cargoes in the opposite direction. Anterograde transport is often the transportation from the cell body to the periphery of the neuron whereas retrograde transport brings organelles and vesicles away from the axon terminus to the cell body. Anterograde transport is regulated by kinesins, a class of motor proteins. Kinesins have two head domains which work together like feet ‚Äì one binds to the neurotubules, and then another binds while the former dissociates. The binding of ATP rises the affinity of kinesins for neurotubules. When ATP binds to one head domain, a conformational change will be induced in the head domain, causing it to bind tightly on the neurotubule. Another ATP then binds to another head domain while the former ATP is hydrolyzed and the head domain is dissociated. The process repeats itself as cycles so that kinesins move along the neurotubules together with the organelles and vesicular cargoes they carry. Retrograde transport is regulated by dyneins, also a class of motor proteins. It shares similar structures with kinesins, as well as the transporting mechanism. It transports cargoes from the periphery to the cell body in neurons.  Proteins associated with neurotubules  One most well- studied MAP is the Tau protein, due to its clinical significance in Alzheimer's disease. Microtubule-associated proteins (MAPs) are proteins that interact with microtubules by binding to their tubulin subunits and regulating their stability. The MAPs make-up of neurotubules is notably different from microtubules of non-neuronal cells.Al-Bassam J, Ozer RS, Safer D, Halpain S, Milligan RA (June 2002). \\"MAP2 and tau bind longitudinally along the outer ridges of microtubule protofilaments\\". J. Cell Biol. 157 (7): 1187‚Äì96. doi:10.1083/jcb.200201048. PMC 2173547. PMID 12082079. For example, type II MAPs are exclusively found in neurons and not in other cells. The most well- studied ones include MAP2, and tau. MAPs are differentially distributed within the neuronal cytoplasm. Their distribution varies across different stages of development of a neuron as well. A juvenile isoform of MAP2 is present on neurotubules of axons and dendrites of developing neurons but becomes down- regulated as neurons mature. The adult isoform of MAP2 is enriched in the neurotubules of dendrites and is virtually absent from axonal neurotubules. In contrast, tau is absent on neurotubules of dendrites and its presence is limited to axonal neurotubules. The phosphorylation of tau at certain sites is required for tau to bind to neurotubules. In a healthy neuron, this process does not occur at a significant degree in dendrites, causing the absence of tau on dendritic neurotubules. The binding of tau of different isoforms and of different levels of phosphorylation regulate the stability of neurotubule. It is found that neurotubules of the neurons in embryonic central nervous system contain more highly phosphorylated tau than those in adults.Kanemaru K, Takio K, Miura R, Titani K, Ihara Y (May 1992). \\"Fetal-type phosphorylation of the tau in paired helical filaments\\". Journal of Neurochemistry. 58 (5): 1667‚Äì75. doi:10.1111/j.1471-4159.1992.tb10039.x. PMID 1560225. Additionally, tau is responsible for neurotubule bundling.Mandelkow E, Mandelkow EM (February 1995). \\"Microtubules and microtubule-associated proteins\\". Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 7 (1): 72‚Äì81. doi:10.1016/0955-0674(95)80047-6. PMID 7755992. Microtubule plus end tracking proteins (+TIPs) are MAPs that accumulates in the plus end of microtubules. In neurotubules, +TIPs control the neurotubule dynamics, direction of growth, and interaction with components of cell cortex. They are important in neurite extension and axon outgrowth. Many other non- neuron specific MAPs such as MAP1B and MAP6, are found on neurotubules. Moreover, the interaction between actin and some MAPs provide a potential link between neurotubules and actin filaments.  Neurological disorders related to neurotubules  Neurotubule disintegration in Alzheimer's disease.Disruption in the integrity and dynamics of neurotubules can interfere with the cellular functions they perform and cause various neurological disorders.  Alzheimer's disease  In Alzheimer's disease, hyperphosphorylation of tau protein causes the dissociation of tau from neurotubules and tau misfolding. The aggregation of misfolded tau forms insoluble neurofibrillary tangles which is a characteristic finding in Alzheimer's disease. This pathological change is called tauopathy. Neurotubules become prone to disintegration by microtubule-severing proteins when tau dissociates. As a result, essential processes in the neuron such as axonal transport and neural communication will be disrupted, forming the basis for neurodegeneration. Neurotubule disintegration is thought to occur by different mechanisms in axons and in dendrites. The detachment of tau destabilizes the neurotubules by allowing excess severing by katanin, causing it to disintegrate. Neurotubules disintegration in the axon disrupts transport of mRNA and signalling molecules to the axon terminal. For dendrites, new evidence suggests that an abnormal tau invasion into dendrites causes a heightened level of dendritic TTLL6 (Tubulin-Tyrosine-Ligase-Like-6), which elevates the polyglutamylation status of the neurotubules in dendrites. Because spastin displays strong preference for polyglutamylated microtubule, dendritic neurotubules become susceptible to spastin-induced disintegration. The loss of neurotubule networks in dendrites and axons, along with the formation of neurofibrillary tangles results in the impairment in the trafficking of important cargoes across the cell, which can eventually lead to apoptosis.  Lissencephaly  The characteristic \\"smooth brain\\" of an individual that suffers from lissencephaly, a defective neuronal migration disorder caused by muations in neurotubule-related genes Lissencephaly is a rare congenital condition in which the cerebrum loses its folds(gyri) and grooves(sulci), making the brain surface appear smooth. It is caused by defective neurons migration. The failure of post-mitotic neurons in reaching their proper positions leads to the formation of a disorganized and thickened four-layer neocortex instead of the normal six-layer neocortex. The severity of lissencephaly ranges from a complete loss of brain folds (agyria) to a general reduction in corticol folds(pachygyria). Neurotubule is central to the migration mechanism of neurons. The defective neural migration in individuals affected by lissencephaly is caused by mutations associated with neurotubule-related genes, such as LIS1 and DCX. LIS1 encodes an adaptor protein Lis1 that is responsible for stabilization of neurotubule during neuronal migration by minimizing neurotubule catastrophe. It also regulates the motor protein dynein that is crucial in the translocation of the nucleus along neurotubule. This action propels the soma of the neuron forward, which is an essential step in neuronal migration. In addition, mutations in LIS1 is found to disrupt the uniform plus-end-distal polarity in axons in animal models, causing the mistrafficking of dendritic proteins into axons. On the other hand, DCX encodes the protein doublecortin that interacts with Lis1 on top of supporting the 13 protofilament structure of neurotubule.  Chemotherapy-induced peripheral neuropathy  Chemotherapy-induced peripheral neuropathy is a pathological change in neurons caused by the disruption in the dynamics of neurotubules by chemotherapy drugs, manifesting in pain, numbness, tingling sensation and muscle weakness in limbs. It is an irreversible condition that affects about one-third of chemotherapy patients. Tubulin inhibitors inhibit mitosis in cancer cells by affecting the stability and dynamics of microtubules which forms the mitotic spindle responsible for chromosome segregation during mitosis, suppressing tumor growth. However, the same drugs also affects neurotubules in neurons. Vinblastine binds to free tubulin and lower their polymerization capacity, promoting neurotubule depolymerization. On the other hand, paclitaxel binds to the cap of neurotubules, which prevents the conversion of tubulin-bound GTP into GDP, a process that promotes neurotubule depolymerization. For in vitro neurons treated with paclitaxel, the polarity pattern of neurotubule is disturbed, which can incur long term neuronal damage. In addition, over-stabilization of neurotubules interferes with their ability to perform essential cellular functions in neurons.

The non-profit defines reproductive justice as the human right to maintain personal bodily autonomy, have children, not have children, and parent the children we have in safe and sustainable communities. Headquartered in Atlanta, Georgia, SisterSong is a national membership organization with a focus on the Southern United States. They include and represent Indigenous, Black, Asian and Pacific Islander, Arab and Middle Eastern, Latinx, and queer women and trans people. SisterSong says that they strive to center the needs of the most marginalized people of color, such as people with low incomes, young mothers, people with criminalization experience, people with HIV/AIDS, sex workers, people with disabilities, and LGBTQ people. Membership also includes white and male allies. SisterSong has built a movement that now includes many independent organizations across the country, and they remain a movement thought leader, trainer, convener, organizer, and collaboration facilitator. Monica Simpson has served as Executive Director since 2012.  History   Origins of reproductive justice  In 1994, just before attending the International Conference on Population and Development in Cairo (at which international leaders would agree that the individual right to plan one's own family must be central to global development, rather than population control efforts), a group of black women gathered for a conference sponsored by the Illinois Pro-Choice Alliance and the Ms. Foundation for Women. Their goal was to create a statement about the Clinton administration's proposed Universal Health Care plan. In the process, they coined ‚Äúreproductive justice‚Äù as a combination of ‚Äúreproductive rights‚Äù and ‚Äúsocial justice.‚Äù The women who created the reproductive justice framework were: Toni M. Bond Leonard, Reverend Alma Crawford, Evelyn S. Field, Terri James, Bisola Marignay, Cassandra McConnell, Cynthia Newbille, Loretta Ross, Elizabeth Terry, ‚ÄòAble‚Äô Mable Thomas, Winnette P. Willis, and Kim Youngblood. They launched the reproductive justice framework by publishing a full-page statement titled \\"Black Women on Universal Health Care Reform\\" with over 800 signatures in The Washington Post and Roll Call using the concept of reproductive justice in a criticism of the Clinton health care plan. These women believed that the creation of reproductive justice was necessary because they felt that the mainstream women's rights movement was led by and focused on the needs of middle class white women and did not meet the needs of women of color. In their view, the pro-choice framework focused on maintaining abortion rights and did not take into account the many ways that women of color and other marginalized women and trans people have difficulty accessing abortion even in places where it is legally allowed. The creators of reproductive justice also felt that the pro-choice framework did not align with the experiences of women of color, who often feel that the impact of systemic oppression limits their possibilities, so their reproductive lives are not guided by the self-determination that is taken for granted in the word ‚Äúchoice.‚Äù In addition, they asserted that the mainstream women's rights movement did not center other pressing issues in the reproductive lives of women of color. These issues included sterilization abuse, forced and coerced promotion of LARCs (long-acting reversible contraceptives), high maternal mortality, difficulty accessing birth support choices, unsafe drinking water in family homes, police brutality, and parents being torn from children through racially biased immigration and incarceration practices. Reproductive justice advocates say that the framework strives to center the needs and leadership of the most marginalized people, rather than the majority, and to focus on how multiple oppressions intersect in the lived experience of marginalized people. The creators of the reproductive justice framework rooted it in the international human rights framework, asserting that reproductive justice is an inalienable human right.  SisterSong‚Äôs forerunner  In 1992, six national women of color organizations came together seeking to increase their impact on the mainstream women's rights/pro-choice movement and on US policy: Asians and Pacific Islanders for Choice, National Black Women's Health Project, National Latina Health Organization, Latina Roundtable on Health and Reproductive Rights, National Coalition of 100 Black Women, and Native American Women's Health and Education Resource Center. Together, they formed Women of Color Coalition for Reproductive Health Rights (WOCCRHR). Their first action was to encourage women of color to attend the 1992 March for Women's Lives organized by NOW (National Organization of Women), while also publicly critiquing NOW for their lack of inclusivity in planning the march. NOW's decision-making included only organizations able to make large financial contributions, which they claimed effectively excluded all organizations led by women of color, as these organizations generally lacked access to resources. WOCCRHR's second action was to organize women of color to influence the United Nations International Conference on Population and Development in Cairo, Egypt in 1994 ‚Äì the same conference that helped inspire the women who created the reproductive justice framework. WOCCRHR worked with other women of color to form the US Women of Color Delegation Project for the conference, and wrote a ‚ÄúStatement on Poverty, Development, and Population Activities,‚Äù which they presented there. It connected the status of women of color in the US with that of women in developing countries and brought international attention to the issues faced by US women of color. WOCCRHR also helped women of color participate and influence the 1995 United Nations Fourth World Conference on Women in Beijing. Afterward, the coalition disbanded because their funding sources were focused on international work, and they were not able to find funding to continue their work within the US after the international conferences ended.  SisterSong‚Äôs founding and history  SisterSong was founded in 1997 by 16 women-of-color-led organizations representing African American, Asian American and Pacific Islander, Latinx, and Indigenous women, the same populations represented in WOCCRHR. They received funding from the Ford Foundation. The organization emerged from a series of symposia in New York City and Savannah in 1997-1998 convened by Reena Marcelo, then a Program Officer at the Ford Foundation's Reproductive Health Program, and Luz Rodriguez, then Executive Director of Latina Roundtable on Health and Reproductive Rights. The purpose of these gatherings was to convene women of color reproductive health educators, activists, and policymakers to identify the key challenges grassroots organizations of color were experiencing in reproductive health work. Attendees decided to use the opportunity of these convenings to form a national collective of independent organizations that would help them all to achieve greater impact, and SisterSong was born with Luz Rodriguez as its first leader. The original name of the collective was SisterSong Women of Color Reproductive Health Collective, and the original mission was to advocate for the reproductive and sexual health needs of women of color. In its early history, SisterSong expanded to include other organizations led by women of color and to include individual women of color members. Organizational members focused on issues including HIV/AIDS services, midwifery, support for incarcerated women, health screenings, advocacy for abortion and contraception, research, teen pregnancy, drug and alcohol treatment, and treatment and prevention of sexually transmitted diseases. After several years of work to develop the collective, SisterSong hosted its first national conference in November 2003 at Spelman College in Atlanta with over 600 women of color in attendance. SisterSong was a volunteer-run network until 2005, when they opened a national office in Atlanta and hired their first staff with funding from the Ford Foundation and the Moriah Fund. The first staff leader was Loretta Ross, who served as National Coordinator from 2005 to 2012. One of the women who created the reproductive justice framework, Ross came with a long history of starting new organizations and programs related to human rights, violence against women, and anti-hate work. Instead of a board of directors, SisterSong was led by a Management Circle of leaders from each ethnic community in the Collective: Indigenous, Black, Asian and Pacific Islander, and Latinx. In 2006 SisterSong incorporated as a 501c3 nonprofit. In 2007 the collective officially changed its name to SisterSong Women of Color Reproductive Justice Collective and purchased The Motherhouse in Atlanta, the historic first home of the National Black Women's Health Project, which remains the organization's headquarters today. SisterSong is strategically sited in the Deep South because they feel that this is where the rights of women of color are most threatened. In 2012, National Coordinator Loretta Ross decided to return to her roots as a scholar and thought leader working within academia. With Ross's exit, SisterSong shifted from the Management Circle model to a conventional Board of Directors model and named Monica Raye Simpson, then the organization's Development Director, as Interim Executive Director in 2012 and Executive Director in 2013. Monica Simpson had previously been the first staff person of color at Charlotte's Lesbian & Gay Community Center and won awards for organizing the first Black Gay Pride in the Bible Belt. She remains SisterSong's Executive Director today. In 2014, SisterSong selected four strategic priority areas: # Reproductive justice training to build the capacity of reproductive justice advocates and groups and to bring the framework into mainstream use # Centering black women‚Äôs leadership and issues because SisterSong believes that black people are the most maligned in the US # Building Southern synergy to increase reproductive justice collaboration across the region, which SisterSong asserts is critical because the South has powerful opponents of reproductive freedom linking their agenda to Southern culture, while Southern reproductive justice advocates are under-resourced and stretched thin working across large geographical areas # Using arts and culture to reach new audiences and eradicate bigotry within US culture In 2016, SisterSong opened a second office in North Carolina focused on building a state-based reproductive justice movement there.  Projects   Movement building  As the first reproductive justice organization, SisterSong has inspired or mentored many of its successors. SisterSong was particularly involved in launching New Voices for Reproductive Justice in 2004, Milwaukee Reproductive Justice Coalition in 2008, and Black Mamas Matter Alliance in 2017.  Spreading the influence of reproductive justice  In 2005, SisterSong partnered with Asian Communities for Reproductive Justice and California Latinas for Reproductive Justice to host the first Funders‚Äô Briefing on Reproductive Justice, specifically to explain the framework to foundations and persuade them to support movement organizations. Numerous foundations now have programs devoted to funding reproductive justice work. SisterSong has also influenced Planned Parenthood, the Unitarian Universalist Association of America, and the National Council of Jewish Women to engage in reproductive justice activism, and they have presented before the United Nations and state legislators and at the White House during the Obama administration. Their work in promoting reproductive justice has brought the concept to national politics: Hillary Clinton discussed reproductive during her presidential campaign in 2016, and Stacey Abrams mentioned it during her State of the Union Rebuttal in 2019.  National conferences  In 2003, SisterSong hosted the first national conference on reproductive justice organized by women of color at Spelman College in Atlanta with over 600 attendees. They hosted their first Let's Talk About Sex Conference in 2007 to talk openly about sex in relation to reproductive justice organizing. They repeated the Let's Talk About Sex Conference in 2011 and 2017. In 2014, they also launched the RJ Leadership Summit to convene the movement's leaders for insight sharing and movement-wide strategic planning.  Online organizing  From 2006 to 2012, SisterSong partnered with Ipas and the National Gay and Lesbian Task Force to create and maintain a website mapping the sexual and reproductive laws in every US state to provide a tool for activists. They continue to lead online organizing online.  Reproductive justice training  From 2004 to 2012, SisterSong published over a dozen issues of Collective Voices, the first reproductive justice news magazine. In 2006, they debuted RJ 101 training to introduce people to the reproductive justice framework. Since then, they have added many other reproductive justice trainings. Many organizations, such as The Center For Reproductive Health Education in Family Medicine, draw from them. In 2015, SisterSong relaunched Collective Voices as a free monthly webinar series with reproductive justice leaders talking about the intersections between reproductive justice and other topics.  Organizing in Washington, DC  In 2004, SisterSong influenced the March for Choice to expand its agenda and become the March for Women's Lives; it was the largest march in US history, with 1.2 million participants. Loretta Ross, who was to become SisterSong's leader the following year, co-directed the march. SisterSong also broadcast the perspectives of women of color at the march live on 115 radio stations in the Pacifica national network and produced Listen Up!, a documentary film following several women-of-color-led groups organizing the march. In 2009, SisterSong organized over 300 women of color to visit 40 legislators‚Äô offices on Capitol Hill to argue for abortion access and for immigrants‚Äô healthcare access during healthcare debates. In 2010, they brought another large delegation from six Southern states to Washington DC to push for healthcare reform aimed to increase healthcare access for families of color.  Billboard campaign and Trust Black Women  In 2010, SisterSong created the Trust Black Women partnership to change how the United States views black women by elevating black women's voices to eliminate stereotypes. The partnership was triggered by anti-abortion billboards in Atlanta targeting black women and calling black children ‚Äúan endangered species.\\" The billboard campaign was complemented by a documentary film, Maafa 21, which was distributed to black churches and organizations and claimed that Planned Parenthood founder Margaret Sanger was racist and that Planned Parenthood's agenda was genocide. The campaign culminated with an effort to pass a Georgia bill that would restrict abortions suspected of being motivated by the race or sex of the fetus. SisterSong disagreed with the accusation against Planned Parenthood and felt that the campaign was claiming that black women have a racial obligation to have babies, which overrides their personal desires and needs. SisterSong believed these efforts were seeking to divide black voters by gender and pro-choice voters by race, as well as to use anti-immigrant sentiments to bolster anti-abortion work by accusing Asian American women of aborting female fetuses due to son preference. SisterSong claimed that the bill would have led to racial profiling and intrusive interrogation of black and Asian American women seeking abortions, and that it would have violated patient confidentiality and made providers afraid to provide services because they could be criminalized. SisterSong convened the Trust Black Women Partnership with nine black-women-led organizations to fight the billboards and abortion restriction bill, and the group defeated both. This effort led to the creation of the documentary An Abortion Conspiracy, produced by Stuart Productions and GritTV, which showcased Trust Black Women's work on the billboards, as well as other anti-abortion initiatives and efforts to challenge them. Another documentary, We Always Resist, was also created about Trust Black Women. In 2011, the organization Strong Families/Forward Together then worked with a coalition of multiracial groups to use SisterSong's billboard strategies to successfully take down anti-abortion billboards in Oakland, California. Trust Black Women is still in operation as a national alliance of black-women-led organizations. They say that they use communications and events to combat stereotype, amplify black women's voices, organize with black women and allies for black women's rights, and connect black women with holistic care methods and resources. Still led by SisterSong, they also partner with the Movement for Black Lives to raise awareness of and address the intersectional oppressions black women face.  Southern RJ Network and Cohort  In 2010, SisterSong launched the Southern RJ Network because they felt that reproductive freedom was especially under attack in the South, making collaboration among reproductive justice groups particularly critical across the region. The Southern RJ Network then helped defeat a fetal personhood bill in Mississippi. It paused for SisterSong's leadership transition in 2012. In 2013, the Groundswell Fund formed the Southern RJ Cohort, and SisterSong became its leader. By 2017, the Southern RJ Cohort had 13 organizational members from nine Southern states and focused on the Southern RJ Policy Initiative, which aimed to stop policies threatening reproductive justice and advance policies that would move reproductive justice forward in the South.  Linking reproductive justice and Black Lives Matter  In 2014, SisterSong expanded common perceptions of what constitutes a reproductive justice issue by hosting the Standing Our Ground for Marissa Alexander Summit in Jacksonville, Florida. Florida's controversial Stand Your Ground law helped white man George Zimmerman win his freedom after shooting and killing Black teenager Trayvon Martin because he was wearing a hoodie, and Zimmerman profiled him as threatening. Yet the Stand Your Ground law did not protect Marissa Alexander, a Black woman who fired a gun in the air to defend her family by scaring off an abusive partner. SisterSong published articles that called this as a reproductive justice issue, saying that Alexander was imprisoned and separated from her children as punishment for defending herself and them from an abuser. SisterSong and the Free Marissa Now Campaign hosted a two-day summit on racism within the criminal justice system, domestic violence, and Southern reproductive justice. They also hosted a benefit concert for Alexander and a march and rally with over 200 people at the Duval County Courthouse. By showing how racial bias in the criminal justice system impacts women, children, and families, this work linked reproductive justice with Black Lives Matter. In 2015, Trust Black Women followed up on this connection by publishing a statement of solidarity with Black Lives Matter. It was announced in a media call with Black Lives Matter co-founder Alicia Garza, who talked about beginning her organizing career in the reproductive justice movement. Garza has continued to highlight the work of Trust Black Women and SisterSong, including a 2019 article about activism in the face of Georgia and Alabama's abortion bans.  Engaging Planned Parenthood in reproductive justice  In a July 2014 article, The New York Times interviewed Cecile Richards, the Executive Director of Planned Parenthood, talking about why the term ‚Äúpro-choice‚Äù has been falling out of favor. The article did not mention that women of color have been leading the critique of this term since articulating reproductive justice in 1994. In response, SisterSong published an open letter to Planned Parenthood that was signed by 39 organizations and 24 individuals and asked Richards to correct the article and publicly recognize the leadership of women of color. Richards complied immediately. She also invited SisterSong to bring a group of reproductive justice leaders to discuss how Planned Parenthood could do more to support reproductive justice organizations. This led to Planned Parenthood providing funding for reproductive justice groups, honoring leaders of color in their annual 99 Dreamkeepers, engaging SisterSong to train them in reproductive justice and advise their strategic planning, and hosting their first reproductive justice conference in 2016.  Black Mamas Matter  In 2014, SisterSong partnered with the Center for Reproductive Rights and National Latina Institute for Reproductive Health on a study about the high maternal mortality rates among Southern women of color, especially Black women. They wrote a shadow report that SisterSong presented to the United Nations Committee on the Elimination of Racial Discrimination, which adopted all of the report's recommendations. SisterSong then spoke about the issue at the 2015 Women in the World Summit. Afterward, SisterSong and the Center for Reproductive Rights founded the Black Mamas Matter Alliance, a collaboration of 24 Black-women-led organizations who work to raise awareness about the rising black maternal mortality rate. They created the Black Mamas Matter Toolkit, an online resource for groups interested in working to reduce Black maternal mortality. Black Mamas Matter grew to nearly 40 organizational members, and in 2017 became the Black Mamas Matter Alliance, an independent nonprofit fiscally sponsored by SisterSong.  Artists United  In 2016, SisterSong launched the Artists United for RJ program to facilitate artists of color to create collaborative, replicable artwork to advance reproductive justice. Projects have included concerts that raise funds and/or awareness for reproductive justice issues and Autonomy, a play designed to travel to college campuses and introduce Black students to reproductive justice.  SisterSong North Carolina  In 2016, SisterSong opened a second office in North Carolina, where there were previously no reproductive justice organizations. In February 2018, SisterSong began advocating for a review of a North Carolina Department of Public Safety policies that allows for pregnant inmates to be shackled to a hospital bed while in labor. The department later revised their policy to clearly define when wrist restraints must be removed.  Georgia abortion ban  In 2019, SisterSong acted as the lead plaintiff in a lawsuit against Georgia legislators for passing a six-week abortion ban, which bans abortion before most women even know they are pregnant. Reproductive justice advocates say that the ban is unconstitutional, and that its proponents passed it to force a court case that could reach the Supreme Court. After the 2019 confirmation of Supreme Court Justice Brett Kavanaugh, they believe that the balance of the Supreme Court became tilted against abortion rights, so bringing the abortion ban case to the Supreme Court could give it a chance to overturn Roe v. Wade, the 1972 decision that protects the legal right to abortion throughout the US.  Other collaborations  SisterSong is also involved in the Over the Counter Contraception Working Group and the All* Above All Campaign to repeal the Hyde Amendment, which prohibits federal funding from supporting abortion services, which means that women on public healthcare, federal employees, and others cannot receive healthcare coverage for abortions. In 2018, SisterSong co-founded the Southeast Alliance for Reproductive Equity (SEARE) with SPARK Reproductive Justice Now, Healthy and Free TN, and Women's Rights Empowerment Network (WREN). This alliance uses the Collective Impact model to foster collaboration among reproductive justice, reproductive rights, and reproductive health groups throughout the South. Also in 2018, SisterSong co- founded a collaboration to combat religious exemption laws with Atlanta Jobs with Justice, Women Engaged, and Georgia Equality. This is a cross-movement collaboration of reproductive justice, economic justice, and LGBTQ rights groups.

The original hotel was the country's tallest building when it opened in 1970 as the first property of Dusit International. The building was demolished for redevelopment from 2019‚Äì2020, and a new hotel with the same name is scheduled to open on the site in 2023. History The Dusit Thani hotel was founded by hotelier Thanphuying Chanut Piyaoui. It was her second hotel after the Princess Hotel on Charoen Krung Road, which opened in 1948 and expanded as Bangkok's hospitality industry grew during the Cold War period. Thanphuying Chanut conceived the Dusit Thani as an internationally recognised luxury hotel to compete with the Siam Inter-Continental Hotel, which had opened in 1966. On a visit to the Hotel Okura in Tokyo, she became impressed with the hotel's design, and enlisted Japanese architect Yozo Shibata, who had worked on the design team for the Okura, to design her new hotel. Construction was supervised by Tokyo-based C. Itoh, while Thai Obayashi served as the main contractor. The name Dusit Thani was borrowed from King Rama VI's miniature city project which experimented with democracy during the 1920s. The Dusit Thani stood on the former location of Ban Saladaeng, the former residence of the Chaophraya Yommarat, on the southeast corner of Sala Daeng Intersection, the beginning of Si Lom Road. Thanphuying Chanut secured a lease from the Crown Property Bureau, which owns the land. The hotel opened on 27 February 1970, initially managed by Western International Hotels, becoming one of Bangkok's first five-star hotels. The building, 23 storeys high with a triangular cross-section, was topped with a distinctive golden spire; it was the tallest building in the city upon its completion, at (or including the spire). The building's design featured Modernist influences as well as traditional Thai motifs such as the prachamyam patterns decorating its facade. When it opened, the Dusit Thani introduced many novelties to Bangkok's social scene, including a discotheque, ballrooms, and a restaurant on the top floor. The hotel brands itself as emphasising Thainess, from its decor to the conduct of the staff. It is the oldest property of the Dusit Thani Company, whose business has since expanded internationally to include dozens of hotels. By the 2010s, the hotel featured 517 guest rooms, and its list of guests included Gwyneth Paltrow, Whitney Houston, Ronald Reagan and Tom Jones. The building amid demolition as of June 2020 In March 2017, the company, in partnership with real estate developer Central Pattana, renewed its lease with the Crown Property Bureau for 30 years (with an extension option of an additional 30 years). It announced plans to redevelop the property as a mixed-use project, worth 36.7 billion baht ($1.1B), which would include residences, retail areas and office space, in addition to a new hotel. The hotel remained open until 5 January 2019, after which it closed for redevelopment. It is expected to reopen in 2023. Meanwhile, the company has partnered with Silpakorn University to document, archive, and preserve some of the original hotel's artistic and architectural elements.

The club took part in one edition of the Papua New Guinea National Soccer League, finishing 6th out of six teams in the 2017 edition of the competition. The club has also taken part in several editions of the Port Moresby Premier Division, having won the title once in 2011.  History  The club was founded sometime before their first competitive outing in the Port Moresby Premier Division in 2010, in which they finished runners-up to University after a 2‚Äì0 defeat in the Grand Final. The following season, they went a step further, defeating the Port Moresby School of Excellence (POMSOE) team 4‚Äì3 on penalties after a 0‚Äì0 draw, with fullback Tony Pepea scoring the winning penalty. In the 2012 edition of the competition, the club picked up the league's Minor Premiership by finishing the regular season at the top of the table, before reaching their third successive Grand Final with a 1‚Äì0 victory over PS Rutz in the semi-final. However, the side failed to defend their title, going down 1‚Äì0 in the final against University. In December 2012, it was reported that the side had expressed an interest in taking part in the 2013 Papua New Guinea National Soccer League, but had failed to pay the application fee. In the end, their participation failed to materialise. They did, however, enter the 2013 Port Moresby Premier Division, losing their opening match 4‚Äì0 against Defence on the first weekend of June before stabilising somewhat in an evenly-matched season with no runaway leader: by July, the side were level with four other teams in second place on nine points, by August they were top, but they had surrendered that lead and fallen to third by the end of the following weekend. They finished the regular season in second place behind FC Momase, before eventually losing to MacLaren FC in the playoffs, finishing third overall. Details of the club's competitive history after 2013 are unclear, until they were confirmed in February 2017 as taking part in the 2017 Papua New Guinea National Soccer League for the first time. They opened their campaign with a solid 1‚Äì1 draw against league veterans Besta PNG United, but that would prove to be their only point of the campaign, as they lost or forfeited the remainder of their matches. The side were not one of the teams registered ahead of the 2018 season.

Born in Dundalk, she was a member of the Irish Army before transferring to the Irish Air Corps in 2011, but quit following her conversion to Islam. In 2015, following the breakdown of her marriage, she travelled to Syria to join ISIS. In 2019, she was captured and detained by the US forces in northern Syria. A 2019 profile reported that Smith had probably travelled to Syria a few months after their 2011 interview with her, and was known to be in Syria in 2015. Irish security officials also told the Irish Independent that they consider Smith to have been no more than a sympathizer. Once in ISIS territory, she became the second wife of Sajid Aslam, a British jihadist. Aslam was still married to Lorna Moore, another Irish woman, who was in prison in the United Kingdom. Smith says she married Aslam as women were not allowed to live alone in ISIS territory. While there, Smith gave birth to a daughter.

She is currently on released on bail. She denies being a member of the ISIS. Relatives assert that she had never been a member of ISIS and was just a sympathizer. The charges against Smith include the allegation she was \\"a member of a terrorist group styling itself the Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant (ISIL) also known as Dawlat al-Iraq al-Islamiyya, Islamic State of Iraq (ISI), Islamic State of Iraq and Syria (ISIS) and Dawlat al Islamiya fi Iraq wa al Sham, otherwise known as 'Da'esh' and the Islamic State in Iraq and Sham\\". On April 17, 2020, her trial was adjourned, until July 17, 2020, due to the COVID‚Äë19 shutdowns. She was allowed to return to living with her child. Smith's case was one profiled in a study by the International Center for the Study of Violent Extremism, as to whether individuals had been recruited to join ISIS solely though online coaching. Smith confirmed to her interviewers she had travelled to Daesh-occupied Syria solely due to the online recruiting of a seemingly reliable online mentor. Smith told interviewers she was concerned over ISIS brutality, which he assured her was just anti-muslim propaganda.

The lodge was built in 1950 and added to the National Register of Historic Places in 2003. Originally built for a destination resort on the lake, the lodge is currently operated by the City of Maple Valley. With History Image of Thunderbird carving In the early 1900s, a homesteader whose property was on the shore of Lake Wilderness offered a few rental cabins on his farm to fishermen and hunters. The Gaffney brothers, Tom and Kane, bought the land and began developing a resort in 1926. They later bought two adjacent resort properties and combined them all into a complex of about sixty rental cabins that offered indoor and outdoor recreation, including boat rentals, a golf course, a bowling alley, a dance hall, a roller rink, and a restaurant. The resort was a popular destination for locals and visitors during World War II. As part of their modernization effort after the end of the war, the Gaffneys hired the architecture firm of Young, Richardson, Carleton & Detlie to design the new lodge. The architecture firm won first honor awards from American Institute of Architects in 1952 for Gaffney's Lake Wilderness Lodge. The lodge is a 3-story wood-frame structure, clad in white cement stucco. The walls are primarily glass panes framed in fir. The architects designed the lodge to be viewed from both the lake and entry sides. A long canopy provides shelter for arriving guests on the entry side. Natural fir is used extensively inside through support columns and exposed beams. The north wing contains 10 guest rooms with small balconies and private bathrooms. On the lake side, the lodge is wrapped by a concrete deck, supported on two rows of concrete columns and concrete beams. The lodge contains a 33-foot Thunderbird sculpture, carved from a -foot diameter cedar log by Dudley C. Carter. A free-standing staircase spirals around the sculpture which serves as the centerpiece of the mezzanine. The Gaffneys added a 2,400-foot airstrip to encourage visitors to take air taxis to the resort. In 1952, the air taxi fee from Bellevue Airfield was $10 for one person. King County, Washington purchased the lake property in 1966 and leased it out as a convention center. In 2003, the property was transferred to the City of Maple Valley.

At the beginning of the conflict, the Thebans attacked the city of Plataea, an Athenian ally on the border between Boeotia and Attica. The initial Theban attempt to capture the city failed, but in 429 BC the Thebans' allies, the Spartans under their king Archidamus II, laid siege to the city. Left unaided by Athens, the Plataeans finally surrendered in 428 BC. Plataea was razed to the ground by the Thebans, and was not restored until after 338 BC by Philip II of Macedon. First Theban attack According to Thucydides, an armed force of 300 Thebans commanded by two leading Theban generals were admitted after dark on a stormy moonless night into Plataea by two private citizens who expected the Theban force to immediately capture and kill the democratic leaders and bring Plataea into alliance with Thebes. Instead the Theban commanders harmed no one but attempted to persuade all of the citizens of Plataea to join with Thebes' allies. The democratic leadership accepted the offer but quickly worked out that the invading force could be overpowered because of their small numbers, their lack of knowledge of the streets, the bad weather, and the darkness. The enraged citizenry then attacked them. In one of the rare instances in which both women and slaves took part in what amounted to warfare, the citizenry killed over half the 300 Thebans. Thucydides reports that a number of the remaining Thebans escaped with the help of a Plataean woman who provided them with an axe to break open one of the town's gates. Some of the invaders tried to escape by jumping off the city wall, but most of these were killed in the fall. Others entered a large open building, mistaking it for an exit from the town. The Plataeans locked the building and held them there for a short time before killing them all. A second larger Theban force was supposed to reinforce the invading force, but the weather and the flooding of the Asopos river delayed them. The Plataeans, to forestall any attempt by the second force to capture Plataeans who lived outside the walls, agreed to let their Theban prisoners live if the Thebans did no further harm. Each side alleged later that the other had taken an oath to the agreement and then broke it, a potentially serious issue in the propaganda war that would impact on future relations between the two sides. After the invaders had entered the town, a Plataean messenger was sent to Athens to alert them to what was happening. A second messenger later that night updated the Athenians on the outcome. The Athenians sent a messenger back to Plataea instructing them not to kill the prisoners, but he arrived too late. The Plataeans had already killed them all. The Athenians also sent a force to relieve Plataea. Women, children, and men too old or otherwise unfit for military service were evacuated to Attica. Thucydides states (Book II.1‚Äì6) that these events, during which Thebes and its Boeotian allies lost over 10 per cent of their total army, represented the beginning of the Peloponnesian War, which would go on for another 27 years. He says that \\"the treaty had now been broken by an overt act after the affair at Plataea\\" and that \\"Athens and Lacedaemon now resolved to send embassies to the King and to such other of the barbarian powers as either party could look to for assistance.\\" Spartan intervention and siege During the summer two years after these events occurred, the Spartan king Archidamus II finally led a Peloponnesian force against Plataea and began to raze their crops. The Plataeans, in response, dispatched a herald reminding the Spartans of the glorious deeds the Plataeans performed during the Greco-Persian War and of the oath the Spartans swore to protect them and keep them independent and reminding the Spartans that in 479 BC Pausanias, the Spartan general, had decreed that Plataea was on holy ground and it should never be attacked.Thucydides: Der Peloponnesische Krieg, II, 71 (2), translated and edited by Helmut Vretska and Werner Rinner. Reclam, Stuttgart, Germany, 2002. The Spartans responded by demanding Plataean neutrality in return for their protection. After consulting Athens, Plataea rejected the Spartan proposal and began in earnest to prepare their defences. The Spartans then quickly laid siege to the city, and employed several innovative, yet unsuccessful tactics to bypass the Plataean defences. Failing in these undertakings, the Spartans built a line of fortifications around the city, left enough troops to guard the walls, then retired. Sortie of the defenders The winter of the next year found the Plataeans in a desperate situation. They were besieged by the Spartans and Boeotians and were uncertain whether any Athenian help would arrive. Their stores were running dangerously low, and so a desperate plan was developed to try and salvage their position. The plan involved breaking past the Spartan defences and escape; originally all the men were to join the attempt, but the danger being so great, only 220 ultimately agreed to go. They accordingly waited for a dark, stormy night, and implemented the plan. Catching the guards by surprise, 212 men managed to evade capture. Thucydides writes, \\"it was mainly the violence of the storm that enabled them to effect their escape at all.\\" Surrender The remaining Plataeans finally surrendered to the Spartans in the summer of the next year, as all supplies they had were exhausted and no hope of help remained. They had trusted the Spartans to a fair trial, as the Lacedaemonians (Spartans) had promised to \\"judge them all fairly\\", and that \\"only the guilty should be punished\\" if they yielded. Yet, when the Plataean prisoners were brought before the judges, no trial was held; no chance for apology was offered. The Spartans simply asked each of the prisoners if they had done the Lacedaemonians and allies any service in the war, to which the prisoners, after a heated debate, ultimately had to answer \\"no\\". Thus the Spartans killed over 200 of the Plataean defenders \\"among which were 25 Athenians\\" according to Thucydides. The Thebans ultimately razed the entire town, and > built on to the precinct of Hera an inn two hundred feet square, with rooms > all round above and below, making use for this purpose of the roofs and > doors of the Plataeans: of the rest of the materials in the wall, the brass > and the iron, they made couches which they dedicated to Hera, for whom they > also built a stone chapel of a hundred feet square. The choice of Hera as the goddess glorified at the expense of the dispossessed Plataeans might have been motivated by Hera's alleged jealousy of Zeus' giving birth to Athena, patron goddess of Athens, without recourse to her. The conspicuous worship of Hera at Plataea continued long past the end of the war. In later times the temple was renowned for a sculpture by Callimachus of Hera seated as a bride, as well as a sculpture of a matronly Hera in a standing position.Pausanias, 9.2.7 ‚Äì 9.3.3 ; Pausanias explains this by telling the myth of the Daedala. Aftermath and the reconstruction of Plataea Thebes occupied the site of Plataea until 387 BC. Athens harbored the city's survivors. The Thebans were on the losing side in the Corinthian War and the 387 Peace of Antalcidas required Thebes disband its Boeotian League. This made possible the rebuilding of Plataea in 386. However, with the resurgence of Thebes and the creation of the Theban hegemony by Epaminondas, the Thebans destroyed Plataea again in 373. In 338 BC, after Philip II of Macedon defeated the Thebans at the Battle of Chaeronea, he reestablished Plataea as \\"a symbol of Greek courage in resisting the Persians\\". His son, Alexander the Great in 335 altogether destroyed Thebes, whereupon its territory was divided among the cities of Boeotia ‚Äì evidently, the rebuilt Plataea shared in this territorial division.

Yamaguchi was a former writer for Gong Magazine, and attained his greatest fame in the World Wrestling Federation (WWF), as the manager of Kai En Tai in 1998.  Professional wrestling career  A lifelong fan of professional wrestling, Yamaguchi's career began in the 1970s as a writer for Gong Magazine. In the 1980s, he began working for various Japanese promotions in both behind-the-scenes and in-ring positions such as referee, manager, and commentator. He founded Frontier Martial-Arts Wrestling with Atsushi Onita in 1989, Universal Lucha Libre with Gran Hamada in 1990, and Michinoku Pro Wrestling with The Great Sasuke in 1993. Because of his fluency in English, he was responsible for booking gaijin talent in Japan, as well as booking Japanese talent overseas. He would also accompany Japanese talent booked overseas to not only oversee the tour, but to assist them in making the travel easier and fun.  World Wrestling Federation/WWF (1998)  In March 1998, Yamaguchi signed with the World Wrestling Federation (WWF) under the ring name Yamaguchi-san. He recruited Sho Funaki, Mens Teioh, and Dick Togo to form the stable Kai En Tai, who feuded with Taka Michinoku. They defeated Michinoku and Bradshaw at the Over The Edge pay-per-view. Following this, the stable began a storyline with Val Venis, who had been sleeping with Yamaguchi-san's wife, Kiyoko, with an enraged Yamaguchi-san being shown a pornographic video of the incident. The following week, during a Val Venis match, Yamaguchi-san cut a promo in which he chopped a salami in two with a sword as a threat to Venis that he would \\"choppy choppy [his] pee pee\\". Taka Michinoku turned on Venis during a tag team match against Togo and Funaki, effectively turning heel and joining Kaientai, Mrs. Yamaguchi was also later revealed to be Michinoku's sister. Venis was dragged backstage to seemingly have his penis amputated, which led to the infamous \\"castration\\" scene on the 3 August episode of Raw Is War. Venis later explained that Yamaguchi's sword narrowly missed his penis, owing to a \\"little shrinkage\\" and some timely assistance from \\"friend\\" John Wayne Bobbitt. Yamaguchi, Togo and Teioh were later granted their release and returned to Japan, while Taka and Funaki stayed and became a regular tag team.  Personal life  Yamaguchi's younger brother, Shun, currently works for WWE as a Japanese commentator for pay-per-view events.  Death  Yamaguchi suffered a stroke in December 2017 that left him bedridden. He died on 9 March 2019 at age 60, after a lengthy battle with an undisclosed illness.

The City Art Centre has a collection which include historic and modern Scottish painting and photography, as well as contemporary art and craft. It is an exhibition based venue with no permanent displays. The City Art Centre is home to the City of Edinburgh's Recognised collection of Scottish Art. Edinburgh's fine art collection is approximately 4,800 pieces of Scottish work in a variety of mediums. Artists such Fergusson, Eardley, Paolozzi are represented in the collection as well as many other Edinburgh based and Scottish artists. Artists are represented dating from the 17th century to the present day.  History  In 1971 the City Art Centre was housed in the former Royal High School. In 1975 the reform of the Scottish local government brought the City Museums and the City Art Centre together the new council directorate of the Recreation Department. The City Art Centre was then rehoused to its current Market Street location in 1980. The current City Art Centre building dates from 1899 to 1902 and was the work of Dunn and Findlay. Built as an extension to the Scotsman newspaper office, it later became part of the city‚Äôs wholesale fruit and vegetable market. Designed as a nine storey iron-framed warehouse, it is clad in stone to create a restrained Beaux Arts facade. It has public galleries on 6 floors. The original conversion of the building in 1980 was undertaken by the City Architect's Department under the direction of the then City Architect, Brian Annable, and it garnered a RIBA Award for Architecture in 1983. In the 1990s more space was created by extending into the upper floors. Natural materials and neutral colours are used throughout the interior to create flexible contemporary exhibition spaces.  Collections  In 1961 Miss Jean Watson, an Edinburgh resident, at first gave and then later bequeathed money to create a collection of Scottish Art for the City of Edinburgh. The fund is administered by the City Council and is still in use today. Soon after Miss Watson gave her initial sum of money, a Committee was formed to administer the funds. One of their first decisions was to commission a bronze bust of Miss Watson herself from a sculptor, Eric Schilsky. From the outset, the Committee opted to purchase contemporary works of art by Scottish artists or artists based in Scotland. One of their first purchases was Obsession by John Bellany. Since then, more than 900 paintings, drawings, sculpture, photographs and prints have been added. Works by contemporary artists such as Moyna Flannigan, Calum Colvin, Peter Howson and Dame Elizabeth Blackadder have all been acquired with Bequest Funds. In 1964 more than 300 of the works owned by the Scottish Modern Arts Association were donated to the City of Edinburgh during the dissolution of the Scottish Modern Arts Association. These are now housed in the City Art Centre. The Scottish Arts Council began collecting in 1951, with a focus on the purchase of artworks by contemporary Scottish based artists. In the mid 1990s the Scottish Arts Council took the decision to distribute its collection of approximately 2,000 works by contemporary Scottish artists to museums and galleries throughout Scotland. Institutions were given the opportunity to view the collection and submit proposals for acquisition, the City Art Centre applied and in 1998 received 123 works of art. Through the National Collecting Scheme for Scotland, six major museums and art galleries, including the City Art Centre, have been able to acquire new works by contemporary artists. The Scheme has been in operation since 2003, and was established to assist museums and galleries throughout Scotland purchase work by contemporary artists and craft makers. To avoid duplication, each member gallery is invited to collect within a broad theme. In recognition of Edinburgh‚Äôs World Heritage Site Status, the City Art Centre is acquiring works all of which have an urban or architectural theme. Since the scheme began, the City Art Centre have acquired a variety of work including film, photography and installation. Artists now represented include Toby Paterson, Christine Borland, Graham Fagen, Rosalind Nashashibi, Nathan Coley and Rose Frain. In collaboration with Edinburgh Libraries, the Museums & Galleries Edinburgh show their collection on Capital Collections. Capital Collections is an image library which allows a selection of collections to be viewed.

He is best known for his aerobatic skills and the test flying of the Saunders-Roe SR.A/1 and Princess flying boats. Early life and RAF career Geoffrey Arthur Virley Tyson was born in Purley on 4 February 1907. As a school boy during the First World War, he watched the RFC flying at Croydon Airport. He was educated at Whitgift School and on leaving was articled to an estate agent in Croydon. However, after 18 months in 1925, he resigned and joined the Royal Air Force on a short service commission. He underwent his ab-initio flying training at the No. 5 Flying Training School RAF and, after qualifying in February 1927, was posted to No. 25 Squadron at Hawkinge, flying Gloster Grebes. During this tour, he damaged a Grebe while attempting to land off a stall turn. For this incident he was reprimanded by the commanding officer, Robert Brooke-Popham and confined to base for a month. Showing promise as a plot he was posted to the Central Flying School on the instructors course, obtaining the A1 category. In 1927 he was promoted to flying officer and in December was posted to No. 32 Squadron, flying the Armstrong Whitworth Siskin. While flying at 500 ft in a two-seater Siskin, the aircraft burst into flames. He made a rapid landing with himself and the student pilot jumping out while the aircraft was still moving. In 1929 he was an instructor with the Oxford University Air Squadron (O.U.A.S). Barnstormer In 1931, on the expiry of his commission he went on the reserve; living a spartan life working as a flying club instructor, first with the Maidstone School of Flying at West Malling, then with the Scarborough Aero Club and later with the South Downs Aero Club Still on the reserve, he was promoted to flight lieutenant in 1932 In 1933 he was invited to join Sir Alan Cobham's air circus by H.C Johnson, who was Cobham's chief Pilot and Tyson's friend from his O.U.A.S. tour. His first job was taking passengers joy riding in a Fox Moth. On one such flight in July 1933 in Limerick he was involved in a lethal mid-air collision with a Gipsy Moth. Although the undercarriage of his Fox Moth was badly damaged Tyson succeeded in landing the machine and neither he nor his passengers were injured. Both the pilot and the passenger of the Gypsy Moth were killed. When Charles Turner-Hughes left the air-circus in 1934 to work for Armstrong Whitworth, Tyson took over as the circus's aerobatic pilot. He helped develop new stunts such as picking up a handkerchief using a hook on a wing-tip; diving under a line of flags, looping from the dive and ending the loop by diving under the flags again. However, his forte was inverted flying, on the 25th Anniversary of Louis Bleriot crossing the channel, he flew from Dover to Calais inverted in a Tiger Moth. He always finished his performance by a straight, low inverted fly-past. However, on one occasion the pin fastener of his Sutton harness worked out. Falling out of the cockpit, he hung on to the spade grip of his joy-stick, which pulled the elevators up, and his aircraft into a downward half loop, throwing him back into the aircraft with his knees on the floor and chin on the stick. He looked out of the cockpit and realised he was flying right-side- up although 10 ft off the ground. Luckily the accidental downward half-loop had taken place over a deep valley, and the extra few feet had provided sufficient clearance. Contemporary reports of Tyson's stunt flying gave praise and criticism in equal measure: In the winter months he worked for Cobham in other capacities. He flew the tanker aircraft in some of the earliest successful flight-refuelling experiments and made a demonstration tour of India with an Airspeed Courier and Envoy. At the end of the 1935 season the Cobham show closed down and Tyson became a test pilot for Avro. In this role he put his aerobatic skills to good use, demonstrating their aircraft to customers such as Finland. Test pilot In 1937, Cobham's company, Flight Refuelling Ltd offered Tyson a position on their flying staff, with a suggestion of a refuelling base managership if trials went well. Tyson left Avros and went back to refuelling. Again, his precision aerobatic flying stood him in good-stead, because at that time contact with the tanker was made by catching a trailing weight in a hook on the wing-tip. Any error meant that either the trailing rope got caught in the airscrew or the weight swung back and struck the underside of the wing. During Cobham's pioneering transatlantic crossings using in-flight refuelling in August 1939, Tyson flew the H.P. Harrow tanker that refuelled the Short Empire flying boats, Caribou and Cabot. He also made significant contributions to the design of the refuelling equipment and was named in the Cobham's patent. Tyson's work with Flight Refuelling Ltd continued into 1940 until Caribou and Cabot were lost off the cost of Norway. After this happened, he joined Short Brothers working as assistant test pilot to John Lankester Parker. For the remainder of the Second World War he carried out development flying and production-testing of Sunderlands and Stirlings. To understand how the Stirling behaved operationally, he flew with W/C Gilmour, D.S.O., D.F.C., on a raid over Kassel. In December 1944 he flew as co pilot with John Lankester Parker, on the maiden flight of the Short Shetland flying boat. When Parker retired from active test flying, Tyson was appointed Chief Test Pilot in his place. In this role he carried out the flight development testing of the prototype Sturgeon. In 1946,Shorts announced their relocation from Rochester to Belfast; Tyson moved to Saunders-Roe as chief test pilot. On 16 July 1947 he made the maiden flight of the Saunders-Roe SR.A/1 twin-jet fighter flying-boat and was responsible for much of its demonstration and test flying over the following four years. Reminiscent of his barnstorming days, he flew it inverted at the 1948 Farnborough air show. This display was described in Flight Magazine as \\"One of the most dramatic pieces of demonstration flying ever witnessed in this country\\". On 12 August 1949 Tyson was in attendance when Eric Brown flew the SR.A/1. During Brown's landing the SRA/1 struck a submerged log and sank. Tyson leapt from the launch, into the water and kept Brown afloat until he could be rescued. During the late 1940s Saunders-Roe was developing the Princess trans-Atlantic flying boat. In 1951 Princess Air Transport Co Ltd was formed to tender for their operation and Tyson was appointed as one of the directors.Princess Air Transport Company's other directors were M. D. N. Wyatt (chairman), Sir Archibald Philip Hope, 17th Baronet, Mr. P. D.Irons, and Capt. H. W. C. Alger On 22 August 1952, Tyson made the maiden flight of the Princess prototype, G-ALUN. This flight lasted for 35 minutes, in which Tyson flew a complete circumnavigation of the Isle of Wight. According to author Phillip Kaplan, the Princess had not been intended to fly that day;only taxiing tests had been scheduled. However, Tyson had decided to take off due to the excellent weather conditions. He later quipped \\"Well, she simply wanted to fly, so I let her!\\" Tyson put G-ALUN quickly through several test flights with the aim of allowing the flying boat to appear at the 1952 Farnborough Airshow, which he just managed after a total of seven hours flight time. There he made a low run at 280‚Äì300 m.p.h., past the stands, culminating in an almost vertical bank. Later it was revealed that the princess was flying so fast that a problem with the powered flight control system had almost prevented him rolling back upright. He also flew it at the 1953 Farnborough airshow making low runs that \\"made up for any dull moments experienced earlier in the programme\\". Flight testing continued until 27 May 1954 when G-ALUN made its final flight. In 1955 Tyson was awarded the on R. P. Alston Memorial Prize in recognition of his contributions to the flight testing of marine aircraft and in 1956 was awarded the OBE in the 1956 new years honours¬∑ In January that year he stepped down as chief test pilot, handing the role over to John Stanley Booth.

K-92's western terminus is at K-4 south of the community of Rock Creek, and the western terminus is a continuation as Missouri State Route 92 at the Missouri border by the City of Leavenworth. K-92 is co-designated as U.S. Route 59 (US-59) in Oskaloosa, K-16 from Oskaloosa to McLouth, and K-7 and US-73 in Leavenworth. When K-92 was first designated in 1927, it started south of Rock Creek and ended at the Missouri border. Route description The Kansas Department of Transportation (KDOT) tracks the traffic levels on its highways, and in 2017, they determined that on average the traffic varied from 1560 vehicles per day slightly west of Leavenworth, 12700 vehicles per day along the overlap with US-73 and K-7, to 12800 vehicles per day slightly west of the Missouri border. The only section of K-92 included in the National Highway System is its overlap with US-73 and K-7. The National Highway System is a system of highways important to the nation's defense, economy, and mobility. K-92 also connects to the National Highway System at its western terminus, K-4. All but of K-92's alignment is maintained by KDOT. Leavenworth maintains the highway from west of US-73 and K-7 to the eastern end of the overlap with US-73 and K-7. History Early roads Before state highways were numbered in Kansas there were auto trails, which were an informal network of marked routes that existed in the United States and Canada in the early part of the 20th century. K-92's western terminus (K-4) was part of the South West Trail. The section of the highway that overlaps K-7 and US-73 closely follows or was part of the George Washington National Highway and King of Trails. The section of K-92 that overlaps with US-59 was part of the Corn Belt Route and South West Trail. Establishment and realignments K-92 was first designated as a state highway in 1927, extending from US-73W eastward to the Missouri border. By 1932, it was extended further west to end at K-4 south of Rock Creek. Also by 1932, K-24 was extended from Valley Falls along K-4 to US-73W, then south along US-73W to K-92, then east along K-92. K-24 then left K-92 and went southward and ended in Tonganoxie. Sometime between April 1933 and April 1936, US-73W was renumbered to US-59 and US-73E was renumbered to US-73. Also at this time K-24 was renumbered to K-16 due to US-24 being extended into Kansas. In a January 28, 1941 resolution, K-92 was realigned by Ozawkie to eliminate two turns and to fix some sharp curves. K-16, K-92 and US-59 originally followed Cherokee Street in Rock Creek. Then in a November 18, 1953 resolution, K-16, K-92 and US-59 was realigned slightly east onto Walnut Street. In a March 24, 1954 resolution, K-92 was realigned slightly south in Leavenworth to cross the new bridge crossing the river. By 1966 the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers had begun building Perry Lake. Then in a November 9, 1966 resolution, a roughly section of K-92 was realigned to make room for the new reservoir.

It rises northwards from the Perth Road, with terraces in its upper sections. It views over the Firth of Tay to the Tay Rail Bridge and Fife. The Western Cemetery is maintained and managed by Dundee City Council. Background The Cemeteries Act (Scotland) 1840 had permitted private companies to create burial grounds, unconnected to the historic church parish burial grounds or traditional burial grounds such as The Howff. This provided a religiously neutral burial ground (at a price) in a controlled environment, usually some distance from the town centres. Dundee had planned a new cemetery north of the Howff Burial Ground based on a curvilinear layout as already executed in burial grounds such as Dean Cemetery in Edinburgh (1842). However, such curvilinear layouts, whilst visually more attractive, were far more difficult both to manage and maintain, and to track graves once more than a few dozen were created. A rectilinear layout was therefore chosen, based on more organised layouts such as found in Grange Cemetery in south Edinburgh (1847). The site chosen was Blackness House and Blackhouse Nurseries, to the west of Dundee, thereby gaining the name Western Cemetery. It had the huge advantage of already being laid out with paths and an established landscape, due to its previous nursery use. Unlike most traditional graveyards, the site was far from flat. However, as a nursery, soil depths were good, and the ground was well-drained. The southern aspect also created a sunnier position than normal and views from almost all parts of the cemetery (especially the upper sections). The terraces within the cemetery predate its conversion to cemetery use and belong to Blackness House. Designed by James Findlater in 1852 (mainly the entrance gates) the cemetery did not fully open until around 1858. From around 1860 the cemetery quickly became popular, especially amongst the wealthier families. Lightning destroyed the dome on top of the eastern gatepost in 1953 and this has never been repaired. The site changed from private control to Council control in 1979. In 2014 the Council created a new section in the centre of the western wall for interment of ashes. A new northern terrace was created in 2014 as an area for private burials. Local names include Nucator, Mealmaker, Easson, Fyffe, Soutar, McMaster and Keiller.

VI, Ch. 3) was an Act of the Parliament of the United Kingdom that conferred independence on Burma, today called Myanmar. The Act received the royal assent on 10 December 1947. The Union of Burma came into being on 4 January 1948 as an independent republic outside the Commonwealth. Provisions The Act's most important provisions were:- * that Burma would become an independent country on 4 January 1948. * that the suzerainty of the British King over the part of Burma at the time known as the Karenni States would end on 4 January 1948. * that, generally, British subjects whose status as British subjects was due to a connection to Burma, would cease to be regarded as British subjects on 4 January 1948. Parliamentary debate Prime Minister Clement Attlee introduced the Bill in Parliament for its second reading.HC Deb 5 November 1947 vol 443 cc1836-9611836 He explained that its purpose was to give effect to the will of the peoples of Burma as expressed by their elected representatives that their country should become an independent State, should cease to be part of the British Commonwealth of Nations and should no longer form part of the King's Dominions. He explained that in the future, the relationship between Burma and the United Kingdom would be based on a Treaty and on friendship. He expressed his government's regret that Burma had chosen not to become a British Dominion and instead would leave the Commonwealth.HC Deb 5 November 1947 vol 443 cc1836-9611836 He explained that the United Kingdom government had a duty to see to it that \\"minorities for whom we had a special responsibility were given due position under the new Constitution‚Äù and reported that he was satisfied that that was the case.HC Deb 5 November 1947 vol 443 cc1836-9611836 The Prime Minister also provided Parliament with an overview of the historic relationship between the United Kingdom and Burma. He reported that the earliest connections with Burma derive from the activities of the East India Company, that Burma at that time was a kingdom, and that the whole country was annexed by the United Kingdom in 1886. Effective British rule over the whole of Burma has lasted just over 60 years.HC Deb 5 November 1947 vol 443 cc1836-9611836 He reported too that in May, 1945, a statement of United Kingdom government policy concerning Burma was issued. It envisaged the drawing up of a constitution by representatives of the Burmese people with a view to full self-government. The formation of a Burmese government under Aung San followed with elections to a Constituent Assembly in which the party of Aung San won a majority. A series of meetings between UK and the Burmese leaders followed too. The Prime Minister reported that one of the most difficult problems in framing any constitution for Burma was the position of the tribes of the hill country, the Chins, the Kachins, the Shans of the Shan States, and the minority community of the Karens, these peoples having been administered under separate administration until they were brought under Burmese administration under the Government of Burma Act 1935. He concluded his remarks by remarking that he believed the future of Burma \\"should be bright\\".HC Deb 5 November 1947 vol 443 cc1836-9611836 The Leader of the Opposition, Winston Churchill delivered a scathing attack on the United Kingdom government's handling of the question of Burma. He regretted that the legislation would amount to \\"sweeping away our position\\" in Burma. He pointed out that the aim outlined in the United Kingdom government White Paper of May, 1945 was for Burma to attain Dominion status, subject to its prior attainment of certain political milestones. He believed there would have been no difficulty in carrying out that programme in an orderly and careful manner. Instead, he said \\"the whole business has been conducted by the British Government from weakness and not from strength\\". He argued that British Dominion status was an indispensable stage in any policy which ought to have been pursued. He deplored that the legislation would \\"cut Burma out of the Empire altogether, and ... make her a foreign Power\\". Churhchill said \\"the British Empire seems to be running off almost as fast as the American Loan\\". He deplored the \\"extraordinary haste\\". Churchill criticised the character of Burmese leaders calling Aung San a \\"traitor rebel leader\\" for having gone over to the Japanese during the recent War. He criticized U Saw, who had been interned during the War, in similar terms. He dryly criticised the Government for putting the future of Burma in the hands of such \\"outstanding authorities\\". Churchill also said there were \\"grave doubts that the assent of the frontier tribes has been honestly and genuinely given\\" to the new constitutional arrangements.HC Deb 5 November 1947 vol 443 cc1836-9611836 The Bill which would become the Act was approved on 5 November 1947 by a vote of 288 in favour with 114 against.

Encompassing and around fifty stores and restaurants, the center is known for its distinctive mid-century design. It is also known for its community-based atmosphere and appeal. It exists as a rectangular series of low-profile, single-story structures with roofs that protrude to give shelter walkways, with a large open courtyard in the middle. At one end is a two-level anchor store that has housed Bamberger's, Epstein's, and McCaffrey's Food Markets in turn. It has a large surrounding parking area, as well as a bus stop that is serviced by both New Jersey Transit and Suburban Transit. The center has long featured a weekly concert series held in its courtyard during summers. As Princeton's Town Topics newspaper has noted, the relaxed atmosphere but still well-populated nature of the center has attracted people to it: \\"the Shopping Center is a proven anomaly ... the open-air, California-style facility, unlike most malls and front-lot strip malls, is being celebrated in a time when suburban developmental stylings are perhaps not necessarily in style.\\" History The center was built in the Princeton Township portion of the Princeton area (in the era when it was a distinct entity, before merging with Borough of Princeton in 2013). The developer was Theodore Potts, who in 1950 obtained township planning approval for the project. The project overall encompassed , with going to an adjacent recreational area, now known as Grover Park. Construction of the anchor store, then known under the name L. Bamberger & Co., began in May 1951. At that point Bamberger only had stores in Newark and Morristown; another in Plainfield was also in development at that point. When it opened on September 9, 1954, Bamberger's occupied two stories and 60,000 square feet, significantly smaller than other Bamberger's locations. As a result, it only carried a portion of the lines that the larger stores had, such as the flagship location in Newark; among the lines missing were furniture, glass, and silver. Nevertheless, Bamberger's officials always liked the store and kept it going. The Bamberger's there finally closed in 1980, in part because a large Bamberger's had opened as an anchor store at Quaker Bridge Mall, only five miles away, in 1976. It was replaced in the Princeton Shopping Center later that year by Epstein's, a New Jersey family department store chain whose generally smaller size and orientation towards personalized service was a better fit for the center. Epstein's also had the belief that it was better to be a bigger store in a smallish center, as opposed to being a run-of-the-mill store in a large mall. Epstein's moved out in 1990, relocating to the Princeton MarketFair. It was replaced in 1992 on the first floor of the anchor building by McCaffrey's Food Markets, a regional chain of supermarkets in southeastern Pennsylvania and west-central New Jersey. McCaffrey's became what one writer termed the \\"go-to supermarket\\" in the immediate area. The second floor of the building has a McCaffrey's eating area and also the locations of a yoga facility, a ballet school for youngsters, and other offices. For many years the center was owned by George Comfort & Sons, a New York-based company. The center underwent a renovation in 2007, under the supervision of Rosen Johnson Architects. The redoing of the center involved the digging up and replacing many of the courtyard's trees and gardens, to the consternation of some longtime shoppers. In 2012, the center was sold to Edens, a South Carolina-based company, which pledged to keep up the community atmosphere which had made the center a success.Gallery Princeton Shopping Center courtyard looking south concert.jpg|A summer concert in the courtyard of the center Princeton Shopping Center north entrance.JPG|Street entrance to the center; the two-story anchor building is seen on the left Princeton Shopping Center courtyard looking north.JPG|The inner courtyard of the center and its covered walkways References External links * Official website Category:Shopping malls in New Jersey Category:Buildings and structures in Princeton, New Jersey Category:Shopping malls established in 1954 Category:1954 establishments in New Jersey ","title":"Princeton Shopping Center"},{"id":"60191225","text":"Kurt ƒ∞smail Hakkƒ± Pasha (1818 ‚Äì 1897) was an Ottoman field marshal, who participated in the Russo-Turkish War of 1877‚Äì78.

Because of his nature, as a young man he was given the nickname \\"Willie Haggart\\", a patois corruption of \\"hog- heart\\".  Early life  William 'Willie Haggart' Moore was the third child born to his parents. He attended Jones Town Primary. As a teenager, he was a member of Anthony 'General Starsky' Tingle's Wild Bunch crew, before linking up overseas, after his mentor General Starsky was brutally murdered in Jamaica sometime in 1981. Marriage and family Willie Haggart and his wife Little Miss Haggart moved back to Jamaica in 1993. On December 18, he married his then common law wife Angela 'Likkle Miss' Moore. The union produced two children, Siobhan and Andrea. Haggart died acknowledging 18 kids, six of whom were males: \\"Red Man\\", Steve, Ryan, \\"Little Willie\\", and twins Khorian and Kharian. However, since his death others have come forward claiming that he is their father, potentially raising the figure to over 20 children. Death On the afternoon of April 18 2001, Haggart was sitting and talking with two friends from the Black Roses Crew, Ned \\"Big Bunny\\" Hinds and Albert \\"Blacka Douche\\" Bonner, on a Kingston street. A Toyota Corolla pulled up and three men got out, who immediately opened fire. Hinds and Bonner died instantly, while Haggart died on the way to the hospital. His funeral was very controversial as several members of then Prime Minister P.J. Patterson's government were among the estimated 5,000 who showed up at the National Arena to pay their last respects to the community leader. Among these were Finance Minister and Member of Parliament for South St. Andrew Omar Davies, Minister of Water and Housing Karl Blythe and then Minister of Transport and Works Peter Phillips. Paul Burke, then chairman of the People's National Party Region Three also attended, as did East Kingston businessman Danhai Williams, Kenneth 'Skeng Don' Black of Clarendon / Mandeville who arrived in a motorcade consisting of several bulletproof cars with motorcycle outriders and Grammy winning deejay, Moses 'Beenie Man' Davis . Brushes with the Law Haggart was convicted on November 11, 1980 in the Half-Way Tree Court for unlawful possession and fined $50. Police records show that on November 30, 1993 he was convicted for possession of marijuana and was fined $100 or 30 days and in 1995 he was charged with robbery with aggravation, but the case was later dismissed.https://newspaperarchive.com/kingston-gleaner-may-08-2001-p-2/ Black Roses Crew Around the early 1990s, Haggart was invited by Bogle to join his entertainment/party crew Roses which made him popular within the dancehall community worldwide.

Karta was the mother of celebrity orangutan Karen, her one surviving offspring who was handraised by zookeepers and who in 1994 became the first orangutan to undergo open heart surgery. Unable to thrive under Karta's care, Karen was removed and Karta was transferred to Adelaide Zoo, where after a number of baby losses, she was taught baby care and trained to nurse. Karta made headlines in 2009 when she short circuited the electric fence around her enclosure and made a brief escape. In the same year, she was the face of a national campaign for the conservation of orangutan habitats. She died during the birth of her stillborn baby in January 2017, following which funds were raised to erect Camp Karta in her name at Bukit Tigapuluh National Park in central Sumatra.  Early life  Karta was born on 22 July 1982 to Jane and Otis at San Diego Zoo, where she spent her first 10 years. Her mother raised her and her younger brother Nias (born 1988), until they were both transferred to another zoo, leaving Karta at San Diego.  Karen  In 1992, following failed contraception, Karta had an unplanned pregnancy with Otis and on 11 June 1992, she gave birth to Karen. The zookeepers observed that Karen was not being nursed in the first few days of life and she was therefore removed from Karta. On reintroducing her back to Karta, feeding did not recommence and Karen was removed again to be handraised. Following the discovery of a large hole in the heart, Karen became the first orangutan to have open heart surgery, becoming a celebrity overnight.  Infant losses  Over the course of the next 15 years, Karta experienced a number of infant losses. *August 1995; Karta gave birth to a healthy baby but the baby died at four days old. It took two days for the zookeepers to separate her from the baby. Although a head injury was found, it was not the cause of death. *April 1997; Karta delivered a baby at night but it was found dead in the morning. *May 2003; Karta gave birth to a live baby who died the next day. It took three days to remove the baby from Karta, following which a postmortem was inconclusive. *May 2011; Karta gave birth to a live baby who was found dead at day four. The postmortem revealed an empty stomach. *2014; Another stillbirth. Karta's caring skills as a mother were adequate. She had already been trained in mothering skills using a toy orangutan. It took a number of years and four infant losses to realise that it was breastfeeding that was the problem. Her small nipples caused an inability to nurse the infant and the infant failed to thrive. Extra monitoring and teaching of infant care were put into place on the discovery of an unplanned pregnancy in 2016. In 1997, Karta was sent to Perth to learn mothering skills. Her bad behaviour however, resulted in her being returned to Adelaide. In 2003, she was noted to have a good interaction with a pair of siamangs. Mates In February 2006 Karta and her mate Pusung were transferred to the new orangutan facility at Adelaide Zoo. In 2009, Pusung died at the age of 31 from a chest infection. In June 2007, Karta was introduced to 12 year old Kluet and within six months they had formed a strong bond. National campaign In May 2009, efforts to discourage people from buying palm oil products because its production involved destroying orangutan habitats were revealed in an advertisement in New Scientist. At the same time, Karta's image was used in the national campaign which encouraged the Australian government to introduce strict food labelling of products containing palm oil. Escape attempts Also in May 2009, Karta made a brief escape from her enclosure at the Zoo by twisting a stick around the electrified wires and short-circuiting the fence around her. A Zoo spokesman said: \\"She climbed over those disabled hot wires, built up a mound of leaf litter and then used a branch to climb out of the exhibit and on to the surrounding wall of the exhibit.\\" She had tried the same thing before but only to get food. She was outside her enclosure for about 30 minutes before returning peacefully. Zoo officials speculated that she may have been looking for her recently deceased mate, Pusung.  Death and legacy  Karta died from heavy blood loss after giving birth to a still born baby in January 2017. The unborn baby had aspirated meconium. Subsequently the zoo received more than 2,500 expressions of condolence. Funds were raised by the Zoo to build a guard post to defend wild orangutans, Camp Karta in Bukit Tigapuluh National Park, in central Sumatra.

Early life Statfield Saye House Pitt was the eldest son of George Pitt of Strathfield Saye and his wife Jane Savage, eldest daughter of John Savage, 2nd Earl Rivers MP. He matriculated at Wadham College, Oxford on 26 March 1680, aged 16. He married by licence dated 14 March 1691, Lucy Lowe, widow of Laurence Lowe of Shaftesbury and daughter of Thomas Pile of Baverstock, Wiltshire. and Shroton, Dorset and the marriage led to the acquisition for his son of the reversion to the Dorset estates of Thomas Freke. He succeeded his father in 1694 and inherited landed wealth, estimated at between ¬£10,000 and ¬£12,000 a year, including Strathfieldsaye, the estates of Wareham priory, with the advowsons of three of the town's churches, which gave a strong electoral influence there, and valuable collieries in north Durham, which his father had acquired in 1686. In 1692, Pitt was involved in a tavern quarrel, in which, ‚Äòo‚Äôercome with wine and loyalty‚Äô, he killed one John Hoyle of the Inner Temple, a controversial figure described by one contemporary as ‚Äòan atheist, a sodomite . . . and a blasphemer‚Äô. The young Pitt had been offended by his ‚Äòscurrilous‚Äô references to the monarchy. Pitt fled the scene but was soon arrested, and was convicted of manslaughter later in the year. Although he obtained an almost immediate pardon, there remained the chance of a retrial as late as 1696. Pitt was slow in making his presence felt in the Commons, and avoided facing electoral contests, which may be as a consequence of this episode. Pitt's wife died on 17 November 1697 and he made a second marriage by 1700, to Lora Grey, daughter of Audley Grey of Kingston Marwood, in Stinsford, Dorset, who brought him even more property in Dorset. For many years he was closely associated with his kinsman, Governor Thomas Pitt, who entrusted him with ‚Äòpaternal authority‚Äô over his children in 1706 and with the custody of the famous Pitt diamond in 1710. Political career Pitt was returned as Member of Parliament for Stockbridge at a by-election on 23 November 1694. He canvassed at Wareham at the 1695 general election, but may not have gone to a poll. He reached an agreement with Thomas Erle the other patron at Wareham, not to oppose each other's interest, and in 1698 he was elected MP for Wareham. He was classed as a supporter of the Country. He was returned again at Wareham in the two general elections of 1701, and was listed with the Tories by Robert Harley. On 26 February 1702 he voted for the motion vindicating the Commons‚Äô proceedings over the impeachments of the ousted Whig ministers. In 1702 he becam Freeman of Portsmouth and became Tory MP for Hampshire at the 1702 English general election, when he was also returned at Wareham. From this Parliament onwards the name ‚ÄòMr Pitt‚Äô occurs frequently in the parliamentary record, but there were by this time several members of the Pitt family in Parliament and attributions are speculative. At the 1705 English general election he avoided a contest at Hampshire and was returned at Wareham, where he replaced a Whig, Sir Edward Ernle. He voted against the Court candidate in the division on the Speaker on 25 October 1705, in favour of the Tory candidate, William Bromley, who had previously piloted through a private bill concerning his son's inheritance. He was returned again as MP for Wareham at the 1708, and voted against Dr Sacheverell‚Äôs impeachment in 1710. Pitt became a Freeman of Southampton in 1710 and at the 1710 British general election, he felt confident to stand for Hampshire again, and was returned as Tory MP at the top of the poll, keeping his seat at Wareham as insurance. On 25 November 1710, he seconded the motion nominating his friend William Bromley as Speaker. In December 1710, he moved for the appropriation of the entire yield of the land tax to the support of the navy, but the idea was rejected by the Court interest combined with the Whigs. Pitt was listed as one of the ‚Äòworthy patriots‚Äô who exposed the mismanagements of the previous ministry, and was a member of the October Club. In December 1711 he did not join ‚ÄòGovernor‚Äô Pitt in voting with the Whigs in the crisis over the peace. He was involved in the establishment of the South Sea Company, becoming a director of the Company from 1711 to 1718 and a Commissioner for taking subscriptions to the Company in 1711. By the following April he was a leader of the March Club, being in the chair at an early meeting of the club. With the rest of the family, he opposed the French commerce bill on 18 June 1713. At the 1713 British general election he withdrew again to Wareham where he was returned. He voted on 18 March 1714 against the expulsion of Richard Steele. He was classed as a ‚Äòwhimsical Whig‚Äô in this Parliament. At the 1715 British general election, Pitt was returned for Wareham and Hampshire and chose to sit for Hampshire, leaving Wareham for his son George. As a Tory, he voted against the Administration in all recorded divisions, and refused to sign the loyal association in December 1715. By 1716 he was a Commissioner for building 50 new churches. In 1722, he was returned by Robert Pitt for Old Sarum at a by- election on 30 May 1726 and did not stand again at the 1727 British general election. Death and legacy Pitt died on 28 February 1735 and was buried at Stinsford in Dorset. He had four sons and five daughters by his second marriage. His son George inherited Strathfieldsaye.

Gr√∏nland spent considerable time in the Mediterranean Sea, where she protected Danish merchant convoys. Gr√∏nland took part in the bombardment of Algiers in 1770 but otherwise did not see any action in battle. It is noted in the Danish Admiralty's papers that she was an unusually seaworthy ship.  Convoys in the Mediterranean Sea  During the first years in service Gr√∏nland spent a significant part of her time in the Mediterranean Sea, where she escorted Danish merchant ships. Denmark-Norway was not part in the seven-years' war (1856‚Äì63) and the merchant fleet was thus threatened by both French and British privateers. Although Denmark-Norway was neutral the French merchant brothers Couturier had persuaded the Danish King Frederik V to provide a navy ship as protection for Danish ships transporting goods from the Levant to Marseille for the brothers. This arrangement ended, however, when the British ship of the line under command of Hugh Palliser, managed to capture a Danish merchant ship Den flyvende Engel. Den flyvende Engel was part of a convoy that Gr√∏nland, under command of Henrik Lorenz Fisker, was escorting. Shrewsbury had 70 cannons against Gr√∏nlands 50, which likely contributed to Fisker's decision not to open fire. Because of the incident, Fisker was replaced by Simon Hoogland in Marseilles and he was later brought for a court-martial when he returned to Denmark. However, he was cleared of all charges.  The Danish Arabia Expedition  left The first voyage to the Mediterranean by Gr√∏nland in 1761 can be said to be the world's first oceaographic expedition, as the ship had on board a group of scientists appointed by Frederik V for an expedition to Arabia. The group consisted of linguist Frederik Christian von Haven, surveyor Carsten Niebuhr, naturalist Peter Forssk√•l, physician Christian Carl Kramer, artist and painter Georg Wilhelm Baurenfeind and assistant Lars Berggren. One of the explicit tasks of the expedition was to study and describe the marine life in the open sea, including finding the cause of mareel, or milky seas. For this purpose the expedition was equipped with nets and scrapers, specifically designed to collect samples fom the open waters and the bottom at great depth. Gr√∏nland brought the expedition as far as Cairo, where the expedition continued over land to explore the Arabian Peninsula (in particular present day Yemen) and the Red Sea. Only one member of the expedition, Carsten Niebuhr, survived and returned to Denmark in 1767, but he brought with him the enormous collections of especially Forssk√•l. His descriptions of animals collected, together with drawings and scetches by Baurenfeind, were post-humorously published as the book Descriptiones Animalium, which stands out as one of the most important contributions to natural history in the 18th century. Many of the specimens collected by Forsk√•l are today among the most valued treasures of the Natural History Museum of Denmark. Also the many detailed maps made by Niebuhr and ethnographical observations and artifacts collected by the expedition still today provides one of the most important sources of information about the life in 18th century Yemen.  Later years  Gr√∏nland mostly served in Danish waters, but after a major overhaul in 1769 she was in 1770 again sent to the Mediterranean in what is known as the Danish‚ÄìAlgerian War. This time under command of commander Count Moltke and in a fleet that also included three other ships of the line, two frigates, two gunboats and two transport ships, in total 3000 seamen and 516 soldiers. The fleet was sent on a mission to resolve a dispute with the Dey of Algiers about the taxes paid by Dano- Norwegian ships for passage. The fleet, under command of Admiral Ulrich Christian Kaas, bombed Algiers from the sea, but was unsuccessful in making a deal with the Dey. Two years later Greenland again returned to Algiers, this time under command of Admiral Hoogland, and negotiated a treaty with the Dey. After return to Copenhagen, Gr√∏nland served as a guard ship and in the last years as part of the moored blocade of Copenhagen, until she was decommissioned in 1791.

It also aims to influence the social sciences and humanities in general to take the perspective of intentional human actors‚Äîpeople who reason and work together to improve their worlds‚Äîin addition to institutions and impersonal social forces.  Origins  A seminal statement is \\"The New Civic Politics: Civic Theory and Practice for the Future\\" (2007) by Harry Boyte, Stephen Elkin, Peter Levine, Jane Mansbridge, Elinor Ostrom, Karol Soltan, and Rogers Smith.Reprinted as The authors write: > We see before us an emerging civic politics, along with an emerging > intellectual community, a field, and a discipline. Its work is to understand > and strengthen civic politics, civic initiatives, civic capacity, civic > society and civic culture. It is emerging in many disciplines and fields of > human endeavor. Elinor Ostrom's whole body of work, for which she won the 2009 Nobel Memorial Prize in Economic Sciences, has been interpreted as an important forerunner of Civic Studies. John Dewey, J√ºrgen Habermas, William James, and Pope Francis are also cited as influences or inspirations. Filippo Sabetti traces Civic Studies back to the practices of \\"governance [that] were worked out in the free cities of Germany and Italy\\" in the Middle Ages.  Uses in scholarly literature  Civic Studies is the explicit focus in an emerging scholarly literature. Alison K. Cohen, J. Ruth Dawley-Carr, Liza Pappas, and Alison Staudinger write that the question \\"What is a good citizen?\\" is fundamental to Civic Studies. This question leads to more specific ones, such as the relationship between citizens and any particular nation-state or regime, and the skills and behavior of \\"a good citizen.\\" They write, \\"Questions like these are not currently central to any particular academic discipline and require innovative interdisciplinary rethinking. The emerging field of civic studies, which is organically developing within several academic and political sectors, offers a particularly promising home. In the 2017 Dewey Lecture for the John Dewey Society, Harry C. Boyte writes that a \\"concept of citizen as co-creator\\" is definitive of \\"our new field of civic studies.\\" Meira Levinson writes that an aim of her book No Citizen Left Behind was \\"to bring together research and practice from ... shockingly distinct literatures, traditions, and knowledge bases. ... In so doing, I am indebted to Peter Levine and Karol Soltan for their work fostering a broader field of ‚Äúcivic studies.‚Äù In her book American Public Education and the Responsibility of its Citizens, Sarah Stitzlein writes: \\"I join the efforts of the emerging field of Civic Studies as I tackle social problems using philosophy and social science to address a larger audience concerned with civic renewal.\\" She also identifies with \\"the spirit of Civic Studies\\" because she seeks to \\"emphasize the agency of ... citizens as they co-create their worlds via schools. From a European perspective, Nora Schr√∂der writes: > The development of Civic Studies as an academic discipline can be regarded > as a political project in two ways: First, it aims at improving societies by > helping the citizens to engage politically. Second, it challenges dominant > scientific principles by its self-understanding as a normative science > engaged in participatory research and active political engagement. Susan Orr and James Johnson see research on workers' self-management as a fruitful contribution to Civic Studies. Joshua Forstenzer argues that Civic Studies continues the tradition of John Dewey's experimentalism. Civic Studies has been applied in STEM fields as well. For example, in sustainability research, it has been cited as the source of the question, \\"What do academics who work in the humanities and social sciences have to offer to food justice, if anything?\\" In a white paper commissioned for a National Science Foundation workshop on Civic Science, Gwen Ottinger & Nicholas Jordan write, \\"Civic studies provides a framework for conceptualizing how scientific inquiry can serve as a democratic practice, and for theorizing about the contributions of scientific practice to democratic culture.\\"  Practical initiatives  The Good Society is \\"A Journal of Civic Studies\\"http://www.psupress.org/Journals/jnls_GS.html Civic Studies is an undergraduate major at Tufts University; an inititiative http://inside.augsburg.edu/ctl/about/civic-studies-initiative/ initiative at Augsburg University; and a focushttps://cehdvision2020.umn.edu/blog/civic- studies-civic-renewal-rethinking-higher-educations-role-society/ of the University of Minnesota's College of Education and Human Development. Several individual scholars describe their work as contributions to Civic Studies, e.g., Cornell University Development Sociologist Scott Peters and Kansas State University civil discourse and deliberation scholar Timothy J. Shaffer. In April 2016, Tufts University \\"announced a $15 million gift from alumnus (A'76) Jonathan Tisch and his wife, Lizzie\\" for Civic Studies. Brian Schaffner is the Newhouse Professor of Civic Studies at Tufts University.

Localisation  The fort is located in the southeast corner of the medina, close to Bab Diwan and Bab Borj Ennar. It is in continuity with the walls and allows a full supervision to all the coastal facade of the medina as well as part of its eastern one.  History  According to historians, Borj Ennar was built at the same time as the foundation of the medina. Originally? Its main role was to monitor the interior of the medina and its surrounding lands, and to notify the rest of the forts that were guarding the maritime border of the country using firecrackers. It is to this role that the monument owes its current name, Borj Ennar meaning \\"Fort of fire\\" in Arabic. During the 18th century, a second fort was attached to the south facade of Borj Ennar. It is Borj Errbat, which got destroyed during the bombings of the Second World War. Currently, Borj Ennar serves as the headquarters of the Association of Safeguard of the Medina of Sfax. Several other associations also organize their events in its main courtyard.  Architecture  Borj Ennar occupies a total area of 600 m2. It is surrounded by four towers, the two to the south are higher (fifteen meters). Its initial architecture was damaged by bombings of the war.

It is native to the northeastern Atlantic Ocean and the Mediterranean Sea where it feeds on colonial ascidians (sea squirts). Description Underside of L. perspicua The shell is not visible externally because it is completely surrounded by the mantle. The shell is thin, smooth and fragile, and consists of two to three whorls with a short spire. The last whorl is 95% of the total height of the shell. The aperture is very wide and somewhat spoon-shaped, being extended slightly to the right. There is no operculum and the shell is up to long. The animal grows to about long by wide and is oval in shape, with a siphonal notch at the front. The dorsal surface of the mantle bears tubercular projections, the margins are thickened and there is a siphon-like extension at the front. The colour is variable, varying from grey to lilac, yellowish, buff or orange, sometimes with black flecks. Distribution and habitat Lamellaria perspicua is native to the northeastern Atlantic Ocean. Its range extends from Iceland and Norway southwards to the Mediterranean Sea and includes the North Sea and the English Channel. Its depth range is from low water at spring tides down to about . It conceals itself under rocks and can be found in areas where compound ascidians grow. Ecology This snail both feeds on ascidians and lays its eggs on them. The colour and texture of the mollusc often closely resemble the surface of the compound ascidian on which it is living, which fact renders the mollusc well-camouflaged. Some individuals have red patches which resemble small colonies of sponge, and others have been observed with the tubercles coloured in such a way as to resemble acorn barnacles. These colourings make it difficult for potential predators to detect the molluscs, and another defensive mechanism is acid-secreting glands in the dorsal epidermis that make the molluscs distasteful to fish. Breeding takes place in spring and summer in this species. The sexes are separate and fertilisation is internal. The female deposits batches of up to 3000 eggs in capsules deposited in holes she has gnawed in the ascidian colony. The larvae hatch after about three weeks and are pelagic, probably drifting with the plankton for quite a long time.

His work includes paintings, murals, animated videos and video installations. McShine has lived in the US and Mexico and founded the community arts programme Art Connect. Early life and education McShine drew obsessively as a child. He grew up working-class in the Trinidadian towns of Tunapuna and Arima and was the ninth of ten children in his family. He said in a magazine interview: ‚ÄúComing up with dignity and focus through challenging conditions in the Caribbean ghetto, the 9th of ten brothers and sisters, has inspired me to delve into the avenues of the human condition and nature. In ..the third world.., where opportunities don‚Äôt come by unless you have courage, spirit and conviction has been an undercover blessing allowing me to draw from my own life experiences and giving me a huge hunger to tell multidimensional stories that inspire.‚Äù He studied graphic communications at the John S Donaldson Technical Institute in Port of Spain and was a commercial graphic artist with two national newspapers and the magazine Caribbean Beat. After being awarded a Reuters News Foundation fellowship to study Information Graphics in the UK, he attended the University of Navarra-Pamplona in Spain. Career Following his studies in Europe, McShine moved to New York and worked as a bartender, becoming disillusioned with commercial art. \\"I really didn‚Äôt want to do commercial art,‚Äù he said in a magazine interview. ‚ÄúI wanted to have an avenue to freely express myself without limits. Becoming a painter was my true drive.‚Äù While in New York he experimented with animation using the software After Effects. Leaving New York, he moved to Mexico where he found inspiration in ‚Äúthe colours, textures and most definitely the diversity of different indigenous tribes. My inspiration really is universal, but Mexico is where I feel alive. Everything here is on a higher vibration. It‚Äôs as if there‚Äôs another dimension unfolding right before our eyes and my work reflects that.‚Äù He lived in Mexico City for eight years and credited that time with the development of his art: ‚ÄúMoving to Mexico made me into what I am. That‚Äôs the place that actually started my career as an artist.‚Äù After leaving Mexico, McShine moved back to the US to live in Miami Earlier McShine took part in group shows at the contemporary art space CCA7 in Trinidad and London Print Studios but his career advanced significantly in the mid-2000s after he moved to Mexico. He expanded his repertoire from graphic art and painting to animation and his work was shown in galleries and on television. He founded Art Connect, a community arts initiative that had its pilot in Trinidad and Tobago in 2009. Art Connect continued with a further installment in Trinidad, and programmes in Liverpool and the Netherlands. The film Art Connect, directed by Miquel Galofre, is about one of the projects in Trinidad. The format of Art Connect in Liverpool included \\"a series of dynamic art workshops; Animation Documentation, Mask Making, Drawing and Graffiti all aimed at improving the health and wellbeing of participants, with a strong emphasis on raising the aspirations of young people.\\" As his reputation spread McShine was invited to exhibit and lecture in the US and Europe at various galleries and institutions which include the Kunsthal Kade in the Netherlands and the Royal College of Art in London. Work McShine's aesthetic blends Trinidadian and Mexican influences with graphics and street art. \\"The main inspirations in my work are derived from investigations of fantasy, anthropology and spiritual narratives. The visual languages that are created from these inspirations result in groups of quasi-magical characters and identities. Drawings, found objects and paper cut-outs become animated films that are sometimes used to inform works on canvas, works on paper, and mixed media. There‚Äôs a coherent interplay between the diverse materials I experiment with that creates the multilayered, physical premise of my work.\\" He said he was intrigued by \\"islands esthetics‚Äù of Trinidad, including ‚Äúold bottle cap designs, crude sing-age typography, and carnival costumes‚Äù. He uses recycled materials in his art.

Yao was the youngest of five sons, born in the village of Gongyi in Zhunan, Miaoli County. He later moved to Taipei. Yao studied law at what became Central Police University and later completed a master's degree in the subject from Meiji University. He served five years as leader of the Kaohsiung City Police Department and four years with the Taipei County Police Department. Between 1995 and 1996, Yao was president of Central Police University. Within the National Police Agency, Yao was deputy director-general prior to his appointment as director-general from his post at Central Police University. His tenure as director-general began on 13 June 1996, as he succeeded . During Yao's leadership of the National Police Agency, the agency attempted unsuccessfully to track . Additionally, several violent crimes occurred, among them the assassinations of Liu Pang-yu and Peng Wan-ru, both in November 1996. Soon after, Yao remarked that he would never allow his daughter to take a taxi alone at night. Following the April 1997 murder of Pai Hsiao-yen, Yao stepped down from the National Police Agency in August. In January 2000, Yao was appointed the inaugural minister of the Coast Guard Administration. In this position, he warned against implementation of the three small links, stating that China's intelligence agents and gangsters might use them to infiltrate Taiwan. Yao drew criticism for missing a meeting of the Legislative Yuan in April 2000, despite the fact that he had applied for leave and had gone to Kinmen to discuss borrowing patrol boats from the Republic of China Armed Forces. After stepping down from the Coast Guard Administration as the Chen Shui-bian presidential administration took office, Yao worked for the National Policy Foundation, a think tank affiliated with the Kuomintang. The party nominated him as a Kaohsiung-based candidate for the Legislative Yuan in 2001, but he was not elected. Instead, Yao took office on 25 October 2001, succeeding on the party list compiled for proportional representation. He was one of three candidates contesting the Kuomintang nomination for the 2002 Kaohsiung mayoral election. The Kuomintang's deliberations with the People First Party took two months, after which was named the Pan-Blue Coalition's joint candidate for Kaohsiung. Days before the election in December 2002, Yao stated that he would support incumbent Frank Hsieh of the Democratic Progressive Party. The declaration resulted in Yao's expulsion from the Kuomintang shortly after the election took place. In March 2003, after Hsieh began his second mayoral term, he appointed Yao deputy mayor. As deputy mayor, Yao led many cultural events. In October 2004, Yao met Kim Young-sam during Kim's fourth visit to Taiwan. During the 2018 local elections, Yao backed the mayoral bids of Hou You-yi in New Taipei, and Han Kuo-yu in Kaohsiung.

Early life  Ma Lou was raised in the Wynters Pen area of Spanish Town by a family of potters. Both her mother and aunts were potters. She learned from her family, having no formal training. She began making pottery at the age of 8. By the age of 13 she was making pottery full-time.  Career  Her production centered around making yabbas, pots with round bottoms that were used for everyday cooking and baking. She made her yabbas in the centuries-old traditional technique, mining and preparing her own clay. Jamaican pottery was a synthetic tradition that combined European and African styles of pottery making, though experts have suggested that Ma Lou's pottery was distinctly more African in style. Jamaican studio potter Cecil Baugh, who learned techniques from the Jamaican women potters making traditional vessels, brought Ma Lou's work to the attention of the art world. She and Cecil Baugh visited the US to demonstrate traditional Jamaican pottery techniques. She became known as \\"the traditional Jamaican potter.\\" Her work produced a steady income until the introduction of aluminium cookware supplanted the use of pottery in everyday cooking. Between 1954 and 1957 she gave up making pots, until she had a vision that inspired her to keep making pots and train her daughters. Her daughter Marlene Roden, called Munchie, carries on her work. She received the Silver Musgrave Medal from the Institute of Jamaica in 1986 and the Order of Distinction from the Government of Jamaica in 1988.

EV - Electric Vehicle These vehicles are propelled by at least one electric motor. Good example is an electric locomotive that is drawing power directly from overhead wire or third rail. \\"Electric vehicle\\" is often cleverly interchanged with \\"Electrified vehicle\\" which doesn't specify what kind of powertrain vehicle actually has. Electric vehicles do not have secondary source for propulsion, such as internal combustion engine that is mechanically linked to wheels. This term doesn't specify whether vehicle relies on external power source or has it on board. Examples: Electric locomotive, Trolleybus  PEV - Plug-in Electric Vehicle Alternative abbreviation: PIV (Plug-in Vehicle). Sometimes also called \\"Plug-in Electrified Vehicle\\". Widely spread vague terms for all vehicles that can be plugged in for recharging and move at least partially with electric propulsion  BEV - Battery Electric Vehicle Alternative abbreviations: EV (Electric Vehicle), AEV (All Electric Vehicle). These vehicles are propelled by at least one electric motor that gets the power from onboard battery. Energy can temporarily be held in a different device (flywheel, supercapacitor). It is generally accepted to drop the word \\"Battery\\" for all vehicles that clearly have it on board. Examples: Electric car (Nissan Leaf, Tesla Model S), Electric Forklift, Segway, Battery Electric Bus, Electric scooter.  HEV - Hybrid Electric Vehicle Alternative abbreviation: FHEV (Full Hybrid Electric Vehicle). These vehicles are propelled by energy generated by internal combustion engine. Energy recuperated during deceleration or downhill driving is stored (usually in a battery - capacitor, flywheel & other methods are available) and used later for either engine assist, auxiliary functions or for propulsion without starting combustion engine for short distances. These vehicles do not have a socket therefore they cannot be recharged from the grid. All energy originates from combustion engine. HEV-s can be driven on electric power for short distances without running combustion engine. Toyota made up a term \\"Self Charging Hybrid\\" which is very misleading. It is actually just a Hybrid Electric Vehicle. It can charge from running combustion engine though doing this will use more fuel than just driving using power from engine directly. Examples: Toyota Prius Hybrid.  MHV - Mild Hybrid Vehicle Alternative abbreviation: MHEV (Mild Hybrid Electric Vehicle), Subtype of HEV. These are similar to Hybrid Electric Vehicles but can't be driven without the help of internal combustion engine. MHV powertrain is usually less complex compared to HEV. Often Combustion Engine is equipped with compact belt driven 48V starter- generator motor that replaces starter and generator and a 48V battery is added. Due to higher voltage, more energy can be recuperated when decelerating or going downhill. Electric motor can start the engine with vehicle in gear making take-off with stalled combustion engine smooth and instantaneous. 48V starter-generator can also be mounted differently and be uncoupled from combustion engine by transmission or clutch. This might allow 48V electric motor move the vehicle without starting combustion engine. In this case 48V equipped vehicle should be counted as Hybrid Electric Vehicle. Examples: Hyundai Tucson 48V Micro-Hybrid Vehicle Confusing insufficiently distinguishable type of powertrain. Internal combustion Engine Vehicle (ICEV) with automatic Start&Stop; function and smart alternator is often called Micro-Hybrid Vehicle. Often Start&Stop; vehicle has beefier starter battery, rugged starter motor and maybe more powerful alternator though it is unspecified by how much. Micro Hybrid powertrain can not use stored power to help combustion engine move the vehicle because it doesn't have an electric motor that is engaged while vehicle is in motion. It has a starter. Like ICEV do. To avoid confusion it is not recommended to use a term that implies word \\"Hybrid\\" on a vehicle that doesn't have secondary source for propulsion. Micro-Hybrid Vehicles should be counted as regular ICEV with auto Start&Stop; function.  PHEV - Plug in Hybrid Electric Vehicle These vehicles are propelled by two or more energy sources. One of them is electrical energy stored in a battery. The second one is combustion engine that either directly or indirectly turns the wheels. These vehicles can be used solely in electric mode and never run combustion engine. They can also run on fossil fuel and never be recharged though in this case they are no better than Hybrid Electric Vehicles. Usually electric range is significantly shorter than fossil fuel based range.  EREV - Extended Range Electric Vehicle Alternative abbreviations: RExEV (Range Extended Electric Vehicle), REEV (Range Extended Electric Vehicle), BEVx. Subtype of BEV. This vehicle is propelled by electric motor which is mostly powered by energy stored in a battery. If battery is depleted a secondary energy source, usually combustion engine driven electric generator, will kick in and provide power for electric motor to continue journey. Vehicle that will handle secondary energy source as the main one shall not be counted as Extended Range EV but rather regular PHEV. Manufacturer has to discourage careless and unjustified use of range extender.https://www.arb.ca.gov/regact/2012/zev2012/zevisor.pdf Vehicle has to be recharged from external source for next commute or be functionally noticeably limited in battery depleted mode: for example, limited performance, extended range shorter than electric range and limited top speed - these shall ensure significantly superior emission reductions compared to PHEVs over lifetime of the vehicle. Widely sold series-production car that fits this classification is BMW i3 with Range Extender. This vehicle is unable to operate normally without recharging the battery after depletion. Range Extender is unable to generate enough power for normal acceleration and also heat up the cabin at the same time. Also generator is not going to last the lifetime of the vehicle as it was not designed to be used all the time. In US, fuel tank was artificially reduced in size to comply with CARB regulations. Vehicles like Chevrolet Volt have generators that can power electric powertrain with no limitations and therefore should not be counted as Extended Range Electric Vehicles. Examples: BMW i3 REx  FFEV - Fossil Fuel Electric Vehicle Proposed general term for a vehicle that is propelled solely on electric motor (one or many) which is directly powered by combustion engine driven generator. Compared to Hybrid Electric and Internal Combustion Engine Vehicles these do not store energy (battery, flywheel, capacitor) nor have mechanical links between combustion engine and wheels. Good example would be diesel-electric locomotive. Fossil Fuel Electric Vehicle powertrain design is preferred in case torque required to get going is excessively large for any gearbox or clutch. Vehicles that can be propelled by energy buffering device (battery, capacitor, flywheel) without running combustion engine or can be directly coupled to combustion engine should be counted as Hybrid Electric Vehicles.  ICEV - Internal Combustion Engine Vehicle These vehicles are propelled solely by internal combustion engine. Almost all vehicles have a starter motor that will crank the engine. Alternator is being fed by starter battery. That battery is recharged by alternator that is turned by engine. Electricity generated is used to recharge starter battery and also run all auxiliary functions like spark plugs, lights, fans. More advanced vehicles might be able to adjust alternator load according to circumstances. For example, allow alternator to run without load while accelerating (drawing all required auxiliary power from the battery) and charging starter battery at accelerated rate when slowing down and braking. This is unfoundedly called micro-hybrid powertrain likely as misleading marketing term. If any electric motor on board is able to apply torque to help the combustion engine that vehicle should be called Mild Hybrid Vehicle. Examples: Regular car, motorcycle, truck  FCEV - Fuel Cell Electric Vehicle Alternative abbreviations: FCHV (Fuel Cell Hybrid Vehicle), FCV (Fuel Cell Vehicle), HFCV (Hydrogen Fuel Cell Vehicle), HFCEV (Hydrogen Fuel Cell Electric Vehicle). This type is actually electric vehicle that is powered by electric energy generated using onboard fuel cell. Fuel cell uses hydrogen stored in hydrogen tanks and oxygen from the air to create water and electricity. Water is discarded but electricity is used for propulsion. Similarly to Hybrid Electric Vehicle, there is a small traction battery. That battery is used to capture energy while slowing down, driving downhill and also energy created by fuel cell in advance. Fuel cells are not instantaneous - there is a significant delay between driver request for acceleration and electricity generation - fuel cell must be blasted with hydrogen gas and fresh air for it to generate electricity. That delay is prevented by keeping some energy readily available in a battery, capacitor or flywheel. These vehicles do not have a socket therefore they cannot be recharged from the grid. All energy originates from fuel cell. Example: Toyota Mirai  PFCV - Plug in Fuel Cell Vehicle Alternative abbreviations: PFCEV (Plug in Fuel Cell Electric Vehicle), PFCHV (Plug in Fuel Cell Hybrid vehicle), PFCHEV (Plug in Fuel Cell Hybrid Electric vehicle), PHFCEV (Plug in Hybrid Fuel Cell Electric Vehicle). This vehicle is very similar to Fuel Cell Electric Vehicle but has a socket and can be recharged from the grid. Battery likely is significantly larger - comparable to Plug in Hybrid Electric Vehicle. This vehicle type can be used solely on electricity charged by plugging in or solely on electricity generated by fuel cell. Example: Mercedes Benz GLC F-CELL Animal Powered Vehicle This vehicle is moved by an animal. Most commonly a horse. Some vehicles were made mainly for people carrying and others mainly for goods. This was the main transportation method before Industrial Revolution. Example: Horse-drawn Vehicle  HPV - Human Powered Vehicle This vehicle is powered by human - usually just one - the driver. There might be a buffering device like battery, capacitor of flywheel for kinetic energy recovery that can apply torque directly or with electric motor. But it can't be recharged without human effort. Examples: bicycle, velotaxi (without socket for recharging)  HEHV - Human-Electric Hybrid Vehicle This vehicle is powered either by human or stored electrical energy. Most likely it has a socket or retractable cable with a plug for battery recharge. Battery can also be removed and charged separately. Vehicle might also have solar panels and might be able to recharge the battery without human effort. If solar installation is able to generate significant portion of energy that vehicle might be considered as Solar-Human Hybrid Vehicle. Example: electric bicycle (must have pedals)  SEV - Solar Electric Vehicle Proposed abbreviation for vehicles that can recharge significant portion of their range with solar energy and do not have hybrid powertrain. The term \\"solar vehicle\\" usually implies that solar energy is used to power all or part of a vehicle's propulsion. Therefore, at least half of useful battery capacity (half of vehicle range) must be recharged without plugging in normal operation scenarios such as during a day. Vehicles that have longer range therefore must capture more solar energy. Vehicle that unable to charge mostly with solar energy can still be called mildly solar powered if they can get at least some of the range from solar energy. Examples: Solar plane, Mars rover.  Mild Solar Electric Vehicle  Term is based on the same logic as Mild Hybrid Vehicle compared to Hybrid Electric Vehicle. Vehicle that can gain meaningful range from solar energy and do not have hybrid powertrain. Vehicles that can not gain noticeable amount of range shall not be counted as Mild Solar Electric Vehicles. This understanding should prevent misleading marketing tactics. As of 2019, there are no mass- market cars that will reach this category. Though progress will be made soon with more efficient solar cells. Example: Sono Sion Mild Solar Hybrid Vehicle Similar as Mild Solar Electric Vehicle, but has hybrid powertrain - therefore an additional propulsion system. Vehicles that charge auxiliary battery and are unable to use that energy for propulsion shall not counted.  CAV - Compressed Air Vehicle Vehicle that is propelled by expansion of compressed atmospheric gas. If vehicle has a secondary energy source for propulsion it should be counted as CAHV - Compressed Air Hybrid Vehicle. Nuclear Powered Vehicle Vehicle with a Nuclear reactor on board that generates energy for vehicle propulsion. Examples: Nuclear submarine, Voyager spacecraft.  ECE Vehicle - External Combustion Engine Vehicle  External Combustion Engine (EC Engine or ECE in short) is a historical engine type. This engine was powerful, but expensive to build. Steam locomotives and steam cars were External Combustion Engine driven Vehicles (or ECEV) are not used nowadays. They have been replaced by Internal Combustion Engine Vehicles (or ICEV).

She came to attention for her tongue-in cheek rap-opus \\"Find a Penny\\" (directed by Jess Paul),which had a small amount of viral success in 2012. As her music progressed she began incorporating hip hop and R&B; influences, which lead to increased popularity, Kitty Crimes won Westword's best \\"Hip Hop (Solo)\\" award in 2017. Her EP, Crimes of the Kitty, Vol. 2, was released in April 2018, which received strong reviews in the Denver Post and 303 Magazine. The album is notable for its eclectic styling and thoughtful beat constructions. In 2018, Crimes garnered attention for her queer identity and feminist themes, being listed as one of \\"14 Colorado LGBTQ Musicians You Should Know\\" by 303 Magazine and by Autostraddle as \\"one of 10 incredible queer and trans artists to get you ready for summer.\\".

Rosales was born in Chicago and grew up in Champaign, IL. She cites her parents as the spark for her interest in the visual arts. She attended Glenville State College in West Virginia. Her first solo show, titled \\"Black Imaginary to Counter Hegemony,\\" was installed at the Simard Bilodeau Contemporary in Los Angeles.  Personal life  Growing up, she was fond of many of the classic Italian Renaissance paintings. Her family adhered to gender norms and she was told that would need to have a man to support her. When she grew up, she married her high school sweetheart and conceived a daughter. After realizing that the relationship wouldn‚Äôt work out, she got a divorce and left with practically nothing in her possession.  Style  Rosales works to reinterpret Renaissance masterworks by replacing Black heroines as the main subject of the painting because she says that ‚Äúreligion and power go hand in hand‚Äù and the colonists had used religion to ‚Äúmanipulate and control.‚Äù She explains the idea that a Eurocentric white male dominated heaven is all what people seen and it is what everyone grows up around to the point that such a high value is placed on them. This view to her made her feel excluded from this Eurocentric dominated art world which helped to inspire her paintings. She said that she hopes to be able to empower people with art, even if it is a small group of individuals and to give women of colour ‚Äúartworks that reflects their beauty that has been ignored for so long.‚Äù  Paintings  One of her many works is The Birth of Oshun, an oil-on-canvas painting, which reimagines Sandro Botticelli‚Äôs work, Birth of Venus, by placing Oshun, the Yoruba goddess of fertility, sensuality, and prosperity, in a sea shell surrounded by black angels, in contrast to Botticelli‚Äôs painting where a White Venus, the goddess of love, beauty, and fertility, is in a sea shell surrounded by white angels. In this painting, Oshun has vitiligo that is made of gold patches that have roots in traditional Nigerian storytelling traditions. The painting is meant to challenge the perceptions of beauty because as she says, ‚Äútraditionally, we see Venus as this beautiful woman with flowing hair. My hair never flowed, so I‚Äôm wondering why this is supposed to be a painting of the most beautiful woman in the world.‚Äù This painting works to show the beauty in imperfection, such as the patches of Vitiligo, a skin condition. She also says that she created this work with her daughter in mind in order to show her daughter that black women, and their natural hair, are beautiful. Another one of Rosales‚Äôs works was The Creation of God, a piece of art that went viral in 2017. This painting is an oil-on-canvas piece that took two months to craft. In this painting, Rosales recreates Michelangelo‚Äôs Creazione di Adamo by displaying both God and Adam as Black women. Some have described The Creation of Adam as having indescribable beauty in showing Jehovah‚Äôs finger and the elegant, naked body of the first man. In contrast, the painting created by Rosales shows God as a black woman and creates the illusion of the heavens as a womb from which she is birthing Adam in an act of strength and empowerment. This piece received much backlash, with critics going as far as calling her work a ‚Äúdisgrace, disgusting and cultural appropriation.‚Äù However, Rosales was trying to demonstrate that ‚Äúwe have been taught that God created ‚Äòman‚Äô in his own image. [But] in fact, we have created God in our own image.‚Äù This is why she called this painting The Creation of God. This image was created to show that White subjects are the standard in classic art while challenging the viewer to consider why that practice is commonly accepted.

The school primarily serves the communities of Wade Hampton and Taylors, South Carolina. The school was opened in the fall of 1960, consolidating former high schools Paris Mountain and Taylors and some students who formerly attended Greenville Senior High School. The original buildings were torn down and the new building campus re-opened in January 2006 on the same site.  Namesake  Wade Hampton High School takes its name from Wade Hampton III who was one of the largest slave owners in the country, and went on to serve in the confederate army and as the governor of South Carolina. He later was elected as a U.S. Senator from the state. His campaign as governor was marked by extensive violence by the Red Shirts, a paramilitary group that served the Democratic Party by disrupting elections and suppressing black and Republican voting in the state. They contributed to the Democrats regaining control of the state government in this period. The name has garnered mild controversy in the community, but so far there is no real push to get the name changed, despite efforts from students and other members of the community. The school was opened in the fall of 1960, a time when it was not uncommon to name schools after confederate generals and other historical figures, that would deter African American attendance at their schools.  Academics  Wade Hampton consistently scores higher than both the national and state averages on tests such as the SAT, ACT, and EOC. The school's campus is also home to The Fine Arts Center of Greenville.

Location and etymology  The fort is located at the northeast corner of the medina, near Bab Charki. It owes its name to Masouda Essamra, a black woman who sheltered the fort and who dedicated her life to the service of the black community of Sfax.  History  According to Mahmoud Megdiche, the fort takes its name from a black woman who lived in Sfax and who dedicated her life to helping the inhabitants of the city and the protection of the fort. It is very difficult to specify the date of its construction, but it appears in the Louis Salvador illustrations of Habsburg-Lorraine in 1789. In addition, the nature of its columns suggests that it was built before the Hafsid dynasty succeeded to the power. Its main role was the surveillance of the north and east facades of the medina. In 1857, and following the orders of the Bey, a brotherhood was created within it with Sheikh El Sellami at its leader.  Architecture  Borj Masouda is an octagonal tower larger than the rest of the towers of the walls. Its height exceeds four meters and each side measures 5.4 meters. It consists of two levels, the lower of which is larger. The second floor has a prayer room divided into two galleries by two columns in the direction of the qibla.

Situated between and the halt was not open to the public and was used by the British army's Territorial Force as a railhead for troops training at the Rougholme Rifle Range at nearby Humphrey Head. Operational history The Furness Railway opened the halt in 1911 at the request of the local Territorial Force unit. Two timber platforms were erected next to the existing level crossing on Wraysholme Lane. The halt was classified as a non-public timetable station and did not feature in the publicly advertised railway timetable. In 1916 Vickers Limited proposed building an airship station on the flat area of Flookburgh south of the railway and adjacent to Morecambe Bay. The railway company were asked to install a siding to serve the new works. Approval was given in November 1916 and by May 1917 a siding and controlling signal box had been built. To house the airship station workers an estate was built at what is now Ravenstown and the line was extended to deliver building materials. The Vickers airship station project was abandoned in late 1917 making the railway's latest works redundant and, after lying out of use for some time, the siding and signalling were removed in August 1922. The end of the First World War reduced the use of the ranges and the halt was last used about 1922. A proposal to re-open the halt was made by Barrow Borough Council in 1937 but nothing came of the proposal although the remains of the platforms were present until 1960. Wraysholme Lane level crossing The level crossing at Wraysholme Lane has been the site of at least two fatal incidents. On 3 August 1906 the body of Furness Railway foreman platelayer James Lewis who lived at the crossing house was found dead on the line. An inquest ruled that he had met an accidental death probably having been hit by a railway engine in the early hours of the morning. On 3 November 2008 Jonathon Crabtree was killed when his car was hit by a train on the crossing - at the time the crossing was ungated of a type known as Automatic Open Crossing Locally monitored (AOCL). As a result of this incident the crossing was converted to a barriered type known as Automatic Open Crossing Locally monitored + Barriers (AOCL+B).

Her paintings, sculptures and installations explore the themes of social injustice and cultural invisibility. She draws on the folk traditions of the Americas, including their rituals, music, dance and art.  Early art 1990-2000  Early on Cort√©s was spotted within the alternative New York art world as it sought art that would include a much broader demographic base and a more inclusive spectrum of styles and ideas. There was an incentive to go beyond the predominantly white, academically inclined gallery system that was firmly entrenched in Manhattan in the 1970s and 80's. One such exhibition titled Bronx Spaces included an early Cort√©s work Wedding Suite, (1996) with its strings of flesh-colored roses and its sacrificial altar of a bed, making a cogent if oddly antiseptic statement about sexual servitude. Vivien Raynor said it could pass as a set design. Holland Cotter again characterized art in the Bronx, as a resilient, clamorous, multifaceted thing, cosmopolitan in outlook but imbued with a spirit of place. His review of the Longwood Arts Project, an arm of the Bronx Council on the Arts and operating in a former public school in the South Bronx, noted that Cortes's labor-intensive sculptures were based on chains stitched from tiny glass beads and were the best in the show. Of one piece, suspended from the ceiling and hung with handmade amulets and charms, he noted its dense but attenuated presence. At Wave Hill in the Bronx, the multipart sculptural installation Altar to Those Forgotten (2000) consisted of a heap of unglazed clay roses along with exaggeratedly long thorns on a table put in front of an abstract painting. The combined images were seen as ascending souls, perhaps spirits of Wave Hill.  Solo exhibitions 2000's  Cortes has been exhibited nationally in galleries and museums including The Bronx Museum of the Arts, Queens Museum, El Museo Del Barrio, MoMA PS1, Socrates Sculpture Park, The Mexi-Arte Museum and The Cleveland Art Museum. Internationally, Cortes has also exhibited in Germany, Hungary, Slovakia, Poland, Japan, Mexico, Colombia, Dominican Republic, Spain and Greece. Revelations (1996) was a survey exhibition at the Neuberger Museum of Art, Purchase, New York . Charm Bracelet (1996), a seminole installation in the show was made of frescos, roses, charms, and glass beads . Four painted images addressed the seemingly unresolvable pattern common to many abusive relationships: a lacerated pelvic area, a bruised mouth, a blood-stained and bruised eye socket, and a nipple contusion. Each was flanked by decorative charms. Dominick Lombardi stated, \\"Clearly, the trinkets are given to make the hurt go away; unfortunately, they come from the same source as the pain\\". OJO II (2017) was exhibited at Art Basil Miami Beach. Meticulously painted and individually cut out are 500 eye portraits. Brown eyes, kind eyes, green eyes, evil eyes, blue eyes, sad eyes, blood shot eyes, even yellow eyes reveal the authenticity of individuals as recorded by Cortes. Cant√© Jondo / Deep Song (2019) an exhibition at Smack Mellon NYC, presents installations that explore the injustice of the predatory gem and mineral excavation industry  Fellowships and grants  Cort√©s is a recipient of fellowships and grants including: 2018 Guggenheim Fellowship; 2018 BRIC Media Arts Fellowship; 2018 Museum of Arts and Design - Artist Studios Residency; 2017 Lower Manhattan Cultural Council - Creative Engagement Grant: 2014 Joan Mitchell Foundation - Painters & Sculptors Grant; and 2013 Puffin Foundation - Project Grant.

Lai was born to an intellectual family in Taipei, where she learned about music, dance, and painting in her childhood. . She graduated from the Department of Art, Chinese Culture University in 1974. During her study at Chinese Culture University, and inspired by Liao Chi-chun, Lai followed Henri Matisse works and Fauvism style. She received an MA degree from Tama Art University, Japan. She participated in several artist exchange programs in the US, France, and Switzerland. Her experiences from learning and living in these countries expanded her horizon and can be seen in her work.  Contemporary Art Studio  Jun T. Lai moved back to Taiwan after the opening of Taipei Fine Arts Museum in 1983. At the same time, Taiwanese artist Lin Show Yu, based in Britain, also returned and held a solo exhibition. The conceptual art and minimal art tendencies exhibited during the show inspired Lai. In 1986, Jun T. Lai, Tsong Pu, and Zhang Yongcun established SOCA Contemporary Art Studio which is located in one of Lai's property in Taipei. The studio was used for art practice and exhibitions. Before the establishment of official organizations such as Ministry of Culture (Taiwan) and National Culture and Arts Foundation (Taiwan), Lai was attempting to make a vital declaration that every artist should be able to hold their exhibition independently without any form of inspection or approval. Simultaneously, she held art courses, participated lively in international art communities, founded SOCA rookie awards, worked on art related education and promotion projects. By the mid to late 1980s, Lai's works were exhibited in major public museums and major art museums in Taiwan, which brought her career to an established level.  Artistic practice  Jun T. Lai, as a part of a group of female artists, uses her work to criticize the social norm which emphasizes the artist's female identity. In 1980s, She focused on materials of sculptures to present the piece and convey ideas. She is known for utilizing geometries to create sculptures.

Doyle describes her as \\"a militant vegan who thinks she is a better poet than William Shakespeare\\". , the character has more than 500,000 followers. Doyle wrote a book, titled Woke: A Guide to Social Justice, under her name, which was published on 7 March 2019. He published his second book under the name, titled My First Little Book of Intersectional Activism, in September 2020. He also created a live comedy show featuring Titania (played by Alice Marshall), which debuted at the Edinburgh Festival Fringe on 13 August 2019.  Character  Titania Gethsemane McGrath is a fictional 24-year-old \\"radical intersectionalist poet committed to feminism, social justice and armed peaceful protest\\" who identifies as non-binary, \\"polyracial\\" and ecosexual. In an interview with The Spectator, the persona revealed that she was raised by parents who \\"lavished\\" her with \\"gifts and money\\" to distract her from her \\"oppression\\". She became woke through the Bible passage of the Cleansing of the Temple, which inspired her to \\"a similar thing\\" at the age of four at her local branch of HSBC. She studied Modern Languages at Oxford University before completing an MA in gender studies, for which she wrote \\"a groundbreaking dissertation on technopaganism and the corrosive nature of cis-masculine futurity\\". On her Twitter account, McGrath promotes extreme identity politics and political correctness, and comments on various topics, notably Brexit, LGBT issues, feminism and American politics. Titania McGrath is named after 300x300px Andrew Doyle, the creator of McGrath, describes her as \\"a militant vegan who thinks she is a better poet than William Shakespeare\\". He revealed to The Daily Telegraph that she is named after Titania, the queen of the fairies from Shakespeare's A Midsummer Night's Dream, as he believes that \\"all of this 'woke culture' is an utter fantasy world\\". He added: \\"The people who promote this hyper inclusive culture are fantasists [...] so [he] think[s] it's quite appropriate that she is named after the queen of the fairies.\\" Commentators at The Conversation and the Irish Independent have compared Doyle's work to the work of several satirists from the 18th century, such as Jonathan Swift's Isaac Bickerstaff, suggesting that McGrath, much like Bickerstaff, was created to criticise those with views the creator disagrees with in a manner which they feel he would be reluctant to state without anonymity.  History  The account's creator, Andrew Doyle, is a comedian, columnist for British internet magazine Spiked and former Oxford University postgraduate student and private school teacher with a doctorate in Early Renaissance Poetry from Wadham College, Oxford. He is also the former co-writer of fictitious news reporter Jonathan Pie. An opinion piece in The Times said that Doyle has often been branded by internet trolls on social media as a \\"typical right-wing, privately educated straight man\\", despite stating that he is a homosexual and supported Jeremy Corbyn during the 2017 United Kingdom general election, wished to mock contemporary \\"woke culture\\", as \\"the majority of people are desperate for this culture to be mocked\\"; he subsequently created an anonymous Twitter account for his fictional character, Titania McGrath, in April 2018. McGrath's Twitter account has been suspended for alleged hate speech four times, notably on 9 December 2018, only for it to gain 20,000 followers after it was reinstated a day later. , her account has more than 500,000 followers. On 7 March 2019, McGrath published her first book, titled Woke: A Guide to Social Justice. A tweet she had posted promoting the book appeared in Private Eyes \\"Pseuds corner\\". The post read: \\"I have written the most important book of 2019. Do not buy it for my sake, but for the sake of humanity.\\" Within a few days of its publication, Woke was among the 100 bestselling books on Amazon, and the number of followers on McGrath's Twitter account rose from 150,000 to 228,000. In March 2019, Doyle was contacted by Rosamund Urwin, a journalist at The Sunday Times, who asked whether he was the person behind McGrath's Twitter account, due to the inclusion of several sources in McGrath's book that he had quoted previously. Though he denied it, he later revealed himself as the man behind the account. Beforehand, Andrew Doyle had claimed that there was speculation that several people, including Chris Morris, Ricky Gervais, Ann Coulter, or even Urwin herself, were behind the account. McGrath's first children's book, My First Little Book of Intersectional Activism, will be published by Little, Brown in September 2020.  Reception  Janice Turner of The Times praised the author in her review of Woke for \\"perfectly captur[ing] the chiding, self-righteous, intolerant, joyless tone of the 'woke'\\", and added that though \\"the politics can be heavy-handed, [...], its satire is a direct hit on the awful state of the left, in all its nihilism, narcissism and illogic, and its self-defeating, petty-minded thought policing. Woke is no joke.\\" Patricia Casey of the Irish Independent hailed McGrath's tweets as \\"outrageous and hilarious\\", leaving her \\"addicted, hooked, devoted\\". The New Criterion praised Doyle's satirical humour, writing that \\"blessed with a pitch perfect ear for absurdity, [he] has revealed the malign hilarity of woke culture\\". Emily Sheffield, writing for the Evening Standard, called McGrath's book \\"hilarious\\", though \\"in book form [...] the parody becomes repetitive\\". However, she added that \\"Virtuousness, virtual or otherwise, is an easy target. Being woke even simpler to satirise.\\" Charles Moore of The Spectator called the character \\"genius\\" and praised her tweets. Shappi Khorsandi, in an article for The Independent, compared McGrath favorably to Millie Tant from the comic magazine Viz and stated that McGrath \\"pricks pomposity and tempers moral certitude with a hint of doubt; in short, she keeps us honest\\". Neil Mackay of The Herald wrote that Titania's book \\"mercilessly satires the Left's online umbrage brigade, the permanently offended, those who have taken on the role of policing thoughts and words to the point of absurdity\\", adding that Titania's targets \\"need [to be] mocked\\" as they \\"make good causes look ridiculous, they alienate when they should be persuading, and they turn liberalism ‚Äì which I hold dear ‚Äì into something stupid\\". Conversely, Alex Clark of The Observer criticised the character, stating that \\"lampooning the language of social justice is a cheap shot\\" and that \\"it doesn't get us much further than the temporary glow of self-praise, and it certainly doesn't get us off the bus to hell\\". Mollie Goodfellow of the New Statesman echoed these views, arguing that McGrath \\"simply isn't that funny\\", and suggested that her target audience are \\"the people who claim 'you can't say anything anymore', even as their opinions are repeated constantly on national TV, in the papers and online\\", and \\"who question whether feminism has 'gone too far' and say 'people will be offended by anything these days', just after saying something offensive\\". A live show called \\"Mxnifesto\\" was performed at the 2019 Edinburgh Festival Fringe, where it received mostly mixed reviews.

Her mother was the principal of Lyc√©e Victor Duruy and her father the principal of Lyc√©e Charlemagne. Deaf and mute from birth, Lavaud was taught by her parents how to follow conversations as a child by lipreading. She graduated with a masters of art in history from the Facult√© d‚ÄôAix-en-Provence at the age of 22. Lavaud was the first to significantly study the work of Marie Len√©ru. Len√©ru, a French writer and dramatist, became deaf and blind after contracting the measles as a child. Lavaud orally defended the thesis for her Doctor of Letters, \\"Marie Len√©ru, sa vie, son journal, son theatre,\\" at the Sorbonne on January 8, 1932. She was assisted by her mother, who repeated questions from the examiners when their movements or enunciation made lipreading a challenge. As a speaker unable to hear her own voice, Lavaud had a unique speaking style that was commented on in news coverage about her defense. Professor F√©lix Gaiffe noted that despite a hoarse and monotonous timber, the defense was delivered with intelligible ease. While coverage in Le Temps said that she spoke clearly with a \\"convincing vivacity\\" and spoke with authority about her area of expertise. Lavaud passed the defense with honorable mention and expressed a desire to work in a library when asked by journalists what she planned to do next. Following graduation, Lavaud worked as a librarian at the Sorbonne. She also served as France's representative with the World Federation of the Deaf. Lavaud was the third deaf woman to become a member of Soci√©t√© des gens de lettres, after Yvonne Pitrois and Louise Asser. She died in Nice on January 14, 1996.

She directed and produced the first known film by a Spanish woman, Flor de Espa√±a o la leyenda de un torero (1921), which has since been lost. She acted in the film alongside her sisters, Ofelia and Ang√©lica, who were collectively referred to as the Hermanas Cortesina.  Early life and career  She began her career as a dancer, performing to songs by Spanish composers, with an aesthetic heavily influenced by Greek art. Cortesina has been identified as one of the models for the 1917 painting Danzarinas griegas, by the painter Joaquin Sorolla y Bastida. She later founded a production company, Cortesina Films, in Madrid in 1921. The direction and screenwriting of Flor de Espa√±a was long attributed to priest and playwright Jos√© Mar√≠a Granada, but this is contradicted by reviews that indicate that Cortesina directed while Granada only edited the script.  Escape to Buenos Aires  In 1936, at the beginning of the Spanish Civil War, Cortesina joined the Alliance of Antifascist Intellectuals for the Defense of Culture. In order to escape fascism, she and her son Juan Manuel Fontanals, one of two children she had with stage designer Manuel Fontanals, escaped to Buenos Aires, Argentina, in 1937. There, she established a theater company with Andr√©s Mejuto that produced a number of Spanish plays. She continued to act in films, including 1945's La dama duende, based on a 17th-century play by Pedro Calder√≥n de la Barca.

Her doctoral dissertation was on paleoethnobotany in Polynesia. She has been a professor at Simon Fraser University (SFU) since 1995. Lepofsky's research centers on the indigenous peoples of the Pacific Northwest Coast and how they interacted with their environment in the past. She significantly revised anthropological thinking on the historical ecology of the Northwest Coast by showing that indigenous communities there have a long history of intensively managing coastal food resources. In particular, she has demonstrated the antiquity of herring fishing and clam gardens in the region, the latter going back at least 3,500 years.

It was founded in the late 1870s to early 1880s by Martha McWhirter and her women's bible study group on land that was inherited when the women's husbands died or quit the home.  Members  Residents of the commune were women and their dependent children; many of the women fled abusive homes to join the community. At one point, there were between 42 and 50 women members on record, including at least one African American woman who is thought to be a former slave.  Ideology  The Sisters embraced first wave feminist ideologies, and sought spiritual, economic, and social equality for women. To that end, they practiced celibacy as a way to liberate women from the spiritual degradation of heterosexual intercourse, the oppressive needs of children and child rearing, and male violence. In the 1880s, the citizens of Belton blamed the Sanctificationists for rising separation and divorce rates, and of undermining the meaning of marriage through their practice of celibacy.  History  The Sanctificationists were economically successful; they ran several boarding houses, two hotels, formed holding companies to manage their properties, and operated two farms to provide food for their multiple dining rooms. They started first public library in Belton, the Woman‚Äôs Wednesday Club Library, out of one of their boarding houses. In 1899, the entire commune moved to Washington, DC where they opened boarding houses, a hotel, and participated in urban feminist organizations. McWhirter died in 1904, and the commune began a slow decline. In 1917, there were six remaining members who purchased a farm in rural Maryland to provide food for their urban dining halls, and to provide a pastoral retreat for themselves in a rural landscape. The last member of the commune died in 1983 at the age of 101.  Impact  The George and Martha McWhirter House at 400 North Pearl St., Belton, Texas, is on the National Register of Historic Places listings in Bell County, Texas. At the address, there is a historical marker dedicated to the Sanctificationists. Jan Berliner Statman considers the Woman's Commonwealth to be one of the first women's shelters in the United States. A brief article published in the lesbian separatist periodical, Austindyke (alternately spelled as Austin Dyke), in 1979 and then reprinted in Sisters United in 1980 described the Woman's Commonwealth as a forerunner of the lesbian land movement.Peticolas, Anne. (1980). \\"Reclaiming hystory: The Belton Sanctificationists.\\" Sisters United 20(6): 13. It is unclear whether the Sanctificationists influenced the movement that flourished in the 1970s and 1980s.

During the American Civil War, he served in the Confederate Army as a colonel. Early life Dawson was born in Charleston, South Carolina, on February 14, 1829. He was the eldest son of Lawrence Edwin Dawson (1799‚Äì1849) and Mary Wilkinson (n√©e Rhodes) Dawson (1808‚Äì1851). His father, a close friend of William Drayton, studied law at the Litchfield Law School in Connecticut and practice in South Carolina, where he served as a member of the state legislature several times. Among his siblings were Reginald Hebner Dawson, a lawyer who fought with the 13th Alabama Regiment of the Confederate States Army; Mary Huger Dawson, who married C. M. Lide; and Lawrence E. Dawson Jr., who was a farmer near Camden, Arkansas. His paternal grandparents were John Dawson, the former mayor of Charleston, and Mary (n√©e Huger) Dawson, herself a daughter of John Huger, who also served as mayor of Charleston. The Dawsons family originated from Westmorland in England and emigrated to the Province of South Carolina around 1750 where his great- grandfather settled in Charleston and became a successful and wealthy merchant. His maternal grandparents were Nathaniel Henry Rhodes and Mary Wilkinson (n√©e Hamilton) Rhodes, the daughter of Paul Hamilton, the former Governor of South Carolina and U.S. Secretary of the Navy during the War of 1812 under James Madison. After his grandfather's death, his grandmother remarried to Richard Bedon Screven. Dawson was also a lineal descendant of Nathaniel Johnson, a former British Member of Parliament who served as the 14th colonial governor of South Carolina. In 1842, his family moved from Charleston to Dallas County, Alabama. Dawson was educated at the local schools before he attended St. Joseph's College in Mobile, Alabama. Career After St. Joseph's, he began the study of law in the office of his father near Selma. After his father's death in 1849, he joined the office of Judge George R. Evans in Cahaba, Alabama, and was admitted to practice in 1851. In 1857, after his second marriage, Dawson moved to Selma, where practiced in partnership with Edmund Pettus (later a U.S. Senator) and C. C. Pegues of Cahaba. In 1855, Dawson was a Democratic candidate for the Alabama legislature, but lost his race by a few votes. In April 1860, he was a delegate to the Democratic National Convention in Charleston, which adjourned in deadlock without choosing candidates for president and vice president, leading the Alabama delegation to withdraw from the convention. He was among the Alabama delegates who reconvened at the Maryland Institute in Baltimore in June 1860 and selected then vice president John C. Breckinridge (for president) and U.S. Senator Joseph Lane (for vice president) in what was referred to as the ‚ÄúBreckinridge Democrats‚Äù convention. U.S. Civil War Upon the secession of Alabama in January 1861, Dawson was chosen as captain of the Selma Cadets and traveled to Virginia as a part of the 4th Alabama Infantry. From 1863 to 1864, and until the end of the war in 1865, he commanded a battalion of cavalry. During the War, he was elected to the lower house of the General Assembly of the Confederate States Congress in 1863 and 1864, serving in the Assembly and then returning to his command at the close of the legislative sessions. Post war career After the war, Dawson resumed his law practice in Selma with Gen. Pettus under the name Pettus & Davis. He took an active part in southern politics and in 1872, he was a presidential elector. In 1876, he was appointed one of the trustees of the Alabama common school system (later the University of Alabama) by Gov. George S. Houston, serving until his death in 1895. He was a member of the Democratic Executive Committee of Alabama for ten years and from 1884 to 1886, he served as chairman of the committee. In 1880, Dawson was elected to the Alabama House of Representatives, and was chosen Speaker of the House from 1880 to 1881. In 1882, he was put forth as a candidate for governor of Alabama during the Democratic state convention, but he was defeated by Gen. Edward A. O'Neal who later won and became the 26th governor of the state. In 1886, Dawson was again put forth for the gubernatorial nomination among three other candidates: Henry Clayton, John McKluat, and Thomas Seay. Although he led in the convention from the start, Seay gained the nomination and was later elected as the 27th governor. In August 1886, President Grover Cleveland appointed Dawson as the 3rd United States Commissioner of Education, succeeding former Union Army general and ordained Presbyterian minister, John Eaton, who served under Presidents Grant, Hayes, Garfield, Arthur, and Cleveland. Dawson had managed Cleveland's Alabama campaign in 1884. In April 1887, Columbia College, conferred upon Dawson the honorary degree of Doctor of Letters in token of his \\"efficient services to the cause of education.\\" After the inauguration of President Benjamin Harrison in March 1889, he offered his resignation, which Harrison accepted months later, serving until September 3, 1889, when he was succeeded by Connecticut educator and philosopher William Torrey Harris. After he left the Education Department, he again returned to the practice of law until August 1892, when he was again elected to the Alabama House, taking his seat in the assembly for the third time as one of the members from Dallas County. Personal life On January 22, 1852, Dawson was married to Anne Eliza Mathews (1833‚Äì1855), a daughter of Joel Early Mathews, the owner of the Mathews cotton mill in Selma. Together, they were the parents of one daughter: * Elizabeth Mathews Dawson (1855‚Äì1902), who married Dr. John Perkins Furniss (1841‚Äì1909). After her death in 1855, he remarried to Mary Elizabeth Tarver (1833‚Äì1860) on June 17, 1857. Together, Nathaniel and Mary were the parents of: * Mary Tarver Dawson (1860‚Äì1939), who married Jefferson Davis Jordan (1853‚Äì1915). After the death of his second wife in 1860, Dawson married for the third time to Elodie Breck Todd (1840‚Äì1877) on May 15, 1862. Elodie was the daughter of Kentucky merchant and politician Robert Smith Todd and his second wife, Elizabeth (n√©e Humphreys) Todd. Elodie was the granddaughter of Gen. Levi Todd and Dr. Alexander Humphreys and grandniece of U.S. Senator John Brown. Among Elodie's large family was her elder half-sister, Mary Todd Lincoln, the wife of U.S. President Abraham Lincoln. Together, they were the parents of: * Nathanial Henry Rhodes Dawson Jr. (1864‚Äì1903), who did not marry and was educated at the University of Alabama. * Lawrence Percy Dawson (1869‚Äì1925), the Sheriff of Dallas County, who married his first cousin, Alice Kellogg (1874‚Äì1913), a daughter of Margaret (n√©e Todd) Kellogg. Elodie, his third wife, died giving birth to a stillborn baby boy in 1877. Dawson died at his home on February 1, 1895, in Selma, Alabama. He was buried at Old Live Oak Cemetery in Selma.

At the Brier, Woytowich led his rink to an 8-3 round robin record, in a tie for first place with Alberta's Kevin Martin rink. By virtue of beating Alberta in the round robin, they earned a direct berth into the final, while Alberta had to play in a semifinal match against British Columbia. Alberta won that semifinal, setting up a re-match against Saskatchewan, which they won 8-4. It would be the first of four Brier wins for Martin. The win was controversial for Martin, as when his was losing in the final, Martin brought out his corn broom, which littered the ice with its chaff. This frustrated the Woytowich rink, causing their rocks to pick, and ultimately to lose the game.Saskatoon Star Phoenix, \\"Senior curlers reflect on 1991 Brier loss\\", 26 Feb 2011 Martin denied using this tactic.The Brier, Bob Weeks, pg 211 The following season, the Woytowich rink had a lot of success on the cashspiel circuit, but could not make it to provincials.

It is believed, but not established for certain, to have been commissioned by Alessandro dal Borro (1600‚Äì56), a Tuscan general, who fought with Mattias de' Medici in the Castro war against Pope Urban VII. Proud of his career and character, presumably dal Borro asked that the painter not shy away from depicting his stout build.Power; Schulkin (2013), p. 22 As such, the work is highly regarded for its amusing geniality. It is noted for being frank and striking, and as one of the earliest honest depictions of obesity.Vigarello (2013), p. 213 The portrait shows the man in full profile, standing next to a stone pillar, looking to his right, with a banner at his feet, bearing a coat of arms thought to be of Barberini family. He has thick red hair, a double chin and round, pudgy cheeks.\\"Charles Mellin ‚Äì Portrait of a Gentleman\\". artatberlin.com. Retrieved 10 March 2019 It has been attributed to a number of artists over the centuries, including Vel√°zquez, Bernini and Andrea Sacchi.Sylvain (1990), pp. 191-201 Today it is generally thought to be the work of Mellin, although there is no definitive evidence, and is in the collection of the Staatliche Museen, in Berlin.

She is interested in optical microscopy and novel imaging techniques, and leads the Mesolens microscope facility where her research investigates linear and non-linear optics.  Early life and education  McConnell credits her high school physics teacher with her inspiration to study science. She studied optoelectronics and laser physics at the University of Strathclyde, where she was taught by Carol Trager-Cowan. She remained there for her graduate studies, earning a PhD in laser technology under the supervision of Allister Ferguson in 2002. She was the first member of her family to go to university. Career and research McConnell almost worked in telecommunications, but was convinced by Ferguson to join Strathclyde's new Centre for Biophotonics. She became interested in biomedical research and increasingly aware of the limitations of commercial imaging. Here she worked with Alison Gurney on the development of confocal, multi-photon wide-field microscopes. Gurney encouraged McConnell to apply for fellowships, and she was a Royal Society of Edinburgh and Research Councils UK (RCUK) postdoctoral fellow. She developed the world's first white light supercontinuum laser that could be used for confocal microscopy, as well as laser scanning fluorescence microscopy. She attended the European Molecular Biology Laboratory (EMBL) Practical Course in Advanced Optical Microscopy in Plymouth, which she has continued to support throughout her academic career. McConnell directs the Centre for Biophotonics and Mesolens laboratory at the University of Strathclyde, working on nonlinear and linear optical instrumentation for biomedical imaging. Nonlinear optics allows physicists precise control of excitation parameters, including the chance to tune the duration of laser pules. In 2009, McConnell began working with William Bradshaw Amos and built a new lens, Mesolens, that can allow 3D imaging with a depth resolution of a few microns for objects up to 6 mm wide and 3 mm thick. The Mesolens is a giant optical microscope objective supported by the Medical Research Council (MRC). It can be used to image large biomedical specimens, including embryos, tumours and areas in brain, as well as scanning large areas of samples in a short amount of time. The lens has 260 megapixal effective camera and a magic ratio of 8:1, which can even resolve individual bacteria. As the photometric volume can sample such a large area with sub-cellular detail, the Mesolens may allow for the imaging of rare events. Mesolens became a University spin-off, but McConnell decided to stay in academia to explore the physics of biomedical processes. The Mesolens generates such large amounts of data that McConnell became interested in computational biology. The Mesolens was selected by Physics World as one of the top achievements of 2016. She discussed the Mesolens on the podcast Not Exactly Rocket Science. Alongside the Mesolens, McConnell has explored how laser sources can be used to open voltage-gated ion channels, such as Calcium-activated potassium channels. She has developed a fast-acquisition version of two-photon excitation microscopy that can be used to image at rates of 100 frames/second. She created polymer hydrogel beads that are responsive to enzymes. She is working with the Medical Research Scotland to create high brightness light-emitting diodes. In May 2012, she was appointed Professor and Director of the Centre for Biophotonics at the University of Strathclyde. She leads the Strathclyde Theme of Physics and Life Sciences and is part of the Engineering and Physical Sciences Research Council (EPSRC) Centre for Doctoral Training in Optical Medical Imaging. Awards and honours In recognition of her work, McConnell was elected a Fellow of the Institute of Physics (FInstP) in 2010, a Fellow of the Royal Society of Edinburgh (FRSE) in 2019 and a Fellow of the Royal Microscopical Society (FRMS).

They were one of four classes, together with the BB 12000, BB 13000 and CC 14100 classes, that formed an experimental group for studying the practicality of the new French electrification. It was used in freight service along the Lille ‚Äì Thionville line. They were nicknamed Fer √† repasser (electric irons). History  25 kV 50 Hz electrification  Around 1950, France began a program of electrification with 25 kV at the 'industrial' frequency of 50 Hz. An experimental program was begun with four similar locomotive designs, one from each maker of electrical equipment, to find the best system. Investigating the electrification of the Lille ‚Äì Thionville line, the CC 14000 were part of an order for 85 electric locomotives in 1952, each using a different system: five BB 12000 in a mono-continuous format with ignitron rectifiers, fifteen BB 13000 with direct motors, twenty four-phase CC 14000 and sixty-five CC 14100 with single phase-continuous rotating units. The project was very successful, with 150 locomotives ordered in 1954 amongst the BB 12000, BB 13000, CC 14000 and CC 14100 series. The various locomotive types were used in experimenting with different ways of transforming current flowing from the traction network through transformers and rectifiers to the traction motors. As a result, the success of this trial led the SNCF to electrify its remaining lines, decided as being both economical and future-friendly. The 14000s used a rather complex electric motor, prone to a multiplicity of various (mostly minor) breakdowns, yet frustratingly difficult enough to repair (one author explaining the breakdowns were suicide-inducing). In 1952 orders for 85 locomotives were placed: five BB 12000, fifteen BB 13000, twenty CC 14000, sixty five CC 14100\\\\.  Design  Like the CC 14100, the CC 14000 used a rotary converter. The extra weight of this equipment, compared to the BB 12000 and BB 13000, required extra axles to reduce individual axle load and so they were of C-C arrangement rather than B-B. The CC 14000 was the design produced by OC Oerlikon. It used three-phase AC traction motors.  Service history  CC 14015 with a northbound mineral train on the Nord main line near Longueau (Somme), 1959 In total, 20 units were built.

His practice responds to critical contemporary cultural, social, and political issues through the use of collaboration and dialogue. Beveridge and long-time collaborator and partner Carole Conde challenge concepts of ideology, power, and control. In their career, which spans over thirty years, Cond√© and Beveridge have had over fifty solo exhibitions at major museums and art spaces across four continents, including: the Institute of Contemporary Arts in London, UK; Museum Folkswang in Germany; the George Meany Centre in Washington; Dazibao Gallery in Montr√©al; Centro Cultural Recoleta in Buenos Aires; the Art Gallery of Edmonton; and the Australian Centre for Photography in Sydney.  Background  In 1969, Cond√© and Beveridge, then working as independent conceptual artists, left Toronto for the burgeoning conceptual art world in New York City, where they found their overtly politicized voice. In 1975, they picketed at the Museum of Modern Art, protesting its lack of inclusion of women artists. The couple returned to Toronto in 1977.  Artistic career  Cond√© and Beveridge have worked on social issues including the working conditions of migrant farm labourers, the histories of auto workers, women in the workplace, projects relating to labour education and labour arts, national and global \\"free trade\\" agreements, police brutality and systemic racism, environmental issues, nuclear power, the decline of the fishing industry, struggles against neoconservative government policies, healthcare issues, anti-globalization protests, and the transnational politics of water. The artists use dialogical aesthetics as a way of breaking down the conventional distinctions between artist, artwork, and audience.  Style  Cond√© and Beveridge utilize actors, staged tableaux, montage, thematic slogans, captions, and the construction of emblematic props and non- naturalistic sets to generate an atmosphere of serious visual expression grounded in theoretical and ethical contexts.

In 2008 Tusa and Folco Quilici made a documentary film on the prehistory of the Mediterranean at Pantelleria. The excavations he promoted, and conducted in the field by Fabrizio Nicoletti and Maurizio Cattani, also confirmed the role of Pantelleria as a \\"crossroads for merchants\\" in ancient times.

She wrote more than 50 scripts during the course of her career, working in the U.S., Britain, and Russia.  Biography  Lucita was born in Buffalo, New York, to George Squier and Lucinda Lilliendahl. Her family had been wealthy thanks to the Mexican railroads they owned, but they lost most of their money during the Mexican Revolution, as she would later recount. She grew up speaking Spanish and vacationing in Mexico, attending school in New York City. At one point, she was the only girl attending the exclusive Horace Mann School. After getting a job as a secretary in Hollywood through her family's connection to Cecil B. DeMille, she began writing scripts for Marshall Neilan's company, where she became lifelong friends with Mary Pickford. At the time, newspapers reported that with the release of her first script, Bits of Life, she was the youngest scenario writer to have a produced film under her belt. After heading back to New York City, she met and married journalist Albert Rhys Williams, and the pair later lived in Soviet Russia for seven years. After their son was born, she moved to San Francisco, where she focused on raising her family. She made an attempt to break back into movies, which didn't pan out as script structure had changed with the advent of talkies. After her husband died, she moved to Boston. She died in November 1980, and was survived by her son.

His family owns the pesticide company named Mariagro Agr√≠cola Ltda and his children are the owners of another company named Nishimori Agr√≠cola. Political career Nishimori voted in favor of the impeachment against then-president Dilma Rousseff and political reformation. He would later vote in against opening a corruption investigation against Rousseff's successor Michel Temer, and voted in favor of the 2017 Brazilian labor reforms. Nishimori is a supporter of reforming the pension system run by the government in Brazil. Nishimori was one of the principal drafters of bill 6299, which relaxed the rules concerning the usage of pesticides on Brazilian farms. This bill essentially overturned Law 7.8022 passed in 1989 that limited the amount of pesticides that the Ministry of Agriculture would allow used, with regulation from health agencies. Bill 6299 was passed and became a law in 2018. There was some controversy as Nishimori's company profited from the loosening laws regarding pesticide usage that Nishimori helped pass.

The character Poori is portrayed by Menaka Peiris. The teledrama was telecasted on the Independent Television Network (ITN) with 75 episodes‚Äîairing on Saturday and Sunday at 8:30 p.m.  Synopsis  This teledrama shows the story of Poori, who lives in a slum village with her bedridden father and Araliya, who lives in a bungalow. Maata often visits Poori and treats her as his sister. Maali is a stubborn but kind-hearted girl who lives in the same village and Pubba is her boyfriend. Together, Maali and Pubba villagers when they are in trouble. Pubba works in Madawa's garage, and Maali often visits him. Anas and Kapila are the friends of Pubba who also work in the garage. Araliya commits suicide because her sister-in-law continuously fights for a dowry. When Sapumal comes to know that his only sister committed suicide, he gets excited and wonders what to tell his father, finally deciding to bury her secretly. Araliya's father visits the bungalow, but is unaware of his daughter's death. The others in the bungalow pretend that Araliya is just ill. Aari is one of the only rich people in the village and marries Suddi. Later, Pubba repeatedly comes to meet Maali with his friends. After a few days, Anas tries to get Maali's attention, but at the same time is scared to reach her. Meanwhile, Poori gets caught by the police for tapping Arrack secretly. In order to escape them, she accidentally gets into the vehicle of Sapumal and gradually falls asleep. Without knowing that Poori was in his car, Sapumal drives the vehicle to the bungalow. Punchi Nona, who always comes to get Sapumal's bag, sees Poori and screams. Poori was then taken to the bungalow and was dressed as Araliya. Poori, not knowing anything, helplessly does what they say. Everyone in the bungalow seems happy after seeing Poori and mistaking her as Araliya, but Poori still seems unhappy. Meanwhile Madawa gets shocked by the disappearance of Poori. Madawa, along with Maali, Pubba, Anas and Kapila search for Poori in the village but fail. Many in the village assume that Poori must have eloped with a rich guy, but Madawa believes that Poori might return. He lives several days with this belief and for her return. After a few months, Aari ends up joining politics, followed by Madawa. Meanwhile Pubba proposes to Maali, but Maali rejects him every time he proposes. Pubba gets upset and remains eager to know the reason behind her rejection. Maali, who is known to the audience as a cool, stubborn person, gets emotional for the first time.

Life and career Born on March 13, 1907 in the District of Columbia, MacKenzie graduated from Western High School in Washington, D.C., and Brown University, Class of 1929, in Providence, Rhode Island. He took up golf in 1921 at the age of 14, and by 1924 had won three invitational tourneys and qualified for the U.S. Amateur held at Merion Golf Club, in Ardmore, Pennsylvania. In the 1924 U.S. Amateur at Merion, his first national exposure, at age 17, he qualified for the 32-man match-play bracket, and drew George Von Elm as his partner. In 1925, MacKenzie won the qualifying medal in the U.S. Amateur held at Oakmont Country Club in suburban Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania with a course-record 71 and 74 for 145, two ahead of Bobby Jones and Jesse Guilford. In 1926, at age 19, while just a freshman at Brown, he was named to the 1926 Walker Cup team with Jesse Guilford, Francis Ouimet, Watts Gunn, Jess Sweetser, Bobby Jones, George Von Elm, and Robert Gardner in the competition held at the Old Course at St Andrews in Scotland. In a preliminary round, MacKenzie defeated one of the most skillful putters in Scotland, William John Guild, 3 and 2, eliciting praise from the press: His record as the youngest player selected for Walker Cup play stood for 5 decades. MacKenzie's best showing in the U.S. Amateur was in 1927, advancing to the semi-finals before losing to Chick Evans in a 37-hole battle. In 1928, he was again named to the Walker Cup team for the match held at the Chicago Golf Club in Wheaton, Illinois, with Charles Evans Jr., Francis Ouimet, Watts Gunn, Jess Sweetser, Harrison R. Johnston, and George Von Elm. His last appearance on the Walker Cup team was in the 1930 match, held at the Royal St George's Golf Club in Sandwich, England, with Harrison R. Johnston, George J. Voigt, George Von Elm, Donald K. Moe, Oscar Willing, and Francis Ouimet. In his three years on the Walker Cup team, MacKenzie compiled a 5-1 record. In 1931 he went to California and worked as an assistant movie director, counting Howard Hughes, Will Rogers, and Bing Crosby among his golfing friends. In the mid-1930s, he briefly turned professional and worked as golf pro at the Congressional Country Club in Bethesda, Maryland, the Broadmoor Golf Club in Colorado Springs, Colorado, and the Ponte Vedra Club in Florida. Over the years, MacKenzie compiled a record that included Middle Atlantic Amateur titles 23 years apart (a tournament record), eight appearances in the U.S. Amateur between 1923 and 1948, membership on three Walker Cup teams, 1926, 1928 and 1930, and four Maryland State Golf Association father-and-son tournaments, playing with a son or a stepson. In 1965, he won the Maryland State Golf Association's seniors tournament. He was at various times the club champion at the Elkridge Club, the Baltimore Country Club and the Green Spring Valley Hunt Club. He was a member or past-member of the Gulf Stream Club in Delray Beach, Florida, the Country Club of North Carolina, and the Pinehurst Country Club. Two of his farm properties were developed as golf courses, \\"Oak Lea Farm\\" in Silver Spring, Maryland as Argyle Country Club, and ‚ÄúShamrock Farms‚Äù in Pinehurst, North Carolina as Foxfire Resort & Country Club. MacKenzie died at the age of 81 on Saturday, November 19, 1988, at his home in Owings Mills, Maryland.

China has a long history of navigation and sailing, and in the early Ming, Chinese navigational power was even stronger than the European powers. The founder of the Ming dynasty, the Hongwu Emperor, known as Zhu Yuanzhang or Taizu, strictly prohibited sailing abroad, but one of his later successors, the Yongle Emperor, preferred to use large fleets to build a tributary system and to show the Ming empire's national power. After his death, however, emperors were disinclined for supporting such explorations to the world overseas. The revival of maritime trade happened in mid 16th century when the Portuguese were allowed to trade in the port city of Macao and the Longqing Emperor opened Quanzhou as a port for legal international trade.  Origin of Ming Sailors  Sailors were mainly from coastal areas, but the area of Min, today known as Fujian, was most famous for its people's skills in sailing. The Min people chose to make a living from the sea because their lands were close to the ocean, making them too salty for efficient farming. These cultivated lands seldom produced enough crops, so most Min people tended to work on boats or marine trade. The Ming government, however, prohibited maritime trade unil 1567, so the Min people's commercial activities were illegal. Caught between salty, infertile fields and the maritime ban, many of them secretly participated in illegal trade. Illegal trade attracted pirates, both from local areas and from Japan, whose interactions with coastal areas posed a threat to coastal defense officials. One Ming official pointed out that opening ports would benefit both the government and local people because allowing maritime trade could turn illegal profits into government revenue, while at the same time reducing the pressure on the Ming coastal defense.Xu Fuyuan Ë®±Â≠öÈÅ† ÁñèÈÄöÊµ∑Á¶ÅÁñè (Memorial of Lifting the Maritime Ban)  Zheng He's Voyages  Zheng He chose boatmen who had experience in sailing in the ocean from Fujian, Guangzhou, and Zhejiang areas.Gong Zhen ÈûèÁèç Ë•øÊ¥ãÁï™ÂúãÂøó (Book of Various Countries in the Western Ocean) The Min people's skills of navigation brought them a sterling reputation. One Ming envoy, Gao Cheng wrote a story about how Min people helped him travel to Ryukyu to fulfill his duty. Gao Cheng was sent to Ryukyu but he knew nothing about sailing. His friends recommended him that Min people knew sailing well and he found three sailors. These sailors pointed out that Gao's ship was not strong enough to sail across the sea, but it was too late, and also too costly, to build a new one. Though they knew the potential dangers, these experienced sailors showed excellent skills during the voyage. Gao described their skills, stating that they knew upcoming storms by seeing marine creatures, recognized nearby islands by observing the waves, and decided directions by reading a compass. They were calm when the ship was badly damaged in a storm, and comforted four hundred people during the danger. They arrived at Ryukyu safely, and the author praised not only Min people's skills but also their virtues.Gao Cheng È´òÊæÑ ÊìçËàüË®ò (Records of Operating Boats) While these experienced men made up a good portion of the seaman in Zheng He's voyages, however, they also included banished criminals who were pressed into service.Louise Levanthes, When China Ruled the Seas: The Treasure Fleet of the Dragon Throne, (Oxford University Press), pp. 83 These men were to be rewarded by the emperor with money and cloth should they survive the perilous journey, while their families would be compensated accordingly if a crew member died at sea.  Division of Occupation  In classical Chinese, people who professionally worked with navigation were generally called boat operators (Zhou Shi or Zhou Ren). The word originally meant navy, but from at least the Tang Dynasty onward, its meaning changed to ‚Äúboatman‚Äù. Later, after the Song Dynasty, the word Zhou Shi specifically refers to skilled boatmen who had knowledge about geography and astronomy. They had to observe stars at night, sun at day, and compass in cloudy days.Zhu Yu Êú±ÂΩß ËêçÂ∑ûÂèØË´á (Talks in Ping Zhou) In the Ming Dynasty, the boat operator's responsibility was more specialized: people separately managed anchors, masts, sails, rudders. Many ships also had specific men in charge of worshiping sea gods (sixiang).  Zheng He's Voyages  In Zheng He's fleets, the records of specialization were slightly different. There were people called foreman (huozhang), who were specifically responsible for directions in navigation by using complicated knowledge about the compass. They usually came from coastal areas where people mainly lived near the sea and thus many of them had rich sailing experience. Rudder operators (duogong) were in charge of physically operating rudders under the instructions of foremen. Anchorman (bandingshou) controls dropping and weighing anchors. There were also people who repaired the anchors, hulls and sails.Edward L.Dreyer, Zheng He China and the Oceans in the Early Ming Dynasty, 1405-1433 (New York: Pearson Longman), P.128 The fleets in Zheng He's voyages were also populated by various other people with differing skills. During Zheng He's voyages, eunuchs served as ambassadors to other countries and worked on administrative posts on the ships, while boat captains were appointed by the emperor and were allowed to kill any dissenters on board to maintain order. Other crew members included astrologers and geomancers who were responsible for forecasting the weather, interpreting natural events, keep the calendar, and made astronomical observations to help the fleet navigate the seas, while 180 medical officers and pharmacologists served on ships to treat wounded or sick sailors. To help with communication with other nations, ten instructors served on board as translators, and were given the title ‚Äútong yi fan shu jiao yu guan,‚Äù meaning ‚Äúteacher who knows foreign books‚Äù. Finally, specialized workmen to help repair and maintain the ship such as ironsmiths, scaffolding builders, and caulkers were included as part of the ship's crew so repairs could proceed efficiently when needed. The complex number of moving parts on the ships during Zheng He's voyages showed the many different sub-occupations sailors had.  Nautical Technology and Knowledge   Navigation Innovations  Technologically, Ming sailors took advantage of advances made over thousands of years by preceding powers and dynasties. Much of Ming sailors relied on navigation based on star observations, known to the sailors as hai chung. However, Ming sailors were able to take advantage of the magnetic compass, which was developed and in use by the 11th century.Joseph Needham, Science and Civilisation in China (Cambridge, England: University Press) Vol. 4, pp.562 By the late 16th and early 17th centuries, Ming navigators were using terrestrial globes as a method for navigation. While globes were first developed by the ancient Greeks and later preserved by Arab scholars, the Ming readily accepted this as a form of navigation.Needham, Science and Civilisation in China. p.584  Shipbuilding Innovations  Ming sailors were also able to take advantage of centuries of shipbuilding innovation from previous regimes. Most if not all Ming sailors at the time sailed on six different types of ships: tower ships, combat junks, sea hawk ships, covered swoopers, flying barques, and patrol boats.Needham, Science and Civilisation in China. pp.424-425 While many of these ships were made for military operations, they some ships were also converted into civilian use. These different types of ships were not unily built differently, but were also varied to fit the needs of a specific region. For example, sea going vessels in Chiang-nan had flat and broad bottoms for sailing over shoals and sandbanks, but ships in Fukien and Kuangtung had rounded bottoms and high decks for easy maneuverability around rocks and other dangerous obstacles in the deep ocean.Needham, Science and Civilisation in China. p.429 As a result of this, the different composition of these ships meant that the skills of the sailors varied from these ship types. In addition, most Chinese ships used multiple sails, an innovation that Europeans would not take advantage of until the late 15th century.Needham, Science and Civilisation in China. p.474 Because of the multiple sails, Ming sailors were able to take advantage of wind more often, as greater surface area of multiple sails gave ships greater propulsion in water. In fact, during the various voyages of Zheng He, the largest treasure ships had nine masts to compensate for the large 440 foot long ships that the wind needed to push.Needham, Science and Civilisation in China. p.480  Communication Innovations  Communication was also vital for sailors during the Ming Dynasty. During Zheng He's voyages, an elaborate system of sound and visual signals were developed to better coordinate with other ships. The system included signal bells, five large banners, a large drum and flag, gongs, and ten lanterns. Sailors thus had to know which sound or visual cue meant. For example, sound signals were meant for onboard commands, while drums signaled to neighboring ships to seek harbor for approaching storms. Meanwhile, lanterns were used to convey signals at night or in poor weather while carrier pigeons were used to carry out long distance messages.Levanthes, When China Ruled the Seas: The Treasure Fleet of the Dragon Throne  Knowledge  Knowledge about ocean currents was important to sailors in the Ming Dynasty. One source pointed out that in the first, second, third, fourth, fifth, sixth and thirtieth day of every month, the water was ‚Äúawake‚Äù (shui xing), which meant the ocean would be more violent and water flowed much rapidly. The ocean would be calm and still on the seventh to fifteenth in every month and would again be violent from sixteenth to twentieth day. Then, water would be calm from twenty first to the end of every month.  Sailor's Beliefs  Sailors had diverse idols and religious figures, but people worshiped and sacrificed to them mainly for a safe voyage and material wealth. There were three main sea gods who enjoyed continual worship: Guan Yu, Mazu, and the God of Boats.  Guan Yu  Guan Yu, the Han general, was formally deified by Emperor Wanli in 1615. Guan Yu was originally a general in the Three Kingdoms period. He is celebrated by Chinese for his bravery and loyalty. Later, he was deified as one Daoist god and enjoyed sacrifices for various purposes.  Mazu  Tianfei, the Heavenly Princess, or Mazu, was the most famous sea goddess in Chinese marine culture. Originally, she was a Song woman with a surname of Lin born in a county of Fujian, the Min area. Sailors believed that she had the power to rescue endangered people on the sea and worshiped her for safety during a voyage. She was granted different titles through the Song, Yuan and Ming governments.Edward L.Dreyer, Zheng He China and the Oceans in the Early Ming Dynasty, 1405-1433 (New York: Pearson Longman), pp.148-149 During the period of Emperor Wanli (1573‚Äì1620), she was portrayed as a guardian of the nation, protector of the people and a bright, benevolent goddess. Mazu had a temple in the region of Chiwan, where Shenzhen is today.Roderich Ptak and Cai Jiehua, ‚ÄúThe Mazu Inscription of Chiwan (1464) and the Early Ming Voyages‚Äù, from Zeitschrift der Deutschen Morgenl√§ndischen Gesellschaft (Harrassowitz Verlag) Vol. 167 No. 1 (2017), pp. 192 Fisherman and sailors regularly visited the religious site to attend religious ceremonies, praying for protection against the dangers of the sea. One particular ceremony was the cisha, or ‚Äú to leave the sand‚Äù ceremony, in which sailors prayed at the shrine to leave land and enter the sea. In this particular ceremony, sailors would prepare offerings of beef, lamb, and pork, sacrifice the animals, strip the meat from them, and fill the skin with grass to be plunged into the ocean.Roderich Ptak and Cai Jiehua, ‚ÄúThe Mazu Inscription of Chiwan (1464) and the Early Ming Voyages‚Äù. pp. 195  God of Boats  It is unknown that when the God of Boats was created, but he was widely worshiped by sailors. Sailors had their conventional knowledge to predict weather. For instance, one record wrote that ‚Äúif the southeast sky is cloudy in the morning, it will be rapid rain before noon; if the northwest sky is cloudy in the evening, it will be windy rain at midnight.‚ÄùZhang Xie Âº†ÁáÆ ‰∏úË•øÊ¥ãËÄÉ (Research on Eastern and Western Oceans) Volume 9  Omens and Superstitions  Sailors also had their own taboos. For example, it was ominous to load ships with goods in every first, seventh, eleventh, seventeenth, twenty-third, and thirtieth day of solar months and every third, seventh, twelfth, and twenty-sixth day of lunar months.  In Literature  Literary works about seafaring during the Ming Dynasty mainly focus on three categories: ocean deities, fighting Japanese pirates, and rags- to-riches stories. Protagonists usually go on voyages due to poverty, and they experience various miracles or fortunate accidents which make them rich.Fan, Tao.

It talks about a young man named Wen Ruoxu who goes to sea with some merchants and sell tangerines from Lake Tongting to a foreign country and gains money. Later, he finds a tortoise-shell in an island. Wen sells it to a Persian merchant and uses the silver he gets to start business and becomes a rich merchant in Min area.Mengzhu Ling, ‚ÄúThe Tangerines and the Tortoise Shell,‚Äù from Slapping the Table in Amazement (1628). pp. 239-266  References   Notes   Sources   Chinese Sources  Fan, Tao.

Outside is the world from which she has been severed: the San Francisco of her youth and her young son, Jackson. Inside is a new reality: thousands of women hustling for the bare essentials needed to survive; the bluffing and pageantry and casual acts of violence by guards and prisoners alike; and the deadpan absurdities of institutional living.

Nuckolls (1938 ‚Äì July 30, 1987) was an American lighting designer, author and educator. Nuckolls was influential in the establishment of the lighting design field in higher education. He authored the 1976 book Interior Lighting for Environmental Designers, which is considered to be the first textbook in the field of architectural lighting design. Education and work Nuckolls was born in San Francisco in 1938. He graduated from the University of California, Berkeley with a degree in economics before completing a Master of Fine Arts in theater at Carnegie-Mellon University in 1964. He worked as a theater lighting designer in New York City until 1966, when he co-founded the lighting design firm Gersztoff, Nuckolls & Warfell. Throughout the 1970s, he worked as an architectural consultant and a lighting designer, including for the engineering firms Syska Hennessy and Bolt, Beranek and Newman In 1969, Nuckolls and fourteen other working lighting designers met to discuss forming a professional organization. This group officially incorporated as The International Association of Lighting Designers in 1971. Teaching and writing Nuckolls began teaching at Parsons School of Design in 1973, the same year the school merged with The New School for Social Research. Parsons had recently disbanded its Department of Interior Design and, under the direction of chair Allen Tate, restructured its programs into a new Department of Environmental Design. The goal of the new program was to encourage a more interdisciplinary interior design practice embedded in social science research, operating across traditional boundaries between architecture, interior design, landscape architecture and the environment. In the new interdisciplinary Environmental Design department, Nuckolls taught project- based lighting design classes, initially in the school's continuing education program. During this period, Nuckolls served as the first lighting editor of Interiors magazine. He published Interior Lighting for Environmental Designers in 1976. Often called the field's first textbook, Interior Lighting combined technical approaches to electrical lighting with the application of aesthetic, social, and psychological issues in environmental design. The success of Interior Lighting and Nuckoll's teaching helped Allen Tate convince the administration at Parsons to officially establish a program in Lighting Studies. In 1984, the program began offering an MFA in Lighting Design, which was the first degree of its kind. Death and legacy Nuckolls died in 1987 from AIDS-related complications. Before his death, he had been named as an honorary board member by Design Industries Foundation Fighting AIDS (DIFFA). In 1988, The Nuckolls Fund for Lighting Education was established. The fund offers grants to researchers, colleges, and universities to establish programs in higher education to expand the field of lighting design. In 2016, Architectural Lighting magazine published a special issue, called \\"30 Moments in Lighting,\\" chronicling the most important developments in the field since 1986. The issue featured two articles about Nuckolls's contributions, as founder of the discipline's first institution of higher education, and as co- founder of the IALD. In 2001, the publication inducted Nuckolls into their Hall of Fame based on his key role in organizing architectural lighting design as a field.

History According to tradition, St Francis had visited Pistoia in 1220. Soon after, a few adherents of St Francis had grouped themselves in a small monastery attached to a small church called Santa Maria del Prato or Santa Maria Maddalena, located at about the location of the present church. The property appears to have been granted to them by the canons of the cathedral. As the monastery grew, a new church, representing the present structure, was begun by 1294, dedicated to the Holy Cross, and manned by the Order of Friars Minor Conventual. While the single nave structure with a number of lateral altars was completed by 1340, modifications and refurbishment proceeded for centuries. The lateral windows are thin and tall. The facade was only added in 1707. The convent was suppressed in 1808 by the Napoleonic government, but the friars were allowed to return in 1819. In 1866, the monastery was again suppressed, this time by the Italian State and its buildings passed into property to the Commune. In 1926 the convent was again returned to a community of conventual friars.Diocese of Pistoia In 2016, the Franciscans ceded the property and church to the Congregation of the Sacred Heart of Jesus of Betharram.

She delivered a famous lecture, \\"The Slavery of Women,\\" calling for more rights for women and drawing attention to the societal and legal obstacles that kept women from achieving gender equality. In 1804, with her husband, Giuseppe Lattanzi, she founded Il Corriere delle Dame, one of the first Italian periodicals targeted to a female audience, which covered women's fashion, as well as current events.  Biography  Carolina Arienti was born in Tuscany, to a middle-class family. In 1788, she married writer and politician Giuseppe Lattanzi, and they moved to Mantua. In May 1797, Lattanzi was admitted to the Academy of Public Education in Mantua as a member without voting rights. In July 1797, Lattanzi delivered a lecture at the Academy called \\"Della schiavit√π delle donne\\" (The Slavery of Women), which was later published as a pamphlet dedicated to Josephine Beauharnais, who was married to Napoleon Bonaparte. In her lecture, Lattanzi called for more rights for women and denounced the \\"triple slavery\\" of women: fathers force daughters into arranged marriage or convents; husbands are often authoritarian and cruel; and \\"despots\\" deny women the rights of divorce and inheritance, as well as access to education and public office. Lattanzi declared that women could take on equal roles as men in society, but this was not possible because of their lack of education. She also directed much of her speech to women, encouraging them to act on their own behalf. Fashion plate from Corriere delle Dame, circa 1824 (Los Angeles County Museum of Art) In 1804, in Milan, the Lattanzis co-founded Il Corriere delle Dame (Ladies' Courier), one of the first Italian periodicals targeted to a female audience, which covered women's fashion, literature, current events, practical advice, and theatrical reviews. It was among the first periodicals that included illustrations of fashions. Lattanzi chose to launch the periodical in the year before Bonaparte would be crowned King of Italy, anticipating the balls that would take place, at which Milanese high society would want to be dressed fashionably. With this publicity and advertisements that targeted Napoleon's Milanese court, Lattanzi had about 700 subscribers by 1811. In addition to its fashion-oriented content, Il Corriere delle Dame published a supplement called \\"Termometro Politico\\" (Political Thermometer), which covered political issues. It also published musical scores, such as the cavatina for guitar by Nicola Moretti, and pamphlets, such as l‚ÄôElogio storico della Contessa Paolina Secco-Suardo-Grismondi tra le Pastorelle d‚ÄôArcadia Lesbia Cidonia. After Lattanzi's death in 1818, the editorship passed to another woman, Giuditta Lampugnani. It continued to be published until 1875. In addition to her writings for the Corriere, three of Lattanzi's canticles were published in the 1810 anthology Omaggio poetico di vari autori per l'Imeneo di Napoleone con Maria Luigia d'Austria (Poetic Homage by Various Authors for the Marriage of Napoleon and Mary Louise of Austria). In 1815, shortly before she fell ill, Lattanzi published some of her poetry in Diario poetico (Poetic Diary), which was sent to all the Corriere's subscribers.

It is known from a single species, Lamarquesaurus cabazai. This genus and species is represented by MML-PV-42, a well-preserved right maxillary bone (including 10 teeth of varying completeness). This bone was found at the Cerro Tortuga site near Lamarque, Argentina, which preserves fossils from the Cretaceous Allen Formation. The discoverer of the Cerro Tortuga locality, Tito Cabaza, is the namesake of the species.  Description  The maxilla is in length; including missing portions it would have been about long if complete. The inner surface of the maxilla is deeply concave but the outer surface has several scattered pits as well as deep facets above the third and fifth teeth. These facets are remniscent of those which sphenodonts possess on the lower jaw due to abrasion from teeth of the upper jaw, but this cannot be the case in Lamarquesaurus's maxilla. This is because the lower jaw of sphenodonts contacts the inner edge of the maxilla when the mouth is closed; the outer surface of the maxilla would not be eroded by teeth because it never contacts the lower jaw. Therefore, these concavities (referred to as \\"false wear marks\\") must have had a different origin than true wear marks. The outer surface of the maxilla of Lamarquesaurus also has a characteristic longitudinal ridge which is large and roughly-textured at the front part of the bone and forks into two ridges at the rear part of the bone. The teeth are widely spaced and roughly conical, with ridges on their outer surface and slanted wear facets on their inner surface. These wear facets indicate that Lamarquesaurus was an advanced sphenodont capable of propalinal (front-to- back) jaw movement. Although they do not closely resemble the wide, rectangular teeth of eilenodontine opisthodonts, there are no qualities which preclude a relationship between Lamarquesaurus and basal opisthodonts such as Opisthias, or alternatively members of the family Sphenodontidae such as the modern tuatara (Sphenodon). Lamarquesaurus's discovery bolsters the theory that eupropalinal sphenodonts continued to dominate the \\"small reptile\\" niche of South American ecosystems during the Cretaceous and early Cenozoic, while other sphenodonts went extinct and were replaced by lizards in the Northern Hemisphere.

Biography  Akhmetov was born in the Bag‚Äòdod District of the Uzbek Soviet Socialist Republic on November 10, 1943. By the time he was a young adult, he was studying at the Kokand Technical School of Mechanization with a major in electrification and agriculture. After graduation, he worked as a mechanic for the Akhunbabaevsky regional association \\"Uzselkhoztekhnika\\" for about a year. He began his military service by studying as a cadet at the Tashkent Higher Tank Command School from 1962‚Äì1965. From 1965‚Äì1969, he served in the Baltic Military District (which comprises the Baltic republics of Estonia, Latvia, and Lithuania) where he was a commander of a tank platoon while concurrently acting as secretary of the Komsomol committee of an artillery regiment (beginning in 1966). In 1969, he was transferred to the Northern Group of Forces in the Polish People's Republic, where he did administrative political work for the local Komsomol. In 1972, he was sent to the Samarkand Higher Tank Command School, which was transformed in 1974 into a automobile school. For the rest of the decade, Akhmetov served in various regiments in Soviet Uzbekistan and the Turkestan Military District. In 1985, he graduated from the Malinovsky Military Armored Forces Academy. In December 1986, he was appointed Chief of Staff the Civil Defense of the Tashkent Region. That same year, Akhmetov was elected a member of the Tashkent regional council. On September 10, 1991, by the decree of newly elected President Islam Karimov, Akhmetov was appointed Minister of Defense of the Republic of Uzbekistan. The post of defence minister, which had been established only 4 days prior to his appointment, had never been filled before, making him the first to hold such a position. His role became effective as of July 3, 1992, when development of the ministry concluded. According to V. Ponomarev, a close associate of Colonel Akhmetov, the appointment came as a \\"complete surprise\\" due to his belief that the country has \\"generals who are no less worthy to take this position\\". The appointment of Akhmedov also caused skepticism from Russian- speaking officers of the Uzbek army due to his lack of authority among his subordinates. In January 1992, on the basis of units of the Ministry of Internal Affairs of the Republic, he ordered that the Uzbekistan National Guard be formed, which would be subordinated directly to his office as Minister of Defense. On September 29, 1997, he was removed from his post in the Defense Ministry to serve as Ministry of Emergency Situations, a position he would serve in before retiring in 2000. Personal life He is married and has four children (three daughters and a son). His wife works wife works as a doctor. In 2015, it was reported that Akhmedov was placed in an intensive care unit. On his 75th birthday in 2018, he was awarded the Dustlik Order by President Shavkat Mirziyoyev and was honored at a ceremony Ministry of Defence hosted by Abdusalom Azizov.
