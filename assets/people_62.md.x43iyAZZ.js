Pease, Shostak, Lamport: ‚ÄúReaching agreement in the presence of faults‚Äù Lamport, Shostak, Pease: ‚ÄúThe Byzantine generals problem‚Äù :. :. :These two papers introduced and studied the problem that is nowadays known as Byzantine fault tolerance. The 1980 paper presented the classical lower bound that agreement is impossible if at least 1/3 of the nodes are faulty; it received the Edsger W. Dijkstra Prize in Distributed Computing in 2005. The highly cited 1982 paper gave the problem its present name, and also presented algorithms for solving the problem. Herlihy, Shavit: ‚ÄúThe topological structure of asynchronous computation‚Äù Saks, Zaharoglou: ‚ÄúWait-free k-set agreement is impossible ‚Ä¶‚Äù :. G√∂del prize lecture. :. :These two papers study wait-free algorithms for generalizations of the consensus problem, and showed that these problems can be analyzed by using topological properties and arguments. Both papers received the G√∂del Prize in 2004. Foundations of distributed systems Fundamental concepts such as time and knowledge in distributed systems.

The album title refers to Pallot's 2009 graduation from university with a first-class honours English Literature degree. Background and production The album was released more than three years after the gold-selling Fires and marks a change in the musical genre for Pallot. According to her biography on her official MySpace page: \\"The Graduate has piano-driven songs high on happy pills, woozy electronics and beefed up bass. Where guitars would once have swooned, now they swagger and there is a new-found feistiness to Pallot‚Äôs emotive vocals.\\" The album was self-produced and recorded in the North London studio she shares with her husband, Grammy-nominated producer Andrew Chatterley. Pallot's record label had originally sent her to the States to work with Linda Perry. The pair recorded two songs together before Pallot returned home. Then came sessions with Rob Davis and Rick Nowels with whom Pallot wrote 15 songs, none of which appear on The Graduate. Pallot recalls: \\"I finally realised that, on my own, I was more honest and less self-conscious, and wrote my best songs.\\" At the same time, Pallot returned to Birmingham City University to complete the English degree she had started while making Fires: \\"I found the routine of studying literature and writing about it cleared my head and at the same time it was a real inspiration when it came to writing lyrics. It also required a lot of discipline ‚Äì something I had seldom applied to other areas of my life!\\" A major shift in Pallot's sound was down to the music she was listening to: \\"My tastes have definitely changed,\\" she says. \\"I've come to really love good pop music. Like everyone else, I was bored stiff of singer/songwriters and wanted to find something fresh. The band I became obsessed with was MGMT. I was inspired by their attitude to making music. It's so creative. They just throw out lots of ideas, try out lots of mad sounds and have a laugh, but with the basis of really strong songs. I didn't want to think about what would get on the radio or what‚Äôs the trendy sound right now. I just went for it and had fun.\\" Singles The lead single from the album was \\"Real Late Starter\\", released on download and limited edition 7\\" vinyl on September 28, 2009. The music video for the song was directed by Marc Klasfeld, who previously directed Pallot's \\"Everybody's Gone to War\\" clip in 2006. Bolstered by a TV performance on The Alan Titchmarsh Show and several radio appearances, the song peaked at #29 on the UK Airplay Chart in October 2009. Despite not charting on the UK Singles Chart, the song peaked at #19 on the UK Indie Singles Chart. A second download-only single, \\"I Don't Want to Go Out\\", followed on March 1, 2010. This single featured Pallot's cover of Lily Allen's \\"The Fear\\", and despite not charting officially, it peaked at #30 on the UK Airplay Chart in March 2010 - becoming Pallot's sixth successive UK Airplay Top 30 hit after \\"All Good People\\" (#21, August 2005), \\"Everybody's Gone to War\\" (#3, May 2006), \\"Sophia\\" (#12, October 2006), \\"Learning to Breathe\\" (#22, January 2007), and \\"Real Late Starter\\" (#29, October 2009).

Now closed to rail traffic, the bridge is currently used as a footpath. History Kielder Viaduct, spandrel detail Kielder Viaduct, information plaque The viaduct was conceived in a joint project of the Border Counties Railway and the North British Railway as part of the former's extension to in Scotland. The project was completed in 1862 but the Border Counties Railway had been absorbed by the North British Railway two years earlier. In order to meet with the approval of local landowner the Duke of Northumberland who had a shooting lodge nearby, the viaduct was built in a Baronial style and decorated with a battlemented parapet and faux arrow slits. Robert Nicholson had been the engineer responsible for building the first section of the line but, on his death in 1855, his nephew John Furness Tone (1822‚Äì1881) took on the task of completing the project and it was under his direction that contractors William Hutchinson and John Ridley built the viaduct. The arches are constructed at a skewed angle and the stones are laid along helical courses, according to a set of principles attributed to architect and mathematician Peter Nicholson. The railway company had hoped to tap the coal traffic from Plashetts colliery that opened nearby in the 1850s but this proved disappointing, although there was some traffic from forestry in the area. Passenger traffic was always limited, though the line did open up the North Tyne valley and was in part responsible for the increase in population there. The North British Railway, therefore, gained its own route between Edinburgh and Newcastle upon Tyne via Hexham but it compared poorly with the route via Berwick, taking almost five hours to complete the journey. On 1 January 1923 ownership of the viaduct, along with the rest of the line, passed to the London and North Eastern Railway and thence to the North Eastern region of British Railways on nationalisation in 1948. The line through Kielder lost its passenger service on 15 October 1956 and closed completely on 1 September 1958 and the viaduct's future became uncertain when the ¬£167 million Kielder reservoir project was begun in 1976, a substantial part of the route of the old line being lost under the waters. However, steps were taken by the Northumberland and Newcastle Society to protect the viaduct itself by encasing the bases of its piers in concrete and waterproofing the bridge deck. The structure is now a Scheduled Monument and forms part of a footpath from which walkers can enjoy the views from the top of its arches.

The school was founded in 1897 as a school for girls but is now co-educational. History The school was founded in 1897 as a girls' school by Margaret Isabella Gardiner. By September 1902, the present site of the school had been purchased and the first four boarding houses and teaching block completed. In 1909 Lucy Mary Silcox took over as headmistress from the founding head. The student roll grew and in 1910, the Gardiner Assembly Hall and a Library were built and Clough House followed in 1914. Miss Silcox by Lady Ottoline Morrell in 1925 Silcox was able to bring leading thinkers and artists to the school and money was found to buy sculpture and paintings. The modernist paintings inspired pupils like the artist Gwyneth Johnstone who remembered seeing work by Chistopher Wood at the school. Silcox directed the girls in ancient Greek plays. The students knew she was President of the local National Union of Women's Suffrage Societies as gave talks in surrounding villages in support of women gaining the vote. The school continued during the 1914-18 war and during the 1916-1917 school year there was an outpost of the school at Penmaenmawr as some parents were worried about their students' safety. The whole school was evacuated three times and the school took in some Serbian refugees. Today The school accommodates babies and toddlers in the St Felix Nursery, and children up to the age of 18 in the Sixth Form. The school offers boarding throughout the term, weekly, or 'flexi' boarding.Saint Felix School The current head is Mr James Harrison.

Winance was the last surviving founders of St. Andrew's Abbey in Valyermo, California. He taught philosophy at Claremont Graduate University for 38 years. Early life Winance was born in Belgium on 10 July 1909. He was named for St. Eleutherius, the patron saint of freedom. He joined St. Andre's monastery when he was 17 years old. He obtained a doctorate in philosophy in 1934 from the Catholic University of Louvain in Belgium. Benedictine Monk China Winance was ordained a Roman Catholic priest in 1936. The Benedictine order sent him to China that same year. Winance and two other priests then established a monastery in Sichuan province. In 1937, Winance helped to found both a Catholic elementary school and a seminary for the new Diocese of Nanchong (now called the Roman Catholic Diocese of Shunqing), which was established in 1929. Winance and the other Benedictine monks were isolated during the second Sino-Japanese War, which lasted from 1937 until 1945, the end of World War II. The relocated the monastery to the Sichuan capital city of Chengdu following World War II. The monks opened the Institute of Chinese and Western Cultural Studies in Chengdu. The institute's library eventually contained more than 10,000 books and other publications. The city of Chengdu, which was the last stronghold of the Chinese Nationalists, fell to Mao Zedong's Communist forces on 25 December 1949. The Communist authorities shuttered the Institute of Chinese and Western Cultural Studies and confiscated the books in its library. Father Winance and the other monks were forced to attend indoctrination sessions on Marxist philosophy. Winance was accused by police in 1952 of being a member of the Legion of Mary, which the Chinese government alleged was a seditious organization. Winance, along with six priests and five nuns of foreign origin, were expelled from China. The group travelled nearly 3,000 miles under armed guard by bus, train, junk and foot to Guangzhou and then the British controlled colony of Hong Kong. Two Chinese Catholic Benedictine monks remained in China, one of which spent 27 years in prison. United States Following his expulsion from China, Winance was sent to Rome, where he taught philosophy at Sant'Anselmo, a Benedictine college, for four years. In 1958, he published a book of his experiences during the Chinese Revolution entitled, \\"The Communist Persuasion, A Personal Experience of Brainwashing.\\" He next went to St. John's University, Minnesota. In California, he taught in the Claremont Colleges graduate program in philosophy and at St. John's Seminary College in Camarillo. References Reading list *Doyle, Paula. \\"Fr.

Lawrason Riggs and music and lyrics by Cole Porter. The first work by Porter to be produced on Broadway, it was a critical and commercial flop.

Cohan musicals that were popular at the time.Green, Stanley, The World of Musical Comedy: The Story of the American Musical Stage as Told Through the Careers of Its Foremost Composers and Lyricists. Cambridge, Massachusetts: Da Capo Press 1984. , pp. 144‚Äì145 They completed the bulk of their work at the Riggs home in New London, Connecticut, and the script underwent extensive changes between its first draft and the New York opening.Kimball, Robert, The Complete Lyrics of Cole Porter. Cambridge, Massachusetts: Da Capo Press 1992. , p. 42 Four of the songs were interpolated from the 1914 Yale revue Paranoia, or Chester of the Y.D.A.Schwartz, Charles, Cole Porter: A Biography. Cambridge, Massachusetts: Da Capo Press 1979. , pp. 41‚Äì43 Plot The story focuses on Polly Huggins, whose xenophobic father, the wealthy United States Senator Huggins, sends her to a West Coast finishing school with the hope she will find a suitable husband. Polly, however, hopes to snare an English duke with whom she once exchanged furtive glances at a London opera house. Unbeknownst to her, the cowboy who is wooing her actually is her dream man, the Duke, in disguise. They become engaged. Polly's father is willing to adjust his principles when he falls in love with Sarah, the chaperone at her school. Production See America First was produced by Elisabeth Marbury, directed by J. H. Benrimo, and choreographed by Edward Hutchinson and Theodore Kosloff. Anne Morgan, the daughter of J. P. Morgan, and interior decorator Elsie de Wolfe were among its financial backers. Prior to opening on Broadway, it was staged in Schenectady, Albany, and Rochester in Upstate New York, New Haven, Connecticut, and Providence, Rhode Island. The Broadway production opened on March 28, 1916 at the Maxine Elliott Theatre. The cast included Dorothie Bigelow as Polly, Sam Edwards as her father, Clara Palmer as Sarah, John Heath Goldsworthy as Cecil, and Clifton Webb as Percy. The evening before, Marbury had hosted a gala performance for her society friends and business associates, all of whom were enthusiastic about the show, but the critics were far less enchanted and it closed after only 15 performances. Bigelow laid the blame for its failure on Riggs and his book, while he in turn insisted it was due largely \\"to the fact that the composer and I consented to complete transformation of the piece to meet the capabilities of its interpreters and the supposed taste of the public.\\" In a letter to Yale's alumni magazine, Riggs, who had invested $35,000 in the production of the show, announced he was giving up musical theatre as a vocation. He converted to Catholicism, became a priest, and eventually was assigned to the university as a chaplain. Despite the quick demise of See America First, G. Schirmer published sheet music for thirteen of its twenty songs, and the Joseph C. Smith Orchestra recorded \\"When I Used to Lead the Ballet\\" (which had been written for The Pot of Gold in 1912) and \\"I've a Shooting Box in Scotland\\" for Victor.

The music, however, gives the impression that its composer, after the first hour, gave up the task of recreating a Sullivan atmosphere, preferring to seek his inspiration in our own George M.

Although it was only a Category 1 hurricane, Charley caused significant damage in southern Jamaica. Saint Elizabeth Parish sustained the worst damage. About 750 farmers reported damage, and at one point, flooding isolated 30 families. The only fatality in Jamaica occurred after a man attempted to rescue a family but was swept away by flood waters. Following the storm, search and rescue teams were deployed to flooded regions. Days later, officials allocated roughly $7.6 million (JMD; US$86,000) to repair damaged roads. Residents in areas that sustained severe agricultural losses also requested assistance from the government.  Background  Track of Hurricane Charley Hurricane Charley began as a tropical wave that moved off the west coast of Africa in early August 2004. Tracking westward, the system gradually organized and was declared a tropical depression on August 9 while located roughly 115 mi (185 km) south-southeast of Barbados. The following day, the depression intensified into a tropical storm and was given the name Charley after entering the eastern Caribbean Sea. Quickly tracking northwest, the small storm intensified. Late on August 11, as Charley traveled south of Jamaica, it attained hurricane intensity, with winds reaching 75 mph (120 km/h). Over the following days, the storm curved northeast and impacted western Cuba as a Category 3 hurricane before striking Florida as an intense Category 4 hurricane with winds up to 150 mph (240 km/h) on August 13\\\\. The weakened Charley rapidly tracked northeast before dissipating on August 15 near Long Island, New York.  Preparations  On August 10, the National Hurricane Center (NHC), based in Miami, Florida, issued a tropical storm watch for the entire island of Jamaica as Tropical Storm Charley intensified over the eastern Caribbean Sea. Later that day, the watch was upgraded to a warning as the storm quickly approached the island. Early on August 11, a hurricane watch was declared for the island as Charley neared hurricane intensity. Late on August 11, all watches and warnings for Jamaica were changed to hurricane warnings as Charley attained Category 1 status on the Saffir‚ÄìSimpson Hurricane Scale. The warning was later discontinued on August 12 as Hurricane Charley tracked towards Cuba, no longer a threat to Jamaica. Hurricane Charley approaching Cuba on August 12 Following the issuance of hurricane watches, Robert Pickersgill, Minister of Transport and Works in Jamaica closed both airports, Norman Manley International Airport and Sangster International Airport, on the island and shut down all ports. A total of 33 flights were canceled or delayed by the storm. Roughly 3,000 passengers from the Carnival Conquest cruise ship were diverted from their scheduled arrival in Montego Bay, resulting in millions of dollars in losses. Another cruise ship, The Triumph, carrying 2,700 passengers was also diverted. Most businesses on the island were closed on August 12. Emergency shelters were set up across the island ahead of the storm; however, press reports indicate that no one sought refuge in shelters. Residents along the coast were urged to evacuate by the Office of Disaster Preparedness and Emergency Management due to the risk of storm surge and large swells that could inundate low-lying communities. Up to of rain fell in eastern portions of the island, triggering mudslides. On August 11, the Jamaica Red Cross opened its Emergency Operations Center in preparation for Hurricane Charley and placed the warning level at one, the lowest warning level. Residents throughout the country stocked up on emergency supplies and non-perishable food, noted by an increase in sales at shops. In Saint James Parish, emergency officials activated all necessary agencies by August 11. Late on August 11, emergency officials quickly opened 50 shelters in the parish. In Saint Elizabeth Parish, 100 residents sought refuge in the six shelters opened throughout the parish. A total of $1.5 million (JMD; US$17,000) was allocated by the Ministry of Local Government for repairs after the storm. The Jamaica Red Cross alerted local branches to be prepared as Charley approached.  Impact and aftermath  On August 11, a yacht carrying three people was disabled roughly 58 mi (93 km) southeast of the Morant Cays. The Jamaica Defence Force Coast Guard rescued the crew members the following day and brought them to Kingston Public Hospital as they were severely dehydrated and exhausted. During the preparations, storms ahead of the hurricane knocked out power in isolated areas. After nearly completing restoration of the initial power outage, lightning struck a power line and left more residents without electricity. The community of Big Woods was significantly affected by flooding, with 30 families being isolated in the area. The only fatality from the storm also occurred in this community after a man was washed away while trying to rescue a family. The severity of damage in Big Woods prompted Jamaica Labour Party Area Council Four chairman to state that it should be declared a disaster area. Torrential rains during a two-hour span overnight triggered most of the flooding in the area, isolating many homes and inundating several. In Westmoreland Parish, severe flooding inundated several homes and damaged roadways. One home sustained significant damage after a large tree fell on it. In Kingston, high winds damaged power lines and some homes. Water supply to most regions was cut due to damage to pipelines and high water turbidity. Widespread power outages occurred due to numerous downed trees and power lines. The banana industry sustained severe losses, with trees downed and fruit damaged and numerous livestock drowned in flood waters. Initial assessments of agricultural losses from the storm reached $300 million (JMD; US$3.4 million). Residents requested the government for immediate assistance as families were without a source of food and income. Official assessments in four parishes placed the damage to agriculture and livestock at $88.4 million (JMD; US$1 million), with roughly $73.5 million (JMD; US$835,000) of this accounting for 750 farmers in Saint Elizabeth. Roads in Saint Elizabeth sustained substantial damage, with 32 separate roads experiencing severe impacts. Throughout the country, a total of $7.6 million (JMD; US$86,000) was provided to repair the roads, $4.23 million (JMD; US$48,000) of which was used in Saint Elizabeth alone. Widespread damage to crops also resulted in an increased price in store costs. The loss to farmers was untimely as it followed a three-month drought that was preceded by damaging hailstorms that ruined crops. Following the storm, search and rescue teams were deployed, mainly in Saint Elizabeth Parish following reports of flooding.

It is believed to once have had about 60 or 70 Mirage F.1EDs aircraft assigned. Prior to 31 March 1970, the airfield was known as Royal Air Force Station El Adem, and used by the RAF primarily as a staging post.Sir David Lee, 'Wings in the Sun,' Air Historical Branch/HMSO, London, 1989, 157-8. Before World War II, it had been an Italian Air Force airfield. A number of the former Italian buildings were seen remaining in 2003, during a courtesy visit by former RAF personnel, at which time no military aircraft were evident. Royal Air Force Station El Adem was the fuel stop for the BOAC aircraft carrying the new Queen Elizabeth II on her flight from Entebbe to London on 7 February 1952. In 1994, the remaining wreckage of Lady Be Good, a US Army Air Force (USAAF) B-24 Liberator heavy bomber that crashed-landed deep in the Libyan desert during WWII in 1943, was brought to the air base by a local Libyan team led by Dr. Fadel Ali Mohammed (tasked with recovering the plane wreck) for storage and safekeeping. The remnants of the aircraft still remain there. World War II The airfield was largely reconstructed in 1942 by the Royal Air Force (RAF) and brought into operational use on 12 December 1942.

General Vallejo was a critical factor in obtaining the Rancho Sotoyome grant. Fitch hired Cyrus Alexander as ranch manager under a four-year agreement, after which Alexander was to receive two square leagues of land and part of the ranch stock. Fitch petitioned for his grant in 1840, and was officially granted the eight square leagues (approximately ) by Governor Juan Alvarado in 1841. In 1844, Fitch received a three square league addition from Governor Manuel Micheltorena. After Alexander's contract ended in 1845, Mose Carson, brother of Kit Carson, took over as manager of Rancho Sotoyome. Alexander settled on his tract in what is now Alexander Valley.Cyrus Alexander and the Rancho Sotoyome Captain Fitch continued trading up and down the coast, with Rancho Sotoyome as one of the many business enterprises directed from his San Diego base. After the discovery of gold, Fitch planned to move his family north to Rancho Sotoyome, but had not done so before he died in 1849. Following his death, his widow Josefa and their children moved to Rancho Sotoyome. Their third son, Guillermo (William) married Clara Pi√±a, whose relatives owned the adjacent Rancho Tzabaco.Fitch Mountain With the cession of California to the United States following the Mexican-American War, the 1848 Treaty of Guadalupe Hidalgo provided that the land grants would be honored.

USAAF Ninth Air Force units which used the airfield were: * 79th Fighter Group, 19 November 1942 ‚Äì 14 January 1943, P-40 Warhawk * 324th Fighter Group, December 1942 - 2 February 1943, P-40 Warhawk After the war, the airfield appears to have been closed about 1946. Today, the area is abandoned with various concrete parts of the station still in evidence when viewed by aerial photography.

It was produced by London Weekend Television (LWT) for the ITV network and was broadcast in early 1982 in the Friday primetime slot of 9 pm. Plot The show, based in a fictional village in East Anglia, was set around the clandestine and illicit love affair between civilian doctor Helen Dereham (played by Susannah York) whose husband was away fighting in Africa and the commanding officer of the nearby USAAF base, Major Jim Kiley (Michael J. Shannon).

Chuck Ericson * Holly Watson as Betty Bilton * David Baxt as Sgt. Mario Bottone * Stuart Wilson as Sid Davis Production Although a major commission for LWT, the programme was planned for just one series of thirteen hour-long episodes. Production commenced in 1981 with studio scenes filmed at the South Bank Television Centre and location filming in the villages of Lenham and West Malling in the county of Kent. As was standard practice at the time, studio scenes were recorded on 2-inch quadruplex videotape with location scenes shot on 16 mm film and converted to broadcast master tape via telecine. The show was transmitted between February and May 1982. LWT had previously produced Enemy at the Door, a series about the German occupation of Guernsey during the same war, and the two series have a common theme of tension between the locals and the 'intruding' soldiers whose presence affects their ways of life, something which can become obvious when actors play similar roles in similar storylines in both series (most obviously: Ray Smith, as the father of a girl who disapproves of his daughter associating with foreign servicemen). The show's title was based on the popular wartime song \\"We'll Meet Again\\" performed by Dame Vera Lynn. The theme for the show was composed by Denis King. A vocal version was released as a single by Stutz Bear Cats. Other media Writer David Butler produced a novel called We'll Meet Again: The End of an Era that continued the story beyond the TV series.

It was originally published in 1976, not long after the World Food Conference, and has been reprinted several times since. In the book, George examines and disputes two popular ideas: first, that there is not enough food, and second, that the world is over-populated. She argues that the planet could easily feed its present population and many more. She also insists that the problem is not climate change and that food technology will not provide the solution. George instead believes that the problem is that the world food supply is controlled by the wealthy elite and that the poor have no say on the unfair trade that roots out local farmers, who are replaced with foreign agribusinesses to grow profitable cash crops for the West, creating economic, agricultural, and hunger crises in the third world.

It is named after Bark Lake (Lac des √âcorces) that is on its western boundary. History On October 10, 2002, the Municipality of Beaux-Rivages, the Village of Lac-des-√âcorces, and the Village of Val-Barrette merged to form the new Municipality of Beaux-Rivages‚ÄìLac-des-√âcorces‚ÄìVal-Barrette. On June 21, 2003, it changed to its current name. Campbell-Partie-Est / Lac-des-√âcorces / Beaux-Rivages But originally these three municipalities were part of one entity, the Township Municipality of Campbell-Partie-Est. This was created in 1911 by separating from the rest of Campbell Township (now part of Mont- Laurier), which in turn was proclaimed in 1899 and named after Sir Alexander Campbell (1822-1892). In 1914, Val-Barrette was split off from Campbell- Partie-Est and became a separate incorporated village. In 1953, Campbell- Partie-Est was renamed to Lac-des-√âcorces. In 1955, its main settlement became an independent incorporated village, also called Lac-des-√âcorces. In 1984, the township was renamed again, this time to Beaux-Rivages (French for \\"Beautiful Shores\\"), a reference to the beauty of the shores of Bark Lake and that of the many other lakes dotting the territory. Val-Barrette Val-Barrette Thomas Brunet from Thurso is considered the first settler in Val-Barrette who arrived in 1894. But it is named after Z√©phirin Barrette, one of the first local land owners. He arrived here in late 1908, and built a hotel and gave the land to build the church. After the settlement became an incorporated village, he became its first mayor (1914-1915), served as the first postmaster (1909-1920), and was the first president of the school board. Its post office opened in 1909. In 1912, the mission of Saint-Joseph-de-Val-Barrette was founded and became a parish in 1916. Formerly dependent on vegetable crops, wool production, and sawing wood, its economy turns more now toward tourism. Found at this location is one of the largest fish culture stations in Quebec, focusing on raising trout.

The law has also been referred to in English as the \\"Genocide law\\"This usage of the term \\"Genocide Law\\" is not to be confused with the application of Article 73 \\"Genocide\\" of the Criminal Code of the Republic of Albania, Special Part, Chap. 1, Crimes Against Humanity and the \\"Law on Communist Genocide\\". The law excluded, until December 31, 2001, from government, parliament and judiciary, and mass media positions any higher political officials who held office in Albania prior to March 31, 1991, i.e., who held higher positions in Communist Albania: members of politburo, Central Committee, parliament, as well as former secret police agents and informers.\\"Eastern Europe at the Turn of the Twenty-First Century: A Guide to the Economies in Transition\\", by Ian Jeffries, , 2002, p. 72 It was similar to decommunization efforts in other former communist states. A person may run for an office after an investigation of their \\"moral character\\" by a special state commission. The commission decision may be appealed before the Cassation Court. The law was effected a short time before the elections, and many candidates were prevented from standing, simply because the verification stages could not be carried out on time. The affected politicians claimed that it was intended to strengthen the hold of Sali Berisha on power.OMRI Daily Digest II, Open Media Research Institute, No. 186, 25 September 1995\\"Freedom of Religion and Belief: a World Report\\", edited by Kevin Boyle and Juliet Sheen, , 1997, p. 263 An attempt to repeal the law basing on its alleged unconstitutionality was rejected by the constitutional court on January 31, 1996. However some provisions of the law were stricken out. Basing on this law, former President Ramiz Alia, previously amnestied, was imprisoned again, now on charges for crime against humanity. Some decried this application of the law as an example of double jeopardy. The law lasted only two years, because it was repealed during the 1997 rebellion in Albania, and eventually formerly banned politicians entered the coalition government.

It was screened in the Un Certain Regard section at the 1993 Cannes Film Festival. It is based on the 1990 book of the same name. Plot Jim Nashe worked as a fireman, but a large inheritance and a divorce from his wife has left him free to buy a new car and see the country at his leisure. He picks up a hitchhiker, Jack Pozzi, who turns out to be a professional gambler. Pozzi tells how he just lost his net worth when the poker game he was playing at was robbed and he was beaten after the others suspected him of orchestrating the robbery. Now he cannot afford the minimum $10,000 buy-in to play a poker game with a pair of eccentric old millionaires whom he had previously beaten handily. With money and time to spare, the intrigued Nashe offers to back Pozzi with $10,000 for a rematch. The wealthy men, Flower and Stone, live together on a huge estate. They willingly agree to another game, but are not the suckers Pozzi takes them for. After losing at first, they repeatedly win, exhausting the $10,000. Nashe puts up his car for more chips, though he has to agree to $5,000, much less than he says the car is worth. Pozzi loses again. Now Nashe, who needs the car to get home proposes a new bet: a single cut of the cards. If he wins, he gets the car back; if he loses, he owes $10,000. Nashe loses. As Flower and Stone do not trust Pozzi and Nashe to repay the debt, the only option is for them to work it off. The quirky Flower and Stone have a pile of 10,000 large stones, said to be from a 15th-century castle. They would like to build a wall on their property, so they tell Nashe and Pozzi that if they devote the next 50 days to erecting the wall, their debt will be paid. A foreman named Calvin Murks keeps an eye on the two men. Nashe methodically goes about his task, but Pozzi becomes increasingly unhinged, feeling like a slave. Pozzi takes offense at a snide remark by Murks and assaults him, whereupon Murks begins coming to work armed. After learning that the cost of their food is being added to their debt and that Flower and Stone have gone on an overseas trip, Pozzi burrows under the fence to escape. However, the next morning, Nashe finds him, unconscious and badly beaten, outside their shack, and Murks takes him to hospital. Later, Murks says that Pozzi recovered and left, but Nashe believes that Murks assaulted him and that he is dead. Eventually, Nashe leaves.

Biography  Alicia Delgado was born to Zenobio Delgado and Santa Hilario in the town of Taucur, in the province of Oy√≥n, Lima, on May 6, 1959. She began her career with the support of the well-known artist Totita Cruz, who introduced her to the celebrated radio DJ and talent searcher Eladio Obispo Ureta, on whose program ‚ÄúAs√≠ Canta Mi Pueblo‚Äù she sang in front of a microphone for the first time, accompanied by the late master Pelayo Vallejo. On February 11, 1975, at the age of 16, Delgado made her first recording under the direction of artist and producer √Ångel Damaso, which launcher her first hit song: \\"Un Fracaso en la Vida.\\" Through most of her career, she dedicated herself to promoting Andean folk music through South America, becoming a musical star in both her native Peru and in neighboring countries such as Chile, Ecuador, and Bolivia, through which she would become known as the \\"Princesa del Folklore Peruano,\\" or the Peruvian Princess of Folk Music. In her career, she sang more than a thousand Peruvian songs. Delgado married Rub√©n Retuerto and had a son named Junior Retuerto Delgado. As she became successful, she spent various years in the United States. In her later years, she had a very close relationship with Abencia Meza, another traditional Peruvian singer. The two quietly owned an apartment together, and it was widely acknowledged, both by Meza and the general public, that their relationship was intimate, though Delgado never publicly confirmed on that their relationship was more than one of friendship. On June 25, 2009, Delgado's body was found in her home in the Santiago de Surco district of Lima. Initial investigations determined the cause of death to be multiple stab wounds. The primary suspect was a man named Pedro C√©sar Mamanchura Ant√∫nez, Delgado's driver who disappeared after her death, though Meza was thought to be ultimately responsible. When he was found, Mamanchura said that Meza had paid him to kill Delgado, but this testimony was ruled inadmissible because Mamanchura's lawyer wasn't present. His subsequent interviews with police exculpated Meza. Finally, Meza was sentenced with 30 years imprisoned for the murder of Delgado.

He emigrated to France in 1959 and began to work in film during the 1960s. He received critical acclaim for his 1970 directorial d√©but Soleil O. Biography Hondo was born in 1936 in Ain Oul Beri Mathar in the Atar region of Mauritania. His mother was Mauritanian and his father Senegalese.Biography, official site.Sherzer (1996), p. 173. In 1954 Hondo went to Rabat, Morocco, to train to become a chef at the International Hotel School there.Ukadike (2002), p. 57. He emigrated to France in 1959 and found work first in Marseille and then in Paris, variously as a cook, farm labourer, waiter, dockworker and delivery man. He found that he and other African immigrants were unable to gain work in their chosen professions, and in the menial jobs they could find, they were paid less than the French. The difficulty of making a living during this time, as well as the racism he experienced, eventually provided inspiration for his films, including Soleil O and Les 'bicots-N√®gres' vos voisins.Sherzer (1996), p. 174. Hondo began to take classes in acting and directing, and studied under French actress Fran√ßoise Rosay, acting in classic plays by Shakespeare, Moli√®re and Jean Racine. He was unable to fully express himself with French repertoire theatre, and in 1966 formed his own theatre company with Guadeloupean actor Robert Liensol. Named Shango (from Shango, the Yoruba god of thunder), and later Griot-Shango, the company produced plays relating the experiences of Black people, including works by Ren√© Depestre and Aim√© C√©saire.Murphy (2007), p. 71. In the late 1960s, Hondo started taking small roles in television and films.Ukadike (2002), p. 58. He began to learn the craft of film making by careful observation of the work of others, and began to get work behind the camera. He began work on his first film, Soleil O, in 1965.Sherzer (1996), p. 175. Made on a $30,000 budget, it was financed by Hondo's work dubbing American films into French.Reid (1986). Soleil O played during International Critics' Week at the 1970 Cannes Film Festival, where it received critical acclaim.Harvard Film Archive. It received a Golden Leopard award at the 1970 Locarno International Film Festival.Locarno International Film Festival official site. In 1981 he was a member of the jury at the 12th Moscow International Film Festival. Hondo also worked frequently as a voice actor. He worked on the dubbing of many English language films into French, voicing characters played on screen by Sidney Poitier, Morgan Freeman, Ben Kingsley and Danny Glover (on the rare occasions when Glover was not dubbed by Richard Darbois). He dubbed several of Eddie Murphy's films, including The Nutty Professor (1996) and the part of Donkey in 2001's Shrek and its sequels.L'Humanit√© (1997).Canadian Online Explorer (2002). Med Hondo explained on his websiteMed Hondo's open letter to Danny Glover (French and English). that he met with Danny Glover in 1991 and presented his then-current project to him: a biopic of Haitian revolutionary Toussaint Louverture. According to Hondo, an enthusiastic Glover voiced his interest in the lead role, and in taking part in the production side of the film, but then cut all communication with Hondo and co-writer Claude Veillot. Hondo claimed that Glover's own Louverture biopic project, financially backed by Hugo Chavez, was inspired by his original screenplay, and addressed an open letter to Glover in which he denied assertions from Glover's \\"Louverture Films\\" company that the script was a commission paid by Glover to Hondo. Hondo also mentioned his meeting with Glover in an English-language interview on French international news channel France 24. Hondo died in Paris on 2 March 2019, aged 82.

It was formerly a major Royal Air Force airfield known as RAF Deversoir built before World War II. A helicopter unit with SA-342 Gazelle helicopters is based here. History Deversoir was a Royal Air Force (RAF) military airfield built in the 1930s. It was built part of the defences of the Suez Canal, being constructed at the northwest shore of the Great Bitter Lake. During World War II, it was used as a military airfield by the RAF and the United States Army Air Force during the North African Campaign against Axis forces. The airfield received United States President Franklin D. Roosevelt on 12 February 1945 as he flew from the Yalta Conference to rejoin the USS Quincy, which was anchored in the Great Bitter Lake and would host the President's meetings with King Farouk of Egypt, King Abdulaziz of Saudi Arabia, and Emperor Haile Selassie of Ethiopia before transporting him back to the United States. Deversoir appears to have been used by the RAF after the war until 1956, then turned over to the Egyptian Air Force. Modern hardened aircraft shelters were built on wartime-era dispersal pads, and recent runway markings are evident in aerial photography. The airbase is being used to accommodate a helicopter unit flying SA-324 Gazelle, armed helicopters. Royal Air Force Station Deversoir was operative as 324 Fighter Wing in 1950 when it was the home of three squadrons of DeHaviland Vampire aircraft plus 3 Gloster Meteors, one to each squadron. The squadrons were numbers 6,213 and 249. Some time near the end of WW2 the station had been used to house Italian prisoners of war and this was evidenced by a painting done by one of them which was present in 1950 - 1952 in one of the cookhouse dining room for other ranks.

The grammar school was founded in 1547 and started teaching in 1572 with 10 pupils. The grammar school moved to new buildings in 1861, merged with the girls high school in 1966. The college now serves over 1600 school pupils, as well as offering education and facilities to the wider public. Along with being a secondary school of good standing, Queen Elizabeth's also has a sixth form, for students wishing to extend their education past year 11. In the 2015 Ofsted review of the school, the school was rated as \\"Good\\". Queen Elizabeth's is known for its excellence in the fields of performing arts such as music and drama. Each year a play or musical is held by the drama and music departments, with the set decorated by members of the art department staff, and have regularly achieved good feedback. The QE Jazz Band regularly performs locally tours abroad. The college has 13 partner primary schools, of which it is usual that the pupils from said schools continue their education at Queen Elizabeth's past the age of 11. The college's coat of arms shows prominently the figure of Saint Boniface, the patron saint of the town and the most famous person to have ever been born and raised there. For years the college management has been wishing to amalgamate the two parts of the school- Lower, (Years 7 and 8) and Upper, (Years 9, 10, 11, 12 and 13) into a single-site college building. However, despite it being high on the to-do list, it seems unlikely that such a development will occur in the near future, mainly due to funding. A new humanities block composed primarily of permanent classroom \\"blocks\\" (lowered onto each other by crane) has recently been erected in place of the old Quad courts, and was opened in May 2010. The block was built to create a specific area for humanities lessons, so that the \\"main block\\" and \\"West-wing\\" which formerly accommodated them would hold entirely their respective subject areas (science, in the main block, and mathematics and modern foreign languages. In late 2011 the upper site technology blocks, hosting food technology, textiles, graphic products and product design, were refurbished. In February 2011, the school requested to become an academy. The school officially gained academy status on 1 April 2011.

Margherita was regent of Piacenza in 1635, and regent of the entire duchy from 1646 until 1648 during the minority of her son. Life She was the fourth of eight children and the second daughter born to Cosimo II de' Medici, Grand Duke of Tuscany and his wife Maria Magdalena of Austria. Hence Margherita is a descendant of the Holy Roman Emperors.Ancestors of Margherita de' Medici 150px Margherita became engaged to Odoardo Farnese, Duke of Parma in 1620. They married in 1628 when he came of age. The marriage had been strongly desired by Odoardo's father, Ranuccio, who saw it as a means of strengthening the alliance between the Duchy of Parma and the Grand Duchy of Tuscany, then ruled by the Medici family. Duchess of Parma The marriage took place in Florence on 11 October 1628 in Florence. The wedding celebrations were accompanied by much spectacle and pageantry, including the performance of Marco da Gagliano's opera La Flora, composed especially for the occasion. To welcome the couple back to Parma, Mercury and Mars, with music by Claudio Monteverdi and text by Claudio Achillini was performed in the Teatro Farnese. The years in which the couple ruled over Parma were marked by the plague of 1630 and the contrast between the splendour of the court and the tax burden to which they had subjected their subjects. The tax money was used to improve Odoardo's armies. The Duke also had a pro-French policy. According to portraiture and the sources of the time, Margherita was a beautiful woman, as well as amiable and well-educated. Unlike his predecessors, the duke was very devoted and loyal to her and there were never any sources that claimed Odoardo had illegitimate children. Duchess Margherita de' Medici by Justus Sustermans Regency On 11 September 1646, Odoardo died. Their eldest son, Ranuccio was not yet old enough to rule the Duchy alone so his mother, Margherita acted as regent until her son was old enough to govern alone two years later. She served in co-regency with her former brother-in-law, her son‚Äòs uncle, Francesco Maria Farnese. In 1648, her son was declared of legal majority and thus ended her regency. Margherita outlived at least two of her children. She died in Parma on 6 February 1679.

Charter evidence also referred to the group as Wiogorna and was also considered a prouvincia or provincia, an administrative division with its own territorial boundaries. An account also refer to the Husmerae territory as a regio.  History  The Husmerae settled on the banks of the River Stour prior to 736.Victoria County History, Worcestershire III They probably took their name from Usmere, a pool on the boundary of Wolverley whose name in preserved in Ismere House in Churchill, Worcestershire.D. Hooke, Worcestershire Anglo-Saxon Charter-bounds (Boydell, Woodbridge, 1990), 61-3. A source cited that the term was derived from British word udso, Welsh ws (water) and Old English mere. The tribe is mentioned only in the Ismere Diploma of 734, and subsequent charters relating to the same property until 964, when Usmere occurs on the boundary of Cookley in Wolverley.D. Hooke, Worcestershire Anglo-Saxon Charter-bounds, 169-74. This charter was for the foundation of a coenubium (minster). That minster was probably at Kidderminster, quite probably occupying the site of the parish church there.P. W. King, 'The minster aet Sture in Husmere and the northern boundary of the Hwicce' Transactions of Worcestershire Archaeological Society 3rd ser. 15 (1996), 73-4. Although the Husmerae may have been of West Saxon origin, settling into the area some time after the West Saxon defeat of the Britons at the Battle of Dyrham in 577, the Ismere Diploma suggests that Husmerae is the ancient name for area, although uncertainty over its provenance leave the origins of the name open to question.John Blair, The Church in Anglo-Saxon Society (New York, Oxford University Press, 2005). It was specifically referred to as the province south of the Mercian heartlands and was considered an extensive folk territory. A historical description cited it as the area next to the River Stour in a charter records that detailed a grant by King √Üthelbald of Mercia to build a monastery in the location.

Lattice models with nearest-neighbor interactions have been used extensively to model a wide variety of systems and phenomena, including the lattice gas, binary liquid solutions, order-disorder phase transitions, ferromagnetism, and antiferromagnetism.Hill TL. Statistical Mechanics, Principles and Selected Applications. New York: Dover Publications; 1987. Most calculations of correlation functions for nonrandom configurations are based on statistical mechanical techniques, which lead to equations that usually need to be solved numerically. In 1925, Ising gave an exact solution to the one-dimensional (1D) lattice problem. In 1944 Onsager was able to get an exact solution to a two-dimensional (2D) lattice problem at the critical density. However, to date, no three-dimensional (3D) problem has had a solution that is both complete and exact.Hill TL. An introduction to statistical thermodynamics, New York, Dover Publications (1986). Over the last ten years, Aranovich and Donohue have developed lattice density functional theory (LDFT) based on a generalization of the Ono-Kondo equations to three- dimensions, and used the theory to model a variety of physical phenomena. The theory starts by constructing an expression for free energy, A=U-TS, where internal energy U and entropy S can be calculated using mean field approximation. The grand potential is then constructed as Œ©=A-ŒºŒ¶, where Œº is a Lagrange multiplier which equals to the chemical potential, and Œ¶ is a constraint given by the lattice. It is then possible to minimize the grand potential with respect to the local density, which results in a mean-field expression for local chemical potential. And the theory is completed by specifying the chemical potential for a second (possibly bulk) phase. And in an equilibrium process, ŒºI=ŒºII. Lattice density functional theory has several advantages over more complicated free volume techniques such as Perturbation theory and the statistical associating fluid theory, including mathematical simplicity and ease of incorporating complex boundary conditions. Although this approach is known to give only qualitative information about the thermodynamic behavior of a system, it provides important insights about the mechanisms of various complex phenomena such as phase transition, aggregation, configurational distribution, surface-adsorption, self-assembly, crystallization, as well as steady state diffusion.

Plot The premise of the game is a prophecy by Nostradamus that at the end of the 20th century there would be a major world war, beginning somewhere in the Middle East. The game was produced at a time of escalating violence in the Persian Gulf due to the Iran‚ÄìIraq War. The year is 1988 and Robin, an 11-year-old boy with unusual psychic powers, has awoken from a long sleep among the ruins of his former home in Southampton, which has been devastated by a nuclear war. The last thing he remembers is falling asleep as normal in his room. His family and friends are missing and Britain has become an ultra-rightist state. In reality, Robin is living in 1987 and this is a vision of the future. Robin has fallen into a trance from which he cannot wake. He must somehow discover the causes of the disaster that will befall the world, and awake to warn his contemporaries of their possible fate. Gameplay The game is a text adventure with basic graphics to set the scene. The package includes a 160-page book, Mindfighter by Anna Popkess, which lays out the background of the story, and provides hints for play. The player must guide Robin through the hazardous environment of post-apocalyptic Southampton, surviving famine, desperate mobs, radiation sickness, and the violent agents of \\"The System\\", the dictatorial government which now governs Britain.

Marlow was born at Bulwell, Nottinghamshire. In 1878 he played a match for Buxton against a touring Australia team, where he opened a 22-man batting line up scoring one and five, and took one wicket. He made his first-class debut for Derbyshire in the 1879 season against Nottinghamshire in July, when he took three wickets. However he did not play for Derbyshire again until the 1883 season. In the 1883 season he played five matches for the county in which he took a respectable number of wickets, most notably against Sussex with 6 for 27 and another 4 to make a ten wicket match. His most successful season of 1884, saw him play twelve matches and take 34 wickets at 19.97. He took 5 for 43 against MCC, 5 for 31 against Kent which included a hat trick, 5 for 40 against Surrey and his career best of 7 for 46 against Yorkshire. He played four matches in the 1885 season and two in the 1886 season but did not show the same level of performance. A right-arm medium pace bowler, Marlow took 60 first-class wickets at 20.61. His right-handed batting scored 317 runs in 45 first-class innings at 7.92. Marlow umpired one match between his county and a touring Australian side in 1886.

In the years before World War I, the city of Chernivtsi, also called Czernowitz in both German and Yiddish, was the capital of the Bukovina region and a center of Yiddish language and culture. The region became part of Romania following World War I. Burg published his first professional writing in the Chernovitser Bleter, a Yiddish newspaper, in 1934. The Romanian government closed and banned the Chernovitser Bleter in 1938, on charges of Bolshevik propaganda. Burg survived the Holocaust during World War II, but lost his entire family. He took refuge in the Soviet Union. Burg continued to write and publish his works well into his 90s. In 1990, Burg revived the once banned Chernovitser Bleter newspaper as a monthly publication.

Early career  Born into a middle-class family, he joined the priesthood after completing his studies and, although he was defrocked in 1911, he remained a lifelong adherent of conservative Catholicism.Richard S. Levy (2005), Antisemitism: A Historical Encyclopedia of Prejudice and Persecution, Volume 2, p. 556 He then followed a career in journalism, founding the Vita Italiana all'estero as a magazine for emigrants. This was followed by his journal La Vita Italiana, which was noted for its harsh criticism of Jews in the run-up to World War I. He soon became involved in Fascist political circles, eventually becoming a member of Benito Mussolini's fascists and taking part in the March on Rome.  Antisemitism  Preziosi was not initially antisemitic but after Italy's poor returns for the involvement in the First World War he came to blame Jewish elements in Italy for many of its ills.Levy, Antisemitism, p. 557 He argued the Jews were incapable of being racially and spiritually Italian due to what he considered to be their \\"double loyalties\\" and the growth of Zionism and believed in the notions that Jews were behind communism, Freemasonry, capitalism and democracy. Much of his thought was influenced by La Libre Parole, a newspaper founded by Edouard Drumont, Howell Arthur Gwynne's The Cause of World Unrest and The Dearborn Independent of Henry Ford.

Bosworth (2009), The Oxford Handbook of Fascism, Oxford University Press, p. 299 Such were the strength of his beliefs that Preziosi criticized a contemporary antisemitic critic Paolo Orano for his 'soft' stance on Jews.David D. Roberts (1979), The Syndicalist Tradition and Italian Fascism, pp. 324-5 Initially, although a hardliner in terms of his fascism, he denounced Nazism as parochial, exclusionary and responsible for pushing Europe towards communism.Stanley G. Payne (1995), A History of Fascism 1914-45, Routledge, p. 220 In fact in his early years he had demonstrated a strong Germanophobia, even producing a book entitled Germania alla Conquista dell'Italia in 1916.Wiley Feinstein (2003), The Civilization of the Holocaust in Italy: Poets, Artists, Saints, Anti-Semites, p. 200 However, from 1933 onward, he changed tack, becoming a strong advocate of close co-operation with Nazi Germany and occasionally criticized Italian fascism for its lack of emphasis on perceived Jewish wrongdoings. His views reached a wider audience after the passing of the Italian Racial Laws as he began to write articles for the national press as well as his own journal. Preziosi also wrote \\"Ecco il diavolo: Israele\\".  Later career  In 1923, Preziosi coadiuvated the Italian nationalist Ettore Tolomei in preparing the manifesto called the Provvedimenti per l'Alto Adige (\\"Measures for the Alto Adige\\"), becoming the blueprint for the Italianization of South Tyrol campaign. Preziosi's growing prestige was rewarded in 1942 when he was made a minister of state. Following the formation of the puppet state of the Italian Social Republic Preziosi was initially moved to Nazi Germany where he was to serve as Adolf Hitler's adviser on Italian affairs. Whilst in Germany he also had a show on Radio Munich, which was broadcast to Mussolini's Italy, and used it as a platform to attack the likes of Guido Buffarini Guidi and Alessandro Pavolini as \\"Jew lovers\\".Ray Moseley (2004), Mussolini: The Last 600 days of Il Duce, p. 118 He returned to Italy in March 1944 to head up an Ispettorato Generale della Razza (General Inspectorate of Race). In this role he introduced a system based on the Nuremberg Laws and used the new code to crack down on Jewish elements which were deemed unacceptable.Moseley, Mussolini, pp. 118-9 Along with Roberto Farinacci he also became a close ally of Julius Evola during this period in a pro-fascistic alliance.Anthony James Gregor (2004), Mussolini's Intellectuals: Fascist Social and Political Thought, p. 219 Preziosi's activities were at times frustrated by Mussolini, who held a long- standing personal hatred for this \\"former priest\\", but Preziosi's efforts still ensured that the puppet Italian state would be involved in the Nazi war effort.A. James Gregor & Alessandro Campi (2001), Phoenix: Fascism in Our Time, p. 175 In the late days of the war, following a narrow escape from Partisans on the 26th of April 1945, Preziosi fled on foot with his wife Valeria to the city of Milan where they found refuge in the homes of friends. The next day they were found to have taken their own lives by throwing themselves out of a fourth floor window.

Vahidi is president of the Supreme National Defense University since August 2016 and member of the Expediency Council, since August 2017. Early life and education Vahidi was born on 27 June 1958 in Shiraz. His real name is Ahmad Shah Cheraghi (his nickname is Vahid). He holds a bachelor's degree in electronics and a master's degree in industrial engineering. He received a PhD in strategic studies from Imam Sadegh University. Career Vahidi joined Revolutionary Guards in 1979. He was made deputy to the then Revolutionary Guards commander Mohsen Rezai for intelligence affairs in 1981. The same year he was also named commander of the Balaal base. In 1983, he joined the Quds Force, a unit of the Revolutionary Guards that is responsible for operations outside of Iran.

Vahidi was serving as the commander of a special unit of Iran's Revolutionary Guard is known as the Quds Force when the attack occurred. He is one of five Iranians sought in the bombing. Iran denies that it was involved. In June 2010, Vahidi was blacklisted by the U.S Government, a measure which is aimed at freezing the assets of proliferators of weapons of mass destruction (WMD) and their supporters thereby isolating them from the U.S. financial and commercial systems. In May 2011, Vahidi paid an official visit to Bolivia. Upon this event in June 2011, Bolivia apologized to Argentina for Ahmad Vahidi visiting the country, and announced that he would be leaving the country immediately.

He had issued an edict ordering everyone in the Empire (except Jews, who were exempted) to perform a sacrifice to the Roman gods and the well-being of the emperor. The sacrifices had to be performed in the presence of a Roman magistrate, and be confirmed by a signed and witnessed certificate from the magistrate. Although the text of the edict has been lost, many examples of the certificates have survived. Decius' edict was intended to act as an Empire-wide loyalty oath to the new emperor (who had come to power in 249 AD), sanctified through the Roman religion. There is no evidence that Decius sought to target Christianity specifically or initiate a persecution of its practitioners. Jews had been specifically exempted, demonstrating Decius' tolerance of other religions. Nevertheless, Christians were not similarly exempted, apparently because they were not considered to be a religion. Christian monotheistic beliefs did not allow them to worship any other gods, so they were forced to choose between their religious beliefs and following the law, the first time this had occurred. An unknown number of Christians were executed or died in prison for refusing to perform the sacrifices, including Pope Fabian. Others went into hiding, whilst many apostatized and performed the ceremonies. The effects on Christians were long-lasting: it caused tension between those who had performed the sacrifices (or fled) and those who had not, and left bitter memories of persecution.  Background  Decius became Roman emperor in 249 as a result of military victories. He made efforts to revive Rome's \\"Golden Age\\", adding the name of one of his most admired predecessors, Trajan, to his own, revived the ancient office of censor and restored the Colosseum. Restoration of traditional Roman piety was another of his aims, and after performing the annual sacrifice to Jupiter on January 3, 250, he issued an edict, the text of which is lost, ordering sacrifices to the gods to be made throughout the Empire. Jews were specifically exempted from this requirement. There is no evidence that this edict was intended to target Christians or that persecution of Christians was even thought of as one of the effects this decree would have; rather, it was seen as a way of unifying a vast Empire and as a sort of loyalty oath. Nevertheless, this was the first time that Christians had faced legislation forcing them to choose between abandoning their religious beliefs and death.  Requirements of the edict  Libellus from the Decian persecution 250 AD certifying that the holder has sacrificed to the Roman gods The edict ordered that everyone in the Empire, with the exception of Jews, must sacrifice and burn incense to the gods and to the well-being of the Emperor in the presence of a Roman magistrate, and get a written certificate, called a libellus, that this had been done, signed by the magistrate and witnesses. Numerous examples of these libelli survive from Egypt, for instance: > To the commission chosen to superintend the sacrifices. From Aurelia > Ammonous, daughter of Mystus, of the Moeris quarter, priestess of the god > Petesouchos, the great, the mighty, the immortal, and priestess of the gods > in the Moeris quarter. I have sacrificed to the gods all my life, and now > again, in accordance with the decree and in your presence, I have made > sacrifice, and poured a libation, and partaken of the sacred victims. I > request you to certify this below. There is nothing in these extant libelli about any necessity of denying being a Christian, in contrast to the letter the Roman provincial governor Pliny the Younger had written to the Emperor Trajan in 112, in which he reported that suspected Christians who cursed Christ were freed, an indication that targeting or persecuting Christians was not a goal of Decius' edict.  Exemption of the Jews  Julius Caesar had formulated a policy of allowing Jews to follow their traditional religious practices, a policy which was followed, and extended, by Augustus. This gave Judaism the status of a religio licita (permitted religion) throughout the Empire. Roman authorities respected tradition in religion and the Jews were following the beliefs and practices of their ancestors. It was well understood that Jews would not perform sacrifices to the Roman gods or burn incense before an image of the Emperor. In contrast, the Christians were a new phenomenon, and one that did not seem like a religion to Roman authorities at all; both the earliest extant Roman references to Christianity, Pliny the Younger and Tacitus in his Annals about 116, refer to Christianity as superstitio, excessive and non-traditional religiosity that was socially disruptive.wikisource:The_Annals_(Tacitus)/Book_15#44 Christians had abandoned the religion of their forefathers, and were seeking to convert others, which seemed dangerous to the Romans; refusal to sacrifice for the Emperor's well- being appeared seditious.  Effects of the edict on Christians  Christians were prohibited by their faith from worshipping the Roman gods or burning incense before an image of the Emperor. Refusal resulted in the deaths of some notable Christians, including Pope Fabian, Babylas of Antioch and Alexander of Jerusalem. It is not known how much of an effort was made by the authorities to check that everyone in the Empire had a libellus certifying that they had sacrificed but it is known that numerous Christians, including Cyprian, bishop of Carthage, went into hiding. The numbers of people put to death for refusing to obtain a certificate is unknown. Large numbers of Christians performed the sacrifices as required, so much so that authorities at Carthage were overwhelmed by the numbers seeking a certificate and were forced to issue a notice requesting people to come back the next day.  After the edict  The effects of the edict on Christian communities, many of which had until then lived peacefully and undisturbed, was traumatic. Many lapsed in their faith, and their readmission into the Christian community was opposed by the schismatic Novatian.Kirsch, Johann Peter. \\"Lapsi.\\" The Catholic Encyclopedia. Vol. 9. New York: Robert Appleton Company, 1910. 16 Jul. 2019 By 251, efforts to enforce the edict had died down, and although short-lived, the \\"Decian persecution\\" became in the collective memory of the church an episode of monstrous tyranny. Decius died in June 251, causing his edict to lapse; it had been in force for approximately eighteen months. Deliberate persecution of Christians within the empire began in 257 AD under emperor Valerian, and intensified in 303 AD during the Diocletianic Persecution.

Kintex was responsible for selling weapons to smugglers and terrorists, with both right wing and left wing political sympathies, in Turkey, in the 1970s.The Time Of The Assassins, Claire Sterling, New York City, Holt, Rinehart, Winston, 1985, pp. 84‚Äì86. Smuggler of contraband The first large export of weapons from Bulgaria was to Algeria in 1961‚Äì1962. Kintex maintained three bases in Sofia to load smuggled goods. These shipments were conveyed by sea to Turkey, travelling through the ports of Varna and Burgas. They were shipped aboard Bulgarian or foreign ships. Kintex realised an annual revenue from smuggling goods of between $5 million and $15 million. In the first years money was transported in suitcases. Following 1985 payments were made via transborder companies which were established by Bulgarian state security and the foreign trade ministry, usually in offshore zones.

Parian marble, ca. 470‚Äì460 BC. From Pharsalos, Thessaly. In the earliest times the Greeks wore their hair kome (long), and thus Homer constantly calls them karekomoontes. This ancient practice was preserved by the Spartans for many centuries. The Spartan boys always had their hair cut quite short (en chroi keirontes);Plut. Lyc. 16 but as soon as they reached the age of puberty, they let it grow long. They prided themselves upon their hair, calling it the cheapest of ornaments (kosmon adapanotatos), and before going to battle they combed and dressed it with especial care, in which act Leonidas and his followers were discovered by the Persian spy before the battle of Thermopylae.Herod, vii. 208, 209. It seems that both Spartan men and women tied their hair in a knot over the crown of the head.Comp. Aristoph. Lys. 1316, with Hor. Carm. ii. 11, in compium Lacenae more comas religata nodum. Miiller, Dor. iv. 3. ¬ß 1. At a later time the Spartans abandoned this ancient custom, and wore their hair short, and hence some writers erroneously attribute this practice to an earlier period.Pans. vii. 14. ¬ß 2; Philostr. Vit. Apoll. iii. 15. p. 106, ed. Olear.; Pint. Ale. 23. The custom of the Athenians was different. They wore their hair long in childhood, and cut it off when they reached the age of puberty. The cutting off of the hair, which was always done when a boy became an ephebus, was a solemn act, attended with religious ceremonies. A libation was first offered to Heracles, which was called oinisteria or oinesteria;Hesych. and Phot. s. v. and the hair after being cut off was dedicated to some deity, usually a river god.Aeschyl. Chotpli. 6; Paus. i. 37. ¬ß2. It was a very ancient practice to go to Delphi to perform this ceremony, and Theseus is said to have done so.Plut. Tlies. 5; Theophr. Char. 21. The ephebi are always represented on works of art with their hair quite short, in which manner it was also worn by the athletes.Lucian, Died. Mer. 5. When the Athenians passed into the age of manhood, they again let their hair grow. In ancient times at Athens the hair was rolled up into a kind of knot on the crown of the head, and fastened with golden clasps in the shape of grasshoppers. This fashion of wearing the hair, which was called krobylos, had gone out just before the time of Thucydides.Thucydides i. 6. The Athenian females also wore their hair in the same fashion, which was in their case called korymbos.See James Millingen (Peintures Antiques, plate 40). The word corymbium is used in a similar sense by Petronius. On vases, the heads of females were most frequently shown covered with a kind of band or a coif of net-work. Of these coiffures one was called kredemnos, which was a broad band across the forehead, sometimes made of metal, and sometimes of leather, adorned with gold; to this the name of stlengis was also given, and it appears to have been much the same as the ampyx. But the most common kind of head-dress for females was called by the general name of cecryphalus, and this was divided into the three species of cecryphalus, saccus, and mitra. The kekryphalos, in its narrower sense, was a caul or coif of net-work, corresponding to the Latin reticulum. It was worn during the day as well as the night, and has continued in use from the most ancient times to the present day. It is mentioned by Homer,II. xxii. 469 and is still worn in Italy and Spain. These hairnets were frequently made of gold threads,Juv. ii. 96; Petron. 67. sometimes of silk,Salmas. Eocerc. ad Solin. p. 3.92. or the Elean byssus,Paus. vii. 21. ¬ß 7. and probably of other materials, which are not mentioned by ancient writers. The persons who made these nets were called kekryphaloplokoi.Pollux, vii. 179. Females with this kind of head-dress frequently occur in paintings found at Pompeii, from one of which the preceding cut is taken, representing a woman wearing a Coa Vestis (Coan cloth).Museo Borlon. vol. viii. p. 5. The sakkos and the mitra were, on the contrary, made of close materials. The sakos covered the head entirely like a sack or bag; it was made of various materials, such as silk, byssus, and wool.Comp. Aristoph. Tltcsin. 257. Some times, at least among the Romans, a bladder was used to answer the same purpose.Mart. viii. 33. 19. The mitra was a broad band of cloth of different colours, which was wound round the hair, and was worn in various ways. It was originally an Eastern head-dress, and may, therefore, be compared to the modern turban. It is sometimes spoken of as characteristic of the Phrygians.Herod, i. 195, vii. 62; Virg. Aen. ix. 616, 617; Juv. iii. 66. It was, however, also worn by the Greeks, and Polygnotus is said to have been the first who painted Greek women with mitrae.Plin. //. N. xxxv. 9. s. 35. The Roman calantica or calvatica is said by Serviusad Virg, Aen. ix. 616. to have been the same as the mitra, but in a passage in the Digest34\\\\. tit. 2. s. 25. ¬ß 10. they are mentioned as if they were distinct. Regarding the Romans besides the generic coma we also find the following words signifying the hair: capillus, caesaries, crines, cincinnus and cirrus, the two last words being used to signify curled hair. In early times the Romans wore their hair long, as was represented in the oldest statues in the age of Varro,De lie Rust. ii. 11. ¬ß 10. and hence the Romans of the Augustan age designated their ancestors intonsiOv. Fast. ii. 30 and capillati.Juv. vi. 30. But after the introduction of barbers into Italy, it became the practice to wear their hair short. The women too originally dressed their hair with great simplicity, but in the Augustan period a variety of different head-dresses came into fashion, many of which are described by Ovid.de Art. Am. iii. 136, &c.; Sometimes these head-dresses were raised to a great height by rows of false curls.Juv. Sat. vi. 502. The dressing of the hair of a Roman lady at this period was a most important affair. So much attention did the Roman ladies devote to it, that they kept slaves especially for this purpose, called ornatrices, and had them instructed by a master in the art.Ov. de Art. Am. iii. 239; Suet. Claud. 40; Dig. 32. tit. 1. s. 65. Most of the Greek head-dresses mentioned above were also worn by the Roman ladies; but the mitrae appear to have been confined to prostitutes.Juv. iii. 66. One of the simplest modes of wearing the hair was allowing it to fall down in tresses behind, and only confining it by a band encircling the head. Another favourite plan was plaiting the hair, and then fastening it behind with a large pin. False hair or wigs were worn both by Greeks and Romans.See e.g. Juv. vi. 120. Among both peoples in ancient times the hair was cut close in mourning (funus); and among both the slaves had their hair cut close as a mark of servitude.Aristoph. Aves, 911; Plant.

Slightly older fossils from the Pliocene of eastern Africa were also proposed to belong to this species, but the most recent study consider them to belong to a somewhat more primitive species, Ceratotherium efficax.  Evolution  The phylogenetic position of C. mauritanicum is somewhat disputed. One model see it as to be located in a direct line of ancestry between the primitive Ceratotherium neumayri and the living white rhinoceros (Ceratotherium simum). Alternatively it was proposed to be the descendant of Ceratotherium efficax and an extinct sister taxon to C. simum. It retained primitive characters contemporaneously to the more progressive evolution of the genus Ceratotherium in eastern and southern Africa.  Distribution  C. mauritanicum was widely distributed across northwestern Africa during the Quaternary, and often associated with archaeological sites. Petroglyphs in northern Africa occasionally depict rhinoceri but often are too schematic to allow a distinction of the figured species. Those showing characters typical of the white rhinoceros may in fact represent C. mauritanicum instead of C. simum, which may have been very similar in external appearance in life. It vanished during the Mesolithic and currently there is no evidence that it eventually survived into the historical era.  Paleoecology  C. mauritanicum is supposed to have had an ecology very similar to the extant C. simum. It lived in open savannah landscapes with sufficient water and vegetation, a biome that has vanished from the Maghreb since the Early Holocene. Its food was probably dominated by grass.

Recent research suggests that this portrait, traditionally believed to be of Minamoto no Yoritomo, is instead likely to be his.Weapons & Fighting Techniques Of The Samurai Warrior 1200-1877 AD accessed on June 24, 2009The , also called Kann≈ç no juran, was a civil war which developed from antagonisms between sh≈çgun Ashikaga Takauji and his brother, Ashikaga Tadayoshi, thus dividing and weakening the early Ashikaga shogunate.Nussbaum, Louis-Fr√©d√©ric et al. (2005). Japan encyclopedia, p. 474. These events are labeled Kann≈ç after the Japanese era or neng≈ç which was proclaimed by the Northern Court during the years 1350 through 1351 in the Nanboku-ch≈ç period of Japanese history.Titsingh, Isaac. (1834). Annales des empereurs du japon, p. 298-302; n.b., the Kann≈ç era (1350-1351) comes after J≈çwa and before Bunna. One of the main effects of the Disturbance was the re-invigoration of the Southern Court's war effort due to the flow of renegades from Kyoto who followed Tadayoshi to the Southern capital of Yoshino, near Nara. Resurgence of the Southern Court The events The Imperial seats during the Kann≈ç disturbance were in relatively close proximity, but geographically distinct. They were: Takauji was nominally sh≈çgun but, having proved not to be up to the task of ruling the country, for more than ten years Tadayoshi governed in his stead.\\"Ashikaga-Tadayoshi\\" Encyclop√¶dia Britannica Online, accessed on August 11, 2009 The relationship between the two brothers was however destined to be destroyed by an extremely serious episode called the Kann≈ç Incident, an event which takes its name from the Kann≈ç era (1350‚Äì1351) during which it took place and which had grave consequences for the entire country. Trouble between the two started when Takauji made K≈ç no Moronao his shitsuji, or deputy. Tadayoshi did not like Moronao and his policies so (at least according to the Taiheiki), after every effort to get rid of him failed, he tried to have him assassinated.Papinot (1972:29) Tadayoshi in 1349 was forced by Moronao to leave the government, shave his head and become a Buddhist monk with the name Keishin under the guidance of Zen master, poet, and old associate Mus≈ç Soseki.Yasuda (1990:22)Ackroyd, Joyce. (1982) Lessons from History: The Tokushi Yoron, p.329. In 1350 he rebelled and joined his brother's enemies, the supporters of the Southern court, whose Emperor Go-Murakami appointed him general of all his troops. In 1351 he defeated Takauji, occupied Kyoto, and entered Kamakura. During the same year he captured and executed the K≈ç brothers, Moronao and Moroyasu, at Mikage (Settsu province). The following year his fortunes turned and he was defeated by Takauji at Sattayama. A reconciliation between the brothers proved to be brief. Tadayoshi fled to Kamakura, but Takauji pursued him there with an army. In March 1352, shortly after an ostensible second reconciliation, Tadayoshi died suddenly, according to the Taiheiki by poisoning. Their background The extremely divisive Kann≈ç Incident that divided the Muromachi regime put a temporary hold on the new shogunate's integration. Before the incident, the bureaucratic organs of the early regime were under the separate jurisdiction of the Ashikaga brothers Takauji and Tadayoshi, creating a bifurcated administration. Takauji was the leader of the house vassals, and thus controlled the Board of Retainers (the Samurai-dokoro) and the Office of Rewards (the Onsh≈ç-kata), while Tadayoshi was the bureaucratic leader controlling the Board of Inquiry's administration of the regime's judicial functions.Sato 1977:48; Grossberg 1981:21-24 The Board of Retainers was used as a disciplinary organ towards house vassals; brigandage and other crimes were prosecuted.Grossberg 1981:88,107 The Office of Rewards was used to hear the claims of and to give fiefs to deserving vassals. The Office of Rewards was used to enroll new warriors who were potential adversaries of the regime. The major judicial organ, the Board of Coadjutors, decided on all land dispute cases and quarrels involving inheritance.Grossberg 1981:88 All judicial functions are par excellence used to resolve conflicts and disputes legally, within an institutional framework. Bureaucrats (bugy≈çnin) for the new regime were recruited from the ranks of those who served the H≈çj≈ç regime before its fall.Grossberg 1981:90 They were valuable because they knew how to read and write, a task beyond the reach of most warriors. In the 1350s, the Kann≈ç Incident and its aftermath divided and nearly destroyed the early regime.Sansom 1961:78-95 On the surface the incident looks like a factional struggle pitting Ashikaga Tadayoshi, Takauji's brother, against the K≈ç brothers, Moronao and Moroyasu backed by Takauji.Wintersteen 1974:215; Arnesen 1979:53-54 The conflict can be pinpointed to differences in opinion regarding the estate system and, behind these differing opinions, to the different bureaucracies controlled by Takauji and Tadayoshi. On the whole Takauji was the innovator, while Tadayoshi played the conservative, wanting to preserve the policies of the past. In his capacity as a military leader of vassal bands, Takauji did two things that conflicted with Tadayoshi: he appointed vassals to shugo posts as a reward for battlefield heroics, and he divided the sh≈çen estates, giving half of them to his vassals in fief or as stewardships. Tadayoshi strenuously contested these policies through the drafting of the Kemmu Formulary that opposed the appointment of shugo as a reward for battlefield service. He also opposed any sort of outright division of estate lands in his capacity as the leader of the Board of Coadjutors.Grossberg 1981:23-4 There was therefore a clear division between the policies of Takauji and his brother Tadayoshi. Conflict can thus be said to have emerged as a result of having two heads of state whose policies contradicted each other. The events which followed the incident testify to the extent to which the regime began to lose its support. Deep divisions between members of the Ashikaga family strengthened the opposition. Both of the pillars of the Muromachi regime, Tadayoshi and Takauji, enacted token submissions to the Southern Court to push their own agendas: Tadayoshi in his desire to destroy the K≈ç brothers, and Takauji in his desire to defeat Tadayoshi. Ironically, even though the Southern Court was the enemy, it was used as the justification by regime members to attack each other. Effects One of the main effects of the Disturbance was the re- invigoration of the war effort of the Southern Court. To a large extent its renewed offensive was made possible by turncoats from the Muromachi regime. The imperialist offensive of 1352 directed against Takauji in Kamakura was made possible by the vast numbers of former adherents of Tadayoshi who became supporters of the imperialist leader Nitta Yoshimune. The imperialist offensive against Kyoto in 1353 was made possible through the defection of the shugo lord Yamana Tokiuji. Tadayoshi's adopted son Ashikaga Tadafuyu is an outstanding example of defection: he became the leader of the western armies of the Southern Court during the imperialist offensives against Kyoto in 1353 and 1354. The end of the Disturbance on the other hand eliminated the sharing of power between the two Ashikaga brothers putting it all into Takauji's hands, strengthening his position and ultimately that of the early Muromachi shogunate as a whole.

The original building was a one-story, 38-classroom school situated in the formerly small village of Good Luck, Maryland. The historic primary school serving the same community (the \\"Good Luck Schoolhouse\\" or \\"Glen Dale Colored School\\") was built in 1899, expanded in 1915 but abandoned circa 1935, and became a private residence in 1938.http://www.mncppcapps.org/planning/HistoricCommunitiesSurvey/Documentations/PG%2070-087%20Good%20Luck%20Schoolhouse/PG%2070-087%20Good%20Luck%20Schoolhouse%20MIHP.pdf In 1980, the village was split into the census-designated places of Goddard, Maryland and Glenn Dale, Maryland. Thus, the high school's first mailing address was simply; Glenn Dale and Telegraph Roads, Glenn Dale, MD. The current address is; 9880 Good Luck Road in the unincorporated town of Lanham, Maryland, 20706. The school name honors Gabriel Duvall (or DuVal) (1752‚Äì1844), whose family formerly owned a local slave plantation. The spelling of the name now conforms with that used by his descendants. DuVal held a number of public offices, including serving as the U.S. Representative from Maryland's second district from November 11, 1794, to March 28, 1796, Chief Justice of Maryland's General Court from 1796 to 1802, and U.S. Comptroller of the Treasury from 1802 through 1811. Duvall also served on the United States Supreme Court, as associate justice (replacing fellow Marylander Samuel Chase) from 1811 until 1835, when he resigned due to old age. In 2007, brand new Annex and Instrumental Music (Band and Orchestra) buildings were opened to students as an expansion to the school. DuVal is currently constructing a new Aerospace Building that will be placed next to the Cafeteria which is expected to be open in 2020. Academics DuVal High School offers a variety of academic programs and courses such as: Air Force JROTC, Art, Business Education, English, ESOL, Family and Consumer Sciences, Foreign Language, Health, Library Media Center, Mathematics, Vocal and Instrumental Music, Physical Education, Aerospace, Culinary Academy, Project Lead the Way, Science, Social Studies, Special Education and Technology Education. DuVal High School holds the vision that all students will be productive, ethical, and responsible citizens in the twenty-first century. The mission of DuVal High School is to create an environment where all students feel confident and competent to meet the challenges of a technological society. DuVal's goal is to create and maintain an environment that will encourage all students to reach their maximum educational potential. Microgravity Opportunities To Enhance Learning Microgravity Opportunities To Enhance Learning (MOTEL) program is a small, short-term project designed and built by DuVal High School students, located in Lanham, Maryland. The experiment sent live roaches into space in a NASA GAS Can (Get-Away Special) aboard the shuttle. On December 8, 1998 the roaches' habitat was separated from the GAS can. The roaches were put into the can on July 28. The program coordinators had no idea whether any of the roaches had survived. When the habitat was finally removed from the can, the students from DuVal peered inside to see if anything was alive. At least four adult roaches didn't survive. But two of the little roaches did survive. This program gained media attention from local TV stations and newspapers who were on hand to witness a memorable academic moment for the school. Project Lead the Way Project Lead the Way is a not-for-profit organization that promotes pre-engineering courses for middle and high school students. The ‚ÄúProject Lead the Way‚Äù high school pre-engineering program consists of six courses that expose students to a broad overview of the field of technology. On August 20, 2007 DuVal HS received a record $400 million in school construction funding in response to the ‚ÄúProject Lead the Way‚Äù program. When work was officially completed and the first day of school arrived for students Governor Martin O‚ÄôMalley and then Superintendent John Deasy toured the newly constructed wing of DuVal High School and talked to students in the ‚ÄúProject Lead the Way‚Äù program. The funds for DuVal High School provided a two-story wing, that houses classrooms for technical education, family consumer classes, computer labs, child-development programs, special education, science, art and general education.

Saul (born 1938) is a Canadian political economist and activist whose work has focused on the liberation struggles of southern Africa, from the 1960s to the present.See, inter alia, Saul, Revolutionary Traveller (op. cit.) In 2004, he was elected fellow of the Royal Society of Canada, in 2010 was granted an honorary doctorate by Victoria University within the University of Toronto, and, in 2011, a Lifetime Achievement Award by the Canadian Association of African Studies. Professional activities Saul is professor emeritus of politics at York University in Toronto. He has also taught at the University of Dar es Salaam in Tanzania, alongside activist-academics such as Giovanni Arrighi (with whom he wrote Essays on the Political Economy of Africa) and Walter Rodney; at the University of Eduardo Mondlane in Maputo, Mozambique, alongside activist-academics such as Ruth First; and at the University of the Witwatersrand, Johannesburg in South Africa. From the 1970s to the 1990s, Saul was involved with the Toronto Committee for the Liberation of Portugal's African Colonies (TCLPAC), later the Toronto Committee for the Liberation of Southern Africa (TCLSAC), which coordinated the liberation support/anti-apartheid movement in Toronto. He was also an editor of both the Canadian progressive magazine This Magazine (1973‚Äì1985) and Southern Africa Report (1985‚Äì2000).Southern Africa Report Archive Commentary Saul is a socialist, and is considered to be an activist-academic in the broader Marxist tradition. As Leo Panitch, long-time editor of the prestigious Socialist Register, has recently written: > Based on his almost half century of immense political and intellectual > contributions to African liberation struggles, John Saul shows [in his > recent writings] that he is one of the few today who has the courage as well > as the credentials to pose the sober question of \\"what did 'liberation' mean > anyway\\"? What is more Saul also shows that he is one of the few with the > confidence as well as the capacity to answer the question by drawing > inspirational and strategic socialist and revolutionary conclusions. The well-known author (and for many years co-editor with Panitch of Socialist Register) Colin Leys adds: \\"John Saul's reflections on the struggles for liberation to which he had devoted a lifetime of scholarship and activism...the wise lessons he draws, and his resolute refusal to be pessimistic in spite of all setbacks...should be not just read but taken to heart by everyone who cares about the future of Africa and the world.\\"As quoted, as cover copy, in Saul, Liberation Lite (op. cit.) As highly regarded Canadian journalist Rick Salutin further noted, in a column written on the occasion of Saul's retirement from York University in Toronto in 2004, \\"Saul's writings are all about instilling hope and learning from failure...He is a sort of underground alternate Canadian tradition to the internationalism of Lester Pearson, more like the tradition of Norman Bethune and Chris Giannou,\\"The (Toronto) Globe and Mail (October 15, 2004) Similarly, Jorge Rebelo, poet, long-time Frelimo (Mozambique) militant, and cabinet minister in the first government of a liberated Mozambique, writes that \\"Saul's greatest contribution has been sharing ideas, criticizing and giving advice - reminding us that we should base our ideology on the concrete realities of our country and people, not on ready-made manuals...that we should always ensure the participation of the people in decision-making, and make socialism not just a slogan but a real objective.\\" Letter from Rebelo to be read at Saul's retirement ceremony from York University in 2004, as quoted in Salutin and the frontispiece to Decolonization and Empire (op. cit.)

Three students from Tamil Nadu Agricultural University, Coimbatore (TNAU) were burned to death in a bus by AIADMK cadres after the conviction of Jayalaitha by a special court for the Kodaikanal Pleasant Stay Hotel case. The three men belonging to the All India Anna Dravida Munnetra Kazhagam (AIADMK)‚ÄîMuniappan, Nedunchezhian, and Ravindran‚Äîwere sentenced to death, and their sentences were initially upheld by the Supreme Court of India. Their sentences were later commuted to life imprisonment, however, by a three-member bench headed by Justice Ranjan Gogoi after a review petition. The Salem District Court had said that the crime was committed \\"only for the political career\\". Although defense lawyer L. Nageswara Rao admitted that the three culprits took petrol from a workshop, set fire to the bus and killed the students, they were \\"in a state of mob frenzy\\" and his defense was based on diminished responsibility. The Edappadi K. Palaniswami government advocated their release; the governor Banwarilal Purohit returned their files to the state government for reconsideration of their premature release and the three men all members of the ruling AIADMK were released from the Vellore Central Prison on November 2018.  Background  Soon after coming to power in Tamil Nadu in 1996, the Dravida Munnetra Kazhagam (DMK) party filed a series of corruption cases against former chief minister and AIADMK general secretary Jayalalithaa and other ministers and bureaucrats in her government. In the Pleasant Stay hotel case, a special- court ruling by Justice V. Radhakrishnan convicted Jayalalithaa and sentenced her to one year of \\"rigorous imprisonment\\". The ruling led to statewide protests and violence, including damage to public property by AIADMK members. Protests in Elakiyampatti, Dharmapuri were led by AIADMK Dharmapuri Union Secretary D. K. Rajendran and other AIADMK party workers, including former Dharmapuri secretary Nedu (Nedunchezhiyan), MGR Forum functionary Madhu (Ravindran), and former panchayat president P. Muniappan.  Burning  Seventy students from Tamil Nadu Agricultural University, returning from a study tour, were separated by gender on two buses. During their trip, they learned about Jayalalithaa's conviction in the Pleasant Stay hotel case. Latha (a lecturer accompanying the students) called TNAU's vice-chancellor, who recommended that they go to a safe place and return to Coimbatore when it was safer. They tried to drive to the district collector's office, but were unable to reach it due to traffic obstruction by renegade AIADMK members led by Dharmapuri union secretary D. K. Rajendran. The party workers threw petrol bombs into the bus containing 44 female students and two lecturers. The front of the bus caught fire, and the flames spread backward. Since the bus's back door was locked and the keys were unavailable, lecturers Latha, Akila, and several students left the other bus and broke through the back door to pull out the students. Three female students (Hemalatha from Chennai, V. Gayathri from Virudhachalam and Kokilavani from Namakkal) were burned to death, and 16 others were injured. The bus burning was broadcast the following day on Sun TV.  Aftermath  By 6 November 2001, all eleven witnesses had become hostile during cross-examination in Krishnagiri. The witnesses included three Tamil Nadu State Transport Corporation drivers and people working in, or owning, establishments near the incident location. Drivers Saleem Basha of the Coimbatore-Hosur bus and Kamaraj recanted initial statements made to the CB- CID that they could identify the persons involved; they drove buses which were damaged that day in Erapatti and near the Patchaiamman temple, respectively. The burning angered the student community. Schools and colleges were asked to close for a week, and students statewide held silent protest marches condemning the act. Chief Minister M. Karunanidhi ordered a CB-CID investigation, and Jayalalithaa demanded a CBI probe to ensure a fair trial. During the initial trial at Krishnagiri Court, 20 witnesses became hostile. N. P. Veerasamy, Kokilavani's father, appealed to the Madras High Court for a change of venue; AIADMK had returned to power in Tamil Nadu, the case prosecutor was appointed by the party, and the accused were AIADMK functionaries and party activists. The high court halted the trial; Judge V. Kanagaraj called it a \\"colossal failure and eyewash\\", and ordered a retrial at Salem Court. After a series of delays in appointing a special public prosecutor and problems with missing case bundles, the trial progressed. Seven years after the burning, on 15 February 2007, the Salem court sentenced three AIADMK members to death and 25 others to seven years' imprisonment. Two others were acquitted, and one died during the investigation. The judgment (including the three capital sentences) was upheld by Madras High Court on 6 December 2007, and the Supreme Court on 30 August 2010. However, the sentences were commuted to life imprisonment after defence lawyers L. Nageswara Rao and Sushil Kumar said that the AIADMK mob only aimed to damage buses, not kill; they had acted impulsively. The Supreme Court of India then accepted their argument of diminished responsibility. It was learned that Dharmapuri AIADMK leader D. K. Rajendran, the first suspect in the case which organized the road protest (with a seven-year conviction which was reduced to two years), held four positions in a cooperative milk society become known. Rajendran later resigned after the Madras High Court expressed \\"deep anguish and displeasure\\" that a convict could hold positions despite being disqualified. A granite memorial with the names of the three victims was built at the Tamil Nadu Agricultural University hostel; all were 20 years old at the time of their deaths. The AIADMK-ruled Tamil Nadu government attempted to release the three suspects in the bus burning. According to prison sources, at least 1,500 prisoners would benefit from the government's general amnesty, which included the three accused and was seen as a tactical move by the party. On 19 November 2018, the AIADMK members convicted in the bus burning were released.  Case timeline  :On 2 February, AIADMK chief Jayalalithaa was sentenced by a special court to a one-year imprisonment for her role in the Kodaikanal Pleasant Stay hotel case. AIADMK protesters set fire to the Tamil Nadu Agricultural University bus. Three students were burned to death, and 16 others were injured. Tamil Nadu Chief Minister M. Karunanidhi ordered a CB-CID investigation, and Jayalalithaa insisted on a CBI probe. On 3 February, three AIADMK members and 25 others were convicted. :Up to 20 witnesses turned hostile before the trial in Krishnagiri, and the Madras High Court transferred the case to Salem District Court. Missing case files and the appointment of a special prosecutor delayed the trial. :The Salem court sentenced the three AIADMK men to death on 16 February, a verdict upheld by the Madras High Court on 6 December. :On 30 August, the Supreme Court upheld the Madras High Court ruling. :On 4 March, the three convicts filed a review petition in the Supreme Court seeking to commute their death sentences. Seven days later, the court commuted their sentences to life imprisonment. :The Tamil Nadu government issued an orders to release over 1,600 long-time prisoners, including the Dharmapuri bus-burning convicts, on 1 February to mark the birth centenary of former Chief Minister M. G. Ramachandran (MGR). In October, the governor rejected the recommendation to release the three convicts. The following month, however, the Tamil Nadu government reiterated its recommendation to release the trio; the governor approved the recommendation this time, and they were released from Vellore Central Prison on 19 November.  In popular culture  The Tamil language film Kalloori was released in December 2007, days before the Madras High Court upheld the Salem court judgment. The film's climax was the bus-burning incident and, after public and media demands, its ending was changed.  References  External links *Supreme Court of India C.

Beth Am is an urban, egalitarian congregation affiliated with the United Synagogue of Conservative Judaism, and it is known for balancing traditional prayer and learning with innovative and intellectual critique. History The building currently known as \\"Beth Am\\" was first founded as Chizuk Amuno Congregation, which has since moved to a new suburban location in Pikesville, Maryland. Chizuk Amuno first occupied the building in 1922 and moved to Pikesville in 1958. Following the move of Chizuk Amuno, services continued in the building, led by Cantor Abba Weisgall. Then, in 1974, the current Beth Am congregation was founded as Dr. Louis Kaplan's shul. Kaplan's wife suggested the name, which translates to \\"House of the People\\". Leadership Kaplan served informally as the congregation's spiritual leader until 1981, when the congregation hired its first full-time rabbi.

He is the only person who participated in both the Journey of Reconciliation (1947) and the first Freedom Ride of 1961, and has been called a white civil rights hero. Peck advocated nonviolent civil disobedience throughout his life, and was arrested more than 60 times between the 1930s and 1980s. Biography Early life James Peck (usually called \\"Jim\\") was born in Manhattan, the son of Samuel Peck, a wealthy clothing wholesaler, who died when his son was eleven years old. He attended Choate Rosemary Hall, a private boarding school in Wallingford, Connecticut. Even though Peck and his family had converted from Judaism to the Episcopalian Church, Peck was still considered a social outsider at Choate. Peck preferred the fellowship of scholarly intellectuals and in their company he developed a reputation as an independent thinker and at the same time adopted idealistic political doctrines. He enrolled and studied at Harvard in 1933. While studying at Harvard, Peck polished his skills as a writer and engaged in radical acts that ended up shocking his classmates and forcing him to become the outsider once again. Peck wrote that his mother \\"referred to Negroes as 'coons'\\" and he chose to defy her and his classmates by asking a black girl to be his date at the Freshman dance. He dropped out of school at the end of his freshman year when \\"his alienation from his family and the American establishment was complete\\". Peck was married to the former Paula Zweier for twenty-two years. She was a teacher of cooking and author of The Art of Fine Baking (1961) and Art of Good Cooking (1966).Ephron, Nora, \\"Critics in the World of the Rising Souffle\\", New York Magazine, September 30, 1968Bittman, Mark, \\"THE MINIMALIST; Pudding For Purists, The New York Times, December 8, 2004Peck, Paula. The Art of Fine Baking, New York : Simon and Schuster, 1961.Peck, Paula. Art of Good Cooking, New York : Simon and Schuster, 1966 Paula Peck died in 1972. They had two sons, Charles and Samuel. Peck was critical of both U.S. political parties throughout his life, but leaned toward a radical form of democratic-socialism. He thought a Utopian world was impossible, and that there would always be a battle between what he called the \\"Upperdogs\\" and \\"Underdogs.\\" He considered himself on the side of the underdogs. Peck was a member of numerous antiwar and civil rights organizations, and spent his life as a radical journalist. He assisted the War Resisters League, and eventually became editor of WRL News until the 1980s. He also edited the Worker's Defense League News Bulletin. In the 1930s he wrote a labor column for a paper conducted by WRL, The Conscientious Objector. Beginning in 1938, he worked at Federated Press and reported on union activism and joined the American Newspaper Guild. Peck worked as editor of the CORE-lator from the 1940s-1960s for CORE. Beginning in 1967, Peck became news editor of WIN magazine, a youth antiwar magazine. At times he wrote articles in numerous pacifist publications, such as Liberation magazine. Labor Movement 1930s Peck's first protest was in New York City (NYC) at an anti-Nazi rally in 1934, and his second protest was at the NYC 1934 May Day parade. Peck was hired as a deck boy in 1935, and he joined in a work strike on a boat for better food during his first voyage. In September 1935, Peck was on a boat that anchored in Pensacola, Florida, where Peck joined the longshoremen who were on strike. Peck claimed the union hall was fully integrated at the time by the striking longshoremen. Peck remained there for two weeks before police arrested him for distributing rank-and-file literature on a boat, marking his first arrest. In the labor movement in the 1930s he helped found what later became the National Maritime Union. Joseph Curran led a strike aboard a ship in March 1936, anchored in NYC. Peck picketed with the longshoremen for the first time on March 22, 1936. He then picketed again from November 1936 to January 1937. Curran led the fight against Joe Ryan. This led to the formation of the NMU, the strongest east coast longshoremen union. Peck would later criticize Joseph Curran's transformation once in power of the NMU. On May 11, 1936, Peck was arrested for the second time in his life. Police clashed with striking seamen that day, with Peck being beaten and arrested. This marked Peck's first mass arrest, as one of 221 strikers arrested that day. That night they were arraigned, making it the largest group every arraigned at the same time in that courtroom.James Peck\\" , Library of America, Reporting Civil Rights. WWII Resistance During World War II he was a conscientious objector and an anti-war activist, and consequently spent three years in jail at Danbury Correctional Institution in Connecticut (1942‚Äì1945). While in prison, he helped start a work strike that eventually led to the desegregation of the mess hall. Also during this time, he participated, as did many other conscientious objectors, in medical experiments, especially a yellow jaundice experiment which permanently damaged his liver. Peck viewed it as volunteering to help discover a cure for the disease and for humanity.Bennett, Scott H., Radical pacifism : the War Resisters League and Gandhian nonviolence in America, 1915-1963, Syracuse, N.Y. : Syracuse University Press, 2003. . Cf. pp.86, specifically, and various on Jim Peck. WW-II Amnesty Movement Peck was released from Danbury prison in 1945, and immediately joined protests to grant amnesty to WWII conscientious objectors (COs). Peck worked with the Amnesty Committee in organizing protests and writing press releases. Peck took part in the first amnesty protest at the White House on October 15, 1945. Peck picketed outside Danbury Prison on February 12, 1946, demanding amnesty, while prisoners were on strike inside. On May 11, 1946, Peck joined the largest amnesty protest until then of 100 people at the White House, while CO prisoners carried out hunger strikes. On December 22, 1946, Peck was one of 15 activists outside the White House, who managed to get press attention because they all wore black- and-white prison outfits to represent WWII COs remaining in prison. Peck attended another theatrical amnesty rally in June 1947. A small group staged a \\"mock funeral\\" in front of the White House. Pallbearers dressed in formal attire and carried a coffin marked \\"justice.\\" Peck joined 40 amnesty demonstrators on September 25, 1947, at the NYC station for the \\"Freedom Train\\" - a patriotic train filled with U.S. declarations and documents that ran through 48 states in two years beginning in 1947. Demonstrators once again wore prison outfits, which gained the attention of thousands of bystanders and reporters at the station. Police ordered them to move, but 19 activists, including Peck, refused to move and were arrested.\\"Conscientious Objection Demonstrators Clash With Police Near Freedom Train,\\" New York Times, September 26, 1947. Those arrested won in court, and years later the police chief was ordered to issue a public apology. Peck once again joined 15 activists outside the White House on Christmas Day, 1947, two days after President Truman granted amnesty on solely religious grounds to 1,523 COs out of more than 15,000. This meant Peck's sentence was not removed from his record.\\"Pickets Wear Prison Garb In Draft Pardons Protest,\\" Washington Post, Dec. 26, 1947. Peck wrote in a letter to the editor in the New York Times in January 1948, stating 16 other countries granted amnesty to all WWII COs, and the refusal to do so by the U.S. \\"seriously belies our professions of democracy.\\"Jim Peck, New York Times January 26, 1948. WWII Amnesty protests continued into the 1950s, but without successfully changing any laws. On December 10, 1955, Peck led a picket of 40 people wearing his Uncle Sam outfit, demanding a Christmas amnesty. Anti-draft 1940s Peck and a small handful of WWII COs led the protests against the military draft in the 1940s. Peck was among nine activists arrested on March 25, 1946, for picketing outside a D.C. hotel that hosted a dinner for U.N. Security Council delegates. Peck handed out literature encouraging people not to sign up for military service. In 1947, President Truman introduced a peacetime draft in Congress, which Peck protested. Peck worked with Bayard Rustin and A.J. Muste to organize a nationwide protest against the draft on February 12, 1947. More than 500 demonstrators burnt their draft cards in more than 30 states. Peck led the most popular action that day, when 15 people burned their draft cards at the White House without any arrests. Peck worked with A. Philip Randolph, a black union leader, after President Truman proposed the Universal Military Training Act (UMT), which continued segregation in the military. In April 1948, the WRL assigned Peck to head the Committee on Publicity, which was tasked with printing letters of support for Randolph's call of nonviolent resistance to the draft. The peacetime draft passed on June 19, 1948, but continued protests by Randolph and pacifists led to Truman passing Executive Order 9981, which abolished segregation in the military. This brought an end to Peck working with Randolph. On June 5, 1948, Peck joined 75 demonstrators in a creative picket outside the White House against UMT. Peck and seven other demonstrators wore red, white and blue Uncle Sam outfits, as they goose-stepped in circles. After the passage of UMT, Peck took on an individual protest at the White House on June 22, 1948. Peck entered the White House in a public tour and quickly chained himself to a banister, and then removed his jacket to reveal a shirt with the hand-painted slogan: \\"Veto the Draft.\\" This became one of his most famous protests at the time, and it garnered the attention of most news stations. He was interrogated as being a Communist after being removed, but was let go without charges. Protests broke out in several cities on August 30, 1948, the first day to register for the peacetime draft. Peck joined Bayard Rustin at a rally in NYC without arrests. Peck and Rustin were arrested, however, on September 3, 1948, at an anti-draft picket in NYC. Both Peck and Rustin received 15 days in Rikers Island, after the judge yelled racial slurs at Rustin. Peck protested outside a NYC courthouse on October 15, 1948, in support of Stuart Perkoff, who was the first person in NYC to defy the Selective Service Act. But two weeks later Perkoff changed his mind, fearing a long sentence. Peck supported the World Citizens Movement headed by Garry Davis, who objected to conscription and war. WWII COs supported Davis when he was in court in France in October 1949. October 4 was announced as an international pacifist day of solidarity, and Peck was one of a dozen activists arrested for protesting at the French embassy in D.C. On April 29, 1950, Peck was assaulted by two American Legion members at the third annual Loyalty Day Parade in NYC, for passing out pacifist literature. He did not press charges. On July 7, 1950, Peck traveled to the U.N. Assembly at Lake Success, where it was discussed if the U.S. should enter the Korean War. Peck and three other pacifists passed out literature against the war, and Peck made it into the building without being noticed. Peck found himself at the delegates entrance door, and entered when the meeting began. He passed out his literature to most delegates before security realized what he was doing. Peck was carried out of the room by security, which gained the attention of most newspapers, and he was released without charges. Anti-Nuclear Movement In 1946, Peck was arrested in New York City for being involved in the \\"first nonviolent direct action against nuclear tests.\\" On July 24, 1946, Peck and 35 demonstrators pulled around a stuffed goat rented from a taxidermist in New York City, representing the actual goats left on the Marshall Islands, where the U.S. conducted the Bikini atom bomb experiment that day. Peck was arrested that day and received a $10 fine. A few weeks later Peck and a similar size group marched from the Pentagon down Pennsylvania Avenue, and were arrested for marching without a permit. Peck and a small group of pacifists protested at the NYC Easter Parade on May 27, 1947, passing out antinuclear literature. Peck and nine other activists were arrested while marching along the side of the parade. Peck refused to pay the $10 fine, and served 15 days in Rikers Island. Peck also marched in the Easter Parade against nuclear weapons on April 17, 1949, along with eight other activists. Police ordered the group to disperse, but Peck and Mat Kauten refused, and were both arrested. Peck was carried to the police squad by four cops, and his arrest landed in the New York Times. Peck served five days in jail. Peck was arrested again at the Easter Parade with three other people in 1952. In April 1950, Peck joined the peace vigil at the Maryland AEC to protest the hydrogen bomb. Peck was briefly arrested for passing out literature in NYC during an air raid drill on September 25, 1953, but was released with no charges. In 1955 and 1956, he was arrested for refusing to take cover during the simulated air raid drills in NYC, which were brought to an end in the early 1960s due to massive civil disobedience. On June 15, 1955, Peck was one of 28 people arrested for standing in New York City Hall Park during the first major protest against the nationwide air raid drills.Jim Peck, Underdogs Vs. Upperdogs,1969. Peck was arrested with other pacifists such as A.J. Muste, Bayard Rustin and Ralph DiGia, as well as Catholic Worker members Dorothy Day and Ammon Hennacy. Peck was arrested again with 17 other people in Washington Square Park on July 20, 1956, during the second major protest against the air raid drills. He was arrested again with Dorothy Day and Ammon Hennacy, but was also joined by George Willoughby and Quaker Robert Gilmore, who later became a leader for the anti-nuclear organization SANE. In May 1960, Peck refused to take shelter during the NYC air raid drill along with 500 other persons, marking the largest act of civil disobedience against the program. In 1957, Peck was one of the founding members of the new organization Non-Violent Action Against Nuclear Weapons, one of the leading antinuclear groups at that time. Peck was arrested with ten others at the organization's first event on August 6, 1957, for performing civil disobedience at the nuclear test site in Nevada. Beginning in 1958, Peck took part in the large \\"Walk for Peace\\" campaigns conducted internationally, and became involved in the \\"Golden Rule\\" campaign. The \\"Golden Rule\\" was a 30-foot ketch that set sail into the nuclear testing sites in the Pacific Ocean as an act of protest. Peck was not part of the initial crew, but he did participate in a week-long fast inside an AEC building with roughly a dozen other persons in support of the Golden Rule. In June, however, Peck filled an open spot on the \\"Golden Rule,\\" and was arrested with the crew six miles off the shore of Honolulu. The entire crew served 60 days in jail. Peck became one of the most famous antinuclear activists in the country following the \\"Golden Rule\\" campaign, and he traveled to the Geneva Conference that fall to advocate for a mutual test ban treaty between the US and Soviet Union. On June 18, 1960, when Peck was picketing nuclear bases in New London, he was attacked by a mob of workers who destroyed his placard. When the Soviet Union resumed nuclear tests in August 1961, Peck was part of a delegation that delivered a peace statement to the Soviet embassy. Peck returned to the Soviet embassy on October 28 with 2,000 demonstrators, and he was once again part of the delegation that delivered the peace declaration. In 1962, Peck was directly involved in the growing antinuclear movement. On January 30, he and 200 other persons demonstrated outside an AEC building in New York. On March 3, Peck was one of 42 demonstrators arrested near Times Square, after police violently attacked nonviolent anti-nuclear activists. On April 21, Peck was involved in the massive Easter protest of 5,000 demonstrators in NYC, and was quoted in the \\"New York Times\\" the next day about the need for direct action. On May 10, more than 600 persons protested nuclear tests at the UN in NYC, and Peck led one of the delegations to the British embassy, where he performed a sit-down. In October, Peck joined over 10,000 demonstrators in protesting against nuclear war in NYC, which was the largest antinuclear rally up until then. Then on Easter in 1963, Peck was a guest speaker for the rally in Detroit that gathered over a thousand demonstrators. When the Test-Ban Treaty was signed by the U.S. and U.S.S.R in 1963, Peck claimed the credit was due to the nonviolent direct actions over the past decade. Throughout the antinuclear campaign, Peck opposed the use of nuclear weapons by all nations, and he chanted the popular pacifist slogan: \\"No Tests ‚Äì East or West.\\" In October 1964, when China conducted its first nuclear test, Peck took part in the first American protest against China's use of nuclear weapons. After the signing of the Test-Ban Treaty, however, the antinuclear movement was overshadowed by the antiwar movement, and didn't gain momentum again until the 1970s. Civil Rights Movement: 1940s-1950s After the war he became a \\"radical journalist\\", and joined the Congress of Racial Equality (CORE) in 1946, where he worked as the publicity officer, and later as the editor for the \\"CORE-lator.\\" Peck worked for CORE, one of the main civil rights organizations in the north during the 1960s, from 1947‚Äì1965, before he was removed when the organization ousted white leaders. Throughout the 1950s CORE was a tiny organization with only a handful of members, providing Peck the opportunity to take a leading role in the organization as the head editor, until CORE grew dramatically in the 1960s. Peck was arrested with Bayard Rustin in Durham, North Carolina, during the Journey of Reconciliation in April 1947, which was an interstate integrated bus journey through the South, and acted as a precursor to the later Freedom Rides of 1961. In Chapel Hill, North Carolina, during the Journey, Peck was attacked by an angry white mob, with one mob member punching him in the side of the head, but Peck remained nonviolent and safely walked away. Peck was arrested a second time during the Journey for sitting in an integrated fashion on the bus in Asheville, North Carolina. In the summer of 1947, Peck was beaten and arrested two times during a CORE campaign that aimed to integrate Palisades Park in New Jersey, which directly led to the passage of the New Jersey 1949 Freeman Bill. He was first arrested with six other people on August 3, 1947, for picketing in front of the pool ticket booth.New York Times, August 4, 1947. Then on August 31, 1947, Peck was one of 28 people were arrested outside Palisades Park, and he claimed a police officer knocked him unconscious.New York Times, September 1, 1947. Throughout the 1950s Peck endorsed Martin Luther King Jr.'s Montgomery Campaign, while debating Roy Wilkins of the NAACP about how direct action was just as critically needed as legal procedures in winning civil rights. During the southern sit-in movement in 1960, Peck and other CORE members performed weekly pickets outside Woolworth stores for 15 months straight in NYC. Peck was also the leading civil rights activist in the \\"Proxies Campaign,\\" a method where Peck protested segregated businesses stockholder meetings. From 1948‚Äì1955, Peck attended the stockholder meetings for Greyhound Company, usually holding one share of stock in the company or representing others who held stock. He was joined by Bayard Rustin a few times, and CORE members protested outside the building during the meetings. From the floor Peck argued that the company should enforce integration in the south.Derek Catsam, Freedom's Main Line: The Journey of Reconciliation and the Freedom Rides, 2009. Similarly, he attended Grant's 1954 stockholder meeting, where he successfully convinced business owners to desegregate their chains in Baltimore, Maryland. In 1960, Peck used this same formula to protest the stockholder meetings for Woolworth's, Grant's and Kress, as well as protesting McCrory's meeting in April 1961. The Proxies Campaign was later popularized by Saul Alinsky, although he didn't perform such actions until the late-1960s.Saul Alinsky, Rules for Radicals: A Pragmatic Primer for Realistic Radicals,1971. Freedom Ride & Civil Rights: 1960s-1970s Peck and 15 other volunteers traveled South in 1961 in the famous Freedom Rides. Peck was arrested on May 10 in Winnsboro, South Carolina, for sitting in an integrated fashion at a lunch counter. On May 14, Peck was on the second Trailways bus leaving Atlanta, Georgia for Birmingham, Alabama. The first bus, a Greyhound, left an hour earlier and was burned in a firebombing in Anniston, Alabama, seriously injuring the passengers. An hour later the Trailways bus pulled in at the terminal in Anniston and eight Klansmen boarded and assaulted the Freedom Riders. Peck, a frail, middle-aged man at the time, was severely injured in the beating and required fifty stitches. Later, in Birmingham, Peck and Charles Person (a black student from Atlanta) were the first to descend from the bus, into a crowd of Klansmen who, with the organizational help of Birmingham Public Safety Commissioner Bull Connor, were waiting for the Freedom Riders. Howard K. Smith, reporting on-the-scene for CBS, described the ensuing violence on the radio, in words cited by John Lewis in his autobiography, Walking with the Wind: \\"Toughs grabbed the passengers into alleys and corridors, pounding them with pipes, with key rings, and with fists. One passenger was knocked down at my feet by twelve of the hoodlums, and his face was beaten and kicked until it was a bloody pulp.\\" Lewis adds, \\"That was Jim Peck's face.\\" Peck was severely beaten and needed 53 stitches to his head.https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=_8ksAAAAIBAJ&sjid;=fhMEAAAAIBAJ&pg;=6956,6893063&dq;=james- peck+civil+rights&hl;=en According to Raymond Arsenault, this was actually a misidentification; the man beaten, he says, was George Webb, a bystander. Peck was taken to Carraway Methodist Medical Center, a segregated hospital, which refused to treat him; he was later treated at Jefferson Hillman Hospital. The Freedom Ride was Peck's most famous action, resulting in him gaining popularity as a white civil rights hero. He traveled around the nation representing CORE in speeches, and gained even more attention for the Movement on June 5, when he confronted former President Truman about his recent remarks denouncing the Freedom Riders, making Truman seem behind the times in racial justice. At Peck's suggestion, a Route 40 Freedom Ride project was launched by CORE in December 1961, resulting in half the restaurants desegregating along Route 40 in Baltimore. Peck was arrested along with 14 others after attempting to integrate a restaurant. In May 1962, after he published his famous book \\"Freedom Ride,\\" Peck was one of the main leaders for the Project Baltimore campaign, which led to more restaurants desegregating. That summer, Peck was one of the leaders for the Freedom Highways campaign, which sought to integrate highway restaurants in North Carolina. Following the Freedom Rides, Peck became good friends with William Lewis Moore, a white civil rights worker who became a martyr for the movement after he was shot and killed in the south during his solo Freedom March in the spring of 1963. When Moore was killed, Peck delivered the eulogy at his funeral, and then gave the opening speech on May 19, when several dozen activists continued the march from where Moore was shot down. After the walkers were arrested and taken to jail, Peck and others marched to the jail singing Freedom songs. On August 2, 1963, Peck was one of 30 people arrested for performing a sit-down in the street, while protesting the discriminatory state policies for the construction of the Downstate Medical Center in Brooklyn. On October 20, Peck spoke about the racist policies in front of 700 demonstrators at a NYC rally. On August 28, 1963, Peck proudly represented CORE at the March on Washington for Jobs and Freedom, which over 250,000 persons attended. On December 7, Peck traveled to the newest Levittown in Bowie, Maryland, to picket the discriminatory housing policies. On April 22, 1964, Peck was one of the leaders for CORE's campaign at the opening day of New York's World Fair, protesting the discriminatory policies held by most companies sponsoring the Fair. More than 300 demonstrators were arrested on the Fair's opening day, including Peck, CORE leader James Farmer, Bayard Rustin and Michael Harrington.Fred Powledge, \\"CORE Chief Among Scores Arrested on Grounds,\\" New York Times,April 23, 1964. In March 1965, Peck represented CORE at the historic march from Selma to Montgomery, concluding with 50,000 demonstrators entering Montgomery on March 25. Peck even had the honor to speak as a CORE representative that day, honoring William Moore in his speech. When Peck returned home after the march, he was removed from CORE, after working there for 17 years, because he was white.[16] Peck denounced the decision as \\"reverse-racism,\\" and never accepted the slogan of Black Power. After he was removed from CORE, Peck personally funded King's campaigns, especially his 1968 Poor People's Campaign. A year after being removed from CORE, Peck took part in the March Against Fear in June 1966. During this campaign the slogan Black Power arose, which Peck bitterly denounced. At a concert held one night during the march, Peck wrote King a letter, stating: > I wanted to assure you that, despite the dirty deal I have received from > CORE, I am still with The Movement and shall be as long as I live. When King was assassinated in April 1968, Peck honored him by traveling to Memphis on April 8 to join 40,000 other demonstrators in marching in support of the Memphis Sanitation strike that King had supported prior to his death. After the Memphis March, Peck traveled to Atlanta for King's funeral, which concluded with 50,000 demonstrators marching over four miles. In May 1969, Peck joined Coretta King and Ralph Abernathy in Charleston, South Carolina, to support black nurses on strike.Jim Peck, \\"The Charleston Strike,\\" WIN magazine no. 13 Vol. 5 (July 1969): 27. Peck continued civil rights activism into the 1970s. On March 8, 1975, he joined 3,000 people in Selma, Alabama, to commemorate the ten-year anniversary of Bloody Sunday. Peck also joined the controversial school bus integration protests. On December 14, 1974, Peck joined 20,000 people marching to the Boston Common to end the racist attacks on school busing. Peck returned to Boston on in May 1975, when he joined 15,000 people in a large NAACP march. On April 15, 1978, Peck joined 10,000 people in D.C. to protest the reverse discrimination Bakke case then before the Supreme Court. Vietnam War He continued his activism by demonstrating against the Vietnam War. Peck began demonstrating against the Vietnam War in 1963 through the WRL-initiated Committee of Public Conscience and the Crisis Subcommittee, which quickly organized demonstrations in crisis situations. In October 1964 he helped launch the weekly Times Square Vigil against the war, which he participated in nearly every week for 8 1/3 years, from Oct. 1964-January 1973. Between 1965 and 1975, Peck attended every major rally in Washington, D.C. and was arrested 12 times for protesting the war. On February 19, 1965, demonstrations against the war occurred in 30 cities nationwide, and in NYC Peck was one of 14 people arrested for performing a sit-down at the US Mission to the UN. On August 9, 1965, Peck was one of 356 demonstrators arrested outside the Capitol Building during the Assembly of Unrepresented People, for taking part in a massive sit-in against the war, marking the largest amount of arrests at the White House up to that time. Starting in October 1965, Peck took part in the massive New York demonstrations coordinated by the single largest city coalition - the Fifth Avenue Vietnam Peace Parade Committee - which organized the nation's largest demonstrations on international days of peace, and Peck openly advocated for coalition building along with civil disobedience.Fred Halstead, Out Now: A Participant's Account of the Movement in the United States Against the Vietnam War. In November 1965, Peck joined 25,000 demonstrators in D.C. for a rally organized by SANE. In 1966 he signed two tax resistance declarations and began advising young people to avoid the draft.http://triptych.brynmawr.edu/cdm4/item_viewer.php?CISOROOT=%2FSC_Ephemera&CISOPTR;=1585 On February 23, 1966, Peck attended a dinner that honored President Johnson with a \\"Peace Award\\" at the Wardolf-Astoria hotel in New York City. Peck painted on the front and back of his shirt, \\"Peace in Vietnam,\\" but was covered by his coat. When Johnson was about begin his speech, Peck took off his coat, stood on his chair and yelled: \\"Mr. President, Peace In Vietnam!\\" He was dragged out of the room but he managed to announce his plea three more times, and later served 60 days in jail.Peck, James. \\"Underdogs Vs Upperdogs.\\" Canterbury, New Hampshire: Greenleaf Books, 1969. In April 1967, Peck marched with hundreds of thousands of people in NYC, as Martin Luther King, Jr. led the antiwar rally. On April 28, Peck attempted to crash the 1967 Montreal Expo by performing a sit-in on stage to protest the war, but he failed in his attempt to get arrested. In October 1967, Peck took part in the famous \\"Stop the Draft Week\\" as a speaker in NYC who introduced draft-card burner David Miller on stage, while also demonstrating in support of hundreds of youths as they burned their draft cards. On October 21, Peck was one of 683 demonstrators arrested for performing civil disobedience at the famous March on the Pentagon. In jail that night he spoke with fellow inmates linguist Noam Chomsky and author Norman Mailer. Peck appeared in Mailer's 1968 award-winning book on the protest, The Armies of the Night: History as a Novel, the Novel as a History.Norman Mailer, The Armies of the Night: History as a Novel, the Novel as History,1968, 192-193. On December 5, during the second \\"Stop the Draft Week,\\" Peck was arrested along with 263 other demonstrators outside an induction center in NYC. He was arrested along with Dr.Benjamin Spock and poet Allen Ginsberg. In 1968 Peck briefly joined students during their takeover of Columbia University, and he was gassed and clubbed at the notorious beatings during the Democratic Convention in Chicago. In 1969, Peck spoke out against burning draft files, but still supported those arrested for doing so. He was arrested on August 6, 1969, outside the office of the Secretary of Defense for reading antiwar quotations. For this he was one of four people arrested, along with WRL members Edward Gottlieb and Bent Anderson, as well as Barbara Reynolds.January‚ÄìFebruary, 1970, WRL-News. Peck took part in the massive moratorium demonstrations on October 15 and November 15, which gathered hundreds of thousands of persons. On March 19, 1970, Peck was one of 182 demonstrators arrested for obstructing government operations at Manhattan's Armed Forces Examining & Entrance Station, during nationwide, decentralized protests against the war. Peck was arrested that day along with draft file burner Jerry Elmer, who later recorded the arrest in his book Felon for Peace: The Memoir of a Vietnam-Era Draft Resister.Jerry Elmer, Felon for Peace: The Memoir of a Vietnam-Era Draft Resister,87. On April 24, 1971, Peck joined the massive march on Washington that over 750,000 persons took part in. On May 3, the first day of the May Day demonstrations in D.C., Peck was arrested along with 7,200 demonstrators in the single largest mass arrest in history, ending with over 13,000 arrested between May 3 and May 5. On October 26, he was arrested at the \\"Evict Nixon\\" protest in Washington, D.C., along with nearly 300 persons. He was arrested again outside the White House with 104 other demonstrators on November 9, during the two-week \\"Daily Death Toll\\" demonstrations, where activists performed die-ins to dramatize the continuation of Vietnamese deaths from American bombing. Peck was arrested again in D.C. on April 15, 1972, for performing a sit-down that resulted in 240 arrests. On May 22, Peck was among 224 demonstrators arrested for performing civil disobedience during the \\"People's Blockade\\" at the Pentagon. On June 10, Peck was arrested in New Jersey with 36 other demonstrators for being involved in the \\"People's Blockade\\" campaign that was conducted at navy ship yards to prevent ammunition from being sent to Vietnam. In August 1972, Peck was injured by a tear gas canister hitting him above the eye and was hospitalized during an anti-war rally in Miami at the Republican National Convention. On October 1, 1974, Peck was one of a dozen persons arrested at the UN for setting up a tiger cage replica, protesting the mistreatment of Vietnamese political prisoners by U.S.-backed forces. Beginning in 1974, Peck became involved in the Amnesty Campaign that aimed to protect the rights of deserters and COs during the war. On March 1, 1975, Peck was one of 62 demonstrators arrested for performing sit-downs during a tour of the White House in protest against President Ford's conservative amnesty plan. This marked the largest arrest on White House grounds up to that time. Peck attended the last major anti-war rally in New York City on May 11, 1975, when more than 50,000 people filled up Central Park. Anti-Nuclear Movement: 1970s-80s Following the Vietnam demonstrations in the 1970s, there was a revival in the anti-nuclear movement, which Peck took a major part in. In 1973 and 1974, Peck was part of several smaller demonstrations against nuclear testing by France. In 1974 and 1975, he joined Japanese delegates in NYC in protesting nuclear weapons. Then in 1975, he attended the first two organized demonstrations against the government's first strike nuclear policy. Throughout 1976, Peck was heavily involved in the Continental Walk for Disarmament and Social Justice, a nine-month march with 20 routes covering 34 states. Peck joined the Southern leg of the march that launched from New Orleans on April 4. The southern leg members, consisting mostly of Japanese Monks and poor blacks, were arrested six different times while marching through the south, but Peck was only present and arrested at four of these: Birmingham, Alabama; Rocky Mount, NC; New Bern, NC; and Ahoskie, NC. The last day of the Continental Walk for Disarmament and Social Justice was in Washington, D.C. on October 18, attended by 700 persons. Peck joined the \\"Procession of Death\\" to the Pentagon, where he and 52 other persons were arrested for laying coffins on the steps of the building. On October 12 and November 17, 1976, Peck joined in protesting China's resumption of nuclear tests. In the summer of 1977, Peck and American poet Millen Brand traveled to Japan and joined the march from Nagasaki to Hiroshima, the most famous feeder route of the thirteen involved in the Japanese Peace Walk. Peck and Brand attended numerous meetings with a variety of groups, spoke with government officials, and were the leading speakers at every event for the 30-day march. When Peck returned home from the Japanese Walk, he shared his experiences in a tour through the U.S., sponsored by the WRL and the Mobilization for Survival, one of the largest coalitions of antinuclear groups. His tour concluded in Colorado, where he joined a meeting hosted by Rocky Flats National Action Committee (RFNAC), an anti-nuclear group opposed to the major nuclear bomb plant in Rocky Flats, CO. At the meeting Peck was the first out-of-state person to endorse the RFNAC's rally at Rocky Flats for April 29, 1978. Peck was one of 6,000 persons demonstrating at Rocky Flats, and after the rally he was one of 150 persons who launched a 14-hour sit-down on the railroad tracks leading to the plant. Although Peck was only on the tracks for the first day, the sit-down was sustained for several months. Peck returned to Rocky Flats for a second major rally on August 6, where he sang a Japanese peace song he learned during the Japanese Walk. On August 9, he was one of 79 persons to perform a Die-In, along with Allen Ginsberg and Daniel Ellsberg, at the Rocky Flats plant, resulting in all of them being arrested. He returned to Rocky Flats again on April 29, 1979, along with 15,000 demonstrators, and he joined the sit-down on the tracks with 250 others, for which he was arrested for. During the Special Session on Disarmament at the United Nations in NYC in the spring of 1978, Peck joined in the major actions launched by the Mobilization for Survival. On May 27, Peck joined over 10,000 demonstrators in a march on the UN, and on June 12, he was arrested along with 380 other demonstrators at the US Mission to the UN for employing civil disobedience during the Sit-In for Survival, one of the largest mass arrests in NYC history. Later that month he demonstrated for the third time at the notorious Seabrook plant in New Hampshire. On October 16, the opening day of the Arms Bazzar in Washington, Peck joined a picket line to protest the manufacturing of military weapons. On February 12, 1979, during the trial of the \\"White House 11,\\" Peck held up a giant banner in court that read: \\"NO NUCLEAR WEAPONS/NO NUCLEAR POWER USA OR USSR.\\" He then led a march to the White House, where he was one of 22 persons arrested for performing a sit-down. When the near-meltdown almost occurred at Three Mile Island in March, the anti-nuclear movement expanded dramatically. Only two days later, when Peck marched in an antinuclear demonstration in NYC, he was amazed that a thousand bystanders joined. In the pouring rain on April 21, he marched with over a thousand persons in a protest to shut down the Consolidated Edison's Indian Point nuclear reactor. On May 6, Peck participated in the massive Washington demonstration that over 120,000 persons participated in, led by Ralph Nader. Then, on June 3, 1979, over 45 major demonstrations took place across the country as part of Europe's International Days of Protest. Peck was one of 560 people arrested that day for occupying the site at Shoreham on Long Island, after the largest rally that day was attended by 15,000. A major antinuclear concert was held in September for several days, with performances by legendary bands such as Tom Petty and Bruce Springstein. On September 23, Peck joined over 200,000 persons in Manhattan for the concluding rally, marking one of the largest antinuclear rallies up to that time. Peck found one of the most significant actions to be the \\"Wall Street Action\\" on October 29, the 50th anniversary of the Stock Market Crash, since it brought the fight to the financiers of the nuclear industry. That day Peck was one of 1,045 demonstrators to be arrested, along with David Dellinger and Daniel Ellsberg, for attempting to block the entrances of the stock market exchange building. On April 28, 1980, Peck marched with 1,200 demonstrators to the Pentagon, where he and nearly 600 others were arrested for blocking the entrances of the building, including Daniel Ellsberg, Dr. Benjamin Spock, David McReynolds and Grace Paley. Peck also took part in the largest antinuclear rally held in NYC on June 12, 1982. With one million people in attendance, it marked the single largest demonstration in the country for any cause. The rally marked the peak of antinuclear movement and led to dramatic changes in the political realm. Following the largest rally in history, a massive civil disobedience campaign was set for June 14 at the UN. That day over 1,600 persons were arrested for blocking the entrances of the five nations possessing nuclear weapons, making it the single largest arrest in the city's history. Peck was part of the first group arrested that day outside the U.S. Mission to the U.N. This was possibly Peck's last arrest in his life, having been arrested nearly 60 times overall. Prison Movement 1970s The Prison Movement, stemming from the radical protests of the 1960s, was crystallized by the Attica Prison riot in September 1971, which ended with NY officials sending in reinforcements to crush the riot, resulting in dozens of deaths. In memory of the deaths from Attica, protests were held at nearly 20 prisons nationwide on October 2, 1971. Peck attended the largest protest that day at Danbury, Connecticut, Prison, where he was held during WW-II. Peck rallied with 2,500 people at Kenosia Park, before hundreds rallied at the prison. Peck joined a thousand people on October 24, 1971, protesting an award dinner for Governor Rockefeller, who was responsible for the decision to move in on Attica prison. A wave of prison strikes swept the nation in 1972. Prisoners at Danbury prison went on strike due to poor working conditions and slave wages. On March 2, 1972, Peck joined activists in picketing outside Danbury prison. On October 7, 1974, Peck joined 800 people outside Cooper Union to protest Gov. Rockefeller's planned speech, over his orders during the Attica riot. Peck criticized the young people at the rally who later broke the windows at Chase Manhattan Bank, which became a big part of the story the following day in the New York Post. Peck revealed the pop-culture of the prison movement found in movies and books. Peck wrote a review in WIN magazine in 1972, covering Leon Dash's book, The Shame of the Prisons. He also enjoyed the 1970 publication of An Eye for an Eye, and the 1972 pamphlet by draft resister John Bach and Mitch Snyder (reprinted by the War Resisters League from the May 1972 issue of Liberation magazine), Danbury: Anatomy of a Prison Strike because it showed how the Vietnam protests were intertwined in the prison strikes. Peck wrote in the 1974 WIN magazine that his two favorite prison plays were The Jail and Attica. Peck became involved in the case of former boxer Rubin \\"Hurricane\\" Carter, who was sentenced to prison in the 1960s, after reading his famous 1974 book, The Sixteenth Round: From Number 1 Contender to Number 45472. On February 1, 1975, Peck joined a march from Trenton, NJ, State House to the Trenton Prison in support of Carter, hosted by the NJ Workers Committee Against Police Repression. Death Penalty Movement: 1970s From 1972 to 1976, the U.S. had a de facto moratorium on capital punishment, but in 1976 it became legal again after Gregg v. Georgia. Peck took part in one of the dozen southern vigils held on Christmas Eve, 1976, against the death penalty. Peck joined the candlelight vigil in New Orleans, one of the dozen cities to hold vigils orchestrated by the Southern Coalition on Jail & Prisons. Peck joined the national \\"Easter Witness Against Executions\\" protests in April 1977, organized by the Southern Coalition on Jail & Prisons. On April 9, Peck marched with 3,000 activists in Atlanta, Georgia, to end the death penalty and protect the \\"Dawson 5.\\" On April 10, Peck attended a similar rally in New York City, where he heard famed-activist attorney William Kuntsler. On March 9, 1977, Peck protested North Carolina Governor James Hunt at a New York City Symphony Orchestra because the Governor refused to intervene in the notorious international case of the Wilmington 10. On March 18, 1978 Peck joined 8,000 people in a march on the White House to free the Wilmington 10. On April 5, 1979, Peck joined a night vigil against the scheduled Alabama execution of John Louis Evans, which ended in celebration when the judge granted a last minute reprieve. On August 11, 1979, Peck was one of 66 demonstrators arrested for violating a court order by attempting to cross a bridge in Reidsville, Georgia, in order to reach Georgia State Prison on the other side. Peck was arrested there along with Dick Gregory to show support for the \\"Reidsville Six,\\" who were accused of starting a prison riot the year before. On November 23, 1979, Peck was one of 24 persons arrested at a protest against capital punishment at the Supreme Court building in D.C., sponsored by People Against Execution (PAX). The rally was called \\"Florida Day\\" to represent the more than 100 prisoners facing the death penalty in the state. A series of \\"mock executions\\" were conducted upon the 24 people risking arrest, who sat in a hand-made electric chair and pretended to be executed. The 24 bodies were carried across the street and placed on the steps of the Supreme Court, where they performed die-ins until their arrests. Labor 1970s Peck continued his 1930s labor activism in the 1970s. On October 25, 1972, he protested alongside a dozen Asian-American organizations against employment discrimination, outside the headquarters for the International Ladies Garment Workers Union, for posting advertisements along the idea that Japan threatened American jobs. Peck openly supported more radical rank-and-file unions because they could win victories in wildcat strikes, but he protested what he considered to be a more conservative union, the United Steelworkers. Peck joined 200 people in protesting the United Steelworkers convention in Atlantic City, NJ, on September 23, 1974, over the union's \\"experimental negotiating agreement\\" with U.S. Steel Corporation, which prohibited any type of strike. Peck took part in the first international demonstration against multinational corporations on Earth Day, March 21, 1975. Launched by Coalition Against Global Enterprises (CAGE), half a dozen protests were held within the U.S., and protests were held internationally in Brussels, Norway, Stockholm and Tokyo. Peck protested in NYC outside ITT building, where he held signs quoting Anthony Sampson's 1973 book, The Sovereign State of ITT.Jim Peck, \\"A Pioneer Demo,\\" WIN magazine, April 10, no. 12, p. 16. On June 4, 1975, Peck went to what he said was the largest Wall Street protest he attended up to that time of 12,000 union demonstrators. The Municipal Labor Committee, representing the major municipal unions, organized the rally against the 1975 crisis budget proposed by the Mayor of New York City, which threatened thousands of municipal jobs. The demonstration was associated with an economic attack by the union, which threatened to withdraw millions of dollars from First City National Bank if the crisis budget went through. Peck protested J.P. Stevens in the 1970s, an anti-union company that paid significantly lower wages than most factory jobs. On September 12, 1978, four men were arrested inside a J.P. Stevens store for standing in front of scab products and wearing shirts that read: \\"Boycott J.P. Stevens.\\" This was noted as the first \\"T-In.\\" On November 17, another dozen people, including Peck and David McReynolds, were arrested inside the NYC J.P. Stevens. Peck's group had all their charges dropped December 7. By the early 1970s, Peck considered Cesar Chavez of the United Farm Workers (UFW) to be one of the greatest leaders in nonviolent resistance. Peck joined weekly pickets for six years in support of UFW's grape and lettuce boycotts. Peck met Caesar Chavez and spoke with him at length in May 1970, during a mass march from Baltimore to D.C. to protest The Pentagon's purchases of scab grapes to export to troops in Vietnam. The Baltimore-to-Washington march marked the first one of its kind on the east coast. Peck traveled to Pacific Grove, California, to attend the three-day War Resisters League 50th anniversary conference in August 1973. When the conference ended Peck was one of 65 persons to join a motorcade to Fresno, in order to challenge the anti-mass picketing injunction against the UFW, which resulted in more than 400 arrests a week earlier. Early in the morning on August 8, Peck, along with Joan Baez, Daniel Ellsberg and others, picketed near a big ranch without problems. Peck's group then went to the second vigil at the courthouse where the injunction was debated. Peck joined 5,000 people protesting at Union Square in NYC on May 10, 1975, for the second annual UFW week, which was observed in more than 50 cities. Some time prior to the rally, UFW singled out Gallo wine to boycott, along with the continuing boycott of grapes and lettuce, and speeches at Union Square were made by Cesar Chavez, Dorothy Day and Bella Abzug. On June 16, 1977, Peck joined 100 UFW members in picketing outside the Connecticut Mutual Life Insurance Company in Hartford, Connecticut. The insurance company owned a significant number of citrus fruit groves along the west coast and had stalled previous negotiations for a union contract. Peck also protested New York City's subway fare increases in the 1970s, explaining it unfairly made money off the working class. When the subway fare increased from 30 cents to 35 cents in 1971, Peck walked through the subway gates without paying and encouraged others to do the same. He was arrested for this in 1972 and was fined $25. In 1975, NYC's subway fare nearly doubled to 50 cents, and Peck joined the first day of protests on September 2, 1975, and walked through the gates without incident and held gates open for other people to walk through without paying. He was arrested three times in 1976 for continuing protests against the fare increase. FBI Court Case In 1975, Gary Thomas Rowe Jr. testified that he was a paid FBI informant in the Klan, and that on May 14, 1961 the KKK had been given 15 to 20 minutes without interference by the police. Peck filed a lawsuit against the FBI in 1976, seeking $100,000 in damages. In 1983, he was awarded $25,000, and by this time was paralyzed on one side after a stroke. Peck had been working for Amnesty International until his stroke. By 1985, Peck had moved into a nursing home in Minneapolis, where he died on July 12, 1993, at age 78.

The barn is listed on the National Register of Historic Places. It was built in 1914, with a foundation of Mississippi River limestone, and is in diameter and high. It was built during a time of agricultural growth in Goodhue County, when dairy cow herds were averaging 25 cows per farm and farmers were starting to build specialized barns. The round barn design was built around a silo and provided insulation for the silage, as well as making feeding and cleaning easier. Despite the efficiency, however, round barns were difficult to construct, and they were not widely adopted. Later in its history the barn was used for honey production of the bee keeping owners of the farm. In 2000 the Farm was purchased by Robin and Elaine Kleffman and the Dammon Barn underwent some significant restoration. A straightening of the walls and replacement of the original pillars for the upper floor support and a leveling and new installation of a floor in the top level of the barn makes this one of the most premiere remaining round barns in Minnesota. The barn is now part of a bed and breakfast and event center. The facility is available as a venue for weddings.

After facing public criticism over financial decisions and stigmatizing campaigns, the Candie's Foundation rebranded as TheNext.Org in May 2016, then ceased operations in 2017. History In 2001, Neil Cole, head of the fashion brand Candie's and an executive at Iconix Brand Group, founded The Candie's Foundation, in response to accusations that his clothing brand sexualized teenagers. The Candie's Foundation mission was to educate teenagers as to the risks and consequences of teen pregnancy. The Candie's Foundation implemented national ad campaigns that discouraged teenagers from sexual activity. Fox News reports that the foundation \\"advocates for abstinence to prevent unwanted pregnancies.\\" Actresses Jenny McCarthy and Hayden Panettiere, as well as teen mom Bristol Palin, have been paid \\"ambassadors\\" for the foundation. In 2009, Bristol Palin was paid $262,500 to participate in the campaign. More than 20 celebrities have been hired to participate in Candie's Foundation PSA campaigns, including Vanessa Hudgens, Usher, Macy Gray, Rihanna, Ciara, Amar'e Stoudemire, Ashanti Douglas, Lupe Fiasco, Jennifer Hudson, Michael Sorrentino, Kenneth Cole, Matt Garza, Hilary Duff, Ashley Tisdale, Ashlee Simpson, Fall Out Boy, Vanessa Minnillo, Natasha Bedingfield, Fergie, Elizabeth Berkley, Bruno Mars, Taylor Swift, and Destiny's Child. The Candie's Foundation was an operating foundation rather than a grant-making foundation. However, the foundation has received criticism for spending more money on spokespeople than on grants to teen pregnancy health and counseling clinics. After investigations in 2003, Neil Cole and Candie's reached an agreement to settle charges of fraudulent accounting practices brought against it by the Securities and Exchange Commission. Neil Cole agreed to pay $75,000 to settle charges without admitting or denying wrongdoing. In 2019, Cole was charged with 10 criminal counts, including conspiracy, securities fraud, making false filings with the SEC and conspiracy to destroy records. Campaigns Celebrities that have participated in the campaigns include Hayden Panettiere, Beyonc√©, Ciara, Jenny McCarthy, Vanessa Minnillo, Ashley Tisdale, Hilary Duff, Ashlee Simpson, Usher, Rachel Bilson, Bristol Palin, Teddy Geiger, Diggy Simmons, Lea Michele and Vanessa Hudgens. Event to prevent Each year The Candie's Foundation hosted the Event to Prevent to raise awareness about teen pregnancy in the United States.

The Mariinskaya Gymnasium () in Taganrog on Chekhov Str. 104 - currently school No. 15 of the North Caucasus Railway ‚Äì originated from two oldest educational establishments in the South of Russia: the Mariinskaya Gymnasium for Girls and the Railway Vocational School.  History of Gymnasium  The present building of the gymnasium was constructed in 1875 by the architect Zagoskin. In 1861 a school for girls had been opened in Taganrog and later renamed Mariinskaya Gymnasium for Girls. Well-known personalities were among the educators: Pavel Filevsky, F. Braslavsky, Edmund Dzerzhinsky, D. Ponyatovsky and others. Among the students were such eminent people as the People's Artist of the USSR Faina Ranevskaya, artist Seraphima Blonskaya, poets Sophia Parnok and Yelizaveta Tarakhovskaya, an active member of Narodnaya Volya organization Nadezhda Sigida (Malaksiano), Anton Chekhov‚Äôs sister Maria. The Railway Vocational School with the 4-year course of studies was opened in Taganrog on September 1, 1896, on the initiative of a group of railway employees headed by the district superintendent E. Trik. After the Soviet power had been established in Taganrog, the Railway Vocational School was transformed into the 7-year labor school No 6, which moved into the building of the Mariinskaya Gymnaium in 1920. Several generations of teachers devoted themselves to making the School No 15 one of the most respected educational establishments in the city. Since the school was attached to the North Caucasus Railway and subordinate to the Ministry of Communications, the school principals had a formal pretext for screening students and sending backward pupils, who had no relatives in the railway system, to other schools nearby. It allowed the authorities to preserve its traditions and maintain high standards of education. In 1993 the School No 15 regained the status of gymnasium.

Most cameras used the standard 24√ó36 mm frame size, like the Contax, Nettax and Super Nettel. However, the ability to take images in fast sequence was a popular marketing element at the time, and several fast- operating models were made. Among these were the Otto Berning's motor-driven Robot cameras as well as the ZI lever-operated Tenax I and Tenax II. These have the smaller square format of 24√ó24 mm, enhancing faster frame advance. The Tenax II is a 35mm RF-camera launched by ZI in 1938. It produces 50 square exposures on a standard length of 35mm film. It has a Compur Rapid shutter, situated just behind the lens, with speeds from 1 to 1/400 second. The camera is wound and the film advanced simultaneously depressing the large lever on the right-hand side of the lens. At first it was only called the Tenax, but the following year a quite different and less sophisticated camera with the same name was launched, both designed by Hubert Nerwin, supposedly based on Otto Berning's original idea. The 1938 model is known as mark II, or just the Tenax II, while the simpler 1939 model, is known as the Tenax I. The \\"Tenax\\" name belonged to the C. P. Goerz company in Berlin, being used from 1907 on folding plate cameras and a Vest-pocket camera from 1909. C. P. Goerz became a part of Zeiss Ikon at its formation in 1926. The name was used again by ZI in the 1960s. The Tenax I was continued for a while in the 1950s in East Germany. The Tenax II has a proprietary bayonet lens mount as a provision for using different lenses, but only a small selection was made available during the few years the camera stayed in production, halted by Germany's war efforts. A small round window in a lateral extension on the lens barrel is aligned up in front of the camera's right-hand rangefinder window. It contains a pair of contra-rotating glass wedges synchronized with the lens focusing lever that provides accurate focusing by aligning a superimposed tinted image with the image in the viewfinder.

Housed in a historic, Edwardian-style building, the hotel originally opened its doors to the public in 1902 as the Hyde Park Hotel and in 1996 the Mandarin Oriental Hotel Group purchased the property and conducted a full renovation, consequently re-opening in May 2000. In June 2018, Mandarin Oriental Hyde Park, London completed the most extensive restoration in its 115-year history. The hotel was damaged in a fire on 6 June 2018 which was mainly confined to the exterior courtyard area of the hotel with limited impact on the interiors and is temporarily closed. History 1889‚Äì1996 Overlooking London's Hyde Park on one side and Knightsbridge on the other, the hotel was originally built in 1889 as an exclusive ‚ÄòGentleman‚Äôs Club‚Äô. The project, originally known as Hyde Park Court, was announced in August 1887 but was delayed by planning disagreements, including the proposed height of the development, which was to be the tallest building in London. Outraged residents feared a shadow would be cast over the Serpentine lake in Hyde Park and they threatened to force the builders to reduce the number of floors by putting up a wooden barrier which would block the light to the lower floors. An unsuccessful Bill was brought before Parliament to reduce the restriction of buildings from 100 feet to 60 feet, and so the original design of the hotel remained. The outside consists of red brick and Portland stone in an eclectic Franco-Flemish style. The hall, entered from Knightsbridge through swinging doors of carved walnut, was lined with coloured marble and had a frescoed ceiling, as well as a marble chimney-piece complete with a marble clock. Stairs of white marble flanked with balustrades led to the upper ground floor. This style of decoration continued in the principal communal rooms, including the breakfast and dining room overlooking Hyde Park. Mandarin Oriental Hyde Park, London Mandarin Oriental Hotel Group purchased the property in 1996 and conducted a complete ¬£57 million renovation of the hotel, as well as a re- design of the restaurants and bar. Mandarin Oriental Hyde Park, London re- opened in May 2000. In June 2018 an extensive restoration of Mandarin Oriental Hyde Park, London was completed. Internationally renowned designer, Joyce Wang, oversaw the redesign of the rooms, suites and public areas. Major fire The newly restored hotel in 2017 In 1899, a fire struck the property, damaging the top three floors of the Knightsbridge wing and destroying part of the roof, including the central iron and glass turret. All residents made a successful escape, despite the fire brigade's ladders only reaching halfway up the building. After the renovations, the building was reopened in 1902 as the Hyde Park Hotel, London's newest and grandest hotel. The ceilings and marble floors had survived, and period fireplaces in the style of Louis XV and XVI were installed, while the furnishings echoed the 18th century style of Sheraton and Hepplewhite. Between 1911 and 1912, the Ballroom was redecorated in a style of Louis XVI. In 1925, the architects Charles Fr√©d√©ric Mew√®s and Arthur Joseph Davis, who also remodeled some of the principal rooms in a traditional Louis XV style, added a Palm Court. On 6 June 2018, a fire broke out again, believed to have been caused by welding work, but no staff or guests were injured. The hotel temporarily closed for six months. In December 2018 the public areas of the hotel including all of their bars and restaurants reopened in time for the busy festive season. On Monday 15 April 2019 the hotel reopened to full service with all rooms and suites reopened and ready to use after extensive renovation, refurbishment and improvements.https://www.mandarinoriental.com/london/hyde-park/luxury- hotel/news-events/renovation-news A royal entrance As a private 'Gentleman's Club' the entrance to the building was through the Loggia, but in 1902, when it reopened as Hyde Park Hotel, the postal address changed from Albert Gate to 66 Knightsbridge. Tradition has it that the Queen would not allow any form of advertising within the Park, and therefore insisted that the main entrance, with the hotel's name above it, be moved from the Park side to Knightsbridge. The Queen consequently mandated that the original entrance be preserved for Royal use, unless permission is otherwise granted by the Royal Household, which has been upheld ever since. The doors were opened during the coronation of King George VI and Queen Elizabeth in 1937 when the Crown gave special permission for the guests to use the park entrance. Today, guests of Mandarin Oriental Hyde Park, London can still take part in this tradition of the hotel by requesting permission from the Royal Parks to use the ‚ÄòRoyal Entrance‚Äô for special occasions. Guests who have been granted access to this entrance include members of the Japanese Imperial family, former South African Premier General Hertzog, and a President of Uganda. Noteworthy events Many important events have been held at the Hyde Park Hotel. A few such events were Lady Doris Vyner's silver wedding party in 1948, with the King and Queen as guests of honour, and the Balaclava Ball, hosted by the five cavalry regiments who had taken part in the Balaclava charge, also attended by the Queen, Prince Philip, and the late Queen Mother. Other celebrations include the 1992 production of ‚ÄúPavarotti in the Park‚Äù, one of the country's largest open-air concerts, the 1995 Anniversary of VE Day in which seven Heads of State and their delegations took up residence, and ‚ÄòParty in the Park‚Äô, one of Europe's largest music events. The hotel hosted the 80th birthday party of Margaret Thatcher which was attended by HM The Queen and HRH The Duke of Edinburgh, along with former Prime Ministers John Major and Tony Blair, former deputy chairman of the Conservative Party Jeffrey Archer and entertainers Shirley Bassey and Joan Collins among others.  Restaurants and bar  The interiors of the restaurants and bar were created by the designer Adam Tihany.http://mandarinoriental.com/about_mo/media/press_kits/london/dining.aspx The hotel is home to three restaurants: Dinner by Heston Blumenthal, Bar Boulud, London, and The Rosebery Lounge, as well as the Mandarin Bar.

Released in 2009, the film aims to bring worldwide attention to the yearly killing of dolphins in Taiji, Wakayama, Japan.\\"Oceanic Preservation Society: Facts\\" Unable to acquire permission from the Japanese government, the filmmakers were required to go to extreme lengths in order to obtain the footage, utilizing equipment and tactics never previously used in a documentary film. The movie also features the International Whaling Commission (IWC) and IWC's refusal to protect small cetaceans, such as dolphins, primarily due to Japan's influence on the commission. Furthermore, The Cove acknowledges the risk of mercury poisoning to humans who consume dolphin meat while documenting the Japanese government's program to distribute dolphin meat to Japanese school children. The meat that is not distributed is sold and listed as whale meat. On March 7, 2010, The Cove won the Academy Award for Best Documentary Feature at the 82nd Academy Awards...\\"Nominees & Winners for the 82nd Academy Awards\\" \\"„Ç¢„Ç´„Éá„Éü„ÉºË≥ûÔºö„Äå„Ç∂„Éª„Ç≥„Éº„É¥„ÄçÂèóË≥û„Å´ÂíåÊ≠åÂ±±ÂèçÁô∫ Matsutani, Minoru, \\"'Cove' Oscar is Taiji's chagrin\\", Japan Times, March 9, 2010, p. 1.

Racing Extinction Film by Psihoyos that broadcasts and educates viewers on the horrific events damaging our planet's health and wildlife. All of these In the documentary the tragic slaughtering of sea life all around the world is brought to viewers attention. Racing Extinction addresses two major causes of species extinction: climate change and the wildlife trade. Marine species are featured prominently for both, from tiny organisms whose shells are dissolving as a result of acidifying ocean water, to large whale sharks caught for their fins, meat and oil. Psihoyos along with the help from activists, Tesla Motors, and Travis Threlkel managed to project astonishing images of the endangerment of our earth across the buildings of New York City.

The leaves are located along the stem, not in a rosette near the ground. One plant can produce as many as 1500 small yellow flower heads in a large conical array. Solidago altissima is self- incompatible, meaning that the pollen from one plant cannot pollinate the female flower parts of the same plant. Classification Solidago altissima has diploid, tetraploid, and hexaploid populations and morphological variations which has generally led to classifying it into two subspecies, which roughly speaking can be identified as being from the eastern and western parts of the continent. At least in the midwest, it is common to have plants of different ploidy interspersed, with little apparent tendency for one type to dominate even a fairly local geographical area.

Early life Cecil Frederick King was born to Frederick Hamilton King and Norah Carter King at Seven Oaks, Kent, England, the third of their four children. He attended Verites, Charterhouse School, and became a member of the Officers Training Corps there in 1912. At the beginning of World War I, he was living in Chelmsford. He joined the Essex Regiment Officers Training Corps as a private. He broke an arm in April 1915, which slowed his training. Aerial service King joined the Royal Flying Corps in February, 1917. In the fall of 1917, he was assigned to No. 43 Squadron RFC to fly Sopwith Camels. In conjunction with fellow ace Lieutenant William MacLanachan, he drove down an Albatros D.III out of control on 12 November 1917. King did not score again until February 1918; in the latter half of the month, he ran off a string of three more enemy craft driven down out of control, then became an ace by destroying an Albatros D.V on the 26th. By March 1918, he had advanced to B Flight Commander. On 22 March 1918, he was awarded the Military Cross. He also scored three more times in March. He won the French Croix de Guerre in July 1918 for strafing and bombing enemy troops during the Second Battle of the Marne. On 3 August 1918, King added a Distinguished Flying Cross to his medals. By 8 August, his tally had grown to 19 victories, including eight straight in Camel no. D1864. He then switched to Sopwith Snipe no. E8031 for his final three victories. A summary of King's triumphs shows he singlehandedly destroyed eight enemy aircraft (including one burned), shared two other destructions with other pilots, drove down seven enemy by himself, and cooperated with other pilots in driving down five others. Death King died in a midair collision on 24 January 1919 over Sedgeford, Norfolk, while serving as a combat instructor with 33 Squadron. His death notice stated his parents lived at Springfield Dukes, Chelmsford.Note: The CWGC says he was born at Springfield Dukes and his parents lived at Lingwood, East Liss, Hampshire He is buried at the churchyard of St Mary the Virgin at Docking, Norfolk. Honours and awards *Military Cross (MC) T./2nd Lt. Cecil Frederick King, Gen. List and R.F.C. For conspicuous gallantry and devotion to duty. On five occasions during a period of three months he has sent down four enemy machines completely out of control, and has destroyed one other. Later, under very adverse weather conditions he carried out a low reconnaissance, during which he engaged troops in a station, causing several casualties, fired into a body of the enemy entering a village from a height of 50 feet, attacked four gun limbers, causing the teams to stampede, and finally dived on to a parade of troops, who scattered in all directions. He has displayed exceptional daring and skill, which, combined with a splendid dash and initiative, have set a fine example to his squadron. *Distinguished Flying Cross (DFC) 2nd Lt. (temp. Capt.) Cecil Frederick King, M.C. He is a fine leader who at all times shows great gallantry and skill in manoeuvring; his energy and keenness have brought his flight to a high standard of efficiency. He frequently descends to low altitudes to obtain good results from bombing, and shooting, and on several occasions he has brought down enemy aeroplanes.

This private company is the successor organisation to the erstwhile voluntary association known as the British Guild of Travel Writers. The latter was founded in 1960. The association and the successor company are known by the acronym BGTW. The company's registered office is at Great Blakenham near Ipswich in England. The company's board of directors consists of ten long-standing members of the antecedent unincorporated association. Members of the new limited company The ten initial subscribers to the Memorandum of Association are automatically members of the new private company. Other members will be admitted in due course, provided that they meet the criteria for membership laid down in the Articles of Association. The antecedent voluntary association made provision for retired members (and others who were no longer professionally active) to retain a connection with BGTW as Associate Members. This category continues, but Associate Members will not be deemed to be members of British Guild of Travel Writers Limited under the terms of the Companies Act 2006. Scope of members' work Texts, broadcasts and images created by members of the old voluntary association appear virtually daily in the UK media and on the Internet, and to a lesser extent in non-UK print and broadcast media, with BGTW members reporting on travel and tourism issues from across the world. Many Guild members are established writers of guide books and narrative travel books, others frequently lecture on their specialist areas, while yet others comment critically on the history of travel or travel writing or on contemporary issues in transport and tourism. BGTW members write about destinations; they write about journeys, and they write about travel issues. The latter routinely include public transport, civil aviation, overland travel, ecotourism, slow travel, travel technology, consumer protection in the travel industry, medical tourism and travel medicine, and the development of and prospects for travel literature. With the opportunities in travel writing shifting further away from print journalism, a diminishing number of BGTW members would describe themselves as journalists per se. But there are nonetheless still many members contributing to mainstream media. Narrative travel books written by current BGTW members have won the Dolman Best Travel Book Award and the Wales Book of the Year. The BGTW considers applications from those who \\"weave words with style, take wonderful pics or cut a dash in other travel media genres.\\" AGM and Yearbook Until its dissolution in 2015, the association held an annual conference, restricted to members. The association's most recent annual meetings were held in the Scottish Highlands (2007), Malta (2008), York (2009), Tenerife (2010), Mussanah in Oman (2011), Boulogne on the north coast of France (2012), Zakopane in Poland (2013), Weimar in Germany (2014) and Milan (2015). In 2019 the event was held in Charleston, South Carolina. From 2016 the Company's AGMs are conducted under the rules laid down by the Companies Act 2006, and so restricted strictly to company business; those members not in attendance will be able to take advantage of new arrangements for proxy voting. The first AGM held under the new regulations was held in Tenerife in January 2016. It was funded by Hume Whitehead, a London based public relations company. The association's Yearbook was usually published in March each year; it enjoyed circulated widely within the UK travel trade and was also available for purchase by the public. The last yearbook was published in May 2015, carrying the date 2015-2016. It is not known if the new company will continue to publish a yearbook of any kind. BGTW awards programmes Through its annual Tourism Awards, the voluntary association recognised innovation and excellence in the tourism industry, both in the British Isles and more widely. The awards were reserved for projects that make a creative contribution to the experience and understanding of travellers. The project must be environmentally and socially responsible. The new company has not announced if this awards programme will continue. The award presentations were made each November at an annual awards dinner in London hosted on the eve of the World Travel Market (WTM). The BGTW voluntary association was often successful in securing sponsorship of its annual awards dinner including support from Las Vegas Convention and Visitors Authority and tourist authorities in Malta, Jersey, Turkey and Belgium. The successor company has not yet announced sponsorship arrangements for the 2015 dinner and subsequent events. At the annual awards dinner, the Guild had also made awards to its own members, recognising excellence in various categories of travel writing, as well as for travel photography, radio and television programmes related to travel, etc. The principal award is for the Travel Writer of the Year, based upon a portfolio of about half a dozen published articles and evaluated by an independent panel of assessors. The Guild also, from time to time, made a Lifetime Achievement Award to an individual who had made, over a sustained period, a notable and positive contribution to the development of worthwhile travel, either through published work or other initiatives. Recipients of the BGTW Lifetime Achievement Award include Hilary Bradt, the founder of the pioneering travel guidebook company Bradt Travel Guides, and the distinguished British travel writers Eric Newby and Patrick Leigh Fermor. The last such award was made in 2011. For many years, the British Guild of Travel Writers ran an annual travel writing competition to encourage new writing talent. The programme was discontinued in early 2014.

Its research focus lies in the field of social and economic policy including the spatial dimension. This comprises topics like poverty, inequality, education, social inclusion, employment, unemployment, health, housing, mobility, and regional convergence. The aim is to improve the understanding of causal relationships and to provide sound evidence for the impact of institutional settings and policy options on outcomes. Based on empirical evidence, the Institute wants to provide well-grounded and clear-cut answers to policy relevant questions. The results are published in form of research reports, monographs and scientific articles. LISER has been integrated into a unified legal framework for the luxembourgish research institutes based on the law of 3 December 2014. It has an annual budget of approximately 18,5 million euro, of which 60% is allocated by the government, and 40% are coming from project related funding resources. Governmental funding is based on a multiannual performance contract. Research Luxembourg and the Greater Region provide a unique and excellent laboratory for investigating social policy issues that are of key importance for the process of European integration. Substantial institutional differentials within a relatively small distance and their impact on cross-border activities like firm location, household mobility, monetary flows, and the like are generating an abundance of research topics, which are of relevance for a better understanding of the mechanisms of economic and social convergence or divergence. LISER contributes to the advancement of scientific knowledge in social and economic matters across the activities of its three research departments \\"Living Conditions\\", \\"Labour Market\\" and \\"Urban Development and Mobility\\". In parallel, the institute aligns itself with national and European priorities and fosters interdisciplinarity by focusing its research work on three priority research programmes: \\"Crossing Borders\\", \\"Health and Health Systems\\" and \\"Digital Transformation\\". LISER hosts two complementary infrastructures, key drivers of its research development and excellence. The Data Centre, which consists of two pillars, the data collection capability (direct and indirect data collection), and the data archiving and data management capability. The Behavioural and Experimental Economics dedicated to investigating human decision-making by means of experiments performed in controlled environments. Its experimental approach contributes to improving the understanding of human behaviour in a large variety of socioeconomic contexts. LISER aims to be an internationally recognised socio-economic research institute specialising in the analysis of societal changes. Through its inter-and-multidisciplinary research, it makes a proactive and targeted contribution to the sustainable and inclusive development of societies at the national and international levels. The Institute‚Äòs staff consists of about 180 employees (including the survey and data center), more than 50% of the staff being researchers, mainly from the fields of economics, sociology, and geography. Labour Market The main mission of the department is to produce research that is both excellent and impactful, and more specifically, to analyse the effects of public policies and societal changes on employment and on the workplace. The department's key themes revolve around: * The impact of public policies on employment in a context of high cross border mobility and; * How current socioeconomic challenges (such as digital transformations, diversity and ageing of the workforce) in the workplace impact firms' modes of organisation and performance, employees' skills and behaviour, and labour relations. These issues are timely and relevant for Luxembourg as well as for the European Union. The department's research is multidisciplinary (economics, statistics, sociology, political science, law) and makes use of various tools (policy evaluation, quantitative, experimental and qualitative methods). Through the Labour Market Observatory, the department uses its research infrastructure and competences to advise policy makers and inform the public about new findings in these fields. Living Conditions The mission of the department is to produce scientifically high-level and socially relevant research on 'Public Policies, Welfare and Socio-economic Inequalities'. The department's objective is to contribute via analysis of policy-relevant questions to a better understanding of the drivers of inequality, poverty and social cohesion, both in the short and long term, and of the role, efficiency and sustainability of social policies and the welfare state. The department is inter and multidisciplinary in nature and characterised by recognised international, scientific and academic expertise in measurement issues (e.g. inequality, equality of opportunity, social monitoring) and ex-ante (microsimulation) and ex-post policy evaluation. More specifically, the department studies the multiple dimensions of individuals' and families' lives which are at the heart of both the causes and consequences of inequality, from early childhood to old age, through education, fertility and family formation, from employment to retirement. Qualitative, typically survey-based research, examines household income, wealth, inequality, poverty, and social inclusion from a variety of perspectives. The impact evaluation of socio-fiscal, family, educational, health, pension and wider social policy on living conditions is an integral part of the department research agenda. The department contributes also to the multi and inter-disciplinary research programmes of the Institute: * The LC contribution to the \\"Health & health systems\\" interdisciplinary research programme is currently centred on the impact of ageing on the health status of the population and its subsequent economic effect, as well as on the analysis of health inequalities. * The LC contribution to the \\"Digital transformation\\" interdisciplinary research programme covers questions related to the future of social protection (e.g. basic income) or introduction of new methodologies in education (e.g. digital learning platform). * The LC contribution to the \\"Migration and Crossing borders \\" interdisciplinary research programme covers topics such as equality of opportunity and social mobility. The consequences of an increasing number of migrants and cross-border workers on the welfare state, social cohesion, preferences for redistribution and a multilingual educational system are investigated. Urban Development and Mobility The department's objective is to play a prominent role in academic and societal interdisciplinary and intersectoral research, internationally and nationally. The aim is to provide an understanding of urban life and the functioning of urban areas, the implications for the sustainability of cities as well as the quality of life of their inhabitants and visitors, and in identifying effective pathways at the individual and urban level to stimulate urban vitality and liveability. Major thematic issues on the research agenda are housing, financial centres development, spatial development, cross-border metropolitan integration, local and cross-border mobilities, public health, and smart cities. The two observatories, one on housing and another one on spatial development, including expertise in GIS, form an important basis for research. The UDM Department contributes also to the three inter-disciplinary research programmes: * Cross-border issues are central to many studies of the department. Analysing cross-border flows and the relationships with political, social, cultural, economic and institutional factors fosters multiple collaborations with the cross-border interdisciplinary programme. * UDM has developed strong competences in research on the health implications of mobility and exposures to urban environments and in health interventions, which will be further extended to contribute optimally to the Health & Health Systems interdisciplinary programme. * In a digitalised society, internet and smartphones offer opportunities to participate in e-activities in a manner less constrained by time and place. In addition, the implementation of automotive vehicles could change daily mobility. The social and spatio- temporal implications of a digitalised society will be an axe of research for the Digital Transformation interdisciplinary programme. Crossing Borders With the free movement of individuals within the EU, political instability and global inequality, more and more people have been crossing borders in recent decades, either as refugees, regular migrants or as daily transnational commuters. These cross-border movements generate important challenges for EU countries, and has particularly strong implications for its labour market, public finances, social cohesion and regional governance around border areas. In this context, it is important to have tools to monitor, analyse and improve the understanding of causes and consequences of these flows - a prerequisite for relevant advice to policy-makers. The cross-departmental Research Programme on 'Crossing Borders' seeks to coordinate, develop and contribute to the Cross-Border work carried out within and across any of the three departments of LISER. The Research Programme on Crossing Borders has specific objectives: (i) Assess the size and structure of historical and recent cross- border flows, and understand their root drivers. (ii) Use innovative sources of data to study the interplay between different forms of mobility. (iii) Analyse the economic and societal consequences of these flows for all parties concerned. (iv) Build projection tools to anticipate future movements. (v) Develop tools to help policy decision-makers to maximise the gains and/or minimise the cost of current and future movements for European countries in general, and for the Luxembourg society in particular. (vi) Provide stakeholders and the civil society with databases and expert analyses that help them understanding the forces at work and the consequences of policy actions. (vii) Contribute to the training of PhD researchers on these topics. Health & Health Systems One of the seventeen goals of the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) adopted by the UN in 2015 is \\"to enable everyone to live in good health and promote the wellbeing of all people at all ages\\". The environmental, social and economic conditions in which individuals live, work and develop their daily activities influence a majority of the population's risk factors and health conditions - often representing \\"the causes of the causes\\" of disease. Thus, a situation of poverty tends to limit the opportunities to adopt behaviours favouring good health (e.g. healthy diet, physical activity, etc.), to live in healthy environments (safety, healthiness, pollution), to access the means of self-realization (education, social relationships), and to access quality health and long-term care services. The cross-departmental Research Programme on 'Health and Health Systems' seeks to coordinate, develop and contribute to the health-related work carried out within and across any of the three departments of LISER. The work focuses on primarily quantitative, social, economic & environmental aspects of health, by harnessing the expertise and infrastructure throughout LISER. LISER will contribute to this objective by developing high quality, multidisciplinary research on a broad range of topics, including: (i) Socio- economic and spatial inequalities in the health of individuals and populations. (ii) Socio-economic and environmental determinants of health. (iii) The socio-economic consequences of health. (iv) The economics of health behaviours. (v) The rigorous evaluation - in terms of effectiveness as well as (where feasible) 'value for money' - of policies that may directly or indirectly influence these determinants, and; (vi) The assessment of health system performance. Digital Transformation Like the industrial revolution shook the past two centuries, the digital revolution is transforming our daily life as well as the functioning of our social and economic systems. Individuals increasingly use information and communications technology in their daily life; new goods and services are developed at an increasingly fast pace and our ways of communicating, learning, moving, buying, selling and even consuming goods and services are dramatically impacted by the digital transformation of our societies. The implications of the digital transformation will inevitably go beyond labour markets and will have direct and indirect impact for our social welfare systems as well as our ways of conceiving the next generations' education and training. Digital Transformations is a transversal cross-departmental research program that seeks to extend the use of mathematical modelling and optimisation to complex socio-economic systems so as to obtain descriptive and prescriptive models able to define/assess socio-economic policies as well as to predict their impact. Its main goal is to connect data to decisions in such a way to solve these problems effectively, achieve better / smarter decisions, and ultimately impact positively society. The programme heavily exploits analytics, quantitative modeling and computer science to tackle practical problems arising from different domains ranging from finance to education, passing through health care, transportation, telecommunications, and personalised medicine. Digital Transformations covers the following broad research areas: * Discrete and Robust Optimization * Mathematical Programming * Combinatorial and Graph-Theoretic Algorithms * Design and Analysis of Algorithms * Development of large-scale optimization techniques Data Centre LISER has traditionally had a predominant position in Luxembourg with respect to the face-to face survey component. Its portfolio includes both administrative surveys for Luxembourgish and EU institutions as well as surveys used for research by internal researchers and external research collaborators. Today, the Data Centre aims to collect data for scientific studies in order to make them available to researchers, political actors and other partners in society. Thanks to its expertise in survey methodologies and statistics, the Data Centre is a unique actor in Luxembourg for researchers and decision-makers in the development of research projects and actions on the field. As a research infrastructure for data collection and archiving of social science data, the objectives of the centre are to: * Support LISER researchers as well as the social sciences research community, both locally and internationally, through its unique data collection capability. By bringing operational and scientific expertise based on state-of-the-art, and innovative methods and technologies, the Data Center contributes to the production of high-quality research and effective solutions to major challenges facing society. * Offer a referenced and trusted platform with tools and services that enables both data producers and data users to easily share, find and access reusable and interoperable data. This is turn addresses the increasing needs of open science while being compliant with security, integrity and privacy of information at stake. Ongoing surveys include the Household, Finance and Consumption Survey (HFCS), The Household Finance and Consumption Survey - Cross-Border Workers (HFCS-XB) and the European Union Statistics on Income, SHARE Wave 8 and Living Conditions (EU-SILC 2019). Behavioural and experimental economics LISER started investing in behavioural and experimental economics in 2015, with the creation of 'LISER-LAB' which consists of a state-of-the-art laboratory facility with 32 networked computers and a subject pool of about 1000 university students, to run economics experiments. LISER's Centre for behavioural and experimental economics was established in 2019 with the objective is to: * Generate first-class academic research that can be of interest not only to academic researchers, but also to national and international policymakers. To pursue this objective, the Centre's is establishing long-term partnerships with public- and private-sector players that will allow researchers to co-produce research with non-academic partners and to pursue activities of grant-seeking. * Broaden the spectrum of experimental methods at LISER by creating a platform to conduct large-scale online experiments, using members of the general population resident in Luxembourg as research participants. * Maximise international visibility by positioning the Centre and LISER within a rich academic network, comprising international centres of excellence in experimental and behavioural economics. Researchers' interests span from the study of morality and social norms, and their interaction with the intuitional and cultural environment in which they operate, to the behavioural biases that affect labour market participation and outcomes (particularly in relation to gender issues). The group has a history of publications in several top-class academic journals, including American Journal of Political Science, Econometrica, Economic Journal, European Economic Review, Experimental Economics, Games and Economic Behavior, Journal of Economic Behavior and Organization, Journal of the European Economic Association, Journal of Public Economics, Management Science and Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences.  History  As of December 3, 2014 the former CEPS/INSTEAD has turned into LISER (Luxembourg Institute of Socio- Economic Research). Previously as CEPS, the Centre was composed of five research units: The Department of Population and Employment, the Department of Economics, the Department of Geography (GEODE) and the Department of International Development (ERDI). International Master in Social Policy Analysis (IMPALLA). With the political and financial support of the Luxembourg Prime Minister and the Minister of Culture, Higher Education and Research a CEPS/INSTEAD related University Consortium was formed in order to create a Graduate School for Comparative Public Policy Analysis and Data. The University Consortium and to guarantee the academic standards of the programme, CEPS/INSTEAD had made a joint venture agreement with the Department of Sociology of the Katholieke Universiteit Leuven as key partner and offers an International Master in Social Policy Analysis (IMPALLA). Integrated Research Infrastructure in Social Sciences at CEPS/INSTEAD (IRISS) was a visitor's programme at CEPS/INSTEAD. Its mission was to organise short visits of researchers willing to undertake empirical research in economics and other social sciences using the archive of micro-data available at the Centre. In 1978, Gaston Schaber founded an ASBL (Association without lucrative purposes) to research persistent poverty in industrialized countries within the framework of the First European Community Program to Combat Poverty. The Centre was then given by Luxembourg law the status of a public establishment by the Prime Minister in 1989, with scientific, administrative and financial autonomy  References  External links * Official homepage * IRISS homepage * Publications by members of CEPS/INSTEAD Category:Education in Luxembourg Category:Research institutes in Luxembourg ","title":"Luxembourg Institute of Socio-Economic Research"},{"id":"24099557","text":"Georges Cipriani (born 12 April 1950) is a former militant of the group Action directe.

AFI is headquartered in Leavenworth, Kansas, approximately 20 miles northwest of Kansas City, Missouri. About Armed Forces Insurance AFI's insurance coverages include auto, home, renter, life, business, flood, motorcycle, watercraft, motor home, pet health, umbrella, condo, mobile home, valuable items, and collector vehicle. All AFI members also receive free identity theft resolution and identity document recovery services in the event of a disaster. Another benefit of membership is a complimentary service that offers AFI members customizable, interactive tools to help increase home efficiency, save money, and inventory your personal property.Product Information AFI is a \\"reciprocal exchange\\", a type of cooperative insurer in which the policyholders bear a relationship to each other. In effect, AFI is owned by the policyholders who are served.About AFI The Subscribers' Advisory Committee (SAC), composed of active duty, reserve and retired military members, represents the insurance needs of members. The members of the SAC are also members of the Board of Directors, which oversees AFI business operations. History Armed Forces Insurance began on a frontier army post in 1887, when the Army Cooperative Fire Association was founded at Fort Leavenworth, Kansas. Thirty-eight officers of the garrison gathered to form this organization to provide low-cost fire insurance protection for their personal property tailored to the particular needs of regular army officers. They pledged their support to the Association (which later became Armed Forces Co-operative Insuring Association, and now Armed Forces Insurance Exchange).AFI History Through the years, the organization evolved to include other types of insurance products for military members. Currently, both personal property and dwellings are protected against loss due to a number of perils. Personal liability insurance also is available, and personal automobile coverage is offered in a limited area. In 1982, an affiliate organization, Armed Forces Insurance Exchange, was formed to operate as a licensed entity as states increasingly required insuring organizations to be licensed. On July 1, 1992, remaining Association assets and liabilities were transferred to the Exchange, and the merger between Armed Forces Insurance Cooperative and Armed Forces Insurance Exchange was complete. The formation of the Armed Forces Insurance Agency in 1999 allowed the company to partner with other insurers to offer a broader range of products and services to policyholders. Membership Eligibility Those eligible for membership with Armed Forces Insurance include active duty, retired, or honorably discharged military, including National Guard and Reserves.

The problems of defining islands in this part of the Hebrides are considerableFor example, Haswell-Smith (2004) treats Eileanan Iasgaich () as a single island of 50 ha, although during some high tides it becomes several tidal islets - none of which are ever connected to the \\"mainland\\" of South Uist. and it is likely that the population was recorded as being part of Grimsay itself, which has a population of 169 (in 2011). Thus, it has not been possible to provide either an estimate of the total or to rank the island relative to other Scottish islands.In 2001 the General Register Office for Scotland defined an island as \\"a mass of land surrounded by water, separate from the Scottish mainland\\" and although the inclusion of islands linked by bridges etc. is not clear from this definition in practice they list several. There are however several smaller bridged islands that are likely to be inhabited from time to time they did not provide a population statistic for - see this list.

In 2014, he won the PHL playoff championship with Ciarko PBS Bank KH Sanok and again in 2018 and 2019 with GKS Tychy. He also plays for the Poland men's national ice hockey team. Playing career Junior Murray played minor hockey with the Philadelphia Jr. Flyers until the age of 16. At 16 years of age, Murray left home for Youngstown, Ohio, to play for the North American Hockey League's Youngstown Phantoms. He played in 21 games that season. For the next two seasons, Murray played for the United States Hockey League's Sioux Falls Stampede, where his teammates included T.J. Oshie, Andreas Nodl, Jay Barriball and Alex Kangas. In his first season with Sioux Falls, Murray had a dismal record of 7-13-2 and a goals-against average of 3.24 but he still managed to have a save percentage of .902%, thanks mostly to one shutout. The next season, Murray had a GAA of 2.14 while allowing only 68 goals, the same as he did the year before, as well as a much-improved record of 23-7-1 and three shutouts. He also had a save percentage of .930%, both of which were second-best in the USHL that season. Murray and teammate Alex Kangas found themselves both ranked in the Final Central Scouting for the 2006 NHL Entry Draft for North American goaltenders with Kangas ranked tenth and Murray ranked 22nd. (Both had slipped through the draft the year before.) Kangas was chosen 135th overall by the Atlanta Thrashers but Murray was not drafted. Murray then began to contemplate his future. He considered playing for the University of Maine but he did not have a scholarship. His agent then contacted him with a job offer with the OHL's Kitchener Rangers. The Rangers had lost their #1 goaltender, Dan Turple, to graduation after being signed by Atlanta. On May 25, 2006, considering the length of the OHL schedule, Murray signed with the Rangers, eventually taking the #1 job away from sophomore goaltender Mark Packwood. After Packwood was traded to the Oshawa Generals, rookie Charles Lavigne (now with the Qu√©bec Remparts) backed up Murray for the rest of the 2006-07 OHL season. Murray finished the 2006-07 season with a record of 40-9-3, a 2.58 GAA, a .909% save percentage and five shutouts. He represented the Western Conference at the 2007 OHL All-Star Classic in Saginaw, Michigan. During the 2007 offseason, Murray was signed to a professional tryout contract by the Columbus Blue Jackets. During a game against the rookies of the Dallas Stars, former OHL foe James Neal cross- checked Murray in the shoulder after making a save. The cross-check separated Murray's shoulder and it broke his collarbone in two places. Thinking that he would have had a spot on the Syracuse Crunch, Murray was sent back to Kitchener as an overage player. The Rangers, however, had two new rookie goaltenders, Josh Unice and Mavric Parks, as well as three overagers already on their roster. On December 7, 2007, the Rangers traded Murray to the Kingston Frontenacs, who desperately needed a goalie after Anthony Peters was hit by a car and broke his leg in an accident in Windsor. The next night, Murray was in goal for his first game of the 2007-08 season, starting against his former team. He allowed six goals on 50 shots against. On January 25, 2008, Murray was involved in a fight with Niagara IceDogs goaltender Lucas Lobsinger which resulted in a two-game suspension. Murray finished the season with a 12-15-1 record, a 3.78 goals-against average and a .901% save percentage. During his two OHL seasons, Murray also accumulated 37 penalty minutes. Professional After the Kingston Frontenacs missed the playoffs in 2008, Murray was signed by the ECHL's Reading Royals. In his first ECHL start, against the Elmira Jackals at First Arena in Elmira, New York, he recorded a 38-save shutout en route to being named the first star of the game. In the summer of 2008, Murray was signed to the ECHL's newest franchise, the Ontario Reign. Murray did well in Ontario, earning a berth at the 2009 ECHL All-Star Game in Reading. After Jeff Zatkoff came back from an injury, however, Murray found himself traded to the now-defunct Mississippi Sea Wolves in February 2009. He played in only two games for Mississippi, both of them losses. During the period of time between the ECHL All-Star Game and his trade, Murray was recalled by the Syracuse Crunch while Dan LaCosta was recalled by the Columbus Blue Jackets. In the summer of 2009, Murray was signed to a two-way contract between the Manitoba Moose of the AHL and the Victoria Salmon Kings of the ECHL. After starting the 2009/10 season with the Salmon Kings, his job was taken away when the Calgary Flames assigned both David Shantz and Matt Keetley to the team. Murray was claimed by the Johnstown Chiefs, an ECHL team in his home state of Pennsylvania. With the Chiefs having folded, Murray was to return to the Salmon Kings in 2010/11; instead, he opted to sign with HK Partizan as a free agent. As a Partizan Murray had an outstanding season. He posted a 1.97 GAA (goals against average) and a 0.933 save percentage in the regular season and led his team to victory over the HK Olimpija to become the 2010-2011 Slohokej League Champions and later Serbian Hockey League Champions. In the Serbian Hockey League Championships against the KHK Crvena Zvezda Murray in two games posted a 0.951 save percentage and a 1.5 GAA.

Moldova became fully independent from the Soviet Union that December, and joined the United Nations three months later.  Background  left In the new political conditions created after 1985 by the glasnost policy introduced by Mikhail Gorbachev in 1986 to support perestroika (restructuring), a Democratic Movement of Moldova () was formed, which in 1989 became known as the nationalist Popular Front of Moldova (FPM; ).

On August 27, 1989, the FPM organized a mass demonstration in Chi≈üinƒÉu, that became known as the Great National Assembly (), which pressured the authorities of the Moldavian Soviet Socialist Republic to adopt a language law on August 31, 1989, that proclaimed the Moldovan language written in the Latin script to be the state language of the MSSR. Its identity with the Romanian language was also established.Legea cu privire la functionarea limbilor vorbite pe teritoriul RSS Moldovenesti Nr.3465-XI din 01.09.89 Vestile nr.9/217, 1989 (Law regarding the usage of languages spoken on the territory of the Republic of Moldova): \\"Moldavian SSR supports the desire of the Moldovans that live across the borders of the Republic, and considering the existing linguistic Moldo-Romanian identity ‚Äî of the Romanians that live on the territory of the USSR, of doing their studies and satisfying their cultural needs in their native language.\\" The first independent elections for the local parliament were held in February and March 1991. Mircea Snegur was elected as speaker of the parliament, and Mircea Druc as prime minister. On June 23, 1990, the parliament adopted the Declaration of Sovereignty of the Soviet Socialist Republic Moldova, which, among other things, stipulated the supremacy of Moldovan laws over those of the Soviet Union. After the failure of the 1991 Soviet coup d'√©tat attempt, on August 27, 1991, Moldova declared its independence. On December 21 of the same year Moldova, along with most of the former Soviet republics, signed the constitutive act that formed the post-Soviet Commonwealth of Independent States (CIS). Moldova became fully independent from the Soviet Union on December 25, 1991. The following day the Soviet Union ceased to exist. Declaring itself a neutral state, it did not join the military branch of the CIS. Three months later, on March 2, 1992, the country gained formal recognition as an independent state at the United Nations. In 1994, Moldova became a member of NATO's Partnership for Peace program and also a member of the Council of Europe on June 29, 1995.  Declaration of Independence of Moldova  The Declaration of Independence of the Republic of Moldova was a document adopted by the Parliament of the Republic of Moldova following the dissolution of the Soviet Union.

The mission is to make theatre a regular part of the Middle Eastern community‚Äôs cultural life, and to make the Middle East a regular part of the American theatre experience. Golden Thread Productions defines the Middle East broadly and inclusively, believing that the common human experience transcends cultural and political differences. Among the nations represented in past productions are Iran, Armenia, Egypt, Israel, Palestine, Algeria, and Afghanistan. Golden Thread is led by the founding Artistic Director, Torange Yeghiazarian, and Managing Director, Michelle Mulholland. The organization is overseen by a board of trustees led by president Kia Mousavi, and an advisory board led by chairs, Marvin Carlson from the City University of New York, Graduate Center and Hamid Dabashi from Columbia University. Artistic associates include Vida Ghahremani, Yussef El Guindi, and Roberta Levitow. The annual programming consists of a mainstage season of two to three full-length productions, the ReOrient Festival of short plays, an annual Women‚Äôs Day event, touring and education program for youth, and a variety of workshops, staged readings, and special events offered throughout the year. Golden Thread Productions‚Äô debut production was Operation No Penetration, Lysistrata 97! The classic Greek antiwar comedy was adapted to a Middle Eastern setting where Palestinian and Israeli women unite to force men into signing a peace treaty. Golden Thread Productions was awarded the American Theatre Wing's National Theatre Company Grant in 2013 and 2016. ReOrient Festival Golden Thread Productions' hallmark event is ReOrient, an annual festival of plays exploring the Middle East. Debuted in 1999, more than thirty plays have been presented at the ReOrient Festival, the majority of them world and/or U.S. premieres. For four weeks, the festival provides a rare opportunity for artists and audiences alike to engage deeply and directly with the Middle East in a creative and supportive setting that displaces misinformation and encourages understanding. The ReOrient Festival has provided a home to some of the best known emerging Middle Eastern voices on American stage (and screen) today including: Betty Shamieh, Caveh Zahedi, as well as such established playwrights as Naomi Wallace, Eric Ehn, Israel Horovitz, and Motti Lerner. The critical response to the ReOrient Festival has, over the years, been general acclaim: Robert Hurwitt with the San Francisco Chronicle calls it ‚ÄúHaunting and provocative‚Ä¶with reverberations far beyond its immediate cultural context,‚Äù and Rob Avila with the San Francisco Bay Guardian states ‚ÄúGolden Thread triumphs with the ReOrient Festival.‚Äù Fairytale Players Over the past three years, Golden Thread has developed programming for youth in the community. In 2006, the company launched The Fairytale Players as part of their Children‚Äôs Traditional Theatre Program, created by an ensemble of actors who work together in a workshop setting to create and tour fairy tales from around the Middle East. This project is rooted in their past efforts on The Norooz Story and An Iranian Fairytale, both based on ancient tales and utilizing traditional performance elements, music, and dance from the region. These short fairytale performances were presented at the Asian Art Museum, the San Francisco TheatreFest, and Asian Pacific Islander Festival, as well as Park Day School and the Ferry Building. Golden Thread has also recently developed an after-school program in partnership with Krouzian-Zekarian- Vasbouragan Armenian School in San Francisco, and plans to expand their roster of venues in 2009 to include schools, libraries, museums and community centers.

History Steve's Ice Cream Steve's Ice Cream was founded in 1973 in Somerville, Massachusetts by Steve Herrell. By mechanically altering a small batch commercial freezer, Herrell produced an extraordinarily rich, creamy, low-air ice cream. Herrell was introduced to the Heath candy bar by a friend in the late 1960s and felt that it would make an excellent addition to ice cream. When he opened his first store, instead of having pre-mixed flavors like chocolate chip, he had his staff mix freshly made ice cream with candy or other confections based upon customer requests. These candy additions later became known as smoosh- ins. The custom-blended flavors proved to be highly desired by customers, and Herrell sold out of ice cream on his first day open. The store became very popular in a short time. Herrell sold his company to Joe Crugnale, the future founder of the Bertucci's restaurant chain, in 1977.The Washington Post, 7/24/1983, \\"Ice Cream Wars: The Terrible Swift Umlaut\\", p. C1 Herrell's Ice Cream After selling Steve's Ice Cream, Herrell moved to Northampton, Massachusetts. The sale agreement included a three-year non-compete clause. After this expired in 1980, he opened Herrell's Ice Cream, bringing with him all of the original recipes and techniques he used at Steve's. Stores The flagship store and corporate headquarters is located in Northampton, Massachusetts. In 1982, a second store opened in Harvard Square in Cambridge, Massachusetts and is now closed. Another store at the Massachusetts Museum of Contemporary Art in North Adams, Massachusetts, opened in 1996. The newest store in Huntington, New York, opened in 2008. In September 2009, the franchise owner of the Harvard Square location announced that he would close the ice cream parlor and replace it with a pub. This closure comes just months after another location in Allston, Massachusetts also closed, leaving only a handful of stores still open. In 2008 Herrell's was split into two businesses, Herrell's Development, which is run by Judy Herrell (Steve and Judy Herrell were divorced in 2000) which deals with franchisees, and Herrell's Ice Cream, run by Steve Herrell, which handles the store in Northampton. The Allston Herrell's closed after disputes with how the franchise business was being run; it became Allston Cafe, selling Coop's Ice Cream, Allston Cafe has since closed.

In 2011, the Band is a second section contesting Brass Band. Early history Tilbury Railwaymens Band, Circa 1919 On 28 May 1919 a meeting of the Tilbury Branch of the National Union of Railwaymen was held. At this meeting it was proposed and agreed to form a brass band. By 1 July the Tilbury Railwaymen's Band had called its first meeting and two delegates were appointed to travel to Shoeburyness (near Southend-on-Sea) to view a set of 24 instruments. On the next meeting night 47 members were in attendance. As only one bandsman (Mr H. Jones) could play an instrument he was appointed as Band Master. As candidates stepped forward for instruments it was discovered that 30 wanted to play the big drum. In August 1920 Mr. Snelling was appointed as Bandmaster, and Mr. Jones joined the playing ranks of the band. At the band's AGM in January 1921 the decision was made to purchase the band their first set of new instruments from Hawkes & Sons (now Boosey & Hawkes) in London. On these, it was said, the band made favourable progress. At the half yearly meeting in July, owing to the repeated request of supporters in the town, it was decided to alter the name to The Tilbury Town Band. February 1922 saw a contest for local bands held at Grays. Wishing to gain a conductor with contest experience, Mr. G Nicholls of Grays Temperance Band was engaged. After five weeks tuition the band mounted the contesting platform for the first time securing second prize and two medals. (Out of the five bands, all the others were over twenty years old). Following success at grays it was decided to pay a visit to what is now known as the National Brass Band Championship of Great Britain, held at The Crystal Palace. It was, however, not until 1923 that the band made a success at the Crystal Palace contest, securing third prize in the Junior section B, competing against twenty seven bands from all over the British Isles. December 1922 saw the band purchase their first set of 33 uniforms from The Uniform Clothing & Equipment Co. WWII suspension and a new home During the Second World War the Band's activities were suspended, but it was quickly reformed when peace 'broke out' in 1945. Four years later (on 24rd March, 1949) the band purchased an old Salvation Army hall (in Dock Road, Tilbury) for ¬£225. This became the new band headquarters. In the 1960s the band changed name again, to the present name \\"The Tilbury Band\\". In 1976 the original band hall was demolished to make way for a new purpose-built headquarters at the cost of ¬£22,000. This hall is the one still used by the band today. Recent history During the 1970s and '80s the band made the finals of the National Brass Band Championships of Great Britain three times, coming third in the second Section in 1978 (under the baton of Melvin White). The band were promoted to the Championship Section. The Youth Band under the direction of Michael Stroud, were the Butlins National Youth Champions and finalists in the Pontins National Youth Championship. On St. Patrick's Day (17 March), 2001 the band went to the London & Southern Counties qualifying round of the second section at Stevenage. Under the direction of Robert Nunnery they walked away with first prize and an invitation to the national finals in Preston in September 2001. In 2008, The Tilbury Band officially appointed a new conductor and director of music in Alan Duguid, who remained position until the appointment of Andrew Austin in 2011. As of Autumn 2016 the Musical Director in residence has been Benjamin Jones.

Firth was president of the London Municipal Reform League from 1882, and author of Municipal London; or London Government as it is and London Government as it ought to be. At the 1885 general election he stood unsuccessfully at North Kensington and at the 1886 general election at Newington West. In February 1888 Charles Lacaita, one of the sitting Liberal members for Dundee resigned his seat over the Home Rule policy of Gladstone and the Liberals, and Firth was elected in his place. In 1889 a democratically elected London County Council was created, and Firth was elected as a member of the Progressive majority group. He became the first deputy chairman of the council. Firth died suddenly from \\"sun stroke\\" at the age of 47, while in Switzerland. Firth married Elizabeth Tatham, daughter of a sometime mayor of Leeds in 1873 .

It occurs in Latin America and the Caribbean.  Hosts  Rodents are the normal definitive hosts, especially the Cotton Rat. Aberrant infections have occurred in many other mammals including humans. Infection of mammalian hosts occurs via ingestion of L3 larvae in mollusc tissue (e.g. undercooked or raw snails or accidentally on produce) or possibly food contaminated with slime containing such larvae. Molluscs are the intermediate host and are infected through ingestion or penetration of the foot by L1 infective larvae from infected feces. * Limax maximus * Slugs from the family Veronicellidae  Pathology  Pathology is due to both the adults and the eggs. Adults in the ileo-caecal arterioles cause an inflammatory (eosinophilic) response in humans. In the Cotton Rat the adult worms cause local haemorrhages. The intestinal wall is also affected. In humans there is a thickening of the intestinal wall (ileum, appendix and caecum). In rats with heavy infestations there is a yellow discolouring of the surface of the intestinal walls.  Clinical signs and diagnosis  *Abdominal pain which presents as a palpable mass on clinical examination *Anorexia *Diarrhoea *Vomiting In the blood and tissue biopsy there is eosinophilia. Other methods of diagnosis from a biopsy are eggs and larvae in the blood vessels. Imaging of the liver and intestine can also be helpful. Serology is sometimes used to diagnose from a blood sample and there are specific enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays (ELISA). This is a rare disease. In Martinique, a French island of the Antilles, two confirmed cases and two probable cases were identified during an 18-year period (2000-2017), with an estimated incidence of 0.2 cases per year (0.003 case/year/100.000 inhabitants).

He is famous mainly for his book The Life of Christ edited in 1941 and reedited and reprinted several times. Life Ricciotti was born in Rome on 27 February 1890. In 1905 he entered the novitiate of the Roman Catholic religious order of the Canons Regular of the Lateran, taking religious vows the following year. After his seminary studies and completing mandatory military service, he was ordained as a priest in 1913. After ordination, Ricciotti continued his studies at the University of Rome, where he took courses in both philosophy and theology. At the same time he did coursework at the Pontifical Biblical Institute. During World War I he was required to interrupt his studies and to perform military service, during which time he served as a military chaplain, volunteering for service at the front lines, and was afterwards awarded a Silver Medal of Military Valor for his service in the trenches, where he was seriously wounded. Because of this experience, he came to oppose any kind of war. After the war, Ricciotti resumed his studies and graduated in 1919 with a degree in Biblical Studies. From 1924 onwards, he taught Hebrew literature at the University of Rome. He also taught similar courses briefly at the University of Genoa and at the University of Bari, where he taught from 1935 to 1960. In addition to this, Ricciotti set up and directed a small seminary in Liguria. In 1935 he was appointed Procurator General of his religious congregation. During World War II, due to his office he was able to give refuge to many refugees at the congregation's motherhouse at the Basilica of St. Peter in Chains. During this period, he also served as a consultant to the Vatican Congregation for the Clergy. He held this position for his congregation until 1946, when he was named as the Abbot of Gubbio. Giuseppe Ricciotti died in Rome on 22 January 1964. Works Ricciotti's first important work is Storia d'Israele (), published in 1932. In 1932 he also published Bibbia e non Bibbia () where he supported the need to apply the Higher criticism to the study of the Bible, to be based on the original texts and not on the Latin Vulgate. In 1934 Ricciotti took a stand against the increasing antisemitism publishing the translations in Italian of sermons of Cardinal Michael von Faulhaber in favour of the Hebrews. The period in which he worked was one of deep suspicion of Biblical Studies in Italy. As a result, Ricciotti was partially involved in the late stages of the Modernist crisis. He was attacked, along with his friend Ernesto Buonaiuti, by the most conservative Catholic wing. Differently from Buonaiuti, his positions were finally judged not to be modernist, and he accepted criticism by the Pontifical Biblical Commission to some of his works. His masterpiece is Vita di Ges√π Cristo (), edited in 1941 and published many times. The scholar Nicolotti writes: \\"His works on biblical texts, of a rather conservative character, show a solid historical and philological training, not at all alien to the contemporary acquisitions of the critic.\\" Giuseppe Ricciotti also wrote: La Bibbia e le scoperte moderne (), 1957, and L'imperatore Giuliano l'Apostata secondo i documenti (), 1958. Additionally, he edited a new translation into Italian of the Bible from the original texts.

Life Nebel started his professional career 1909 in the field of building engineering. He took acting classes at the Lessingtheater in Berlin until 1914. His acting teachers were the famous Rudolf Bl√ºmner and Friedrich Kayssler. He wanted to give his debut at Stadttheater Haben when World War I broke out. Nebel spent the years of war on the German Eastern and Western Fronts. In 1918, during his 14-month war imprisonment in Colsterdale, England, he wrote his expressionistic poem Zuginsfeld condemning the war. In 1919, he returned to Berlin and became friends with Wassily Kandinsky, Paul Klee, Georg Muche, Kurt Schwitters, and their art. He joined the circle around Herwarth Walden and his wife . She initiated his collaboration at the Sturm gallery and the art school Der Sturm. Together with Hilla von Rebay und Rudolf Bauer he founded the artist group Der Krater in 1923. During this time he also worked for the magazine Der Sturm. Nebel married Hildegard Heitmeyer, the assistant of Gertrud Grunow, in 1924. He met Hildegard at the Bauhaus in Weimar. They stayed in Weimar until 1925 where they painted, wrote poems and acted. In 1933, when the National Socialists disparaged his work as degenerate art, he left Germany for Switzerland, first in Muntelier, and later in Bern. Nebel had financial problems because he was not allowed to work in Switzerland. Thanks to the effort of Kandinsky, he could regularly sell some of his paintings to the Solomon R. Guggenheim Foundation between 1936 and 1951. The German Federal Republic awarded Nebel the Order of Merit of the Federal Republic of Germany in 1965. Early work The cutthroat reality he experienced during the First World War as young soldier and army reserve lieutenant influenced his wish to pursue an artistic career. Landmarks for making this decision were the commemorative exhibition for Franz Marc and Nebel's acquaintance with Herwarth Walden, whom he met in 1916 in Berlin. Walden provided an important platform for avant-garde approaches in art, literature, and music with both his Der Sturm gallery and the journal with the same name, and thereby greatly facilitated the breakthrough of expression. Nebel's distressing experiences during the war is the central theme in his literary debut \\"Zuginsfeld\\" (1920). The 6,000-verse poem picks up the thread of August Stramm's poetry and the ensuing Der Sturm school while, however, exploring new paths. The literary collage depicts the mayhem of war by adopting its typical language. Associatively and playing with words, Nebel produced never-ending word chains using authentic word snippets from military orders, passwords and watchwords, headlines, folk songs, and from the language of the educated in Wilhelmine Germany. The satiric bite of the textual collage is visually manifest in the series of drawings for \\"Zuginsfeld\\", which he first executed in 1930. With barbed pen Nebel made caricatures in 50 pen-and- ink drawings of the military and other groups in society who, in his eyes, stirred up elation for the war. The grotesque figures are strongly reminiscent of the imagery used by Georg Grosz and Otto Dix. War likewise impacted Nebel's work in that almost all of his pictorial oeuvre created prior to 1933 was destroyed in Berlin during the Second World War. Therefore, we know little of his early paintings, drawing, and prints. Nebel was in touch with well-known artists and writers during the disoriented post-war era of inflation. He lived in precarious conditions and, among other jobs, took on commissions in order to survive. (See the cover designed for Die Dame magazine of 1920.) He sought refuge in the utopia of art as the contrasting program to his dismal plight. In 1920, Nebel joined forces with Rudolf Bauer and Hilla von Rebay and formed the group Der Krater / Das Hochamt der Kunst (\\"The crater / The high mass of art\\"). The three artists shared the view that painting should be purely non- figurative, zeroing in on artistic experience and emotions. The notion that the revolution of modern art could also lead to a wished-for transformation of society linked them to other avant-garde groups of artists and writers. Even if the group did not stay together long, the ideas it pursued remained fundamental for Nebel's work. Runic fugues and runic flags Nebel executed them for his poem \\"Unfeig\\" (1924/1925), which is a pivotal work for his notions about the alphabet. He called the poem a runic fugue. In \\"Unfeig\\", as in his other runic fugue \\"Das Rad der Titanen\\" (1926/1957), he used only nine or twelve letters of the alphabet. The Runen-Fahnen (\\"Runic Flags\\") are optical scores that visualize the interplay between individual letters of the alphabet and their various facets. Analogous to the fugue in music, in the runic fugues the vowels and the consonants chosen at the beginning determine the \\"theme\\", which is continually repeated and transformed by expansion, reduction, and inversion. Nebel's goal in reduction and concentration of linguistic material was to create a contrasting language to hackneyed everyday language and its rational use. He wrote, \\"The miseducated people of our times are deaf to words and blind to images. They do not hear what they read. What they write, they cannot see.\\" Nebel believed that he regained the directness lying hidden behind the conventions of language in individual words and letters of the alphabet. With format larger than man-size, the Runen-Fahnen intimate that the whole body should participate in reading. The Runen-Fahnen are a fourfold visual representation of the original beginning of the text: Runic Flag 1 displays the wording in a typography invented by Nebel. Runic Flags 2‚Äì4, in turn, replace Latin characters with another system of signs and thereby break with habitual perception. The individual letters of the alphabet can no longer be overlooked. Runic Flag 2 records sounds by allocating each one a special form and color affiliated to its specific qualities. Runic Flag 3 takes on the level of characters, which we become aware of as graphic unities and forms by means of alienation. Runic Flag 4 combines both aforementioned aspects. Nebel understood characters or runes as independent linguistic entities whose sound or acoustic and visual dimensions were the key part of an artwork. The runic fugues, however, represent an experimental search for the \\"inner sound\\" (Kandinsky) of words and letters, their impact on the emotions. Although the fragments of Uns, unser, Er sie Es (1922) are to be read as preliminary attempts that culminated in the runic fugues, they nevertheless have a very independent and distinct quality. In the original single sheets that were bound together to make the book, Nebel drafted an ABC using painted geometric symbols. On these folios he attempted, at least partly, to find a correspondence between characters and sounds. The artist reworded them later into collages of paper cuttings, making extremely short poems. These works underscore the parity between word and image in his work, between literary and visual forms of expression. His legacy of manuscripts gives insight into the writing process behind the runic fugues and gives a palpable impression of how content is dependent on language. \\"Musical\\" works Even before Nebel \\"officially\\" gave up using representational visual language he created a number of non-objective works, which often had titles taken from music terminology: Animato, Dopio movimento, 'ondo con brio gai or Con Tenerezza. They were produced during the 1930s, some during his sojourns in Italy. Nebel compared his endeavors with those of an orchestra conductor who \\"rehearses\\" a score with an orchestra. These works herald his non- objective work. This is very much what Wassily Kandinsky had in mind in his trailblazing book Concerning the Spiritual in Art: \\"Musical sound acts directly on the soul and finds an echo there because, though to varying extents, music is innate in man.\\" With increasing tendencies to abstraction, Kandinsky too referred to music and sought to express emotions - analogous to writing scores - with colors and forms in his Compositions, Improvisations, and Impressions. Nebel untiringly demanded of spectators that they open themselves up to the \\"resonating tons\\" of the pictures they view. Nebel asserted, \\"My painting is poetry, the sister of my linguistic art. Where language ends is where the runic order of symbols begins.\\" Bavaria and Ascona Around 1926 to 1928 Nebel was often in the Bavarian village of Kochel, not far from Murnau. He loved to regularly visit Ascona in Switzerland as well. In Kochel he founded a wallpaper factory and met with much adversity and red tape, forcing him very soon to give up the experiment. He produced numerous wallpaper designs at the time, and was able to utilize them repeatedly for his collages at later dates. During his stay in Kochel he often went on hikes in search of motifs in the Bavarian countryside. The artist commented on his colorful drawings from this period in the following words: \\"The strangeness of the composition is to be understood humorously. The images are such that belong in children's souls. They may be kept protected under galls on small round tables that can be revolved at will. Then mums can take their darlings for a walk around the countryside of Kochel and tell fairytales. They only have to read the story that Uncle Painter has laid down there.\\" Thus are the instructions that Nebel gave to \\"read\\" his \\"colorful and bright compositions\\" of this period. Later in the 1920s he returned periodically to Ascona. There he painted intensely colorful scenes with a southern flair (such as Aus Losone (\\"From Losone\\") or Ascona-Lido. The town in the Ticino region had a strongly Italian flair and was a key attraction for many avant-garde artists. Among those he met there was, and they planned to start a painting school together (Cavallo rosso). He was additionally invited to exhibit in Ascona together with the artist's group Der grosse B√§r. The group comprised artists such as Marianne von Werefkin and the founder of the group, Walter Helbling. Italy / Arcadia Italy was an eternal magnet for Nebel. During a three-month stay in 1931, he compiled his Farben-Atlas von Italien (\\"Italian color atlas\\"). It was to be the essential basis for many future pictorial compositions. In his explanations on the pages opposite the individual plates, the artist added remarks on the overall ambience of the respective views. The greater the variety of color and the more conspicuous the \\"resonance\\", the more generously he calculated the geometrical figures and the colored rectangles. He also \\"portrayed\\" the objects by their color-values and \\"sounds\\" - whether it was paint on house walls or fishing boats, whether olive or pine groves, mountain ranges or beaches. Ultimately, Nebel compiled a \\"psycho-historical\\" catalogue by classifying certain colors according to personal optical impressions, and with the resulting scales he laid the basis for his future work. How important the color atlas would be for the artist from now on when he was designing or composing pictures can be not only seen in works such as Rivoli, Pompejanisches (\\"Pompeian\\"), Camogli, Recco or Arkadisches (\\"Arcadian\\"), but already in the sheets Siena I to III. As a former construction expert, he was often greatly taken by architectural aspects. In Siena the earthen colors of the brick buildings dominate. They are interwoven by rhythmic accents - of light and shade, rust-red and olive-green. On the other hand, all sorts of variations blue and gray dominate in the works in which he took the atlas plates of Florence to hand (Toscanische Stadt/Tuscan City, 1932), the city in which the artist repeatedly took refuge in the future. The works that are related to Florence are especially full of allusions to architectural motifs and colorful flashes, and infused with the city's characteristic bright light. After going into exile, Nebel interpreted both building motifs and landscapes through the lens of the Farben-Atlas (\\"Color Atlas\\"). Abstraction and the non-objective The artistic freedom he experienced after leaving Germany in 1933 allowed him to increasingly turn away from representational painting. The gallerist Jeanne Bucher played a role in this transformation in his art. Nebel met her in April 1937 in Paris. She had several artists representing the \\"new art\\" in her program, and among them was Wassily Kandinsky. Thus Nebel had contact to the cosmopolitan group Abstraction-Cr√©ation (Incidents in Light Yellow, Suspended, Happy, all 1937). In 1938, Nebel first officially used the term \\"non-objective\\" in his work catalogue, and among such pieces classified in this way is work number \\"U2\\", Animato. As early as 1936 onwards, he was able to sell works to the newly founded \\"Museum of Non-Objective Painting\\" in New York, that is, to the institution that is now the Guggenheim Museum. Nebel's connections to this museum were of fundamental importance to him, because from 1933 ‚Äì in exile in Bern ‚Äì he was without a work permit. He had especially Kandinsky's recommendation to thank for the Guggenheim's support, as well as the goodwill of his friend from his first years in Berlin, Hilla von Rebay, who was the initiator and administrator of the Guggenheim Foundation. This generous and continuous support continued during the Second World War and lasted until 1951. Today, 36 works of art by Nebel dating from 1936 to 1948 still belong to the Guggenheim Museum collection in New York. Others have been sold in the meantime. That Nebel, after the mid-1930s, explored abstract painting more intensively is linked to a present he received from his wife Hilda at Christmas in 1935: an edition of the I Ching: Book of Changes. The Near East Series The whole work comprises sixty large-format sheets. In 1962, Nebel travelled by boat to the Near East via Dubrovnik and Mykonos to Istanbul, Sochi, and Bursa. The drawings optically resemble Arabic or Cyrillic characters and, to a great extent, are executed on gray or black \\"imperial- quality paper\\". Nebel considered them to be visual runic narratives that were closely related to his literary texts. Early portfolio artworks and series In 1929 he executed four portfolio artworks. They were conceived as a crossover between text and image, whereby the image was mostly created first, and the text subsequently captured thoughts and observations on the respective work. The initial outlines in pen or pencil are partially visible under the colored pencil drawing. It is only the first series Karneval (Carnival) that has no text; presumably in this case Nebel did not deem a corresponding text necessary. A masked ball that took place in Berlin on 9 February 1929, was the inspiration for the carnival atmosphere Nebel presents in a kaleidoscope of imagery and movement. In total, the artist opens up 26 windows for spectators, through which they can view brightly colored figures and clowns wearing masks as they drift past. Some of them have an eerie appearance. Artists' relationships While on leave from the war in Berlin, Nebel visited the commemorative exhibition at Der Sturm Gallery for Franz Marc, who was killed in the war on 4 March 1916. Thus this pivotal artist came to his notice and was henceforth much admired. In Herwarth Walden he met a patron of the arts who later opened up options for exhibitions and publishing. Waldens's wife at the time, the Swedish artist Nell Walden-Roslund, ran into Nebel again decades later in Bern, and an old friendship was renewed. In 1922 Moholy-Nagy exhibited for the first time in der Sturm Gallery. The two artists met again in 1928 in Ascona, where especially Marianne von Werefkin had become close friends with Nebel. Later Nebel corresponded in particular with Lothar Schreyer and Georg Muche. They had become acquainted at Der Sturm gallery, and all three sought to restore the missing metaphysical dimensions of art. Nebel felt rapport with Albert Gleizes too. In 1935, he received a letter from him in which Gleizes confirmed their artistic affinity: \\"Nous sommes sur les memes voies, occupies des memes recherches.\\" In the heyday of Der Sturm, Wassily Kandinsky was seen as someone who revitalized art and was a guiding star for many artists. A large segment of Nebel's work found its way into the Guggenheim Collection in New York through Kandinsky's and Hilla Rebay's support. Kandinsky and Nebel exchanged a wealth of letters and thereby left ample proof of their friendship.  Technical diversity The artist liked to experiment especially with the linocut, a great favorite among the German Expressionists and a medium that they imbued with new life. After contributing to Der Sturm journal in the early 1920s he began to work with this printing technique again, in particular in 1936, and produced the 7-series Gastgeschenk in Schwarz-Weiss (\\"Hospitality gift in black-and-white\\"), a self-contained series of 210 linocuts - some of them almost miniatures - presenting a fusion of his hitherto art and form vocabulary. The subject matter of his linocuts follows the repertoire of his colored works on paper and sketches as well as paintings, and occasionally they explore paths for developing entirely new genres. Nebel produced linocuts continually alongside his other work. The medium opened up new and diverse avenues of expression. Again and again he returned to this technique and experimented with different kinds of linoleum and various layers of colors. In this way he achieved a multilayer print very similar to the effect he strived for in his other pictures, that is, to achieve an airy spatial effect. He included cuttings from his linocuts in his papiers coll√©s and collages. In them he also utilized his Kochel wallpapers. Nebel also regularly experimented with \\"reverse glass painting\\". This form of art he discovered during a stay in Upper Bavaria, where it was very popular for devotional and votive pictures. Late in life he started to explore this technique again and produced spirited and colorful abstract compositions on glass panels. Summary A reminiscence and summary by Kate T.

III, 11 Stat. 163) was an act of the United States Congress which ended the status of foreign coins as legal tender, repealing all acts \\"authorizing the currency of foreign gold or silver coins\\". Specific coins would be exchanged at the Treasury and re-coined. The act is divided into seven sections. Background Before the Act, foreign coins, such as the Spanish dollar, were widely usedMurray N. Rothbard. \\"The Mystery of Banking\\" (pdf), p.10, referenced 2009-08-24. and allowed as legal tender by the Act of April 10, 1806.Library of Congress. \\"An Act regulating the currency of foreign coins in the United States\\", passed on April 10, 1806, referenced 2009-08-24. The Coinage Act of 1857 also discontinued the half cent. Furthermore, the penny was reduced in size. The large cent was discontinued and regular coinage of the Flying Eagle cent began. History In the newly created union after the Revolutionary War and up until 1792 and the establishment of the US mint, the sole medium of exchange in terms of specie was foreign coin. Alexander Hamilton had proposed that foreign coin (of which he specially based the dollar) circulate freely for a period of three years until the new mint in Philadelphia was running at full capacity in order to have a smooth transition. This clause was renewed several times after being first specifically spelled out on April 10, 1806. By 1830, about 25% of all circulating coins were milled of Spanish origin. ‚ÄúWhen Foreign Coins Circulated Freely by Gerard Muhl.‚Äù Crooked Lake Review. Web. 15 Mar. 2011 President Andrew Jackson supported foreign coin as legal tender in his famous war with the Bank of the US in the Gold Bill.Martin, David A. ‚ÄúThe Changing Role of Foreign Money in the United States, 1782‚Äì1857.‚Äù Journal of Economic History. 4 (1977): 1009‚Äì1027. This new development ended up making it difficult for the US to retain its overvalued worn Spanish silver in the 1840s. By the late 1840s and early 1850s, the US mint had finally been able to match demand for foreign coin. Effects The Coinage Act of 1857 repealed prior legal tender laws concerning foreign specie. It fixed the weight and measure of US one-cent pieces at 4.655 grams, which was composed of 88% copper and 12% nickel. It also mandated that this new copper/nickel alloy be received as payment for the worn gold and silver coins turned in at the mint. The effective aim was to limit the domestic money supply by crushing European competition. This was the first major step towards the government essentially having a monopoly over the money supply. The act drastically altered American business. For decades, those who had accepted any form of payment as long as it was made of specie began to immediately only tolerate those newly minted with a fresh seal from the US government. Due to insatiable demand early on for the new federal cents and the profits to be made by collecting the foreign silver, many individuals, along with banks, competed with each other. The newly minted American silver made much of the foreign silver obsolete in the eyes of some. There also was the ever-present issue of the non-decimal system used in foreign coin, making prices subject to fractions of a cent and therefore payments were inconvenient. Even still, circulation of foreign coins lasted for decades longer in the rural interior.

The ship was purchased from Italy by Sweden in 1940, along with her sister ship HSwMS Psilander. Before that, she served in the (Royal Italian Navy) as Bettino Ricasoli, one of four members of the Italian . Puke was scrapped in 1949. Design and description The Sella-class destroyers were enlarged and improved versions of the preceding and es. They had an overall length of , a beam of and a mean draft of . They displaced at standard load, and at deep load. Their complement was 8‚Äì9 officers and 144 enlisted men. The Sellas were powered by two Parsons geared steam turbines, each driving one propeller shaft using steam supplied by three Thornycroft boilers. The turbines were rated at for a speed of in service, although the ships reached speeds in excess of during their sea trials while lightly loaded. The ships carried enough fuel oil to give them a range of at a speed of . Their main battery consisted of four guns in one twin-gun turret aft of the superstructure and one single-gun turret forward of it. Anti-aircraft (AA) defense for the Sella-class ships was provided by a pair of AA guns in single mounts amidships and a pair of machine guns. They were equipped with four torpedo tubes in two twin mounts amidships. The Sellas could also carry 32 mines. Construction and career Bettino Ricasoli, named after the Italian Prime Minister Bettino Ricasoli, was laid down by Pattinson at their Naples shipyard on 11 January 1923, launched on 29 January 1926 and commissioned on 11 December. The forward single-gun turret was replaced by a twin-gun turret in 1929. Sale to Sweden In December 1939, a Swedish commission to Italy departed to investigate the possibility for Sweden to buy warships. This led to the acquisition of the Psilander and Romulus-classes. On 14 April 1940, all four destroyers left La Spezia and on 10 July the ships arrived in Gothenburg where the ship was renamed for Admiral Johan af Puke. Swedish service After arriving in Sweden, Puke was put into service in the Gothenburg Squadron. Over time, the ship was found to be too weakly built and rolled heavily in heavy seas, which meant that reinforcements had to be made and bilge keel had to be mounted on the hull. In addition, the low freeboard of the stern caused it to be flooded in bad weather. In the years 1941‚Äì1942 the ships armament were modified. The air defense was changed to two 40 mm anti-aircraft automatic guns m/36 and two dual 8 mm anti-aircraft machine guns m/36. The 45 cm torpedoes was changed to 53 cm torpedoes and depth charge throwers and rack-deployed depth charges were installed. After a very short service, the ships were placed in reserve between 1943 and 1944. Fate Puke was decommissioned on 13 June 1947, after which she was used for shooting and exploding tests before she finally was scrapped in Karlskrona in 1949.

Hall (APD-107), ex-DE-597, was a United States Navy high- speed transport in commission from 1945 to 1946, 1950 to 1957, and 1961 to 1965. Construction and commissioning Earle B. Hall was laid down as the Rudderow-class destroyer escort USS Earle B. Hall (DE-597) by Bethlehem- Hingham Shipyard, Inc., at Hingham, Massachusetts, and was launched on 1 March 1944, sponsored by Mrs. William Thomas Hall, the mother of the ship's namesake, Aviation Machinist's Mate Earle B. Hall. The ship was reclassified as a Crosley-class high-speed transport and redesignated APD-107 on 17 July 1944. After conversion to her new role, she was commissioned on 15 May 1945 with Lieutenant Commander E. J. Haddon, USNR, in command.  First period in commission, 1945-1946  Earle B. Hall departed Norfolk, Virginia, and reached San Diego, California, on 17 August 1945, two days after the end of World War II. She embarked 90 men for passage to Pearl Harbor, Territory of Hawaii, on 12 September 1945. She arrived at Okinawa on 28 September 1945. While her boats were being converted for shallow-water minesweeping, she carried passengers and minesweeping gear from Buckner Bay, Okinawa, to Sasebo, Japan, and through the Bungo Strait. In December 1945, her boats were returned, and with them, she moved to Wakanoura Bay, below Osaka, Japan, arriving there on 14 December 1945. There she provided logistics support for her boats, sweeping magnetic mines in the shallow waters of the Inland Sea, particularly the major port of Kobe, Japan. Earle B. Hall put to sea on 25 February 1946, and called at Eniwetok, Pearl Harbor, and San Francisco, California, on her way to Boston, Massachusetts, where she arrived on 9 April 1946. She was decommissioned and placed in reserve at Mayport, Florida, on 27 September 1946.  Second period in commission, 1950-1957  Recommissioned on 7 December 1950, Earle B. Hall departed Jacksonville, Florida, on 19 December 1950, for her home port, Norfolk, Virginia. After refresher training, she departed Norfolk on 29 May 1951 for a three-month northern cruise, supplying such outposts as Gr√∏nnedal, Greenland. Returning to Norfolk, she trained United States Marines in amphibious warfare off Onslow Beach, North Carolina, and in the Caribbean. Earle B. Hall departed Norfolk on 22 April 1953 for a Mediterranean tour with the United States Sixth Fleet, returning to Norfolk on 26 October 1953. Local operations off the Virginia Capes alternated with two cruises to Key West, Florida, and Havana, Cuba, and United States Marine Corps amphibious exercises in the Caribbean until 17 June 1955, when she steamed to the Azores; Lisbon, Portugal; and C√°diz, Spain on a midshipman cruise, returning to Norfolk on 15 July 1955. The remainder of Earle B. Halls service during her second commission was spent on the United States East Coast and training in the Caribbean. She was decommissioned and again placed in reserve on 13 September 1957.  Third period in commission, 1961-1965  Earle B. Hall was recommissioned on 29 November 1961 at either the New York Naval Shipyard at Brooklyn, New York,Per NavSource Online (at http://www.navsource.org/archives/10/04/04107.htm). or at Naval Amphibious Base Little Creek at Virginia Beach, Virginia.Per USS Earle B. Hall APD-107 Web site (at http://earlebhall.com/history.html). President John F. Kennedy observed Earle B. Hall on 13 and 14 April 1962 during his visit to Norfolk. She then departed for Vieques Island, off Puerto Rico, where she participated in a three-week joint U.S.Navy-U.S. Marine Corps exercise maneuver involving 83 United States Atlantic Fleet ships that climaxed with an amphibious assault on Vieques Island. From 10 October to 7 December 1962, Earle B. Hall operated in support of the blockade‚Äîor \\"quarantine\\"‚Äîof Cuba during the Cuban Missile Crisis. :[History needed for 1962-1964] During the autumn of 1964 Earle B. Hall suffered a major engineering failure that caused her to lose all power while underway, and it was decided that she would be retired from service. To replace her, high-speed transport USS Kirwin (APD-90), which had been in reserve since decommissioning in 1946, arrived under tow at Little Creek on 30 November 1964 and was moored alongside Earle B. Hall. Earle B. Halls crew then set about preparing Kirwin for reactivation.  Final decommissioning and disposal  On 15 January 1965, Earle B. Hall was decommissioned for the last time. Simultaneously, USS Kirwin was recommissioned, and Earle B. Halls crew transferred to Kirwin. Earle B. Hall was stricken from the Naval Vessel Register on 1 February 1965.

She is founder of KKProjects, Life is Art Foundation. Early life Kaechele was born in Topanga Canyon, California, and raised in Guam, Micronesia and Japan. Her father was a retired RAND Corporation aerospace engineer and early practitioner of Rolfing. Career In 1994, Kaechele began an informal education with travel over land to more than fifty countries in seven years, a hands-on investigation of the idea that life designs itself. During this period, she met and mentored with a variety of thinkers, including Biosphere 2 creator John P. Allen, chemist Albert Hoffman, writers Tom Robbins and John C. Lilly, John Perry Barlow, Rodleen Getsic, psychiatrist Oscar Janiger, artist Peter Nadin and German architects building sustainably on a Sannyasin commune in Maui, Hawaii. In 1995, she worked with the Shipibo ayahuasca shamans in the Peruvian Amazon. In 1996, she performed with La Mama theater in New York City. On and off Kaechele attended University of California, Santa Cruz, but in 1999, left just short of graduation to work with VH1 producer Tad Low on a travel show. The production took her to remote southern Lebanon, where she remained with a group of writers, philosophers and historians in Sur (Tyre), a nonpartisan observer in Hezbollah territory. In 2000 Kaechele moved to New Orleans and joined the downtown art scene, collaborating with artist Matt Vis (Kid Calculator) of Generic Art Solutions on performance art projects and backup dancing for musicians Quintron and Miss Pussycat, MC Tracheotomy and MC Sweet Tea. She was a member of the 9th Ward Marching Band, an avant-garde marching band founded by Quintron. In 2006 Kaechele founded Life is Art Foundation KKProjects, an art space composed of five deteriorating houses in the St. Roch neighborhood of New Orleans. The foundation invited local and international artists to create site-specific installations utilizing the houses and surrounding ecological and social environment as medium. Exhibitions included artists from emerging to Tony Oursler, Mel Chin, Keith Sonnier and Robert Rauschenberg. The Life is Art Foundation was founded on an appreciation for ecological systems and natural order. The application of systems-based thinking to life and art was its core mission, as expressed through projects that married art with architecture, ecology, agriculture and human social order. The foundation served as a test site for ideas in these fields. In 2010 Kaechele left KKProjects and moved to Tasmania to join David Walsh and MONA (Museum of Old and New Art). She transformed four of the New Orleans art installation houses into 24 Carrot, a community garden where children grow, cook and sell organic produce. The project introduces vegetables to a food desert, inspires healthy eating and teaches entrepreneurial skills. The project‚Äôs 2018 expansion includes a food truck, designed by children in the program, from which they sell dishes prepared with produce they grow. Menus are created by the kids in collaboration with celebrity chefs. Kaechele founded MONA‚Äôs 24 Carrot program in Tasmania, a sister garden project in partnership with the Tasmanian Department of Education and private funders. 24 Carrot operates in thirteen primary schools in neighbourhoods of greatest need. Kaechele's curatorial work in the US included a land art exhibition of a living sugar cane field sculpture in rural Louisiana by Norwegian artist Anne Senstad, large-scale, site-specific installations in New Orleans‚Äô City Park and Botanical Gardens for Voodoo Experience, and a medical marijuana farm in California, Life is Art West, which donated all proceeds to the arts. In 2015 Kaechele returned to New Orleans to stage a gun buyback as a conceptual artwork / performance during the New Orleans Biennial, Prospect 3. It was the largest gun buyback in New Orleans‚Äô history and played with libertarian values by using private enterprise and the free market to create gun control. The exhibition, set in an 8th Ward car wash, was promoted on billboards and rap radio stations throughout the city, and opened with performances by bounce and rap artists Big Freedia, Hot Boy Ronald and Mr.Serv On. The installation included a recording studio, The Embassy, where youth could lay tracks with celebrated local rappers for free. The Embassy, intended to run for three months, was so popular that Kaechele decided to keep it open and build a permanent space to house the studio- as part of a larger school. Kaechele is building a school in New Orleans with architects Assemble and Room 11 in an abandoned 9th Ward union hall. The free school will serve 14 - 25 year olds and house The Embassy recording studio, a hacking school, art school, beauty school, fashion school and 24 Carrot culinary art school. All subjects integrate science, technology and social enterprise. The MONA project is a conceptual artwork entitled P5 1 L0V3 Y0U. Controversy In 2005, Kaechele began to buy five properties in poor condition on North Villere Street in the St. Roch neighborhood in New Orleans, an area known for gun violence and poverty. In 2006, the five houses became the headquarters of Kaechele's Life is Art Foundation KK Projects, which staged exhibitions and other events there. Kaechele also converted some of the houses into art pieces: the facade of one house was replaced by an oversized circular bank vault door to create a \\"safe house\\"; another was \\"pierced\\" by wooden poles and resembled an \\"architectural voodoo doll.\\" In 2010, when Kaechele moved to Tasmania, she still owned the five properties and left them unoccupied. As a result, the properties deteriorated even further, adding to the neighborhood's blight, and two have been demolished. Kaechele, who owed back property taxes and code enforcement fines on the properties, blamed her inability to maintain the properties on the 2008 recession, and insisted in 2011 that she had always intended for them to be torn down and replaced by \\"green space\\". The remaining properties were used by squatters, much to the dismay of local residents. Personal life Kaechele lives in Tasmania and is a curator at MONA. In March 2014, Kaechele married art collector and former professional gambler David Walsh. Kaechele and Walsh have one child, Sunday Walsh.

Matos has spent over a decade in pro baseball and has pitched at times for the Puerto Rico national baseball team. He is currently the pitching coach for the Brooklyn Cyclones. Career Playing career Matos was picked in the 27th round of the 1996 amateur draft by the Seattle Mariners as a draft- and-follow selection. The right-hander spent a season at junior college then made his pro debut in 1997 with the AZL Mariners (1-0, Sv, 4.17, 50 K, 6 BB in 45 IP) and Everett AquaSox (2.08 in 2 G). The right-hander returned to the AZL Mariners for '98 and went 3-0 with a 2.20 ERA in 17 games, fanning 51 batters in 41 innings while giving up just 29 hits. In 1999, the Mayag√ºez native became a starter and was 9-9 with a 4.63 ERA for the Wisconsin Timber Rattlers; he struck out over 3 times as many as he walked and averaged nearly a K per inning. In the winter of 1999‚Äì2000, Josue had a 3-3, 2.79 record for the San Juan Senators of the Puerto Rican League. Returning to the US, he split time between the Lancaster JetHawks (3-3, 2.64, 93 K in 88 IP) and New Haven Ravens (4-5, 3.63). Matos' rise was slowed in 2001 as he missed a full season due to injury. He returned in 2002 to pitch for the San Antonio Missions (1-0, 4.91 in 3 G) and Tacoma Rainiers (4-7, 5.92, .300 average allowed), struggling in his AAA debut. In '03, Josue returned to the bullpen, where he excelled for San Antonio, going 7-2 with 4 saves and a 2.24 ERA in 48 outings. He held opponents to a .187 average and fanned 104 in 88 IP.

It is not known who originally built the castle but in 1146, it was captured by Cadell ap Gruffydd, Prince of Deheubarth, however he was incapacitated as ruler of Deheubarth five years later when he was attacked while out hunting by a Norman force from Tenby, and was left for dead. At the time, Totnes Priory held St Peter's Church at Lampeter, and the original grantor may have been Stephen, constable of Cardigan. The castle was the site of several battles. Until the Statute of Wales in 1284, Lampeter was fiercely contested between the English and the Welsh because it was on a trade route that both sides wanted to control.

After his student years in G√∂ttingen, Miller was active in Ulm and its surroundings: from 1780 onwards as a pastor, from 1781 as a teacher in the local high school, and from 1783 as a cathedral preacher in the Minster of Ulm. In 1804 he became a consistorial councillor, in 1809 a district deacon, and in 1810 a spiritual councillor and deacon for Ulm.Bernhard Appenzeller.

On 11 December 1776 he was elected a fellow-craft. In 1775 he helped found the Zur goldenen Kugel lodge in Hamburg. For a long time he was speaker at the Astr√§a zu den 3 Ulmen lodge in Ulm (which was shut during the period 1795-1807).Matrikel der Loge Zum goldenen Zirkel im Geh.

This town is located on the all-weather road to Goba built during the Italian occupation, 56 km south of Asella, and 50 km east of Lake Langano (the road from Assela through Goba and south to Dodola is now in 2013 tarmac all the way to Goba). A local landmark is the church of Liemu Maryam, east of Bekoji.\\"Local History in Ethiopia\\", The Nordic Africa Institute website (Internet Archive mirror) Bekoji is also known as the home town of many famous Ethiopian athletes. They include: Derartu Tulu, Fatuma Roba, Tiki Gelana, Mestawet Tufa, the Bekele brothers (Kenenisa and Tariku) and the Dibaba sisters Ejegayehu, Tirunesh and Genzebe. Young athletes in Bekoji are featured in the 2012 documentary film Town of Runners.  History  Besides building a road from Asella to Bekoji, during the occupation the Italians also built a small fort outside the town. After Asela had been captured in April 1941, Henfrey's Scouts (a small force of Ethiopian irregulars) continued south to capture Bekoji supported by armored cars. Because of heavy mud, increasing rains and a shortage of fuel, only a small unit reached the outpost at Bekoji. The Baptist General Conference operated a mission station at Bekoji, performing medical work during the 1950s. By 1965, Bekoji contained the woreda governor's office, associated administrative buildings, and some local security facilities. There was all-weather road connection and telephone link to Asella. The major market day was Saturday, and a minor market was held on Tuesday. Trade centered on crops, livestock, seeds and foodstuffs. Most of the commercial buildings were drinking establishments. The Chilalo Agricultural Development Union established a marketing centre here in 1970. Ingvar Jonsson made field interviews with farmers in the area between July 1973 and May 1974. He reported that about 90% of all interviewed tenants had sharecropping agreement, with rent to the landowner ranging between one third and one half of the crop. Studying aerial photos, Jonsson concluded 94 households had been removed from Bekoji while 282 new households had been established.

Road to independence 1985-1991 In the new political conditions created after 1985 by the glasnost policy introduced by Mikhail Gorbachev, in 1986, to support the perestroika (restructuring), a Democratic Movement of Moldova () was formed, which in 1989 became known as the pro-nationalist Popular Front of Moldova (PFM; ). Horia C. Matei, \\"State lumii.

On 29 July 1989 a pro-reform Communist Mircea Snegur was appointed Chairman of the Presidium of Supreme Soviet of Moldavia (Speaker of the Parliament). On 27 August 1989, the PFM organized a mass demonstration in Chi≈üinƒÉu, that became known as the Great National Gathering (), which pressured the authorities of the Moldavian Soviet Socialist Republic to adopt on 31 August 1989 a language law that proclaimed the Moldovan language written in the Latin script to be the state language of the Moldavian SSR.Legea cu privire la functionarea limbilor vorbite pe teritoriul RSS Moldovenesti Nr.3465-XI din 01.09.89 Vestile nr.9/217, 1989 (Law regarding the usage of languages spoken on the territory of the Republic of Moldova): \\"Moldavian SSR supports the desire of the Moldovans that live across the borders of the Republic, and considering the existing linguistic Moldo-Romanian identity‚Äîof the Romanians that live on the territory of the USSR, of doing their studies and satisfying their cultural needs in their native language.\\"Civil unrest began on 7 November 1989, in Chi≈üinƒÉu, Moldavian SSR and continued on 10 November, when protesters burned down the headquarters of the Ministry of Internal Affairs, led by Vladimir Voronin. Festivals on 7 November 1989 commemorating the October Revolution and 10 November celebrating the Soviet police force offered excellent opportunities for opposition to challenge authorities in highly visible settings and disrupt events of premiere importance to the Soviet regime. Popular Front of Moldova activists, often going beyond the official sanction of the movement leadership, organized actions that embarrassed the republican leadership, ultimately resulted in riots in central Chi≈üinƒÉu. This unrest sealed the fate of the increasingly weak First Secretary of the Communist Party of Moldova. At the end of a year that had seen Semion Grossu and his organization pummeled from both the national revivalist right and the \\"ultrarevolutionary\\" internationalist left, Moscow replaced the First Secretary with Petru Lucinschi in a snap Central Committee plenum on 16 November 1989.Publika TV, File din istorie: 1989 - anul anti-7noiembrie la Chi≈üinƒÉu The first partly free elections into the Moldovan parliament were held in February and March 1990. On 27 April 1990 pro-reform Communist Mircea Snegur was re-elected as Speaker of the Parliament (Chairman of the Supreme Soviet of Moldavia), and on 26 May 1990 Mircea Druc of the Popular Front of Moldova became Prime-Minister in a watershed moment as the CPSU lost power in the Moldavian SSR. On 23 June 1990, the Parliament adopted the Declaration of Sovereignty which among other things stipulated the supremacy of Moldovan laws over those of the Soviet Union, and formally changed the name of the republic from Moldavian SSR to Moldovan SSR. Mircea Snegur was elected president of Moldova on 3 September 1990 by the Parliament and pushes for independence. On 23 May 1991, the name of the state is again changed into the current Republic of Moldova. After the failure of the 19‚Äì21 August 1991 Soviet coup d'√©tat attempt, Moldova declared its independence on 27 August 1991, which was recognized the same day by Romania, and afterwards by numerous other countries. President Mircea Snegur's opposition to immediate reunification with Romania led to a split with the Moldovan Popular Front in October 1991 and to his decision to run as an independent candidate in the 8 December 1991 presidential election. Running unopposed, he won after the Popular Front's efforts to organize a voter boycott failed. On 21 December 1991 Moldova, along with most of the former Soviet republics, signed the constitutive act that formed the post-Soviet Commonwealth of Independent States (CIS). Declaring itself a neutral state, it did not join the military branch of the CIS. Three months later, on 2 March 1992, the country achieved formal recognition as an independent state at the United Nations. Transnistrian conflict Transnistrian region of Moldova In 1992, Moldova became involved in a brief conflict against local insurgents in Transnistria, who were aided by locally stationed Russian armed forces and Don Cossacks, which resulted in the failure of Moldova to regain control over the breakaway republic. A ceasefire for this war was negotiated by presidents Mircea Snegur and Boris Yeltsin in July 1992. A demarcation line was to be maintained by a tripartite peacekeeping force (composed of Moldovan, Russian, and Transnistrian forces), and Moscow agreed to withdraw its 14th Army in parallel with finding a permanent solution for Transnistrian conflict. Also, Transnistria would have a special status within Moldova and would have the right to secede if Moldova changed its statehood,Hughes, James and Sasse, Gwendolyn. Ethnicity and Territory in the Former Soviet Union: Regions in Conflict, p.109. Taylor & Francis (2002), for instance by uniting with Romania.Olga Savceac, Transnistria-Moldova Conflict, ICE Case Studies Number 182, May 2006 However, in subsequent talks the Transnistrian authorities declined this offer, setting course for continued independence instead. As of 2019, this conflict remains unresolved. In the region east of the Dniester river, Transnistria, which includes a large proportion of Russophone ethnic Russians and Ukrainians (as of 1989, 51%, as opposed to only 40% ethnic Moldovans), and where the headquarters and many units of the Soviet Guards 14th Army were stationed, an independent \\"Transdnestrian Moldovan Republic\\" (TMR) was proclaimed on 16 August 1990, with its capital in Tiraspol. The motives behind this move were fear of the rise of nationalism in Moldova and the country's expected reunification with Romania upon secession from the USSR. In the winter of 1991-1992 clashes occurred between Transnistrian forces, supported by elements of the 14th Army, and the Moldovan police. Between 2 March and 26 July 1992, the conflict escalated into a military engagement. Negotiations held during the conflict between Russia, Ukraine, Romania, and Moldova did not produce any practical results. After a series of direct negotiations facilitated by Russia, an agreement was reached between Moldova and Transnistria. Russian military stationed in the region (14th Army) were removed from the main part of Moldova by January 1993, but remain to this day east of the Dniester in the breakaway region, despite signing international obligations to withdraw, and against the will of Moldovan government.Statement by H.E. Mr. Andrei Stratan at the General Debate of the Sixty Second Session of the UN General Assembly, New-York, 1 October 2007 : \\"I would like to reiterate on this occasion the position of the Republic of Moldova according to which the withdrawal of the Russian troops that remain on the Moldovan territory against its will, in conformity with the obligations assumed by the Russian Federation in 1999 in Istanbul, would create the necessary premises for ratifying and applying the Adapted CFE Treaty.\\" Jamestown: \\"Moldovan President wants out of Russia's orbit\\" One such obligation was undertaken at the 1999 OSCE summit in Istanbul to withdraw the Russian troops and ammunition within 3 years, a promise reiterated at the next summit in Porto in 2003. After 1992, Romania and Ukraine were excluded from the diplomatic activity aimed to solve the Transnistrian crisis. Later, the Organization for Security and Co-operation in Europe (OSCE) was included, and the Ukraine wes re-included. The postwar status quo remains to this day: Chi≈üinƒÉu offers a large autonomy, while Tiraspol demands independence. De jure, Transnistria is internationally recognized as part of Moldova, but de facto, the authorities in Chi≈üinƒÉu do not exercise any control over that territory. Transition to market economy On 2 January 1992, Moldova introduced the market reforms, of which included price liberalization. This resulted in a 2,600% inflation in 1992, and a further 700% inflation in 1993. From 1992 till 2001, the young country suffered its worst economic crisis that left most of the population below the poverty line. In 1993, a new national currency, the Moldovan leu was introduced to replace the Soviet ruble. The end of the planned economy meant also that the industrial enterprises would have to buy supplies and sell their goods by themselves, and most of the management was not prepared for such a change. Moldova undertook a privatisation plan which was effective in the transfer of the ownership of houses to the people. The attempted privatization of production means did not boost the economy as it was desired. International financial institutions, judging the apparent presence of landmarks indicating a modern developed society in 1992, have overestimated the capacity of Moldova's economy and government to withstand the transition to market economy, and imposed the country to open its market to outside goods without implementation of any effective action to support internal production. As a result, Moldova's industry, especially machine building, became all but defunct, and unemployment skyrocketed. The economic fortunes of Moldova began to change in 2001; since then the country has seen a steady annual growth of between 5% and 10%. Early 2000s also saw a considerable growth of emigration of Moldovans looking for work (mostly illegally) in Italy, Portugal, Spain, Greece, Cyprus, Turkey, and other countries, in addition to work in Russia. One of the reasons for this was that in 1991, 1.3 million Moldovans, or ca. 60% of the workforce, were employed in agriculture, which normally does not require such a large number of people. Remittances from Moldovans abroad account for ca. 30% of Moldova's GDP, the largest percentage in Europe. Officially, Moldova's annual GDP is of the order of $1,000 per capita, however a significant part of the economy goes unregistered due to corruption. Political developments in 1990s Moldova's transition to democracy was initially impeded by an ineffective Parliament, the lack of a new constitution, a separatist movement led by the Gagauz (Christian Turkic) minority in the south, and unrest in the Transnistria region on the left bank of the Dniester river, where a separatist movement assisted by uniformed Russian military forces in the region and led by supporters of the 1991 coup attempt in Moscow declared a \\"Dniester republic\\". Progress has been made on all these fronts. In 1992, the government negotiated a cease-fire arrangement with Russian and Transnistrian officials (although tensions continue) and negotiations are ongoing. In February 1994, new legislative elections were held, and the ineffective Parliament that had been elected in 1990 to a 5-year term was replaced. A new constitution was adopted in July 1994. The conflict with the Gagauz minority was defused by the granting of local autonomy in 1994. The pro-nationalist governments of prime- ministers Mircea Druc (25 May 1990 ‚Äì 28 May 1991), and Valeriu Muravschi (28 May 1991 ‚Äì 1 July 1992), were followed by a more moderate government of Andrei Sangheli, which saw the removal of most reform-oriented individuals. and the decline of the pro-Romanian nationalist sentiment.Helen Fedor, ed. Moldova: A Country Study. Government. Washington: GPO for the Library of Congress, 1995. Mircea Snegur and Manfred W√∂rner signing Moldova's Partnership for Peace with NATO (1994) In December 1991, an ex-communist reformer, Mircea Snegur, ran an unopposed election for the presidency. On 2 March 1992, the country achieved formal recognition as an independent state at the United Nations. The Soviet system was falling apart quickly, and Moldovan leadership decided to rely on itself to bring the breakaway Transnistria back under its control. In April 1992, the Parliament formed a Ministry of Defense, and Moldova began to organize its own armed forces. The February 1994 Parliamentary elections were conducted peacefully and received good ratings from international observers for their fairness. Prime Minister Andrei Sangheli was re-elected to his post in March 1994, as was Petru Lucinschi to his post as speaker of the Parliament. Authorities in Transnistria, refused to allow balloting there and discouraged the local population from participating; only some 7,500 inhabitants voted at specially established precincts in right-bank Moldova. Inhabitants of the Gagauz separatist region did participate in the elections, however. In the February 1994 elections, only four of the dozens of political parties surpassed the 4% threshold. The new Parliament, with its Democratic Agrarian Party of Moldova majority, did not face the same gridlock that characterized the old Parliament with its majority of Popular Front hard-line nationalists. A new government was formed by Andrei Sangheli of the Democratic Agrarian Party. A March 1994 referendum saw an overwhelming majority of voters favoring continued independence. Following the elections, the Parliament ratified the Commonwealth of Independent States accession treaty, modified the national anthem from De≈üteaptƒÉ-te, rom√¢ne to Limba noastrƒÉ, adopted a new constitution that called the official language Moldova as opposed to Romanian (as it was called in 1991-93), and adopted other measures that distanced Moldova from Romania. The new Moldovan Constitution also provided for autonomy for Transnistria and Gagauzia. On 23 December 1994, the Parliament of Moldova adopted a \\"Law on the Special Legal Status of Gagauzia\\", and in 1995 it was constituted. Russia and Moldova signed an agreement in October 1994 on the withdrawal of Russian troops from Transnistria, but the Russian government did not ratify it; another stalemate ensued. Although the cease-fire remained in effect, further negotiations that included the Conference on Security and Cooperation in Europe and the United Nations made little progress. In 1994, Moldova became a member of NATO Partnership for Peace. On 29 June 1995, Moldova became a member of the Council of Europe. In March and April 1995, Moldovan college and secondary school students participated in a series of strikes and demonstrations in Chi≈üinƒÉu to protest the government's cultural and educational policies. The students were joined by others protesting for economic reasons. The most emotional issue was that of the national language - whether it should be called Moldovan, as named in the 1994 constitution, or Romanian. In a 27 April speech to the Parliament, President Snegur asked the Parliament to amend the constitution and change the name of the language to Romanian. The government's final decision was postponed until the fall of 1995 because of the stipulation that six months must pass before a proposed change to the constitution can be made. The student demonstrators declared a moratorium on further strikes until 6 September. The 1996 attempt by President Snegur to change the official language to \\"Romanian\\" was dismissed by the Moldovan Parliament as \\"promoting Romanian expansionism\\". In the presidential elections of 1996, parliamentary speaker Petru Lucinschi surprised with an upset victory over the incumbent, Mircea Snegur, in a second round of balloting. The elections were judged as free and fair by international observers. After winning the presidential elections of 1996, on 15 January 1997, Petru Lucinschi, the former First Secretary of the Moldavian Communist Party in 1989-91 became the country's second president. President Lucinschi did manage to institute some very controversial reforms (perhaps the United States Assistance for International Development-funded \\"PƒÉm√Ænt\\" land privatization program was the most controversial). Indeed, his tenure was marked by constant legislative struggles with Moldova's Parliament. Several times, the Parliament considered votes of no confidence in the president's government, and a succession of moderate, pro-Western reform prime ministers were dismissed by a Parliament that increasingly favored the growing Communist Party faction. The Partnership and Cooperation Agreement with the European Union (EU) came into force in July 1998 for an initial period of ten years. It established the institutional framework for bilateral relations, set the principal common objectives, and called for activities and dialogue in a number of policy areas. At the 1999 OSCE summit, Russia signed an agreement to withdraw its troops from Transnistria by 1 January 2002. However, it has yet to follow through on this pledge. Moldova's previous two presidents, Mircea Snegur and Petru Lucinschi were respectively President of the Republican Supreme Soviet and Republican Communist Party First Secretary during the Soviet Period. Both served as Politburo members, and Luchinschi was a member of the CC of CPSU. Alliance for Democracy and Reforms 1998-2001 Petru Lucinschi, Moldova's second president (1996-2001) After winning the presidential elections of 1996, on 15 January 1997, Petru Lucinschi, the former First Secretary of the Moldavian Communist Party in 1989‚Äì91, became the country's second president. At the legislative elections on 22 March 1998, the Party of Communists of the Republic of Moldova, which was re-legalized in 1994 after being banned in 1991, gained 40 of the 101 places in the Parliament, but was reduced to opposition when an Alliance for Democracy and Reforms was formed by the Democratic Convention of Moldova (26 MPs), Movement for a democratic and Prosperous Moldova (24 MPs), and Party of Democratic Forces (11 MPs). However, activity of the new government of prime-minister Ion Ciubuc (24 January 1997 ‚Äì 1 February 1999), was marked by chronic political instability, which prevented a coherent reform program. The Alliance for Democracy and Reforms was the first coalition government in the history of Moldova. Foreign policy was marked by a duality of belonging to the Commonwealth of Independent States and steps towards a rapprochement with Western Europe. The ruble crisis of 1998 in Russia, Moldova's main economic partner at the time, produced an economic crisis in the country. Moldova received an International Monetary Fund special mission advising the government on how to cope with the effects of the Russian crisis. Russia bought at that time 85% of Moldova's wine and brandy and most of its canned goods and tobacco. After the rouble crashed, most Russian importers put deals with Moldova on hold. Moldovan president Petru Lucinschi was quoted as saying that the Russian crisis had cost Moldova as much as five per cent of its GDP. The country's parliament was discussing a programme aimed at reducing imports and searching for new markets outside Russia. Privatization was stalled, the Moldovan leu lost 60% with respect to the US dollar within a year (August 1998-July 1999), an energy crisis swept through the country, wages and pensions were paid with a considerable delay of several months, corruption extended. The level of life plunged, with 75% of population living below the poverty line, while the economic disaster caused 600,000 people to leave the country. This eventually resulted in the interruption of relations with the International Monetary Fund. In economic terms, the 1998 crisis provoked an emigration of labor, as well as permanent emigration from Moldova. According to the census data, from 1989 to 2004, Moldova has lost about 400,000 inhabitants, or 9% of the population. Analysts estimate that actual emigration could be higher, as many seasonal workers remain registered as living in the country. After the acting government of Serafim Urechean (5‚Äì17 February 1999), new governments were formed by Ion Sturza ( 19 ‚Äì 9 February November 1999) and Dumitru Braghi≈ü (21 December 1999 ‚Äì 19 April 2001). On 21 July 2000, the Parliament adopted an amendment to the Constitution that transformed Moldova from a presidential to a parliamentary republic, in which the president is elected by 3/5 of the votes in the parliament, and no longer directly by the people. Later in 2000, when Parliament failed three times to elect a new president, Petru Lucinschi exercised his right to dissolve Parliament, calling for new parliamentary elections. However, since no single candidate was able to garner a majority of votes, Lucinschi temporarily remained president. Disagreements that appeared within the Alliance for Democracy and Reforms, caused to some degree by displeasure with seat distributions, led to its disintegration and an overwhelming Party of Communists victory in 2001 parliamentary election. In the next decade, the Party of Communists used very successfully the incoherent activity of the Alliance for Democracy and Reforms for the discreditation of any form of political coalition formed without Communists. Their criticisms of the Alliance For European Integration is a good example. Communists governance 2001-2009 Vladimir Voronin, third President of Moldova (2001-2009) Widespread popular dissatisfaction with the government, the economy, and the reforms, however, led to a surprise at the polls in February 2001. In elections certified by international observers as free and fair, Moldova's populace voted overwhelmingly for the communists. The communist faction, which had previously occupied 40 of the Parliament's 101 seats since they were legally allowed to exist in 1998, jumped to 71 - a clear majority. Communist deputies were then able to elect Vladimir Voronin, the leader of their faction, as President. Voronin, previously served as an official of the Moldovan Communist Party Central Committee, as well as First Secretary of the Bender City Party Committee and Minister of Internal Affairs. Only 3 of the 31 political parties passed the 6% threshold of the 25 February 2001 elections. Winning 49.9% of the vote, the Party of Communists gained 71 of the 101 MPs, and on 4 April 2001, elected Vladimir Voronin as the country's third president. A new government was formed on 19 April 2001 by Vasile Tarlev. The country became the first post-Soviet state where a non-reformed Communist Party comes back to power. Since his election, President Voronin has proceeded with Lucinschi's plans to privatize several important state-owned industries, and even has on occasion broken with his own party over important issues. He also repeatedly announced plans to introduce measures to promote land consolidation in the countryside, a move outside observers have dubbed \\"recollectivization.\\" However, under President Voronin, relations with Romania have, at times, worsened. Tensions arose when the President tried to introduce Russian as a second national language as well as insist that the Moldovan state language be called Moldovan. The Romanian language in Moldova has come to be called \\"Moldovan\\", prompting a long controversy whether the language is identical or closely resembles Romanian. In 2007 the Moldovan government did not allow Romania to open two consulates in major cities of Moldova, BƒÉl≈£i and Cahul, that were intended to simplify the acquisition of Romanian visas for the Moldovan population.. In March‚ÄìApril 2002, in Chi≈üinƒÉu, several mass protests took place against the plans of the government to fulfil its electoral promise and introduce Russian as the second state language along with its compulsory study in schools. The government mainly renounced these plans, but Russian was eventually re-introduced as a compulsory subject in Moldovan schools, albeit only 1 to 2 hours per week. Demonstrations in Chi≈üinƒÉu in 2003 An attempt at re-introduction of Russian into Moldovan schools caused protests in the center of ChisinƒÉu, led by the nationalist Christian-Democratic People's Party, and was aborted as the movement lost momentum. The Communist party has also attracted much criticism over the increasingly authoritarian rule in Chi≈üinƒÉu. Relationship between Moldova and Russia deteriorated in November 2003 over a Russian proposal for the solution of the Transnistrian conflict, which Moldovan authorities refused to accept due to political pressure from the West, since it stipulated a 20-year Russian military presence in Moldova. The federalization of Moldova would have also turned Transnistria and Gagauzia into a blocking minority over all major policy matters of Moldova. In the wake of the November 2003 deadlock with Russia, a series of shifts in the external policy of Moldova occurred, targeted at rapprochement with the European Union. In the context of the EU's expansion to the east, Moldova wants to sign a Stabilization and Association Agreement, and demands an Individual Action Plan to accede to the EU. A national commission for European integration was created in June 2003, and in November 2003 all three political parties present in the parliament adopted a common declaration stating a pro-European orientation of Moldova. Since 1999, Moldova has affirmed its desire to join the European Union,Moldpres:\\"Voronin highlighted, that we will strive for becoming an EU member\\"Itar-Tass and implement its first three-year Action Plan within the framework of the European Neighborhood Policy (ENP) of the EU.Moldova-EU Action Plan Approved by European Commission , http://www.azi.md, 14 December 2004. Retrieved 2 July 2007EU/MOLDOVA ACTION PLAN Analysts claim that, in fact, Moldova did not manage to fully implement the Action Plan and instead of positive ideas it was constantly sending to Brussels contradictory signals about its commitment to implement reforms.Ion Marandici, De a raportul Comisiei Europene la viitorul Acord cu UE, Timpul, nr. 45, 28 March 2008. See: http://europa.timpul.md/Article.asp?idIssue=179&idRubric;=2146&idArticle;=5509 On 19 December 2003, the Parliament passed a Law of Nationalities, which made a controversial distinction between a Moldovan majority and a Romanian minority (a historically, ethnically, and linguistically contentious distinction). In the 2004 population census, first since independence, of the 2,638,125 Moldovans and Romanians (78.3% of the country's population), 2,564,850 (97.2%) were registered as Moldovans and 73,276 (2.8%) as Romanians (94.9%, resp. 5.1% in urban areas, and 98.4%, resp. 1.6% in rural areas). 2,012,542 or 76.3% of them called native language Moldovan (58.9% in urban areas and 84.8% in rural ones), and 552,920 or 21.0% of them called it Romanian (34.3% in urban areas and 14.4% in rural ones). In the summer of 2004, Transnistrian authorities forcibly closed four Moldovan schools in Tiraspol, Bender, and R√Æbni≈£a that used the Romanian language in the Latin alphabet. This caused an increase in tensions between the Moldova and the breakaway province, which resulted in Moldova and Transnistria imposing economic sanctions on each other. The conflict was resolved later that year with Transnistrian authorities granting the establishments the status of privately funded schools. In the following election of 2005, the Party of the Communists was re-elected on a pro-Western platform, stressing the need for European integration. Later that year the Moldovan Parliament re-elected Voronin to a second term as president. Moldovan authorities denied entry to a Russian organization (CIS-EMO), that Russia said was to monitor the elections for fairness; some members of the organization who nevertheless entered the country were deported. As a consequence, Russian-Moldovan ties weakened greatly, and the nation was split between building relations with the West or with Russia. In the 6 March 2005 elections, the Communist Party won 46% of the vote, (56 of the 101 seats in the Parliament), Democratic Moldova Block won 28.5% of the vote (34 MPs), and the Christian Democratic People Party (CDPP) won 9.1% (11 MPs). On 4 April 2005, Vladimir Voronin was re-elected as country's president, supported by a part of the opposition, and on 8 April Vasile Tarlev was again charged as head of government. Several major shifts produced in the political scene of Moldova since 2005. At first most of the opposition supported Vladimir Voronin, who was regarded as changed from being pro-Russian to being pro-Western, but this was changed largely after Voronin launched a sustained verbal campaign (in press, in official declarations, and at European fora) against Romanians and Romania, whom he blames for stealing Moldova's citizens (ca. 100,000 Moldovans have also Romanian citizenship, and other 800,000 are waiting in line). The government was formed by the Party of the Communists, supported parliamentary by CDPP (deserted by many members because of that) and mostly (not always) by the Democratic Party of Moldova. The major opposition parties include Party Alliance Our Moldova, Liberal Party, whose candidate Dorin ChirtoacƒÉ won on 17 June 2007 the elections for the mayor of the capital Chi≈üinƒÉu, and Liberal Democratic Party of Moldova. As of 2006, approximately 1,200 of the 14th army personnel remained stationed in Transnistria. In the last years, negotiations between the Transnistrian and Moldovan leaders have been going on under the mediation of the OSCE, Russia, and Ukraine; lately observers from the European Union and the United States have become involved as observers, creating a 5+2 format. In the March 2005 elections, the Party of the Communists (PCRM) won 46% of the vote, (56 of the 101 seats in the Parliament), Democratic Moldova Block (BMD) won 28.5% of the vote (34 MPs), and the Christian Democratic People Party (PPCD) won 9.1% (11 MPs). On 4 April 2005, Vladimir Voronin was re-elected as country's president, supported by a part of the opposition, and on 8 April, Vasile Tarlev was again charged as head of government. On 31 March 2008, Vasile Tarlev was replaced by Zinaida Grecean√Æi as head of the government. Since Romania joined the European Union in 2007 and imposed a visa requirement for Moldovan citizens, as many as 800,000 Moldovan citizens have applied for Romanian citizenship (anyone with at least one grandparent who was a Romanian citizen in 1940 can apply for Romanian citizenship). On 18 November 2008, NATO Parliamentary Assembly adopted Resolution 371 on the future of NATO-Russia relations, with among other things, \\"urges the government and the parliament of Russia to respect its commitments which were taken at the Istanbul OSCE Summit in 1999 and has to withdraw its illegal military presence from the Transdnestrian region of Moldova in the nearest future.\\" Pro-European coalitions in power 2009 to date Protests in Chi≈üinƒÉu after the April 2009 elections A parliamentary election was held in Moldova on 5 April 2009. The Party of Communists of the Republic of Moldova (PCRM) won a majority of seats (60 out of 101) for the third consecutive occasion. Turnout was 59.49 percent, exceeding the 50% necessary for the election to be valid. The new parliament had to elect a new President of Moldova as the incumbent Vladimir Voronin had to stand down after completing two terms.BBC: \\"Communists win Moldovan election\\", 6 April 2009 The EU had called on Moldova to reform its electoral law, which foresees an electoral threshold of 6% and makes little allowance for alliances of smaller parties, so that smaller parties might also enter parliament, but President Vladimir Voronin had rejected such calls.\\"Moldova Rejects EU Proposal To Change Election Law\\", Radio Free Europe/Radio Liberty, 3 December 2008. Final results were announced on 8 April 2009; the ruling PCRM failed to gain the 61 seats required to elect the president, leaving the opposition parties with the possibility of forcing a new election. The ballot recount performed on 21 April confirmed these results. Protest riots in front of the Parliament of Moldova,7 April 2009 A wave of civil unrest began on 7 April 2009, in major cities of Moldova (including the capital Chi≈üinƒÉu and BƒÉl≈£i) after the results of the election were announced. The demonstrators claimed that the elections, in which the governing PCRM was early reported to win a majority of seats, were fraudulent, and alternatively demanded a recount, a new election, or resignation of the government. Similar demonstrations took place in other major Moldovan cities, including the country's second largest, BƒÉl≈£i, where over 7,000 people protested. The protesters organized themselves using an online social network service, Twitter, hence its moniker used by the media, the Twitter Revolution\\"Twitter Revolution: Fearing Uprising, Russia Backs Moldova's Communists\\", Spiegel, 10 April 2009\\"Moldova's \\"Twitter Revolution\\"\\", RFE/RL, 8 April 2009 or Grape revolution. In Chi≈üinƒÉu, where the number of protesters rose above 15,000, the demonstration escalated into a riot on 7 April. Rioters attacked the parliament building and presidential office, breaking windows, setting furniture on fire and stealing property. The protest resulted in four deaths, 270 injured and several people jailed, among allegations of use of torture by the police, and a diplomatic row with Romania, after President Voronin accused Romania of being the force behind the riots in Chi≈üinƒÉu. After the civil unrest, the climate in Moldova became very polarized. The parliament failed to elect a new president. For this reason, the parliament was dissolved and snap elections were held. The 29 July polls were won by the Communist Party with 44.7% of the vote. That gave the former ruling party 48 MPs, and the remaining 53 seats in the 101-member chamber went to four opposition parties. Opposition parties agreed to create the Alliance for European Integration that pushed the Communist Party into opposition. The Communists were in government since 2001. In the July 2009 Moldovan parliamentary election, the Party of Communists, gained around 45% of the vote, whilst the other four parties which won seats each gained from around 7% to 16%. However, combined, the opposition parties to the Communists secured a greater percentage of the vote, and are now in discussion over forming a coalition. This has led some commentators to declare the election a loss for the Communists. In August 2009, four Moldovan parties ‚Äì Liberal Democratic Party, Liberal Party, Democratic Party, and Our Moldova Alliance ‚Äì agreed to create a governing coalition that will push the Communist Party into opposition. The name of the coalition was Alliance for European Integration. An subsequent attempt by the ruling coalition to amend the constitution of Moldova via a referendum in 2010 in order to enable presidential election by popular vote has failed to meet the 33% turnout required. The Constitutional Court of Moldova therefore ruled that acting president of Moldova, Mihai Ghimpu had to dissolve the parliament and hold new elections.Actmedia.eu: Mihai Ghimpu will dissolve Moldova‚Äôs Parliament next week, 22 September 2010. A parliamentary election was held in Moldova on 28 November 2010 after indirect presidential elections failed for the second time in late 2009. The Communists won 42 seats, while the Liberal-Democrats won 32, the Democratic Party won 15, and the Liberals won 12. This gave the Alliance for European Integration 59 seats, 2 short of the 61 needed to elect a President. The result thus maintained the status quo following the contemporaneous constitutional deadlock. Observers from the OSCE and the Council of Europe lauded the election. In December, the prime minister Vlad Filat of the Liberal Democrats was able to secure a parliamentary majority, with the support of the Liberals and of the Democratic Party, whose leader Marian Lupu was appointed temporary speaker of the Parliament, and thus also acting head of state.EU Observer, 31 December 2010 On 16 March 2012, parliament elected Nicolae Timofti as president by 62 votes out of 101, with the PCRM boycotting the election, putting an end to a political crisis that had lasted since April 2009.Washington Post, Moldova elects pro-European judge Timofti as president, ending 3 years of political deadlock On 30 May 2013 the Alliance for European Integration was succeeded by the Pro-European Coalition with Iurie LeancƒÉ becoming Prime Minister.

After buying his freedom in 1845 from Daniel Webster, Jennings is noted for publishing in 1865 the first White House memoir. His book was A Colored Man's Reminiscences of James Madison, described as \\"a singular document in the history of slavery and the early American republic.\\"Annette Gordon-Reed, \\"Foreword\\", to Elizabeth Dowling Talyor, A Slave in the White House: Paul Jennings and the Madisons, New York: Palgrave Macmillan, 2012 Living in Washington, DC from 1837 on, Jennings made many useful connections and was aided by the northern Republican Senator Daniel Webster in gaining freedom. In the 1850s, Jennings traveled to Virginia, where he tracked down his children, who had grown up on a neighboring plantation with his late wife Fanny, also a slave. His relatives on his mother's side were sold by the widow Dolley Madison with Montpelier in 1844. His three sons joined the Union cause during the American Civil War. In 2009 his descendants were honored at Montpelier following a lecture on Jennings. They were also invited to a private viewing at the White House of the Gilbert Stuart portrait of George Washington, which Jennings helped save during the War of 1812 and the British burning of the Capitol. Early life and education Jennings was born into slavery at Montpelier in 1799; his mother, who was African-Native American, was owned by the Madisons. She told the boy his father was Benjamin Jennings, an English trader. The mixed-race slave as a child was a companion to Dolley's son Payne Todd.Gordon-Reed (2012), \\"Foreword\\" He began to serve James Madison as his footman and later was trained as his \\"body servant\\". At the age of 10, Jennings accompanied Madison and his family to the White House after the statesman's election as president. In his 1865 memoir, he noted that the East Room was yet unfinished from the first construction, most of the Washington streets were unpaved, and the city was \\"a dreary place\\" in those years. In 1814 during the Burning of Washington, as British troops were approaching the White House, Jennings at age 15, with two other men, reportedly helped save the noted Gilbert Stuart portrait of George Washington known as the Lansdowne portrait. Other White House slaves helped save such valuables as silver. (The portrait was returned to the White House, where it is the only surviving item from before the War of 1812.) Legend has it that he assisted First Lady Dolley Madison in this effort. In his memoir, Jennings wrote that a French cook and one other person did the physical work of taking down the painting. Post- White House years After the president ended his second term, the Madisons returned to Montpelier in 1817, bringing Jennings with them.\\"Chronology and Dolley Madison\\", The Dolley Madison Project. Virginia Center of Digital History. Retrieved 2012-02-02. He was 18 years old and continued to serve Madison as his valet for the rest of the president's life. Jennings married Fanny, a slave held on another plantation, and they had five children, who lived with their mother. Jennings was with Madison when he died in 1836. In 1837, the widow Dolley Madison took Jennings with her when she returned to Washington, DC to live in the winter seasons. He was forced to leave his family behind but was permitted to visit them occasionally. In 1841, she wrote her will, which would free Jennings after her death, the only slave whom she freed in her will. In Washington as an adult, Jennings saw a much broader community. Among its many free blacks at the time were descendants of slaves of the former presidents Washington, Jefferson, and Madison.Elizabeth Dowling Taylor, A Slave in the White House: Paul Jennings and the Madison, New York: Palgrave Macmillan, 2012, Chapter 1 Struggling financially, in 1844 Dolley Madison sold Montpelier and all its property, including its slaves, to raise money to live on. That year Fanny, Jennings' wife, died in Virginia. The following year, Dolley Madison hired out Jennings to President James Polk in Washington. Often slaves who were hired out got to keep a portion of their earnings, but she kept it all, as she was impoverished. Freedom Fearing for his future, Jennings tried to arrange a purchase price with Madison, but she sold him to an insurance agent for $200 in 1846. Six months later, Senator Daniel Webster intervened to buy him from the new owner for $120 and gave Jennings his freedom, for which he paid the senator in work. He entered the large free black community of Washington, which outnumbered slaves by three to one at the time. Mary Beth Corrigan, \\"The Legacy and Significance of a Failed Mass Slave Escape\\", H-Net Reviews: Josephine Pacheco, The Pearl: A Failed Slave Escape on the Potomac, April 2006, accessed 2009-01-12. In 1848, Jennings helped plan a mass escape of 77 slaves from Washington, DC on the schooner Pearl. It was the largest slave escape attempt in US history. In an effort funded by white abolitionists William L. Chaplin and Gerrit Smith, the free black community of Washington enlarged the escape, gathering tens of slaves willing to risk the 225-mile sailing journey to freedom in the North. The slaves were captured and returned to Washington after having been delayed by poor winds. Their owners quickly sold them to traders, and most were sold again in the Deep South. The freedom of some slaves, including the two Edmonson sisters, was purchased by families and friends. The Edmonsons were sponsored to go to school in New York State and later spoke at abolitionist lectures. The two white captains, Daniel Drayton and Edward Sayres, owner and pilot of the schooner Pearl, were convicted on multiple counts of aiding a slave escape and illegally transporting slaves. They served four years in jail before being pardoned by President Millard Fillmore. The following year, Jennings married again, to Desdemona Brooks, a free mulatto whose mother was white (according to slave law, children took the status of their mother). She lived in Alexandria, Virginia. Jennings returned to Virginia in the 1850s as a free-man, and was able to reunite with family he had been forced to leave years before. His three sons joined the Union cause during the American Civil War after escaping and joining Union lines. John, Franklin, William and daughter Mary later joined him in Washington and the area. After the war, Jennings worked at the newly established Pension Bureau, part of the Department of the Interior, to handle claims of veterans and soldiers' families. He made the acquaintance of John Brooks Russell, an antiquarian. Fascinated by Jennings' story of his years with Madison, Russell wrote it down and published it for him in January 1863 in The Historical Magazine and Notes and Queries Concerning the Antiquities, History and Biography of America, where Russell had been a contributor. He helped Jennings gain publication of his memoir as a book in 1865. It is considered the first White House memoir. A free man, Jennings bought a lot and built a house at 1804 L Street, NW. He had reunited with his children, and his son John lived with him. His daughter Mary lived next door with her two children. His sons Franklin and William also lived in the area. After Desdemona's death, Jennings married a third time in 1870, to Amelia Dorsey. He died in northwest Washington, D.C. at the age of 75 in 1874. He was buried at Columbian Harmony Cemetery in D.C. When that cemetery closed in 1959, Jennings' remains (along with others unclaimed by family members) were reinterred in a mass grave at National Harmony Memorial Park in Landover, Maryland. In his will, Jennings left his family his house and property in northwest Washington.

(19 November 1837 - 27 January 1900), was a Franciscan friar from Ireland who served as a missionary in Australia and possibly later the United States. He was a strong opponent of St. Mary of the Cross, foundress of the Sisters of St Joseph of the Sacred Heart and Australia's first saint. Early life He was born Hugh Horan in County Galway and upon been received into the Order of the Friars Minor on 17 March 1859, at St. Isidore's College in Rome, he took the name Charles. Returning to Ireland, in 1863 he was named titular Guardian of the abandoned friary of Bantry. In 1864 Horan was appointed guardian at Cashel. In 1866 he received another titular appointment, this time as guardian of the vacant friary at Meelick. He resided in Cork. On 26 November 1867 he was reappointed Guardian of Cashel.Fennessy, Ignatius. \\"Hugh Charles Horan of Galway and Mother Mary MacKillop\\", Journal of the Galway Archaeological and Historical Society, vol. 51, 1999, pp. 140‚Äì146. JSTOR At some point during these years he was stationed in Ennis. He was known as an eloquent preacher. Australia Horan left Ireland for Australia in 1868, in the company of his fellow friar, Laurence Bonaventure Sheil, OFM, the Bishop of Adelaide (1866-1872). The following year he was reported for over- consumption of alcohol. He acted as Sheil's Vicar General, though not formally appointed. After Sheil's death a feud developed between him and the Rev. Christopher Reynolds. As Reynolds was a friend of Mother Mary of the Cross, she became an object of Horan's ire. A divisive issue over jurisdiction and canonical authority among the Sisters of St. Joseph led to a meeting with Horan: > One Thursday evening, 21 September 1871, Horan told Mary MacKillop that the > bishop (who had called while she was out that day) wanted her to go to > another convent. She could not go that night and wanted to discuss matters > with the Sisters and the bishop as well. Horan told her that the bishop > would not see her and added, 'I suppose you won't go.' She answered: > 'Father, how can I under these circumstances.' Horan led her to believe that > she was excommunicated. The next morning the bishop arrived with four > priests and, in a ranting mood, amid the hysteria of some of the Sisters, > and with MacKillop kneeling down on her knees in the chapel, he > excommunicated her and sent her back into the world. Citing this account, Ignatius Fennessy stated that \\"‚Ä¶Horan was at least in part responsible for setting the spark to the bishop's short fuse.\\" Fennessy goes on to say that the entire business may have been based on a misunderstanding as Horan never claimed to have excommunicated her. When some of the Sisters - in the presence of Sheil - did not go to church the following day (believing that they had been excommunicated), he thought they were defying him. Sheil, however, lifted the penalty five months later from his deathbed. Later life A canonical visitation by the Secretary of the Sacred Congregation for the Propagation of the Faith took place in August 1872, after Sheil's death. He was succeeded in June 1873 by Reynolds, who later became the first Archbishop of Adelaide. By then Horan was in Castlemaine in the Diocese of Victoria. As a result of his investigations, the Secretary informed the Minister General of the Friars Minor that Horan should be recalled \\"for the greater tranquility of the region\\". Horan received his recall in August 1873.McCreanor, Sheila. Mary MacKillop 1873, ATF Press. 2017, p.11, n.41 Horan's life after Australia is unclear. He may have served in various dioceses in the United States for 15 years, from about 1876 on, apparently in Milwaukee, Wisconsin. He was back in Ireland by October 1892, dying at Limerick in 1900.

History Attackers started as an independent (\\"indie\\") studio but is now one of the companies that make up the large AV group, the Hokuto Corporation, which distributes Attackers video products through their DMM website. The Attackers studio released its first four videos (with themes of sexual violence and rape) in February 1997 on the Shark label numbered SHK-001 to SHK-004. Among early Attackers stars performing on the Shark label in the late 1990s were AV Idols Sally Yoshino, Ky≈çko Kazama and Yuri Komuro. The studio also started another imprint, Idea Pocket, to market its softer Angel series of cosplay videos which were first released in December 1998 including one, Angel 9, which starred Sally Yoshino. Idea Pocket later split off to become an independent company. The company specializes in videos portraying simulated rape, torture and bondage. \\"„É¨„Ç§„ÉóÂ∞ÇÈñÄ„É°„Éº„Ç´„Éº„Å®„Åó„Å¶„ÄåÊ≠ªÂ§úÊÇ™„Äç„ÄåÈæçÁ∏õ„Äç„É¨„Éº„Éô„É´„Åå‰∫∫Ê∞ó„ÅÆ„Ç¢„Çø„ÉÉ„Ç´„Éº„Ç∫„ÅÆ„Ç™„Éï„Ç£„Ç∑„É£„É´„Åß„Åô\\" The two main bondage genre labels are Jabaku (ËõáÁ∏õ) and Ryubaku (ÈæçÁ∏õ). The Jabaku series often stars well-known actresses and uses high production values and elaborate sets. The emphasis is on bondage and gagging with some light S&M.; The Ryubaku label was introduced in 2000 as a softer version of the Jabaku line with more consensual action and fantasy role-playing. The studio usually releases a total of about 10-15 original and compilation videos per month and by September 2011, the AV distributor DMM (a division of the Hokuto Corporation) listed over 1500 Attackers titles in their catalog. The general manager of the company is Michio Maruyama (‰∏∏Â±±ÈÅìÂ§Æ). Directors who have worked with the Attackers studio include [Jo]Style, Eitaro Haga and others. Series The company's \\"Les Noir\\" series consisted of 5 original videos released from December 2005 to March 2007 on the Attackers Inmad label plus a compilation video from July 2007 on the Attackers Best label. All dealt with lesbian sadomasochism and bondage (BDSM) themes and all starred Sakura Sakurada as a dominant woman forcing young girls into lesbian acts. All five videos were directed by former AV actress Yui Koike (Â∞èÊ±†„ÇÜ„ÅÑ). Its \\"Slave Island\\" series began in December 2005 with the release of on the Attackers Ryubaku label (RBD-045). The video, starring Syuri Himesaki, Ryoko Mizusaki & Ky≈çko Kazama, and directed by Kenzo Nagira, won the Attackers Award at the 2005 Moodyz Awards. A total of 12 original \\"Slave Island\\" videos were released between December 2005 and February 2008, all under the Attackers Ryubaku label. Two 8-hour compilation works were also released in October 2008 under the Attackers Best label. The plots involve girls being kidnapped by bogus recruiters and brought to an island where they are imprisoned and turned into sex slaves. The films depict a mixture of bondage, humiliation, simulated rape, forced fellatio and urination involving both lesbian and heterosexual sex. Moodyz Awards Beginning in 2004, Attackers took part in the annual December Moodyz Awards. In 2004 and 2005 the studio presented separate awards to its own staff but from 2006 they have taken part in the general awards process with several other Hokuto Corporation companies. AV Grand Prix Attackers was one of the studios participating in the 2008 AV Grand Prix with the video [AVGL-002] starring Rin Aoki, Megu Ayase & Rin Hayakawa, and directed by Katsuyuki Hasegawa. For the 2009 AV Grand Prix, the studio nominated the video [AVGL-102] with Yuuka Kokoro, Mari Hida, Kasumi, Rin Agazuma & Hiyori Wakakusa, and directed by HiroA.

He is known as an electric and acoustic guitarist but also records and performs on electric sitar, keyboards, and percussion. Since the 1990s, he has initiated and participated in several platforms aimed at combining the arts and sustainability. Biography At the age of 10, de Winkel picked up the Charango in La Paz, Bolivia where his father worked for the UN. He proceeded to teach himself guitar and jazz improvisation and attended the Hoch Conservatory in Frankfurt, Germany for a brief period. For the release of Mastertouch, he collaborated with Michael Brecker, Billy Cobham, Kai Eckhardt, Ernie Watts, Alphonse Mouzon, Hellmut Hattler, Joachim K√ºhn and various other instrumentalists, setting a new standard for young musicians both in regard to its open minded eclecticism and to its high level of transatlantic musical cooperation,Sandner, Wolfgang and others: Jazz in Frankfurt. Societ√§ts-Verlag, Frankfurt 1990 subsequently followed by many younger artists such as trumpeter Till Br√∂nner.Kunzler, Martin: Jazz-Lexikon. Rowohlt, Reinbek bei Hamburg 2002 Upon an invitation by Steve Smith and Tom Coster, members of platinum-selling groups Santana and Journey, de Winkel become successor to Mike Stern and Frank Gambale in their co-led jazz-fusion group Vital Information and proceeded to tour internationally with this group. He accepted a full scholarship from the Berklee College of Music in Boston and graduated summa cum laude. In the 1990s, he collaborated with an unusually broad spectrum of artists including Pat Metheny (DVD Secret Story Live), Al Foster, Larry Grenadier, Matthew Garrison, Ravi Coltrane, Joe Zawinul, Grandmaster Flash, and more recently Gwilym Simcock and Stuart Hamm. He can also be heard on all ten CDs of the German vanguard electronica-jazz fusion duo Tab Two and continues to tour and record with Hattler, the group of former Kraan head Hellmut Hattler. This group won the Echo Award, the German equivalent of the Grammy Award, for best jazz album in 2001. Since, he has been active in various projects in Europe, Africa and Asia as well as in non- profit organizations exploring sustainability and globalization issues in the context of the arts. Disenchanted with the common chord scale theory didactics, de Winkel has developed an alternative approach to teaching improvisation. Under the title Training Intuition this approach considers recent developments in learning psychology and in the neurosciences. De Winkel has conducted courses, master classes and clinics at various institutions, among them the Musikhochschule Hamburg and the Berufsfachschule f√ºr Musik in Krumbach/Schwaben. De Winkel is also active in the field of neurophilosophy. In 2005, Torsten de Winkel was one of the initiators and has since been the artistic director of the Bimbache openART Festival and Initiative in UNESCO world biosphere reserve El Hierro (Spain). This project, based on a global interdisciplinary network of artists and thinkers, is an ambitious and non- profit effort at creating a platform which seeks to bridge traditional divides, both on a musical and human level, in a globalized world.

The term was coined by Michael Field and John F. Kahles in 1964.. The surface integrity of a workpiece or item changes the material's properties. The consequences of changes to surface integrity are a mechanical engineering design problem, but the preservation of those properties are a manufacturing consideration. Surface integrity can have a great impact on a parts function; for example, Inconel 718 can have a fatigue limit as high as after a gentle grinding or as low as after electrical discharge machining (EDM).. Definition There are two aspects to surface integrity: topography characteristics and surface layer characteristics. The topography is made up of surface roughness, waviness, errors of form, and flaws. The surface layer characteristics that can change through processing are: plastic deformation, residual stresses, cracks, hardness, overaging, phase changes, recrystallization, intergranular attack, and hydrogen embrittlement. When a traditional manufacturing process is used, such as machining, the surface layer sustains local plastic deformation.. The processes that affect surface integrity can be conveniently broken up into three classes: traditional processes, non-traditional processes, and finishing treatments. Traditional processes are defined as processes where the tool contacts the workpiece surface; for example: grinding, turning, and machining. These processes will only damage the surface integrity if the improper parameters are used, such as dull tools, too high feed speeds, improper coolant or lubrication, or incorrect grinding wheel hardness. Nontraditional processes are defined as processes where the tool does not contact the workpiece; examples of this type of process include EDM, electrochemical machining, and chemical milling. These processes will produce different surface integrity depending on how the processes are controlled; for instance, they can leave a stress-free surface, a remelted surface, or excessive surface roughness. Finishing treatments are defined as processes that negate surface finishes imparted by traditional and non-traditional processes or improve the surface integrity. For example, compressive residual stress can be enhanced via peening or roller burnishing or the recast layer left by EDMing can be removed via chemical milling.. Finishing treatments can affect the workpiece surface in a wide variety of manners. Some clean and/or remove defects, such as scratches, pores, burrs, flash, or blemishes. Other processes improve or modify the surface appearance by improving smoothness, texture, or color. They can also improve corrosion resistance, wear resistance, and/or reduce friction. Coatings are another type of finishing treatment that may be used to plate an expensive or scarce material onto a less expensive base material. Variables Manufacturing processes have five main variables: the workpiece, the tool, the machine tool, the environment, and process variables. All of these variables can affect the surface integrity of the workpiece by producing: *High temperatures involved in various machining processes *Plastic deformation in the workpiece (residual stresses) *Surface geometry (roughness, cracks, distortion) *Chemical reactions, especially between the tool and the workpiece References Bibliography *.

Their area of control was possibly conterminous with the Diocese of Mayo recognised at the Synod of Kells in 1152. After the Norman take-over in 1235 they attempted with short periods of success to contest for the title of the rump-Kingdom of Connacht in the King's Cantreds with their cousins, the descendants of Cathal Crobhdearg Ua Conchobair. From the 1290s their main base of activity was in Breifne Rourke.

The club was founded in 1921 and has produced more Australian players than any other club in Australia. History Valley were the first club formed in Queensland in 1921 after an ad was placed in a local Brisbane newspaper seeking to people interested in playing hockey. Six people answered the ad and from that training began. They also approached the military one night at the Boundary Street Drill Hall when the N.C.O's were receiving instruction and a team was formed on the spot. A competition started when several other teams were formed. The members of the team were obsessed with hockey and trained 5 nights a week and all day Sunday sometimes. Club member, Col Cormie, was the founder of Junior and Schoolboy Hockey in Brisbane in 1928. Also in 1928, at the request of the Q.H.A, the top Valley team was split up to make the competition more even. It was reasoned that the fairest way that this could be done was to cut the team down the centre with the centre-forward going in the opposite side to the centre-half and tossing for the goal-keeper. Both teams were fielded in \\"A\\" Grade. From the Association's point of view the split did not have the desired effect, as the teams were Premiers and Runners-up in 1928-29 and 30, and were only beaten by each other, making a record of seven years unbeaten by any other club. At this time also the Club had created what was believed then to be a world's record for any field game - twelve successive \\"A\\" Grade Premierships. The Diehards have played in a fixture competition under the auspices of Brisbane Hockey Association Inc. since 1932. They have won twenty three premierships during their Seventy Five years in competition, making them the league's most successful club.

Forming on June 28 from a trough of low pressure, Amy gradually attained tropical storm status off the coast of North Carolina. A rapidly approaching trough caused Amy to turn sharply eastward before the storm took a general northeastward track. On July 2, the storm reached its peak intensity with winds of 70 mph (110 km/h) and a barometric pressure of 981 mbar (hPa; 28.97 inHg). During most of the storm's existence, Amy featured many subtropical characteristics but was not classified as such due to the proximity to land. By July 4, the system moved southeast of Newfoundland before becoming extratropical. The main effects from Amy were rough seas, reaching up to in height, that were felt from North Carolina to New Jersey, inflicting minor coastal flooding and beach erosion. On June 30, a schooner carrying four people capsized off the North Carolina coastline, resulting in the death of the father of the other three crew members. They remained at sea for roughly 15 days before being rescued by a Greek merchant ship. Meteorological history Tropical Storm Amy originated from a weak trough on June 24 accompanied by scattered showers and thunderstorms over Florida. The system tracked westward in response to an upper-tropospheric low over Georgia. By June 26, a surface circulation developed north of the Bahamas and satellite imagery showed a significant increase in convective activity and the National Hurricane Center (NHC) classified the system as a tropical depression early on June 27\\\\. On June 28, the system attained tropical storm-status while tracking north-northeast off the coast of North Carolina. By June 29, a trough, moving through the westerlies, rapidly approached the storm, causing the newly designated Amy to turn sharply toward the east. Strong wind shear disorganized the system slightly, leading to Amy featuring subtropical characteristics. By the evening, the strongest winds were not located around the center, but were instead situated between 60 and 90 mi (95 and 140 km) from the center. Convection became displaced from the center of circulation but the storm continued to intensify. Over the following several days, Amy tracked generally northeastward but underwent eastward jogs in response to rapidly moving troughs to the north. Amy neared hurricane intensity several times, beginning on June 30 as maximum winds increased to 70 mph (110 km/h); however, the storm was unable to acquire enough tropical features, and remained predominately subtropical. Gale-force winds at this time extended roughly 125 mi (210 km) out from the center to the north and east. Despite being subtropical at this point, the NHC decided against renaming it due to Amy's proximity to land.During 1975, subtropical cyclones were given names, like tropical cyclones, but from a separate list. On July 2, a barometric pressure of 981 mbar (hPa; 28.97 inHg) was recorded, the lowest in relation to Amy. The following day, another trough caused the storm to accelerate northeastward. On July 4, Amy passed roughly 170 mi (270 km) southeast of Cape Race, Newfoundland before becoming an extratropical cyclone. Preparations and impact Rainfall from Tropical Storm Amy Rough seas from the storm resulted in minor coastal flooding and beach erosion in North Carolina. Small craft advisories were issued along the Virginia and North Carolina coastlines as waves up to affected the region. Several beaches were closed due to the rough conditions. By July 2, the small craft advisories were discontinued as Amy tracked away from land. Tides up to in Virginia resulted in some beach erosion and coastal flooding due to the prolonged duration of the event. Although no warnings were issued, boaters in Newfoundland were advised to closely monitor the storm. In Hampton, Virginia, a funnel cloud spawned by a squall line associated with Amy formed just offshore. As a tropical depression, Amy produced scattered rainfall in Florida, peaking around near the Georgia border. Along the North Carolina coast, heavy rain fell as the center of Amy tracked nearby. Many coastal areas recorded more than with a peak amount of falling in Belhaven, North Carolina. Offshore, a schooner carrying four people capsized in rough seas roughly 250 mi (400 km) east of Cape Hatteras, North Carolina on June 30\\\\. The four crew were a father and his three kids. A diabetic, the 30-year-old father searched for his insulin pen in the capsized ship; however, for the fifteen days they were stranded, he was unable to find it. During the event, he slipped into a coma and later died on July 4, leaving his kids on the boat. On July 14, the three kids were rescued by the Ellinora, a Greek merchant ship.

The band is based at the East Claremont Street drill hall in Edinburgh and is administered by 52nd Lowland, 6th Battalion, The Royal Regiment of Scotland (6 SCOTS). The other two bands in the Regiment are the regular Regimental Band of the Royal Regiment of Scotland, which is based at Dreghorn Barracks in Edinburgh and is administered by the Corps of Army Music, and the other is the territorial Highland Band of the Royal Regiment of Scotland, which is based at Queen's Barracks in Perth and administered by 51st Highland, 7th Battalion, The Royal Regiment of Scotland (7 SCOTS). History The band was originally formed in 1958 for service with the Territorial 7th/9th (Highlanders) Battalion of The Royal Scots (The Royal Regiment), based at the East Claremont Street drill hall in Edinburgh, and they wore a Hunting Stewart kilt, the uniform of the old 'Dandy 9th' (Highlanders) Battalion of the Royal Scots who, as Highlanders living in Edinburgh, refused to wear the Royal Scots' Lowland tartan trews. In 1961, the 7th/9th (Highlanders) Battalion was amalgamated with the 8th (Peebleshire) Battalion of The Royal Scots to become the 8th/9th Battalion and when the Territorial Army was reorganised into the Territorial Army Volunteer Reserve (TAVR) in 1967, the 8th/9th Battalion Royal Scots became part of the Royal Scots and Cameronians Territorials. This unit was itself disbanded in 1969 and its soldiers were transferred to the 52nd Lowland Volunteers, which had also been raised in 1967. The band, supplemented by bandsmen from 278 Field Regiment Royal Artillery, was however put under the command of the City of Edinburgh University Officer Training Corps and then became known as The Royal Scots (Territorial) Band East Lowlands. The band eventually followed the other elements of the old Royal Scots and Cameronians Territorials, also coming under the command of the 52nd Lowland Volunteers in 1970, retaining its name as the Royal Scots Territorial Band. When the 1st and 2nd Battalions of the 52nd Lowland Volunteers were renamed as a result of the Front Line First reforms of the British Army in 1994, the band stayed with the redesignated 1st Battalion, which became The Lowland Volunteers in 1995 and subsequently the 52nd Lowland Regiment in 1999. As a result of the Strategic Defence Review of 1998, the band was renamed as The Band of 52nd Lowland Brigade on 1 July 1999 and although it was administered by the new 52nd Lowland Regiment, it had actually become a Brigade level asset. It did however retain the uniform and cap badge of the Royal Scots. After the formation of The Royal Regiment of Scotland on 28 March 2006, 52nd Lowland Regiment became the new Regiment's 6th Battalion and the band took the title The Lowland Band of The Royal Regiment of Scotland. Along with the Highland Band and six current Pipes and Drums in the new Regiment, the Lowland Band continues to wear its antecedent uniform, the No. 1 pattern ceremonial dress of the Royal Scots, but now with the cap badge of the Royal Regiment of Scotland on the Glengarry. The original regular Lowland Band of the Scottish Division was formed under the command of the Corps of Army Music in 1994, and consisted of the amalgamated regular regimental bands of the three Lowland Scottish infantry regiments at the time, the Royal Scots, the King's Own Scottish Borderers and the Royal Highland Fusiliers. The band was itself amalgamated with the Highland Band of the Scottish Division in 2006, forming the regular Regimental Band of the Royal Regiment of Scotland. Current activities The Lowland Band of the Royal Regiment of Scotland takes part in military and civilian events all over the UK and the world on behalf of 6 SCOTS and the Royal Regiment of Scotland, including the Battalion's annual Beating Retreat and Remembrance Day ceremonies in George Square, the Edinburgh Military Tattoo and the Opening of the Scottish Parliament.Scottish Parliament article on the Lowland Band The current Director of Music is Captain Phillip Wood, a former Bandmaster of the regular Band of the Royal Regiment of Scotland and Bandmaster of the Light Cavalry Band.

Family  Fteris had four siblings. Yiannis (nicknamed Yianko) remained in Mani. Vasilis fought in the Macedonian Struggle as a guerrilla captain and was killed in battle. Potis, like his brother George, was trained as a lawyer, wrote for many newspapers, and became the editor of one. He later became secretary to Eleftherios Venizelos and was elected a member of the Hellenic Parliament for Athens. In 1963, he became Minister to the Prime Minister's Office. They also had a sister named Olga, married with John Harames from Kremasti Lakonias. In 1931, George Fteris married Rhea Vrachinou, and on 13 July 1934, she gave birth to their only daughter Elyana. Image:Tsimbidaros family.jpg|George Fteris (sitting) with his wife Rhea (left) and daughter Elyana Image:Elyana Damianos next to her father's bust.jpg|Fteris' daughter Elyana next to her father's bust Journalist For much of his life, Fteris served as a foreign correspondent. Initially stationed in Rome, and later in France, he traveled Europe meeting famous people such as Italian dictator Benito Mussolini, whom Fteris interviewed many times. During his travels, he made many friends such as writer Nikos Kazantzakis, sculptor Michael Tombros, politician Eleftherios Venizelos, actress Ellie Lambeti, and even Pablo Picasso. Upon his return to Greece, he became the editor for The Athenian News as well as a journalist for The Vimahttp://wiki.phantis.com/index.php/To_Vima newspaper. Every Sunday, he would write their main article. Translator In 1930, Fteris received a French Academy Award for his translation of Les Miserables from French into Greek. In 1966, he was awarded the Gold Medal of Journalism by King Constantine II. He was honored many other times by the Greek government for his work in literature and journalism. Author Fteris wrote various books and articles. His daughter Elyana Damianos said, \\"‚Ä¶his books were deep and difficult to understand because he wanted to make better people. The books used plain language, but had deep meanings. He didn't want people reading garbage, but to search, to better one's self, ask questions, and also make people smarter. Basically, to make a man think.\\"Damianos, John, Personal Interview with Elyana Damianos, conducted 2008-05-02 Horiata Bust of Fteris. One of Fteris' greatest and most memorable accomplishments is a song called \\"Horiata\\" (Œó ŒßœâœÅŒπŒ¨œÑŒ± ‚Äì \\"Village Woman\\"). In the winter of 1941‚Äì42, the first bitter winter of the German Occupation, he wrote an allegorical song and gave it to Sophia Vembo, most popular songstress of the time and also family friend. She sang it in theaters all over Greece, each time wearing a dress with the national Greek colors on it. Even today, it is broadcast on national Greek radio stations. Commenting on the song over 35 years later one writer said, \\"It is a voice of hope and continuation. It resonated greatly in the hearts of the then enslaved people.\\" In the song, Greece is represented as a village woman, and its youth as a budding tree. During the time period, all patriotic songs were forbidden by the Nazis. Fteris knew this, and he wrote every verse of the song allegorically. His daughter said, \\"Each time it was sung, it electrified the audience. They heard the song and understood, so it gave them hope, and lifted them up emotionally. It scared the enemy, and it was like a threat.\\" Many people loved Fteris' song, and its message spread throughout Greece. Theaters would continually play it. But soon after, the Nazis seized control. The song was prohibited, and theaters were closed. A penalty was set for singing the song, and Nazis even came to Fteris' home threatening him with arrest. Vembo continued to perform \\"Horiata\\" in her concerts in the Middle East and continued to inspire the Greek resistance movement. Even though the song had been stifled in Greece, the damage had been done. The once tired and hopeless Greeks fought on throughout World War II as the song says, \\"with new branches and limbs.\\" Fteris died on his birthday in 1967 of liver cancer. Today his body lies in his homeland, Mani. On the road connecting the towns of Areopoli and Gytheio, a monument has been dedicated to him on the summit of a hill overlooking his favorite land. Though he left the limitations of village life behind as a teenager, he always kept Mani in his heart. He once wrote, On his monument is a bust of his head sculpted by his friend Michael Tombros. On his shoulder, a woman representing Mani is weeping, mourning his death. His daughter Elyana said, \\"My father never wanted a monument because he was a very humble person, and he never believed in monuments; my mother insisted that he deserved one though.\\"  Quote  > \\"When I die and you are asked who I was, what I believed, whence I was > inspired to write what I did ‚Äì answer them that I was nothing more than a > simple person who believed deeply in love, in goodness, and in humanity.

Location of Cinema It is part of a building called Palazzo Peretti, now Palazzo Fiano, constructed by Pope Eugene IV between 1431 and 1447, located on a zig-zag bend on via in Lucina at its junction with via del Giardino Theodoli. It backs onto the church of San Lorenzo in Lucina and only a two hundred yards from Palazzo Montecitorio the Italian Parliament Building and from via del Corso, the main thoughrofare through historic Rome. Operation as a theatre The first theatrical use of this space was as a ballet and marionette theatre called ‚ÄúTeatro Fiano‚Äù. In the nineteenth century the theatre was named Teatro Olimpia. In April 1898, Teatro Olimpia was listed as showing 'Reale Cinematografo Lumiere'. Current Cinematic Operation Nuovo Olimpia was refurbished in 1996/1997 by the architects Enrico Mastrangeli and Pierluigi Celata as an original language art-house cinema, and is operated by the Circuito Cinema, part of the Europa Cinemas Group. The cinema has two screens with 275 and 90 seats respectively. The cinema, re-opened in 1997 with Tom Cruise in \\"Eyes Wide Shut\\" and Wim Wender's \\"Buena Vista Social Club\\" First pieces of the Ara Pacis discovered The first pieces of the Ara Pacis were recovered in the 16th century, and various friezes were incorporated in renaissance structures such as Villa Medici on the Pincian Hill. In 1566, the Tuscan Cardinal Giovanni Ricci di Montepulciano, also the superintendent of water acquired nine large blocks of curved marble from the altar and incorporated them into the walls of Villa Medici. Nineteenth Century After this finds, we hear nothing more about the altar until 1859, when the Peretti Palace, which had by now become the property of the Duke of Fiano, needed structural work, during which the base of the altar was seen, and numerous other sculpted fragments, not all of which were extracted \\"due to the narrowness of the site and fear of endangering the walls of the palace\\". Numerous fragments of the spiralled frieze were recovered on this occasion. Twentieth century The Altar was finally recognised for what it was by Friedrich von Duhn and in 1903 a request was sent to the Ministry of Public Education to continue the excavations. Their success was made possible by the generosity of Edoardo Almagi√†, who, as well as giving his permission for the exploration, donated in advance whatever should be discovered underneath the palace and made an ongoing financial contribution to the expenses of the excavation. Ambitious Recovery Project In July 1903, after the work had been started, it quickly became obvious that the conditions were extremely difficult and that the stability of Teatro Olimpia might well be compromised. When about half the monument had been examined and 53 fragments recovered, the excavation was called to a halt. In February 1937, the Italian Cabinet decreed that, as it was the two thousandth anniversary of the birth of Augustus, the excavations should recommence, using the most advanced technology. Seventy cubic metres of ground under Cinema Nuovo Olimpia were frozen, whilst the altar was extracted. The huge granite plinth of the Ara Pacis still lies under the Cinema Nuovo Olimpia today as engineers were never able to extract it.

The visit followed the group's denunciation of drugs in favour of TM and received widespread media attention. The band's interest in the Maharishi's teachings was led by George Harrison's commitment,; ; . and it changed Western attitudes about Indian spirituality and encouraged the study of Transcendental Meditation. The visit was also the most productive period for the Beatles' songwriting. The Beatles had intended to join the Maharishi in India soon after attending his seminar in Bangor, Wales in late August 1967. Their attendance at the seminar was cut short by the death of their manager Brian Epstein, after which they committed to making the television film Magical Mystery Tour. Harrison and John Lennon were convinced of the merits of TM and became spokesmen for the Maharishi's Spiritual Regeneration Movement, as he gained international prominence as the guru to the Beatles. The band members arrived in India in mid-February 1968, along with their wives, girlfriends, assistants, and numerous reporters. They joined a group of 60 training to be TM teachers; among the other celebrity meditators were musicians Donovan, Mike Love and Paul Horn, and actress Mia Farrow. While there, Lennon, Paul McCartney and Harrison wrote many songs, and Ringo Starr finished writing his first. Eighteen were recorded for The Beatles (\\"the White Album\\"), two others appeared on the Abbey Road album, and others were used for various solo projects. The retreat and the discipline required for meditation were met with varying degrees of commitment from the individual Beatles. Starr left on 1 March, after ten days; McCartney left later in March to attend to business concerns. Harrison and Lennon departed abruptly on 12 April following rumours of the Maharishi's inappropriate behaviour towards Farrow and another of his female students. The divisive influence of the Beatles' Greek friend Alexis Mardas, financial disagreements, and suspicions that their teacher was taking advantage of the band's fame have also been cited by biographers and witnesses. The Beatles' denunciation of the Maharishi was detrimental to his reputation in the West, while their return from Rishikesh exposed differences that anticipated the group's break-up in 1970. Harrison later apologised for the way that he and Lennon treated the Maharishi; like many of other students at the ashram, he said that allegations concerning the Maharishi's inappropriate behaviour were untrue. Harrison gave a benefit concert in 1992 for the Maharishi-associated Natural Law Party. In 2009, McCartney and Starr performed at a benefit concert for the David Lynch Foundation, which raises funds for teaching TM to at-risk students. As a result of continued interest in the Beatles' 1968 retreat, the abandoned ashram was opened to the public in 2015 and has since been renamed Beatles Ashram. Background The Beatles in a sequence from Magical Mystery Tour The Beatles attended Maharishi Mahesh Yogi's Transcendental Meditation (TM) seminar in Bangor in Wales, but their stay was cut short on 27 August 1967 after they learned that their manager, Brian Epstein, had been found dead in his London home. Eager to explore meditation further, the Beatles made plans to travel to the Maharishi's training centre in Rishikesh, India, in late October. At Paul McCartney's urging, they postponed the trip until the new year to work on their Magical Mystery Tour film project, since he was concerned that, with the loss of Epstein, the band should first focus on their career. George Harrison and John Lennon, the two most committed to the Maharishi's teachings, appeared twice on David Frost's television program in autumn 1967 to espouse the benefits of TM. Now publicised as \\"the Beatles' Guru\\", the Maharishi went on his eighth world tour, giving lectures in Britain, Scandinavia, West Germany, Italy, Canada and California. Harrison introduced Dennis Wilson of the Beach Boys to the Maharishi when he and Lennon joined their teacher at a UNICEF benefit in Paris in December. Wilson's bandmate Mike Love described the private lecture the Maharishi gave beforehand as \\"awe-inspiring\\" and \\"the most profound experience I'd ever felt\\". Having long shared Harrison's interest in meditation and Indian religious texts, Scottish singer Donovan also recognised the Maharishi as the \\"guide\\" they had been searching for. The Maharishi received considerable media coverage in the West, particularly the United States, where Life magazine devoted a cover article to the TM phenomenon and declared 1968 the \\"Year of the Guru\\". The mainstream press remained largely suspicious of the Maharishi's motives, however; the British satirical magazine Private Eye nicknamed him \\"Veririchi Lotsamoney Yogi Bear\\". Lennon defended the Maharishi's requirement that his students donate a week's wages to his organisation, the Spiritual Regeneration Movement, saying that it was \\"the fairest thing I've heard of\\". Lennon added: \\"So what if he's commercial? We're the most commercial group in the world!\\" The Beatles were nevertheless concerned that the Maharishi appeared to be using their name for self-promotion. According to Peter Brown, who temporarily assumed Epstein's role following his death, the Maharishi was negotiating with ABC in the US to make a television special featuring the band. In an effort to stop him, Brown twice visited the Maharishi in Malm√∂, Sweden ‚Äì on the second occasion with Harrison and McCartney ‚Äì only for him to \\"giggle\\" in response. In Brown's description, Harrison defended their teacher, saying: \\"He's not a modern man. He just doesn't understand these things.\\" Harrison flew to Bombay in January 1968 to work on the Wonderwall Music soundtrack, expecting the rest of the group to follow shortly. When they were delayed he flew back to London. The group spent a week in the studio, recording songs for a single that would be released while they were away on their spiritual retreat. The B-side, Harrison's \\"The Inner Light\\", was mostly recorded in Bombay and featured Indian instrumentation and lyrics espousing meditation as a means to genuine understanding of the world. Although it remained unreleased until late 1969, Lennon's \\"Across the Universe\\" contained the refrain \\"Jai Guru Deva\\", a standard greeting in the Spiritual Regeneration Movement. Aside from the celebrity musicians who now endorsed TM, the Maharishi had gained the support of American film star Mia Farrow while in New York City. In late January, amid the publicity surrounding her separation from her husband, Frank Sinatra, Farrow accompanied the Maharishi to India in advance of the Beatles' departure from London. Arrivals The Beatles and their entourage travelled to Rishikesh in two groups. Lennon and his wife Cynthia, Harrison and his wife Pattie Boyd, and the latter's sister Jenny arrived in Delhi on 15 February. They were met by Mal Evans, their longtime assistant and former road manager, who had arranged the , six-hour taxi drive to Rishikesh. Once there, the party walked across the Lakshman Jhula footbridge, over the River Ganges, and up the hill to the Maharishi's ashram. McCartney and his girlfriend Jane Asher and Ringo Starr and his wife Maureen landed in Delhi on 19 February. Since the press were expecting McCartney and Starr's party after the first group's arrival, they were subjected to constant attention. As soon as Starr arrived, he asked Evans to take him to a doctor because of a reaction to an inoculation. As a result, Starr, McCartney and their partners stayed overnight in Delhi and travelled to Rishikesh with Evans early on 20 February. The Lakshman Jhula suspension bridge over the River Ganges The Beatles arrived at the ashram three weeks into the course, which was due to end on 25 April. They were followed by a retinue of reporters and photographers, who were mostly kept out of the fenced and gated compound. Evans and Beatles aide Neil Aspinall were there for much of the time. Alexis \\"Magic Alex\\" Mardas, the Greek electronics engineer who had been among the first to recommend the Maharishi to the band in 1967, arrived four weeks later. Denis O'Dell, the head of the Beatles' company Apple Films, also joined them for a brief time. In his memoir The Love You Make, Brown says that he only learned of the Beatles' intention to leave for India that same month, even though he and the band were committed to launching their multimedia company Apple Corps. He adds: \\"The mastery of Transcendental Meditation, they hoped, would give them the wisdom to run Apple.\\" Also there were Donovan, songwriter and sculptor Gyp \\"Gypsy Dave\\" Mills, Mike Love, jazz flautist Paul Horn, actors Tom Simcox and Jerry Stovin, and dozens of others, all Europeans or Americans. Farrow was joined by her sister, Prudence, and their brother John. American socialite Nancy Cooke de Herrera was also present, in her role as the Maharishi's publicist and confidant. A lifelong devotee to TM and subsequently an instructor to many celebrities,Associated Press (4 March 2013). \\"Meditation teacher Nancy Cooke de Herrera dies\\". Newsday. Retrieved 14 January 2018. Cooke de Herrara later wrote that the Maharishi gave \\"special attention\\" to the celebrity meditators, which she feared would feed their egos and be detrimental to the experience. Although members of the press were barred from the ashram, journalist Lewis Lapham was granted access to write a feature article on the retreat for The Saturday Evening Post. Paul Saltzman, a young Canadian filmmaker travelling in India, camped outside the compound until he was invited in and welcomed into the Beatles' circle.Thrope, Vanessa (21 January 2018). \\"Revealed: Lucky break that led lovelorn traveller to a fling in India with the Beatles\\".

Facility View of Rishikesh from beach Located in the \\"Valley of the Saints\\" in the foothills of the Himalayas, Rishikesh is a place of religious significance, known as the \\"yoga capital of the world\\". The Maharishi's International Academy of Meditation, also called the Chaurasi Kutia ashram, was a compound surrounded by jungle set across the Ganges from the town, above the river. The facility was designed to suit Western habits; Starr later compared the ashram to \\"a kind of spiritual Butlins\\" (a low-cost British holiday camp). The Beatles' bungalows were equipped with electric heaters, running water, toilets, and English-style furniture. According to Cooke de Herrera, the Maharishi obtained many \\"special items\\" from a nearby village so that the Beatles' rooms would have mirrors, wall-to-wall carpeting, wall coverings, foam mattresses and bedspreads. She wrote that, compared to the other students' bungalows, the Beatles' cottages \\"looked like a palace\\". In Cynthia Lennon's description, her and her husband's bedroom contained a four-poster bed, a dressing table, two chairs and an electric heater. Meditation domes at the International Academy of Meditation (pictured in 2006, long after the ashram's closure) Evans recalled there were around 40 staff, including cooks, cleaners, a joiner, and a full printing department. One of the Maharishi's aides, Ravindra Damodara, who later became a swami himself, kept a diary of this period at the ashram. For the Beatles' stay, according to Damodara, four small stone-covered buildings had been constructed along the path from the main centre down to the ashram gates. These dome-shaped rooms included a raised platform, accessed by ladder, on which each Beatle could engage in advanced meditation. The Maharishi's accommodation was a long, modern-style bungalow located away from the other buildings. The ashram was surrounded by barbed wire and the gates were kept locked and guarded. Although the Maharishi kept the media away from his famous students, he gave interviews to the press. To the Beatles' gratitude, he asked the reporters to come back after the band had had \\"a little time with the course\\". Throughout the Beatles' time at the ashram, these reporters filed stories about the retreat. While the music journalists among them demonstrated a tolerant approach, those representing the mainstream press often ridiculed the idea of the retreat and meditation. The press found McCartney the most willing to engage; according to author Howard Sounes, he was \\"the newspaperman's pet, the sensible Beatle\\" who gave them quotes and posed for photos on Lakshman Jhula bridge. Experience The Maharishi had arranged a simple lifestyle for his guests. The days were devoted to meditating and attending his lectures, which he gave from a flower-bedecked platform in an auditorium. He also gave private lessons to the individual Beatles, ostensibly due to their late arrival. The tranquil environment and protection from the media throng helped the band relax. Harrison told Saltzman, regarding the Beatles' motivation for embracing TM: \\"We have all the money you could ever dream of. We have all the fame you could ever wish for. But, it isn't love. It isn't health. It isn't peace inside, is it?\\" In Saltzman's description, Harrison had a genuine dedication to meditation whereas Lennon's approach was \\"more adolescent ‚Ä¶ He was looking for 'The Answer'. Well, there isn't The Answer.\\" According to Donovan, at the Beatles' first meeting with the Maharishi after arriving, an awkward silence filled the room until Lennon walked to the Maharishi and patted him on the head, saying, \\"There's a good little guru.\\" Everyone erupted with laughter. Harrison's nickname for their teacher was \\"the Big M\\". Maharishi Mahesh Yogi, pictured in Amsterdam in September 1967 In the Maharishi's teaching, there were seven levels of consciousness, and the course would provide students with experience in the fourth: \\"pure\\" or transcendental consciousness. While Transcendental Meditation had earned the sobriquet \\"the McDonald's of meditation\\" for its quick and simple application, and the Maharishi espoused its scientific basis over religious dogma, strong Vedic and Hindu-aligned aspects remained. His lectures included stories and parables, and comparisons between TM and Western practices, particularly Christianity. He advocated meditation before prayer, and said that Christianity's upholding of Jesus Christ's earthbound suffering as a divine attribute was a \\"humiliating teaching\\" and a distraction from self- and God-realisation. The Maharishi soon cancelled the formal lectures and told students to meditate for as long as possible. One student meditated for 42 straight hours, and Boyd said she once meditated for seven hours. Jenny Boyd also meditated for long periods, but suffered from dysentery (misdiagnosed as tonsilitis); she said Lennon also felt unwell, suffering from jet lag and insomnia. The lengthy meditation left many students moody and oversensitive. Several people on the course and the Maharishi were particularly concerned about Prudence Farrow's unwillingness to stop meditating. All the students wore native dress and the ashram had a tailor on the premises to make clothes for them. The women in the Beatles party shopped in local towns and bought saris for themselves and material to be made into shirts and jackets for the men. These towns included Dehradun and Mussoorie, where markets were held by Tibetans driven out of their homeland by Chinese encroachment into Tibet. The Beatles' adoption of traditional Indian clothing affected Western fashion when they wore them after going home. Much of the proceedings at the ashram was filmed by various students on a 16mm handheld camera. Segments of this footage appear in the 1995 television documentary The Beatles Anthology. Vegetarian meals were eaten in a communal dining area, where food was vulnerable to aggressive monkeys (Hanuman langurs) and crows. Lennon described the food as \\"lousy\\", while Pattie Boyd said it was \\"delicious\\". Menu items included chickpeas mixed with cumin seeds, whole wheat dough baked over a fire, spiced eggplant, potatoes that had been picked locally, and, for breakfast, cornflakes, toast and coffee. Evans stockpiled eggs for Starr, who had problems with the diet because of his past illnesses. Starr recalled: \\"The food was impossible for me because I'm allergic to so many different things. I took two suitcases with me, one of clothes and one full of Heinz beans.\\" After dinner, the musicians gathered on the roof of Harrison's bungalow to talk and listen to the Ganges river. Sometimes they listened to records and played guitar or sitar. Lapham recalled a conversation one evening between members of the Beatles and other students when Lennon described the band's records as \\"diaries of its developing consciousness\\" and said that this progression was also reflected in the photos and artwork used on their albums. Although the weather was cool in February, it grew hot over the ensuing weeks. By mid April, the Maharishi was planning to move the whole retreat to Kashmir, at a higher and cooler altitude. The Beatles' approach to meditation was marked by a friendly competitiveness among the band members. Lennon was complimentary about Harrison's progress, saying: \\"The way George is going, he'll be flying a magic carpet by the time he's forty.\\" Boyd recalls that she and Harrison each achieved an \\"out-of-body experience\\" through meditation but that, because their individual practice disturbed the other, they decided to move into separate rooms. While Lennon was \\"evangelical in his enthusiasm for the Maharishi\\", according to his wife Cynthia, she was \\"a little more sceptical\\". Cynthia later wrote that she \\"loved being in India\\" and had hoped she and Lennon would \\"rediscover our lost closeness\\"; to her disappointment, however, Lennon became \\"increasingly cold and aloof\\". After two weeks Lennon asked to sleep in a separate room, saying he could only meditate alone. He walked to the local post office every morning to check for Ono's almost daily telegrams. One read: \\"Look up at the sky and when you see a cloud think of me\\". Songwriting Donovan taught the Beatles a guitar finger-picking technique that they later incorporated in some of the songs on their 1968 double album commonly known as \\"the White Album\\". Saltzman recalls that the Beatles were \\"very close and tight\\" during his time at the ashram. According to Damodara, however, at times McCartney \\"talk[ed] mean with George\\" and appeared to want to be the Beatles' \\"boss\\". Donovan taught Lennon a guitar finger-picking technique that McCartney partly mastered also. The technique was subsequently implemented by Lennon on the Beatles songs \\"Julia\\" and \\"Dear Prudence\\". The latter was composed by Lennon to lure Prudence Farrow out of her intense meditation. Lennon later said: \\"She'd been locked in for three weeks and was trying to reach God quicker than anyone else.\\" The stay at the ashram turned out to be the group's most productive period for songwriting. According to Lennon, he wrote some of the \\"most miserable\\" and some of his \\"best\\" songs while he was in Rishikesh. Starr completed his first solo composition, \\"Don't Pass Me By\\", which he had begun writing in 1963. In his 2005 autobiography, Donovan recalls that while the other three Beatles played acoustic guitars, Starr sometimes played a set of tabla hand drums, which Harrison had bought for him in Delhi. The retreat was also a productive one for Donovan as a songwriter. He recalls having \\"many a great little jam\\" with McCartney and says that, with Harrison demonstrating on sitar the knowledge he had gained through his teacher, Ravi Shankar, he and Harrison were \\"soon chording a new song or two\\", including the Indian-styled \\"Hurdy Gurdy Man\\". Plans were discussed for a possible concert in Delhi to feature the Beatles, the Beach Boys, Donovan, and Paul Horn. While he also wrote several new songs in Rishikesh, Harrison complained that more time should be spent on meditating. When McCartney discussed his vision for an album containing the songs they had amassed so far, Harrison replied: \\"We're not fucking here to do the next album. We're here to meditate!\\" In Donovan's recollection, when not meditating, McCartney was rarely without his guitar and kept the Beatles party \\"entertained\\" with parody songs such as \\"Rocky Raccoon\\" and \\"Back in the U.S.S.R.\\", but he was not \\"totally convinced\\" about TM. Many of the Beatles' new songs were inspired by nature and reflected the simplicity of their surroundings. In this way, they contrasted markedly with the band's psychedelic work over the previous year, although few of them were overtly reflective of the TM experience. An exception was \\"Sour Milk Sea\\", in which Harrison exhorts listeners to embrace meditation and \\"illumination\\", while Lennon's \\"Child of Nature\\" and McCartney's \\"Mother Nature's Son\\" were both inspired by one of the Maharishi's lectures.

Seated in front of the Maharishi are (front row, from left to right): Ringo Starr, Maureen Starkey, Jane Asher, Paul McCartney, George Harrison, Pattie Boyd, Cynthia Lennon, John Lennon. In late February, the Maharishi arranged for a group photo of all the students. In Lapham's description, the Maharishi began preparing for the shot early one morning and approached the task as if \\"the director on a movie set\\". Instructing his assistants, he oversaw the assembly of a platform of risers, the precise placement of flowers and potted plants in front of the raised stage, and the seating allocation for each of the students from his hand-drawn diagram. The students were then called down to take their allocated seat. Surrounding the Maharishi, each member was dressed in traditional Indian attire and adorned with a marigold garland of orange. Lapham commented that the Maharishi had the Beatles positioned \\"in the center of the set\\", surrounding him, with the other students \\"arranged according to the degrees of their celebrity\\". The Maharishi had a large picture of Brahmananda Saraswati ‚Äì the guru evoked by Lennon in \\"Across the Universe\\" ‚Äì placed behind him. The Maharishi encouraged his students to present their best \\"cosmic smiles\\" to the camera. The photo took half an hour to complete while the participants sat facing the bright morning sun. In 2009, The Hindu described the result as \\"one of the most iconic photographs in the history of rock 'n' roll\\". For the Beatles' public image, their attire contrasted with the modern, psychedelic clothing they had worn on arrival from London. The photo and others from the shoot were used in Lapham's cover article for The Saturday Evening Post, a magazine that, although in decline by 1968, was influential among America's suburban middle class. Saltzman was one of the photographers at the session. His shots from this time were compiled in his book The Beatles in Rishikesh, published in 2000.Telegraph (India) staff (27 March 2005). \\"Long and Winding Road to Rishikesh\\". The Telegraph (India). Archived from the original on 11 September 2011. Retrieved 18 January 2018. Birthday celebrations and river excursions On 25 February, the Maharishi held a party to celebrate Harrison's 25th birthday. The event included communal chanting, a sitar performance by Harrison, and a firework display. The Maharishi gave Harrison an upside-down plastic globe of the world and said: \\"George, the globe I am giving you symbolizes the world today. I hope you will help us all in the task of putting it right.\\" Harrison turned the globe over and said \\"I've done it!\\", and the other students applauded. For Love's birthday, on 15 March, members of the Beatles and Donovan performed \\"Spiritual Regeneration/Happy Birthday Mike Love\\", a song based on the Beach Boys' \\"Fun, Fun, Fun\\". Lennon presented Love with a round handmade card containing a self-portrait of him naked, and Harrison gave him a painting of Guru Dev. A dual celebration was held on 17 March for the birthdays of Boyd and Horn. On 8 April, the Maharishi gave an Indian prince's outfit to the Lennons for their son in England on his birthday. An aviation company owner and patron of the Maharishi's, Kershi Cambata (K.S. Khambatta), flew two helicopters to Rishikesh to take the Maharishi and his guests for rides. Lapham wrote that Cooke de Herrera, a friend of Cambata, had arranged this event to provide what she called a \\"visitation of modernity\\". McCartney recalled that he asked Lennon why he was so eager to be the one to go with the Maharishi on his helicopter ride, and that Lennon replied: \\"I thought he might slip me the Answer.\\" In early March, an Italian newsreel company filmed the Maharishi and many students, including the Beatles and other musicians, going down to the river while the musicians sang standards such as \\"When the Saints Go Marching In\\" and \\"You Are My Sunshine\\". One evening when the moon was full, the Maharishi arranged for everyone to cruise on the Ganges in two barges. The trip started with the chanting of Vedas by two pandits, but soon the musicians brought out their instruments. The Beatles sang Donovan's songs, while Love and Donovan sang Beatles songs, and Horn played flute. Early departures McCartney and Starr told Lapham that they had each experienced the benefits of meditation but the band's trip to India was more out of support for \\"George's thing\\". Starr's wife had a strong aversion to insects; McCartney recalled that Maureen was once \\"trapped in her room because there was a fly over the door\\". Spiders, mosquitoes and flies were present at the ashram, and when Starr complained to the Maharishi he was told: \\"For people travelling in the realm of pure consciousness, flies no longer matter very much.\\" Starr said in reply, \\"Yes, but that doesn't zap the flies, does it\\"? Starr disliked the food, and he and Maureen missed their children. The couple left India on 1 March, and on their return to the UK, Starr was keen to avoid the impression that he was no longer interested in TM. He told reporters: \\"The Academy is a great place and I enjoyed it a lot. I still meditate every day for half an hour in the morning and half an hour every evening and I think I'm a better person for it ‚Ä¶ If everyone in the world started meditating, the world would be a much happier place.\\" McCartney and Asher departed in mid to late March. According to Cooke de Herrera's account, McCartney had arranged to get back to London to supervise Apple Corps, and Asher had a theatrical commitment; as he left he told Cooke de Herrera, \\"I'm a new man.\\" According to what he told Lapham, however, McCartney was uncomfortable with the Maharishi's flattery, particularly his calling the Beatles \\"the blessed leaders of the world's youth\\", and he found himself lost in the Maharishi's more elaborate discussions. Damodara wrote that Asher had no interest in meditation, a view echoed by Saltzman, who said that she was eager to visit the Taj Mahal with McCartney. McCartney later said that his intention had always been to stay for only a month, and that he knew he risked accusations from his bandmates that he was not sincere about meditation. Mia Farrow departed to begin work on a new film in London, where she arrived on 8 March. Described by author Jonathan Gould as \\"restless\\", she had left the ashram before to visit Goa, and then returned. In her 1997 autobiography, Farrow recalls that she felt overwhelmed by the Maharishi's attention to her, which included private sessions, gifts of mangoes, and a birthday party where he gave her a paper crown. Love left the retreat on 15 March, having stayed just over two weeks, due to his tour commitments with the Beach Boys, but would complete his TM instructor course in 1972. Donovan departed because he recognised he had a \\"mission\\" in music and sought to convey the Maharishi's teachings in that way. Tensions Business arrangements and Mardas' arrival According to Gould, Lennon and Harrison viewed their bandmates' departures as an example of McCartney and Starr \\"once again balking on the path to higher consciousness\\", just as the pair, particularly McCartney, had earlier held out before joining them in their LSD experimentation. While Harrison and Lennon remained steadfast in their devotion to meditation, some members of the Beatles' circle continued to be distrustful of the Maharishi's hold on them. Aspinall was surprised when he realised that the Maharishi was a sophisticated negotiator, knowing more than the average person about financial percentages. According to Saltzman, Evans told him that the Maharishi wanted the band to deposit up to 25 per cent of their next album's profits into his Swiss bank account as a tithe, to which Lennon replied, \\"Over my dead body.\\" In Brown's account, Lennon was not opposed to paying the tithe until Alex Mardas, the Maharishi's \\"most powerful critic\\", intervened. Mardas arrived after McCartney had left. He pointed to the luxury of the facility and the business acumen of the Maharishi and asked Lennon why the Maharishi always had an accountant by his side. Mardas also derided the characters of the non-celebrity meditators and was highly critical of the way the Beatles had been assembled for the \\"class photo\\" and the promotion of the Maharishi's movement. In an attempt to silence his criticism, according to Mardas, the Maharishi offered him money to build a high-powered radio station. Lennon later told his wife that he felt that the Maharishi had, in her words, \\"too much interest in public recognition, celebrities and money\\" for a spiritual man. Cynthia Lennon, Cooke de Herrera, and author and Beatles associate Barry Miles have blamed Mardas for turning Lennon against the Maharishi. Miles writes that Mardas feared for his status as Lennon's personal guru, and set about sabotaging the relationship between the Beatles and the Maharishi. In a statement published in The New York Times in 2010, Mardas denied that this was the case. Competing documentary film proposals Before leaving London in February, the Beatles had considered making a documentary film about the Maharishi through Apple Films. The idea gained traction once they got to the ashram, which led to their summoning Denis O'Dell to Rishikesh. Together with Aspinall, he flew to India intent on dissuading the Beatles from making the film. According to Cooke de Herrera, the Maharishi gave the Beatles and Apple the rights for a film about him, his movement and his teacher, Guru Dev. Joe Massot, who had directed Wonderwall, said that Harrison phoned him from India inviting him to participate in the project. However, Charles Lutes, the head of the Spiritual Regeneration Movement in the US, had already arranged with the Maharishi to produce a similar documentary, with Horn. In early April, Lutes arrived at the ashram to ensure that his venture was not jeopardised by the Beatles' interest. He signed a contract with Four Star Films and John Farrow was scheduled to direct the film. Horn expected that Donovan, the Beatles, the Beach Boys and Mia Farrow would appear in it. According to Mike Dolan, another of the TM students, when a film crew from Lutes' company Bliss Productions arrived later in April, Lennon and Harrison \\"were more than a little pissed\\" and made a point of staying out of sight. Horn said that the arrival of the film crew was the catalyst for the discontent that resulted in the last two Beatles' premature departure from Rishikesh. In Massot's recollection, the crew was led by producer Gene Corman, who subsequently pleaded with Massot to use his influence with Harrison and Lennon to ensure the Beatles' participation. Cooke de Herrera also felt that the Four Star deal and the presence of the film crew was the reason for the sudden departure. Allegations of sexual impropriety Mia Farrow, pictured in 1964 Before leaving the ashram, Mia Farrow told some of the other students that the Maharishi had made a pass at her. In her 1993 autobiography, Cooke de Herrera says that Farrow confided to her, before the arrival of the Beatles, that the Maharishi had made a pass during a private puja ceremony by stroking her hair. Cooke de Herrera says she told Farrow that she had misinterpreted the Maharishi's actions. Farrow's 1997 memoirs are ambiguous, describing an encounter in his private meditation \\"cave\\" when the Maharishi tried to put his arms around her. She also says that her sister Prudence assured her that it was \\"an honour\\" and \\"a tradition\\" for a \\"holy man\\" to touch someone after meditation. In Pattie Boyd's account, it was the allegations of the Maharishi's sexual impropriety that caused life at the retreat to go \\"horribly wrong\\". Through Mardas' insistence, Lennon became convinced that the Maharishi, who said he was celibate, had had a sexual encounter with one of the young female students. As reported by Brown, the woman was a \\"pretty blond nurse from California\\" who, Mardas said, had engaged in a sexual relationship with the Maharishi. Dolan recalls that she was in fact a \\"feisty\\" schoolteacher from New York, named Rosalyn Bonas (or \\"RB\\"), who was having an affair with Mardas. She had become disillusioned at the extent to which Hindu tradition and the Vedas were part of the course, and was prevented from leaving early for the US due to the conditions of her airline ticket. Jenny Boyd wrote that she had seen Mardas and the woman deep in conversation, \\"obviously cooking something up\\". On the Beatles' final night at the ashram, Mardas arranged to entrap the Maharishi by spying on him and the woman when they were alone together. Mardas then reported to the others that he saw the two of them in a compromising position. Many of the people at the ashram ‚Äì including Harrison, Horn, Cooke de Herrera, Dolan, Cynthia Lennon and Jenny Boyd ‚Äì did not believe that the Maharishi had made a pass at any woman. According to Cynthia, however, Mardas' allegations \\"gathered momentum ... without a single shred of evidence or justification\\". In her autobiography, Pattie Boyd also expresses doubt regarding the truth behind Mardas' claims, but in this atmosphere of suspicion, she had a \\"horrid dream about Maharishi\\" and, the next day, told Harrison that they should leave. According to Harrison, Lennon \\"had wanted to leave anyway\\", to see Ono, and the speculation surrounding Farrow and other female students \\"stirred up a situation\\" that Lennon was able to exploit. Infringements of the Maharishi's ban on alcohol and recreational drugs Deepak Chopra, who was not present but later became a disciple of the Maharishi and a friend of Harrison, said in 2006 that the Maharishi was displeased with the Beatles because they were taking drugs,Associated Press (6 February 2008). \\"Beatles Meditation Guru Maharishi Mahesh Yogi Dies\\". Fox News. Archived from the original on 8 February 2008. Retrieved 23 January 2018. including LSD, at the ashram. Chopra: \\"I'm sure there was never any truth to Lennon's allegations.\\" Members of the Beatles group also violated the Maharishi's \\"no alcohol rule\\" when they consumed \\"hooch\\" that Mardas, whom Cynthia thought was not an active meditator, acquired from a nearby village and shared with the women. Harrison and Lennon did not imbibe and were highly critical of those who did. Massot recalled that he himself arrived at the ashram with a small amount of hashish, which he shared with Lennon. In his autobiography, Donovan writes that when John Farrow arrived, he presented him with a large block of hashish that \\"someone had brought into the ashram\\". Donovan took the block from Farrow's hand and threw it out into the Ganges. Dolan, who stayed in a bungalow next to the one occupied by Mardas and Bonas, said that Bonas \\"openly\\" smoked hashish, and he became used to the \\"familiar smell of very happy herb\\" emanating from their room. According to Chopra, the departure of Lennon and Harrison was not of their own volition but at the request of the Maharishi, due to his disapproval of their entourage taking drugs: \\"[The Maharishi] lost his temper with them. He asked them to leave, and they did in a huff.\\" Lennon and Harrison's departure On the night of 11‚Äì12 April, Lennon, Harrison and Mardas sat up late discussing the Maharishi and decided to leave the next morning. In Brown's description, they argued, and Harrison was \\"furious\\" at Mardas' actions and did not believe \\"a word\\" of the allegations. In the morning, the Beatles and their wives left hurriedly, while Mardas went to Dehradun to find taxis. Lennon was chosen to speak to the Maharishi. Lennon described the exchange in a highly emotional December 1970 interview with Jann Wenner of Rolling Stone, which was later published as the book Lennon Remembers. When the Maharishi asked why they were leaving, Lennon replied, \\"If you're so cosmic, you'll know why.\\" Lennon recalled that his mind was made up when the Maharishi gave him a murderous look in response. Lennon said he was \\"a bit rough to him\\" and the Maharishi responded by saying, \\"I don't know why, you must tell me.\\" According to Mardas' 2010 statement: \\"John Lennon and I went to the Maharishi about what had happened ... he asked the Maharishi to explain himself\\"; and the Maharishi answered Lennon's accusation by saying, \\"I am only human.\\" With regard to his own position, Harrison said that he had already told the Maharishi that he would be leaving before the course relocated to Kashmir, because he was due to participate in the filming of Raga, a documentary about Ravi Shankar, in the south of India. According to Harrison's account of his and Lennon's final conversation with the Maharishi, in the 2000 book The Beatles Anthology, Harrison reminded him of the plan to join Shankar, but the Maharishi was unable to accept it. Harrison added: \\"That's when John said something like, 'Well, you're supposed to be the mystic, you should know.'\\" While waiting for their taxis, Lennon wrote \\"Maharishi\\" (later retitled \\"Sexy Sadie\\"), in which he sang: \\"Maharishi ‚Äì what have you done? / You made a fool of everyone.\\" In a 1974 interview, Lennon said that they were convinced that the delay in the taxis' arrival was orchestrated by locals loyal to the Maharishi, and this paranoia was exacerbated by the presence of \\"the mad Greek\\". According to Cynthia Lennon, when the group finally left the ashram, the Maharishi looked \\"very biblical and isolated in his faith\\". Jenny Boyd later wrote: \\"Poor Maharishi. I remember him standing at the gate of the ashram, under an aide's umbrella, as the Beatles filed by, out of his life. 'Wait,' he cried. 'Talk to me.' But no one listened.\\" After leaving Rishikesh, the taxis repeatedly broke down, leading the Beatles to wonder if the Maharishi had placed a curse on them. The car that the Lennons were in suffered a flat tyre and the driver left them, apparently to find a replacement tyre, but did not return for hours. After it grew dark, the couple hitched a ride to Delhi. They then took the first available flight back to London, during which Lennon drunkenly recounted a litany of his numerous infidelities to Cynthia. Harrison was not ready to return to London and face running Apple and the band's other commitments. In her autobiography, Boyd writes: \\"Instead, we went to see Ravi Shankar and lost ourselves in his music.\\" Harrison said when he got dysentery in Madras that he thought it might have been due to a spell cast by the Maharishi, but he recovered after Shankar gave him some amulets. Aftermath and impact on the Beatles The Beatles' departure and split with the Maharishi was well-publicised. In Delhi, Lennon and Harrison merely told reporters that they had urgent business in London and did not want to appear in the Maharishi's film. Once reunited in the UK, the band announced that they were disillusioned by the Maharishi's desire for financial gain. On 14 May, when Lennon and McCartney, accompanied by Mardas and Derek Taylor, were in New York to launch Apple to the US media, Lennon used his appearance on The Tonight Show to denounce the Maharishi. He told Joe Garagiola (who was guest hosting for Johnny Carson), \\"We believe in meditation, but not the Maharishi and his scene\\", and, \\"We made a mistake. He's human like the rest of us.\\" On another occasion, McCartney said: \\"[The Maharishi]'s a nice fellow. We're just not going out with him any more.\\" By the time he returned to London, on 21 April, Harrison felt that he and Lennon were wrong in the way they had treated the Maharishi. In June, Harrison told reporters in Los Angeles that his dissatisfaction was centred on how the Spiritual Regeneration Movement was \\"too much of an organization\\". Lennon's outspokenness was informed by the sense of personal betrayal he felt towards the Maharishi, and his 1970 Rolling Stone interview represented a purging of his past, in line with the emotional effects of his recent primal therapy treatment under Arthur Janov. In the interview, Lennon referred to \\"a big hullaballo about [the Maharishi] trying to rape Mia Farrow or somebody and trying to get off with a few other women\\", and, since 1968, the allegations concerning Farrow were rumoured to be the cause of the Beatles' split with the Maharishi. Brown wrote in The Love You Make, first published in 1983, that his book told for the first time \\"what really happened in the ashram\\", challenging the \\"widely circulated\\" but incorrect story about Farrow. Reflecting in a 1980 interview, Lennon said he had been \\"bitter\\" after discovering that the Maharishi was \\"human\\", just as he was later about Janov for the same reason. Lennon and Ono holidayed in India in late 1969. According to author Susan Shumsky, a TM devotee, Lennon sent a telegram to the ashram, saying he was in Delhi and urgently wanted to see the Maharishi. As he and his secretary discussed the telegram, the Maharishi repeatedly claimed not to recognise the singer's name, and he shut down the conversation by stating, \\"I do not know a John Lennon.\\" The cover of The Beatles Writing for Mojo magazine in 2003, author and journalist Mark Paytress said that, for many observers, the Beatles' falling out with the Maharishi engendered a long-lasting suspicion that \\"they'd become faddists tipped into eccentric habits by unfathomable fame\\". Having given up touring in 1966, the trip to India was the last time all four Beatles travelled together. Their self-exploration through meditation and before that, LSD, led to each of them adopting a more individual focus, at the expense of band unity, through to the group's break-up in 1970. The acrimony within the band was evident during the recording of their 1968 double album The Beatles (also known as the \\"White Album\\"), when they recorded many of the songs written in Rishikesh. Adding to the tense atmosphere, after Lennon had left his wife, Ono became a constant presence from the start of the sessions and was viewed by the other Beatles as an unwelcome intrusion into the group dynamic. Author Nicholas Schaffner wrote in 1978 that, following their return from Rishikesh, Lennon, Harrison and McCartney were \\"three very different personalities who seldom saw eye-to-eye any more\\". He also said that the trio served as an \\"almost archetypal cross-section\\" of the many young people who progressed from LSD to Indian spirituality during the late 1960s: Lennon \\"continued to drift from one unconventional self-awareness trip to another\\"; Harrison intensified his interest by embracing Krishna Consciousness, or the Hare Krishna movement, under A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami Prabhupada; and McCartney exchanged \\"consciousness expansion\\" for \\"more bourgeois preoccupations\\". Legacy Philip Goldberg, in his book American Veda, writes that the Beatles' trip to Rishikesh \\"may have been the most momentous spiritual retreat since Jesus spent those forty days in the wilderness\\". Despite their rejection of the Maharishi, the Beatles generated wider interest in Transcendental Meditation, which encouraged the study of Eastern spirituality in Western popular culture. Chopra credits Harrison with spreading TM and other Eastern spiritual practices to America almost single- handedly. Spiritual biographer Gary Tillery also recognises the Beatles, or more specifically Harrison, as having \\"abruptly brought Indian spirituality to everyday awareness\\" through their association with the Maharishi. Tillery writes that, while the influence of Indian gurus such as Vivekananda, Yogananda, the Maharishi and Prabhupada was well established by the late 1960s, it was the Beatles' endorsement of their respective philosophies that most contributed to yoga and meditation centres becoming ubiquitous in Western cities and towns over subsequent decades. According to author Andrew Grant Jackson: > The Beats had promoted Buddhism since the 1950s, but it was George > Harrison's songs espousing Hindu philosophy and featuring Indian musicians, > and the Beatles' study of Transcendental Meditation, that truly kick-started > the human potential movement of the 1970s (rebranded New Age in the 1980s). > In this way, the musicians helped expand the freedom of religion the United > States was founded on to encompass options outside the Judeo-Christian > tradition. The Maharishi in 1973 Mike Love arranged for the Beach Boys to tour the United States with the Maharishi in May 1968. However, the tour was cancelled after several appearances and was called \\"one of the more bizarre entertainments of the era\\". After 1968 the Maharishi fell out of the public spotlight for a period and TM was described as a passing fad. Interest grew again in the 1970s when scientific studies began showing concrete results. The Maharishi appeared twice on American television's The Merv Griffin Show in the mid 1970s, leading to a surge of popularity called the \\"Merv wave\\" that lasted until the end of the decade. In a 1975 interview, Harrison said of the Beatles' association with TM: \\"In retrospect, that was probably one of the greatest experiences I've ever had ‚Ä¶ Maharishi was always put down for propagating what was basically a spiritual thing but there's so much being propagated that's damaging to life that I'm glad there are good people around like him.\\" In 1978 Lennon wrote that he considered his meditation a \\"source of creative inspiration\\". Despite Lennon's public denouncing of the Maharishi, according to Tillery, \\"for the rest of his life he often turned to meditation to restore himself and improve his creativity.\\" In her 2005 book Gurus in America, author Cynthia Ann Humes comments that although the split between the Beatles and Maharishi was widely reported, there has been \\"little mention\\" of \\"the continued positive relationship Maharishi maintained\\" with Harrison and McCartney. During the 1990s, Harrison and McCartney were so convinced of the Maharishi's innocence on the issue of sexual impropriety that they each offered their apologies. Harrison gave a benefit concert for the Maharishi- associated Natural Law Party in 1992, and later apologised for the way the Maharishi had been treated by saying, \\"We were very young.\\" In The Beatles Anthology, he stated: \\"It's probably in the history books that Maharishi 'tried to attack Mia Farrow' ‚Äì but it's bullshit, total bullshit.\\"(6 March 2008) Rolling Stone magazine Asked if he forgave the Beatles, following Harrison's public apology in 1991, the Maharishi replied, \\"I could never be upset with angels.\\" McCartney took his daughter Stella to visit the Maharishi in the Netherlands in 2007, which renewed their friendship. Satsang Hall in the abandoned ashram, in 2012 By the time of the Maharishi's death in 2008, more than 5 million people had learned Transcendental Meditation, and his worldwide movement was valued in the billions of dollars. After the Maharishi died, McCartney said: \\"my memories of him will only be joyful ones. He was a great man who worked tirelessly for the people of the world and the cause of unity.\\" Starr said in 2008, \\"I feel so blessed I met the Maharishi ‚Äì he gave me a mantra that no one can take away, and I still use it\\". Representing her late husband, Yoko Ono said: \\"John would have been the first one now, if he had been here, to recognize and acknowledge what Maharishi has done for the world and appreciate it.\\" In 2009, McCartney, Starr, Donovan and Horn reunited at a concert held at New York's Radio City Music Hall to benefit the David Lynch Foundation, which funds the teaching of Transcendental Meditation in schools. A 2011 article titled \\"Celebrities Who Meditate\\", in The Daily Telegraph, reported Harrison as having said: \\"Maharishi only ever did good for us, and although I have not been with him physically, I never left him.\\" In 2007, Indian-born American film-maker Mira Nair said she had begun work on a documentary film about the Beatles' visit to India. Paul Saltzman's photographs from the retreat have been displayed in galleries throughout North America and in a permanent exhibition above the retail units in the departure lounge of Liverpool John Lennon Airport. In February 2018, the 50th anniversary of Lennon and Harrison's arrival in Rishikesh was marked by the opening of a two-year exhibition titled The Beatles in India at the Beatles Story museum in Liverpool. A similar celebration took place at the ashram site, now known as Beatles Ashram. The exhibition in Liverpool was announced as featuring memorabilia, photographs by Saltzman, a sitar courtesy of the Ravi Shankar Foundation, and video contributions from Pattie and Jenny Boyd. Songs written by the Beatles in Rishikesh The Beatles wrote many songs during their visit to Rishikesh: 30 by one count, 48 by another. Lennon said: \\"We wrote about thirty new songs between us. Paul must have done about a dozen. George says he's got six, and I wrote fifteen. And look what meditation did for Ringo ‚Äì after all this time he wrote his first song.\\" Many of the songs became part of the White Album, while others appeared on Abbey Road in 1969 or on solo records.

George Gasc√≥n previously served as an Assistant Chief of Police for the LAPD, and Chief of Police in Mesa, Arizona and San Francisco. Gasc√≥n was born in Havana, Cuba. In 1954, his family immigrated to the United States and settled in Bell, California. He joined the United States Army at the age of eighteen and became a sergeant. After earning a bachelor of arts in history from California State-Long Beach, Gasc√≥n joined the Los Angeles Police Department as a patrol officer. During his tenure with the Los Angeles Police Department, he attained the rank of Assistant Chief of Police under Chief William Bratton. In 2006, Gasc√≥n was appointed as Chief of Police for the Mesa Police Department. He had frequent clashes with Maricopa County Sheriff Joe Arpaio over immigration sweeps targeting Latinos. In 2009, then-Mayor Gavin Newsom appointed Gasc√≥n as the Chief of Police for the San Francisco Police Department. In 2011, after Kamala Harris was elected California Attorney General, Newsom appointed Gasc√≥n to be the San Francisco District Attorney. In 2019, Gasc√≥n announced he was running to be the District Attorney for Los Angeles County.  Early life and education  In 1954, Gasc√≥n was born in pre-communist Cuba. Shortly after the communist revolution in Cuba, Gasc√≥n's father lost his job for alleged anti- government activity, and his uncle, a union organizer, was jailed for over a decade. In 1967, Gasc√≥n and his family immigrated from Cuba to the United States. The Gasc√≥n family settled in Bell, California, a suburb of Los Angeles. At the age of thirteen, Gasc√≥n enrolled in Los Angeles Unified School District schools where he struggled to learn English. He recalled: \\"I was spending hours translating everything with a Spanish-English dictionary. I started missing a lot of school.\\" By 1972, he dropped out of Bell High School. Gasc√≥n joined the United States Army in 1972. In the army, he earned his high school diploma and two years toward an undergraduate degree. Gasc√≥n served in the 64th Military Police Detachment, much of it in Germany. In 1975, he received an honorable discharge as a sergeant. After the Army, Gasc√≥n completed a bachelor of arts in history from California State-Long Beach while working sales jobs.  Los Angeles Police Department  In 1978, Gasc√≥n joined the Los Angeles Police Department as a patrol officer. After a three-year stint with the LAPD, he returned to work in business management. He served as a reserve officer in the Hollenbeck Division of LAPD until 1987. In 1987, he returned to LAPD as a full-time police officer. Upon his return, he rose through the ranks of LAPD as a Sergeant, Lieutenant, Captain, Commander, and Deputy Chief in 2002. During his time with LAPD, Gasc√≥n earned his J.D. degree from Western State College of Law in 1996.  Training Commander after Rampart Scandal  In 2000, he took command of the LAPD training unit at the height of the Rampart Scandal. He was in command of the LAPD training unit, overseeing the LAPD Academy and in-service training, during the federal government's oversight of police reforms. Even though there was a mandate for reform, then-Police Chief Bernard Parks did not allocate funding for additional training. Gasc√≥n utilized a grant that had originally been funded to research community-policing strategies, and produced three hundred thousand additional training hours. One of his first orders as training commander was to create an ethics training manual for the LAPD. He also implemented problem- based learning and posted a copy of the bill of rights in every LAPD classroom. Michael Gennaco, the former head of the United States Justice Department's civil rights division said at the time: ‚ÄúHe fundamentally changed the way the LAPD teaches its officers about civil rights.‚Äù In 2002, Gasc√≥n applied to be the Los Angeles Police Department Chief of Police. He wanted to partner with community agencies to reduce California's prisoner-recidivism rate. William Bratton was ultimately appointed Chief of Police.  Assistant Chief of Police  In 2003, he was sworn in as Assistant Chief of the Los Angeles Police Department under Chief William Bratton. In 2004, Gasc√≥n oversaw the daily operations of the department. William Bratton credited Gasc√≥n with helping reduce the rate of violent crime in Los Angeles at that time.  Mesa Chief of Police  In 2006, Gasc√≥n was hired as Chief of Police for the Mesa Police Department. Gasc√≥n had frequent clashes with Maricopa County Sheriff Joe Arpaio over immigration sweeps targeting Latinos. Joe Arpaio regularly conducted saturation patrols and immigration sweeps, targeting Latino neighborhoods and day laborers. Arpaio illegally stopped cars with Latino drivers or passengers to check their immigration status. Gasc√≥n condemned the policies and tactics of Arpaio and his deputies, and actively worked to protect the Latino community in Mesa. Gasc√≥n served as chief of the Mesa, Arizona police department from 2006 to 2009.Mayor Picks Arizona Chief Retrieved April 24, 2018  San Francisco Chief of Police  Gasc√≥n served as San Francisco Police Department chief from August 2009 to January 2011, succeeding Heather Fong. He was replaced by Greg Suhr.From High School Dropout to Police Chief Referenced October 9th, 2019 In 2009, San Francisco saw a significant drop in homicides, falling from 96 in 2008 to 45 in 2009. Between 2009 and 2011, violent crime decreased in San Francisco. San Francisco District Attorney In 2011, in his last act as Mayor of San Francisco, Gavin Newsom appointed Gasc√≥n as San Francisco District Attorney, filling the seat vacated by Kamala Harris. In 2018, Gasc√≥n announced that he would not be seeking re-election, citing his need to care for his mother in Los Angeles. He resigned from his San Francisco District Attorney position in October 2019.  Bail reform  Gasc√≥n advocated for the end of monetary bail.State must make cash bail system just and protect public safety Referenced October 9, 2019 Gasc√≥n brought the Public Safety Assessment (‚ÄúPSA‚Äù) tool to San Francisco to assist courts in making bail decisions more equitably. Initial results indicate that, compared to defendants released by the PSA, double the percentage of defendants were arrested while they were out on bail or their own recognizance.Bail or Jail? Tool Used by San Francisco Courts Shows Promising Results Referenced October 9, 2019  Criticism  During Gascon's time as District Attorney, property crime increased by 49%. Some of Gascon's critics have blamed this increase on his office's reluctance to file charges against low-level offenders; during Gascon's tenure, misdemeanor charges were only filed in 40% of cases presented by the San Francisco Police Department. Having worked with Gascon, San Francisco Mayor London Breed and City Attorney Dennis Herrera declined to endorse him in his bid to become the District Attorney of Los Angeles County; Breed and Herrera instead endorsed his opponent, the incumbent Jackie Lacey.  Drug policy  In 2018, Gasc√≥n announced that he would apply California's Adult Use of Marijuana Act retroactively to every marijuana case since 1975 in order to level the playing field for those adversely affected by the criminalization of marijuana. The move cleared misdemeanor convictions and reduced felony convictions for those entitled for record relief under the act.San Francisco To Expunge Thousands Of Marijuana Convictions Referenced October 9, 2019 He partnered with Code for America, a 501(c)3 non-profit organization, which kicked off a national movement resulting in dozens of cities across the country clearing marijuana convictions.SF district attorney to wipe out 9,000-plus pot cases going back to 1975 Referenced October 9, 2019 Gasc√≥n supports ending the war on drugs.

He described the program as ‚Äúa hybrid of the adult and juvenile justice systems tailored to the biology and circumstances of offenders 18 to 24.‚Äù In the program, a prosecutor refers a case to the Alternative Sentencing Planner (ASP) who determines if alternatives to incarceration in the community are appropriate. In 2019, Gasc√≥n supported San Francisco's move to close juvenile Hall, citing studies showing that incarceration of juveniles significantly increases a young person's likelihood of recidivism and that \\"California‚Äôs juvenile facilities aren‚Äôt rehabilitating kids or making our communities safer.\\"  Legislation  Gasc√≥n coauthored Senate Bill 962, legislation requiring a ‚Äúkill switch‚Äù on all smartphones sold in California.Cell Phone Thefts Decrease in S.F.

Los Angeles County District Attorney Race In 2019, Gasc√≥n announced he was running to be the District Attorney for Los Angeles County. The Los Angeles Police Protective League contributed one million dollars to defeat Gasc√≥n. During the race, he indicated that he supported creating a civil rights division within the Los Angeles County District Attorney's Office. Policy positions Large-Capacity Magazines In 2013, Gasc√≥n wrote an op-ed in support of the ban of large capacity gun magazines (devices that hold more than ten bullets).

Its first name was \\"Bulgarian Macedonian-Adrianople Revolutionary Committees\\", which was later changed several times. IMRO was active not only in Macedonia but also in Thrace (the Vilayet of Adrianople). Since its early name emphasized the Bulgarian nature of the organization by linking the inhabitants of Thrace and Macedonia to Bulgaria, these facts are still difficult to be explained from the Macedonian historiography. They suggest that IMRO revolutionaries in the Ottoman period did not differentiate between ‚ÄòMacedonians‚Äô and ‚ÄòBulgarians‚Äô. Moreover, as their own writings attest, they often saw themselves and their compatriots as ‚ÄòBulgarians‚Äô. All of them wrote in standard Bulgarian language.

At the beginning of the 20th century, Slavic patriots in Macedonia felt a strong attachment to Macedonia as a multi-ethnic homeland. They imagined a Macedonian community uniting themselves with non-Slavic Macedonians... Most of these Macedonian Slavs also saw themselves as Bulgarians. By the middle of the 20th. century, however Macedonian patriots began to see Macedonian and Bulgarian loyalties as mutually exclusive. Regional Macedonian nationalism had become ethnic Macedonian nationalism... This transformation shows that the content of collective loyalties can shift.Region, Regional Identity and Regionalism in Southeastern Europe, Ethnologia Balkanica Series, Klaus Roth, Ulf Brunnbauer, LIT Verlag M√ºnster, 2010, p. 127., Up until the early 20th century and beyond, the international community viewed Macedonians as regional variety of Bulgarians, i.e. Western Bulgarians.Nationalism and Territory: Constructing Group Identity in Southeastern Europe, Geographical perspectives on the human past : Europe: Current Events, George W.

Historical Dictionary of the Republic of Macedonia, Historical Dictionaries of Europe, Scarecrow Press, 2009, , Introduction.The political and military leaders of the Slavs of Macedonia at the turn of the century seem not to have heard the call for a separate Macedonian national identity; they continued to identify themselves in a national sense as Bulgarians rather than Macedonians.[...] (They) never seem to have doubted \\"the predominantly Bulgarian character of the population of Macedonia\\". \\"The Macedonian conflict: ethnic nationalism in a transnational world\\", Princeton University Press, Danforth, Loring M. 1997, , p. 64.The modern Macedonian historiographic equation of IMRO demands for autonomy with a separate and distinct national identity does not necessarily jibe with the historical record. A rather obvious problem is the very title of the organization, which included Thrace in addition to Macedonia. Thrace whose population was never claimed by modern Macedonian nationalism...There is, moreover, the not less complicated issue of what autonomy meant to the people who espoused it in their writings. According to Hristo Tatarchev, their demand for autonomy was motivated not by an attachment to Macedonian national identity but out of concern that an explicit agenda of unification with Bulgaria would provoke other small Balkan nations and the Great Powers to action. Macedonian autonomy, in other words, can be seen as a tactical diversion, or as ‚ÄúPlan B‚Äù of Bulgarian unification. ƒ∞pek Yosmaoƒülu, Blood Ties: Religion, Violence and the Politics of Nationhood in Ottoman Macedonia, 1878‚Äì1908, Cornell University Press, 2013, , pp. 15-16. an Internal Macedonian-Adrianople Revolutionary Organization (IMARO) leader of revolutionary bands in the regions of Skopje and Kumanovo. Biography Vasil Stoyanov was born in 1880 in the village of Adzhalari, in the Sanjak of √úsk√ºp of the Kosovo Vilayet of the Ottoman Empire (present-day North Macedonia). He received his nickname after this village, which is now known as Miladinovci. In 1901 he moved with his family in Skopje. He entered IMARO and realized a series of tasks for the Organization ‚Äì he carried post, hid and purchased weapons, but he was arrested and spent two years in the prison Kur≈°umli An. He got released after an amnesty. In 1903, he became an illegal freedom fighter and at first he was an assistant of the band leader Sande ƒåolakot in Kumanovo. Later, he entered the revolutionary band of Bobi Stoychev and after that he himself became a leader, in the regions of Skopska Crna Gora and Blatija, under the supervision of Dame Martinov. Adzhalarski distinguished himself from the other freedom fighters with the assassination of several Muslim beys who were suppressing the local Bulgarian inhabitants.–°–Ω–µ–≥–∞—Ä–æ–≤, –ò–≤–∞–Ω. –í–∞—Å–∏–ª –ê–¥–∂–∞—Ä–ª–∞—Ä—Å–∫–∏, –†–æ–¥–∏–Ω–∞ (–°–∫–æ–ø–∏–µ), –≥. –Ü–Ü–Ü, –±—Ä. 660, 8 —é–ª–∏ 1918, —Å. 2-3. In 1905, Vasil Adzhalarski became a regional leader of the Skopje region. From the end of 1904 until 1908 his revolutionary band conducted more than 10 massive battles with the Turkish military. Adzhalarski also took several successful actions against the armed Serbian propaganda. As a response to the murders of seven Macedonians from the Chair neighborhood by a Serbian band, he killed 9 Serbomans in Brodec, after which the Serbian bands ceased this type of actions. In February 1907, he burned the Han in the village of Sopishte, that served as a base for the traverse of the Serbian bands to the region of Porece. After the Young Turk Revolution in 1908, he was no more a freedom fighter, but he was killed in an ambush by the Ottoman authorities in Skopje in 1909.–ï–Ω—Ü–∏–∫–ª–æ–ø–µ–¥–∏—è –ë—ä–ª–≥–∞—Ä–∏—è, —Ç–æ–º 1, –ò–∑–¥–∞—Ç–µ–ª—Å—Ç–≤–æ –Ω–∞ –ë–ê–ù, –°–æ—Ñ–∏—è, 1978.

Marcas is a novelette by French author Honor√© de Balzac first published in 1840. Set in contemporary Paris, it describes the rise and fall of a brilliant political strategist abandoned by the politicians he helps into power. Destitute and forgotten, he befriends a pair of students who live next door to him in a boarding-house. The story follows their many discussions about the political situation in France. Balzac was inspired to write the story after spotting the name \\"Z. Marcas\\" on a sign for a tailor's shop in Paris. It was published in July 1840, in the Revue Parisienne, a magazine he had founded that year. One year later, it appeared in a collection from various authors under the title La Mort d'un ambitieux (\\"The Death of an Ambitious Man\\"). Balzac later placed it in the Sc√®nes de la vie politique section of his vast novel sequence La Com√©die humaine. Although Z. Marcas features characters from other Balzac stories and elements of literary realism ‚Äì both hallmarks of Balzac's style ‚Äì it is remembered primarily for its political themes. Balzac, a legitimist, believed that France's lack of bold leadership had led to mediocrity and ruin, and that men of quality were being ignored or worse. He maintained that the youth of France were in danger of being abandoned by the government, and predicted unrest in the years to come. The story also explores Balzac's conviction that a person's name is a powerful indicator of his or her destiny, an idea he drew from the work of Laurence Sterne. The title character, with his keen intellect, is based on Balzac's conception of himself: a visionary genius who fails to achieve his true potential because of less talented individuals with more social power.  Background  Balzac presented himself as a legitimist candidate for Parliament.Robb, p. 192. Honor√© de Balzac was drawn to a diversity of interests throughout his life, from business to politics. After studying the law for three years, he wrote a number of potboiler novels under various pseudonyms. He also lost large sums of borrowed money in the publishing trade, attempting to capitalize on cheap editions of classical works. By 1828 he owed his mother 50,000 francs.Robb, pp. 27‚Äì53 and 138. Although his views on politics were always changing, Balzac was primarily a legitimist who supported the House of Bourbon and believed that the July Revolution of 1830 had left France without strong leadership. In 1832 he declared his intent to run for the Chamber of Deputies in the French Parliament. A variety of problems prevented his actual candidacy, but he mounted a serious campaign which was met mostly with ridicule by the press. Referring to Balzac's breakthrough 1831 novel La Peau de chagrin (\\"The Wild Ass's Skin\\"), the newspaper Le Figaro mused: \\"This is the first time anyone has been seen caressing the voters with an ass's skin.\\"Quoted in Robb, pp. 191‚Äì192. Although he later showed renewed interest in public office, he mostly expressed his political views through writing.Robb, pp. 211 and 300. In July 1840 he attempted to fuse his desire to make money with his politics by founding a magazine called the Revue Parisienne, funded by his friend Armand Dutacq. Having already worked in the publishing industry, Balzac believed he had learned all there was to know about the trade. \\"[T]hat gigantic machine known as journalism\\", he wrote, \\"is as simple as a roasting spit turned by a poodle.\\"Quoted in Robb, p. 326. Balzac planned to publish his own fiction in the Revue Parisienne, in part to challenge the popularity of the roman- feuilleton serial format.Maurois, p. 382. Dutacq, however, stopped funding the project in September, after only three issues, and Balzac's final foray into the world of publishing came to an end.Robb, p. 328.  Writing and publication  Balzac told his friend L√©on Gozlan that (\\"I am not alone in my belief in this marvelous alliance of the name and the man.\\")Gozlan, p. 100. In the summer of 1840, Balzac had a discussion with his friend L√©on Gozlan about the power of a person's name. In his comic essay Balzac en pantoufles, Gozlan recounted his associate's insistence: (\\"We are named up there [in heaven] before being named down here. It's a mystery to which it's not suitable to apply, for the sake of understanding, the little rules of our slight reasoning.\\")Quoted in Hunt, p. 254. Balzac insisted to Gozlan that by searching through the streets of Paris, they would find a name suitable for a character he had imagined, a political genius thwarted by the mediocrity of the time. They finally came upon a tailor's sign that enraptured Balzac, bearing the name Z. Marcas. He believed that the name suggested (\\"some mysterious fatality\\"), and chose it for his story's protagonist. He wrote the 30-page story soon afterwards.Sandars, Chapter II; Hunt, p. 254; Maurois, p. 382. Balzac published Z. Marcas in the first issue of the Revue Parisienne, 25 July 1840.Saintsbury, p. xiii; Pugh, p. 247. Dedinsky gives the original publication date as 25 August. It was republished a year later under the title La Mort d'un ambitieux (\\"The Death of an Ambitious Man\\"), in a collection from various authors called Le Fruit d√©fendu (\\"Forbidden Fruit\\"). Shortly before his death, Balzac placed the story in the Sc√®nes de la vie politique section of his collection La Com√©die humaine.Saintsbury, p. xiii.  Synopsis  The story is told from the point of view of a first-person narrator, about whom little is revealed before the final pages. Before the story itself, an extended meditation appears on the nature of human names, and that of Z. Marcas specifically: The narrator, Charles, lives with his friend Juste in a large boarding-house populated almost entirely with students like themselves (Charles is studying law and Juste medicine). The sole exception is their middle-aged neighbor, Z. Marcas, of whom they see only momentary glimpses in the hall. They learn that he is a copyist, and living on an extremely small salary. When the students find themselves lacking the funds for tobacco, Marcas offers them some of his own. They become friends, and he tells them the story of his political career. Recognizing at an early age that he had an incisive mind for politics, Marcas had allied himself with an unnamed man of some fame who lacked wisdom and insight. They became a team, with the other man serving as the public face and Marcas as the advisor. Once his associate had ascended into office, however, he abandoned Marcas, then hired and abandoned him again. Marcas was left poor and unknown, resigned to duplicate the writing of others for very little pay. Eventually his politician friend seeks his help for a third time. Marcas is dismissive, but the students convince him to give the process one last chance. After three months, Marcas appears at the boarding house again, sick and exhausted. The politician never visits Marcas, who soon dies. The students are the only mourners at his funeral, and ‚Äì disheartened by the tragedy ‚Äì leave France.  Characters  The students compare Z. Marcas to the failed ambition of bygone empires, and call him (\\"The ruins of Palmyra in the desert\\").Balzac, p. 348. Original French is at French Wikisource. In addition to his distinctive name, Z. Marcas has a remarkable appearance which his neighbors notice immediately. The story's first line refers to his (\\"striking\\") appearance. As usual in his later work, Balzac describes Marcas by relating him to an animal: \\"L'animal de Marcas √©tait le lion. Ses cheveux ressemblaient √† une crini√®re, son nez √©tait court, √©cras√©, large et fendu au bout comme celui d'un lion, il avait le front partag√© comme celui d'un lion par un sillon puissant, divis√© en deux lobes vigoureux.\\" (\\"The animal for Marcas was the lion. His hair was like a mane, his nose was short and flat; broad and dented at the tip like a lion's; his brow, like a lion's, was strongly marked with a deep median furrow, dividing two powerful bosses.\\")Balzac, p. 347. Original French is at French Wikisource. Marcas appears to be destined for greatness; he is described as having tremendous spirit, sound but speedy judgment, and comprehensive knowledge of public manners.Besser, p. 90. His gaze has (\\"a power\\"), which he tries not to use, since it has brought him nothing but misery in the past.Besser, p. 143. Despite these innate proficiencies, however, the political genius living in the students' midst requires their aid to dress himself when official company comes to call.Besser, p. 96. The character of Z. Marcas nonetheless represents a fiery drive to succeed in the world of politics, an acute mind seeking to do good in the public sphere. One critic calls him \\"ambition in its pure state\\".Marceau, p. 173. Like other persons of genius in La Com√©die humaine, Marcas is seen as a reflection of Balzac's own ego and desire. Like Marcas, the author dreamed of fame and positive influence; as Balzac believed himself to be, the character is dismissed and manipulated by mediocre minds. Even their work habits ‚Äì toiling at their desks throughout the night ‚Äì are similar.Marceau, pp. 73 and 175‚Äì176.  Recurring characters  Balzac began using characters from earlier works in his 1835 novel Le P√®re Goriot, and made the technique a hallmark of his fiction. In the case of Z. Marcas, the narrator ‚Äì Charles Rabourdin, whose identity is only revealed at the end of the story ‚Äì is in fact the son of a central character from Balzac's 1837 tale La Femme sup√©rieure. The title character of that story is married to Xavier Rabourdin, who is unjustly ignored for a promotion to the head of his civil service department. At the end of the La Femme sup√©rieure, Rabourdin pledges to his wife that they will enjoy success in the world of business. His son's poverty in Z. Marcas is evidence of his failure.Pugh, p. 157; Pasco, p. 122. Charles Rabourdin's interactions with Marcas echo the difficulties he saw in his father's government career. As critic Herbert J. Hunt notes, Marcas \\"represents in the political sphere what Rabourdin represents in the administrative sphere\\".Hunt, p. 253. Allan H. Pasco echoes this point: \\"Charles has had the lesson of futility from two tutors: his father and Marcas. Outstanding men have no future in politics, in the administration, or in business ‚Äì at least not in France.\\"Pasco, pp. 122‚Äì123. Balzac's use of recurring characters provides unparalleled depth and characterization for his readers. \\"This technique\\", insists critic Mary Susan McCarthy, \\"not only furnished him with a unifying principle but also offers the reader a network of relationships through which to unite the many separate stories and novels in which the characters appear, forming the fictional universe that is La Com√©die humaine.\\"McCarthy, p. 94. Some readers, however, are intimidated by the depth created by these interdependent stories, and feel deprived of important context for the characters. Detective novelist Arthur Conan Doyle said that he never tried to read Balzac, because he \\"did not know where to begin\\".Quoted in Robb, p. 254; see generally Pugh. Z. Marcas himself appears in one other Balzac story, Un prince de la boh√®me, which the author revised twice before it appeared in its final form. In the 1846 edition, the character of Marcel has been changed to Marcas; but this may have been a printer's error. As Anthony Pugh explains: \\"This detail is inexplicable; the principal character of Z. Marcas, who does not otherwise appear outside his own story, seems a very unlikely candidate for the role. Could it be a misprint?\\"Pugh, p. 415.  Style  Pitt, who made England his wife\\").Balzac, p. 363. Original French is at French Wikisource. Balzac was known for his use of realism, including exquisite detail when describing people and locations. His fanaticism about the name Z. Marcas is cited as an example of the author's \\"zeal\\" for \\"close local color\\".Dargan (1932), p. 29. Balzac's belief in the connection between one's name and one's destiny is brought to the fore; the pattern demonstrated in Z. Marcas reflects many in the larger collection of Balzac's work. As critic Charles Affron puts it: \\"The creator of a universe so tied up with inner rhythms and resounding with so many echoes does not hesitate to imply that the germs of a character's failure can be found in the physical qualities of his name.\\"Affron, p. 129. This idea came to Balzac from Laurence Sterne, as he acknowledged in his 1841 story Ursule Mirou√´t: (\\"Should we not agree with Sterne in recognizing the occult power in names, which sometimes mock and sometimes define the characters of their possessors?\\")Quoted in Marceau, p. 253. Original French is at French Wikisource. Z. Marcas includes many other examples of realist detail as well. The students live in shabby environs, furnished by (\\"only a scrap of thin carpet\\").Balzac, p. 343. Original French is at French Wikisource. They share (\\"a tawny twig of Turkish tobacco\\")Balzac, p. 352. Original French is at French Wikisource. with their neighbor, and the three discuss political personalities drawn directly from recent history, including William Pitt the Elder and the Voltigeurs.Balzac, pp. 363 and 364. Still, realist detail is not commonly in the foreground of commentary about Z. Marcas. As Hunt explains, it is mostly remembered \\"as a vehicle for a characteristic Balzacian whimsy\\".Hunt, p. 255.  Politics and society  Z. Marcas is best known for its reflection of Balzac's political views, specifically the neglect of talent and ability in a sea of republican mediocrity; and the abandonment of young people by older generations. Pasco suggests: \\"'Z. Marcas' has then become, not the story of one particular, political failure, not the story of a young man of potential who abandons France for Malaysia, but the story of France herself, wasting away and thus losing her greatest resource ‚Äì her youth.\\"Pasco, p. 124. Balzac believed that the July Monarchy had brought a wave of poor leadership, and that people of quality and integrity were scorned in the name of cronyism. Marcas, a prime example of such a man, is doomed to fail in the government of Louis-Philippe.Affron, p. 128; Pasco, p. 122. Those in power were blind to the valuable minds being lost in their midst, as the students discover early in the story: (\\"we were amazed at the brutal indifference of the authorities to everything connected with intellect, thought, and poetry\\").Balzac, p. 345. Original French is at French Wikisource. Marcas' personal woes ‚Äì and his tales of life within the corridors of power ‚Äì strongly reinforce this view.Besser, p. 33. Through Marcas, Balzac claimed that young people in France were being ignored by government officials, and predicted an uprising: As Graham Robb indicates in his 1994 biography, Balzac's words were an accurate prediction of the 1848 Revolution.Robb, p. 315. Public opposition to the monarchy exploded in February of that year, Louis-Philippe was forced to abdicate, and the Second Republic was founded.Butler, pp. 242‚Äì249.  Legacy  Although Balzac's Revue Parisienne lasted only three issues, Z. Marcas has remained a moderately popular story. Hunt notes that it has \\"only subsidiary value\\", but biographer Andr√© Maurois calls it \\"an admirable tale\\". Robb notes that Z. Marcas was an important herald of political realities to come, and provided a warning to the political class of the time.Robb, pp. 315 and 327. As critic F√©licien Marceau points out, however, the greatest value of Z Marcas may have been for the author himself.  Notes   References  * Affron, Charles.

Gameplay  The player takes control of a single \\"Mauler\\" assault tank in a series of combat missions against other armoured vehicles and stationary targets. Unlike Carrier Command which incorporated significant strategic elements, Battle Command is a simple arcade game reminiscent of Battlezone. The player views the battle from the forward perspective of the tank. As with Battlezone, the turret is fixed and cannot be rotated or elevated. However the playing area is flat and shells travel in long horizontal trajectories, so to aim the gun the tank is simply rotated left or right. The player may equip their tank with a variety of weapons, the choice of which will depend on the nature of the mission. The Helicarrier will then drop the tank into the combat zone to carry out its objectives. On successful completion of the mission the Helicarrier will retrieve the Mauler and carry it to safety. There are ten missions in all to complete.

It was a bestseller. Dedicated \\"to all noble souls\\", and clearly imitating Die Leiden des jungen Werthers, the novel tells two parallel love stories, one happy, the other sad (as foretold by a gypsy woman at the beginning of Part Two). It was published by Weygand at Leipzig. Plot introduction A man from Oettingen in Bayern named Xaver Siegwart, the youngest of five siblings, has grown up on the banks of the Danube after the early death of his mother. Restless and active as a boy, excited at the idea of becoming a hunter like his father, he becomes an impressionable youth, in love with silence and the natural world. He accompanies his father to a Capuchin monastery where he is visiting his friend Father Anton. After walking through a beautiful wood, they arrive just as the sun is setting among the oaks, and the impressions made by the play of light on wet cobwebs, the sounds of the bells, and the saintliness of the monks, lead him to religion. Years later he travels to Ingolstadt with the fixed purpose of entering the ministry. But his plans are disrupted by the social whirl of Ingolstadt, firstly by his entanglement with a woman named Sophie who has fallen violently in love with him, and secondly when he himself falls in love with Mariane Fischer. The match is encouraged by his friend Kronhelm, who admits his own love for Xaver's sister Therese. Mariane returns Xaver's passion, but her father, a court councillor, wishes her to marry another councillor's son, and after facing her intransigence he forces her to enter a convent, where she falls gravely ill. Xaver plans to elope with her, but he is given false news of her death, and he himself enters a monastery. Four years later he encounters her by accident and recognizes her as his Mariane -- but she is at the point of death, and soon afterwards he dies also of grief, found sprawled in the moonlight at her grave. This dismal ending is mitigated only by the happy marriage of Kronhelm and Therese Siegwart. An English translation by Laetitia Matilda Hawkins, Siegwart, a Monastic Tale, appeared in 1806.

Two versions of the legend exist, one involving a burnt insane asylum and the other an eccentric doctor. Both agree that there are seven gates in a wooded area of Hellam Township, Pennsylvania, and that anyone who passes through all seven goes straight to Hell. The location in question never housed an institution; the aforementioned doctor only constructed one gate, to keep out trespassers. Despite the popularity of this as a tourist destination, the property is privately held; visitors may be charged with trespassing as a result. Myth There are two popular versions of the myth, each with numerous variations. One states that a mental institution used to be located on either Toad Road or Trout Run Road, depending on the source, in Hellam Township, Pennsylvania. It was erected in a remote location so as to isolate people deemed insane from the rest of the world. One day in the 1900s, a fire broke out and, due to its remoteness, firefighters could not reach the hospital in time to save it. Many patients died in the flames, while others escaped and were soon beaten to death. The gates' role in the story is disputed. Some say that the gates were put up by the local search party to trap the remaining inmates. Others say that, completely unrelated to the asylum story, an eccentric physician who lived on the property built several gates along a path deep into the forest. Both accounts agree on only one gate being visible during the day, but the other six can be seen at night. According to the legend, no one has ever passed the fifth gate, but if they passed all seven, they would go directly to Hell. Reality In reality, there is no road called \\"Toad Road\\" in Hellam Township, but there is one named Trout Run Road. There was no asylum on Trout Run Road, and the local doctor only put up one gate to keep out trespassers. A related myth states that Hellam was named after Hell; this is untrue as well, as it is a corruption of Hallam, after Hallamshire, England. The area purported to be the location of the seven gates is on private property and trespassers can be prosecuted. Notoriety The Seven Gates of Hell have received a fair amount of attention. Mike Argento wrote about it in the York Daily Record, and Matt Lake featured a section on the gates in his book, Weird Pennsylvania.Matt Lake, Weird Pennsylvania: Your Travel Guide to Pennsylvania's Local Legends and Best Kept Secrets, Sterling Publishing, 2009, ; p. 20 Hellam Township published a page debunking the myths. Local resident Cheryl Englar reported a number of tourists searching for the gates, some harassing her and giving her cause to call the police. In media Toad Road, a 2012 independent psychological horror film, makes use of the legend.

Because they were here, they need not be forgotten!\\" Monument and gravestones dedicated to Queen City dead, next to Lake Binder, Iowa Queen City was an Adams County, Iowa farming town located about three miles (5 km) northeast of present-day Corning, Iowa, and northwest of the Icarian commune with which it shared a post office. Queen City co-existed with the Icarian colony and was possibly created before the Icarian society was founded in 1854. The town was officially platted in October 1857, after three men purchased from landowner Samuel Larimer for development. Larimer was named Queen City's first postmaster in 1858 when the post office was moved from Icaria. The town grew to a population of about 150, at its peak in the 1860s, and had general stores, a drug store, doctor's office, and two hotels. However, Queen City's fortunes declined when Corning was selected as the local railroad stop in 1869 and county seat in 1872. The number of residents dwindled, and the plat for the town returned to private ownership in March 1885. U.S. Census records reflect that the township in Adams County where Queen City was located was called Queen City Township as of 1860 (pop. 212). However, the name was changed to Prescott Township in 1873.1860 Census of Adams County, Iowa at Kinyon Digital Library1860 U.S. Census, p. 1391870 U.S. Census, Table III, p.1311880 U.S. Census, Table III, p.159 Queen City was all but forgotten, and not a significant part of written Adams County history, until Lake Binder was created as a water supply for nearby Corning. When the lake was dug, some tombstones and an estimated 200 gravesites were found. The remains and gravestones were moved to a new location, today just north of the lake, where a monument was built marking the abandoned town in 1980.

June, 2014. A PYO farm might be preferred by people who like to select fresh, high quality, vine-ripened produce themselves at lower prices. Advantages of You-Pick or Pick-Your-Own marketing This strategy is not unique and has probably been around as long as farmers have grown more than they can sell at wholesale or consume on the farm. U-pick operations serve as an alternative selling method that, depending on the type of produce a farmer grows and the farm's customer base, it can supplement other marketing strategies. This strategy has several advantages: * Direct sales to the consumer lowers operating costs and brings a profit even if prices may be lower. * There are no transportation costs and no need for seasonal labor. * Lower packaging costs because customers are encouraged to bring their own bags, and berry cartons are included in the pricing. * Income is in hand when the consumer leaves the farm. * Since customers are allowed and often encouraged to eat while picking, an entry fee usually covers any produce customers may eat. Despite this, the produce at U-pick farms often cost lower since the cost of hiring farmers to harvest the produce is precluded. Disadvantages of You-Pick or Pick-Your-Own marketing As in any type of direct marketing system, potential customers must be identified. The means of doing this varies, from direct mailings to flyers or print advertising. The level of competition in the area can also dictate the types of crops and services producers provide. Owner-operators must identify the number of similar farmers in the area and the type of crops they produce and services offered, so as not to flood the market. One strategy to avoid this is by planting or harvesting crops at different times or extending the season in greenhouses or hoophouses to help prolong the harvest season and possibly increase the number of customers still looking for locally grown fresh produce. In addition, special services or products can be added to the business operation to gain market share. Some examples are baked and cooked foods, landscape services, plants, flowers, seeds, herbs, and homemade crafts.Booker T. Whatley's Handbook on How to Make $100,000 Farming 25 Acres. Emmaus, PA: Regenerative Agriculture Association, pp. 121-124; Megan L. Bruch and Matthew D. Ernst, A Farmer‚Äôs Guide to a Pick-Your-Own-Operation. Center for Profitable Agriculture. University of Tennessee, Tennessee Department of Agriculture, Extension Service. February, 2012. 28p. Other disadvantages of u-pick marketing are: * Insurance liability increases. * The producer has to accept the local price for their produce. * The producer's workday is extended with managing sales. * The work week is extended as the weekends require longer hours. * The producer may not be advantageously located to sell their products. * Once the local market demand is supplied, the producer has to look to regional markets or sell the produce in a different form: canned, cooked, smoked, or frozen, for example *  Pick-Your-Own in the United Kingdom  In the United Kingdom, customers are encouraged to pick their own, but not consume produce while picking. Sampling is generally allowed while out on the fields, but Pick-Your-Own (PYO) farms charge customers by the weight of produce they have picked. Some PYO farms charge a small refundable deposit on entry to discourage a minority of customers from eating produce without paying. Many farmers still pick for the market, while the public can enjoy themselves in the same fields. PYO was very popular in the 1970s and 1980s, when there was a season for fruit, but has declined in popularity now that the global market can provide the same fruit for most of the year. In the 2000s there has been a revival in local foods, and PYO has benefited from this. Pick-your-own strawberries were pioneered in the UK by Ted Moult in 1961.

She was born in Mirboo North, Victoria, to parents Richard Llewellyn (dec) and Jean Margaret Davies (dec). She attended Leongatha High School (1966-70) and Watsonia High School in 1971, when she completed her Higher School Certificate. She received a Bachelor of Arts and a Diploma of Education in 1976 from La Trobe University. She subsequently became a secondary school teacher, and began farming in addition to this in 1989. Davies joined the Labor Party in 1993, as part of the rural protest against Kennett government funding and service cuts, and was the Labor candidate for Gippsland West in the 1996 Victorian state election. Sitting Liberal MP Alan Brown resigned less than a year after the state election, precipitating a by-election. Labor declined to stand a candidate for this very safe Liberal seat; most of the area covered by Gippsland West had been in the hands of a conservative party for more than a century and a half. Davies resigned from the Labor Party and contested the by-election as an independent. The Liberal primary vote plunged by over 16 percent, allowing Davies to emerge victorious by 159 votes. She retained her seat in the 1999 state election, and held the balance of power with two other rural Independents when a significant, mostly rural, and very anti-Coalition swing led to a hung parliament. Davies played a key role in developing the \\"Independents' Charter\\", which the three independents used as a basis for backing a minority government under Steve Bracks and the Labor Party. She served on the Public Accounts and Estimates committee during the following parliamentary term. Prior to the 2002 election, Gippsland West was essentially replaced by the newly created seat of Bass, which was notionally Liberal in a traditional matchup. Davies contested Bass, but was pushed into third place on the primary vote behind former Liberal MLC Ken Smith. She later rejoined the Labor Party and contested the 2004 federal election as the Labor candidate for the federal seat of La Trobe. She was defeated by the Liberal candidate, Jason Wood. Davies now runs a small farm in South Gippsland, is part of a local food producers' network and Korumburra Landcare, and is a director on several organisations, including Chairing Energy Innovation Co- operative Ltd, which promotes renewable energy and energy efficiency measures as a response to climate change and peak oil.

Published in 1858 in the literary journal Slovenski glasnik, the popularity of the story led to it becoming a part of Slovene folklore and made its lead character a folk hero.  The story  A Slovene subject of the Habsburg Empire and one of the strongest men in it, Martin Krpan hails from a fictional village in Inner Carniola, Hilltop by the Holy Trinity ('). A smuggler by profession, he makes a living by illegally transporting English salt (gunpowder). With the help of his loyal, diminutive mare, they carry the gunpowder from the Adriatic Sea coast to the Slovene Lands and elsewhere in Inner Austria. On one of his travels, Krpan meets the imperial carriage on a snowbound road, and makes way for it by picking up his laden horse and moving it aside. His extraordinary strength is noted by the Emperor John ('). Several years later, the Emperor summons Krpan to Vienna in order to fight as the Empire's last hope against Brdaus (), a brutal warrior who has set up camp outside the imperial capital and challenged all comers, and has already slain most of the city's knights, including the Crown Prince. Reluctantly, Krpan accepts the challenge, scandalizing the court with his uncouthness, honesty and homespun manner, before defeating the brute in a duel by using both his strength and his ingenuity. In gratitude, the Emperor gives him a special permit to legally traffic in English salt and as well as a pouch of gold pieces, he also gave him permission to marry his daughter.Martin Krpan - In Slovenian Post's stamps Figural representations Martin Krpan carrying his horse. Book cover illustration by Tone Kralj, 1954. The story of Martin Krpan as rendered by Levstik in his epic poem was first illustrated in 1917 by Hinko Smrekar. Today, Smrekar's illustrations are mainly known from the images on tarot playing cards. In 1954, the expressionist painter Tone Kralj created a series of large full-page color illustrations of the story. His picture book, reprinted thirteen times, is now the most recognisable image of Martin Krpan. Krpan is often depicted carrying his mare, a reference to in an iconic scene from the story in which he moves his horse to make way for the imperial carriage.

He was born in Louisville, Kentucky, to Jewish immigrant parents from Bohemia (now in the Czech Republic), who raised him in a secular home. He attended Harvard Law School, graduating at the age of 20 with what is widely rumored to be the highest grade average in the law school's history. Brandeis settled in Boston, where he founded a law firm (that is still in practice today as Nutter McClennen & Fish) and became a recognized lawyer through his work on progressive social causes. Starting in 1890, he helped develop the \\"right to privacy\\" concept by writing a Harvard Law Review article of that title, and was thereby credited by legal scholar Roscoe Pound as having accomplished \\"nothing less than adding a chapter to our law\\". He later published a book entitled Other People's Money and How the Bankers Use It, suggesting ways of curbing the power of large banks and money trusts. He fought against powerful corporations, monopolies, public corruption, and mass consumerism, all of which he felt were detrimental to American values and culture. He also became active in the Zionist movement, seeing it as a solution to antisemitism in Europe and Russia, while at the same time being a way to \\"revive the Jewish spirit.\\" When his family's finances became secure, he began devoting most of his time to public causes and was later dubbed the \\"People's Lawyer\\". He insisted on serving on cases without pay so that he would be free to address the wider issues involved. The Economist magazine calls him \\"A Robin Hood of the law.\\" Among his notable early cases were actions fighting railroad monopolies, defending workplace and labor laws, helping create the Federal Reserve System, and presenting ideas for the new Federal Trade Commission. He achieved recognition by submitting a case brief, later called the \\"Brandeis Brief\\", which relied on expert testimony from people in other professions to support his case, thereby setting a new precedent in evidence presentation. In 1916, President Woodrow Wilson nominated Brandeis to become a member of the Supreme Court. His nomination was bitterly contested, partly because, as Justice William O. Douglas wrote, \\"Brandeis was a militant crusader for social justice whoever his opponent might be. He was dangerous not only because of his brilliance, his arithmetic, his courage. He was dangerous because he was incorruptible ... [and] the fears of the Establishment were greater because Brandeis was the first Jew to be named to the Court.\\" On June 1, 1916, he was confirmed by the Senate by a vote of 47 to 22, to become one of the most famous and influential figures ever to serve on the high court. His opinions were, according to legal scholars, some of the \\"greatest defenses\\" of freedom of speech and the right to privacy ever written by a member of the Supreme Court. Early life Family roots Louis David Brandeis (later: Louis Dembitz Brandeis ‚Äî see below) was born on November 13, 1856, in Louisville, Kentucky, the youngest of four children. His parents, Adolph Brandeis and Frederika Dembitz, both of whom were FrankistsArthur Mandel, Militant Messiah, Or, the Flight from the Ghetto: the Story of Jacob Frank and the Frankist Movement, Atlantic Highlands, NJ: Humanities Press, 1979, Chapter 22. Jews, immigrated to the United States from their childhood homes in Prague, Bohemia (then part of the Austrian Empire). They emigrated as part of their extended families for both economic and political reasons. The Revolutions of 1848 had produced a series of political upheavals and the families, though politically liberal and sympathetic to the rebels, were shocked by the antisemitic riots that erupted in Prague while the rebels controlled it.Klebanow, Diana, and Jonas, Franklin L. People's Lawyers: Crusaders for Justice in American History, M.E. Sharpe (2003) In addition, the Habsburg Empire had imposed business taxes on Jews. Family elders sent Adolph Brandeis to America to observe and prepare for his family's possible emigration. He spent a few months in the Midwest and was impressed by the nation's institutions and by the tolerance among the people he met. He wrote home to his wife, \\"America's progress is the triumph of the rights of man.\\" The Brandeis family chose to settle in Louisville partly because it was a prosperous river port. His earliest childhood was shaped by the American Civil War, which forced the family to seek safety temporarily in Indiana. The Brandeis family held abolitionist beliefs that angered their Louisville neighbors. Louis's father developed a grain-merchandising business. Worries about the U.S. economy took the family to Europe in 1872, but they returned in 1875.Vile, John R. Great American Judges: An Encyclopedia, ABC-CLIO (2003) Family life The Brandeises were considered a \\"cultured family\\", trying not to discuss business or money during dinner, preferring subjects related to history, politics, and culture, or their daily experiences. Having been raised partly on German culture, Louis read and appreciated the writings of Goethe and Schiller, and his favorite composers were Beethoven and Schumann. In their religious beliefs, although his family was Jewish, only his extended family practiced a more conservative form of Judaism, while his parents practiced the split-off movement of Frankism. They celebrated the main Christian holidays along with most of their community, treating Christmas as a secular holiday. His parents raised their children to be \\"high-minded idealists\\" rather than depending solely on religion for their purpose and inspiration. In later years, his mother, Frederika, wrote of this period: According to biographer Melvin Urofsky, Brandeis was influenced greatly by his uncle Lewis Naphtali Dembitz. Unlike other members of the extended Brandeis family, Dembitz regularly practiced Judaism and was actively involved in Zionist activities. Brandeis later changed his middle name from David to Dembitz in honor of his uncle, and through his uncle's model of social activism, became an active member of the Zionist movement later in his life.Urofsky, Melvin I. Louis D. Brandeis: A Life. New York: Pantheon (2009) Childhood education Louis grew up in \\"a family enamored with books, music, and politics, perhaps best typified by his revered uncle, Lewis Dembitz, a refined, educated man who served as a delegate to the Republican convention in 1860 that nominated Abraham Lincoln for president.\\" In school, Louis was a serious student in languages and other basic courses and usually achieved top scores. Brandeis graduated from the Louisville Male High School at age 14 with the highest honors. When he was 16, the Louisville University of the Public Schools awarded him a gold medal for \\"excellence in all his studies.\\"Strum, Philippa. Louis D. Brandeis: Justice for the People, Harvard University Press (1984) Anticipating an economic downturn, Adolph Brandeis relocated the family to Europe in 1872. After a period spent traveling, Louis spent two years studying at the in Dresden, Saxony, where he excelled. He later credited his capacity for critical thinking and his desire to study law in the United States to his time there. Law school Returning to the U.S. in 1875, Brandeis entered Harvard Law School at the age of 18. His admiration for the wide learning and debating skills of his uncle, Lewis Dembitz, inspired him to study law. Despite the fact that he entered the school without any financial help from his family, he became \\"an extraordinary student\\". During his time at Harvard, the teaching of law was undergoing a change of method from the traditional, memorization-reliant, \\"black-letter\\" case law, to a more flexible and interactive Socratic method, using prior cases as the basis for discussion to instruct students in legal reasoning. Brandeis easily adapted to the new methods, soon became active in class discussions, and joined the Pow-Wow club, similar to today's moot courts in law school, which gave him experience in the role of a judge. In a letter while at Harvard, he wrote of his \\"desperate longing for more law\\" and of the \\"almost ridiculous pleasure which the discovery or invention of a legal theory gives me.\\" He referred to the law as his \\"mistress,\\" holding a grip on him that he could not break.McCraw, Thomas K. Prophets of Regulation, Harvard University Press (1984) Unfortunately, his eyesight began failing as a result of the large volume of required reading and the poor visibility under gaslights. The school doctors suggested he give up school entirely. He found another alternative: paying fellow law students to read the textbooks aloud, while he tried to memorize the legal principles. Despite the difficulties, his academic work and memorization talents were so impressive that he graduated as valedictorian, was elected to Phi Beta Kappa,https://www.pbk.org/About-PBK/Justices and achieved the highest grade point average in the history of the school, a record that stood for eight decades. Brandeis said of that period: \\"Those years were among the happiest of my life. I worked! For me, the world's center was Cambridge.\\" Early career in law Photo of Louis Brandeis (around 1900) After graduation, he stayed on at Harvard for another year, where he continued to study law on his own while also earning a small income by tutoring other law students. In 1878, he was admitted to the Missouri barJefferson National Expansion Memorial and accepted a job with a law firm in St. Louis, where he filed his first brief and published his first law review article. After seven months, he tired of the minor casework and accepted an offer by his Harvard classmate, Samuel D. Warren, to set up a law firm in Boston. They were close friends at Harvard where Warren ranked second in the class to Brandeis's first. Warren was also the son of a wealthy Boston family and their new firm was able to benefit from his family's connections. Soon after returning to Boston, while waiting for the law firm to gain clients, he was appointed law clerk to Horace Gray, the chief justice of the Massachusetts Supreme Court, where he worked for two years. He was admitted to the Massachusetts bar without taking an examination, which he later wrote to his brother, was \\"contrary to all principle and precedent.\\" According to Klebanow and Jonas, \\"the speed with which he was admitted probably was due to his high standing with his former professors at Harvard Law, as well as to the influence of Chief Justice Gray.\\" First law firm: Warren and Brandeis The new firm was eventually successful, having gained new clients from within the state and in several neighboring states, as well. Their former professors referred a number of clients to the firm, garnering Brandeis more financial security and eventually the freedom to take an active role in progressive causes. As partner in his law firm, he worked as a consultant and advisor to businesses, but also as a litigator who enjoyed courtroom challenges. In a letter to his brother, he writes, \\"There is a certain joy in the exhaustion and backache of a long trial which shorter skirmishes cannot afford.\\" On November 6, 1889, he argued for the first time before the U.S. Supreme Court as the Eastern counsel of the Wisconsin Central Railroad and won. Soon after, Chief Justice Melville Fuller recommended him to a friend as the best attorney he knew of in the Eastern U.S.Lief, Alfred. Brandeis: The Personal History of an American Ideal, Stackpole Sons (1936) Before taking on business clients, he insisted they agree to two major conditions: that he would only deal with the person in charge, and never intermediaries; and he could be allowed to advise on any relevant aspects of the firm's affairs. He preferred being an adviser and counselor, rather than simply a strategist in lawsuits, which would allow him to advise his clients on how to avoid problems, such as lawsuits, strikes, or other crises. Brandeis explained: \\"I would rather have clients than be somebody's lawyer.\\" In a note found among his papers, he reminded himself to \\"advise client on what he should have, not what he wants.\\" Brandeis describes how he saw himself as an advisor: Brandeis was unusual among lawyers since he always turned away cases he considered bad. If he believed a client to be in the wrong, he would persuade his clients to make amends, otherwise he would withdraw from the case. Once, uncertain as to the rightness of his client's case, he wrote the client, \\"The position that I should take if I remained in the case would be to give everybody a square deal.\\" Brandeis and Warren's firm has been in continuous practice in Boston since its founding in 1879; the firm is known as Nutter McClennen & Fish. Privacy law Brandeis defined modern notions of the individual right to privacy in a path-breaking article he published with his partner, Warren, in the Harvard Law Review of December 15, 1890, on \\"The Right to Privacy.\\" Stimulated by anger at offensive publicity concerning the social activities of Warren's family, it suggested a new legal concept that has had lasting influence. Building on diverse analogies in the law of defamation, of literary property, and of eavesdropping, Brandeis argued that the central, if unarticulated, interest protected in these fields was an interest in personal integrity, \\"the right to be let alone,\\" that ought to be secured against invasion except for some compelling reason of public welfare. Brandeis saw emotions as a positive expression of human nature, and so desired privacy protection for them as protection against repression of the human spirit.Grant B. Mindle, \\"Liberalism, Privacy, and Autonomy,\\" Journal of Politics (1989) 51#3 pp. 575‚Äì598 in JSTOR Between 1888 and 1890, Brandeis and his law partner, Samuel Warren, wrote three scholarly articles published in the Harvard Law Review. The third, \\"The Right to Privacy,\\" was the most important, with legal scholar Roscoe Pound saying it accomplished \\"nothing less than adding a chapter to our law.\\"Solove, Daniel J., Rotenberg, Marc, and Schwartz, Paul M., Privacy, Information, and Technology (Aspen Publishers, 2006), 9 Brandeis and Warren discussed \\"snapshot photography,\\" a recent innovation in journalism, that allowed newspapers to publish photographs and statements of individuals without obtaining their consent. They argued that private individuals were being continually injured and that the practice weakened the \\"moral standards of society as a whole.\\"Warren and Brandeis, The Right To Privacy, 4 Harvard Law Review 193 (1890) They wrote: Legal historian Wayne McIntosh wrote that \\"the privacy tort of Brandeis and Warren set the nation on a legal trajectory of such profound magnitude that it finally transcended its humble beginnings.\\"McIntosh, Wayne V., Judicial Entrepreneurship: the Role of the Judge in the Marketplace of Ideas, Greenwood Publishing (1997) State courts and legislatures quickly drew on Brandeis and Warren's work. In 1905 the Georgia Supreme Court recognized a right to privacy in a case involving photographs. By 1909, California, New York, Pennsylvania, Virginia, and Utah had passed statutes establishing the right. In 1939 the American Law Institute's Restatement of Torts also recognized a right to privacy at common law. Years later, after becoming a justice of the Supreme Court, Brandeis discussed the right to privacy in his famous dissenting opinion in Olmstead v. United States. Personal life and marriage Brandeis in his canoe, circa 1916 In 1890, Brandeis became engaged to his second cousin Alice Goldmark, of New York. He was then 34 years of age and had previously found little time for courtship. Alice was the daughter of Joseph Goldmark, a physician who had immigrated to America from Austria-Hungary after the collapse of the Revolution of 1848. They were married on March 23, 1891, at the home of her parents in New York City in a civil ceremony. The newlywed couple moved into a modest home in Boston's Beacon Hill district and had two daughters, Susan Brandeis Gilbert, born in 1893, and Elizabeth Brandeis Rauschenbush, born in 1896. Alice supported her husband's resolve to devote most of his time to public causes. The Brandeis family \\"lived well but without extravagance.\\" With the continuing success of his law practice, they later purchased a vacation house in Dedham, where they would spend many of their weekends and summer vacations. Unexpectedly, his wife's health soon became frail, and so in addition to his professional duties, he found it necessary to manage the family's domestic affairs. Progressivism Using his social conscience, Brandeis became a leader of the Progressive movement, and he used the law as the instrument for social change. From 1897 to 1916, he was in the thick of multiple reform crusades. He fought in Boston to secure honest traction franchises and, in 1907, launched a six-year fight to prevent the banker J. P. Morgan from monopolizing New England's railroads. After an expos√© of insurance fraud in 1906, he devised the Massachusetts plan to protect small wage-earners through savings bank life insurance. He supported the conservation movement and, in 1910, emerged as the chief figure in the Pinchot‚ÄìBallinger investigation:Melvin I. Urofsky, Louis D. Brandeis and the Progressive Tradition (1981) Public advocate In 1889, Brandeis entered a new phase in his legal career when his partner, Samuel Warren, withdrew from their partnership to take over his recently-deceased father's paper company. Brandeis then took on cases with the help of colleagues, two of whom became partners in 1897 in his new firm: Brandeis, Dunbar, and Nutter. He won his first important victory in 1891, when he persuaded the Massachusetts legislature to make the liquor laws less restrictive and thereby more reasonable and enforceable. He suggested a viable \\"middle course;\\" by moderating the existing regulations, he told the lawmakers that they would remove liquor dealers' incentive to violate or to corrupt the laws. The legislature was won over by his arguments and changed the regulations. Brandeis wrote that \\"the law has everywhere a tendency to lag behind the facts of life.\\" He chipped away at assumptions that legal principles should never be changed. He worked to break the traditional hold on legal thinking to make laws that met the needs of the changing community.Piott, Steven L. American Reformers, 1870‚Äì1920, Rowman & Littlefield (2006) Louis Brandeis, 1915 Part of his reasoning and philosophy for acting as a public advocate was later explained in his 1911 book, The Opportunity in the Law: In one of his first such cases, in 1894, he represented Alice N. Lincoln, a Boston philanthropist and noted crusader for the poor. He appeared at public hearings to promote investigations into conditions in the public poorhouses. Lincoln, who had visited the poorhouses for years, saw inmates dwelling in misery and the temporarily unemployed thrown in together with the mentally ill as well as hardened criminals. Brandeis spent nine months and held fifty-seven public hearings, at one such hearing proclaiming, \\"Men are not bad. Men are degraded largely by circumstances.... It is the duty of every man... to help them up and let them feel that there is some hope for them in life.\\" As a result of the hearings, the board of aldermen decreed that the administration of the poor law would be completely reorganized. In 1896, he was asked to lead the fight against a Boston transit company, which was trying to gain concessions from the state legislature that would have given it control over the city's emerging subway system. Brandeis prevailed, and the legislature enacted his bill. The transit franchise struggle revealed that many of Boston's politicians had placed political friends on the payrolls of the private transit companies. One alderman gave jobs to 200 of his followers. In Boston and other cities, such abuses were part of the corruption in which graft and bribery were common, and in some cases, even newly-freed prison felons resumed their political careers. \\"Always the moralist,\\" writes biographer Thomas Mason, \\"Brandeis declared that 'misgovernment in Boston had reached the danger point. He declared that from then on he would keep a record of good and bad political deeds, which would be open to all Boston voters. In one of his public addresses in 1903, he stated his goal: In 1906, Brandeis won a modest victory when the state legislature enacted a measure he drafted designed to make it a punishable crime for a public official to solicit a job from a regulated public utility or for an officer of such a company to offer such favors. His anti-corruption philosophy was included in his closing argument for the Glavis-Ballinger case of 1910 in which he stated that the public servant \\"cannot be worthy of the respect and admiration of the people unless they add to the virtue of obedience some other virtues‚Äîthe virtues of manliness, of truth, of courage, of willingness to risk positions, of the willingness to risk criticism, of the willingness to risk the misunderstanding that so often comes when people do the heroic thing.\\"Bruce, Will M. Classics of Administrative Ethics, Westview Press (2001) Against monopolies In the 1890s, Brandeis began to question his views on American industrialism, write Klebanow and Jonas. He became aware of the growing number of giant companies which were capable of dominating whole industries. He began to lose faith that the economic system was able to regulate them for the public's welfare. As a result, he denounced \\"cut-throat competition\\" and worried about monopolies. He also became concerned about the plight of workers and was more sympathetic to the labor movement. His earlier legal battles had convinced him that concentrated economic power could have a negative effect on a free society. Against big corporations Brandeis was becoming increasingly conscious of and hostile to powerful corporations and the trend toward bigness in American industry and finance. He argued that great size conflicted with efficiency and added a new dimension to the Efficiency Movement of the Progressive Era. As early as 1895, he had pointed out the harm that giant corporations could do to competitors, customers, and their own workers. The growth of industrialization was creating mammoth companies, which he felt threatened the well-being of millions of Americans. Although the Sherman Antitrust Act was enacted in 1890, it was not until the 20th century that there was any major effort to apply it. By 1910, Brandeis noticed that even America's leaders, including President Theodore Roosevelt, were beginning to question the value of antitrust policies. Some business experts felt that nothing could prevent the concentration of industry and so big business was here to stay. As a result, leaders like Roosevelt began to \\"regulate\\" but not to limit the growth and operation of corporate monopolies, but Brandeis wanted the trend to bigness slowed or even reversed. He was convinced that monopolies and trusts were \\"neither inevitable nor desirable.\\" In support of Brandeis's position were the presidential candidate William Jennings Bryan and Wisconsin Senator Robert M. La Follette Sr. Brandeis also denied that large trusts were more efficient than the smaller firms driven out of business. He argued the opposite was often true: that monopolistic enterprises became \\"less innovative\\" because, he wrote, their \\"secure positions freed them from the necessity which has always been the mother of invention.\\" He explained that an executive could not ever learn all the details of running a huge and unwieldy company. \\"There is a limit to what one man can do well,\\" he wrote. Brandeis was aware of the economies of scale and the initially-lower prices offered by growing companies, but he noted that once a large company drove out its competition, \\"the quality of its products tended to decline while the prices charged for them tended to go up.\\" Those companies would become \\"clumsy dinosaurs, which, if they ever had to face real competition, would collapse of their own weight.\\" He said in an address to the Economic Club of New York in 1912: Against mass consumerism Among Brandeis's key themes was the conflict he saw between 19th-century values, with its culture of the small producer, and an emerging 20th-century age of big business and consumerist mass society. Brandeis was hostile to the new consumerism. Though himself a millionaire, Brandeis disliked wealthy persons who engaged in conspicuous consumption or were ostentatious. He did little shopping himself, and unlike his wealthy friends who owned yachts, he was satisfied with his canoe. He hated advertising which he said \\"manipulated\\" average buyers. He realized that newspapers and magazines were dependent on advertising for their revenues, which caused them to be \\"less free\\" than they should be. He said that national advertisers also undermined the traditional relationship between consumers and local businesses. He urged journalists to \\"teach the public to look with suspicion upon every advertised article\\" so that they would not suffer from marketing manipulation by giant corporations. Becoming \\"the people's lawyer\\" Brandeis (center) in his Boston office, 1916 Brandeis was being called \\"the people's lawyer.\\" He no longer accepted payment for \\"public interest\\" cases even when they required pleadings before judges, legislative committees, or administrative agencies. He began to give his opinion by writing magazine articles, making speeches, and helping form interest groups. He insisted on serving without pay so that he could freely address the wider issues involved beyond the case at hand. In an address to Harvard law students, he suggested that they should try to serve the people: Developing new life insurance system In March 1905, he became counsel to a New England policyholder's committee, which was concerned that its scandal-ridden insurance company would file bankruptcy and that the policyholders would lose their investments and insurance protection. He served without pay to be free to address the wider issues involved. He spent the next year in studying the workings of the life insurance industry, often writing articles and giving speeches about his findings, at one point describing its practices as \\"legalized robbery.\\" By 1906, he had concluded that life insurance was a \\"bad bargain for the vast majority of policyholders,\\" mostly because of the inefficiency of the industry. He also learned that a little-understood clause in the policies of low-wage workers allowed the policy to be canceled when they missed a payment and that most policies lapsed; only one out of eight policyholders received benefits, which led to large profits for insurance companies. Brandeis then created a \\"groundswell\\" in Massachusetts with his campaign to educate the public. His efforts, with the help of progressive businessmen, social reformers, and trade unionists, led to the creation of a new \\"savings bank life insurance\\" system. By March 1907, the Savings Bank Insurance League had 70,000 members, and Brandeis's face and name now appeared regularly in newspapers. He next persuaded the former governor, a Republican, to become its president, and the current governor stated in his annual message his wish for the legislature to study plans for \\"cheaper insurance that may rob death of half of its terrors for the worthy poor.\\" Brandeis drafted his own bill, and three months later, the \\"savings bank insurance measure was signed into law.\\" He called that bill one of \\"his greatest achievements\\" and kept a watchful eye on it. Preventing J. P. Morgan's railroad monopoly While still involved with the life insurance industry, he took on another public interest case: the struggle to prevent New England's largest railroad company, New Haven Railroad, from gaining control of its chief competitor, the Boston and Maine Railroad.For a detailed history of the struggle from Brandeis's point of view, see Staples, Henry Lee and Mason, Alpheus Thomas, \\"The Fall of a Railroad Empire: Brandeis and the New Haven Merger Battle\\" (Syracuse University Press, 1947). Justice Brandeis and his staff co-operated with the authors. His foes were the most powerful he had ever encountered, including the region's most affluent families, Boston's legal establishment, and the large State Street bankers. The New Haven had been under the control of J. P. Morgan, the \\"most powerful of all American bankers and probably the most dominating figure in all of American business.\\" J. P. Morgan had pursued an expansion policy by acquiring many of the line's competitors to make the New Haven into a single unified network. Its acquisitions included railways, trolleys, and shipping companies.Weller, John L., The New Haven Railroad: its Rise and Fall, Hastings House (1969) In June 1907, Brandeis was asked by Boston and Maine stockholders to present their cause to the public, a case that he again took on by insisting on serving without payment, \\"leaving him free to act as he thought best.\\" After months of extensive research, Brandeis published a 70-page booklet in which he argued that New Haven's acquisitions were putting its financial condition in jeopardy, and he predicted that within a few years, it would be forced to cut its dividends or to become insolvent. He spoke publicly to Boston's citizens warning them that the New Haven \\"sought to monopolize the transportation of New England.\\" He soon found himself under attack by not only the New Haven but also by many newspapers, magazines, chambers of commerce, Boston bankers, and college professors. \\"I have made,\\" he wrote to his brother, \\"more enemies than in all my previous fights together.\\" However, in 1908, the New Haven's proposed merger was dealt \\"several stunning blows.\\" Among them, the Massachusetts Supreme Court ruled that New Haven had acted illegally during earlier acquisitions. Brandeis met twice with US President Theodore Roosevelt, who convinced the US Department of Justice to file suit against New Haven for antitrust violations. At a subsequent hearing in front of the Interstate Commerce Commission in Boston, New Haven's president \\"admitted that the railroad had maintained a floating slush fund that was used to make 'donations' to politicians who cooperated.\\" Within a few years, New Haven's finances were undone, just as Brandeis had predicted. By the spring of 1913, the Department of Justice launched a new investigation, and the next year, the Interstate Commerce Commission charged the New Haven with \\"extravagance and political corruption and its board of directors with dereliction of duty.\\" As a result, the New Haven gave up its struggle for expansion by disposing of its Boston and Maine stock and selling off its recent acquisitions of competitors. As Mason describes it, \\"after a nine-year battle against a powerful corporation... and in the face of a long, bitter campaign of personal abuse and vilification, Brandeis and his cause again prevailed.\\" A newspaper in 1914 describes Brandeis as someone \\"whose prophecies of disaster to the New Haven Railroad have been fully justified.\\" In 1934, Brandeis had another legal confrontation with Morgan, this one relating to securities regulation bills. J. P. Morgan's resident economist, Russell Leffingwell, felt it necessary to remind their banker, Tom Lamont, about the person with whom they would be dealing: Banking historian Ron Chernow wrote, \\"For the House of Morgan, Louis Brandeis was more than just a critic, he was an adversary of almost mythical proportion.\\"Chernow, Ron. The House of Morgan: An American Banking Dynasty and the Rise of Modern Finance, Grove Press (2001) Upholding workplace laws with \\"Brandeis Brief\\" In 1908, he chose to represent the state of Oregon in the case of Muller v. Oregon to the US Supreme Court. At issue was whether it was constitutional for a state law to limit the hours worked by female workers. Until then, it had been considered an \\"unreasonable infringement of freedom of contract\\" between employers and their employees for a state to set any wages or hours legislation. Brandeis, however, discovered that earlier Supreme Court cases limited the rights of contract when the contract had \\"a real or substantial relation to public health or welfare.\\" He, therefore, decided that the best way to present the case would be to demonstrate through an abundance of workplace facts, \\"a clear connection between the health and morals of female workers\\" and the hours that they were required to work. To accomplish that, he filed what has become known today as the \\"Brandeis Brief.\\" It was much shorter than traditional briefs but included more than a hundred pages of documentation, including social worker reports, medical conclusions, factory inspector observations, and other expert testimonials, which together showed a preponderance of evidence displaying that \\"when women worked long hours, it was destructive to their health and morals.\\" The strategy worked, and the Oregon law was upheld. Justice David Brewer directly credited Brandeis with demonstrating \\"a widespread belief that woman's physical structure and the functions that she performs ... justify special legislation.\\" Thomas Mason wrote that with the Supreme Court affirming Oregon's minimum wage law, Brandeis \\"became the leading defender in the courts of protective labor legislation.\\" Brandeis, Louis. The Brandeis Brief, Muller v. Oregon (208 US 412) As Justice Douglas wrote years later, \\"Brandeis usually sided with the workers; he put their cause in noble words and the merits of their claims with shattering clarity.\\" Brandeis Brief Widely known as \\"the people's attorney,\\" Brandeis pioneered pro bono work and was a true reformer. Brandeis was also the first to cite law reviews both in his briefs before the court and in his opinions as a justice. In 1907, he pioneered a new type of legal document, the \\"Brandeis Brief.\\" It included three pages of traditional legal citations and over 100 innovative pages of citations to articles, government reports, and other references. It was packed full of social research and data to demonstrate the public interest in a ten-hour limitation on women's working hours. His brief proved decisive in Muller v. Oregon, the first Supreme Court ruling to accept the legitimacy of a scientific examination of the social conditions, in addition to the legal facts involved in a case. One of the hallmarks of the case was Brandeis's minimizing of common-law jurisprudence, in favor of extralegal information relevant to the case. According to the judicial historian Stephen Powers, the \\"so-called 'Brandeis Brief' became a model for progressive litigation\\" by taking into consideration social and historical realities, rather than just the abstract general principles. He adds that it had \\"a profound impact on the future of the legal profession\\" by accepting more broad-based legal information.Powers, Stephen, and Rothman, Stanley. The Least Dangerous Branch?: Consequences of Judicial Activism, Smith College, Greenwood Publishing Group (2002) John Vile added that this new \\"Brandeis Brief\\" was increasingly used, most notably in the Brown v. Board of Education case in 1954 that desegregated public schools. Supporting President Wilson President Woodrow Wilson, 1919 Brandeis's positions on regulating large corporations and monopolies carried over into the presidential campaign of 1912. Democratic candidate Woodrow Wilson made it a central issue, part of the larger debate over the future of the economic system and the role of the national government. While the Progressive Party candidate, Theodore Roosevelt felt that trusts were inevitable and should be regulated, Wilson and his party aimed to \\"destroy the trusts\\" by ending special privileges, such as protective tariffs and unfair business practices that made them possible.Link, Arthur S. Woodrow Wilson and the Progressive Era, 1910‚Äì1917, Harper and Row (1954) Although originally a La Follette Republican, Brandeis switched to the Democrats and urged his friends and associates to join him. The two men met for the first time at a private conference in New Jersey that August and spent three hours discussing economic issues. Brandeis left the meeting a \\"confirmed admirer\\" of Wilson, who he said was likely to make 'an \\"ideal president.\\" Wilson thereafter began using the term \\"regulated competition,\\" the concept that Brandeis had developed, and made it the essence of his program. In September, Wilson asked Brandeis to set forth explicitly how competition can be effectively regulated. Brandeis did so, and after Wilson's victory that November, he told Brandeis, \\"You were yourself a great part of the victory.\\" Wilson considered nominating Brandeis first for Attorney General and later for Secretary of Commerce, but backed down after a loud outcry from corporate executives that Brandeis had earlier opposed in court battles. Wilson concluded that Brandeis was too controversial a figure to appoint to his cabinet. Nevertheless, during Wilson's first year as president, Brandeis was instrumental in shaping the new Federal Reserve Act. His arguments had been decisive in breaking deadlock on banking issues. Wilson endorsed Brandeis's proposals and those of Secretary of State William Jennings Bryan, both of whom felt that the banking system needed to be democratized and its currency issued and controlled by the government. They convinced Congress to enact the Federal Reserve Act in December 1913.Link, Albert S. Wilson: the New Freedom, Princeton University Press (1953) In 1913, Brandeis wrote a series of articles for Harper's Weekly that suggested ways of curbing the power of large banks and money trusts. And in 1914 he published a book entitled Other People's Money and How the Bankers Use It.Brandeis, Louis. Other People's Money ‚Äì and How the Bankers Use It, (1914) complete text from Louis D. Brandeis School of Law He also urged the Wilson administration to develop proposals for new antitrust legislation to give the Department of Justice the power to enforce antitrust laws, with Brandeis becoming one of the architects of the Federal Trade Commission. Brandeis also served as Wilson's chief economic adviser from 1912 until 1916. \\"Above all else,\\" writes McCraw, \\"Brandeis exemplified the anti-bigness ethic without which there would have been no Sherman Act, no antitrust movement, and no Federal Trade Commission.\\" Nominated to the Supreme Court On January 28, 1916, Wilson surprised the nation by nominating Brandeis to become a member of the U.S. Supreme Court.New York Times: Brandeis Named for Highest Court,\\" January 29, 1916. Retrieved February 21, 2010. His nomination was bitterly contested and denounced by conservative Republicans, including former President William Howard Taft, whose credibility was damaged by Brandeis in early court battles in which he called Taft a \\"muckraker\\". Further opposition came from members of the legal profession, including former Attorney General George W. Wickersham and former presidents of the American Bar Association, such as former Senator and Secretary of State Elihu Root of New York, who claimed Brandeis was \\"unfit\\" to serve on the Supreme Court. The controversy surrounding Brandeis's nomination was so great that the Senate Judiciary Committee, for the first time in its history, held a public hearing on the nomination, allowing witnesses to appear before the committee and offer testimony both in support of and in opposition to Brandeis's confirmation. While previous nominees to the Supreme Court had been confirmed or rejected by a simple up-or-down vote on the Senate floor, often on the same day on which the President had sent the nomination to the Senate, a then-unprecedented four months lapsed between Wilson's nomination of Brandeis and the Senate's final confirmation vote.\\"National Public Radio: A History of Supreme Court Confirmation Hearings\\" What Brandeis's opponents most objected to was his \\"radicalism.\\" The Wall Street Journal wrote of Brandeis, \\"In all the anti-corporation agitation of the past, one name stands out... where others were radical, he was rabid.\\" And the New York Times claimed that having been a noted \\"reformer\\" for so many years, he would lack the \\"dispassionate temperament that is required of a judge.\\"Todd, Alden L. Justice on Trial: The Case of Louis D. Brandeis, McGraw-Hill (1964) Brandeis' successor, William O. Douglas, many years later, wrote that the nomination of Brandeis \\"frightened the Establishment\\" because he was \\"a militant crusader for social justice.\\" According to the legal historian Scott Powe, much of the opposition to Brandeis's appointment also stemmed from \\"blatant anti- semitism.\\" Taft would accuse Brandeis of using his Judaism to curry political favor, and Wickersham would refer to Brandeis's supporters and Taft's critics as \\"a bunch of Hebrew uplifters.\\"Afran, Bruce, & Garber, Robert A. (2005). Jews on Trial. pp. 157‚Äì158. Senator Henry Cabot Lodge privately complained, \\"If it were not that Brandeis is a Jew, and a German Jew, he would never have been appointed[.]\\"Afran, Bruce, & Garber, Robert A. (2005). Jews on Trial. p. 154. Those in favor of seeing him join the court were just as numerous and influential. Supporters included attorneys, social workers, and reformers with whom he had worked on cases, and they testified eagerly in his behalf. Harvard law professor Roscoe Pound told the committee that \\"Brandeis was one of the great lawyers\\" and predicted that he would one day rank \\"with the best who have sat upon the bench of the Supreme Court.\\" Other lawyers who supported him pointed out to the committee that he \\"had angered some of his clients by his conscientious striving to be fair to both sides in a case.\\" In May, when the Senate Judiciary Committee asked the Attorney General to provide the letters of endorsement that traditionally accompanied a Supreme Court nomination, Attorney General Thomas Watt Gregory found that there were none. Wilson had made the nomination on the basis of personal knowledge. In reply to the Committee, Wilson wrote a letter to the Chairman, Senator Charles Culberson, testifying to his own personal estimation of the nominee's character and abilities. He called his nominee's advice \\"singularly enlightening, singularly clear-sighted and judicial, and, above all, full of moral stimulation.\\" He added: A month later, on June 1, 1916, the Senate officially confirmed his nomination by a vote of 47 to 22. Forty-four Democratic Senators and three Republicans (Robert La Follette, George Norris, and Miles Poindexter) voted in favor of confirming Brandeis. Twenty-one Republican senators and one Democrat (Francis G. Newlands) voted against his confirmation.\\"Confirm Brandeis by Vote of 47 to 22,\\" The New York Times, June 2, 1916, accessed December 31, 2009 Once on the Court, Brandeis kept active politically but worked behind the scenes, as was then acceptable. He was an advisor to Franklin Roosevelt's New Deal through intermediaries. Many of his disciples held influential jobs, especially in the Justice Department. Brandeis and Felix Frankfurter (who served together very briefly on the Court) often collaborated on political issues.Bruce Allen Murphy, The Brandeis/Frankfurter Connection: The Secret Activities of Two Supreme Court Justices (Oxford University Press, 1982) p. 343The famed jurist Learned Hand \\"thought it appropriate for a federal judge to offer private advice, as he so frequently did with Theodore Roosevelt, so long as there was no prominent public identification with the cause.\\" See In October 1918, he helped Thomas Garrigue Masaryk to create \\"Washington Declaration\\" for the founding of a new independent Czechoslovakia.PRECL√çK, Vratislav.

Minnesota (1920) ‚Äì Freedom of speech There was a strong conservative streak in the U.S. beginning with World War I and into the 1920s, and this conservatism was reflected in decisions of the Supreme Court. Both Brandeis and Justice Oliver Wendell Holmes Jr. often dissented and became known for consistently challenging the majority's view. (However, both men approved the restrictive Schenck v. United States decision in 1919 and the pro-sterilization Buck v. Bell decision in 1927). These dissents were most noteworthy in cases dealing with the free speech rights of defendants who had expressed opposition to the military draft. Justice Holmes developed the concept of \\"clear and present danger\\" as the test any restriction on speech had to meet. Both Holmes and Brandeis used this doctrine in other cases. Vile points out that Brandeis was \\"spurred by his appreciation for democracy, education, and the value of free speech and continued to argue vigorously for ... free speech even in wartime because of its educational value and the importance to democracy.\\" And according to legal historian John Raeburn Green, Brandeis's philosophy influenced Justice Holmes himself, and writes that \\"Justice Holmes's conversion to a profound attachment to freedom of expression ... may be taken to have occurred in 1919, and to have coincided roughly with the advent of Mr. Justice Brandeis's influence.\\"Green, John Raeburn. The Supreme Court, the Bill of Rights, and the States, 97 Univ. of Pennsylvania Law Review, 608, 630 (1949) One such case was Gilbert v. Minnesota (1920) which dealt with a state law prohibiting interference with the military's enlistment efforts. In his dissenting opinion, Brandeis wrote that the statute affected the \\"rights, privileges, and immunities of one who is a citizen of the United States; and it deprives him of an important part of his liberty. ... [T]he statute invades the privacy and freedom of the home. Father and mother may not follow the promptings of religious belief, of conscience or of conviction, and teach son or daughter the doctrine of pacifism. If they do, any police officer may summarily arrest them.\\"Gilbert v. Minnesota, Decided December 13, 1920, full text Legal author Ken Gormley says Brandeis was \\"attempting to introduce a notion of privacy which was connected in some fashion to the Constitution ... and which worked in tandem with the First Amendment to assure a freedom of speech within the four brick walls of the citizen's residence.\\"Gormley, Ken, and Richardson, Elliot Archibald Cox: Conscience of a Nation, Da Capo Press, (1999) In 1969, in Stanley v. Georgia, Justice Marshall succeeded in linking the right of privacy with freedom of speech and making it part of the constitutional structure, quoting from Brandeis's Olmstead dissent and his Whitney concurrence, and adding his own conclusions from the case at hand, which dealt with the issue of viewing pornography at home: Whitney v. California (1927) ‚Äì Freedom of speech The case of Whitney v. California is notable partly because of the concurring opinion of both Justices Brandeis and Holmes. The case dealt with the prosecution of a woman for aiding the Communist Labor Party, an organization that was promoting the violent overthrow of the government. In their opinion and test to uphold the conviction, they expanded the definition of \\"clear and present danger\\" to include the condition that the \\"evil apprehended is so imminent that it may befall before there is opportunity for full discussion.\\" According to legal historian Anthony Lewis, scholars have lauded Brandeis's opinion \\"as perhaps the greatest defense of freedom of speech ever written by a member of the high court.\\"Lewis, Anthony. Make No Law: The Sullivan case and the First Amendment, Random House, (1991) In their concurring opinion, they wrote: Olmstead v. United States (1928) ‚Äì Right of privacy In his widely cited dissenting opinion in Olmstead v. United States (1928), Brandeis relied on thoughts he developed in his 1890 Harvard Law Review article \\"The Right to Privacy.\\" But in his dissent, he now changed the focus whereby he urged making personal privacy matters more relevant to constitutional law, going so far as saying \\"the government [was] identified ... as a potential privacy invader.\\" At issue in Olmstead was the use of wiretap technology to gather evidence. Referring to this \\"dirty business,\\" he then tried to combine the notions of civil privacy and the \\"right to be let alone\\" with the right offered by the Fourth Amendment which disallowed unreasonable search and seizure. Brandeis wrote in his lengthy dissent: In succeeding years his right of privacy concepts gained powerful disciples who relied on his dissenting opinion: Justice Frank Murphy, in 1942, used his Harvard Law Review article in writing an opinion for the Court; a few years later, Justice Felix Frankfurter referred to the Fourth Amendment as the \\"protection of the right to be let alone,\\" as in the 1947 case of United States v. Harris, where his opinion wove together the speeches of James Otis, James Madison, John Adams, and Brandeis's Olmstead opinion, proclaiming the right of privacy as \\"second to none in the Bill of Rights Again, five years later, Justice William O. Douglas openly declared that he had been wrong about his earlier tolerance of wiretapping and wrote, \\"I now more fully appreciate the vice of the practices spawned by Olmstead ... I now feel that I was wrong ... Mr. Justice Brandeis in his dissent in Olmstead espoused the cause of privacy ‚Äì the right to be let alone. What he wrote is an historic statement of that point of view. I cannot improve on it.\\"Finkelman, Paul. Encyclopedia of American Civil Liberties, CRC Press, (2006) And in 1963, Justice William J. Brennan, Jr. joined with these earlier opinions taking the position that \\"the Brandeis point of view\\" was well within the longstanding tradition of American law. It took the growth of surveillance technology during the 1950s and 1960s and the \\"full force of the Warren Court's due process revolution,\\" writes McIntosh, to finally overturn the Olmstead law: in 1967, Justice Potter Stewart wrote the opinion overturning Olmstead in Katz v. U.S. McIntosh adds, \\"A quarter-century after his death, another component of Justice Brandeis's privacy design was enshrined in American law.\\" As Wayne McIntosh notes, \\"the spirit, if not the person, of Louis Brandeis, has continued to stimulate the constitutional mutation of a 'right to privacy.'\\" These influences have manifested themselves in major decisions relating to everything from abortion rights to the \\"right to die\\" controversies. Cases dealing with a state ban on the dissemination of birth control information expanded on Brandeis by including an individual's \\"body,\\" not just her \\"personality,\\" as part of her right to privacy. In another case, Justice Harlan credited Brandeis when he wrote, \\"The entire fabric of the Constitution ... guarantees that the rights to marital privacy and to marry and raise a family are of similar order and magnitude as the fundamental rights specifically protected.\\"Griswold v. Connecticut, 381 U.S. 479 (1965) And the landmark case of Roe v. Wade, one of the most controversial and politically significant cases in U.S. Supreme Court history, the Court wrote, \\"This right of privacy ... is broad enough to encompass a woman's decision whether or not to terminate her pregnancy.\\"Roe v. Wade, 410 U.S. 113 (1973) Packer Corporation v. Utah (1932) ‚Äì Captive audience and free speech In Packer Corporation v. Utah (1932), Brandeis was to advance an exception to the right of free speech. In this case, a unanimous Court, led by Brandeis, found a clear distinction between advertising placed in newspapers and magazines with those placed on public billboards. The case was a notable exception and dealt with a conflict between widespread First Amendment rights with the public's right of privacy and advanced a theory of the \\"captive audience.\\" Brandeis delivered the opinion of the Court to advance privacy interests: Burnet v. Coronado Oil & Gas Co. (1932) ‚Äì Stare decisis Brandeis forever changed the way Americans think about stare decisis, one of the most distinctive principles of the common law legal system. In his widely-cited dissenting opinion in Burnet v. Coronado Oil & Gas Co. (1932), Brandeis \\"catalogued the Court‚Äôs actual overruling practices in such a powerful manner that his attendant stare decisis analysis immediately assumed canonical authority.\\" Available via SpringerLink. Brandeis wrote: The rule of stare decisis descended from Brandeis's formulation would later split into strong and weak forms as a result of the disagreement between Chief Justice William Rehnquist and Associate Justice Thurgood Marshall in Payne v. Tennessee (1991). Available via SpringerLink. New Deal cases Along with Benjamin Cardozo and Harlan F. Stone, Brandeis was considered to be in the liberal wing of the court‚Äîthe so-called Three Musketeers who stood against the conservative Four Horsemen. Louisville v. Radford (1935) ‚Äì limiting presidential discretion According to John Vile, in the final years of his career, like the rest of the Court, he \\"initially combated the New Deal of Franklin D. Roosevelt, which went against everything Brandeis had ever preached in opposition to the concepts of 'bigness' and 'centralization' in the federal government and the need to return to the states.\\" In one case, Louisville v. Radford (1935), he spoke for a unanimous court when he declared the Frazier- Lemke Act unconstitutional. The act prevented mortgage-holding banks from foreclosing on their property for five years and forced struggling farmers to continue paying based on a court-ordered schedule. \\"The Fifth Amendment,\\" he declared, \\"commands that however great the Nation's need, private property shall not be thus taken over without just compensation.\\" Schechter Poultry Corp. v. United States (1935) ‚Äì NIRA is unconstitutional In Schechter Poultry Corp. v. United States (1935), the Court also voted unanimously to declare the National Industrial Recovery Act (NIRA) unconstitutional on the grounds that it gave the president \\"unfettered discretion\\" to make whatever laws he thought were needed for economic recovery. Economics author John Steele Gordon writes that the National Recovery Administration (NRA) was \\"the first iteration of Roosevelt's New Deal ... essentially a government-run cartel to fix prices and divide markets ... This was the most radical shift in the relation between government and the private economy in American history.\\" Gordon, John Steele. \\"The Economic Contradictions of Obama-ism\\", Commentary magazine, April 2009, pgs. 23‚Äì26 Speaking to aides of Roosevelt, Justice Louis Brandeis remarked that, \\"This is the end of this business of centralization, and I want you to go back and tell the president that we're not going to let this government centralize everything.\\"Harry Hopkins, \\"Statement to Me by Thomas Corcoran Giving His Recollections of the Genesis of the Supreme Court Fight,\\" April 3, 1939, typescript in Harry Hopkins Papers Brandeis also opposed Roosevelt's court-packing scheme of 1937, which proposed to add one additional justice to the Supreme Court for every sitting member who had reached the age of seventy without retiring. \\"This was,\\" felt Brandeis and others on the Court, a \\"thinly veiled attempt to change the decisions of the Court by adding new members who were supporters of the New Deal,\\" leading historian Nelson Dawson to conclude that \\"Brandeis ... was not alone in thinking that Roosevelt's scheme threatened the integrity of the institution.\\"Dawson, Nelson L. ed., Brandeis and America, Univ. Press of Kentucky (1989) Erie Railroad Co. v. Tompkins (1938) ‚Äì Federal versus state laws His last important judicial opinion was also one of the most significant of his career, according to Klebanow and Jonas. In Erie Railroad Co. v. Tompkins (1938), the Supreme Court addressed the issue of whether federal judges apply state law or federal \\"general law\\" where the parties to a lawsuit are from different states. Writing for the Court, Brandeis overruled the ninety-six-year-old doctrine of Swift v. Tyson (1842), and held that there was no such thing as a \\"federal general common law\\" in cases involving diversity jurisdiction. This concept became known as the Erie Doctrine. Applying the Erie Doctrine, federal courts now must conduct a choice of law analysis, which generally requires that the courts apply the law of the state where the injury or transaction occurred. \\"This ruling,\\" concluded Klebanow and Jonas, \\"fits in well with Brandeis's goals of strengthening the states and reversing the long-term trend toward centralization and bigness.\\" Zionism Relatively late in life the secular Brandeis also became a prominent figure in the Zionist movement. He became active in the Federation of American Zionists in 1912, as a result of a conversation with Jacob de Haas, according to some.Walter Laqueur, A History of Zionism, p.159; Peter Grose, Israel in the Mind of America, p. 48 His involvement provided the nascent American Zionist movement one of the most distinguished men in American life and a friend of the next president. Over the next several years he devoted a great deal of his time, energy, and money to championing the cause. With the outbreak of World War I in Europe, the divided allegiance of its membership rendered the World Zionist Organization impotent.Michael Brown, The Israeli-American Connection: Its Roots in the Yishuv, 1914‚Äì1945, (1996), p. 26 \\"In early 1914 the USS North Carolina arrived in Jaffa harbor with money and supplies provided by Schiff, the American Jewish Committee, and the Provisional Executive Committee for General Zionist Affairs, then acting for the WZO, which had been rendered impotent by the war.\\" American Jews then assumed a larger responsibility independent of Zionists in Europe. The Provisional Executive Committee for Zionist Affairs was established in New York for this purpose on August 20, 1914, and Brandeis was elected president of the organization. As president from 1914 to 1918, Brandeis became the leader and spokesperson of American Zionism. He embarked on a speaking tour in the fall and winter of 1914‚Äì1915 to garner support for the Zionist cause, emphasizing the goal of self- determination and freedom for Jews through the development of a Jewish homeland. Unlike the majority of American Jews at the time, he felt that the re-creation of a Jewish national homeland was one of the key solutions to antisemitism and the \\"Jewish problem\\" in Europe and Russia, while at the same time a way to \\"revive the Jewish spirit.\\" He explained his belief in the importance of Zionism in a famous speech he gave at a conference of Reform Rabbis in April 1915:Brandeis, Louis. \\"The Jewish Problem: How To Solve It\\", Speech given at a Conference of Eastern Council of Reform Rabbis, April 25, 1915 He also explained his belief that Zionism and patriotism were compatible concepts and should not lead to charges of \\"dual loyalty\\" which worried the rabbis and the dominant American Jewish Committee: Early in the war, Jewish leaders determined that they needed to elect a special representative body to attend the peace conference as spokesman for the religious, national and political rights of Jews in certain European countries, especially to guarantee that Jewish minorities were included wherever minority rights were recognized. Under the leadership of Brandeis, Stephen Wise and Julian Mack, the Jewish Congress Organization Committee was established in March 1915. The subsequent vehement debate about the idea of a \\"congress\\" stirred the feelings of American Jews and acquainted them with the Jewish problem. Brandeis's efforts to bring in the American Jewish Committee and some other Jewish organizations were unsuccessful; these organizations were quite willing to participate in a conference of appointed representatives, but were opposed to Brandeis's idea of convening a congress of delegates elected by the Jewish population. The following year, however, delegates representing over one million Jews came together in Philadelphia and elected a National Executive Committee with Brandeis as honorary chairman. On April 6, 1917, America entered the war. On June 10, 1917, 335,000 American Jews cast their votes and elected their delegates who, together with representatives of some 30 national organizations, established the American Jewish Congress on a democratically elected basis, but further efforts to organize awaited the end of the war. Brandeis also brought his influence to bear on the Wilson administration in the negotiations leading up to the Balfour Declaration and the Paris Peace Conference. In July 1919 he visited Palestine. Later in 1919 Brandeis broke with Chaim Weizmann, the leader of the European Zionism. In 1921 Weizmann's candidates, headed by Louis Lipsky, defeated Brandeis's for political control of the Zionist Organization of America. Brandeis resigned from the ZOA, along with his closest associates Rabbi Stephen S. Wise, Judge Julian W. Mack and Felix Frankfurter. His ouster was devastating to the movement, and by 1929 there were no more than 18,000 members in the ZOA. Nonetheless he remained active in philanthropy directed at Jews in Palestine. In the summer of 1930, these two factions and visions of Zionism, would come to a compromise largely on Brandeis's terms, with a changed leadership structure for the ZOA.Religion: Zionist Chiefs, Time, July 28, 1930 In the late 1930s he endorsed immigration to Palestine in an effort to help European Jews escape genocide when Britain denied entry to more Jews.Urofsky (2009) Death and legacy Brandeis retired from the Supreme Court on February 13, 1939, and he died on October 5, 1941, following a heart attack. The remains of both Justice Brandeis and his wife are interred beneath the portico of the Brandeis School of Law of the University of Louisville, in Louisville, Kentucky.

Brandeis himself made the arrangements that made the law school one of only thirteen Supreme Court repositories in the U.S. His professional papers are archived at the library there. Brandeis lived to see many of the ideas that he had championed become the law of the land. Wages and hours legislation were now accepted as constitutional, and the right of labor to organize was protected by law. His spirited, eloquent defense of free speech and the right of privacy have had a continuing, powerful influence upon the Supreme Court and, ultimately, upon the life of the entire nation. The Economist magazine has called him \\"A Robin Hood of the law,\\"The Economist, September 24, 2009 (\\"Books and Arts\\" section) and former Secretary of State Dean Acheson, his early law clerk, was \\"impressed by a man whose personal code called for ... the zealous molding of the lives of the underprivileged so that paupers might achieve moral growth.\\"Harper, John Lamberton. American Visions of Europe Cambridge Univ. Press (1996) Wayne McIntosh writes of him, \\"In our national juristic temple, some figures have been accorded near-Olympian reverence ... a part of that legal pantheon is Louis D. Brandeis ‚Äì all the more so, perhaps because Brandeis was far more than a great justice. He was also a social reformer, legal innovator, labor champion, and Zionist leader ... And it was as a judge that his concepts of privacy and free speech ultimately, if posthumously, resulted in virtual legal sea changes that continue to resonate even today.\\" Former Justice William O. Douglas wrote, \\"he helped America grow to greatness by the dedications of which he made his life.\\" The U.S. Postal Service in September 2009 honored Brandeis by featuring his image on a new set of commemorative stamps along with U.S. Supreme Court associate justices Joseph Story, Felix Frankfurter and William J. Brennan Jr., WLKY.com, October 21, 2009 In the Postal Service announcement about the stamp, he was credited with being \\"the associate justice most responsible for helping the Supreme Court shape the tools it needed to interpret the Constitution in light of the sociological and economic conditions of the 20th century.\\" The Postal Service honored him with a stamp image in part because, their announcement states, he was \\"a progressive and champion of reform, [and] Brandeis devoted his life to social justice. He defended the right of every citizen to speak freely, and his groundbreaking conception of the right to privacy continues to impact legal thought today.\\", new Brandeis commemorative stamp announced, December 2008 Brandeis was a founding member of the Massachusetts Bar Association.

It was created as the language for the operating system (OS) and application software of the Lilith personal workstation.Summary of Projects by N. Wirth, 1962‚Äì1999 It was later used for programming outside the context of the Lilith. Wirth viewed Modula-2 as a successor to his earlier programming languages Pascal and Modula.N. Wirth, \\"Pascal and its Successors\\". Software Pioneers, M. Broy and E. Denert, Eds. Springer-Verlag, 2002, Niklaus Wirth, \\"History and Goals of Modula-2\\". Dr. Dobb's Journal, 2005 The principal concepts are: # The module as a compiling unit for separate compiling # The coroutine as the basic building block for concurrent processes # Types and procedures that allow access to machine- specific data The language design was influenced by the Mesa language and the Xerox Alto, both from Xerox PARC, that Wirth saw during his 1976 sabbatical year there.N. Wirth, Programming in Modula-2, fourth Edition, page 4. The computer magazine Byte devoted the August 1984 issue to the language and its surrounding environment.Byte ‚Äì The Small Systems Journal, 1984 (8), pp. 143‚Äì232. Available at archive.org Modula-2 was followed by Modula-3, and later by the Oberon series of languages.  Description  Modula-2 is a general purpose procedural language, sufficiently flexible to do systems programming, but with much broader application. In particular, it was designed to support separate compiling and data abstracting in a straightforward way. Much of the syntax is based on Wirth's earlier and better-known language, Pascal. Modula-2 was designed to be broadly similar to Pascal, with some elements and syntactic ambiguities removed and the important addition of a module concept, and direct language support for multiprogramming. The language allows use of one-pass compilers. Such a compiler by Gutknecht and Wirth was about four times faster than earlier multi-pass compilers. Here is an example of the source code for the \\"Hello world\\" program: MODULE Hello; FROM STextIO IMPORT WriteString; BEGIN WriteString(\\"Hello World!\\"); END Hello. A Modula-2 module may be used to encapsulate a set of related subprograms and data structures, and restrict their visibility from other parts of the program. The module design implemented the data abstraction feature of Modula-2 in a very clean way. Modula-2 programs are composed of modules, each of which is made up of two parts: a definition module, the interface portion, which contains only those parts of the subsystem that are exported (visible to other modules), and an implementation module, which contains the working code that is internal to the module. The language has strict scope control. The scope of a module can be considered as an impenetrable wall: Except for standard identifiers, no object from the outside is visible inside a module unless explicitly imported; no internal module object is visible from the outside unless explicitly exported. Suppose module M1 exports objects a, b, c, and P by enumerating its identifiers in an explicit export list DEFINITION MODULE M1; EXPORT QUALIFIED a, b, c, P; ... Then the objects a, b,c, and P from module M1 become now known outside module M1 as M1.a, M1.b, M1.c, and M1.P. They are exported in a qualified manner to the outside (assumed module M1 is global). The exporting module's name, i.e. M1, is used as a qualifier followed by the object's name. Suppose module M2 contains the following IMPORT declaration MODULE M2; IMPORT M1; ... Then this means that the objects exported by module M1 to the outside of its enclosing program can now be used inside module M2. They are referenced in a qualified manner, thusly: M1.a, M1.b, M1.c, and M1.P. Example: ... M1.a := 0; M1.c := M1.P(M1.a + M1.b); ... Qualified export avoids name clashes: For example, if another module M3 would also export an object called P, then we can still distinguish the two objects, since M1.P differs from M3.P. Thanks to the qualified export it does not matter that both objects are called P inside their exporting modules M1 and M3. An alternative method exists, which is in wide use by Modula-2 programmers. Suppose module M4 is formulated as this: MODULE M4; FROM M1 IMPORT a, b, c, P; Then this means that objects exported by module M1 to the outside can again be used inside module M4, but now by mere references to the exported identifiers in an unqualified manner, thusly: a, b, c, and P. Example: ... a := 0; c := P(a + b); ... This method of unqualifying import allows use of variables and other objects outside their exporting module in exactly the same simple, i.e. unqualified, manner as inside the exporting module. The walls surrounding all modules have now become irrelevant for all those objects for which this has been explicitly allowed. Of course unqualifying import is only usable if there are no name clashes. These export and import rules may seem unnecessarily restrictive and verbose. But they do not only safeguard objects against unwanted access, but also have the pleasant side-effect of providing automatic cross-referencing of the definition of every identifier in a program: if the identifier is qualified by a module name, then the definition comes from that module. Otherwise if it occurs unqualified, simply search backwards, and you will either encounter a declaration of that identifier, or its occurrence in an IMPORT statement which names the module it comes from. This property becomes very useful when trying to understand large programs containing many modules. The language provides for (limited) single-processor concurrency (monitors, coroutines and explicit transfer of control) and for hardware access (absolute addresses, bit manipulation, and interrupts). It uses a nominal type system.  Dialects  There are two major dialects of Modula-2. The first is PIM, named for the book Programming in Modula-2 by Niklaus Wirth. There were three major editions of PIM, the second, third (corrected), and fourth editions, each describing slight variants of the language. The second major dialect is ISO, named for the standardization effort by the International Organization for Standardization. Here are a few of the differences among them. * PIM2 (1983) ** Required explicit EXPORT clause in definition modules. ** Function SIZE needs to be imported from module SYSTEM * PIM3 (1985) ** Removed the EXPORT clause from definition modules following the observation that everything within a definition module defines the interface to that module, hence the EXPORT clause was redundant. ** Function SIZE is pervasive (visible in any scope without import) * PIM4 (1988) ** Specified the behaviour of the MOD operator when the operands are negative. ** Required all ARRAY OF CHAR strings to be terminated by ASCII NUL, even if the string fits exactly into its array. * ISO (1996 and 1998) ** ISO Modula-2 resolved most of the ambiguities in PIM Modula-2. It added the data types COMPLEX and LONGCOMPLEX, exceptions, module termination (FINALLY clause) and a complete standard I/O library. There are numerous minor differences and clarifications.ISO/IEC 10514-1:1996  Supersets  There are several supersets of Modula-2 with language extensions for specific application domains: * PIM supersets ** Canterbury Modula-2, extended with Oberon-like extensible records [This has been withdrawn and is no longer available anywhere] ** Modula-2+, extended with preemptive threads and exceptions ** Modula-2*, parallel extensionTichy et al., Modula-2*: An Extension for Modula-2 for highly parallel portable programs, University of Karlsruhe [1990] ** Modula-P, another parallel extensionBr√§unl, Parallel Programming, Prentice-Hall [1993] ** Modula-Prolog, adding a Prolog layer ** Modula/R, with relational database extensions ** Modula-GM, extensions for embedded systems * ISO supersets ** ISO10514-2, adding an object-oriented programming layermodula2.org, 5.

Where can I get information about ISO Modula-2?, * IEC supersets ** Mod51, extended with IEC1131 constructs for embedded development  Derivatives  There are several derivative languages that resemble Modula-2 very closely but are new languages in their own right. Most are different languages with different purposes and with strengths and weaknesses of their own: * Modula-3, developed by a team of ex-Xerox employees who had moved to DEC and OlivettiCardelli et al., Modula-3 Report, Research Report 31, Systems Research Center, Digital Equipment Corporation, [1988] * Oberon, developed at ETH Z√ºrich for System OberonN.

Blasband, The YAFL Programming Language, Second Edition, [1993] Many other current programming languages have adopted features of Modula-2.  Language elements   Reserved words  PIM [2,3,4] defines the following 40 reserved words: AND ELSIF LOOP REPEAT ARRAY END MOD RETURN BEGIN EXIT MODULE SET BY EXPORT NOT THEN CASE FOR OF TO CONST FROM OR TYPE DEFINITION IF POINTER UNTIL DIV IMPLEMENTATION PROCEDURE VAR DO IMPORT QUALIFIED WHILE ELSE IN RECORD WITH  Built-in identifiers  PIM [3,4] defines the following 29 built-in identifiers: ABS EXCL LONGINT REAL BITSET FALSE LONGREAL SIZE BOOLEAN FLOAT MAX TRUE CAP HALT MIN TRUNC CARDINAL HIGH NIL VAL CHAR INC ODD CHR INCL ORD DEC INTEGER PROC  Use in embedded systems   Cambridge Modula-2  Cambridge Modula-2 by Cambridge Microprocessor Systems is based on a subset of PIM4 with language extensions for embedded development. The compiler runs on DOS and it generates code for Motorola 68000 series (M68k) based embedded microcontrollers running a MINOS operating system.  Mod51  Mod51 by Mandeno Granville Electronics is based on ISO Modula-2 with language extensions for embedded development following IEC1131, an industry standard for programmable logic controllers (PLC) closely related to Modula-2. The Mod51 compiler generates standalone code for 80C51 based microcontrollers.  Modula-GM  Delco Electronics, then a subsidiary of GM Hughes Electronics, developed a version of Modula-2 for embedded control systems starting in 1985. Delco named it Modula-GM. It was the first high-level programming language used to replace machine code (language) for embedded systems in Delco's engine control units (ECUs). This was significant because Delco was producing over 28,000 ECUs per day in 1988 for GM. This was then the world's largest producer of ECUs.Delco Electronics Electron Magazine, The Atwood Legacy, Spring '89, page 25 The first experimental use of Modula-GM in an embedded controller was in the 1985 Antilock Braking System Controller which was based on the Motorola 68xxx microprocessor, and in 1993 Gen-4 ECU used by the Champ Car World Series Championship Auto Racing Teams (CART) and Indy Racing League (IRL) teams.Development of electronics for GM auto racing The first production use of Modula-GM was its use in GM trucks starting with the 1990 model year vehicle control module (VCM) used to manage GM Powertrain's Vortec engines. Modula-GM was also used on all ECUs for GM's 90¬∞ Buick V6 engine family 3800 Series II used in the 1997-2005 model year Buick Park Avenue. The Modula-GM compilers and associated software management tools were sourced by Delco from Intermetrics. Modula-2 was selected as the basis for Delco's high level language because of its many strengths over other alternative language choices in 1986. After Delco Electronics was spun off from GM (with other component divisions) to form Delphi Automotive Systems in 1995, global sourcing required that a non-proprietary high-level software language be used. ECU embedded software now developed at Delphi is compiled with commercial compilers for the language C.  Russian GPS satellites  According to the Modula-2 article in the Russian Wikipedia, all satellites of the Russian GPS framework GLONASS are programmed in Modula-2.

It is a turbid, light- yellow liquid that is obtained from human blood platelets after freeze/thaw cycle(s). The freeze/thaw cycle causes the platelets to lyse, releasing a large quantity of growth factors necessary for cell expansion. FBS-free cell culture media, e.g. with platelet lysate or chemically defined/ animal component free, are used for cell therapy or regenerative medicine. They are commercially available in GMP (good manufacturing practice)-quality which is generally basis for regulatory approval.Laner‚ÄëPlamberger et al. J Transl Med (2015) 13:354  Process  Platelets have a life span of 5 to 9 days. Because of this, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) expires transfuse-able platelets 5 days post-collection. Typically, hPL is produced from expired platelets that have been stored in frozen conditions no later than 7 days post-collection. hPL is created from single or pooled donor-donated platelets isolated from whole blood or by apheresis, distributed in a standard platelet collection bag. There are some differences between hPL manufacturing protocols, but they all share the same core of being frozen at very low temperatures and thawed. This process may be repeated two or three times to cause complete platelet lysis. The resultant hPL can then undergo different manufacturing steps to achieve multiple grades of hPL. The most common form of hPL undergoes few processing steps, producing a product made of the supernatant following the freeze/thaw process. The included clotting factors require to add heparin to the cell culture media to prevent coagulation during incubation. Another form of hPL is one that can be used in cell culture without the need of heparin, or any anticoagulant, addition. This grade of hPL goes through further manufacturing steps to inhibit the effect the clotting factors have. Many labs around the world are creating small amounts of hPL to suit their laboratory needs. The disadvantages of this process are: cost and consistency. When creating small batches of hPL (single or few donors pooled), the lot-to-lot consistency of the hPL becomes variable. Large-scale manufacturing by pooling many platelet donors is a necessity to mitigate the donor-to-donor variability. Consistency is a top priority for experimental designs to provide reproducible results. Platelet lysate is commonly used for supplementation of basal media in mesenchymal stem cells culture. Prior the use, the pathogen inactivation process is recommended to prevent pathogen transmission.  Global sales  Human platelet lysate is available commercially through AventaCell BioMedical, Mill Creek Life Sciences, Compass Biomedical, Inc., Sexton Biotechnologies, Macopharma SA, iBiologics, PL BioScience GmbH, Life Science Productions Ltd(UK) and Trinova Biochem GmbH under the product lines UltraGRO, PLTMax, PLUS, Stemulate, Human Platelet Lysate, XcytePlus, PLSOLUTION, PLMATRIX and CRUX RUFA Media Supplements. Some companies provide different grades of platelet lysate including GMP versions and clinical grade for use in human clinical trials. Platelet lysate offers a true human-based recombinant protein platform. Platelet lysate has been tested in various cell culture applications including use in advanced bioreactor systems.Platelet lysate consisting of a natural repair proteome supports human mesenchymal stem cell proliferation and chromosomal stability.

The Special Court for the Clergy had ordered that he do not teach and receive students. His writings were censored. Background Nematollah Salehi Najafabadi was born in 1923/24 and studied in Isfahan with Ayatollah Rahim Arbab and Ayatollah Haj Shaikh Mohammad Hasan Alem Najafabadi. Later he continued his studies in Qom with Ayatollah Alameh Tabatabai and Ayatollah Boroujerdi. His most outstanding work is Shahid-e Javid (The Eternal Martyr), which he started to conceive in 1961. It radically reinterpreted early Shii history. Despite the author's house arrest, it is in its fifth printing in Iran.

It was released in 1989 as the third single from his studio album entitled Busca una Mujer (1988) and became his second #1 single on the Billboard Hot Latin Tracks chart after \\"Ahora Te Puedes Marchar\\" in 1987. The song broke several airplay records in Latin America reaching the top of the charts in Mexico (where it became the biggest hit of the year), Argentina and Chile among many other countries. The success of the song helped push the album to #3 on the Billboard Latin Pop Albums with approximate sales of four million units. \\"La Incondicional\\" won Pop Song of the Year at the Premios Lo Nuestro in 1990. In 2008, VH1 Latin America aired the program entitled The 100 Greatest Songs of the '80s in Spanish which declared \\"La Incondicional\\" as the #1 Spanish track of the 1980s. Chart performance The song debuted on the Billboard Hot Latin Tracks chart at #32 the week of April 1, 1989. After its first week at #32, it dropped out of the chart for one week but then reentered the following week at #36 and climbed all the way to the Top Ten the week of May 6, 1989. \\"La Incondicional\\" reached #1 the week of May 27, 1989, and held this position for seven consecutive weeks (replacing \\"C√≥mo T√∫\\" by Jos√© Jos√© and being replaced by \\"Baila Mi Rumba\\" by Jos√© Luis Rodr√≠guez. \\"La Incondicional\\" ranked third in the Hot Latin Tracks Year-End Chart of 1989 and became Luis Miguel's second #1 single in the United States following \\"Ahora Te Puedes Marchar\\" which reached #1 two years earlier. In Latin America, reached number-one on the Guatemalan Spanish Charts and in Ecuador. The song was certified gold in Mexico. Music video A music video was directed by Pedro Torres, and was one of the first super-productions presented in Mexico. The music video was filmed in locations of Heroico Colegio Militar in Mexico City. The story was about a man who serves for the Mexican Air Force in his country, and separates from the love of his life. The music video surprised some of his fans because Luis Miguel's look at the time had him sport a semi-long hair, yet in the video he appears with a very short military hairstyle. It was included in Grandes Exitos Videos. In the long version of the music video, Luis Miguel is having his hair cut to simulate military standards. Cover versions \\"La Incondicional\\" has been covered by several performers including the All Stars Big Band, Miguel Angel, Austin, Banda Viejo Oeste, Richard Clayderman, Ernesto D'Alessio, Estilo de Durango, Fabian, Florida, Mikel Herzog, Juan Gotti, the Latin Stars Orchestra, the Latin Tribute Players, Edith M√°rquez, Los Nietos, Nu Flavor, La Posta, Emilio Santiago, and Tropical Florida. Sergio Vargas of the Dominican Republic also recorded a tropical merengue version of the song which was included on his self-titled fourth album. This version peaked at #28 on the Billboard Hot Latin Tracks chart in 1990.

It was the first church established in Greeneville and is one of the oldest churches in the State of Tennessee. First Presbyterian Church, originally Mount Bethel Presbyterian Church, was first gathered in 1780 at the Big Spring in downtown Greeneville, with the first services preached by traveling frontier minister Samuel Doak. In 1783, regular services began, and Rev. Hezekiah Balch was the first settled minister. History A log church was built near the present day Greeneville Town Hall and in 1798 after a split involving a theological rift over Hopkinsianism, the church was renamed Harmony Church. In 1840, the name was changed to Greeneville Presbyterian Church. The present brick building was erected in 1848. During this time, the congregation was the only church between Knoxville and Washington College, an area of approximately 100 miles.http://www.historicmapworks.com/Buildings/index.php?state=TN&city;=Greeneville&id;=29816 In 1928, a fire destroyed the interior of the sanctuary; however, the brick walls were fortunately left intact. In 1940, the name was changed to First Presbyterian Church, as it exists today. In 1926, a 3-story education wing was built. Christ Chapel was built and dedicated in 1999 under the direction of former senior minister, the Rev. Dr. Daniel Donaldson. The church and its congregation were heavily involved in the abolitionist movement in East Tennessee. Rev. Hezekiah Balch freed his slaves at the Greene County Courthouse in 1807. Rev. Samuel Doak, the founder of Tusculum College, followed in 1818. Francis McCorkle, the pastor of Greeneville's Presbyterian Church, was a leading member of the Manumission Society of Tennessee. First Presbyterian Church is the parent church of Tusculum College. It is listed as a historic place with the Tennessee Historical Commission (marker 1C-59) and is also listed on the National Register of Historic Places as part of the Greeneville Historic District. When the church split in 1798, members that adhered to the Old School theology kept the name Mount Bethel. Later, Mount Bethel merged with Covenant Presbyterian of Tusculum, which in 1990, merged with First Presbyterian ending a 192 year separation. Pipe Organs Sanctuary of First Presbyterian Church In 1905, the first pipe organ, an Estey Organ, was purchased and subsequently installed. In 1924, the organ was improved by the M. P. M√∂ller Company of Hagerstown, Maryland. The instrument was two manuals and pedal, of 20 ranks. This instrument was destroyed by a fire in 1928 that gutted the interior of the sanctuary. The congregation quickly rebuilt, replacing the organ with essentially the same instrument. In 1945, a three rank antiphonal division was installed in the balcony. In 1964, a new three manual instrument was built by the Greenwood Organ Company of Charlotte, North Carolina. This was a 21 rank instrument, including the antiphonal division. Much of the pipework from the previous M√∂ller instrument was re-voiced and re-used, with 10 ranks being new A set of chimes was also added to the instrument at this time. In the early 1990s, the Schantz Organ Company of Orrville, Ohio was contracted to build a new instrument of 27 ranks and 1,630 pipes. Fifteen ranks of pipes were completely new (essentially the Great and Choir divisions), while some pipes and materials were carried over from the 1964 instrument. The organ is split in chambers on either side of the chancel, with the Great and Choir on the left, and the Swell and Pedal on the right.http://www.firstpresgreeneville.org/Resources/Schantz%20organ.pdf In 1999, the J. F. Nordlie Company, of Sioux Falls, South Dakota built their Opus 16 instrument for Christ Chapel.

He would drive Ford vehicles from the late 1930s during his formative years in professional stock car racing. As a competitor in the 1955 Southern 500, he had the fastest finishing Ford in the race with a fifth-place finish.1955 Southern 500 race information at Racing Reference Flynn's impressive accomplishment gave credibility to the Ford racing teams that were racing in NASCAR during that era. During the 1956 Southern 500, he would crash into fellow NASCAR driver Bill Brown in an incident that would cause the fence to be temporarily broken. His total career earnings in the NASCAR Grand National Series were considered to be $1,700 ($ when adjusted for inflation) and he finished 1162 laps (1439.6 miles) of racing. Flynn also racked up a single top-five finish in addition to his only top-ten finish. After suffering from complications due to his diabetes, Flynn would die in 2007 at the age of 77. Most of the races in Larry's NASCAR Cup Series career were done as a driver/owner. However, he would race in the 1955 Southern 500 under the employment of Mr. W.R. Waldon. In 1970, Flynn won the Bobby McKim Memorial Race at the DeLand Drive-In Raceway, having set the fastest qualifying time for the event.

The facility appears to be a pre-World War II civil airport which may have also been used by the Italian Regia Aeronautica Air Force. After the Italian invasion of Egypt and the arrival of the German Luftwaffe in 1941, it was used by the Axis as a military airfield. After the seizure of Bengazi by the British Eighth Army during the Western Desert Campaign in early 1943, it was used by the United States Army Air Force during the North African Campaign by the 98th Bombardment Group, which flew B-24 Liberator heavy bombers from the airfield between 26 March-4 April 1943. In the 1950s and 1960s Berka II was Detachment 3 (a radar site ) of the 633rd Aircraft Control and Warning Squadron, which had its main site at Wheelus Air Force Base at Tripoli and Detachment 2 at Misurata, both in Libya.

GLaDOS later appeared in The Lab and Lego Dimensions. The character was created by Erik Wolpaw and Kim Swift and voiced by Ellen McLain. GLaDOS is responsible for testing and maintenance in the Aperture Science Computer-Aided Enrichment Center in all titles. While GLaDOS initially appears in the first game to simply be a voice that guides the player, her words and actions become increasingly malicious as she makes her intentions clear. The second game, as well as the Valve-created comic Lab Rat, reveals that she was mistreated by the scientists and used a neurotoxin to kill the scientists in the laboratory before the events of Portal. She is apparently destroyed at the end of the first game but returns in the sequel, in which she is comically supplanted and temporarily stuck on a potato battery. The inspiration for the character's creation extends from Wolpaw's use of a text-to-speech program while writing lines for the video game Psychonauts. Other game developers working on Psychonauts found the lines funnier as a result of the synthesized voice. GLaDOS was originally intended to be present solely in the first area of Portal; she was well received by other designers and her role was expanded as a result. Play testers were motivated to complete tests in the game due to her guidance. While the game was initially designed with other characters, they were later removed, leaving GLaDOS as the only character players encounter. The physical appearance of GLaDOS went through several designs, one of which featured a large disk below her. McLain imitated dialog read aloud by a speech synthesizer with her own voice, which was then processed to sound more robotic, and performed songs in character during the closing credits of both entries in the series. \\"Still Alive\\" became hugely successful, notably appearing in the Rock Band game series, and has been a popular song for YouTube users to cover. GLaDOS has been well received by critics and gamers, some of whom called her narcissistic, passive-aggressive, sinister, and witty. She is considered one of the greatest video game characters, particularly among those created in the 2000s. Universally praised for her contributions to the caliber of Portals narrative, GLaDOS received multiple awards for being the best new game character in 2007 from GameSpy, GamePro, and X-Play. A number of publications listed her as one of the all-time greatest video game villains, including IGN and Game Informer, both of which ranked her first. She has been the subject of significant critical analysis from both journalists and game developers, who have compared her to other villainous computer systems in fiction, including HAL 9000 from 2001: A Space Odyssey and SHODAN from System Shock. Description For much of Portal, GLaDOS serves solely as the narrator, guiding players through the test chambers. Her voice is robotic, but distinctly female. Over time, players learn that she is, in fact, leading the player-character Chell to her death. As Chell escapes her control, GLaDOS' announcements get increasingly personal and farcical. Her personality has been described as passive-aggressive, witty, narcissistic, and sinister. She has several system personality cores installed into her, partly to prevent her from killing anyone. At the climax of the game, Chell enters GLaDOS' chambers, where it is revealed that she's actually a complex artificial intelligence system composed of robotic parts hanging from a larger device. Once the player removes the first personality core, the morality core, GLaDOS' voice becomes less robotic and more sensual. Originally, GLaDOS was designed as an artificial intelligence and research assistant meant to aid Aperture Science in competing with the Black Mesa Research Facility on the creation of portal technology. Later proposed uses for GLaDOS included implementation as a fuel line ice inhibitor and disk operating system. GLaDOS is installed to serve as the Enrichment Center's central control computer, mounted in a large, sealed chamber alongside several control consoles and an incinerator, the latter being her eventual demise. Wheatley, a personality core previously attached to GLaDOS at a nondescript time, is introduced in Portal 2. He was designed with the purpose of giving her bad ideas and inhibiting her personality. Through Wheatley, it's understood by the player that while GLaDOS is attached to the Aperture Science facility, she is driven to test due to a euphoric sensation induced by its completion. Upon being disconnected from the Aperture Science facility, GLaDOS treats Chell with more civility. The player then learns that GLaDOS' personality was inherited from that of Caroline, the personal assistant of Aperture Science CEO Cave Johnson and is much warmer to Chell when under Caroline's influence. Appearances Portal In Portal, GLaDOS is Chell's only link with the situation she is placed in; at the game's start, she introduces Chell to the game's Enrichment Center and the physics of the portal gun. In later stages of the center, GLaDOS admits to having lied to Chell about her progress, as part of a supposed \\"test protocol\\". GLaDOS slowly becomes more sinister, and Chell's trust in GLaDOS is tested when the AI directs Chell into a testing area populated with live-fire turrets, a course designed for military androids. The AI claims that the regular test chamber is unavailable due to \\"mandatory scheduled maintenance\\". GLaDOS uses the lure of cake and grief counseling to encourage Chell to continue, but at the final testing area, as Chell prepares to receive the supposed cake, GLaDOS attempts to incinerate Chell in a fire pit. Once Chell escapes, GLaDOS attempts to reconcile with Chell, claiming the pit was a final test. At the end of the game, after Chell moves through the bowels of the Enrichment Center, GLaDOS' chamber is reached, where the final encounter occurs. In this encounter Chell dislodges the various personality cores (each also voiced by McLain, with the exception of the final core, which is voiced in a guttural fashion by Mike Patton) and incinerates them. During the battle, it is revealed that before the events of Portal, GLaDOS released a neurotoxin into the Enrichment Center (revealed to occur on Take Your Daughter to Work Day in the sequel), which resulted in the surviving scientists installing a morality core to prevent further incidents. After the cores are incinerated, the room is sucked into a vortex leading to the surface and GLaDOS is destroyed. Portal 2 In Portal 2, GLaDOS initially resumes her role as test monitor in a now-ruined facility after Chell and Wheatley inadvertently reactivate her. This time, she makes no attempt to hide her contempt and hatred for Chell; partly because Chell destroyed her, and partly because a backup system has forced her to relive her death over and over since her deactivation. Soon after she repairs the facility, Wheatley convinces Chell to perform a core transfer, putting him in charge of the facility in place of GLaDOS. At this point, he immediately becomes power-mad and puts GLaDOS into a potato battery before she tells him that he was originally 'designed to be a moron'. He then turns on Chell and slams the elevator they are in, sending both into the bowels of the facility. GLaDOS is kidnapped by a bird and later saved by Chell, who teams up with GLaDOS to escape from the facility. While they are escaping from the old testing facility, GLaDOS discovers that her personality originally came from an assistant to former Aperture CEO Cave Johnson named Caroline, who was later uploaded into the GLaDOS program (it is suggested that this might have been done against her will at Cave Johnson's urging). After surviving Wheatley's various attempts to murder them, the two manage to corrupt him enough to perform another core transfer (though the process is interrupted by Wheatley). After placing a portal on the moon, Chell and Wheatley get sucked out into space (still connected to the computer chassis), and GLaDOS regains control of the facility, severing Wheatley's connection (causing him to get sucked into deep space) but saving Chell. GLaDOS reveals she felt relief for her safety but realises that Caroline lives in her through emotion and immediately deletes her, reverting GLaDOS to her old self. Nevertheless, she decides that it is in her best interest to let Chell go, as GLaDOS learned the easiest solution is usually the best one and felt that killing Chell was \\"too hard\\". Other games GLaDOS also appears in an expansion to tower defense game Defense Grid: The Awakening, entitled You Monster, where she tests the player's abilities in a Portal-themed set of levels. In the crossover title Poker Night 2, GLaDOS appears as the dealer and is a part of an announcer pack for Valve's Dota 2. The crossover-franchise game Lego Dimensions includes a significant amount of Portal content, including a Lego-constructed GLaDOS (voiced by McLain) as one of the main villains in the game's primary story. The heroes are forced through more Aperture tests (in which she accuses them of cheating through the usage of the keystones and their abilities) and eventually defeat GLaDOS by introducing her to HAL 9000 to distract her long enough to damage her. GLaDOS continues to appear in other areas through the main story, adding Portal-themed elements to other worlds and eventually aiding the heroes in defeating the primary antagonist, and on conclusion of the game, she sings a song during the credits, \\"You Wouldn't Know\\", again sung by McLain and written by Coulton. GLaDOS also acts as the primary antagonist in a bonus level bridging the events of Portal 2 with Lego Dimensions, wherein Chell and Wheatley (returned from space redeemed with anti-gravity abilities) defeat her by performing a core transfer using the Space Core. GLaDOS leads the player in solving bridge-making puzzles within Aperture in Bridge Constructor Portal. GLaDOS makes an appearance in Death Stranding revealing themselves after completing the final companion cube crossover side quests. Development history GLaDOS went through several redesigns before artists settled on the final anthropomorphic shape. Early concepts featured a floating brain and a spider-like appearance. Before development of GLaDOS had begun, Erik Wolpaw was writing the script for the video game Psychonauts, where he went around the office, finding people to provide voices to the words until they could add the final voices to the game. Once he ran out of people, however, he began using a text-to-speech program. According to Wolpaw, people found the lines funnier than they were worth. He commented that \\"no amount of writing is funnier than this text-to-speech thing reading it.\\" He became bitter about that, stating that he would leverage this and use it to his advantage. Portal had been under development for about a year, at a state where there were only test chambers that the player moved between. Valve found from playtesting that while players had fun with the game's concept, they were left asking of where these puzzles were leading towards. The team worked to come up with some type of narrative, coming down to creating an antagonist that would guide the player in early part of the game but become the goal that the player would strive for by the end. The creation of GLaDOS to serve this purpose began with a discussion between the Valve team and Wolpaw on the narrative constraints they had to deal with. When they were designing the game, they found that they did not have enough time or staffing to use human characters, due to the amount of animation work and scene choreography involved. A week later, to alleviate this problem, Wolpaw returned with sample dialogue made with a text-to-speech program, which was intended to be used as a series of messages relayed to the player in the relaxation vault, the first area of the game. The team liked the voice, describing it as \\"funny\\" and \\"sinister\\", so Wolpaw decided to add this voice to other test chambers, all the while trying to think of story elements. The developers noticed that play testers were more motivated by the voice because they became attached to it. As a result, the team decided to make GLaDOS the narrative voice of Portal. While designing GLaDOS, one of the rules that the writers had was that they would not make her seem like a computer, for example having her say, \\"Oh my nuts and bolts.\\" While GLaDOS is physically a computer and speaks with a computerized voice, they intended her to speak to the player-character like a regular person. The Birth of Venus was the inspiration for one design of GLaDOS, where GLaDOS' physical appearance was similar to the Roman goddess Venus', but upside down. GLaDOS' physical appearance went through several iterations when Valve had Jason Brashill help drive the visual creation of GLaDOS. Early designs used for her included a floating brain, a spider-like appearance, and an upside-down version of Sandro Botticelli's painting The Birth of Venus with the four personality cores around her body. Eventually, they settled on the design of the robotic figure hanging upside down. This was done to convey both a sense of raw mechanical power and femininity.Portal commentary A large disk with the four personality cores hanging from it was added to her design, when she was still just a sphere standing above it. However, the team found it to be too small, giving her a body and putting it below the disk. Another early design was when GLaDOS was only a cube, which was used for the removed laser battle mentioned below. The large chamber that the player-character encounters was the result of the team wanting to build a space that brought a great deal of attention to her. GLaDOS was written with the intent of making her more understandable and empathetic to players, making her villainy more tragic. Kim Swift, team leader of Portal, described her growth in the game as her becoming more and more human. The two-hour total playtime for Portal allowed the writers enough time to let players get to know GLaDOS. Wolpaw commented that while GLaDOS did yell and fire rockets at the player, she fulfilled his desire for a villain who has not been \\"done to death\\". He described her as both supportive and funny, while also sad and scared. One of his intentions was for players to believe that they are \\"putting her through the wringer emotionally\\". The game was designed to have a clear beginning, middle, and end. Wolpaw stated that with each new part, GLaDOS' personality changed. She begins as a supportive, yet also increasingly sinister character, where she delivers exposition about the general Aperture mindset. However, once the player-character escapes, she begins to speak in first-person singular rather than first-person plural. She shows desperation due to her lack of control at this point, adding that more emotion begins to creep through her voice. After destroying the morality core, she becomes unhinged, featuring an almost human voice. This voice, described as sultry by Wolpaw, was originally to be used for turrets, but it did not work out. Because they liked it so much, they chose to use it for GLaDOS. Valve described GLaDOS' actions in Portal 2 as attempting to build a relationship with the player-character, and the only way to accomplish this is by testing her. Voice design GLaDOS is voiced by actress Ellen McLain. In creating the voice for GLaDOS, voice actress Ellen McLain attempted to sound like a computer. This was accomplished by her emulating a computer-generated voice that the Valve team played for her and her adding emotion to lines when appropriate. While designing her voice, Swift commented that it was difficult to write some of the lines for GLaDOS, describing McLain as \\"super likable\\", and that they should write for that. She also performed the song \\"Still Alive\\", which features GLaDOS singing to the effect that she is still alive by the end of Portal. This song was written by Jonathan Coulton, who was approached by the team and asked if he would want to write a song for them. He later decided that it would be a good idea to do a song featuring one of the voices from the game that would tie up the story at the end. Swift stated that the team wanted the players to leave the game happy, leading to them implementing the song in the first place. Wolpaw and the other writers wrote down a list of things that would make people happy, which resulted in \\"Still Alive\\". In discussing the difficulties in singing the song as GLaDOS, McLain listed one of the difficulties as breathing, because computers do not need to breathe. As a result, she had to sing the phrases in one breath, while attempting to keep a clean, even tone. Swift commented in an interview that one of the focuses of developing the game was for players to hear GLaDOS and hear her song. GLaDOS continues to be voiced by McLain in Portal 2, who worked with Valve every two weeks to record the majority of the dialogue for the game. The frequency of her voice sessions allowed Valve to experiment with GLaDOS' lines and how they came out within the final game. After finding that \\"Still Alive\\" was a large part of Portal's success, Valve included more music in Portal 2, including further involvement from Coulton. Coulton wrote a new song for the game's ending credits, \\"Want You Gone\\", which is written from GLaDOS' viewpoint of wanting to rid herself of Chell. It is performed by McLain. The writers found they needed another character to play off of Portal 2's Cave Johnson during his recordings; instead of hiring a voice actor for a few lines, they economized by reusing McLain to play Caroline, Cave's assistant. This led naturally to providing a backstory for the creation of GLaDOS, who is revealed in-game to be Caroline who was put into GLaDOS. This later led the writers to develop a full story arc for GLaDOS where she would come to recall her past, learn from it to solve the dilemma and then subsequently delete it and reset herself. Final battle In designing the final 'encounter' with GLaDOS in Portal, one of the important aspects to it was giving the players a predisposition to the Weighted Companion Cube, an object that GLaDOS gives to the player-character and tells her to protect. This was accomplished by forcing the player to incinerate it, therein providing a tutorial for how to defeat the boss and a revenge angle. GLaDOS was originally designed to be a devious boss, citing one form where she would use a series of lasers, like those seen in James Bond films. However, it was determined that this twitch gameplay distracted players from GLaDOS, and was too different from the game's puzzle-solving gameplay. Additionally, it was difficult for players to detect when they were hit, so the developers switched the gameplay to feature rockets. This incarnation of the final boss was dubbed \\"Portal Kombat\\", which Swift describes as a \\"high intensity rocket battle\\". However, Wolpaw disliked it because no one was paying attention to what GLaDOS was saying. While it went over well with hardcore shooter fans, the people who liked the puzzle-focused gameplay were turned off by it. The third boss was a chase scene, with players pursuing GLaDOS down a corridor. Wolpaw sharply criticized the pacing, which caused the players to wander around until they found the corridor, at which point a series of pistons would spring out of the walls. The developers came to the conclusion that complex battles would only serve to confuse players. One play tester helped them by pointing out the quality of the fire pit puzzle, a puzzle that has the player-character riding on a moving platform that is descending into flames, requiring players to find a way to survive. He stated that it was both dramatic and exciting, but also a difficult puzzle. Wolpaw stated that this made no sense, commenting that it was one of the easiest puzzles in the game. He added that the battle was a dramatic high-point, since it was being the first time GLaDOS directly tries to kill the player-character and the first time that players have to use the environment to their advantage. After learning about what fellow Valve developers had planned for the final boss battle in Half-Life 2: Episode Two, the Portal developers decided to implement a neurotoxin that would kill the player-character in six minutes. This made it easier on the writers, who only had to write six minutes of dialogue. As a result, they scaled the game back, intending to ensure that everyone was able to see the game to the very end. In Portal 2 Erik Wolpaw and Jay Pinkerton were mainly responsible for the single player campaign's story, while Chet Faliszek focused on the lines for GLaDOS in the cooperative campaign. Portal 2 was originally not intended to feature GLaDOS or Chell, the player-character from Portal. However, the demand for all of these to be implemented into Portal 2 was great enough that they chose to do so. Originally, the character Cave Johnson was intended to be the antagonist instead and Portal 2 to be a prequel. Before implementing Chell, they considered introducing a new player-character who would at one point inadvertently reactivate GLaDOS. During play testing, Wolpaw found that there were two groups that were \\"at-odds\\": one group was excited to see GLaDOS return, while the other did not want to wake her up and questioned why players would want to do that. As such, the character Wheatley was introduced, who inadvertently wakes GLaDOS while trying to escape the facilities with Chell. Wheatley and GLaDOS served as a contrasts to each other; where GLaDOS has a more \\"computery-sounding\\" voice due to her intelligence, Wheatley \\"sounded perfectly human\\" due to his lack of it. Play testers were also bothered by the fact that the new protagonist was not recognized by GLaDOS when she awoke; as such, they changed the new character back into Chell. Wolpaw and the designers were not sure what to do with GLaDOS and were wary to do the same thing as the last game. They felt that she should \\"go someplace\\" and that since GLaDOS is \\"kind of likeable in the first game\\" and players \\"enjoy being with her\\", they would utilize Wheatley as an \\"other, external threat\\". In the early part of the game, GLaDOS introduces each chamber and congratulates the player on completing it; though they could have included intermediate dialog from GLaDOS while the player attempts to solve each chamber, they found this would be distracting to players and limited her presence in the game to only these points. The developers considered having GLaDOS and Chell act as \\"buddy cops against a new threat\\", but felt that since Chell never talked, it would not work. He compared her transformation into a potato and having her power stripped away to the game Jenga: \\"You‚Äôre taking stuff off the bottom and seeing what happens.\\" While she was in the potato form, the designers noticed a \\"very stark difference between this imperious, all-powerful GLaDOS talking to you, and this powerless GLaDOS talking to you on your gun\\". They found that play testers were not interested in her when she was powerless and insulting players and would question why they were \\"carting this person along\\". They decided to give her a personality shift and become Chell's \\"sidekick\\" on the basis that \\"she can‚Äôt just be needling you for a half hour\\". In order to keep players from feeling that they should want to abandon GLaDOS in her powerless form to prevent her from becoming powerful again, the designers made sure to give players reason to bring her with them. In considering the interaction between Chell and GLaDOS, Erik Johnson compared GLaDOS to \\"a jealous ex- girlfriend\\", noting \\"[Chell is] the only person she can have interaction with, but the problem is her only way of interacting with anyone is to test them\\". While they introduced new characters into the game, the focus of the story in Portal 2 remained the connection and interaction between Chell and GLaDOS, and focuses more on the fallout from Chell's destruction of GLaDOS from the first game. The co-operative campaign contains a separate story between the two robotic characters and GLaDOS. The co-operative campaign includes additional dialog from GLaDOS; the original dialog Wolpaw wrote for GLaDOS was aimed to two women, Chell and a new character \\"Mel\\", with the assumption of \\"image issues\\", but this dialog remains in place even after the change of the co-op characters to robots. The dialog written for GLaDOS in the co-operative campaign is aimed to try to break the bond between the two robot characters. Valve considered initially to have separate lines for GLaDOS that would be given to each player individually, but found this to be a significant effort for minimal benefit. The writers also attempted adding GLaDOS lines that would make the players attempt to compete against each other, such as the awarding of meaningless points, but playtesters did not respond well to these lines. The writers found they needed another character to play off of Cave during his recordings; instead of hiring a voice actor for a few lines, they economized by reusing McLain to play Caroline, Cave's assistant. This led naturally to providing a backstory for the creation of GLaDOS, who is revealed in-game to be based on Caroline's personality. This later led the writers to develop a full story arc for GLaDOS where she would come to recall her past, learn from it to solve the dilemma and then subsequently delete it and reset herself. The designers wanted to start GLaDOS' role in Portal 2 off with her being \\"incredibly upset at [Chell]\\". They felt however that this would \\"get old pretty quick\\" if they did not put her \\"into another space\\". They accomplished this through a combination of her anger with Wheatley and her conflict with her past life as Caroline. Through the course of the game's events, GLaDOS' personality shifts significantly; however, at the end, she resets her personality to her original personality, an action Wolpaw sums up as \\"explicitly reject[ing] it\\" and saying \\"You know what? Done.\\" While they wanted to give players the sense that they had defeated GLaDOS, they felt that they should not have players fight her as a boss battle; as a result, they had her let Chell go due to the reasoning that Chell was too difficult for her to handle. Writer Jay Pinkerton stated that GLaDOS was an exemplification of a villain who can go from \\"genuinely tender\\" to \\"genuinely villainous\\" and that \\"she‚Äôs not just this moustache-twirling villain\\". He also stated that she has a \\"passive-aggressive nature\\" and will never \\"overtly attack, it‚Äôs always these subtle mind games\\". The designers also intended to make it vague whether or not GLaDOS was under the control of the machine that she was attached to. Wolpaw also called her \\"passive aggressive\\" as well as \\"mildly sarcastic\\" and compared her to The Sopranos character Livia Soprano. Use in promotion As part of the alternate reality game related to Portal 2s announcement at the 2010 Game Developers Conference, Valve produced a blue screen of death which features GLaDOS' name in place of the Windows name. GLaDOS has been used several times for reveals in the Portal series. At E3 2008, GLaDOS' voice was utilized to reveal the Portal expansion Portal: Still Alive. She has also been used to show Portal 2 reveals; initially, a Blue Screen of Death image was used instead of a revelation of Portal 2, showing the typical text found in a blue screen of death, but with GLaDOS' name at the top. In the reveal of the PlayStation 3 version of Portal 2, GLaDOS' voice was used to introduce Gabe Newell, the co-founder of Valve at E3 2010, where he revealed Portal 2 for the PlayStation 3. Also available as iPad or Steam application. Portal 2s release was preceded by a collection of video games in a collection called Potato Sack, which featured thirteen independently developed games. These games were all a part of an alternate reality, based on a cryptic narrative that suggested the awakening and relaunch of GLaDOS. Valve provided the developers access to their art assets to include Portal 2-themed content into them, and in some cases, McLain recorded new dialog specifically for these games. The alternate reality game ultimately led to \\"GLaDOS@Home\\", a distributed computing spoof, which prompted players to play the independently developed games to awaken GLaDOS ahead of schedule, effectively promoting the Steam release of Portal 2 about 10 hours earlier than the official time. Cultural impact GLaDOS' popularity has led to merchandise being produced by both Valve and fans; a T-shirt depicting GLaDOS, as well as other elements from Portal, was made available for purchase on Valve's store while a fan produced a voice pack for a navigation system which uses GLaDOS' voice. Another fan also modeled and 3d printed a lamp using GLaDOS as the base form, complete with an LED eye and movement control, other creators have also added voice control, a speaker system, and an output system used to turn on and off various items, such as a PC, VR headset, and Room lights. A cosmetics vendor called \\"Geek Chic Cosmetics\\" features several video game-themed makeups, including one based on GLaDOS. Jonathan Coulton received significant attention for his composition of the credits song \\"Still Alive\\". The song \\"Still Alive\\" has garnered significant attention from fans and critics alike. It was released as a part of The Orange Box Official Soundtrack and appeared in other video games, including the Rock Band series and Left 4 Dead 2, the latter which was also released by Valve. The song has been performed in multiple venues by Jonathan Coulton which includes the Penny Arcade Expo in 2008, the Press Start -Symphony of Games- concert in 2009, and the Game Developers Conference in 2008. The song is popular for fans to perform covers of on YouTube. Ellen McLain voices a computer AI in Guillermo del Toro's 2013 film Pacific Rim; her voice work is deliberately similar to GLaDOS, a Valve- approved nod to the character and Portal series. When announcing McLain's addition to the cast, del Toro stated that he is a \\"big fan of Valve\\" and highlighted Portal and Left 4 Dead as \\"instrumental family experiences\\" in his home. Del Toro contacted Newell directly to secure McLain's voice, with his daughter's influence on the call helping to finalize the deal. McLain voiced GLaDOS for an episode of the IRrelevant Astronomy web series prepared by NASA employees working on the Spitzer Space Telescope. McLain also voiced GLaDOS for Multiplay's Insomnia Gaming Festival 55, providing narration for the \\"World Famous Pub Quiz\\" alongside Kevan Brighting as the narrator of The Stanley Parable. Reception and analysis Paste Magazine's Jason Killingsworth listed GLaDOS as the sixth best new character of the decade; he wrote that she \\"may just be the most likable villain in video-game history\\" and that \\"we only killed her because we had to\\". An editor for GamesRadar also called her one of the best new characters of the decade. Epic Games design director Cliff Bleszinski stated that he was motivated to complete test chambers in Portal. He also compared her to an ex-girlfriend who sent text messages that went from friendly, to aggressive, and finally to apologetic. GamesRadar's Justin Towell called her the third-most difficult game bad guy to kill due to Stockholm syndrome, a syndrome where hostages will bond with their captors. IGN editor Daemon Hatfield described GLaDOS as one of the most engaging characters to appear in a video game. Cinema Blend featured GLaDOS as the best character of 2007, stating that she \\"breathes life, emotion, and hilarity into the lab of Portal.\\" GamesRadar praised Portal as having one of the best video game stories ever, citing GLaDOS as the primary reason for this. They stated that she had the most defined personality in gaming, adding that she \\"redefined passive-aggressive\\". Shoot 'em up expert Michael Molinari cited GLaDOS as an example of a quality boss, stating that her quality stems from her appearing throughout the game, providing motivation as well as a satisfying pay-off at the end of the game. Editor Randy Smith commented that the battle with GLaDOS was \\"easy\\", commenting that it was \\"fun and fluid\\" rather than \\"annoyingly insurmountable\\". However, he added that it had an \\"air of epicness\\". Whereas Smith found the battle easy, UGO Networks Chris Littler included GLaDOS in his list of the 50 \\"Hardest Freakin' Boss Battles\\". UGO.com listed GLaDOS as one of their favorite video game robots. Awards GLaDOS has won several awards in 2007 for her role in Portal. IGN editor Hilary Goldstein awarded her the \\"Best of the Worst Guiding Voices\\", commenting that it was between her and BioShock character Atlas. However, he gave the award to GLaDOS, citing her humor as the prime reason. GameSpy awarded her the \\"Best Character\\" award, stating that she came from the most unexpected place ‚Äì a game that could have gotten by without a story. They added that during the final encounter, her mood swings provided some of the most memorable dialogue in video game history. X-Play similarly awarded her with the best new character award. GamePro awarded GLaDOS, referred to as \\"The Voice\\" in their article, the most memorable villain award, describing the decision as a surprise upset, considering either Frank Fontaine of BioShock or Saren of Mass Effect to win. GLaDOS has received other awards, including \\"best nemesis of 2007\\" from Primo Technology, best new character from GameSpot, and character of the year from Man!ac. Game Informer also highlighted GLaDOS in a 2010 retrospective list, \\"Thirty Characters Who Defined a Decade\\". Villainy and humor GLaDOS is frequently cited as both a quality villain and a quality computer character. IGN called her the greatest video game villain of all time, stating that while their time with her was short, she left a mark on players like no other villain has. They cited her uniqueness as being because no other players existed in the game. They also added she was more human than most video game villains. 1UP.com editor Scott Sharkey praised her as being the best insane video game computer. He stated that not only is she the best insane computer in video games, but in films and books as well. He explains his choice by citing her eagerness to kill the player-character, but not being overt about it until the end. He also cites her feminine voice and passive- aggressive manner for his decision. In another article, he mentions how he feels more sorry for her than any other enemy, describing her as a \\"digital version of the most passive-aggressive girlfriend ever\\". He adds that he can imagine it not being easy to be a super-intelligent computer trapped in a single building. Crave editor Rich Trenholm also regarded her highly, listing her as the fifth best evil computer. PC World editor Spandas Lui listed GLaDOS as the second most \\"big-time, badass video game villain\\", citing her various non-sequitur one-liners and personality for her becoming one of the most memorable video game villains ever. Pittsburgh Live editor Jessica Severs described GLaDOS as having the most entertaining villainy due to her promises of cake and her encouragements such as \\"This next test is impossible.\\" GameDaily listed her as the most horrific video game boss, describing her as \\"polite, passive-aggressive, and insanely sadistic\\". The review adds that while the game may be short, GLaDOS will \\"resonate with players long after players finish it\\". Game Informer considered GLaDOS the top defining video game character of the 2000s (decade), taking the archetype of the sentient computer in \\"surprising new directions, at turns slyly comic and malevolent\\", and that she remains \\"one of the most fascinating characters in game history\\". GLaDOS has received praise for her humor and wit. In his review of Portal, PC Gamer editor Tom Francis stated that he could hardly stop himself from laughing at GLaDOS' deranged writing. Similarly, GamesRadar editor Tom Francis described her as hysterical and being an aspect of Portal that gamers will love. Tom Francis called GLaDOS as one of the most badass boss fights in video games, citing both the hilarity of the character, with whom they state as the funniest video game villain since the Purple Tentacle from Day of the Tentacle, as well as the memorable quotes. PC Zone UK listed her as the second-best conceived character in gaming, commenting that the memes related to the Weighted Companion Cube and \\"the cake is a lie\\" could distract people from GLaDOS' \\"perfectly-metered and lyrical voice\\". He described her as the \\"humorous, clinical, savage and poignant heart of Portal\\". In a piece in The Observer, game theorist and author of Fun Inc Tom Chatfield listed GLaDOS as one of the ten best video game characters of all time, describing her as both as \\"gaming's funniest, freakiest female\\" and a \\"psychopathic artificial intelligence\\". The Observers Will Freeman wrote that GLaDOS \\"really is (in a rare case of living up to the hyperbole) one of the most fascinating characters in the history of the video game\\". The Academy of Interactive Arts & Sciences praised Portal for its \\"hint of comedy\\", citing GLaDOS' \\"humorous and homicidal\\" personality. Writer Lou Kesten, in discussing humor in video games, cited GLaDOS as possibly being the first time he discovered that video games could make him laugh out loud. The New York Times editor Charles Herold praised GLaDOS, calling her comments \\"wildly funny\\". In an article titled \\"The GLaDOS Effect - Can Antagonists Rule the World?\\", Gamasutra publisher Simon Carless describes her as the one true memorable character from Portal. He states that she is the reason he keeps returning to play Portal, describing her as funny, unexpected, and beguiling. The Daily Telegraphs Tom Hoggins wrote that GLaDOS \\"became one of gaming‚Äôs most compelling villains\\" and that \\"it managed to get people attached to an inanimate cube. It had the best end credits song of all time. It was funny, smart, fresh and managed to feel like the plucky, accidental hero\\". GameSpy's Nathan Meunier wrote that \\"without inhuman antagonist GLaDOS spewing a laugh-inducing tirade of thinly veiled threats in her deadpan robotic drone as you progress deeper into the bowels of Aperture Science, Portal would have been a very different game\\". GLaDOS' mocking of Chell was met with negative reception from Neal Stapel, an adoptive parent profiled by 1UP.com. He stated that \\"it literally pokes fun for not having parents\\", and stopped playing when he first heard the insult. He added that \\"it throws the ultimate question that that child is ever going to have for you... and it just throws it right in the living room.\\" Kotaku's Michael McWhertor felt that while it was \\"awkward\\" for the parents, the fact that GLaDOS was trying to kill Chell would be more upsetting. He also pointed out that \\"morons and the overweight are also mocked by robots\\" in Portal 2. 1UP.com's Chris Pereira found the joke \\"harmless\\". In Portal 2 GLaDOS' appearance in Portal 2 received critical acclaim. GameSpot's Chris Watters wrote that GLaDOS was a \\"complex character who evolves throughout these early levels\\" and that \\"before all is said and done, you'll once again come to cherish your relationship with that cruel AI\\". PALGN's Adam Ghiggino called Ellen McLain's portrayal of GLaDOS \\"hilariously blunt\\" due to her calling the player-character fat. He also wrote that GLaDOS has \\"a lot of emotion to [her] movement\\". The Guardians Nick Cowen wrote that GLaDOS was \\"by turns funny and monstrous\\". Computer and Video Game's Andy Robinson wrote that GLaDOS was \\"surely now deserving of entry into the Best Game Characters Ever club\\". He added that \\"GLaDOS' character progression is a joy to follow, as she progresses from bitter, to angry and eventually even finding a bit of heart\\". An editor for GameTrailers wrote that GLaDOS' \\"constant auto-tuned barbs are extremely well-written and voiced-helping lend some character to an otherwise spartan presentation\\". GameZone's Ben PerLee wrote that GLaDOS was the \\"much brighter star of the franchise\\" compared to Chell due to her role in Portal. He also wrote \\"the player‚Äôs interaction with her is absolutely amazing to watch. She is as vindictive and bitchy as ever, coating pure unadulterated hatred with a veneer of cool science\\" and that \\"for fans of GLaDOS, her return from her unfortunate death in the previous Portal is fabulous, and her literal transformation within the game will shock, wow, and humor even jaded gamers tired of cake quotes\\". PC Gamers Dan Stapleton wrote that \\"evil robot GLaDOS is in top politely murderous form right from the moment she appears on screen\\" and that \\"Portals show-stealing monotone antagonist is challenged for the spotlight by Wheatley\\". He compared her to Cave Johnson, who has a similar \\"comically sociopathic approach to science\\". Giant Bomb's Ryan Davis wrote \\"it would be charitable to characterize GLaDOS as indignantly sociopathic, and her lust for punishing you for your past transgressions is riper than ever\\". CNN's Larry Frum wrote that \\"GLaDOS' voice is dripping with sarcasm and malice even as her tone remains soothing and calm\\". PC Mags Matthew Murray called her voice actor \\"irreplaceable\\" and called GLaDOS \\"saucy and strangely sympathetic\\". An editor for CBS News wrote that \\"the interactions between the player, GLaDOS and Wheatley are what give \\"Portal 2\\" its charm and provide much of the humor that keeps the game captivating puzzle after puzzle\\". The Globe and Mails Chad Sepieha listed the top five insults from GLaDOS in Portal 2, which included \\"Science has now validated your birth mother‚Äôs decision to abandon you on a doorstep.\\" Rock Paper Shotgun's John Walker wrote that \\"Ellen McLain returns as GLaDOS, and is pushed so much further this time, hitting every single line with perfection\\". Game Informers Adam Biessener wrote that while Portal 2 was less quotable than its predecessor, \\"repeating GLaDOS lines stopped being funny a long time ago\\". He also wrote \\"I never once thought I'd place GLaDOS second on any list of \\"Portal\\" characters, but J.K. Simmons' character surpasses the malevolent AI even though she's as amusing as ever\\". Comparison to other characters in fiction GLaDOS has been compared to characters in fiction, including HAL 9000 from the film 2001: A Space Odyssey by LucasArts designer Noah Falstein. He wrote that GLaDOS was \\"more convincingly psychotic\\" than HAL and that her dialogue was not typical \\"like HAL['s]\\". Falstein described her as the best AI he had ever encountered ‚Äì \\"more convincingly psychotic than HAL, with a more emotionally engaging death than Floyd, and funnier than C-3PO and R2-D2.\\" The comparison was also made by other critics such as journalist Stephen Totilo and IGN's Cindy White. Totilo wrote that HAL was an influence on GLaDOS' \\"psychotic breakdown\\" seen near the end of the first Portal title. White wrote HAL and GLaDOS were similar due to both having \\"a calm, almost childlike, demeanor\\" which \\"hides nefarious intentions\\". She added that \\"the prospect of being shut down causes them to act out in deadly ways\\". GamesRadar editor Tyler Wilde stated that while the staff of GamesRadar loves GLaDOS, it makes no sense to insert a personality core into a robot. He suggested that the scientists either never read 2001: A Space Odyssey, or read it too much. Empire Online listed her as the 12th-best video game character of all time, describing her acts as \\"HAL-like conduct\\". Writer Stephen Totilo alluded the final battle with GLaDOS to the scene of David from 2001 disabling HAL, with both scenes involving de-evolving the respective characters. MSNBC game reviewer Blake Snow compared The Sign Painter from World of Goo to GLaDOS, due to the mischievousness and unseen nature of the character. GamesRadar editor Mikel Reparaz compared GLaDOS to SHODAN from the System Shock series and stated that before GLaDOS broke their hearts, they had SHODAN. GamesRadar's Alan Bradley named GLaDOS as one of gaming's most \\"malicious machines\\". He called her a \\"sort of spiritual successor\\" to SHODAN. However, PC Zone UK commented that the comparisons between GLaDOS and SHODAN run dry; while Portal leaves everything to the players' imagination, System Shock 2 has a strongly defined storyline. They do, however, describe her breakdown as hysterical, desperate, and hilariously childish, calling it the most finely controlled breakdown since Patrick Bateman's in the book American Psycho. The Daily Telegraph editors Nick Cowen and Tom Hoggins listed her as the ninth-greatest video game villain, stating that she is as diabolical as a female AI can get, mentioning SHODAN as being inferior in this respect. Writer N'Gai Croal commented that the boss battle with GLaDOS is similar to the \\"Room 19\\" encounter with Andrew Ryan from BioShock, citing the same use of tactical language and techniques between the two. In the book Extra Lives: Why Video Games Matter, Infinity Ward developer Michael Boon mentioned GLaDOS and BioShock character Andrew Ryan while discussing believable non-playable characters. He commented that while shooting games in general feature enemies as bullet magnets, both Andrew Ryan and GLaDOS do not provide an opportunity for players to shoot them. However, he adds that both characters end up defeating themselves, but in different ways. He stated that she was \\"so entertaining\\", but also that he wanted to kill her. The book's author Tom Bissell stated that in addition to these similarities, both were well written, describing them as \\"funny, strange, cruel, and alive.\\" Character analysis In his analysis of Portal, Daniel Johnson points out that \\"the larger chunk of Portals narrative exists in GLaDOS' dialogue\\", which tells \\"a metaphoric tale of a power struggle of identity roles within an institution\\". He discusses how the \\"backstage\\" of the institution is hinted at and gradually revealed through GLaDOS's slip-ups, from the momentary glitch during her initial instructions to the player (\\"the first flaw in the routine\\") to her ultimate abandonment of the formal language of the institution as she desperately pleads with the player to return to the testing area (the \\"front stage\\", where the institution's inner workings are supposedly hidden from view). Microsoft Game Studios developer Tom Abernathy, in discussing the importance of compelling characters in video games, praises Portal for giving its audience \\"room to do some imagination work\\" by inviting them to read between the lines to understand GLaDOS's motivations. His own interpretation is that GLaDOS is conflicted between her wants and needs, a conflict which ultimately \\"causes her to go crazy\\". Stephen Totilo notes the \\"artful way\\" in which GLaDOS's antagonistic character is slowly revealed and defined throughout Portal despite \\"little interactivity in how the story is told\\". Of his own reaction to that character development, he writes, \\"I wanted to hunt GLaDOS down, confront her for her lies, and break free of her clutches. I wanted this boss battle. I don't know if I ever have wanted a boss battle before.\\" Newsweek editor N'Gai Croal describes her as a \\"maternal, mischievous, malevolent and finally murderous unreliable narrator\\". Video game developer Nathan Frost describes Portal as an \\"exploration of a relationship with someone with narcissistic personality disorder\\". He adds that in order to fulfill her self-centered narcissistic desire to toy with someone, the player- character is trapped in the Enrichment Center, forced to do tricks for the computer. However, once the player-character becomes skilled enough to break the confines of the center, GLaDOS's secure amusement gives way to \\"histrionic, bipolar deportment\\". He describes this as a parallel to how a real-life narcissist might attempt to secure the admiration of another person by empowering them in some ways, but limiting them in others. He adds that this works out well for the narcissist until the other person learns to think and act for themselves. He concludes by saying that a part of Portals resonance comes from the fact that using the portal gun to escape the center is a \\"cogent metaphor for escaping an intimate relationship with someone diagnosably narcissistic\\". Grant Tavinor, author of The Art of Videogames, wrote that GLaDOS' actions and personality in Portal were \\"in the best of science fiction traditions\\" and describes her as \\"insincere, malfunctioning, and probably insane\\". Wendy Despain, author of Writing for Video Games Genres: from FPS to RPG used Portal as an example of a \\"modern classic\\" video game and \\"how they tell their stories\\". She called GLaDOS an \\"endlessly cheerful and clearly insane computer\\" and called her narrative \\"simple\\". Emily Short, creator of a female artificial intelligence character in the video game Galatea, speculates that in GLaDOS's final remarks to Chell (\\"No one likes you, you know\\"), \\"there is a hint that she‚Äôs talking about herself, not Chell; that she herself desires an emotional connection that she has never been able to achieve, because she also needs to survive, and all humans are a threat to her... [She has] learned that the humans view her as potentially threatening and essentially disposable, and so she has to see them the same way.\\" Scott Rogers, author of the book Level Up!: The Guide to Great Video Game Design, uses GLaDOS as an example of a \\"tormentor\\" boss character, stating that she taunts and challenges the players, but does not directly confront or attack them. Video game developer Andrew Doull describes the \\"unreliable narrator\\" as a narrative staple from more traditional media, stating that GLaDOS is the best example of this staple in gaming. He cites a scene in Portal where GLaDOS tells the player-character that the current puzzle is unsolvable, which turns out to be false. However, he comments that \\"it is still incredible to see the number of people who fail to read the situation, and proceed calmly to their death\\" in the incinerator when ordered to do so by GLaDOS; he uses this example to support an argument that the \\"unreliable narrator\\" narrative technique might not transfer readily to the gaming medium. Relationship to other characters Associate Professor of English at the University of Wisconsin-Stevens Point G. Christopher Williams discussed the relationship between GLaDOS and Chell. In response to a quote by designer Erik Wolpaw that read \\"we wanted you to have this very intimate connection with this AI that changes and evolves over time, leading up to the point that you betray her and do the most intimate act you can do with someone‚Äîmurdering them in cold blood\\", he at first noted that \\"on the face of it, this description of intimacy seems nonsensical\\", but also noted that \\"a changing and evolving relationship with someone in authority over you that eventually leads to betraying them by violating their rules‚Äîis one that is an altogether familiar one\\". He used the parent-child relationship as an example of this and cited a metaphor by psychologist Sigmund Freud which Williams said was about \\"murdering a parent in an effort to describe how children eventually would attempt to get out from under the wing of their parents\\". He wrote \\"nothing can be as intimate, perhaps, as loving someone enough to follow their rules and then needing to \\"kill them\\" in order to escape that \\"game,\\" which makes this game feel like something more like a really familiar relationship\\". He called her \\"just one of many countless authorities that have explained to me the rules of a game, how to control myself, and then pushed me towards a particular goal of the computer‚Äôs design\\" and that \\"this is an experience that I have every time that I fire up my Xbox and describes the curiously intimate relationship between player and gaming system that emerges in single player gameplay\\". He further discussed that he had no idea that Chell's name was Chell or that she was a female because he recognized the character as himself. He wrote \\"I cared about GLaDOS only because she was the one directing me. Oh, and then I really cared about her because she wanted to kill me\\". G. Christopher Williams also discussed the relationship between Wheatley and GLaDOS. His initial impression was that Wheatley, being an \\"utter moron\\" and attached to GLaDOS, was a political critique of the Presidency of George W. Bush. Namely, he thought that it would \\"be a way of paralleling the mythos surrounding the origins of the Bush-Cheney White House as an opportunity for the Republicans to regain control of the White House through a less intellectually apt figurehead and to thus control their domain through this weaker authority figure\\"; however, as he progressed, he saw nothing more to suggest that this was the intent. He added that the thought of this concept helped make him realize how Portal 2 \\"presents a fundamental conundrum that does exist surrounding competency and power\\". In contrast to this, he wrote that \\"an extremely smart leader can be about the most oppressive force in an organization has already been provided in abundance for anyone who has played the first Portal\\" and that \\"GLaDOS's \\"leadership\\" is the very definition of sadistic fascism\\". He also discussed the \\"lack of choice\\" for Chell, who is required to reinstate GLaDOS into her position to escape. He wrote that this lack of choice \\"manages to effectively maintain its position on the relationship between the everyman and systems of power\\". Williams also discussed the relationship between Caroline, the form she held before she became GLaDOS, and Cave Johnson. He wrote that the relationship of Caroline and Johnson fulfilled the \\"adage that \\"behind every good man is a good woman\\", since he depends on Caroline to fulfill the role of executing his directives as well as providing comfort and support for the man in charge, himself\\". He added that \\"while Johnson warns his listeners jokingly that 'pretty as a postcard' Caroline is off limits because 'She's married. To Science,' he may as well be simply warning off potential suitors for personal reasons\\" and wrote that \\"he is the \\"science\\" that she has married herself to\\". As a woman in video games G. Christopher Williams wrote that the addition of an \\"intelligence dampening sphere\\" performed by scientists on GLaDOS before the events of Portal could represent the \\"response from men to what they perceive as the 'misbehavior' or 'irrational thinking' of women\\". He also wrote \\"the effort to 'dampen' intelligence becomes a rather literal manifestation of the labeling of women as 'dumb' or 'irrational' and the need to control such 'poor' behavior\\"; he also cited how Wheatley was given a masculine voice to \\"remind her that she is dumb and to curb her tendency towards 'misbehavior'\\". IGN wrote that she \\"bucked\\" all of the stereotypes of a woman in video games and \\"became one of the most memorable and well-loved characters ever conceived\\". GamesRadar's Joe McNeilly wrote that Portal seemed like a \\"feminist critique of the FPS genre, flawlessly executed from within the margins it assails\\". He called her a \\"maternal female construct\\" and that while she was programmed to react \\"empathetically\\" to the player, she is incapable of feeling emotion. As a result, he felt that she \\"comes to represent man's attempt to construct an idealized mother figure through the cold logic of science\\". GameInformers Lix Lanier stated that no villain, male or female, has the charm of GLaDOS: \\"If she's not trying to kill Chell, she's likely belittling her with passive-aggressive comments that would make a sorority girl proud. Even with her robotic voice, it's clear that 'You look great by the way, very healthy' is no compliment.\\" GamePros Chris Holt discussed GLaDOS as an icon of feminism, and wrote that as opposed to being an \\"archetypal villain\\", she is a \\"prototypical bound woman\\". He added that \\"A female protagonist murdering a female villainess (or vice versa) is not what is interesting to us as critics, but it's the idea that despite her seemingly robotic, unemotional and unstoppable nature, GLaDOS appears vulnerable, sympathetic, and even a victim herself\\". He wrote \\"GLaDOS has been augmented because of the danger she presents to a presumably misogynistic society\\" and that \\"by destroying these cores, Chell is stripping her of the layers that society has deemed necessary for her to wear\\" and making her \\"far more dangerous\\". He added that Chell and GLaDOS serve as opposing sides of femininity; where Chell is \\"dutiful and does every task assigned of her\\", GLaDOS is \\"aggressive and seemingly dangerous to the order of a male-dominated society\\". He also described Chell as a \\"domestic icon\\" while he described GLaDOS as a \\"progressive, intelligent working woman\\" and that by killing her, \\"Chell can be seen as the dutiful 'safe' woman conquering the 'dangerous' feminist\\". He also cited the use of poems by Emily Dickinson, whom he compares to GLaDOS in how both were reclusive and were essentially disembodied voices. In discussing the lack of female heroes in video games, particularly in video games published by Activision, Gamasutra news director Leigh Alexander cited GLaDOS while arguing that the \\"females do not sell\\" notion is possibly false logic, stating that she was on the fast track to becoming one of gaming's most beloved characters. Gamasutra writers Leigh Alexander, Brandon Boyer, Simon Carless, and Christian Nutt listed GLaDOS as being the second-most affecting video game character, being the highest-ranked actual character because the most affecting video game character was the player. They attribute the overall quality of Portal to GLaDOS, stating that without her, Portal would not be nearly as quotable. They added that the relationship between GLaDOS and the player-character has been described as passive-aggressive, maternal, and a \\"feminist manifesto\\".

A Gorgon member of the Amazon nation, she is a love interest of Amadeus Cho. She first appeared in Incredible Hercules #121, and was created by Greg Pak, Fred Van Lente, and Clayton Henry. Fictional character biography In the classical age, the Amazons were engaged as mercenaries to battle an army of Gorgons. They were victorious, and took many Gorgons as prisoners, who gradually interbred with humans, and their genetic line continued within the Amazon nation.Incredible Hercules #122 Delphyne was assigned as a servant to Amazon Queen Hippolyta's daughter Princess Artume at a very young age. She became a highly respected general, fighting in the siege of Olympus against the armies of Amatsu-Mikaboshi.Incredible Hercules #123 When Princess Artume conceived of a scheme to depose her mother, locate the Omphalos and use it to remake the world in the Amazons' image, Delphyne joined her. They abducted Amadeus Cho (who they believed to be Hercules's eromenos) in order to convince him to help locate the Omphalos. Delphyne warned Cho that Artume was deceiving him (claiming to have sympathy for \\"small animals and morons\\"), but Cho ignored her advice initially. Eventually, however, he saw reason, and the two kissed. This was witnessed by Artume. As she explained later, she would have tolerated this but a displeasing farewell wave sealed her subordinates's fate. She attempted to murder Delphyne, but failed as a result of a lack of knowledge about Gorgon anatomy. Delphyne joined Cho, Hercules, and Athena in defeating Artume, and, in killing her, became the new Queen of the Amazons. Telling Cho that because of this she could not engage in a relationship with a man without killing him after consummation, she departed.Incredible Hercules #123-125 Vendetta Delphyne in her human form. Now queen, Delphyne subsequently joined Hera's alliance of New Olympians, with the goal of killing Hercules and Athena. This brought her face to face with Cho again, who was perplexed by her decision. Delphyne explained her desire to kill Athena in revenge for the original Gorgon curse, and warned him against trusting the goddess.Incredible Hercules #128 Later, when Hera attempted to kill her daughter Hebe in retaliation for Hebe's helping Hercules, Delphyne drew a gun on Hera, demanding that she cease.Incredible Hercules #129 Seeking the aid of Hephaestus, Delphyne had Athena's Aegis shield reforged into a helmet that granted her the abilities of the Medusa head within the shield. When the Avengers raided the headquarters of the Olympus Group, Delphyne attempted to confront Athena, despite Cho's entreaties to cease. She used the helmet to turn Athena into stone, which freed her from the Gorgon curse, appalling Cho.Incredible Hercules #139 Subsequently, however, she balked at allowing Hephaestus to kill Cho and Hercules, and Athena was revived by the arrival of Zeus' thunderbolt, conferring on Athena the leadership of the Pantheon, and returning Delphyne to her Gorgon appearance. For Delphyne's attempted deicide, she was sentenced to dwell forever in the bowels of the Olympus Group building.Incredible Hercules #140-141 Subsequently, upon Vali Halfling's capture of the Olympus Group headquarters, she escaped her cell. She found Athena weakened by Halfling's capture of the ambrosia of the gods, but was convinced not to kill Athena, and instead found herself allied with the goddess to repel the invaders. She defeated Pantheon member Atalanta in combat, and then joined Cho in defeating Vali Halfling himself and rescuing Hercules. The two then kissed and officially became a couple.Heroic Age: Prince of Power #1-4 Powers and abilities Delphyne is a skilled martial artist and combatant, capable of knocking over Hercules through effective application of technique, rather than through sheer strength. Unlike most Gorgons in fiction, she does not possess the ability to turn people to stone, something she says only flows through the line of Medusa Gorgon. However, she was able to circumvent this fault by having Hephaestus craft a helmet which drew upon her potential lineage inheritance. Delphyne's snake-like hair can inject victims with an incredibly deadly poison through their fangs, are strong enough to hold up all of her body weight without much effort and prehensile enough to manipulate the trigger of a firearm. Being cold-blooded she does not register on infrared scans, giving her an advantage in the dark.Heroic Age: Prince of Power #3 Other versions Secret Wars During the Secret Wars storyline, a version of Delphyne Gorgon from the Battleworld island nation of Arcadia is a student at the Victor von Doom Institute for Gifted Youths in Doomstadt. She is a member of the Night Witches alongside Jubilee of Limbo and Pixie of Mutopia.Runaways Vol. 4 #1 References External links * Delphyne Gorgon at Marvel Wiki * Delphyne Gorgon at Comic BookDatabase * Interview with Greg Pak and Fred Van Lente on upcoming stories Category:Marvel Comics martial artists Category:Marvel Comics supervillains Category:Marvel Comics superheroes Category:Fictional queens Category:Comics characters introduced in 2008 Category:Female supervillains Category:Characters created by Clayton Henry Category:Characters created by Greg Pak Category:Characters created by Fred Van Lente Category:Fictional amputees Category:Marvel Comics Amazons ","title":"Delphyne Gorgon"},{"id":"24102990","text":"Kummer (right) interviewing Mario Batali at the 3rd annual Food Summit in 2012 Corby Kummer (born July 25, 1957) is an American journalist who writes primarily about food.

from 1914 to 1969. Petersen played a major role as spokesmen for that party and as a promoter of the De Leonist version of Marxist theory in the 20th century. Biography Arnold Petersen was born in Odense, Denmark, the son of a tailor. After graduating college, he immigrated to the United States and worked in a paper box factory. In 1907, he joined the Socialist Labor Party. Daniel De Leon nominated Petersen to be national secretary a few months before his death in May 1914.

(The coat-of-arms pictured actually belonged to Bernard IV of Cabrera.) Fernando Ponce de Cabrera (fl. 1163‚Äì1200), called el Menor (\\"the younger\\"), was an important nobleman of the Kingdom of Le√≥n. Fernando was a younger son of Ponce de Cabrera, a Catalan baron who had emigrated to Le√≥n, and Mar√≠a Fern√°ndez, daughter of Fernando P√©rez de Traba and Sancha Gonz√°lez. Between 1161 and 1163 a Fernando Ponce was the alf√©rez (or signifer, standard-bearer) of Ferdinand II, but this was probably his elder brother of the same name, Fernando Ponce el Mayor. In 1163 Fernando Ponce made a donation to the Cathedral of Zamora and in 1164 to the Benedictine monstery of San Mart√≠n de Casta√±eda, though his later religious patronage would focus on the Cistercians. He made donations to their monasteries at Meira (1198) and Moreruela (1196), the latter founded by his father. On 4 August 1171 the two Fernando Ponces sold their land in Valdesalce to a certain Fern√°n Baldr√≠n. The first tenencias Fernando Ponce held were Melgar (1172‚Äì90), which he continued to hold throughout most of his career, and Allariz (1174), which he held but briefly. He was also briefly installed in the Limia in 1173, and he was re- installed as governor there on four later occasions: 1178‚Äì79, 1182‚Äì84, 1187, and 1195‚Äì96. In 1177 he was briefly sine terra (\\"without land\\"), but was installed in Lemos, which he held until 1180, and where he governed subsequently in 1187 and 1192. By April 1178 he had attained the rank of count (Latin: comes), the highest in the kingdom, and was charged with the tenencias of the Cabrera (1178‚Äì81) and Toro√±o (1178). Sometime before January 1183 Fernando married Estefan√≠a L√≥pez, daughter of Lope D√≠az I de Haro and Aldonza Rodr√≠guez. She gave him two sons, Fernando and Pedro. By 29 October 1200 the couple had separated, but she was still alive as late as July 1215.On that date Fernando referred to her as Stephania, comitissa, quondam uxore mea (\\"Estefan√≠a, countess, formerly my wife\\") in a donation to the Diocese of Zamora, cf. Barton (1997), 242 n3. In 1183 Fernando made donations to the Order of Calatrava and to the regular clergy of the Sar. In 1188 he was appointed majordomo by Ferdinand II, and he continued in that post under Alfonso IX as late as September 1189. This period, the final years of the reign of Ferdinand II and the early years of that of his son, corresponds to Fernando Ponce's maximum power and influence, when he held the large and important tenencias of Extremadura (1188‚Äì92), Salamanca (1189‚Äì90), Tierra de Campos (1186‚Äì93), Valladolid (1190), and Zamora (1176, 1188‚Äì92).A document of 1 January 1176 reads Fernandus Pontii dominans Zamoram (\\"Ferdinand son of Ponce lording it over Zamora\\"), indicating that \\"Ponce\\" was a patronymic. He also held Sanabria (1182‚Äì89), Mayorga (1186‚Äì87), Benavente (1186‚Äì89), and the Transierra (1188). Sanabria and Zamora had once been held by his father and passed on to his elder brother.Simon Barton (1992), \\"Two Catalan magnates in the courts of the kings of Le√≥n-Castile: The careers of Ponce de Cabrera and Ponce de Minerva re-examined\\", Journal of Medieval History, 18:3 (special issue), 233‚Äì66. Late in his career he briefly possessed Robledo (1198) and Valdemora (1198). In 1200 Fernando Ponce made a second donation to the Cathedral of Zamora, where his father was buried, his first in thirty-seven years. When he died not long thereafter he was buried in the abbey of Moreruela.Barton (1997), 204.

Life and career Helen Lemme was born Frances Helen Renfrow to Eva Craig and Lee Augustus Renfrow in Grinnell, Iowa, on February 25, 1904. She was the oldest of six children and worked as a housekeeper to help her family financially. As a student she once won an essay contest but was not given the gold medal prize because of her race. Lemme graduated from Grinnell High School, receiving a $5 gold coin scholarship. She began her university studies in 1923 at Fisk University in Nashville, Tennessee, but in 1925 moved to the University of Iowa, a state university, in Iowa City, where she studied science and biology and served as the president of the Delta Sigma Theta sorority. Her first position after graduation was as a teacher at Lander University in Greenwood, South Carolina. After one year she returned to Iowa City and on August 26, 1929, she married Allyn Lemme. She then accepted a teaching position at Alabama State Teachers College located in Montgomery, Alabama, which later became Alabama State College for Negroes, and is now Alabama State University. Lemme then returned to Iowa City with the intention of obtaining a master's degree but she was diverted and had a son, Lawrence, on July 31, 1931. She later had another son, Paul, in 1935. The Lemmes used their Iowa City home at 603 S. Capitol Street to provide room and board to African-American students at University of Iowa, who were not allowed to live in dormitories until 1946. Duke Ellington once played at one of her all-night house parties. Lemme devoted her life to the rights of African Americans and women, and she was an active member of the Democratic Party. She served as a precinct committeewoman, a delegate at state and county conventions, and member of the Democratic Party Black Caucus. She also advocated for greater representation of Black voters at the 1944 Democratic National Convention in Chicago. Locally, Lemme was involved in the Human Rights Commission and the Iowa City Area Council of Churches. She was elected President of the Iowa City League of Women Voters in 1946 and Iowa City Woman of the Year in 1955. A few years later, she was the first Black woman in Iowa City to be awarded the Best Citizen of the Year. Along the way, Lemme began work as a laboratory research technician in the Department of Internal Medicine. Lemme died on December 15, 1968, from smoke inhalation in a fire in her home. Legacy In 1970, a new elementary school in Iowa City was named Helen Lemme Elementary School in her honor.This school went on to become one of the best elementary schools in the city.\\"Helen Lemme Elementary School\\", Helen Lemme Book Club.\\"History of Our School\\", Lemme Elementary School website. In 1984, University of Iowa African- American graduate students founded the Helen Lemme Reading club, to serve as both a forum for African Americans to discuss literature by or about African Americans and a support group for African-American students living in a predominantly white community.

Corl (1914‚Äì1942) was a United States Navy officer killed in action in World War II who received the Navy Cross for his actions in combat. Biography Harry Lee Corl was born in Lambertville, Michigan, on 26 March 1914. He enlisted in the U.S. Navy on 20 November 1934 and was discharged in 1938. He enlisted again in 1939, rising to ensign by 15 June 1942. During the Battle of Midway, Corl was serving in Torpedo Squadron 3 operating from the aircraft carrier USS Yorktown (CV-5). On 4 June 1942, Corl was the pilot of one the squadron's Douglas TBD-1 Devastator torpedo bombers when the squadron made a nearly suicidal torpedo attack against the Imperial Japanese Navy aircraft carrier force. All but two of the squadron's planes were shot down during their torpedo runs; the two surviving Devastators, one of them Corls, both ditched in the sea on their way back to Yorktown, and Corl was one of only three men to survive the squadrons attack. In August 1942, Corl, flying with Torpedo Squadron 3 off of the aircraft carrier USS Enterprise (CV-6), was the pilot of a Grumman TBF Avenger torpedo bomber during the Battle of the Eastern Solomons. On 24 August 1942, he was flying a search mission near the Solomon Islands when he and another pilot spotted the Japanese heavy cruiser Tone. As they began a bombing run on her, two Japanese Mitsubishi A6M Zero fighters attacked the American planes, and were quickly joined by a third Zero. Under attack by two of the Japanese fighters, Corls Avenger was shot down. His radioman/turret gunner, Radioman Third Class Delmar D. Wiley, survived and, after 15 days in a life raft and months spent on islands behind Japanese lines, was recovered on 11 April 1943, but Corl apparently died in the crash of his plane. Corl was declared presumed dead on 25 August 1942. Awards Corl was awarded the Navy Cross for his actions at Midway on 4 June 1942. Namesake The U.S. Navy destroyer escort USS Harry L. Corl (DE-598) was named for Ensign Corl. During construction, she was converted into the high-speed transport USS Harry L. Corl (APD-108), and was in commission as such from 1945 to 1946.

The goal of HVAC design is to balance indoor environmental comfort with other factors such as installation cost, ease of maintenance, and energy efficiency. The discipline of HVAC includes a large number of specialized terms and acronyms, many of which are summarized in this glossary. : The hourly ventilation rate divided by the volume of a space. For perfectly mixed air or laminar flow spaces, this is equal to the number of times per hour that the volume the space is exchanged by mechanical and natural ventilation. Also called air change rate or air exchange rate. Abbreviated ACH or ac/hr. : An appliance, system, or mechanism designed to dehumidify and extract heat from an area. Usually this term is reserved for smaller self contained units such as a residential system. : A central unit consisting of a blower, heating and cooling elements, filter racks or chamber, dampers, humidifier, and other central equipment in direct contact with the airflow. This does not include the ductwork through the building. Abbreviated AH or AHU. : Any of several units of energy (heat) in the HVAC industry, each slightly more than 1 kJ. One BTU is the energy required to raise one pound of water one degree Fahrenheit, but the many different types of BTU are based on different interpretations of this ‚Äúdefinition‚Äù. In the United States the power of HVAC systems (the rate of cooling and dehumidifying or heating) is sometimes expressed in BTU/hour instead of watts. Abbreviated BTU or Btu. ::A centrifugal fan is a mechanical device for moving air or other gases. : A device that removes heat from a liquid via a vapor-compression or absorption refrigeration cycle. This cooled liquid flows through pipes in a building and passes through coils in air handlers, fan-coil units, or other systems, cooling and usually dehumidifying the air in the building. Chillers are of two types; air-cooled or water-cooled. Air-cooled chillers are usually outside and consist of condenser coils cooled by fan-driven air. Water-cooled chillers are usually inside a building, and heat from these chillers is carried by recirculating water to a heat sink such as an outdoor cooling tower. :Equipment that performs heat transfer to air when mounted inside an air handling unit or ductwork. It is heated or cooled by electrical means or by circulating liquid or steam within it. : A component in the basic refrigeration cycle that ejects or removes heat from the system. The condenser is the hot side of an air conditioner or heat pump. Condensers are heat exchangers, and can transfer heat to air or to an intermediate fluid (such as water or an aqueous solution of ethylene glycol) to carry heat to a distant sink, such as ground (earth sink), a body of water, or air (as with cooling towers). : A system designed to provide a constant air flow. This term is applied to HVAC systems that have variable supply-air temperature but constant air flow rates. Most residential forced-air systems are small CAV systems with on/off control. Abbreviated CAV. : A device that controls the operation of part or all of a system. It may simply turn a device on and off, or it may more subtly modulate the set point of components. Most controllers are automatic but have user input such as temperature set points, e.g. a thermostat. Controls may be analog or digital. : A plate or gate placed in a duct to control air flow by increasing friction in the duct. : The heat is rejected to deep lake regions to cool homes and offices, reducing the energy costs. :(Also delta T) a reference to a temperature difference. It is used to describe the difference in temperature of a heating or cooling medium as it enters and as it leaves a system. : Specialized housing for the air flow. :A dehumidifier is the equipment that extracts and removes humidity from the air. It works by cooling air to the point where water turns to liquid from vapor form and then the liquid is removed. :A diffuser is placed over ductwork, and it separates air with vanes going in differing directions. It evenly distributes air flow in the desired directions. :Dry bulb temperature is the temperature of air measured by a thermometer which is freely exposed to the air while it is shielded from radiation and moisture. It is usually thought of as air temperature, and it is the true thermodynamic temperature. It is a measurement of heat intensity independently of humidity and a dry bulb thermometer is used to measure it. :A dry bulb thermometer is a device that measures air temperature independently of humidity. It is freely exposed to the air it is measuring and is protected from the radiation and moisture. : An HVAC component that uses outside air, under suitable climate conditions, to reduce required mechanical cooling. When the outside air‚Äôs enthalpy is less than the required supply air during a call for cooling, an economizer allows a building‚Äôs mechanical ventilation system to use up to the maximum amount of outside air. : For a given sample of air, a measure of the total heat content (the sum of the heat energy of the dry air and heat energy of the water vapor within it). It is typically used to determine the amount of fresh outside air that can be added to recirculated air for the lowest cooling cost. : A component in the basic refrigeration cycle that absorbs or adds heat to the system. Evaporators can be used to absorb heat from air or from a liquid. The evaporator is the cold side of an air conditioner or heat pump. : A small terminal unit that is often composed of only a blower and a heating and/or cooling coil, as is often used in hotels, condominiums, or apartments. Abbreviated FCU. :A transfer of fluid volume per unit time. :Abbreviated FAF. :Fresh air fraction quantifies action of the economizer, and is defined by (Mass flow rate of fresh-air / Total air flow rate). Abbreviated faf. :An opening through which outside air is drawn into the building. This may be to replace air in the building that has been exhausted by the ventilation system, or to provide fresh air for combustion of fuel. Abbreviated FAI. : A component of an HVAC system that adds heat to air or an intermediate fluid by burning fuel (natural gas, oil, propane, butane, or other flammable substances) in a heat exchanger. :A gas furnace heat exchanger is responsible for the transfer of heat from inside the furnace into the air outside the furnace. The duct system then transfers this exchanged air to different rooms in the building or space. :A facing across a duct opening, often rectangular in shape, containing multiple parallel slots through which air may be delivered or withdrawn from a ventilated space. The grille directs the air flow in a particular direction and prevents the passage of large items. :A heating coil is the part of the system that conducts heat. It allows electricity to act as fire. :A heat exchanger is the part of the system that transfers heat from the hot parts of the machine or a system to the cold parts of the machine or system. :Terms for the amount of cooling (heat gain) or heating (heat loss) needed to maintain desired temperatures and humidities in controlled air. Regardless of how well- insulated and sealed a building is, buildings gain heat from sunlight, conduction through the walls, and internal heat sources such as people and electrical equipment. Buildings lose heat through conduction during cold weather. Engineers use heat load calculations to determine the HVAC needs of the space being cooled or heated. :A heat pump is a compressor that cycles hot or cold air. It is a device that is designed to move thermal energy in the opposite direction of heat flow by absorbing heat from a cold space which is released to a warmer space. :Heat transfer happens when heat moves from one area to another. It is an important and vital step in the process of cooling a space. :Heating Seasonal Performance Factor is the measurement of heat efficiency over the period of a heating season. : An industrial refrigerator is a refrigeration equipment designed for low-temperature processing of food products by creating and maintaining inside the object a specified operating cooling mode, including temperature, humidity, speed for the cooling environment, and sometimes may include pressure and gas composition. :A liquid or gas used to transfer heat between two heat exchangers. An intermediate fluid is used when the hot and cold fluids are too bulky (such as air) or difficult to handle (such as halocarbon refrigerant) to directly transfer the heat. :1. Components made of multiple smaller blades, sometimes adjustable, placed in ducts or duct entries to control the volume of air flow. When used inside of ducts, their function is similar to that of a damper, but they can be manufactured to fit larger openings than a single-piece damper. :2. Blades in a rectangular frame placed in doors or walls to permit the movement of air. :An air handler that conditions 100% outside air. Typically used in industrial or commercial settings, or in \\"once-through\\" (blower sections that only blow air one-way into the building), \\"low flow\\" (air handling systems that blow air at a low flow rate), or \\"primary-secondary\\" (air handling systems that have an air handler or rooftop unit connected to an add-on makeup unit or hood) commercial HVAC systems. Abbreviated MAU. :The lowest amount of fresh air flow that can be allowed into a recirculating system. This limit is set to ensure that the interior air remains safe and comfortable to breathe. :An automatic louver or damper that controls the fresh air flow into an air handler and modulates to the most energy efficient setting. :A measure of the air temperature outside a building. The temperature and humidity of air inside and outside the building are used in enthalpy calculations to determine when outside air can be used for free heating or cooling. Abbreviated OAT. :An air conditioner and heater combined into a single, electrically powered unit, typically installed through a wall and often found in hotels. Abbreviated PTAC. :Polyalkylene glycol is a synthetic oil used in A/C systems to lubricate the compressor. Most all newer model cars use PAG as the lubricant in the A/C system. : An air-handling unit, defined as either \\"recirculating\\" or \\"once- through\\" design, made specifically for outdoor installation. They most often include, internally, their own heating and cooling devices. Very common in some regions, particularly in single-story commercial buildings. Also called a rooftop unit (RTU) : An enclosed space inside a building or other structure, used for airflow. Often refers to the space between a dropped ceiling and the structural ceiling, or a raised floor and the hard floor. Distinct from ductwork as a plenum is part of the structure itself. Cable and piping within a plenum must be properly rated for its fire and smoke indices. See also: plenum chamber : The study of the behavior of air-water vapor mixtures. Water vapor plays an important role in energy transfer and human comfort in HVAC design. :Same as Air handler. :Usually metal panels suspended under the ceiling, insulated from the building structure. The primary cooling/heating agent temperature is close to the room's temperature. :A type of radiant heating system where the building floor contains channels or tubes through which hot fluids such as air or water are circulated. The whole floor is evenly heated. Thus, the room is heated from the bottom up. Radiant floor heating eliminates the draft and dust problems associated with forced air heating systems. :The transfer of heat directly from one surface to another (without heating the intermediate air acting as a transfer mechanism). : The SEER (Seasonal Energy Efficiency Ratio) rating of a unit is the cooling output during a typical cooling-season divided by the total electric energy input during the same period. The higher the unit's SEER rating the more energy efficient it is. :A damper or adjustable louver designed to augment the ventilation of a space during a fire. :A split system is the combination of an outdoor unit and an indoor unit. This is the most common type of system. :The number of degrees a vapor is above its boiling point at a specific pressure. :The condition where liquid refrigerant is colder than the minimum temperature required to keep it from boiling which would change it from a liquid to a gas phase. Subcooling is the difference between its saturation temperature and the actual liquid refrigerant temperature. :General term used to refer to the set or a subset of components that perform a specific HVAC function within a building. :A small component that contains a heating coil, cooling coil, automatic damper, or some combination of the three. Used to control the temperature of a single room. Abbreviated TU. :An individual space or group of neighboring indoor spaces that the HVAC designer expects will have similar thermal loads. Building codes may require zoning to save energy in commercial buildings. Zones are defined in the building to reduce the number of HVAC subsystems, and thus initial cost. For example, for perimeter offices, rather than one zone for each office, all offices facing west can be combined into one zone. Small residences typically have only one conditioned thermal zone, plus unconditioned spaces such as garages, attics, and crawlspaces, and basements. :A thermostat is a system that monitors and regulates a heating or cooling system. It can be used to set the desired temperature at which it keeps the environment either heated or cooled. :A two-stage air conditioner is designed to operate on high and low settings during different weather conditions and seasons. The high setting is used during extreme weather, and the low setting is used during moderate weather. This type of air conditioner produces a balanced temperature and is in use for a longer period of time. :A thermostatic expansion valve is a piece of equipment that meters the flow of liquid refrigerant into the evaporator while measuring the vapor refrigerant leaving the evaporator. It thereby controls the superheating at the outlet of the evaporator. : A method for providing ventilation and space conditioning by using the air plenum below a raised floor to distribute conditioned air through diffusers directly to the occupied zone. Abbreviated UFAD. :A unitary controller is a device that controls only one zone in a building. : An HVAC system that has a stable supply-air temperature, and varies the air flow rate to meet the temperature requirements. Compared to constant air volume systems, these systems conserve energy through lower fan speeds during times of lower temperature control demand. Most new commercial buildings have VAV systems. VAVs may be bypass type or pressure dependent. Pressure dependent type VAVs save energy while both types help in maintaining temperature of the zone that it feeds. Abbreviated VAV. :A zoning system sections a building or a space into zones which are controlled independently of each other. This is beneficial when different areas or rooms of a building have different temperatures as well as when the desired temperatures in different rooms are different. Temperature is controlled by different thermostats.

In the earliest account, Lycurgus was a priest of Nemean Zeus, while in later accounts he was a king of Nemea. When the army of the Seven against Thebes was passing through Nemea on its way to Thebes, Lycurgus' infant son Opheltes was killed by a serpent, through the negligence of his nursemaid Hypsipyle. The child's funeral games were said to have been the origin of the Nemean Games and Lycurgus' tomb was said to be in the grove of Nemean Zeus.Grimal, s.v. Lycurgus 3; Tripp, s.v. Lycurgus 3; Hard, pp. 318, 425, 426; Parada, s.v. Lycurgus 3; Smith, s.v. Lycurgus 4. Family According to Euripides, Lycurgus was from the Asopus river valley to west of Nemea, and he and his wife Euridice, were the parents of Opheltes.Gantz, p. 511; Collard and Cropp, p. 251; Euripides, Hypsipyle test. iiia (Hypothesis) [= P. Oxy. 2455 frs. 14-15, 3652 cols. i and ii.1-15] (Lycurgus as father), fr. 752h.26-28 (Lycurgus as priest of Zeus), fr. 757 (Eurydice as mother). Hyginus also has Eurydice as the mother of Opheltes,Hyginus, Fabulae 273.6. however Hyginus' Latin text has Opheltes' father being a king of Nemea named \\"Lycus\\",Hyginus, Fabulae 15, 74, 273.6. rather than Lycurgus--probably an error.Bravo III, p. 118; Smith and Trzaskoma, p. 189, note 15: \\"King Lycurgus: we hesitantly have restored Lycurgus for Lycus in the belief that it is an error of transmission and not a mistake on the part of Hyginus\\" (so also in Hyginus, Fabulae 74, and 273.6). The Latin poet Statius, following Euripides, has Lycurgus and Euridice as the parents of Opheltes, however for Statius, Lycurgus is from Argos, and is both the king of Nemea, and the priest of Zeus.Bravo III, p. 119; Statius, Thebaid 4.746-752 (father), 5.632-634 (mother), 5.715-716, 733 (king), 5.638-641, 5.643-644 (priest). According to Apollodorus, Opheltes' father Lycurgus was the son of Pheres, who was the son of Cretheus and the founder of Pherae in Thessaly. Pheres had another son Admetus. Lycurgus migrated to Nemea and married Eurydice (\\"or as some say Amphithea\\"), by whom he fathered Opheltes.Hard, pp. 425, 426; Parada, s.v. Lycurgus 3; Apollodorus, 1.9.14. Pausanias describes an image on the Amyclae throne of Apollo, which depicted Adrastus and Tydeus, two of the Seven against Thebes, stopping a fight between Amphiaraus, another of the Seven, and \\"Lycurgus the son of Pronax\\".Gantz, p. 511; Pausanias, 3.18.12. If this refers to an event during the Seven's stop at Nemea, then this would presumably mean that in some version of the story, Opheltes' father Lycurgus, was the son of Pronax, rather than the son of Pheres, as in Apollodorus' account.Gantz, pp. 511-512; Grimal, s.v. Lycurgus 3. However it is more likely that the Lycurgus in the scene described by Pausanias was different from the Lycurgus who was the father of Opheltes.Gantz, p. 512; Parada, s.vv. Lycurgus 3, Lycurgus 4 (treating the two as distinct). According to the scholia to Pindar's Nemean Odes, Adrastus' father Talaus had a son Pronax, and so too in Apollodorus, 1.9.13, which also mentions that Pronax had a son Lycurgus, which Apollodorus, 1.9.14 distinguishes from the Lycurgus who was the father of Opheltes. Sources Euripides The earliest mention of Lycurgus occurs in Euripides' partially preserved play Hypsipyle.Bravo III, p. 107. For the extant fragments of Euripides' play, with introduction and notes, see Collard and Cropp, pp. 250-321. Hypsipyle, the former queen of Lemnos and lover of Jason, has in Euripides' play, come to be a slave of Lycurgus, and nursemaid of Lycurgus and his wife Eurydice's infant son Opheltes.Gantz, p. 511; Collard and Cropp, p. 251; Euripides, Hypsipyle test. iiia (Hypothesis) [= P. Oxy. 2455 frs. 14-15, 3652 cols. i and ii.1-15] (Lycurgus as father), fr. 757 (Eurydice as mother), fr. 757.41-44 (Hypsipyle as nurse). The surviving fragments of the play contain only a few brief references to Lycurgus. In an early scene, Amphiaraus, one of the Seven against Thebes, having just arrived at Lycurgus' house in Nemean Zeus' sacred grove, asks Hypsipyle, whose house it is, and she answers:Euripides, Hypsipyle fr. 752h.20-28. :These are known as the wealthy halls of Lycurgus, who was chosen from all of Asopia to be the temple-keeper of our local Zeus. That is, Lycurgus is a priest of Nemean Zeus,Collard and Cropp, p. 275 n. 4; Bravo III, p. 107. from Asopia, a region of the Asopus river valley containing Phlius and located to the west of Nemea.Bravo III, p. 107. Although he is a king in later accounts, there is no indication of that in the surviving fragments of Euripides' play.Bravo III, p. 107. In a later scene we learn that Lycurgus is away,Euripides, Hypsipyle fr. 752e. and a fragmentary hypothesis of the play refers to guests of his household being \\"lodged with Lycurgus' wife\\",Euripides, Hypsipyle test. iiia (Hypothesis) [= P. Oxy. 2455 frs. 14-15, 3652 cols. i and ii.1-15]. further suggesting Lycurgus' absence.Bravo III, p. 107 with note 40. Hyginus Hyginus refers to Opheltes' story, in Fabulae 15, 74, and 273.Bravo III, p. 118; Hyginus, Fabulae 15, 74, 273. In all three, our received Latin text has \\"Lycus\\" as the name of Opheltes' father--however, this is probably a confusion of \\"Lycurgus\\", either originally by Hyginus, or perhaps more likely, in the transmission of the Latin text.Bravo III, p. 118; Smith and Trzaskoma, p. 189, note 15. And, unlike Euripides' account, in Hyginus' version of the story, he is a king, not a priest.Hyginus, Fabulae 15, 74. Hyginus also tells of an oracle--perhaps given to Lycurgus, although Hyginus does not say--that had warned that Opheltes should not be put on the ground until he had learned to walk.Hyginus, Fabulae 74. In contrast with Euripides' play, where it is the enraged mother Eurydice, to whom the Seven appeal on Hypsipyle's behalf, and who needs to be appeased, in Hyginus' account it is Lycurgus.Bravo III, p. 118; Hyginus, Fabulae 74. Statius The Latin poet Statius' epic poem, the Thebaid-- which tells the story of the Seven against Thebes-- also gives an account of Lycurgus' infant son Opheltes' death.Bravo III, p. 118. While only passing references to Lycurgus are found in earlier sources, he has a substantial role in Statius' version of the story. Here Lycurgus is the priest of Zeus (as in Euripides), and the king of Nemea (as in Hyginus).Bravo III, p. 119. For Lycurgus as the priest of Zeus, see Thebaid 5.638-641 (\\"Lycurgus ... at sacrifice ... offered portions to the unfriendly Thunderer\\"), and 5.643-644 (\\"temple and altars held him back\\"); for Lycurgus as king of Nemea, see 5.667 (\\"king\\"), 715-716 (\\"Lycurgus ... the king\\"), 719 (\\"king\\"), 733 (\\"ruler of Nemea\\"). While Euripides has Lycurgus coming from \\"Asopia\\", a region west of Nemea, for Statius Lycurgus is from Argos.Bravo III, p. 119. He refers to Lycurgus as \\"Inachian\\", i.e related to Inachus, the legendary first king of Argos,Statius, Thebaid 4.749. while Adrastus, the current king of Argos, and leader of the Seven, says of Lycurgus, \\"our ancestry is one\\".Statius, Thebaid 5.670. This raises the question why Lycurgus has not joined his fellow Archives in their war against Thebes, and in fact the hero Tydeus, one of the Seven, calls Lycurgus a \\"coward\\", saying \\"when your countrymen from every quarter have flocked to arms, you only amid the hurrying columns are at peace\\".Statius, Thebaid 5.676-678. However, Statius provides an explanation saying that Lycurgus' absence from the Seven's war with Thebes is due to priestly duties, and oracular warnings: :... taking no part in the Argive war; not that he lacked courage, but temple and altars held him back. Nor yet had the gods‚Äô oracle and warnings of old dropped from his mind, the word received from the depth of the shrine: 'Lycurgus, you shall give first death to the Dircaean [i.e. Theban] war.' Of that he is aware; the dust of Mars close by saddens him, he winces at the trumpets, and wishes the doomed army ill.Statius, Thebaid 5.643-649. Here the \\"first death\\" will turn out to be Lycurgus' son Opheltes. Passing through Nemea, on there way to Thebes, the Seven, in urgent need of water, encounter Hypsipyle with her nursling, the infant Opheltes.Bravo III, p. 119; Statius, Thebaid 4.730-745 (needing water), 4.746-749 (meeting Hypsipyle carrying Opheltes, \\"at her breast\\"), 4.778-779 (Hypsipyle describing herself as the \\"foster mother of a child entrusted to my care\\"). In her haste to provide water for the Seven, Hypsipyle leaves Opheltes lying on the ground, while she takes the Seven to a nearby spring.Bravo III, p. 120; Statius, Thebaid 4.785-789. Meanwhile, left unattended, Opheltes is killed by the serpent who guards Zeus' sacred grove.Bravo III, pp. 120-121; Statius, Thebaid 5.505-540. Unlike in Euripides' play, where it is Eurydice who must be restrained, here, as in Hyginus, it is Lycurgus.Bravo III, p. 121. When he hears of his son's death, Lycurgus flies into a rage, intending to kill Hypsipyle with his sword, but the Seven intervene to defend Hysipyle.Statius, Thebaid 5.653-679. A pitched battle between the Argives, and Lycurgus and his followers nearly breaks out, but finally Adrastus is able to calm both sides,Statius, Thebaid 5.691-703. and the seer Amphiaraus, another one of the Seven, is able to appease Lycurgus, by telling him that Ophelts's death was preordained by the gods, and that his son is now a god, and will be \\"accorded lasting honors\\".Statius, Thebaid 5.731-753. Apollodorus According to the mythographer Apollodorus, Lycurgus, the son of Pheres of Thessaly, migrated to Nemea, married Eurydice (or as he adds \\"some say, Amphithea\\") and fathered Opheltes.Apollodorus, 1.9.14. Apolodorus also gives a brief account of Opheltes' story, in which Lycurgus is only mentioned as being the king of Nemea and the owner of Opheltes' nurse Hypsipyle.Apollodorus, 3.6.4. Tomb The 2nd-century geographer, Pausanias, while describing the site of the Nemean Games, mentions seeing there the \\"tomb of Lycurgus, the father of Opheltes\\".Hard, p. 426; Pausanias, 2.15.3.

Plot Peasant Polikushka is as Tolstoy described him, \\"an insignificant man and a little flyblown\\", he is good-natured but weak-willed. He spends most of his time in a tavern, but can not find a meeting among minds even among the other regulars. He commits petty theft to buy vodka.

He feels that this could be the beginning of a new life for him. Arriving in the city Polikushka receives an envelope with the money which becomes a source of constant worry for him ‚Äì he is terribly afraid that something happens to the envelope.

For its resilience and year-round blooming quality, it was chosen on 15 April 1981 to represent Singapore's uniqueness and hybrid culture. History The orchid was known for a long time by its synonym Vanda Miss Joaquim. Ashkhen Hovakimian (Agnes Joaquim) hybridised this orchid which bears her name. It was recognised as a hybrid not only by orchid expert Henry Ridley in 1893 and again in 1896, but by other contemporary orchid growers as well as orchid journals including the Orchid Review. Sander's Complete List of Orchid Hybrids, which distinguished between natural and artificial hybrids, listed Vanda 'Miss Joaquim' as an artificial hybrid. Vanda 'Miss Joaquim' is a cross between the Burmese Vanda teres (now called Papilionanthe teres) and the Malayan Vanda hookeriana (now called Papilionanthe hookeriana). It was not known which of the two species produced the seeds and which one provided the pollen. The hybrid was shown to Henry Ridley, the director of the Singapore Botanic Gardens. Ridley examined it, had it sketched and sent a description to the Gardeners' Chronicle writing that: 'A few years ago Miss Joaquim, a lady residing in Singapore, well known for her success as a horticulturist, succeeded in crossing Vanda hookeriana Rchb. f., and V. teres, two plants cultivated in almost every garden in Singapore.' On 15 April 1981, Singapore Minister for Culture S. Dhanabalan proclaimed the species to be Singapore's national flower. DNA sequences from maternally inherited chloroplast DNA have been used to determine that the pod parent was P. teres var. andersonii and, by exclusion, the pollen parent is P. hookeriana. The scientific name as of 2019 is Papilionanthe Miss Joaquim, as both parent species are now placed in the genus Papilionanthe.RHS - Orchid details: Papilionanthe Miss Joaquim http://apps.rhs.org.uk/horticulturaldatabase/orchidregister/orchiddetails.asp?ID=70997 The Vanda Miss Joaquim is also the first registered plant hybrid from Singapore. Features It is a free flowering plant and each inflorescence can bear up to 12 buds, and usually 4 flower blossom at a time. Each flower measures 5 cm across and 6 cm tall. The petals are twisted such that the back surface faces the front like its parents. The two petals on the top and the top sepal are rosy-violet, while the 2 lateral sepals on the lower half are pale mauve. The large and board lip of the orchid which looks like a fan is colored violet-rose, and merges into a contrasting fiery orange that are finely spotted with dark purple center. Papilionanthe 'Miss Joaquim' is a robust sun loving plant that requires heavy fertilizing, vertical support to enable it to grow straight and tall along with free air movement and high humidity. It starts blossoming after its stem rises 40 to 50 cmSingapore Infopedia above the support. References *Arditti, J., and C. S. Hew. 2007. The origin of Vanda Miss Jaoquim. Pages 261‚Äì309 in K. M.

The Gayo tribe has a population of 336,856 and they live predominantly in the mountains. Most Gayo live in three regencies in Aceh namely Bener Meriah, Central Aceh, and Gayo Lues. Some of them live in several districts in other regencies, such as Serbejadi District, Simpang Jernih District, and Peunaron District in East Aceh Regency and Beutong District in Nagan Raya Regency. Other than that, the Gayo population also covers Southeast Aceh Regency and Aceh Tamiang Regency. Their homeland lies in the Barisan Mountains which has elevations of over 12,000 feet and extends more than one thousand miles. The Gayonese language has four dialects: Lut, Serbejadi-Lukup, Lut and Luwes. Their language does not have a writing system, but folk tales, stories and poetry are passed down in oral tradition. The traditional house of the Gayo is called Umah. History In the 11th century, the Linge Kingdom was established by the Gayo people during the reign of Sultan Makhdum Johan Berdaulat Mahmud Syah from the Perlak Sultanate, as it was told by two rulers who were ruling during the Dutch East Indies era; namely Raja Uyem and his son Raja Ranta, who is Raja Cik Bebesen, and also Zainuddin from the rulers of Kejurun Bukit. Raja Linge I is said to have four children. The eldest was his daughter, Empu Beru or Datu Beru, and the remaining are Sebayak Lingga (Ali Syah), Meurah Johan (Johan Syah) and Meurah Lingga (Malamsyah). Sebayak Lingga wandered off to Karo land and founded a country there and he was known as Raja Lingga Sibayak. Meurah Johan ventured on to Aceh Besar and established his kingdom by the name of Lam Krak or Lam Oeii or also known as Lamuri or Lamuri Sultanate. This would mean that the Lamuri Sultanate was founded by Meurah Johan, while Meurah Lingga who was living in Linge, Gayo and the rest became kings of Linge for generations. Meurah Silu migrated to Pasai and became an officer to the Pasai Sultanate there. Meurah Mege himself was buried in Wih Ni Rayang at the slopes of Keramil Paluh in Linge, Central Aceh, which until today it can still be found and are considered sacred by the locals. The cause of migrating was unknown. However, according to history, Raja Linge favoured his youngest son, Meurah Mege, causing the rest of his children to prefer to wander away. Linga dynasty * Adi Genali Raja Linge I in Gayo. ** Raja Sebayak Lingga became King of Karo in Karo land. ** Raja Merah Johan, founded the Lamuri Sultanate. ** Merah Silu, son of Merah Sinabung, founded Samudera Pasai Sultanate. * Raja Linge II also known as Marah Lingga in Gayo. * Raja Lingga III to XII in Gayo. * Raja Lingga XIII became Amir al-Harb of Aceh Sultanate. In 1533, the new Johor Empire was founded in pre-independence Malaysia led by Sultan Alauddin Mansyur Syah. Raja Lingga XIII was appointed to be in the cabinet of the new government. His descendants established the Lingga Sultanate in Lingga Island of the Riau Islands, and his sovereignty extended to Riau Province (Indonesia), Temasek (Singapore) and parts of Malaya (Malaysia). No documentation were recorded on the rulers of Sebayak Lingga Karo. During the era of Dutch East Indies, the monarchy was appointed again but for two eras only. * Raja Sendi Sibayak Lingga, as chosen by the Dutch East Indies. * Raja Kalilong Sibayak Lingga Dutch colonization After initial Dutch resistance, which many Gayonese and Dutch were killed, the Dutch occupied the area during 1904‚Äì1942. During this time, the Gayonese developed a thriving cash crop economy in vegetables and coffee. Since the Dutch colonization, the Gayonese have gained access to higher levels of education, and participated to some degree in the Islamization and modernization of their homeland. Surnames Korps Marechaussee te Voet during the so-called Gayo- Alas expedition of 1904 led by colonel G. C. E. van Daalen. Although it is not the practice of majority of Gayo society to have their surnames included, however there are a small group of them that still have their surnames attached to their given name especially those that are from Bebesen region. The purpose of the surname is only for them be identify and to be able to trace the individual's family lineage, thus it is not regarded as of great importance for the Gayo people.

It has four choices (from worst to best): leave the scale to keep searching, feed directly on the scale, use the scale as a host for a male A. melinus, or use the scale for a female A. melinus.

Early life John Leacroft born on 4 November 1888, the son of Dr John William Leacroft. He was educated at Aldenham School before going up to Pembroke College, Cambridge. He first joined the British Armed Forces when he was commissioned as a second lieutenant for service with the senior division of the University of Cambridge Officers' Training Corps on 3 February 1909, but he resigned this commission on 1 November the same year. World War I service Leacroft joined the Army Service Corps with the outbreak of war in 1914, and served with them in France and Egypt. He had been promoted to captain by the time he transferred to the Royal Flying Corps in 1915. Leacroft was originally posted as an observer with No. 14 Squadron RFC in Egypt in 1916. He saw action during the Senussi Uprising and the second Turkish attack on the Suez Canal as part of the Sinai and Palestine Campaign. After receiving pilot training he was appointed a Flying Officer on 20 March 1917, and posted to No. 19 Squadron RAF to fly Spad VIIs in May 1917, just as low-level ground attack sorties were being introduced in the lead up to the Battle of Messines. He scored his first victory on 17 June 1917. He tallied one each in July and August, and a double on 1 September to become an ace. By the end of the month he was a double ace. He had been appointed a Flight Commander on 22 July 1917. After four more triumphs in October, he was withdrawn from the front. Two of his October victories came in support of Allied troops during the Third Battle of Ypres, when on other occasions he carried a box of 25 lb bombs in his cockpit, as the Spad had no bomb racks. For these missions, he was awarded the Military Cross on 27 October 1918, the citation, published the following March, read: When he returned for another tour of duty in early 1918, 19 Squadron had become the first unit to be equipped with the new Sopwith Dolphin. The squadron returned to operations on 13 February 1918. There followed a period of teething problems with the new aircraft. To add to these difficulties, the Dolphins were attacked by fellow British pilots because the unfamiliar Dolphin was assumed to be German. Sopwith Dolphin. Leacroft flew this model for his final eight victories. Note the two upward tilted machine guns. Leacroft drove down two Albatros D.Vs on 15 March 1918 with his new aircraft. Then the Allied forces were faced with the German Spring Offensive. He followed his earlier March victories by burning a Pfalz D.III out of the air on 23 March; the following day saw another double victory by Leacroft. On 27 March he carried out a desperate ground attack mission against German troops using a road near Albert, Somme, this was quoted in the official British history, The War in the Air as an example of the tactics used to stop the offensive, and earned him a Bar to his MC, awarded on 22 June 1918. The citation read: Victories on 12 April and 2 May rounded out his list of wins. He had survived being shot down twice. In turn, he had destroyed ten enemy aircraft; two of those wins had been shared with other pilots. Leacroft had also driven down out of control a dozen opponents. He ranked second out of the 20 aces in his squadron. Many of his initial combats had come against members of Richthofen's Flying Circus. His Squadron Commander in 1918, E. R. \\"Toby\\" Pretyman, described him as \\"an outstanding pilot and the best flight commander on the Western Front in his time\\". He was presented with both his MC and Bar by King George V in an investiture at Buckingham Palace on 26 September 1918. Post World War I Leacroft had been granted a permanent commission in the Royal Air Force on its formation in 1918, and he continued his career after the war, taking the new RAF rank of flight lieutenant.

It was built in 1900, and housed not only the rail operations but a post office and general store for the small community it served. After falling vacant when traffic on the line declined and the rise of the automobile made the surrounding less dependent on the commercial operations and passenger rail service, it was restored in 1980. It is the only intact example of a rail station in the Pittsburgh area that served as a local commercial center. In 1982 it was listed on the National Register of Historic Places as Boyce Station. Building The T-shaped frame building on a concrete block foundation is two stories high and three bays wide, with a one-story addition on the southwest. It has a cross-gabled roof of seamed tin with a plain cornice. A porch runs the length of the front (east) facade. Its flat tin roof is supported by four square chamfered wood posts. Its deck is on brick piers. There is another, smaller porch of similar material in the northwest corner of the building. The windows and doors (in the middle of both stories) are all trimmed with flat boards and incised board with shallow pedimented top. The windows all have shutters. Inside, both stories have three rooms apiece, all of which retain many of their original features. The southwest addition contains an entrance foyer, bathroom and office. History It took several decades to build a rail line down the Chartiers Creek valley and connect Pittsburgh and Washington. Service between the two cities began in 1871 with mixed freight and passenger trains. During the next decade, coal, oil and gas extraction began in earnest in Washington County, driving up traffic on the line and forcing the railroad to start running separate freight and passenger service. The Pittsburgh, St. Louis and Cincinnati Railway, then the owners of the line, began to improve its facilities. By 1900, it was necessary to add a second track. The Boyce Station was built around this time. The rail business remained profitable until the mid-20th century, when trucking began to draw away freight traffic and automobiles travel became the preferred choice for travelers in Western Pennsylvania. The last passenger train stopped at Boyce in 1952. The line ultimately became property of the Penn Central, which neglected it as it fell into bankruptcy. The second track was eventually removed. Conrail took it over, and when that concern was dismantled by the federal government it eventually passed to its current owner, the Pittsburgh and Ohio Central Railroad, a short line operator. The station declined along with the railroad until 1980, when it was purchased by Roland Ramsay, a corporate psychologist who found it an ideal location for a new consulting business he had started.

The regiment was raised on 15 September 1967 at Ahmednagar by Lieutenant Colonel Niranjan Singh Cheema (ex Poona Horse) and was equipped with the indigenous Vijayanta tanks - the first regiment to be raised with indigenous tanks. The Regiment bid farewell to the Vijayanta tanks in June 1984 and was converted to T-72 tanks. The Regiment has had the privilege of serving with distinction in all the three armoured divisions of the Indian Army and a large number of other armoured/infantry formations including a high altitude tenure in Leh. Heraldry The Regiment has a fixed class composition as regards its sabre squadrons, with one squadron each of Sikhs, Dogras and Jats. The first Regimental Flag hoisted on raising had three vertical stripes coloured 'Red', 'Black' and 'Canary Yellow' signifying the regimental motto at that time ‚Äì \\"Through blood and darkness to the light beyond\\". The current Regiment Flag (as approved by Army HQ) has three vertical stripes coloured 'Black', 'Canary Yellow' and 'Black' with the Regiment badge in red colour embroidered in the centre stripe. The change in the colours led to a change in the Regiment Motto i.e., \\"Through darkness to the light beyond\\". The distinct and elegant Spearhead regimental badge was designed by Colonel CL Proudfoot. The Regiment is nicknamed The Spearhead because of the shape of badge and its pride in participation in major offensive exercises as the leading regiment of the armoured formations it then served in. Recognition The Regiment celebrated its Silver Jubilee in 1992 at Hissar and was the proud recipient of the \\"President's Standard\\" on 21 February 2014 at Bikaner in recognition of its dedicated service for over four decades. A formation of roaring tanks took part in the parade commanded by Colonel B Ravi, the 21st Commandant, on the occasion, as Army Chief General Bikram Singh bestowed the prestigious honour upon the regiment for its meritorious service since its raising.

Bounded quantification is an interaction of parametric polymorphism with subtyping. Bounded quantification has traditionally been studied in the functional setting of System F<:, but is available in modern object-oriented languages supporting parametric polymorphism (generics) such as Java, C# and Scala.  Overview  The purpose of bounded quantification is to allow for polymorphic functions to depend on some specific behaviour of objects instead of type inheritance. It assumes a record-based model for object classes, where every class member is a record element and all class members are named functions. Object attributes are represented as functions that take no argument and return an object. The specific behaviour is then some function name along with the types of the arguments and the return type. Bounded quantification allows to considers all objects with such a function. An example would be a polymorphic \`min\` function that considers all objects that are comparable to each other.  F-bounded quantification  F-bounded quantification or recursively bounded quantification, introduced in 1989, allows for more precise typing of functions that are applied on recursive types. A recursive type is one that includes a function that uses it as a type for some argument or its return value.F-bounded polymorphism for object- oriented programming. Canning, Cook, Hill, Olthof and Mitchell. http://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=99392  Example  This kind of type constraint can be expressed in Java with a generic interface. The following example demonstrates how to describe types that can be compared to each other and use this as typing information in polymorphic functions. The \`Test.min\` function uses simple bounded quantification and does not preserve the type of the assigned types, in contrast with the \`Test.Fmin\` function which uses F-bounded quantification. In mathematical notation, the types of the two functions are :min: ‚àÄ T, ‚àÄ S ‚äÜ {compareTo: T ‚Üí int}. S ‚Üí S ‚Üí S :Fmin: ‚àÄ T ‚äÜ Comparable[T]. T ‚Üí T ‚Üí T where :Comparable[T] = {compareTo: T ‚Üí int} interface Comparable { public int compareTo(T other); } class Integer implements Comparable { @Override public int compareTo(Integer other) { //... } } class String implements Comparable { @Override public int compareTo(String other) { //... } } class Test { public static void main(String[] args) { Comparable a = min(\\"cat\\", \\"dog\\"); Comparable b = min(new Integer(10), new Integer(3)); String str = Fmin(\\"cat\\", \\"dog\\"); Integer i = Fmin(new Integer(10), new Integer(3)); } public static ~~S min(S a, S b) { if (a.compareTo(b) <= 0) return a; else return b; } public static > T Fmin(T a, T b) { if (a.compareTo(b) <= 0) return a; else return b; } }  See also  * Covariance and contravariance (computer science) * Curiously recurring template pattern * Wildcard (Java)  Notes   References   Peter S.

History  The station was opened on September 7, 2008. The primary objective of the station was to improve the quality of weather forecasts and to study global processes of climate change. Work was carried out on environment monitoring, and research in the fields of meteorology, oceanology, glaciology, and aerology was carried out. The expedition consisted of 18 polar explorers, several dogs, and more than 150 tons of cargo. The station-master was Jury Katraev. NP-36 station settled down on a piece of sea ice that was approximately across. At the moment of disembarkation the station was in so-called to \\"the Hollow of submariners\\" between Wrangel island and the North Pole. The vessel Akademik Fyodorov carried out the delivery of the expedition to the ice. The station was removed with the nuclear icebreaker NS Yamal in the Arctic ocean at the end of August 2009. The evacuation of the station from the drifting ice floe took three days of continuous work. The chief of high-latitude arctic expeditions Vladimir Sokolov supervised the work.

Transmission Sneezing can transmit influenza. People who contract influenza are most infective between the second and third days after infection, and infectivity lasts for around ten days. Children are much more infectious than adults and shed virus from just before they develop symptoms until two weeks after infection. The transmission of influenza can be modeled mathematically, which helps predict how the virus will spread in a population. Influenza can be spread in three main ways: *by direct transmission (when an infected person sneezes mucus directly into the eyes, nose or mouth of another person); *the airborne route (when someone inhales the aerosols produced by an infected person coughing, sneezing or spitting); *through hand-to-eye, hand-to-nose, or hand-to-mouth transmission,Center for Disease Control and Prevention: \\"QUESTIONS & ANSWERS: Novel H1N1 Flu (Swine Flu) and You\\" Retrieved December 13, 2009 either from contaminated surfaces or from direct personal contact such as a hand-shake. The relative importance of these three modes of transmission is unclear, and they may all contribute to the spread of the virus. In the airborne route, the droplets that are small enough for people to inhale are 0.5 to 5 ¬µm in diameter and inhaling just one droplet might be enough to cause an infection. Although a single sneeze releases up to 40,000 droplets, most of these droplets are quite large and will quickly settle out of the air. How long influenza survives in airborne droplets seems to be influenced by the levels of humidity and UV radiation: with low humidity and a lack of sunlight in winter probably aiding its survival. As the influenza virus can persist outside of the body, it can also be transmitted by contaminated surfaces such as banknotes, doorknobs, light switches and other household items. The length of time the virus will persist on a surface varies, with the virus surviving for one to two days on hard, non-porous surfaces such as plastic or metal, for about fifteen minutes from dry paper tissues, and only five minutes on skin. However, if the virus is present in mucus, this can protect it for longer periods. Avian influenza viruses can survive indefinitely when frozen. p. 7 They are inactivated by heating to 56 ¬∞C (133 ¬∞F) for a minimum of 60 minutes, as well as by acids (at pH <2). Novel H1N1 According to the World Health Organization (WHO), the \\"main route of transmission of the pandemic influenza virus seems to be similar to seasonal influenza, via droplets that are expelled by speaking, sneezing or coughing.\\"World Health Organization: \\"What Can I Do?\\" Retrieved January 20, 2010 One of WHO's recommendations is to \\"keep your distance from people who show symptoms of influenza-like illness, such as coughing and sneezing (trying to maintain a distance of about 1 metre if possible).\\" Other WHO recommendations are listed below. The American Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) agrees that the \\"spread of novel H1N1 virus is thought to occur in the same way that seasonal flu spreads. Flu viruses are spread mainly from person to person through coughing or sneezing by people with influenza.\\" The CDC also says that a person may become infected if he or she touches something with flu viruses on it \\"and then touches his or her eyes, nose, or mouth.\\" Researchers have demonstrated anti-bodies against H1N1 variant influenza in 10 to 7 percent of workers and residents of swine farms in Jiangsu Province, China. Residents of a nearby city did not have detectable anti-bodies to H1N1 variant influenza. Prevention  Reasonably effective ways to reduce the transmission of influenza include good personal health and hygiene habits such as: not touching your eyes, nose or mouth; frequent hand washing (with soap and water, or with alcohol-based hand rubs); covering coughs and sneezes; avoiding close contact with sick people; and staying home yourself if you are sick. Avoiding spitting is also recommended. Although face masks might help prevent transmission when caring for the sick, there is mixed evidence on beneficial effects in the community. Smoking raises the risk of contracting influenza, as well as producing more severe disease symptoms. Thus, according to the laws of mathematical modelling of infectious diseases, smokers raise the exponential growth rates of influenza epidemics and may indirectly be responsible for a large percentage of influenza cases. Since influenza spreads through both aerosols and contact with contaminated surfaces, surface sanitizing may help prevent some infections. Alcohol is an effective sanitizer against influenza viruses, while quaternary ammonium compounds can be used with alcohol so that the sanitizing effect lasts for longer. In hospitals, quaternary ammonium compounds and bleach are used to sanitize rooms or equipment that have been occupied by patients with influenza symptoms. At home, this can be done effectively with a diluted chlorine bleach. Social distancing strategies used during past pandemics, such as closing schools, churches and theaters, slowed the spread of the virus but did not have a large effect on the overall death rate. It is uncertain if reducing public gatherings, by for example closing schools and workplaces, will reduce transmission since people with influenza may just be moved from one area to another; such measures would also be difficult to enforce and might be unpopular. When small numbers of people are infected, isolating the sick might reduce the risk of transmission. According to studies conducted in Australia and Japan, screening individuals for influenza symptoms at airports during the 2009 H1N1 outbreak was not an effective method of infection control.  Workplace  The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDCP) recommends that businesses promote and administer annual flu vaccination within the workplace. Additional measures include reducing potential for exposure through increasing awareness of flu symptoms, using good cough and sneeze etiquette, staying home when ill, and frequent hand washing. The Occupational Health and Safety Administration (OSHA) recommends these controls to employers to decrease transmission of influenza in the workplace: * Promotion, administration, and easy access to the flu vaccine * Encourage sick workers to stay home * Hand hygiene and cough etiquette * Use airborne infection isolation rooms, when appropriate * Ensure properly functioning heating, ventilation, and air conditioning (HVAC) systems * Limit transport of infected patients * Limit the number of staff who come in contact with flu patients * Provide personal protective equipment (PPE) such as gloves, gowns, masks, to health care staff as well as disposal facilities Specific occupations with increased risk of influenza infection include health care, education and child care, air line industry, and agricultural workers. Recommended behaviours ;WHO recommendations According to the WHO, you can decrease your chance of contracting the flu virus by taking the following steps: *Get yourself (or family members age 6 months and older) vaccinated against current strains of influenza, if possible. *Keep your distance from people who show symptoms of influenza-like illness, such as coughing and sneezing (trying to maintain a distance of about 1 metre if possible); *Clean your hands thoroughly with soap and water, or cleanse them with an alcohol-based hand rub on a regular basis (especially if touching surfaces that are potentially contaminated); *Avoid touching your mouth, nose and eyes as much as possible; *Reduce the time spent in crowded settings if possible; *Improve airflow in your living space by opening windows; *Practice good health habits (including adequate sleep, eating nutritious food, and keeping physically active) ;CDCP recommendations The CDCP lists these as important ways to lower the risk of transmission: *Cover the nose and mouth with a tissue when coughing or sneezing. Throw tissues in the trash after use; *Wash hands often with soap and water, especially after coughing or sneezing. Alcohol-based hand cleaners are also effective; *Avoid touching the eyes, nose, or mouth. Germs spread this way; *Try to avoid close contact with sick people; *Those sick with flu- like illness are recommended to stay home for at least 24 hours after their fever is gone, except to get medical care or for other necessities. (The fever should be gone without the use of a fever-reducing medicine.) The sickened are advised to keep away from others as much as possible to avoid making others sick.  Children  Watch for emergency warning signs that need urgent medical attention. These warning signs include: * Fast breathing or trouble breathing * Bluish or gray skin color * Not drinking enough fluids * Not urinating or no tears when crying * Severe or persistent vomiting * Not waking up or not interacting * Being so irritable that the child does not want to be held * Pain or pressure in the chest or abdomen * Sudden dizziness * Confusion * Flu-like symptoms improve but then return with fever and worse coughhttps://www.cdc.gov/h1n1flu/schools/toolkit/parentfactsheet3.htm Vaccination against H1N1 In the 2009 pandemic, the initial demand for vaccine greatly outstripped the supply. 2,500 people line up in a mall in Texas City, Texas to receive the H1N1 vaccine from the Galveston County Health Department. As the 2009 pandemic got underway, the first vaccine to become available in the United States by mid-October 2009 was about 2.2 million doses of the weakened live-virus nasal spray formulation. This form was not then recommended for some of the people who at highest risk of complications from flu, including pregnant women and people with asthma. The attenuated live virus was instead suggested to be used to allow some priority groups like health care workers and healthy children 2 or older, to allow them to be vaccinated immediately. Those to whom the weakened virus might pose a heightened risk were recommended to wait for the release of killed-virus vaccines, which followed weeks to months later. Vaccine uptake by the public was very low in the UK, but predicted by greater belief in the vaccine's efficacy and safety and a greater perceived risk of the disease. Public opinion A survey of Americans done in late June 2009 by the Harvard School of Public Health found that roughly 90% said they would be willing to avoid shopping malls, movie theaters, public transportation, and worship services for more than two weeks if health officials told them to. It also found that parents were worried about closures of schools or day care centers, with 43% saying they would lose pay or have money problems if they had to stay home a week or more because they were sick or had to care for someone. In the UK, the government established a National Pandemic Flu Service with a hotline and website, enabling persons with symptoms to get advice or obtain drugs without first getting a prescription from a doctor.  Increased risk of transmission for agriculture workers  Individuals with increased exposure to animals, especially birds and swine, are at increased risk of variant influenza infection. This includes agricultural workers, as well as residents of farms, individuals who keep swine and/or birds as pets, and animal exhibitors. Variant influenza viruses do not normally infect humans, but when they do cause human infection, the virus can be passed from animals to humans directly, or between humans. Due to human to human transmission, family and close contacts of agricultural workers are at increased risk of influenza as well. Unfortunately, there is also decreased access to health care in agricultural communities which makes prevention and response to influenza outbreaks more difficult. During the 2009 H1N1 pandemic, multiple factors were identified as increasing the vulnerability of agricultural workers and their communities. These factors included substandard housing, immigration status, scape-goating, economic barriers, communication and cultural barriers, and discrimination. Steege et al., found that 75% of agricultural workers were uninsured, making them less likely to receive the flu vaccine and less likely to seek care when ill. Public health recommendations for agricultural communities: * surveillance of agricultural workers * Inclusion of agricultural workers in prevention efforts and planning * Separating ICE from emergency services * Increased access to influenza vaccination * Risk reduction training (cough etiquette, etc.) * PPE use * Workplace Sanitation Recommendations for agricultural workers and exhibitors: * Influenza vaccination * Limit time swine are kept on the fairgrounds to no more than 72 hours * Wash hands with soap and water when leaving the barn * Restrict food and drink in animal area * Do not sleep in animal areas Additional recommendations for visitors to agricultural exhibits: * High Risk: ** Defined as people younger than 5 years, older than 65 years, pregnant women, and people with chronic illnesses. ** Avoid pigs and swine barns * Low Risk: ** Don't eat, drink, or apply anything to your mouth in pig areas ** Don't take toys, pacifiers, cups, baby bottles, strollers, or similar items into pig areas ** Avoid close contact with pigs that look or act ill ** Use gloves, protective clothing, masks if contact with ill pigs ** Wash your hands often with soap and running water before and after exposure to pigs. If soap and water are not available, use an alcohol-based hand rub. ** Watch your pig(s) for signs of illness. Call a veterinarian if you suspect illness. ** Avoid contact with pigs if you have flu symptoms. Wait until you have been fever- free for 7 days or until you have been without fever for 24 hours without taking temperature-reducing medications; whichever is longer ** If you become ill, contact a health care provider. Let them know you are higher risk and about any recent exposure to pigs or swine barns. The same medications that are used for seasonal flu can be used for variant virus infection.

Finally, Asterios must not only confront his own flawed nature, but the implacable and amoral whims of the gods themselves. Themes Mazzucchelli sketching the titular character in a fan's copy of the book at a June 2012 signing at Midtown Comics in Manhattan. In plot, structure, and design, this book explores the idea of duality. Some of the false dichotomies touched upon are: Apollonian vs. Dionysian; reason vs. emotion; destiny vs. free will; and nature vs. nurture. Ultimately, the book raises questions about how a person becomes who and what he is. Asterios' Greek heritage is one of many allusions to the story of Orpheus and Euridice, a recurring theme throughout the book. It can also be related to the Odyssey, upon which the story is loosely based. Publication Asterios Polyp grew out of a story idea that would have filled the entire fourth issue of Rubber Blanket. It was published as a hardcover, with an architectonic design that alluded to themes of form and function within the text, including a dust jacket shorter than the size of the book that revealed the structure underneath. Questioned about the impracticality of his design, Mazzucchelli joked that it was \\"the most frustrating package [I] could come up with\\". Reception The book has sold over 40,000 copies since its publication in July 2009; it is now in its sixth printing. It won the first Los Angeles Times Book Prize Graphic Novel award. It received four 2010 Eisner Award nominations and won for best new graphic album, best writer/artist and best lettering. It also won three 2010 Harvey Awards.2010 Harvey Award winners, www.comicsbeat.com, 30 August 2010 It is often considered to be among the greatest graphic novels ever written. Prominent reviewer GoodOKBad gave it a perfect 3-star rating and later acknowledged it as one of the 10 greatest graphic novels ever written.

Celebrated on 27 April (26 April if the 27th is a Sunday), the date marks the birth of King Willem-Alexander. Until the abdication of Queen Beatrix in 2013, the holiday was known as Koninginnedag () or Queen's Day and was celebrated on 30 April. The holiday was initially observed on 31 August 1885 as Prinsessedag or Princess's Day, the fifth birthday of Princess Wilhelmina, then heir presumptive to the Dutch throne. On her accession in November 1890 the holiday acquired the name Koninginnedag, first celebrated on 31 August 1891. In September 1948, Wilhelmina's daughter Juliana ascended to the throne and the holiday was moved to her birthday, 30 April. The holiday was celebrated on this date from 1949. Juliana's daughter, Beatrix, retained the celebration on 30 April after she ascended the throne in 1980, though her birthday was on 31 January. Beatrix altered her mother's custom of receiving a floral parade at Soestdijk Palace, instead choosing to visit different Dutch towns each year and join in the festivities with her children. In 2009, the Queen was celebrating Queen's Day in the city of Apeldoorn when a man attempted to attack her by trying to ram the royal family's bus with his car; instead he drove into a crowd of people and crashed into a monument: seven people in the crowd were killed, as was the driver. Queen Beatrix abdicated on Koninginnedag 2013, and her son, Willem-Alexander, ascended the throne (the first king since the observance of the national holiday). As a result, the holiday became known as Koningsdag from 2014 on, and the celebration was moved three days ahead to 27 April, the King's birthday. Koningsdag is known for its nationwide vrijmarkt (\\"free market\\"), at which the Dutch sell their used items. It is also an opportunity for \\"orange madness\\" or oranjegekte, a kind of frenzy named for the national colour. History Wilhelmina (1885‚Äì1948) Koninginnedag on 31 August 1932 in Amsterdam Faced with an unpopular monarchy, in the 1880s the liberals in Dutch government sought a means of promoting national unity. King William III was disliked, but his four-year-old daughter Princess Wilhelmina was not. A holiday honouring King William had been intermittently held on his birthday, and J. W. R. Gerlach, editor of the newspaper Utrechts Provinciaal en Stedelijk Dagblad, proposed that the princess's birthday be observed as an opportunity for patriotic celebration and national reconciliation. Prinsessedag or Princess's Day was first celebrated in the Netherlands on 31 August 1885, Wilhelmina's fifth birthday. The young princess was paraded through the streets, waving to the crowds. The first observance occurred only in Utrecht, but other municipalities quickly began to observe it, organizing activities for children. Further processions were held in the following years, and when Wilhelmina inherited the throne in 1890, Prinsessedag was renamed Koninginnedag, or Queen's Day. By then almost every Dutch town and city was marking the holiday. The celebration proved popular, and when the Queen came of age in 1898, her inauguration was postponed a week to 6 September so as not to interfere with Koninginnedag. The annual holiday fell on the final day of school summer vacation, which made it popular among schoolchildren. It is uncertain how much Wilhelmina enjoyed the festivities; although writer Mike Peek, in a 2011 magazine article about Koninginnedag, suggests she was enthusiastic, there is a story of Wilhelmina, after a tired return from one of these birthday processions, making her doll bow until the toy's hair was dishevelled, and telling it, \\"Now you shall sit in a carriage and bow until your back aches, and see how much you like being a Queen!\\" Koninginnedag 1902 not only honoured the Queen's birthday, but was celebrated with increased enthusiasm as it marked her recovery from serious illness. Wilhelmina rarely attended Koninginnedag festivities after reaching adulthood. She attended ceremonies for her silver jubilee in 1923, which included massive festivities in Amsterdam and The Hague, despite the Queen's request that large sums not be spent because economic conditions at the time were difficult. To ensure that even the poorer parts of the city were included, bands played simultaneously at 28 locations across The Hague. Wilhelmina made further exceptions for such events as her fiftieth birthday in 1930. During the German occupation of the Netherlands during World War II, Koninginnedag celebrations were banned, and members of the Orange Committees, which organize the holiday events, destroyed their records for fear of German reprisals. Juliana (1948‚Äì1980) Military parade in Arnhem, Koninginnedag 1958 Another summertime birthday celebration in the Netherlands was that of Wilhelmina's mother, Queen-Regent Emma, who after Wilhelmina attained adulthood generally spent her own birthday, 2 August, at Soestdijk Palace in Baarn. Until her death in 1934, Emma received an annual floral tribute from the townsfolk on her birthday. In 1937 Wilhelmina's daughter and heiress, Princess Juliana, took up residence at Soestdijk Palace following her marriage, and the townsfolk made their floral presentation to her, moving the date to Juliana's birthday, 30 April. In September 1948 Juliana ascended to the Dutch throne and from 1949 onwards Koninginnedag was on her birthday. The change in date attracted immediate approval from Dutch children, who gained an extra day of holiday. The first observance of the holiday on the new date included a huge circus at the Amsterdam Olympic Stadium‚Äîone not attended by the royal family, who remained at Soestdijk Palace. Queen Juliana retained the floral tribute, staying each year on Koninginnedag at Soestdijk Palace to receive it. The parade became televised in the 1950s, and Koninginnedag increasingly became a national holiday, with workers given the day off. Juliana had a reputation as a \\"queen of the people\\", and according to Peek, \\"it felt as if she invited her subjects to the royal home\\". In early 1966 Juliana's eldest daughter, Princess Beatrix, married Klaus-Georg von Amsberg. The marriage was controversial because the new Prince Claus (as he was dubbed) was a German, and Claus himself had served in the German Army during the war. Anti-German riots in Amsterdam marred the wedding day and the following observances of Koninginnedag. Fearing further demonstrations on the holiday, government officials decided to open Amsterdam city centre to the vrijmarkt (\\"free market\\") that had long been held on Koninginnedag in the outskirts of town, principally for children. The vrijmarkt occupied the space where demonstrations might have been held, and began a new custom. Beatrix (1980‚Äì2013) Queen Beatrix speaks with the mayor of The Hague, Wim Deetman in Scheveningen, Koninginnedag 2005. When Queen Beatrix succeeded her mother Juliana on the latter's abdication on 30 April 1980, the new queen decided to keep the holiday on 30 April as a tribute to her mother. (If 30 April fell on a Sunday, Koninginnedag was observed the previous day‚Äîthis occurred most recently in 2006.) The reason was practical as well‚ÄîBeatrix's actual birthday on 31 January would have been less conducive to the traditional outdoor activities. Rather than remaining at the palace and letting the Dutch people come to her, Beatrix instead usually visited two towns each year for Koninginnedag celebrations. Local crafts and customs were demonstrated for the royal family, who had the opportunity to join in. Koninginnedag celebrations have sometimes been affected or disrupted. In 1988 three British servicemen stationed in Germany who were in the Netherlands for Koninginnedag were killed in Irish Republican Army attacks. In 1996 the celebrations in Rotterdam were dampened by an alcohol ban, put in place following riots earlier in the week after local football club Feyenoord won the Dutch league championship. The Queen's scheduled 2001 visits to Hoogeveen and Meppel were postponed for one year owing to an outbreak of foot-and-mouth disease. On 30 April 2009, Beatrix and other members of the royal family were at the town of Apeldoorn when a 38-year-old man, Karst Tates, drove his Suzuki Swift automobile into the crowd, narrowly missing the open-top bus the royal family members were riding on. Seven people were killed and further celebrations were cancelled. Tates died of injuries sustained in the attack soon afterwards and his exact motives remain unclear, though it appears his target was the royal family. The incident provoked questions about whether the royal family should continue to participate in the celebrations. However, Beatrix indicated that the tragedy would not stop her from meeting her people. In 2010, Beatrix and her family visited Wemeldinge and Middelburg, in Zeeland province. There were no incidents, and afterwards, the Queen thanked Zeeland for giving Koninginnedag back to her family, and to her country. Queen Beatrix and her son and heir Willem-Alexander, Prince of Orange (waving) visit Woudrichem in 2007 Queen Beatrix visited the following towns and cities over the years on Koninginnedag: On 28 January 2013 Queen Beatrix announced her abdication on 30 April 2013 in favour of her son, Willem-Alexander. Since this date coincided with Koninginnedag the royal family's planned visit to De Rijp and Amstelveen was cancelled, although Koninginnedag 2013 was still celebrated throughout the country. Willem-Alexander King Willem-Alexander, Queen Maxima and Princess Beatrix during the celebration of Koningsdag 2014 in De Rijp Waterland's Koningsdag bike race (2015) On 30 April 2013, Queen's Day, Willem-Alexander succeeded his mother Beatrix and became the first King of the Netherlands in 123 years. Consequently, from 2014 onwards the name has been changed from Queen's Day to King's Day. The date has also changed from 30 to 27 April, which is the birthday of Willem-Alexander. On the first King's Day ‚Äì held on 26 April 2014 because 27 April 2014 was a Sunday ‚Äì the king visited De Rijp and Amstelveen (originally planned to be visited by Queen Beatrix in 2013, but postponed due to her abdication). King Willem-Alexander visited the following towns and cities over the years on Koningsdag: Due to the coronavirus pandemic, many King's day celebrations were cancelled in 2020, including the royal family's planned visit to Maastricht. An alternative stay- at-home program was issued instead, featuring a simultaneous national anthem sing-along and a national toast moment. The King addressed the Dutch people from his home. Activities The festivities on Koningsdag are often organised by Orange Committees (Dutch: Oranjecomit√©), local associations that seek sponsorship and donations for their activities. In recent years some committees have had difficulty in recruiting new members from among the younger Dutch.. Flea market Vrijmarkt, Koninginnedag 2011, Deventer The vrijmarkt (literally 'free market') is a nationwide flea market, at which many people sell their used goods. Koningsdag is the one day of the year that the Dutch government permits sales on the street without a permit and without the payment of value added tax. ING Bank found in 2011 that one in five Dutch residents planned to sell at the vrijmarkt and estimated they would earn ‚Ç¨100 per person for a total turnover of ‚Ç¨290 million. Over half of the Dutch people buy at the vrijmarkt; ING Bank predicted they would spend ‚Ç¨28 each at the 2011 vrijmarkt. Queen Beatrix has been known to buy at the vrijmarkt; in 1995 she purchased a floor lamp. The bank also forecast that the lowest level of sales at the vrijmarkt in 2011 would be in the province of Limburg, site of Queen Beatrix's visit. Among the most popular areas for the vrijmarkt in Amsterdam is the Jordaan quarter, but the wide Apollolaan in front of the Hilton hotel in southern Amsterdam is gaining in popularity. Children sell their cast-off toys or garments at the Vondelpark, also in southern Amsterdam, and in a spirit of fun passers-by often offer the young sellers more than they are asking for the goods. Until 1996, the vrijmarkt began the evening before and continued for 24 hours. This was ended in the hope of gaining a pause in the celebrations so preparations could be made for the daytime activities. Utrecht, uniquely among Dutch municipalities, retains the overnight vrijmarkt. In 2020, people can sell their goods on an online platform to avoid physical contact with customers. Festivities Koningsdag now sees large-scale celebrations, with many concerts and special events in public spaces, particularly in Amsterdam. An outdoor concert is held on Amsterdam's Museumplein, where as many as 800,000 people may gather. To aid visitors in returning home by train after the festivities outdoor events must end by 20:00, and the Museumplein show by 21:00. The city centre is closed to cars, and no trams ride in the heart of the city; people are urged to avoid Amsterdam Centraal railway station and use other stations if possible from their direction. International trains that normally begin or terminate at Amsterdam Centraal are instead directed to a suburban stop. Leaf in The Hague during Koninginnenacht in 2008 Revellers dressed in orange in Amsterdam, Koninginnedag 2007 In recent years parties and concerts have been held the evening before Koningsdag. Until 2013, nightclubs across the Netherlands organised special events for what became known as Koninginnenacht (Queen's Night). Many young people celebrate in the streets and squares (and in Amsterdam, the canals as well) throughout the night, and after all-night partying join the crowds at the vrijmarkt. While King's Day celebrations take place throughout the Netherlands, Amsterdam is a popular destination for many revellers. Often the city's 850,000 residents are joined by up to 1 million visitors. In recent years Amsterdam authorities have taken some measures to try to stem the flow of visitors as the city became too crowded. Those taking part in Koningsdag commonly dye their hair orange or wear orange clothing in honour of the House of Orange-Nassau, which rules over the Netherlands. Orange-coloured drinks are also popular. This colour choice is sometimes dubbed \\"orange madness\\", or in Dutch, oranjegekte. A local Orange Committee member said of Koninginnedag in 2011: > Friendships‚Äîand community‚Äîwill be formed. For me that's really what Queen's > Day is all about. It's not an outburst of patriotism, it's not even about > the popularity of the royal family. It's about a sense of belonging. For one > day, everybody is the same in Holland. Bright orange and barmy. Children celebrate with a variety of games including koekhappen (in which they catch spice cake dangling from a string in their mouths) and spijker poepen (in which they tie string around their waist a nail dangling at one end, which they attempt to lower into a glass bottle). Honours Koningsdag is an opportunity for the monarch to honour citizens for their service to the Netherlands. In 2011, Queen Beatrix issued an honours list noting the work of 3,357 people, most of whom became members of the Order of Orange-Nassau. Observance in Dutch territories outside Europe Koningsdag is also celebrated in Aruba, Cura√ßao, and Sint Maarten, constituent countries of the Kingdom of the Netherlands. It is less widely celebrated on the Caribbean island of Bonaire, also a part of the Kingdom, where the local celebration of Dia di Rincon (held on 30 April) is more popular.

It is one of two high schools in Ayr, the other being Burdekin Catholic High School. Ayr State High School was designed by Department of Public Works (Queensland) and built from 1935 to 1937. It was also known as Ayr State High and Intermediate School. It was added to the Queensland Heritage Register on 13 January 1995. Facilities The school has eleven buildings, including a fifty-seat auditorium and a multi-purpose shelter with a capacity of well over seven hundred for the school's 500 students. In 2012 all students were given the chance to be issued with a take home laptop. Staff The school is run by Principal Craig Whitred and Deputy Principals Lesley Olsen and Andrea Aleksic. There are 67 full-time staff. The region the school operates in is run by Richard English. Sport Each year students compete in a wide variety of sporting competitions including a swimming and athletics competition. Because of the influx of students from year 7 the school has chosen to introduce a new sporting house. Sports houses include Banks (red), Macquarie (yellow), Philip (blue) and Cook (green), named after famous explorers in the region. Notable alumni *Karrie Webb ‚Äì Former World Number 1 in Women's Golf *Neil Gooding ‚Äì Creator of the popular Back to the 80's Stage Musical and director of many Pitt Street (Sydney) and West End (London) stage productions  History  The earliest building at Ayr State High School was erected in 1934-36 as the Ayr State High and Intermediate School, with an enrolment drawn from the wider Burdekin region. It was constructed during a period of unprecedented economic growth in Ayr, and ranks with the 1935 Court House, 1935 Masonic Hall and 1939 Tropix Theatre, as one of the more important interwar buildings in the town. The Burdekin was first settled in the 1860s, and the town of Ayr was surveyed in 1882. The town grew in support of the increasing number of sugar plantations and small sugar growers establishing themselves in the Burdekin River region, and by the 1920s was the principal town in the district. A primary school was established at Ayr in 1886, but until the late 1920s Burdekin children had no local access to secondary education. In 1913 the Ayr State School committee requested the provision of high school courses at the primary school, and in 1920 promoted the idea of a separate high school for Ayr. A secondary department, offering academic, commercial, domestic science and manual training subjects, was finally attached to Ayr State School in 1928. In the early 1930s the local state school committee, encouraged by Ayr's unprecedented interwar growth and prosperity as a result of the expansion of the sugar industry, continued to put pressure on the Department of Public Instruction for the establishment of a high school. When the Department finally acquiesced, however, it was for a combined high and intermediate school, and there is some indication that an intermediate school only was considered at first. In fact, from 1925 until the late 1930s, Ayr State High School was the only new high school in the state, although several new secondary departments were established. Intermediate schools, equipped with workshops, laboratories, and domestic science rooms, were established in principal Queensland towns after 1928. They reflected a fundamental change in Queensland education policy in the late 1920s, focussing on syllabus revision and the education of children over 11 years of age. In Brisbane, intermediate schools were established as separate institutions, but in country areas, they generally formed part of existing high schools. Intermediate schools catered for children 12‚Äì13 years of age, offering a two-year course as a link between primary and secondary education. Setting up new schools for a two-year course proved expensive, and the intermediate school concept was replaced in the 1940s and 1950s by multilateral high schools offering a variety of courses. Plans for the Ayr Intermediate School (which opened as the Ayr State High and Intermediate School) were prepared in the Queensland Government Architect's office of the Department of Public Works in late 1934. The Chief Architect at this time was Andrew Baxter Leven (1885-1966). Leven was born, educated and worked as an Inspector of Works in Scotland before migrating to Australia. From 1910 to 1951 he was employed by the Queensland Government Works Department and was Chief Architect and Quantity Surveyor from 1933 to 1951. Other members of the office involved in the design were Frederick Thomas Jellett and Harold James Parr. During the 1930s Depression a government initiated works scheme was established to create employment. This involved the employment of architects, foremen and day labourers, and the use of local materials in the design and construction of government buildings such as court houses, government offices and state schools. This scheme, under which the Ayr State High and Intermediate School was constructed, was instigated by Labor Premier Forgan Smith. A site on the southern side of the town, a former Showground Reserve which was set aside as a high school reserve in 1921, was selected for the new high and intermediate school. The two-storeyed brick building was in progress by mid-1935, and was opened on 1 March 1937 with an enrolment of 77 students in the high school and 203 in the intermediate section. Construction had cost approximately , and when completed provided for a manual training section, store rooms, and a large concreted play area on the ground floor, and 8 classrooms, head teacher's office, staffrooms, entrance hall, cloakrooms, and domestic science section on the first floor. The intermediate section ceased as such at the end of 1963, and since 1964 the school has functioned as the Ayr State High School.  Description  Additional wing, Ayr Intermediate School, August 1940 Ayr State High School is an elevated brick school building with a corrugated iron roof which is topped with a ventilator and flagpole. The central entrance projects forward and on either side the classroom wings are connected by verandahs. The wings are one classroom wide so as to provide cross ventilation. The verandahs have arched arcading, which forms open play areas underneath. The detailing around arches is highlighted with stucco. The grounds include large expanses of lawn and substantial shade trees.  Heritage listing  Ayr State High School was listed on the Queensland Heritage Register on 13 January 1995 having satisfied the following criteria. The place is important in demonstrating the evolution or pattern of Queensland's history. Ayr State High School, erected in 1934-36, is significant as one of a group of substantial interwar buildings in Ayr, which illustrate the unprecedented era of prosperity accompanying the expansion of the sugar industry in the Burdekin region. The building also reflects the State Government's commitment to Ayr as a major regional centre in the interwar years. Ayr State High School is evidence of the implementation of the Intermediate School system, experimented with by the Queensland Department of Public Instruction during the interwar years. The place is important in demonstrating the principal characteristics of a particular class of cultural places. Ayr State High School is significant as an excellent regional example of a school building following the tradition of fine buildings erected by the Queensland Public Works Department. The use of brick and restrained classical detailing is typical for government buildings of the period. It is also a good example of a building designed to accommodate the tropical North Queensland climate, being raised above an open undercroft; with wide verandahs and ventilators. The place is important because of its aesthetic significance. Ayr State High School is significant for its aesthetic quality in design and classical-inspired detailing, including the arched entrance and symmetrical layout with projecting central bay.

At Sheffield, Clarke was never a regular first-team player making only two appearances, with England international Harry Thickett being well established at right-back. In the summer of 1903, Clarke returned to Northamptonshire, to join Northampton Town in the Southern League, where he gained a reputation as \\"the most promising left-back in the Southern League\\", whose \\"speed enabled him to overhaul the quickest of forwards\\". In April 1905, he was signed by fellow Southern League side, Southampton. The \\"Saints\\" were anxious to regain the Southern League title which they had taken six times in the eight years up to 1904, but had finished in a disappointing third place at the end of the 1904‚Äì05 season. During the close-season they signed nine players, of which Clarke was considered to be \\"the best capture\\". He made his Southampton debut in the opening match of the 1905‚Äì06 season, a 1‚Äì0 defeat at home to Brentford, retaining his place for the rest of the season, at the end of which the Saints finished as runners-up, five points behind champions Fulham. He continued to occupy the right-back position for the start of the 1906‚Äì07 season until late December, when he fell ill. He returned in mid- February but was only able to show glimpses of his previous form; after another eight matches he suffered a serious knee injury, losing his place to Jack Eastham. Although Clarke spent several months trying to regain his fitness, he eventually retired in October 1908 without returning to the first- team.

In terms of set-builder notation, that is : A\\\\times B = \\\\\\\\{\\\\,(a,b)\\\\mid a\\\\in A \\\\ \\\\mbox{ and } \\\\ b\\\\in B\\\\,\\\\\\\\}. A table can be created by taking the Cartesian product of a set of rows and a set of columns. If the Cartesian product is taken, the cells of the table contain ordered pairs of the form . One can similarly define the Cartesian product of n sets, also known as an n-fold Cartesian product, which can be represented by an n-dimensional array, where each element is an n-tuple. An ordered pair is a 2-tuple or couple. More generally still, one can define the Cartesian product of an indexed family of sets. The Cartesian product is named after Ren√© Descartes, whose formulation of analytic geometry gave rise to the concept, which is further generalized in terms of direct product.  Examples   A deck of cards  Standard 52-card deck An illustrative example is the standard 52-card deck. The standard playing card ranks {A, K, Q, J, 10, 9, 8, 7, 6, 5, 4, 3, 2} form a 13-element set. The card suits form a four-element set. The Cartesian product of these sets returns a 52-element set consisting of 52 ordered pairs, which correspond to all 52 possible playing cards. returns a set of the form {(A, ‚ô†), (A, ), (A, ), (A, ‚ô£), (K, ‚ô†), ..., (3, ‚ô£), (2, ‚ô†), (2, ), (2, ), (2, ‚ô£)}. returns a set of the form {(‚ô†, A), (‚ô†, K), (‚ô†, Q), (‚ô†, J), (‚ô†, 10), ..., (‚ô£, 6), (‚ô£, 5), (‚ô£, 4), (‚ô£, 3), (‚ô£, 2)}. These two sets are distinct, even disjoint.  A two-dimensional coordinate system  Cartesian coordinates of example points The main historical example is the Cartesian plane in analytic geometry. In order to represent geometrical shapes in a numerical way, and extract numerical information from shapes' numerical representations, Ren√© Descartes assigned to each point in the plane a pair of real numbers, called its coordinates. Usually, such a pair's first and second components are called its x and y coordinates, respectively (see picture). The set of all such pairs (i.e., the Cartesian product , with ‚Ñù denoting the real numbers) is thus assigned to the set of all points in the plane.  Most common implementation (set theory)  A formal definition of the Cartesian product from set-theoretical principles follows from a definition of ordered pair. The most common definition of ordered pairs, the Kuratowski's definition, is (x, y) = \\\\\\\\{\\\\\\\\{x\\\\\\\\},\\\\\\\\{x, y\\\\\\\\}\\\\\\\\}. Under this definition, (x, y) is an element of \\\\mathcal{P}(\\\\mathcal{P}(X \\\\cup Y)), and X\\\\times Y is a subset of that set, where \\\\mathcal{P} represents the power set operator. Therefore, the existence of the Cartesian product of any two sets in ZFC follows from the axioms of pairing, union, power set, and specification. Since functions are usually defined as a special case of relations, and relations are usually defined as subsets of the Cartesian product, the definition of the two-set Cartesian product is necessarily prior to most other definitions.  Non-commutativity and non-associativity  Let A, B, C, and D be sets. The Cartesian product is not commutative, : A \\\\times B eq B \\\\times A, because the ordered pairs are reversed unless at least one of the following conditions is satisfied: * A is equal to B, or * A or B is the empty set. For example: : A = {1,2}; B = {3,4} :: A √ó B = {1,2} √ó {3,4} = {(1,3), (1,4), (2,3), (2,4)} :: B √ó A = {3,4} √ó {1,2} = {(3,1), (3,2), (4,1), (4,2)} : A = B = {1,2} :: A √ó B = B √ó A = {1,2} √ó {1,2} = {(1,1), (1,2), (2,1), (2,2)} : A = {1,2}; B = ‚àÖ :: A √ó B = {1,2} √ó ‚àÖ = ‚àÖ :: B √ó A = ‚àÖ √ó {1,2} = ‚àÖ Strictly speaking, the Cartesian product is not associative (unless one of the involved sets is empty). : (A\\\\times B)\\\\times C eq A \\\\times (B \\\\times C) If for example A = {1}, then (A √ó A) √ó A = { ((1,1),1) } ‚â† { (1,(1,1)) } = A √ó (A √ó A).  Intersections, unions, and subsets  The Cartesian product satisfies the following property with respect to intersections (see middle picture). : (A \\\\cap B) \\\\times (C \\\\cap D) = (A \\\\times C) \\\\cap (B \\\\times D) In most cases, the above statement is not true if we replace intersection with union (see rightmost picture). : (A \\\\cup B) \\\\times (C \\\\cup D) eq (A \\\\times C) \\\\cup (B \\\\times D) In fact, we have that: : (A \\\\times C) \\\\cup (B \\\\times D) = [(A \\\\setminus B) \\\\times C] \\\\cup [(A \\\\cap B) \\\\times (C \\\\cup D)] \\\\cup [(B \\\\setminus A) \\\\times D] For the set difference, we also have the following identity: : (A \\\\times C) \\\\setminus (B \\\\times D) = [A \\\\times (C \\\\setminus D)] \\\\cup [(A \\\\setminus B) \\\\times C] Here are some rules demonstrating distributivity with other operators (see leftmost picture):Singh, S.

For example, defining two sets: } and Both set A and set B consist of two elements each. Their Cartesian product, written as , results in a new set which has the following elements: : A √ó B = {(a,5), (a,6), (b,5), (b,6)}. where each element of A is paired with each element of B, and where each pair makes up one element of the output set. The number of values in each element of the resulting set is equal to the number of sets whose Cartesian product is being taken; 2 in this case. The cardinality of the output set is equal to the product of the cardinalities of all the input sets. That is, : |A √ó B= |A¬∑ |B|. In this case, |A √ó B= 4 Similarly : |A √ó B √ó C= |A¬∑ |B¬∑ |Cand so on. The set is infinite if either A or B is infinite, and the other set is not the empty set.Peter S. (1998).

Retrieved August 1, 2011, from http://www.mathpath.org/concepts/infinity.htm  Cartesian products of several sets   n-ary Cartesian product  The Cartesian product can be generalized to the n-ary Cartesian product over n sets X1, ..., Xn as the set : X_1\\\\times\\\\cdots\\\\times X_n = \\\\\\\\{(x_1, \\\\ldots, x_n) \\\\mid x_i \\\\in X_i \\\\ \\\\text{for every} \\\\ i \\\\in \\\\\\\\{1, \\\\ldots, n\\\\\\\\} \\\\\\\\}. of n-tuples. If tuples are defined as nested ordered pairs, it can be identified with . If a tuple is defined as a function on that takes its value at i to be the ith element of the tuple, then the Cartesian product X1√ó...√óXn is the set of functions : \\\\\\\\{ x:\\\\\\\\{1,\\\\ldots,n\\\\\\\\}\\\\to X_1\\\\cup\\\\ldots\\\\cup X_n \\\\ \\\\ x(i)\\\\in X_i \\\\ \\\\text{for every} \\\\ i \\\\in \\\\\\\\{1, \\\\ldots, n\\\\\\\\} \\\\\\\\}.  n-ary Cartesian power  The Cartesian square of a set X is the Cartesian product . An example is the 2-dimensional plane where R is the set of real numbers: R2 is the set of all points where x and y are real numbers (see the Cartesian coordinate system). The n-ary Cartesian power of a set X, denoted X^n, can be defined as : X^n = \\\\underbrace{ X \\\\times X \\\\times \\\\cdots \\\\times X }_{n}= \\\\\\\\{ (x_1,\\\\ldots,x_n) \\\\ \\\\ x_i \\\\in X \\\\ \\\\text{for every} \\\\ i \\\\in \\\\\\\\{1, \\\\ldots, n\\\\\\\\} \\\\\\\\}. An example of this is , with R again the set of real numbers, and more generally Rn. The n-ary Cartesian power of a set X is isomorphic to the space of functions from an n-element set to X. As a special case, the 0-ary Cartesian power of X may be taken to be a singleton set, corresponding to the empty function with codomain X.  Infinite Cartesian products  It is possible to define the Cartesian product of an arbitrary (possibly infinite) indexed family of sets. If I is any index set, and \\\\\\\\{X_i\\\\\\\\}_{i\\\\in I} is a family of sets indexed by I, then the Cartesian product of the sets in \\\\\\\\{X_i\\\\\\\\}_{i\\\\in I} is defined to be : \\\\prod_{i \\\\in I} X_i = \\\\left\\\\\\\\{\\\\left. f: I \\\\to \\\\bigcup_{i \\\\in I} X_i\\\\ \\\\right|\\\\ (\\\\forall i)(f(i) \\\\in X_i)\\\\right\\\\\\\\}, that is, the set of all functions defined on the index set such that the value of the function at a particular index i is an element of Xi. Even if each of the Xi is nonempty, the Cartesian product may be empty if the axiom of choice, which is equivalent to the statement that every such product is nonempty, is not assumed. For each j in I, the function : \\\\pi_{j}: \\\\prod_{i \\\\in I} X_i \\\\to X_{j}, defined by \\\\pi_{j}(f) = f(j) is called the jth projection map. Cartesian power is a Cartesian product where all the factors Xi are the same set X. In this case, : \\\\prod_{i \\\\in I} X_i = \\\\prod_{i \\\\in I} X is the set of all functions from I to X, and is frequently denoted XI. This case is important in the study of cardinal exponentiation. An important special case is when the index set is \\\\mathbb{N}, the natural numbers: this Cartesian product is the set of all infinite sequences with the ith term in its corresponding set Xi. For example, each element of : \\\\prod_{n = 1}^\\\\infty \\\\mathbb R = \\\\mathbb R \\\\times \\\\mathbb R \\\\times \\\\cdots can be visualized as a vector with countably infinite real number components. This set is frequently denoted \\\\mathbb{R}^\\\\omega, or \\\\mathbb{R}^{\\\\mathbb{N}}.  Other forms   Abbreviated form  If several sets are being multiplied together (e.g., X1, X2, X3, ‚Ä¶), then some authorsOsborne, M., and Rubinstein, A., 1994. A Course in Game Theory. MIT Press. choose to abbreviate the Cartesian product as simply √óXi.  Cartesian product of functions  If f is a function from A to B and g is a function from X to Y, then their Cartesian product is a function from to with : (f\\\\times g)(a, x) = (f(a), g(x)). This can be extended to tuples and infinite collections of functions. This is different from the standard Cartesian product of functions considered as sets.  Cylinder  Let A be a set and B \\\\subseteq A. Then the cylinder of B with respect to A is the Cartesian product B \\\\times A of B and A. Normally, A is considered to be the universe of the context and is left away. For example, if B is a subset of the natural numbers \\\\mathbb{N}, then the cylinder of B is B \\\\times \\\\mathbb{N}.  Definitions outside set theory  Category theory Although the Cartesian product is traditionally applied to sets, category theory provides a more general interpretation of the product of mathematical structures. This is distinct from, although related to, the notion of a Cartesian square in category theory, which is a generalization of the fiber product. Exponentiation is the right adjoint of the Cartesian product; thus any category with a Cartesian product (and a final object) is a Cartesian closed category. Graph theory In graph theory, the Cartesian product of two graphs G and H is the graph denoted by , whose vertex set is the (ordinary) Cartesian product and such that two vertices (u,v) and (u‚Ä≤,v‚Ä≤) are adjacent in , if and only if and v is adjacent with v‚Ä≤ in H, or and u is adjacent with u‚Ä≤ in G. The Cartesian product of graphs is not a product in the sense of category theory. Instead, the categorical product is known as the tensor product of graphs.

The majority of vessels operated by maritime carriers are fully cellular ships. Before 1991 most containerships were constructed with hatch covers. Because of the longer loading and unloading times of these types of ships, the cellular type was invented. As loading and unloading occurs only vertically and the containers have standardized dimensions (TEU), large quantities of cargo can quickly be loaded using gantry cranes. Advantages: * The cargo handling is more efficient resulting in shorter time in port * Guide rails hold the containers into place instead of time-consuming lashings * No need of hatch covers, reducing maintenance, weight, and handling * There is a high freeboard, resulting in a stronger construction * Containers lashed to cellular vessels are less vulnerable to crew tampering than containers on mixed-use cargo vessels, making them less of a risk from the standpoint of port security. Disadvantages: * The high freeboard results in higher registered tonnage * The price of the ship is high due to the amount of steel used and the complex design process * The absence of hatch covers means that rain water and overcoming seawater can freely enter into the cargo hold.

Regarded as one of Australia's Big Things, the granite sculpture stands at in height, and weighs in the vicinity of 70 tonnes. It took 17 years to produce from initial proposal to the final unveiling in 2009, and two years for the artist, Marijan Bekic (with the assistance of his son, David), to carve. The stylised work of a farmer represents the early settlers of the region, with carvings symbolising grain and sheep found within the sculpture.  History  The former District Council of Le Hunte (now Wudinna District Council) first proposed the idea of a community project in 1992, and the focus quickly moved to the construction of a memorial to the early settlers of the region. Given that the area is well known for its granite, it was decided that the project should incorporate the material, and a request for tender was announced in 1999. Croatian-born artist Marijan Bekic responded to the advertisement, producing a scale model of his concept, and this was shown to the local community. With the community's support of the concept in hand, the council sought a grant to fund the project. Although this was not forthcoming, land was donated by the Wudinna & Districts Telecentre, various companies provided sponsorship, and local residents offered food and accommodation for the artist. The result was that the project commenced in 2007, with a projected construction time of twelve months. The project ended up taking the artist and his son two years to complete, and it was unveiled on 17 April 2009. The unveiling was preceded by a number of local events, including a live radio broadcast by the Australian Broadcasting Corporation's Peter Goers. The official launch was attended by over 1000 people, with Federal and State politicians Rowan Ramsey and Liz Penfold making an appearance. In August 2009, the Australian Farmer was nominated for a Ruby Award in the \\"Community Impact (over $100,000)\\" category. Design and construction Standing at in height, the work was hand-carved from of local granite. The sculpture is a stylised representation of a farmer. While it takes a basic human form, the top represents the sun, while in the body are carved grain crops. Sheep are placed at the foot of the statue, representing the sheep farmers in the district as well as creating the feet of the figure when viewed from a distance.

It lasted from 1640 to 1686. Acquaintance to different religious bodies Calixt, a professor at Helmstedt, had through his travels in England, the Netherlands, Italy, and France, through his acquaintance with the different Churches and their representatives, and through his extensive study, developed a more friendly attitude towards the different religious bodies than the majority of his contemporary Lutheran theologians. Doctrinal minimalism While the latter firmly adhered to the \\"pure doctrine,\\" Calixt tended not to regard doctrine as the one thing necessary for a Christian; while in doctrine itself he did not regard everything as equally certain and important. Consequently, he advocated unity between those who agreed on the fundamental minimum, with liberty as to all less fundamental points. In regard to Catholicism, he would have (as Melanchthon once would have) conceded to the pope a primacy human in origin, and he also admitted that one might call the Mass a sacrifice. Academic theology On the side of Calixt stood the theological faculties of Helmstedt, Rinteln, and K√∂nigsberg; opposed to him stood those of Leipzig, Jena, Strasburg, Giessen, Marburg, and Greifswald. Abraham Calov in especial opposed Calixt. Elector of Saxony The Elector of Saxony, for political reasons, opposed the Reformed Church, because the other two secular electors (Palatine and Brandenburg) were \\"reformed,\\" and were getting more and more the advantage of him. In 1649 he sent to the three dukes of Brunswick, who maintained Helmstedt as their common university, a communication in which he voiced all the objections of his Lutheran professors, and complained that Calixt wished to extract the elements of truth from all religions, fuse all into an entirely new religion, and so provoke a violent schism. Professor at Wittenberg In 1650, Calov became a professor at Wittenberg, and he signalized his entrance into office with a vehement attack on the Syncretists in Helmstedt. An outburst of polemical writings followed. In 1650 the dukes of Brunswick answered the Elector of Saxony that the discord should not be allowed to increase, and proposed a meeting of the political councillors. Saxony, however, did not favour this suggestion. An attempt to convene a meeting of theologians was not more successful. The theologians of Wittenberg and Leipzig now elaborated a new formula, condemning ninety-eight heresies of the Helmstedt theologians. This formula (consensus) was to be signed by everyone who wished to remain in the Lutheran Church. Outside Wittenberg and Leipzig, however, it was not accepted, and Calixt's death in 1656 ushered in five years of almost undisturbed peace. Strife in Hesse-Kassel The strife broke out afresh in Hesse-Kassel, where Landgrave William VI sought to effect a union between his Lutheran and Reformed subjects, or at least to lessen their mutual hatred. In 1661 he had a colloquy held in Kassel between the Lutheran theologians of the University of Rinteln and the Reformed theologians of the University of Marburg. Enraged at this revival of the syncretism of Calixt, the Wittenberg theologians in vehement terms called on the Rinteln professors to make their submission, whereupon the latter answered with a detailed defence. Another long series of polemical treatises followed. Disputes between Evangelical bodies In Brandenburg- Prussia the \\"Great Elector\\" (Frederick William I) forbade (1663) preachers to speak of the disputes between the Evangelical bodies. A long colloquy in Berlin (September 1662 to May 1663) led only to fresh discord. The Elector, however, grew impatient with a lack of success at his conferences. He put an end to them in 1664 and published another \\"syncretistic\\" edict. Since the edict disallowed the Formula of Concord, one of the Lutheran Confessions as contained in the Book of Concord of 1580, many Lutheran clergy could not bring themselves to comply with the edict. Observing the syncretistic edict Whoever refused to sign the form declaring his intention to observe this regulation was deprived of his position, including Paul Gerhardt, a pastor and noted hymnwriter. The citizens of Berlin petitioned to have him restored, and owing to their repeated requests an exception to the edict was made for Gerhardt, although his conscience did not allow him to retain a post which, appeared to him, could only be held on condition of a tacit repudiation of the Formula of Concord. For over a year he lived in Berlin without fixed employment. During this time his wife also died, leaving him with only one surviving child. Ironically, the edict was withdrawn a few months later, although by this time his patroness, Electress Louisa Henrietta had died and so he was still without a position. Allegations of heresy The attempts of the Wittenberg theologians to declare Calixt and his school un-Lutheran and heretical were now met by Calixt's son, Friedrich Ulrich Calixt, The latter defended the theology of his father, but also tried to show that his doctrine did not so very much differ from that of his opponents. Wittenberg found its new champion in √Ügidius Strauch, who attacked Calixt with all the resources of learning, polemics, sophistry, wit, cynicism, and abuse. The Helmstedt side was defended by the celebrated scholar and statesman, Hermann Conring. The Saxon princes now recognized the danger that the attempt to carry through the \\"Consensus\\" as a formula of belief might lead to a fresh schism in the Lutheran Church, and might thus render its position difficult in the face of the Catholics. Old Lutheran confession The proposals of Calov and his party to continue the refutation and to compel the Brunswick theologians to bind themselves under obligation to the old Lutheran confession therefore remained unimplemented. On the contrary, the Saxon theologians were forbidden to continue the strife in writing. Negotiations for peace then resulted, with Duke Ernst the Pious of Saxe-Gotha especially active towards this end, and the project of establishing a permanent college of theologians to decide theological disputes was entertained. Negotiation with the courts However, the negotiations with the courts of Brunswick, Mecklenburg, Denmark, and Sweden remained as fruitless as those with the theological faculties, except that peace was maintained until 1675. Calov then renewed hostilities. He now attacked not only Calixt, but also and particularly the moderate John Mus√¶us of Jena. Calov succeeded in having the whole University of Jena (and after a long resistance Mus√¶us himself) compelled to renounce syncretism. But this was his last victory. The elector renewed his prohibition against polemical writings. Renewed attacks on syncretists Calov seemed to give way, since in 1683 he asked whether, in the view of the danger which France then constituted for Germany, a Calixtinic Syncretism with \\"Papists\\" and the Reformed were still condemnable, and whether in deference to the Elector of Brandenburg and the dukes of Brunswick, the strife should not be buried by an amnesty, or whether, on the contrary, the war against syncretism should be continued. He later returned to his attack on the syncretists, but died in 1686, and with his death the strife ended. Reduced religious hatred The Syncretist Strife had the result of lessening religious hatred and of promoting mutual forbearance. Catholicism thus benefited, as Protestants came to better understand and appreciate it. In Protestant theology it prepared the way for the sentimental theology of Pietism to become more popular than orthodoxy.

Julius Gerber (born Israel Getzel Gerber; 1872‚Äì1956) was a leading Socialist Party of America party official and politician during the first two decades of the 20th century. Gerber headed the important Socialist Party unit for New York City and its environs from 1911 through 1922. He played a key role in the party split of 1919, out of which the Communist Party emerged. Biography Early years Gerber was born December 24, 1872 in Riga, Governorate of Livonia, Russian Empire. His father was a tradesman. The Gerbers were Jewish, and as members of a persecuted minority, the family fled Tsarist Russia in 1886, landing in New York. Young Julius took a job as a sheet metal worker at the age of 14, a task at which he remained until 1911.Solon DeLeon (ed.), The American Labor Who's Who. New York: Hanford Press, 1925. Page 84. He was a member of the Amalgamated Metal Workers Union. There is no record substantiating Julius Gerber arrived in the United States with any family member. According to his USA passport applications of 1928 and 1931, he arrived in the United States in either September 1887 or August 1888 at the age of 16 or 17. He applied for and was granted USA citizenship on October 27, 1893, in Kings County, Brooklyn, New York. He married Lena Sacht on February 13, 1892, in New York according to their marriage license. Gerber was a committed socialist from an early age, joining the Socialist Labor Party of America (SLP) in 1890.State of New York, Proceedings of the Judiciary Committee of the Assembly in the Matter of the Investigation by the Assembly of the State of New York as to the Qualifications of Louis Waldman, August Claessens, Samuel A. DeWitt, Samuel Orr and Charles Solomon, to Retain Their Seats in Said Body, In 3 Volumes. Albany, NY: J.B. Lyon Co., 1920. Vol. 1, pg. 164. Hereafter NY Judiciary Proceedings. In the bitter 1899 split of the SLP, Gerber allied himself with the pro-American Federation of Labor insurgents headed by Henry Slobodin and Morris Hillquit against the regular faction of Daniel DeLeon and Henry Kuhn. Julius was made the organizer of Local New York of the new organization, a group calling themselves the Social Democratic Party after the DeLeon-Kuhn faction won control of the party name and logo as the result of a lawsuit. In August 1901 this Eastern SDP group united with a Midwestern group of the same name to establish the Socialist Party of America. Gerber was elected as the first Secretary of Local New York SPA following formation of the new organization.\\"A Remarkable Growth,\\" Appeal to Reason [Girard, KS], whole no. 311 (Nov. 16, 1901), pg. 3. Gerber remained on as organizer of Local Greater New York for this enlarged organization through 1902. Gerber was active in the publishing group which issued the socialist New Yorker Volkszeitung and served as Financial Secretary of that organization. He was also Secretary of the Press Committee which established the English- language New York Daily Call a few years later. Gerber was a frequent participant at the national conventions of the Socialist Party which determined party policy, attending the 1900, 1904, 1908, and 1912 gatherings.NY Judiciary Proceedings, v. 1, pg. 165. Party functionary Gerber worked as the organizer of Local Kings County from 1908 to 1909, before being elected Executive Secretary of Local Greater New York in February 1911.NY Judiciary Proceedings, v. 1, pg. 164. Gerber remained in this full- time, paid position for over a decade, standing down only in 1922, probably due to the Socialist Party's declining financial fortunes. Thereafter, Gerber paid the rent through his work as a printing salesman.DeLeon (ed.), The American Labor Who's Who, pg. 84. Julius was a delegate to the 1917 Socialist Party Convention, a gathering which passed the aggressively anti-militarist St. Louis Manifesto.NY Judiciary Proceedings, v. 1, pg. 165. In addition to his regular party tasks, Gerber was the Secretary of the Workingmen's Cooperative Publishing Association, the group responsible for publication of the New York Call, one of just two Socialist Party English language daily newspapers during the decade of the 1910s.The other Socialist daily was the Milwaukee Leader, published by Victor L. Berger. Gerber sat on the State Executive Committee of the Socialist Party of New York in 1919, a group which conducted a factional war on behalf of the party regulars against the Left Wing Section of the Socialist Party. He was a delegate to the seminal 1919 Socialist Party Convention, which led to the split of the party's Left Wing to form the Communist Labor Party of America.NY Judiciary Proceedings, v. 1, pg. 165. Gerber was elected to the governing National Executive Committee of the Socialist Party in 1921, serving a one-year term. He ran for New York State Assembly in that same year, standing in the 18th Assembly District. Following the demise of the New York Call in 1923, Gerber became actively involved with its successor publication, The New Leader. He was the Secretary of the New Leader Publishing Association, the group which published the paper, from its establishment in 1924.DeLeon (ed.), The American Labor Who's Who, pg. 84. Gerber split along with other \\"Old Guard\\" members to form the Social Democratic Federation beginning in 1936-1937. He was an active participant in one of the SDF's early planning conferences. Gerber was strictly a party functionary rather than an agitator or a theoretician and did not publish any books or pamphlets in his lifetime. He died on July 16, 1956. Legacy Gerber was portrayed in Warren Beatty's 1981 historical drama Reds by William Daniels.

The Communist movement has faced opposition since it was founded and the opposition to it has often been organized and violent.  White Terror  White Terror is a term that was coined during the French Revolution in 1795 in order to denote the counter-revolutionary violence that occurred however unorganized it was. Since then, historians and individual groups have both used the term White Terror in order to refer to coordinated counter- revolutionary violence in a broader sense. In the course of history, many White Terror groups have persecuted, attacked and killed communists, alleged communists and communist-sympathizers as part of their counter-revolutionary and anti-communist agendas.  The Americas  Middle America and South America were ravaged by many bloody civil wars and mass killings during the 20th century. Most of these conflicts were politically-motivated, or they revolved around political issues, and anti-communist mass killings were committed during several of them.  Argentina  From 1976 to 1983, the military dictatorship of Argentina, National Reorganization Process, organized the arrest and execution of between 9,000 and 30,000 civilians suspected of communism or other leftist sympathies during a period of state terror. Children of the victims were sometimes given a new identity and forcibly adopted by childless military families. Held to account in the 2000s, the perpetrators of the killings argued that their actions were a necessary part of a \\"war\\" against Communism. This campaign was part of a broader anti- communist operation called Operation Condor, which involved the repression and assassination of thousands of left-wing dissidents and alleged communists by the coordinated intelligence services of the Southern Cone countries of Latin America, which was led by Pinochet's Chile and supported by the United States.Mark Aarons (2007). \\"Justice Betrayed: Post-1945 Responses to Genocide.\\" In David A.

Salvadoran Civil War  The Salvadoran Civil War (1979‚Äì1992) was a conflict between the military-led government of El Salvador and a coalition of five left-wing guerrilla organizations that was known collectively as the Farabundo Mart√≠ National Liberation Front (FMLN). A coup on 15 October 1979 led to the killings of anti-coup protesters by the government as well as anti-disorder protesters by the guerrillas and it is widely seen as the tipping point toward civil war. By January 1980, the left-wing political organizations united to form the Coordinated Revolutionaries of the Masses (CRM). A few months later, the left-wing armed groups united to form the Unified Revolutionary Directorate (DRU).

A report from 1984 discussed \\"the murder of thousands by a military government that maintains its authority by terror\\".Guatemala: A Nation of Prisoners, An Americas Watch Report, January 1984, pp. 2‚Äì3. Human Rights Watch described extraordinarily cruel actions by the armed forces, mostly against unarmed civilians. The repression reached genocidal levels in the predominantly indigenous northern provinces where guerrillas of the Guerrilla Army of the Poor operated. There, the Guatemalan military viewed the Maya, traditionally seen as subhumans, as being supportive of the guerillas and began a campaign of wholesale killings and disappearances of Mayan peasants. While massacres of Indigenous peasants had occurred earlier in the war, the systematic use of terror against the Indigenous population began around 1975 and peaked during the first half of the 1980s. An estimated 200,000 Guatemalan civilians were killed during the Guatemalan Civil War - 93% by government forces - including at least 40,000 persons who \\"disappeared\\". Of the 42,275 individual cases of killing and \\"disappearances\\" documented by the CEH, 83% of the victims were Maya and 17% Ladino meaning that by applying these proportions to the estimated 200,000 civilians killed and disappeared in the Guatemalan Civil War overall it can be inferred that up to 166,000 Maya and 34,000 Ladino were killed or disappeared in the genocide.83% of the \\"fully identified\\" 42,275 civilians killed by human rights violations during the Guatemalan Civil War were Mayan and 17% Ladino. This estimate come from applying the 83% and 17% proportions to the 200,000 disappeared and killed during total war < See , and  Asia  The political and ideological struggles in Asia during the 20th century frequently involved communist movements. Anti-communist mass killings were committed on a large scale in Asia.  China  KMT troops rounding up Communist prisoners The Shanghai massacre of 12 April 1927 was a violent suppression of Communist Party of China (CPC) organizations in Shanghai by the military forces of Chiang Kai-shek's conservative faction in the Kuomintang (KMT). Following the incident, the latter carried out a full-scale purge of communists in all areas under their control and even more violent suppressions occurred in cities such as Guangzhou and Changsha.Wilbur, Nationalist Revolution 114 The purge led to an open split between the left- and right-wings of the KMT, with Chiang Kai- shek establishing himself as the leader of the right-wing at Nanjing in opposition to the original left-wing KMT government led by Wang Jingwei in Wuhan. Before dawn on 12 April, gang members began to attack district offices controlled by the union workers, including Zhabei, Nanshi and Pudong. Under an emergency decree, Chiang ordered the 26th Army to disarm the workers' militias, which resulted in more than 300 people being killed and wounded. The union workers organized a mass meeting to denounce Chiang on 13 April and thousands of workers and students went to the headquarters of the 2nd Division of the 26th Army to protest. Soldiers opened fire, killing 100 and wounding many more. Chiang dissolved the provisional government of Shanghai, labor unions and all other organizations under Communist control and he reorganized a network of unions with allegiance to the Kuomintang under the control of Du Yuesheng. Over 1,000 communists were arrested, some 300 were executed and more than 5,000 went missing. Western news reports later nicknamed General Bai \\"The Hewer of Communist Heads\\". Some National Revolutionary Army commanders with communist backgrounds who were graduates of the Whampoa Military Academy kept their sympathies hidden and were not arrested and many of them switched their allegiance to the communists after the start of the Chinese Civil War. (this book is controversial for its anti-Mao tone and references). The twin rival KMT governments, known as the Nanjing‚ÄìWuhan split (Chinese: ÂÆÅÊ±âÂàÜË£Ç), did not last long because the Wuhan Kuomintang also began to violently purge Communists as well after its leader Wang found out about Joseph Stalin's secret order to Mikhail Borodin that the CPC's efforts were to be organized so it could overthrow the left-wing KMT and take over the Wuhan government. More than 10,000 communists in Canton, Xiamen, Fuzhou, Ningbo, Nanjing, Hangzhou and Changsha were arrested and executed within 20 days. The Soviet Union officially terminated its cooperation with the KMT. Wang, fearing retribution as a communist sympathizer, fled to Europe. The Wuhan Nationalist government soon disintegrated, leaving Chiang as the sole legitimate leader of the Kuomintang. In a year, over 300,000 people were killed across China in the suppression campaigns carried out by the KMT.Barnouin, Barbara and Yu Changgen. Zhou Enlai: A Political Life.

During the civil war, the Kuomintang anti-Communist faction killed 1,131,000 soldiers before entering combat during its conscription campaigns. In addition, the Kuomintang faction massacred 1 million civilians during the civil war.  East Timor  By broadcasting false accusations of communism against the Revolutionary Front for an Independent East Timor leaders and sowing discord in the Timorese Democratic Union coalition, the Indonesian government fostered instability in East Timor and according to observers created a pretext for invading it.Dunn, p. 78; Budiadjo and Liong, p. 5; Jolliffe, pp. 197‚Äì198; Taylor (1991), p. 58. Taylor cites a September CIA report describing Indonesian attempts to \\"provoke incidents that would provide the Indonesians with an excuse to invade should they decide to do so\\". During the Indonesian invasion of East Timor and the subsequent occupation of it, the Indonesian military killed and starved around 150,000Kiernan, p. 594.http://www.hawaii.edu/powerkills/SOD.TAB14.1C.GIF citizens of East Timor or about a fifth of its population. Oxford University held an academic consensus which called the occupation the East Timor genocide and Yale University teaches it as part of its Genocide Studies program.  Indonesia  A violent anti-Communist purge took place shortly after an abortive coup in the capital of Indonesia, Jakarta, which was blamed on the Communist Party of Indonesia (PKI). Most estimates of the number of people who were killed by the Indonesian security forces range from 500,000 to 1,000,000.Friend (2003), p. 113. The bloody purge constitutes one of the worst, yet least known, mass murders since the Second World War. The killings started in October 1965 in Jakarta, spread to Central and East Java and later to Bali and smaller outbreaks occurred on parts of other islands,Cribb (1990), p. 3. most notably Sumatra. As the Sukarno presidency began to unravel and Suharto began to assert control following the coup attempt, the PKI's upper national leaders were hunted down and arrested and some of them were summarily executed and the Indonesian Air Force in particular was a target of the purge. The party chairman Dipa Nusantara Aidit had flown to Central Java in early October, where the coup attempt had been supported by leftist officers in Yogyakarta, Salatiga and Semarang.Vickers (2005), p. 157. Fellow senior party leader Njoto was shot around 6 November, Aidit on 22 November and First Deputy PKI Chairman M.H. Lukman was killed shortly after.Ricklefs (1991), p. 288; Vickers (2005), p. 157 In 2016, an international tribunal in The Hague ruled that the killings constitute crimes against humanity and it also ruled that the United States and other Western governments were complicit in the crimes. Declassified documents published in 2017 confirm that not only did the United States government have detailed knowledge of the massacres as they happened, it was also deeply involved in the campaign of mass killings. Historian John Roosa contends the documents show \\"the U.S. was part and parcel of the operation, strategizing with the Indonesian army and encouraging them to go after the PKI.\\" According to University of Connecticut historian Bradley R. Simpson, the documents \\"contain damning details that the US was willfully and gleefully pushing for the mass murder of innocent people\\". UCLA historian Geoffrey B. Robinson argues that without the backing of the US and other powerful Western states, the Indonesian Army's program of mass killings would not have occurred.  Korea  During the Korean War, tens of thousands of suspected communists and communist sympathizers were killed in what came to be known as the Bodo League massacre. Estimates of the death toll vary. According to Prof. Kim Dong-Choon, Commissioner of the Truth and Reconciliation Commission, at least 100,000 people were executed on suspicion of supporting communism. The overwhelming majority‚Äì82%‚Äìof the Korean War-era massacres that the Truth and Reconciliation Commission was petitioned to investigate were perpetrated by South Korean forces, with just 18% of the massacres being perpetrated by North Korean forces. On 24 January 2008, President Roh Moo-hyun apologized for the mass killings.  Taiwan  Tens of thousands of people, labeled as communist sympathizers and spies, were killed by the government of Chiang Kai- shek during the White Terror () in Taiwan, a violent suppression of political dissidents following the 28 February Incident in 1947. Protests erupted on 27 February following an altercation between a group of Tobacco Monopoly Bureau agents and a Taipei resident, with protestors calling for democratic reforms and an end to corruption. The Kuomintang regime responded by using violence to suppress the popular uprising. Over the next several days, the government-led crackdown killed several thousand people, with estimates generally setting the death toll somewhere between 10,000 and 30,000 or even more. From 1947 to 1987, around 140,000 Taiwanese were imprisoned, about 3,000 to 4,000 of whom were executed for their alleged opposition to the Kuomintang regime.  Thailand  The Thai military government and its Communist Suppression Operations Command (CSOC), helped by the Royal Thai Army, the Royal Thai Police and paramilitary vigilantes, reacted with drastic measures to the insurgency of the Communist Party of Thailand during the 1960s and 1970s. The anti-communist operations peaked between 1971 and 1973 during the rule of Field Marshal Thanom Kittikachorn and General Praphas Charusathien. According to official figures, 3,008 suspected communists were killed throughout the country. Alternative estimates are much higher. These civilians were usually killed without any judicial proceedings. A prominent example was the so-called \\"Red Drum\\" or \\"Red Barrel\\" killings of Lam Sai, Phatthalung Province, Southern Thailand, where more than 200 civilians (informal accounts speak of up to 3,000) who were accused of helping the communists were burned in red 200-litre oil drums, sometimes after having been killed to dispose of their bodies and sometimes burned alive. The incident was never thoroughly investigated and none of the perpetrators was brought to justice. After three years of civilian rule following the October 1973 popular uprising, at least 46 leftist students and activists who had gathered on and around Bangkok's Thammasat University campus were massacred by police and right-wing paramilitaries on 6 October 1976. They had been accused of supporting communism. The mass killing followed a campaign of violently anti-communist propaganda by right-wing politicians, media and clerics, exemplified by the Buddhist monk Phra Kittiwuttho's claim that killing communists was not sinful. Vietnam Benjamin Valentino estimates that the U.S. and South Vietnam committed 110,000‚Äì310,000 \\"counterguerrilla mass killings\\" during the Vietnam War.  Europe  The communist movement has faced opposition since it was founded in Europe in the late 19th century. The opposition to it has sometimes been violent and during the 20th century, anti-communist mass killings were committed on a large scale.  Germany  German communists, socialists and trade unionists were among the earliest domestic opponents of NazismNon-Jewish Resistance, Holocaust Encyclopedia, United States Holocaust Memorial Museum, Washington, D.C. and they were also among the first to be sent to concentration camps. Adolf Hitler claimed that communism was a Jewish ideology which the Nazis called \\"Judeo-Bolshevism\\". Fear of communist agitation was used to justify the Enabling Act of 1933, the law which gave Hitler plenary powers. Hermann G√∂ring later testified at the Nuremberg Trials that the Nazis' willingness to repress German communists prompted President Paul von Hindenburg and the German elite to cooperate with the Nazis. The first concentration camp was built at Dachau in March 1933 and its original purpose was to imprison German communists, socialists, trade unionists and others who opposed the Nazis. Communists, social democrats and other political prisoners were forced to wear red triangles. In 1936, Germany concluded an international agreement with Japan in order to fight against the Comintern. After the German assault on communist Russia in 1941, the Anti-Comintern Pact was renewed, with many new signatories who were from the occupied states across Europe and it was also signed by the governments of Turkey and El Salvador. Thousands of communists in German occupied territory were arrested and subsequently deported to German death camps. Whenever the Nazis conquered a new piece of territory, members of communist, socialist and anarchist groups were normally the first persons to be immediately detained or executed. On the Eastern Front, this practice was in keeping with Hitler's Commissar Order in which he ordered the summary execution of all political commissars who were captured among Soviet soldiers as well as the execution of all Communist Party members in German held territory.\\"The war that time forgot\\", The Guardian, 5 October 1999 The Einsatzgruppen carried out these executions in the east.  Spain  In Spain, the White Terror (or the \\"Francoist Repression\\") refers to the atrocities committed by the Nationalists during the Spanish Civil War as well as the atrocities that were committed afterwards in Francoist Spain.Beevor, Antony. The Battle for Spain; The Spanish Civil War 1936‚Äì1939 (Weidenfeld & Nicolson, 2006), pp.89‚Äì94. Most historians agree that the death toll of the White Terror was higher than that of the Red Terror. While most estimates of Red Terror deaths range from 38,000Beevor, Antony.

The manga was serialized in Kodansha's seinen manga magazine Good! Afternoon from November 2008 to July 2015. Story The plot revolves around Natsuo Ishido, a freshman in high school. She has a natural talent for everything she does, and as a result becomes bored with doing anything. She is often praised (and occasionally hated) for her incredible talent, but in reality she feels lonely, so she is often looking for more and more things to occupy her time. As she fails to find anything that is sufficiently challenging, her loneliness and boredom reach a bottomed-out state. One day, after a volleyball practice, she meets Yuzuko Mawatari advertising for the mixed martial arts (MMA) club, and although at the time she is uninterested, the idea stays with her for the rest of the day. She learns that Yuzuko and one other girl are the sole members of the club, and as such is not an official club yet, so she decides to investigate. She meets the two members and challenges Yuzuko to a spar, in which the two of them exchange glancing blows. When Sanae Sawamura, the captain of the karate team, shows up, Natsuo decides to leave. After she has left, she realizes her nose and lip are bleeding, and she resolves that she hates Yuzuko, and later returns to challenge her to another spar. She loses the spar, but gains a solid interest in MMA to the point where she quits the volleyball team. From that point the story follows her as she overcomes various challenges in order to become good enough to face Yuzuko again in a public match. This culminates in an 8-person qualifying tournament for a later tournament G-girl. Over the course of her second round fight with Sanae Sawamura, Natsuo's backstory is delved into and she faces up to the abuse dealt to her by her older brother. After a close but cathartic loss to Yuzuko in the finals, Natsuo is considered to be good enough to earn a spot as a stand in fighter at G-girl. Characters ; :Natsuo Ishido is the series' main protagonist. She is naturally talented at everything she does. Having lived with this ability her whole life, she cannot understand why other people cannot do things which she can do. This has given her a condescending attitude against her opponents, who she goads and teases during their match and after Natsuo's inevitable victory. She is also ruthless when fighting, whether or not the fight is a serious one (she once defeated Mai by swiftly kicking her in the stomach, knocking her to the ground and rendering her unable to move). :Natsuo has come to the realization that people with the ability to be the best without even trying have the hardest time, since they don't have anyone to bond with and their whole life is one big competition. She is lonely and yearns for someone who can defeat her and give her something to actually work for. ; :Yuzuko is Natsuo‚Äôs main rival throughout the manga. Born in Japan, she moved with her parents to Brazil. While there she became an exceptional MMA fighter under the training of Mario Cordeiro. She is the captain of the budding MMA club at the Natsuo‚Äôs high school and is close friends with Mario Cordeiro daughter, Ringi. It is two early fights with Yuzuko that drive Natsuo to become an MMA fighter. Yuzuko has no talent, but makes up for this limitation with pure tenacity and a single-minded focus on moving forward. As a result, Yuzuko often comes off as \\"creepy\\" by others, who are disturbed by the level of enjoyment she derives from MMA. ; :Sanae is the captain of the karate team. In the year previous to the events of the series, she went to the National Karate Competition and placed second, raising the near-defunct karate team into recognition. She has declared an unofficial war on the MMA club, and has convinced the other karate team members to do the same. She and Natsuo were childhood friends, but ever since Natsuo left the karate team on the basis that no one on the team was good enough, she has acted cold toward Natsuo. This feeling accentuated after she saw Natsuo fighting with Yuzuko and drew the conclusion that Natsuo had joined the MMA club. ; :Ringi is the daughter of world-renowned MMA champion Mario Cordeiro. She has lived in Brazil for most of her life, but returned to Japan to visit Yuzuko, her childhood friend. She is an amazing fighter, even to the point that Yuzuko suggested that Natsuo would be a good match for her. When fighting, she maintains an air of naivete, blurting false weaknesses to get her opponent into an opportune position. She oversaw the sparring rematch between Nasuo and Yuzuko, immediately seeing Natsuo's natural talent in the sport. Ringi has then been eager to have her sparring match with Natsuo ever since. ; :Mario is the father of Ringi Cordeiro. He is a legendary MMA champion who has never lost a match in over 500 fights. He considers Yuzuko to be his surrogate daughter. ; :Takenaka is a former pro MMA fighter and owner of the gym that Natsuo and Karin practice at. At the beginning of the manga he loses (possibly on purpose) a televised match to Ringi to generate interest in G-girl. His stated goal is to one day have a match with Mario Cordeiro. He has one daughter who unbeknownst to him practices MMA in the club Yuzuko started. ;Meika Takenaka :Risuke's daughter, together her, Yuzuko, and Ringi make up the three members of the high school MMA club. She goes unnamed until the last chapter of the manga having gone by the nickname \\"shrimp,\\" in reference to her poor, or at least underdeveloped, physique and skills. ; :Mai is a member of the karate team. She claims to be the only person who knows Sanae's dark past, and she hates Natsuo with a passion. It is heavily implied that she has a crush on Sanae. ; :Kei is Natsuo's friend from the volleyball team, and possibly Natsuo's only friend. ; :Karin is Natsuo's trainer at the MMA gym, and a fighter herself. Her record is 22-1, and she is considered one of the strongest women in Japan. She takes an interest in Natsuo after watching her fight with Sanae. She wishes to fight and defeat Ringi Cordeiro. ; :A trainee also learning MMA at Tanekada's gym under the tutelage of Karin. Also a freshman like Natsuo, Kirido was originally trained for Judo before shifting to MMA, and she and Natsuo first met in chapter 6 where they were formally introduced to each other by Karin, as well as the rest of the trainees. Physically, she is almost as tall as Natsuo (who stands 182cm), and stands at a height of 177cm (5'10), making her the only person in the gym to rival Natsuo as far as height is concerned. Somewhat fond of teasing people, she annoyed Natsuo when she referred to her as \\"Goliath\\", causing the latter to decide to make Kirido her first stepping stone. Halfway through the chapter, Kirido ends up paired with Natsuo in a practice sparring match, where she shows the latter a fair bit of grappling, making Natsuo realize that more physical contact is required in MMA than it was in Karate.

Numbers and distribution Economic and political problems in Zimbabwe have led to significant increases in migration to Botswana since the early 2000s. By 2003, it was estimated that there were 40,000 Zimbabwean migrants in the country, of whom only one-third were resident legally. Many reside in the Ledumadumane suburb of the capital Gaborone. There is also a camp for Zimbabwean refugees at Dukwe. Illegal migration The number of undocumented Zimbabwean migrants in Botswana was estimated at between forty and one hundred thousand . In 2012, Botswana deported 17,402 Zimbabweans, while in 2013 it had already deported 22,675 in the first ten months of the year. The illegal immigration issue has produced various tensions between the governments of Botswana and Zimbabwe, with Paul Mangwana even threatening to expel all Botswana nationals from Zimbabwe in response to the alleged poor treatment which Zimbabweans face in Botswana. Botswana claims to have deported 26,717 Zimbabweans residing in the country illegally in 2002. Beginning the following year, they also began to build an electrified fence along their boundary with Zimbabwe. Botswana's agricultural officials assert that the main purpose of the fence is to stop animal rather than human migration, with the aim of preventing the transmission of foot-and-mouth disease, but Zimbabwe's high commissioner in Gaborone rejects this explanation, calling it an attempt to make Zimbabwe into a \\"Gaza Strip\\". One survey found a support rate of 63% for the fence. Human rights abuses faced by Zimbabweans in Botswana have also become the subject of a play entitled \\"Voice of the People\\", with actors from both countries. Employment Zimbabweans are the most numerous nationality among registered foreign workers in Botswana. More than half of Zimbabwean migrant workers are employed in cow herding and similar agricultural occupations, while others work in construction, real estate, retail, education, health and manufacturing. Others, especially the more-easily-exploited irregular migrants, are engaged as maids or in sex work.

GVT has been in the market since the end of 2000. GVT today operates under the Vivo brand.  History  Global Village Telecom was founded in April 1998 by a group of Israeli investors led by entrepreneur Joshua Levinberg, who previously founded Gilat Satellite Networks. Their idea was to build a satellite-based phone network for remote locations in South America using the VSAT technology that was developed by Gilat Satellite Networks. The initial investors in the company included: Magnum Technologies Fund, which held 55% of the company, US investment bank Merrill Lynch held 20%, Clal Information Technologies 10%, Discount Investment Corporation 10%, and Gilat Satellite Networks 5%.Shaul Shani - GVT, Globes 29/12/1999, Efi Landau During 1998 and 1999 GVT won tenders to build rural phone networks in Colombia,Israel's GVT to Set Up $80 Mln Telephony Network in Colombia, Efi Landau Globes, 27/09/1999 Chile and Peru.GVT of Gilat Group Wins Second Tender in Chile: $2.5 Mln Rural Phone Network Efi Landau, Globes, 08/07/1998  Brazil Fixed-line Telecommunications Licence  In 1999 GVT was awarded a 20 years license to provide fixed-line telecommunications services in Brazil's south and central regions. As part of Brazil's government plan to introduce competition in three fixed-line regions of the country. When it privatized the state telecommunications company, Telebras, in 1998, the government divided Brazil into three regions for fixed-line telephony. Each region was to have one newcomer and an incumbent. In each case, the incumbent was a former unit of Telebras, which was privatized. The region for which GVT won the license had a population of 38 million people at the time and encompasses nine states, including the country's capital, Brasilia. GVT plan was to invest US$550 million over three years and to build a network with 500,000 lines. GVT was to compete in the region against the former Telebras unit Tele Centro Sul, which was owned by a consortium led by Telecom Italia. In 2001, GVT was split between Gilat Satellite Networks and the other investors in the company. Gilat took over the Colombia and Peru operations and GVT remained solely focused on the Brazilian market.

He served as Bishop of Detroit from 1888 until his death in 1918. Biography John Foley was born in Baltimore, Maryland, to Matthew and Elizabeth (n√©e Murphy) Foley, who were both natives of Enniscorthy, County Wexford, Ireland. His older brother was Bishop Thomas Foley, who served as Coadjutor Bishop of Chicago (1870-1879). After attending local parochial schools in Baltimore, he completed his studies in the classics and philosophy at St. Mary's College in 1850. He then studied theology at St. Mary's Seminary until 1853, when he was sent by Archbishop Francis Kenrick to further his studies in Rome at the Pontifical Athenaeum S. Apollinare, from where he obtained his Licentiate of Sacred Theology in 1857. While in Rome, Foley was ordained to the priesthood by Cardinal Costantino Patrizi on December 20, 1856, at the Lateran Basilica. Upon his return to Maryland in November 1857, he served as pastor of St. Brigid's Church in Baltimore. He was transferred to Saint Paul Catholic Church at Ellicott's Mills in 1858, and then to St. Peter's Church in Baltimore as a curate in 1864. In 1865 he founded and became first pastor of St. Martin's Church. Foley also served as principal of the House of the Good Shepherd, and assisted Archbishop Martin John Spalding in establishing new missions and schools and developing charitable institutions. A childhood friend of Cardinal James Gibbons, he was secretary of the Third Plenary Council of Baltimore in 1884 and co-authored the Baltimore Catechism. He was nominated as Bishop of Wilmington, Delaware, in 1886 but his name was rejected by the Congregation for the Propagation of the Faith. On February 11, 1888, Foley was appointed the third Bishop of Detroit, Michigan, by Pope Leo XIII. He received his episcopal consecration on the following November 4 from Cardinal Gibbons, with Bishops John Loughlin and Edgar Wadhams serving as co-consecrators, at the Baltimore Cathedral. He was Detroit's first American-born bishop, with his two predecessors both hailing from Germany. During his tenure, he established a seminary for Polish Americans, and later healed a long and damaging schism among them. In 1900, Foley wrote a letter for the Detroit Century Box time capsule. In 1907 the priests and laity of the diocese, in honor of the golden jubilee of his priestly ordination, presented Foley with St. Francis's Home for Orphan Boys, built at a cost of $250,000. He established the first parish for African Americans, St. Peter Claver's Church, in 1911, although chapels and missions for African American Catholics had existed since the late 1870s. The development of the automobile industry in Detroit led to a massive increase in population, and the number of Catholics more than tripled during Foley's tenure. Although the number of diocesan priests nearly doubled, there still were not enough to administer to the growing population. Despite his popularity and personal charm, he was generally regarded as an ineffective bishop with an unsuccessful administration. Foley later died at age 84. His 30-year-long tenure remains the longest in the history of the Archdiocese of Detroit.

Shpolsky primary scientific contribution belongs to the field of molecular spectroscopy, particularly luminescence and absorption spectra of polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons. In 1952 Shpolsky and his junior researchers A. A. Ilyina and L. A. Klimov discovered Shpolsky effect (Shpolskii matrixes, an optical analogy to M√∂ssbauer effect) in organic compounds, a property that allows highly selective spectroscopic identification of substances that normally do not possess clearly defined spectral lines or bands. The discovery evolved into a discipline of its own, Shpolsky spectroscopy.See Gooijer et al. for a review of current (as of 2000) applications.Personov, pp. 13-15, outlines practical applications of selective spectroscopy. Shpolsky authored the definitive Russian language university textbook on Atomic Physics, first printed in 1944 and reissued until 1974. Biography Shpolsky studied at the department of physics of Moscow State University. In the aftermath of the Casso affair of 1911 professors of physics Pyotr Lazarev and Pyotr Lebedev and their assistant Sergey Vavilov resigned and joined the faculty of the fledgling private Shanyavsky University.Shpolsky 1965 Shpolsky followed them, remaining de jure a student of Moscow State, and made his first research assignment in Lazarev's private laboratory in Arbat District. He graduated from the department of physics of Moscow State University in 1913 and joined the staff of Shanyavsky University. In 1918 he returned to Moscow State University and lectured there until 1939. In 1932 he also joined the faculty of Moscow State Pedagogical Institute and chaired its department of physics for 46 years.Bolotnikova 1992, p. 184 He received the doctorate at MSU in 1933. After World War II Shpolsky engaged in physical studies of carcinogens. He reasoned that carcinogens should possess physical properties distinct from harmless substances, and although no such link was ever found, his studies led to the discovery of Shpolsky effect. In 1952 Shpolsky, Ilyina and Klimov published an articleE. V. Shpolskii, A. A. Ilina and L. A. Klimova (1952). Transactions Doklady of the U.S.S.R. Academy of Sciences, volume 87, pages 935 in Doklady Akademii Nauk asserting that complex organic substances that normally do not have clearly defined spectral lines do, in fact, emit or absorb them at low temperatures when mixed with specific organic solvents. Use of the solvent, forming a snow-like paraffin structure at 77 K, was a radical departure from an established spectroscopy routine. In the same year Pyotr Kapitsa provided Shpolsky his laboratory to repeat the experiment at lower temperatures. This property became known as Shpolsky effect; Soviet authorities formally recognized it as a discovery only after Shpolsky's death. Organic compounds possessing this effect became known as Shpolsky matrixes and Shpolsky systems.Hieftje et al., p. 192 The method, although lacking solid theoretical foundation,\\"Understanding of the nature of Shpolskii spectra came later...\\" - Personov, p. 2 provided extreme spectral selectivityHieftje et al., p. 216 and became a major improvement in detecting 3,4-benzapyrene in the 1960s.Shabad 1967, p. 1132Bolotnikova 1992, p. 188 In 1961 Karl Rebane suggested that Shpolsky effect was an optical analogy to M√∂ssbauer effect (see zero-phonon line and phonon sideband). Roman Personov, an alumnus of Shpolsky laboratory, confirmed Karl Rebane hypothesis in 1971. Later studies showed that matrix isolation fluorimetry has significant practical advantages over original Shpolsky methode.Hieftje et al., pp. 215-216 References External links * Bibliography (in Russian) (Uspekhi Fizicheskikh Nauk) Sources  * , in: *  published in: pp. 171‚Äì179 * Category:1892 births Category:1975 deaths Category:Soviet physicists Category:20th-century physicists Category:Russian physicists Category:Russian editors Category:Soviet educators Category:Cancer researchers Category:People from Voronezh Category:Moscow State University alumni Category:Moscow State Pedagogical University faculty ","title":"Eduard Shpolsky"},{"id":"24104446","text":"An extragalactic planet, also known as an extragalactic exoplanet, is a star- bound planet or rogue planet located outside of the Milky Way Galaxy. Due to the huge distances to such worlds, they would be very hard to detect directly. However, indirect evidence suggests that such planets may exist. Nonetheless, the most distant known planets are SWEEPS-11 and SWEEPS-04, located in Sagittarius, approximately 27,710 light-years from the Sun, while the Milky Way is between 100,000 and 180,000 light years in diameter. This means that even galactic planets located farther than that distance have not been detected. Candidate extragalactic planets Twin Quasar-related planet A microlensing event in the Twin Quasar gravitational lensing system was observed in 1996, by R. E. Schild, in the \\"A\\" lobe of the lensed quasar. It is predicted that a 3-Earth-mass planet in the lensing galaxy, YGKOW G1, caused the event. This was the first extragalactic planet candidate announced. This, however, is not a repeatable observation, as it was a one-time chance alignment. This predicted planet lies 4 billion light years away.Extrasolar Visions, \\"The Q0957+561 Planet\\" (accessed 1 September 2009) PA-99-N2 A team of scientists has used gravitational microlensing to come up with a tentative detection of an extragalactic exoplanet in Andromeda, the Milky Way's nearest large galactic neighbor. The lensing pattern fits a star with a smaller companion, PA-99-N2, weighing just around 6.34 times the mass of Jupiter. This suspected planet is the first announced in the Andromeda Galaxy. Evidence of a population of rogue planets A population of unbound planets between stars, with masses ranging from Lunar to Jovian masses, was indirectly detected, for the first time, by astrophysicists from the University of Oklahoma in 2018, in the lensing galaxy that lenses quasar RX J1131-1231 by microlensing. M51-ULS-1b In September 2020, the detection of a candidate planet orbiting the high-mass X-ray binary M51-ULS-1 in the Whirlpool Galaxy was announced. The planet was detected by eclipses of the X-ray source, which consists of a stellar remnant (either a neutron star or a black hole) and a massive star, likely a B-type supergiant. The planet would be slightly smaller than Saturn and orbit at a distance of some tens of AU. Refuted extragalactic planets HIP 13044 b A planet with a mass of at least 1.25 times that of Jupiter had been potentially discovered by the European Southern Observatory (ESO) orbiting a star of extragalactic origin, even though the star now has been absorbed by our own galaxy. HIP 13044 is a star about 2,000 light years away in the southern constellation of Fornax, part of the Helmi stream of stars, a leftover remnant of a small galaxy that collided with and was absorbed by the Milky Way over 6 billion years ago. However, subsequent analysis of the data revealed problems with the potential planetary detection: for example an erroneous barycentric correction had been applied (the same error had also led to claims of planets around HIP 11952 that were subsequently refuted). After applying the corrections, there is no evidence for a planet orbiting the star. If it had been real, the Jupiter-like planet would have been particularly interesting, orbiting a star nearing the end of its life and seemingly about to be engulfed by it, potentially providing an observational model for the fate of our own planetary system in the distant future.

Early life He studied law in the first half of the 1960s and lived in New York City between 1973 and 1982, working as interpreter for the United Nations, and then tried to become a lawyer and then he realized that he wanted to be a writer. He maintained an intense relationship with novelists Juan Benet and Juan Garc√≠a Hortelano, poet Pere Gimferrer and writer (and neighbour) F√©lix de Az√∫a. He currently lives in London. Writing career In 1975 he published his very successful first novel, La Verdad sobre el Caso Savolta (The Truth About the Savolta Case), where he shows his ability to use different resources and styles. The novel is considered a precursor to the social change in the Spanish post-Franco society and the first novel of the transition to democracy. He describes the union fights at the beginning of the 20th century, showing the social, cultural and economic conditions of workers in Barcelona by that time. A year later he was awarded the Critics Prize. His most acclaimed novel is probably La Ciudad de los Prodigios (The City of Marvels, 1986), about the social and urban evolution of Barcelona between the Universal Expositions of 1888 and 1929. It was film adapted by Mario Camus in 1999. In 1992, he published the novel, El A√±o del Diluvio (The Year of the Flood), which tells of the inner conflicts faced by Sister Consuelo after she meets and falls in love with Augusto Aixel√¢, with very evocative descriptions of the post-civil war prevailing deprivations in Spain by that time. In 1996, he published his third major Barcelona-related novel, this time set in the 1940s, Una Comedia Ligera (A Light Comedy). Also within Mendoza's work stands the saga of the mad detective, a peculiar character, a nameless accidental-detective locked up in a mental hospital. The first of these novels, El Misterio de la Cripta Embrujada (The Mystery of the Enchanted Crypt, 1979) is a parody with hilarious moments mixing hard-boiled genre with Gothic narrative. In the second novel of the saga, El Laberinto de las Aceitunas (The Olive Labyrinth, 1982), Mendoza confirms his talent as parodist; the novel stands as one of his most successful works. The third novel of the saga, La Aventura del Tocador de Se√±oras (The Adventure of the Ladies' Dressing Table), and the fourth one, El Enredo de la Bolsa y la Vida (The Money and the Life Muddle), were published in 2001 and 2012, respectively. The 5th novel was released in 2015 under the title of El Secreto de la Modelo Extraviada (The Secret of the Missing Model) with great success. The Spanish newspaper El Pa√≠s published two of his novels in instalments, Sin Noticias de Gurb (No Word from Gurb, 1990) and El √öltimo Trayecto de Horacio Dos (The Last Journey of Horatio Dos, 2001), both of them science fiction comedy novels. In 1993 appeared his first play, Restauraci√≥ (Restoration), written in Catalan and later translated into Spanish by Mendoza himself. This first theatrical piece was followed by two other titles that the three of them were published together in 2017. In October 2010, he won the literary award Premio Planeta for his novel Ri√±a de Gatos. Madrid, 1936 (An Englishman in Madrid). In December 2013, he won the European Book Prize (fiction) also for An Englishman in Madrid. Later on, in June 2015, he received the Franz Kafka Prize, the first Spanish writer to win it. In 2016 he was awarded the Premio Cervantes, the current most prestigious prize for Spanish-written literature. 2018 saw the launch of the novel El Rey Recibe (The King Receives), the first book in the Three Laws of Motion trilogy, which explores the major developments of the second half of the 20th century. Eduardo Mendoza's narrative studies divides his work into serious or major novels, and humorous or minor ones. Although recent studies have shown the seriousness, criticism and transcendence in his parodic novels, as well as the humor presents in his serious ones, due to the influence of the characteristics of the postmodern novel. Eduardo Mendoza is considered among the most important Spanish living writers, alongside novelists like Arturo P√©rez-Reverte and Andr√©s Pascual, all of them included in the so-called Spanish New Narrative.

In order for the cleaning card to work properly in the device, the card resembles or mimics the material of the transaction media ‚Äì such as a credit card, check, or currency. As the cleaning card is inserted and passed through the device, it will clean components that would normally come in contact with the transaction media such as readers, lenses, read/write chip and pins, belts, rollers, and paths. Cleaning card products are widely accepted and endorsed by device manufacturers and industry professionals. Many have developed their own cleaning cards to better clean their particular devices. A typical cleaning card is much like a wiper or sponge that can get into areas that are not readily accessible. Typically, the cleaning card has a solid core covered by a soft wipe-like material. The product is then saturated with a cleaning solution recommended by the device manufacturer and then placed in a sealed pouch to maintain the saturation level and cleanliness of the card.  Invention and Evolution  The cleaning card was originally patented by Stanley H. Eyler and the patent (US#5525417 A) was assigned to his employer, the Clean Team Company. The Clean Team Company later changed its name to KICTeam, Inc., which continues to be the leading manufacturer of cleaning cards. The cleaning card has evolved with the equipment they need to clean. A good example is the bill acceptor. Initially, the bill acceptor was designed for vending machines as a means of selling candy to the public. It includes a device that recognizes that a US one dollar bank note has been inserted. The cleaning card was required to be the same shape as US currency in order to be accepted into the device to clean it. Vending machines began accepting higher denominations as well as having the ability to make change. Specialized sensors were introduced into the bill acceptors to recognize multiple denominations and to only accept media that contained bank note characteristics. The bill acceptor cleaning card was redeveloped to contain magnetic ink and bank note characteristics so as to be accepted by the equipment. The development of bill acceptors for slot machines in the gaming and casino industry required the bill acceptor to be more sophisticated. The bill validators needed to validate currency of multiple denominations up to a one hundred dollar bank note. Fraud was now a critical issue and was addressed by multiple sensors and optics throughout the inserted currency pathway. These sensors and optics were recessed so as to keep currency from running across them with each insertion and wearing down sensitive lenses.  Area of application  Cleaning cards are used in the gaming, wagering, vending, hotel, retail, lottery, petroleum, manufacturing, shipping, auto id, card printing, banking. For example, this includes all places that credit cards or cash are inserted into a machine to make payments.  Cleaning of the magnetic head  The magnetic head inside the POS Terminal is a fixed component and for this reason it only can be cleared by cleaning cards that are flexible enough to clean the leading, center and trailing edges of this round reader head. The cleaning of the magnetic head is very important because it's responsible for the reading of the card and so it decides acceptance or rejection of the inserted card. The cleaning card is not only cleaning the reading area of the magnetic head which is cleared. There is also a cleaning process within the device along the card path. The cleaning in these high dirt build-up areas is especially important and ensures efficient cleaning of the card reader.  Cleaning of chip reading contacts  Chip Cards are also known as Smart Cards and EMV Cards. There are two different types of EMV card readers - friction and landing. Contaminated contacts can result in rejection of the inserted payment or authorization card. The cleaning card with ensures optimal cleaning of chip reading contacts.  Cleaning of motorized card readers  Motorized readers are built in, for example ATMs. The credit/debit-card is inserted into the card slot, where the first magnetic head is placed. If a magnetic stripe can be recognized, a shutter will be opened and the card will be transported to the second magnetic head by roles. The card is read, thereby the device knows whether the transaction goes over the micro chip or the magnetic stripe. If no micro chip is placed on the card, the transaction goes directly above the magnetic head. If the data gives the order for a transaction over the micro chip, the card is placed on the chip reading contact and is stopped. The chip contacts, are fitted on the chip and now the transaction begins. If the reading of the magnetic stripe respectively by the micro chip is not possible, the card will be declined. A cleaning card for a motorized card reader will need a magnetic stripe built into it to activate the acceptance shutter.  Cleaning of check and document scanners  Check scanners are used by banks or business through remote deposit capture programs to take a digital image of the check and send the information to the bank for deposit. This is where the image of a check on your bank statement originates. If a check scanner is not properly cleaned financial institutions risk increased transaction failures, equipment malfunctions, personnel costs to reconcile poor images, equipment repair or exchange and non-compliance due to poor image quality. A cleaning card designed to clean a specific model of check scanner is run through the device the same way the operator would run a check through the device. The cleaning card makes contact with the optical lenses, micr reader, transport belts and rollers, print heads and clears the check path.  Transactions Terminology  Transactions are any action that has a monetary implication or transfer information from one media to another. The most commonly thought of transactions are the use of credit or debit cards through a card reader of some type. Card readers are also widely used for hotel door locks or access control devices.

These risks and returns have to be carefully analyzed and the instruments have to be properly valued applying various methods of valuation. * Portfolio Management Different investors have different risk profiles and return- expectations. Hence different portfolios have to be developed and managed to achieve the objectives of the investors. Depending upon the changing circumstances, the portfolios have to be rebalanced. Asset allocation and risk-return management are the key functions of a successful portfolio manager. * Mutual and Other Funds A wide variety of mutual funds, pension funds, and hedge funds have come into existence. Each mutual fund has several schemes: growth schemes, income schemes, balanced schemes, sectoral schemes, index-linked schemes, tax-planning, schemes etc. Several insurance companies have to manage their investment funds as per Insurance Regulatory Development Authority Regulations. Securities and Exchange Board of India has kept in place detailed regulations for mutual funds. * Code of Conduct The CFAs are required to adhere to the code of ethics and standards of professional conduct covering various aspects like integrity, ethical behavior, professional competence, objectivity, professional independence and public trust.

It lies in the districts of L√ºchow-Dannenberg and L√ºneburg.  Description  The state forest near the village of R√∂then The G√∂hrde includes the entire unparished area of G√∂hrde, parts of the municipality of G√∂hrde (both in L√ºchow-Dannenberg district) as well as parts of the municipalities of Nahrendorf and Boitze (L√ºneburg district). The forest is also part of the Elbufer-Drawehn Nature Park and is located on a plateau with an average height of 80 metres above NN (roughly from 50 to 110 m NN) in the northwestern area of the Drawehn. Because the G√∂hrde region has no rivers it was never settled. The state forest of G√∂hrde is about 75 km¬≤ in area and at its heart has some very old stands of trees. Many of these giant trees (especially English Oaks) have been designated as natural monuments and are protected. The main species of tree in the woods, which lie on the mostly sandy soils and rolling terrain, are the Scots Pine, Common Beech, Spruce and Oak. The long-stemmed oaks are important for silviculture and belong to the most profitable in Germany, due to their closely spaced annual rings, that are produced by the warm, sunny climate and low levels of rainfall. In the Breeser Grund (Breese Bottom) in the south of the G√∂hrde a Hutewald of some has been preserved with old isolated oaks and heath landscapes. Fallow Deer, Red Deer and Mouflon live in the forest. The Breeser Grund is an EU Special Area of Conservation which is especially worth protecting as are the beech woods in the G√∂hrde (Buchenw√§lder in der G√∂hrde) southeast of the village of G√∂hrde itself.  History  The G√∂hrde was once a favourite hunting ground of the Dukes of Brunswick-L√ºneburg. Later the Kings of Hanover also hunted here and ‚Äì to 1918 ‚Äì the German emperors. The buildings of the old G√∂hrde hunting lodge still stand in the village of G√∂hrde in the heart of the state forest. The castle itself was demolished in 1827. The remaining buildings house the G√∂hrde Training Centre (Bildungszentrum G√∂hrde). On the northern edge of the forest in the village of Breese am Sei√üelberge is G√∂hrde station, on the Wendland Railway, which was named after the forest. Because the emperors of Germany used to alight at this station as they travelled to their hunts in the forest it was also locally known as the Kaiserbahnhof (Emperor Station).

The Vessantara JƒÅtaka tells the story of one of Gautama Buddha's past lives, about a compassionate prince, Vessantara, who gives away everything he owns, including his children, thereby displaying the virtue of perfect generosity. It is also known as the Great Birth Sermon. The tale of Prince Vessantara is celebrated as an annual festival in Thailand, Laos, Myanmar, Sri Lanka and Cambodia.  Accounts  The story has slight variations in other parts of Asia: in Tibet, the story is known as the Jƒ´naputra Arthasiddhi S≈´tra and the prince known as Arthasiddhi; in China, it is known as Taizi Xudanuo Jing and the prince is known as Sudana (È†àÂ§ßÊãèÂ§™Â≠ê). He is known as Shudaina-taishi in Japan. When Gautama Buddha visited his father's kingdom for the first time after he achieved enlightenment, elders of the ruling dynasty did not pay him respect out of conceit, since they were older than the former Prince Siddhartha. The Buddha miraculously appeared in the air above his relatives. His father was the first to bow down and admit that it was time to pay respect to his own son. Other members of the dynasty then bowed down and accepted the religion. Suddenly, rain clouds gathered and a red-drop rain appeared. This miracle led to his followers asking, \\"What is this rain?\\" He then explained that this rain had appeared once before during his previous life. Then, he told them the story of his life as King Vessantara.  Vessantara's birth and youth  King Vessantara was the son of Sa√±jaya, king of Sivi, and was born in the capital city of Jatuttara. At this point, Buddhist tradition regards him as a bodhisatta (), a Buddha-to- be.The Wetsandon Jataka translated by John Crocker His mother, according to tradition, was a princess who did great meritorious deeds and wished to become the mother of the person who would be the next Buddha. After she died, the princess ascended to heaven and became one of the consorts of the deva (Buddhism) called Sakka or Indra. She lived happily until the day she had to be reborn again as a human. Indra gave her ten boons she could ask for, and one of wishes she made was \\"Let me become the mother of bodhisattva, who in his next life will achieve enlightenment\\". She descended to the human world, was born in the court of a king, and later married to King Sa√±jaya. On the last day of her pregnancy, the Queen wished to site-see in the capital city. Her husband granted her that wish. She visited several districts, and the people were delighted by their queen. While she was in the merchant quarter, she gave birth in an emergency delivery at the bazaar, in the heart of the city. Therefore, the newborn prince and heir was named Vessantara, which means 'Born in the merchant quarter'. As soon as he opened his eyes, the infant prince asked his mother for money to give to the poor. On the same day, a female elephant brought her newborn calf to the royal palace. The calf was pure white. Vessantara grew up to be a kind person who was willing to give away his belongings to others. His parents were delighted by their son's character and supported the prince's charity with their treasures. Vessantara married princess Madri. They had two children: the Prince Jali and the Princess Kanhajina. Sa√±jaya retired and Vessantara was crowned King.  Banishment and life as hermit  One day, Vessantara gave away the magical white elephant, which had brought rain to his kingdom, to envoys from Kalinga, a neighboring country which was facing a drought . The citizens of Vessantara's kingdom were distressed by the fear of drought because of the loss of the elephant. Thus, they convinced King Sanjaya to resume control of the kingdom and banish his son Vessantara. The king readily gave away his kingdom to his father. Before leaving the city and going to live in the forest as a rishi (hermit) with his wife Madri and their two children, Jali and Kanha, he also gave away his wealth.The Vessantara Jataka One of his loyal courtiers suggested that the family should live at Vamka Mountain. They left the city on a four-horse chariot. Along the way Vessantara gave away his horses and four deities appeared in the form of stags to pull the chariot. Then he gave away his chariot. The family walked on foot through a forest. The young prince and princess saw wild fruit hanging on high branches, but their parents could not reach it. Miraculously, all the trees bent their branches for them. The family then arrived at the neighbouring kingdom of Ceta. The king of Ceta was informed of their arrival and rushed to greet the prince. He was touched by their story and offered his throne, but the prince declined. He and his family also declined to stay in a palace. They started to live celibate lives on a mountain called Vamka. The king of Ceta ordered a hunter to patrol the entrance to the mountain, to prevent anyone from disturbing the family. Meanwhile, Jujaka, a greedy old brahmin who lived as a beggar, had a very young wife, Amittada, who was also very beautiful and hard-working. During the drought, Amittada regularly brought water from the well for her old husband. The husbands of the other women in the village held her up as an example of a good industrious wife. One day, in a fit of jealousy, all the village women gathered by the well and beat up the Brahmin's young wife, tearing her clothes. In Chapter 11, the children are cared for while Jujaka sleeps. This painting is from the 19th century, Thailand. In the collection of the Walters Art Museum From that day onwards Amittada refused to go to the well any longer. She pushed Jujaka telling him to find her some servants in order to spare her more ridicule. She did not give her husband any peace. Jujaka met a forester guarding the entrance to the Vamka Mountain and tricked him by claiming that Vessantara's banishment had been revoked. He met a hermit and tricked him as well. Finally, the brahmin Jujaka went to the forest to prince Vessantara while his wife Madri was away. He asked him for his two children, which Vessantara readily gave away. Jali and Kanha went to hide in a lotus pond. Their father found them and asked if they would help their father achieve his highest goal, the attainment of Buddhahood a future life. Both agreed and became Jujaka's servants. Vessantara told the brahmin to bring the children to their grandfather, saying, \\"The king will reward you for bringing his beloved grandchildren back to him\\". Jujaka disagreed, stating the Sunjaya would execute him instead. The brahmin tied both children with vines and dragged them like cattle. Both children begged their father to help them while the old man scolded and beat them with his stick. Vessantara could not stand this scene and reached for his weapon he kept in his hut. However, he overcame all anger and let his children be taken away. Madri's return passage to their residence was blocked by tigers (actually deities in disguise). When she didn't see her children, she wandered around all night looking for them and finally collapsed before her husband. Vessantara thought she was dead so he lamented his loss. He put her head on his lap and realised that she was still breathing. He revived Madri with water. She woke up and rose immediately to keep a distance appropriate for her vow of celibacy. Vessantara told her what had happened. After Madri learnt that her husband gave away their children, she praised him for his greatness. Fearing that Vessantara would give away his wife as well, the deity ≈öakra intervened and in disguise, asked for his wife Madri, who Vessantara readily gave him. Then Indra gave Madri back to Vessantara as a trust, for all his acts of benevolence and generosity had been perfect.Vessantara JƒÅtaka No. 547.  Return to Sivi  Two deities felt sympathy for the young prince and princess. They disguised themselves as their parents and helped nurse Jali and Kanha. They made Jujaka take a wrong turn and led him to into Sivi Kingdom and through the palace gate. King Sanjaya saw the two familiar faces and ordered royal guards to bring them to him. He recognized his grandchildren and paid for their price. Kanha's price was higher than her brother's, as her father wanted no-one to buy her from Jujaka. In fact, both Jali and Kanha's prices were so high that only king Sanjaya could have bought them. Jujaka became extremely rich. At his first meal as a rich man, he ate too much. His digestive system failed and he fell dead upon his plate. King Sanjaya sent his men to find Jujaka's family to seize the latter's wealth; however, his wife and in-laws were afraid of the punishment for Jujaka's treason, so they fled. Sanjaya arranged a grand procession to meet his son and daughter-in-law. The Kingdom of Kalinga also returned the white elephant, now that Kalinga had become prosperous again. This abated the anger of the people of Sivi. Jali led the army and civilians to his parents' residence and the family was reunited. After the most happy moment, all six of them collapsed. The red rain poured down from Heaven to revive the family. This rain \\"soaks those who want to be soaked, but will not fall on those who want to stay dry.\\" Vessantara was crowned as king again and returned to his kingdom. Indra blessed the Sivi Kingdom with a rain of gems. Vessantara allowed people to keep those gems for themselves and the leftovers went into the Kingdom treasury, which he used for his charity. His treasure never ran out. Lord Buddha explained that each person had been reborn in the time of the Buddha as people surrounding the Buddha's person. His parents used to be Vessantara's parents. Madri was now reborn as the Buddha's former wife. Jali became Rahula, the Buddha's son. Kanha became Upalavanna, the bhikkhuni (nun). The loyal courtier who informed him of the place he should stay became Ananda, his now cousin and attendant. Jujaka became Devadatta, his now arch enemy. The white elephant became Maha Kassapa.  Culture and art  The Vessantara Jataka is celebrated in temples during a Buddhist festival known as Thet Mahachat (), from Maha Jati or \\"Great Birth\\", in Central Thailand, Boun Pha Vet in LaosBoun Pha Vet and as Bun Phawet (Bun Phra Wes), Bun Duan Sii ('Merit-making of the fourth month') or Thet Phawet in Isan. It is also an important celebration in Cambodia, Burma and Sri Lanka.The Importance of Medin Poya In Sri Lanka, verses of lament from the text Vessantara KƒÅvya are often recited at the corpse of a relative who just died, especially the verses of Madri mourning the loss of her children. This text was composed in Sri Lanka in the early modern period by a secular poet, and emphasizes abandonment and emotional desolation. The themes were very popular among the ordinary people, though the emphasis was very different than the earlier Buddhist texts. The Thet Mahachat is very popular both in rural and urban communities, often with dance and drama performances, as well as festive parades and processions through the towns. During this Buddhist festival the monks give a sermon about the entire text of the Vessantara Jataka, accompanied by rituals and cultural performances. Because of its central role in the Thet Mahachat or Boun Pha Vet celebrations, the Vessantara Jataka is an important part of the traditional folklore in many areas of the Southeast Asian region. Some of the scenes, especially the mismatched couple formed by Jujaka, the old Brahmin, and his young wife Amittada, are attractive for the public during the festival. While it has lost its traditional importance in some areas, in others it has gained in popularity. Scenes of the Vessantara Jataka are found depicted on the walls of Buddhist temples throughout Southeast Asia. They are also engraved on the murals of Angkor Wat, Cambodia, and depicted in ancient patterns on ikat silk cloth.  Role in legitimizing kingship  In the last seven centuries in Thailand, the Vessantara JƒÅtaka has played a significant role in legitimating kingship in Thailand, through the Great Birth festival. Merit-making and paramis were greatly emphasized in this festival, through the story about Prince Vessantara's generosity. Initially, the festival was an important way for the Chakri dynasty to legitimate itself, as Vessantara was the model prince who became king through the power of his merits and sacrifice. During the reform period of Rama IV, however, as Thai Buddhism was being modernized, the festival was dismissed as not reflecting true Buddhism. Its popularity has greatly diminished ever since. Nevertheless, the use of merit-making by the Thai monarchy and government to solidify their position and create unity in society has continued until at least the late twentieth century.  Depiction of brahmins  J≈´jaka plays an important role in the Vessantara story. Depicted as lustful, cruel and a coward, his very name implies decrepitude. These kind of depictions of brahmins are typical for Buddhist popular literature.  Gallery  File:SAAM 111.JPG|God Indra gives ten boons to Queen Phusati.

Over the years it has taken both day and weekly boarding pupils from the military garrisons of Buckeburg, Detmold, Hameln, Herford, Hohne, Nienburg, Osnabr√ºck, Paderborn, and Rinteln. It was originally located at the North Sea port city of Wilhelmshaven before moving to its present location.Policies After the school was closed, it served as a camp for refugees. Now the buildings are set to be demolished and replaced by a residential area. History Prince Rupert School (PRS) takes its name from the former coastal establishment HMS Royal Rupert, which had previously been a Kriegsmarine stronghold during Nazi rule, located at the scenic port city of Wilhelmshaven on the North Sea coast. The school has its beginnings from \\"Operation Union\\", which allowed Army and RAF personnel based in Allied-occupied West Germany to bring their families over. PRS is believed to be the first comprehensive, co-educational, boarding school under the terms of the Education Act 1944 and was one of the first schools established in Germany to exclusively educate children of British military personnel. Housed in a block of buildings along the port, it was formally handed over on 1 July 1947, by the lowering of the Royal Navy's white ensign and the raising of the Union flag. Present at this ceremony were many of the first 70 pupils who were attending school for a one-month trial period, prior to the full complement reporting to the school on 7 September 1947. Some pupils missed the ceremony as their truck became lost on its way to Wilhelmshaven. John Smitherman, the first headmaster, chose that name in recognition of the kindness and help he had received from the Royal Navy personnel of HMS Royal Rupert. The official opening ceremony of the school by George Tomlinson MP, Minister of Education, took place on 11 May 1948. PRS Wilhelmshaven main gate During the Cold War, it also occasionally took in children of Commonwealth servicemen. The 1960s saw a sharp increase in pupil numbers mainly due to the final closure of Lancaster School in the former Osnabr√ºck base. At its height, there were over 600 pupils, most of whom were boarders. As the Army and RAF were gradually pulling out of Germany (as an invading force, and becoming an occupying force), pupil numbers declined until the Service Children's Education authorities decided it was no longer feasible to run a school at Wilhelmshaven. A new location was chosen, in the town of Rinteln, with PRS Wilhelmshaven closing in June 1972. PRS Rinteln ‚Äì aerial view from the west The school re-opened as a day school in September 1972, on a purpose-built site on the outskirts of Rinteln that cost DM 18.5 million,HQ 1 Div Public Relations Press Release - BV/71/93/8 - 1972 although it wasn't until 6 June 1973 that the buildings were officially opened by Sir and Lady Alexander, the then Secretary of the Association of Education Committees. The new school, which was designed to double up as a war time hospital to cope with overflow from BMH Rinteln, had a teachers' mess to the rear for unmarried staff (married teachers were generally accommodated in quarters within the environs of the BMH). However, in 1982, the mess was renamed 'The Lodge' and repurposed as weekly boarding accommodation. In July 1997, Prince Rupert School celebrated its 50th anniversary with many celebrations, including a march through the local town centre featuring street performances by pupils. There was also a Reunion in Wilhelmshaven attended by about 500 ex-pupils and ex-staff. Following the UK government's Strategic Defence Review in 1998 (updated in 2002), it was decided to withdraw the British forces from Germany by 2020.Strategic Defence and Security Review The result meant that dwindling pupil numbers would lead to the inevitable closure of the school. The UK Government SDSR of 2010 brought planned the closure of Germany forward to 2018, and with the restructure of the remaining units around Paderborn and Bielefeld Garrisons, this meant that PRS was no longer a viable asset, with King's School in G√ºtersloh being chosen to become the final secondary school to remain open. At its height, the school's population in Rinteln was around 500 pupils. At the end it was fewer than 50, with around 14 of them as weekly boarders. The school held a celebration to mark the closure of the school over the weekend of 28‚Äì29 June 2014, which was attended by a large number of ex- pupils. A presentation to the local Stadt was made on 30 June, at which a permanent monument to the school was unveiled. The piece is shaped like an obelisk, made up with clay artwork from the last students of the school, and topped with a golden phoenix. Prince Rupert School closed its doors to the final students at 1400 CET on Tuesday 15 July 2014, and formally closed on Friday 18 July 2014. The German government has, since October 2015, used the former school buildings for about a year as refugee accommodation, with up to 600 residents. Now the buildings are set to be demolished and replaced by a residential area. Curriculum Like all SCE schools, PRS followed the National Curriculum and is inspected by Ofsted. Besides the mainstream GCSE and A Level subjects, BTEC and GNVQ (formerly) qualifications are also offered. In 2011, the school was rated \\"outstanding\\" and \\"good\\" in all aspects by Ofsted inspectors.2011 Ofsted inspection Boarding The Prince Rupert Lodge opened in 1982, using modern and comfortable accommodation that was formerly used to house unmarried teachers. Located behind the main school building, it offered a 'home from home' to those students who lived there throughout the week (weekend boarding was not provided). Pupils were looked after by house parents, a resident matron, two nurses and visiting tutors. With the closure of Osnabr√ºck garrison (the largest catchment area for the school) in 2008, student numbers dropped dramatically. This resulted in the closure of the area of The Lodge known as the \\"Boys Levels\\" in 2009. The drop in numbers prompted SCE to move those day pupils from Detmold (who had previously attended King's School, G√ºtersloh), to PRS to become weekly boarders. The Lodge closed its doors for the final time in June 2014, a month before the school closed.

The savior sibling is conceived through in vitro fertilization. Fertilized zygotes are tested for genetic compatibility (human leukocyte antigen (HLA) typing), using preimplantation genetic diagnosis (PGD), and only zygotes that are compatible with the existing child are implanted. Zygotes are also tested to make sure they are free of the original genetic disease. The procedure is controversial. Indications A savior sibling may be the solution for any disease treated by hematopoietic stem cell transplantation. It is effective against genetically detectable (mostly monogenic) diseases, e.g. Fanconi anemia, Diamond‚ÄìBlackfan anemia and Œ≤-thalassemia, in the ailing sibling, since the savior sibling can be selected to not have inherited the disease. The procedure may also be used in children with leukemia, and in such cases HLA match is the only requirement, and not exclusion of any other obvious genetic disorder. Procedure 8-cell human embryo, 3 days after fertilization Multiple embryos are created and preimplantation genetic diagnosis is used to detect and select ones that are free of a genetic disorder and that are also a HLA match for an existing sibling who requires a transplant. Upon birth, umbilical cord blood is taken and used for hematopoietic stem cell transplantation. Laws * In the United Kingdom, the Human Fertilisation and Embryology Authority (HFEA) has ruled that it is lawful to use modern reproductive techniques to create a savior sibling. *In Victoria, Australia, use of PGD for HLA typing is reviewed by the Infertility Treatment Authority on a case-by-case basis. Ethical considerations Arguments for or against the use of PGD/HLA tissue typing are based on several key issues including the commodification and welfare of the donor child. The main ethical argument against is the possible exploitation of the child, e.g. potential adverse psychological effects on a child born not for itself but to save another, and the possible future emotional reaction of the savior sibling upon discovering that they were born solely to save the life of the recipient, rather than being 'wanted' for reasons other than transplantation. A survey of 4,000 Americans showed that 61% approved of PGD use for savior siblings.Genetic testing of embryos to pick 'savior sibling' OK with most Americans medicalnewstoday.com, Article Date: 4 May 2004 - 0:00 PDT History Yury Verlinsky and collaborators described the first case in 2001.\\"Preimplantation Diagnosis for Fanconi Anemia Combined With HLA Matching\\", Yury Verlinsky et al. The Journal of the American Medical Association. Popular culture The novel My Sister's Keeper, later adapted into a film, is about a child who was born as a savior sibling to her sister Kate who is affected by acute promyelocytic leukemia. In the British soap opera Emmerdale, Debbie Dingle gave birth to her son Jack, who would serve as a savior sibling to his older sister Sarah, who was suffering from Fanconi anemia. On the popular American show CSI: Crime Scene Investigation, the episode \\"Harvest\\" deals with the reported abduction and later murder of a thirteen year-old girl named Alycia who was later revealed to be a savior sibling for her brother Daniel. In the American show Heroes, one of the protagonists, Mohinder Suresh is revealed to have been conceived to cure his sister Shanti of a deadly disease known as the Shanti Virus. However, Mohinder was born too late to save his sister. Through the first two seasons of the show, Mohinder's blood contains the only cure to the Shanti Virus as a result of the method of his conception. On Star Trek: Enterprise, the episode \\"Similitude\\" sees a clone created of Trip Tucker for the purpose of organ harvesting. \\"Sim\\" is born through the highly controversial use of an alien lifeform. The novel Never Let Me Go is centred around a dystopian future society where human clones are created and allowed to live to their teenage years before being used for organ harvesting.

The film was adapted from \\"Broadway Musketeers\\", a story by Jay Gelzer. Songs Three songs were written for White to perform in Broadway Babies: \\"Wishing and Waiting for Love\\" with lyrics by Grant Clarke and music by Harry Akst; \\"Jig, Jig, Jigaloo\\", lyrics by Al Bryan, music by George W.

Formation and early years (2007‚Äì2009)  Sierra Alpha toured exhaustively during their first two years on the circuit and played some major UK venues, including The IndigO2 at The O2 Arena. They also played support slots with Mexicolas and Jack Pe√±ate. The band got their name from the phonetics of their post code, as in, 'SA'.  Superhero EP and Pure Heroes (2009)  On 1 June 2009, Sierra Alpha released their debut Superhero EP on iTunes through independent label Major-G Records. Their limited-edition physical CD copy of the EP sold out within three weeks of release.Rees, C: Llanelli Star, 8 July 2009 The lead single from the EP, \\"Superhero\\", peaked at No. 86 in the iTunes Chart and has been included on the new version of the iPod Touch and iPhone‚Äôs game Tap Tap Revenge 3 and was available on Tap Tap Revenge 2. Following the release of Superhero EP, Goddard had the idea of stripping the band down and recording an acoustic EP to show off their versatility and live sound. Pure Heroes included three tracks from their EP with new arrangement which included trumpet, saxophone, French horn, violin and cello. They recorded it live at University of Glamorgan, Cardiff. With the new arrangements so popular amongst fans, the band offered it as a free download from Amazon. As it increased in popularity, both UK and US Amazon made it ‚ÄòSingle of the Day‚Äô.  EP1 and EP2 (2010)  As 2010 dawned, the critical consensus held that alternative pop music would dominate the year's musical landscape. In light of this, the band recorded a brand new EP simply titled, EP2. They also re-issued Superhero EP with extra songs, re- titling it, EP1. Physical copies of the EPs sold out within the first month of release.  Disbandment 2010  Sierra Alpha played a vital part in rejuvenation of the live music scene in their home-town of Llanelli. Not content with filling local venues and frustrated with licensing and age restrictions at music hot spots, they also toured the local schools and colleges in South Wales. In support of their ever-expanding fanbase, the band sold out their hometown theatre, Theatr Elli on 31 July 2010. The only unsigned act to do so in the theatre's 30-year history.

After also playing against New Zealand in a Twenty20 International match in Florida, Chandimal was selected for an ODI tri-series in Zimbabwe, where the two sides also played India. He made his debut against Zimbabwe, scoring an unbeaten 10 as his side cruised to a nine-wicket win and then registered his maiden international century by scoring 111 runs off 118 balls against India, an innings that helped his side both win the match (by six wickets) and knock India out of the tournament. He also became the youngest Sri Lankan to score an ODI century. right Chandimal made his Test debut for Sri Lanka in December 2011, in the second Test of the series against South Africa in Durban. He made half-centuries (58 and 54) in each of Sri Lanka's innings becoming the first Sri Lankan batsman to score half centuries in both innings on Test debut. This incidentally led Sri Lanka to their first Test win in South Africa. Chandimal holds the joint record for taking the most catches in a single T20I as a fielder (4) along with Darren Sammy, Ajinkya Rahane, Peter Borren, Corey Anderson and Babar Hayat. He too has taken the most catches for Sri Lanka in a single T20I. During 2015 ICC Cricket World Cup, against Australia in Sydney, Chandimal scored 50 off 22 balls, this was the fastest fifty by a Sri Lankan batsman in Cricket world cup history, before Angelo Mathews scored a 20-ball fifty, where Sri Lanka had a massive 377 target to chase.

Chandimal was included to the test series with India as the permanent wicket-keeper and showed an excellent talent in the test level as well. In the first innings, he scored 59 runs but eventually Sri Lanka were all out for 183. In the second innings after India's huge 375 runs, Sri Lanka were all out for 367 runs courtesy of Chandimal's brilliant knock of unbeaten 162 runs. He was the star for the Sri Lankan innings with 16 fours and 4 sixes. Sri Lanka had a 175 lead and India were just ended with 112 runs and Sri Lanka won the match by 63 runs.

Chandimal had an impressive run scoring throughout the England series in 2016 and then in Australia series at home. He scored five consecutive ODI half centuries, which equals most consecutive ODI fifties by a Sri Lankan with Jayasuriya, Sangakkara and Dilshan. He missed the Sri Lankan record, when he was declared LBW by Adam Zampa on 48, just short of 2 runs for Chandimal's sixth consecutive fifty. Chandimal finished the England series with scores of 52, 62, 63 and 53 and in first ODI against Australia, he scored his fifth consecutive fifty with unbeaten 80. Chandimal was not initially selected for the limited over series against India, but after the injury to Danushka Gunathilaka, Chandimal was brought into the ODI side. He played in the third ODI as the opener with Niroshan Dickwella and scored 37 runs, when he hit by a bouncer and injured his right thumb. After the conclusion of Sri Lanka's innings, media reported that he has a hairline fracture and ruled out of the Indian tour. Captaincy On 17 July 2013, Chandimal became the youngest ODI captain for Sri Lanka, when he was appointed as the ODI captain for first two matches against South Africa in Colombo. In 2013, he was also appointed captain of the Sri Lanka Twenty20 International side and also vice-captain of the country's one day international team. During the 2014 ICC World Twenty20, he stepped down from the captaincy after injury and suspension due to slow over rate and later Lasith Malinga appointed as the captain. Malinga was able to lead the team for their first ever Twenty20 champion title and this strengthen Malinga as the permanent captain of the Twenty20 team. He led the ODI team and T20I team in many occasions, where the permanent captains Angelo Mathews and Lasith Malinga were injured in many occasions. However, after many poor performances in bilateral series and in 2017 ICC Champions Trophy, Chandimal was dropped from limited over squads. During Zimbabwe tour, he was again dropped from the ODI squad as well. However, after terrible loss to Zimbabwe at home for the first time, the captaincy of Mathews was questioned and criticized by many critics. The result was, Mathews stepped down from the role in all formats on 11 July 2017. With that, Chandimal was named permanent captain of the Test team for Sri Lanka. His first test captaincy came during the one-off Test against Zimbabwe in July 2017. In the match, Chandimal scored 55 in the first innings, which is recorded as the highest test score by a debut captain in a first innings for Sri Lanka as well. Sri Lanka won the match by 4 wickets at the end, by chasing massive total of 388 runs. This chase was recorded as the best chase by Sri Lanka in Tests and best successful chase in Asia. However prior to India tour, Chandimal was contracted pneumonia and ruled out of the first test. Rangana Herath was appointed as the stand-in captain in the first match. However, with two more injuries during the match, Sri Lanka lost the match by 304 runs. Sri Lanka lost all three games, with the heaviest defeats recorded at home. During the first Test against Pakistan on 28 September at Abu Dhabi, Chandimal scored his maiden Test century as captain, which lasted unbeaten for nine hours. He scored 155 runs the match and guided the team to 400 runs for the first innings. With the magical spin from maestro Rangana Herath and Dilruwan Perera, Sri Lanka finally won the match by 21 runs, despite a low score in the second innings. On 6 October 2017, against Pakistan, Sri Lanka played their first day-night Test match. Chandimal scored 62 in the first innings, but dismissed for naught in the second innings. However, Sri Lanka won the match by 68 runs and won the series 2-0. With that, Chandimal had the distinction of being first captain in Sri Lanka's first day-night Test, and went to win the match. During the second Test against India at Nagpur, Sri Lanka experiences their heaviest defeat in test cricket. Skipper Chandimal was the only stand out performer in the match with two fifties in the match. In the third Test, Chandimal scored his tenth test century, becoming the fastest Sri Lankan to reach ten test centuries with 80 innings, bettering previous record of 84 innings by Thilan Samaraweera. He along with Angelo Mathews had a 181-run partnership in the match. For the partnership, they have faced 476 balls, which ranked as the longest partnership for any pair at the Kotla, longest partnership between a visiting pair in India in the last five years, and the second-longest stand for Sri Lanka against India. In 2018, Mathews was appointed as the permanent limited over captain after the debate over few weeks. However, in the first match against Zimbabwe in Bangladesh Tri-series, Mathews was sidelined with a right hamstring injury and removed from the squad for three weeks. With that, Chandimal was appointed as the captain. Under his captaincy, Sri Lanka won the tri-series beating Bangladesh in the final. On 7 February 2018, Chandimal was appointed as the captain for T20I side for Sri Lanka for Bangladesh tour, due to injury of permanent limited over captain Angelo Mathews. Under his captaincy, Sri Lanka chased a record breaking total of 193 in the first match and won the match by 6 wickets. In May 2018, he was one of 33 cricketers to be awarded a national contract by Sri Lanka Cricket ahead of the 2018‚Äì19 season. After suspension Chandimal was included to the one-off Twenty20 International against South Africa on 14 August 2018. He played as the wicket-keeper in the match as well. South Africa bowled out for 99 runs, which is their lowest score in T20Is. However, Sri Lanka lost 7 wickets in the easy chase, where Chandimal protected his end until the end. He was there at the end and held firm through sustained pressure from the South African pack to see Sri Lanka home with an unbeaten 36 runs. He was appointed limited overs captain after Matthews was sacked after 2018 Asia Cup. Due to poor performances throughout New Zealand and Australia tours, Chandimal was dropped from the Test squad for South Africa tour. Dimuth Karunaratne was named as the stand-in captain for the tour, while Chandimal was released to play domestic cricket and regain his form with the bat. In December 2019, Chandimal was recalled for the Pakistan test series. Ball tampering controversy During the second Test against West Indies at St. Lucia on 17 June 2018, Chandimal was found to be guilty of making ball tampering incidence. After video evidence indicated that on the second day's play, Chandimal was taking sweets out from his left pocket, putting them in his mouth, before applying saliva to the ball within the space of a few seconds. Two on-field umpires Ian Gould, Aleem Dar, television umpire Richard Kettleborough and match referee Javagal Srinath observed the incidence carefully and charged him with one Test ban and two demerit points. At the end of match, the hearing with match referee Javagal Srinath, his team management and other match officials took place with Chandimal and he wasn't able to recall what it was in mouth when he polish the ball with saliva. As a result, match referee handed Chandimal the maximum punishment available under the ICC Code of Conduct, which was two suspension points and a fine of 100% of his match fee. However, before finishing the match, Chandimal pleaded not guilty for the ball tampering incidence and this caused trouble in the start of Day 3 on test match. This was started in the morning, where two umpires asked to change the ball used in previous day with a new ball. Sri Lankan players did not accept that and refused to go into the field for the match. The incidence got worse when coach Chandika Hathurusinghe and manager Asanka Gurusinha also involved with the moment with match referee and umpires. Over the next two hours, several animated discussions took place between management and cricket officials, largely due to the fact that the incidence has informed in the next morning. If the incidence was announced on the last night, the situation might be different, as said by the players. With that, Srinath took a decision asked Sri Lanka to take the field before 11:30am (the scheduled start had been 9:30), or forfeit the game. Players finally agreed to play the match \\"under protest\\". Match referee awarded West Indies five penalty runs in the match after the incidence. On 11 July 2018, ICC concluded its hearing on the trio, who had pleaded guilty to a level three spirit of cricket offence. His hearing took place before the start of the first Test against South Africa, with him found guilty. He received a two-match ban, with Suranga Lakmal captaining the side in his place. On 16 July 2018, independent Judicial Commissioner handed down a further eight suspension points with maximum possible punishment for their spirit of cricket offence and suspended for four ODIs as well.

He was an able commander, but considered as brutal as Valeriano Weyler of Cuba. Early life and career He enlisted voluntarily in the Navarro Regiment in 1855, where he distinguished himself in Africa. He received the Cross of Isabelle Maria Lucia for gallantry. He then took part in the Ten Years' War in Cuba, where Spain sent 70,000 men, and the Third Carlist War. He was Colonel of the Princess Regiment and promoted to brigadier general in 1876 before being sent to Cuba. In Cuba, he was made Field Marshal and received the Cross of Military Merit. In 1882, he returned to Spain and was made a member of the Supreme Council of War and Navy, Captain general of Andalusia, and Supreme Chief of Infantry Inspection. Puerto Rico and Cuba In 1888, Polavieja became Governor general of Puerto Rico, a post from which he resigned in 1889. A year later, in 1890, he was sent to succeed Jose Chinchilla as Captain general of Cuba. Being one of the more competent administrators of the time, he resigned in 1892 as a protest against corruption of Romero de Robledo, a politician well known for his corrupt practices, and appointed Minister of Colonies by Prime Minister Antonio C√°novas del Castillo. He was later known as the Butcher of Cuba.http://www.elaput.com/govs1800.htm Governor General of the Philippines The revolution in Cuba led by Antonio Maceo Grajales inspired Philippine insurgents to revolt as well. Being the last important colony under control of Spain, the Spanish government tried to contain the Philippine Revolution under the administration of Ram√≥n Blanco y Erenas. The further spread of the insurgency in the Philippines led to the turnover of the post of Governor general to Blanco's second-in-command, Lieutenant General Polavieja. The Filipino historian Gregorio Zaide notes that Polavieja was installed with the help of powerful Spanish friars including the Archbishop of Manila during that time. Polavieja oversaw the court martial and death of Jose Rizal on December 30, 1896. Twenty four more people were executed with Rizal.https://www.loc.gov/rr/hispanic/1898/katipunan.html As of August 1896, there are 500 soldiers in Manila and 700 in the rest of the archipelago. Native mercenaries numbered around 6,000. By January 1897, a total of 25,462 officers and men had arrived from Spain. Governor Polavieja had an available force of over 12,000 men to suppress the rebels in Luzon alone. On February 13, 1897, he opened his first phase, the Cavite campaign. Polavieja advanced against the revolutionaries with 16,000 men armed with Spanish M93s, and one field battery. They were led by General Jos√© de Lachambre, and many of the soldiers he led were from Pampanga, fired during Blanco's administration He had scarcely reconquered half of Cavite when he resigned, owing to his bad health. He did, however, dispersed every major rebel contingent in Cavite. Around 4,000 rebels died in jails of Manila. Rizal execution Polavieja faced condemnation by his countrymen after his return to Spain. While visiting Girona, in Catalonia, circulars were distributed among the crowd bearing Rizal's last verses, his portrait, and the charge that Polavieja was responsible for the loss of the Philippines to the United States.Bahamonde Magro, √Ångel y Cayuela Fern√°ndez, Jos√© Gregorio, Hacer las Am√©ricas.

In 1980 it and an accompanying barn and shed were listed on the National Register of Historic Places, the northernmost property in the county listed. Buildings and grounds The farm is located along the north side of North Bergen Road in the small rural hamlet of North Bergen, part of the Town of Bergen. It is just west of Wood Road, a quarter- mile (400 m) south of the Orleans County line, southwest of the tripoint the two counties share with Monroe County. There is a church across the street and some other houses on either side, all with large lots, some of them also cultivated. North of the house the fields stretch , with the northern across the county line in the town of Clarendon. The three buildings are all located near North Bergen, at the south end of the property. The house is a T-shaped frame two-story structure seven bays wide with board-and-batten siding rising to a steeply pitched cross-gabled roof covered in asphalt shingles. On the north (rear) elevation the central section telescopes into three progressively smaller sections. The two smaller units are sided in shingle; an enclosed porch is on the northeast corner of a clapboard-sided wing on the east of the smallest extension. In the center of the front (south) facade is a recessed porch that serves as the main entrance. On its west side is a bay window with 36 separate panes of glass. The porch is screened by four fluted Corinthian columns. Above them the second story has a Gothic railing with four square latticework piers supporting the three ogee arches that shelter a small recessed balcony. Ogee trim also tops all windows save those in the inside of the porch and balcony, both sided in flushboard. The roofline's overhanging eaves are trimmed with decorative hand-sawn vergeboard. Inside, the house is laid out with a living room, dining room and kitchen in line from front to back on the first floor of the stem of the T. The east wing has a parlor; the west a family room. Many rooms, particularly the living room, retain their original \\"grained\\"] Gothic-style woodwork. There are two outbuildings. A barn behind the house is painted in red with white trim and has the name \\"G H Walker\\" on it. A frame shed to the northwest is similar to the barn but is not in as good condition. The frame shed collapsed and was taken down in 2009. History Aaron Gifford, postmaster of North Bergen, built the house around 1870 as the homestead for what was then a hundred-acre (40 ha) farm. The Carpenter Gothic style had been popularized several decades earlier in the pattern books of Andrew Jackson Downing, and these were often used by builders without any architectural training. The house shows many features of the style, such as the decorative vergeboards, steep cross-gabled roofs and vertical siding, the latter of which Downing recommended as more economical and better in tune with natural surroundings. The bay window west of the main entrance, not a feature found on every Carpenter Gothic home, was also a feature praised by Downing. In The Architecture of Country Houses, he wrote that they gave \\"an air of dignity even to the smallest dwellings. The linear quality of the home suggests the Federal and Greek Revival styles used for many rural homes earlier in the 19th century, and the unknown builder, familiar with those modes, may have unconsciously been recalling them. Gifford sold the farm to a Walker family in 1891. They seem to have added the two smaller rear wings and the east wing adjoining them to the house. At the time of the property's listing on the Register, when the Walkers still owned the house, the front porch was blocked by shrubs and the rear porch was instead used as the main entrance. The house was sold by auction in 1986 and purchased by William and Bonnie Perkins of Byron, NY for the purpose of renovation and resale. For four years the entire house was worked on: gutted and modernized without damage to any of the woodwork and character. The front porch steps were restored to the front porch. Their daughter, Jennifer Weaver, began renting the house in 1991 and eventually purchased the house in 2000. In 2018 the house was sold to Matt and Caitlyn Mckenrick. There have been no other changes to the house.

Walter Hoppe was born in Wallsee/Donau, Austria and obtained his doctorate in chemistry at the German University in Prague under Professor J. Boehm. Hoppe became professor and departmental head at the Max Planck Institute of Biochemistry in Martinsried, Germany from 1964 until his retirement in 1985. His most important contributions in the 1960s to 1980s were based on his experience with X-ray diffraction and electron microscopy, from which he derived pioneering theories, including the invention of \\"ptychography\\". These led to experimental studies of the practicability of performing high resolution three-dimensional reconstructions of complex biological macromolecules which at that time were not able to be assembled into the crystalline arrays necessary for structural determination by X-ray diffraction (e.g. ribosomes). Hoppe's ideas of combining many images of the same specimen (a negatively stained electron microscope preparation containing the object of interest) recorded over a wide range of tilt angles (not necessarily restricted to a simple tilt axis perpendicular to the electron beam), followed by reconstruction of the three-dimensional object via mathematical manipulations involving Fourier space transforms or weighted filtered back projections, constitute the basis of many extant 3D reconstruction techniques, including computer tomography in medicine and internal investigation of materials. He was acutely aware of electron damage causing alteration of the specimen's structure during observation and his studies contributed significantly to the development of minimal dose methodology. Much of his early contribution to the field has been overlooked by other workers since it was published mainly in German language journals. A biographical note appeared in J. Appl. Cryst.
